@TITLE:How can you know that current request exceeds maxRequestLength in ASP.Net?
@CONTENT:I'm developing a small web application in ASP.Net (framework version 3.5) using VS2008 and C# 3.0. There's a file upload, and I want to make sure that the whole request doesn't exceed 5 MB. I configured the web.config file and maxRequestLength is set properly. I'm overriding the page's OnError method. However, while investigating the exception, I don't see anything other than string literals and error codes that actually identify the "Maximum request length exceeded" error. All I have is the error code (the actual HResult) and the stack trace. It is also discussed here. This is a bit of a problem, because the implementation of the framework might be different on an OS different than mine: my development machine is Windows Server 2008, and the target machine might be Windows 2000/2003/2008 Server. In other words, is there a portable way to determine current error as "Maximum request length exceeded"?

@TITLE:CSS Horizontal Navigation, Dynamic Width Buttons, 100% Width, Img Backgrounds
@CONTENT:I'm trying to make a horizontal navigation bar with x number of unknown width buttons on the left, a 150px wide image to cap on the right side, and the space in between the buttons and the cap flows to take up 100% of the width of the screen. I'm not real good at CSS and I've been playing around with different setting using divs, tables, unordered lists and combinations of the three and cannot get it working properly. I'll try to draw it in ascii now: <----Button1----><-Button2-><---------------Spacer-----------><!Cap:150px!>
 So, the Buttons, against the left side of the screen, will shrink to fit the text content, the cap will be up against the right-hand side of the screen, and the spacer will expand/contract to make the whole assembly fill 100% of the screen. The images are PNG's with some transparency so images cannot overlap. Thanks for the help.

I have sub classed ComboBox and tried to hook on ITEM_CLICK of ComboBox.dropdown but this event is triggered after the value is changed. Also, I've tried MOUSE_CLICK ans MOUSE_DOWN but without success. In my code, I have added a "preChange" event to my CustomComboBox. This event should be triggered before a change is made. Also, I've introduced a method called commitChange that will be called manually to actually commit the change. How can I achieve the desired result?

@TITLE:Silverlight 3 Dataform Commit Button not activating
@CONTENT:I'm writing a ChecklistBox control, which is a listbox that renders CheckBoxes inside the list. I'm then using this control inside of a DataForm's EditTemplate. Along with this control, I've got two text boxes that are bound to properties of the DataContext of the Dataform. For reference, the ChecklistBox has three implemented properties... ItemsSource -> the list of possible items to have for the collection on your object. ObjectCollection -> the collection of objects that should be affected... think your order details in this scenario. CheckboxContentTemplate -> this is what should be shown next to the checkbox in the list (typically, this is just the text of the object, but it could be anything.) What I'm running into is that the Dataform's Commit button won't activate when I change the ObjectCollection. However, if I change the text of either textbox in the edittemplate during the execution of the program, my Commit button activates. Any ideas? @Shawn: I have two objects, Users & Roles... public class Users : INotifyPropertyChanged, IEditableObject
{
public string firstname {get{...}set{...}}
public string lastname {get{...}set{...}}
public RoleCollection Roles {get{...}set{...}}
}

public class Role : INotifyPropertyChanged, IEditableObject
{
public Guid Oid {get{...}set{...}}
public string Code {get{...}set{...}}
public string Name {get{...}set{...}}
public string Description{get{...}set{...}}
}

public class RoleCollection:BulkObservableCollection<Role>
{
}

public class BulkObservableCollection<T>:ObservableCollection<T>
{
public void AddRange(IList toAdd)
{
...
}
}
 let's say for arguement's sake that the above code has all the proper structure to handle the events in INotifyPropertyChanged and IEditableObject. When I go and build the checklistbox, I'm looking at the ObjectCollection ("user".Roles.Where(item => Item.Oid == role.Oid).Count > 0;) to say whether or not to initially check the checkbox or not. I know for fact that when I uncheck and check the boxes, the "DataContext" of the role is being added or removed from the object, as I traced it out. I'd like to somehow alert the dataform that when I remove an object from "Roles", that it is altering the object. I tried capturing the CollectionChanged event from ObservableCollection, and then firing off a "PropertyChanged("Roles")" event, but that didn't seem to solve it.
@CODE:public class Users : INotifyPropertyChanged, IEditableObject
{
public string firstname {get{...}set{...}}
public string lastname {get{...}set{...}}
public RoleCollection Roles {get{...}set{...}}
}

public class Role : INotifyPropertyChanged, IEditableObject

@CONTENT:I have a Silverlight user control that has no template and does not need one as it is simply a path with a RectangleGeometry that is resized by code. Now our designed has added a template to the tooltip of the path and I want to be able to provide a method for users of the control to change the layout of a portion of this template. If the template was part of an overall one for the control I could simply override the control's OnApplyTemplate method and grab a reference to the section I want to modify. But as the control has no template the overridden method in the control's code-behind is never called. Is there some way I can override the OnApplyTemplate method for the templated element in the control's code behind?

@TITLE:How to configure a system-wide package in osgi?
@CONTENT:I need to made available a library to some bundles. This library makes use of RMI, so it needs (as far as I know, at least) to use the system class loader in order to work (I tried to "osgi-fy" the library, which results in classcastexceptions at runtime). So what I did was to remove the dependencies from the bundles that use that library, compile them with the library included in the property jars.extra.classpath (in the build.properties of the eclipse project). Then I added org.osgi.framework.bootdelegation=com.blipsystems.*
 in the felix configuration file and started the felix container with the followin command line: java -classpath lib/blipnetapi.jar -jar bin/felix.jar
 ..which in turns throwed a NoClassDefFoundException for a class of the blipnetapi.jar library:

@TITLE:How To Prepare An ActiveX Control For Delivery Over The Web
@CONTENT:So i have the misfortune of embedding this proprietary ActiveX control we created into a web page so that it downloads the code from our server and installs as necessary. Our ActiveX requires a host of other files which need to be installed along with the activex control itself. It should also be noted that the activex and all its dependencies are c++-based COM objects (many use MFC). So I read this article about it: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa751974(VS.85).aspx But it leaves a lot of things unanswered. For one thing, my ActiveX is actually embedded in a DLL file that contains other COM interfaces. Also, is it possible to have the mentioned cab file include the ActiveX/SDK installer and run that if the GUID isn't present? For example: [version]
signature="$CHICAGO$"
AdvancedINF=2.0

[Add.Code]
Setup.exe=Setup.exe

[Setup.exe]
file-win32-x86=thiscab
run=%EXTRACT_DIR%\Setup.exe
 Security is not an issue here as this is an intranet-based solution (not available publically). Also, the article mentioned here seems really old. Is there more up to date info available?

@CONTENT:I have a series of numbers. I calculated the "auto-regression" between them using Yule-Walker method. But now how do I extend the series?

 c) the calculation of the coefficients: ar_coeffs = aryule(data,9);
 this gives: ar_coeffs =

@TITLE:Database Structure to store multiple inheritance classes
@CONTENT:I have two distinct (no inheritance) interfaces: IInvestable and IPricable and two classes: IndexClass and FundClass that are stored in seperate tables in my DB. IndexClass is IPriceable FundClass is IPriceable and IInvestable. I need a table to store prices against an IndexClass and a FundClass I need a table to store that FundClasses are invested in. One way might be to have two tables: Pricable and Investable which just have an ID column. Then have a foreign key on IndexClass: PricableID Also have two foreign keys on FundClass: PricableID and InvestableID. Then my Prices simply link to the PricableID and my Investments simply link to the InvestmentID as these will be unique. Alternativly I could have FundClassID and IndexClassID columns on the Price table but this doesn't seem scalable and seems like it'll be difficult to work with. Then let NHibernate figure it out - which I'm still not 100% certain it'll like! I can't really find anything on the internet with recommendations for storing Multiple Inheritance and wondered if anyone had any ideas for this or if they've tackled something similar in the past?

I found this link which contains some explanations but the links to download the sourcecode or the bin are not working. http://www.javalobby.org/articles/tomcat2go/ By searching a bit the Internet I managed to find in obscure site the binary which is not working and probably the src needs to be modified to be make it work. Does anyone know: where to find the src of that article ? If there is any implementation of Tomcat running from a usb flash, and in case any user experience from it. Thank you in advance.

@TITLE:jQuery UI: droppable background?
@CONTENT:I'm trying create a trashcan where after you've put some items there, you could simply open it and drag any trashed item out of it by dropping it outside the trashcan. The way I've set this, is my web app has a trashcan icon where I drop the items and clicking the trashcan opens a box with the trashed items and fades in a black transparent background that obscures everything else so you just focus on the trashcan box. The code is essentially <div id="background"></div>
<div id="trashcanContainer">
   <ul id="items">
     <li>item1</li>
     <li>item2</li>
   </ul>
</div>
 The background CSS is set to fixed position and 100% width and height and it is set as a droppable. The problem is that when I drag something from the trashcan and drop it on the background, it gets removed even if I drop it on top of the trashcan. Basically jQuery somehow doesn't understand that the trashcanContainer div is on top of the background div (and thus not part of the droppable) even if I define a z-index higher than the background. Is there any way I can make this work?
@CODE:<div id="background"></div>
<div id="trashcanContainer">
   <ul id="items">
     <li>item1</li>
     <li>item2</li>
   </ul>
</div>

@LINK:/questions/1491688/debugging-mergesort
@TITLE:Debugging mergesort
@CONTENT:I need to sort a doubly-linked list. According to the almighty wikipedia, mergesort is the way to go for that. The recursive algorithm works reasonably well, but as I'm writing a general-purpose implementation, performance might be an issue. Porting the iterative version for arrays will kill performance as rescanning the list to divide it into sublists is slow; for anyone interested - here's the code: static void sort(struct linked_list *list,
    int (*cmp)(const void *, const void *))
{
    size_t slice_size = 1;
    for(; slice_size < list->size; slice_size *= 2)
    {
        struct node *tail = list->first;
        while(tail)
        {
            struct node *head = tail;

            size_t count = slice_size;
            while(tail && count--) // performance killer
                tail = tail->next;

            count = slice_size;
            while(head != tail && tail && count)
            {
                if(cmp(head->data, tail->data) <= 0)
                    head = head->next;
                else
                {
                    struct node *node = tail;
                    tail = tail->next;
                    remove_node(node, list);
                    insert_before(node, list, head);
                    --count;
                }
            }

            while(tail && count--) // performance killer
                tail = tail->next;
        }
    }
}
 But there's another iterative version using a stack-based approach: struct slice
{
    struct node *head;
    size_t size;
};

static void sort(struct linked_list *list,
    int (*cmp)(const void *, const void *))
{
    if(list->size < 2) return;

    struct slice stack[32];
    size_t top = -1;
    struct node *current = list->first;

    for(; current; current = current->next)
    {
        stack[++top] = (struct slice){ current, 1 };
        for(; top && stack[top-1].size <= stack[top].size; --top)
            merge_down(list, cmp, stack + top);
    }

    for(; top; --top)
        merge_down(list, cmp, stack + top);
}
 This will push size 1 lists onto the stack and merges down as long as the top list is of greater or equal size than its predecessor. Unfortunately, there's a bug somewhere as for some input lists, merge_down() will fail a sanity check: static void merge_down(struct linked_list *list,
    int (*cmp)(const void *, const void *), struct slice *top)
{
    struct node *right = top->head;
    size_t count = top->size;

    --top;

    struct node *left = top->head;
    top->size += count;

{
    // sanity check: count nodes in right list
    int i = count;
    struct node *node = right;
    for(; i--; node = node->next) if(!node)
    {
        puts("too few right nodes");
        exit(0);
    }
}

    // determine merged list's head
    if(cmp(left->data, right->data) <= 0)
    {
        top->head = left;
        left = left->next;
    }
    else
    {
        top->head = right;
        struct node *node = right;
        right = right->next;
        remove_node(node, list);
        insert_before(node, list, left);
        --count;
    }

    while(left != right && count)
    {
        if(cmp(left->data, right->data) <= 0)
            left = left->next;
        else
        {
            struct node *node = right;
            right = right->next;
            remove_node(node, list);
            insert_before(node, list, left);
            --count;
        }
    }
}
 The linked list implementation might be relevant as well: struct node
{
    struct node *prev;
    struct node *next;
    long long data[]; // use `long long` for alignment
};

struct linked_list
{
    struct _list _list; // ignore
    size_t size;
    struct node *first;
    struct node *last;
};

static void insert_before(struct node *node, struct linked_list *list,
    struct node *ref_node)
{
    if(ref_node)
    {
        node->next = ref_node;
        node->prev = ref_node->prev;
        if(ref_node->prev) ref_node->prev->next = node;
        else list->first = node;
        ref_node->prev = node;
    }
    else // empty list
    {
        node->next = NULL;
        node->prev = NULL;
        list->first = node;
        list->last = node;
    }
    ++list->size;
}

static void remove_node(struct node *node, struct linked_list *list)
{
    if(node->prev) node->prev->next = node->next;
    else list->first = node->next;
    if(node->next) node->next->prev = node->prev;
    else list->last = node->prev;
    --list->size;
}

@LINK:/questions/1489112/c-sharp-generics-determine-generic-type-from-consuming-generic-method
@TITLE:C# Generics - Determine generic type from consuming generic method
@CONTENT:Long story: I'm working on a system that will have Tasks and Handlers. Tasks will be sent from disparate parts of the system to the Handlers, where they will eventually return a value. We've got a system in-place that is loosely-typed and has turned into something of a gnarled mess (the problem is significantly amplified by the fact that the task-initiators are often coming from third-party components that are essentially plug-ins). I've been thinking of ways to implement the same in a strongly-typed fashion--and might just be taking this to the point of obsurdity--but am close to what I'd like. The problem is some syntax. Here's what I've got (generic names expanded for clarity): interface ITask<ReturnType> { }

interface ITaskHandler<TaskType, TaskReturnType> where TaskType : ITask<TaskReturnType>
{
    TaskReturnType PerformTask(TaskType task);
}
 As you can see, ITask is generic, and the declared generic parameter for ITask is the return-type for ITaskHandler<ITask>. This means that each TaskHandler is contractually bound to return the type specified by its ITask. The big downside that declaring TaskHandlers leads to some fairly ugly Signatures... class SpecificTask : ITask<Dictionary<Type,Delegate>>
{
}

class SpecificHandler : ITaskHandler<SpecificTask, Dictionary<Type, Delegate>>
{
    public Dictionary<Type, Delegate> PerformTask(SpecificTask task)
    {
        return new Dictionary<Type, Delegate>();
    }
}
 My question is: since SpecificTask has already provided it's ReturnType as a generic parameter, can SpecificHandler's signature be shortened to something more like: interface ITaskHandler<TaskType> where TaskType : ITask
{
    // pulling TaskReturnType out of thin air...
    TaskReturnType PerformTask(TaskType task);
}

class SpecificHandler : ITaskHandler<SpecificTask>
{
    public Dictionary<Type, Delegate> PerformTask(SpecificTask task)
    {
        return new Dictionary<Type, Delegate>();
    }
}
 ...and if so, how would I declare the return type of PerformTask when the type is contained within SpecificTask?
@CODE:Tasks Handlers interface ITask<ReturnType> { }

interface ITaskHandler<TaskType, TaskReturnType> where TaskType : ITask<TaskReturnType>
{
    TaskReturnType PerformTask(TaskType task);
} ITask ITask ITaskHandler<ITask> TaskHandler ITask class SpecificTask : ITask<Dictionary<Type,Delegate>>

@TITLE:Make GWT interact with ASP.NET Web Service
@CONTENT:Does anyone know of a good article or tutorial on the Internet demonstrating the use of GWT leveraging a (ASP.NET) web service cross domain? To my knowledge, interacting with either XML or JSON should be possible from GWT, but becomes a lot more difficult when the web service is on a different domain. I've tried finding an article that demonstrates this setup, but without any luck.

@TITLE:Postgres SCHEMA isolation
@CONTENT:I was wandering if it's possible to create a user on a postgres database (version higher than 8.3) which could access only a certain specified schema. The problem is, that on my database I have a few schemas. If I revoke all privileges from a certain user on all schemas except one, he can still browse the database using the i.e. PgAdmin tool. By browsing he can actually see the data structure, and all the functions although he cannot query anything. Is the kind of schema isolation, in which certain user wouldn't be able to know if the other schemas exist possible in Postgres database at all? Thx!

We develop this application with multiple developers, and I want to prevent the day we don't add the constraints to a table in the same order, so the second key on my machine is the third key on another machine, and vice-versa.

@TITLE:Encoding/decoding REST path parameters
@CONTENT:I am trying to find the best way of getting round a design flaw in a web app I'm helping to support. One part of the service passes a parameter ("myparam") to a .jsp page, which in turn calls a REST service including our myparam as a path parameter. The design flaw bit is that myparam should be passed as a form parameter, since it can be free text. However, we cannot change the implementation as other parties are involved at the .jsp end of things. My solution was to encode the myparam using hex encoding (url encoding alone doesn't work as you end up with "%" etc. which the org.restlet implementation of REST doesn't like seeing in path parameters). Using the Apache codec library, I have something like this: Option 1 (just hex): String decodedParam = new String(Hex.decodeHex(myparam.toCharArray()));
 which works for our purposes. What I really wanted to do was to combine URL- and Hex-encoding, so that I can really cover all posibilities: Option 2 (hex + url-decoding): Parameter preparation: String workText = URLEncoder.encode(inText, encoding); // a
char[] encodedBytes = Hex.encodeHex(workText.getBytes()); // b
String myparam = new String(encodedBytes);
 Decoding (REST): String decodedParam = new String(Hex.decodeHex(myparam.toCharArray())); // c
String doubleDecodedParam = URLDecoder.decode(decodedParam, "UTF-8"); // d
 I have two questions: why doesn't the second option work? (whenever I try and URL-decode my string at d) I get a java.lang.IllegalArgumentException). I've tested the double-encoding-and-decoding of my parameter values at http://ostermiller.org/calc/encode.html without problem. is there a better way to encode path parameters with REST?
@CODE:String decodedParam = new String(Hex.decodeHex(myparam.toCharArray())); String workText = URLEncoder.encode(inText, encoding); // a
char[] encodedBytes = Hex.encodeHex(workText.getBytes()); // b
String myparam = new String(encodedBytes); String decodedParam = new String(Hex.decodeHex(myparam.toCharArray())); // c

    </ul>
    <div id="menuBar" class="container">&nbsp;</div>
 </div>
 And the JQuery: $(function() {
    $('.container').corner();
    $('ul#menu li').corner('30px top');
});
 and on each page something like: $(function() {
    $('#menuHome').addClass('current')
 })
 I would like to indicate the "current" tab with a drop shadow behind it. I am thinking I would do this by Create a shadow 'li' with $('.current').after('&nbsp') Use CSS to set the shadow color and round the top right corner with jquery Shift it over with CSS position: relative; top: 5px; left: -5px; The problem that I am having is that the shadow appears on top of the element to the left. Setting its z-index low makes it disappear altogether for some reason. How do I make it appear behind the previous list-item? Alternatively, what's a better way to do this?

@TITLE:how to use proxy with JSON
@CONTENT:I have a php page called 'dataFetch.php' which sits on one webserver. On another webserver, I have a JS file which issues JSON calls to dataFetch. dataFetch connects to a database, retrieves data and puts it in a JSON format which is fed back to the calling program. In IE, this works fine. In other browsers it does not because of the cross domain restriction. To get across the cross-domain restriction, I make a call to a file, proxy.php, which then makes the call to dataFetch. My problem now is that proxy.php retrieves the file from dataFetch but the JS script file no longer sees the response from proxy.php as a JSON format and so I can't process it. Can anybody help me out?

@TITLE:Minimizable JFrame that stays on top of main application window
@CONTENT:My apps pops up a dialog. Users usually want to switch back and forth between this dialog and the application window for a period of time. I want this dialog to stay on top, so that it doesn't get hidden behind the main application window. But at the same time I want the dialog to have a minimize button so that it can get out of the way if it's not needed for a while. Here is what I've tried: use a modeless JDialog - the dialog stays in front nicely, but it doesn't not have a minimize button, and it doesn't have its own taskbar button either use a JFrame - the dialog now has a minimize button and its own taskbar button, but when the main window gets focus the dialog is hidden behind it. use a JFrame and add WindowListener.windowDeactivated() { this.toFront() } on the dialog. The problem with this is that toFront() also sets the focus, so that you get a weird focus flickering effect. use a JFrame with setAlwaysOnTop - this is the neaerest solution, but now the window will stay on top of all other applications, not just my application. It would be easy if toFront just brought the JFrame to the front without changing the focus, but unfortunately that is not the case. Is there another way to change JFrame Z-order? edit: It just occurred to me that if there were an easy way to "roll-up" a JDialog, i.e. minimize it but not to the taskbar, that would solve my problem too.

The above code works, I'm wondering why, when I try to put the code into the live page (jujumamablog.com, where there are other scripts and -ish) that this stops working. Thanks in advance.

@TITLE:javascript: submit form in an iframe¡Khelp
@CONTENT:I can't believe I've never done this before.... Here's my situation: I am using 2 jQuery plugins. Shadowbox and validate (bassistance). I click on a link to sign up for a newsletter. The link opens a form in a shadowbox. No biggie. The form is validated with the plugin. When the form is validated and ready to submit, it doesn't. This is what my submitHandler option (in the validate plugin) looks like: submitHandler: function(form) {

form.submit();

var s = window.parent.Shadowbox;
s.open({
player:     'iframe',
title:      'Thank you!',
content:    'http://www.somesite.com/includes/thank_you_grid_3.php',

@TITLE:Objective-C function dispatch collisions; Or, how to achieve ¡§namespaces¡¨?
@CONTENT:I have an application for Mac OS X that supports plugins that are intended to be loaded at the same time. Some of these plugins are built on top of a Cocoa framework that may receive updates in one plugin but not another. Given Objective-C's current method for function dispatching, any call from any plugin to a given Objective-C routine will go to the same routine every time. That means plugin A can find itself inside plugin B with a trivial Objective-C call! Obviously what we're looking for is for each plugin to interact with its own version of the framework upon which it was built. I have been reading some on Objective-C and this particular need, but haven't found a definitive solution for it yet. Update: My use of the word "framework" above is misleading: the framework is a statically-linked library, built into the plugin(s) that need it. The way Objective-C handles dispatching, however, even these statically linked pieces of disparate code will co-mingle in the Objective-C dispatcher, leading to unintended consequences. Update 2: I'm still a bit fuzzy on the answer provided here, as it doesn't seem to propose a solution as much as an unproven hypothesis.

@CONTENT:I have a collection of posts created by separate users in my database. Each user can create posts and edit only their posts. To edit their post, users navigate to a page "Posts/EditPost?PostID=x" where x is the post ID. The "Posts" controller has an '[Authorize]' attribute and the GET part of the action checks to see if the post was made by the user. If the user did indeed make the post, it renders the view. In the view there is a hidden field with the "PostID". When the user submits the form, the POST part of the action rechecks if the PostID matches a post created by the current logged in User. Is there a better way to accomplish this without having to double check if the user has access to edit the post, or is this the best way?

@LINK:/questions/1474052/synchronize-shell-script-execution
@TITLE:Synchronize shell script execution
@CONTENT:A modified version of a shell script converts an audio file from FLAC to MP3 format. The computer has a quad-core CPU. The script is run using: ./flac2mp3.sh $(find flac -type f)
 This converts the FLAC files in the flac directory (no spaces in file names) to MP3 files in the mp3 directory (at the same level as flac). If the destination MP3 file already exists, the script skips the file. The problem is that sometimes two instances of the script check for the existence of the same MP3 file at nearly the same time, resulting in mangled MP3 files. How would you run the script multiple times (i.e., once per core), without having to specify a different file set on each command-line, and without overwriting work? Update - Minimal Race Condition The script uses the following locking mechanism:   # Convert FLAC to MP3 using tags from flac file.
  #
  if [ ! -e $FLAC.lock ]; then
    touch $FLAC.lock
    flac -dc "$FLAC" | lame${lame_opts} \

      --tl "$ALBUM" \
      --add-id3v2 \

    rm $FLAC.lock
  fi;
 However, this still leaves a race condition.

I add a ListRequest.Filters property, which is to be a list of strings taken from the querystring: ?filter=foo&filter=bar If I declare .Filters as a Get/Set of type List(Of String), DefaultModelBinder does exactly what you would expect. However, if I declare .Filters as a Get/Set of IList(Of String) instead, DefaultModelBinder stops binding values to that property completely. Is this a feature, or a bug?

 This works very fine. Now, I wish I can use HttpClient, to talk to the server, as I use telnet to talk to the server. The reason I wish to use HttpClient, instead of using raw TCP socket, is because HttpClient does support NTLM. However, when I use POST method with NameValuePair : new NameValuePair("[SORT]", "0,1,0,10,5,0,KL,0")
 The request will become URL encoded. The server doesn't understand URL encoded request. %5BSORT%5D: 0%2C1%2C0%2C10%2C5%2C0%2CKL%2C0
 Is there any way I can avoid this? If not, what is the alternative library I can use? I wish to support NTLM as well.

@CONTENT:I am using HtmlBox 2.8 (http://remiya.com/cms/projects/jquery-plugins/htmlbox/) This jQuery plugin turns a TextArea of your choice to RichTextBox editor. In FireFox 3.5.3 I can not get focus (cursor) into the textarea. If I click on "Html" button which switches to HTML view, the control gets the cursor and editing is enabled both in HTML and Text views. Also I noticed that in FireFox using the demo page that is provided in the controls download package, the cursor is misplaced for approx. half height under the toolbar section. I know this is a "long shot" question, but if anyone maybe struggled with this, please help. Regards, Tom

@TITLE:Array of images that have to be placed in one horizontal line (with scrolling)
@CONTENT:I just designed a portfolio website. I have a whole array of images that I want to keep in one line (with horizontal scroll). This only happens when I have set a fixed width for the surrounding div (in this case with class '.post-images'), wide enough to contain all images. This could be just fine if the amount of images and their widths wasn't dynamic. Unfortunately this isn't the case here. I want this div to be wrapping around all images and not causing them to float. I have tried to set the div's where I put each image in ('.post-image') to 'white-space: nowrap' to no avail. See an example here: Link How can I fix this problem? I hope someone is willing to give me a hand here ;) Thanks, Jeroen

@TITLE:VB.NET XML Parser - Find elements with specific attribute & value
@CONTENT:HI, I am using VB.NET to read an XHTML file. I need my program to find every element within the XML structure which has the "class" attribute set to a specific value. IE: I need an array (or similar list) of all elements from the document which contain class="mytag". There is a list of several values I need to detect, all of which start with the same word 'mytag' followed by another word - so using a "contains" function seems sensible here. Any suggestions of ways I can parse out these attributes would be appreciated. Cheers.

@CONTENT:I'm building an asp.net mvc app that uses the default url route ?/{controller}/{action}/{id}? My problem is with the last item in this route, the id. The mvc framework automatically casts whatever in put in the id to the type of the parameter declared in the action. example: url: /mycontroller/myaction/1 public class mycontroller: Controller {     public ActionResult myaction(int id)
    {
      // it works id == 1
    }
 } But if I declare in the action a parameter of a custom type the mvc framework is unable to map the last part of the route to the parameter. example: url: /mycontroller/myaction/xpto public class mycontroller: Controller {     public ActionResult myaction(MyType id)
    {
      // it fails to cast "xpto" to my type
    }
 } Where should I tap in the framework to teach it how to do it?

@CONTENT:So having managed to crack getting nusoap to poll the chemspider server for information however I get a response that will display using print_r but when using print will simply display Array. My question is this really, how do I take the given response and turn it into a php array The code for the nusoap client <?php
require_once('../lib/nusoap.php');
$client = new nusoap_client('http://www.chemspider.com/Search.asmx?WSDL', 'wsdl');
$err = $client->getError();
if ($err) {
    echo '<h2>Constructor error</h2><pre>' . $err . '</pre>';
}
$query = 'methanol';
$token = 'token';
$result = $client->call(SimpleSearch, array('query' => $query, 'token' => $token), array('return' => 'xsd:string'), "http://www.chemspider.com/SimpleSearch") ;
// Check for a fault
if ($client->fault) {
    echo '<h2>Fault</h2><pre>';
    print_r($result);
    echo '</pre>';
} else {
    // Check for errors
    $err = $client->getError();
    if ($err) {
    // Display the error
    echo '<h2>Error</h2><pre>' . $err . '</pre>';
} else {
    // Display the result
    echo '<h2>Result</h2><pre>';
    print_r($result);
    echo '</pre>';
}
}



echo '<h2>Request</h2><pre>' . htmlspecialchars($client->request, ENT_QUOTES) . '</pre>';
echo '<h2>Response</h2><pre>' . htmlspecialchars($client->response, ENT_QUOTES) . '</pre>';
echo '<h2>Debug</h2><pre>' . htmlspecialchars($client->debug_str, ENT_QUOTES) . '</pre>';
?>
 This gives the following output (minus the debug information): Result

@LINK:/questions/1469865/easy-c-longest-line-copying-program
@TITLE:Easy C longest line copying program
@CONTENT:This is variation of one of exercises from Kernighan C book. Basically prints the longest line from standard input. My question is, if looking at the 'copy method', how does the copy method actually work if it returns void. I'm coming from Java and learning C for the first time. In the copy method, the to and from char arrays are local. How do they actually get stored in longest and line variables in the main method if they are in no way returned back to main? I am very confused... Thanks very much for the time! Edit: Thank you for the replies. One more note... Oh. So you the author is passing the values with pointers. That is extremely confusing since the a page before it reads - "...in C the called function cannot directly alter a variable in the calling function; it can only alter its private, temporary copy." Is that correct? Second question is, how can I make these functions pass data around just like in Java, PHP and etc. Or is this something C programmers see as a benefit? Code from K&R #include <stdio.h>
#define MAXLINE 1000

int getline(char line[], int maxline);
void copy(char to[], char from[]);

main () {

 int len;
 int max;
 char line[MAXLINE];
 char longest[MAXLINE];

 max = 0;

 while ((len = getline(line, MAXLINE)) > 0) {

   if(len > max) {

     copy(longest, line);

    def setWrapper( self, obj )

 So when someone says xxx().x = 'hello' I want it to set the value on xxx().inner.whatever and not xxx().x. Is this possible? I have been trying lambdas, but to no avail. I'm using Python 2.5 Edit: Now my wife isn't rushing me to bed so I can flush out the code a bit more. I kind of had an idea about what you guys had below, but from the docs it seemed that you should avoid overriding __setattr__/__getattr__ and use property instead. If it is not possible to do this via the property function then I will use the __setattr__/__getattr__? Thanks

@TITLE:ASP.NET MVC Issue with Using Reflection Created Objects with the Default Model Binder
@CONTENT:I am having a weird issue in ASP.NET MVC with objects not being updated with UpdateModel when passed a formCollection. UpdateModel does not appear to be working properly when the object being updated is created through reflection. Scenario: I have an application which has approximately 50 lookup tables--each of which includes exactly the same schema including typical fields like id, title, description, isactive, and createdon. Rather than build 50 views, I wanted to have a single view which could display the data from all of the lookup tables. I created an Interface called IReferenceEntity and implemented it in each of the POCOs representing my lookup tables. Using this interface, I am able to easily populate a view with a record from the lookup table. (I pass the items to the view via the following.) System.Web.Mvc.ViewPage<MyNamespece.IReferenceEntity>
 From the database to the view, every thing works perfectly. However, when I attempt to update the model on post, I am running into some problems. If I explicitly declare an object reference like the following, every thing works perfectly and the values of my object are updated with the values from my form. Hence, I can then update the database. AccountStatus a = new AccountStatus();

UpdateModel(a, formCollection.ToValueProvider());
 Unfortunately, hard coding the object type would completely defeat the reason for using an interface. (A primary objective of the application is to be able to dynamically add new tables such as lookup tables without having to do anything "special". This is accomplished by reflecting on the loaded assemblies and locating any classes which implement a specific interface or base class) My strategy is to determine the concrete type of the object at postback and then create an instance of the type through reflection. (The mechanism I use to determine type is somewhat primitive. I include it as a hidden field within the form. Better ideas are welcome.) When I create an instance of the object using reflection through any of the following methods, none of the objects are being updated by UpdateModel. Type t = {Magically Determined Type}

object b = Activator.CreatorInstance(t);

UpdateModel(b, formCollection.ToValueProvider());


Type t = {Magically Determined Type}

var c = Activator.CreatorInstance(t);

UpdateModel(c, formCollection.ToValueProvider());


Type t = {Magically Determined Type}

IReferenceEntity d = Activator.CreatorInstance(t);

UpdateModel(d, formCollection.ToValueProvider());
 Note: I have verified that the objects which are being created through relection are all of the proper type. Does anyone have any idea why this might be happening? I am somewhat stumped. If I was really "hard up", I could create factory object which would many instantiate any one of these reference entity/lookup objects. However, this would break the application's ability to allow for new lookup tables to be added and discovered transparently and is just not quite as clean. Also, I could try deriving from an actual ReferenceEntity base class as opposed to an interface, but I am doubtful whether this would make any difference. The issue appears to be with using reflection created objects in the modelbinder. Any help is appreciated. Anthony
@CODE:System.Web.Mvc.ViewPage<MyNamespece.IReferenceEntity> AccountStatus a = new AccountStatus();

@TITLE:Sybase: Does the column order in a non-clustered index affect insert performance?
@CONTENT:To be more specific (since the general answer to the subject is likely "yes"): We have a table with lots of data in Sybase. One of the columns is "date of insertion" (DATE, datetime type). The clustered index on the table starts with the "DATE". Question: For another, non-clustered index, does the order of columns (more specifically, whether "DATE" is the first or a second index column) affect the insert query performance? Assume everything else is equal, e.g. the order of the second non-clustered index does not affect select query performance (even if it does, I don't care for the purposes of this question).

@TITLE:Does having several indices all starting with the same columns negatively affect Sybase optimizer speed or accuracy?
@CONTENT:We have a table with, say, 5 indices (one clustered). Question: will it somehow negatively affect optimizer performance - either speed or accuracy of index picks - if all 5 indices start with the same exact field? (all other things being equal). It was suggested by someone at the company that it may have detrimental effect on performance, and thus one of the indices needs to have the first two fields switched. I would prefer to avoid change if it is not necessary, since they didn't back up their assertion with any facts/reasoning, but the guy is senior and smart enough that I'm inclined to seriously consider what he suggests. NOTE1: The basic answer "tailor the index to the where clauses and overall queries" is not going to help me - the index that would be changed is a covered index for the only query using it and thus the order of the fields in it would not affect the IO amount. I have asked a separate SO question just to confirm that assertion. NOTE2: That field is a date when the records are inserted, and the table is pretty big, if this matters. It has data for ~100 days, about equal # of rows per date, and the first index is a clustered index starting with that date field.

@TITLE:gles 2.0 perfomance on iphone simulator, iphone, macbook pro
@CONTENT:I did an wave animation to explore features of sgx chip which is tile-based rendering (TBR) architecture by comparing the performance on iphone and laptop. An advantage of TBR architecture is it allows the GPU to perform hidden surface removal before fragments are processed, so I draw many overlaped layers of animated waves, and only the wave in the top layer is visible. I did this program on both iphone 3gs (using gles 2.0) and my laptop, a macbook pro(using opengl 2.0). I recorded the fps numbers of different layers, and I assume trends of fps changes on iphone and laptop are different. I guess the performance's decreasing of iphone should be slower than on laptop, when the number of layers is increased. But they have very similar trends. I have 2 questions. 1. why it doesn't show the advantage of TBR architecture, while there are alot of overlapped triangles 2. why the performance of iphone simulator is much much much much slower than just running on laptop(without simulator)? As documentations say the simulator does not enforce the memory limitations of MBX and SGX and take the advantage of laptop's CPU, i guess its performance should keep up with the laptop. anyone can help? thanks alot

@TITLE:How do I prevent a one pixel border in variable height UITableViewCell from coming out as multiple pixels?
@CONTENT:In my test app, I want to style variable height table cells with a single pixel line at the top. This is the drawing code that I'm using, but it doesn't work. Below is the code for the header: // In OneLine.h
@interface OneLine : UIView {}
@end
 And the drawing code: // In OneLine.m
- (void)drawRect:(CGRect)rect {
    // Drawing code
    [[UIColor blackColor] set];
    UIRectFill(rect);
    [[UIColor whiteColor] set];
    UIRectFill(CGRectMake(rect.origin.x, rect.origin.y, rect.size.width, 1));
}
- (id)initWithFrame:(CGRect)frame {
    if (self = [super initWithFrame:frame]) {
        // Initialization code
        self.contentMode = UIViewContentModeTop;
    }
    return self;
}
 The only problem is that I end up with a white line of variable height. It's not always one pixel tall. What am I doing wrong? I have a table view controller used to supply test cells. I initialize it like this: // In MyTable.h
#import <UIKit/UIKit.h>

@interface MyTable : UITableViewController {
    NSMutableArray *data;
}
@end
 With the code (only the added/changed methods from the default template). // In MyTable.m
#import "MyTable.h"
#import "OneLine.h

@implementation MyTable
- (id)initWithStyle:(UITableViewStyle)style {
    if (self = [super initWithStyle:style]) {
        srand(time(NULL));
        data = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];
        for (size_t index = 0; index < 200; ++index) {
            // Each cell has a different height betweet 40 and 50 pixels tall.
            [data addObject:[NSNumber numberWithInt:(rand() % 10) + 40.5]];
        }
    }
    return self;
}

- (UITableViewCell *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath {
    UITableViewCell *cell = [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:@"Cell"];
    if (cell == nil) {
        cell = [[[UITableViewCell alloc] initWithStyle:UITableViewCellStyleDefault reuseIdentifier:@"Cell"] autorelease];
        cell.contentView.contentMode = UIViewContentModeTop;
        OneLine *view = [[OneLine alloc] initWithFrame:cell.contentView.bounds];
        [cell.contentView addSubview:view];
    }

    // Set up the cell...
    OneLine *view = [cell.contentView.subviews objectAtIndex:[cell.contentView.subviews count] - 1];
    // Build the correct frame
    view.frame = CGRectMake(0, 0, cell.contentView.bounds.size.width, [MyTable tableView:(UITableView*)self.view heightForRowAtIndexPath:indexPath]);
    return cell;
}

- (NSInteger)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView numberOfRowsInSection:(NSInteger)section {
    return [data count];
}

- (CGFloat)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView heightForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath {
    NSNumber *num = (NSNumber*) [data objectAtIndex:indexPath.row];
    return [num intValue];
}
@end
 All of this code just creates a table view controller with 200 cells of random height (between 40 and 50 pixels tall.
@CODE:// In OneLine.h
@interface OneLine : UIView {}

@CONTENT:MySQL saves all changes to the database in a binary file called binary log. MySQL provides a decoder called mysqlbinlog to decode these files. I thought if I wanted to parse this log file directly from an application then I need to find a way to decode it myself using C# for instance. I know if I had the privilege I could use SHOW BINLOG EVENTS. However, parsing the file would be a better solution for me. Has any of you done that before? Any suggestions?

@CONTENT:I'm trying to host two WCF services in one application. I want them to share the same BaseAddress but have their own URLs something like: net.tcp://localhost:1234/service1 and net.tcp://localhost:1234/service2 The following config allows me to do that: <system.serviceModel>
    <services>
        <service name="VanillaWcf.Shared.MyService" behaviorConfiguration="beh">
            <endpoint address="myservice" binding="netTcpBinding" name="tcpEndPoint" contract="VanillaWcf.Shared.IMyService" />
            <endpoint address="myservice" binding="wsHttpBinding" name="httpEndPoint" contract="VanillaWcf.Shared.IMyService"/>
            <host>
                <baseAddresses>
                    <add baseAddress="net.tcp://localhost:1234" />
                </baseAddresses>
            </host>
        </service>
        <service name="VanillaWcf.Shared.SecondService" behaviorConfiguration="beh">
            <endpoint address="secondService" binding="netTcpBinding" name="tcpEndPoint" contract="VanillaWcf.Shared.ISecondService"/>
            <endpoint address="secondService" binding="wsHttpBinding" name="httpEndPoint" contract="VanillaWcf.Shared.ISecondService"/>
            <host>
                <baseAddresses>
                    <add baseAddress="net.tcp://localhost:1234"/>
                </baseAddresses>

            </behavior>
        </serviceBehaviors>
    </behaviors>
</system.serviceModel>
 And the code is:         ServiceHost host = new ServiceHost(typeof(MyService));
        ServiceHost secondHost = new ServiceHost(typeof(SecondService));

        host.Open();
        secondHost.Open();
 This works fine. However, I get an exception when I add http://localhost:4321 as the base address of both services in the config. The exception is: The ChannelDispatcher at 'http://localhost:4321/' with contract(s) '"IHttpGetHelpPageAndMetadataContract"' is unable to open its IChannelListene' with an inner exception of A registration already exists for URI 'http://localhost:4321 I don't have any MEX configuration and I don't want it.

@TITLE:MvcContrib GridModel : Is it possible to do ActionSyntax in a GridModel
@CONTENT:I have a code in my aspx file which uses ActionSyntax, and i want to use a GridModel instead, but i don't know how to do that. Here is a sample of my aspx file : <% Html.Grid(ViewData.Model).Columns(column => {
   column.For(x => x.Id).Named("N¢X de contrat");
   column.For(x => x.SubscriptionDate).Format("{0:d}").Named("Date de souscription");
   column.For(x => x.SubscriptionOrigin).Named("Source");
   column.For(x => x.Agent).Named("Agence(*)");
   column.For(x => x.Agent).Named("Agent");
   column.For(x => x.Subscriber).Named("Souscripteur");
   column.For(x => x.ProductTitle).Named("Produit");
   column.For(x => x.NbBeneficiaries).Named("Nombre de b?n?ficiaires");
   column.For(x => x.Price).Named("Montant du contrat");
   column.For("PDF").Named("").Action(p => {%> <td><img src="../Content/Images/pdf.gif" /></td> <%});
   column.For("Mail").Named("").Action(p => {%> <td><img src="../Content/Images/mail.gif" /></td> <%});
   column.For("Attestation").Named("").Action(p => {%> <td><img src="../Content/Images/attestation.gif" /></td> <%});
   column.For("Poubelle").Named("").Action(p => {%> <td><img src="../Content/Images/poubelle.png" /></td> <%});
   }).Attributes(id => "subList").Render(); %>
 And i'd like to do : <%= Html.Grid(ViewData.Model).WithModel(new MyGridModel()) %>
 But i don't know how to render this ActionSyntax part in a .cs file :  column.For("PDF").Named("").Action(p => {%> <td><img src="../Content/Images/pdf.gif" /></td> <%});
 column.For("Mail").Named("").Action(p => {%> <td><img src="../Content/Images/mail.gif" /></td> <%});
 column.For("Attestation").Named("").Action(p => {%> <td><img src="../Content/Images/attestation.gif" /></td> <%});
 column.For("Poubelle").Named("").Action(p => {%> <td><img src="../Content/Images/poubelle.png" /></td> <%});
 Someone have any idea ? Thanks.

@TITLE:Don't understand jquery - setting equal height contained divs
@CONTENT:I am trying to set two side-by-side divs contained by a single larger div to equal column height. I am trying to use the following jquery script: <script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">

        function pageLoad() {	        
            $(document).ready(function() {
                setEqualHeight($(".instructionsParent > div"));
            });    
        }

        function setEqualHeight(columns) {
            var tallestColumn = 0;

            columns.each(function() {
                currentHeight = $(this).height();
                if(currentHeight > tallestColumn) {
                    tallestColumn = currentHeight;
                }
            });
            columns.height(tallestColumn);
        }
</script>
 Then the following are my DIV's: <div class="instructionsParent borderDiv borderTable0" style="overflow:hidden">
    <div class="instructionsLeft" style="float:left;width:49.5%">
  </div>	
  <div class="instructionsRight" style="float:right;width:49.5%">
  </div>
</div>
 The jquery is running and appears to be returning the largest height (451), but doesn't seem to apply it to the two divs. I don't know much jquery or javascript and don't understand the following: "setEqualHeight($(".instructionsParent > div"));" Could it be that I have that coded incorrectly?

                                            If the transfer fails because your computer shut down from a power-outage, there may be a temporary file left on your

                                            If you tend to get hit by electric power outages more often than normal, we recommend that you purchase a battery-backup UPS
                                            (Uninterruptible Power Supply) that has at least 1500VA capacity so that the computer AND your modem AND router can remain
                                            powered-up for several hours when the power goes out.&nbsp;&nbsp;Start the download before going to bed, and TURN OFF the monitor
                                            during that process, so that the UPS would not have to feed it if a power outage hits.</strong>

                                            a while, then if you want to resume the download from where you left off, be sure to HIBERNATE your machine rather than
                                            doing a simple shutdown.  You can set this up from Control Panel > Power Options > Hibernate Tab.  There will be a button
                                            on your keyboard somewhere that activates hibernation (sometimes called "sleep").  It takes a complete "RAM snapshot" of
                                            what is going on, so that the next time you start the computer, it resumes exactly where it left off (it may take a few

                                            (Uninterruptible Power Supply) that has at least 1500VA capacity so that the computer AND your modem AND router can remain
                                            powered-up for several hours when the power goes out.&nbsp;&nbsp;Start the download before going to bed, and TURN OFF the monitor
                                            during that process, so that the UPS would not have to feed it if a power outage hits.</strong>

                                            a while, then if you want to resume the download from where you left off, be sure to HIBERNATE your machine rather than
                                            doing a simple shutdown.  You can set this up from Control Panel > Power Options > Hibernate Tab.  There will be a button
                                            on your keyboard somewhere that activates hibernation (sometimes called "sleep").  It takes a complete "RAM snapshot" of

@TITLE:jquery/javascript alert if all fields are not completed
@CONTENT:I have a form which I'd like to alert people if ALL of the fields aren't completed. I am currently using a jquery validation script for the required fields, but I need it to also let people know that not all of the fields are filled out before saving (they're not required fields, but just to let them know that the form isn't finished). The form fields are: type, status, rating, cterms, companyid, company, name, surname, address, suburb, city, state, country, pcode, phone, email and comments If someone could help me out with this, that'd be great, I dont mind if it's with jquery or javascript, just something that will alert that not all of the fields are completed and if they want to continue with the save or not. Cheers Leanne EDIT: Here's the form: <form action="/index.php?option=com_database&view=add&Itemid=3&task=save" method="post" name="adminForm" id="adminForm">

@TITLE:Wordpress and jquery
@CONTENT:I have never messed with wordpress much and am real stuck. I am trying to add a video playlist/gallery via jquery. Not a wordpress plugin. I am not even sure what I am doing wrong and am hoping someone could help me through it please. The site is here, http://okaysewwhat.com/ it is just a skeleton now since this does not work yet. The jquery plugin I am using is this, http://www.geckonewmedia.com/blog/2009/8/14/jquery-youtube-playlist-plugin---youtubeplaylist Ok so I have inside the header.php of wordpress, added this to call the stylesheet for the youtube part, <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="all" href="<?phpbloginfo('stylesheet_url'); ?>/youtube.css" />
 then after that is this part, you can see what I added, 	<?php


		wp_enqueue_script("jquery");

		if ( is_singular() ) wp_enqueue_script( 'comment-reply' );



		wp_head(); 

		global $options;
		foreach ($options as $value) {
			 if (get_settings( $value['id'] ) === FALSE) { $$value['id'] = $value['std']; } else { $$value['id'] = get_settings( $value['id'] ); }
		}
	?>

<script src="<?php bloginfo('template_directory'); ?>/jquery.youtubeplaylist.js" type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"></script>


<script type="text/ecmascript">
jQuery.noConflict();

	$(function() {
		$("ul.demo2").ytplaylist({addThumbs:true, autoPlay: false, holderId: 'ytvideo2'});
	});

</script>
 Inside index.php I added, right under the wordpress main_col div, <?php include (TEMPLATEPATH . '/tube.php'); ?>
 and all that is in tube.php is the list of vids, <code>

@TITLE:How do I dump the .NET process so that Visual Studio 2008 will load it as a managed dump?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to create a minidump of the managed process, which would be loadable into Visual Studio 2008. I'm using following code to create a minidump: ...
MINIDUMP_TYPE dumpType =  static_cast< MINIDUMP_TYPE >(
  MiniDumpWithFullMemory |  MiniDumpWithDataSegs | MiniDumpWithHandleData |
  MiniDumpWithProcessThreadData | MiniDumpWithPrivateReadWriteMemory );
BOOL bSuccess = MiniDumpWriteDump(
  hProcess, dwProcessID, hFile, dumpType, NULL, NULL, NULL );
...
 I tried a lot of other combinations of MINIDUMP_TYPE, but none yielded me what I wanted: to be able to load dump file into Visual Studio, so that a managed code shows up, the way it does when you "attach to process". Dump file is getting loaded and I can use it as a native code. But when I try to debug it as managed code ( http://vvcap.net/db/gkqmlA9qbQIK47-patap.htp ), I'm receiving following error: "The specified file is an unrecognized or unsupported binary format" ( http://vvcap.net/db/lw5cEvSMl3yiiHRkt87R.htp )

@LINK:/questions/1454455/event-driven-client-server-design-with-c
@TITLE:Event-Driven Client/Server Design with C++
@CONTENT:I am designing a game server with scripting capabilities. The general design goes like this: Client connects to Server,
Server initializes Client,
Server sends Client to EventManager (separate thread, uses libevent),
EventManager receives receive Event from Client socket,
Client manages what it received via callbacks.
 Now the last part is what's the most tricky for me now. Currently my design allows me for a class which inherits Client to create callbacks to specific received events. These callbacks are managed in a list and the received buffer goes through a parsing process each time something is received. If the buffer is valid, the callback is called where it is act upon what is in the buffer. One thing to note is that the callbacks can go down to the scripting engine, at which point nothing is sure what can happen. Each time a callback finishes, the current receive buffer has to be reset etc. Callbacks currently have no capability of returning a value, because as stated before, anything can happen. What happens is that when somewhere in the callback something says this->disconnect(), I want to immediately disconnect the Client, remove it from the EventManager, and lastly remove it from the Server, where it also should get finally destructed and free memory. However, I still have some Code running after the callback finishes in the Client, thus I can't free memory. What should I change in the design? Should I have some timed event in the Server which checks which Clients are free to destroy? Would that create additional overhead I don't need? Would it still be okay after the callback finishes to run minimal code on the stack (return -1;) or not? I have no idea what to do, but I am open for complete design revamps. Thanks in advance.

@TITLE:permissions aware (icon) action links for all models: how?
@CONTENT:I have several models, for which I want to show some common icons for action links (new, details, edit, delete) and some specific ones for certain models only; these iconlinks must only be showed when the user has permission to perform the action. Permissions are decided by roles, but I'd like to abstract them, so that the explicit needed roles are written in one place only. I'd also like to use the same logic to show icons and to "protect" action methods, so that if Foo role used to be needed to edit lolcatz, and now I want to change it to Bar role, I only have to change one thing. There are many ways to implement this, and I'm unsure on how to proceed. I could write a ModelAction class, responsible for deciding permissions, link, icon, text for a single action, and some ModelActionsCollection to gather all possible actions for a single model, so that I can write a parent class and several descending ones. My doubts: how should I associate models with ModelActionsCollection? Should I use a hash or some static class, like SomeStaticClass.GetModelActionsCollection(someModel)? or typeof(someModel), or "className" or what? how should I decorate methods? should I write something like: [MyAuthorize("action", "model")]
public ActionResult action(...)
 or something else? is it okay to access to the current authenticated user directly inside these classes' methods, or should they receive user as parameter? what namespace this classes belong to? are they models? helpers? or what? and, finally: has anybody already done all this in a reusable way?

@LINK:/questions/1452205/why-cant-i-use-an-iteration-variable-in-a-loginview
@TITLE:Why can't I use an iteration variable in a LoginView?
@CONTENT:I am building a .NET MVC app that has a page with a list of delete buttons, one for each item in a list. The problem I'm having is that the foreach variable "item" is not visible inside the LoginView, which results in the following error: Compiler Error Message: CS0103: The name 'item' does not exist in the current context Below is a simplified version of the view. The error occurs at the "new {id=item.Id}" in the LoggedInTemplate - the reference to "item" in the ActionLink works fine: <% foreach (var item in Model) { %>

  <%= Html.ActionLink("Item", "Details", new { id = item.Id })%>

  <asp:LoginView runat="server">
      <LoggedInTemplate>
          <% using( Html.BeginForm( "Delete", "Items", new {id=item.Id}, FormMethod.Post)) 
          { %>
               <input type="submit" value="Delete" runat="server" />
          <% } %>
      </LoggedInTemplate>
  </asp:LoginView>
<% } %>
 To clarify the problem is not that the Model has not been successfully passed to the View. The Model is visible from both inside and outside the LoginView. The foreach loop as no problem in iterating through the items in the Model (which is a List). The problem is that the iteration variable "item" is not accessible from within the LoginView - though the original Model is. Is there any way to pass "item" through to the LoginView's templates? Or is building LoginViews within a foreach loops the wrong way of doing things? Is there a scoping rule that prevents using local variables within controls - perhaps because the control is rendered at a different time to the main page?
@CODE:<% foreach (var item in Model) { %>

  <%= Html.ActionLink("Item", "Details", new { id = item.Id })%>

  <asp:LoginView runat="server">
      <LoggedInTemplate>
          <% using( Html.BeginForm( "Delete", "Items", new {id=item.Id}, FormMethod.Post))

Williamson   Mark     81
Thompson     Mark     100
Anderson     John     76
Turner       Dennis   56 The program accepts a command-line argument for which column to sort on, and should print out the sorted strings unmodified. I would like to use strtok to break up copies of each string into columns, and make structs for each line like this: struct line {
    char * line;
    char column_to_sort_on[MAX_COLUMN];
}
 My problem is in the comparison function pointer that qsort takes as an arg. If I understand correctly, the comparison function must take two const void pointers _to the items to be sorted_, and return an int. This means I can't pass pointers to structs into the comparison function because that is not what qsort will be sorting. I can't pass in the column number to sort on to the comparison function, because it can only take two args. How can I get around this to sort these strings based on specific columns? edit: Sorting is limited to qsort or my own if I really want. Give the choice, I choose qsort. :) edit # 2:The consensus seems to be either use a global variable for the column number, or just use qsort to sort an array of structs. I hadn't thought of just sorting the structs, and using the pointer in them to print out the original string. I think that is what I will do. Thanks for the help all!

@CONTENT:using Subsonic v3.0.0.3 with MS SQL 2008 (10.0.2531) and have two columns in a table 'Date' and 'Time' (not DateTime columns) and when the ActiveRecord SingleOrDefault (line 14110) attempts to load the object (via a given pkid) this error is thrown; "Object of type 'System.TimeSpan' cannot be converted to type 'System.String'."

I'm sure it sounded like a nice idea, but in practice I find it very annoying - your code jumps around as you try to make the edits to fix the error. I know you can collapse the error message by clicking the marker icon in the left margin, but I'd prefer not to have them appear directly in my code at all. Is there any way to disable this feature?

@CONTENT:It appears that, in the transition between the Android 1.1 sdk and 1.5, Google radically changed how ant scripts using AAPT can build Android projects. Previously they support args allowing developers to specify source, res, asset, and a manifest for a particular build. Now, they seem to allow developers to specify only a single folder containing everything. While I could rewrite all our build scripts to work in this new way, I rather like our current system (as it doesn't require more hours of work that I don't have). To that end, has anyone figured out how to go back to the pre 1.5 method of ant script building? Further, has anyone found a rational reason for this change?

@TITLE:Programicatlly visit (all) ASP.Net page(s) in a website?
@CONTENT:In the Security model for out ASP.Net website (.Net 3.5) we store the page name: page.GetType().Name as the primary key in a database table to be able to lookup if a user has access to a certain page. The first time a page is visited this record is created automatically in the database. We have exported these database statements to insert scripts, but each time a new page gets created we have to update the scripts, not a huge issue, but I would like to find an automated way to do this. I created an attribute that I tagged a few pages with and then wrote a small process to get all the objects that have this attribute, through the reflection create an instance and insert the record using the same code to for page records mentioned above: IEnumerable<Type> viewsecurityPages = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().GetTypes().Where(t => t.IsDefined(typeof(ViewSecurityAttribute),false));

            foreach (Type t in viewsecurityPages)
            {
                object obj = Activator.CreateInstance(t, false);

           //clip..(This code just checks if the record already exists in the DB)

                if (feature == null)
                {

                    Attribute attb = Attribute.GetCustomAttribute(t, typeof(ViewSecurityAttribute));

                    if (attb != null)
                    {
                        CreateSecurableFeatureForPage((Page)obj, uow, attb.ToString());
                    }

                }

            }
 The issue is that page.GetType().Name when the page goes through the actual page cycle process is something like this: search_accounts_aspx but when I used the activator method above it returns: Accounts So the records don't match the in the security table. Is there anyway to programtically "visit" a webpage so that it goes through the actual page lifecycle and I would get back the correct value from the Name parameter? Any help/reference will be greatly appreciated.
@CODE:IEnumerable<Type> viewsecurityPages = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().GetTypes().Where(t => t.IsDefined(typeof(ViewSecurityAttribute),false));

            foreach (Type t in viewsecurityPages)

And I tried to use Linq (with c# and Linq2Sql, looks like it feels more SQL-like with VB.Net), I feel it is very frustrating, you cannot just run your query without compiling and executing the code. I am not so great with IQueryable, IEnumarable, IList etc. And I have my doubts about why would you use Linq when you are a pro SQL user. But I need some kind of O/RM so I can write my test codes, and I like using POCOs rather than datasets. So considering everyone in my team is also some degree of SQL Expert (mostly MS SQL and hence T-SQL), and enjoying database programming, which O/RM you would recommmend. (Commercial or OpenSource does not matter, good support, tutorials and documentation is a must) Our Development Environment will be C#, ASP.Net MVC along with ExtJS. We have a little more than 1000 tables on our application that we are going to migrate. You would not believe how much code is generated on it by ADO.Net Entity Framework.

On top of this are 8 buttons in various places along the view/image, when one of the buttons is selected i update 'xPoint' and call the below to update what's on screen (between 400-600px movement each time a button gets clicked in 1-2 seconds duration): -(void)moveView:(NSNumber *)duration{
    [UIView beginAnimations:nil context:NULL];{

@TITLE:What's the maximum memory footprint in MB for an typical iPhone app?
@CONTENT:I know this is a subjective question. As far as I know, there are somewhat about 25 MB available for the app, but it depends on what else is going on. Currently playing music, a current phone call or what ever might drop that amount of memory down a lot. I don't know. Just tell us what you think, or what you have experienced. My app currently consumes about 15 MB at a time, mostly lots of images loaded into views for animation. I have encountered no problems with this. But is there some "border" that can be drawn, to make a simple-to-follow rule like "do not consume more than x MB of memory at any given time", where x stands for the max amount?

@CONTENT:Similar problems have been dealt with before but I believe mine's slightly different owing to the use of the bind() function. Anyhow... $('.overlay').bind("mouseenter",function(){

}).bind("mouseleave",function(){    			
  setTimeout(function() { 
    $(this).fadeTo('slow', 1);

});
 I want to fade out the overlay on "mouseenter", but only fade it back in 2000ms after "mouseleave". I have an additional question: When the .overlay div fades out, I need to be able to click on what's beneath it i.e. I need the div to disappear completely or move down the z-index stack. However, if I try adding this in, the script thinks the mouse has left the .overlay div, so the .overlay fades back in. For the same reason I can't use fadeOut() and fadeIn().
@CODE:$('.overlay').bind("mouseenter",function(){
  $(this).fadeTo('slow', 0);
}).bind("mouseleave",function(){    			
  setTimeout(function() {

 and the second application (is in C#) opens the file and writes to it. I use: byte[] b = ... //have a binary data
System.IO.BinaryWriter bw = new System.IO.BinaryWriter(

I checked in the application and it writes wrong 8 bytes. I want to add that the first 8 bytes are 2 counters that each was created using IPAddressHostToNetworkAddress.

I'm having trouble with my texture combiner code (I already tried monkeying with it) and was wondering if anyone can spot the problem: glActiveTexture(GL_TEXTURE0);
glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, geometryP->texName);
glTexCoordPointer(2, GL_BYTE, 0, geometryP->texCoordsP);

glActiveTexture(GL_TEXTURE1);
glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, mGradientTextureName);
glTexCoordPointer(2, GL_BYTE, 0, geometryP->texCoordsP);
glTexEnvi(GL_TEXTURE_ENV, GL_TEXTURE_ENV_MODE, GL_COMBINE);

@CONTENT:These are MY symptoms: (XP Pro, 32bit) -Programs that access .mdb databases (aside from Access 2007 itself) can not get any data. -Using the Data Sources in Visual Studio 2008 to connect to an MDB shows tables, but you can not query. you receive "Unknown Error" from the Microsoft JET Database Engine -ArcCatalog can not read a personal geodatabase (mdb), after opening the database it has no feature classes within it -Trying to bring up the properties of a User DSN "MS Access Database" in the ODBC Data Source Administrator returns error "The setup routines for the Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb, *.accdb) ODBC driver could not be found. Please reinstall the driver." I attempted to reinstall latest MDAC (by setting it to compatibility mode of windows 2000) and latest JET driver. Reinstalled XP SP3. Also tried a lot of regsvr32 gymnastics with the dao350.dll and dao360.dll, uninstalled the dao350, etc, etc. Nothing worked.

@TITLE:sIFR not working with prototype AJAX page load
@CONTENT:I have a website with two pages. A and B. When you click on a link in page A, it will uses the Prototype Ajax.Updater() to load the link page (page B) into a div on the page (Page A). When page B loads into page A, the sIFR replacements are not working and the tag inner text is not even showing. I have tried doing a sIFR.redraw() when the page has loaded into the div, with no success. When i view page B in the browser by itself, it works perfectly. Is it possible to insert HTML into a DIV tag on a page using AJAX and have the sIFR display properly?

@TITLE:Why isn't my custom formatResult function called using the jQuery autoComplete plugin?
@CONTENT:I'm using the autocomplete jQuery plugin (api doc) that calls a service which returns json. I have the plugin consuming the json result fine and everything works, execpt my custom formatResult function is never called. I'd like to use that function to capture the user selecting from the result list to populate various other fields on the page. $(document).ready(function() {
    $("#vendorname").autocomplete("/Vendor/Search", {
        dataType: 'json',
        parse: function(data) {
            var rows = new Array();
            for (var i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
                rows[i] = { data: data[i], value: data[i].Name, result: data[i].Name };
            }
            return rows;
        },
        formatItem: function(row, i, n) {
            return row.RepName + ' (' + row.VendorId + ')';
        },
        formatResult: function(row, i, n) {
            return '(formatResult) ' + row.Name;
        },
        width: 200,
        mustMatch: false,
        scroll: true,
        scrollHeight: 300
    });
});
 The json string returned from the service is (two Vendor objects) [{"VendorId":1,"Name":"abc","RepName":"rep of abc","Phone":null,"Email":null,"Notes":null,"Version":null,"Fax":null,"ProductQuotes":[],"PurchaseOrders":[]},{"VendorId":2,"Name":"def","RepName":"rep of def","Phone":null,"Email":null,"Notes":null,"Version":null,"Fax":null,"ProductQuotes":[],"PurchaseOrders":[]}]
 So, 1) Why is formatResult is never hit? 2) Is there a better way to grab the object properties once a user selected an item from the results?

    $("#vendorname").autocomplete("/Vendor/Search", {

                rows[i] = { data: data[i], value: data[i].Name, result: data[i].Name };
            }
            return rows;
        },
        formatItem: function(row, i, n) {
            return row.RepName + ' (' + row.VendorId + ')';
        },
        formatResult: function(row, i, n) {
            return '(formatResult) ' + row.Name;

@TITLE:ASPX page renders differently when reached on intranet vs. internet?
@CONTENT:This is so odd to me.. I have IIS 5 running on XP and it's hosting a small ASP.Net app for our LAN that we can access by using the computer name, virtual directory, and page name (http://matt/smallapp/customers.aspx), but you can also hit that IIS server and page from the internet because I have a public IP that my firewall routes to the "Matt" computer (like http://213.202.3.88/smallapp/customers.aspx [just a made-up IP]). Don't worry, I have Windows domain authentication is in place to protect the app from anonymous users. So all the abovea parts works fine. But what's weird is that the Border of the divs on the page are rendered much thicker when you access the page from the intranet, versus the internet, (I'm using IE8) and also, some of the div layout (stretching and such) acts differently. Why would it render different in the same browser based on whether it was reached from the LAN vs. the internet? It does NOT do this in FireFox. So it must be just an IE8 thing. All the CSS for the divs is right in the HTML page, so I do not think it is a caching matter of a CSS file. Notice how the borders are different in these two images: Internet: http://twitpic.com/hxx91 . Lan: http://twitpic.com/hxxtv

@TITLE:Is this a good or bad way of generating random numbers for each record?
@CONTENT:A colleague of mine discovered a behaviour in SQL Server which I was unaware of. CREATE VIEW dbo.vRandNumber AS
SELECT RAND() as RandNumber
GO

CREATE FUNCTION dbo.RandNumber() RETURNS float AS
RETURN (SELECT RandNumber FROM vRandNumber)
GO

DECLARE @mytable TABLE (id INT)
INSERT INTO @mytable SELECT 1
INSERT INTO @mytable SELECT 2
INSERT INTO @mytable SELECT 3

SELECT *, dbo.RandNumber() FROM @mytable
 This seems to be the quickest way of generating a 'random' value for each record in a data set. But I'm not completely sure if it's a result of documented behaviour, or taking advantage of a bizarre convergance of coincidences. Would you use something like this? EDIT This isn't a question about the merits of the RAND() function itself, but the use of the UDF/VIEW combination to force it to recalculate on every row. (Using just RAND() in the final query, instead of dbo.RandNumber(), would give the same value for every record.) Also, the point is for the value to be different every time you look at it. So enabling random selection of records, for example. EDIT For SQL Server 2000+.
@CODE:CREATE VIEW dbo.vRandNumber AS
SELECT RAND() as RandNumber
GO

CREATE FUNCTION dbo.RandNumber() RETURNS float AS
RETURN (SELECT RandNumber FROM vRandNumber)

@TITLE:Actionscript 3: Queuing up FLVs using netstatus and cuepoints
@CONTENT:I'm building a flash site that uses video transitions to go from section to section. Each section's background is a still-frame photo at higher res than the transition videos themselves, which are scaled up during transition. The first frame of each video transition is the current background image, and the last frame of each video transition is the destination's background image. Roughly speaking, this is the intended flow of navigation on the site: Resting state: hi-res image in foreground, no video elements User clicks item on navigation: Flash prepares an FLV via a netstream object and buffers it, which is accomplished through the netstream.play() function. Upon receipt of the "Netstatus.Buffer.Full" event, the netstream object is paused and attached to a video object, which is then added to the display list behind the hi-res image in the foreground. As soon as the video object has been added to the stage, the hi-res image in the foreground alphas out (via tween), leaving only the background video. When the foreground is finished tweening, the video in the background plays. As soon as "NetStream.Play.Stop" is received, the process happens in reverse; that is, a new hi-res foreground image tweens in over the video layer, and the video is removed from the stage as soon as that's done. I don't think there's anything wrong (at least in principle) with the flow I've outlined above, and it doesn't sound like it should be that tricky to do. However, I've had no end of problems with the initial setting up of the FLV/video object. At first, it seemed that the FLV wasn't queuing up properly, by which I mean that the hi-res foreground image tweened out to reveal a white screen, and the video popped in and only began playing after a second or two. (The first frame of the FLV is definitely not white). I had no idea what might have been causing this behavior, but hackishly threw in a timer that plays the netstream for about 100 ms after "Buffer.Full" is received, thereby advancing the video past whatever might have been causing the white screen. This worked well locally but as soon as I put the site on a dev host, it was back to the white screen during transitions. The annoying thing is that bumping the hackish delay up to about 2 s got rid of the white screen problem on remote servers, but results were unpredictable; depending on connection speed, you might see everything work perfectly, or you might get thrown into a video that had already been playing for a second or two. I've also tried similar approaches using bytesLoaded/bytesTotal instead of netStatus events, to no avail. My last experiment was using cuepoints; during FLV encoding, I threw in a cuepoint 0.2 seconds into the FLV and waited for THAT before tweening out the foreground; once again, it worked locally, but I was treated to a tween-to-white before the video kicked in when testing on a remote server. I'm really running out of ideas here and would very much appreciate any advice you guys can offer. Thanks very much for your time and consideration! Justin

@CONTENT:We are working on a web service that has to run a 3rd party process that interacts with a mapped network drive. So we have to map this drive programmatically from the web service. I have already wrapped up WNetAddConnection2, etc. in a nicer class for another project, so I threw the code right in. Our web service is running under UltiDev Cassini (instead of IIS) which runs under the System account. We get the error code for: "the specified device name is invalid" every time. I also tried impersonating other users in the web.config file, with the same results. The drive will map just fine when I run my code from a console program under a normal user account. I have also tried running the equivalent "net use" command from C# with the exact same results as WNetAddConnection. Does anyone know why a windows service or System user wouldn't be able to map network drives? Does anyone know a workaround? Simply mapping the drive on system startup would be a solution, but how could the system/impersonated user access it?

@TITLE:How do I save matched parts of a regex in Perl?
@CONTENT:I want to sort out all APIs in the following text file: DLL Name: msvcrt.dll
...
DLL Name: msvcrt.dll
...
DLL Name: KERNEL32.dll
...
DLL Name: WSOCK32.DLL
 I thought of something like $infostring = lc($infostring);
while ($infostring =~ /dll name:/g)
{
 print "found dll\n";
}
 the only problem is, how to get the actual dll names or at least the position of the found string?
@CODE:DLL Name: msvcrt.dll
...
DLL Name: msvcrt.dll

DLL Name: KERNEL32.dll

@TITLE:Reverse a single chained List
@CONTENT:I hope I am using the right terminology. I have made a single-chained list. class MyStack
{
    public Node Initial { get; set; }

    public MyStack()
    {
        Initial = null;
    }

    public void Push(int data)
    {
        var node = new Node { Data = data, Next = Initial };
        Initial = node;
    }

    public int Pop()
    {
        int res = Initial.Data;
        Initial = Initial.Next;
        return res;
    }

    public int Sum()
    {
        int sum = 0;
        Node currentNode = Initial;
        while (currentNode != null)
        {
            sum += currentNode.Data;
            currentNode = currentNode.Next;
        }
        return sum;
    }
    public int Count()
    {
        int count = 0;
        Node currentNode = Initial;
        while (currentNode != null)
        {
            count++;
            currentNode = currentNode.Next;
        }
        return count;
    }

    public void PrintAll()
    {     
        Node currentNode = Initial;
        while(currentNode != null)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("tmp.Data = " + currentNode.Data);
            currentNode = currentNode.Next;
        }
    }
}
public class Node
{
    public int Data;
    public Node Next;
}
 Meaning you can do something like this:     var s = new MyStack();
    s.Push(5);
    s.Push(3);
    s.Push(7);
    s.PrintAll();
    Console.WriteLine("Sum: " + s.Sum());
    Console.WriteLine("Count: " + s.Count());
 Now, I want to try and make a Reverse method. This seems to be working: public void Reverse()
{
    Node predesesor, location;
    location = Initial;
    predesesor = null;
    while(Initial != null)
    {
        Initial = Initial.Next;
        location.Next = predesesor;
        predesesor = location;
        location = Initial;
    }
    Initial = predesesor;
}
 I am hardly able to see how it works, and it will be tough to maintain. It seems more like a hack than anything else. Can you offer any assistance?
@CODE:class MyStack
{
    public Node Initial { get; set; }

    public MyStack()
    {
        Initial = null;
    }

    {
        var node = new Node { Data = data, Next = Initial };
        Initial = node;
    }

    public int Pop()
    {
        int res = Initial.Data;
        Initial = Initial.Next;
        return res;
    }

    public int Sum()
    {
        int sum = 0;
        Node currentNode = Initial;
        while (currentNode != null)
        {

            currentNode = currentNode.Next;
        }
        return sum;
    }
    public int Count()

@TITLE:Java: DBunitils + Spring: Different Hibernate-Dialect
@CONTENT:I currently use spring for depency injection. Hibernate uses a postgres dialect for the normal run, but I want to use HSQL for the DBUnitils Databank-Testing. My Spring-Configuration contains this: <!-- Hibernate session factory -->

 The fields get replaced by maven resource-filtering. The Spring-Configruation for DBUnitils contains this: <bean id="dataSource" class="org.unitils.database.UnitilsDataSourceFactoryBean"/>
</beans>
 and so overrides the dataSource from my run configuration with the UnitilsDataSource. The Problem: I cant run the Tests using Postgres-Dialect against the HSQL-Test-Database because some commands dont work. The only solution which came to my mind: Switching the resource-filter in maven, but I have to do this by hand (by provining a "-P TEST" on every maven call). So isn't there a possibilty to override the hibernate.dialect? Thanks!

@LINK:/questions/1431975/sql-server-clr-stored-procedure-json-parameter
@TITLE:SQL Server CLR Stored Procedure JSON Parameter
@CONTENT:I've come across a scenario where I want to pass a large amount of data to a Stored Procedure for generating some dynamic SQL. The data I want to pass is stored in this Json/C# class object that I use in my ASP.NET MVC web project. [
 {
  "code":"ABC123",
  "Count": "12998",
  "Params":
  [
    {"name": "Recent", "value": "0-12m"},
    {"name": "Orders", "value": "1"}
  ]
 },
 {
  "code":"ABC124",
  "Count": "13998",
  "Params":
  [
   {"name": "Recent", "value": "0-12m"},
   {"name": "Orders", "value": "2"}
  ]
 },
 {
  "code":"ABC125",
  "Count": "7998",
  "Params":
  [
   {"name": "Recent", "value": "0-12m"},
   {"name": "Orders", "value": "3"}
  ]
 }
]
.....
 Then use this text parameter to convert back to a JSON object, I use this in an action filter to convert it to an object. public class ObjectFilter : ActionFilterAttribute
{

    public string Param { get; set; }

    public Type RootType { get; set; }

    public override void OnActionExecuting(ActionExecutingContext filterContext)
    {

        if ((filterContext.HttpContext.Request.ContentType ?? string.Empty).Contains("application/json"))
        {

            object o =

            new DataContractJsonSerializer(RootType).ReadObject(filterContext.HttpContext.Request.InputStream);
            filterContext.HttpContext.Request.InputStream.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin); // Rewind InputStream for other filters

            filterContext.ActionParameters[Param] = o;

        }

        else
        {

            var xmlRoot = XElement.Load(new StreamReader(filterContext.HttpContext.Request.InputStream,

            filterContext.HttpContext.Request.ContentEncoding));

            object o = new XmlSerializer(RootType).Deserialize(xmlRoot.CreateReader());

            filterContext.ActionParameters[Param] = o;

        }

    }
 } and then use C# etc in my CLR Stored Procedure to create a SQL statement such as: UPDATE [Sample]
SET [Field] =
CASE
WHEN [Recent] = "0-12m" AND [Orders] = "1" THEN "ABC123"
WHEN [Recent] = "0-12m" AND [Orders] = "2" THEN "ABC124"
WHEN [Recent] = "0-12m" AND [Orders] = "3" THEN "ABC125"
...
 Is this possible and has anyone ever done anything like this. I've seen a few posts on using a XML parameter but none using a varchar parameter using de-serialized (?) json.
@CODE:[
 {
  "code":"ABC123",
  "Count": "12998",

  [
    {"name": "Recent", "value": "0-12m"},

        if ((filterContext.HttpContext.Request.ContentType ?? string.Empty).Contains("application/json"))

            object o =

@TITLE:Create print-ready PDF/X (with bleedbox, trimbox, mediabox, etc) programatically?
@CONTENT:I was wondering if it is possible to programaticaly create a PDF file with an acceptable quality for the production press, ideally using only open-source libraries. Right now the process is like this: -create texts and images -merge them into a postscript file -use Acrobat Distiller to convert it to PDF (Acrobat distiller helps you check all the parameters of the PDF) -send the PDF to the press What I want is something like: -take all texts and pictures in this folder -encode them into the press-ready PDF, something similar to what Distiller produces -send them to the press How would you do that? Many thanks...

@TITLE:Strange behavior in PHP mail function, address does not exist
@CONTENT:I recently had this issue with a client. The code read: ini_set( "sendmail_from", "noreply@<current-domain>.com" );

// $target_email has been validated as a value username.
// $subject is a simple String.
// $message is an HTML message.
mail( $target_email, $subject, $message );
 When I tested this on my machine, it worked fine. When I tested it at home, at work, on Windows 2000 (IE6), XP (four different machines, and a VirtualBox instance) (IE6 & 7, Opera 9, Firefox 3), and Vista (IE 7), as well as through Konquerer and Firefox on Ubuntu (on two different machines), it worked fine (I don't have a Mac). I had tried the website on four different networks and in three different counties. I did everything I could to break this site, and I received no error, and the email came from noreply@<current-domain>.com to the expected address promptly. When my client tested it at his office he got an SMTP error, saying that the name noreply@<current-domain>.com does not exist and he did not receive the email. But the same lines work fine when running on my server (basic LAMP set up running PHP 5.3, they have Windows 5.2.6). What, exactly, happened? My best guess was that this is some bizarre windows server issue, I don't have the foggiest what else it could be. Unfortunately, I was not able to see how they configured their local machines to test this theory.
@CODE:ini_set( "sendmail_from", "noreply@<current-domain>.com" );

// $target_email has been validated as a value username.
// $subject is a simple String.
// $message is an HTML message.
mail( $target_email, $subject, $message );

@TITLE:Change link destination based on whether user has mac or PC
@CONTENT:Is it possible to change the destination of a link based on whether the user has a mac or a PC using javascript? To give an example: The Apple website allows download of Quicktime but it "knows" whether you are using a mac or a pc and directs you to the relevant page. Background/Reason for doing this: I have built a website for someone and they have a number of audio and video files on there. Ideally they want it so that if the user is on a mac it will download a quicktime version of the file but if they are on a PC it will download a Windows Media Player file. Cheers CHRIS

@TITLE:Getting CPU time in OS X
@CONTENT:I have an objective-c application for OS X that compares two sqlite DB's and produces a diff in json format. The db are quite large (10,000 items with many fields). Sometimes this applications runs in about 55 sec(using 95% of the cpu). Sometimes it takes around 8 min (using 12% of the cpu). This is with the same DB's. When it is only using a small portion of the cpu the rest is available. There does not appear to be anything taking priority over the process. Adding "nice -20" on the command seems to assure I get the cpu usage. My questions are If nothing else is using the cpu why does my app not take advantage of it? Is there something I can do programatically to change this? Is there something I can do to OS X to change this?

@TITLE:Why is element.style.left returning NaN?
@CONTENT:I'm getting a weird error where in Internet Explorer 7, when I call Math.round on a float it gives me an "Invalid Argument" error. Consider the following: var elementLeft = parseInt(element.style.left); // Here we're actually getting NaN
function Foo(x) {
  this.x = x;

  this.apply = function(element) {
    element.style.left = Math.round(this.x) + 'px';
  };
}
Foo(elementLeft);
 In this case x is a non-negative number and element is just a DOM element in my page (a div, in fact). Any ideas? EDIT: The variable passed in as the x parameter is actually initialized earlier as parseInt(element.style.left). It appears that the first time I try to read element.style.left, IE is actually giving back NaN. I have updated the code to reflect this. Anyone know any workarounds for this?
@CODE:var elementLeft = parseInt(element.style.left); // Here we're actually getting NaN

@TITLE:WCF / Silverlight Call Back to Server Fails in IIS
@CONTENT:Using Silverlight 3, Windows XP, IIS 5.1, I've written a small app which uses the channel method of calling the server rather than the 'add service reference' as per this MSFT article. The application opens and the call to the server work when running it on the development computer in VS 2008 using the address localhost plus the port number. When I change the address to the computer name, dellnov2006, and publish the application to IIS, the application opens, but the call to the web service does not work. Watching the call in Web Dev Helper, I see that the app was trying to call the service file, http://dellnov2006/Service1.svc, and is getting a 404 error. So far, I've: -In IIS mapped the .svc type to aspnet-isapi.dll -Run the utility CleanIISScriptMaps -Run aspnet_regiis.exe -i ¡Venable Any help would be appreciated - I am running out of ideas on this. -- Here is the call back to the server, and the contents of the Service1.svc file:  private void Button_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
    {
      // create a custom binding that uses HTTP and binary encoding
      var elements = new List<BindingElement>();
      elements.Add(new BinaryMessageEncodingBindingElement());
      elements.Add(new HttpTransportBindingElement());
      var binding = new CustomBinding(elements);

      // create a channel factory for the service endpoint configured
      //   with custom binding

      //var cf = new ChannelFactory<IService1>(binding,
      //   new EndpointAddress("http://localhost:1042/Service1.svc"));

      var cf = new ChannelFactory<IService1>(binding,
         new EndpointAddress("http://dellnov2006/Service1.svc"));

      // save the syncronized context for the ui thread
      uiThead = SynchronizationContext.Current;

      // open the channel
      IService1 channel = cf.CreateChannel();

      // invoke the method asychrnoously
      channel.BeginGetPerson(4, GetPersonCallback, channel);
    }
 Here are the contents of the svc file for what they are worth: <%@ ServiceHost Language="C#" Debug="true" Service="SilverlightChannelApp1.Web.Service1" CodeBehind="Service1.svc.cs" %>

Previous answers have told me this is possible using a single script file, which loops forever. Is this possible using only a PHP/Perl/Python hosting service? or would I need a VPS or shell access? Any help is appreciated since I've never worked with sockets before. Thanks for your time.

@TITLE:Popup extender ¡§frozen¡¨ on code-behind exception
@CONTENT:In a C#/ASP.NET project, we're using an ajax modalpopupextender to display a "Processing..." message to the users. We're displaying it using a Javascript call in the code of the ASP.NET page. Then, in the code behind, we're doing some database operation, and hide again the popup using "popup.hide();" The problem is that when an exception occurs in the code behind, the popup is still displayed and the application does not handle errors as per the "customErrors" tag of the web.config. Any idea on how to deal with this kind of issues? Thanks, David

@TITLE:Can't diagnose my MySQL root user problem
@CONTENT:I have a problem with the MySQL root user in My MySQL setup, and I just can't for the life of me work out how to fix it. It seems that I have somehow messed up the root user, and my access to databases is now very erratic. For reference, I'm using MAMP on OS X to provide the MySQL server. I'm not sure how much that matters though - I'd guess that whatever I've done will require a command-line fix to solve it. I can start MySQL using MAMP as usual, and access databases using the 'standard' users I have created for my PHP apps. However, the root user, which I use in my MySQL GUI client, and also in phpMyAdmin, can only access the "information_schema" database, as well as two I have created manually, and presumably (and mistakenly) left permissions wide open for. My 15 or so other databases cannot be accessed my the root user. When I load up phpMyAdmin, the home screen says: "Create new database: No Privileges". I certainly did at some stage change my root user's password using the MAMP dialog. But I don't remember if I did anything else which might have caused this problem. I've tried changing the password again, and there seems to be no change in the issue. I've also tried resetting root password using the command line, including starting mysql manually with --skip-grant-tables then flushing privs, but again, nothing seems to fix the issue. I've come to the end of my ideas, and would very much appreciate some step-by-step advice and diagnosis from one of the experts here! Many thanks for your help.

@CONTENT:I am changing from MySQL to PostgreSQL but can't find equivalent to MySQL's collation utf8_general_ci. What I'm trying to achieve here is to be able to compare strings using general language rules rather then binary comparison, i.e. ? = i, ? = s, ? = h, etc... Is there a way how to make PostgreSQL search for strings using general language rules? Many thanks!

@CONTENT:I have a DataTable and a List of objects. I need to return all rows in the DataTable where a property in the List is a certain value. The List is only used for filtering the datatable (but the filter column isn't containined in the datatable). I'm sure this must be possible with LINQ.

@CONTENT:I have a page (May even use a handler), anyway.. that is awaiting an HTTP POST with a number of variables including an image encoded as a multipart/form-data Content Type. How do I save the image from the HTTP Post? This image encoded int the HTTP POST is from another site and is not from a local FileUpload Control.

@TITLE:Program crashes when releases UIImage after generating OpenGL ES texture
@CONTENT:Right now, I have followed this tutorial: http://iphonedevelopment.blogspot.com/2009/05/opengl-es-from-ground-up-part-6%5F25.html It does not work if I tried to release UIImage: I will get a 'EXC_BAD_ACCESS'. Now, I made the UIImage to be instance variables and retain them. I do not make it autorelease. But the problem is sometimes I want to delete my texture. I need to release those UIImage or else I will have a leak. (The Performance Tool Leaks report that UIImage causes leaks) But if I release UIImage, I will get EXC_BAD_ACCESS. And I am not even drawing them or accessing them anywhere at all. The program just crashes right at where it got release: #0  0x30011940 in objc_msgSend ()

@TITLE:Excel Range Format: Number is automatically formatted when Range::Value2 is set
@CONTENT:I have an Excel addin written in C# that imports a text file into Excel worksheet. Some of the fields in the file are text and some oare numbers. Problem Steps: Change the System's Regional Settings to Dutch (Belgium) Open Excel and import the file into Excel. Records contain values such as 78,1118 which gets converted to 781.118. Note that in Dutch(Belgium), COMMA is the decimal character and DOT is the thousand character. I do not require the number to be formatted automatically but just want to display whatver I get from the file (78,1118). If I set the cell's NumberFormat to "@" i.e. Text, then it displays an error (SmartTag) saying "Number stored as Text". I know I can change the settings by going to the "Options" box but I dont want to change any user options in Excel for this. I have tried setting the cell's Value2 with an "'" (apostrophe) but the same error is displayed. If I set the cell's format to something else after the value is set then the actual value changes and I loose the decimal. Is there a way in Excel to just display the value and NOT display the "Number Stored as Text" error in cell?

@LINK:/questions/1408023/find-guid-in-database
@TITLE:Find GUID in database
@CONTENT:I am currently working on a project where some (significant) data corruption has occurred. Specifically the database is using GUIDs as primary keys on most tables, however it is not enforcing data integrity between those tables (due to a long-winded "this was bought from another company and integrated with our stuff" discussion). There is an effort underway to introduce referential integrity, however the data has to be cleaned up before that is possible. Part of this data corruption is that different entity keys have been switched or inserted into incorrect columns. For example a valid "ProductId" value exists in a "CustomerId" field due to the software inserting the wrong key in the wrong column. This was happening for months in the database before the issue was finally caught (during a data aggregation job) and now the cleanup effort is rather large. What I'm wondering is if there is a way of finding a GUID in a database. Rather, if I have a GUID that I think is a primary key in some table, is there a way in T-SQL of asking for matches to any known uniqueidentifier key column? I know the GUID I have isn't a CustomerId, but it might be another primary key id from some other table. Up to now the team have been searching the other tables manually for matches to the rogue GUIDs to see if they can find out the "type" of the key. They've even gone as far as to create scripts with lots of "select * from [table] where [tableId] = @rogueGUID" statements that search the known entity tables for a match. However, this approach isn't very efficient. I'm looking for this script not only for this project but also because I think a "Does this GUID exist as a primary key value anywhere in this database?" type of query would be a useful asset in a development toolbox. Any help is appreciated.

@CONTENT:I have images within an excel file, that I need to manually extract. I have written a program which functions very well for our users with Excel 2007, but will not work with Excel 2003. Process: User Opens Excel File, Copies Relevant Image to Clipboard User Opens C# Application, Clicks Button Which Gathers Image from Clipboard, and then gathers additional information from the user. The application code is pretty simple. On button click, the following code is called:             if (Clipboard.GetImage() != null)
            {
                pictureBox1.Width = Clipboard.GetImage().Width;

                //...more misc. code...
            }
 This works flawlessly with Excel 2007, but does not function with Excel 2003. I have attempted the following debug code, all which fails: Clipboard.ContainsImage() >> returns false Clipboard.GetDataObject().GetDataPresent(DataFormats.Bitmap) >> false One thought would be that the Excel 2003 "Office Clipboard" may be interfering?

 I figured out that if I create the session without the interceptor the SaveOrUpdate works fine, but with the interceptor it errors. with the interceptor:  public ISession GetSession(ISessionFactory factory)
        {
            IInterceptor dataBinding = new DataBindingInterceptor {SessionFactory = factory};
            return factory.OpenSession(dataBinding);

 without  public ISession GetSession(ISessionFactory factory)
        {
            return factory.OpenSession();
        }
 I'm at a loss for how to go about even figuring out why the interceptor would break the save. The only change I made to the code was changing the line Type type = Type.GetType(clazz); to Type type = FindType(clazz); public Type FindType(string typeName)
{

@CONTENT:I'm trying to restore the state of my multi-tabbed iPhone application. There are more than 5 tabs, each with it's own navigation controller. On applicationDidFinishLaunching, I determine which was the last tab the user was on and set it with myTabController.selectedIndex = persistedTabIndex; I then call a function on that tab's root view controller to restore itself. The problem is, if the tab has been moved to the "More" page, the view has not been loaded and the call disappears into NIL land. Is there a way to force the view controller in question to load it's view? Many thanks in advance for your consideration and responses.

@TITLE:How to declare a non-string element as having optional content in XML Schema
@CONTENT:I have seen XML Schema element with attributes containing only text but I have an element that's an xs:dateTime instead. The document I'm trying to write a schema for looks like this: <web-campaigns>
  <web-campaign>
    <id>1231</id>
    <start-at nil="true"/>
  </web-campaign>

    <id>1232</id>
    <start-at>2009-08-08T09:00:00Z</start-at>
  </web-campaign>
</web-campaigns>
 Sometimes the xs:dateTime element has content, sometimes it doesn't. What I have so far (which doesn't validate yet) is: <xs:element name="start-at">
  <xs:complexType mixed="true">
    <xs:simpleContent>
      <xs:extension base="xs:dateTime">

      </xs:extension>
    </xs:simpleContent>
  </xs:complexType>
</xs:element>
 If I replace xs:dateTime with xs:string, I can validate the document just fine, but I really want an xs:dateTime, to indicate to consumers what's in that element. I tried with/without mixed="true" as well, to no avail. If it makes a difference, I validate using xmllint (on Mac OS X 10.5) and XML Schema Validator

I want to copy those dates for each task to several other projects (001, 002 in the example data). So, if task 001 in project 000 has a date of 10/28/09, I want task 001 in other projects (I know their IDs) to have the same date. If task 002 in project 001 has date 12/1/09, I want task 002 to have this date in each of the other projects as well. Is there one query that can do this?

I've managed to create two groups, but Zend Form seems to balk at letting me create a group containing a group. Should I be able to do this? Here's a simple code example, assuming I have created elem1, elem2 and elem3. $form->addDisplayGroup(array('elem1'), 'group1', array("legend" => "Wrapped element"));
$form->addDisplayGroup(array('group1', 'elem2', 'elem3'), 'group2', array("legend" => "All elements"));
@CODE:$form->addDisplayGroup(array('elem1'), 'group1', array("legend" => "Wrapped element"));
$form->addDisplayGroup(array('group1', 'elem2', 'elem3'), 'group2', array("legend" => "All elements"));

@TITLE:Changing one table seems to change the other
@CONTENT:I'm writing a lua script, and one of the things it does is copy a table into a table of tables, and apply a couple transformations to it.

@TITLE:jquery lightbox plugin while images are loaded via ajax
@CONTENT:I have a page where I am loading bunch of images initially when the page loads. These images are tied to the lightbox plugin and when i click on the images..the plugin does do what it is supposed to. However, I have some ajax added via jquery (triggered by a drop down box) which updates the list of images based on what it gets from the server. After the list of images is reloaded the lightbox plugin does not seem to work anymore. Does anyone know if something special needs to be done? Following is the code in my html page (this works): <div id="gallery">

 from the server I will be getting back a JSON object that has bunch of values separated by commas like: [{images: 'cfil132,cfil542,cfil341'}]
 In my html, when page initially loads (before call to serverside), I am displaying some images like so: <ul>
   <li>
       <a> <img height="72" width="72" alt="" src="thumb_image1.jpg"/></a>
   </li>
   <li>
      <a><img height="72" width="72" alt="" src="thumb_image2.jpg"/></a>
   </li>
</ul
 I want to know whether it is possible to update the images on my html page with the json object I get back. So for this example, after I trigger the request to the server I will have the following html code instead of the above. <ul>
   <li>
       <a> <img height="72" width="72" alt="" src="cfil132.jpg"/></a>

   </li>
   <li>
      <a><img height="72" width="72" alt="" src="cfil341.jpg"/></a>
   </li>
</ul>
 I have no idea how to do this. Note: values coming in the json object are dynamic, in this case they are 3 but could be 4 5 or more...

  jQuery("select#rooms").change(function(){
    var options = '';

@TITLE:WCF timing out intermittently
@CONTENT:All, I have a WCF service that times out intermittently, usually after about ten or twelve requests from the asp.net client. The service uses reflection to find classes in its assembly (WAP dll) that have a custom attribute set. The process itself is very quick, usually taking only a few milliseconds, and when it works, it works great. Setting a breakpoint in the calling code and in the service itself tells me that the timeout is occurring between the call from the WCF client proxy class and when that method is actually executed. Ideas? Update: binding, etc from web.config: <system.serviceModel>

@TITLE:Best way to calculate Max/Min of N columns in SQL Server
@CONTENT:Ok, firstly I've seen this thread. But none of the solutions are very satisfactory. The nominated answer looks like NULLs would break it, and the highest-rated answer looks nasty to maintain. So I was wondering about something like the following : CREATE FUNCTION GetMaxDates
(
    @dte1 datetime,
    @dte2 datetime,
    @dte3 datetime,
    @dte4 datetime,
    @dte5 datetime
)
RETURNS datetime
AS
BEGIN
    RETURN (SELECT Max(TheDate)
    	FROM
    	(
    		SELECT @dte1 AS TheDate
    		UNION ALL
    		SELECT @dte2 AS TheDate
    		UNION ALL
    		SELECT @dte3 AS TheDate
    		UNION ALL
    		SELECT @dte4 AS TheDate
    		UNION ALL
    		SELECT @dte5 AS TheDate) AS Dates
    	)
END
GO
 Main problems I see are that if there are only 3 fields to compare, you'd still have to specify NULL for the other 2, and if you wanted to extend it to six comparisons it would break existing use. If it was a parameterized stored procedure you could specify a default for each parameter, and adding new parameters wouldn't break existing references. The same method could also obviously be extended to other datatypes or stuff like Min or Avg. Is there some major drawback to this that I'm not spotting? Note that this function works whether some, all or none of the values passed to it are nulls or duplicates.
@CODE:CREATE FUNCTION GetMaxDates
(
    @dte1 datetime,
    @dte2 datetime,
    @dte3 datetime,
    @dte4 datetime,
    @dte5 datetime
)

BEGIN
    RETURN (SELECT Max(TheDate)

@TITLE:How to stop a web control from loading child controls?
@CONTENT:This is for ASP.NET. Think about the multiview control. It has 1 to many view controls. Each view control has the ability of holding controls, but, yet, only one view is visible at a time. Keeping that in mind, I'm thinking I want to "tell" the non-visible views to NOT LOAD, therefore, NOT LOADING the child controls. In my sample, during the view's load, I check to see if it is the active view. If it is not active, then I stop processing the load. Unfortunately, views that are not active still have their load event run and all the controls in the control tree run their load. Back to the question: Is there a way to stop the child controls from running for the view that is not active? Code Sample: Private Sub viewDisplayArticle_Load(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles viewDisplayArticle.Load

  If Not mvwHealthArticles.ActiveViewIndex = mvwHealthArticlesView.DisplayArticle Then Exit Sub

  callSomeKillerMethod()

I dont think i really need to use the table Widgets for this but i described it so you would know where im coming from. I have constructed a "Totals" query that uses the MAX() function and displays the single most recent Date for each ID. I then can use this query to construct another query that displays useful information about the test that happened on that date for that widget.

I want the user to be able to hit those keys when the app is open and have it execute my function, but not while the app is closed. Thanks for the help!

@TITLE:Pushing untracked content with git
@CONTENT:I have a project in git with a bunch of graphics (.jpg, .png, .tiff, etc). The graphics extensions are in my .gitignore (this can change) because I do not need to version the graphics (the department responsible for graphics has version cue and tracks their own changes to the graphics). However, when I push, it seems only the tracked content gets to the repository. I need the graphics to be pushed with the repository, but I do not want to track the graphics files, how would I do this (or is it even possible)?

@TITLE:Replacing Word's Open File Dialog in a COM Add-in
@CONTENT:I'm writing a Word COM Add-in that replaces the Open & Save dialogs with my own. For the save dialog, I'm handling the documentBeforeSave event from the application events. This works fine. For the open dialog, there is no such event, so I'm currently handling the onClick of the Open... menu item, canceling the default handling. This works ok if the user indeed uses this menu item, but if the user presses CTRL-O in stead they still get the original dialog. Is there a better way to hook into this dialog? And if there isn't, is there a way to elegantly handle this keypress, or should I resolve to keyboard hooks? Note: The add-in should eventually work on Office 2003, 2007 and 2010, but using different code-paths on different targets is of course perfectly fine. I am interested in any solutions on any version.

@CONTENT:I have been developing an ASP.NET application on Windows XP Professional. While promoting to production I have only now found out that the server is 64 bit. I installed Oracle Client 32 bit on the server and cannot connect to Oracle. I am using the Microsoft Provider for Oracle, and my question is, how do I get an ASP.NET application compiled on a 32 bit machine to connect to Oracle on a Windows Server 2003 64 bit machine? EDIT: In response to a comment on my original question, the error I am getting is "Attempt to load Oracle client libraries threw BadImageFormatException. This problem will occur when running in 64 bit mode with the 32 bit Oracle client components installed" I have uninstalled the 32 bit client and am getting the 64 bit client installed, the problem is that the server is a production server in a DMZ and I have no access to the server myself, so I am trying to anticipate any problems I will have when the 64 bit client is installed and I try to access the ASP.NET application on the server

@CONTENT:Is there a smart way to - from a browser - open hrefs to text files and XML files in an external program. My target platform is Win32 so preferably I'd have the files open in the default editor for it (as set in explorer.exe). The solution must work in Firefox. It's a bonus if it works in IE and Crome. My html is generated from a local developer database for files on disk. I.e. hrefs look like this: file://c:/a/b/c.ext. Currently, Firefox and IE show their built-in XML viewer, and god knows what Chrome is showing (looks like random XML excerpts to me). I don't know if this is of any relevance, but all hrefs are of type <map><area href/></map> (over an image) and not just simple <a href/>s. Edit: is it possible in Javascript, anyone?

@TITLE:WPF XAML Markup Compiler generates a bad URL in InitializeComponent()
@CONTENT:Hey All, So I'm integrating WPF into a Windows Forms application I've built. One of the big hurdles I'm running into is that when the Markup compiler generates the .g.cs files in the background, the InitializeComponent method is being generated incorrectly. Here's what's generated: System.Uri resourceLocater = new System.Uri("/MapWorksheet;V9.9..0;component/controls/geoworksheetcon" + "trol.xaml", System.UriKind.Relative); What's incorrect is the version section of the URI descriptor. This will work by either removing it or correcting the version (9.9.0.0 in this case). I tried to change the version a bit to debug this (to 9.9.1.2), but this didn't affect the output of the tool. I did delete the Obj directory first, so I know that this file was created fresh. I'm looking for a way to correct this, currently I have to manually edit the .g.cs files to get this to work properly. Oh, and I'm also using MSBuild and VS2008. Thanks in advance, Chris

@TITLE:XML Serialization vs Reflection in C#
@CONTENT:XML Serialization from MSDN: Serializes and deserializes objects into and from XML documents. The XmlSerializer enables you to control how objects are encoded into XML. Reflection from MSDN Reflection provides objects (of type Type) that encapsulate assemblies, modules and types. You can use reflection to dynamically create an instance of a type, bind the type to an existing object, or get the type from an existing object and invoke its methods or access its fields and properties. If you are using attributes in your code, Reflection enables you to access them. As far as my understanding goes, I could create objects in run time using XML Serialization? In other words, let's say I have a database, I could define my "classes" or "objects" in couple of tables. I could then get the XML for the object's data and then create the object at run-time. I could also already have those objects compiled as libraries readily available and then use Reflection to access it's functions. From your understanding, which one of these two concepts would grant the most flexibility while sacrificing the least performance? Bonus points if you can provide a detailed explanation with considerations and perhaps a sample of code.

@TITLE:Dreamweaver Recordset Default Value (PHP) - How to Return All Records?
@CONTENT:Greetings! Although I am working in Dreamweaver, this question may be general enough for PHP/MySQL experts to comment on. $colname_get_voice_search_men = "-1";
if (isset($_POST['search_type'])) {
  $colname_get_voice_search_men = $_POST['search_type'];
}
mysql_select_db($database_conn_talent, $conn_talent);
$query_get_voice_search_men = sprintf("SELECT * FROM view_voice_search_men WHERE voice_type_id = %s", GetSQLValueString($colname_get_voice_search_men, "int"));
$get_voice_search_men = mysql_query($query_get_voice_search_men, $conn_talent) or die(mysql_error());
$row_get_voice_search_men = mysql_fetch_assoc($get_voice_search_men);
$totalRows_get_voice_search_men = mysql_num_rows($get_voice_search_men);
 Dreamweaver sets the default value to "-1" to ensure no records are returned by default. However, I want all records to be returned by default. So, I naturally changed $colname_get_voice_search_men = "-1"
 to $colname_get_voice_search_men != "-1"
 But this doesn't change the results, which is no records are returned. I've also tried > "0" but no joy. Your feedback is greatly appreciated. Thanks.
@CODE:$colname_get_voice_search_men = "-1";
if (isset($_POST['search_type'])) {
  $colname_get_voice_search_men = $_POST['search_type'];
}
mysql_select_db($database_conn_talent, $conn_talent);
$query_get_voice_search_men = sprintf("SELECT * FROM view_voice_search_men WHERE voice_type_id = %s", GetSQLValueString($colname_get_voice_search_men, "int"));
$get_voice_search_men = mysql_query($query_get_voice_search_men, $conn_talent) or die(mysql_error());

    }
  }
 The HttpPost contains the ContractUser object. Upon the postback I am left with nothing, the contractUser object no longer exists, which I find rather odd. FetchNonCIStaffByUser(int) brings back a ContractUser object (which works). The delete page shows information from this object, so I know the initial entry works, it's just the postback if there's an error, no information is displayed from the ContractUser object. Any ideas why this is happening? I'd have expected the contractUser object to be returned to the view. FIXED  <%= Html.Hidden("FullName", Model.FullName) %>
 <%= Html.Hidden("User_Key", Model.User_Key) %>
 Neither fields were actually being put in form elements in the page so nothing was being posted back. Good to know.
@CODE:public ActionResult DeleteNonCIStaffUser(int id)
  {
    return View(_contractsControlRepository.FetchNonCIStaffUserByID(id));
  }

@LINK:/questions/1388210/php-using-a-drop-down-list-to-change-site-theme
@TITLE:PHP - Using a drop down list to change site theme
@CONTENT:I have a drop down list where users can select a theme for the site. The only problem is, I'm not quite sure how to properly load the theme once they press "Apply". I am new to PHP. I know if I use GET, it will pass the variables through a the current page and add them to the end of the URL. I would really like to avoid that. So, I guess my question is, how can I avoid using GET to update the theme? Thank you. Here is my code to load the correct theme: <?php
$stylesArr = array('Default', 'Black', 'Pink', 'Green', 'Red');
if(isset($_GET['theme']) && in_array($_GET['theme'], $stylesArr)) {
	$style = $_GET['theme'];
    setcookie("theme", $style, time()+(60*60*24*30));
} else {
    if(isset($_COOKIE['theme']) && in_array($_COOKIE['theme'], $stylesArr)) {
        $style = 'CSS/' . $_COOKIE['theme'] . '.css';
    } else {
        $style = 'CSS/Default.css';
    }
}
?>
 Here is my drop down list to select the theme: <form action="<?php echo $_SERVER["PHP_SELF"] ?>" method="post">
<p>Site Theme:
<select name="theme">
<option value="Default">Default</option>
<option value="Black">Black</option>
<option value="Pink">Pink</option>

} else {
    if(isset($_COOKIE['theme']) && in_array($_COOKIE['theme'], $stylesArr)) {
        $style = 'CSS/' . $_COOKIE['theme'] . '.css';
    } else {

@TITLE:Python: manipulating sub trees
@CONTENT:I'm a nooby. I'd like to acknowledge Allen Downey, Jeffrey Elkner and Chris Meyers and 'How to think like a computer scientist' for what I know. I'm building a genetics inspired program to generate equations that match some provided problem. The node class looks like this: class Node(object):
    '''
    '''
    def __init__(self, cargo, left=None, right=None):
        self.cargo = cargo
        self.left  = left
        self.right = right
        self.parent = None
        self.branch = None
        self.seq = 0

    def __str__(self):
        return str(self.cargo)

    def copy(self):
        return copy.deepcopy(self)
 I have a Tree class that contains an attribute: self.data which is a linked series of nodes forming a tree which I can traverse to produce an equation. To perform crossover, I'd like to be able to swap subtrees chosen at random from two instances of Tree. As self.data is being constructed, it builds a dictionary with a sequential key holding each node as a value. One such record looks like this:     3: <__main__.Node object at 0x0167B6B0>}
 I thought I'd be clever and simply choose a node each from two tree instances and exchange their respective parents node.left or node.right values. Each node records if it is a left or right in its node.branch attribute. I don't know how to reference self.data(subnode) to change it. And both tree instances would have to have access to each other's nodes by the address saved in the dictionary. I fear I shall have to copy and replace each subtree. Any comments would be appreciated. Thanks, Peter Stewart Nanaimo, Canada

@TITLE:Making Windows Forms controls read-only and IDisposable
@CONTENT:I want to make Windows Forms controls readonly and IDisposable. Is this is a good thing or a bad thing and what do I have to watch out for when calling Dispose? I have a Tab (PageTab) that I extend and insert a Panel which has a listview and another Toolbar control into. These tabs then get inserted into a tab control (all native .NET Windows Forms controls). When the user closes one of these tabs I call the Dispose method (which follows the MSDN way of implementing IDisposable). Is it wise or suggested to declare the controls as read-only (see below)? protected readonly ListView _AccountsList = new ListView();
protected readonly Panel _Panel = new Panel();
 Because in the Dispose method I just call _Panel.Dipose(), etc. on them, but I cannot set them to null. I want to avoid leaks as much as I can and have things garbage collected. What's the best way for a non-Designer GUI development and disposing them?

@TITLE:ASP .NET Development Server not serving everything all the time
@CONTENT:I'm using Visual Studio 2005 on a Windows XP SP3 machine and recently have come accross a some what strange issue. I have a C# and ASP.NET project that runs fine when on the team test server and using IIS locally on my own machine. However, running it using the in-built Visual Studio ASP.NET Development server it doesn't seem to serve all the images/scripts/css files all of the time. When I load a page one time images A, B and C will be missing and I may get a system (sub-package) error however loading it again all those images will be there and the sub-package will work but a CSS, a script or any other image file may be missing. The Windows event application log seems to show occasionally the missing files will be logged but this isn't consistent either.

@TITLE:Dreamweaver Recordset Default Value (PHP) - How to Return All Records?
@CONTENT:Greetings! Although I am working in Dreamweaver, this question may be general enough for PHP/MySQL experts to comment on. $colname_get_voice_search_men = "-1";
if (isset($_POST['search_type'])) {
  $colname_get_voice_search_men = $_POST['search_type'];
}
mysql_select_db($database_conn_talent, $conn_talent);
$query_get_voice_search_men = sprintf("SELECT * FROM view_voice_search_men WHERE voice_type_id = %s", GetSQLValueString($colname_get_voice_search_men, "int"));
$get_voice_search_men = mysql_query($query_get_voice_search_men, $conn_talent) or die(mysql_error());
$row_get_voice_search_men = mysql_fetch_assoc($get_voice_search_men);
$totalRows_get_voice_search_men = mysql_num_rows($get_voice_search_men);
 Dreamweaver sets the default value to "-1" to ensure no records are returned by default. However, I want all records to be returned by default. So, I naturally changed $colname_get_voice_search_men = "-1"
 to $colname_get_voice_search_men != "-1"
 But this doesn't change the results, which is no records are returned. I've also tried > "0" but no joy. Your feedback is greatly appreciated. Thanks.
@CODE:$colname_get_voice_search_men = "-1";
if (isset($_POST['search_type'])) {
  $colname_get_voice_search_men = $_POST['search_type'];
}

$query_get_voice_search_men = sprintf("SELECT * FROM view_voice_search_men WHERE voice_type_id = %s", GetSQLValueString($colname_get_voice_search_men, "int"));
$get_voice_search_men = mysql_query($query_get_voice_search_men, $conn_talent) or die(mysql_error());

@CONTENT:We have an application in BizTalk which has started to report errors. It seems to be related to maxItemsInObjectGraph, which for the Web application has been fixed by amending the CONFIG file. However it still fails in BizTalk. I was told i could configure the receive location in BitTalk and set it there? However i only seem to be able to increase the maximum received message size here, not the MaxitemsinGraph. I am new to BizTalk but any ideas would be greatly appreciated. Error reports as Error Description: System.ServiceModel.CommunicationException: An error occurred 
while  receiving the HTTP response to http://servername:8448/ServicePortal.Service/ApplicationServices.svc. This could be due to the service endpoint binding not using the HTTP protocol. This could also be due to an HTTP request context being aborted by the server (possibly due to the service shutting down).

@TITLE:Passing Object Back to View in HttpPost
@CONTENT:I'll make it simple, here's the code I've got.   public ActionResult DeleteNonCIStaffUser(int id)
  {
    return View(_contractsControlRepository.FetchNonCIStaffUserByID(id));
  }

  [HttpPost]
  public ActionResult DeleteNonCIStaffUser(ContractUser contractUser)
  {
    try
    {
      _contractsControlRepository.DeleteNonCIStaffUser(contractUser.User_Key);
      return RedirectToAction("NonCIStaffUsers"); // never reaches this as an exception is thrown!
    }
    catch
    {
      ViewData["ExceptionMessage"] = "Exception caught!";
      return View(contractUser); // I'm expecting this statement to return the ContractUser object instantiated with the same data as the GET action.
    }
  }
 The HttpPost contains the ContractUser object. Upon the postback I am left with nothing, the contractUser object no longer exists, which I find rather odd. FetchNonCIStaffByUser(int) brings back a ContractUser object (which works). The delete page shows information from this object, so I know the initial entry works, it's just the postback if there's an error, no information is displayed from the ContractUser object. Any ideas why this is happening? I'd have expected the contractUser object to be returned to the view. FIXED  <%= Html.Hidden("FullName", Model.FullName) %>
 <%= Html.Hidden("User_Key", Model.User_Key) %>
 Neither fields were actually being put in form elements in the page so nothing was being posted back. Good to know.

    return View(_contractsControlRepository.FetchNonCIStaffUserByID(id));

@TITLE:PHP - Using a drop down list to change site theme
@CONTENT:I have a drop down list where users can select a theme for the site. The only problem is, I'm not quite sure how to properly load the theme once they press "Apply". I am new to PHP. I know if I use GET, it will pass the variables through a the current page and add them to the end of the URL. I would really like to avoid that. So, I guess my question is, how can I avoid using GET to update the theme? Thank you. Here is my code to load the correct theme: <?php
$stylesArr = array('Default', 'Black', 'Pink', 'Green', 'Red');
if(isset($_GET['theme']) && in_array($_GET['theme'], $stylesArr)) {
	$style = $_GET['theme'];
    setcookie("theme", $style, time()+(60*60*24*30));
} else {
    if(isset($_COOKIE['theme']) && in_array($_COOKIE['theme'], $stylesArr)) {
        $style = 'CSS/' . $_COOKIE['theme'] . '.css';
    } else {
        $style = 'CSS/Default.css';
    }
}
?>
 Here is my drop down list to select the theme: <form action="<?php echo $_SERVER["PHP_SELF"] ?>" method="post">
<p>Site Theme:
<select name="theme">
<option value="Default">Default</option>
<option value="Black">Black</option>
<option value="Pink">Pink</option>

} else {
    if(isset($_COOKIE['theme']) && in_array($_COOKIE['theme'], $stylesArr)) {

@TITLE:Python: manipulating sub trees
@CONTENT:I'm a nooby. I'd like to acknowledge Allen Downey, Jeffrey Elkner and Chris Meyers and 'How to think like a computer scientist' for what I know. I'm building a genetics inspired program to generate equations that match some provided problem. The node class looks like this: class Node(object):
    '''
    '''
    def __init__(self, cargo, left=None, right=None):
        self.cargo = cargo
        self.left  = left
        self.right = right
        self.parent = None
        self.branch = None
        self.seq = 0

    def __str__(self):
        return str(self.cargo)

    def copy(self):
        return copy.deepcopy(self)
 I have a Tree class that contains an attribute: self.data which is a linked series of nodes forming a tree which I can traverse to produce an equation. To perform crossover, I'd like to be able to swap subtrees chosen at random from two instances of Tree. As self.data is being constructed, it builds a dictionary with a sequential key holding each node as a value. One such record looks like this:     3: <__main__.Node object at 0x0167B6B0>}
 I thought I'd be clever and simply choose a node each from two tree instances and exchange their respective parents node.left or node.right values. Each node records if it is a left or right in its node.branch attribute. I don't know how to reference self.data(subnode) to change it. And both tree instances would have to have access to each other's nodes by the address saved in the dictionary. I fear I shall have to copy and replace each subtree. Any comments would be appreciated. Thanks, Peter Stewart Nanaimo, Canada

@TITLE:Making Windows Forms controls read-only and IDisposable
@CONTENT:I want to make Windows Forms controls readonly and IDisposable. Is this is a good thing or a bad thing and what do I have to watch out for when calling Dispose? I have a Tab (PageTab) that I extend and insert a Panel which has a listview and another Toolbar control into. These tabs then get inserted into a tab control (all native .NET Windows Forms controls). When the user closes one of these tabs I call the Dispose method (which follows the MSDN way of implementing IDisposable). Is it wise or suggested to declare the controls as read-only (see below)? protected readonly ListView _AccountsList = new ListView();
protected readonly Panel _Panel = new Panel();
 Because in the Dispose method I just call _Panel.Dipose(), etc. on them, but I cannot set them to null. I want to avoid leaks as much as I can and have things garbage collected. What's the best way for a non-Designer GUI development and disposing them?

 I need to write some python to access this function that is in a DLL. I have loaded the DLL, but each of the double* is actually pointing to a variable number of doubles (an array), and I'm having trouble getting it to function properly. Thanks all!

@TITLE:Dynamically load .asmx web-service
@CONTENT:I have an .aspx page that can perform a number of functions. The type of function is determined at run-time depending on which button the user clicks. This makes makes a web-service call to an .asmx method. The web-service call returns html and javascript which then become part of the original page. This new content has javascript events attached to button clicks, data validation etc. In turn these events then call their own web-service methods in another .asmx file. The main page does not know about these other .asmx files when the page loads. So, is there any way of dynamically loading these .asmx files on demand?

@TITLE:Cancel scrolling in Layout Manager
@CONTENT:I can't find solution for the following problem. I have custom list field, which overlaps the boundaries of its layout manager. List field consumes navigation events from manager to highlight currently selected row with special color. Layout manager is configured to support scrolling. When I scroll trackwheel down, layout manager invokes scrolling and then passes navigation event to its child, the list field. It results in inproper scrolling, because manager scrolls the whole list down to its bottom hiding list rows on the top including the selected row. What I want is to ignore scrolling while currently selected list row is still visible and employ it otherwise. I'm using JDE 4.2.1

@TITLE:Why am I losing object references on the postback?
@CONTENT:I am developing an asp.net (3.5) application and I am puzzled with the behavior of the postbacks. Consider the following scenario: I have a web user control that is basically a form. However each form field is a web user control in itself. In the click event of the save button I iterate through all controls in my form and I retrieve the field value and the field name that refers to the database field that I am saving the value to. The click event triggers a postback and it is during the postback that I visit the controls and here is the funny thing: the property value for the database field has become null! Could anyone shed a light here? Here is some basic code: [Serializable]

However, running it using the in-built Visual Studio ASP.NET Development server it doesn't seem to serve all the images/scripts/css files all of the time. When I load a page one time images A, B and C will be missing and I may get a system (sub-package) error however loading it again all those images will be there and the sub-package will work but a CSS, a script or any other image file may be missing. The Windows event application log seems to show occasionally the missing files will be logged but this isn't consistent either.

@CONTENT:Banging my head today ;) Over here I asked about translating an ASM file to C, and from the responses it looked like there was no reasonable way to do it. Fine. So one of the responses suggested I just make use of the functions as-is and be done with it. Sounds good. But how? Holy crap I've tried everything I can think of! I'm using a Microchip brand MCU (PIC18F4480) and a Microchip brand IDE (MPLAB IDE) and the ASM files are Microchip authored... so you'd think I'd find some way of making use of them! So far no luck at all. I don't know anything about ASM (Assembly). I code in C++ and frankly that's not going to change. There has got to be a way to access the functions in the Microchip ASM files without rewriting all my code in a new language. If anyone wants to take a look, the ASM files and application notes are here.

@CONTENT:the "problem" is that I do have an ASP.NET TextBox in a FormView with its Text property bound to a database table field. In some cases, there might be HTML-code combined with normal text in the database. The RequestEncoding and ResponseEncoding is set to "iso-8859-1" (whitch is latin1). There are some fields where latin1-characters and cyrillic characters may be combined. This is no problem when typing in cyrillic characters (e.g "?"). Because the RequestEncoding is set to iso-8859-1 and the charset for the browser as well, the browser will change ? to "&#1076;", which will be saved in the database. That's what I want, but because "&#1076;" will be converted to "&amp;#1076;" when set to an ASP.NET TextBox's Text-property before the response output is sent to the browser, I do see "&#1076;" after saving the data. Can anybody tell me how to stop ASP.NET from that conversion?

@TITLE:RoleManager.WriteToLog in Azure Development Fabric
@CONTENT:I'm just taking my first steps with Azure and the first thing I see in the development fabric is a bunch of console style logging windows. So I figure that's going to be handy and decide to figure out how to write stuff there and stumble upon this: Microsoft.ServiceHosting.ServiceRuntime.RoleManager.WriteToLog("Information", "Message);
 Cool, except I don't see anything in the log. Saw a post somewhere that after first install you need to reboot before this will work, so I tried that but still nothing. I've checked with a break point that the code is executing and I've checked the logging level in the dev fabric. Is this supposed to work, or am I completely off base? Just to add some more information about what I'm doing: Started with VS08's new project wizard for Cloud Service In the wizard added a single ASP.NET Web Role project In the Page_Load method in Default.aspx.cs I added the WriteToLog line shown above Ran the project and in the dev fabric UI, drilled down the tree to web role instance "0" Nothing in the displayed log except some role instance start up messages followed by a bunch of health status messages. Tried reloading the page a few times, the breakpoint in Page_Load gets hit but nothing in the log. Logging Level is set to information, and the other events are level information so I don't think it's a logging level issue.

@TITLE:Looks simple, but I'm stumped!
@CONTENT:This should be so simple, but I'm drawing a blank. I have two tables. Table:article_tag_pvt
colum: article_id
column: tag_id

Table: tag
column: tag_id
column: name
 The article_tag_pvt table is a many-to-many pivot table. The problem is, I need a query which given a list of tag names, will retrieves article Ids which ONLY match those tag names. The basic joining of these tables looks like this: SELECT article_id
FROM article_tag_pvt pvt
INNER JOIN tag t ON t.tag_id = pvt.tag_id
 I've already got a query which will retrieve article ids which match ANY tag names specified. This looks like this: SELECT article_id
FROM article_tag_pvt pvt
INNER JOIN tag t ON t.tag_id = pvt.tag_id
WHERE t.name IN ('events','news')
 I've tried these but no joy: SELECT article_id
FROM article_tag_pvt pvt
INNER JOIN tag t ON t.tag_id = pvt.tag_id
WHERE t.name = 'events' AND t.name = 'news'

SELECT article_id
FROM article_tag_pvt pvt
INNER JOIN (
SELECT tag_id
FROM tag
WHERE name IN ('events','news')
) AS t
ON t.tag_id = pvt.tag_id
 Any help would be greatly appreciated Dave

@CONTENT:My application was rejected because it is crashing on iPhone 3G running iPhone OS 3.0.1 and iPod touch running iPhone OS 3.0 and Mac OS X 10.5.8. ,I thought that iPhone apps should be tested only on iPhone . Why they test it on the mac? I had some methods that was deprecated on SDK 3, and apple requires that the app should be build to the official SDK 2.2.1. so I made pre-processor directives for the conditional compilation such as __IPHONE_3_0 and build two separate executables.I set the base SDK to the higher version iPhone 3 and the iPhone OS deployment target to the older version Iphone 2.2.1. I build the application from xcode without errors or warnings and it is lunched on the simulator. when I go to the build directory of the simulator release and try to run the application it fails. Is that what they meant that the app crashes on Mac OS X 10.5.8? I'm running Mac OS X 10.5.7 now. I need to resubmit the app as soon as possible. I would appreciate any help. Thanks in advance, Sarah

@TITLE:Dynamically loading posts with Wordpress
@CONTENT:This helpful idea from Andy Gaskell supports 50% of my next question: I'd like to load posts dynamically with WordPress. Fetching them with Andy's function does work, but How do I bind the load to each and every one of the posts? Can I insert PHP generated content (post permalink, for example) to the JS script? Thank you.

@TITLE:HTTP push examples in Flex
@CONTENT:I am trying to create a simple board game (a kind of checkers), where users will be able to play online with each other using flex application as a client. I am using django application to process the game on the server side. And I come across the problem, if one user made a move, I can send it to a server, but how do I let the opponent know about it? The way I am thinking to do it is to create a timer and send requests to the server asking was opponents move done or not....But here we have 2 limitations: 1) Each client would produce big amount of requests (not sure how server will work if I have e.g 100 such clients) 2) If players will chose game with a time limit for example 5 minutes/per game it will be very important to show them situation on the board as soon as it changes (without a pause), but timer will send request only on timer event, so if for example I will chose tick interval to 5 seconds it will mean that 5 seconds another side will not be aware of the situation changes.

I mean, when a user from AllowedRole logins, the login page redirects the user correctly to the protected page, but when a user from NonAllowedRole tries to login, he/she correctly logs in but there are no error messages displayed, the user is back to the login page without any information. I do have a FailureText set in Login form but it's not displayed. loginForm.LoginError event is also doesn't get raised. I tried this code but it doesn't display either: protected void frmLogin_LoggedIn(object sender, EventArgs e)

@CONTENT:HELP! How would I fix this Actionscript 3.0 so that it creates a Dynamic Page title for each page? I am new to Actionscript 3.0 and I am trying to generate a page title using Dynamic Text for each page. I have four pages in my site, and here is the actionscript that I have so far: stop ()
function createTitle (whichpage:String) {
pageTitle.text = whichpage;
};
var page:String="theres no place like home";
createTitle (page);

function btn1Press (MouseEvent) {

}

function btn3Press (MouseEvent) {
gotoAndStop (20);
}

function btn4Press (MouseEvent) {
gotoAndStop (30);
}

btn1Press.addEventListener (MouseEvent.CLICK, Home);
btn2Press.addEventListener (MouseEvent.CLICK, Services);
btn3Press.addEventListener (MouseEvent.CLICK, About);
btn4Press.addEventListener (MouseEvent.CLICK, Contact);

stop();


1,10,20,30 represent the frames that each page is on
 The four navigation buttons are setup as follows: btn1Press = Home Page (Instance name "Home")
btn2Press = Services Page (Instance name "Services")
btn3Press= About Page (Instance name "About")
btn4Press=Contact Page (Instance name "Contact")
 I already have the dynamic text box set up. Basically I need each of the buttons to go to their respective pages, and I need the text in the dynamic text box to change depending on which page it is. Here is the additional actionscript that I have at frames 10,20 and 30 (services,about,and contact) page = "services"; createTitle (page); stop (); page = "about"; createTitle (page); stop (); page = "contact"; createTitle (page); stop (); I am getting really frustrated with this, and any help would be SO awesome! I keep getting error #1061 about undefined functions So I think a better way to ask my question would be: I have a four page site in Flash CS4, Page 1 starts on Frame 1, Page 2 starts on Frame 10, Page 3 starts on Frame 20 and Page 4 starts on Frame 30. There are Four navigation buttons that I have converted to button symbols. What should I call each button, and what should I call the instance of each button? What code do I need to put in the actions panel in order to get the navigation buttons to function properly, and make the dynamic text box display a title specific to the page that it is on ("Welcome to the Home Page", "Welcome to the About Page", etc) Thanks for your help + patience, I am finding this all pretty confusing. :(

@CONTENT:I've come across a bug in my site: basically, it won't allow page names with full stops (periods) in them. I know the root of the problem is in my .htaccess file. RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule ^([^/\.]+)/?$ index.php?section=$1 [L]
RewriteRule ^([^/\.]+)/([^/\.]+)/?$ index.php?section=$1&page=$2 [L]
RewriteRule ^([^/\.]+)/([^/\.]+)/([^/\.]+)/?$ index.php?section=$1&page=$2&split=$3 [L]
 Here the regex will not match anything with a period, this is intentional if a user is trying to directly access a file. Here are some examples of common URLs. games/Spider:+The+Secret+of+Bryce+Manor
games/Orbital
features/Interviewed:+Dennis+Sijnen+from+No+Monkeys
news/all/4
 The split portion of the URL is usually only used for pagination. The page portion of the URL is where I would want to place full stops, for example: games/Must.Eat.Birds
 As I'm not particularly good at either mod rewrite or regex I'd just like a solution that allows full stops. I know it could potentially be a more complex regex and here I'm out of my depth. Thanks for any help.

@TITLE:UserControl Visibility binding through ViewModel
@CONTENT:Simplified architecture of my Silverlight app: MainPage; DataContext set to MainViewModel MainPage has two elements: UserControl and Rectangle in MainViewModel, I have two properties, UserControlVisible and RectVisible, both of type Visibility, binded to Visibility properties of those two elements in MainPage.XAML MainViewModel has INotifyPropertyChanged implemented Problem is, when I set RectVisible property in MainViewModel to Visibility.Collapsed, Rectangle hides, which is fine, but when I set Visibility.Collapsed to UserControl (UserControlVisible property), it never hides! I cannot hide that user control, and I have to do it through my ViewModel class. Why it works with Rectangle element, but not with UserControl? When I manually set Visibility to Collapsed in XAML, then it's hidden, but I have to do it through code and ViewModel object.

@TITLE:Unit Testing With Computer Owned States
@CONTENT:I am writing a unit test for when my computer receives/makes a phone call. The methods being tested are the events that handle the incoming/outgoing call. If the caller is not an approved caller then the call is rejected. The code works fine, but I can't really find anything to test against for my unit test. The problem is that the actual state of "if my computer is in a call or not" is not controlled my by class. Only the computer knows if a call is currently connected or not. I am hoping that there are some Unit Test Guru's out there than can tell me what to do to test this scenario. I do not want to create a dummy var that has no relation to my code just to make my unit test pass. To make this a bit more concrete here is my unit test:     private DeviceMediator deviceMediator;
    private IDeviceControlForm deviceControlForm;
    private IDataAccess data;
    private ICallMonitor callMonitor; 

    // Use TestInitialize to run code before running each test

    {
        deviceControlForm = MockRepository.GenerateStub<IDeviceControlForm>();          
        data = MockRepository.GenerateStub<IDataAccess>();
        callMonitor = MockRepository.GenerateStub<ICallMonitor>();

        deviceMediator = new DeviceMediator(deviceControlForm, data) 
           {CallMonitor = callMonitor};
    }

    [TestMethod]
    public void TestHandleIncomingCall()
    {
        //Arrange

 and IsInfoEnabled returns false, and nothing is being logged, the .config file is not being read... Remembering the Log4net wrapper (static class) is in its own class project but the .config file is in the web project ihave.. I need it like this because .config can change on a project by project basis but generally the wrapper won't.

@CONTENT:We have a situation where I have a bunch of urls with query params that are used to bascially redirect to various sites, kind of like a short URL or index. Ex: www.mysite.com/abc?x=123 which redirects to www.google.com www.mysite.com/abc?x=456 which redirects to www.yahoo.com and so on... The issue is that there isn't an actual page "abc" now or prior, these links were created and published unknown to the site. The issue is now finding a simple means to make them active so when clicked will do the proper redirects. This is currently on an IIS Windows server. The core site itself is .NET based. Is there a way using an htaccess file or similar (assuming we use a mod-rewrite isapi plugin for IIS) to allow creating these redirects? We have hundreds of these to create. The only other option I can think is redirecting these in turn to an actual asp.net page which would then process the param and redirect logic in code, assumign we can do a rredirect from the base URL to a real page easily. The real problem I guess is getting around delaing with "abc?x=456" when there is no actual page in existence and no extension is given anyway to put a page in place.

@TITLE:Calling webservices from Silverlight 3 when running out-of-browser
@CONTENT:We have this nice Silverlight 3 application that communicates with a web server running some WCF web services. It works well when it is running in the browser, but at soon we try to run it outside the browser it doesn't call our webservices. I have tried to find out why this is happening, but I can't find any explanation. When attaching the debugger to the sllauncher.exe process I am able to step through the code and I can see that the (Begin)Async method is called. But using Fiddler I can see that there is no traffic to the server at all! I have also verified that the endpoint address is correct and that the endpoint is properly configured (it works when running in the browser after all). So I am wondering what can be the cause of the problem and how to debug it. Any ideas? EDIT: I noticed that our application doesn't run in Internet Explorer either. But it runs fine in Firefox! This isn't much of a surprise since the out of browser application embeds internet explorer, but it may be a clue to our problem. So, do you know of any differences between hosting silverlight in Firefox versus Internet Explorer?

List control with some data when i export the report to PDF, and the contents of the List are less that one full page - my letterhead is displayed on the first page (the rest of the page is empty) and the List content gets moved to the second page. if the List grows over 1 page - reports is showing up just fine (Letterhead and portion of the list on the first page - the rest on the second page) It looks like it tries to keep the list on 1 page as long as its contents fit on the page - but when you add the letterhead to the contents it overflows the page, and the list gets bumped down to the next page. Is there any way to keep the list on the first page regardless of its size. Putting the letterhead in the list is my last resort, I'd like to hear some other solutions. uploaded a sample .rdl to illustrate the problem got rid of the list for simplicity, the problem seems to be with a textbox wanting to show up on 1 page p.s. see this question for more details

 That's fine, but what if I want to figure out a user-readable interpretation of the connection status? I might have a static function like this: +(NSString*)statusStringForInt:(MyConnectionStatus)status;

@TITLE:How can I identify different encodings without the use of a BOM?
@CONTENT:I have a file watcher that is grabbing content from a growing file encoded with utf-16LE. The first bit of data written to it has the BOM available -- I was using this to identify the encoding against UTF-8 (which MOST of my files coming in are encoded in). I catch the BOM and re-encode to UTF-8 so my parser doesn't freak out. The problem is that since it's a growing file not every bit of data has the BOM in it. Here's my question -- without prepending the BOM bytes to each set of data I have (because I don't have control on the source) can I can just look for null bytes that are inherent in UTF-16 \000, and then use that as my identifier instead of the BOM? Will this cause me headaches down the road? My architecture involves a ruby web application logging the received data to a temporary file when my parser written in java picks it up. Write now my identification/re-encoding code looks like this:   // guess encoding if utf-16 then
  // convert to UTF-8 first
  try {
    FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(args[args.length-1]);
    byte[] contents = new byte[fis.available()];
    fis.read(contents, 0, contents.length);

    if ( (contents[0] == (byte)0xFF) && (contents[1] == (byte)0xFE) ) {
      String asString = new String(contents, "UTF-16");
      byte[] newBytes = asString.getBytes("UTF8");
      FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(args[args.length-1]);
      fos.write(newBytes);
      fos.close();
    }

    fis.close();
    } catch(Exception e) {
      e.printStackTrace();
  }

@TITLE:Mootools Slider plugin functions
@CONTENT:I am using mootools to create a CSS skin for the Youtube chromeless player using the javascript API to control playback. I cannot post the code unfortunately. The question I have is a more general one. When using the slider plugin a call to mySlider.set(step) moves the knob to the correct step on the slider but it triggers all of the plugins event functions (onChange, onTick, onComplete). The problem with this is, how do you know if the sliders knob position was changed by a user or a call to the set() function? I would have thought there would be a function reserved for when the knob was released by a mouse only and not be called if the position was simply set in code. I have code that updates the knobs position based on where the videos playback duration is currently at. I need to be able to move the knob to the current position in code without it thinking a user let go of the knob. To simplify the question, is there a way to set the knobs position on a slider in code without triggering the functions used when a user interacts?

FYI, I am using XMLCharts (http://www.maani.us/xml%5Fcharts/) to display chart data. Basically I have a library that generates up-to-the-minute data on the fly based on selected date ranges. Well, for whatever reason, IE refuses to show the updated chart after changing the date range. I've confirmed that the server is actually generating the renewed data in the background (as I can see the raw data file that is output), but IE seems to cache the previous Flash chart for display instead of displaying a fresh one. For the record, I am keeping the name of the chart the same between refreshes, so that may be part of the IE issue. Still, the other browsers refresh and show up-to-date info as necessary, I'm not sure why IE doesn't display the chart with the updated data. Any ideas? Can I force a refresh of some sort? Best.

@TITLE:Please help prevent data layer refactoring of this ODP.NET code and transactions
@CONTENT:I am using Oracle 11g client, with ODP.NET. I am trying to add conditional Transaction handling. Dim ds As New DataSet()
Dim txn As OracleTransaction
Dim _beginTransaction as Bolean = true
 Using conn As New OracleConnection(ConnString)
            Try
                conn.Open()
                If _beginTransaction Then
                        txn = conn.BeginTransaction(IsolationLevel.Serializable)
                End If

                Dim adapter As OracleDataAdapter = New OracleDataAdapter()
                adapter.SelectCommand = New OracleCommand(sSQL, conn)

                For i As Integer = 0 To UBound(parameters, 1)
                    adapter.SelectCommand.Parameters.Add(parameters(i))
                Next

                adapter.Fill(ds)
                If _beginTransaction Then
                    txn.Commit() //txn is undefined here? why?

            Catch e As Exception
                txn.Rollback()
            End Try
        End Using
 How do I fix txn being nothing / null? The error is: Variable 'txn' is used before it has been assigned a value. A null reference exception could result at runtime. Links or pointers to solutions would be appreciated also. Edit: Thanks to RichardOD for pointing out that you can not explicitly declare that a transaction cannot be opend up on stored procedures via ODP.NET. I have verified that this is an issue. BUT We still haven't figured out why the error is occuring. I understand that txn is initially given a value w/in an if statement, but being defined outside of the try/catch block should make that irrelevant.... right? Or is that bad coding?
@CODE:Dim ds As New DataSet()
Dim txn As OracleTransaction
Dim _beginTransaction as Bolean = true
 Using conn As New OracleConnection(ConnString)

@TITLE:What is the best way to fetch a single record via an OleDbConnection?
@CONTENT:C#, .Net 2.0: I have a class that wraps a single record from a database accessed via an OleDbConnection object. It is quite simple, it executes a "SELECT * FROM table WHERE key = {some value};" and then exposes the fields as properties with a few methods to manipulate the data. When I create a new instance of this object, the code that gets executed looks like:         DataSet ds = new DataSet();
        ds.Locale = CultureInfo.InvariantCulture;
        OleDbDataAdapter da = new OleDbDataAdapter(cmd);

        if (cmd.Connection.State != ConnectionState.Open)
        {
            cmd.Connection.Close();
            cmd.Connection.Open();
        }

        da.Fill(ds);

        return ds.Tables[0];
 cmd is an OleDbCommand object passed to the method. When I execute this, around 95% of the time it takes to create the object is in the da.Fill(ds) call, according to the VS 2008 profiler. I also have a class that represents a collection of these objects that implements IEnumerable, and when iterating that object using foreach, each single record object is created on the fly and those da.Fill(ds) statements add up quickly. My question is, is this the best way to fetch a single record? Alternately, is there a more preferred way to implement the collection object so iterating it does not take so long? Thanks
@CODE:DataSet ds = new DataSet();
        ds.Locale = CultureInfo.InvariantCulture;
        OleDbDataAdapter da = new OleDbDataAdapter(cmd);

        if (cmd.Connection.State != ConnectionState.Open)
        {
            cmd.Connection.Close();
            cmd.Connection.Open();
        }

        da.Fill(ds);

@TITLE:Performance - Python vs. C#/C++/C reading char-by-char
@CONTENT:So I have these giant XML files (and by giant, I mean like 1.5GB+) and they don't have CRLFs. I'm trying to run a diff-like program to find the differences between these files. Since I've yet to find a diff program that won't explode due to memory exhaustion, I've decided the best bet was to add CRLFs after closing tags. I wrote a python script to read char-by-char and add new-lines after '>'. The problem is I'm running this on a single core PC circa-1995 or something ridiculous, and it's only processing about 20MB/hour when I have both converting at the same time. Any idea if writing this in C#/C/C++ instead will yield any benefits? If not, does anyone know of a diff program that will go byte-by-byte? Thanks. EDIT: Here's the code for my processing function... def read_and_format(inputfile, outputfile):
    ''' Open input and output files, then read char-by-char and add new lines after ">" '''
    infile = codecs.open(inputfile,"r","utf-8")

@TITLE:Date fields in MySQL, finding all rows that don't overlap and returning only the difference
@CONTENT:So this was one of my very first questions here, but I have a slight variation: So I have two people whose schedules are in a database. The schedules simply record the start time, end time, and description of the various events/appointments for both users. PersonA wants to trade appointments with PersonB. I want a MySQL query that will return all of them times that PersonB and PersonA can swap. Originally the parameters of the query were to throw out any appointments of PersonB where there was overlap with PersonA and PersonB's appointment had to be the exact same length as the appointment PersonA wants to swap. I got some great advice on time arithmetic/geometry that helped me get the results I needed. Now I want to change the 1-to-1 parameter so that the appointments don't have to be equal in length. So if PersonA wants to swap his Monday morning appointment (10:00 AM - 11:30 AM), the query will: Exclude any of PersonB's appointments that are during one of PersonA's appointments Include any of PersonB's appointments that are outside of PersonA's appointments Include the parts of PersonB's appointments that are while PersonA is free, but only show the free portion. So if PersonA wants to swap the above appointment (again, Monday 10:00 AM - 11:30 AM), and PersonA has an appointment on Tuesday 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM and PersonB has an appointment on Tuesday from 12:00 PM to 4:00 PM, the query would return: Possible_Swaps
==============
userID  | Start             | End             | Description
PersonB | Tuesday, 12:00 PM | Tuesday 1:00 PM | Cooking
PersonB | Tuesday,  4:00 PM | Tuesday 5:00 PM | Cooking
 In addition to any other possibilities. Is this too much to expect from the database? If so, any suggestions on how to at least get those shifts that are overlapping but have the times hanging over either side so that a PHP script could deal with them? per searlea's request, here's a bit more context: I kept saying appointments but I think I really meant "jobs" as in "work shifts". PersonA and PersonB work in the same office. In vcalendar, work shifts are usually referred to as "Events" but on occasion "Appointments" and I went with the latter as it sounds less like the two Persons are going to a fair. So PersonA has a dish-washing shift on Monday from 10:00 to 11:30 AM. PersonB is cooking on Tuesday from 12:00PM to 5:00PM. PersonA really wants to see his brother before they leave town on Monday. He'd rather get all of Monday morning off, but he'd settle for getting an hour of shift off . So in my old model (brought up in my very first question here), I was looking for any shifts where there was no overlap and where the shifts were equal in time. But that has two problems: If I need someone to cover my 2 hour shift on Tuesday and I work for 4 hours on Thursday, and Joe works for 8 hours on Thursday, I could swap two of his hours and he could leave a bit early and I can stay a bit later. If I have a two hour shift, but I'd gladly trade an hour of it just to make it to the airport on time, I want to know if such and such comes in an hour earlier than me later in the week so I can take that part of his shift. Long story short (too late), I want what is apparently known as the relative complement of PersonA's shifts to PersonB (basically any times that PersonB is working and PersonA is not, regardless of whether the shifts overlap at some other point.) Ideally, I would get a set of results that included the bits that PersonB was working and PersonA was not (the two 1 hour shifts mentioned above), as well as the entire shift (with a special tag to indicate it is not available as a whole) so that PersonA would see that he was covering part of a shift and not get confused and think that PersonB just happened to be working two one hour shifts. This is all starting to sound a bit complicated. Basically I want PersonB's shifts to be be blue, PersonA's shifts to be yellow, and I want the database to return all of the parts that are not green.

 This works fairly well for the use that I make of it. It protects database, table, field names and even the * operator, however now I also want it to protect function calls, ie: AVG(database.employees.salary)
 Should become: AVG(`database`.`employees`.`salary`) and not `AVG(database`.`employees`.`salary)`
 How should I go about this? Should I use regular expressions? Also, how can I support more advanced stuff, from: MAX(AVG(database.table.field1), MAX(database.table.field2))
 To: MAX(AVG(`database`.`table`.`field1`), MAX(`database`.`table`.`field2`))
 Please keep in mind that I want to keep this method as simple/fast as possible, since it pretty much iterates over all the entity names in my database.

@CONTENT:Recently our Web hosting provider moved to a medium trust level for all shared ASP.NET site hosting. As a result, we're having some issues completing transactions via PayPal's SOAP API. Specifically, a SecurityException exception is being thrown with the following stack trace: [SecurityException: Request for the permission of type 'System.Security.Permissions.SecurityPermission, mscorlib, Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089' failed.]

 I tracked down the source to the offending method in the PayPal SOAP SDK. /// <summary>

} // SetTrustManager
 Does any know what change(s) need to be made to allow the SDK to function in a medium trust environment? Is it a necessity that all un-trusted certificates be accepted? Thanks.

 So say my main page is myserver.com/rootdir/DefaultTabs.asp So if the page I am loading is in myserver.com/rootdir/dir1/page1.html then when I load it into the tab it is a broken link that looks like myserver.com/rootdir/page1.html So how do I, for example replace all the links on the page to show the right directory, but NOT replace the link if it is already an absolute link. (for example at the bottom of every page I have myserver.com/rootdir/prefs/EditTab.asp which I still want to work) Thank you so much. I'm barely venturing into jquery and very behind.

EDIT: The app is a wi-fi LAN communications program that allows a user using the "client" software to pop up a message on any computer on the network running the "server" software. The software must notify the user even if they are not at the computer, hence the requirements for it to be always on (no support for WOL over wi-fi) and for it to make alot of noise & wake the screen to display any messages.

 Now, for reasons we don't really need to get into, I'm wanting to keep $/Project2 locked, to prevent anyone else doing anything to it. Normally, whenever you do a check-in at a particular level of the tree, everything at that level and below is included in the check-in. However, in this case, whenever I do a checkin to anything under $/Project1, included in the list of items to check-in is the lock on $/Project2. If I just hit OK, my lock disappears. Is there any way to prevent this behaviour?

@CONTENT:I have a development WSS 3.0 site that I wanted to move to a Production server. I am using VSeWSS 1.2 to do my deployment. I generated the SharePoint solution of the site with SharePoint Solution Generator 2008. When deploying it locally it works fine, but when I tried to deploy it to the remote Production server it would not deploy. I then had to install VS and the VSeWSS on the Production server and deploy from there because of time constraints. I have seen references where the generated SharePoint solutions are able to deploy fine to remote servers. What strategies should be used to effectively deploy SharePoint solutions to remote servers with the generated SharePoint solutions when using SharePoint Solution Generator 2008 in VSeWSS 1.2?

@LINK:/questions/1326745/database-sessions-in-spring
@TITLE:Database-sessions in Spring
@CONTENT:I'm quite new to Spring, and I would like to understand a bit more about sessions. I've mapped a legacy database with Hibernate annotated entities and built a couple of service objects to fetch, retrieve etc. My entities also contain other entities (mapped through foreign keys) and sets of entities. When I traverse the entitiy graph in my services, I have no problem. My services been wrapped in a TransactionProxyFactoryBean, so all should be good. So, in my View Controller I request a bunch of entities from the services. But when I traverse the entity graph in my view controller (for example to display user's state's country's name, with both state and country being lazily loaded entities), the Hibernate session is already closed and I get a "LazyInitializationException: could not initialize proxy - no Session" I wouldn't want my services to eagerly fetch the data, that'll consume way to much RAM because my graphs are deep and can even have circular references. I also don't want to explicitly have to touch on the parts that I'll be displaying in the services, as that'd mean that I'll have to copy/paste write similar services over and over again. So what I want is to have the Hibernate session still open when I'm in my view controller and not close down the session until the view has been served. What can I do to keep it open? My view bean looks like this, is there any way I can inject my TransactionProxyFactoryBean-derived bean into it?   <bean name="/" class="example.SimpleViewController">
    <property name="userService" ref="userService"/>
    <property name="catalogService" ref="catalogService"/>

@LINK:/questions/1325791/why-doesnt-this-jquery-code-work-in-ie
@TITLE:why doesn't this jQuery code work in IE?
@CONTENT:The following code is used so when clicking 'enter' when focused in an input field within a form, it disables the standard submit button functionality. Rather the javascript builds a new form and sends a post request to another page. I am using this so that I can achieve a "form within a form" functionality. The input field has its own submit button for which I have similar code to perform the post. In firefox, this works perfectly; in IE hitting enter does nothing at all. Here is the code: //event handler for input field within standard form
$('#inputfield').bind('keypress', function(e) {
    var code = e.keyCode || e.which;
    if(code==13){
    	//suppress default submit functionality
    	$('form').submit(function () {
    	    return false;
    	});

    	//...assemble some data here...

        var url_string = "...";

        var $form = $("<form method='POST'>").attr("action", url_string);
        $("<input type='hidden' name='body'>").attr("value",body).appendTo($form);

        $("<input type='hidden' name='title'>").attr("value",title).appendTo($form);

        //...create more form elements here...

        $form.appendTo("body");
        $form.submit();
    }
});
 Any ideas why this isn't working in IE (I tried in IE 6,7 and 8)? Update: just to elaborate on the problem: in firefox, the $form.submit(); line at the end causes the jquery generated form to submit and the page to redirect. In IE nothing happens at all. The keypress does fire in IE, its just that the form doesnt seem to get submitted.

@LINK:/questions/1325758/weird-qt-bug-to-do-with-properties-editor
@TITLE:Weird Qt bug (to do with properties editor)
@CONTENT:Slightly related to this question, but you don't really need to read that. The screenshot is helpful though: So what's happening is when you click an object, change a property, deselect it and then reselect it, the property editor will be reset to all 0s, even though those aren't the actual values. When you actually click in the text boxes in the editor, the correct value appears. Does that mean it's just a display issue or what? How come the editor has two different values? This only happens when the highlighted lines (with arrows) are left intact -- if they are commented out, this won't occur. The code: void PropertyBrowser::objectUpdated() {
    if(m_selectedObjects.isEmpty()) {
        return;
    }
    m_variantManager->disconnect(this); // <--- THIS LINE
    QMapIterator<QtProperty*, QByteArray> i(m_propertyMap);
    bool diff;
    while(i.hasNext()) {
        i.next();
        diff = false;
        for(int j = 1; j < m_selectedObjects.size(); ++j) {
            if(m_selectedObjects.at(j)->property(i.value()) != m_selectedObjects.at(j - 1)->property(i.value())) {
                diff = true;
                break;
            }
        }
        if(diff) setBackgroundColor(topLevelItem(i.key()), QColor(232,232,232));
        else setBackgroundColor(topLevelItem(i.key()), Qt::white);
        m_variantManager->setValue(i.key(), m_selectedObjects.first()->property(i.value()));
    }

    connect(m_variantManager, SIGNAL(valueChanged(QtProperty*, QVariant)), 
            this, SLOT(valueChanged(QtProperty*, QVariant)));  // <--- AND THIS LINE
}
 However, I need those lines because they prevent setValue from triggering a valueChanged signal which causes other issues. This seems to indicate that calls this function fixes the issue: void PropertyBrowser::valueChanged(QtProperty *property, const QVariant &value) {
    if(m_propertyMap.find(property) != m_propertyMap.end()) { 
        foreach(QObject *obj, m_selectedObjects) {
            obj->setProperty(m_propertyMap[property], value);
        }
    }
}
 But the only thing that THAT function does is update the actual object... it has nothing to do with the property editor (or shouldn't). Here's the entire class if you need it: /*

@TITLE:How do you create/obtain a cross domain policy for an iis7 wcf service?
@CONTENT:The missing link in my IIS7 + Silverlight 3.0 + WCF Service app is the cross domain policy. Are there any instructions on how to create/obtain such a policy. I understand that there are two xml files that need to go in the web root of the app. What do I put in them, how do I format them, does some template exist which indicates which fields need to be filled in? Are there instructions somewhere on msdn which explain how to do this? I'm just about out of possible terms to query google with, any pointers would be appreciated. Thanks, Brian

@TITLE:Flex reverse proxy issues
@CONTENT:I'm currently working on setting up a reverse proxy for testing a flex-based web application. The current setup is using mod_proxy (with mod_proxy_http) to reverse proxy to another host. Everything seems to work except for requests made from the flash player, which result in an error message that says "Security error accessing url". I have a crossdomain.xml set up on the back end system that simply allows everything, using "<allow-access-from domain="*"/>". The crossdomain.xml is available off of / from both the backend and proxy server. The odd part is that when I monitor the connection traffic with firebug, the browser is bypassing the proxy and going straight to the backend server to get the crossdomain.xml file. Does anyone have any suggestions on how I can get the flex behave properly in an environment like this? I have included my proxy configuration below. <IfModule mod_proxy.c> ProxyRequests Off     <Proxy *>

@TITLE:How to return JSONResult without the browser prompting to save the file?
@CONTENT:EDIT: I've long since moved beyond VS2008, and I haven't had any issues with returning JSON results using MVC 3+. I'd like to mark this question as obsolete, or something to that effect. Perhaps someone will still find value in this and the answers given, but I can't mark them as "correct" since I have no way of testing them. I am new to MVC, and am trying to make a simple site work. I'm starting to wonder if it is really worth it...I could have had this site up and running with "old-school" ASP.Net two or three times already...but that is beside the point ;-) How can I get my controller to return a JSONResult without the browser prompting me to save the response as a file? Here is the JavaScript that calls the action: $("select#PageId").change(function() {
    var id = $("#PageId > option:selected").attr("value");
    $.getJSON('FindCategories/', { PageId: id }, 
        function(data) {
            if (data.length > 0) {
                var options = '';
                for (c in data) {
                    var cat = data[c];
                    options += "<option value='" + cat.CategoryId + "'>" + cat.CategoryName + "</option>";
                }
                $("#CategoryId").removeAttr('disabled').html(options);
            } else {
                $("#CategoryId").attr('disabled', true).html('');
            }
    });
});
 Here is my controller action: Function GetCategoriesByPage(ByVal PageId As Integer) As JsonResult

    Dim categories As List(Of Models.WebCategoryLite) = _service.ListCategoriesByPageId(PageId)

    Dim res As New JsonResult
    res.Data = categories
    Return res

End Function
 Fiddler shows me that the JSON is being returned to the browser: HTTP/1.1 200 OK

 Now employee 1 is marked as deleted. Now I want the option to undo the delete and / or show a list of deleted employees, how can I do that? Either it will be undone if the user accidentally deleted the employee, or they want to go to a 'trash' list with previously deleted employees (i.e. only those with IsDeleted set to true).

@TITLE:Creating Breadcrumbs structure from SQL Query
@CONTENT:I am using SQL Query and below are the tables. Organization OrgID    Name	       RAOGID	  RAOID	  SubGroupID
1       Org RAOG	  1	  NULL       NULL
2       Org RAO	        NULL	   1	    NULL

 RAO RAOID   RAOGID
1         1
 Sub Group SubGroupID  RAOID
1            1
 I have four tables as shown above, I need to make breadcrumb from above table¡¦s structure, so I want to write query which will return the data in below format, please see below. RAOGID >> RAOID >> SubGroupID For example from above data my breadcrumb will be Org RAOG >> Org RAO >> Org Sub Group The ¡§Organization¡¨ table contains all the IDs of ROAG, RAO and SubGroup, I need the query which will return the data in above format. One more functionality is required. I don't want to show the breadcrumb if there is no subgroupid so my breadcrumb will be Org RAOG >> Org RAO and there is no RAOID then there will be only one breadcrumd i.e. Org RAOG Thanks, Best Regards, Manoj

@TITLE:Why isn't cl.exe producing a valid Windows module?
@CONTENT:I have a simple C DLL that exposes functions from a static library. The DLL compiles without errors and I can run DUMPBIN on it to see the exports. However, when I attempt to load it with DllImport in C#, it says this: System.DllNotFoundException: Unable to load DLL 'ei.dll': The specified module could not be found. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x8007007E). It's in the correct directory, for sure. So, I read that it might be a good idea to try Dependency Walker, in case I need to include something else. Unfortunately, when I try to open my DLL in DW, I get this: Error: At least one file was not a 32-bit or 64-bit Windows module. Here's my cl command: set ERL_INTERFACE_DIR=C:\Progra~1\erl5.7.2\lib\erl_interface-3.6.2\
call vcvars32.bat

{
    Graphics g = e.Graphics;        
    Bitmap blip = new Bitmap(tst_Graphics.Properties.Resources.dogtag);
    Rectangle radar_rect = new Rectangle(myRadarBox.Left + 80, myRadarBox.Left + 7, myRadarBox.Width - 200, myRadarBox.Height + 200);
    using (Pen drw_pen = new Pen(Color.White, 1) )
    {
        using (GraphicsPath path = new GraphicsPath())
        {
            path.AddPie(radar_rect, 180, 180);
            path.CloseFigure();
            using (Region rdRegion = new Region(path) )
            {
                g.DrawPath(drw_pen, path);
                g.Clip = rdRegion;
                PictureBox pb = new PictureBox();
                pb.Image = (blip);
                pb.Size = blip.Size;
                g.DrawImage(blip, radar_rect);
            }
        }

    }

}// end paint method
 I have tried the DrawImageUnscaled method also but I either get a my tiny picture blown to fill the pie region or nothing is displayed.

                pb.Size = blip.Size;
                g.DrawImage(blip, radar_rect);
            }
        }

    }

@TITLE:iPhone interface orientation statement not working in OS 3.0?
@CONTENT:I have the following code which evaluates to true and runs the code inside the braces I rotate to the right (or left) in OS 2.2.1. However the same line of code does not evaluate to true (or go into the braces) if compiled and run for OS 3.0... I say this because in the debugger (and the log) the lines inside the braces get skipped if I've compiled for 3.0 This is inside of a textViewDidBeginEditing method on a textView... Did something change between 2.x and 3.0 relative to how this is handled? The non-resizing text field has been noticed by users as a bug I'm trying to fix... This isn't my code originally and as I look at it, I'm beginning to think I should be implementing some delegate methods for rotation...? But it still bugs me that this statement isn't working... Thanks in advance for any advice... if((self.interfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeft)||(self.interfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight))
{
	[self setTextViewHeight:107];
	NSLog(@"inside if self.interfaceorientation...");

}
@CODE:if((self.interfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeft)||(self.interfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight))
{
	[self setTextViewHeight:107];
	NSLog(@"inside if self.interfaceorientation...");

@CONTENT:I'm writing an implementation of std::codecvt facet that uses iconv. This implementation stores a pointer to heap-allocated data in std::mbstate_t state argument. Everything works fine, but is this code 64-bit compatible? Is there a platform where a pointer size exceeds the size of std::mbstate_t?

@CONTENT:in playing around with the idea of using a webservice for my project I noticed that a couple of properties ( method/event ) were automatically created for me. I can see the purpose of the Completed event but I am not sure where the Async method would be used. webmethod declaration:     [WebMethod]
    public string HelloBrad()
    {
        return "Hello Brad";
    }
 Consumption of service in codebehind   localhost.Service1 service = new localhost.Service1();;
  service.HelloBradAsync
  service.HelloBradCompleted
  service.HelloBrad
 could somebody please explain the usage of the HelloBradAsync method. Thanks

@TITLE:mysql calculation
@CONTENT:This is my initial question....well I got a response but I'm still stuck. Can anyone please explain how can I achieve this in mysql: I have two fields in mysql, 'cap_commdate' with DATE TYPE and 'cap_policyterm' with INT TYPE. I want to have another field called 'cap_maturityDate' which will automatically compute the policy term pereod in years (in layman's term ie: cap_commdate*cap_policyterm). What is the right SQL query to use; or what is the best approach; and I want to use it in my recordset to prepare a confirmation page... please a simple explanation... I have tried the following: SELECT DATE_ADD(cap_commdate, INTERVAL cap_policyterm YEAR) ...
 I ran the query and got errors; so i edited it and used: SELECT
DATE_ADD("cap_commdate", INTERVAL "cap_policyterm" YEAR) AS cap_maturity FROM capital
 All I got was empty fields. Please help out.
@CODE:cap_commdate cap_policyterm cap_maturityDate cap_commdate*cap_policyterm SELECT DATE_ADD(cap_commdate, INTERVAL cap_policyterm YEAR) ... SELECT
DATE_ADD("cap_commdate", INTERVAL "cap_policyterm" YEAR) AS cap_maturity FROM capital

@LINK:/questions/1318233/trigger-for-when-a-sale-is-made-to-update-the-despatch-table
@TITLE:trigger for when a sale is made to update the despatch table [closed]
@CONTENT:I was wondering how I would go about creating a trigger to update the despatch table once a new sale has been inserted into the sales table. I am guessing that the first few lines of the code will look like this: create trigger sale_trig
after insert of sale_id on sales
.....
 But I am not sure how to do the rest. I am using iSQL Plus. The sales table consists of: sale_id, sale_price, sale_date, no_of_prods, prod_id, cust_id, desp_id. The despatch table consists of: desp_id, shelfLoc, quantity, prod_id, prod_name. I'm guessing since I don't have sale_id in the despatch table, I would need to add that in first and make it a foreign key, but I'm not sure. EDIT I am creating test data for a database. The schema they have given us says that we need to include prod_name in the despatch table for some reason, but I thought we'd only need to link it with prod_id. Ok maybe it isn't update. Would it just be a new insert into the despatch table then? I am using this for iSQL Plus. For shelfLoc we were told to generate random strings, by using the random generator. So how would I link that into the trigger? (I hope that made sense)
@CODE:create trigger sale_trig
after insert of sale_id on sales
..... sale_id sale_price sale_date no_of_prods prod_id cust_id desp_id desp_id shelfLoc quantity prod_id prod_name sale_id prod_name prod_id shelfLoc

@TITLE:NSView leaves artifacts on another NSView when the first is moved across the second
@CONTENT:I have an NSView subclass that can be dragged around in its superview. I move the views by calling NSView's setFrameOrigin and setFrameRotation methods in my mouseDragged event handler. The views are both moved and rotated with each call. I have multiple instances of these views contained by a single superview. The problem I'm having is that, as one view is dragged over another, it leaves artifacts behind on the view it's eclipsing. I recorded a short video of this in action. Unfortunately, due to the video compression the artifacts aren't very visible. I strongly suspect that this is related to the simultaneous translation and rotation. Quartz Debug reveals that a rectangle of the occluding (or occluded) view is updated as another view is dragged across it (video here); somehow this rectangle is getting miscalculated by the drawing engine, so part of the view that should be redrawn isn't. The kicker is I have no idea how to fix this. I can't find any way to manually specify the update rect in the docs, nor am I sure that's what needs to happen. Any ideas? Thanks!

@TITLE:iostream, wifstream, and eclipse/g++ on windows
@CONTENT:I am using Eclipse on windows with the MinGW tool chain (g++, etc.). I have a program that I built on darwin that reads and writes to files using wifstream and wofstream. The program comiles and works find using eclipse on darwin (Mac)...no for my problem. When I move the code over to windows and try to build in using the MinGW tool chain and eclipse, I get a compile error on wifstream, wofstream, and wcout. Variables defined as wstring compile just fine. For example: wifstream inFile; inFile.open(argv[2], ios_base::in); results in a compile error ..\src\pdConv.cpp:31: error: `wifstream' was not declared in this scope which seems to indicate that the compiler thinks wifstream is a variable. I did notice that the _GLIBCXX_USE_WCHAR_T directive is not enabled in the include files. Do I need to define this myself or is something in the environment supposed to know this? If I define it manually then it appears I cant use both wide and narrow implementations in the same program. This is probably obvious but I have been stuck in this problem for to long...lol..What am I missing here?

@TITLE:Alternative to SQL Server for a simple web app
@CONTENT:I have a simple app written using SQL Server, Entity Framework, C# and WCF. When I wanted to share this app with my friends, I realised they didn't use SQL Server on their machine. I could go for SQL Server Express edition, as the usage of my app is personal and non-commercial. I found MySQL as a popular alternative to SQL Server. 1) Would I be required to update my entities when moving to MySQL? 2) Should I anticipate code changes in my BL layer due to change in entities layer? (I am wondering whether entities was built for SQL Server) Are there any databases similar to MS Access that is lightweight compared to MySQL? Are there any databases that need not be installed but can be copied around like MS Access? Appreciate your response!

@TITLE:Is a general class necessary for a site PHP site?
@CONTENT:I have a CORE class that pertains only to my specific site, ie, it performs site specific functions. I have a database class (for mysql), and other classes like access, validator, upload, template etc etc... I know that php classes can only extend one class each, so almost all of my classes extend the database class. I was looking over a public twitter class used on the twitter API. In it, there are functions to do almost everything you could do by going directly to the website, insert, delete, whatever... Should I put all site relatie functions inside my Core class and keep it out of the general scope of my scripts. Right now I have something like this.... Heres an example, as of right now I have functions like $core = new Core();
$core->get_user_info($user_id);
$core->get_user_articles($user_id);
 Inside that function, i perform database queries to select the needed information so i dont have to do it directly since it can get messy. I also have functions to delete things, like $core->Delete_Article($article_id);
 However, I dont have functions to insert. Instead I use the Database class directly to add information, like so. $article = array(user_id => $_SESSION['user_id'], body => $_POST['body']);
$db = new Database();
$db->Insert($article, 'articles');
 or $user = array(name => $_POST['name'], email => $_POST['email']);
$db->Insert($user, 'users');
 Now, in the topic of separation of one aspect from another, should I put ALL of my database select/insert/update/delete queries inside my general CORE class and do ALL the database actions in the background Like instead of $db->Insert(), i could use $core->insert_user() or just continue as I'm doing.
@CODE:$core = new Core();
$core->get_user_info($user_id);
$core->get_user_articles($user_id); $core->Delete_Article($article_id); $article = array(user_id => $_SESSION['user_id'], body => $_POST['body']);
$db = new Database();
$db->Insert($article, 'articles'); $user = array(name => $_POST['name'], email => $_POST['email']);

@TITLE:Notify DataTemplateSelector about the change
@CONTENT:I use a DataTemplateSelector for a ListView column headers template selection. ListView itself is defined in a DataTemplate and has a few tabs. So, in practice, I have the same DataTemplate (so ListView too) applied to several TabItems. This means that if I select tab {A} and set XDataTemplate on the ListView column {AColumn}, then switch the tab, lets say to tab {B}, on {B}'s ListView (that is always the same one) column {AColumn}, we will see the same XDataTemplate as they share same UI data. So I created data layer where I hold relational information about {Tab} <-> {ListView:Column} <-> {HeaderContent}. This actually reads DatatemplateSelector in order to correctly update the UI on user screen. How can I notify the DataTemplateSelector to update the current view as needed on request? Thank you.

@CONTENT:What I tried to do is generating a text file on ASP.Net using C#. The data is retrived from a database by executing a stored procedure. I ensured that the stored procedures returned values by executing it in SQL server Mangement studio. I was actually able to do just that. I first gether all related tables into a View then using stored procedure to get data from that View. Then generate that data into text file in ASP.Net. using the following code: SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection(ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["Name"].ConnectionString);
conn.Open();
SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand("Stored Procedure Name", conn);
cmd.CommandType = CommandType.StoredProcedure;
SqlDataAdapter myAdapter = new SqlDataAdapter(cmd);

System.Text.StringBuilder strResult = new System.Text.StringBuilder("");
string createtext = (Server.MapPath("./Feeds/") + "feed.txt");
StreamWriter w = File.CreateText(createtext);
w.Flush();
w.Close();
 I ensured that every View returned values as well (in SQL manament studio). But the problem is that not all stored procedures returned values on the ASP.Net I only get blank text file eventhough all stored procedures returned some values in SQL server Mangement studio. I only use a simple select statement in the storeprocedures like select Somthing form View_Name This query returns some value in the Management Studio, but not ASP.Net (for some stored procedures). what would be the issue for this problem. Please help

@CONTENT:I'm seeing basically the same issue described here I have a table that starts in the middle of the first page, and, depending on the size of the table, it should wrap onto the next page. This behaves fine when using the viewer, but when exporting to a pdf or tif image, things are displayed differently. Instead of starting on the first page and wrapping onto the second, it moves the entire table to start on the second page, leaving lots of ugly white-space on the first page. I've made sure that KeepTogether is false on the table, and there is no header/footer on the page (so it can't extend beyond the page's width). Has anyone seen this problem, or know of a solution/troubleshooting steps? Thanks!

What I would like is to have the columns sorted only by the outermost nodes. One attempt I had was to run treeGrid.closeAllItems() before the sort occurred. However, this does not work, because a Sort Column event gets dispatched while closeAllItems is running, so the list gets messed up and listOutOfBounds exceptions get thrown.

@TITLE:How to retrieve the telephone number from an AT CMGL response?
@CONTENT:I have an application written in C that reads text messages from a modem using AT commands. A typical AT response from the modem looks like this: +CMGL: 1,"REC READ","+31612123738",,"08/12/22,11:37:52+04"
 The code is currently set up to only retrieve the id from this line, which is the first number, and it does so using the following code: sscanf(line, "+CMGL: %d,", &entry);
 Here, "line" is a character array containing a line from the modem, and "entry" is an integer in which the id is stored. I tried extending this code like this: sscanf(line, "+CMGL: %d,\"%*s\",\"%s\",", &entry, phonenr);
 I figured I would use the %*s to scan for the text in the first pair of quotes and skip it, and read the text in the next pair of quotes (the phone number) into the phonenr character array. This doesn't work (%*s apparently reads "REC" and the next %s doesn't read anything). An extra challange is that the text isn't restricted to "REC READ", it could in fact be many things, also a text without the space in it.
@CODE:+CMGL: 1,"REC READ","+31612123738",,"08/12/22,11:37:52+04" sscanf(line, "+CMGL: %d,", &entry); sscanf(line, "+CMGL: %d,\"%*s\",\"%s\",", &entry, phonenr);

@TITLE:ASP.NET How can 2 dynamically loaded user controls respond to each others events?
@CONTENT:Greetings All, I have two ascx's loaded in the page-init event of an aspx page. Control 1 has a radio button list that I want a dropdown list on control 2 to respond to it's selectedIndex change. So far I call RaiseBubbleEvent on the SelectedIndexChange handler and I pass on a control reference and commandArgs. Then in the aspx I override OnBubbleEvent and I am able to receive the control reference and commandArgs. My question is how do I pass this information on to Control 2. The page is not aware of the controls as they are loaded dynamically and added to asp:PlaceHolders in the aspx. I need Control 2 to know which radio button was selected so I can change the datasource for the dropdown on control 2. Does anyone have any examples of something like this? Any pointers or tips would be appreciated. Thanks, ~ck in San Diego

@TITLE:How to track down ¡§can't find the object¡¨ errors copying databases and viewing in Access?
@CONTENT:(This doesn't look like a programming question but it might boil down to a programming question.) I'm using MS Access 2007 to view tables in a database (through an *.adp file) that lies on SQL Server 2000 and SQL Server 2005. I use the Copy Database task in MS SQL Server Management Studio to copy the data from SQL Server 2000 (the "live" server) to SQL Server 2005 (on my local computer). The copy appears to execute successfully. I have two separate *.adp files. One links to the DB on the live server and the other to the copied DB on my local machine. I can work with most of the tables on the DB on my local machine fine, but a few of them result in Access throwing this error before I can even see the data or the design view: Microsoft Office Access can't find the object 'SELECT *, sql _ variant _ property(value, 'basetype') AS type FROM :: fn_ listextendedproperty(N'MS _ DisplayViewsOnSharePointSite', N'user', N'dbo', N'table', N'tbl_Asset', NULL, NULL)'. You misspelled the object name. Check for missing underscores ( _ ) or other punctuation, and make sure you didn't enter leading spaces. You tried to open a linked table, but the file containing the table isn't on the path you specified. Use the Linked Table Manager to update the link and point to the correct path. (I have this error on five tables, and the only thing that changes is that "tbl_Asset" is replaced with the offending table name.) I don't have the same problem when I use Access to view the tables on the live DB. Also, I don't have this problem when I view the tables on the local DB through SQL Server Management Studio. Anyway, I have no clue where to start looking. I don't think the two suggestions beneath the error message apply. Any suggestions? Thanks for your help. UPDATE: Found what I think is the cause, but still can't resolve it. I'll post my progress below. Thanks

@LINK:/questions/1309694/application-fails-to-dynamically-re-load-javascript-files
@TITLE:Application fails to dynamically _re_load JavaScript files
@CONTENT:I have research about an issue and could not find a solution for it through normal JavaScript techniques (maybe there is but I did not find any). The thing is, my application loads ( inserts) JavaScript files whenever the user loads a section of the system. The problem comes when I try to unload ( removal) one. I've noticed that if I load section A (which loads script A'), then load section B (which loads script B'), and then load section A again, the code in script A' does not run again, thus every event registration in there doesn't get performed, which I do want to happen. (Maybe some extra kind of cleaning is required that I am not aware of?) Any ideas? If what I just said makes any sense... An example: 1- User enters Section 'Products' 2- Both the UI and JavaScript file associated to 'Products' get loaded 2.1- Products.js is now inserted in the <head>

2.2- Products.js code gets parsed and executed
 3- User enters Section 'Clients' 3.1 - Products.js reference is removed from the <head>
 4- Both the UI and JavaScript file associated to 'Clients' get loaded 4.1- Clients.js is now inserted in the <head>

4.2- Clients.js code gets parsed and executed
 5- User enters Section 'Products' 5.1 - Clients.js reference is removed from the <head>
 6- Both the UI and JavaScript file associated to 'Products' get loaded 6.1- Products.js is now inserted in the <head>

6.2- Products.js code **DOES NOT** get parsed nor executed
 Thanks in advance. P.S.: No framework is being used for this part of the application.
@CODE:2.1- Products.js is now inserted in the <head>

2.2- Products.js code gets parsed and executed 3.1 - Products.js reference is removed from the <head> 4.1- Clients.js is now inserted in the <head>

@TITLE:error C2664 converting from from const std::string to std::string&
@CONTENT:I keep receiving a C2664 conversion error in visual studio It tells me that it can't convert parameter 1 from const std::string to std::string&. I tried adding/removing the const in the stringToWstring prototype and in the function itself and the error still comes up.     wstring hexval = buff.substr(buff.find(L"hex(2):"));
    wstring h;
    wchar_t ch;

    typedef boost::tokenizer<boost::char_separator<wchar_t> > tokenizer;
    boost::char_separator<wchar_t> sep(L"//,");

    tokenizer tokens(hexval, sep);

    for(tokenizer::iterator tok_iter = tokens.begin(); tok_iter != tokens.end(); tok_iter++)
    {
        ch = someFunction(*tok_iter); //error here
    	h += ch;
    }



wstring stringToWstring(const string& s)
{
    wstring temp(s.length(), L'');
    copy(s.begin(), s.end(), temp.begin());
    return temp;
}

    wchar_t someFunction(const wstring &hex_val)
{

}
 Any ideas? EDIT: I see that this is really confusing so I'm going to explain a bit more.. Originally, what I wanted was these lines inside the for loop ch = someFunction(*tok_iter);
h += ch
 I also expected *tok_iter to return a wstring but I was getting an error like: cannot convert parameter 1 from const std::string to const std::wstring& Because of that, I assumed that somehow, *tok_iter is a const std::string thus, I created a stringToWstring function to do the conversion. To do this in the for loop ch = someFunction(stringToWstring(*tok_iter));
h += ch
 When I did that, I got: Error   1	error C2664: 'std::_String_const_iterator<_Elem,_Traits,_Alloc>::_String_const_iterator(const std::_String_const_iterator<_Elem,_Traits,_Alloc> &)' : cannot convert parameter 1 from 'std::_String_const_iterator<_Elem,_Traits,_Alloc>' to 'const std::_String_const_iterator<_Elem,_Traits,_Alloc> &'	c:\program files\boost\boost_1_39\boost\tokenizer.hpp	63
 I hope that's clearer now.

@TITLE:how can i make any numbers above the month's total days appear as new month day numbers?
@CONTENT:I have a php calendar at http://idea-palette.com/aleventcal/calendar.php. I want the days that are not part of the current month to show up grayed out(which it does now), and I want it to appear as those are the days of the previous and next month. As it is now, the days that appear before the first day of the month appear as negative numbers(-1,-2,-3, and so on) and the days that appear after the last day of the month just continue on, so if a month ends on the 31st, then it would read 32, 33, 34, and so on. I'm trying to figure out a conditional statement with some sort of loop where I could see if it is greater than the total days and then do something else. The problem I see is that the table cell that is being created is being looped, so if I do just $day+1, then instead of 32, it will just read 33. Here's my code: for($i=0; $i< $total_rows; $i++)
{
    for($j=0; $j<7;$j++)
    {
        $day++; 				

        //if the current day is less or equal to the total days in the month

            $date_form = "$current_year/$current_month/$day";

            echo '<div class="date_has_event" href="#"><td';

            //If the date is today then give the td cell the 'today' class

            {

@LINK:/questions/1304390/how-to-get-ie8-to-not-show-my-php-page-as-blank
@TITLE:How to get IE8 to not show my PHP page as blank
@CONTENT:I am building an online article website. I have a php script called view_article.php that displays articles. The way the page knows what article to show is by using a $_GET variable in the URL. For example: 
/view_article.php?article_id=1  views article 1
/view_article.php?article_id=2  views article 2
 Here's the catch. In IE8 when I view article 1, the page displays fine, but when I view article 2, IE displays the page as blank. It's running the same script so how/why is it displaying the page as blank? Of the 4 computers I have tried this on, it can be reproduced 100% of the time on 2 of the 4 computers and it never happens on the other 2 computers. Firefox and Chrome have no problems displaying the pages. I have all error messages turned on but nothing is displayed Any ideas on why this is happening and how I can fix it? It is not only those article pages that aren't working but other pages on the site don't work as well (maybe 10% of about 50 different php script pages don't work in IE8 consistenly on those 2 computers and one of those pages is my registration page). What can I do? I'm worried that 10% of my users won't be able to access my website. The majority of users of the site will be using IE. Thanks for any suggestions EDIT View Source Some helpful people suggested to view the source. Viewing the source on the computer that shows blank vs the computer that shows the page properly is almost identical except the computer that shows blank has some garbled characters that show after the last tag. I'm not doing anything to do with anything Turkish and also the computers giving me problems are in Taiwan and the browsers are in Mandarin (Chinese).

@TITLE:What do you think about designing an HTML table by using div?
@CONTENT:I have seen many HTML table related questions in SO. Many questions about browser specific bugs like CSS and JavaScript by involving HTML table is usually asked. A earlier version of DataTable YUI markup looks like as follows: // dynamically generated
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Some content</td>
        <td>Other content</td>
    </tr>
</table>
 Current version now looks like // dynamically generated
<table>
    <tr>
        <td><div>Some content</div></td>
        <td><div>Other content</div></td>
    </tr>
</table>
 Notice a div inserted inside a column. <div> advantages includes stable behavior and event support across browser JavaScript framework support display block by default easy to create and insert inside a HTML page You can think a HTML table element as follows <div class="collection">
    <div class="row">
        <div>Some content</div>
        <div>Other content</div>
    </div>
</div>
 I need it because i have designed a custom "like a table" component by using div. My custom "like a table" component purpose is to show tabular data. Stable behavior and event support (single and double-click in a row and a column) across many browsers is one feature that i have considered. Notice, for instance, ExtJS uses a custom "like a select" component by using div. And you know many bugs related to HTML select So what you think about design a HTML table by using div ? regards,
@CODE:// dynamically generated
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Some content</td>
        <td>Other content</td>
    </tr>

        <td><div>Some content</div></td>

@TITLE:Why is the NewRecord property lying to me?
@CONTENT:I'm at a complete loss, a form just changed behavior on me; it was working and then just stopped for no apparent reason. I'm opening it from a button: DoCmd.openForm "formName", , , "ID=" & Me.ID
 Debug tracing shows that the value is set properly at this point. When the form loads, I need to set a few display items, using the OnCurrent event. Private sub Form_Current()
    if Me.NewRecord Then
 At that point, it says there's no record, debugging info says the recordset is BOF and EOF, as if the query didn't match. But if I run the saved query at that moment, it displays the right info. Furthermore, if I stop the execution, leaving the form open, and then hit the button again, it does load the data properly. I'm stumped. Edit - After importing the form from a backup, and retyping the changes, the whole problem went away. I'm guessing corruption, but it's a mystery how it can screw up like that.

 The reason why its so long is the saReplacement, hrmsAdminReplacement, hrManagerReplacement and payrollAdminReplacement can all be null, so I put in a check to ensure they are not null so the rest of the clause does not get executed. But for some reason, when I run the first query, I don't get ANY results, but if I run the second one (MUCH LESS EFFICIENT) I get all the expected results. Is this a bug in Hibernate's HQL or am I losing my mind?

@TITLE:problems with jQuery mouseover for better looking css menu
@CONTENT:I have a horizontal menu on my site using nice-menus in drupal. When you hover over an li element, a background image is set for the link that displays. The problem I'm having is that this image disappears when you hover over a parent menu item's children. The image that is disappearing is set using this css style:   ul.nice-menu li a:hover, ul.nice-menu li.active a {
    background: url(images/bg-li-active.png) no-repeat scroll left bottom;
  }

  ul.nice-menu li * a:hover, ul.nice-menu li.active * a {
    background: none repeat;
    color:#000000;
  }
 I have set up jsbin to test this: http://jsbin.com/ogegu It looks like it works as expected. The menu expands, and only the parent element seems to be altered when over the child ul. However when I use code that actually attempts to set the background image, the png does not appear. the menu looks like this (check out the jsbin demo at http://jsbin.com/ogegu ): <div class="content">  
  <ul class="nice-menu nice-menu-down" id="nice-menu-1"><li id="menu-240" class="menu-path-front"><a href="/" title="" class="active">Home</a></li>  
    <li id="menu-660" class="menu-path-node-20"><a href="/content/about-us" title="About Us">About Us</a></li>  
    <li id="menu-238" class="menuparent menu-path-node-3">

    <li id="menu-631" class="menu-path-principals"><a href="/principals">Principals</a></li>  
  </ul>  
</div>
 Here is the actual JavaScript that I am trying to use: jQuery(document).ready(function(){
  jQuery('#nice-menu-1 li ul').hide();
  jQuery('#nice-menu-1 li.menuparent').hover(function() {
      jQuery(this).children('ul').show('fast');
      jQuery(this).children('a:eq(0)').css({ "background": "url(images/bg-li-active.png) no-repeat scroll left bottom"});
      return false;
  },
  function() {
      jQuery(this).children('ul').hide('fast');
      jQuery(this).children('a:eq(0)').css({"background": "none"});
      return false;
  });
});
 I am fairly new to using jQuery, can anyone offer a suggestion as to why this isn't doing what I'd expect? Ideally, I would like any hover or mouseover on the menuparent or menuparent's children to set the background of the first a tag that is a child. Even better, would be a solution that uses only css and no JavaScript.

Sometimes when they upload the files, the content-type is set as "application/octet-stream" which is a binary file. When I ask the user, they say that they uploaded they say it was a .tif file. Somehow the upload control sets it as "application/octet-stream". When I upload the same .tif file from my computer it uploads with the correct content type (application/octet-stream). I am using the following code to get the file extension fileExtension = filUpload.PostedFile.FileName.Substring(filUpload.PostedFile.FileName.LastIndexOf(".") + 1)
 sometimes it returns the file extension as "c:\documen" or "j:\testing" etc. I know that windows doesn't allow special characters in the filename.
@CODE:content-type "application/octet-stream" .tif "application/octet-stream" .tif application/octet-stream fileExtension = filUpload.PostedFile.FileName.Substring(filUpload.PostedFile.FileName.LastIndexOf(".") + 1) "c:\documen" "j:\testing"

@CONTENT:I'm seeing basically the same issue described here I have a table that starts in the middle of the first page, and, depending on the size of the table, it should wrap onto the next page. This behaves fine when using the viewer, but when exporting to a pdf or tif image, things are displayed differently. Instead of starting on the first page and wrapping onto the second, it moves the entire table to start on the second page, leaving lots of ugly white-space on the first page. I've made sure that KeepTogether is false on the table, and there is no header/footer on the page (so it can't extend beyond the page's width). Has anyone seen this problem, or know of a solution/troubleshooting steps? Thanks!

If you refer to this sample application, you'll notice that if you Open a branch node Sort by one of the columns Close that branch node then the TreeGrid starts to get out of wack and duplicate columns start appearing and other columns start disappearing. What I would like is to have the columns sorted only by the outermost nodes. One attempt I had was to run treeGrid.closeAllItems() before the sort occurred. However, this does not work, because a Sort Column event gets dispatched while closeAllItems is running, so the list gets messed up and listOutOfBounds exceptions get thrown.

@TITLE:How to retrieve the telephone number from an AT CMGL response?
@CONTENT:I have an application written in C that reads text messages from a modem using AT commands. A typical AT response from the modem looks like this: +CMGL: 1,"REC READ","+31612123738",,"08/12/22,11:37:52+04"
 The code is currently set up to only retrieve the id from this line, which is the first number, and it does so using the following code: sscanf(line, "+CMGL: %d,", &entry);
 Here, "line" is a character array containing a line from the modem, and "entry" is an integer in which the id is stored. I tried extending this code like this: sscanf(line, "+CMGL: %d,\"%*s\",\"%s\",", &entry, phonenr);
 I figured I would use the %*s to scan for the text in the first pair of quotes and skip it, and read the text in the next pair of quotes (the phone number) into the phonenr character array. This doesn't work (%*s apparently reads "REC" and the next %s doesn't read anything). An extra challange is that the text isn't restricted to "REC READ", it could in fact be many things, also a text without the space in it.
@CODE:+CMGL: 1,"REC READ","+31612123738",,"08/12/22,11:37:52+04" sscanf(line, "+CMGL: %d,", &entry); sscanf(line, "+CMGL: %d,\"%*s\",\"%s\",", &entry, phonenr);

@TITLE:ASP.NET How can 2 dynamically loaded user controls respond to each others events?
@CONTENT:Greetings All, I have two ascx's loaded in the page-init event of an aspx page. Control 1 has a radio button list that I want a dropdown list on control 2 to respond to it's selectedIndex change. So far I call RaiseBubbleEvent on the SelectedIndexChange handler and I pass on a control reference and commandArgs. Then in the aspx I override OnBubbleEvent and I am able to receive the control reference and commandArgs. My question is how do I pass this information on to Control 2. The page is not aware of the controls as they are loaded dynamically and added to asp:PlaceHolders in the aspx. I need Control 2 to know which radio button was selected so I can change the datasource for the dropdown on control 2. Does anyone have any examples of something like this? Any pointers or tips would be appreciated. Thanks, ~ck in San Diego

@TITLE:How to track down ¡§can't find the object¡¨ errors copying databases and viewing in Access?
@CONTENT:(This doesn't look like a programming question but it might boil down to a programming question.) I'm using MS Access 2007 to view tables in a database (through an *.adp file) that lies on SQL Server 2000 and SQL Server 2005. I use the Copy Database task in MS SQL Server Management Studio to copy the data from SQL Server 2000 (the "live" server) to SQL Server 2005 (on my local computer). The copy appears to execute successfully. I have two separate *.adp files. One links to the DB on the live server and the other to the copied DB on my local machine. I can work with most of the tables on the DB on my local machine fine, but a few of them result in Access throwing this error before I can even see the data or the design view: Microsoft Office Access can't find the object 'SELECT *, sql _ variant _ property(value, 'basetype') AS type FROM :: fn_ listextendedproperty(N'MS _ DisplayViewsOnSharePointSite', N'user', N'dbo', N'table', N'tbl_Asset', NULL, NULL)'. You misspelled the object name. Check for missing underscores ( _ ) or other punctuation, and make sure you didn't enter leading spaces. You tried to open a linked table, but the file containing the table isn't on the path you specified. Use the Linked Table Manager to update the link and point to the correct path. (I have this error on five tables, and the only thing that changes is that "tbl_Asset" is replaced with the offending table name.) I don't have the same problem when I use Access to view the tables on the live DB. Also, I don't have this problem when I view the tables on the local DB through SQL Server Management Studio. Anyway, I have no clue where to start looking. I don't think the two suggestions beneath the error message apply. Any suggestions? Thanks for your help. UPDATE: Found what I think is the cause, but still can't resolve it. I'll post my progress below. Thanks

@LINK:/questions/1309694/application-fails-to-dynamically-re-load-javascript-files
@TITLE:Application fails to dynamically _re_load JavaScript files
@CONTENT:I have research about an issue and could not find a solution for it through normal JavaScript techniques (maybe there is but I did not find any). The thing is, my application loads ( inserts) JavaScript files whenever the user loads a section of the system. The problem comes when I try to unload ( removal) one. I've noticed that if I load section A (which loads script A'), then load section B (which loads script B'), and then load section A again, the code in script A' does not run again, thus every event registration in there doesn't get performed, which I do want to happen. (Maybe some extra kind of cleaning is required that I am not aware of?) Any ideas? If what I just said makes any sense... An example: 1- User enters Section 'Products' 2- Both the UI and JavaScript file associated to 'Products' get loaded 2.1- Products.js is now inserted in the <head>

2.2- Products.js code gets parsed and executed
 3- User enters Section 'Clients' 3.1 - Products.js reference is removed from the <head>
 4- Both the UI and JavaScript file associated to 'Clients' get loaded 4.1- Clients.js is now inserted in the <head>

4.2- Clients.js code gets parsed and executed
 5- User enters Section 'Products' 5.1 - Clients.js reference is removed from the <head>
 6- Both the UI and JavaScript file associated to 'Products' get loaded 6.1- Products.js is now inserted in the <head>

6.2- Products.js code **DOES NOT** get parsed nor executed
 Thanks in advance. P.S.: No framework is being used for this part of the application.
@CODE:2.1- Products.js is now inserted in the <head>

2.2- Products.js code gets parsed and executed 3.1 - Products.js reference is removed from the <head> 4.1- Clients.js is now inserted in the <head>

@TITLE:error C2664 converting from from const std::string to std::string&
@CONTENT:I keep receiving a C2664 conversion error in visual studio It tells me that it can't convert parameter 1 from const std::string to std::string&. I tried adding/removing the const in the stringToWstring prototype and in the function itself and the error still comes up.     wstring hexval = buff.substr(buff.find(L"hex(2):"));
    wstring h;
    wchar_t ch;

    typedef boost::tokenizer<boost::char_separator<wchar_t> > tokenizer;
    boost::char_separator<wchar_t> sep(L"//,");

    tokenizer tokens(hexval, sep);

    for(tokenizer::iterator tok_iter = tokens.begin(); tok_iter != tokens.end(); tok_iter++)
    {
        ch = someFunction(*tok_iter); //error here
    	h += ch;
    }



wstring stringToWstring(const string& s)
{
    wstring temp(s.length(), L'');
    copy(s.begin(), s.end(), temp.begin());
    return temp;
}

    wchar_t someFunction(const wstring &hex_val)
{

}
 Any ideas? EDIT: I see that this is really confusing so I'm going to explain a bit more.. Originally, what I wanted was these lines inside the for loop ch = someFunction(*tok_iter);
h += ch
 I also expected *tok_iter to return a wstring but I was getting an error like: cannot convert parameter 1 from const std::string to const std::wstring& Because of that, I assumed that somehow, *tok_iter is a const std::string thus, I created a stringToWstring function to do the conversion. To do this in the for loop ch = someFunction(stringToWstring(*tok_iter));
h += ch
 When I did that, I got: Error   1	error C2664: 'std::_String_const_iterator<_Elem,_Traits,_Alloc>::_String_const_iterator(const std::_String_const_iterator<_Elem,_Traits,_Alloc> &)' : cannot convert parameter 1 from 'std::_String_const_iterator<_Elem,_Traits,_Alloc>' to 'const std::_String_const_iterator<_Elem,_Traits,_Alloc> &'	c:\program files\boost\boost_1_39\boost\tokenizer.hpp	63
 I hope that's clearer now.

@TITLE:how can i make any numbers above the month's total days appear as new month day numbers?
@CONTENT:I have a php calendar at http://idea-palette.com/aleventcal/calendar.php. I want the days that are not part of the current month to show up grayed out(which it does now), and I want it to appear as those are the days of the previous and next month. As it is now, the days that appear before the first day of the month appear as negative numbers(-1,-2,-3, and so on) and the days that appear after the last day of the month just continue on, so if a month ends on the 31st, then it would read 32, 33, 34, and so on. I'm trying to figure out a conditional statement with some sort of loop where I could see if it is greater than the total days and then do something else. The problem I see is that the table cell that is being created is being looped, so if I do just $day+1, then instead of 32, it will just read 33. Here's my code: for($i=0; $i< $total_rows; $i++)
{
    for($j=0; $j<7;$j++)
    {
        $day++; 				

        //if the current day is less or equal to the total days in the month           
        if($day>0 && $day<=$total_days_of_current_month)
        {
            $date_form = "$current_year/$current_month/$day";

            echo '<div class="date_has_event" href="#"><td';

            //If the date is today then give the td cell the 'today' class
            if($date_form == $today)
            {
                echo ' class="today"';
            }

            //check if any event stored for the date

@LINK:/questions/1304390/how-to-get-ie8-to-not-show-my-php-page-as-blank
@TITLE:How to get IE8 to not show my PHP page as blank
@CONTENT:I am building an online article website. I have a php script called view_article.php that displays articles. The way the page knows what article to show is by using a $_GET variable in the URL. For example: 
/view_article.php?article_id=1  views article 1
/view_article.php?article_id=2  views article 2
 Here's the catch. In IE8 when I view article 1, the page displays fine, but when I view article 2, IE displays the page as blank. It's running the same script so how/why is it displaying the page as blank? Of the 4 computers I have tried this on, it can be reproduced 100% of the time on 2 of the 4 computers and it never happens on the other 2 computers. Firefox and Chrome have no problems displaying the pages. I have all error messages turned on but nothing is displayed Any ideas on why this is happening and how I can fix it? It is not only those article pages that aren't working but other pages on the site don't work as well (maybe 10% of about 50 different php script pages don't work in IE8 consistenly on those 2 computers and one of those pages is my registration page). What can I do? I'm worried that 10% of my users won't be able to access my website. The majority of users of the site will be using IE. Thanks for any suggestions EDIT View Source Some helpful people suggested to view the source. Viewing the source on the computer that shows blank vs the computer that shows the page properly is almost identical except the computer that shows blank has some garbled characters that show after the last tag. I'm not doing anything to do with anything Turkish and also the computers giving me problems are in Taiwan and the browsers are in Mandarin (Chinese).

@TITLE:What do you think about designing an HTML table by using div?
@CONTENT:I have seen many HTML table related questions in SO. Many questions about browser specific bugs like CSS and JavaScript by involving HTML table is usually asked. A earlier version of DataTable YUI markup looks like as follows: // dynamically generated
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Some content</td>
        <td>Other content</td>
    </tr>
</table>
 Current version now looks like // dynamically generated
<table>
    <tr>
        <td><div>Some content</div></td>
        <td><div>Other content</div></td>
    </tr>
</table>
 Notice a div inserted inside a column. <div> advantages includes stable behavior and event support across browser JavaScript framework support display block by default easy to create and insert inside a HTML page You can think a HTML table element as follows <div class="collection">
    <div class="row">
        <div>Some content</div>
        <div>Other content</div>
    </div>
</div>
 I need it because i have designed a custom "like a table" component by using div. My custom "like a table" component purpose is to show tabular data. Stable behavior and event support (single and double-click in a row and a column) across many browsers is one feature that i have considered. Notice, for instance, ExtJS uses a custom "like a select" component by using div. And you know many bugs related to HTML select So what you think about design a HTML table by using div ? regards,
@CODE:// dynamically generated
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Some content</td>
        <td>Other content</td>
    </tr>
</table> // dynamically generated

        <td><div>Some content</div></td>

@CONTENT:I'm at a complete loss, a form just changed behavior on me; it was working and then just stopped for no apparent reason. I'm opening it from a button: DoCmd.openForm "formName", , , "ID=" & Me.ID
 Debug tracing shows that the value is set properly at this point. When the form loads, I need to set a few display items, using the OnCurrent event. Private sub Form_Current()
    if Me.NewRecord Then
 At that point, it says there's no record, debugging info says the recordset is BOF and EOF, as if the query didn't match. But if I run the saved query at that moment, it displays the right info. Furthermore, if I stop the execution, leaving the form open, and then hit the button again, it does load the data properly. I'm stumped. Edit - After importing the form from a backup, and retyping the changes, the whole problem went away. I'm guessing corruption, but it's a mystery how it can screw up like that.

 The reason why its so long is the saReplacement, hrmsAdminReplacement, hrManagerReplacement and payrollAdminReplacement can all be null, so I put in a check to ensure they are not null so the rest of the clause does not get executed. But for some reason, when I run the first query, I don't get ANY results, but if I run the second one (MUCH LESS EFFICIENT) I get all the expected results. Is this a bug in Hibernate's HQL or am I losing my mind?

@TITLE:problems with jQuery mouseover for better looking css menu
@CONTENT:I have a horizontal menu on my site using nice-menus in drupal. When you hover over an li element, a background image is set for the link that displays. The problem I'm having is that this image disappears when you hover over a parent menu item's children. The image that is disappearing is set using this css style:   ul.nice-menu li a:hover, ul.nice-menu li.active a {
    background: url(images/bg-li-active.png) no-repeat scroll left bottom;
  }

  ul.nice-menu li * a:hover, ul.nice-menu li.active * a {
    background: none repeat;
    color:#000000;
  }
 I have set up jsbin to test this: http://jsbin.com/ogegu It looks like it works as expected. The menu expands, and only the parent element seems to be altered when over the child ul. However when I use code that actually attempts to set the background image, the png does not appear. the menu looks like this (check out the jsbin demo at http://jsbin.com/ogegu ): <div class="content">  
  <ul class="nice-menu nice-menu-down" id="nice-menu-1"><li id="menu-240" class="menu-path-front"><a href="/" title="" class="active">Home</a></li>  
    <li id="menu-660" class="menu-path-node-20"><a href="/content/about-us" title="About Us">About Us</a></li>  
    <li id="menu-238" class="menuparent menu-path-node-3"> 
      <a href="/services" title="">Services</a> 
      <ul> 
        <li id="menu-988" class="menu-path-node-29"><a href="/content/business-advisory" title="Business Advisory">Business Advisory</a></li>

    <li id="menu-631" class="menu-path-principals"><a href="/principals">Principals</a></li>  
  </ul>  
</div>
 Here is the actual JavaScript that I am trying to use: jQuery(document).ready(function(){
  jQuery('#nice-menu-1 li ul').hide();
  jQuery('#nice-menu-1 li.menuparent').hover(function() {
      jQuery(this).children('ul').show('fast');
      jQuery(this).children('a:eq(0)').css({ "background": "url(images/bg-li-active.png) no-repeat scroll left bottom"});
      return false;
  },
  function() {
      jQuery(this).children('ul').hide('fast');
      jQuery(this).children('a:eq(0)').css({"background": "none"});
      return false;
  });
});
 I am fairly new to using jQuery, can anyone offer a suggestion as to why this isn't doing what I'd expect? Ideally, I would like any hover or mouseover on the menuparent or menuparent's children to set the background of the first a tag that is a child. Even better, would be a solution that uses only css and no JavaScript.
@CODE:ul.nice-menu li a:hover, ul.nice-menu li.active a {
    background: url(images/bg-li-active.png) no-repeat scroll left bottom;
  }

  ul.nice-menu li * a:hover, ul.nice-menu li.active * a {

@TITLE:Programatically closing currently displayed Java Swing JDialog box
@CONTENT:Hi there I am working on an Java Swing application that performs a search on a database. It has 2 JDialog boxes that popup during the search. The first tells the user that the search has started and has an OK button to close. The second tells the user that the search has returned and is also closed by hitting the OK button. I there a way of closing the first JDialog box programatically, when the search returns, it's it will be pretty obvious that the seach was started by the time the search has returned. Thanks.

@TITLE:Getting an incorrect file extension and content type when uploading file
@CONTENT:I have an asp.net application where the users can upload files to our database. Sometimes when they upload the files, the content-type is set as "application/octet-stream" which is a binary file. When I ask the user, they say that they uploaded they say it was a .tif file. Somehow the upload control sets it as "application/octet-stream". When I upload the same .tif file from my computer it uploads with the correct content type (application/octet-stream). I am using the following code to get the file extension fileExtension = filUpload.PostedFile.FileName.Substring(filUpload.PostedFile.FileName.LastIndexOf(".") + 1)
 sometimes it returns the file extension as "c:\documen" or "j:\testing" etc. I know that windows doesn't allow special characters in the filename.
@CODE:content-type "application/octet-stream" .tif "application/octet-stream" .tif application/octet-stream fileExtension = filUpload.PostedFile.FileName.Substring(filUpload.PostedFile.FileName.LastIndexOf(".") + 1) "c:\documen" "j:\testing"

I had an application where when user run the program, it'll store values to database. In the Form Application, it runs well(no doubt). Now with the same approach, i want it to be run it in the console application. So, I create new project in console and just copy, do some editing on the codes and put in Main. Luckily, the code running well. My concerns are, is it what i'm doing is write? the command for the form can be used in console? What are differences between this two? is this the better approached? Any advice and references are very helpful.

@TITLE:Linked Measure Groups and Local Dimensions
@CONTENT:Mulling over something I've been reading up on. According to Chris Webb, A linked measure group can only be used with dimensions from the same database as the source measure group. So I took this to mean as long as two cubes share a database, a linked measure group can be used with a dimension. So I created a new cube and added a local measure group, a local dimension and a linked measure group. However, I can't create a relationship between the linked measure group and the local dimension even though they are within the same database. I get the message below: Regular relationships in the current database between non-linked (local) dimensions and linked measure groups cannot be edited. These relationship can only be created through the wizard. This dialog can be used to delete these relationships. I see that I can go to the original cube and add the dimension there, but does the message below mean I have an alternative? I just know it's going to be something simple and trivial! Thanks for reading.

@TITLE:ErrorProvider(from Windows Forms) for ASP.net & linq-to-sql?
@CONTENT:I am trying to figure out how to notify the user which field failed to validate. I setup LINQ to SQL class datacontext to access a database from ASP.net pages. Since user input will be from by web interface forms and import from Excel files, i would like the write the validation logic in one place. The idea behind this is when i import from excel. I will collect the error messages for each row, and display a summary, somehow. A logical place seems to extend the class generated by LINQ to SQL. According to most documentation and examples, i should do something like this: public partial class Customer 
{
  partial void OnTitleChanging(string value) 
  {
    if (!Char.IsUpper(value[0])) {
      throw new ValidationException(
       "Title must start with an uppercase letter.");}
  }
}
 The problem with this approach is that validation will stop on the first failed field. In Windows Forms Link1, if I define an ErrorProvider component in the form and set the DataSource property of it to your BindingSource the exception will be indicated by a red circle right to the validated control. The tooltip of this red circle will show the exception message. Is there something similar for ASP.net pages? I am using the listview control and inline editing in the listview. Updates: - I actually did something similar to what Nick Carver is suggesting. Link2 . Instead of throwing an exception, i record an error message. public partial class PQSSClassesDataContext    
{
public partial class ErrorFeilds
  {
      private static List<string> Messages = new List<string>();
      public void AddErrorMessage(string message)
      {
          Messages.Add(message);
      }
      public List<string> GetErrorMessages() 
      {
          return Messages;
      }
  }
}
 I am actually stuck on how to map the error message to the field. That's why i was looking for something like ErrorProvider. I am already using events instead of exceptions to record errors. Any idea how to mark the corresponding failed field from the codebehind file? Any help appreciated.
@CODE:public partial class Customer 
{
  partial void OnTitleChanging(string value) 
  {
    if (!Char.IsUpper(value[0])) {

@CONTENT:How can you get many tags for a question effectively from Postgres database by PHP? I have tables tags and questions where I have the variables questions_question_id and question_id, respectively, for instance. One question may have many tags. I can select question_id, title and a tag from the tables. However, I do not know how to get many tags for one question out of the database effectively. PHP restricts me in manipulating the data as matrices. I can read question_id, title and tag to the variable $result. The data is a matrix for me in the variale $result. However, I cannot refer to the data like to a matrix. I have only found the functions pg_fetch_row and pg_fetch_all_columns in PHP. The former gets the data as arrays for rows, while the latter as arrays for columns. My problem with LEFT JOIN suggests me that it may not be possible to get the data as follows get the columns for *title, question_id* and tag group the data by question_id such that I can put tags to my questions: I have tried to manipulate the data by PHP, but I get only this far.

An example: We would like to display a 'Shutdown in 5 minutes' warning to the users. The windows service would detect this condition, and start up a process in each user session that starts the windows app that displays the warning. And, yes, I know there are other ways of displaying a warning dialog, this is the example, what we want to do is much more invasive.

@TITLE:In Zend_Auth, can I get a domain-model User object instead of stdClass?
@CONTENT:While working on the login part of an application, I find myself running into an issue: My model is based on Active Record, by extending Zend_Db_Table_Row objects. Whenever I have to deal with a user, I'd want to do this through the User object (being an extended table row). However, Zend_Auth_Adapter_DbTable::getResultRowObject() returns a stdClass and I can not find a way to tell Zend_Auth_Adapter_DbTable to use a specific Db_Table. My three options that I've found so far: Write a custom Zend_Auth_Adapter, to return the proper class object (using Zend_Db_Table internally). After authentication perform some reading of the stdClass and some writing of the User object - can you create a Zend_Db_Table_Row class without actually using the Zend_Db_Table to create it? Move away from Active Record into complete Domain Driven development, separating my data access away from the user object. Then write a second mapper to fill the User object with stdClass instead of the table row. My two questions: Which of these would you recommend? And is there something I am missing? I'd hate to do any of these and then find out I'm missing something obvious in the Framework. Does anyone know if there is a 'proper' way to be doing this? Regards, Sander

  if(node.localName()=="a"){
    //I was hoping to be able to sort the <e> children of the node variable here
    xmlListCollectionVar.addItem(node);
  }
}

So far if I try: node.children().sort=someSortVar where someSortVar has its fields set to: SortFields("e.@prop",...) I get an exception about a null value. Any way to convert the children list to XMLListCollection, sort it and integrate it back into the node variable? Thanks for any replies.

When the user selects the record, I'd like to forward them to a custom built URL, based on that record's ID. How should I do this? Thanks! -Elliot To be more specific. I'm trying to make a simple search form, that redirects right to the record filled in by the autocomplete. If the record does not exist, I'd either like a message saying it doesn't yet exist, or a create record page. UPDATE: This may be more helpful, how can I just grab the value currently in the text box?

@CONTENT:I've got a Hibernate model that uses a custom type to represent boolean fields (ie, model has a 'Boolean' object, but the database writes a 0 or 1 to a TINYINT field. Changing the value of the boolean object from (true to false or false to true) will change the value on the object, but the Hibernate session manager doesn't seem to think the object had any values change, and therefore save() does not actually write SQL to the DB. Do I need to do something special in my custom type to get it to see changes? I'd prefer that to forcing each object to 'dirty' itself in accessors, but that's also possible.

While debugging (F5) I occasionally get a random "error writing to protected memory" notice, and it's usually fine for a bit after I restart the version of Visual Studio. Once in a while it takes a windows Reboot. So I'm assuming I need to specify somewhere a larger memory size for windows to set aside and then collect later. Thoughts?

@LINK:/questions/1266723/javascript-not-comparing-minimum-greater-than-maximum-number-values
@TITLE:JavaScript not comparing minimum greater than maximum number values
@CONTENT:Why is "greater than" comparisons for number values in JavaScript not working. The example below keeps returning true even when the mini number is less than the maxi. mini and maxi are form input values. This example is using jQuery to get the values, but could easily be stripped. var mini = $('form#filterPrice input.min').val(); //eg. 500
var maxi = $('form#filterPrice input.max').val(); //eg. 1500

if( mini.valueOf() > maxi.valueOf() ) { //also used: mini > maxi
    alert('test'); //alerts "test" even when mini is less than maxi
$('form#filterPrice input.min').val( maxi ); //should switch values if mini > maxi
$('form#filterPrice input.max').val( mini );
}
 Replacing "mini > maxi" with "Math.max(mini, maxi) == mini" works fine. So, the following does work: var mini = $('form#filterPrice input.min').val(); //eg. 500
var maxi = $('form#filterPrice input.max').val(); //eg. 1500

if( Math.max(mini, maxi) == mini ) {
    alert('test'); 
$('form#filterPrice input.min').val( maxi );
$('form#filterPrice input.max').val( mini );
}
@CODE:var mini = $('form#filterPrice input.min').val(); //eg. 500
var maxi = $('form#filterPrice input.max').val(); //eg. 1500

if( mini.valueOf() > maxi.valueOf() ) { //also used: mini > maxi
    alert('test'); //alerts "test" even when mini is less than maxi
$('form#filterPrice input.min').val( maxi ); //should switch values if mini > maxi
$('form#filterPrice input.max').val( mini );
} var mini = $('form#filterPrice input.min').val(); //eg. 500
var maxi = $('form#filterPrice input.max').val(); //eg. 1500

if( Math.max(mini, maxi) == mini ) {
    alert('test'); 
$('form#filterPrice input.min').val( maxi );

The problem I'm encountering is that when I try to stop the service through Service Manager, it crashes. I added some MessageBoxes code, to trace where they are crashing and I found that when it closes the listener socket it crashes!!! I tried to run the service as a console application, and by myself called the function which is called SERVICE__CONTROL__STOP event is received so that I may reproduce the bug and debug easily. But it is working fine. The windows service is only crashing when I stop it through Service Manager Here is some code The main function int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{   
 // Create the service object
    CTestService CustomServiceObject;

    if (!AfxWinInit(::GetModuleHandle(NULL), NULL, ::GetCommandLine(), 0))

    {
        // StartService() calls ::StartServiceCtrlDispatcher() 
    // with the ServiceMain func and stuff
        CustomServiceObject.StartService();
    }

    // When we get here, the service has been stopped

 EDIT: If a connection is made (client connects to the server) and the client closes the connection and then the service is stopped nothing crashes. It only crashes if the socket is listening and no connection is accepted or the client doesnt closes the connection and the service is stopped :) I guess its clear!

This one big string contains the xml code. What I want to do is extract the email address from this string with the xml code in it. I can't use the methods in the string api as they require you to specify the sarting index which I don't know as it varies each time. What I was hoping to do was search the string for a sub-string starting with (e.g. "<email id>") and ending with (e.g. "</email id>") and add the string between these strings to a seperate string. Does anyone know if this is possible to do or if there is an easier/different way of doing what I want to do? Thanks.

@TITLE:Temporary tables, sessions and logging in SQL Server?
@CONTENT:My problem is that I have context which (currently) exists only in my application. I'd like to push this context to the database, say, if there was such as thing as custom SQL Server connection properties, I would wanna use that. My idea was to create a # local temporary table with the context information prior to any work (application specific SQL) being executed and to write triggers that would fetch information from this temporary and summarize that in a general purpose logging table. I've read --while trying to figure this out-- that with temporary tables there's the notion of a session in SQL Server. However, I have not been able to find any documentation regarding what exactly constitutes as a SQL Server session. I'd like some insight on who to best push context onto the database (from an application) and then do something with it. e.g. triggers and such. I'm using Linq2Sql for my database objects and I'm a bit unsure how I would be able to hook this up so that for each DataContext.SubmitChanges the appropriate context is set for each connection involved. In my mind, this should equate to some custom SQL being executed just before SubmitChanges but in practice DataContext.ExecuteCommand and SubmitChanges are two different things and what guarantee do I have, that it's the same connection or (session as it's being referred to in the SQL Server documentation on MSDN). Update: Details The application is a web application, the context is some properties in conjunction with an authenticated user (a.k.a. ASP.NET session state items). I'm using connection pooling by default, I have on intent of disabling this. The solution does not have to be flexible, but it will have to be robust (this is why I move things into the database server, the purpose of this is to maintain dependable auditing information).

@CONTENT:I am trying to open a web page with a Silverlight App from a batch file on a Windows Server 2008 box. If I put this in the batch file: start iexplore http://www.google.com
 The google page shows. If I put this in the batch file (where TestPage has a Silverlight Application): start iexplore http://www.mysite.com/Configure/TestPage.html
 the page shows but with the "Download Silverlight" icon/link. If I browse to that page manually the app shows. Any ideas on how to get around this? I am trying to run my Silverlight tests (actually using PowerShell but the symptoms are the same and a batch file is easier to explain) on a our build machine which is a Windows Server 2008 box. Edit: It looks like this is because the batch script is running the 64bit version of IE. When I launch the link as a user I get the 32bit version. In my PoweShell script I am using this to get to IE: $ie = new-object -com "InternetExplorer.Application"
 -but it too is getting the 64 bit version. So really, my question has become how do I get to the 32 bit version of IE via COM?

@CONTENT:I'm using LINQ, but my database tables do not have an IDENTITY column (although they are using a surrogate Primary Key ID column) Can this work? To get the identity values for a table, there is a stored procedure called GetIDValueForOrangeTable(), which looks at a SystemValues table and increments the ID therein. Is there any way I can get LINQ to get the ID value from this SystemValues table on an insert, rather than the built in IDENTITY? As an aside, I don't think this is a very good idea, especially not for a web application. I imagine there will be a lot of concurrency conflicts because of this SystemValues lookup. Am I justified in my concern? Cheers Duncan

@TITLE:Correct usage of MySQL LOAD_FILE()
@CONTENT:I apologize if this is a dense question, but I'm having a bit of trouble using MYSQL LOAD_FILE() in conjunction with prepared statements in order to upload an image BLOB. As a result, I'm having to resort to using to separate queries, one to prepare a statement for details, and another, which doesn't prepare the statement to insert my BLOB. Here's an example of the query I've tried: function add_new_video() {
    $image = $_FILES['thumbnail_file']['tmp_name']; // pass this file name to getimagesize() to determine the mime-type
    $size_array = getimagesize($image);
    $thumbnail_mimetype = $size_array['mime'];
    $thumbnail_contents = file_get_contents($image);
    $thumbnail_filesize = $size_array[3];
    $thumbnail_filename = $_FILES['thumbnail_file']['name'];

	$title = $_POST['title'];
	$summary = $_POST['summary'];
        // Checkbox...  	
        if(!empty($_POST['demo_reel'])) {
		$demo_reel = $_POST['demo_reel'];
	}
	else {
		$demo_reel = 0;
	}

	$query = "INSERT INTO videos (title, summary, thumbnail_filename, thumbnail_filesize, thumbnail_mimetype, thumbnail_contents, demo_reel) VALUES(?, ?, ?, ?, ?, LOAD_FILE($image), ?)";
	if($stmt = $this->conn->prepare($query)) {
		$stmt->bind_param('sssssi', $title, $summary, $thumbnail_filename, $thumbnail_filesize, $thumbnail_mimetype, $thumbnail_contents, $demo_reel);
		$stmt->execute();
		if($stmt->affected_rows == 1) {
			return true;
		}
		else {
			return false;
		}
	}
}
 Unfortunately, this query fails, and I can't seem to get any errors out of it. Conversely, here's my current query, which works, but doesn't use prepared statements, and is less secure:     $video_filename = $_POST['file_name'];
    $video_number = $_POST['number'];
    $title = $_POST['title'];
    $summary = $_POST['summary'];
    if(!empty($_POST['demo_reel']))	{
	$demo_reel = $_POST['demo_reel'];
   }
   else {
	$demo_reel = 0;
   }


    $image = $_FILES['thumbnail_file']['tmp_name']; // pass this file name to      
    getimagesize() to determine the mime-type
	$size_array = getimagesize($image);
	$thumbnail_mimetype = $size_array['mime'];
	$thumbnail_filesize = $size_array[3];
	$thumbnail_contents = addslashes(file_get_contents($image));
	$thumbnail_filename = $_POST['number'] . '.jpg';

    $query = "INSERT INTO videos (`video_filename`, `video_number`,
    `thumbnail_contents`, `title`, `summary`, `demo_reel`, `thumbnail_filename`,     
    `thumbnail_filesize`, `thumbnail_mimetype`) VALUES ('$video_filename',

  if($result = $this->conn->query($query)) {		
     return true;
  }
  else {
    return false;
  }
 As all of the details are currently unescaped, and I would rather not go through the process of using nl2br() and back again, I'm thinking of two queries: one using prepared statements for the $_POST variables, and then another using addslashes() and regular statements for the file. I'd like to be able to do the entire insert in one prepared statement. Any help and understanding is greatly appreciated!

@TITLE:Setting Focus on DataGridView Control programmatically in Visual Basic
@CONTENT:I want to programmatically set the focus to the last row (bottommost, its only one column wide) in the DataGridView control for Visual Basic. How can I do so? So far, I have tried DGV.Rows.GetLastRow(DataGridViewElementStates.Selected)
 without success, though I did not expect that to work. It absolutely must select that last cell. Otherwise, the application is nearly impossible to use! Here is a screenshot of what I am making with this: http://www.mediafire.com/?mmyogzytgzt The "Paste Clipboard Contents" button only pastes into the selected cell, though I guess I could find a workaround.

@CONTENT:I've mentioned it on here before, but still have the problem, so have added some extra info :) We have a local intranet site that everyone on the network uses, maybe 5% (or even less) of the users that use the site have problems where the session isn't stored properly. I've tried defining a path manually and whereas most users sessions are created and remain just fine, on the affected machines it seems that it either forgets the cookies are there, or it can't read them, and then goes on to create a new cookie almost every time you refresh a page. Things to note are... happens on both the Zend login screen and our systems, so for once it's not my dodgy code! it only affects <5% of users it only happens when using IE it only happens with Windows XP or Vista - Windows 2000 works fine! it happens to those users on any XP/Vista machine, so I can use my bosses PC and it's fine, but if he uses mine it doesn't work again... I've tried messing with the security settings in IE too, changing the cookie security to allow all cookies/sessions, but no luck on that either unfortunately. :( I've tried nettool but it didn't really help much unfortunately, since it just showed that the new cookies/sessions were being created, but didn't say why. I've also tried checking the date and times are on the same on the server as they are on the workstation, and yup everything is set fine. The name of the server is 'gc-hr01' - not sure if that should affect anything like this. Any help would be amazing, really stuck on this. Thanks!

@LINK:/questions/1266723/javascript-not-comparing-minimum-greater-than-maximum-number-values
@TITLE:JavaScript not comparing minimum greater than maximum number values
@CONTENT:Why is "greater than" comparisons for number values in JavaScript not working. The example below keeps returning true even when the mini number is less than the maxi. mini and maxi are form input values. This example is using jQuery to get the values, but could easily be stripped. var mini = $('form#filterPrice input.min').val(); //eg. 500
var maxi = $('form#filterPrice input.max').val(); //eg. 1500

if( mini.valueOf() > maxi.valueOf() ) { //also used: mini > maxi
    alert('test'); //alerts "test" even when mini is less than maxi
$('form#filterPrice input.min').val( maxi ); //should switch values if mini > maxi
$('form#filterPrice input.max').val( mini );
}
 Replacing "mini > maxi" with "Math.max(mini, maxi) == mini" works fine. So, the following does work: var mini = $('form#filterPrice input.min').val(); //eg. 500
var maxi = $('form#filterPrice input.max').val(); //eg. 1500

if( Math.max(mini, maxi) == mini ) {
    alert('test'); 
$('form#filterPrice input.min').val( maxi );
$('form#filterPrice input.max').val( mini );
}
@CODE:var mini = $('form#filterPrice input.min').val(); //eg. 500
var maxi = $('form#filterPrice input.max').val(); //eg. 1500

if( mini.valueOf() > maxi.valueOf() ) { //also used: mini > maxi
    alert('test'); //alerts "test" even when mini is less than maxi
$('form#filterPrice input.min').val( maxi ); //should switch values if mini > maxi
$('form#filterPrice input.max').val( mini );
} var mini = $('form#filterPrice input.min').val(); //eg. 500
var maxi = $('form#filterPrice input.max').val(); //eg. 1500

if( Math.max(mini, maxi) == mini ) {

@CONTENT:I have an aspx page that contains regular html, some uicomponents, and multiple tokens of the form {tokenname} . When the page loads, I want to parse the page content and replace these tokens with the correct content. The idea is that there will be multiple template pages using the same codebehind. I've no trouble parsing the string data itself, (see named string formatting, replace tokens in template) my trouble lies in when to read, and how to write the data back to the page... What's the best way for me to rewrite the page content? I've been using a streamreader, and the replacing the page with Response.Write, but this is no good - a page containing other .net components does not render correctly. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

@CONTENT:What I am doing is validating URLs from my code. So I have a file with url's in it and I want to see if they exist or not. If they exist, the web page contains xml code in which there will be an email address I want to extract. I go round a while loop and in each instance, if the url exists, The xml is added to a string. This one big string contains the xml code. What I want to do is extract the email address from this string with the xml code in it. I can't use the methods in the string api as they require you to specify the sarting index which I don't know as it varies each time. What I was hoping to do was search the string for a sub-string starting with (e.g. "<email id>") and ending with (e.g. "</email id>") and add the string between these strings to a seperate string. Does anyone know if this is possible to do or if there is an easier/different way of doing what I want to do? Thanks.

@TITLE:Temporary tables, sessions and logging in SQL Server?
@CONTENT:My problem is that I have context which (currently) exists only in my application. I'd like to push this context to the database, say, if there was such as thing as custom SQL Server connection properties, I would wanna use that. My idea was to create a # local temporary table with the context information prior to any work (application specific SQL) being executed and to write triggers that would fetch information from this temporary and summarize that in a general purpose logging table. I've read --while trying to figure this out-- that with temporary tables there's the notion of a session in SQL Server. However, I have not been able to find any documentation regarding what exactly constitutes as a SQL Server session. I'd like some insight on who to best push context onto the database (from an application) and then do something with it. e.g. triggers and such. I'm using Linq2Sql for my database objects and I'm a bit unsure how I would be able to hook this up so that for each DataContext.SubmitChanges the appropriate context is set for each connection involved. In my mind, this should equate to some custom SQL being executed just before SubmitChanges but in practice DataContext.ExecuteCommand and SubmitChanges are two different things and what guarantee do I have, that it's the same connection or (session as it's being referred to in the SQL Server documentation on MSDN). Update: Details The application is a web application, the context is some properties in conjunction with an authenticated user (a.k.a. ASP.NET session state items). I'm using connection pooling by default, I have on intent of disabling this. The solution does not have to be flexible, but it will have to be robust (this is why I move things into the database server, the purpose of this is to maintain dependable auditing information).

@CONTENT:I am trying to open a web page with a Silverlight App from a batch file on a Windows Server 2008 box. If I put this in the batch file: start iexplore http://www.google.com
 The google page shows. If I put this in the batch file (where TestPage has a Silverlight Application): start iexplore http://www.mysite.com/Configure/TestPage.html
 the page shows but with the "Download Silverlight" icon/link. If I browse to that page manually the app shows. Any ideas on how to get around this? I am trying to run my Silverlight tests (actually using PowerShell but the symptoms are the same and a batch file is easier to explain) on a our build machine which is a Windows Server 2008 box. Edit: It looks like this is because the batch script is running the 64bit version of IE. When I launch the link as a user I get the 32bit version. In my PoweShell script I am using this to get to IE: $ie = new-object -com "InternetExplorer.Application"
 -but it too is getting the 64 bit version. So really, my question has become how do I get to the 32 bit version of IE via COM?

@CONTENT:I'm using LINQ, but my database tables do not have an IDENTITY column (although they are using a surrogate Primary Key ID column) Can this work? To get the identity values for a table, there is a stored procedure called GetIDValueForOrangeTable(), which looks at a SystemValues table and increments the ID therein. Is there any way I can get LINQ to get the ID value from this SystemValues table on an insert, rather than the built in IDENTITY? As an aside, I don't think this is a very good idea, especially not for a web application. I imagine there will be a lot of concurrency conflicts because of this SystemValues lookup.

@CONTENT:I apologize if this is a dense question, but I'm having a bit of trouble using MYSQL LOAD_FILE() in conjunction with prepared statements in order to upload an image BLOB. As a result, I'm having to resort to using to separate queries, one to prepare a statement for details, and another, which doesn't prepare the statement to insert my BLOB. Here's an example of the query I've tried: function add_new_video() {
    $image = $_FILES['thumbnail_file']['tmp_name']; // pass this file name to getimagesize() to determine the mime-type
    $size_array = getimagesize($image);
    $thumbnail_mimetype = $size_array['mime'];
    $thumbnail_contents = file_get_contents($image);
    $thumbnail_filesize = $size_array[3];
    $thumbnail_filename = $_FILES['thumbnail_file']['name'];

	$title = $_POST['title'];
	$summary = $_POST['summary'];
        // Checkbox...  	
        if(!empty($_POST['demo_reel'])) {
		$demo_reel = $_POST['demo_reel'];
	}
	else {
		$demo_reel = 0;
	}

	$query = "INSERT INTO videos (title, summary, thumbnail_filename, thumbnail_filesize, thumbnail_mimetype, thumbnail_contents, demo_reel) VALUES(?, ?, ?, ?, ?, LOAD_FILE($image), ?)";
	if($stmt = $this->conn->prepare($query)) {
		$stmt->bind_param('sssssi', $title, $summary, $thumbnail_filename, $thumbnail_filesize, $thumbnail_mimetype, $thumbnail_contents, $demo_reel);
		$stmt->execute();
		if($stmt->affected_rows == 1) {
			return true;
		}
		else {
			return false;
		}
	}
}
 Unfortunately, this query fails, and I can't seem to get any errors out of it. Conversely, here's my current query, which works, but doesn't use prepared statements, and is less secure:     $video_filename = $_POST['file_name'];
    $video_number = $_POST['number'];
    $title = $_POST['title'];
    $summary = $_POST['summary'];
    if(!empty($_POST['demo_reel']))	{
	$demo_reel = $_POST['demo_reel'];
   }
   else {
	$demo_reel = 0;
   }


    $image = $_FILES['thumbnail_file']['tmp_name']; // pass this file name to      
    getimagesize() to determine the mime-type
	$size_array = getimagesize($image);
	$thumbnail_mimetype = $size_array['mime'];
	$thumbnail_filesize = $size_array[3];
	$thumbnail_contents = addslashes(file_get_contents($image));
	$thumbnail_filename = $_POST['number'] . '.jpg';

    $query = "INSERT INTO videos (`video_filename`, `video_number`,
    `thumbnail_contents`, `title`, `summary`, `demo_reel`, `thumbnail_filename`,

  if($result = $this->conn->query($query)) {		
     return true;
  }
  else {
    return false;
  }
 As all of the details are currently unescaped, and I would rather not go through the process of using nl2br() and back again, I'm thinking of two queries: one using prepared statements for the $_POST variables, and then another using addslashes() and regular statements for the file. I'd like to be able to do the entire insert in one prepared statement. Any help and understanding is greatly appreciated!

@TITLE:ASP.NET/Javascript: Loading huge data in browser
@CONTENT:I have this GUI that shows, let's say Customer Orders. When my client nailed down the requirements, he asked me to keep pagination like this, Show Items Per Page : 10/50/150 For each customer there could be thousands of orders and each order will have atleast 50 attributes to show up in the screen. So, assume a 50 column html table with 2000 or 3000 records associated with it spanning across multiple database tables (anyway, this is a different story) Things were breeze until yesterday, now my client has come up with new change requests, in that he specified Show Items like this, Show Items Per Page : 10/50/150/All Yes, he wanted to see 2000 or 3000 records by just select "All" option. Internally, this is not a big change, I would go back and remove the filters I apply on rowcount etc., but when it is loaded in GUI it really sucks ... view state was huge etc., etc., I know, this is a standard problem. How you guys deal with it? I cannot convince my client to remove this "All" option, he got stick to it. (the reason is simple, he got a big 42" screen where he can easily see 1000 items in one page) I also tried to use javacript to prepare DOM in a ajax call .. but still, inserting 2000 TDs is really slow.

@CONTENT:I've mentioned it on here before, but still have the problem, so have added some extra info :) We have a local intranet site that everyone on the network uses, maybe 5% (or even less) of the users that use the site have problems where the session isn't stored properly. I've tried defining a path manually and whereas most users sessions are created and remain just fine, on the affected machines it seems that it either forgets the cookies are there, or it can't read them, and then goes on to create a new cookie almost every time you refresh a page. Things to note are... happens on both the Zend login screen and our systems, so for once it's not my dodgy code! it only affects <5% of users it only happens when using IE it only happens with Windows XP or Vista - Windows 2000 works fine! it happens to those users on any XP/Vista machine, so I can use my bosses PC and it's fine, but if he uses mine it doesn't work again... I've tried messing with the security settings in IE too, changing the cookie security to allow all cookies/sessions, but no luck on that either unfortunately. :( I've tried nettool but it didn't really help much unfortunately, since it just showed that the new cookies/sessions were being created, but didn't say why. I've also tried checking the date and times are on the same on the server as they are on the workstation, and yup everything is set fine. The name of the server is 'gc-hr01' - not sure if that should affect anything like this. Any help would be amazing, really stuck on this. Thanks!

@LINK:/questions/1241080/problem-with-c-callback-function-in-c-sharp-how-to-pass-value-to-a-pointer
@TITLE:Problem with C callback function in C# - how to pass value to a pointer?
@CONTENT:I've a C callback defined as follows: Int16 (CALLBACK *ProcessMessage)(Uint16 ServerId,
   const char PTR *RequestMsg, Uint32 RequestSize,
   char PTR **ResponseMsg, Uint32 PTR *ResponseSize,
   Int16 PTR *AppErrCode);
 An exemple of using this callback in C: 
Int16 CALLBACK ProcessMessage(Uint16 ServerId, const char PTR *RequestMsg, Uint32 RequestSize, char PTR **ResponseMsg, Uint32 PTR *ResponseSize, Int16 PTR *AppErrCode)
{
    printf("ProcessMessage() -> ServerId=%u\n", ServerId);

    //**** SET THE VALUE FOR RESPONSEMSG (POINTER), THAT'S WHAT I NEED TO DO IN C# ****       
    sprintf(resp,"(%05lu) REPLY TEST", ServerId);
    *ResponseMsg = resp;

    printf("ProcessMessage() -> atribuido %p(p) a *ResponseMsg\n", *ResponseMsg);
    *ResponseSize = strlen(*ResponseMsg);
    *AppErrCode = -1; 
    return SS_OK;
}
 Then I've this callback implemented in C#:  [DllImport("Custom.dll", SetLastError = true)]
    static extern Int16 SS_Initialize(
        UInt16[] ServerIds,
        UInt16 ServerQty,
        [MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.LPStr)] string Binding,
        [MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.LPStr)] string LogPath,
        UInt16 LogDays,
        Int16 LogLevel,
        UInt16 MaxThreads,
        UInt16 MaxConThread,
        ProcessMessageCallback callback);
 Callback definition: public delegate Int16 ProcessMessageCallback(
        UInt16 ServerId,
        [MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.LPStr)] string RequestMsg,
        UInt32 RequestSize,
        [MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.LPStr)] ref string ResponseMsg,
        ref UInt32 ResponseSize,
        ref Int16 AppErrCode);
 Method that sets the callback: public void Call_SS_Initialize(
        UInt16[] serverIds,
        string binding,
        string logPath,
        UInt16 logDays,
        Int16 logLevel,
        UInt16 maxThreads,
        UInt16 maxConThread
        )
    {
        Int16 ret;
        try
        {
            pmc = new ProcessMessageCallback(ProcessMessage);

            ret = SS_Initialize(
                serverIds,
                Convert.ToUInt16(serverIds.ToList().Count),
                binding,
                logPath,
                logDays,
                logLevel,
                maxThreads,
                maxConThread,
                pmc);
        }
    }
 And finally the Callback method, where THE PROBLEM IS: public Int16 ProcessMessage(
      UInt16 ServerId,
      string RequestMsg,
      UInt32 RequestSize,
      ref string ResponseMsg,
      ref UInt32 ResponseSize,
      ref Int16 AppErrCode)
    {
       //Implement return to ResponseMsg POINTER
    }
 The problem is, ResponseMsg is actually a POINTER in C. So in the C# method ProcesMessage, I've to set to ResponseMsg a space in memory (pointer) from where the DLL will get the string from. I can't simply set ResponseMsg = "REPLY", because when the method finishes the memory where the string was is already destroyed. How can I do that?? Please any advise is welcome!! Thanks!
@CODE:Int16 (CALLBACK *ProcessMessage)(Uint16 ServerId,
   const char PTR *RequestMsg, Uint32 RequestSize,
   char PTR **ResponseMsg, Uint32 PTR *ResponseSize,
   Int16 PTR *AppErrCode); [DllImport("Custom.dll", SetLastError = true)]

When i use JSONP, such as getJSON in JQuery, it only supports GET protocol and it is not adequate for further processing. I wonder what other options i can try.

@TITLE:Multiple column articles in Joomla
@CONTENT:I've got a client that requires that an article be displayed in two, sometimes three, columns in Joomla. I am fairly sure they won't be happy with having to edit 3 articles for 3 columns so the splitting would have to be done automatically. I've done something similar before where it'll split a chunk of HTML into n columns, but have no real idea how to accomplish this within Joomla itself. Any ideas gratefully recieved!

@CONTENT:I'm programming with Winsock2. I have two network adapters in system, one for local connections (LAN), one for outer connections (PPPOE). When I perform a connect() call to connect to local address, it uses PPPOE adapter instead of LAN. I know I could tweak this using metrics, but can't I just use some hard-code to forcibly use LAN adapter? Thanks in advance!

@TITLE:Drupal's profile_save_profile Doesn't Work in hook_cron, When Run by the Server's cron
@CONTENT:I have a problem with the following implementation of hook_cron in Drupal 6.1.3. The script below runs exactly as expected: it sends a welcome letter to new members, and updates a hidden field in their profile to designate that the letter has been sent. There are no errors in the letter, all new members are accounted for, etc. The problem is that the last line -- updating the profile -- doesn't seem to work when Drupal cron is invoked by the 'real' cron on the server. When I run cron manually (such as via /admin/reports/status/run-cron) the profile fields get updated as expected. Any suggestions as to what might be causing this? (Note, since someone will suggest it: members join by means outside of Drupal, and are uploaded to Drupal nightly, so Drupal's built-in welcome letters won't work (I think).) <?php
function foo_cron() {
    // Find users who have not received the new member letter, 
    // and send them a welcome email

                networkDriveMapper.MapDrive("B:", @"\\server\share", false);
 And then the private void mapDrive(string username, string password) method throws the Win32Exception with the error code 67 ... Anyone else using the the mpr.dll / WNetAddConnection2W entrypoint? And/Or knows how to circumvent/fix this error? Cheers and thanks, -J?rg Update: I originally had an Error 1204 ('The specified network provider name is invalid').. but the 2 answers so far kinda helped me a little bit, but not solved the entire problem of not being able to map network drives properly...

@TITLE:Setting correct printer in MS Word through automation
@CONTENT:I have the following automation code: lPrintSetup := fWordObject.Application.Dialogs.Item(wdDialogFilePrintSetup);
lPrintSetup.Printer := 'MyPrinter';
lPrintSetup.DoNotSetAsSysDefault := True;
lPrintSetup.Execute;
lPrintSetup := Null;
 The Printer property is giving me some problems, sometimes Execute crashes with an EOleException (0x800A1460 (error code 5216): There is a printer error) because of a wrong printername. I have printer information of all printers in a _PRINTER_INFO_2 record which I obtained by a EnumPrinters API-call. How can I compose the right printername for Word given the information in a _PRINTER_INFO_2 record? It has work with at least Windows 2000, Word 2000 and Citrix. Some background info: Our application first filled the Printername with a self constructed printername. This gave problems with Citrix clients, so for Citrix clients we took the _PRINTER_INFO_2.pPortName and deleted the Client:#: part. This is working for the majority of our customers, but sometimes still the printer error shows up. What I have tried so far (on Windows XP SP3, Word 2007): Just take the _PRINTER_INFO_2.pPrinterName. Problem is that when you modify printernames on purpose (renaming 'PDFCreator' to 'HP DESKJET 520 on MYPC') it crashes on the latter (while selecting this printer in Word works). Composing a printername like this: lPrintSetup.Printer := PRINTER_INFO_2.pPrinterName + ' on ' + PRINTER_INFO_2.pPortname. Seems to work always! But googling around showed that ' on ' is localized, so I'm not sure if that's going to work on non-english Windows versions. Edit: does not work always :( Another solution I found on the web: When reading the printername from Word it has the form of "Printername on Ne01:", where Ne01 is ranged from Ne00: to Ne99:. The solution suggested taking the printername and just try to set it while looping from Ne00: to Ne99:. When .Execute doesn't crash, you've got the right one. I'm not very fond of this 'trail and error' method.

 I'm expecting this unit-test to pass, but it pulls out the first service job and fails. I've also experienced problems using other sugar methods such as .Find().

Great product by the way, really impressed so far.

n -> 3n+1 (for odd n)
 So I got this far:` chain n     | n == 0       = error "What are you on about?"
            | n == 1       = error "Finished"
            | rem n 2 == 0 = chain (n `div` 2) 
            | rem n 2 /= 0 = chain (3 * n + 1)
 ` Will this work? But it only does the calculations behind the scenes, is there any way to make it display or export as list the result for n on each iteration until it reaches 1 so I can find the length of the list later? On a side note, is there any way to make GHCi begin in a specific folder ?(I'm using windows)

@LINK:/questions/1230164/comparing-linked-objects
@TITLE:Comparing Linked-objects
@CONTENT:I have some data from server which looks like this. Each row is an array so the data comes as an array of arrays: 
net      Person       age
net      Person       height

net      Address      streetname

org      Company      name
org      Company      location

com      School       color

com      School       number
 From left to right I loop through the array with two for loops and build a tree-like structure of each row(each element is a parent of its follower) like below. After each inner loop i add that particular tree(row tree-like) to the an ArrayList. So each object in the ArrayList is like a tree. As you can see below. 
+net
  Person
       age

+net
 Person
     height

+net
   Address
      streetname

+org
  Company
     name

+org
  Company
     location

+com
   School
       color

+com
  School
     number
 This is my main question After I have added the first object to the ArrayList, I would like to compare the subsequent objects in order to prevent duplicates. As you can see "Person" and "Address" has the same parent "net" so I would like both to be under the same parent so that there will be a single "net". You can also see that "age" and "height" also has the same parent "Person", I want both to go under "Person". "Company" will be under a single "org" and their children "name" and "location" will be under "Company". How can I compare them to achieve this behaviour? I implemented the tree-like structure in a form like a linked list as you have spotted already. //SUPER CLASS
public class Model {

    protected String name;
    protected Model parent = null;
    protected ArrayList<Model> children;

    public Model(String name ){
    	this.setName(name);
    	children = new ArrayList<Model>();
    }

    public void addChild(Model node) {
        children.add(node);       
    }

    public ArrayList<Model> getChildren() {
        return children;       
    }

}


// SUBCLASSES

public class cPackage extends Model{    
    public cPackage() {
    	super();
    }
}

public class cClass extends Model{
    public cClass () {
    	super();
    }
}

public class cMethod extends Model{
    public cMethod () {
    	super();
    }
}
 Each element in a row belongs to one of these subclasses. Each level of a the tree belongs to the same class. My main question now is, how can I compare them efficiently and bring the required objects under their appropriate parent? Please I need your ideas. If there is a code also I will appreciate that you add it to your suggestions or point me there. Thank you all.

@CONTENT:This is really weird behavior, let's say I have an asp.net mvc project as follow on my desktop (vista): /mvcapplication/app1 then over the course of development, I copy this solution to a briefcase on a thumbdrive so I can work on it from a laptop (xp). When I insert the thumbdrive back on the desktop, I notice it's taking longer and longer to sync, eventually it took so long that it just hangs there. I checked the project structure and found that it is now: /mvcapplication/app1/app1/app1/app1 with each /app1 containing the entire project structures. I am not new to visual studio, and I am sure I opened and saved the solution and files just as I normally did, but this is just bizzard. I thought this is caused by briefcase, but the same thing happened when I copied the solution into a folder on the thumbdrive. I would have left this alone, but with that sort of crazy folder structure it's really difficult to determine which folder has my current changes.. Anyone ever run into something like this?

@TITLE:Flex: Special-casing an item in a list or menu?
@CONTENT:I've found it's often useful to special case the first item in a drop-down menu (ie, an instance of Menu). For example, if I want to pick a color from the list provided by a web service: <mx:PopUpMenuButton id="colorSelelector"
    dataProvider="{colorsService.lastResult}" />
 I might also want a special-case, which is "enter a new color", allowing the user to enter the RGB values for a new color which isn't in the list. For example: var newColor = { label: "Enter a new color", rgb: null };
 Then used with: <mx:PopUpMenuButton id="colorSelelector"
    dataProvider="{colorsService.lastResult}"
    lastOption="{newColor}" />
 So, apart from changing the list I get back from the service, is there any better way to do this? (and just a preemptive comment: this is a simplification¡K I'm not actually trying to make a color-picking-list)

We are currently using the following, but this is not fast enough is there a better/efficient way to do it? using(MemoryStream stream = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes((string)cmd.ExecuteScalar()))
{
  XmlTextReader xmlReader;
  DataContractSerializer deserializer;

  deserializer = new DataContractSerializer(typeToDeserialize);
  xmlReader = new XmlTextReader(stream);
  return deserializer.ReadObject(xmlReader);
}
 I've als tried to do it with an SqlDataReader and GetBytes but then I get exceptions. Thanx in advance.
@CODE:using(MemoryStream stream = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes((string)cmd.ExecuteScalar()))
{
  XmlTextReader xmlReader;
  DataContractSerializer deserializer;

  deserializer = new DataContractSerializer(typeToDeserialize);
  xmlReader = new XmlTextReader(stream);
  return deserializer.ReadObject(xmlReader);

@TITLE:Big clickable areas on a web page
@CONTENT:Excuse me while I detach from reality.. I have a summary div which contains a small heading, a little bit of text, maybe an image. I'd like the whole summary div to be a link, something like this: <div class="summary">
  <a href="#">
    <h4>Small Heading</h4>
    <p>Small amount of text</p>
  </a>
</div>
 I'd then style the href to look like a nice box, change the H4 and P on :hover, etc etc. But putting an href there makes browsers angry. Can anyone suggest a way of achieving the same effect without resorting to Javascript? Is that even possible? Many thanks!

@CONTENT:I have a situation where I need to store a general piece of data (could be an int, float, or string) in my database, but I don't know ahead of time which it will be. I need a table (or less preferably tables) to store this unknown typed data. What I think I am going to do is have a column for each data type, only use one for each record and leave the others NULL. This requires some logic above the database, but this is not too much of a problem because I will be representing these records in models anyway. Basically, is there a best practice way to do something like this? I have not come up with anything that is less of a hack than this, but it seems like this is a somewhat common problem. Thanks in advance. EDIT: Also, is this considered 3NF?

@TITLE:How to force requests to be JSON? I.e. how to block XML body?
@CONTENT:I have a REST WCF service and a WCF client application for it. My operation has the WebGet attribute with the following properties: BodyStyle = WebMessageBodyStyle.Bare, ResponseFormat = WebMessageFormat.Json, RequestFormat = WebMessageFormat.Json However, when I use the WCF client, the request is made with the body in XML format! This is undesirable! How can I change it to use JSON? Furthermore, I want to prevent XML from being accepted on the server side, as well - how can I accomplish this? I would have expected specifying RequestFormat to do it but it appears to be just a suggestion? Edit: nevermind, I am an idiot. I was looking at the wrong operation contract - the right ones were inside a #region that I had not expanded... the client works fine. The server point is still valid but in the context of this question, it's probably for the better to consider this question closed.

@CONTENT:I get a "java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/hp/hpl/jena/shared/BadURIException" when running a very simple servlet. The error points back to the initialisation of the "Tagger" class. The code is as follows import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.PrintWriter;

import javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

import my.package.Tagger;

public class NormaliserServlet extends HttpServlet{
    public void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException{
    	Tagger pot = new Tagger("");

    	response.setContentType("text");
    	PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
    	out.println("hello");
        out.println(pot.someMethod());
    	out.close();

    	this.log("Request for normaliser");
    }
}
 The war file contains the jar file defining "Tagger" in WEB-INF/lib and a similar invocation works outside of a servlet. I can't seem to find what the problem would be. The web.xml is pretty standard too: <servlet>
    <servlet-name>normalise</servlet-name>
    <servlet-class>NormaliserServlet</servlet-class>

<servlet-mapping>

@LINK:/questions/1224975/handling-errors-and-exceptions-on-the-iphone
@TITLE:Handling errors and exceptions on the iPhone
@CONTENT:I am developinga Core Data app for the iPhone, and I am new to the whole platform etc. My question is, how much should I look for and handle errors and exceptions, for example when opening up the persistent store. Looking at the "Locations" Core Data Tutorial for example (hope its OK to quote it here like this): (Se comments in the code for some of my conserns) - (void)applicationDidFinishLaunching:(UIApplication *)application {
   ...    
   NSManagedObjectContext *context = [self managedObjectContext];
   if (!context) {
       // Handle the error. Can this ever happen with this code? (see next comment below)



- (NSManagedObjectContext *) managedObjectContext {
   ...
   NSPersistentStoreCoordinator *coordinator = [self persistentStoreCoordinator];
   // it seems even if I get an error or exception down in persistentStoreCoordinator,
   // coordinator will still never be nil, or?  
   if (coordinator != nil) {
        managedObjectContext = [[NSManagedObjectContext alloc] init];
        [managedObjectContext setPersistentStoreCoordinator: coordinator];
   }
   return managedObjectContext;   
}



- (NSPersistentStoreCoordinator *)persistentStoreCoordinator {
   ...
   NSError *error;
   // should i have an:  if managedObjectModel != nil   here?
   persistentStoreCoordinator = [[NSPersistentStoreCoordinator alloc] [initWithManagedObjectModel: [self managedObjectModel]];
   //need a @try here too?
   if (![persistentStoreCoordinator addPersistentStoreWithType:NSSQLiteStoreType configuration:nil URL:storeUrl options:nil error:&error]) {
       // Handle error, do what?   
   }    
   return persistentStoreCoordinator;    
}


- (NSManagedObjectModel *)managedObjectModel {
   ...
   //should have a @try here? But how to handle caught exceptions? Just return nil?
   managedObjectModel = [[NSManagedObjectModel mergedModelFromBundles:nil] retain];    
   return managedObjectModel;
}
 So the question is really where to look for errors, where to look for exceptions, how and when to propagate them upwards, and how to handle severe errors on the iPhone in a good way? Edit: after receiving some answers to this and my other related question I have some clearifications of what I try to ask: I now understand exceptions in cocoa are mostly for finding programmer errors, not runtime errors. Would you go as far as not including any exception handling when shipping the app (if not added for debug reasons)? Or should I still program defensively and use a lot of @try anyway? As the iPhone apps are sandboxed and the user cant get to the file system, what possible runtime errors are smart to look for when designing a sqlite based core data app? I mean, the database file is not likely to disapear....but perhaps a future upgrade could fail leaving an old invalid sqlite database....what is good practise? Also, other things like object alloc are probaly extremely unlikely to fail? You would get a low memory warning long before that happens....or...? And, what is good programming practise considering error and exception handling in the above example, where I can get an error "deep down" in the methods...should I handle the error down there or wait until it reaches the top in some form (a nil object for example), or handle them all in a chain reaction? And, how to handle them? Log to NSLog and go on? Show a modal info box and lock up waiting for the user to exit the app? Or "Error xxx, press OK to exit app"? And, is there any way to show a modal dialog directly? I noticed that some errors I provoked that would display a dialog never showed that because the app continued and later crashed....is there a SHOW NOW method? Lots of questions, hope you would be interested to answer at least some of them, and that this could be of interest to others! Rgds PM

 I'm getting a "type or with" expected error when trying to add the onlick event. This should be easy, but none of samples I've found seem to work. The leading "@" is common in all the examples I've found, but something else seems to be missing. And yes I know the way of checking for "true" is overkill, but it is created with a special purpose code generator, so it wasn't any extra work. Any thoughts?

@CONTENT:I am still trying to solve the issue of displaying an image on a website without having the image external. As the data: scheme does not work on older browsers or big images, I'm currently experimenting with Silverlight. I managed to solve the embedding by Base64 Encoding the Image and passing it in using the InitParams, but actually I just moved my problem away: Instead of an external Image, I now have an external XAP File... Is there a way taking the XAP File and somehow embedding it in the HTML? Or alternatively, can I use the JavaScript-based Silverlight 1.1 in this situation? It's literally just displaying an image that has been passed in as a String.

Looking at my code, I can see exception handling code around certain places. However, there is not exception handling code when I am writing to a log file via enterprise library.

@TITLE:Jquery permission denied - different domain name
@CONTENT:I have developed a set of apis that live on an asp.net mvc application, but will be consumed from a browser accessing our main site (which lives on a LAMP stack). The domain names look like this: http://www.mainsite.org API's http://apis.www.mainsite.org (originally, apis.mainsite.org, but I made the modification in an attempt to fix the problem) I make a $.ajax() request to the api which in turn sends plain html to dump an input form into a div. The configration runs fine when I run from a sample host page that lives on my apis site, but when I put the same page on a site outside of apis.www.mainsite.org, I get a "permission denied" error in IE on the first request to the service. I've seem a few resources that say I must implement JSONP in order to get this to work correctly and make the cross-domain script call that way - but I am hopeful that I can enable that functionality while still returning html instead of JSON. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. One other question - any idea why an XMLhttp request from http://mysite.org to http://api.mysite.org would be considered cross domain? Does any change in the domain name make it a cross domain call? It seems like a fairly common scenario to separate the domain for the api from the main content domain and I am hopeful that I am just missing something simple. Best regards and thanks for your time.

@LINK:/questions/1222008/wpf-hierarchicaldatatemplate-itemscontrol
@TITLE:WPF HierarchicalDataTemplate & ItemsControl
@CONTENT:I have a list containing objects that follow this structure. This is not the real classes I am working with, but should explain the concept. CLASSES public class BaseType{}
public class TypeA : BaseType{}
public class TypeB: BaseType
{
    public List<TypeA> TypeAList { get; private set; }
}
 The List that the ItemsControl binds to is a List<BaseType> XAML <ItemsControl>
    <ItemsControl.Resources>
    	<HierarchicalDataTemplate DataType="{x:Type local:TypeB}" ItemsSource = "{Binding Path=TypeAList}">
    		<DataTemplate.Resources>
    			<Style TargetType="TextBlock">
    				<Setter Property="FontSize" Value="18"/>
    				<Setter Property="HorizontalAlignment" Value="Center"/>
    			</Style>
    		</DataTemplate.Resources>
    		<Grid>
    			<Ellipse Fill="Gold"/>
    			<StackPanel>
    				<TextBlock Margin="3,3,3,0"
    	 Text="{Binding Path=Description}"/>
    				<TextBlock Margin="3,0,3,7"
    	 Text="{Binding Path=Name}"/>
    			</StackPanel>
    		</Grid>

    	<ItemsPanelTemplate>
    		<StackPanel></StackPanel>
    	</ItemsPanelTemplate>
    </ItemsControl.ItemsPanel>
</ItemsControl>
 Now what I would expect to see is all the TypeA objects found in the TypeB object property to be displayed in the ItemsControl, instead I only see the TypeB objects, displayed with the styles defined for the HierarchicalDataTemplate. i've used the same datatemplate in a TreeView control, where it displays the child items fine. Can you not use a HierarchicalDataTemplate in an ItemsControl? How do you go about displaying a parent child relationship in an ItemsControl?
@CODE:public class BaseType{}
public class TypeA : BaseType{}
public class TypeB: BaseType
{
    public List<TypeA> TypeAList { get; private set; }

    	<HierarchicalDataTemplate DataType="{x:Type local:TypeB}" ItemsSource = "{Binding Path=TypeAList}">

    			<Style TargetType="TextBlock">
    				<Setter Property="FontSize" Value="18"/>

@CONTENT:I have heard from some of the microsoft connect blogs that Geneva Server works with AD/LDAP as identity providers. If I have to configure my own custom attribute store in SQL server, with these users not being in AD groups would that be possible.from the blogs what I have seen is that Genevea Server is tightly coupled with AD and if I have to use custom store then I have to write my custom STS by overriding base classes from the Geneva Framework. So my question is is it possible to authenticate a user from the SQL store,(who is not in AD group) visa the Geneva Server Beta 2?

@CONTENT:I'd like to be able to launch a process from a GUI application (right now I'm thinking specifically of letting an eclipse user -- possibly via a plugin -- click a button to launch a build using my organization's build system). I don't want this process to stop when I stop the parent application, and I want to be able to "switch into it" later, as though I launched it from a command line. I've seen GNU screen described as good for most of what I'm asking for, but I'm not sure about the "launch the process from another application" part. Can this be done if the GUI application was itself launched from within screen? Can this be done if it wasn't? I'd be very interested in seeing how! Update: Prepending "screen" to a command line looks like a good way to start a process in screen from a shell, but I'm trying to find a way to do this without being taken straight into that session. I want to "send" the command to a screen session, where it will be started in a new window in that session.

@TITLE:How is a ¡§handshake¡¨ generally implemented with regards to Named Pipes
@CONTENT:I need to implement a handshake type protocol in to a small Linux program that uses named pipes to communicate with other processes. I've searched for a general implementation pattern for a handshake type protocol when using named pipes but I've not been able to turn anything up... I simply can't believe that there isn't patterns to do this. Can someone point me to a possible resource? In full disclosure this is for homework but implementing this pattern isn't the homework. We need to solve a problem within the homework code and I believe this to be a possible solution. The homework is implemented in C++ -- but the languages doesn't matter to me. I just don't want to reinvent the wheel.... Update: I have a feeling that this might be implemented with signals. What I mean by handshake is that a child process reports to it's parent process that it is ready for work but does not proceed (even if there is something in the pipe) until the parent gives the go signal. In my working theory, I will have many child processes that need to report ready and wait for the go signal from the parent.

@TITLE:referencing each case of a switch from a conditional inside a different method in java
@CONTENT:I am implementing some methods which use switch statements to distinguish between different cases: private void doThis(){
    switch(command){
    case on: {status = doCalculationsA; break;}
    case off: {status = doCalculationsB; break;}
    case idle: {status = doCalculationsC; break;}
    case stdby:{status = doCalculationsD; break;}   
    }
}
 The above works fine, when, further down the business logic, I call doThis() inside other methods which need the doThis() functionality. However, at this moment I am a bit confused how to incorporate other conditions/restrictions posed on each case of the above switch. I mean, when I call doThis() within say biggerOperation(), I have new conditions that need to be applied against each case of the switch belonging in the doThis() function: Sample logic: biggerOperation(){

    doThat();
    doTheOther();

    if(somethingIsTrue){
      execute "case: on" of doThis()
    }
    else if(somethingElseIsTrue){
      execute "case: off" of doThis()
    }
    else if(aThirdThingIsTrue){
      execute "case: idle" of doThis()
    }
    else if(aFourthThingIsTrue){
      execute "case: stdby" of doThis()
    }
}
 I have not been able to figure out an elegant, clean and compact way to do this as of now. Are there any ideas perhaps? How can I explicitly target each case of a switch? Could I use a new switch to implement that conditional logic? Any suggestions are welcome. Much appreciate your help.
@CODE:private void doThis(){
    switch(command){
    case on: {status = doCalculationsA; break;}

@CONTENT:I've got a WinForms app, where if there is already an instance running & the user tries to spin up another one, I stop it by checking against a Mutex before calling Application.Run(). That part works just fine. What I would like to do is pass a message from the new instance of the app (along with a piece of data in string form) to the existing instance before killing the new process. I've tried calling PostMessage, and I do receive the message on the running app, but the string I pass along in the lparam is failing (yes, I have checked to make sure I'm passing in a good string to begin with). How can I best do this? static class Program
{
    [DllImport("user32.dll", CharSet = CharSet.Auto)]
    public static extern bool PostMessage(int hhwnd, uint msg, IntPtr wparam, IntPtr lParam);

    [DllImport("user32.dll", SetLastError = true, CharSet = CharSet.Auto)]
    static extern uint RegisterWindowMessage(string lpString);

    private const int HWND_BROADCAST = 0xffff;
    static uint _wmJLPC = unchecked((uint)-1);

    {

        if (_wmJLPC == 0)
        {
            throw new Exception(string.Format("Error registering window message: \"{0}\"", Marshal.GetLastWin32Error().ToString()));
        }

        bool onlyInstance = false;
        Mutex mutex = new Mutex(true, "b73fd756-ac15-49c4-8a9a-45e1c2488599_ProjectTracker", out onlyInstance);

        if (!onlyInstance) {
            ProcessArguments();
            return;
        }

        Application.EnableVisualStyles();
        Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(false);

@CONTENT:I'm working on a small clipboard manager which should remember recent copied text. I'm using Windows system messages for being notified when something has been copied to clipboard by WM_DRAWCLIPBOARD. The problem is some of the applications I use send multiple WM_DRAWCLIPBOARD messages to my application, for instance when I copy something in Chrome web browser it's only one message, miranda's chat window sends 3 of the same messages with the same text to the clipboard viewer's chain. How to avoid this ?

 Where I'm getting stumped, is I'm getting this thing to loop through correctly, my loop counter ($loop) is working, but when it gets time to spit out the actual reward recipients after the first loop through winners, it's only producing the category titles, the list-items are not getting looped out. I added a little pointer to where I think the problem begins or centers around (>>). My guess is I need to maybe unset a var somewhere, but I don't know, I can't see it.

@TITLE:rsync and MyISAM tables
@CONTENT:I'm trying to use rsync to backup MySQL data. The tables use the MyISAM storage engine. My expectation was that after the first rsync, subsequent rsyncs would be very fast. It turns out, if the table data was changed at all, the operation slows way down. I did an experiment with a 989 MB MYD file containing real data: Test 1 - recopying unmodified data rsync -a orig.MYD copy.MYD takes a while as expected rsync -a orig.MYD copy.MYD instantaneous - speedup is in the millions Test 2 - recopying slightly modified data rsync -a orig.MYD copy.MYD takes a while as expected UPDATE table SET counter = counter + 1 WHERE id = 12345 rsync -a orig.MYD copy.MYD takes as long as the original copy! What gives? Why is rsync taking forever just to copy a tiny change? Edit: In fact, the second rsync in Test 2 takes as long as the first. rsync is apparently copying the whole file again. Edit: Turns out when copying from local to local, --whole-file is implied. Even with --no-whole-file, the performance is still terrible.
@CODE:rsync -a orig.MYD copy.MYD rsync -a orig.MYD copy.MYD rsync -a orig.MYD copy.MYD UPDATE table SET counter = counter + 1 WHERE id = 12345 rsync -a orig.MYD copy.MYD

				$(this).sum("keypup", ".R5");
				}

		VertiCalc = function(v){

		}
 I need to be able to get the daily totals and the grand total and the totals each category (which I'm able to do right now.). Also, I need to be able to multiply the milage # by the number specific with the variable #mileage# and have the total for that cell be directly below it. Well. It's a lot and if anyone can give some help, it would be greatly appreciated!

@TITLE:Debugging handling slightly different inputs
@CONTENT:I am currently working on a Java compiler. In the context of the compiler, slightly different inputs may result in different output (e.g. adding final in Java permits compiler to perform more optimizations). In some other cases, different inputs may result into the same output (e.g. de-sugering some constructs - for-each loops). When debugging how a compiler handles these cases, I usually run the compiler and try to figure out where the runtime execution path of the compiler diverge (or converge). Needless to say, it's very tedious. I am wondering if you have any tips that could help me debugging these situations. Also, is there any tool that can trace two program executions and provide you the diffs of the execution path.

@TITLE:Can JavaScript tell the difference between leaving through the back button or a link?
@CONTENT:My application has pages with several tabs that simply switch the visible content. However, the page also has links that will add tabs to the page. In addition, the application remembers (with cookies) which tab you last viewed in case the page is refreshed (strict cache settings cause refreshes even when using the back and forward buttons). My problem is that the first time you visit this set of pages, it should show the first tab (Tab A). Then, you click a link, and it adds a tab, and it remembers that new tab (Tab B). However, if you hit back, now it looks like it did nothing because it remembers and displays the tab you last clicked (Tab B). Remembering Tab B is desirable behavior if you click forward to a new page and then use our in-application history to return to the previous page. However, it is undesirable if you click the Back Button, because you want it to again show Tab A, the way it did when you first arrived. My question is whether the JavaScript onunload event can detect the difference between leaving the page with the Back Button, or some other means. At this point, I want it to forget any tabs that it had remembered for that page.

It calls an action named CreateParameter in my Parameters controller to create the parameter. My problem is, I would like it to return to the previous controller and show the Index view for that controller, so that the user can see that the parameter has been created.

@CONTENT:First of all, as I am using VB6, please confine your kind suggestions to techniques applied to VB6. I have a set of controls related to each other as the above figure shows. It includes several treeviews, a split bar, a listview, a subform( a usercontrol), and etc. When I click or change the treeview nodes in the left, the right controls will change therir dispay accordingly, and vice versa. The data behind the scene is maintained in an Access database. This set of data management and display is used in several different applicaitons . So I wrote several classes to implement the logic and include these classes modules again and again in my applications. So I am actually REUSE my classes in a "copy and paste" mode. It works but it have problems. If I make a change in a class, I have to change it in severl applicaitons. These days I am thinking about making them into the so-called ActiveX components. But I am not sure which kind of ActiveX components should I develop to reuse the whole architeccture. In a nutshell, I want to know how can I reuse it more gracefully than just "copy and paste". Below is some ideas or expectation of the new "graceful REUSE", but not confine to them. (1) I hope it looks like an ActiveX control which has a property page so that I can set some properties of it during design time. (2) For diffrent applications, the subform in the right may display different information and has differnt controls and may need extral coding and designing. (3) Also I may need to code some new behaviour for the treeview and listview for differnt applications. This requirement make a whole usercontrol for the whole form not suitable. because MSDN said ¡§References to ActiveX controls¡Ashould never be returned to client applications¡C"

@CONTENT:A HTML page is created using JSF and facelets (xhtml). There are 2 h:forms that goes to different places. The user enters data on one form and presses the "Enter" key. Here is where it gets tricky. On IE 6 and above, either the forms action gets submitted (which usually points to the page you are on) which then just reloads the page, or the first h:commandbutton/link that is on the page. Its totally random, but its consistant on that page. Here is what I have tried, I tried placing the components that have to be submitted in their own form...it works but not everywhere. Then I tried creating a hidden input with the id of the button, it works quite effectively, but it is then bypassed somehow by IE trying to invoke the first button on the page. I tried a product called j4j that supposedly creates a default action, but it doesn't work, outputting the tag itself in the rendered HTML. When it does work, it creates javascript they looks for key 13, and then invokes oamsubmit(...., which incidently I tried also with varying degrees of success. Is there a solution out there that work permanently? Have I missed something or am I not understanding JSF?

@CONTENT:I'm using the 960 grid system to make a site (www.960.gs). I have a 9 column wide div (grid_9) with two divs inside it (grid_5 and grid_4). This is meant to yield one large outer div with 2 internal divs sitting side by side inside of it. However when viewed in IE6 it displays as one larger div with two internal divs, one below the other.

@CONTENT:I have a solution for my question, but I'm trying to get better at regex especially in javascript. I just wanted to bring this to the community to see if I could write this in a better way. So, I get a datetime string that comes from .net and I need to extract the date from it. Currently what I have is: var time = "2009-07-05T00:00:00.0000000-05:00".match(/(^\d{4}).(\d{2}).(\d{2})/i);
 As I said, this works, but I was hoping to make it more direct to only grab the Year, month, day in the array. What I get with this is 4 results with the first being YYYY-MM-DD, YYYY, MM, DD. Essentially I just want the 3 results returned, not so much that this doesn't work (because I can just ignore the first index in the array), but so that I can learn to use regex a bit better.
@CODE:var time = "2009-07-05T00:00:00.0000000-05:00".match(/(^\d{4}).(\d{2}).(\d{2})/i);

@TITLE:Weird browser / ajax error : Extra junk appears at the end of javascript files in firefox
@CONTENT:This is a weird one. We're writing a Django application with some rich javascript UI, using both Yahoo YUI and jQuery. Our main page template now includes a fair number of js files. And we're starting to see a strange error in Firefox (3 and 3.5) . Sometimes the javascript crashes. And inspecting in Firebug we see that a syntax error occurred in one of the YUI .js files. When we look at the line in Firebug, we see that it's actually a line that doesn't exist in the original file, but seems to be some junk javascript that's got appended. For example, the last part of a despaceed yahoo-dom-event.js is YAHOO.register("yahoo-dom-event", YAHOO, {version: "2.7.0", build: "1799"});
 According to Firebug, this now seems to have a near copy of this file appended on the end, starting with return M;},_getCacheIndex:function(Q,R,P){for(var O=0,N=I.length;O<N;O=O+1){var M=I[O]...
 Perhaps this is some of the earlier code that's overflowed a buffer somewhere. So, has anyone else experienced anything like this? Or knows this as a bug in one of the components of our stack : Django lighttpd Firefox Firebug YUI jQuery (also on the page)
@CODE:YAHOO.register("yahoo-dom-event", YAHOO, {version: "2.7.0", build: "1799"}); return M;},_getCacheIndex:function(Q,R,P){for(var O=0,N=I.length;O<N;O=O+1){var M=I[O]...

@TITLE:Deploy C# project to a website with IIS 6.0
@CONTENT:I am using VS 2008, SQL Server 2008, IIS 6.0 Manager on an XP OS. I developed my very first C# project in VS 2008 and it runs correctly in VS. But now I need to publish this project on my website. This project also involves an SQL Server 2008 Adventureworks database on this same computer. I will use this same computer to host the website and house this database. I know HTML but not how to add a .NET project to a web site, especially one that also uses SQL Server. Can u offer me tips as to how to proceed? This is not a Windows Form Application, so I am pretty sure it is a Web Application. I started by right-clicking the project and selecting "Convert to Web Application" and then I selected the URL for my site. But then when I went to this URL, it still shows the original image. Then I opened IIS6 Manager, Default Web Site, and I added a new virtual directory. I typed an alias and pointed the path to the folder containing my web application (this folder has a bin, App_Data, obj, and Properties folder in it. It also contains all of the .CS files). Next I reviewed the MS documentation at http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/WindowsServer2003/Library/IIS/fc473b0b-162b-4146-932c-2a9a50c52ecb.mspx?mfr=true. But this didn't help much. All I learned from this documentation was to copy the DLL to the C:\Inetpub\wwwroot[MyApp]\bin directory. Also I copied the web.config, global.asax, and default.aspx files to the C:\Inetpub\wwwroot[MyApp] directory. And then I changed the App's Properties via the IIS6 Manager as follows: Virtual Directory tab I selected new Local Path pointing to C:\Inetpub\wwwroot\AFS\bin directory instead of the native VS project directory (C:\Documents and Settings\New Owner\My Documents\Visual Studio 2008\Projects\AddFileToSQL\AddFileToSQL). The only difference between these two directories I see is that the name of my application in VS and folders is "AddFileToSQL", but name I gave this folder under C:\Inetpub\wwwroot\ was "AFS". Does this matter? When I navigate to my website, 192.168.2.2, it still shows me the default web page. However when I go to http://192.168.2.2/AddFileToSQL, it prompts me to enter password. Which password and is this right? And is this the correct URL to enter? There are so many tabs and options in this IIS Properties window that I'm not sure if I configured it properly. I also see many Property options in VS 2008 for this project. Right now everything in these two Properties windows is set to default. Do I need to make any changes to any of these properties? Yes I know I have XP. Target and development server are the same. This XP is the only machine I have. Are u sure IIS 6 only works with Server 2003? Cause I know that I'm able to configure the IIS6 Manager. I'm not sure if it is Cassini or not, but from VS when I run this application, it does open a web browser and does what I want it to. I ran the aspnet_regiis command u suggested. It looks like maybe that was not installed cause it took a few minutes to install. Now which URL should I go to to test this app? I opened the Properties window and it said Virtual Directory Local Path is C:\Inetpub\wwwroot\AFS\bin. Next I right-clicked this app from IIS6 Manager and chose "Browse". But this caused it to produce output: "The website declined to show this webpage". I feel like I am very close to the solution, but still not there yet. Do u have other suggestions?

This is normally not good if the table is the first table not marked const, and usually very bad in all other cases. Normally, you can avoid ALL by adding indexes that allow row retrieval from the table based on constant values or column values from earlier tables. Does this mean that any query that uses ALL can be optimized so that it is no longer is doing a full table scan?

 the function will read all of the integers as decimal. I put in some test code after the string conversion to output the string, and the string is the number in decimal form. I was wondering if there is a way for integers to keep their base notation. Of course you could input the numbers as strings and test that way, but then there is the problem of reading the string back as an int. For example:        string a = 0x43;
       int num = atoi(a.c_str());
       cout << num; // will output 43
 It seems like keeping/converting base notation can get very tricky. As an added problem, the hex, dec, and oct manipulators wouldn't even help with the issue shown above since the integer is being stored completely incorrectly, it's not even converting to a decimal.
@CODE:cin.unsetf(ios::dec); cin.unsetf(ios::hex); and cin.unsetf(ios::oct); 0x43 0123 65 void number_sys(int num, string& s)
{
string number;
stringstream out;
out << num;
number = out.str();
if(number[0] == '0' && (number[1] != 'x' && number[1] != 'X')) s = "octal";
else if(number[0] == '0' && (number[1] == 'x' || number[1] == 'X')) s = "hexadecimal";
else s = "decimal";
} string a = 0x43;
       int num = atoi(a.c_str());
       cout << num; // will output 43

@TITLE:ASP.NET C# Properly Generating HTML for Page
@CONTENT:I realize this is probably a fundamental thing I should know but I am self-teaching myself C# and asp.net so I am a little lost at this point. I right now have 2 pages. One is an .aspx (with aspx.cs file included) that is blank and html is generated for it from a Page_Load function in the cs file. The HTML is very simple and it is just an image and some text. The second file is a shtml file which has lots of things, serverside includes, editable and noneditable areas. I want to put my webapp into this file. My asp.net app uses Response.Write to just write out the html. This does not flow well with this page as all that does is write it at the top of the page which is because it is ran first and generates it at the top. How can I make it to where I can generate HTML code inside the page, like within a specific DIV so it does not mess up the page. Where would a starting point be in learning how to do that. I should note that I do not need any interaction from the user. All of this should generate right away.

@TITLE:ASP.Net - Path Problems caused by Encoded URLs
@CONTENT:I am building a web store and I am having a bit of a problem with some of the urls. I have a large directory of departments and categories in my database that I am using to form my main menu. The URLs have the form Application/Store/Department/Category (All store URLs are rewritten to store.aspx?Querystringstuff) The problem is that some of the urls generated by my code work, but prevent the page's CSS from loading properly. It is specifically the URLs who's source text contain slashes. I am URL encoding the source text of course but I'm still having the problem. My css is linked in a master page-  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="~/CSS/Layout.css" runat="server">

@LINK:/questions/1194576/page-insert-html-does-not-insert-html-with-link-to-function-rails
@TITLE:page.insert_html does not insert html with link_to_function (rails)
@CONTENT:I'm triying to do a complex form in Ruby On Rails. It should be divided in groups, and each group should have text fields. I want groups and text fields to be added and removed dinamically. I already managed to get Text Fields added and removed dinamically, but I am totally unable to do the same with the groups. This is the call to the function: <%= link_to_function 'Add group' do |page|
page.insert_html :bottom, :groups, :partial => 'group' 
end %>
 So, it should add the partial named "group" to the "groups" div, right? well, it doesn't. This is the partial: <div id="group" class='elements'>
    <p>
    	<g_title>Text Group</g_title>
    	<add><%= add_text_link 'Add a text field'%></add>
    	<remove><%= link_to_function 'Remove text group', "this.up('.elements').remove()" %></remove>
    </p>

    <%= render :partial => 'text' %>
</div>
 If I click on the "Add new group" link, Firebug tell me there is an error like some javascript code isnt valid (the error is "missing } after property list"). But, If I remove the fourth line in the partial code (the one with the "add_text_link" function) it works perfect! and that function works perfect. So, any idea? Thanks for your help!

@CONTENT:Hi I am trying to use an AVAudioRecorder instance to record sound, the whole recording progress runs well, except that when I call [recorder peakPowerForChannel:0] trying to get the volume, the return value is always 0, that's pretty odd.. I have checked the recorded audio file, it's totally fine. Then I use AVAudioPlayer to play it, and during playing, i call [player peakPowerForChannel:0], the return value seems to be right and make sense. How can I get the right value ?

@TITLE:Why can't you use GetType when casting?
@CONTENT:I asked a still unanswered question that will shed more light on this question. Why can't I do this... _wizardDialog.UIRoot.Controls.Clear()
_wizardDialog.UIRoot.Controls.Add(TryCast(wizardUserControl, wizardUserControl.GetType))
 Why does using GetType in this way fail. The argument for try cast are object and type. Since wizardUserControl.GetType returns a type how come this is not legal. Visual Studio is complaining wizardUserControl.GetType is not defined. The bottom line is how can I get WizardUserControl to return the type that is being passed in to my method. The method that is being called into here should not have to have the type hard-coded...that's the point of all of this OOP stuff...right? So how do you do this. Please read the other question and answer there if you can...that is the problem I am tyring to solve. I am learning the oop stuff. Seth

I am currently writing a program that uses a selection buffer pass over all the objects in the scene. However, one of the objects is a texture in which a large part of it has alpha 0. It works fine when rendering, the alpha values are not displayed, but when in selection mode, the alpha test is skipped, and hovering the mouse over the transparent areas selects the object instead of whatever is behind it. Is there any way to enable alpha testing in selection mode?

@TITLE:DirectX9 Texture of arbitrary size (non 2^n)
@CONTENT:I'm relatively new to DirectX and have to work on an existing C++ DX9 application. The app does tracking on a camera images and displays some DirectDraw (ie. 2d) content. The camera has an aspect ratio of 4:3 (always) and the screen is undefined. I want to load a texture and use this texture as a mask, so tracking and displaying of the content only are done within the masked area of the texture. Therefore I'd like to load a texture that has exactly the same size as the camera images. I've done all steps to load the texture, but when I call GetDesc() the fields Width and Height of the D3DSURFACE_DESC struct are of the next bigger power-of-2 size. I do not care that the actual memory used for the texture is optimized for the graphics card but I did not find any way to get the dimensions of the original image file on the harddisk. I do (and did, but with no success) search a possibility to load the image into the computers RAM only (graphicscard is not required) without adding a new dependency to the code. Otherwise I'd have to use OpenCV (which might anyway be a good idea when it comes to tracking), but at the moment I still try to avoid including OpenCV. thanks for your hints, Norbert

What I want to do is to redirect all requests from example.xxx to www.example.com with extra url parameter lang=en.

RewriteRule ^(.*)$   http://www.example.com/$1?lang=de [PT]
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^([^.]+)\.example\.fr$
RewriteRule ^(.*)$   http://www.example.com/$1?lang=fr [PT]
 One thing that makes it even more difficult is that the ServerName is totally different than the host name, it is called prod.migr.com. Any suggestions would be appreciated.

@TITLE:Best way to implement many-to-many lookup table with user-entered data
@CONTENT:Say I want users to pick one or more contact methods (email, phone, fax, other, etc). And if they choose other, then they can enter a single contact method of their own. What's the best way to store this in a database? I see three possibilities: Use a set datatype column, plus a single "other_contact" varchar column to store the optional user-entered value. Use many-to-many, and a user-entered column. So there would be a user table, a contact_method table, and a user_contact_method table that connects the two. Plus a user.other_contact varchar column to store the optional user-entered value. Just use many-to-many. Same setup as 2 but let users add entries to the contact_method table. But this means I'll have to add a column to keep track of "system" values (these cannot be changed or deleted by users, and only these show up in a dropdown). Plus I'll have to add extra logic to allow their user-entered value(s) to be changed. Any comments on the above, or is there a better solution?

    {
        private readonly IRepository _impl;

@CONTENT:In the Page_Load() section, I check for valid inputs & incase they are invalid, I transfer the request to a custom error page. While doing so, a ThreadAbortException is thrown which is caught by my catch block but asp.net transfers the request to unknown exception page. What am I doing wrong? I dont want the ThreadAbortException to come when I transfer to the error page. eg:      protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
  {

    try
    {
                    if (String.IsNullOrEmpty(szProductName))

                        //Product name not given. Hence cant process further.
                        Server.Transfer(Constants.ERROR_WRONG_INPUTS_ASPX);
                      }
                    else

    }
    catch(Exception Ex)
    {

    }

  }
 As a workaround, I now use: Response.Redirect(Constants.ERROR_WRONG_INPUTS_ASPX, false);
 instead of Server.Transfer i.e. I allow the process to continue in the background which made required I check for validity & then only executed the remaining code.

@LINK:/questions/1183424/winforms-usercontrol-is-not-using-the-inheritance-tree-i-have-created-what-am-i
@TITLE:Winforms UserControl is not using the inheritance tree I have created. What am I doing wrong
@CONTENT:I am working on a wizard form framework that will allow me easily create wizard forms. I have a WizardForm form that has a panel on it. My plan is to dynamically load UserControls into this panel on the form. Each UserControl that is loaded onto the form panel must implement certain properties (allowNavigateNext, AllowNAvigate previous etc.). So I have created an interface to enforce that contract so that any custom user control can be used in the wizard as long as it implements that Interface. So far so good. I created my first user control. I implemented the interface. All was good. I went to do the second user control and I realized that this second user control would have the EXACT SAME implementation of the interface as the first User Control. So...I thought...aha...duplicated code...how can I get rid of that. So... I created a NEW user control and called it UserControlWizardBase. I had this new UserControlWizardBase inherit from the same interface and put the same implementation in there as with the first two. Then I went back to custom user controls 1 and 2. I removed the interface implementation and interface statements in there. I went into the designer file of each though and changed the inheritance of each from UserControl to UserControlWizardBase. That didn't quite compile until I added a public constructor that calls into the base constructore like this... Public Sub New(ByVal showNavigateCancel As Boolean, _ ByVal showNavigateFinish As Boolean, _ ByVal showNavigateNext As Boolean, _ ByVal showNavigatePrevious As Boolean)     MyBase.New(showNavigateCancel, _
					showNavigateFinish, _
					showNavigateNext, _
					showNavigatePrevious)
 End Sub (I learned at that moment that you can't inherit the constructor of the base class. Or can you and I just didn't know what I was doing?) In any case...now all compiles...in fact there are no run time errors at all. But when I run the code and load CustomUserControl 1 by loading into the panel on the wizard form...it is NOT loading CustomUserControl at all but rather is loading USerControlWizardBase. Now hopefully you understand my problem AND you can point me in the right direction for solving it. EDIT - MORE INFORMATION I am closer to having a bead on the problem. Here is the problem. The code that loads the userControl into my wizard form panel is as follows         Public Sub InitUserControl(ByVal wizardUserControl As UserControl)

    wizardUserControl.Dock = DockStyle.Fill

    Try

        Dim iwp As IWizardUserControl = DirectCast(wizardUserControl, IWizardUserControl)
        _wizardDialog.NavigatePrevious.Enabled = iwp.ShowNavigatePrevious
        _wizardDialog.NavigateNext.Enabled = iwp.ShowNavigateNext
        _wizardDialog.NavigateFinish.Enabled = iwp.ShowNavigateFinish
        _wizardDialog.NavigateCancel.Enabled = iwp.ShowNavigateCancel
        TryCast(_wizardDialog, Form).Text = iwp.StepCaption
        _wizardDialog.PageDescription.Text = iwp.Description
        _wizardDialog.PictureBox.Image = iwp.PageImage
        _wizardDialog.PageHelpText.Text = iwp.PageHelpText
        _wizardDialog.UIRoot.Controls.Clear()
        _wizardDialog.UIRoot.Controls.Add(wizardUserControl)

    Catch
        ' Do Nothing
    End Try

    End Sub
 Do you see the problem...the routine is passing in a usercontrol and then casting it to type IWizardUserControl. The problem is that it needs to load the specific type into the panel not the interface or UserControl type. But how do I do that without tying it to a specific implementation of IWizardUserControl? Help. I am still learning OOP as you can tell. ANOTHER EDIT - MORE INFORMATION STILL Let me describe the NATURE of the problem. I get no runtime errors with the code you see here. But it is loading the BASE Type instead of the DERIVED type even though the InitUserControl is being passed one of the derived types. (I know that because if I put a breakpoint there and drill into the type it is showing the type NOT as UserControlWizardBase but the correct type which is one of the derived types...in this case SetupWizardStartPage). Keep in mind that SetupWizardStartPage has a big label with a large font and a lot of text describing what the wizard does. But when it loads the none of that shows. If I try to see if that description label is there it is NOT there. What IS there is the ONE AND ONLY control that I have implemented in UserControlWizardBase. That is how I know that the base control rather than the derived control is being loaded into the panel. THIS even though if I query the wizardUSerControl it is showing the derived type rather than base type. Seth
@CODE:MyBase.New(showNavigateCancel, _
					showNavigateFinish, _
					showNavigateNext, _
					showNavigatePrevious) Public Sub InitUserControl(ByVal wizardUserControl As UserControl)

    wizardUserControl.Dock = DockStyle.Fill

    Try

        Dim iwp As IWizardUserControl = DirectCast(wizardUserControl, IWizardUserControl)
        _wizardDialog.NavigatePrevious.Enabled = iwp.ShowNavigatePrevious
        _wizardDialog.NavigateNext.Enabled = iwp.ShowNavigateNext
        _wizardDialog.NavigateFinish.Enabled = iwp.ShowNavigateFinish
        _wizardDialog.NavigateCancel.Enabled = iwp.ShowNavigateCancel
        TryCast(_wizardDialog, Form).Text = iwp.StepCaption
        _wizardDialog.PageDescription.Text = iwp.Description
        _wizardDialog.PictureBox.Image = iwp.PageImage
        _wizardDialog.PageHelpText.Text = iwp.PageHelpText
        _wizardDialog.UIRoot.Controls.Clear()
        _wizardDialog.UIRoot.Controls.Add(wizardUserControl)

And somewhere else Apple said, that the presentation layer contains the values like they are currently displayed to the user.

@CONTENT:I've got an issue with my blog. When the browser window is narrowed down just so, the left part of the page (the "posts" area), drops. You can see it in action here: http://www.itscodingtime.com/ Just drag the right-side of the browser to the left, narrowing the browser width, and it happens. I can post the CSS if needed (let me know), but I've basically got one side of the page floated to the left and the other to the right. I think I need to use a clear (or maybe not) somewhere, but I'm not sure. So, how can I keep the "posts" section from dropping off? I'm OK setting a min width across the whole page if that's what will keep it from happening.
