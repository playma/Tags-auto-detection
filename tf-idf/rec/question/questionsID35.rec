@TITLE:Android, Text / Font renders as Squares
@CONTENT:When I try sharing an image through my program, the share menu sometimes comes out looking like this. Some Notes: 1) It doesn't seem to occur on the first run, but only after I have paused the application and gone back in. 2) My app uses OpenGL extensively. It is possible I am changing a shared setting, then not returning the value back to the original. 3) Everything else in my application works fine. 4) I have tried removing all the calls that allow transparencies, and I am still having this problem.

@TITLE:Applying a dictionary of string replacements to a list of strings
@CONTENT:Say I have a list of strings and a dictionary specifying replacements: E.g. my_replacements = {'1/2': 'half', '1/4': 'quarter', '3/4': 'three quarters'}
 and a list of strings, where each string can possibly include keys from the above dictionary, e.g: ['I own 1/2 bottle', 'Give me 3/4 of the profit']
 How can I apply the replacements to the list? What would be a Pythonic way to do this?
@CODE:my_replacements = {'1/2': 'half', '1/4': 'quarter', '3/4': 'three quarters'} ['I own 1/2 bottle', 'Give me 3/4 of the profit']

@TITLE:Example of NSTextContainer with non regular shape?
@CONTENT:Hi I'm working with the new TextKit API for iOS7 and I'm trying to produce a UITextView with an irregular shape. So far I have in a view controller: -(void) loadView
{
    self.view = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0,0,320,548)];

    NSTextStorage *textStorage = [[NSTextStorage alloc] init];

    NSLayoutManager *layoutManager = [[NSLayoutManager alloc] init];
    [textStorage addLayoutManager: layoutManager];

    BaseTextContainer *textContainer = [[BaseTextContainer alloc] initWithSize:CGSizeMake(100, 100)];
    [layoutManager addTextContainer: textContainer];

    BaseTextView *textView = [[BaseTextView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(110,124, 100, 100) textContainer:textContainer];
    textView.backgroundColor = [UIColor blueColor];
    textView.editable = YES;
    [self.view addSubview:textView];
}
 Then in my subclassed NSTextContainer, I want to have a mutablePath drawn as the shape of the text container, but not sure how to accomplish this. I have: - (BOOL) isSimpleRectangularTextContainer
{
    return NO;
}

- (void) drawLayer:(CALayer *)layer inContext:(CGContextRef)ctx
{
    NSLog(@"TEST");
    CGContextRef context = ctx;
    CGSize layerSize = layer.frame.size;

    CGAffineTransform transform = CGAffineTransformMakeScale(layerSize.width / self.initialSize.width, layerSize.height / self.initialSize.height);
    CGMutablePathRef newGraphicMutablePath = CGPathCreateMutableCopyByTransformingPath(self.mutablePath, &transform);
    CGContextAddPath(context, newGraphicMutablePath);

    CGPathRelease(newGraphicMutablePath);
    CGContextSetFillColorWithColor(context, [UIColor redColor].CGColor);
    CGContextDrawPath(context, kCGPathFill);
}
 Just a bit confused about how to get this to work. I cannot find an example anywhere of an NSTextContainer with an irregular shape.

@TITLE:Auth::user() returns null with CORS requests
@CONTENT:I have a site with a separate REST API on a subdomain, e.g. api.mysite.com, that I send CRUD requests to. The API sub-domain has this filter adding the appropriate headers to the response: // Simple CORS handling
Route::filter('cors', function($route, $request, $response) {
    $origin = Request::header('Origin');
    $host = parse_url($origin, PHP_URL_HOST);

    // Don't send response for external domains.
    if (!in_array($host, Config::get('domains'))) {
        App::abort();
    }

    $response->headers->set('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', $origin);
    $response->headers->set('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Accept, Accept-Encoding, Accept-Language, Content-Length, Content-Type');
    $response->headers->set('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'DELETE, GET, PATCH, POST, PUT');
    $response->headers->set('Access-Control-Allow-Credentials', 'true');
});
 I'm also setting crossdomain: true and xhrFields: { withCredentials: true } on my jQuery $.ajax request. The requests manage to go through to the server, hit the appropriate routes, etc, but something is going wrong with the authentication process. Every time, Laravel acts as if the user hasn't logged in, causing requests to Auth::user() to return null. Inspecting the requests in Firebug shows that the Cookie header is sent in the request with the Laravel session id, but the server responds with SetCookie, as if trying to start a new session. I'm probably doing something dumb here, but I'm at my wits end trying to determine just what. Update: From some debugging, I've found something interesting out. Not sure what it means, yet. To get to the page in question, the user must be logged in. Therefore, there is a laravel_session cookie in the browser when the page loads. I then send off a couple of (cross-domain) AJAX requests by interacting with the page. The first request has no cookie set at all and gets a new laravel_session cookie set from the server. The second request then includes that cookie, but the response to it sends back yet another new cookie, as if the back-end never got the memo about the first. I'm starting to wonder if this isn't something to do with cookie domains or some-such.

@TITLE:Retrieving CPU Load Percent total in Windows with C++
@CONTENT:I've been working on this tool to quickly log some system stats, like memory info, and cpu load percentage (like what's shown in the Task Manager). I seem to have the memory and logging part taken care of, but figuring out the CPU percentage has been very tough :( I've found a lot info on methods to check CPU info, but outside of abstracts pretty much none of the code samples I've found compile, or are well commented, so it's been hard for me to hash out a way to do this. I've already read through a lot of stackoverflow questions about getting CPU timings and such, but I haven't been able to put the pieces together. Maybe I'm missing the point, but it seems like a popular way to figure this out is by querying the CPU two times with at least 200ms between each check to help avoid problems with something called... resolution? So yeah! How the heck do I do that? :( I'm syntactically challenged D: I'm going to share my source code so you can see what exactly I've been up to, up until now. It's all in just one .cpp, I'm using VS2013 Express for C++, and it's only for Windows for multicore CPUs.

Performance Snapshot Tool

Grabs CPU load percent and basic Memory info from the system,

Designed to work with specifically Windows 7 and beyond

Ideology: Create a small executable program to retrieve and
write to a log file a data sample from system performance
in a single snapshot -- robust enough to be called multiple
times per boot

The compiled .exe will be called by another program to run at
an exact, specified time relative to the program that is
calling it

Does 5 checks per second, every 200 milliseconds for a "Snapshot"
of performance

@TITLE:When, if ever, should characters like { and } (curly braces) be percent-encoded in URLs?
@CONTENT:According to RFC 3986 the following characters are reserved and need to be percent-encoded in order to be used in a URI other than as their reserved uses: :/?#[]@!$&'()*+,;= Furthermore it specifies some characters that are specifically unreserved: a-zA-Z0-9\-._~ It seems clear that generally one should encode reserved characters (to prevent misinterpretation) and not encode unreserved characters (for readability), but how should characters that do not fall into either category be handled? For example { and } do not appear in either list, but they are standard ASCII characters. Looking to modern browsers for guidance, it seems they sometimes have different behaviors. For example, consider pasting the URL https://www.google.com/search?q={ into the address bar of a web browser: Chrome 34.0.1847.116 m does not change it. Firefox 28.0 does not change it. Internet Explorer 9.0 does not change it. Safari 5.1.7 changes it to https://www.google.com/search?q=%7B However, if one pastes https://www.google.com/#q={ (removing "search" and changing the ? to a #, making the character part of the fragment/hash rather than the query string) we find that: Chrome 34.0.1847.116 m changes it to https://www.google.com/#q=%7B (via JavaScript) Firefox 28.0 does not change it. Internet Explorer 9.0 does not change it. Safari 5.1.7 changes it to https://www.google.com/#q=%7B (before executing JavaScript) Furthermore, when using JavaScript to perform the request asynchronously (i.e. using this MDN example modified to use a URL of ?q={), the URL is not percent-encoded automatically. (I'm guessing this is because the XMLHttpRequest API assumes that the URL be encoded/escaped beforehand.) I would like to (for a reason related to a bizarre customer requirement) use { and } in the filename portion of URLs without (1) breaking things and ideally also without (2) creating ugly-looking percent-encoded entries in the network panel of modern browsers' web inspectors/debuggers.
@CODE::/?#[]@!$&'()*+,;= a-zA-Z0-9\-._~ { } https://www.google.com/search?q={ https://www.google.com/search?q=%7B https://www.google.com/#q={ ? # https://www.google.com/#q=%7B https://www.google.com/#q=%7B ?q={ { }

@LINK:/questions/23062116/unnecessary-project-rebuilds-when-unit-testing-in-visual-studio
@TITLE:Unnecessary project rebuilds when unit testing in Visual Studio
@CONTENT:I know about this question (and answers), but despite trying all the suggested options I am still stuck. I have a solution with multiple projects, but for this particular case let's say I've got my ExampleProjectA and a corresponding unit test project ExampleProjectATest. The first one is added as a reference to the test project - not via Visual Studio's "Project References" but as a link to the DLL (something like "..\Path\$(Config)\ExampleProjectA.dll") - this is due to build server requirements in our company, but the problem also existed when we still had "Project References". Building and then running a single unit test works fine Changing just a single letter in a unit test and then letting the test run always results in a rebuild of ExampleProjectA, even though this shouldn't be necessary Setting all (there were only a few) files in ExampleProjectA from "Copy always" to "Copy if newer" in their respective properties didn't help Checking the checkbox under Tools => Options => Projects and Solutions => Build an Run (see below) also didn't change anything To see if there was any more information available, I changed the build output settings to diagnostic. Each time a rebuild of ExampleProjectA is triggered, the first line in the output windows is 1>Project 'ExampleProjectATest' is not up to date. Input file 'c:\tfs\mysolution-dev\exampleprojectatest\myfolder\namegeneratortest.cs' is modified after output file 'C:\tfs\mysolution-dev\exampleprojectatest\bin\Release\exampleprojectatest.pdb'. The class name written to the window (e.g. namegeneratortest.cs) changes according to which test file I change. Not sure why this message comes up, but the next step was to disable the debugging information as shown below under Project properties => Build => Advanced => Output => Debug Info => None: Still the same, nothing's changed. Another thing I tried was to check the timestamps of the files contained in my solution folder (as there was a case where a user had a file with a future timestamp - see linked post) - to no avail. Last thing I tried was to change the build settings in the Configuration Manager to a different target platform - some settings wouldn't let me build the solution successfully, some other settings did, but the problem described persisted, so no change. The behaviour is similar (not the same though) with both the Visual Studio Test Runner and the one provided by ReSharper. Visual Studio Test Runner Project 'ExampleProject' is not up to date. Input file 'C:\tfs\mysolution-dev\exampleprojecta\Views\Shared\someview.cshtml' is modified after output file 'C:\tfs\mysolution-dev\exampleprojecta\bin\exampleprojecta.pdb'. ReSharper Test Runner Project 'ExampleProjectATest' is not up to date. Input file 'c:\tfs\mysolution-dev\exampleprojectatest\myfolder\namegeneratortest.cs' is modified after output file 'C:\tfs\mysolution-dev\exampleprojectatest\bin\Release\exampleprojectatest.pdb'. I'm using Visual Studio 2013 Premium Edition with ReSharper 8.2 and the latest updates, the projects in our solution file are in C#. Update To clarify - the first line in the output window does show that the test project has to be rebuilt - this is fine. The following lines, however, indicate that also ExampleProjectA has to be rebuilt, which shouldn't be necessary. Subsequent messages to the output window also show that other projects (referenced from ExampleProjectA have to be rebuilt. Update 2 Despite installing Update 4, nothing has changed.

@LINK:/questions/23037479/using-descriptors-in-unhashable-classes-python
@TITLE:Using descriptors in unhashable classes - python
@CONTENT:A common design pattern when using python descriptors is to have the descriptor keep a dictionary of instances using that descriptor. For example, suppose I want to make an attribute that counts the number of times it's accessed: class CountingAttribute(object):

    def __init__(self):
        self.count = 0
        self.value = None


class MyDescriptor(object):

    def __init__(self):
        self.instances = {} #instance -> CountingAttribute

    def __get__(self, inst, cls):
        if inst in self.instances:
           ca = self.instances[inst]
        else:
            ca = CountingAttribute()
            self.instances[inst] = ca
        ca.count += 1
        return ca


class Foo(object):
    x = MyDescriptor()


def main():
    f = Foo()
    f.x
    f.x
    print("f.x has been accessed %d times (including the one in this print)"%(f.x.count,))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
 This is a completely silly example that doesn't do anything useful; I'm trying to isolate the main point. The problem is that I can't use this descriptor in a class which isn't hashable, because the line self.instances[inst] = ca
 uses instances as a dictionary key. Is there a wise way of handling this sort of case? For example, one immediately thinks to use the instance's id, but I'm not sure if doing that will break something about how hashes are supposed to be used. EDIT: I realize that instances should be something like a weakref.WeakKeyDictionary but I'm trying to keep it simple here to focus on the issue of hashability.
@CODE:class CountingAttribute(object):

    def __init__(self):
        self.count = 0
        self.value = None

@TITLE:C++ shared_ptr vs. unique_ptr for resource management
@CONTENT:I've been mulling over use of unique_ptr vs shared_ptr vs own_solution. I've discounted the latter as I'll almost certainly get it wrong, but I have a problem with both unique_ptr and shared_ptr in that neither captures precisely what I want. I want to create a resource manager which explicitly owns a resource, however I'd like the resource manager to also hand out references to the resource. If I use unique_ptr in the resource manager and hand out raw pointers there's the possibility they could escape elsewhere (though this would be against the class "contract" I suppose). If I use shared_ptr and hand out weak_ptr, there's nothing stopping a caller from converting the weak_ptr to a shared_ptr and storing that, thereby potentially creating a cycle or worse, a resource living beyond the lifetime of the resource manager. So I suppose what I'm looking for is a deferencable weak_ptr that cannot be converted into a shared_ptr. Or am I just looking to enforce the contract with some strongly worded comments in the code? Thanks for any thoughts you might have on this.

I now need to use the Google Play Services in my android-library. As it is instructed in the official Android documentation (http://developer.android.com/google/play-services/setup.html#Setup), I need to include the Google Play Services as a library project by importing it from maven : compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services:4.3.23'

@LINK:/questions/22959915/why-cant-gcc-or-clang-properly-encode-simd-vector-types
@TITLE:Why can't gcc or clang properly @encode SIMD vector types?
@CONTENT:While doing some messing around with vector types and the ObjC runtime, I came across a very perplexing problem. Neither clang or GCC will give the 'proper' type-encoding for any SIMD vector type, as far as I can tell. #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

int main() {
    typedef int int4 __attribute__((vector_size(16)));
    typedef float float4 __attribute__((vector_size(16)));

    NSLog(@"Int4: %s", @encode(int4));
    NSLog(@"Float4: %s", @encode(float4));
}
 When compiled & run with either GCC or clang, I get the following output: 
2014-04-09 06:21:01.102 test[1707:507] Int4:
2014-04-09 06:21:01.103 test[1707:507] Float4:
 Instead of what I expect, which would be something like this: 
2014-04-09 06:21:01.102 test[1707:507] Int4: ![16,16i]
2014-04-09 06:21:01.103 test[1707:507] Float4: ![16,16f]
 As per the documentation here: vectors ???? ![ followed by the vector_size (the number of bytes composing the vector) followed by a comma, followed by the alignment (in bytes) of the vector, followed by the type of the elements followed by ] Which becomes a problem when attempting to return these types from an ObjC method, as instead of getting something logical like ![16,16i]@: for the encoding of the following method: -(int4) foo;
 I only get the string @:, which causes both NSMethodSignature and NSInvocation to essentially crap their pants, and segfault. Is there some compiler option I can enable to restore the proper encoding of vector types? Or is the only solution here 'don't return vectors from an ObjC method'? Note: Returning (or passing) a pointer to the vector doesn't help either, as the encoding for a pointer-to-vector is simply ^, which then greedily-matches the next argument in the list, causing my argument count to be off once again. I suppose I could cast the vector to a void *, but that really is an ugly hack at that point.
@CODE:#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

int main() {
    typedef int int4 __attribute__((vector_size(16)));
    typedef float float4 __attribute__((vector_size(16)));

    NSLog(@"Int4: %s", @encode(int4));
    NSLog(@"Float4: %s", @encode(float4));
} ![16,16i]@: -(int4) foo; @: NSMethodSignature NSInvocation ^ void *

@TITLE:Invalid method reference for overloaded method with different arities
@CONTENT:When trying to compile the expression Comparator.comparing(String::toLowerCase), the Java Compiler returns an error. See the following question for more information: Why Comparator.comparing doesn't work with String::toLowerCase method reference? I have tried to reduce the problem as much as possible. In particular, I have removed almost all dependencies to other classes. The main method contains two method invocations. The first statement compiles without errors, whereas the second statement produces an error. interface Fun<T, R> { R apply(T t); }

public final class Foo {
    public static void main(String... args) {
        invoke(Foo::bar); // OK
        invoke(Foo::baz); // ERROR
    }
    private static <T, U> void invoke(Fun<T, U> f) { }
    private String bar() { return null; }
    private String baz() { return null; }
    private String baz(Integer i, Integer j) { return null; }
}
 This is strange, because the second baz method shouldn't be applicable in this context, due to the mismatch in the number of parameters. I have taken a look at the JLS8 (15.13). However, it was no help, because the rules for method references are quite complex. Q: Why is there a compilation error for the second case? Should there really be a compilation error according to the JLS? According to some comments on the other question, there is no compilation error in Netbeans. For reference, I am using the JDK8 version 1.8.0-b132. If a compile the program on the command line, the compiler shows the following error message: $ /opt/jdk8/bin/javac Foo.java

This is critical because HashMap uses power-of-two length hash tables, that otherwise encounter collisions for hashCodes that do not differ in lower bits. What I am not able to understand is, 1) Why HashMap uses power-of-two length hash tables? It is stated while declaring table too: /**

 Why this constraint? 2) What does otherwise encounter collisions for hashCodes that do not differ in lower bits. mean?

@TITLE:April 2014/iOS 7 - Is there a way to track conversions of iOS apps to attribute downloads to different campaign sources without using IDFA?
@CONTENT:With Apple's new crackdown on apps that use the IDFA (advertising identifier/IdentifierForAdvertisers) but don't serve ads, is there any way to track conversions of different ads or advertising providers? For example, Admob's SDK download page states: The iOS SDK utilizes Apple's advertising identifier (IDFA). The SDK uses IDFA under the guidelines laid out in the iOS developer program license agreement. You must ensure you are in compliance with the iOS developer program license agreement policies governing the use of this identifier. I need the SDK if I want to track app installs from different sources, but my app will (probably) be rejected if I use it, given that it doesn't include ads. Coming from an Adwords background where every campaign, ad text and targeting is meticulously cross-tested, the idea of spraying ad spend without having any idea what's converting is pretty horrible. That being said, I've not seen that much outcry, so I'm wondering if I'm missing something? Potential solutions that I've thought of: Game the system: Code ads into my app for "non-premium members". The account I create for the Apple reviewer will be a non-premium member. Once the app is approved, I make sure that all my user's accounts are switched to premium, so the ads are never actually shown. Downside: they may reject me anyway if the IDFA is pulled by the app in a place irrelevant to serving ads, and even if they don't it could lead to problems down the line. Advertising providers who want to allow their users to track ad conversion implementing some sort of IP-and-GPS-location fingerprinting to link up the tap from the advertising app to the install of the advertised app. Downside: this isn't something I can do - it's up to Admob et al to sort it out. Do high-level tracking/testing of campaigns by, for example, running one campaign for a week and measuring overall download stats, and then another for another week, and measuring again. Downside: This is a rubbish way of digital marketing and makes test iterations painfully slow. Am I missing something here - and if not, is there a better way than 1, 2 or 3?

@TITLE:How can I achieve this mix of StackPanel and UniformGrid behavior?
@CONTENT:I want to put elements inside a control so that they initially fit like this (like a StackPanel with Horizontal orientation): But then, when the elements stack to the point they won't fit anymore in the screen, I want them to start behaving like this: Like an UniformGrid: as the number of elements increase, they become smaller. What would be the best or any way to do this? Since the external control size is variable (it depends on the user's screen size) I can't "hack" it to use one component or another depending on the number of elements because I can't predict the number it takes to "break" the screen.

}
 It might be that the service calls themselves also have multuple awaits. The await will typically be against an async call to entity framework, a service bus or a 3rd party web endpoint. One of my colleagues came to be today suggesting that this kind of code was pointless, that it would simply generate extra work for thread management and the under load we would be actually generate more work for the for the runtime and slow the app down as a result. Are they right and if so what is considered best practise for async / await when you have multiple IO bound calls in a Web API request?

@CONTENT:if anybody with some knowledge about pretty printing JSON could help me with this I would be extremely grateful! I'm looking to convert a complex python string into JSON format, using the function below to move the JSON string to a file: with open('data.txt', 'wt') as out:
    pprint(string, stream=out)
 The problem is that I'm getting syntax errors for the square brackets I believe, as this is a new topic for me and I can't figure out how to get around this. The JSON format I require is like this:   {
        cols:[{id: 'Time', "label":"Time","type": "datetime"},
              {id: 'Time', "label":"Latency","type":"number"}],
        rows:[{c: [{v: %s}, {v: %s}]},

              ]
    }
 I'm following the Google Visualization API, you may be familier with it, but I need dynamic graphs. The above code is the format which the API requires to create a graph, so I am in the process of figuring out how to get my data from MYSQL into this format, so the graph can read and be displayed. The method I thought of was to update a file containing the required JSON format periodically, which is why the %s are present, however MartijnPeters suggests this is invalid. Does anybody know the simplest way I can do this, or can you point me to any material which can help? Thank you!!

@CONTENT:I'm having problems with my Playframework application not being responsive from time to time and I would like to detect this at runtime + log information on what is currently running on the exhausted execution context. What would the best strategy for implementing this be? I thought about posting small runnables to the execution contexts and if they don't get executed in time I would log a warning. This max wait time should of course be configurable. Eg the main web execution context should never be blocked for more than 1 sec but a background db execution context might allow 30 sec of blocking. Somebody must have done this before? related info: http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.2.x/ThreadPools

@LINK:/questions/22749126/surface-reconstruction-from-2-planar-contours
@TITLE:Surface reconstruction from 2 planar contours [closed]
@CONTENT:There is a class of algorithms for triangulation between two planar contours. These algorithms try to make a "good triangulation" to fill a space between these contours: One of them (Optimal surface reconstruction from planar contours) is based on the dynamic programming technique and uses a cost function for determining which triangulation is acceptable according to the minimum cost. A minimal triangle area as a cost function makes a good result in most of cases (Triangulation of Branching Contours using Area Minimization), but, unfortunately, not in all of them. For example when you have two rectangle contours that are shifted from each other. As you can see, according to the minimal area criteria, all points from the contour \alpha will be connected to the point A of the contour \beta, that is not true (a correct triangulation must be a "tube" through both curves, instead of two tetrahedrons). So my questions are: 1) Does any algorithm that deals with two contours better than the dynamic programming based one exist? 2) If not, which criteria for the cost function can provide a better result?

I'm just trying to analyze whether this is mature enough at this point where you can be 100% sure of what's going on with your data end-to-end, or is there a bit of a black box area where "things just work"?

    Build step 'Execute shell' marked build as failure
 What I did so far: The user is the same in Jenkins and on the command line (see this SO question) The user is the build machine's root user The provisioning is working with another sample project I set up (i.e. it's not a keychain issue) I installed current Xcode 5.1 command line tools and did a manual xcode-select I used export DEVELOPER_DIR="/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer" before calling the xcodebuild command I deleted DerivedData before runnig the Jenkins job EDIT: I forgot to mention that this project uses CocoaPods, not sure if that might be the reason it doesn't build. EDIT 2: I added some more error output. I am checking my Pods folder into git. The same project builds without any issues on the command line. There is absolutely no difference in the command, I triple checked. Unfortunately I can not use the Xcode plugin for various customisation reasons. But even if I could, I really wanna find out whats the difference between the two environments. Update: I just seems to fail to compile some of the .m files in my project the output is always a bit different from one build to another. I also added a dependency in my build scheme to make sure CocoaPods is built before anything else. Still no idea why some files are causing this problem. Can someone please confirm that they can still build projects from Jenkins with xcodebuild Xcode 5.1 Build version 5B130a?

@TITLE:Get argument type of template callable object
@CONTENT:Consider the following function: template<class F>
void register_handler( F& f ) // any callable object
{
   // find out T - the argument type of f
}
 Here f is some callable object, accepting one argument. It may be a function pointer, an std::function or a result of std::bind. The problem is, how to determine the argument type of f and do some actions based on that type? An easy workaround would be to add the type to template explicitly, like template<class T, class F> // T is the argument type of F
void register_handler( F& f )
 but this seems an overkill because type F should already contain the necessary information about type T.
@CODE:template<class F>
void register_handler( F& f ) // any callable object
{
   // find out T - the argument type of f
} f std::function std::bind f template<class T, class F> // T is the argument type of F
void register_handler( F& f ) F T f

@TITLE:VHDL: Is there a convenient way to assign ascii values to std_logic_vector?
@CONTENT:In verilog, I can assign a string to a vector like: wire [39:0] hello;
assign hello = "hello"; 
 In VHDL, I'm having difficulty finding a method like this: SIGNAL hello : OUT std_logic_vector (39 DOWNTO 0);
...
hello <= "hello";
 I've been using: hello <= X"65_68_6c_6c_6f";
 which is unclear and time consuming for large strings. I've looked at the textio package and thetxt_util package, but neither seem to be very clear on how to interpret a string and convert it to std_logic. Is there a simple method of assigning ascii codes to std_logic in VHDL? Here's a minimal example: LIBRARY ieee;
USE ieee.std_logic_1164.ALL;

   ctrl : IN std_logic;
   stdout : OUT std_logic_vector (39 DOWNTO 0)

What would be the best or any way to do this? Since the external control size is variable (it depends on the user's screen size) I can't "hack" it to use one component or another depending on the number of elements because I can't predict the number it takes to "break" the screen.

I am using the Apache libraries for Java. public HttpResponse http(String url, String body) throws IOException {

    try (CloseableHttpClient httpClient = HttpClientBuilder.create().build()) {
        HttpPost request = new HttpPost(url);
        StringEntity params = new StringEntity(body);
        request.addHeader("content-type", "application/json");

        //httpClient.execute(request);
        HttpResponse result = httpClient.execute(request);

    } catch (IOException ex) {
    }
    return null;
}
 And as body, I would pass the following (an example): {"example":1,"fr":"lol"}
 I have absolutely no idea about how to retrieve the JSON values from the response, either.

    return new SomeViewModel
    {

}
 It might be that the service calls themselves also have multuple awaits. The await will typically be against an async call to entity framework, a service bus or a 3rd party web endpoint. One of my colleagues came to be today suggesting that this kind of code was pointless, that it would simply generate extra work for thread management and the under load we would be actually generate more work for the for the runtime and slow the app down as a result. Are they right and if so what is considered best practise for async / await when you have multiple IO bound calls in a Web API request?

@TITLE:Pretty print JSON python
@CONTENT:if anybody with some knowledge about pretty printing JSON could help me with this I would be extremely grateful! I'm looking to convert a complex python string into JSON format, using the function below to move the JSON string to a file: with open('data.txt', 'wt') as out:
    pprint(string, stream=out)
 The problem is that I'm getting syntax errors for the square brackets I believe, as this is a new topic for me and I can't figure out how to get around this. The JSON format I require is like this:   {
        cols:[{id: 'Time', "label":"Time","type": "datetime"},
              {id: 'Time', "label":"Latency","type":"number"}],
        rows:[{c: [{v: %s}, {v: %s}]},
              {c: [{v: %s}, {v: %s}]}, 
              {c: [{v: %s}, {v: %s}]},
              {c: [{v: %s}, {v: %s}]}
              ]
    }
 I'm following the Google Visualization API, you may be familier with it, but I need dynamic graphs. The above code is the format which the API requires to create a graph, so I am in the process of figuring out how to get my data from MYSQL into this format, so the graph can read and be displayed. The method I thought of was to update a file containing the required JSON format periodically, which is why the %s are present, however MartijnPeters suggests this is invalid. Does anybody know the simplest way I can do this, or can you point me to any material which can help? Thank you!!

@TITLE:How to detect scala executioncontext exhaustion?
@CONTENT:I'm having problems with my Playframework application not being responsive from time to time and I would like to detect this at runtime + log information on what is currently running on the exhausted execution context. What would the best strategy for implementing this be? I thought about posting small runnables to the execution contexts and if they don't get executed in time I would log a warning. This max wait time should of course be configurable. Eg the main web execution context should never be blocked for more than 1 sec but a background db execution context might allow 30 sec of blocking. Somebody must have done this before? related info: http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.2.x/ThreadPools

@LINK:/questions/22749126/surface-reconstruction-from-2-planar-contours
@TITLE:Surface reconstruction from 2 planar contours [closed]
@CONTENT:There is a class of algorithms for triangulation between two planar contours. These algorithms try to make a "good triangulation" to fill a space between these contours: One of them (Optimal surface reconstruction from planar contours) is based on the dynamic programming technique and uses a cost function for determining which triangulation is acceptable according to the minimum cost. A minimal triangle area as a cost function makes a good result in most of cases (Triangulation of Branching Contours using Area Minimization), but, unfortunately, not in all of them. For example when you have two rectangle contours that are shifted from each other. As you can see, according to the minimal area criteria, all points from the contour \alpha will be connected to the point A of the contour \beta, that is not true (a correct triangulation must be a "tube" through both curves, instead of two tetrahedrons). So my questions are: 1) Does any algorithm that deals with two contours better than the dynamic programming based one exist? 2) If not, which criteria for the cost function can provide a better result?

I'm just trying to analyze whether this is mature enough at this point where you can be 100% sure of what's going on with your data end-to-end, or is there a bit of a black box area where "things just work"?

Is there a simple way to do this, or will I have to explicitly write in my class file the method name and precede that with a label?

    Build step 'Execute shell' marked build as failure
 What I did so far: The user is the same in Jenkins and on the command line (see this SO question) The user is the build machine's root user The provisioning is working with another sample project I set up (i.e. it's not a keychain issue) I installed current Xcode 5.1 command line tools and did a manual xcode-select I used export DEVELOPER_DIR="/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer" before calling the xcodebuild command I deleted DerivedData before runnig the Jenkins job EDIT: I forgot to mention that this project uses CocoaPods, not sure if that might be the reason it doesn't build. EDIT 2: I added some more error output. I am checking my Pods folder into git. The same project builds without any issues on the command line. There is absolutely no difference in the command, I triple checked. Unfortunately I can not use the Xcode plugin for various customisation reasons. But even if I could, I really wanna find out whats the difference between the two environments. Update: I just seems to fail to compile some of the .m files in my project the output is always a bit different from one build to another. I also added a dependency in my build scheme to make sure CocoaPods is built before anything else. Still no idea why some files are causing this problem. Can someone please confirm that they can still build projects from Jenkins with xcodebuild Xcode 5.1 Build version 5B130a?

@TITLE:NodeJS HTTPS API testing with mocha and super test -DEPTH_ZERO_SELF_SIGNED_CERT

 // ok or not logs

});
 and this is the route to be tested app.get('/hello',function (req, res) {
   res.json(200);
});
 I'm trying to test with this code in test/test.js     var supertest = require('supertest'),

@CONTENT:Consider the following function: template<class F>

 Here f is some callable object, accepting one argument. It may be a function pointer, an std::function or a result of std::bind. The problem is, how to determine the argument type of f and do some actions based on that type? An easy workaround would be to add the type to template explicitly, like template<class T, class F> // T is the argument type of F
void register_handler( F& f )
 but this seems an overkill because type F should already contain the necessary information about type T.
@CODE:template<class F>
void register_handler( F& f ) // any callable object

@LINK:/questions/22613143/different-json-output-when-using-custom-json-serializer-in-spring-data-rest
@TITLE:Different JSON output when using custom json serializer in Spring Data Rest
@CONTENT:After adding a custom Jackson serializer based on the official documenation I've observed a slightly different json output format. This example is based on a fork of spring-restbucks. Extend org.springsource.restbucks.WebConfiguration from RepositoryRestMvcConfiguration and override configureJacksonObjectMapper: @Override
protected void configureJacksonObjectMapper(ObjectMapper objectMapper) {
    final SimpleSerializers serializers = new SimpleSerializers();
    serializers.addSerializer(Order.class, new OrderSerializer());
    objectMapper.registerModule(new SimpleModule("CustomSerializerModule"){
        @Override public void setupModule(SetupContext context) {
            context.addSerializers(serializers);
        }
    });
}
 Create class org.springsource.restbucks.order.OrderSerializer. For the sake of brevity just write attribute paid as JSON. public class OrderSerializer extends JsonSerializer<Order> {
    @Override
    public void serialize(Order value, JsonGenerator jgen, SerializerProvider provider) throws IOException {
        jgen.writeStartObject();
        jgen.writeBooleanField("paid", value.isPaid());
        jgen.writeEndObject();
    }
}
 Before adding OrderSerializer json response for http://localhost:8080/orders/1 looks like: {
  "location": "TAKE_AWAY",
  "status": "PAYMENT_EXPECTED",
  "orderedDate": "2014-03-24T15:05:09.988+01:00",
  "items": [
    {
      "name": "Java Chip",
      "quantity": 1,
      "milk": "SEMI",
      "size": "LARGE",
      "price": {
        "currency": "EUR",
        "value": 4.2
      }
    }
  ],
  "_links": {
    ...
  }
}
 After adding OrderSerializer json response for http://localhost:8080/orders/1 looks like {
  "content": {
    "paid": false
  },
  "_links": {
    ...
  }
}
 The main pinpoint is that attribute paid is wrapped into another object content which is an attribute of org.springframework.hateoas.Resource. I've expected a response without this attribute: {
  "paid": false,  
  "_links": {
    ...
  }
}
 I've looked into Jackson code and found that UnwrappingBeanSerializer might be the solution I'm looking for. After looking at how to initialize UnwrappingBeanSerializer I think that this serializer is not meant to be subclassed for custom use. I would like to know whether this deviating json format when using a custom serializer is a normal behaviour or a bug in Spring Data Rest. Any kind of help is appreciated.
@CODE:Jackson org.springsource.restbucks.WebConfiguration RepositoryRestMvcConfiguration configureJacksonObjectMapper @Override
protected void configureJacksonObjectMapper(ObjectMapper objectMapper) {
    final SimpleSerializers serializers = new SimpleSerializers();
    serializers.addSerializer(Order.class, new OrderSerializer());
    objectMapper.registerModule(new SimpleModule("CustomSerializerModule"){
        @Override public void setupModule(SetupContext context) {
            context.addSerializers(serializers);
        }
    });
} org.springsource.restbucks.order.OrderSerializer paid public class OrderSerializer extends JsonSerializer<Order> {
    @Override
    public void serialize(Order value, JsonGenerator jgen, SerializerProvider provider) throws IOException {
        jgen.writeStartObject();
        jgen.writeBooleanField("paid", value.isPaid());
        jgen.writeEndObject();
    }
} http://localhost:8080/orders/1 {

@TITLE:Uncaught InvalidValueError: not a Feature or FeatureCollection
@CONTENT:After seeing a recent video by the Google Devs I decided to do a regional map of the UK. There were a couple of possibilities mentioned on this site that I've since had to dismiss* So I ended up using this site (example page of data downloads): http://mapit.mysociety.org/area/11804.html Notice the GeoJSON download as the third link down? Its about a 1Mb file size. When I first tried using it with my map: function initMap(){
    var ukc = new google.maps.LatLng(54.8, -4.6);
    var mapOptions = {
        zoom: 5,
        center: ukc
    };
    map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById('map-canvas'), mapOptions);
    map.data.loadGeoJson('http://local.mapsite.com:8080/app/jsondata/eastern.json');
}

$(document).ready(function(){
    initMap();
});
 I got the above error: Uncaught InvalidValueError: not a Feature or FeatureCollection Fix Attempt 1 - Google it Googling the error came back with nothing useful. Fix Attempt 2 - Shrink it I thought maybe it was the sheer size of the beast so I shrank it using mapshaper.org to a more manageable 10K. Still no luck! Fix Attempt 3 - Lint it Maybe my GeoJSON was badly formatted? But how could it be considering it was right there working on mapit.org but I found this wonderful site for linting GeoJSON data: http://geojsonlint.com/ - The linting worked! Apparently the GeoJSON worked so well that it drew my polygon of East Anglia on the UK in all its glory (note geojsonlint uses OpenStreetMap). But still No Luck Fix Attempt 4 - TopoJson Hoping I could combine the regions and compress at the same time I thought desperately that topojson would work. I tried - I still got that same error. Here's a link to my topojson file shared on Google Drive: someregions.json No luck. Fix Attempt 5 - Add Feature code to start of JSON The current GeoJSON file starts {"bbox":[-0.745702,51.448473,1.767999,52.98991],"type":"GeometryCollection","geometries":... I added: {"type": "Feature", "bbox":[-0.745702,51.448473,1.767999,52.98991],"type":"GeometryCollection","geometries":
 Fix Attempt 6 Retry different regions as they donm't contain the bbox parameter near the start but simply start { "type": "Polygon", "coordinates": [ [ [ -3.155785, 53.427385 ], [ -3.151533, 53.427328 ], [... Still no luck. In (Failed) Conclusion Even though I proved my file was small enough, linted and worked elsewhere I still got those infuriating error messages from the console when attempting to put them on my map. Uncaught InvalidValueError: not a Feature or FeatureCollection
 Here is my shrunk GeoJSON file publically shared via GDrive: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B42Aec8RKcHtNVNZZUxqV0Y5Rkk/edit?usp=sharing My next attempts will involve topojson to compress all regions into one with internal borders but I wanted to check here first to see if anyone knows what my problem could be? Because that may be another few hours of futile energy wasted. * Attempting to use Ordanance Survey data failed as they provided SHD data and not SHP as stated in a previous question on the subject. So I couldn't convert it into GeoJSON using ogr2ogr.

@TITLE:Dragging views on a scroll view: touchesBegan is received, but no touchesEnded or touchesCancelled
@CONTENT:As an iOS programming newbie I am struggling with a word game for iPhone. The app structure is: scrollView -> contentView -> imageView -> image 1000 x 1000 (here fullscreen): I think I have finally understood how to use an UIScrollView with Auto Layout enabled in Xcode 5.1: I just specify enough constraints (dimensions 1000 x 1000 and also 0 to the parent) for the contentView and this defines the _scrollView.contentSize (I don't have to set it explicitly) - after that my game board scrolls and zooms just fine. However I have troubles with my draggable letter tiles implemented in Tile.m. I use touchesBegan, touchesMoved, touchesEnded, touchesCancelled and not gesture recognizers (as often suggested by StackOverflow users), because I display larger letter tile image with shadow (the bigImage) on touchesBegan. My dragging is implemented in the following way: In touchesBegan I remove the tile from contentView (and add it to the main app view) and display bigImage with shadow. In touchesMoved I move the tile In touchesEnded or touchesCancelled I display smallImage with shadow again and - add the tile to the contentView or leave it in the main view (if the tile is at the bottom of the app). My problem: Mostly this works, but sometimes (often) I see that only touchesBegan was called, but the other touchesXXXX methods are never called: 2014-03-22 20:20:20.244 ScrollContent[8075:60b] -[Tile touchesBegan:withEvent:]: Tile J 10 {367.15002, 350.98877} {57.599998, 57.599998}
 Instead the scrollView is scrolled by the finger, underneath the big tile. This results in many big tiles with shadows sitting on the screen of my app, while the scroll view is being dragged underneath them: How to fix this please? I know for sure that my structure of the app (with custom UIViews dragged in/out of a UIScrollView) is possible - by looking at popular word games. I use tile.exclusiveTouch = YES and a custom hitTest method for the contentView - but this doesn't help: - (UIView *)hitTest:(CGPoint)point withEvent:(UIEvent *)event
{
    UIView* result = [super hitTest:point withEvent:event];

    return result == self ? nil : result;
}
 UPDATE 1: I've tried adding the following code to handleTileTouched: _contentView.userInteractionEnabled = NO;
_scrollView.userInteractionEnabled = NO;
_scrollView.scrollEnabled = NO;
 and then set it back to YES in handleTileReleased of ViewController.m - but this does not help and also looks more like a hack to me. UPDATE 2: Having read probably everything related to UIScrollView, hitTest:withEvent: and pointInside:withEvent: - on the web (for ex. Hacking the responder chain and Matt Neuburg's Programming iOS book), StackOverflow and Safari, it seems to me, that a solution would be to implement the hitTest:withEvent: method for the main view of my app: If a Tile object is hit, it should be returned. Otherwise - the scrollView should be returned. Unfortunately, this doesn't work - I am probably missing something minor. And I am sure that a good solution exists - by studying popular word games for iOS. For example dragging and placement of letter tiles works very smooth in Zynga's Words with Friends ? app and in the screenshots below you can see them probably using UIScrollView (the scroll bars are visible in the corner) and displaying a tile shadow (probably in touchesBegan method): UPDATE 3: I've created a new project to test gesture recognizer suggested by TomSwift and it shows the problem I have with gesture recognizers: the tile size changes too late - it happens, when the user starts moving the tile and not at the moment he touches it:
@CODE:scrollView -> contentView -> imageView -> image 1000 x 1000 UIScrollView contentView _scrollView.contentSize touchesBegan, touchesMoved, touchesEnded, touchesCancelled bigImage touchesBegan touchesBegan contentView bigImage touchesMoved touchesEnded touchesCancelled smallImage contentView touchesBegan touchesXXXX 2014-03-22 20:20:20.244 ScrollContent[8075:60b] -[Tile touchesBegan:withEvent:]: Tile J 10 {367.15002, 350.98877} {57.599998, 57.599998} scrollView UIView UIScrollView tile.exclusiveTouch = YES - (UIView *)hitTest:(CGPoint)point withEvent:(UIEvent *)event

    UIView* result = [super hitTest:point withEvent:event];

@TITLE:bootstrap datepicker, beforeShowDay and array of disabled dates
@CONTENT:I am trying to use bootstrap datepicker plugin (https://github.com/eternicode/bootstrap-datepicker/blob/release/docs/index.rst) with array of disabled days passed into it. My code (partial):  var disabled_dates = ["23.03.2014","21.03.2014"];
 $("#datepicker").datepicker({
      language: "pl",
      autoclose: true,
      startDate: '+1d',
      weekStart: 1,
      default: 'dd.mm.yyyy',
      beforeShowDay: function(date){
           var formattedDate = $.fn.datepicker.DPGlobal.formatDate(date, 'dd.mm.yyyy', 'pl');
           if ($.inArray(formattedDate.toString(), disabled_dates) != -1){
               return {
                  enabled : false
               };
           }
          return;
      }
  });
 it works (almost) OK. It disables wrong date. Instead of disabling 23.03.2014 it disabled 24.04.2014. I am not sure where is the issue, on timezone maybe? Any suggestions?
@CODE:var disabled_dates = ["23.03.2014","21.03.2014"];
 $("#datepicker").datepicker({
      language: "pl",
      autoclose: true,
      startDate: '+1d',
      weekStart: 1,

               return {

               };

@TITLE:Poltergeist Stripe checkout.js
@CONTENT:I'm trying to test in my Rails app the Stripe checkout popup (http://www.stripe.com/checkout). I was using Capybara + selenium-driver and everything worked well. When the page is loaded, the checkout.js adds an iframe, and I was able to access it within_frame('stripe_checkout_app') do
 do something
end
 Now, switching to Poltergeist, I get this error: Failure/Error: within_frame('stripe_checkout_app') do Capybara::Poltergeist::FrameNotFound: The frame 'stripe_checkout_app' was not found. and if I inspect the page, there's not iframe. So I think that this script <script type="text/javascript" src="https://checkout.stripe.com/checkout.js"></script> is not loaded when I run the test with Poltergeist. Update I tried to run the test with Capybara-webkit, with same result. Failure/Error: Capybara.within_frame('stripe_checkout_app') do

@TITLE:Adding an Argument to a Function in LLVM
@CONTENT:I wish to write an LLVM pass that two arguments of type i32 to select functions. My first try (sketched below) failed: bool MyFunctionPass::runOnFunction(Function &f)

    Argument *xC = new Argument(int32, "__xC", &f);

 The module verifier crashes if I try the above. The newly added argument type is junk 0xCDCDCDCD (uninitialized heap memory). The function type remains: void (i32 addrspace(1)*, i32 addrspace(1)*, i32)
 instead of being extended by the new i32. Also, adding the parameter directly to the parameter list Function::getArgumentList() failed as the Argument constructor links itself to the function, and this is detected as a double link. Do I need a ModulePass to do this, or will a FunctionPass suffice? Is there an elegant way of doing this? Thanks!

@CONTENT:Is there a way of elegantly calculating the correlations between values if those values are stored by group in a single column of a data.table (other than converting the data.table to a matrix)? library(data.table)
set.seed(1)             # reproducibility
dt <- data.table(id=1:4, group=rep(letters[1:2], c(4,4)), value=rnorm(8))

#    id group      value

# 7:  3     b  0.4874291
# 8:  4     b  0.7383247
 Something that works, but requires the group names as input: cor(dt["a"]$value, dt["b"]$value)
# [1] 0.1556371
 I'm looking more for something like: dt[, cor(value, value), by="group"]
 But that does not give me the correlation(s) I'm after. Here's the same problem for a matrix with the correct results. set.seed(1)             # reproducibility
m <- matrix(rnorm(8), ncol=2)
dimnames(m) <- list(id=1:4, group=letters[1:2])

#        group

@TITLE:Is there any way to add a hint or tooltip with FireMonkey?
@CONTENT:I've earched for it but couldn't find anything. Is there any way to add a hint or tooltip with FireMonkey? Are there any components available that enable this? Ideally I am looking for something like this (a callout type tooltip): To the moderators who have placed this question on hold: I am looking for lines of source code on how to achieve this, not a software to buy/use. There are currently (AFAIK) no source code components that enable doing this, so there is no risk of "opinionated anwers or spam".

@LINK:/questions/22363830/sharing-scope-across-awaits
@TITLE:Sharing scope across awaits
@CONTENT:I have a UserScope class which functions similarly to TransactionScope, i.e., it stores the current state in a thread local. This of course doesn't work across calls to await, and neither did TransactionScope until TransactionScopeAsyncFlowOption was added in .NET 4.5.1. What alternative to thread local can I use so that UserScope can be used the same in single-threaded and multi-threaded scenarios? (If I had 4.5.1 installed I'd decompile to see how TransactionScope does it.) This is a simplified version of what I have: class User {
    readonly string name;

    public User(string name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public string Name {
        get { return this.name; }
    }
}

class UserScope : IDisposable {
    readonly User user;

    [ThreadStatic]
    static UserScope currentScope;

    public UserScope(User user) {
        this.user = user;
        currentScope = this;
    }

    public static User User {
        get { return currentScope != null ? currentScope.user : null; }
    }

    public void Dispose() {
        ///...
    }
}
 And this is a test I'd expect to work: static async Task Test() {
    var user = new User("Thread Flintstone");
    using (new UserScope(user)) {
        await Task.Run(delegate {
            Console.WriteLine("Crashing with NRE...");
            Console.WriteLine("The current user is: {0}", UserScope.User.Name);
        });
    }
}

static void Main(string[] args) {
    Test().Wait();
    Console.ReadLine();
}
@CODE:UserScope TransactionScope await TransactionScope TransactionScopeAsyncFlowOption UserScope TransactionScope class User {

@LINK:/questions/22342526/aspectj-load-time-weaving-not-working-on-spring-beans
@TITLE:AspectJ load time weaving not working on Spring beans
@CONTENT:I'm working on a project that uses the Java (not xml) flavour of Spring configuration for wiring up dependencies. It also has profiling logic that should be weaved via AspectJ onto the desired methods (via annotations). The setup is working and I can see classes from my desired package being weaved and profiling information being logged out of them. The problem is that weaving does not work for @Bean classes. I've enabled debug in aop.xml via: <weaver options="-XnoInline -Xreweavable -verbose -debug -showWeaveInfo">
 And I can see classes in my desired package being weaved, but not the beans in the configuration. If I instantiate the classes directly (not inject them) weaving works. Unfortunately, I can't post real code here, but here's a dumbed down example: @Configuration
@EnableLoadTimeWeaving(aspectjWeaving = EnableLoadTimeWeaving.AspectJWeaving.ENABLED)
public class MySpringConfig {
    @Bean
    AnnotatedClass1 annotatedClass1() {
        return new AnnotatedClass1(new AnnotatedClass2());
    }
}
 AnnotatedClass1 and AnnotatedClass2 live in the same package and weaving works on the one instantiated directly and not the one returned by the bean. I've searched through the Spring AOP docs but I can't seem to find anything related to this. There is some magic you need to do for auto-proxying and some limitations for SpringAOP but load time weaving should just work as far as I can tell - I've tried on private methods for example and it worked.
@CODE:@Bean aop.xml <weaver options="-XnoInline -Xreweavable -verbose -debug -showWeaveInfo"> @Configuration
@EnableLoadTimeWeaving(aspectjWeaving = EnableLoadTimeWeaving.AspectJWeaving.ENABLED)
public class MySpringConfig {
    @Bean
    AnnotatedClass1 annotatedClass1() {
        return new AnnotatedClass1(new AnnotatedClass2());
    }
} AnnotatedClass1 AnnotatedClass2

 And the only addition to the log is: Started GET "/assets/favicon.ico" for 127.0.0.1 at 2014-03-11 23:54:00 -0400
 During the 30 seconds of it looking good, chrome has a loading symbol where the favicon goes My html is rather simple at this point: <div class="home-images">
  <%= image_tag "taylor.jpg", class: "home-image" %>
  <%= image_tag "wide.jpg", class: "home-image hide" %>
  <%= image_tag "sad.jpg", class: "home-image hide" %>
</div>
 I even took out my javascript completely. I tried removing turbolinks by itself too. It only happens to one image. And I have no idea why... When I switched the html, it was the same image (taylor) that gave the error: <div class="home-images">
  <%= image_tag "wide.jpg", class: "home-image" %>
  <%= image_tag "taylor.jpg", class: "home-image hide" %>

 Intellij spins forever in the background task saying "Processing indices" when the repo is http://nexus.company.com/nexus/repo is added. Without it things work just fine except the internal artifacts are not available for download. However, the maven project requiring the same artifacts downloads and is ready in a few seconds. I am very new to gradle. Did I make any mistake?

@TITLE:how to avoid glitches in Rx
@CONTENT:Unlike other "FRP" libraries, Rx doesn't prevent glitches: callbacks invoked with time-mismatched data. Is there a good way to work around this? As an example, imagine that we have a series of expensive computations derived from a single stream (e.g. instead of _.identity, below, we do a sort, or an ajax fetch). We do distinctUntilChanged to avoid recomputing the expensive things. sub = new Rx.Subject();
a = sub.distinctUntilChanged().share();
b = a.select(_.identity).distinctUntilChanged().share();
c = b.select(_.identity).distinctUntilChanged();
d = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(a, b, c, function () { return _.toArray(arguments); });
d.subscribe(console.log.bind(console));
sub.onNext('a');
sub.onNext('b');
 The second event will end up causing a number of glitchy states: we get three events out, instead of one, which wastes a bunch of cpu and requires us to explicitly work around the mismatched data. This particular example can be worked around by dropping the distinctUntilChanged, and writing some wonky scan() functions to pass through the previous result if the input hasn't changed. Then you can zip the results, instead of using combineLatest. It's clumsy, but doable. However if there is asynchrony anywhere, e.g. an ajax call, then zip doesn't work: the ajax call will complete either synchronously (if cached) or asynchronously, so you can't use zip. Edit Trying to clarify the desired behavior with a simpler example: You have two streams, a and b. b depends on a. b is asynchronous, but the browser may cache it, so it can either update independently of a, or at the same time as a. So, a particular event in the browser can cause one of three things: a updates; b updates; both a and b update. The desired behavior is to have a callback (e.g. render method) invoked exactly once in all three cases. zip does not work, because when a or b fires alone, we get no callback from zip. combineLatest does not work because when a and b fire together we get two callbacks.
@CODE:sub = new Rx.Subject();
a = sub.distinctUntilChanged().share();
b = a.select(_.identity).distinctUntilChanged().share();
c = b.select(_.identity).distinctUntilChanged();
d = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(a, b, c, function () { return _.toArray(arguments); });
d.subscribe(console.log.bind(console));
sub.onNext('a');
sub.onNext('b'); a.merge(b).throttle(10) bufferWithTime a b

@TITLE:Home button override in android
@CONTENT:Im trying to understand the ways to override the home button functionality in Android. Im doing a LockScreen App and the HOME button is unlocking the device. I have been researching the last 3 days for a way to do it, and all the solutions I have found are not 100% effective (mostly due to the nature of HOME). I have implemented solutions for all the solutions below in these three days but Im still not satisfied. Problem: I want to be able to override the HOME button functionality the same way as the WidgetLocker app in the AppStore. WidgetLocker is not a home launcher and it still can override the HOME better than anyone. Link to WidgetLocker App Disclaimer First of all, I know that this is a security measure in Android so that an App does not take full control of the device, and I agree with it. The official way is to implement a home launcher and its my preferred of them all, unfortunately my boss is still not 100% convinced on the path I selected, until I exhaust all other possibilities. It must be for 4.0+ version of android Solutions Implement as Home launcher, catch the HOME intent and take care of home button presses, this has the problem that the user must select the app as the default home launcher and may not understand why (another problem I know, but still) Implement a Service with a SYSTEM_OVERLAY view that is launched every time the device is locked, being effectively on top of everything, unfortunately (or fortunately security wise) the home button presses are still being sent to the app below and the default home launcher is still called. Implement an activity parallel to the one that implements the lock screen, that contains the HOME Intent that is activated/deactivated programatically on the my app options, effectively changing the main app to a homelauncher on demand, when this activity is called it launches the lockscreen activity. Is there any other way to do this? Thanks in advance.

@TITLE:How to show the same part of game on every aspect ratio on Android devices with Unity?
@CONTENT:I'm coming from Libgdx engine to Unity and I'm a beginner programmer. I try to make a game in Unity for Android and iOS devices, but I have a problem with the aspect ratio/resolution scaling. In Libgdx if you have develop something you give a "default" resolution, and everything will be scaled to the device's screen, not matter if it has bigger or smaller resolution, and nothing will be cut off from the screen. On the other side, in Unity if I make a game it will crop the screen to the chosen aspect ratio, which is not the best if you want the same experience across all the devices available. I have searched on the internet for a long time, but I haven't find anything that would work for me. Bottom line: I would like to know if there's some code for Unity (C#) which will make my game looks like the same across all devices with different aspect ratios? I'm developing with Unity 2D. If anybody could code it and would like to share it, I would be very happy, because it is very bad if it doesn't look like same on all devices. I don't have the problem with onGUI yet, as I haven't did any menu or something for it, just the game, but it is not good that the background is not the same on devices, and that the character is not on the same portion of the screen.

@TITLE:Operator precedence or Maximal Munch Rule comes first for Unary Operators
@CONTENT:Here I am having the following piece of code: int a,b,x;
a=b=1;
x=a+++b;
 Now the value of x will be 2 as a is first being post incremented and then it is being added to b. Following is the compiled byte code :  0  iconst_1
 1  dup
 2  istore_2 [b]
 3  istore_1 [a]
 4  iload_1 [a]
 5  iinc 1 1 [a]
 8  iload_2 [b]
 9  iadd
10  istore_3 [x]
 So the expression will be equivalent to x = (a++) + b. Now the other expression x=a++++b, won't compile because of the maximal munch rule. It will become x = (a++) ++ b and hence compilation error. Is the above behavior of x=a+++b because of the precedence of the operator ++ or because of maximal munch rule?

@TITLE:What is the difference between JavaScript object and primitive types?
@CONTENT:Stoyan Stefanov in his excellent book 'Object-Oriented JavaScript' says: Any value that doesn't belong to one of the five primitive types listed above is an object. With five primitive types he means Number, String, Boolean, Undefined and Null. However in Google Chrome console it seems like number is not primitive type at all (compared to C primitive types like int). It looks like the primitive number has methods: var a = 2.2;
console.log(a.toFixed()); // logs "2"
 Thus I assumed that I can work with number as with an object, so I tried to assign a property to it: var a = 2;
a.foo = 'bar';
console.log(a.foo); // logs undefined
 I don't understand that behavior. If number has a method, it should behave like object, shouldn't it? It even has a prototype: Number.prototype.foo = 'bar';
var a = 2;
console.log(a.foo); // logs 'bar'
 So what is the magic behind this? How JavaScript treats objects versus primitive types? I would rather not use the word primitive and substitute it with simple objects. As I see it those are objects which can't be extended with new properties, however they are constructed through their constructor and also have prototype which can be extended like with normal objects.
@CODE:Number String Boolean Undefined Null C int var a = 2.2;
console.log(a.toFixed()); // logs "2" var a = 2;
a.foo = 'bar';
console.log(a.foo); // logs undefined Number.prototype.foo = 'bar';
var a = 2;
console.log(a.foo); // logs 'bar'

@TITLE:How to make non-interactive graphical overlay on top of another program in c#?
@CONTENT:To give some background, I am developing a piece of software that assists players with the game Star Wars: The old republic. The game has very limited user interface capabilities, so i am developing an external application that will parse the log in real time, and output visual clues to help the user maximize their in-game performance. For example, if a character gets a certain "buff" the combat-log will show it, and i want to place a visual clue on the screen (so the user doesn't need to pay attention to small icons at the perimeter of the screen). Before i begin, i wanted to create a few "proof of concept" scripts for myself to figure out how i am going to hand the major parts. The one i am stuck on is where i have my question: I need to be able to show a graphic, likely a PNG file with transparency, on the screen over the game. The user needs to be able to click through that image so they can continue to interact with the game. I am a bit lost on how to go about that. The requirements would be: Show an image (or multiple images, for that matter) Have that image stick over-top the other application, even without application "focus" Have that image be non-interactive (or click-through-able). I am developing the application in C# Any guidance on where to begin would be very much appreciated!

@TITLE:Prevent multiple select element from automatically sorting the value assigned to it basis the order of the indexes in the options
@CONTENT:I am using the select2 plugin to convert a multiple select html element to a more presentable format. Also I don't think my question is very much dependent on the plugin. What the plugin does internally is - this.select.val(val);
 where this.select points to the hidden multiple select element. On feeding the function above a val of say - 2,4,0 , the value stored as confirmed when I do an alert(this.select.val()) is 0,2,4 , i.e. with automatic unwanted sorting according to the order of the options in the select element.. :/ DEMO - http://jsfiddle.net/rohanxx/DYpU8/ (thanks to Mark) Is there a way to preserve the sort order after feeding in the value to my select element? Thanks.

@LINK:/questions/21854012/is-it-possible-to-work-with-ftps-under-php-using-stream-context
@TITLE:Is it possible to work with FTPS under PHP using stream context?
@CONTENT:I learned that using ftps (?ftp_ssl_connect()?) under PHP for Windows is tough. You are asked to enter a long journey of building your own binaries to include Open SSL... I found advice on phpseclib as a replacement (but getting openssl.cnf right to support peer validation sounds pretty hard to me, too...). Then I hit this article and its pleasingly simple example including working peer validation (to avoid Man-in-the-middle-Attacks) drew my attention to streams: $uri = 'https://www.bankofamerica.com/';
$ctx = stream_context_create(['ssl' => [
    'verify_peer' => true, // important
    'cafile' => '/hard/path/to/cacert.pem',
    'CN_match' => 'www.bankofamerica.com'
]]);
$html = file_get_contents($uri, FALSE, $ctx); // we are good
 However, is this useful for ftp connections? Can I also use peer-validated stream contexts to open ftps streams? The php manual hints, ssl context options also apply to sftp, but lacks further guidance. So I am wildly guessing: $ctx = stream_context_create(['ftps' => [
    'verify_peer' => true,
    'cafile' => 'd:/sandbox/mycerts.pem',
    'CN_match' => 'ftp-12345678.mywebhoster.com'
]]);
 Right? Wrong? User+Password as options now? And then what? User/Password now? Or later? I am clueless... How do I scan the remote ftp directory contents to start with? How to I upload or download a file from an ftp server? Is any of that even possible? (A few lines of code would be very helpful....) Or are streams only good for singular file access? Update: Curl might do what I want (including peer validation and directory lsiting) as shown in this SO answer. Will examine later this week...
@CODE:$uri = 'https://www.bankofamerica.com/';
$ctx = stream_context_create(['ssl' => [
    'verify_peer' => true, // important
    'cafile' => '/hard/path/to/cacert.pem',
    'CN_match' => 'www.bankofamerica.com'
]]);
$html = file_get_contents($uri, FALSE, $ctx); // we are good $ctx = stream_context_create(['ftps' => [
    'verify_peer' => true,
    'cafile' => 'd:/sandbox/mycerts.pem',
    'CN_match' => 'ftp-12345678.mywebhoster.com'

 It seems that the problem is that node uses unix command names like dir, which do not exist on Windows. Some blog posts mention using Cygwin, but mostly for building node.js, not for calling it.

@CONTENT:I am attempting to write a function that takes a variety of strings or numbers (that work with std::to_string and concatenate them. I've got it working with just strings, but I am having trouble with specializing depending on input as string or number. My code is called like this: stringer("hello", "world", 2, 15, 0.2014, "goodbye", "world") And here is what I've got: inline std::string stringer(const std::string &string)
{
    return string;
}

template <typename T, typename... Args>
inline std::string stringer(const std::string &string, T &&val, Args &&...args)

template <typename... Args>
inline std::string stringer(const std::string &string, Args &&...args)
{
    return stringer(string, std::forward<Args>(args)...);

 Currently it is breaking on any more than one string added unless the following are all numbers (due to the to_string). How can I specialize based on string or number to make the above work? Thanks.

@LINK:/questions/21805564/casting-tresult-in-tasktresult-to-system-object
@TITLE:Casting TResult in Task<TResult> to System.Object
@CONTENT:I am loading an assembly and calling a static method that will create a new object of type MyClass1 (this type is specified at runtime) through reflection using MethodInfo.Invoke(). This works fine when the method is a normal sync method. However, the method being called is an async method which returns Task<MyClass1>, which will be used to retrieve the result using task.Result. Ideally I should be using MyClass1 as TResult in the task, but the type is determined only at runtime so I can't do that. I am looking for a way to get the task and the result. I am trying to cast the TResult to System.Object and get the class as a generic Object. The following is the code I am using for this purpose. public static void LoadAssembly()
{
    // Calling static async method directly works fine
    Task<MyClass1> task1 = MyClass1.MakeMyClass1();
    MyClass1 myClass1 = task1.Result;

    // Calling static async method through reflection through exception.
    Assembly assembly = Assembly.LoadFrom(dllName);
    Type type = assembly.GetType("AsyncDll.MyClass1");
    var types = assembly.GetTypes(); 
    MethodInfo[] methodInfos = types[0].GetMethods(BindingFlags.Public | BindingFlags.Static);
    Type myClassType = types[0];
    MethodInfo mi = myClassType.GetMethod("MakeMyClass1");
    Object obj = Activator.CreateInstance(mi.ReflectedType);
    Task<Object> task = (Task<Object>)mi.Invoke(obj, null); // Exception occurs here.
    Object result = task.Result;
}
 Following is the method (test code) being called through reflection. This public class MyClass1
{
    public static async Task<MyClass1> MakeMyClass1()
    {
        MyClass1 newObject = null;
        await Task.Run(() =>
        {
            newObject = new MyClass1();
        });
        return newObject;
    }
    ...

 Unfortunately, the casting of TResult is causing System.InvalidCastException. An unhandled exception of type 'System.InvalidCastException' occurred in Test.exe

@TITLE:HG Convert on SVN gives does not look like a Subversion Repository
@CONTENT:I just installed TortoiseHG v2.11 with Mercurial-2.9 I am attempting to convert my local Subversion repositories created with TortoiseSVN 1.8. 4, Subversion 1.8.5 To be sure that my old Subversion repositories don't have any weird quirks I created a new SVN repo called test_repo with the default folder structure, performed a Checkout to test_repowc, then added some text files to the trunk, then modified and committed the files a few times to provide some history. I then opened cmd.exe, navigated to the folder and tried hg convert test_repo
 and got the following: assuming destination test_repo-hg
initializing destination test_repo-hg repository
test_repo does not look like a CVS checkout
test_repo does not look like a Git repository
file:///C:/Users/xxxxxx/Documents/Subversion/test_repo does not look like a Subversion repository
test_repo is not a local Mercurial repository
test_repo does not look like a darcs repository
test_repo does not look like a monotone repository
test_repo does not look like a GNU Arch repository
test_repo does not look like a Bazaar repository
cannot find required "p4" tool
abort: test_repo: missing or unsupported repository
 As you can see, Mercurial did the file:/// protocol for me, but was unable to recognize the subversion repository. I've tried doing the file:/// protocol myself, specifying the repository type with the -s flag, running Mongoose in the folder and accessing the repository as a URL, and none of it seems to work. I've also tried converting from the working copy instead of from the repository, but that doesn't work either. I'm wondering if it has to do with the new SVN file structure that SVN 1.7 or 1.8 introduced (which some SVN clients were incompatible with for a while)? Has anyone else had luck with this using current versions of TortoiseSVN and TortoiseHG? I was intending on this being a super quick thing to transition, getting all excited about DVCS and Mercurial, and I've already hit a wall. I read lots of people saying it was dead simple, but either I've got a bizarre edge case or it's not as easy as the rumors sound. I've read about other tools like HGSubversion where I could clone my SVN as an HG repo, but since these are solo repositories I'd rather just convert the SVN, make sure everything works, then delete and uninstall SVN. I'd rather my HG repository not still be "connected" to the SVN (HGSubversion allows "push" from the cloned HG repo to the parent SVN repo right?). Other tools have mixed reviews so I was hoping to get the convert extension working. Thanks in advance - looking forward to Mercurial! EDIT: Documenting a solution for Windows: Open a Command Prompt Navigate to your SVN repository (not a working copy) run svnserve -r .\ -d Open another Command Prompt Navigate to where you want your mercurial repo Optional: Run where hg ... if TortoiseHg version isn't first, edit the path to make it first - this version includes the SVN python bindings which are necessary to use svn:// protocol. Restart your cmd prompt after editing the path. run hg convert -s svn svn://localhost .\hg_repo_name I did my computername.full.domain.name instead of localhost, but localhost should work too. svn:// slash direction is like http:// and file:/// not like C:\ If your SVN repo code doesn't have a trunk or you didn't use the trunk folder (I didn't for my first repos because I didn't know what I was doing), you need this, which tells mercurial to use the root directory as the trunk: hg --config config.svn.trunk= convert -s svn svn:\\localhost .\hg_repo_name I just had an SVN repo where I imported a folder of code into the root, but not into the trunk... I tried using the code above to set the trunk equal to the code folder name but it wouldn't work... however, when I appended the folder name to the svn url it worked: `hg convert svn://%computername%.domain.com/code_folder .\hg_repo_name Good luck!

@TITLE:Is it safe to change this c-cast to a reinterpret_cast?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to remove a c-style cast from some code I'm working on, and I have concerns about the only alternative. The original code was: WPARAM param = (WPARAM)(GetDlgItem(IDC_WORKFLOW).m_hWnd);
this->PostMessage(WM_NEXTDLGCTL, param, TRUE);
 If I use a static cast: WPARAM param = static_cast<WPARAM>(GetDlgItem(IDC_WORKFLOW).m_hWnd);
this->PostMessage(WM_NEXTDLGCTL, param, TRUE);
 I get the error, 'static_cast' : cannot convert from 'HWND' to 'WPARAM', because there's no valid conversion between the underlying types. This leaves me with "the devil's option": WPARAM param = reinterpret_cast<WPARAM>(GetDlgItem(IDC_WORKFLOW).m_hWnd);
this->PostMessage(WM_NEXTDLGCTL, param, TRUE);
 As I understand it, if a static_cast is impossible, and this isn't related to constness, the C-cast must be doing a reinterpret_cast anyway, which means that the underlying code must be casting back, which means this is safe (point 3 in remarks). But I'd like to confirm this, before just changing the code. Is this cast safe in this specific instance, and how do I confirm this? If not, what is the alternative?
@CODE:WPARAM param = (WPARAM)(GetDlgItem(IDC_WORKFLOW).m_hWnd);

@TITLE:How can I format time durations exactly using Moment.js?
@CONTENT:I would like to do the following, given two dates in UTC formatting: var start = "2014-01-13T06:00:00.0000000Z";
var end = "2014-01-13T14:16:04.0000000Z";
 I would like to get the exact time span that passes between these two times, such as 8h 16m
 I have tried using the following: var duration = moment(moment(end) - moment(start)).format('hh[h] mm[m]');
 But this does not work with days. Moreover, it does not work with days, since they are always >=1 even if <24 hours pass. I have also tried twix.js to get the length, but its formatting doesn't support creating the format specified above, or I could not find the way to do so in its documentation. Basically I am looking for an exact version of twix.humanizeLength(). Moment.js's a.diff(b) provides only total durations, it can give me the length of the time span in minutes, hours or days, but not calculated using remainders. My current solution is to use diff to create the ranges and then use modulo to calculate remainders, but this is not very elegant: var days = moment(end).diff(start, 'days');

@LINK:/questions/21647271/invariance-covariance-and-contravariance-in-java
@TITLE:Invariance, covariance and contravariance in Java
@CONTENT:Java lesson on generics are leading me to variance concept. This causes me some headaches as I cannot find a very simple demonstration of what it is. I have read several similar questions on stackoverflow, but I found them too difficult to understand for a Java learner. Actually the problem is that the explanation of generics requires variance to be understood, and the concept of variance is demonstrated relying heavily on generics understanding. I had some hope reading this, but in the end I shared C. R.'s feeling: The title reminds me of the days learning general relativity. V C.R. Dec 22 '13 at 7:34 Four theory questions are very confusing to me, and I cannot find good and simple explanations. Here they are, with my current partial understanding (I fear experts will have a great fun reading this). Your help to correct and clarify is welcome (remember this is for beginners, not for experts). Is there something wrong with this understanding? What is invariance / covariance / contravariance related to in the context of programing? My best guess is that: This is something encountered in object-oriented programing. This has to do when looking at method arguments and result type in the class and an ancestor. This is used in the context of method overriding and overloading. This is used to establish a connection between the type of a method argument, or the method return type, and the inheritance of the classes themselves, e.g. if class D is a descendant of class A, what can we say about the types of arguments and the method method return type? How variance relates to Java methods? My best guess is that, given two classes A and D, with A being an ancestor of D, and a overhiden/overloaded method f(arg): If the relation between the argument type in the two methods IS THE SAME than the relation between the two classes, the argument type in the method is said COVARIANT with the class type, said otherwise: the inheritance between arg types in A and D is covariant with the inheritance of classes A and D. If the relation between the arguments REVERSES the relation between classes, the arg type is said CONTRAVARIANT to the class type, said otherwise: the inheritance between arg types in A and D is contravariant with the inheritance of classes A and D.. Why is variance understanding so important for Java programmers? My guess is that: Java language creators have implemented rules for variance in the language, and this has implications on what a programmer can do. A rule states that the return type of an overriding/overloading method must be contravariant to the inheritance. Another rule states that the type of an argument of an overriding/overloading must be is covariant to the inheritance. The Java compiler checks the variance rules are valid, and provides errors or warnings accordingly. Deciphering the messages is easier with variance knowledge. What is the difference between overrhiding and overloading? Best guess: A method overrides another method when argument and return types are both invariant. All other cases are understood by the compiler as overloading.

@TITLE:RDBMS impact on Golang [closed]
@CONTENT:I'm not going to make a big long rattle on this question about what I've tested and number crunching. I'm more interested in actual up-to-date practice performances. I've read tons of articles already and some of them are pretty skeptical or either very pro to one library. I'm currently testing a bit with gorp, yet I have no clue how to compare the performances of such a library towards others. I know gorp is an extra layer that tries to add ORM to the basic SQL driver/implementation, but seeing Go's extremely clear code and being it very close to the bone on everything it does. It's not like with PHP/Python/JAVA what I'm used too, where you have to navigate through endless layers of complexity to actually see what a package does in its essence. So my question is if anyone can share (benchmarks are always welcome :) ) their experience and knowledge on this subject. I don't think a NoSQL-type solution is an option for my projects. All my projects always strongly depend on business logic and intertwined relationships. I also wonder if Postgres will be a win over MySQL. With Django (Python) I noticed significant performance gain using Postgres, but I never found prove on that matter if it was due to the Postgres core implementation or just Django's way of using the wrapper. Small update After rereading the question I noticed I kind of missed the actual goal of it. I'm actually looking for the most suitable SQL solution that will least slow down Golang itself. I know the SQL runs concurrent, but also concerning heavy traffic when running it as a web service. I won't be really bothered to drop the ORM part again if that will get me major gain on performance.

@TITLE:Kivy ObjectProperty to update label text
@CONTENT:I am working on creating a kivy user interface to display the values generated by a data model I've written as a standard python object. In essence, I would like the user to be able to press a button, which would change the underlying data model and the results of this change would be automatically updated and displayed. It is my understanding that this can be implemented using kivy properties (in this case, ObjectProperty). Here is some example code: import kivy
kivy.require('1.7.0')

from kivy.app import App
from kivy.uix.gridlayout import GridLayout
from kivy.properties import ObjectProperty
from kivy.lang import Builder

        on_press: root.button_press()
    Button:
        text: "Make data_model.b shorter"
        on_press: root.button_press2()
""")


class DataModel(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.a = 'This is a'
        self.b ='This is b'

    @property
    def c(self):
        return self.a + ' and ' + self.b

class RootWidget(GridLayout):
    data_model = ObjectProperty(DataModel())

    def button_press(self, *args):
        self.data_model.a = 'This is a and it is really long now'
        print self.data_model.c

        print self.data_model.c

class TestApp(App):
    def build(self):
        return RootWidget()

app = TestApp()
app.run()
 The desired result is for when user presses either button, the labels would automatically update to show the new properties. As can be seen by the print statements, the data_model is getting updated correctly. However, none of the labels are updating. Can someone clarify how to do this?

Here is what I would like to do: I have a URL like http://some-url.com/php/session_check.php?sid=session_id. When the session_id starts with a 0, like http://some-url.com/php/session_check.php?sid=00221245 a string with a username is returned (e.g. 'testuser'). When the session_id starts with any other number but 0, like http://some-url.com/php/session_check.php?sid=10221245 a 0 is returned.

 This works in Firefox and Chrome, but not quite in Internet Explorer 11. All browsers execute the ReloadData method every second, but IE11 doesn't actually fetch the process data from the server. Firefox and Chrome do fetch the data every second. I can see this also in the output from my server, which logs every request. All three browsers execute the code in result.success, but IE11 keeps reusing the old data it got the first time, where FireFox and Chrome use the newly fetched data. I've checked the web console in IE11 for warnings or errors, but there are none. Edit: As the chosen answer suggested it was a caching problem. I have made the server add a 'cache-control' header to the response with the value 'no-cache'. This has solved the problem.

@TITLE:Are assignments to non-volatile member variables in one thread guaranteed to be seen in another thread?
@CONTENT:Consider the Java example below. Notice that neither of the class member variables are declared to be volatile. If I am understanding the memory model and "happens before" rules correctly, a Java implementation could optimize the run() method so that it runs forever, even if another thread calls the stopNow() method. This can happen because there is nothing in the run() method that forces the thread to read the value of stop more than once. Is that correct? If not, why not? class Example implements Runnable {
    boolean stop = false;
    int value = 0;

    public void stopNow() {
       stop = true;
    }

    public int getValue() {
        return value;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        // Loop until stop is set to true.
        while (!stop) {
            ++value;
        }

@LINK:/questions/21537940/json-net-default-deserialization-behavior-for-a-single-property-in-customcreat
@TITLE:Json.NET - Default deserialization behavior for a single property in CustomCreationConverter
@CONTENT:In the following scenario, how do I get CrazyItemConverter to carry on as usual when it encounters a JSON property that exists in the type I'm deserializing to? I have some JSON that looks like this: {
    "Item":{
        "Name":"Apple",
        "Id":null,
        "Size":5,
        "Quality":2
    }
}
 The JSON gets deserialized into a class that looks a whole lot like this: [JsonConverter(typeof(CrazyItemConverter))]
public class Item
{
    [JsonConverter(typeof(CrazyStringConverter))]
    public string Name { get; set; }

    public Guid? Id { get; set; }

    [JsonIgnore]
    public Dictionary<string, object> CustomFields
    {
        get
        {
            if (_customFields == null)
                _customFields = new Dictionary<string, object>();
            return _customFields;
        }
    }

    ...
}
 CrazyItemConverter populates the values of the known properties and puts the unknown properties in CustomFields. The ReadJson in it looks like this: public override object ReadJson(JsonReader reader, Type objectType, object existingValue, JsonSerializer serializer)
{
    var outputObject = Create(objectType);
    var objProps = objectType.GetProperties().Select(p => p.Name).ToArray();

    while (reader.Read())
    {
        if (reader.TokenType == JsonToken.PropertyName)
        {
            string propertyName = reader.Value.ToString();
            if (reader.Read())
            {
                if (objProps.Contains(propertyName))
                {
                    // No idea :(
                    // serializer.Populate(reader, outputObject);
                }
                else
                {
                    outputObject.AddProperty(propertyName, reader.Value);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return outputObject;
}
 During deserialization, when CrazyItemConverter encounters a known property, I want it to act as it normally would. Meaning, respecting the [JsonConverter(typeof(CrazyStringConverter))] for Name. I was using the code below to set the known properties but, it throws exceptions on nullables and doesn't respect my other JsonConverters. PropertyInfo pi = outputObject.GetType().GetProperty(readerValue, BindingFlags.IgnoreCase | BindingFlags.Public | BindingFlags.Instance);
var convertedValue = Convert.ChangeType(reader.Value, pi.PropertyType);
pi.SetValue(outputObject, convertedValue, null);
 Any ideas? UPDATE: I've learned that serializer.Populate(reader, outputObject); is how to deserialize the whole thing but it doesn't seem to work if you want default functionality on a property-by-property basis.
@CODE:CrazyItemConverter {
    "Item":{
        "Name":"Apple",
        "Id":null,
        "Size":5,
        "Quality":2
    }
} [JsonConverter(typeof(CrazyItemConverter))]

    [JsonConverter(typeof(CrazyStringConverter))]
    public string Name { get; set; }

    public Guid? Id { get; set; }

        {
            if (_customFields == null)
                _customFields = new Dictionary<string, object>();
            return _customFields;
        }
    }

    ...

    var outputObject = Create(objectType);

        {
            string propertyName = reader.Value.ToString();

//[self.screensCollectionView setPagingEnabled:YES];
[self.screensCollectionView setCollectionViewLayout:flowLayout];
 } For cellForRowAtIndexPath I download the image like this: -(UICollectionViewCell *)collectionView:(UICollectionView *)collectionView cellForItemAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath{

FGAppScreensCollectionViewItemCell *cell = [collectionView dequeueReusableCellWithReuseIdentifier:cellIdentifier forIndexPath:indexPath];

    //STOP THE SPINNER
    for (UIView* view in [cell.contentView subviews]) {

return cell;
 } However there are both portrait and landscape images displayed in the collection view. Portrait Images are displaying just fine but landscape images are appearing to small in the collectionview.

 I've been searching most of the day and have found different solutions ranging from changing Java version to using BouncyCastle. However, I'm using the Scribe library so I don't think I can implement BouncyCastle without forking and changing the base of scribe, which kind of defeats it's purpose.

For example, the following is the list of headers I get when I ping my server for the font: curl -I -s "https://mysite.com/wp-content/themes/my-theme/includes/fonts/ProximaNova-Reg-webfont.ttf"
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

 Everything looks good with this response; however, when I ping Cloudfront for the same resource, I get: curl -I -s "https://ds6dj5kp03o39.cloudfront.net/wp-content/themes/my-theme/includes/fonts/ProximaNova-Reg-webfont.ttf"

 It seems that all of the origin headers are completely ignored. My question is, how do I get Cloudfront to accept my asset headers, especially the critical "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" header? Thanks for the help!

select * from #t where freq_id>2
 (Clearly there is no need to use #t in this case: I'm just giving the most simple example.) This work fine in SSMS but when executed via Excel I get the error message "We couldn't refresh the connection 'audbbicube'. The table 'ion Query1' may not exist." In some other SO posts people suggested adding set nocount on, but that made no difference in this case.

@TITLE:How to clear HTML data?
@CONTENT:We can clear the CSS style sheet cache by using the query selector like this: <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="stylesheet.css?v=1.0" /> Whenever we change the style sheet and need the browsers to be cleared about our CSS style sheet, we could change the version number like 1.1, 1.2, etc. Is there anything something like this for clearing HTML data? I was having the HTML markup like this: <img src="picturename.jpg" /><!--picture of a **man**--->
 Later I need to change the picture but the same file name: <img src="picturename.jpg" /><!--picture of a **woman**--->
 I deleted the picture of man and uploaded picture of woman. But when I viewed in the browser it is showing the cached picture that is picture of a man even after very clean refresh (Ctrl+F5) and also clearing with the settings that the browsers have. Update I came to know every time clearing the cache is not good idea so I wanted to implement this by jquery with the following concept: First set the image src from picturename.jpg to picturename.jpg?v=1 Store the number in local storage or in cookie. But I'm confusing to use cookie as if the user deletes the cookies then the stored variable would also be deleted thus storing it in local storage would be better idea. Retrieve the local storage variable number and check if the global variable number is exceeded then only change the picture src number something like this: var cnum = 1; // author will change this number when needed
$(document).ready(function(){
var ccnum; // store in local storage then increase the number if cnum is greater than ccnum
//now change the src as of image
 I need to change the src of all of my gallery images $('#mygallery img') and actually I've hundreds of images which are to be changed after some time but needed the same file name. How could I do?
@CODE:<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="stylesheet.css?v=1.0" /> <img src="picturename.jpg" /><!--picture of a **man**---> <img src="picturename.jpg" /><!--picture of a **woman**---> picturename.jpg picturename.jpg?v=1 var cnum = 1; // author will change this number when needed
$(document).ready(function(){
var ccnum; // store in local storage then increase the number if cnum is greater than ccnum

@LINK:/questions/21399717/viewwithtag-returns-nil-when-initializing-a-uicollectionviewcell
@TITLE:viewWithTag returns nil when initializing a UICollectionViewCell
@CONTENT:Just getting started with UICollectionView. I've used IB to create a simple UICollectionView in a UIViewController. It scrolls horizontally with paging. I placed a simple UICollectionViewCell inside the UICollectionView. I set the reuse identifier for the cell. I placed a UILabel with a tag of 100 inside the UICollectionViewCell. In viewDidLoad, I call: [_collectionView registerClass:[UICollectionViewCell class] forCellWithReuseIdentifier:@"Thing"];
 Later I attempt to initialize the cell like so: - (UICollectionViewCell *)collectionView:(UICollectionView *)collectionView cellForItemAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath
{
    UICollectionViewCell *cell = [collectionView dequeueReusableCellWithReuseIdentifier:@"Thing" forIndexPath:indexPath];
    cell.backgroundColor = [UIColor greenColor];

    UILabel *nameLabel = (UILabel *)[cell viewWithTag:100];
    nameLabel.text = @"Bogus";

    return cell;
}
 When I run the app, the view loads correctly; I can scroll horizontally through the 2 cells. I see the ugly green color identifying each cell. However, the viewWithTag method returns nil and therefore the nameLabel text is not set. Why? Note that I also tried defining a custom subclass of UICollectionViewCell and calling registerClass with it. In IB, I change the cell class to the custom subclass and I bind the UILabel to the UILabel outlet in the subclass. But this also does not work. (I would prefer to avoid the custom subclass approach anyway because it does not seem necessary to define classes just to hold IBOutlets.) I'm thinking that I'm missing something obvious here. Similar problem described here: Trouble accessing Image from instance of UICollectionViewCell
@CODE:UICollectionView UICollectionView UIViewController UICollectionViewCell UICollectionView UILabel UICollectionViewCell viewDidLoad [_collectionView registerClass:[UICollectionViewCell class] forCellWithReuseIdentifier:@"Thing"]; - (UICollectionViewCell *)collectionView:(UICollectionView *)collectionView cellForItemAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath

    cell.backgroundColor = [UIColor greenColor];

    UILabel *nameLabel = (UILabel *)[cell viewWithTag:100];
    nameLabel.text = @"Bogus";

@TITLE:Inject EJB in Jersey filter
@CONTENT:I am currently developing an application with Jersey JAX-RS as backend and AngularJS as frontend ; I need a sort of authentication, and so with every request I send a token that should be verify by the backend. For this, I decided to create a Jersey filter that will look for that token, and then call my AuthenticateService to check if the user can be authenticated. Authorization is then managed by @RolesAllowed annotation. Here is my problem : I can't inject an EJB inside a Jersey filter, strangly because it works great with resources.. But with a filter, the service always stays null Any idea how to trick it ? Thanks Filter code : @Provider

@TITLE:Generating a consistent dynamic color palette in ggplot within a loop?
@CONTENT:I have a data set called d1 similar to: location, depth.from, depth.to, val, type 
 I have a loop that creates a fairly complex plot for each unique location (it's glueing together many things using grid.arrange, which is why I can't use facet_wrap on the location to keep the legend/color consistent of one part of the plot). Say there are 4 categories for "type", the problem when one location has a different number of "types" than the other, the colors assigned are not consistent between each plot. I can manually force them to be the same, but I am trying to generalize this function. Google has failed me. For the following block, d1 is a subset of the data based on the location type, e.g. d1 <- subset(myData, location == location.list[i])
 Looking at the plot, which is within the loop: p1 <- ggplot(data = d1, aes (y=val, x=depth.from))+
layer(geom = "point", size = 2) + 
geom_rect(data=d1, aes(xmin=Depth.to, xmax=Depth.from, ymin=0, ymax=100, fill = type), linetype =0, alpha=0.3)+
scale_fill_brewer(palette="Set1")
 the geom_rect command is going through the data and based on the depth from and depth to, creating a overlay based on fill type. I can use scale_fill_manual("Lith", c("Val1" = "DodgerBlue4"...) etc to manually set it, but that defeats the purposes. If I have:types like where I want something like: Bird_one = blue
Bird_two = red
Bird_three = green
 I want bird_three to be green, even if bird_two doesn't exist, without having to explicitly set it using scale_fill_manual. Is there a way to set a global list of names for the color palette? Perhaps by providing the array from something like: myData <- read.csv("mydata.csv" 
typeList <- unique(myData$type)
@CODE:location, depth.from, depth.to, val, type grid.arrange facet_wrap d1 <- subset(myData, location == location.list[i]) p1 <- ggplot(data = d1, aes (y=val, x=depth.from))+

}
 Taking into consideration the Erasure property of Scala, can reflection be somehow used to get the job done? Is it even possible?
@CODE:Double Boolean LocalDate ob def X[T](ob: Observable[T]): Observable[T] = {
    //code  
    T match {
    case Double => DoSomething1(ob:Observable[Double]):Observable[Double]
    case Boolean => DoSomething2(ob:Observable[Boolean]):Observable[Boolean]
    case LocalDate => DoSomething3(ob:Observable[LocalDate]):Observable[LocalDate]
    }
} t: T

@TITLE:Using NHibernate.AspNet.Identity
@CONTENT:I am attempting to use Asp.net identity and NHibernate. I have created a new blank Asp.net MVC site using .NET framework 4.5.1 and I have installed and followed the instructions for using nuget package NHibernate.AspNet.Identity as described here: https://github.com/milesibastos/NHibernate.AspNet.Identity which involves making the following changes to the AccountController class default constructor: var mapper = new ModelMapper();
mapper.AddMapping<IdentityUserMap>();
mapper.AddMapping<IdentityRoleMap>();
mapper.AddMapping<IdentityUserClaimMap>();
mapper.AddMapping<IdentityUserLoginMap>();

var mapping = mapper.CompileMappingForAllExplicitlyAddedEntities();
var configuration = new Configuration();
configuration.Configure(System.Web.HttpContext.Current.Server.MapPath(@"~\Models\hibernate.cfg.xml"));
configuration.AddDeserializedMapping(mapping, null);

var schema = new SchemaExport(configuration);
schema.Create(true, true);

var factory = configuration.BuildSessionFactory();
var session = factory.OpenSession();

UserManager = new UserManager<ApplicationUser>(
                new UserStore<ApplicationUser>(session));
 I am getting the following exception: No persister for: IdentityTest.Models.ApplicationUser The ApplicationUser class doesn't have any additional properties to IdentityUser (which works fine for a Entity Framework implementation of Asp.net Identity). Can anyone offer suggestions as to how I can get Asp.net identity to work with this NuGet package?
@CODE:var mapper = new ModelMapper();
mapper.AddMapping<IdentityUserMap>();
mapper.AddMapping<IdentityRoleMap>();

@TITLE:How to programmatically create a Google Docs spreadsheet WITH CONTENT?
@CONTENT:I have found multiple StackOverflow questions dealing with how to create or edit Google Doc spreadsheets using the Google Spreadsheets API, or older API's. However, this Spreadsheets API seems to be part of the "gdata" library, which to my understanding is deprecated. Newer StackOverflow answers show how to create an empty spreadsheet using the Drive API, which seems more current. However, from looking at the documentation and examples for that API, it seems to only let you create new EMPTY files with the spreadsheet MIME type. I have not found any functionality for creating a spreadsheet with actual content (i.e. rows, columns, worksheets, etc). What is the current process for creating a new Google Doc spreadsheet AND populating it with content? Does the Drive API have functionality that I'm not understanding? Is the "gdata" library (or at least its Spreadsheets API portion) not completely deprecated after all? Is there some third approach that I've missed altogether? I'm working with Java code, to the extent that matters, although I'm sure that any Python API would have a Java equivalent.

@LINK:/questions/21202670/angularjs-directive-with-method-called-from-outside
@TITLE:AngularJS directive with method called from outside
@CONTENT:I created a directive with a method that should be called from other elements that are not part of the directive. However it looks like this method is not exposed. Some example jade code to clarify: //- a controller for the view itself
div(ng-controller="someController")

    //- this is part of the view itself, not within the directive
    div(ng-repeat="element in elements") 
        div(ng-click="methodFromDirective(element)") click element {{$index}} to trigger directive

    //- this is the directive
    div(some-directive)
 The someController isn't too important here I think. It has methods but NOT the methodFromDirective(element) one. The methodFromDirective(element) is a method that exists only in the directive. If I make a directive and put some logging on creation I can clearly see it's created. However the methodFromDirective(element) method isn't exposed so the calls aren't properly triggered. The methodFromDirective(element) itself will only work on elements from within the directive's template. some coffeescript to show the definition of the the directive (ignore indentation errors here): 'use strict'
define [], () ->

someDirective = () ->
    restrict: 'A'
    scope: {
        show: '='
    }

 Subsequently, I need to write two java class below: class1: public class Class1 extends ShellBolt implements IRichBolt {
    public Class1() {
        super("python", "class1.py");
    }

    @Override
    public void declareOutputFields(OutputFieldsDeclarer declarer) {
        declarer.declare(new Fields(arg1));
    }

    @Override
    public Map<String, Object> getComponentConfiguration() {
        return null;
    }
}
 class2: public class Class2 extends ShellBolt implements IRichBolt {

    public Class2() {
        super("python", "class2.py");
    }

    @Override
    public void declareOutputFields(OutputFieldsDeclarer declarer) {
        declarer.declare(new Fields(arg2));
    }

    @Override
    public Map<String, Object> getComponentConfiguration() {
        return null;
    }
}
 But if the JSON file is added a new object: {                                                                                                                                                                          
    "lang": "python",                                                                                                                                                      
    "file": "class3.py"   
    "args": ["arg3"]
}
 I need to write a new Class with the similar structure. So, is there a way to create class dynamically? I know maybe cglib might works, but I hava no idea how to use it in my case. Thanks.

@CONTENT:I would like to parse the webpage http://dcsd.nutrislice.com/menu/meadow-view/lunch/ to grab today's lunch menu. (I've built an Adafruit #IoT Thermal Printer and I'd like to automatically print the menu each day.) I initially approached this using BeautifulSoup but it turns out that most of the data is loaded in JavaScript and I'm not sure BeautifulSoup can handle it. If you view source you'll see the relevant data stored in bootstrapData['menuMonthWeeks']. import urllib2
from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup

url = "http://dcsd.nutrislice.com/menu/meadow-view/lunch/"
soup = BeautifulSoup(urllib2.urlopen(url).read())
 This is an easy way to get the source and review. My question is: what is the easiest way to extract this data so that I can do something with it? Literally, all I want is a string something like: Southwest Cheese Omelet, Potato Wedges, The Harvest Bar (THB), THB - Cheesy Pesto Bread, Ham Deli Sandwich, Red Pepper Sticks, Strawberries I've thought about using webkit to process the page and get the HTML (i.e. what a browser does) but that seems unnecessarily complex. I'd rather simply find something that can parse the bootstrapData['menuMonthWeeks'] data.

@TITLE:How to implement language level events similar to C# in Java
@CONTENT:C# has the notion of events on a language level, using the reserved keywords event and delegate to define publisher and subscriber methods. It has been asked if Java has native support for that but the answer is obviously no. There are several alternatives, which include using AWT/Swing styled events, building my own Observer pattern or using other means of publish/subscribe. It is possible but as one answer said, "just requires a bit more legwork." In general any implementation follows the same typed approach and could be automated. Java has different mechanisms for meta programming, e.g. AOP or AST transformations. How would one implement the C# events in Java to allow for the least "legwork" possible? Maybe Project Lombok?

@LINK:/questions/20942982/virtualenv-pip-trying-to-install-packages-globally
@TITLE:VirtualEnv/Pip trying to install packages globally
@CONTENT:Edit #2 Solution found; see below. I'm writing a small application in Flask using VirtualEnv. This is far from the first time I've done this, but the this time and past two times I've tried I've encountered the same problem. When I . flask/bin/activate and try to install a package -- pip install flup, for instance -- it keeps being installed globally, and not in the VirtualEnv. The weird thing is, it only happens after I deactivate, and it does so inconsistently at that. To wit, I seem to be able to install everything I need if I do it all at once, and even occasionally after I deactivate, but after a certain interval it just stops working and it starts trying to install into my global Python site-packages. (Naturally, it's also asking for permissions when it does this. Before I understood what was going on I tried to force it with sudo, thinking I'd brought it upon myself by accidentally sudo virtualenv flask-ing or something, but nope, it's going global for some other reason.) I'm not doing anything funny like using the --system-site-packages argument, and I hadn't changed anything in my VirtualEnv configuration before it started happening. The first time it happened, I chalked it up to a fluke. Now it's becoming seriously irritating because I'm not in the mood to uninstall everything and reinstall it each time, or pray that I'll think of everything I need in a bootstrap script. I'm not including any error messages because they aren't (or don't seem to be) particularly valuable; it's just requirement already satisfied yelling at me over and over. Edit #1 I'm winnowing down the problem a little bit, but I still don't have a solution. I created a new Flask project in the same directory, cd-ed into it, activated its VirtualEnv, etc., then ran which pip. It was the new VirtualEnv's pip -- the right pip. I deactivated, cd-ed to my original project, activated VirtualEnv, and ran which pip. It spit out the other project's -- the new one's -- pip. I rm -r-ed the new test project, went back to the original, ran which pip again, and it spit out /usr/local/bin/pip. Oh. OK. Edit #2: Solution I may not have figured out the exact cause, but I did find the solution. The bin/activate and bin/pip scripts themselves were altered somehow, possibly from accidentally running two VirtualEnvs at the same time(?). Maybe it's just coincidence that it happened three times in a row after never happening before. Dunno. I cat-ed activate and sure enough, on line 42, was VIRTUAL_ENV="/Users/chaseries/blueprint/python/flask2/flask"
 instead of VIRTUAL_ENV="/Users/chaseries/blueprint/python/flask/flask"
 I changed it, ran which pip again, and got the right result. Tried installing, got a stack trace that led me to bin/pip, and found its shebang was wrong. Changed it to the right path, and everything works perfectly.
@CODE:. flask/bin/activate pip install flup deactivate deactivate site-packages sudo sudo virtualenv flask --system-site-packages requirement already satisfied cd which pip cd which pip rm -r which pip /usr/local/bin/pip bin/activate bin/pip cat activate VIRTUAL_ENV="/Users/chaseries/blueprint/python/flask2/flask" VIRTUAL_ENV="/Users/chaseries/blueprint/python/flask/flask" which pip bin/pip

@CONTENT:I have a simple select element that I am trying to enforce a value being present to submit the form and I have tried both setting the required attribute as well as using ng-init to ensure there is a value selected and both fail. I am using ng-options to create a list of values from an array of Objects that have a ref property. Then I would like to use ng-init to set the shown value to the first Object.ref in the array. <select name="refmarker" class="input-block-level form-width-adjust" ng-model="model.refmarker" ng-options="rm.ref for rm in refmarkers" ng-disabled="editable" ng-init="model.refmarker='refmarkers[0].ref'" required></select>
 I have tried the following without any luck ng-init="model.refmarker='refmarkers[0]'"
ng-init="model.refmarker='refmarkers[0].ref'"
ng-init="model.refmarker='rm.ref'"
 Also the required attribute doesn't work ? Is the angular select element buggy or am I doing something wrong?

@TITLE:Propagate OperationContext into Async WCF Call
@CONTENT:With C#5 Async-Await in WCF, after an await if rest of the code continues on a different thread, we loose the Current Operation Context. (OperationContext.Current is null). I am working on a WCF Service which calls another external service. And there are a few Custom Binding Extensions used in the external service call which access the Operation Context. So I need the Context to be propagated during this call and it cant just work with copying the operation context into a local variable. My config looks like this <system.serviceModel>
<bindings>
  <customBinding>
<binding name="MyCustomBinding">
      <MyBindingExtention/>
      <security authenticationMode="UserNameOverTransport" />

 where "MyBindingExtention" accesses the operationcontext to get some information. public async Task<string> GetExternalData(int value)
{
    var oc = OperationContext.Current;

    //External Web service Call
    var response = await externalService.GetDataAsync();

    return response.text;
}
 Is there a good way to make the OperationContext propagate into the external Service Call and then again into the remaining code execution?

@CONTENT:I use Guice in my application quite a lot. Recently i start to learn akka actors and felt like refactoring my application with it. However upfront i am already wondering how all my guice will work with actors. I went on searching on google and it is kinda a bit messy. The most up to date docs that i have found on the subject are theses: http://letitcrash.com/post/55958814293/akka-dependency-injection http://eng.42go.com/tag/guice/ which do not advocate same thing. I must confess i still need to read a lot, i am at the beginning of learning akka. I Did few examples and red few things, but i don't want to go to deep into something to realize later that i will have many problems. So my question is as of today, what is the consensus on how to use Akka Actors with dependency injection. What kind of injection is possible ? Can we wire actors with object/other actors/.... Can anyway please outline in a concise way something that can help me to understand what is possible and what is the best practices ?

@LINK:/questions/20859934/merge-branch-strategy
@TITLE:Merge/Branch Strategy
@CONTENT:We are trying to implement the "Basic Dual Branch Plan" as described by the ALM Rangers in the latest Visual Studio TFS Branching and Merging Guide. From the guidance: The basic branch plan with a MAIN, DEV, and RELEASE branch enables concurrent development for your next release, a stable MAIN branch for testing and a RELEASE branch for any ship blocking bug fixes. Multiple development areas are supported by creating additional development branches from MAIN. These are peers to each other and children of MAIN. Additional releases are supported by creating release branches for each product release. Each release branch is a child of MAIN and a peer to each other (e.g. release 2.0 branch is peer to release 3.0 and both are children of MAIN). If supporting only a single release in production at a time, you may consider a single release branch, and make bug fixes directly on this branch. Once the RELEASE branch is created MAIN and the development branches can start taking changes approved for the next product release. We are undecided as to whether we want to use a single Release branch (and label releases), or create a new release branch per release. However, there are some questions that apply either way, that don't seem to be addressed by the guidance. My main question is: At what point in time should we create a RELEASE branch (or move tested code to the single RELEASE branch if that's the way we go)? My first reaction was to create it only when ready to do the release, but then you have the problem of creating a deadlock for development and testing of the next sprint's work; you cannot check these changes into MAIN until the RELEASE branch has been created (if you do, it's more difficult to separate out the changes you only want to go to RELEASE). Second idea is to create the RELEASE branch at the beginning of the sprint, and as changes pass testing in MAIN, merge them down to the current RELEASE branch. Once we reach the end of the sprint, we can lock that RELEASE branch down, and create a new one for the next sprint. This sounds like it would work, but I see no discussion of it anywhere, so I just wanted to see what people are doing.

@CONTENT:I am working on a dataviz with dc.js (http://edouard-legoupil.github.io/3W-Dashboard/) The main limitation is that when users find a specific fact while they explore the data, it is not easy to reproduce the exact filters they used in order to share their findings with other users (and initiate a discussion). A solution could be to have permalinks for each filter state. dc.js has already the "dc.redrawAll();" to reset all filter but is there any capacity to freeze a certain filters state and pass it to a #href? Ideally such href would be then shared through a share button or through the regular facebook/twitter sharing function. Any code snippet or examples would really help! Thanks in advance, Edouard

@TITLE:Generate a filtered, dynamic drop down list
@CONTENT:I need two dynamic drop down lists for data validation. One containing a unique list of continents to choose from, and then the second list which is a dynamically generated subset of countries based on the continent selected. The data is not in any particular order: 
     A          B
---+--------------------
1  | Continent Country
2  | Africa     Algeria
3  | Asia       China

8  | Europe     Italy
9  | Asia       Japan
10 | Europe     Poland
11 | Africa     South Africa
12 | Europe     Spain
 I have successfully created the first drop down list by using a hidden column to generate a unique list of continents and then associate them as a named range. So that part's done, however how do I create a second dynamically generated, filtered list (preferably without any gaps in the list) based on the Continent association selected in the first list? The actual data I'm digesting is thousands of data points large, so performance is a concern, and I'd prefer to not use VBA if possible. Edit: With a bit more searching I found a link that was helpful, that provided me with this formula: IFERROR(INDEX($A$2:$A$100,SMALL(IF($B$2:$B$100="Yes",ROW($A$2:$A$100)-ROW($A$2)+1),ROWS($A$2:$A2))),"") It's closer, however it won't work since I'd need to put these in a separate column in my worksheet for every row where I need the dynamic drop down list, plus I'm unsure how large the filtered list will be. Is there any way of doing this directly inside a named range?

@TITLE:Motivation for Simple Factory and Factory Method Pattern
@CONTENT:I know there are a lot of questions out there about differences of different factory patterns, but the answers are so different and confusing. The books that i read use unclear and (over)simplified examples. I have a number of questions even after reading Wikipedia explanations, and a lot of online explanations about them including all on these site. The book that I'm currently reading is Head First Design Patterns. In Simple Factory the client uses separate class (Creator) with factory method (which CAN be static) to return Products. In Factory Method Pattern the Creator and the Client are the same thing and they use abstract method in the same class to create new Products, on which they operate in that same class. Of course the Creator (or Client) are abstract, so the decision about making the Concrete Product is deferred to sub-classes. Is my understanding correct (for ex. are the Client and Creator in FMP the same thing, I never see Client in FMP diagram)? In Factory Method Pattern it seams that the create method is not reusable outside of the Creator, so it can only be reused when making some new Creator? What are the situations where I can choose one over the other? (P.S. Please don't mark this as duplicate, I want to make this thing clear on this site)

 I pull in an upstream change onto the master branch:               branch1   branch2

 Now I rebase branch1, giving me this:                         branch2

               |         |
            master    branch1
 Note that because of rebasing branch1, commits A and B have been rewritten as A' and B'. Here's my problem: now I want to rebase branch2. The obvious syntax is git rebase branch1 branch2, but that definitely does not work. What I want it to do is just reapply C and D on top of branch1, but instead it tries to reconcile A and A' and it considers them conflicting. This does work: git rebase --onto branch1 branch2^^ branch2
 This assumes I know that branch2 has exactly 2 commits beyond the previous branch1 ref. Since git rebase --onto works, is there a 1-line git command that will rebase branch2 on top of a newly-rebased branch1, in a way that I don't have to know exactly how many commits were part of branch2? (I want to specify some magic ref instead of branch2^^ for the middle argument.) Or is there some other approach I'm overlooking? I would be most interested in a solution that scales well to extreme cases, not just two branches - suppose I've got something more like 5 local branches, all chained on one another, and I want to rebase all of them together.

@TITLE:Why does CouchDB use an append-only B+ tree and not a HAMT
@CONTENT:I'm reading up on datastructures, especially immutable ones like the append-only B+ tree used in CouchDB and the Hash array mapped trie used in Clojure and some other functional programming languages. The main reason datastructures that work well in memory might not work well on disk appears to be time spent on disk seeks due to fragmentation, as with a normal binary tree. However, HAMT is also very shallow, so doesn't require any more seeks than a B tree. Another suggested reason is that deletions from a array mapped trie are more expensive tha from a B tree. This is based on the assumption that we're talking about a dense vector, and doesn't apply when using either as a hash map. What's more, it seems that a B tree does more rebalancing, so using it in an append-only manner produces more garbage. So why do CouchDB and practically every other database and filesystem use B trees? [edit] fractal trees? log-structured merge tree? mind = blown [edit] Real-life B trees use a degree in the thousands, while a HAMT has a degree of 32. A HAMT of degree 1024 would be possible, but slower due to popcnt handling 32 or 64 bits at a time.

@TITLE:IPython Notebook: Open/select file with GUI (Qt Dialog)
@CONTENT:When you perform the same analysis in a notebook on different data files, may be handy to graphically select a data file. In my python scripts I usually implement a QT dialog that returns the file-name of the selected file: from PySide import QtCore, QtGui

def gui_fname(dir=None):
    """Select a file via a dialog and return the file name.
    """
    if dir is None: dir ='./'
    fname = QtGui.QFileDialog.getOpenFileName(None, "Select data file...", 
            dir, filter="All files (*);; SM Files (*.sm)")
    return fname[0]
 However, running this function from an notebook full_fname = gui_fname()
 causes the kernel to die (and restart): Interestingly, puttying this 3 command in 3 separate cells works %matplotlib qt
full_fname = gui_fname()
%matplotlib inline
 but when I put those commands in one single cell the kernel dies again. This prevents to create a function like gui_fname_ipynb() that transparently allows selecting a file with a GUI. For convenience, I created a notebook illustrating the problem: Open/select file with GUI (Qt Dialog) Any suggestion on how to execute a dialog for file selection from within an IPython Notebook?
@CODE:from PySide import QtCore, QtGui

    """Select a file via a dialog and return the file name.

@LINK:/questions/20763074/mongodb-multikey-compound-index-need-help-understanding-bounds
@TITLE:MongoDB Multikey Compound Index - Need Help Understanding Bounds
@CONTENT:We've recently decided to revisit some of our MongoDB indexes and came across a peculiar result when using a compound index which contains a multikey part. It's important to note that we're using v2.4.5 TLDR: When using a compound index with multikey part, the bounds of a non-multikey field used for range restriction are dropped. I'll explain the problem with an example: Create some data db.demo.insert(
[{ "foo" : 1, "attr" : [  {  "name" : "a" },  {  "name" : "b" },  {  "name" : "c" } ]},
 { "foo" : 2, "attr" : [  {  "name" : "b" },  {  "name" : "c" },  {  "name" : "d" } ]},
 { "foo" : 3, "attr" : [  {  "name" : "c" },  {  "name" : "d" },  {  "name" : "e" } ]},
 { "foo" : 4, "attr" : [  {  "name" : "d" },  {  "name" : "e" },  {  "name" : "f" } ]}])
 Index db.demo.ensureIndex({'attr.name': 1, 'foo': 1})
 Query & Explain Query on 'attr.name' but constrain the range of the non-multikey field 'foo': db.demo.find({foo: {$lt:3, $gt: 1}, 'attr.name': 'c'}).hint('attr.name_1_foo_1').explain()
{
    "cursor" : "BtreeCursor attr.name_1_foo_1",
    "isMultiKey" : true,
    "n" : 1,
    "nscannedObjects" : 2,
    "nscanned" : 2,
    "nscannedObjectsAllPlans" : 2,
    "nscannedAllPlans" : 2,
    "scanAndOrder" : false,
    "indexOnly" : false,
    "nYields" : 0,
    "nChunkSkips" : 0,
    "millis" : 0,
    "indexBounds" : {
        "attr.name" : [
            [
                "c",
                "c"
            ]
        ],
        "foo" : [
            [
                -1.7976931348623157e+308,
                3
            ]
        ]
    }
}
 As you can see, the range of 'foo' is not as defined in the query, one end is completely ignored which results in nscanned being larger than it should. Changing the order of the range operands will alter the dropped end: db.demo.find({foo: {$gt: 1, $lt:3}, 'attr.name': 'c'}).hint('attr.name_1_foo_1').explain()
{
    "cursor" : "BtreeCursor attr.name_1_foo_1",
    "isMultiKey" : true,
    "n" : 1,
    "nscannedObjects" : 2,
    "nscanned" : 2,
    "nscannedObjectsAllPlans" : 2,
    "nscannedAllPlans" : 2,
    "scanAndOrder" : false,
    "indexOnly" : false,
    "nYields" : 0,
    "nChunkSkips" : 0,
    "millis" : 0,
    "indexBounds" : {
        "attr.name" : [
            [
                "c",
                "c"
            ]
        ],
        "foo" : [
            [
                1,
                1.7976931348623157e+308
            ]
        ]
    }
}
 We're either missing out on some multikey index basics, or we're facing a bug. We've gone through similar topics, including: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/mongodb-user/multikey$20bounds/mongodb-user/RKrsyzRwHrE/_i0SxdJV5qcJ Order of $lt and $gt in MongoDB range query Unfortunately these posts address a different use-case where a range is set on the multikeyed value. Other things we've tried to do: Change the compound index ordering, starting with the non-multikey field. Put the 'foo' value inside each of the subdocuments in the 'attr' array, index by ('attr.name', 'attr.foo') and do an $elemMatch on 'attr' with a range constraint on 'foo'. Use an $and operator when defining the range: db.demo.find({'attr.name': 'c', $and: [{num: {$lt: 3}}, {num: {$gt: 1}}]})
 Use MongoDB v2.5.4 None of the above had any effect (v2.5.4 made things worse by dumping both ends of the range completely). Any kind of help would be highly appreciated! Many Thanks, Roi

@LINK:/questions/20703894/how-to-detect-the-browsers-format-for-inputtype-date
@TITLE:How to detect the browser's format for input[type=date]
@CONTENT:Using Javascript, how would it be possible to detect the format of dates in date input fields (input[type=date])? Tools like Modernizr only detect the capability of using an HTML5 datepicker (desirable especially for mobile devices, and their UI for selecting dates). However, I haven't been able to find any solution on detecting the format used by the browser. I have an input field like this: <input type="date" class="border-radius" min="2013-12-21" max="2015-12-20" data-persist-local="FromDate">
 The value is entered with a jQuery call .val() if it's found in localStorage. I thought that since valid date formats for min and max attributes are in valid ISO format, getting the value of the field would return the same format. It turns out, it doesn't. Testing on a Chrome browser (31.0.1650.63 m) with Swedish as primary language gives the ISO format, but using the same browser with Danish as primary language reverses the date format to dd-mm-yyyy instead of yyyy-mm-dd. I suspect it's the same for other locales. I'm not looking to change the input format - and ideally there would be a function to get the date by a consistent "wire format" but I haven't found a way to get anything but the display format. How do I detect the format of the input field, and consistently convert to a valid Date in JS, and back again?

@TITLE:Definition list with inline pairs
@CONTENT:I'm trying to create a definition list of term-definition pairs, each pair existing on a single, separate line. I've tried making dts and dds display:inline, but then I lose the line breaks between the pairs. How do I make sure I have a line for each pair (and not for each individual term/definition)? Example: <dl>
<dt>Term 1</dt><dd>Def 1</dd>
<dt>Term 2</dt><dd>Def 2</dd>
</dl>
 yielding: Term 1 Def 1
Term 2 Def 2
 The CSS for making them inline would be: dt,dd{display:inline;}

<dt>Term 1</dt><dd>Def 1</dd>

@TITLE:Emberjs : how to display loading spinner and notification messages on model operations
@CONTENT:I am using ember.js 1.2 and facing a problem while trying to display loading spinner and notification messages during the crud operations on my models. Here is the code : var MyModelController = Ember.ObjectController.extend({
  needs: ['application'],
  application: Ember.computed.alias("controllers.application"),
  actions: {
    save: function() {
      var _this = this;

      // Display the spinner
      this.get('application').get('loading').trigger(true);

      this.get('model').save().then(function(response) {
        // Hide the spinner
        _this.get('application').get('loading').trigger(false);

        // Display the success message
        _this.get('application').get('flash').success('The model has been updated.');
      }, function(response) {
        // Hide the loading spinner
        _this.get('application').get('loading').trigger(false);

        // Display the error message
        _this.get('application').get('flash').danger('Error updating the model.');
      });
    }
  }
});
 Two main problems here : First : the spinner is displayed with a translation that takes 0.5s but the save operation is performed with less duration and the spinner is displayed and disappears immediately. Here I would like to set a 1s timer before the save operation is called on my model to ensure the animation is performed correctly. How could it be possible ? Second : the success method on my flash object is binded to the specific {{view.message}} on the template. If I call this method outside the 'then' of the promise, the message is well displayed, but in my case it is not as if the binding is not done. Did I miss something in the way to use the promise ? How could it be possible to display this message ?
@CODE:var MyModelController = Ember.ObjectController.extend({
  needs: ['application'],
  application: Ember.computed.alias("controllers.application"),
  actions: {
    save: function() {
      var _this = this;

      // Display the spinner
      this.get('application').get('loading').trigger(true);

      this.get('model').save().then(function(response) {
        // Hide the spinner
        _this.get('application').get('loading').trigger(false);

        // Display the success message
        _this.get('application').get('flash').success('The model has been updated.');
      }, function(response) {
        // Hide the loading spinner
        _this.get('application').get('loading').trigger(false);

        // Display the error message
        _this.get('application').get('flash').danger('Error updating the model.');
      });
    }
  }
});

@LINK:/questions/20661836/implementing-min-and-max-in-clang-without-double-evaluation
@TITLE:Implementing min() and max() in Clang without double evaluation
@CONTENT:The classic preprocessor version of the min function looks like #define min(a, b) ((a) < (b) ? (a) : (b))
 This leaves you open to double evaluationXthe situation in which you do min(f(), g()), forgetting that f or g has side effects, and you have to spend hours trying to figure out why your function is running twice. To prevent this, you can do #define min(a, b) ({__typeof__(a) _a = (a); \
    __typeof__(b) _b = (b); \
    _a < _b ? _a : _b;})
 This works great under GCC, but if you run it through Clang with -Wgnu setXthis set of warnings falls under the umbrella of -pedanticXyou get errors like test.c:5:10: error: use of GNU statement expression extension [-Werror,-Wgnu]
        int a = min(3, 7);
                ^
test.c:1:22: note: expanded from macro 'min'
#  define min(a, b) ({__typeof__(a) _a = (a); __typeof__(b) _b = (b); _a < _b ? _a : _b;})
 Is it possible to define these macros in a way that prevents double evaluation and which is acceptable to Clang under -pedantic? (Yes, you can disable the warning with -Wno-gnu, in which case Clang handles the statement expression without a problem. Im asking because I, like clang -pedantic, am too picky for my own good.) Edit: I am working in C. I tagged this C++ too because I thought a solution might apply to C++ as well as to C. OopsXforgot about templates! Sorry for the ambiguity.
@CODE:min #define min(a, b) ((a) < (b) ? (a) : (b)) min(f(), g()) f g #define min(a, b) ({__typeof__(a) _a = (a); \

@TITLE:Boxed nullable underlying type can be cast to enum but boxed enum type can't be cast to nullable type
@CONTENT:Boxed nullable underlying type can be cast to enum but boxed enum type can't be cast to nullable type. And similarly, Boxed nullable enum can be cast to underlying type but boxed underlying type can't be cast to nullable enum. Ok, I know "boxed nullable type" is not the best way to describe it, but it's for the sake of the question. I'm aware it's the underlying value type that's getting boxed. I will show it with examples. Assume I have an enum with int as the underlying type. enum Sex { Male, Female }
 Case I: int? i = 1;
object o = i;
Sex e = (Sex)o; //success

//but

Sex e = Sex.Male;
object o = e;
int? i = (int?)o; //invalid cast
 Case II: Sex? e = Sex.Male;
object o = e;
int i = (int)o; //success

//but

int i = 1;
object o = i;
Sex? e = (Sex?)o; //invalid cast
 In a nutshell, (enum)int? -> succeeds
(int?)enum -> the reverse fails

(int)enum? -> succeeds
(enum?)int -> the reverse fails
 Or in even simpler terms, cast to non-nullable -> succeeds cast to nullable -> fails Now I do know that once you box a value type, it can be cast back only to the original type. But since by C# rules, a boxed int can be cast to enum and a boxed enum can be cast to int, and a boxed int to int? and a boxed int? to int, I was looking for a consistent understanding of other scenarios as well, ie the ones listed above. But I dont get the logic. For one, I feel if they all failed or if they all succeeded, it made more sense to developers. Two, even the successful casts look a little odd. I mean since a value type can be implicitly cast to its nullable equivalent (and not the other way around), a cast to nullable should anyway succeed, but with the current implementation a nullable type is being successfully cast to non-nullable which can even fail if the former had a null value. Had this whole thing been other way around, it would have been easier comprehending. An example like: Sex? e = null;
object o = e;
int i = (int)o; //succeeds, but sure to explode on cast

//but

int i = 1;
object o = i;
Sex? e = (Sex?)o; //invalid cast, even though its always a safe cast
 Questions: So what C# rule is letting this happen? Is there a simple way I can remember this?
@CODE:enum int enum Sex { Male, Female } int? i = 1;
object o = i;
Sex e = (Sex)o; //success

//but

Sex e = Sex.Male;
object o = e;
int? i = (int?)o; //invalid cast Sex? e = Sex.Male;
object o = e;
int i = (int)o; //success

//but

int i = 1;
object o = i;
Sex? e = (Sex?)o; //invalid cast (enum)int? -> succeeds
(int?)enum -> the reverse fails

(int)enum? -> succeeds
(enum?)int -> the reverse fails int enum enum int int int? int? int Sex? e = null;
object o = e;
int i = (int)o; //succeeds, but sure to explode on cast

//but

int i = 1;
object o = i;
Sex? e = (Sex?)o; //invalid cast, even though its always a safe cast int[] uint[]

@CONTENT:I was wandering what the best approach would be for detecting 'figures' in an array of 2D points. In this example I have two 'templates'. Figure 1 is a template and figure 2 is a template. Each of these templates exists only as a vector of points with an x,y coordinate.

(including scaling, rotation)? I have been trying nearest neigbours(FlannBasedMatcehr) or even SVM implementation but it doesn't seem to get me any result, template matching doesn't seem to be the way to go either, I think. I am not working on images but only on 2D points in memory... Especially because the input vector always has more points than the original data set to be compared with. All it needs to do is find points in array that match a template. I am not a 'specialist' in machine learning or opencv. I guess I am overlooking something from the beginning...

@TITLE:AlarmManager stops working in Android 4.4.2 (using SetExact())
@CONTENT:I'm setting in my code an alarm to go off in specific time. The alarm mechanism works great on SDK < 19, but on 19 the alarms aren't fired. Here is the code where I set the alarm : public void SetAlarm(Context context, Long executionTime)
{

    AlarmManager am = (AlarmManager) context.getSystemService(Context.ALARM_SERVICE);
    Intent intent = new Intent(context, AlarmReciever.class);
    PendingIntent pi = PendingIntent.getBroadcast(context, 0, intent, PendingIntent.FLAG_UPDATE_CURRENT);
    // Only one alarm can live, so cancel previous.
    am.cancel(pi);
    if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT < Build.VERSION_CODES.KITKAT) {
        am.set(AlarmManager.RTC_WAKEUP, executionTime, pi);
    } else {
        setAlarmFromKitkat(am, executionTime, pi);
    }
}
 Since I'm setting the alarm using a Service I use GetApplicationContext() as the context. The onReceive() code : @Override
public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
    for (SchedulerListener listener : listeners) {
        listener.fetchAndRebuildNotification();
    }
}
 Here is the declaration of the BroadcastReceiver : <receiver 
        android:name="com.SagiL.myAppName.BroadCastReceivers.AlarmReciever" />
 The callback runs a method in a service (which is still alive when the alarm supposed to fire, notice it doesn't starts one). This whole thing is a library which is used in my app, and there I declare the receiver the same way. Sometimes the alarm do fires once, but mostly it doesn't fire at all. Has anyone experienced such a thing ? I can't believe it's common to SDK 19 since a lot of apps are using AlarmManager and they will break too if it is common.
@CODE:public void SetAlarm(Context context, Long executionTime)
{

    AlarmManager am = (AlarmManager) context.getSystemService(Context.ALARM_SERVICE);
    Intent intent = new Intent(context, AlarmReciever.class);

//Here I plot other stuff, setup the x & y scale correctly etc. 
//Then to plot the line:

        var data = [x.domain(), y.domain()];
        var result = regression('linear', data);
        console.log(result)
        console.log(result.equation[0]);
        var linereg = d3.svg.line()
                        .x(function (d) { return x(d.Ascendenti); })
                        .y(function (d) { return y((result.equation[0] * d.Ascendenti) + result.equation[1]); });
        var reglinepath = svg.append("path")
                            .attr("class", "line")
                            .attr("d", linereg(dataset))

                            .attr("stroke-width", 1 + "px");
 The values of result are the following in the console:     Object
      equation: Array[2]

Any help is really really appreciated, even a solution involving the simple.statistics.js library would be helpful! Thanks!

@CONTENT:I am using an Android Stick (http://www.geekbuying.com/item/Uhost-2-Dual-Core-TV-Box-Mini-PC-Android-4-0-4-RK3066-Cortex-A9-1-6GHZ-1GB-RAM-4G-ROM-with-Bluetooth-WIFI-Skype-XBMC---Black-312467.html) for building an application. The application uses an attached USB webcam for some of it's functionality. Additionally, I connect a mouse to this device which the user can use to navigate through various pages in the application. A left/right movement of the mouse results in navigation to previous/next page. While the mouse works with the Android device, I additionally require to reset the position of the mouse to the center after every single interaction with the user. Is it possible to set the mouse position using software in Android? I am using View.OnGenericMotionListener to capture the mouse movement. Currently, I also require to perform a primary mouse button click to bring the mouse in focus inside the application. I want to remove this requirement by either generating the primary mouse button click in software, or otherwise bring the application in software by some other means. I have been unable to find any APIs to get the above to work. Any help on these would be greatly useful. Just in case I need to write some sort of drivers to get this thing working, any help in this direction would also be useful. Any workarounds around this problem, while still using the mouse, could also prove useful.

@CONTENT:I want to get last visited URL in chrome and other browser's. I am able to get Last URL in android Native browser. I use following code for this - Cursor cur = getContentResolver().query(Browser.BOOKMARKS_URI,

@TITLE:Looking for a mature M-Tree implementation [closed]
@CONTENT:I'm searching for a mature java M-Tree implementation -- Or even ANY M-Tree implementation (besides the only implementation I have found) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-tree For those who haven't heard of an M-tree (like me 2 days ago), an M-Tree is a search tree that can retrieve "n-nearest entries" or "all entries within Distance d" when the keys it uses can be placed in a "metric space" (the M stands for Metric). I found one online at: https://github.com/erdavila/M-Tree This implementation is workable if necessary but it is not Serializable, does not provide a "contains()" method, and it is currently throwing an assertion error (which I've figured out how to fix). If a slightly more polished implementation exists I'd like to know because this data-structure seems super useful and I'd like to find a canonical implementation. --- Added more info (in an effort to keep this question from getting closed) --- My end goal is a Map in which the "public Value get(Key)" method returns the "closest" Value even when there isn't a precise Key match. Because I'm using Keys that are defined over a Metric Space I'm looking at for at a MTree to handle the "closest" part of this problem. The implementation above isn't going to work because (1) it fails when the same Key is put in twice, (2) it won't allow me to remove a Key, and (3) it won't allow me to test if a Key was already inserted.

@CONTENT:I have an issue with some processes stuck in a D state on Ubuntu 10.04.3 LTS. They have been in this state since Nov the 5th (today being December 6th). I understand these are non-inturuptable sleep states often related to waiting for data from hardware such as a hard disk. This is a production server so rebooting is a very last resort, is anyone able to shed any light on what these processes might be?

@TITLE:Local storage protection in phonegap application
@CONTENT:I should develop an phonegap application. I need to encrypt my requests to the server side and then decrypt. HTTPS is not a solution, because I need to sign requests to be sure that the data is not fake. I can use any async cryptography (the app will generate private/public keys and will send public key to the server). But this way I need to keep my private key on the device. The question is: how I can keep private key on the device securely? I can use sqlclipher (to encrypt my local SQLite DB) and integrate it into my phonegap app. Great, but here I have to keep secret key for database :) var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: "DB", key: "secret1"});
 Any one who have access to the phone can get this secret key. So here I have the same issue:) Please, give me any suggestions. Thanks! p.s. app for iOS and Android

@TITLE:Python-Sphinx: How to document one file with functions?
@CONTENT:I have a python file with functions (lib.py), without classes. Each function has the following style: def fnc1(a,b,c):
    '''
    This fonction does something.

    :param a: lalala
    :type a: str
    :param b: hahaha
    :type b: int
    :param c: hohoho
    :type c: int

    :rtype: int

    '''

    print a
    d = b + c

    return d
 I just want to document each function (inputs and outputs) with Sphinx. After doing sphinx-quickstart, I defined the path in conf.py with my lib.py. But the output html file (welcome page) is empty. If I write myself in index.rst: .. function:: func1(a,b,c)
    This fonction does something.

    :param a: lalala
    :type a: str
    :param b: hahaha
    :type b: int
    :param c: hohoho
    :type c: int
    :rtype: int
 it is ok, it shows the inputs and outputs in html file. But how to do it automatically? Normally, I think, it must to do it in lib.rst after doing sphinx-apidoc -o, but in lib.rst there is only: lib module

@TITLE:SendMessage of MFC equivalent in Qt
@CONTENT:Porting VS2010 project in QT . I guess, I wasnt very clear with my earlier post so here I am explaining it again. The issue is .. I have lots of sub Qdialog windows which when user click generates some messages. I want those messages to be on my QTablewidget of my main Application window. Now As suggested by some members that I should look how things have done in VS2010 and try to replicate same in QT . So Here is my design .. Please let me know your suggestion /criticism. 1) vs 2010 -> On Main application window in MESSAGE_MAP
 we have ON_MESSAGE( WM_NOTICE, OnAddMessage )
 where WM_NOTICE = WM_USER+1; doing same in QT I need signal and slot . so Something like connect( sender , SIGNAL(QtSingleApplication::messageReceived ( const QString &message )  ) , this , SLOT ( on_add_message( const QString & message ) );
 now what should I replace here with sender ? , who will be the sender in my case ? SIGNAL (QtSingleApplication::messageReceived ) is right ? Slot X there is no issue here .. I can implement that code in which I will place the message in QTable widegt in sorting order. 2) Now if I look into inner QDialog windows source code of existing project which was developed in VC++ they have something like void Message_information::add( const SMS& message )
{
//SMS is a  structure  and fields are SYSTEMTIME, Enum , CString
 CCriticalSection critical_section;
CSingleLock   lock( &critical_section, true );
messages_.insert( message ); // where messages_ is an object std::multiset

SendMessage( dialog_->m_hWnd, WM_MULTIBOXMESSAGE, 0, 0 );
}
 Now doing same in Qt void Message_information::add( const SMS& message )
{
  QMutex mutex;
  mutex.lock();
messages_.insert( message ); // where messages_ is an object std::multiset

//SendMessage( dialog_->m_hWnd, WM_MULTIBOXMESSAGE, 0, 0 );
QtSingleApplication::sendMessage ( // send multiset values here   );

}
 What paramemter should I Add in SendMessage? IS infact sendMessage is correct function to call? this add function is being called somewhere else . I know this sounds duplicate of other questions and I have looked into the link provided my some members but I am sorry I couldnt able to grasp much. X Any suggestion or criticism might help me .. hanks a lot for al the help
@CODE:MESSAGE_MAP ON_MESSAGE( WM_NOTICE, OnAddMessage ) connect( sender , SIGNAL(QtSingleApplication::messageReceived ( const QString &message )  ) , this , SLOT ( on_add_message( const QString & message ) ); void Message_information::add( const SMS& message )
{
//SMS is a  structure  and fields are SYSTEMTIME, Enum , CString
 CCriticalSection critical_section;
CSingleLock   lock( &critical_section, true );
messages_.insert( message ); // where messages_ is an object std::multiset

SendMessage( dialog_->m_hWnd, WM_MULTIBOXMESSAGE, 0, 0 );
} void Message_information::add( const SMS& message )
{
  QMutex mutex;
  mutex.lock();
messages_.insert( message ); // where messages_ is an object std::multiset

//SendMessage( dialog_->m_hWnd, WM_MULTIBOXMESSAGE, 0, 0 );
QtSingleApplication::sendMessage ( // send multiset values here   );

} WM_MULTIBOXMESSAGE

@TITLE:Autolayout and Device Orientation
@CONTENT:I am developing an application which supports portrait and landscape modes. I am using auto layout to arrange my views. As i have been reading many posts and i have realized that developers commonly use one among the following approaches. 1. First approach: Implement the UIViewController:updateConstraints method and update constraints according to device orientation. 2. Second approach: Implement the UIViewController:viewWillLayoutSubviews method and update constraints according to device orientation. Could anyone please tell me what is the best approach to use ? I have been searching for a best practice to combine autorotation and auto layout and nothing yet. Thanks.

@CONTENT:Say we have a group of 10 people, within 20m of one another. Each person has a mobile phone (iPhone / android / Windows phone). And one person taps the screen to send a message. And this is instantly registered by the others. Synchronisation is the key. It has to hit all target devices within a few milliseconds. How might I go about this? web sockets: I can't see this working as there is not guaranteed to be any Wi-Fi network. maybe I set up one phone as an access point, and the others connect to it? Bluetooth: maybe? Audio: maybe, speed of sound is probably close enough time resolution. But messy. Anything else? I'm working in Unity3D, although since it allows mobile plug-ins I could implement separately per platform. An iphone-only solution would still be of interest. EDIT: Please don't just say 'Use Bluetooth' EDIT: One way to rephrase the question: is it possible to set up a bunch of mobile phones so that UDP packets can be sent between them?

@TITLE:Resumable upload using Drive API for Android
@CONTENT:I want to upload large files (>10Mb) to Google Drive, using the drive api. It is working fine with smaller files (when there's good wifi), using direct upload: Drive.Files.Insert insert = driveService.files().insert(fileMetadata, mediaContent);
MediaHttpUploader uploader = insert.getMediaHttpUploader();
uploader.setChunkSize(UPLOAD_CHUNK_SIZE);
uploader.setDirectUploadEnabled(true);
insert.execute();
 Now, suppose we are uploading a larger file. We want to keep track of the connection, so we use resumable upload, given by MediaHttpUploader method... uploader.setDirectUploadEnabled(false);
uploader.setProgressListener(new MediaHttpUploaderProgressListener() {
    @Override
    public void progressChanged(MediaHttpUploader mediaHttpUploader) throws IOException {
        switch (mediaHttpUploader.getUploadState()) {
            case INITIATION_STARTED:     break;
            case INITIATION_COMPLETE:  break;
            case MEDIA_IN_PROGRESS:   break;
            case MEDIA_COMPLETE:        break;
        }
    }
});
 Ok. But there is no state for MEDIA_FAILED, am I correct? And what can I do when the upload does not reach MEDIA_COMPLETE? Also, I found no method to resume the upload. So even if a 100Mb upload is at 90% and fails, all I can do is start it all over again?? PS: this issue has been reported before without success Check progress for Upload & Download (Google Drive API for Android or Java) Android Google Drive Resumable Upload fails very often
@CODE:Drive.Files.Insert insert = driveService.files().insert(fileMetadata, mediaContent);
MediaHttpUploader uploader = insert.getMediaHttpUploader();
uploader.setChunkSize(UPLOAD_CHUNK_SIZE);

insert.execute(); uploader.setDirectUploadEnabled(false);
uploader.setProgressListener(new MediaHttpUploaderProgressListener() {

 The problem is that the father of the process keeps on beign locked, even after son's signaling.

@LINK:/questions/20230827/how-to-set-include-paths-with-autotools
@TITLE:how to set include paths with autotools
@CONTENT:I'm working on a C++ project that uses autoconf & automake, and I'm struggling to correctly set up the include paths in *CPPFLAGS. I've read about 3 hours worth of documents, and I can't figure it out yet. I'm not looking for a hack, but for the correct way to do this. Here is my conundrum. As I see it, there are 3 completely different sources for include paths: External libraries that must be installed along with my package, which are configured by configure --with-XXX=<PATH>. Within my package, some source files use #include <file.h> even when file.h is part of the package, so to compile them, I must set the include path correctly. (Note, it's not an option to edit all these files.) Whimsical (or not) standards specify the user must be allowed to specify their own (extra) include paths. That is, I shouldn't be setting CPPFLAGS at all. In my current setup: Type 1 paths are set inside configure.ac by AC_SUBST(CPPFLAGS, "$CPPFLAGS -I<path>"). Type 2 paths are set inside Makefile.am by test_CPPFLAGS = -I<path>. Type 3 cannot be set. More exactly, if the user sets CPPFLAGS before running make, this overrides Type 1 settings, causing compilation to fail. Of course, the user could try to use CXXFLAGS instead, but that one has a different use (remember, I'm asking for the correct way to do this, not a hack). I tried to fix this by setting Type 1 paths using AM_CPPFLAGS inside configure.ac. (For reference: if you set AM_CPPFLAGS instead of CPPFLAGS, but you still need to run some checks such as AC_CHECK_HEADERS, you need to temporarily set CPPFLAGS and then revert it for the checks to work; this is explained here.) This frees up CPPFLAGS for Type 3 paths, but unfortunately the compilation fails because the Makefile-s that gets produced by configure will only use AM_CPPFLAGS if no specialized <target>_CPPFLAGS exists. So, if test_CPPFLAGS exists with a Type 2 path, compiling test will fail because it doesn't get the Type 1 path. A fix would be to specify inside Makefile.am to always use AM_CPPFLAGS. But is this "by the book"? Can I do this in a global way, or do I have to edit every single target_CPPFLAGS? Is there another "correct" solution?
@CODE:autoconf automake *CPPFLAGS configure --with-XXX=<PATH> #include <file.h> file.h CPPFLAGS configure.ac AC_SUBST(CPPFLAGS, "$CPPFLAGS -I<path>") Makefile.am test_CPPFLAGS = -I<path> CPPFLAGS make CXXFLAGS AM_CPPFLAGS configure.ac AM_CPPFLAGS CPPFLAGS AC_CHECK_HEADERS CPPFLAGS CPPFLAGS Makefile configure AM_CPPFLAGS <target>_CPPFLAGS test_CPPFLAGS test Makefile.am AM_CPPFLAGS target_CPPFLAGS

@TITLE:C++ Low-Latency Threaded Asynchronous Buffered Stream (intended for logging) V Boost
@CONTENT:Question: 3 while loops below contain code that has been commented out. I search for ("TAG1", "TAG2", and "TAG3") for easy identification. I simply want the while loops to wait on the condition tested to become true before proceeding while minimizing CPU resources as much as possible. I first tried using Boost condition variables, but there's a race condition. Putting the thread to sleep for 'x' microseconds is inefficient because there is no way to precisely time the wakeup. Finally, boost::this_thread::yield() does not seem to do anything. Probably because I only have 2 active threads on a dual-core system. Specifically, how can I make the three tagged areas below run more efficiently while introducing as little unnecessary blocking as possible. BACKGROUND Objective: I have an application that logs a lot of data. After profiling, I found that much time is consumed on the logging operations (logging text or binary to a file on the local hard disk). My objective is to reduce the latency on logData calls by replacing non-threaded direct write calls with calls to a threaded buffered stream logger. Options Explored: Upgrade 2005-era slow hard disk to SSD...possible. Cost is not prohibitive...but involves a lot of work... more than 200 computers would have to be upgraded... Boost ASIO...I don't need all the proactor / networking overhead, looking for something simpler and more light-weight. Design: Producer and consumer thread pattern, the application writes data into a buffer and a background thread then writes it to disk sometime later. So the ultimate goal is to have the writeMessage function called by the application layer return as fast as possible while data is correctly / completely logged to the log file in a FIFO order sometime later. Only one application thread, only one writer thread. Based on ring buffer. The reason for this decision is to use as few locks as possible and ideally...and please correct me if I'm wrong...I don't think I need any. Buffer is a statically-allocated character array, but could move it to the heap if needed / desired for performance reasons. Buffer has a start pointer that points to the next character that should be written to the file. Buffer has an end pointer that points to the array index after the last character to be written to the file. The end pointer NEVER passes the start pointer. If a message comes in that is larger than the buffer, then the writer waits until the buffer is emptied and writes the new message to the file directly without putting the over-sized message in the buffer (once the buffer is emptied, the worker thread won't be writing anything so no contention). The writer (worker thread) only updates the ring buffer's start pointer. The main (application thread) only updates the ring buffer's end pointer, and again, it only inserts new data into the buffer when there is available space...otherwise it either waits for space in the buffer to become available or writes directly as described above. The worker thread continuously checks to see if there is data to be written (indicated by the case when the buffer start pointer != buffer end pointer). If there is no data to be written, the worker thread should ideally go to sleep and wake up once the application thread has inserted something into the buffer (and changed the buffer's end pointer such that it no longer points to the same index as the start pointer). What I have below involves while loops continuously checking that condition. It is a very bad / inefficient way of waiting on the buffer. Results: On my 2009-era dual-core laptop with SSD, I see that the total write time of the threaded / buffered benchmark vs. direct write is about 1 : 6 (0.609 sec vs. 0.095 sec), but highly variable. Often the buffered write benchmark is actually slower than direct write. I believe that the variability is due to the poor implementation of waiting for space to free up in the buffer, waiting for the buffer to empty, and having the worker-thread wait for work to become available. I have measured that some of the while loops consume over 10000 cycles and I suspect that those cycles are actually competing for hardware resources that the other thread (worker or application) requires to finish the computation being waited on. Output seems to check out. With TEST mode enabled and a small buffer size of 10 as a stress test, I diffed hundreds of MBs of output and found it to equal the input.

 Update: November 25, 2013 I updated the code below use boost::condition_variables, specifically the wait_for() method as recommended by Evgeny Panasyuk. This avoids unnecessarily checking the same condition over and over again. I am currently seeing the buffered version run in about 1/6th the time as the unbuffered / direct-write version. This is not the ideal case because both cases are limited by the hard disk (in my case a 2010 era SSD). I plan to use the code below in an environment where the hard disk will not be the bottleneck and most if not all the time, the buffer should have space available to accommodate the writeMessage requests. That brings me to my next question. How big should I make the buffer? I don't mind allocating 32 MBs or 64 MB to ensure that it never fills up. The code will be running on systems that can spare that. Intuitively, I feel that it's a bad idea to statically allocate a 32 MB character array. Is it? Anyhow, I expect that when I run the code below for my intended application, the latency of logData() calls will be greatly reduced which will yield a significant reduction in overall processing time. If anyone sees any way to make the code below better (faster, more robust, leaner, etc), please let me know. I appreciate the feedback. Lazin, how would your approach be faster or more efficient than what I have posted below? I kinda like the idea of just having one buffer and making it large enough so that it practically never fills up. Then I don't have to worry about reading from different buffers. Evgeny Panasyuk, I like the approach of using existing code whenever possible, especially if it's an existing boost library. However, I also don't see how the spcs_queue is more efficient than what I have below. I'd rather deal with one large buffer than many smaller ones and have to worry about splitting splitting my input stream on the input and splicing it back together on the output. Your approach would allow me to offload the formatting from the main thread onto the worker thread. That is a cleaver approach. But I'm not sure yet whether it will save a lot of time and to realize the full benefit, I would have to modify code that I do not own. //End Update

 To csv that looks like this: "123","abc"

 I would prefer to use the command line tool jq but can't seem to figure out how to do the assignment. I managed to get the keys with jq '. | keys' test.json but couldn't figure out what to do next. The problem is you can't convert a k:v object like this straight into csv with @csv. It needs to be an array so we need to convert to an array first. If the keys were named, it would be simple but they're dynamic so its not so easy.

@TITLE:Enter website by logging in Google Account using Python [closed]
@CONTENT:I am making a website that makes graphs of the number of people present in groups (from www.codecamy.com). To achieve this I came with a plan. I will have a server which will poll the CodeCademy groups page (http://www.codecademy.com/groups) every 30 seconds and retrieve the needed information from that HTML. Then, when a client connects to my website, the server will give the client that information and then the client will use either http://www.chartjs.org/docs/ or http://www.jqplot.com/ to draw the graph based on that information. However, there is a big problem. If you have clicked any of the links from CodeCademy, then you realized you need to have an account to actually see the website. This can be a facebook account, a google account or a twitter account. So, short story, if I want to access the page with the information about the groups, I need to have a Bot account for my server and I need to teach my server to login into that account. Thus, I have created a dummy account at gmail, called codecademybot, and I want my server to use this account to login into codecademy so it can see that page's content. By following a quickstart python tutorial that connects me to google+ I now also have the code to interact with it. However, despite all this, I still don't have the smallest idea on how to interact with the website. I have the following questions: How do I detect if I am logged in my google account? How do I connect myself to that account so I can then access the page? Is there a special link to login into that website? I am quite lost and would appreciate any possible help.

@TITLE:Google Analytics: custom metrics/dimensions vs events
@CONTENT:What is the difference between custom metrics/dimensions and events? As far as I know, the basic differences are: Metrics aren't sent right away when they're set, but on the subsequent hits; Dimentsions aren't tied to metrics as events actions are to events categories; Events can be used to achieve goals; Dimensions and metrics have usage limits. I learned to use events first. I have the following events in my code (category/action): Account / create

Transaction / create / <transaction type>

Transaction / create-first (the first time the user interacts with the app)

Transaction / remove
 And the following goals for these events: Create account -> Account/create
Create the first transaction (Transaction/create-first)
 I can see these data on my reports using metric widgets configured to show Total events, filtered by the event action and category, or showing directly the goals, since they are metrics. But then I discovereng custom metrics, and now I don't now which one I should use to track this data. I can achieve the same results with both, though events seems more flexible. Using custom metrics and dimensions, I can have the following configuration: Metrics Total transactions
Created accounts
Removed transactions
 Dimensions Transaction type
 Did I get something wrong? Both solve the problem, but I believe choosing the right one now might save me from problems in the future.
@CODE:Account / create

Transaction / create / <transaction type>

Transaction / create-first (the first time the user interacts with the app)

Transaction / remove Create account -> Account/create

I can use the macro BOOST_VERSION and this is fine. I also wanted to determine which is the runtime version of boost so I could compare with the boost version that was used to compile my library. Obviously I cannot use the macro because it will give me the hard coded version at compile time, not at runtime. What I needed is a function in boost (like boost::get_version()).

@TITLE:Can Dijkstra's Single Source Shortest Path Algorithm dectect an infinite cycle in a graph?
@CONTENT:So I came to this beautiful problem that asks you to write a program that finds whether a negative infinity shortest path exists in a directed graph. (Also can be thought of as finding whether a "negative cycle" exists in the graph). Here's a link for the problem: http://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&page=show_problem&problem=499 I successfully solved the problem by running Bellman Ford Algorithm twice by starting with any source in the graph. The second time I run the algorithm, I check if a node can be relaxed. If so, then there is definitely a negative cycle in the graph. Below is my C++ code: #include<iostream>
#include<vector>
#include<algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main()

    int test;
    cin>>test;

    for(int T=0; T<test; T++)

            edge[i]= new int [3];
            cin>>edge[i][0]>>edge[i][1]>>edge[i][2];
        }

        int *d= new int [node];

        bool possible=false;

        for(int i=0; i<node;i++)
        {
            d[i]= 999999999;

            }
        }

                }

            } 

            if(possible)

            cout<<"possible"<<endl;
        else
            cout<<"not possible"<<endl;

    }
}
 A professor told me once that Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm cannot find such negative cycle, but he did not justify it. I actually doubt this claim. My question is, can Dijktstra's single source shortest path algorithm detect that negative cycle? Of course, I can try Dijkstra's and check whether it will work, but I was excited to share this idea with you.

  def * = (id.?, minTemp.?, maxTemp.?) <> (Cooler.tupled, Cooler.unapply _)
}

object Coolers {
  val tableQuery = TableQuery[Coolers]
}
 because I have a lot of tables, I want to define generic methods for them, like find, delete, update so I have to define these methods in a super class from where to extend my objects (object Coolers extends TableUtils[Coolers, Cooler]). In order to define those methods, I need tableQuery to move out of my object in this super class, so I tried it like: abstract class TableUtils[T <: Table[A] , A] {

val tableQuery = TableQuery[T]  

}
 but I receive an error on tableQuery definition: class type required but T found Does anybody know what I am doing wrong?
@CODE:case class Cooler(id: Option[Int], minTemp: Option[Double], maxTemp: Option[Double])

/**
 * Define table "cooler".
 */
class Coolers(tag: Tag) extends Table[Cooler](tag, "cooler") {
  def id = column[Int]("id", O.PrimaryKey, O.AutoInc)
  def minTemp = column[Double]("min_temp", O.Nullable)
  def maxTemp = column[Double]("max_temp", O.Nullable)

  def * = (id.?, minTemp.?, maxTemp.?) <> (Cooler.tupled, Cooler.unapply _)
}

object Coolers {
  val tableQuery = TableQuery[Coolers]
} find delete update object Coolers extends TableUtils[Coolers, Cooler] tableQuery abstract class TableUtils[T <: Table[A] , A] {

val tableQuery = TableQuery[T]  

} tableQuery class type required but T found

@TITLE:HtmlAttributes in Extension Method
@CONTENT:I'm using MVC 5 and I'm trying to write some Bootstrap extention methods. My goal is to 'overwrite' the Html.ActionLink method with Html.BootstrapLinkButton. The BootstrapLinkButton method should generate a link with the css classes "btn btn-default"automatically attached. My code so far: public static MvcHtmlString BootstrapLinkButton(this HtmlHelper htmlHelper, 
    string linkText,string actionName, string controllerName, 
    object routeValues = null, object htmlAttributes = null)
    {
        var attributes = 
            HtmlHelper.AnonymousObjectToHtmlAttributes(htmlAttributes);

        if (attributes.ContainsKey("class"))
        {
            object value;
            attributes.TryGetValue("class", out value);
            value = (value as string) + " btn btn-default";
            attributes["class"] = value;
        }
        else
        {
            attributes["class"] = "btn btn-default";
        }

        return htmlHelper.ActionLink(
            linkText, actionName, controllerName, routeValues, 
            new Dictionary<string, object>(attributes));
    }
 which gives me the following result in the HTML: <a comparer="System.Collections.Generic.GenericEqualityComparer`1[System.String]"
   count="3"
   keys="System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary`2
         +KeyCollection[System.String,System.Object]"    
   values="System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary`2
           +ValueCollection[System.String,System.Object]" 
   href="/test/test/">

</a>
 I searched the internet, but nothing seems to fix this problem. Does anyone knows the magic code to fix this?

@TITLE:Add Nested Fragment after Parent Fragment view is already created
@CONTENT:I am trying to create a Fragment which has a public method for adding child Fragments to itself. I've been reading through potentially similar questions but haven't found anything to help so far. I've reduced the problem down to a simple test app shown below. Once fragA has been added to the main layout, I call the public method fragA.addFragB() to get it to add an instance of FragmentClassB to itself, but this causes the test app to crash, indicating "Activity has been destroyed" (see LogCat at the end of the post). Does this mean fragA has been destroyed so I can't add fragB to it, or does it mean fragB has been destroyed so I can't add it to fragA? Or does it mean something else entirely?

 EDIT: ianhanniballake's answer and GrIsHu's later answer which expands on the same point have both been helpful in pointing out the root of the problem. However this raises a further issue. The final intention is that FragmentClassA will be part of a library. It will be used in multiple situations and the number of FragmentClassB instances will vary, or there may even be none. Hence I need to be able to trigger the addition of the child fragments to any instance of FragmentClassA from the parent activity. I've just had a look at keeping fragA as a class level variable in MainActivity and then calling fragA.AddFragB() in the MainActivity's onActivityCreated() method, but it is not available to be overridden. Any thoughts?

        FragmentTransaction fragTrans = fragMan.beginTransaction();
        FragmentClassA fragA = new FragmentClassA();
        fragTrans.add(R.id.mainLinearLayout, fragA);
        fragTrans.addToBackStack("A");
        fragTrans.commit();

        // get Fragment A to add a Fragment B to itself

@TITLE:how to use JSONP in AngularJS resource
@CONTENT:I'm trying to import json object into variable. I use the services according to tutorial. I receive unexpected token error, because i shouldn't use $scope.news = JsonSource.feed(); - but I really don't know what should I use. I googled and searched 3 hours I find only $http. or $json. answers, but I feel, that it could be done easier - clearer. (The perfect solution would be $scope.news = JsonSource.feed().entries ;D The services file: var AAAServices = angular.module('AAAServices', [
    'ngResource'
]);

AAAServices.factory('JsonSource', ['$resource',
  function($resource) {
    return $resource('https://www.facebook.com/feeds/page.php', {}, {
      feed: {method:'JSONP', {format: 'json', id:'459908', callback : JSON_CALLBACK}, isArray:false}
      });
  }]);
 The controllers file: var AAAControllers = angular.module('AAAControllers', [])
AAAControllers.controller('newsCtrl', ['$scope', 'JsonSource', 
  function newsCtrl($scope, JsonSource) {
     $scope.news = JsonSource.feed();
}]);
 the json file (almost ;D) {

 Edited: i change $resource('file.json into https://www.facebook.com/feeds/page.php - so you can check if it is json or jsonp...

@TITLE:D3 multi-series line chart from pivoted JSON
@CONTENT:There is a great example of a multi-series line chart here http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3884955 and if the tsv data were laid out I'm sure it would look something like this: [
  {
    "date": "20111001",

    "New York": "53.3",
    "San Francisco": "59.1",
    "Austin": "69.4"
  }
]
 The issue I have is that I may not always know the keys, cities in this case, and would not want a solution that stores the cities in the key. If my data looked like this: [
    {
        "City": "New York",
        "Data": [
            {
                "Date": "20111001",

                "Value": "58.0"
            },
            {
                "Date": "20111003",
                "Value": "53.3"
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "City": "San Francisco",
        "Data": [

                "Value": "62.7"
            },
            {
                "Date": "20111002",
                "Value": "59.9"

                "Date": "20111003",
                "Value": "59.1"
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "City": "Austin",
        "Data": [
            {

                "Value": "69.4"
            }
        ]
    }
]

@TITLE:Class loading collision between Robolectric and Powermock
@CONTENT:I'm trying to write a test that needs both Robolectric 2.2 and PowerMock, as the code under test depends on some Android libraries and third party libraries with final classes that I need to mock. Given that I'm forced to use the Robolectric test runner through: @RunWith(RobolectricTestRunner.class)
 ...I cannot use the PowerMock test runner, so I'm trying to go with the PowerMock java agent alternative, without luck so far. I have setup everything according to this guide but I'm facing a collision problem between classes required by the javaagent library and by robolectric through its dependency with asm-1.4. Both depend on org.objectweb.asm.ClassVisitor , but javaagent-1.5.1 ships with its own version where ClassVisitor is an interface while asm-1.4 version for the same namespace is an abstract class, with the corresponding error at runtime: java.lang.IncompatibleClassChangeError: class org.objectweb.asm.tree.ClassNode has interface org.objectweb.asm.ClassVisitor as super class
 I have even tried to modify the javaagent library jar to entirely remove the org.objectew.asm classes in there, but that doesn't work as ClassNotFoundException happens afterwards due to some other classes needed in the org.objectweb.asm package that only ship in the javaagent library jar, and not in the asm one. Any ideas? According to examples out there the agent seems to work fine with, at least, the Spring test runner.

@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: Format double value in scientific notation 4 answers I'm writing a program that deals with planets' mass and diameter; These quantities are expressed in scientific notation. My question is NOT, mind you, NOT how does one print large numbers the right way (That's using printf(), duh), its how I would... "type" these numbers, I guess you could say. For example, the mass of mercury is expressed: 3.30 x 10?23
 And in my array of planet masses, an element would look: 33.0 * Math.pow(10, 23)
 However, I don't quite think this is the right way - it looks like it would throw an exception... So how could I express large numbers like that from a programmer's perspective? Thanks!

@TITLE:Binding to a method with parameter in XAML using polymorphism in ViewModel
@CONTENT:I have a TabControl with six tabs in my ResultView. The ViewModel that sits behind this View can be either a ResultTypeOneViewModel or ResultTypeTwoViewModel, each of which derives from ResultViewModel but you can interchangeably use the result viewer with either result type. The difference is that in ResultTypeOneViewModel, tabs 1 & 3 need to be visible and the rest hidden. In ResultTypeTwoViewModel, tabs 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 need to be visible and tab 1 hidden. I wanted to do this via something like <TabItem Name="1" Visibility={Binding IsTabVisible(0)}>
<TabItem Name="2" Visibility={Binding IsTabVisible(1)}>
<TabItem Name="3" Visibility={Binding IsTabVisible(2)}>
etc...
 And have an abstract method declaration in ResultsViewModel such as public abstract Visibility IsTabVisible(int index);
 And in ResultsOneViewModel have public override Visibility IsTabVisible(int index)
{
    if (index == 0 || index == 2) return Visibility.Visible;
    return Visibility.Hidden;
}
 And in ResultsTwoViewModel have public override Visibility IsTabVisible(int index)
{
    if (index == 0) return Visibility.Hidden;
    return Visibility.Visible;
}
 But I cannot figure out how to call a method like this with a parameter through bindings iN WPF XAML. Can anyone suggest how I can do this or if it's not possible via this method, another way I could solve this problem?

@CONTENT:I know that similar questions have been asked before, but... We want to develop (at least hope) an indie game but still a game with high quality graphics with hundreds if not thousends of moving objects on the screen so we expect very high number of polygons and requirements for hittest and perhaps some AI. I know the basic problem with java is garbage collection. But it's not an issue, we plan to allocate all of the required memory before the game starts and for transient objects we will use pooling (so in the game loop the new keyword will never be written). And we plan to use every possible techique mentioned here (Google I/O 2009 - Writing Real-Time Games for Android). The main reason we insist on Java is deployment and we only want to develop for Android (for now at least) So can the same performance in a game be achived with Java (even if that means ugly/not idiomatic code) as if we did it with c++. If not, what are the specifics? Or perhaps if it's possible but very-very unpractical what are these reasons? (For example I read something about java Buffers and OpenGL are not the best pairing but don't remember the specifics - maybe some expert)

@TITLE:UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext() - Memory Leak
@CONTENT:I am opening the camera with UIImagePickerControllerSourceTypeCamera and a custom cameraOverlayView so I can take multiple photos without the "Use Photo" step. This is working great, but there is a memory leak in the save photo function. Through a lot of debugging and research I have narrowed it down to the UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext function. Here is a snippet of code where it happens: UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptions(timestampedImage.frame.size, timestampedImage.opaque, [[UIScreen mainScreen] scale]);
[[timestampedImage layer] renderInContext:UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext()];
UIImage *finalTimestampImage = UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext();
UIGraphicsEndImageContext();
 I have scoured the internet and it seems that the UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext() function (quoted from this SO question) "returns a new autoreleased UIImage and points the finalTimestampImage ivar to it. The previously allocated UIImage is never actually released, the variable to it is just repointed to somewhere else." I've tried so many solutions that have apparently worked for others: Adding timestampedImage.layer.contents = nil; after UIGraphicsEndImageContext Adding CGContextRef context = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext(); and CGContextRelease(context); after UIGraphicsEndImageContext Wrapping the above snippet in an NSAutoreleasePool Wrapping the entire saveThisPhoto function in an NSAutoreleasePool Creating an NSAutoreleasePool when the camera pops up and calling the [pool release] when didReceiveMemoryWarning is called Closing the camera popup when didReceiveMemoryWarning is called, hoping it will clear the pool Every possibly combination of the above Yet everything I try, when I take photos I can see the Memory Utilized rising and not falling when I'm repeatedly taking photos on the device. Does anyone know how I can release the autorelease object created by UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext? Alternatively, is there an alternative way to make a UIImage out of an UIImageView? Edit: Here are the full functions as requested. There's a lot of extra releasing added in there just to try make sure everything is cleaned up. I have gone through and tested for the memory leak with each code block in saveThisPhoto systematically, and it only occurs when the UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext block (snippet above) is run. - (void)imagePickerController:(UIImagePickerController *)picker didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo:(NSDictionary *)info {

    NSLog(@"SAVING PHOTO");

    [self saveThisPhoto:info];

    picker = nil;
    [picker release];

    info = nil;
    [info release];

}

- (void)saveThisPhoto:(NSDictionary *)info {

    // Get photo count for filename so we're not overriding photos

    int photoCount = 0;

    if ([[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] objectForKey:@"photocount"]) {
        photoCount= [[[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] objectForKey:@"photocount"] intValue];
        photoCount++;
    }

    [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] setObject:[NSString stringWithFormat:@"%d", photoCount] forKey:@"photocount"];
    [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] synchronize];

    // Obtaining saving path

    NSArray *paths = NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSDocumentDirectory, NSUserDomainMask, YES);
    NSString *documentsDirectory = [paths objectAtIndex:0];
    NSString *fileName = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"ri_%d.jpg", photoCount];
    NSString *fileNameThumb = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"ri_%d_thumb.jpg", photoCount];
    NSString *imagePath = [documentsDirectory stringByAppendingPathComponent:fileName];
    NSString *imagePathThumb = [documentsDirectory stringByAppendingPathComponent:fileNameThumb];

    // Extracting image from the picker and saving it

    NSString *mediaType = [info objectForKey:UIImagePickerControllerMediaType];

    // SAVE TO IPAD AND DB

    if ([mediaType isEqualToString:@"public.image"]){

        // Get Image

        UIImage *editedImage = [info objectForKey:UIImagePickerControllerOriginalImage];

        // Figure out image orientation

        CGSize resizedSize;
        CGSize thumbSize;

        if (editedImage.size.height > editedImage.size.width) {
            resizedSize = CGSizeMake(480, 640);
            thumbSize = CGSizeMake(150, 200);

@LINK:/questions/19955348/how-do-i-parse-a-string-at-compile-time-in-nimrod
@TITLE:How do I parse a string at compile time in Nimrod?
@CONTENT:Going through the second part of Nimrod's tutorial I've reached the part were macros are explained. The documentation says they run at compile time, so I thought I could do some parsing of strings to create myself a domain specific language. However, there are no examples of how to do this, the debug macro example doesn't display how one deals with a string parameter. I want to convert code like: instantiate("""
    height,f,132.4
    weight,f,75.0
    age,i,25
    """)
 Kinto something which by hand I would write like: var height: float = 132.4
var weight: float = 75.0
var age: int = 25
 Obviously this example is not very useful, but I want to look at something simple (multiline/comma splitting, then transformation) which could help me implement something more complex. My issue here is how does the macro obtain the input string, parse it (at compile time!), and what kind of code can run at compile time (is it just a subset of a languaje? can I use macros/code from other imported modules)? EDIT: Based on the answer here's a possible code solution to the question: import macros, strutils

# Helper proc, macro inline lambdas don't seem to compile.
proc cleaner(x: var string) = x = x.strip()

macro declare(s: string): stmt =

    buf = ""

  for rawLine in rawLines:
    # Split the input line into three columns, stripped, and parse.
    var chunks = split(rawLine, ',')
    map(chunks, cleaner)

    if chunks.len != 3:

@TITLE:Behavior of stem(x) with complex x
@CONTENT:Trying to answer a recent question I've come across a strange behavior with stem. Try this: x = [1+j 2-j 3+j 4-j];
stem(x)
 On my Matlab version (2010b) this plots the imaginary part of x, not the real part as I expected. On the contrary, stem(1:length(x),x)
 plots the real part of x, which is consistent with the behavior of plot(1:length(x),x). Can you think of any reason why stem(x) plots the imaginary part of x instead of the real part? Specially when stem(1:length(x),x) does plot the real part. Or should we conclude it's a bug?
@CODE:stem x = [1+j 2-j 3+j 4-j];

@CONTENT:I am about to create a Desktop App (with .NET windows forms) Essentially, I want to create an n-tier app but I also want loose coupling between layers. However, I am not very sure if this is a good approach for windows forms And now I just wonder if it would be really a wise choice to use any IoC (StructureMap, Ninject, Spring.Net), I have used them before for Asp.Net web applications but what makes me doubt now is the fact that working with windows forms my business entities will persist when I navigate through tabs and unlike than web forms or mvc apps where it would be necesary to inject my business entity for every new request that is performed, I mean this because of the Asp.Net page life cycle where is performed the initialization and controls instantiation. This it is kind of a long-term development project, it combines maintenance tracking, inventory, work orders, and management reporting. I am currently working on a proposal for its architecture. Maybe I am misunderstanding the point of using an IoC, so please tell me what do you think would be a better choice? Any point of view would be appreciated.

 I have set the ReuseScope in the Configure method to ReuseScope.None which should close the connection on a per request basis I believe? What am I doing wrong here? public override void Configure(Container container)

 Edit After more diagnosis, it seems to happen when I refresh the page several times when I call this service method: public Warranty Get(Warranty request)
    {
        var warranty = new Warranty();
        if (request.Id != default(int))
        {
            warranty = Db.Id<Warranty>(request.Id);
            warranty.WarrantyOrder = ResolveService<WarrantyOrderService>().Get(new WarrantyOrder { WarrantyId = warranty.Id });
            warranty.WarrantyStatus = ResolveService<WarrantyStatusService>().Get(new WarrantyStatus { Id = warranty.StatusId });
            warranty.WarrantyNotes = ResolveService<WarrantyNoteService>().Get(new WarrantyNotes { WarrantyId = warranty.Id });
            warranty.WarrantyDialogues = ResolveService<WarrantyDialogueService>().Get(new WarrantyDialogues { WarrantyId = warranty.Id });
            warranty.WarrantyCredit = ResolveService<WarrantyCreditService>().Get(new WarrantyCredit { WarrantyId = warranty.Id });
            warranty.WarrantyPhotos = ResolveService<WarrantyPhotoService>().Get(new WarrantyPhotos { WarrantyReference = warranty.WarrantyReference });
            warranty.WarrantyReport = ResolveService<WarrantyReportService>().Get(new WarrantyReport { WarrantyId = warranty.Id });
        }

        return warranty;
    }
 I have changed ConfigureDb as per @mythz answer below:     private static void ConfigureDb(Container container)
    {
        var connectionString = ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["AppDb"].ConnectionString;
        container.Register<IDbConnectionFactory>(c => new OrmLiteConnectionFactory(connectionString, SqlServerDialect.Provider));
    }
 The service needs to call out other services to populate the other objects on my Warranty object, I'm not sure on how to improve this?

@LINK:/questions/19893633/filter-usage-in-shapeless-scala
@TITLE:Filter usage in shapeless, Scala
@CONTENT:It is easy to filter HList in shapeless by type: val hlist = 1 :: 2 :: "3" :: true :: false :: HNil
hlist.filter[Int]
 But how can I make my custom type filter? I want smth like that: for example I got list of some functions: def function1(s: String) = s.toInt
def function2(s: String) = s.toDouble
def function3(i: Int) = i.toDouble

val hflist = function1 _ :: function3 _ :: function2 _ :: HNil

hflist customFilter[String] //> function1 _ :: function2 _ :: HNil
 So after usage of this filter, list of functions from type String to some other type will be constructed. I had an idea to use map for this, but it was not successfull. EDITION More information about my comment: I tried to test this ideas in map: So if i got some lists (lets operate with hlist & hflist): object allFunction extends Poly1 {
  implicit def default[T, M] =
    at[T => M](t => { 
      object grabStringFunc extends skip {
        implicit def stringFunc[A] = at[T => A](_ :: HNil)
      }

      println(hflist flatMap grabStringFunc) //> here we should see result, list of functions 
 })

 hlist map allFunction
 //> result of this should be smth like (types)
 //> shapeless.::[Int => Double,shapeless.HNil]]
 //> shapeless.::[Int => Double,shapeless.HNil]]
 //> shapeless.::[String => Int,shapeless.::[String => Double,shapeless.HNil]] 
 //> shapeless.HNil
 //> shapeless.HNil
 Very interesting, why it compiles and works incorrect? As I think it is not works, cause object cant take type prameters in such a way...
@CODE:HList val hlist = 1 :: 2 :: "3" :: true :: false :: HNil
hlist.filter[Int] def function1(s: String) = s.toInt
def function2(s: String) = s.toDouble
def function3(i: Int) = i.toDouble

@LINK:/questions/19882831/javascript-parse-string-to-integer
@TITLE:Javascript parse string to integer
@CONTENT:Working over at codewars I was trying to solve this problem: In this kata we want to convert a string into an integer. The strings simply represent the numbers in words. Examples: "one" => 1 "twenty" => 20 "two hundred forty-six" => 246 "seven hundred eighty-three thousand nine hundred and nineteen" => 783919 ================================================================================== I came up with the code below to do this. On jsfiddle for you convience. A problem I've run into is 'seven hundred thousand' gives you 10700. I've spent a day looking around and trying to figure this out but am just flat stuck. The steps the program takes is: string becomes 'thousand hundred seven' - good first while loop finds 'thousand' and sets multiplier to 1000 - good second while loop finds 'hundred' but then the mult.exec(a[0]) if statement resolves to null. - damn So instead of the multiplier becoming 100000, the value becomes 100000, and we are doomed to get the wrong answer. While trying to debug this I tried creating the a array being used during the second loop in the while in jsfiddle. There it worked and equated to 'hundred' instead of null. Anyone know why this would happen? function parseInt(number) {

@TITLE:Core Data with iCloud design
@CONTENT:Im on iOS 7 and want to use core data with iCloud, this is working well, the issue I wanted some input on is the following. Some of my Core Data objects have related images/large text files which I was storing as files on the file system and just setting the url of these items as string properties. Now obviously this wont just work with iCloud Core Data sync because iCloud has no notion of these files. I was wondering if you had any suggestions on how to handle this? 1) I could store the image data and large text files as core data properties directly but it does not seem to be the best way to go 2) I could use iCloud to also store the documents and then somehow try to keep sync between the files in different iOS devices, but this could potentially get messy. 3) Some other solution. Any Suggestions? Regards Daniel

I unfortunately don't have Outlook 2013 installed on my computer so it's making it hard to test, but a screenshot from my client suggests that it looks like this - My code is available here - HTML version. I have no idea what more I can do to get rid of the gaps - I've set line-height for the tds and images to zero, I've set the images to display: block, I've set the tables to border 0, cellpadding and cellspacing zero, and border-collapse: collapse. What else can I do to fix it? Edited to add - I'm actually not sure if the gaps are between images or table rows. From the screenshot it actually looks like it might be the table rows.

@LINK:/questions/19853557/what-algorithm-approach-to-use-to-synchronize-multiple-video-players
@TITLE:What algorithm/approach to use to synchronize multiple video players
@CONTENT:Motivation: I am currently trying to synchronize two videos on two networked raspis. I tried live streaming from a desktop (http and udp) but each raspi still opened the stream with a noticeable delay. I next tried installing vlc on the raspi and synchronizing with the desktop vlc, but that did not work either. I tried using a shell script to launch omxplayer at near the same time on both raspis, and that failed too. Finally I used a C script to launch the two omxplayers at near identical times, which also failed. Ultimately, I don't think it is possible to control when omxplayer starts actually playing the video file. Current Progress: Therefore, now, I am modifying omxplayer's code to synchronize two omxplayers using sockets, but I want to know what approach something like vlc takes when synchronizing its video clients, so as to not reinvent the wheel. I could be wrong but I noticed, by looking at the verbose output and debug statements, that one player would lose time with respect to the other, such that as the video played, this difference would build up and after 2-3 minutes exceeded 200 ms. I find this extremely disturbing. It would mean that after 2 hours, the difference would be 60*200ms=12000ms or around 12s. I thought the precision of modern day computing would be more like that of an atomic clock, losing maybe 1s after 1000 hours of footage, hence why I thought it would be sufficient to merely synchronize the feeds once. Question: If the different players have to be synchronized constnatly, how does something like vlc do it? Does it wait until there is a noticeable delay and fast forward/rewind? Does it fast forward/rewind whenever there is any difference? Does rectifying this difference (ie. socket signals) itself cause further delays? Since moving to a distant time in the video takes longer than playing continuously, how does it predict how many seconds to fast forward/rewind? I hear a lot of people talking about ticks (not the insects), and about how the master vlc sends out ticks. However, what I don't understand is how those ticks are interpretted: do you momentarily pause all other players until the next tick, or do you modulate the speed of the video somehow (if that is even possible on the fly)? NOTE: I am not streaming the actual video files as they are all accessed remotely via NFS on each of the raspis.

@LINK:/questions/19846714/plotting-a-large-number-of-custom-functions-in-ggplot-in-r-using-stat-function
@TITLE:Plotting a large number of custom functions in ggplot in R using stat_function()
@CONTENT:The basic issue is that I'd like to figure out how to add a large number (1000) custom functions into the same figure in ggplot, using different values for the function coefficients. I have seen other questions about how to add two or three functions, but not 1000, and questions about adding in different functional forms, but not the same form with multiple values for the parameters... The goal is to have stat_function draw the lines over using parameters values stored in a data frame, but with no actual data for x. [The overall goal here is to show the large uncertainty in the model parameters of a non-linear regression from a small dataset, which translates into uncertainty associated with predictions from this data (which I'm trying to convince someone else is a bad idea). I often do this by plotting many lines built from the uncertainty in the model parameters, (a la Andrew Gelman's Multilevel Regression textbook).] As an example, here is the plot in the base R graphics. #The data
p.gap <- c(50,45,57,43,32,30,14,36,51)
p.ag <- c(43,24,52,46,28,17,7,18,29)
data <- as.data.frame(cbind(p.ag, p.gap))

#The model (using non-linear least squares regression):
fit.1.nls <- nls(formula=p.gap~beta1*p.ag^(beta2), start=list(beta1=5.065, beta2=0.6168))
summary(fit.1.nls)

#From the summary, I find the means and s.e's the two parameters, and develop their distributions:
beta1 <- rnorm(1000, 7.8945, 3.5689)
beta2 <- rnorm(1000, 0.4894, 0.1282)
coefs <- as.data.frame(cbind(beta1,beta2))

#This is the plot I want (using curve() and base R graphics):
plot(data$p.ag, data$p.gap, xlab="% agricultural land use",
     ylab="% of riparian buffer gap", xlim=c(0,130), ylim=c(0,130), pch=20, type="n")
for (i in 1:1000){curve(coefs[i,1]*x^(coefs[i,2]), add=T, col="grey")}
curve(coef(fit.1.nls)[[1]]*x^(coef(fit.1.nls)[[2]]), add=T, col="red")
points(data$p.ag, data$p.gap, pch=20)
 I can plot the mean model function with the data in ggplot: fit.mean <- function(x){7.8945*x^(0.4894)}
ggplot(data, aes(x=p.ag, y=p.gap)) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(0,100), "% ag land use") +
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,100), "% riparian buffer gap") +
  stat_function(fun=fit.mean, color="red") +
  geom_point()
 But nothing I do draws multiple lines in ggplot. I can't seem to find any help on drawing the parameter values from of functions on the ggplot website, or on this site, which are both usually very helpful. Does this violate enough plotting theory that no one dares do this? Any help is appreciated. Thank you!

@LINK:/questions/19841649/binding-wpf-datagrid-cell-background-colour-with-trigger
@TITLE:Binding WPF Datagrid cell background colour with trigger
@CONTENT:I want the background colour of a WPF datagrid cell to change colour when the contents have been modified. Each cell has behind it a ViewModel object which contains the following properties - Value, OriginalValue and Modified. When the user edits the cell contents, this automatically triggers the Amount property via data binding. This property setter then checks it against the original value and sets the boolean Modified property to true or false respectively, notifies the bindings for those properties to update. I have so far achieved a partial result with a Style on the ElementStyle property of the DataGridTextColumn as follows <Style x:Key="DataGridTextStyle" TargetType="{x:Type TextBlock}">
    <Style.Triggers>
        <DataTrigger Binding="{Binding Path=MyViewModel.Modified}" Value="True">
            <Setter Property="Background" Value="Yellow"/>
        </DataTrigger>
    </Style.Triggers>
</Style>
 This updates the text content background colour, but that is only a small area in the center of the cell. I want the entire cell to updates it's background colour, not just the textblock attribute. Can I modify the above trigger to search upwards in the visual tree to find a parent DataGridCell and set the Background property on that, rather than setting the background colour of the current textblock only?
@CODE:<Style x:Key="DataGridTextStyle" TargetType="{x:Type TextBlock}">

@CONTENT:UPDATE: Thanks Michal Gajdos for the solution, but would still like to know if there's a way to do this that is not specific to Jersey if anyone has any ideas.

    localPlayer.authenticateHandler = ^(UIViewController *viewController, NSError *error){
        if (viewController != nil) {
            NSLog(@"Player not authenticated.");
        } else if (localPlayer.isAuthenticated) {
            NSLog(@"Authentication successful.");
        } else {
            NSLog(@"Authentication failed. Error: %@.",error);
        }
    };
}
 Suppose that the user hasn't logged in yet, and cancels the authentication screen to play the game normally. There is a button for playing a multiplayer match in my game. If the user presses the button, it will attempt to search for other players by presenting a GKMatchmakerViewController instance. Since the player isn't logged in, the player will actually receive an error dialog saying that they aren't logged in. The dialog only has an OK button, which dismisses it. If the player insists on pressing this button, the same dialog will come. However, this is an odd behaviour. It would be more reasonable that if the player wants to play a multiplayer match but isn't logged in yet, the game will prompt the user to log in. The above code sets up a handler, so it really isn't what I'm looking for. However, I made a breakpoint and noticed that viewController is a GKHostedAuthenticateViewController instance. I figured that maybe I could create an instance of that class and present it, which should technically be equivalent to prompting the user to log in. However, Xcode doesn't seem to recognise that class when I write it. I'm under the impression that I'm not allowed to do this. How can I manually prompt the user to log in to Game Center?
@CODE:- (void)authenticateLocalPlayer {
    GKLocalPlayer *localPlayer = [GKLocalPlayer localPlayer];
    localPlayer.authenticateHandler = ^(UIViewController *viewController, NSError *error){
        if (viewController != nil) {
            NSLog(@"Player not authenticated.");
        } else if (localPlayer.isAuthenticated) {
            NSLog(@"Authentication successful.");
        } else {
            NSLog(@"Authentication failed. Error: %@.",error);
        }
    };
} GKMatchmakerViewController viewController GKHostedAuthenticateViewController authenticateHandler

@TITLE:Visual Studio Unit Test 32-bit and 64-bit
@CONTENT:I have a solution that has projects both with C++ and C++/CLI code, and a set of projects which unit test all of these, using the Microsoft Unit Test Framework. For the C++/CLI projects, the unit test projects are C# unit tests. What I currently have is a platform for 32- and 64-bit. Also, for each platform I have unit test projects set to 32- and 64-bit platforms to match. The issue I have is that when I switch to 32-bit vs. 64-bit I need to go to TEST > TEST SETTINGS > DEFAULT PROCESSOR ARCHITECTURE and flip from 32- and 64 as needed. If I don't, I get a warning from Visual Studio that a 64-bit image cannot run in a 32-bit process. This makes sense, but surely there is some way to automate this? Otherwise if I do a batch build on a build machine I will not have control of this and the unit tests will fail. Also I have tried to set the unit test projects to be AnyCPU but this fails with an error saying "An attempt was made to load a program with an incorrect format" Is there a better way perhaps?

@TITLE:How to populate a tree view based on a flat list with levels?
@CONTENT:I have a list of objects populated from a third-party project file. The way this file was designed is so each item is on a "level" of hierarchy. So the very first item is on level 0, all of its child items are on level 1, and so on. As an example:   1. Node 1     (Level 0)
  2. Node 1.1   (Level 1)
  3. Node 1.2   (Level 1)
  4. Node 1.3   (Level 1)
  5. Node 1.3.1 (Level 2)
  6. Node 1.4   (Level 1)
  7. Node 2     (Level 0)
  8. Node 2.1   (Level 1)
  9. Node 2.1.1 (Level 2)
 10. Node 3     (Level 0)
 This would produce a hierarchy like so: - Node 1
--- Node 1.1
--- Node 1.2
--- Node 1.3
----- Node 1.3.1
--- Node 1.4
- Node 2
--- Node 2.1
----- Node 2.1.1
- Node 3
 My issue is figuring out how to populate this structure into a VCL TTreeView based on these "Level" properties of each listed object. If I had designed this third-party file structure, I would have used a parent property instead of a level property. Objects in this list can be iterated like this: var
  I: TMyItem;
  N: TTreeNode;
begin
  for X := 0 to MyList.Count - 1 do begin
    I := MyList[X];
    //TMyItem has property "Level" which specifies hierarchy
    //  as well as "Title" property for the node's caption
    //How to create node based on Level?

    N.Data := I;
  end;  
end;
 Based on this structure, how do I populate this in a tree view?
@CODE:1. Node 1     (Level 0)
  2. Node 1.1   (Level 1)
  3. Node 1.2   (Level 1)
  4. Node 1.3   (Level 1)
  5. Node 1.3.1 (Level 2)
  6. Node 1.4   (Level 1)
  7. Node 2     (Level 0)
  8. Node 2.1   (Level 1)
  9. Node 2.1.1 (Level 2)
 10. Node 3     (Level 0) - Node 1
--- Node 1.1
--- Node 1.2
--- Node 1.3
----- Node 1.3.1
--- Node 1.4
- Node 2
--- Node 2.1
----- Node 2.1.1
- Node 3 TTreeView var
  I: TMyItem;
  N: TTreeNode;
begin
  for X := 0 to MyList.Count - 1 do begin
    I := MyList[X];
    //TMyItem has property "Level" which specifies hierarchy

 I am unable to understand where I am going wrong. Is there something wrong with the implementation or is there something wrong in my understanding about simulated annealing ? Please point out the error.. My rough idea about SA: Pick a random neighbor If neighbor improves your condition, move there, Else, move there with certain probability. The probability is such that initially bad moves are 'allowed' but they are 'prohibited' later on. Finally you will converge to your solution. I have found the set of local minima and global minima using brute force. Then I run SA. I was expecting that SA will atleast converge to a local minima but that doesn't seem to be the case always. Also, I am not sure if at every step I choose a neighbor randomly and then try to move or I choose the best neighbor ( even if none of the neighbors improve my condition) and then try to move there.

@CONTENT:I'm in the process of upgrading my website, and this involves the decision of using the new HTML5 semantic elements <nav> <header> <footer> <aside> <section> over regular old <div> elements. I do plan on supporting IE7 and IE8, but I know that these versions don't support the above semantic elements. I've read up about 'plugins' like Modernizr, Initializr and HTML5shiv, and I know that older browsers will then support the new elements IF JavaScript is enabled, but what am I supposed to do if it's not? By default, the <html> tag is given the class of no-js and if JavaScript is enabled, Modernizr/Initializr replaces this class with js. That's all well and good, but there are some things I'm uncertain about. So far, what is covered? Sorted IF JavaScript is enabled, IE7 and IE8 are supported by Modernizr/Initializr. With a reset.css file, other older browsers support these new tags. Modern browsers are all fine. Problems IF JavaScript is disabled, what am I supposed to do about IE8 and below? The no-js class is added to the <html> tag, so what exactly can I do with that? How can I use <noscript> to my advantage here? I don't want to make pages too large with coding. So, aside from those questions, I also want to ask if it's really worth using these tags, when I can just use good ol' <div> tags which would both support older browsers and also keep file sizes down by eliminating the required coding to make the new tags work in older browsers? Thank you, Dylan.

@TITLE:Does Capybara require sleep to work?
@CONTENT:Apparently, sleep or wait_until are not valid using recent versions of Capybara, according to the webpage updates. However, I have a set of tests that only work on fast machines if I add a sleep(1) call to the test. That is, a test that looks like: describe "dosimeters page" do
  before do
    click_link("Dosimeter Read History", :match=>:first)
  end
...
 becomes describe "dosimeters page" do
  before do
    unix_wait
    click_link("Dosimeter Read History", :match=>:first)
  end
...
 where I've defined unix_wait as: def unix_wait
  case RbConfig::CONFIG['host_os']
  when /darwin/
  when /linux-gnu/
    sleep(1)
  end
end
 The thing is, I have an old Ubuntu 12.04 quadcore laptop running these tests on Jenkins, and everything works well on it without the unix_wait calls. The tests failed randomly on a hexacore desktop running Ubuntu 13.10 and on a macbook pro laptop, but if I add in the unix_wait call, then the tests pass. The test failures themselves are indicative of loading failures (ie, css elements missing on some runs, but not on others), and the things being tested actually work when the site is loaded manually. So what's the appropriate action here? Apparently, sleep isn't allowed during testing, nor is wait_until. However, sleep is working, but it does seem extremely crude to me. Should I be looking at #synchronized? From what I gather from those blog posts, that's already getting called when I call click_link, and the tests are still failing. What is the accepted protocol here? I should add, because I think it's important: These are all javascript tests. I'm using capybara-webkit built on qt4 (not qt5). I'm considering switching to poltergeist or some other javascript driver as a debug step.

var newNode = await client.CreateWithLabel(new Task(), "Task");
 Exact error message is this: The 'await' operator can only be used within an async method. Consider marking this method with the 'async' modifier and changing its return type to 'Task' Am I doing something wrong or is it a language/compiler limitation?

 Do I need to modify my 'agg' backend to 'Qt4Agg' or something else? Does it need me to modify the rc file? Note: I checked my matplotlibrc file to have only backend : agg. Rest all parameters are commented. As per below comments, I tried installing libpng but facing the below error: pngfix.o: In function `zlib_reset':
/usr/lib/hue/libpng-1.6.6/contrib/tools/pngfix.c:2151: undefined reference to `inflateReset2'
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
 I have now successfully installed a stable and working duo of libpng-1.5.9/zlib-1.2.7 instead of the previous unstable versions libpng-1.6.6/zlib-1.2.8 and both the libs are successfully installed. But despite having a working and stable libpng, I can't open the png file being generated by the python code (given above). Is there any specific configuration setting for VMs to open .png files? How exactly can .png files be opened on Linux VMs running on WIndows host?

@TITLE:Converting XHTML table to LaTeX using XSLT
@CONTENT:I'm new in XSLT (v1.0) and I can't convert complex XHTML tables to LaTeX using XSLT. What I mean when I said complex tables, are tables with rows with different number of columns. In other words, td with colspan. i.e. (xhtml table) <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

        <td valign="top" width="68"> <p>180</p> <p> </p> </td>
    </tr>

 What I'm doing in the XSL file is: <xsl:template match="xhtml:table[@border='1']">

 But as you can see, this code just works for simple tables, without the colspan attribute. The code loops around the first tr, and for each td, it writes an "c". So, in the case above, it will only create a one column table. What I want to do is count the number of td, and the number of colspans if it exists, to create a correct table, with 3 columns. Does anyone knows how to do this? Thanks in advance.

@TITLE:How to create part of a rainbow gradient
@CONTENT:I need to generate a gradient bitmap that displays a rainbow gradient between two colors which are chosen by a user. To generate a rainbow is easy. The code below I got from Wiki and slightly adapted it. It has the advantage of being fast and simple.  function TColor_Dialog.GiveRainbowColor (fraction: double): TAlphaColor;
  var
    m: Double;
    r, g, b, mt: Byte;
  begin
    if fraction <= 0 then m := 0 else
    if fraction >= 1 then m := 6
                     else m := fraction * 6;
    mt := (round (frac (m) * $FF));
    case Trunc (m) of
    0: begin
        R := $FF;
        G := mt;
        B := 0;
      end;
    1: begin
        R := $FF - mt;
        G := $FF;
        B := 0;
      end;
    2: begin
        R := 0;
        G := $FF;
        B := mt;
      end;
    3: begin
        R := 0;
        G := $FF - mt;
        B := $FF;
      end;
    4: begin
        R := mt;
        G := 0;
        B := $FF;
      end;
    5: begin
        R := $FF;
        G := 0;
        B := $FF - mt;
      end;
    end; // case

    Result := ColorToQuad (r, g, b);
  end; // GiveRainbowColor //
 Trouble with this algorithm is it can't show a partial rainbow between two colors. Well, of course it can but than you have to approach the fraction of each color and I don't like that solution. I tried decomposing the color into its r, g, b channels but that did not work. The reason is quite obvious by hindsight. Suppose you need a gradient between FF0000 and 0000FF. You'll have a red color transforming from FF->00 and a blue from 00->FF. However, there is no green (00FF00) which is clearly present in a rainbow gradient. What I need is a gradient function that I can give two colors and a fraction and it generates a color. Can anyone point me to an article, algorithm or even code? Update NGLN's answer is the right answer for this question. Both he and Warren wondered what to do when a a color is not a bright color (a color containing a 0, a $FF and a value). I tried several angles: up/downscaling and HSL interpolation. I finally settled down for the last one as being the most simple. Basically you have two colors: from and to. Use RGBtoHSL to extract the HSL parameters from each color: RGBtoHSL (col_from, hf, sf, lf). Next compute the hue, saturation and luminance between both colors and reconstruct a new color. This is what NGLN mentions in his update about hue, but if you generalise this principle you have a rainbow between any color. function TColor_Dialog.interpolate_hsl (col_from, col_to: TAlphaColor; fraction: double): TAlphaColor;
  var af, at, ad: uInt8;
      hf, ht, hd: single;
      sf, st, sd: single;
      lf, lt, ld: single;
  begin
  // Get each rgb color channel
     af := GetAValue (col_from);
     at := GetAValue (col_to);
     RGBtoHSL (col_from, hf, sf, lf);
     RGBtoHSL (col_to,   ht, st, lt);

  // Compute differences
     ad := af + Round (fraction * (at - af));
     hd := hf + fraction * (ht - hf);
     sd := sf + fraction * (st - sf);
     ld := lf + fraction * (lt - lf);

     Result := MakeColor (HSLtoRGB (hd, sd, ld), ad);
  end; // interpolate_hsl //
 This gives a rainbow for all colors possible. I apply the same interpolation for the opacity, hence the use of MakeColor to 'fumble' the interpolated alpha channel into the color.
@CODE:function TColor_Dialog.GiveRainbowColor (fraction: double): TAlphaColor;
  var
    m: Double;
    r, g, b, mt: Byte;

@LINK:/questions/19692515/sleeping-barber-algorithm-with-multiple-barbers
@TITLE:Sleeping Barber algorithm (with multiple barbers)
@CONTENT:The Sleeping Barber Problem is a classical synchronization problem that many of you may be familiar with or at least heard of. It's based on the premise that a barber (a thread) sleeps when there are no customers (each customer is a thread) in the waiting room (which is a semaphore). If there is someone, he cuts his hair (symbolizing some processing) and the costumer leaves. If, then, there is no one in the waiting room, the barber goes to sleep. When another customer arrives, he then must wake up the barber. I have made a implementation of this using the following basic-idea (although the actual code is in C, I wrote the following pseudo-code without much care for the syntax for sake of problem-understading, only using sem_wait and sem_post1 for smoother reading) Semaphore Customers = 0;
Semaphore Barber = 0;
Mutex accessSeats = 1;
int NumberOfFreeSeats = N; 

Barber {
    while(1) {
        sem_wait(Customers); // waits for a customer (sleeps)
        sem_wait(accessSeats); // mutex to protect the number of available seats
        NumberOfFreeSeats++; // a chair gets free
        sem_post(Barber); // bring customer for haircut
        sem_post(accessSeats); // release the mutex on the chair
        // barber is cutting hair
    }
}

Customer {
    while(1) {
        sem_wait(accessSeats); // protects seats so only 1 thread tries to sit in a chair if that's the case
        if(NumberOfFreeSeats > 0) {
            NumberOfFreeSeats--; // sitting down
            sem_post(Customers); // notify the barber
            sem_post(accessSeats); // release the lock
            sem_wait(Barber); // wait in the waiting room if barber is busy
            // customer is having hair cut
        } else {
            sem_post(accessSeats); // release the lock
            // customer leaves
        }
   }
}
 However, now that I'll implement this problem with multiple barbers, my head got stuck. I went on Wikipedia to see if I could find something about it, but the only thing that I found there was this A multiple sleeping barbers problem has the additional complexity of coordinating several barbers among the waiting customers. and I couldn't figure this out by myself 2. What changes would I have to do in my code? Where would I need an extra semaphore here? 1sem_wait() locks the semaphore. sem_post() unlocks it 2Disclaimer: Although I have asked this in programmers.stackexchange aswell, I did not have reached a desired answer and my question still persists.
@CODE:C sem_wait sem_post Semaphore Customers = 0;
Semaphore Barber = 0;
Mutex accessSeats = 1;
int NumberOfFreeSeats = N; 

Barber {
    while(1) {
        sem_wait(Customers); // waits for a customer (sleeps)
        sem_wait(accessSeats); // mutex to protect the number of available seats
        NumberOfFreeSeats++; // a chair gets free
        sem_post(Barber); // bring customer for haircut
        sem_post(accessSeats); // release the mutex on the chair
        // barber is cutting hair
    }
}

Customer {
    while(1) {
        sem_wait(accessSeats); // protects seats so only 1 thread tries to sit in a chair if that's the case
        if(NumberOfFreeSeats > 0) {
            NumberOfFreeSeats--; // sitting down

@TITLE:Getting java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: javax.servlet.ServletContext in junit
@CONTENT:I'm using spring mvc in my application and I'm writing junit test cases for a DAO. But when I run the test, I get an error java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: javax.servlet.ServletContext. In the stacktrace, I see that this error is caused during getApplicationContext. In my applicationContext, I havent defined any servlet. Servlet mapping is done only in web.xml so I dont understand why I'm getting this error. Here is my applicationContext.xml: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: How to check programatically if an App is installed? 3 answers How can I determine if a user has an iOS app installed? 2 answers On iOS, you can launch the Facebook app and link to a profile by opening a url like this: fb://profile/12345 The only problem is that if the Facebook app isn't installed, nothing happens. Is there a way to detect if the app is installed or if the url scheme fb:// is supported? This would apply broadly to other apps like Twitter as well.

@TITLE:How do I set up my git repositories to easily be able to reuse projects in Visual Studio
@CONTENT:My problem may be best described with an example. Assume I have a project "A". I also have a project "B" which depends on "A". Another project "C" also depends on "A". My "main" project depends on "B" and "C". It may also be that it also depends directly on "A". Looks a bit like the "dreaded diamond of inheritance" when "main" == "D" These are my requirements: I'd like to be able to edit the content of projects "A", "B" and "C" in the solution for "main " and submit changes (i.e. I don't want just to include the DLL but also the code). But since "B" and "C" both depend on "A", it should be enforced that they reference the same commit. The projects "A", "B" and "C" will most likely also be referenced by other projects, so I cannot assume ownership of the working directory for project "main". Also it should be possible to sync the repositories for each project with external repositories. The projects "A", "B", "C" and "main" should be How do I need to set up my repositories to accomplish this?

@TITLE:Element.Click not executed when using PhantomJS selenium webdriver in .Net
@CONTENT:I am using our existing tool that works perfectly using the Firefox and Chrome implementations of the Selenium IWebdriver. I am now doing some experimentation using the PhantomJS implementation. So far so good. However, as soon as I want to click a button it does nothing. I can retrieve the element, however, looking closer at its properties the 'Selected' property states the following:     Error Message => 'Element is not selectable' caused by Request => {"headers":{"Accept":"application/json, image/png","Connection":"Close","Host":"localhost:37704"},"httpVersion":"1.1","method":"GET","url":"/selected","urlParsed":{"anchor":"","query":"","file":"selected","directory":"/","path":"/selected","relative":"/selected","port":"","host":"","password":"","user":"","userInfo":"","authority":"","protocol":"","source":"/selected","queryKey":{},"chunks":["selected"]},"urlOriginal":"/session/fcaf88a0-40b4-11e3-960d-bdce3224aacf/element/%3Awdc%3A1383063211142/selected"}
 I would gather this is the cause that my click is not executed, however, I cannot make heads or tails from this error message. using Google did not help either. Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance.

@LINK:/questions/19662525/how-dependency-property-tell-the-object-to-apply-to
@TITLE:How Dependency Property tell the object to apply to?
@CONTENT:(I am totally new to this concept so I may be asking very basic questions.) A dependency property is registered with the code below: public static DependencyProperty Register(string name, Type propertyType, Type ownerType, PropertyMetadata typeMetadata);
 Logically, it did nothing but associate a property name with the owner type. So if I have multiple instances of the owner type, and each instance set the DP to different values. How could these values be stored? Update 1 - 10:04 AM 10/30/2013 I read about the Attached Property from here: http://wpftutorial.net/DependencyProperties.html Attached Properties Attached properties are a special kind of DependencyProperties. They allow you to attach a value to an object that does not know anything about this value. A good example for this concept are layout panels. Each layout panel needs different data to align its child elements. The Canvas needs Top and Left, The DockPanel needs Dock, etc. Since you can write your own layout panel, the list is infinite. So you see, it's not possible to have all those properties on all WPF controls. The solution are attached properties. They are defined by the control that needs the data from another control in a specific context. For example an element that is aligned by a parent layout panel. So in the following code snippet: <Canvas>
    <Button Canvas.Top="20" Canvas.Left="20" Content="Click me!"/>
    <Button Canvas.Top="40" Canvas.Left="20" Content="Click me!"/>
</Canvas>
 Apparently we cannot give all the align properties such as Top, Left to Button. So Canvas defines such properties and they are "attached" to Button control. When Canvas.Top is specified as an "attribute" of the Button in XAML, it will invoke the SetTop() method which is defined in the Canvas type. And the Button is passed in as the element argument. I think that's how Canvas knows which Button use which Top value. public static void SetTop(UIElement element, double length);
 But I don't see why the Attached Property has to be a Dependency Property? What's the connection between them? Thanks!
@CODE:public static DependencyProperty Register(string name, Type propertyType, Type ownerType, PropertyMetadata typeMetadata); <Canvas>
    <Button Canvas.Top="20" Canvas.Left="20" Content="Click me!"/>
    <Button Canvas.Top="40" Canvas.Left="20" Content="Click me!"/>
</Canvas> public static void SetTop(UIElement element, double length); DependencyObject.GetValue DependencyObject.SetValue Canvas.SetTop(e, t) e.SetValue(Canvas.TopProperty, t)

@TITLE:How to include/inject functions which use $scope into a controller in angularjs?
@CONTENT:I am trying to include a library of functions, held in a factory, into a controller. Similar to questions like this: AngularJS - Common controller functions My main controller looks like this: recipeApp.controller('recipeController', function ($scope, groceryInterface, ...){

$scope.groceryList = [];
// ...etc...    

/* trying to retrieve the functions here */
$scope.groceryFunc = groceryInterface; // would call ng-click="groceryFunc.addToList()" in main view
    /* Also tried this:
    $scope.addToList = groceryInterface.addToList();
    $scope.clearList = groceryInterface.clearList();
    $scope.add = groceryInterface.add();
    $scope.addUp = groceryInterface.addUp(); */
}
 Then, in another .js file, I have created the factory groceryInterface. I've injected this factory into the controller above. Factory recipeApp.factory('groceryInterface', function(){

        var factory = {};

    factory.addToList = function(recipe){
        $scope.groceryList.push(recipe);
                    ... etc....
    }

    factory.clearList = function() {
            var last = $scope.prevIngredients.pop();
            .... etc...
    }

    factory.add = function() {
    $scope.ingredientsList[0].amount = $scope.ingredientsList[0].amount + 5;
    }

    factory.addUp = function(){
        etc...
    }

    return factory;
});
 But in my console I keep getting ReferenceError: $scope is not defined at Object.factory.addToList, etc. Obviously I'm guessing this has to do with the fact that I'm using $scope in my functions within the factory. How do I resolve this? I notice that in many other examples I've looked at, nobody ever uses $scope within their external factory functions. I've tried injecting $scope as a parameter in my factory, but that plain out did not work. (e.g. recipeApp.factory('groceryInterface', function(){ ) Any help is truly appreciated!
@CODE:recipeApp.controller('recipeController', function ($scope, groceryInterface, ...){

$scope.groceryList = [];
// ...etc...    

/* trying to retrieve the functions here */
$scope.groceryFunc = groceryInterface; // would call ng-click="groceryFunc.addToList()" in main view
    /* Also tried this:
    $scope.addToList = groceryInterface.addToList();
    $scope.clearList = groceryInterface.clearList();
    $scope.add = groceryInterface.add();
    $scope.addUp = groceryInterface.addUp(); */
} recipeApp.factory('groceryInterface', function(){

        var factory = {};

    factory.addToList = function(recipe){
        $scope.groceryList.push(recipe);
                    ... etc....
    }

    factory.clearList = function() {
            var last = $scope.prevIngredients.pop();
            .... etc...
    }

    factory.add = function() {
    $scope.ingredientsList[0].amount = $scope.ingredientsList[0].amount + 5;
    }

    factory.addUp = function(){
        etc...
    }

    return factory;
}); ReferenceError: $scope is not defined at Object.factory.addToList $scope $scope $scope recipeApp.factory('groceryInterface', function(){

 The problem happens when Table2 is null, so, the query returns nothing. How do I leave the last part of the query AND Table2.IsDefault = 1 optional? I've tried to short circuit the query using OR but I've found out that it works different than C#

@TITLE:The given key was not present in the dictionary. when adding Association to Entities
@CONTENT:Using EF6 / VS 2013, I have created an ADO.NET Entity Data Model. This model uses three views, stored in SQL Server, to prepare the data in a suitable form from an existing system. One for Users (vw_Users), one for Roles (vw_Roles) and a cross-reference/association view (vw_UserRoles). When the User and Role entities are mapped, the application compiles and executes without issue. However, when I add the Association between User and Role and map it to the vw_UserRoles view, I get an EntityCommandCompilationException with an inner exception, KeyNotFoundException {"The given key was not present in the dictionary."}. An exception of type 'System.Data.Entity.Core.EntityCommandCompilationException' occurred in mscorlib.dll but was not handled in user code
Additional information: An error occurred while preparing the command definition. See the inner exception for details.
 To me it just feels like a bug but I am new to a lot of the EF and it could be to do with connecting to views. Out of interest I implemented this trick to treat the view as a table but it made no difference. UPDATE #1: I created a new web application with a new SQL Server database. I created the underlying tables with relationships and a view for each table. When I create a entity model based on the tables, I have no problems -- even with the association. When I created a model from the views, I get the KeyNotFoundException. Note: I have corrected the keys and added and mapped the association on the second, view-based model. You can download the project from here - http://sdrv.ms/1eZ7ytp UPDATE #2: I have logged this as an issue with MS @ Codeplex - https://entityframework.codeplex.com/workitem/1777 I'm still stumped on this one and am really keen to complete this using a series of views. Any thoughts? Please....? Full Exception: System.Data.Entity.Core.EntityCommandCompilationException was unhandled by user code

@TITLE:Error sideloading JSON for act-as-taggable tags using active-model-serializers
@CONTENT:In a Ruby 2/Rails 4 app, I am trying to use acts-as-taggable-on in conjunction with active_model_serializers in order to create a JSON API that would output my tags along with other model parameters. First some background/motivation for this issue: The JSON is being fed into ember/ember-data, which as of the time of this writing has removed support for embedded records in JSON. There is a supposed fix in the documentation about this, but I find it clumsy and also haven't actually gotten it to work. Since I'm an Ember newbie and am a little more comfortable with Rails, I figure I'll try to solve the problem another way, by sideloading the tag record alongside the document record. I like this solution better because it makes more sense for my application, but I can't get this to work either. Here's an example: Let's say I have a Document model that is using acts-as-taggable-on: class Document < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_taggable
  # other code omitted
 I've set up the database with one document with one tag. Now we consider the following cases: 1. Full Object Embed: With the following serializer: class DocumentSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :id
  has_many :tags
 My JSON has the following format (using Rails 4 UUIDs): {
  "documents": [
    {
      "id": "c41460fa-2427-11e3-8702-0800270f33f4",
      "tags": [
        {
          "id": "a33fc396-2428-11e3-8eeb-0800270f33f4",
          "name": "test"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
 2. ID Embed: Using the serializer class DocumentSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :id
  has_many :tags, embed: :id
 My JSON now looks like: {
  "documents": [
    {
      "id": "c41460fa-2427-11e3-8702-0800270f33f4",
      "tag_ids": [
        "a33fc396-2428-11e3-8eeb-0800270f33f4"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
 3. ID Embed with Tags Sideloaded: According to active_model_serializers documentation, I should be able to do class DocumentSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :id
  has_many :tags, embed: :id, include: true
 but this doesn't work. Instead, I get a NoMethodError: undefined method `object' for #<ActsAsTaggableOn::Tag:0x007f258cf1db38>
 I've tried searching for this problem but haven't found anything useful so far. I also couldn't find any documentation on either gem regarding usage with the other gem. My suspicion right now that it has something to do with how acts-as-taggable-on is implemented, that it's not a straightforward has_many relationship? Is anybody able to offer some input on this issue? Thanks in advance!
@CODE:class Document < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_taggable
  # other code omitted class DocumentSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer

 END EDIT I next want to create all possible combinations of each row versus every other (grouped by chr). This would form a query(join) onto some other data so I'm thinking best (and simplest) to precompute : # grouped by chr column
bedbin.dt = group_by(bedbin.dt, chr)

# an outer like function
outerFun= function(dt)
  {
   unique(data.table(
    x=dt[rep(1:nrow(dt),each =nrow(dt)),],
    y=dt[rep.int(1:nrow(dt),times=nrow(dt)),]))
  }

> system.time((outer.bedbin.dt = do(bedbin.dt, outerFun1)))
   user  system elapsed 
 90.607  13.993 105.536
 To my mind this is sloooowwww...although relatively compared to using data.frame, or base functions like by() or lapply() it is quite a lot quicker. However this is actually a smallish dataset I am testing it on. So... I'm wondering if anyone has any ideas about a faster version of outerFun??? Is there a faster way than rep() or rep.int()?

@TITLE:R SSH Tunnel MySQL
@CONTENT:I'm looking for a way that will allow me to use an SSH Tunnel to connect to a MySQL Server (as opposed to a file) within R; I'm assuming it'll require a combination of RCurl and RODBC, but I can't seem to get it to work properly. I came across this post and this post that talk about utilizing SSH to connect to specific files or tables, but I'm hoping to use it as part of a Shiny app that will execute different SQL queries based on input from the user, which would require connecting into the server as opposed to specific files. I'm assuming the code would look something along these lines x = scp("remote.ssh.host.com", "/home/dir/file.txt", "My.SCP.Passphrase", user="username"), but would I replace the "/home/dir/file.txt" piece with an odbcConnect() statement or replace it with the port number for the specific database I want to access? Edit: The line I use for a regular odbcConnect() is odbcConnect(dsn, uid = "userid", pwd = "password"). Part of the problem is, I am developing it on Windows, but it will be deployed to a Linux server (handled be someone else) so I'm struggling to figure out what exactly will need to be used in my server.R code for connecting to the database.
@CODE:x = scp("remote.ssh.host.com", "/home/dir/file.txt", "My.SCP.Passphrase", user="username") "/home/dir/file.txt" odbcConnect() odbcConnect(dsn, uid = "userid", pwd = "password")

@TITLE:Alternative to nesting enums
@CONTENT:I'm trying to create several enums as such, that gives the syntax of Dropdown.Category.Subcategory. However, I have been reading that this isn't such a good idea. My choice for this was mostly because I couldn't think of any other way to select different enum values depending on the choice of the category, and then the choice of the subcategory is subject to the selected enum based on the enum values. Is there a better way to create such functionality? I would prefer to be able to easily identify both the .Category and .Subcategory names, and it would be a bonus if this code was readable. Just to make it clear, I want to be able to choose the Category, then have an appropriate Subcategory selection. public class Dropdown

@TITLE:Non virtual destructor in base class, but virtual destructor in derived class cause segmentation fault
@CONTENT:recently in a job interview I was asked about the problem of leaking memory in derived classes when the base class's destructor is not declared virtual. I wrote a small test to confirm my answer, but I found something interesting. Obviously, if you create a Derived object via new but store its pointer as a Base*, the derived object's destructor won't be called, if the pointer is deleted (so much for my answer to the question). I thought whether the derived class's destructor is virtual or not is irelevant in that case, but on my system the following code shows otherwise: #include <iostream>
#include <string>

// just a helper class, printing its name out when it is destructed
class PrintOnDestruct
{
    public:
        PrintOnDestruct( const std::string& name )
        : name_( name )
        {}

        ~PrintOnDestruct()
        {
            std::cout << "Destructing: " << name_ << std::endl;
        }

    protected:

        std::string name_;
};

// the Base class
class Base
{
    public:
        Base()
        {
            print_on_destruct_ = new PrintOnDestruct( "Base" );
        }

        // the destructor is NOT virtual!
        ~Base()
        {
            delete print_on_destruct_;
        }

    protected:

        PrintOnDestruct* print_on_destruct_;

};

// the NonVirtualDerived class, doesn't have a virtual destructor either
class NonVirtualDerived : public Base
{
    public:
        NonVirtualDerived()
        : Base()
        {
            print_on_destruct_child_ = new PrintOnDestruct( "NonVirtualDerived" );
        }

        // the destructor is NOT virtual!
        ~NonVirtualDerived()
        {
            delete print_on_destruct_child_;
        }

    protected:

        PrintOnDestruct* print_on_destruct_child_;

};

// the VirtualDerived class does have a virtual destructor 
class VirtualDerived : public Base

{
    // create the two child classes
    Base* non_virtual_derived = new NonVirtualDerived;
    Base* virtual_derived = new VirtualDerived;

    // delete the two objects
    delete non_virtual_derived; // works as expected (only calls Base's destructor, the memory of NonVirtualDerived will be leaked)
    delete virtual_derived; // segfault, after calling Base's destructor

    return 0;
}
 I would have expected the program to output the following two lines and quit normally: Destructing: Base
Destructing: Base
 I get that output, but immediately after the second line the program quits with a segmentation fault. And the message: *** Error in `...': free(): invalid pointer: 0x00000000006020e8 ***
 I've changed the order of the two calls to delete, but the programm would always segfault in the call to delete virtual_derived;. Can anybody tell me why this is so?

@TITLE:NuGet packages not copied from referenced project
@CONTENT:I have a very strange error I have no explanation for. So my setup is very simple: I have a solution with 2 projects, let's name them ProjectA and ProjectB. ProjectA references some NuGet packages and if I build ProjectA, I can see all assemblies in the output directory, the bin folder. ProjectB now references ProjectA, but if I build ProjectB, I have the ProjectA assembly in the output directory, but not the NuGet packages referenced from ProjectA. The reference from ProjectB to ProjectA is added with References -> Add Reference... -> Solution -> ProjectA. I also created a little test project covering this case, but it works just fine in my test project. Any ideas?

@TITLE:Reading specific rows of large matrix data file
@CONTENT:Suppose I have a gigantic m*n matrix X (that is too big to read into memory) and binary numeric vector V with length m. My objective is to read the rows of X that correspond to V equalling 1 (and not those corresponding to V[i] == 0) into a dedicated data table/matrix through a package such as (but not necessarily identical to) bigmemory or ff. only for the rows corresponding to V[i] == 1. This can be done by hacking nrows and skip and so on in read.table but I'm looking for a bigmemory, ff et al. type solution due to insufficient RAM. Here's a MWE that does not reflect the true size of my X. X <- array(rnorm(100*5),dim=c(100,5))
write.csv(X,"target.csv")
V <- sample(c(rep(1,50),rep(0,50))) #Only want to read in half the rows corresponding to 1's
rm(X)

#Now ... How to read "target.csv"?

@TITLE:Equivalent of C++'s reinterpret_cast in C#
@CONTENT:I wonder what's the equivalent of C++'s reinterpret_cast in C#!? Here's my sample: class Base
{
    protected int counter = 0;
}

class Foo : Base
{
    public int Counter
    {
        get { return counter; }
    }
}

Base b = new Base();
Foo f = b as Foo; // f will be null
 I've got no objection why f will be null since it should be. But if it was C++ I could have wrote Foo f = reinterpret_cast<Foo>(b); and get what I wanted. What can I do to achieve the same in C#? PS. I'm assuming that Base and Foo are consistent data-wise. [UPDATE] Here's a simple scenario where a reinterpret_cast could be helpful: Consider writing a XXX-RPC library where you've got no control over the incoming parameters nor the signature of services to call. Your library is supposed to call the asked service with the given parameters. If C# supported reinterpret_cast I could simply reinterpret_cast the given parameters into the expected ones and call the service.
@CODE:reinterpret_cast class Base
{
    protected int counter = 0;
}

class Foo : Base
{
    public int Counter
    {
        get { return counter; }
    }
}

Base b = new Base();
Foo f = b as Foo; // f will be null f Foo f = reinterpret_cast<Foo>(b); Base Foo reinterpret_cast reinterpret_cast reinterpret_cast C# C++ reinterpret_cast

@TITLE:Mysterious malloc: sysmalloc: Assertion failed error
@CONTENT:I am getting a mysterious error and I have no idea why. This code runs several times before failing, and it always fails at the same point. Here is my code:     assert(size > 0);
    int* sorted = malloc(size * sizeof(int));
 And here is the error I am getting when I run it:     malloc.c:2369: sysmalloc: Assertion `(old_top == (((mbinptr) (((char *) &((av)->bins[((1) - 1) * 2])) - __builtin_offsetof (struct malloc_chunk, fd)))) && old_size == 0) || ((unsigned long) (old_size) >= (unsigned long)((((__builtin_offsetof (struct malloc_chunk, fd_nextsize))+((2 * (sizeof(size_t))) - 1)) & ~((2 * (sizeof(size_t))) - 1))) && ((old_top)->size & 0x1) && ((unsigned long)old_end & pagemask) == 0)' failed.
 I have tried printing out size and it is 1 in this case. This code runs several times with varying values of size, including 1, before failing. Does anyone have any idea what I am doing wrong? Thanks.

@TITLE:matplotlib - How to plot a random-oriented rectangle (or any shape)?
@CONTENT:I wish to draw a line whose width is specified in the data unit. In this case, simply doing plot(x, y, linewidth=1)
 would fail, as the linewidth there is NOT specified in data unit. To do this, I find fill_between(), but I find all the examples given here are of the format fill_between(x, y1, y2)
 which means, the x is always shared by y1 and y2. So what if y1 and y2 don't share the same x? e.g. I wish to fill between line1=[(0, 0), (2, 2)] and line2=[(-1, 1), (1, 3)] (essentially, they form a rectangle). In this case, I want something like fill_between(x1, x2, y1, y2)
 Apparently, it is not working as desired: In [132]: x1 = [0,2]
   .....: x2 = [-1, 1]
   .....: y1 = [0,2]
   .....: y2 = [1,3]
   .....: fill_between(x1, x2, y1, y2)
   .....: 
Out[132]: <matplotlib.collections.PolyCollection at 0x3e5b230>
 How should I plot in this case?
@CODE:plot(x, y, linewidth=1) linewidth fill_between() fill_between(x, y1, y2) x y1 y2 y1 y2 x line1=[(0, 0), (2, 2)] line2=[(-1, 1), (1, 3)] fill_between(x1, x2, y1, y2) In [132]: x1 = [0,2]
   .....: x2 = [-1, 1]
   .....: y1 = [0,2]
   .....: y2 = [1,3]
   .....: fill_between(x1, x2, y1, y2)

@CONTENT:I want to start an external program out of my QT-Programm. The only working solution was: system("start explorer.exe");
 But it is only working for windows and starts a command line for a moment. Next thing I tried was: QProcess process;

process.start(file);
//process.execute(file); //i tried as well
 But nothing happened. Any ideas?

@TITLE:How to convert (OS_dispatch_data *) 5018112 bytes into NSData to put into UIImage
@CONTENT:I've been looking for an answer to this and some seem like they might be what I need but I'm not sure. I found this Question #9152851 and this Question #2617625 and poked around on a bunch of links but I need some direction here. Essentially, I'm dispatching an async call to process an image using OpenCV. You can see by the code here that I'm turning it into NSData * before sending it back to my delegate. NSData *proccessedData = [NSData dataWithBytes:processedImage.data length:(processedImage.rows * processedImage.cols)];        
[self.delegate onProcessedBitmapReady:proccessedData withFocusQuality:focusQuality];
 But when I get back to my delegate, my processedBitmap is of type (OS_dispatch_data *) and contains a value of bytes. So, when I try to set the UIImage, it gets set to null. - (void)onProcessedBitmapReady:(NSData *)processedBitmap withFocusQuality:(double)focusQuality
{
    //Use comverted image from self.captureCommand onComplete
    UIImage *image = [[UIImage alloc] initWithData:processedBitmap];
    [self saveImage:image];
}
 Here is a screen capture of the values: So, how do I convert those bytes (or whatever they are) into something that I can stuff into a UIImage? Thank you in advance for your help. ------------------------------------------------------- Adding a new image ----------------------------------------- Does this new image help? Thank you.
@CODE:NSData *proccessedData = [NSData dataWithBytes:processedImage.data length:(processedImage.rows * processedImage.cols)];

{
    //Use comverted image from self.captureCommand onComplete
    UIImage *image = [[UIImage alloc] initWithData:processedBitmap];
    [self saveImage:image];

@TITLE:Is cons a method or a class?
@CONTENT:Marting Odersky in his book writes: Class ::, pronounced cons for construct, represents non-empty lists. and The list construction methods :: and ::: are special. Because they end in a colon, they are bound to their right operand. That is, an operation such as x :: xs is treated as the method call xs.::(x), not x.::(xs). In fact, x.::(xs) would not make sense, as x is of the list element type, which can be arbitrary, so we cannot assume that this type would have a :: method. For this reason, the :: method should take an element value and yield a new list So is :: a method or a class?

@LINK:/questions/19404969/angular-data-binding-input-type-number
@TITLE:Angular Data Binding - Input type=number
@CONTENT:I'm having problems binding a number value using AngularJS. I've put a simplified example on JSFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/treerock/ZvdXp/ <div ng-controller="MyCont" ng-app>  
    <input type="number" min="0" max="50" value="{{value}}" ng-model="value" />    
    <input type="text" value="{{value}}" ng-model="value" />
    <input type="range" min="0" max="50" value="{{value}}" ng-model="value" />    
    {{value}}   
</div>
 This should be three different types of input fields, and if you update one, then all values should update. That's working except for the number input. e.g. If I type 20 in the first number box, it updates all other instances of value. But if I update the text or range inputs, the number input goes blank. I was wondering if the issue was with how the number is represented/converted between fields. e.g. the number input is a float and the text input is a string?
@CODE:<div ng-controller="MyCont" ng-app>  
    <input type="number" min="0" max="50" value="{{value}}" ng-model="value" />    
    <input type="text" value="{{value}}" ng-model="value" />
    <input type="range" min="0" max="50" value="{{value}}" ng-model="value" />    
    {{value}}

@TITLE:YouTube Embed player in Iframe doesn't work in iOS6
@CONTENT:I really need your help. Working on an iOS app. I want to play youtube. I understood from reading many many blogs and posts, that we need to use an iframe in order to play a youtube video. However, on some videos I get: "This video contains content from XYZ. It is restricted from playback on certain sites. Watch on YouTube" I read this question: Youtube in iOS5 - done button Tapped which gives the link to youtube api: https://developers.google.com/youtube/player_parameters They recommend to use the iframe. the example for youtube site is: <iframe id="ytplayer" type="text/html" width="640" height="390"

Any chance I can use non QObjects s (aka POCO, not derived from QObject, but registered with Qt metasystem)? If not, is there a simple generic wrapping system to make my objects QML compliant. One I can think of is to add dynamic properties to a simple QObject. Or is there a way to implicitly convert to a QML compliant type so I do not need to wrap at all?

When the user taps on this button the app should move an UIView (actually inside an UITableViewCell) and move it within this rectangle, BUT the original UIView should stay in the same place.

@CONTENT:I was reading this article: http://danielribeiro.org/yes-you-can-have-low-coupling-in-a-symfony-standard-edition-application/ The author mentioned that it's possible to have this kind of artitcture for the project: src/
|ww Vendor/
    |ww Product/
        |ww Bundle
            |ww BlogBundle/
            |ww ForumBundle/

        |ww Repository
            |ww UserRepository.php
        |ww Service
            |ww UserPasswordRetrievalService.php
 so i followed the article and end up with something like this: src/
|ww Product/
    |ww Bundle
        |ww SiteBundle/
            |ww Controller/
                |ww IndexController.php

            |ww ProductSiteBundle.php
    |ww Entity
        |ww User.php
 Now Symfony can't see my User.php the author didn't mention if i have to add any extra code to make this works, and now i'm getting this error: MappingException: The class 'Product\Entity\User' was not found in the chain configured namespaces OtherNameSpaces
 UPDATE So i deleted my existing code. and Did something like this: src/
|ww Product/
    |ww Bundle
        |ww SiteBundle/
            |ww Controller/
                |ww IndexController.php

                |ww views/
                    |ww index.html.twig
            |ww ProductSiteBundle.php

 User.php namespace Product\Entity;

    protected $id;

    public function __construct()
    {
        parent::__construct();

    }
}
 and then php app/console doctrine:schema:update --force //No Metadata Classes to process.
 it seems Symfony is not aware of that folder at all. is there any place where i can ask symfony to look inside that folder ?

@CONTENT:I can't figure out how to delete all contents of a directory. For cleaning out a directory, I want to remove all files and directories inside it: I want to wipe everything there is inside (files and directories). I tried this with the delete task, but I can't figure out to make it also remove directories and not just files. I've tried different ways to specify the directories, but nothing works. task deleteGraphicsAssets(type:Delete) {
    delete fileTree('src').include('**/*')
}
 . task deleteGraphicsAssets(type:Delete) {
    delete fileTree('src').include('/')
}
 . task deleteGraphicsAssets(type:Delete) {
    delete fileTree('src').include('*')
}
 Any help appreciated! Edit: This works - yet it seems a bit like a hack. task deleteGraphicsAssets(type: Delete) {
    def dirName = "src"
    delete dirName

    doLast {
        file(dirName).mkdirs()
    }
}
 I was looking for something like: task deleteGraphicsAssets(type: Delete) {
    deleteContentsOfDirectory "src"
}
 or task deleteGraphicsAssets(type: Delete) {
    delete {dir : "src", keepRoot : true }
}
@CODE:task deleteGraphicsAssets(type:Delete) {

@TITLE:Android/PhoneGap: Using third-party libraries in plugin-development
@CONTENT:I'm working on a PhoneGap/Cordova plugin that's supposed to provide a socket for sending and receiving OSC messages (Open Sound Control). For that purpose I'd like to use JavaOSC but I'm uncertain about how to include the library into my project. I'm using Android Studio and I've basically followed this tutorial to set up my project. First I placed the raw JavaOSC class-files in the same directory as my OSCPlugin.class and placed the import declarations at the to of my OSCPlugin.class: import com.illposed.osc;
 That didn't work. As a next step I tried to add the library from maven within the project's module settings. I was able to download the jar files from maven and install put them into /platforms/android/libs. Within the settings for the module 'android' I can see that 'Android API 17' is supposed to be used as SDK, including cordova-3.1.0 and com.illposed.osc:javaosc-core:0.2 - both activated. I can see the cordova-3.1.0.jar as well as javaosc-core-0.2.jar, containing com.illposed.osc in the navigator within Android Studio. However, when trying to compile my project I get: Gradle: cannot find symbol class osc
 triggered from within OSCPlugin.class that contains the above mentioned import declaration I have very little experience with Java and even less with Android development. But I'd be interested in solving this riddle and get started. I have searched the Java docs but the problem doesn't merely lie within Java but rather within the structure of the Android project. I'd be thankful if someone could shed some light on this issue. Any hint's highly appreciated!

@LINK:/questions/19270741/how-to-do-simple-facebook-status-post-with-text-and-picture
@TITLE:How to do simple Facebook status post with text and picture
@CONTENT:I'm using the JavaScript API. I can do a simple text post with no problem: var params = {};
params['message'] = 'The text';
FB.api("me/feed", 'post', params, function(response) {
   if (!response || response.error)
      alert(response.error.message);
   else
      alert('Post ID: ' + response.id);
});
 Adding a picture with: params['picture'] = "http://mysite.com/link-to-picture";
params['type'] = "photo";
...
 Posts a link-type status with a garbled link, using the picture as a thumbnail. If I use "my/photos", it works fine the first time: var params = {};
params['message'] = 'The text';
params['url'] = "http://mysite.com/link-to-picture";
FB.api("me/photos", 'post', params, function(response) {
   if (!response || response.error)
      alert(response.error.message);
   else
      alert('Post ID: ' + response.id);
});
 But then if I do another post I lose the first post item from my feed, and get an album type presentation in the feed with the text from the second post, and both (unrelated) pictures The only way I have been able to get distinct status posts with their own text and picture is by first creating a serial numbered album, and then posting the picture to that. var aparams = {};
aparams['name'] = "post"+postid;
aparams['message'] = "album for post "+postid;
FB.api("me/albums", 'post', aparams, function(response) {
  if (!response || response.error)
  {
     alert("Creating album: "+response.error.message);
  }
  else
  {
     alert('Album ID: ' + response.id);
     var aid = response.id;
     params['url'] = "http://mysite.com/link-to-picture";
     FB.api(aid+"/photos", 'post', params, function(response) {
        if (!response || response.error)
           alert("Posting photo: "+response.error.message);
        else
           alert('Post ID: ' + response.id);
     });
  }
});
 That can't be the right way to do it - creating a mass of single picture albums! I notice that I have by default a 'Timeline Photos' album, so I could get its ID, then upload the picture to that. But then how would I do the FB.api("my/feed" ...) post with just the text and refer to the picture. I can't find anything like that in the documentation. My requirement seems to me to be very basic. Has anyone been able to get it right?
@CODE:var params = {};
params['message'] = 'The text';
FB.api("me/feed", 'post', params, function(response) {
   if (!response || response.error)
      alert(response.error.message);
   else
      alert('Post ID: ' + response.id);
}); params['picture'] = "http://mysite.com/link-to-picture";
params['type'] = "photo";
... var params = {};
params['message'] = 'The text';
params['url'] = "http://mysite.com/link-to-picture";
FB.api("me/photos", 'post', params, function(response) {
   if (!response || response.error)
      alert(response.error.message);
   else
      alert('Post ID: ' + response.id);
}); var aparams = {};
aparams['name'] = "post"+postid;
aparams['message'] = "album for post "+postid;
FB.api("me/albums", 'post', aparams, function(response) {
  if (!response || response.error)
  {
     alert("Creating album: "+response.error.message);
  }
  else
  {
     alert('Album ID: ' + response.id);
     var aid = response.id;
     params['url'] = "http://mysite.com/link-to-picture";
     FB.api(aid+"/photos", 'post', params, function(response) {
        if (!response || response.error)
           alert("Posting photo: "+response.error.message);
        else
           alert('Post ID: ' + response.id);

@TITLE:How to achieve smooth expand/ collapse animation
@CONTENT:I'm referring the expand / collapse animation code found at here. Android: Expand/collapse animation Although it works, it doesn't done the job well. The animation isn't smooth. I do some logging in the code. public static void expand(final View v) {
    v.measure(MeasureSpec.makeMeasureSpec(((View)v.getParent()).getWidth(), MeasureSpec.EXACTLY), MeasureSpec.makeMeasureSpec(1024, MeasureSpec.AT_MOST));
    final int targtetHeight = v.getMeasuredHeight();

    v.getLayoutParams().height = 0;
    v.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);

    {
        @Override
        protected void applyTransformation(float interpolatedTime, Transformation t) {
            v.getLayoutParams().height = interpolatedTime == 1
                    ? LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT
                    : (int)(targtetHeight * interpolatedTime);
            Log.i("CHEOK", "E v.getLayoutParams().height = " + v.getLayoutParams().height);
            v.requestLayout();
        }
 The following log message is printed. 10-09 12:29:58.808: I/CHEOK(7874): E v.getLayoutParams().height = 0

 New height occur every ~20ms. So, the FPS of the animation is around 50fps Of course, I can't just remove requestLayout, as UI won't updated on screen. I was wondering, is there any improvement can be done, to achieve animation FPS closed to 50fps? I had seen some commercial product with smooth Expand/collapse example. So, I think this is something achievable. Just that, I'm not sure exactly how. My layout code is as followed :         <LinearLayout

 I wish to perform smooth animation on chart_description_text_view from Collapsing (During app startup) Expanding (When user taps on it) One of the "role models" I can think of is https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.bitspin.timely.

@TITLE:Node.js Deployment in openshift
@CONTENT:I was trying to deploy a Node.js application to the openshift as in this link here I understand this code var http = require('http');

var server = http.createServer(function(req, res) {
    res.writeHead(200);
    res.end('Hello Http');
});
server.listen(3000);
 and there is no issue running it locally $ node server.js // saved as server.js
 However, how does this work when I commit this application in openshift? This is very simple code. I have some downloaded code that is a chat application and client-server need to configure to listen on some port (I was using port number 3000 in my localhost). It works on port number 3000 in localhost but how can I make it to work in Openshift?

@TITLE:Pandas interpolate data with units
@CONTENT:Hi Everyone, I've been looking to Stackoverflow for couple of years, and it helped me a lot, so much that I never have to register before :) But today I'm stuck on a problem using Python with Pandas and Quantities (could be unum or pint as well). I try to do my best to make a clear post, but since it's my first one, I apologize if something is confusing and will try to correct any mistake you'll find :) I want to import data from a source and build a Pandas dataframe as follow: import pandas as pd
import quantities as pq

depth = [0.0,1.1,2.0] * pq.m
depth2 = [0,1,1.1,1.5,2] * pq.m

s1 = pd.DataFrame(
        {'depth' : [x for x in depth]},
        index = depth)
 This gives: S1=
     depth
0.0  0.0 m
1.1  1.1 m
2.0  2.0 m
 Now I want to extend the data to the depth2 values: (obviously there is not point to interpolate depth over depth, but it's a test before it gets more complicated). s2 = s1.reindex(depth2)
 This gives: S2=
      depth
0.0   0.0 m
1.0   NaN
1.1   1.1 m
1.5   NaN
2.0   2.0 m
 So far no problem. But when I try to interpolate the missing values doing: s2['depth'].interpolate(method='values')
 I got the following error: C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\numpy\lib\function_base.pyc in interp(x, xp, fp, left, right)
   1067         return compiled_interp([x], xp, fp, left, right).item()
   1068     else:
-> 1069         return compiled_interp(x, xp, fp, left, right)
  1070 
  1071 
TypeError: Cannot cast array data from dtype('O') to dtype('float64') according to the rule 'safe'
 I understand that interpolation from numpy does not work on object. But if I try now to interpolate the missing values by dropping the units, it works: s3 = s2['depth'].astype(float).interpolate(method='values')
 This gives: s3 = 
0.0   0
1.0   1
1.1   1.1
1.5   1.5
2.0   2
Name: depth, dtype: object
 How can I get back the unit in the depth column? I can't find any trick to put back the unit... Any help will be greatly appreciated. Thanks

@TITLE:XMLHttpRequest based CORS call with Basic Auth fails in Firefox and Chrome
@CONTENT:Need to make a REST GET call with Basic Auth from a javascript (in www.domain1.com). REST API is in domain2.com. REST API returns with the CORS specific HTTP headers. I need to support IE, Chrome and Firefox. Below JavaScript explains the issue further V Without Basic Auth (WORKS in IE 10, Chrome and Firefox, taking care of Older IEs by XDomainRequest object) var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open(method, url, true);
 With Basic Auth (WORKS in IE 10 only, Fails in Chrome and Firefox) var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open(method, url, true, username, password);
 With Basic Auth (Fails in Chrome and Firefox) var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open(method, url, true);
xhr.setRequestHeader("Authorization", "Basic " + btoa(username + ":" + password));
xhr. withCredentials = true;
 With Basic Auth (Fails in Chrome and Firefox) $.ajax({
type: 'GET',
url: jsonp_url,
dataType: "json",
username: username,
password: pwd,
beforeSend: function (xhr) {xhr.withCredentials = true; },
success: function (result) { },
error: function (xhr, ajaxOptions, thrownError) {

 I would love to get a solution here that works in Chrome and FireFox with Basic Auth
@CODE:var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open(method, url, true); var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open(method, url, true, username, password); var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open(method, url, true);

@TITLE:Custom list_editable field in django admin change list, which doesn't correspond directly to a model field
@CONTENT:Assuming my model looks like this (this is a simplified example): class Person(Model):
  first_name = CharField(...)
  last_name = CharField(...)

  def name():
    return first_name + ' ' + last_name
 Displaying the name as a single column in the admin change list is easy enough. However, I need a single, editable "name" field that is editable from the list page, which I can then parse to extract and set the model field values. The parsing isn't a concern. I am just wondering how to have an editable form field on the list page that doesn't correspond directly to a model field.

@LINK:/questions/19213942/using-css-values-in-a-d3-transition
@TITLE:Using CSS Values in a D3 Transition
@CONTENT:I'd like to make d3 transition to a style defined in CSS. I can successfully transition to a style value which I explicitly apply in code. But, I'd like the target values of the animation to be defined in a style sheet. Here's an example of a red div which transitions to a blue one:    <html>
    <head>
        <script src="http://d3js.org/d3.v3.js"></script>
        <style>            
            div {
                background: red
            }
        </style>

    </head>
    <body>
        <div>Hello There</div>

        <script>
            d3.select('body div')
                .transition()
                .duration(5000)
                .style("background", "cornflowerblue");
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
 And here's a my (incorrect) attempt at "storing" these values in CSS: <html>
    <head>
        <script src="http://d3js.org/d3.v3.js"></script>
        <style>            
            div {
                background: red
            }

            div.myDiv {
                background: cornflowerblue
            }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div>Hello There</div>

        <script>
            d3.select('body div')
                .transition()
                .duration(5000)
                .attr("class", "myDiv");
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
 The former animates the background from red to blue. The latter jumps from red to blue (no tweening is applied to background value defined in the CSS). I think I understand why it doesn't work. Can I animate to a set of values in a CSS style in d3, and how would I do it?
@CODE:<html>
    <head>
        <script src="http://d3js.org/d3.v3.js"></script>
        <style>

            }

    </head>
    <body>
        <div>Hello There</div>

        <script>
            d3.select('body div')
                .transition()
                .duration(5000)
                .style("background", "cornflowerblue");

@TITLE:Qt signal undefined reference error after inheriting from QObject
@CONTENT:I recently needed to add a signal to a class, so I changed the class to inherit from QObject and added the Q_OBJECT macro into the class definition. Since doing so I get "signal undefined reference error for 'vtable for CLICommand'" error on the class line below: // File clicommand.h
#include <QString>
#include <QStringList>
#include <QTcpSocket>
#include "telnetthread.h"

#include <QDebug>
#include <QTcpSocket>
#include <QTextStream>

#include "logger.h"

    emit signal_shutdown_request();
}
 I've read a bunch of posts on this topic but none seem to apply. I even tried clean/rebuildall. I am not using boost or other libraries...just QT 5 Can someone tell me what I'm doing wrong?

@TITLE:Android/PhoneGap: Using third-party libraries in plugin-development
@CONTENT:I'm working on a PhoneGap/Cordova plugin that's supposed to provide a socket for sending and receiving OSC messages (Open Sound Control). For that purpose I'd like to use JavaOSC but I'm uncertain about how to include the library into my project. I'm using Android Studio and I've basically followed this tutorial to set up my project. First I placed the raw JavaOSC class-files in the same directory as my OSCPlugin.class and placed the import declarations at the to of my OSCPlugin.class: import com.illposed.osc;
 That didn't work. As a next step I tried to add the library from maven within the project's module settings. I was able to download the jar files from maven and install put them into /platforms/android/libs. Within the settings for the module 'android' I can see that 'Android API 17' is supposed to be used as SDK, including cordova-3.1.0 and com.illposed.osc:javaosc-core:0.2 - both activated. I can see the cordova-3.1.0.jar as well as javaosc-core-0.2.jar, containing com.illposed.osc in the navigator within Android Studio. However, when trying to compile my project I get: Gradle: cannot find symbol class osc
 triggered from within OSCPlugin.class that contains the above mentioned import declaration I have very little experience with Java and even less with Android development. But I'd be interested in solving this riddle and get started. I have searched the Java docs but the problem doesn't merely lie within Java but rather within the structure of the Android project. I'd be thankful if someone could shed some light on this issue. Any hint's highly appreciated!

@LINK:/questions/19270741/how-to-do-simple-facebook-status-post-with-text-and-picture
@TITLE:How to do simple Facebook status post with text and picture
@CONTENT:I'm using the JavaScript API. I can do a simple text post with no problem: var params = {};
params['message'] = 'The text';
FB.api("me/feed", 'post', params, function(response) {
   if (!response || response.error)
      alert(response.error.message);
   else
      alert('Post ID: ' + response.id);
});
 Adding a picture with: params['picture'] = "http://mysite.com/link-to-picture";
params['type'] = "photo";
...
 Posts a link-type status with a garbled link, using the picture as a thumbnail. If I use "my/photos", it works fine the first time: var params = {};
params['message'] = 'The text';
params['url'] = "http://mysite.com/link-to-picture";
FB.api("me/photos", 'post', params, function(response) {
   if (!response || response.error)
      alert(response.error.message);
   else
      alert('Post ID: ' + response.id);
});
 But then if I do another post I lose the first post item from my feed, and get an album type presentation in the feed with the text from the second post, and both (unrelated) pictures The only way I have been able to get distinct status posts with their own text and picture is by first creating a serial numbered album, and then posting the picture to that. var aparams = {};
aparams['name'] = "post"+postid;
aparams['message'] = "album for post "+postid;
FB.api("me/albums", 'post', aparams, function(response) {
  if (!response || response.error)
  {
     alert("Creating album: "+response.error.message);
  }
  else
  {
     alert('Album ID: ' + response.id);
     var aid = response.id;
     params['url'] = "http://mysite.com/link-to-picture";
     FB.api(aid+"/photos", 'post', params, function(response) {
        if (!response || response.error)
           alert("Posting photo: "+response.error.message);
        else
           alert('Post ID: ' + response.id);
     });
  }
});
 That can't be the right way to do it - creating a mass of single picture albums! I notice that I have by default a 'Timeline Photos' album, so I could get its ID, then upload the picture to that. But then how would I do the FB.api("my/feed" ...) post with just the text and refer to the picture. I can't find anything like that in the documentation. My requirement seems to me to be very basic. Has anyone been able to get it right?
@CODE:var params = {};
params['message'] = 'The text';
FB.api("me/feed", 'post', params, function(response) {
   if (!response || response.error)
      alert(response.error.message);
   else
      alert('Post ID: ' + response.id);
}); params['picture'] = "http://mysite.com/link-to-picture";
params['type'] = "photo";
... var params = {};
params['message'] = 'The text';
params['url'] = "http://mysite.com/link-to-picture";
FB.api("me/photos", 'post', params, function(response) {
   if (!response || response.error)
      alert(response.error.message);
   else
      alert('Post ID: ' + response.id);
}); var aparams = {};
aparams['name'] = "post"+postid;
aparams['message'] = "album for post "+postid;
FB.api("me/albums", 'post', aparams, function(response) {
  if (!response || response.error)
  {
     alert("Creating album: "+response.error.message);
  }
  else
  {
     alert('Album ID: ' + response.id);
     var aid = response.id;
     params['url'] = "http://mysite.com/link-to-picture";
     FB.api(aid+"/photos", 'post', params, function(response) {
        if (!response || response.error)
           alert("Posting photo: "+response.error.message);
        else
           alert('Post ID: ' + response.id);

@TITLE:How to achieve smooth expand/ collapse animation
@CONTENT:I'm referring the expand / collapse animation code found at here. Android: Expand/collapse animation Although it works, it doesn't done the job well. The animation isn't smooth. I do some logging in the code. public static void expand(final View v) {
    v.measure(MeasureSpec.makeMeasureSpec(((View)v.getParent()).getWidth(), MeasureSpec.EXACTLY), MeasureSpec.makeMeasureSpec(1024, MeasureSpec.AT_MOST));
    final int targtetHeight = v.getMeasuredHeight();

    {

        protected void applyTransformation(float interpolatedTime, Transformation t) {
            v.getLayoutParams().height = interpolatedTime == 1
                    ? LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT
                    : (int)(targtetHeight * interpolatedTime);
            Log.i("CHEOK", "E v.getLayoutParams().height = " + v.getLayoutParams().height);
            v.requestLayout();
        }
 The following log message is printed. 10-09 12:29:58.808: I/CHEOK(7874): E v.getLayoutParams().height = 0

 New height occur every ~20ms. So, the FPS of the animation is around 50fps Of course, I can't just remove requestLayout, as UI won't updated on screen. I was wondering, is there any improvement can be done, to achieve animation FPS closed to 50fps? I had seen some commercial product with smooth Expand/collapse example. So, I think this is something achievable. Just that, I'm not sure exactly how. My layout code is as followed :         <LinearLayout

 I wish to perform smooth animation on chart_description_text_view from Collapsing (During app startup) Expanding (When user taps on it) One of the "role models" I can think of is https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.bitspin.timely. Try to invoke the below dialog from its Shop menu item. You will realize how smooth their animation is. Not exactly sure how they achieve that.
@CODE:public static void expand(final View v) {
    v.measure(MeasureSpec.makeMeasureSpec(((View)v.getParent()).getWidth(), MeasureSpec.EXACTLY), MeasureSpec.makeMeasureSpec(1024, MeasureSpec.AT_MOST));
    final int targtetHeight = v.getMeasuredHeight();

    v.getLayoutParams().height = 0;
    v.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);
    Animation a = new Animation()
    {

@TITLE:Node.js Deployment in openshift
@CONTENT:I was trying to deploy a Node.js application to the openshift as in this link here I understand this code var http = require('http');

var server = http.createServer(function(req, res) {

});
server.listen(3000);
 and there is no issue running it locally $ node server.js // saved as server.js
 However, how does this work when I commit this application in openshift? This is very simple code. I have some downloaded code that is a chat application and client-server need to configure to listen on some port (I was using port number 3000 in my localhost). It works on port number 3000 in localhost but how can I make it to work in Openshift?

@TITLE:Pandas interpolate data with units
@CONTENT:Hi Everyone, I've been looking to Stackoverflow for couple of years, and it helped me a lot, so much that I never have to register before :) But today I'm stuck on a problem using Python with Pandas and Quantities (could be unum or pint as well). I try to do my best to make a clear post, but since it's my first one, I apologize if something is confusing and will try to correct any mistake you'll find :) I want to import data from a source and build a Pandas dataframe as follow: import pandas as pd
import quantities as pq

depth = [0.0,1.1,2.0] * pq.m
depth2 = [0,1,1.1,1.5,2] * pq.m

s1 = pd.DataFrame(
        {'depth' : [x for x in depth]},
        index = depth)
 This gives: S1=
     depth
0.0  0.0 m
1.1  1.1 m
2.0  2.0 m
 Now I want to extend the data to the depth2 values: (obviously there is not point to interpolate depth over depth, but it's a test before it gets more complicated). s2 = s1.reindex(depth2)
 This gives: S2=
      depth
0.0   0.0 m
1.0   NaN
1.1   1.1 m
1.5   NaN
2.0   2.0 m
 So far no problem. But when I try to interpolate the missing values doing: s2['depth'].interpolate(method='values')
 I got the following error: C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\numpy\lib\function_base.pyc in interp(x, xp, fp, left, right)
   1067         return compiled_interp([x], xp, fp, left, right).item()
   1068     else:
-> 1069         return compiled_interp(x, xp, fp, left, right)
  1070 
  1071 
TypeError: Cannot cast array data from dtype('O') to dtype('float64') according to the rule 'safe'
 I understand that interpolation from numpy does not work on object. But if I try now to interpolate the missing values by dropping the units, it works: s3 = s2['depth'].astype(float).interpolate(method='values')
 This gives: s3 = 
0.0   0
1.0   1
1.1   1.1
1.5   1.5
2.0   2
Name: depth, dtype: object
 How can I get back the unit in the depth column? I can't find any trick to put back the unit... Any help will be greatly appreciated. Thanks

Below JavaScript explains the issue further V Without Basic Auth (WORKS in IE 10, Chrome and Firefox, taking care of Older IEs by XDomainRequest object) var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open(method, url, true);
 With Basic Auth (WORKS in IE 10 only, Fails in Chrome and Firefox) var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open(method, url, true, username, password);
 With Basic Auth (Fails in Chrome and Firefox) var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open(method, url, true);
xhr.setRequestHeader("Authorization", "Basic " + btoa(username + ":" + password));
xhr. withCredentials = true;
 With Basic Auth (Fails in Chrome and Firefox) $.ajax({
type: 'GET',
url: jsonp_url,
dataType: "json",
username: username,
password: pwd,
beforeSend: function (xhr) {xhr.withCredentials = true; },
success: function (result) { },
error: function (xhr, ajaxOptions, thrownError) {

 I would love to get a solution here that works in Chrome and FireFox with Basic Auth
@CODE:var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open(method, url, true); var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open(method, url, true, username, password); var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open(method, url, true);

 Displaying the name as a single column in the admin change list is easy enough. However, I need a single, editable "name" field that is editable from the list page, which I can then parse to extract and set the model field values. The parsing isn't a concern. I am just wondering how to have an editable form field on the list page that doesn't correspond directly to a model field.

@LINK:/questions/19213942/using-css-values-in-a-d3-transition
@TITLE:Using CSS Values in a D3 Transition
@CONTENT:I'd like to make d3 transition to a style defined in CSS. I can successfully transition to a style value which I explicitly apply in code. But, I'd like the target values of the animation to be defined in a style sheet. Here's an example of a red div which transitions to a blue one:    <html>
    <head>
        <script src="http://d3js.org/d3.v3.js"></script>
        <style>            
            div {
                background: red
            }
        </style>

    </head>
    <body>
        <div>Hello There</div>

        <script>
            d3.select('body div')
                .transition()
                .duration(5000)
                .style("background", "cornflowerblue");
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
 And here's a my (incorrect) attempt at "storing" these values in CSS: <html>
    <head>
        <script src="http://d3js.org/d3.v3.js"></script>
        <style>            
            div {
                background: red
            }

            div.myDiv {
                background: cornflowerblue
            }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div>Hello There</div>

        <script>
            d3.select('body div')
                .transition()
                .duration(5000)
                .attr("class", "myDiv");
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
 The former animates the background from red to blue. The latter jumps from red to blue (no tweening is applied to background value defined in the CSS). I think I understand why it doesn't work. Can I animate to a set of values in a CSS style in d3, and how would I do it?
@CODE:<html>
    <head>
        <script src="http://d3js.org/d3.v3.js"></script>
        <style>

    <body>

                .transition()

#include <QStringList>
#include <QTcpSocket>

@TITLE:Why won't my application find the default satellite assembly en-US resources?
@CONTENT:I'm creating a multi-language application with WPF. I'm using static resources, strings stored in .resx/res files to have text appear in the culture of the user. Here's a part of the project's directory structure: Resources GreetingWindowRes.resx (this is the default, for en-US) GreetingsWindowRes.de-DE.resx In the .csproj, I have: <UICulture>en-US</UICulture> In the AssemblyInfo.cs: [assembly: NeutralResourcesLanguage("en-US", UltimateResourceFallbackLocation.Satellite)] After compilation, I can see the resource files appear: en-US / MyApp.resources.dll de-DE / MyApp.resources.dll So I bind to a static string resource in GreetingWindow.xaml: <windows:MyWindowBase x:Class="CommanderDotNET.MyApp.Windows.GreetingWindow"
    xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
    xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
    xmlns:windows="clr-namespace:MyApp.Windows"
    xmlns:res="clr-namespace:MyApp.Resources">

    <Label Content="{x:Static res:GreetingWindowRes.FirstGreetingText}" />

</windows:MyWindowBase>
 The results are puzzling to me: If UICulture is set to de-DE, the label text appears correctly in German. If UICulture is set to en-US, System.Windows.Markup.StaticExtension throws a XamlParseException. The error I see for the XAML must be the reason: Could not find any resources appropriate for the specified culture or the neutral culture. Make sure "MyApp.Resources.GreetingWindowRes.en-US.resources" was correctly embedded or linked into assembly "MyApp" at compile time, or that all the satellite assemblies required are loadable and fully signed. What am I doing wrong? SOLUTION: After lots of searching, I found a good explanation here: http://www.west-wind.com/weblog/posts/2009/Jun/04/Resx-and-BAML-Resources-in-WPF Apparently when using UltimateResourceFallbackLocation.Satellite + <UICulture>, you would need to have both ResxResource.resx and GreetingWindowRes.en-US.resx files for the main language (nasty duplication). But, if you only want to use Resx resources, and no BAML localization, this is not the way to go, and the situation is a lot better. The proper way with only Resx resources: AssemblyInfo.cs: [assembly: NeutralResourcesLanguage("en-US", UltimateResourceFallbackLocation.MainAssembly)] .csproj: do NOT add <UICulture> resource naming: ResxResource.resx (main language) + ResxResource.de-DE.resx (additional language)
@CODE:<UICulture>en-US</UICulture> [assembly: NeutralResourcesLanguage("en-US", UltimateResourceFallbackLocation.Satellite)] <windows:MyWindowBase x:Class="CommanderDotNET.MyApp.Windows.GreetingWindow"

@TITLE:bq.py Not Paging Results
@CONTENT:We're working on writing a wrapper for bq.py and are having some problems with result sets larger than 100k rows. It seems like in the past this has worked fine (we had related problems with Google BigQuery Incomplete Query Replies on Odd Attempts). Perhaps I'm not understanding the limits explained on the doc page? For instance: #!/bin/bash

for i in `seq 99999 100002`;
do
    bq query -q --nouse_cache --max_rows 99999999 "SELECT id, FROM [publicdata:samples.wikipedia] LIMIT $i" > $i.txt
    j=$(cat $i.txt | wc -l)
    echo "Limit $i Returned $j Rows"
done
 Yields (note there are 4 lines of formatting): Limit 99999 Returned   100003 Rows
Limit 100000 Returned   100004 Rows
Limit 100001 Returned   100004 Rows
Limit 100002 Returned   100004 Rows
 In our wrapper, we directly access the API: while row_count < total_rows:
    data = client.apiclient.tabledata().list(maxResults=total_rows - row_count,
                                                 pageToken=page_token,
                                                 **table_dict).execute()

    # If there are more results than will fit on a page, 
    # you will recieve a token for the next page
    page_token = data.get('pageToken', None)

    # How many rows are there across all pages?
    total_rows = min(total_rows, int(data['totalRows'])) # Changed to use get(data[rows],0)
    raw_page = data.get('rows', [])
 We would expect to get a token in this case, but none is returned.

@TITLE:NSAttributedString change color at end of string
@CONTENT:This must be an easy thing to do, but I cannot figure it out. I have a NSMutableAttributedString that has, for example, "This is a test" in it. I want to color the word "test" blue, which I do with this: NSMutableAttributedString *coloredText = [[NSMutableAttributedString alloc] initWithString:@"This is a test"];

[coloredText addAttribute:NSForegroundColorAttributeName value:[UIColor blueColor] range:NSMakeRange(10,4)];
 That works just fine. But now I want to set the text color back to black for anything typed after "test". If I do: [coloredText addAttribute:NSForegroundColorAttributeName value:[UIColor blackColor] range:NSMakeRange(coloredText.string.length, 1)];
 I get an objectAtIndex:effectiveRange: out of bounds error. Assumedly because the range extends beyond the length of the string. If I do: [coloredText addAttribute:NSForegroundColorAttributeName value:[UIColor blackColor] range:NSMakeRange(coloredText.string.length, 0)];
 The error goes away but typing after the word "test" remains blue. How do I set the current color at the insertion point when it is at the end of the string?? Cheers for any input.
@CODE:NSMutableAttributedString *coloredText = [[NSMutableAttributedString alloc] initWithString:@"This is a test"];

[coloredText addAttribute:NSForegroundColorAttributeName value:[UIColor blueColor] range:NSMakeRange(10,4)]; [coloredText addAttribute:NSForegroundColorAttributeName value:[UIColor blackColor] range:NSMakeRange(coloredText.string.length, 1)]; [coloredText addAttribute:NSForegroundColorAttributeName value:[UIColor blackColor] range:NSMakeRange(coloredText.string.length, 0)]; NSAttributedString UITextField UITextView

 The html <postprocess ng-model="some_model.its_property" style="padding-top: 10px;" />
 Somewhere in the controller, I update the model property some_model.its_property = 'Holla';
 But it doesn't update the corresponding directive. It works perfectly when loading which tells me that it might not be entirely a scoping issue.

My guess is that Apple's fill rate will not be that high, so I'd like to fall back to Admob if an ad isn't available. Unfortunately the API for iAd looks really opaque, and I don't see a way to determine if an ad is available. Has anyone successfully done this, and if so, how?

@TITLE:List<T>.Enumerator IEnumerator.Reset() method implementation
@CONTENT:Despite the fact, that IEnumerator.Reset method should never be used I found strange behavior of the method implementation within List<T>. No matter how you examine the .NET Framework Source Code (tried with reference source and ILSpy) the method is implemented as following: void System.Collections.IEnumerator.Reset() {
    if (version != list._version) {
        ThrowHelper.ThrowInvalidOperationException(ExceptionResource.InvalidOperation_EnumFailedVersion);
    }

    index = 0;
    current = default(T);
}
 However, it looks like the method is never called at all! Consider the code: var list = new List<int>(1) { 3 };
using (var e = list.GetEnumerator())
{
    Console.WriteLine(e.MoveNext());
    Console.WriteLine(e.Current);

    ((IEnumerator)e).Reset();

    Console.WriteLine(e.MoveNext());
    Console.WriteLine(e.Current);
}
 It's pretty clear, that it should print True and 3 twice. Instead of that the result is True
3
False
0
 Any simple explanation I'm missing?
@CODE:IEnumerator.Reset List<T> void System.Collections.IEnumerator.Reset() {

 Currently - though luck and magic - it works (sort of). My problem is I'm only using 12 of my 24 cores. Can someone explain why this might be the case? Perhaps my code isn't the best multiprocessing solution, or is it a feature of my architecture [Intel Xeon CPU E5-2640 @ 2.50GHz x18 running on Ubuntu 13.04 x64]?

for item in degreelist:
    p.apply_async(_all_simple_paths_graph, args=(DG, cutoff, item, memorizedPaths, filepaths))
p.close()
p.join()
 Working, however, it's VERY SLOW! So I assume I'm using the wrong function for the job. hopefully it helps clarify exactly what I'm trying to accomplish! EDIT2: .map attempt: partialfunc = partial(_all_simple_paths_graph, DG=DG, cutoff=cutoff, memorizedPaths=memorizedPaths, filepaths=filepaths)
p = mp.Pool()

@TITLE:Trying to connect my node.js to Heroku PostgreSQL database. Following Heroku Postgres tutorial
@CONTENT:I'm following these two Heroku tutorials: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs and https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgresql I have the 'hello world' app working. But I am getting an error when I add the node.js code to connect to postgreSQL. My package.json {
  "name": "node-example",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "dependencies": {
    "pg": "2.x",
    "express": "3.1.x"
  },
  "engines": {
    "node": "0.10.x",
    "npm": "1.2.x"
  }
}
 My web.js var express = require("express");
var app = express();
app.use(express.logger());

app.get('/', function(request, response) {
  response.send('Hello World!');
});

var port = process.env.PORT || 5000;
app.listen(port, function() {
  console.log("Listening on " + port);
});

var pg = require('pg');

pg.connect(process.env.DATABASE_URL, function(err, client, done) {
  client.query('SELECT * FROM your_table', function(err, result) {
    done();
    if(err) return console.error(err);
    console.log(result.rows);
  });
});
 My Heroku postgres database is working well and I can connect to it directly with heroku pg:psql

@TITLE:How do I find out what escape sequence my terminal needs to send?
@CONTENT:I am using the terminal application on osX to connect to ubuntu (12.04 i think). I have the terminal at it's default setting of xerm-256. In this mode the terminal sends the sequence of \033OQ when F2 is pressed. There is no mapping however for Shift-F2 or Control-F2. There is also no sequences set for Shift-Left, Shift-Right, Control-Left, Control-Right, etc. I need some of these keys to operate features from time to time in various programs. Take for example byobu. Shift-F2 and Control-F2 are used to split the screen vertically and horizontally. In tmux the arrow keys are used with shift and control for resizing panes. My problem is that I don't know what sequence the terminal should send. How do I find out what these sequences should be? I know that I can press Control-v and then a key to get the code that is being received but this is not what I need. I don't need to see what sequence is being sent. I need to know what sequence I need to send. For instance my left arrow sends ^[OD. My Control-Left sends ^[[5D]. However my up and down keys have no distinction. My down sends ^[OB and Control-down also sends ^[OB. Same problem with my up key. It is the same with or without shift. Is there a list somewhere with all of the keys and there codes, specifically with modifiers such as shift, control, alt/option? How can I find out what the expected sequence is so I can send what is needed?

@TITLE:How to use a php restful api-centric design internal instead of with http request
@CONTENT:I want to create a php restful api-centric web application/website where I have the data/api that gets called from my front end code. Besides making HTTP/curl request calls each time I load a page, what can I do for internal API calls using frameworks like slim? I'm not sure of a way to include the api for internal use in my front end code and still keep it apart. My thoughts was something like this: "example.com/api/story/todays-weather/"
pulls in the json formatted story with a http request with curl or Ajax
 But instead could I do something like: require("/api/internal.php");
$uri = "/story/todays-weather/";
$call = api::getStory($uri);
$result = json_decode($call);
.....
 Am I headed in the right direction or am I way off? The api and front code are on the same cloud box (Amazon E2/LAMP) and I am planing on using memcached for the api.

 This involve app to show 'Error' view every time when unhandled exception thrown in any level of app. But, if i have some logic in other global authorize or action filter, that produce some exception, than when exception trhown first time, then app try to redirect to Error View, again other filter begin to executing and produce same exception again, so asp.net to avoid this looping terminate app. So how the best way to use this HandleErrorAttribute to avoid such behavior? Thanks! Edit: After a some debug i found that this is not usual behavior of HandleErrorAttribute, so this looping happens for me only when i use custom Routes f.e. {key}/{controller}/{action}
 and when some error occurs in filter logic, then app try to redirect to Error View, but again another filter logic begins to exectue and i even see an "Error" value in {key} route parameter, so it is unwanted behavior. When i use default route {controller}/{action} this not happens and i get exactly to Error View without executing any global filter logic second time.
@CODE:filters.Add(new HandleErrorAttribute{View = "Error"}); {key}/{controller}/{action} {controller}/{action}

@TITLE:Why does SQLAlchemy create_engine with charset=utf8 return python type <str> and not type <unicode>?
@CONTENT:Using Python 2.7 and SQLAlchemy 0.7, I'm connecting to a MySQL DB with the command: engine = create_engine('mysql://username:password@host/dbname?charset=utf8',echo=False)
 According to the SQLAlchemy docs, setting charset=utf8 automatically implies use_unicode=1, so that all strings should come back as unicode. http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_0_7/dialects/mysql.html specifically gives the example #set client encoding to utf8; all strings come back as unicode create_engine('mysql+mysqldb:///mydb?charset=utf8') So why, then, when I query a text field in a mapped class, does that field end up with type "str"? Base = declarative_base(engine)

class RegionTranslation(Base):
    ''''''
    __tablename__ = 'RegionTranslation'
    __table_args__ = {'autoload':True}
    def __init__(self, region_id, lang_id, name):
        self.region_id = region_id
        self.lang_id = lang_id
        self.name = name

rtrans = session.query(RegionTranslation).filter_by(region_id = 1, lang_id = 6).one()
print (type(rtrans.name))
 The output is  <type 'str'>
 If I just accept this and decode the string before using it, things are fine. But I don't get why the above code isn't returning the type 'unicode'. Can someone please, please explain this?
@CODE:engine = create_engine('mysql://username:password@host/dbname?charset=utf8',echo=False) Base = declarative_base(engine)

@TITLE:PlayFramework 2.2 Java Action Composition
@CONTENT:I've been using Action composition on my Play! apps until now, and they worked fine. However with the recent 2.2.0 update they no longer work and I don't know how to updated them correctly. That this action for example: public class ChatMsgValidation extends Action<ChatMsgValidation.ValidChatMsg> {

@With(ChatMsgValidation.class)
@Target({ElementType.TYPE, ElementType.METHOD})
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
public @interface ValidChatMsg {
}


public Result call(Http.Context ctx) throws Throwable {

    Utils.debugFunctionCall("ValidChatMsg() " + ctx.toString());

    // validate we got the "player" parameter
    JsonNode jsonRequest = request().body().asJson();
    if (!WSUtils.validateJSONField(Constants.JSON_MSG, jsonRequest)) {
        return badRequest(WSUtils.simpleMissingFieldMsg(Constants.JSON_MSG));
    }

    RequestParser requestParser = new RequestParser(request());
    String chatMsg = requestParser.getMessage();

    if (chatMsg.isEmpty()) {
        return badRequest(WSUtils.simpleFailureMsgWithReason(Messages.get("message.cannot.be.empty.error"), FailConstants.REASON_EMPTY));
    }


    if (chatMsg.length() < Constants.MIN_CHAT_MESSAGE_LENGTH) {
        return badRequest(WSUtils.simpleFailureMsgWithReason(Messages.get("query.lower.limit.error"), FailConstants.REASON_TOO_SHORT));
    }

    if (chatMsg.length() > Constants.MAX_CHAT_MESSAGE_LENGTH) {
        return badRequest(WSUtils.simpleFailureMsgWithReason(Messages.get("message.too.long.error"), FailConstants.REASON_TOO_LONG));
    }

    return delegate.call(ctx);
}
}
 Problem is now the "call" method should return "Promise" instead of "Result", and I can't figure out a way to return a simple JSON message without doing a LOT of code, useless code because I'm creating dummy functions just to have Promises. There has to be a better way I'm not seeing, please advise.
@CODE:public class ChatMsgValidation extends Action<ChatMsgValidation.ValidChatMsg> {

    // validate we got the "player" parameter

@CONTENT:I am trying to change the user shown on the VS2012 splash screen next to "licensed to" - its an OCD thing. I am on Windows 8 Pro with VS2012 Professional. I have found some help online that tells me to: Open Registry Editor (Start->Run->type regedit->press enter)
Find the following key: HKCU\Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\11.0_Config\Registration\UserName
Change its value to the desired name
Navigate to the following folder: C:\Users\{YOUR_USER}\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\VisualStudio\11.0 (replace the placeholder with your own username)
Delete the file vs000223.dat V this is actually a JPG file containing the splash screen, you can change its name to see it for yourself
Start Visual Studio, and it magically recreates the file with the modified name in it!
 So I have followed these steps and changed the registry keys (including the Windows NT ones) and then it say's to delete the vs000223.dat file. However, this file doesnt exist, within the C:\Users{YOUR_USER}\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\VisualStudio\11.0 folder there is only one dat file - ObjBrowEx.dat - but deleting this does nothing - it gets re-created. I have done a search and there is no vs000223.dat I have even tried running devenv /setup - but that doesn't help. I have deleted the splashhash registry binary entry, but that didnt work either. I am clearly missing something, or doing things in the wrong order. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

@CONTENT:The company I work for is coming near to completion of an iOS app for internal use only amongst employees. I have done some research and found that in house deployment would be most suitable for our use. However there are some things that from my research I am not clear on and would like to hear from people who have deployed apps using this method. If we deploy an app in house does it still need submitting to Apple or does this method overcome this problem? Are there any additional requirements? I have looked through the Apple website on this and understand that the app needs to be hosted on a secure server and about the need of the accompanying XML file. Does my company need to sign up to this "iOS Developer Enterprise Program" before we can distribute in house? What limitations are there if any over publishing to the app store?

 I think that it is trying to access the collection directly, which it was allowed to do with "insecure" and "autopublish" enabled, but once they were disabled it was given access denied. Another piece I think is problematic: else {
    Posts.insert({
    user: Meteor.user().profile.name,
    post: post.value,
    time: Date.now(),
});
 I think that the same sort of thing is happening: it is trying to access the collection directly, which it is not allowed to do. My question is, how do I re-factor it so that I do not need "insecure" and "autopublish" enabled? Thanks. EDIT Final: /**

@TITLE:PostgreSQL - DISTINCT ON and GROUP BY syntax
@CONTENT:I realized that a database query was returning unexpected results do to my improper use of "DISTINCT ON" and "GROUP BY" I'm hoping someone can set me straight on this. The actual query is quite complex , so I'll dumb it down : I have a table/inner query that consists of an object_id and a timestamp: CREATE TABLE test_select ( object_id INT , event_timestamp timestamp );
COPY test_select (object_id , event_timestamp) FROM stdin (DELIMITER '|');

\.
 I'm trying to select a distinct ID , ordered/deduplicated by the timestamp on reverse chron so the results should be [ 4, 1, 3, 2, 5 ] I think this does what I need (it seems to ): SELECT object_id  
FROM test_select 
GROUP BY object_id 
ORDER BY max(event_timestamp) DESC
;
 For testing/auditing purposes , I sometimes want to include the timestamp field. I can't seem to figure out how to include another field with that query. Can anyone point out glaring problems in my sql above, or suggestions on how to include the auditing info ?

 I have made polar plots as follows: library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data, aes(x = legend.var, y = score, fill = Indicator), color='black') + 
  geom_bar(width = 1, alpha=0.5, stat="identity") + 
  scale_y_continuous() + 
  coord_polar()  + 
  theme( axis.ticks = element_blank()) + 
  facet_wrap(~Village, nrow=2, ncol=3) + 
  guides(colour = guide_legend(title.hjust = 0.5))
 As you can see in the data, column legend.var is grouped by the column indicator. I would like to insert a table or a second legend which associates each of the indicator with the legend.var and variables column. Ideally if this is inserted as a second legend, the unique items comprised in legend.var column would have the same fill color as the corresponding indicator. The fill legend is based on the column indicator. The inserted table/extra legend would comprise columns legend.var with a unique alphabet and column variables with the meaning of the respective alphabet. These can then have the same fill color as the corresponding indicator. I hope this is clear.

@TITLE:How do you access data in the template when using DRF ModelViewSet and TemplateHTMLRenderer?
@CONTENT:I've got a Django Rest Framework ModelViewSet and am trying to use the TemplateHTMLRenderer to display HTML. Following along in the tutorial: from rest_framework import permissions, renderers, viewsets
from rest_framework.decorators import link

from . import models, serializers
from .permissions import IsOwnerOrReadOnly


class SnippetViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    template_name = 'snippet-list.html'
    queryset = models.Snippet.objects.all()
    serializer_class = serializers.SnippetSerializer
    renderer_classes = (renderers.TemplateHTMLRenderer,)
    permission_classes = (permissions.IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly,
                          IsOwnerOrReadOnly,)

    @link(renderer_classes=[renderers.StaticHTMLRenderer])
    def highlight(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        snippet = self.get_object()
        return Response(snippet.highlighted)

    def pre_save(self, obj):
        obj.owner = self.request.user
 If I add a key in def resolve_context() I can access the model objects in my template that are passed into the RequestContext. If I don't add the data key then I don't know how to access the Snippets. def resolve_context(self, data, request, response):
    if response.exception:
        data['status_code'] = response.status_code

    #return RequestContext(request, data)  # original source on github
    return RequestContext(request, {'data': data})  # if I add a key I can access it
 So I've got to be missing something easy or how I'm expecting this to behave is not how the authors intended?

@CONTENT:I have a need to use section name other than log4net in the config section. I know this is what we generally use <section name="log4net" type="log4net.Config.Log4NetConfigurationSectionHandler,log4net" />
 But I need to have a section like this <section name="log2net" type="log4net.Config.Log4NetConfigurationSectionHandler,log4net" />
 I am working on a sitecore website and it has its own Sitecore.Logging dll which is also derived from log4net. So the Sitecore Logging dll is referring to section log4net in web.config We have our custom log4net appender that works only with log4net and not with sitecore.logging dll. So I thought I can have two loggers in my project, sitecore.logger and log4net logger. Sitecore.logger uses log4net section so I wanted log4net to use a different section anme like log2net I tried to use the below code by having log2net section in config. But I get the error log4net:ERROR XmlHierarchyConfigurator: Xml element is - not a log4net element.  XmlElement element = (XmlElement)ConfigurationManager.GetSection("log2net");
        log4net.Config.XmlConfigurator.Configure(element);

@LINK:/questions/18859045/how-to-call-html5-form-checkvalidity-during-form-onsubmit-in-webforms
@TITLE:How to call HTML5 form.checkValidity during form.onSubmit in WebForms?
@CONTENT:How can i override, or extend, the standard WebForms WebForm_OnSubmit javascript function? I am using HTML5 input types in an ASP.net WebForms web-site. The user-agent (e.g. Chrome, IE, Firefox) already correctly handles data sanitization, alternate UI, etc. Normally, when a user clicks an <input type="submit"> button, the User-Agent will halt the submit, and show UI to indicate to the user that their input is going to be invalid: The problem with WebForms is that it does not use a Submit button. Instead, everything can be done through a javascript postback, rather than submitting the form:  <asp:LinkButton ID="bbOK" Text="Save User" runat="server" OnClick="bbOK_Click"></asp:LinkButton>
 Which, when rendered into client html, becomes a call to the Javascript: WebForm_DoPostBackWithOptions(...)
 With the really long form being an Anchor tag: <a id="Really_Long_Thing_ctl00_bbOK" 
   href='javascript:WebForm_DoPostBackWithOptions(new WebForm_PostBackOptions("ctl00$MainContent$VistaToolbar$ctl00$bbOK", "", true, "", "", false, true))'>
   Save User
</a>
 This means that the user-agent never gives the user a prompt that an entered element is invalid. Even though the form is not being "submitted", it does still trigger an onsubmit event. I can manually trigger the HTML5 form validation using something like: isValid = form.checkValidity();
 Ideally i would hook that event in my ASP.web WebForms site: Site.master <form runat="server" onsubmit="return CheckFormValidation(this)">

<script type="text/javascript">
   function CheckFormValidation(sender) 
   {
      //Is the html5 form validation method supported?
      if (sender.checkValidity)
         return sender.checkValidity();

      //If the form doesn't support validation, then we just assume true
      return true;
   }
</script>
 Except that the WebForms infrastructure deletes my onsubmit method handler, and replaces it with its own: <form id="ctl01" onsubmit="javascript:return WebForm_OnSubmit();" action="UserProperties.aspx?userGuid=00112233-5544-4666-7777-8899aabbccdd" method="post">
 So my own submit call is ignored. It appears that delving into WebForm_OnSubmit leads down a rabbit hole of ASP.net WebForms validation infrastructure: function WebForm_OnSubmit() 
{
   if (typeof(ValidatorOnSubmit) == "function" && ValidatorOnSubmit() == false) 
      return false;
   return true;
}
 which calls the function: var Page_ValidationActive = false;
function ValidatorOnSubmit() 
{
    if (Page_ValidationActive) {
        return ValidatorCommonOnSubmit();
    }
    else 
    {
        return true;
    }
}
 which calls, which calls, which uses, which checks. Just want HTML5 form validation with WebForms The issue is that WebForms has a huge infrastrucure for checking a form before submitting, and displaying errors to users through a standardized mechanism (and entire infrastructure that i do not use). It takes over the onsubmit event of forms, and it doesn't (necessarily) use an <input type="submit"> in the process. What can i do to convince ASP.net WebForms web-site to let the User-Agent validate the form? See also HTML5 validation and ASP.net Webforms How do I get Client-side validation of ASP.Net page to run? Trigger standard HTML5 validation (form) without using submit button? MSDN Magazine: Better Web Forms with HTML5 Forms

Here is the snippet from the article: During the design phase of WPF, the goal was to move to a single thread of execution, but a non-thread "affinitized" model. Thread affinity happens when a component uses the identity of the executing thread to store some type of state. The most common form of this is to use the thread local store (TLS) to store state. Thread affinity requires that each logical thread of execution be owned by only one physical thread in the operating system, which can become memory intensive Can someone pls. explain what is the difference between logical vs physical thread ?

@LINK:/questions/18855079/slow-search-for-items-using-extended-property-on-exchange
@TITLE:Slow search for items using extended property on Exchange
@CONTENT:Problem at hand Our C# Windows application uses EWS Managed API 2.0 to create appointments in a user's calendar. Each appointment has an extended property with a unique value. It later locates an appointment using FindItems and an ItemView. Users experience significant delays the first time this search is performed. Subsequent response times are entirely acceptable. ("first time" is a little vague here, because users may experience the delay again later in the day) // locate ID of appointment where extended property value equals 1234:
var filter = new Ews.SearchFilter.IsEqualTo(extendedPropertyDefinition, 1234);
var view = new ItemView(1, 0);
view.PropertySet = BasePropertySet.IdOnly;
var folder = new FolderId(WellKnownFolderName.Calendar, new Mailbox("..."));
var result = service.FindItems(folder, filter, view);
 Remote server is an Exchange Server 2007 SP1. Research MSDN ties some comments to search folders and restricted views, however I am uncertain if these apply to our situation. The act of applying a view to a folder creates search folders in the store. When a search folder is created, it is cached for later use. If a user tries to create a search folder which already exists, the cached search folder is used. This allows future viewings to be fairly quick. By default, Exchange does not cache all search folders indefinitely. Specifically with regard to EWS: It is also important to be aware of the fact that the first time an Exchange store search query is issued, it will run very slowly and possibly time out, whereas on future runs it will respond without issue. This is caused by back-end processes that occur on the Exchange server when a store search is performed. They suggest creating search folders for non-changing, non-dynamic queries, which doesn't seem fitting in our case, since the query is different for each appointment. If an application requires a specific query that has a fixed set of nonchanging parameters, you can use search folders. [...] search folders are useful only for nonchanging, nondynamic queries. What we need is in essence to create an "index" - in database terms - on the property, ensuring that all searches on this specific property are fast, no matter the time or frequency. Is it possible to "index" this property? Can anything be configured either client or server side to remove this initial delay?
@CODE:FindItems ItemView // locate ID of appointment where extended property value equals 1234:
var filter = new Ews.SearchFilter.IsEqualTo(extendedPropertyDefinition, 1234);
var view = new ItemView(1, 0);
view.PropertySet = BasePropertySet.IdOnly;
var folder = new FolderId(WellKnownFolderName.Calendar, new Mailbox("..."));

@CONTENT:Okay, I'm pretty sure I'm doing something immensely stupid, but I can't seem to figure it out, so here it goes. I'm attempting to use OpenSSLs EVP crap to do some encryption. I'm pretty sure my code is right, but I can't seem to get it to compile. I'm using gcc, and ubuntu 32bit precise with libssl-dev installed and at the latest version. The project currently consists of one file, program.c. #include <openssl/evp.h>
...
i = EVP_BytesToKey(EVP_aes_256_cbc(), EVP_sha1() ... );
...
EVP_CIPHER_CTX_init(e_ctx);
 among other various calls. Here is how I invoke gcc: gcc -Wall -g -lssl -lcrypto -o program program.c
 Then I get output like this /home/andy/program/program.c:31: undefined reference to `EVP_sha1'
/home/andy/program/program.c:31: undefined reference to `EVP_aes_256_cbc'
/home/andy/program/program.c:31: undefined reference to `EVP_BytesToKey'
/home/andy/program/program.c:44: undefined reference to `EVP_CIPHER_CTX_init'
 So the include is clearly working: andy@ProgStation2:/usr/include$ find . | grep evp.h
./openssl/evp.h
 Here is the output of locate libcrypto. My best guess is that this is a stupid location for it and is why my link is failing, so I tried -L/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu before -lcrypto with no luck as well. /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libcrypto.so.1.0.0

@TITLE:How to use the NOAA API to query past weather data for a given set of coordinates
@CONTENT:I am trying to retrieve past NOAA data using latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates. I am interested both in historical time series and annual summaries for variables such as temperature, wind speed, cloud fraction, and precipitation. EX: 2008-02-20 13:00 in (25.033972, 121.564493) I hope to automate a process that achieves this for 900,000+ locations. Any ideas? Ideally this script would be written in R or Python.

 I tested it and it works but I don't have a clue how this works! As far as I can see the syntax is wrong. It has an open right bracket and a non closed right bracket which I have marked.

@CONTENT:I've made some headway with the official Google API node client but I've reached a bit of a dead end figuring out how to get my video file up to youtube. I have a video: example.mp4 I have this code: OAuth2Client = googleapis.OAuth2Client;               
var oauth2Client = new OAuth2Client('XXXXXX', 'XXXXXXX', 'http://callback_url');

googleapis.discover('youtube', 'v3').execute(function(err, client) {

  // I think the following is the bones of what I want to do
  client.youtube.videos.insert({}).execute(function(err, client) {
    if (err) console.log(err);
  }); 
});
 I only get an error using the insert method (which I expected with no params passed), the client initialises and returns fine. I'm not sure how to pass the video (in the same directory as the script) to YouTube. Just a pointer would be greatly appreciated.

@TITLE:Issues adding github gist to my blog(using Google blogger)
@CONTENT:I'm trying to add a gist to my blog to see how it works and use it to share some code related blogs going forward. I've followed the steps mentioned form this blog, but I'm not able to get it to work. I don't know what I'm missing, any pointers on what I could be missing would be really appreciated. My HTML Editor of blog related code looks like this:- <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">

 Thanks. UPDATE *(including, changing the code above)* I found one thing confusing for a while, why should I actually paste a div tag in the "Compose" Section of the Blog, it's afterall HTML code, so I moved it to the HTML editor part of the Blog. What was confusing to me initially was when it was mentioned in the blog:- Now to include any gist template just add the following anywhere in your blog post. But anyways, now, I only get "Loading" .., The error still persists..

 When I go to 'Localhost/~benthompson' it works fine. When I was halfway through the tutorial, 'Localhost' did work, its something later on that stopped it working. Presumably its a permissions issue, but where?

@TITLE:Java Enum as generic type in Enum
@CONTENT:i'm trying to create an abstract method in a abstract class that takes my own Enum as argument. But I want also that that enum will be generic. So i declared it like that: public abstract <T extends Enum<T>> void test(Enum<T> command);
 In the implementation, I have en enum as that one: public enum PerspectiveCommands {
        PERSPECTIVE
}
 and the method declaration become: @Override
    public <PerspectiveCommands extends Enum<PerspectiveCommands>> void test(Enum<PerspectiveCommands> command) {

    }
 But if I do: @Override
    public <PerspectiveCommands extends Enum<PerspectiveCommands>> void test(Enum<PerspectiveCommands> command) {
        if(command == PerspectiveCommands.PERSPECTIVE){
            //do something
        }
    }
 I don't have access to the PerspectiveCommands.PERSPECTIVE with the error: cannot find symbol symbol: variable PERSPECTIVE location: class Enum where PerspectiveCommands is a type-variable: PerspectiveCommands extends Enum declared in method test(Enum) I made a workaround like that: public <T extends Enum<T>> byte[] executeCommand(Enum<T> command) throws Exception{
        return executeCommand(command.name());
    }

@Override
    protected byte[] executeCommand(String e) throws Exception{
        switch(PerspectiveCommands.valueOf(e)){
            case PERSPECTIVE:
                return executeCommand(getPerspectiveCommandArray());
            default:
                return null;
        }
    }
 But I would like to know if its possible to not pass by my workaround? Thanks in advance

@TITLE:How can I get the fgcolor attribute to work on recent Android versions?
@CONTENT:I used to be able to do this: <string name="foo">white <font fgcolor="#ff6890a5">blue</font></string>
 But now it doesn't work any more. It seems to be a bug in the integer parsing code; see https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=58192 Problem is, I'm getting customer complaints now; I can't wait for the bug to be fixed. Does anybody know a work-around, such as using named resources from color.xml or something like that? ETA: I've discovered fgcolor="blue" still works, but it's the wrong shade of blue. Is there a list of legal color names somewhere? Maybe I could find one that's close enough. It also works if the color is a number without the high bit set, like #7f6890a5, but of course that's too faint to be useful; I need a solid color, not semi-transparent.

@TITLE:How do I inject a connection string into an instance of IDbContextFactory<T>?
@CONTENT:I'm using Entity Framework 5 with Code First Migrations. I have a DataStore class which derives from DbContext: public class DataStore : DbContext, IDataStore
{
    public int UserID { get; private set; }

    public DataStore(int userId, string connectionString) : base(connectionString)
    {
        UserID = userId;
    }

    public virtual IDbSet<User> Users { get; set; }

    // Rest of code here
}
 And a factory class which creates instances of the DataStore class: public class DataStoreFactory : Disposable, IDataStoreFactory
{
    private DataStore _database;
    private int _userId;
    private string _connectionString;

    public DataStoreFactory(int userId, string connectionString)
    {
        _userId = userId;
        _connectionString = connectionString;
    }

    public IDataStore Get()
    {
        _database = new DataStore(_userId, _connectionString);
        return _database;
    }

    protected override void DisposeCore()
    {
        if (_database != null) _database.Dispose();
    }
}
 These classes have their constructor parameters injected at runtime with Unity. So far so good, everything works great! The problem arises when we get to migrations: because my DataStore context class doesn't have a default constructor, I need to supply an implementation of IDbContextFactory<T> so that Code First Migrations can instantiate it: public class MigrationDataStoreFactory : IDbContextFactory<DataStore>
{
    public DataStore Create()
    {
        // Need to inject connection string so we can pass it to this constructor
        return new DataStore(0, "CONNECTION_STRING_NEEDED_HERE"); 
    }
}
 The issue is that I can't figure out how I can inject the connection string into this class. I can't create a new constructor with a connection string parameter like this: public class MigrationDataStoreFactory : IDbContextFactory<DataStore>
{
    public string _connectionString { get; set; }

    public MigrationDataStoreFactory(string connectionString)
    {
        _connectionString = connectionString;
    }

    public DataStore Create()
    {
        return new DataStore(0, new DateTimeProvider(() => DateTime.Now), _connectionString);
    }
}
 If I do, I get the following exception thrown by Migrations at runtime: [InvalidOperationException: The context factory type 'MigrationDataStoreFactory' must have a public default constructor.]
    System.Data.Entity.Infrastructure.DbContextInfo.CreateActivator() +326

 Aside from that, this class is not instantiated by Unity anyway; it seems to just be called by convention by Code First Migrations somehow, so even if I could do that it wouldn't really help... Everything works fine if I hard-code the connection string in that method, but I don't want to do that, for obvious reasons. Can anyone help please?

@TITLE:Create dynamic queues with Celery
@CONTENT:Here's my scenario: When a user logs in to my website, I queue up a bunch of tasks for the given user (typically each task takes 100s of msecs and there are 100s of tasks per user). These tasks are queued to the default Celery Queue and I have 100s of workers running. I use websockets to show the user real-time progress as the tasks complete on the backend. Life is good if I have just 1 or 2 users active. Now if I a few concurrent users log-in to my site, the latter users are queued behind the initial users and their tasks starve (since all the tasks go to the same queue). My thoughts are to create a dynamic queue per user to ensure fairness. However as per Celery documentation (http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/routing.html#defining-queues), seems I need to be define the queues statically. Any suggestions on best practices for using celery for my scenario?

@CONTENT:I want to check the authorization of the users of my web app when they entered the url. But when I used an individually middleware to check the authorization, it's useless for the already existing routes, such as: function authChecker(req, res, next) {

app.get("/", routes.index);

 The authChecker is unabled to check the authority of the users who entered the two urls. It only works for the unspecified urls. And I saw a method that I can put the authChecker between the route and the route handler, such as: app.get("/", authChecker, routes.index);

@TITLE:Bluetooth connection to LEGO Mindstorms EV3 brick from iOS app
@CONTENT:Does anybody know how to establish a bluetooth connection from a self-written iOS app to the new LEGO Mindstorms EV3 programmable brick? I tried to do this via the scanForPeripheralsWithServices:options: method of CBCentralManager, but the brick is not recognized. But if I enable Bluetooth in the Settings of the iPhone, then the EV3 device is displayed there. There is also an app in the AppStore from LEGO ("Commander") which talks to the brick via Bluetooth, so I think this should be possible in general (as I know, it was not possible for the previous Mindstorms NXT brick). Does anybody have an idea how I can do this? Thanks!

@TITLE:Phonegap not propagating the session cookie
@CONTENT:Using Phonegap-3.0.0+ios6.1, on a real iphone, on a real https domain handling the server side, many responses from different sources lead me to many trials and failures to deal with session cookies, I still cannot handle it correctly on an Iphone5+Phonegap app, although everything works perfectly in Iphone5+Safari. Sources of info & Understanding Cookies-in-PhoneGap. This suggest to use another transport mechanism to exchange the cookie between clients and server. Deal with the cookies on the wire (javascript set:document.cookie=... and get:xhr.getResponseHeader('Set-Cookie')) and keep it in Phonegap-html5-LocalStorage, to fetch it and reset it in the next ajax request. Iphone & Phonegap. I have located this cocoa code in the file app>Classes>AppDelegate.m. I do not think I have to modify it. It seems by default activated. My php server still tell me Your session has timed out, or you have disabled cookies.. I have been dealing with this client-server for months in different contexts, always worked, until phonegap came into the picture. Questions From the web readings, phonegap should already be set to go for cookie support. Right or not ? Does Phonegap really handle cookies by default (as is when creating a project) ? Is cookie handling transport mechanism must be implemented by the developer ? Thanks in advance.

var query = Query<Node>.EQ(e => e.Id, id);

@CONTENT:I have a huge array that contains reference type elements, and I want to create a lot of other arrays that essentially just point to specific parts of that one big array. In other words, I want to create "indexers" or "pointers with lengths". In C++ it's easy to do so using pointers and for each pointer assign a length, for example create a struct which contains a pointer with a length. How can I achieve this in C#/.NET? The whole point is to avoid copying anything, I just want pointers to specific parts in an array that already exists in memory. Any ideas?

Usually the XSD file is importing many other XSD files and so on. I am writing a GUI with XForm builder. When the user builds his custom XForm I need to generate from it an XSD file and send it back to the outer server. Major question is: Is it possible to write those two converters which generate files and complies with the standard (XML Schema and XForms)? Do you know any existing library offering conversion between those two formats: XSD and XHTML? It is important to mention that all constraints (not empty, numeric value, etc) need to be transformed as well. I have only basic knowledge about XML technologies (XLS, XPath, XQuery...) so any suggestion will be helpful.

@CONTENT:In case I have multiple subdirectories under 'js' directory in the example Gruntfile posted below, and want to retain the subdirectories under a different destination directory, how do I do it? For e.g. module.exports = function (grunt) {

       // define source files and their destinations
       uglify: {

    // load plugins
    grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-uglify');

    // register at least this one task
    grunt.registerTask('default', [ 'uglify' ]);

 In this case, I have shown */.js, but even if I explicitly specify a single subdirectory like js/xyz/*.js then also it is not copying the directory structure, instead it seems to put the files within subdirectory under minJs/ folder in the example. What am I missing here? Please help. Thanks, Paddy

@TITLE:wait for angular app to be fully rendered from phantom script
@CONTENT:I'm writing a script which generates png images from every page of my frontend. I'm using angular for the UI and capturing the pages with phantom. The view take a while until angular finish rendering it so I have to wait a little before capturing: var page = require('webpage').create();
page.open('http://localhost:9000/', function () {
  window.setTimeout(function () {
    page.render('snapshot.png');
    phantom.exit();
  }, 2000);
});
 I wonder if there is a better way to achieve this. I found angular can emit an event when the page is fully rendered: $scope.$on('$viewContentLoaded', function () {
  // do something
});
 And found a way for communicate to phantom with onCallback so I could write something like: $scope.$on('$viewContentLoaded', function () {
  window.callPhantom({ hello: 'world' });
});
 Then in other place in phantom script: page.onCallback = function() {
  page.render('snapshot.png');
  phantom.exit();
};
 But I'm lost in how to inject the angular $viewContentLoaded handle from the phantom script. I don't know if evaluate/evalueateAsyn are the way to go ... page.evaluateAsync(function () {
  $scope.$on('$viewContentLoaded', function () {
    window.callPhantom({ hello: 'world' });
  });
});
 Maybe I could access the right $scope in some way. Any ideas?
@CODE:var page = require('webpage').create();
page.open('http://localhost:9000/', function () {
  window.setTimeout(function () {
    page.render('snapshot.png');
    phantom.exit();
  }, 2000);
}); $scope.$on('$viewContentLoaded', function () {
  // do something
}); onCallback $scope.$on('$viewContentLoaded', function () {
  window.callPhantom({ hello: 'world' });
}); page.onCallback = function() {
  page.render('snapshot.png');
  phantom.exit();
}; $viewContentLoaded evaluate evalueateAsyn page.evaluateAsync(function () {

@TITLE:Android: how to clear app cache and keep user data via adb?
@CONTENT:I'm running some automated tests (with calabash-android) on an Android app and I need to programatically trigger a clear of the app's cache, but not user data. I found that the adb shell pm clear solution is not adequate, since it clears user data (which includes login details). Is there any way to achieve this externally to the app (i.e. without code changes)?

@TITLE:Billdesk payment gateway integration for iOS
@CONTENT:Have done some exploration on available payment gateway APIs for iOS and came across 3 whose names cropped up quite a lot: 1) PayPal 2) Stripe 3) Braintree But my requirement is Billdesk Payment Gateway integration in an iOS app. After doing quite a lot of googling and reading blogs, I still have no evidence of Billdesk being used in mobile apps. In fact, even for desktops could find only a couple of links describing how Billdesk payment gateway can be integrated with desktop apps. So my questions are, can Billdesk payment gateway be integrated with iOS apps? If so, can anyone please provide the appropriate info, links? And if so does Billdesk have a mobile optimized payment gateway or iOS compatible API? And is the web services same in that case(Payment request format and response format)? Sorry for so many questions, but am unable to find a definitive answer so far.

@LINK:/questions/18569840/why-are-function-template-specializations-not-allowed-inside-a-class
@TITLE:Why are function template specializations not allowed inside a class?
@CONTENT:After having found answers to many of my questions on stackoverflow, I have now come up against a question of which I can't find the answer and I hope that someone is willing to help me! My problem is that I want to do an explicit templatization of a function inside a class in C++. My compiler (g++) and a look in the C++ standard (14.7.3) tells me that this specialization has to be done in the namespace in which the class is declared. I understand that this implies that I cannot put the specialization inside the class, but I don't see the point of this restriction! Does anyone know if there is a good reason for not letting the specializations be made inside the class? I know that there are workarounds, e.g. to put the function inside a struct, but I want to understand why the language has this design. If there is a good reason for not allowing specialized functions inside the class, I guess I should know it before trying to work around it. Thanks in advance! To make my question a little bit more precise: Here is some code from a test example which illustrates what I want to do: #include <cstdio>

namespace MalinTester {

template <size_t DIMENSIONALITY>
class SpecializationTest {
public:
    SpecializationTest() {
        privateVariable = 5;
    };
    virtual ~SpecializationTest() {};

    void execute() {
        execute<DIMENSIONALITY>();
    };

private:
    int privateVariable;
    template <size_t currentDim>
    static void execute() {
        printf("This is the general case. Current dim is %d. The private variable is %d.\n", currentDim, privateVariable);
        execute<currentDim-1>();
    }

    template <>
    static void execute<0>() {
        printf("This is the base case. Current dim is 0.\n");
    }

};
 This is not possible; g++ says: SpecializationTest_fcn.h:27: error: explicit specialization in non-namespace scope class MalinTester::SpecializationTest<DIMENSIONALITY>
SpecializationTest_fcn.h:28: error: template-id execute<0> in declaration of primary template
 If I put the function execute outside the class, in the name space MalinTester, it will look like this: #include <cstdio>

namespace MalinTester {

    template <size_t DIMENSIONALITY> class SpecializationTest {};

    template <size_t currentDim>
    void execute() {
        printf("This is the general case. Current dim is %d. The private variable is %d.\n", currentDim, privateVariable);
        execute<currentDim-1>();
    }

    template <>
    void execute<0>() {
        printf("This is the base case. Current dim is 0.\n");
    }

    template <size_t DIMENSIONALITY>
    class SpecializationTest {
    public:
        SpecializationTest() {};
        virtual ~SpecializationTest() {};

        void execute() {
            MalinTester::execute<DIMENSIONALITY>();
        };
    private:
        int privateVariable = 5;
    };
};
};
 and I cannot use privatevariable in the templatized versions of execute, as it is private in the class. I really want it private, as I want to have my data encapsulated as far as possible. Of course I can send privateVariable as an argument to the function, but I think it would be more beautiful to avoid this, and what I really wonder is if there is a good reason for the C++ standard not to allow explicit specialization as in the first code example above. @Arne Mertz: This is the workaround I have tried, but it doesn't allow using privateVariable either. And most of all, I wonder if it is a good idea to do like this. As I'm not allowed to make specializations of member functions, maybe I shouldn't do specializations of functions encapsulated in structs inside the class either. #include <cstdio>

namespace MalinTester {

template <size_t DIMENSIONALITY>
class SpecializationTest {
public:
    SpecializationTest() {
        privateVariable = 5;
    };
    virtual ~SpecializationTest() {};

    };

@TITLE:Golang Formatter and Vim - How to destroy history record?
@CONTENT:Go (Golang) programming language comes with a tool called go fmt. Its a code formatter, which formats your code automagically (alignments, alphabetic sorting, tabbing, spacing, idioms...). Its really awesome. So I've found this little autocommand which utilizes it in Vim, each time buffer is saved to file. au FileType go au BufWritePre <buffer> Fmt Fmt is a function that comes with Go vim plugin. This is really great, but it has 1 problem. Each time formatter writes to buffer, it creates a jump in undo/redo history. Which becomes very painful when trying to undo/redo changes, since every 2nd change is formatter (making cursor jump to line 1). So I am wondering, is there any way to discard latest change from undo/redo history after triggering Fmt? EDIT: Ok, so far I have: au FileType go au BufWritePre <buffer> undojoin | Fmt But its not all good yet. According to :h undojoin, undojoin is not allowed after undo. And sure enough, it fires an error when I try to :w after an undo. So how do I achieve something like this pseudo-code: if lastAction != undo then
    au FileType go au BufWritePre <buffer> undojoin | Fmt
end
 If I get this last bit figured out, I think I have a solution.
@CODE:go fmt au FileType go au BufWritePre <buffer> Fmt Fmt au FileType go au BufWritePre <buffer> undojoin | Fmt :h undojoin :w if lastAction != undo then
    au FileType go au BufWritePre <buffer> undojoin | Fmt

Sometimes, however, I use ? to jump to an item just a few lines above the line I'm currently at, and in that case, if I want to search the same item forwards, I have to use N instead of n, an annoying mental speed bump.

 and I'm so confused that non-dfs Used takes up more than half of capacity, which I think means half of hadoop storage is being wasted After spending meaningless time searching, I just formatted namenode, and started from scratch. And then I copied one huge text file(about 19gigabytes) from local to HDFS (successed). Now the UI says Configured Capacity  :   232.5 GB
DFS Used     :   38.52 GB
Non DFS Used     :   45.35 GB

DFS Used%    :   16.57 %
DFS Remaining%   :   63.92 %
 before copying, DFS Used and Non DFS Used were both 0. Because DFS Used is approximately double the original text file size and I configured 2 copy, I guess that DFS Used is composed up of 2 copies of original and meta. But still I don't have any idea where Non DFS Used came from and why is that takes up so much capcity more than DFS Used. What happend? Did I made mistake?

@CONTENT:Does anyone have a method for importing a 16 bit per channel, 3 channel TIFF image in Python? I have yet to find a method which will preserve the 16 bit depth per channel when dealing with the TIFF format. I am hoping that some helpful soul will have a solution. Here is a list of what I have tried so far without success and the results: import numpy as np
import PIL.Image as Image
import libtiff
import cv2

im = Image.open('a.tif')
# IOError: cannot identify image file

tif = libtiff.TIFF.open('a.tif')
im = tif.read_image()
# im only contains one of the three channels. im.dtype is uint16 as desired.
im = []
for i in tif.iter_images():
    # still only returns one channel

im = np.array(cv2.imread('a.tif'))
# im.dtype is uint8 and not uint16 as desired.
# specifying dtype as uint16 does not correct this
 So far the only solution I have found is to convert the image to PNG with ImageMagick. Then the bog standard matplotlib.pyplot.imread reads the PNG file without any problems. Another problem I have is saving any numpy arrays as 16 bit PNG files which so far has not been straightforward either.
@CODE:import numpy as np
import PIL.Image as Image

In some cases I want to be able to basically just return a completely random distribution, and in other cases I want to return values that fall in the shape of a gaussian.

@LINK:/questions/18408599/how-to-serialize-any-object-into-a-uri
@TITLE:How to serialize ANY Object into a URI?
@CONTENT:My basic question: is there anything built that already does this automatically (doesn't have to be part of a popular library/package)? The main things I'm working with are Spring (MVC) and Jackson2. I understand there are a few manual ways to do this: Create a method in each class that serializes its specific properties into property=value& form (kind of stinks because it's a bunch of logic duplication, I feel). Create a function that accepts an object, and uses reflection to dynamically read all the properties (I guess the getters), and build the string by getting each. I'm assuming this is how Jackson works for serialization/deserialization in general, but I really don't know. Use some feature of Jackson to customly serialize the object. I've researched custom serializers, but it seems they are specific to a class (so I'd have to create one for each Class I'm trying to serialize), while I was hoping for a generic way. I'm just having trouble understanding how to apply one universally to objects. A few of the links: http://techtraits.com/Programming/2011/11/20/using-custom-serializers-with-jackson/ http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHowToCustomSerializers Use ObjectMapper.convertValue(object, HashMap.class);, iterate over the HashMap's key/value pairs, and build the string (which is what I'm using now, but I feel the conversions are excessive?). I'm guessing there's others I'm not thinking of. The main post I've looked into is Java: Getting the properties of a class to construct a string representation My point is that I have several classes that I want to be able to serialize without having to specify something specific for each. That's why I'm thinking a function using reflection (#2 above) is the only way to handle this (if I have to do it manually). If it helps, an example of what I mean is with, say, these two classes: public class C1 {
    private String C1prop1;
    private String C1prop2;
    private String C1prop3;

    // Getters and setters for the 3 properties
}

public class C2 {
    private String C2prop1;
    private String C2prop2;
    private String C2prop3;

    // Getters and setters for the 3 properties
}
 (no, the properties names and conventions are not what my actual app is using, it's just an example) The results of serializing would be C1prop1=value&C1prop2=value&C1prop3=value and C2prop1=value&C2prop2=value&C2prop3=value, but there's only one place that defines how the serialization happens (already defined somewhere, or created manually by me). So my idea is that I will have to end up using a form of the following (taken from the post I linked above): public String toString() {
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    try {
        Class c = Class.forName(this.getClass().getName());
        Method m[] = c.getDeclaredMethods();
        Object oo;
        for (int i = 0; i < m.length; i++)
        if (m[i].getName().startsWith("get")) {
            oo = m[i].invoke(this, null);
            sb.append(m[i].getName().substring(3) + ":"
                      + String.valueOf(oo) + "\n");
        }
    } catch (Throwable e) {
        System.err.println(e);
    }
    return sb.toString();
}
 And modify it to accept an object, and change the format of the items appended to the StringBuilder. That works for me, I don't need help modifying this now. So again, my main question is if there's something that already handles this (potentially simple) serialization instead of me having to (quickly) modify the function above, even if I have to specify how to deal with each property and value and how to combine each? If it helps, the background of this is that I'm using a RestTemplate (Spring) to make a GET request to a different server, and I want to pass a specific object's properties/values in the URL. I understand I can use something like: restTemplate.getForObject("URL?C1prop1={C1Prop1}&...", String.class, C1Object);
 I believe the properties will be automatically mapped. But like I said, I don't want to have to make a different URL template and method for each object type. I'm hoping to have something like the following: public String getRequest(String url, Object obj) {
    String serializedUri = SERIALIZE_URI(obj);
    String response = restTemplate.getForObject("URL?" + serializedUri, String.class);
    return response;
}
 where SERIALIZE_URI is where I'd handle it. And I could call it like getRequest("whatever", C1Object); and getRequest("whateverElse", C2Object);.
@CODE:property=value& ObjectMapper.convertValue(object, HashMap.class); HashMap public class C1 {
    private String C1prop1;
    private String C1prop2;
    private String C1prop3;

    // Getters and setters for the 3 properties
}

public class C2 {
    private String C2prop1;
    private String C2prop2;
    private String C2prop3;

    // Getters and setters for the 3 properties
} C1prop1=value&C1prop2=value&C1prop3=value C2prop1=value&C2prop2=value&C2prop3=value public String toString() {
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    try {
        Class c = Class.forName(this.getClass().getName());
        Method m[] = c.getDeclaredMethods();
        Object oo;
        for (int i = 0; i < m.length; i++)
        if (m[i].getName().startsWith("get")) {
            oo = m[i].invoke(this, null);
            sb.append(m[i].getName().substring(3) + ":"

        }
    } catch (Throwable e) {
        System.err.println(e);
    }
    return sb.toString();

@TITLE:What is the right way to multiply data frame by vector?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to multiply a data frame df by a vector v, so that the product is a data frame, where the i-th row is given by df[i,]*v. I can do this, for example, by df <- data.frame(A=1:5, B=2:6); v <- c(0,2)
as.data.frame(t(t(df) * v))
   A  B
1  0  4
2  0  6

5  0 12
 I am sure there has to be a more R-style approach (and a very simple one!), but nothing comes on my mind. I even tried something like apply(df, MARGIN=1, function(x) x*v)
 but still, non-readable constructions like as.data.frame(t(.)) are required. How can I find an efficient and elegant workaround here?
@CODE:df v i df[i,]*v df <- data.frame(A=1:5, B=2:6); v <- c(0,2)
as.data.frame(t(t(df) * v))

@CONTENT:I'm incredibly new to programming, and I've been learning well enough so far, I think, but I still can't get a grasp around the idea of making a delay the way I want. What I'm working on is a sort of test "game" thingy using a Windows forms application that involves a combat system. In it, I want to make an NPC that does an action every couple of seconds. The problem is, I also want to allow the player to interact between attacks. Thread.sleep really doesn't seem to work for me not only because I don't know how to multithread, but whenever I try to run it, say, like this:  textBox1.Text += "\r\nThread Sleeps!";
 System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(4000);
 textBox1.Text += "\r\nThread awakens!";
 It seems to insist on sleeping first, then printing both lines. I think that's all I can say at the moment, but if that's still too vague or wordy, feel free to tell me. In short, In C# I want to make something delay before running but at the same time still allow user interaction.

 After this we can get, decimal 5 encoded as BinC [One,Zero,One] But I think I am missing something here. My solution seems not as clever as the Church's solution. No surprise, I am not Church. Little bit of thinking, I found that my solution depends upon list, whereas the Nat doesn't depend upon any such external structure like list. Can we write a solution that is similar to Church's using a Succ type constructor for Binary numbers too? If yes, how? I tried a lot, but it seems my brain cannot get rid of the need of list or some other such structure.

@CONTENT:I am building a client/server solution, using an AngularJS Single Page App as the client component and a Self-Host ServiceStack RESTful API as the server component. A single Visual Studio Console Application Project holds HTML and JavaScript files for the AngularJS component, along with C# classes for bootstrapping the ServiceStack AppHost (I have devolved Interface and Service responsibilities to separate Visual Studio Projects). I have set all HTML and JavaScript files to have a 'Build Action' of 'None' and a 'Copy to Output Directory' of 'Copy if newer'. Everything is working very well as long as I am prepared to put up with having a '#' in my site URLs. I would like to eliminate this by using HTML5 pushstate URLs. Effectively this means I need to persuade ServiceStack to serve up my default Single Page App HTML shell page whenever a non-existent route is requested. There is now a FallbackRoute attribute available in ServiceStack which appears to have been added exactly for this purpose. However, I am unsure how to use it. I have found people asking similar questions here, here and here. But the answers given were all before the new FallbackRoute attribute arrived. Essentially, I am looking for a simple, yet complete example of how to use the FallbackRoute attribute to ensure any requests to non-existent routes are redirected to a single static HTML page.

@TITLE:When does ActiveRecord establish connections?
@CONTENT:In some of my Rails applications, my ActiveRecord models seem to establish db connections on initialization (e.g., when I do rails console), while in others connections seem to be established only when I reference the model class or instantiate a model object. For example, I just went to one application, opened Rails console and wrote: SomeModel.connected?
 and it returned false. I went to another application, entered the same command (for a different model), and it returned true. I went to a third application and entered the same command. This time, it waited a moment and then returned true, which made me think that the connected? method triggered the connection for some reason. This difference in behavior doesn't seem related to Rails versions or the contents of the models. It could be something weird I've done in my initializers, but I don't think so. So when does Rails establish connections? Or what is the expected behavior? ADDITIONAL INFO I'll add that it doesn't seem like connected? returns false because Rails cannot connect to the database. For example, in my first application I do: SomeModel.connected?
# => false
SomeModel.table_exists? # or any other command that makes Rails look at db
# => true
SomeModel.connected?
# => true

@TITLE:Understanding Backbone and Marionette View lifecycle
@CONTENT:I'm new to this world and I need to understand some of the concepts of Backbone and Marionette. Here I'm trying to explain some of the concepts I'm learning. It would be great to having some feedback on them. The render function defines the logic for rendering a template. When it is finished, the onRender callback is called. Here I suppose the rendered view has been not attached to the DOM. It is composed by a tagName (the default is div) that contains the template I attached to it. To explicitly insert that tag into the DOM I need to append it somewhere. Am I wrong? In general, I do the following. var view = new MyView();
view.render();
$("container").append(view.$el);?
 Marionette extends Backbone with the concept of regions. The show method can be called on a region to present a specific view. var view = new MyView();
region.show(view);
 In this case, the show method will be call the render function on its own and finally, when the content of the view will be put in the DOM, the onShow is called on that view. Is it ok? From Marionette doc there is also another callback called onDomRefresh. From my experiments, I've noticed that this method is called before onShow. So, my supposition is that the view has not been attached to the DOM yet. But the doc says the following. Triggered after the view has been rendered, has been shown in the DOM via a Marionette.Region, and has been re-rendered. Could you give some hints on it? Thanks in advance.
@CODE:render onRender tagName div var view = new MyView();
view.render();
$("container").append(view.$el);? show var view = new MyView();
region.show(view); show render onShow onDomRefresh onShow

@CONTENT:My use case is very simple - to exchange few (< 100) messages between two objects, Scala actors were excellent for this purpose (light weight, no complicated life cycle management, start/terminate at any time). Now I am migrating from Scala Actors to Akka, however I can no longer find those light weight Actors! With Akka, not only I need to create ActorSystem/Props for Actor creation, but also need to take care of the life cycle of ActorSystem. Is there an Akka Actor which does not require complicated ActorSystem life cycle management?

I am not exactly sure how tess4j is meant to work, but since it comes with a tessdata folder, I can assume that you would put the language data files there.

@LINK:/questions/18065994/how-can-like-seek-on-an-index
@TITLE:How can LIKE '%K' seek on an index?
@CONTENT:I would expect these two SELECTs to have the same execution plan and performance. Since there is a leading wildcard on the LIKE, I expect an index scan. When I run this and look at the plans, the first SELECT behaves as expected (with a scan). But the second SELECT plan shows an index seek, and runs 20 times faster. Code: -- Uses index scan, as expected:
SELECT 1
    FROM AccountAction
    WHERE AccountNumber LIKE '%441025586401'

-- Uses index seek somehow, and runs much faster:
declare @empty VARCHAR(30) = ''
SELECT 1
    FROM AccountAction
    WHERE AccountNumber LIKE '%441025586401' + @empty
 Question: How does SQL Server use an index seek when the pattern starts with a wildcard? Bonus question: Why does concatenating an empty string change/improve the execution plan? Details: There is a non-clustered index on Accounts.AccountNumber There are other indexes, but both the seek and the scan are on this index. The Accounts.AccountNumber column is a nullable varchar(30) The server is SQL Server 2012 Table and index definitions: CREATE TABLE [updatable].[AccountAction](

 I can page forwards correctly until the end. But I can't page backwards until the last page and even then I can't page back until the first page neither. What am I missing please? UPDATE: Changed code with Faisal's suggestions. It works better I must admit. But still the paging doesn't work correctly: I have 7 entries. PAGE_SIZE in config is 3. Hence we get three pages: When clicking on Next I get 7,6,5 -> 4,3,2 -> 1 Perfect. Now when clicking on previous: 1 -> 3,4,5 (?) -> 5,6,7 (?)

@TITLE:Android - Set Layout_Gravity programmatically for LinearLayout
@CONTENT:I've got the following problem: I implemented a HorizontalScrollView which contains in one case a LinearLayout and an ImageView. In this case the image is about 50% of the screen width. So I want to center it. Unfortunately the only way I found to center it is, to use layout_gravity="center" on the LinearLayout. Here's my xml: <HorizontalScrollView
            android:layout_gravity="center"
            android:layout_width="fill_parent"
            android:layout_height="wrap_content">

        <LinearLayout
                android:orientation="horizontal"
                android:layout_width="wrap_content"
                android:layout_height="wrap_content">

        <ImageView                    
                android:src="@drawable/myImg"
                android:layout_width="wrap_content"
                android:adjustViewBounds="true"
                android:layout_height="150dp"/>

        </LinearLayout>

    </HorizontalScrollView>
 But I need to set the layout_gravity programmatically. Does anybody has an idea how I can achieve this or knows a different way? All the things I found via Google are not working for me like this post. Thanks!

What I want is just to go on executing my gdb script without stopping. Is it possible? This is a test program and a test gdb script that demonstrates my problem.

@LINK:/questions/17895698/updating-the-x-axis-values-using-matplotlib-animation
@TITLE:Updating the x-axis values using matplotlib animation
@CONTENT:I am trying to use matplotlib.ArtistAnimation to animate two subplots. I want the x-axis to increase in value as the animation progresses, such that the total length of the animation is 100 but at any time the subplot is only presenting me with the time values from 0-24 and then iterates up to 100. A great example is given here. The link uses FuncAnimation and updates the x-axis labels in a rolling fashion using plot().axes.set_xlim() and incrementing the x-values. The code is available via the link below the YouTube video in the link provided. I have appended code below that shows my attempts to replicate these results but the x-limits seem to take on their final values instead of incrementing with time. I have also tried incrementing the solution (as opposed to the axis) by only plotting the values in the window that will be seen in the subplot, but that does not increment the x-axis values. I also tried to implement autoscaling but the x-axis still does not update. I also found this question which is virtually the same problem, but the question was never answered. Here is my code: import matplotlib.pylab as plt
import matplotlib.animation as anim
import numpy as np

#create image with format (time,x,y)
image = np.random.rand(100,10,10)

#setup figure
fig = plt.figure()
ax1=fig.add_subplot(1,2,1)
ax2=fig.add_subplot(1,2,2)
#set up viewing window (in this case the 25 most recent values)
repeat_length = (np.shape(image)[0]+1)/4
ax2.set_xlim([0,repeat_length])
#ax2.autoscale_view()
ax2.set_ylim([np.amin(image[:,5,5]),np.amax(image[:,5,5])])

#set up list of images for animation

ims=[]
for time in xrange(np.shape(image)[0]):

    im = ax1.imshow(image[time,:,:])
    im2, = ax2.plot(image[0:time,5,5],color=(0,0,1))
    if time>repeat_length:
        lim = ax2.set_xlim(time-repeat_length,time)

    ims.append([im, im2])


#run animation
ani = anim.ArtistAnimation(fig,ims, interval=50,blit=False)
plt.show()
 I only want the second subplot (ax2) to update the x-axis values. Any help would be much appreciated.

@TITLE:adjusting axis labels NVD3 graph in rCharts
@CONTENT:I am using the rCharts nPlot() function to display stacked or grouped bar charts given contingency table type data. The "multiBarChart" is displayed in a shiny application. A piece of the code that I use in my shiny application is given below.     graphData <- reactive({
    as.data.frame(table(eval(inputVar1()),eval(inputVar2())))
    })

    output$myChart <- renderChart({
    p1 <- nPlot(Freq ~ Var1, group="Var2", data=graphData(), type="multiBarChart")
    p1$addParams(dom='myChart')
    return(p1)
    })
 In my dataset, one categorical variable has 16 levels. When this variable is displayed along the x-axis of the "multiBarChart", not all labels are shown. Is there a way in nPlot to adjust the font size of axis labels? I'm thinking something like cex.axis=0.5 or cex.lab=0.5 or something like that. Alternatively, is there a parameter like las= which would allow me to rotate the axis label 90 degrees and perhaps have a cleaner plot where all labels of categorical variables are displayed along the x-axis of the plot. Any advice the group could provide is greatly appreciated!!
@CODE:nPlot() graphData <- reactive({
    as.data.frame(table(eval(inputVar1()),eval(inputVar2())))

@TITLE:Generating a random number within range of 0-9 in x86 8086 Assembly
@CONTENT:First of all, I am very new to 8086 Assembly and it has been pretty difficult for me the grab the knowledge. Nevertheless, I'll do my best. I have been trying to write a code to generate a random number within range of 0-9. After looking into several examples and suggestion, this is what I ended up with. I did not apply any mathematical function on the retrieved clock count, for simplicity and also I thought it was unnecessary. I ended up with, for some reasons, generating certain number like 6,7 fewer times than numbers such as 1,3 and 9. I believe it is because I'm taking the lower order of the clock ticks, where the values change so rapidly. My purpose is to simulate a dice roll which later ill change the range of below codes to 1-6. My question is, Is this adequate enough for my purpose? or is there any better way to do this? codes: RANDGEN:        ; generate a rand no using the system time
RANDSTART:
   MOV AH, 00h  ; interrupts to get system time        
   INT 1AH      ; CX:DX now hold number of clock ticks since midnight      
                ; lets just take the lower bits of DL for a start..
   MOV BH, 57   ; set limit to 57 (ASCII for 9) 
   MOV AH, DL  
   CMP AH, BH   ; compare with value in  DL,      
   JA RANDSTART ; if more, regenerate. if not, continue... 

   MOV BH, 49   ; set limit to 48 (ASCII FOR 0)
   MOV AH, DL   
   CMP AH, BH   ; compare with value in DL
   JB RANDSTART ; if less, regenerate.   


   ; if not, this is what we need 
   mov ah, 2h   ; call interrupt to display a value in DL
   int 21h    
RET
 Answer, by @johnfound: I found his way is simpler, and takes less time to generate the random number. He mentioned that this works only if you need one single random numbers, or the interval between the random numbers includes pauses for human input. If not, the numbers will not be random at all (I believe due to the time seed that we initially take doesn't change). It is fine for my case, since I am simulating a roll dice, and I need the user intervention (another roll) before I will be running the code again. RANDGEN:         ; generate a rand no using the system time
RANDSTART:
   MOV AH, 00h  ; interrupts to get system time        
   INT 1AH      ; CX:DX now hold number of clock ticks since midnight      

   mov  ax, dx
   xor  dx, dx
   mov  cx, 10    
   div  cx       ; here dx contains the remainder of the division - from 0 to 9

   add  dl, '0'  ; to ascii from '0' to '9'
   mov ah, 2h   ; call interrupt to display a value in DL
   int 21h    
RET    
 What he did: 1.We moved value in DX to AX 2.We cleared DX. 3.We moved 10 dec to CX. 4.We divided AX by CX hence we get a remainder within 0-9 Dec which is stored in DX 5.Finally, we added ASCII '0' (dec 48) to DX to get them into ASCII '0' to '9'.

@TITLE:Gaussian Blur - standard deviation, radius and kernel size
@CONTENT:I've implemented a gaussian blur fragment shader in GLSL. I understand the main concepts behind all of it: convolution, separation of x and y using linearity, multiple passes to increase radius... I still have a few questions though: What's the relationship between sigma and radius? I've read that sigma is equivalent to radius, I don't see how sigma is expressed in pixels. Or is "radius" just a name for sigma, not related to pixels? How do I choose sigma? Considering I use multiple passes to increase sigma, how do I choose a good sigma to obtain the sigma I want at any given pass? If the resulting sigma is equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of the sigmas and sigma is equivalent to radius, what's an easy way to get any desired radius? What's the good size for a kernel, and how does it relate to sigma? I've seen most implementations use a 5x5 kernel. This is probably a good choice for a fast implementation with decent quality, but is there another reason to choose another kernel size? How does sigma relate to the kernel size? Should I find the best sigma so that coefficients outside my kernel are negligible and just normalize?

Table 1 will seat worker numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.
Table 2 will seat worker numbers 9.10,11,12,13,14,15,16
...
Table 50 will seat worker numbers 313,314,315,316,317,318,319,320


**NOTE:**
(So, the next workday and thereafter, workers 1 through 8 cannot ever be seated with 
any other workers from that same set until all possible permutations have been
exhausted).

Day 2:

Table 1 will seat worker numbers 1,17,18,19,20,21,22,23
Table 2 will seat worker numbers 2,10,24,25,26,27,28,29
...
Table 50 will seat worker numbers 305,306,307,308,309,310,311,312


Day N: 
.
.
...
.
 None of the worker numbers (elements) can repeat in each set (array) of 8 workers until all possible unique sets (permutations) have been exhausted. Then the cycle starts all over again, perhaps shifting the elements, only then, a worker would be seated with another worker they've met before. I would then want to email each worker as to what table they've been assigned to sit at the next work day. Each worker will not know who else is sittibg at their assigned table until they arrive at the table. Only I will have the complete roster for the seating arrangements. (It's sort of a "Musical Chairs" game) This is not an excersise or school assignment. A friend who uses the APL programming language told me she could generate the desired results with one line of code, but we only use SQL-based DBMS' (IBM Informix 11.70 and Oracle 11). So I have an SQL table with the following columns: employee.id        INT      {unique primary key}
employee.FullName  VARCHAR
...
 The following one line of APL programming code generates matrix permutations: pmat2{{,[?2](???io,1+?)?????.=??1+1??}?????}
 In SQL, can I generate the desired results with one SELECT statement, do I need multiple SELECT INTO TEMP statements, or is a stored procedure required to obtain the desired results? What should my SELECT statement/s or SP look like? EDIT: If the desired result is not feasable with SQL, could it be accomplished with a 3GL like c#?
@CODE:Day 1: 

Table 1 will seat worker numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.
Table 2 will seat worker numbers 9.10,11,12,13,14,15,16

@CONTENT:I have a model with some date and time properties. The time properties have the following DataAnnotation: [DisplayFormat(ApplyFormatInEditMode = true, DataFormatString = "{0:hh:mm tt}")]

@TITLE:Make the ProgressRing in MahApps.Metro Smaller
@CONTENT:It looks like the MahApps.Metro ProgressRing control defaults to a Minimum size of 60x60. There is a property for the ProgressRing called "IsLarge", but even when it is set to "False" it seems to have no effect on being able to make to ProgressRing smaller than 60x60. Obiviously changing the Height and Width properties do not affect this either. Looking on GitHUb as the actual c# code for the ProgressRing, it looks like there are several properties to affect ellipse diameter, etc, but these properties are private properties, and can not be set from outside calls. How can I make this smaller? Say 20x20 or 30x30? In the below code I specify IsLarge=False, and set the size to 30x30, but it still defaults to 60x60. <Window x:Class="WpfApplication3.MainWindow"

@TITLE:Passing data from view controller to tab bar controller in iOS
@CONTENT:I'm developing an iOS app and now I'm at a loss. I'm trying to pass data from the first View Controller to the first tab of a TabBarViewController (with using the storyboard). I found a lot of tutorials that explain how to pass data between view controllers, but nothing worked with my tab bar. I know that the tab bar controller contains a kind of array of views. The relation between the View Controller and the Tab Bar Controller is realized using a segue (push). So, I thought it is easy to use the prepareForSegue() - method. Like that:  - (void)prepareForSegue:(UIStoryboardSegue *)segue sender:(id)sender{
 if ([[segue identifier] isEqualToString:@"tab"]) {

 // ...

    } 
 }  
 Unfortunately, the relation between the Tab Bar Controller and each tab bar view is no real segue. It's only a "relationship". That means, there is no segue identifier I am able to use for the the method above-mentioned. Is there a possibility to use the prepareForSegue in this case? If not, any ideas how to solve this problem? I know that there is a similar question, but the answer wasn't that helpful. Do I have to create a new file for every tab (view) within the tab bar controller? Or is it possible to have one class (m. & h.) for the whole tab bar controller, accessing the several view with objectAtIndex()? Thanks in advance!

 prints without a print dialog which is what i am after but this will print a blank page to the printer. Now may aim is to use only one of these codes but i have supplied what i have tried. I need to have code 1 working but with no printerDialog. if i do remove the printerDialog from code 1 then basically it does the same the same as code 2 (prints blank on this printer). I beleive the issue is with the parameters passed in code one from PrintService service = ServiceUI.printDialog(null, 200, 200, printService, defaultService, DocFlavor.INPUT_STREAM.GIF, pras); not been passed anymore Is there anyway of passing the parameters from PrintService service = ServiceUI.printDialog(null, 200, 200, printService, defaultService, DocFlavor.INPUT_STREAM.GIF, pras); into the printer without using a dialog or is there a way of skipping the dialog as though the user has clicked yes? Apologise firstly for the VERY long post. Hope anyone can help, or give me some advise. Thank you in advance

@TITLE:Multiple databases(datacontext) on same server without MS DTC
@CONTENT:I'm using EF5.0 with SQL server 2008. I have two databases on the same server instance. I need to update tables on both databases and want them to be same transaction. So I used the TransactionScope. Below is the code - public void Save()
{
        var MSObjectContext = ((IObjectContextAdapter)MSDataContext).ObjectContext;
        var AWObjectContext = ((IObjectContextAdapter)AwContext).ObjectContext;

        using (var scope = new TransactionScope(TransactionScopeOption.Required,
                                             new TransactionOptions
                                                 {
                                                     IsolationLevel = IsolationLevel.ReadUncommitted
                                                 }))
        {               
            MSObjectContext.SaveChanges(SaveOptions.DetectChangesBeforeSave);
            AWObjectContext.SaveChanges(SaveOptions.DetectChangesBeforeSave);

            scope.Complete();
        }
    }
 When I use the above code Transaction gets promoted to DTC. After searching on internet I found that this happens because of two different connectionstrings / connections. But what I dont understand is if I write a stored procedure on one database which updates table in a different database (on same server) no DTC is required. Then why EF or TransactionScope is promoting this to DTC? Is there any other work around for this? Please advise Thanks in advance Sai

@LINK:/questions/17687972/connecting-predefined-html-to-models-and-views-in-backbone
@TITLE:Connecting predefined HTML to Models and Views in Backbone
@CONTENT:I'm starting out with Backbone.js so I must say I'm not yet very familiar with the concepts. I have predefined HTML and I want to use Backbone to manage this. This is important and I want to keep it like this. Say this is (part of) my HTML: <div class="pig" data-id="1">
    <h1>Harry</h1>
    <input type="text" value="Harry">
</div>
<div class="pig" data-id="2">
    <h1>Jill</h1>
    <input type="text" value="Jill">
</div>
<div class="pig" data-id="3">
    <h1>Bob</h1>
    <input type="text" value="Bob">
</div>
 Now the idea is that when you change the input this should update my Backbone Model and render the view, resuling in the h1 being updated with the new name. I'm not sure how I should set up my models and views. I kind of have the structure of my models and my views, but I don't know how I should use them. At the moment I have something like this: var PigModel = Backbone.Model.extend()
var pigs = new PigModel()
pigs.reset([
    {"id": "1", "name": "Harry"},
    {"id": "2", "name": "Jill"},
    {"id": "3", "name": "Bob"}
])

var PigView = Backbone.View.extend({
    el: '.pig',
    events: {
        'change input': function() {
            // update appropriate Model ?
            this.render()
        }
    },
    render: function() {

        var new_name = // get new name from model ?

        var pig_template = _.template($('#pig_template').html())
        var new_contents = pig_template({ name: new_name })

        // render only the pig that was changed ?

    }
})
 So at the places where I added comments in the code I don't know what to do: At the change event, how do I find the model that belongs to this view? I could loop through all the models but that seems inefficient. Again in the render method, how do I get the model that belongs to this view? In the render method, how can I only render the pig view the event was on, and not render all the pigs? Maybe I'm going for a total wrong approach over here. If so, please point me in the right direction.
@CODE:<div class="pig" data-id="1">
    <h1>Harry</h1>
    <input type="text" value="Harry">
</div>
<div class="pig" data-id="2">
    <h1>Jill</h1>
    <input type="text" value="Jill">
</div>
<div class="pig" data-id="3">
    <h1>Bob</h1>
    <input type="text" value="Bob">
</div> h1 var PigModel = Backbone.Model.extend()
var pigs = new PigModel()
pigs.reset([
    {"id": "1", "name": "Harry"},
    {"id": "2", "name": "Jill"},
    {"id": "3", "name": "Bob"}
])

var PigView = Backbone.View.extend({
    el: '.pig',
    events: {
        'change input': function() {
            // update appropriate Model ?
            this.render()
        }
    },
    render: function() {

        var new_name = // get new name from model ?

        var pig_template = _.template($('#pig_template').html())
        var new_contents = pig_template({ name: new_name })

        // render only the pig that was changed ?

    }

@TITLE:Sensitive Data stored in cache.db-wal file?
@CONTENT:I am facing an issue in an iOS application that uses a UIWebView to render HTML5 code that is part of the application bundle. This HTML5 code makes ajax requests to our backend which may potentially have sensitive data in them. This is all done over HTTPS and our application never stores the sensitive data. However, when doing security testing for the application, we found that http post requests where being stored in a local SQL Lite database (cache.db) as of iOS 5. It was easy to manage that, by setting the NSURLCache global object to have zero disk storage, and deleting the file when appropriate. Now however, it looks like in iOS 6.1 Apple has changed the implementation again, and the data is being stored in cache.db-wal. I have limited knowledge of SQL Lite, but I think this is a file created when SQL Lite is initialized with certain options. Any suggestions as to a fix?

@TITLE:Infinispan Operational modes
@CONTENT:I have recently started taking a look into Infinispan as our caching layer. After reading through the operation modes in Infinispan as mentioned below. Embedded mode: This is when you start Infinispan within the same JVM as your applications. Client-server mode: This is when you start a remote Infinispan instance and connect to it using a variety of different protocols. Firstly, I am confuse now which will be best suited to my application from the above two modes. I have a very simple use case, we have a client side code that will make a call to our REST Service using the main VIP of the service and then it will get load balanced to individual Service Server where we have deployed our service and then it will interact with the Cassandra database to retrieve the data basis on the user id. Below picture will make everything clear. Suppose for example, if client is looking for some data for userId = 123 then it will call our REST Service using the main VIP and then it will get load balanced to any of our four service server, suppose it gets load balanced to Service1, and then service1 will call Cassandra database to get the record for userId = 123 and then return back to Client. Now we are planning to cache the data using Infinispan as compaction is killing our performance so that our read performance can get some boost. So I started taking a look into Infinispan and stumble upon two modes as I mentioned below. I am not sure what will be the best way to use Infinispan in our case. Secondly, As from the Infinispan cache what I will be expecting is suppose if I am going with Embedded Mode, then it should look like something like this. If yes, then how Infinispan cache will interact with each other? It might be possible that at some time, we will be looking for data for those userId's that will be on another Service Instance Infinispan cache? Right? So what will happen in that scenario? Will infinispan take care of those things as well? if yes, then what configuration setup I need to have to make sure this thing is working fine. Pardon my ignorance if I am missing anything. Any clear information will make things more clear to me to my above two questions.

@TITLE:Scala Macros: Getting a List of TypeSymbols to be used at runtime
@CONTENT:Is there a way to return a List of TypeSymbols for each class under a package using macros? What I am trying to achieve is to write a macro that gives out something equivalent to this list: scala> import scala.reflect.runtime.universe._
import scala.reflect.runtime.universe._

scala> case class MyClass1()
defined class MyClass1

scala> case class MyClass2()
defined class MyClass2

scala> val typeSymbols = List(typeOf[MyClass1].typeSymbol, typeOf[MyClass2].typeSymbol)
typeSymbols: List[reflect.runtime.universe.Symbol] = List(class MyClass1, class MyClass2)
 Here's my setup: I have a package named foo, under which these are defined: trait FooTrait

case class Bar() extends FooTrait 

case class Bar() extends FooTrait
 Here's my macro that gets all type symbols for the classes under foo that extend FooTrait: def allTypeSymbols_impl[T: c.WeakTypeTag](c: Context)(packageName: c.Expr[String]) = {
  import c.universe._

  // Get package name from the expression tree
  val Literal(Constant(name: String)) = packageName.tree

  // Get all classes under given package name
  val pkg = c.mirror.staticPackage(name)

  // Obtain type symbols for the classes - implementation omitted
  val types = getTypeSymbols(c.universe)(List(pkg))

  // Apply method for List. For easy readability in later applications
  val listApply = Select(reify(List).tree, newTermName("apply"))

  val result = types.map {
    t =>
      val typeName = c.Expr[TypeSymbol](Ident(t))
      println(s"Typename: $typeName, $t, ${t.toType}")

      reify(typeName.splice).tree
  }

  println(s"RESULT: ${showRaw(result)}")

  c.Expr[List[reflect.runtime.universe.TypeSymbol]](Apply(listApply, result.toList))
}
 The first println prints: Typename: Expr[c.universe.TypeSymbol](Bar), class Bar, foo.Bar
Typename: Expr[c.universe.TypeSymbol](Baz), class Baz, foo.Baz
 The second one prints: RESULT: List(Ident(foo.Bar), Ident(foo.Baz))
 But I get this error message: [error] no type parameters for method any2ArrowAssoc: (x: A)ArrowAssoc[A] exist so that it can be applied to arguments (<notype>)
[error]  --- because ---
[error] argument expression's type is not compatible with formal parameter type;

[error] Note that <none> extends Any, not AnyRef.

 What should I do to make this work? I suspect that I have to write something else instead of Ident, but I couldn't figure out what. Using Scala 2.10.2. Thanks in advance!

@TITLE:Automatically create object if undefined
@CONTENT:Is there an easy way to automatically add properties to objects if they don't allready exist? Consider the following example: var test = {}
test.hello.world = "Hello doesn't exist!"
 This doesn't work because hello isn't defined. The reason why I'm asking this is because I have some existing objects for which I don't know if they allready have hello or not. I actually have a lot of these objects in different parts of my code. It is very annoying to always check if hello exists and if it doesn't create a new object like: var test = {}
if(test.hello === undefined) test.hello = {}
test.hello.world = "Hello World!"
 Is there a way to automatically create an object like hello in this example? I mean something like that in php: $test = array();  
$test['hello']['world'] = "Hello world";   
var_dump($test);
 Output: array(1) {
  ["hello"]=>
  array(1) {
    ["world"]=>
    string(11) "Hello world"
  }
}
 Ok it's an array but in js arrays it is the same problem as with objects.
@CODE:var test = {}
test.hello.world = "Hello doesn't exist!" hello hello hello var test = {}
if(test.hello === undefined) test.hello = {}
test.hello.world = "Hello World!" hello $test = array();  
$test['hello']['world'] = "Hello world";

@TITLE:Why does asort work with multidimensional arrays?
@CONTENT:Apologies if this is a really basic question. I've inadvertently discovered that asort() appears to work with multidimensional arrays: Sample PHP $animals = array(
  1 => array('name' => 'Zebra'),
  2 => array('name' => 'Fox'),
  3 => array('name' => 'Rabbit'),
  4 => array('name' => 'Dog'),
  5 => array('name' => 'Cat')

asort($animals);
var_dump($animals);
 Output array
  5 => 
    array
      'name' => string 'Cat' (length=3)
  4 => 
    array
      'name' => string 'Dog' (length=3)
  2 => 
    array
      'name' => string 'Fox' (length=3)
  3 => 
    array
      'name' => string 'Rabbit' (length=6)
  1 => 
    array
      'name' => string 'Zebra' (length=5)
 I'd like to know why this works? I thought asort() only sorted flat arrays, and to sort multidimensional arrays you needed to define a custom sort function. I can't find anything in the documentation that explains the above behaviour.
@CODE:asort() $animals = array(
  1 => array('name' => 'Zebra'),
  2 => array('name' => 'Fox'),
  3 => array('name' => 'Rabbit'),
  4 => array('name' => 'Dog'),

@TITLE:Kendo Grid with custom popup editor using MultiSelect - can't get selected items in model
@CONTENT:So the title pretty much says it all. I'm trying to incorporate the new MultiSelect widget into a Grid's custom popup editor template. I'm using the Data Attribute Initialization method and reading the dropdown options from a remote dataSource. This is all working okay, but I can't get the values of the selected items into the model. When I save the row, an array of data is sent to the server representing the first data item selected in the MultiSelect, rather than a comma-separated list of selected values. Any ideas how I can get the MultiSelect value (list/array of selected values) into the grid model? Thanks Edit: I've now used a workaround, but I'd be interested to know if there's a 'proper way' to use MultiSelects with Grids. The workaround is to add something like this to the Grid's configuration: save: function(e) { 
    e.model.items = $('#select_items').data("kendoMultiSelect").value();
}
 This is the relevant part of the popup editor template: <input name="select_items" id="select_items" data-value-field="id" 
data-text-field="description" data-source="itemsDataSource" 
data-role="multiselect" data-auto-bind="false" data-item-template="itemList">
 I've not got select_items in the model definition: I'm using the workaround above to copy the MultiSelect's value to items which is in the model. This seems to work, I just don't know why it is necessary.
@CODE:save: function(e) { 
    e.model.items = $('#select_items').data("kendoMultiSelect").value();
} <input name="select_items" id="select_items" data-value-field="id"

 Nothing in the response message or the raw data contains the customer address. Has anyone got this working as i'm struggling and it's the final step to complete the transaction.

@TITLE:Django model with FileField X dynamic 'upload_to' argument
@CONTENT:I am using the model with FileField to deal with file uploading. Now the files can be uploaded successfully. However, there is one more small improvement I want to make, which is to create folder for the user with the username. Here is the code I've tried class UserFiles(models.Model):
    user = models.OneToOneField(User)
    file = models.FileField(upload_to='files/users/user.username/%Y_%m_%d/')
 this would give the folder of 'user.username' instead of 'John'(one example of username) I have also tried other ways like files/users/%user.username/%Y_%m_%d/ ,but it would not give the folder with the user name. Not sure how the syntax should be or whether this is possible. Can you give some suggestions on this? Thank you very much for your help and explanation.
@CODE:class UserFiles(models.Model):
    user = models.OneToOneField(User)
    file = models.FileField(upload_to='files/users/user.username/%Y_%m_%d/') files/users/%user.username/%Y_%m_%d/

@TITLE:Tkinter/Matplotlib backend conflict causes infinite mainloop
@CONTENT:Consider running the following code (note it is an extremely simplified version to demonstrate the problem): import matplotlib.pyplot as plot
from tkinter import * #Tkinter if your on python 2

def main():

    fig = plot.figure(figsize=(16.8, 8.0))

    root = Tk()
    w = Label(root, text="Close this and it will hang!")
    w.pack()
    root.mainloop()

    print('Code never reaches this point')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
 Closing the first window will work fine, but closing the second window causes the code to hang, as root.mainloop() causes an infinite loop. This problem is caused by calling fig = plot.figure(figsize=(16.8, 8.0)). Does anyone know how to get root to close succesfully after making that matplotlib.pyplot call?

@TITLE:HandleError vs. ProvideFault inconsistencies in workflow service, how to handle?
@CONTENT:In our WF4 workflow service, we try to be as robust as possible. One of the things we do is to log errors inside HandleError and ProvideFault (IErrorhandler). The documentation states clearly that HandleError would be the right place to do the logging, but I see some strange things happen: I see some errors that only trigger ProvideFault, but never HandleError, one example was: System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object. at System.ServiceModel.Activities.Dispatcher.DurableInstanceManager.GetInstanceAsyncResult.GetInstance() at System.ServiceModel.Activities.Dispatcher.DurableInstanceManager.GetInstanceAsyncResult..ctor There are also some errors that only trigger HandleError, but never ProvideFault, one example was: System.ServiceModel.CommunicationException: There was an error reading from the pipe: The pipe has been ended. (109, 0x6d). at System.ServiceModel.Channels.PipeConnection.Read(Byte[] buffer, Int32 offset, Int32 size, TimeSpan timeout) at System.ServiceModel.Channels.SessionConnectionReader.Receive(TimeSpan timeout) Finally there are errors that trigger both, first ProvideFault and then HandleError (on a background thread) If possible, I want to log the corresponding incoming message, too. I do this with OperationContext.Current.RequestContext.RequestMessage.ToString() This usually only works in ProvideFault, in HandleError we don't have the RequestContext any more So my conclusion was, to log ALL errors, I must log in both methods. But that leads to a lot of duplicated log entries, due to 3.. My current workaround was to "remember" the last logged exception from ProvideFault, and ignore it if the same exception enters HandleError. Looks not very clean to me. Has anybody a better, reliable method to log all errors that can happen inside a WF service? And please don't point to Logging exceptions in WCF with IErrorHandler inside HandleError or ProvideFault? as that does not provide any help.

@TITLE:Performance of WebGL and OpenGL
@CONTENT:For the past month I've been messing with WebGL, and found that if I create and draw a large vertex buffer it causes low FPS. Does anyone know if it be the same if I used OpenGL with C++? Is that a bottleneck with the language used (JavaScript in the case of WebGL) or the GPU? WebGL examples like this show that you can draw 150,000 cubes using one buffer with good performance but anything more than this, I get FPS drops. Would that be the same with OpenGL, or would it be able to handle a larger buffer? Basically, I've got to make a decision to continue using WebGL and try to optimise by code or - if you tell me OpenGL would perform better and it's a language speed bottleneck, switch to C++ and use OpenGL.

 The LDC at line #1 indicates : Push 0 onto the stack as int32. So there must been 4 bytes occupied. But sizeOf shows 2 bytes... What am I missing here ? how many byte does short actually take in mem? I've heard about a situations where there is a padding to 4 bytes so it would be faster to deal with. is it the case also here? (please ignore the syncRoot and the GC root flag byte i'm just asking about 2 vs 4)

@TITLE:shiny app - ggplot can't find data
@CONTENT:I have made a shiny app which brings static maps back using ggmap. However when I want to overlay postcode boundaries I am encountering an error where ggplot cannot find the data set. The dataset poa is a dataframe of postcode boundaries i.e. lats and lons with a polygon ID. I have already tried adding environment = environment() but that doesn't solve my problem. I know that the data exists as I call print(str(poa)) which prints to the R console. Can anyone suggest a work around for me so that ggplot can access the poa dataframe? I apologise that this is not a very reproducible example. Update: ggplot is able to access the poa dataframe when I use this code: print(ggmap(map)) + geom_polygon(data = poa, aes(x = LON, y = LAT, group = order), alpha = .5, colour = "black", fill = NA))
 But I need to make a nested call to ggplot for the base layer of the map, when I do that ggplot is unable to find the data Here is my server.R code I am using isolate as I have an action button in my ui.R and I only want the plot to update when it has been clicked. library(shiny)

@LINK:/questions/17433873/pattern-for-treating-zero-as-truthy
@TITLE:Pattern for treating zero as truthy
@CONTENT:I often do stuff like this: delay = delay || 24; // default delay of 24 hours
 But I actually want to permit 0, and 0 || 24 === 24, instead of 0. I'm wondering what the best pattern is to take user input from command line, or input from wherever, and do the same logic, only treat zero as truthy. I think the best pattern I've found is to do exactly that: delay = (delay === 0 ? delay : (delay || 24));
 Firstly, it permits things like 'abc', which is really wrong. But if I put in an early + it lets null slide through, which is also wrong. Secondly, very ugly, because it's clearly working around a language deficiency rather than doing something elegant with the language tools available. And not terribly readable. I'm doing something that is one line of thought and I'd like to do it in one actual line of code (not one line on technicality, like this is). But most other ideas I have had get even uglier: delay = typeof delay === 'number' ? delay : 24; // but typeof NaN === 'number', so
delay = (!isNaN(delay) && typeof delay === 'number') ? delay : 24;
 Note that this actually would work with string - if i were interested in accepting "", then str = typeof str === 'string' ? str : 'default';
 Since there is no NaN hole, and this is intelligently readable: if we have a string use that, otherwise use defaut. Or this route: delay = !isNaN(+delay) ? delay : 24; // fails on null
delay = !Number.isNaN(+delay) ? delay : 24; // still fails on null
// same thing with null check, now way uglier than we started
 So I still like my hacky ternary and boolean logic better. Yes, I am looking for a condensed, one-line solution, since JS is rife with patterns and what would be clever in many other languages is well-recognized and readable and clear in JS. But I'm novice and trying to learn good patterns, hence, this question. To be more explicit on the requirements: 0 needs to go to 0. undefined needs to go to 24. All actual numbers under typeof need to go to themselves, except NaN. I strongly feel null should go to 24 because I very rarely use JS code that treats null and undefined differently on purpose. I feel it's better to keep it that way. I slightly feel NaN should go to 24 because this more closely follows the || pattern. Falsy things should go to default. 'abc' should go to 24 - in my real application this is user input, and the user should not mistakenly type, say an email. '123abc' should ideally go to 24, which conversion to Number catches but parseInt does not. I believe emails can start with numbers, so this drives the point home that this is something that ought to be caught. Underscore or lodash answers are acceptable, in particular, to those of you who have lectured me on trying to be "clever" instead of writing a 2-3 line function. Those libraries exist precisely because there are many simple 2-3 line functions accomplishing the same thing in many places in many code bases all over the world, and it's far more readable and maintainable and robust to have those isolated as something like, say, _.readNumber. If no such method exists and I am able to come up with general enough requirements, I will submit a poll request myself and post that as answer to this question. This is something I like about JS - it has good ecosystem in that it's very possible to not have to write these utility methods. Since I'm particularly dealing with user input it may be better for me to write a slightly more specialized function and submit to commander.js, which is where I keep needing this.
@CODE:delay = delay || 24; // default delay of 24 hours 0 || 24 === 24 0 delay = (delay === 0 ? delay : (delay || 24)); 'abc' + null delay = typeof delay === 'number' ? delay : 24; // but typeof NaN === 'number', so
delay = (!isNaN(delay) && typeof delay === 'number') ? delay : 24; "" str = typeof str === 'string' ? str : 'default'; NaN delay = !isNaN(+delay) ? delay : 24; // fails on null
delay = !Number.isNaN(+delay) ? delay : 24; // still fails on null
// same thing with null check, now way uglier than we started 0 0 undefined 24 typeof NaN null 24 null undefined NaN 24 || 'abc' '123abc' 24 Number parseInt _.readNumber delay = delay > -1 : delay : 24 num = typeof num === 'number' ? num : 24 null > -1 => true

@TITLE:Adding ANSI color escape sequences to a bash prompt results in bad cursor position when recalling/editing commands
@CONTENT:If I set my command prompt like: export PS1='\033[0;33m[\u@\h \w]\$ \033[00m'
 The color of the prompt will be yellow and everything after the '$' character will be the default terminal color. This is what I expect. However, If I recall a command line and attempt to edit it, moving the cursor -- either UpArrow/Ctrl-A (set -o emacs) or ESC K (set -o vi) if the command line I'm trying to edit is long enough, the cursor is not positioned at the beginning of the command. Typing either Ctrl-A (set -o emacs) or ^ (set -o vi) will not move the cursor to what I'm seeing as the beginning of the recalled line on the screen. Similarly, attempting to position the cursor to the end of the line (Ctrl-E or $, depending) results in it being placed several characters past what appears to be the end of the line. It looks like bash is getting confused by the escape characters I've added to the prompt. Is this just something I'll have to deal with, changing my prompt to a monochromatic one when I wish to edit recalled lines, or is there a way to get bash to correctly allow the editing of recalled commands with a colorful prompt?

@CONTENT:How can I make scipy's fmin_cg use one function that returns cost and gradient as a tuple? The problem with having f for cost and fprime for gradient, is that I might have to perform an operation twice (very costly) by which the grad and cost is calculated. Also, sharing the variables between them could be troublesome. In Matlab however, fmin_cg works with one function that returns cost and gradient as tuple. I don't see why scipy's fmin_cg cannot provide such convenience. Thanks in advance...

I am using code example that I found in stackoverflow: Using MultipartPostHandler to POST form-data with Python And here is my code that I tweaked for delta web page. from scrapy.selector import HtmlXPathSelector
from scrapy.http import FormRequest, Request
from delta.items import DeltaItem
from scrapy.contrib.spiders import CrawlSpider, Rule


class DmozSpider(CrawlSpider):
    name = "delta"
    allowed_domains = ["http://www.delta.com"]
    start_urls = ["http://www.delta.com"]

    def start_requests(self, response):
        yield FormRequest.from_response(response, formname='flightSearchForm',url="http://www.delta.com/booking/findFlights.do", formdata={'departureCity[0]':'JFK', 'destinationCity[0]':'SFO','departureDate[0]':'07.20.2013','departureDate[1]':'07.28.2013','paxCount':'1'},callback=self.parse1)

    def parse1(self, response):
        hxs = HtmlXPathSelector(response)
        sites = hxs.select('//')
        items = []
        for site in sites:
            item = DeltaItem()
            item['title'] = site.select('text()').extract()
            item['link'] = site.select('text()').extract()
            item['desc'] = site.select('text()').extract()
            items.append(item)
        return items
 When I instruct spider to crawl in terminal I see:  scrapy crawl delta -o items.xml  -t xml

 If you compare with example from link I don't see that I managed to make POST method even when I am using almost the same code. I even tried with very simple HTML/PHP form from W3schools that I placed on server, but the same there. What ever I did never managed to create POST. I think the problem is simple, but as only Python knowledge that I have is Scrapy and all Scrapy is what i found on-line(I it is well documented) and from examples, but still it is not enough for me. So if any one at least could show the right way it would be very big help.

@TITLE:Using R reference classes to pass values from one window to another in a GUI
@CONTENT:I am making a GUI in R using gWidgets. Until now I have been passing values from one window to another via the global environment. Using the global environment is simple to implement but not ideal. One problem is that R CMD check complains about lacking visible bindings for global variables. As a solution to this problem, reference classes have been mentioned by several R programmers. But to understand how reference classes would work in this context, it would really help to have a simple example. Let me give a silly GUI to work with. When the user hits the button of the first window, it puts the model m in the global environment. The second button gets m from the global environment and gives an output. When you hit the first button again, it will make a new model m and change the output of the second button. If you close the first window, the button in the second window will still work, because m is in the global environment. library(gWidgets)
options(guiToolkit = "tcltk")

h1 <- function(h, ...){
  d1 <- data.frame(x=runif(10), y=runif(10))
  .GlobalEnv$m <- lm(x ~ y, data=d1)
}

g1 <- gbutton("1. Make model", 
  container=gwindow(), handler=h1)

h2 <- function(h, ...){
  d2 <- data.frame(y=(1:10)/10)
  p <- predict(.GlobalEnv$m, newdata=d2)
  print(p)
}

g2 <- gbutton("2. Make prediction", 
  container=gwindow(), handler=h2)
 How can I use reference classes in this example?
@CODE:R CMD check m m m m library(gWidgets)
options(guiToolkit = "tcltk")

h1 <- function(h, ...){
  d1 <- data.frame(x=runif(10), y=runif(10))
  .GlobalEnv$m <- lm(x ~ y, data=d1)

@TITLE:OAuth: Starting a Google Compute Instance from within Google App Engine
@CONTENT:I have a Google App Engine web app that runs the majority of my site. However, for certain functions, I need a linux machine. I would like my Google App Engine app to automatically spin-up a Google Compute Instance on certain events. I understand that you can add Google Compute instances using the Compute Engine REST API. However, in order to access the Google Compute REST API, you need to get an access token using the OAuth2 authentication process. How can I programmatically get an access token from within Google App Engine? It seems that all of the authentication methods require a window to appear so you can type in your username and password, which is impractical from within Google App Engine.

Ok, I have this scenario: a = [false, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, false, true, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false]
 Then if I do this: a.sort(function(a,b){return !a && b});
 It gives me this: [false, false, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, false, true, false, false, false, false, false, false, true, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false]

@TITLE:Android: EditText in ListView issue
@CONTENT:I have a listview in my application that is basically a questionaire so there are some EditTexts that the user needs to fill. I've encountered the following issues: Some of the EditText require numeric input, so I set the inputType in the corresponding xml type as numeric, however, as when I click on the EditText the numeric keyboard is shown but almost immediately it disappears and the regular keyboard is shown. As you can imagine, I need to store the values that the user inputs in these EditTexts. The problem I have with this is that after I input some text in SOME EditTexts and I scroll down, the text is gone when I go back. You can see in my code that I made an attempt to prevent this and I should mention that it works perfectly fine with checkboxes. At the beginning I was having problems with losing the focus but I solved it looking at other questions (added descendantFocusablity="beforeDescendants" to the ListView and windowSoftInputMode="adjustPan"). Works fine except that when an EditText is below the half of the screen it loses focus as soon as I start typing into it. getView method for list adapter: public View getView(final int position,View result,ViewGroup parent)

@TITLE:Tips to save up our page load time [duplicate]
@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: Optimizations to reduce website loading time 14 answers My Question:What are the best possible ways to shave up those unnecessary kbs and make page load Faster.What all optimization practices+coding practices(in js,php) if performed can make your page lighter. Why I asked this:I read this article on jquery.js vs jquery.min.js usage.I thought lot of people use it without knowing the meaning of it.I am basically in to making ad units on android and ios phones.So in my field saving up every single kb becomes very critical. I have recently started using jquery.min instead of plain javascript.But again that increases the overall kbs size.The big daddy google keeps track of this aspect in their page rank philosophy.So this question becomes even more important to be in top most searches.I did search google but no link came up with some solid answers. I was wondering what should people do to make their web page lighter on mobile as well as tablets and pc browser other than using minified version of any js library. At some point of time every javascript coder must be thinking of this question.

@LINK:/questions/17362758/jvm-and-os-dns-caching
@TITLE:JVM and OS DNS Caching
@CONTENT:I am facing a problem with JVM and DNS. Everything I'm reading (including the docs and this) says that I can disable JVM DNS caching using networkaddress.cache.ttl, which can be set using java.security.Security.setProperties, but through the standard approach of using system properties. I have successfully changed this to 0, so no more caching in my JVM. But now, on each call of InetAddress.getByName("mytest.com"), it seems that my JVM is using the system DNS cache (in my case Windows 8). Indeed, between 2 calls of the method, I have changed the BIND9 properties for "mytest.com", but the IP return is still the same. Here is the workflow: setCachePolicyInJVM(0) in my Java code. set mytest.com to 192.168.1.188 in BIND9, restart. InetAddress.getByName("mytest.com").getHostAddress(); -> 192.168.1.188 set mytest.com -> 192.168.1.160 in BIND9, restart. InetAddress.getByName("mytest.com").getHostAddress(); -> 192.168.1.188 (should be 160 if there was no caching). Flush the Windows DNS InetAddress.getByName("mytest.com").getHostAddress(); -> 192.168.1.160 I have read several times that the JVM does not use the system cache, but that is wrong: it clearly does. How do we force a new DNS resolution on each call, bypassing the OS DNS cache?
@CODE:networkaddress.cache.ttl java.security.Security.setProperties InetAddress.getByName("mytest.com") setCachePolicyInJVM(0) mytest.com InetAddress.getByName("mytest.com").getHostAddress(); mytest.com InetAddress.getByName("mytest.com").getHostAddress(); InetAddress.getByName("mytest.com").getHostAddress();

@CONTENT:I want to implement Push Notification for an App (both iOS and Android) and need clarifications on the following scenarios. I understand how the Push Notification works in general and the limitations. I did read the docs but that just got me confused and didnt answer all my questions. How are the following scenarios handled in iOS and Android: When the device is turned off When the device is not connected to 3G or Wifi networks When the device has crashed and need restart When the App is in foreground When the App is in the background When user is currently using the App When my app is closed (not opened / launched) When a push notification is user specific and both users share the same device and app. Example: If a husband and wife share same device and use a bank App with Push notification. Can you send User specific notification if device is shared by multiple users? When user has installed App on multiple devices Can you send a notification to all devices registered by a user at once? Do you store the device type (iOS or Android) with the registrationID in the User table or is there a way to differentiate the type of device by inspecting the token or registrationID? Can you cancel a previously sent notification which is not read yet and send a new one? Is it still true that Android Push Notifications does not work on Kindle Fire and will need to implement Amazon Device Messaging Anything else that I need to think of or plan? I am aware of handling un-registering and feedback service

@LINK:/questions/17352104/multiple-js-event-handlers-on-single-element
@TITLE:multiple js event handlers on single element
@CONTENT:I am working with an existing web app, in the app there are a variety of submit buttons on different forms, some using regular http post, some defining an onClick function, and some binding a js event handler to the button using a class on the element. What I want to do, is bind another event handler to these buttons by just adding a class to the buttons, but what I want to determine is will the new event handler be guaranteed to be executed, or could one of the form submit actions happen before it does meaning my new function isn't hit. The example scenario is I want to add a class to these buttons that bimds them all to a common js function that simply logs usage to some api. Is there a risk that the logging function isn't called because the form submit has navigated away from the page? I've not done loads of js development, and I could test this 100 times over and just get lucky with it firing. Below is some code I have tested with for one of the examples - again, I'm not asking how to bind multiple events, the question is to about my understanding of the spec and whether execution of all handlers is guaranteed. $(document).ready(function(){
    $('.testingBtn').click(function() {
        window.location.replace("http://stackoverflow.com");
    });
    $( ".testingBtn" ).click(function(){
        alert('submitting!');
    });
});


<input class="testingBtn" type="submit" id="submitform" value="Complete Signup" />
 As seen above, I can bind the multiple events, and in this example, just directed to another url, but this could be a form.submit() etc. In my testing the alert has always fired first, but am I just getting lucky with the race conditions?
@CODE:$(document).ready(function(){
    $('.testingBtn').click(function() {
        window.location.replace("http://stackoverflow.com");
    });
    $( ".testingBtn" ).click(function(){
        alert('submitting!');
    });
});

@TITLE:Code runs 6 times slower with 2 threads than with 1
@CONTENT:Original Problem: So I have written some code to experiment with threads and do some testing. The code should create some numbers and then find the mean of those numbers. I think it is just easier to show you what I have so far. I was expecting with two threads that the code would run about 2 times as fast. Measuring it with a stopwatch I think it runs about 6 times slower! EDIT: Now using the computer and clock() function to tell the time. void findmean(std::vector<double>*, std::size_t, std::size_t, double*);


int main(int argn, char** argv)
{

    // Program entry point
    std::cout << "Generating data..." << std::endl;

    // Create a vector containing many variables
    std::vector<double> data;
    for(uint32_t i = 1; i <= 1024 * 1024 * 128; i ++) data.push_back(i);

    // Calculate mean using 1 core
    double mean = 0;
    std::cout << "Calculating mean, 1 Thread..." << std::endl;
    findmean(&data, 0, data.size(), &mean);
    mean /= (double)data.size();

    // Print result
    std::cout << "  Mean=" << mean << std::endl;

    // Repeat, using two threads
    std::vector<std::thread> thread;
    std::vector<double> result;
    result.push_back(0.0);
    result.push_back(0.0);
    std::cout << "Calculating mean, 2 Threads..." << std::endl;

    // Run threads
    uint32_t halfsize = data.size() / 2;
    uint32_t A = 0;
    uint32_t B, C, D;
    // Split the data into two blocks
    if(data.size() % 2 == 0)
    {
        B = C = D = halfsize;
    }
    else if(data.size() % 2 == 1)
    {
        B = C = halfsize;
        D = hsz + 1;
    }

    // Run with two threads
    thread.push_back(std::thread(findmean, &data, A, B, &(result[0])));
    thread.push_back(std::thread(findmean, &data, C, D , &(result[1])));

    // Join threads
    thread[0].join();
    thread[1].join();

    // Calculate result
    mean = result[0] + result[1];
    mean /= (double)data.size();

    // Print result
    std::cout << "  Mean=" << mean << std::endl;

    // Return
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}


void findmean(std::vector<double>* datavec, std::size_t start, std::size_t length, double* result)
{
    for(uint32_t i = 0; i < length; i ++) {
        *result += (*datavec).at(start + i);
    }
}
 I don't think this code is exactly wonderful, if you could suggest ways of improving it then I would be grateful for that also. Register Variable: Several people have suggested making a local variable for the function 'findmean'. This is what I have done: void findmean(std::vector<double>* datavec, std::size_t start, std::size_t length, double* result)
{
register double holding = *result;
for(uint32_t i = 0; i < length; i ++) {
    holding += (*datavec).at(start + i);
}
*result = holding;
}
 I can now report: The code runs with almost the same execution time as with a single thread. That is a big improvement of 6x, but surely there must be a way to make it nearly twice as fast? Register Variable and O2 Optimization: I have set the optimization to 'O2' - I will create a table with the results. Results so far: Original Code with no optimization or register variable: 1 thread: 4.98 seconds, 2 threads: 29.59 seconds Code with added register variable: 1 Thread: 4.76 seconds, 2 Threads: 4.76 seconds With reg variable and -O2 optimization: 1 Thread: 0.43 seconds, 2 Threads: 0.6 seconds 2 Threads is now slower? With Dameon's suggestion, which was to put a large block of memory in between the two result variables: 1 Thread: 0.42 seconds, 2 Threads: 0.64 seconds With TAS 's suggestion of using iterators to access contents of the vector: 1 Thread: 0.38 seconds, 2 Threads: 0.56 seconds Same as above on Core i7 920 (single channel memory 4GB): 1 Thread: 0.31 seconds, 2 Threads: 0.56 seconds Same as above on Core i7 920 (dual channel memory 2x2GB): 1 Thread: 0.31 seconds, 2 Threads: 0.35 seconds

@TITLE:Does delete[] call destructors?
@CONTENT:I am writing a template class which internally manages an array of the given type. Like this: template<typename T>
class Example {
    // ...
private:
    T* objects; // allocated in c'tor (array), deleted in d'tor
    // ...
};
 I was wondering if C++ calls the destructor of each object in objects when I delete it via delete[] objects;. I need to know this, because the objects in my class do not contain sensible values all the time, so the destructors should not be called when they don't. Additionally, I'd like to know if the destructors would be called if I declared a fixed-sized array like T objects[100] as part of Example<T>.
@CODE:template<typename T>

    // ...

It is useful for multitenant system, where a tenant can select their own theme (two col, three col, etc.) How can I achieve that in playframework 2 Scala, with Scala template engine? In other words, I'd like to have multiple layout templates in which a tenant can select from. The controller then renders the layout template and the action specific content template. Something like (Controller's action pseudocode): Based on user, retrieve the layout theme (a name stored in string in a database, and has corresponding mapping view file). Render the action specific content view. Render layout view obtained from (1) along with the (2). Note: for each action, the layout theme may change per user but the content view remains same. In it's documentation (http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.1.1/ScalaTemplateUseCases) the content template, say, the index.scala.html, includes a call to the main which is defined in main.scala.html, the layout template. In other words, it is hard coded, thus index.scala.html is tightly coupled to main.scala.html. I though about calling the main from the controller using reflection, and then passing the content. An alternative would be to use a interpreted template engine such as Scalate. Any suggestion?

@TITLE:what are the pros and cons of setting virtual host in Liferay?
@CONTENT:I am using multiple domains to access liferay portal instance. For example following are the domains mapped in hosts file of windows: www.liferaytest1.com www.liferaytest2.com and in Liferay's Control Panel  Portal Settings, www.liferaytest1.com is set as virtual host. I can access portal instance with all above mention domains along with localhost. When I access portal with www.liferaytest1.com then I can access Guest site pages directly. Say, home is a page in Guest site then instead of accessing with www.liferatest1.com/web/guest/home I can access it directly with www.liferaytest1.com/home So URL is shortened to some extend. So far so good. First Concern Now when I try to access portal via www.liferaytest2.com and when I click any sites listed in My Sites portlet of Liferay, it redirects me to that site with the domain mentioned in virtual host i.e. www.liferaytest1.com instead of retaining www.liferaytest2.com. Suppose I have a Site named Help, so when I click on help site link in My Sites portlet then instead of staying with www.liferaytest2.com domain it redirects me with www.liferaytest1.com domain. This is due to virtual host mapping done in liferay. Second Concern When I am accessing the portal with www.liferaytest2.com and subscribe to any of the Assets then the links in email contain the virtual host domain i.e www.liferaytest1.com. How to overcome above mention issues? My requirement is to stay relative to the portal accessing domain. When I access portal via www.liferaytest2.com then it should not redirect me to www.liferaytest1.com on-click of any of the Site-links as explained above and also emails that I would be getting should also be relative to the domain I am accessing i.e. www.liferaytest2.com.
@CODE:www.liferaytest1.com www.liferaytest2.com www.liferaytest1.com localhost www.liferaytest1.com Guest home Guest www.liferatest1.com/web/guest/home www.liferaytest1.com/home www.liferaytest2.com My Sites www.liferaytest1.com www.liferaytest2.com Help My Sites www.liferaytest2.com www.liferaytest1.com www.liferaytest2.com www.liferaytest1.com www.liferaytest2.com www.liferaytest1.com www.liferaytest2.com

@CONTENT:How would you use a LaunchAgent inside the sandbox? I want to distribute a UI-less LaunchAgent app bundle inside my main application that I can launch on demand. The reason I want this instead of an XPC service is for the KeepAlive option, which will prevent launchd from automatically killing my process when its idle. This option doesn't exist on XPC services. The documentation says that there's a plist that needs to be copied into ~/Library/LaunchAgents, and this is obviously not possible inside the sandbox. Is there some sort of system API that would handle copy the plist for me? I've seen Apple's SMJobBless sample code, but it seems like that's for registering a privileged LaunchDaemon rather than an unprivileged LaunchAgent.

@LINK:/questions/17256834/getting-the-arguments-of-a-parent-function-in-r-with-names
@TITLE:getting the arguments of a parent function in R, with names
@CONTENT:I'm trying to write a function that captures the arguments of the function it is called from. For example, get_args <- function () as.list( sys.call(sys.parent()) )[-1]

caller <- function (x, y, z) {
    get_args()
}
caller(1,2,3)

[[1]]
[1] 1

[[2]]
[1] 2

[[3]]
[1] 3
 sys.call() unfortunately does not add match parameter names with argument values, and I'd like to write a similar version of get_args that returns output similar to caller2 <- function (x, y, z) {
    as.list( match.call() )[-1]
}
caller2(1,2,3)

$x
[1] 1

$y
[1] 2

$z
[1] 3
 replacing "get_args()" with "match.call()" directly is not the solution I'm looking for, since in reality get_args will do some other things before returning its parent functions arguments. I've tried to use match.call() with sys.parent() in several ways, but I can't get the function to return the arguments of caller; it just returns the arguments of get_args(). Is there any way to make get_args() return output identical to that of caller2 for the above test case? I know that naming the arguments manually is possible using formals(), but is this guaranteed to be equivelant? If any clarification is needed, leave a comment below. Thanks. EDIT 1: the aim of get_args() is to act as a user-friendly way of getting the arguments with which a function was called. Typing as.list( match.call() )[-1] gets old, but because match.call grabs the nearest function call it just gets the arguments of get_args() at the moment. get_args() will also get default arguments from the parent function, but this easy to implement. SOLUTION: thanks Hong Ooi, the key to using match.call seems to be providing both the call and the definition of the function you want to find out about. A slightly modified, anonymous-friendly version of get_args is below for posterity get_args <- function () {
as.list( match.call(
    def = sys.function( -1 ),
    call = sys.call(-1)) )[-1]

}
 This version finds the function further up the call stack, grabs its definition and call, and matches parameters to its arguments.
@CODE:get_args <- function () as.list( sys.call(sys.parent()) )[-1]

caller <- function (x, y, z) {
    get_args()
}
caller(1,2,3)

@TITLE:Implementing callbacks in Java with Runnable [closed]
@CONTENT:I'm used to write code in JavaScript-like or Erlang-like languages, where I can make callback functions in easy way. Now I have to write something in Java. I figured it out how to perform callback like this: import java.util.*;

class Demo extends Thread{

    private int data;

    public void run(){
        ask_for_data(new Runnable(){
            public void run(){
                on_data();

    }

    public void on_data(){

    }

    public void ask_for_data(final Runnable callback){
        System.out.println("2");
        Runnable r = new Runnable(){
            public void run(){

    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Demo d = new Demo();
        d.start();
    }
}
 Question is: is it correct approach?
@CODE:import java.util.*;

@CONTENT:I've been searching several days for a descent answer on how to acquire the list of installed applications on a device running iOS > 5.0 (com.apple.mobile.installation.plist). I've tried codes from different sources and the only almost successful solution I got was with shared URL scheme approach using Daniel Amitay API (http://www.ihasapp.com) - thumbs up for it - great job! But with the URL scheme I wasn't able to get all installed apps on the device cause not all of them have shared URL scheme. The devices I am working with are not jailbroken so accessing /private/var/mobile/Library/Caches/com.apple.mobile.installation.plist from within the app is forbidden due to app sandboxing. So the examplea given in Is it possible to retrieve these information? and Finding list of installed apps on iphone work only on simulator or jailbroken device. My question: "Is there any way to present to the user iTunes(AppStore) login screen from within the app and after he/she enters his/hers credentials to be able to request the list of purchased (downloaded) applications from the iTunes(AppStore)?" I am trying to make an app that shows all installed apps and their position on the Home Screen (Springboard) like iTunes does when you browse your device. The necessity of having such app is when you have 400-500 installed applications on a device and you've grouped them in folders it is quite frustrating to find each one of them when you decide to uninstall it from the device. Can anyone help? Thanks in advance.

@LINK:/questions/17173635/jquery-ajax-failing-to-call-to-mvc-4-controller-method
@TITLE:jQuery Ajax failing to call to MVC 4 Controller method
@CONTENT:I'm attempting to use jQuery in order to fire off an Ajax call after clicking a certain button. I've read several examples of the syntax and issues that may be encountered, but have failed to find a working solution for my cause. Here's the code. Controller Method: (HomeController.cs)     [HttpPost]
    public JsonResult ChangeCompany(string companyCode)
    {
        return Json(new { result = companyCode }, JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet);
    }
 jQuery Code:     function changeCompany(company) {
    $.ajax({
        url: '@Url.Action("ChangeCompany", "Home")',
        type: 'POST',
        data: JSON.stringify({ companyCode: company }),

        success: function (data) {
            alert("Company: " + data);
        },
        error: function (req, status, error) {
            alert("R: " + req + " S: " + status + " E: " + error);
        }
    });
}
 And finally, I'm calling this function with: $('.companyButton').click(function () {
    compCode = $(this).text();
    debug("Click event --> " + $(this).text());
    changeCompany(compCode);
});
 My debug message displays properly, and the Ajax call constantly fails with the following alert: R: [object Object] S: error E: Not Found I'm not entirely sure what to make of that. I know there are several questions on this topic, but none of them seem to resolve my issue and I'm honestly not sure what's wrong with these code blocks. Any insight would be appreciated. EDIT: In case it's worth noting, this is for a mobile device. Testing on Windows 8 Phone Emulator (Internet Explorer), alongside jQuery Mobile. Not sure if that affects Ajax at all EDIT 2: After taking a look at the raw network call, it seems that 'Url.Action("ChangeCompany", "Home")' is not being converted into the proper URL and is instead being called directly as if it were raw URL text. Is this due to an outdated jQuery, or some other factor?
@CODE:[HttpPost]
    public JsonResult ChangeCompany(string companyCode)
    {
        return Json(new { result = companyCode }, JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet);
    } function changeCompany(company) {
    $.ajax({
        url: '@Url.Action("ChangeCompany", "Home")',
        type: 'POST',
        data: JSON.stringify({ companyCode: company }),

            alert("R: " + req + " S: " + status + " E: " + error);
        }
    });
} $('.companyButton').click(function () {
    compCode = $(this).text();
    debug("Click event --> " + $(this).text());
    changeCompany(compCode);

@TITLE:Functor instance for a GADT with type constraint
@CONTENT:Today I wanted to investigate if it is possible to construct a data type in such a way, that it does not store the data of the type of its type signature, but another representation of it. So, here is my attempt of an GADT which has a type constructor of type a, but a data constructor of type ByteString. {-# LANGUAGE GADTs #-}
import Data.ByteString.Char8
import Data.Serialize

data Serialized a where
    MkSerialized :: (Serialize a) => ByteString -> Serialized a
 Now I can define a decode' function in the following way: decode' :: (Serialize a) => Serialized a -> a
decode' (MkSerialized bs) = let Right r = (decode bs) in r
 And it works: let s = MkSerialized (encode "test") :: Serialized String
print $ decode' s     -- prints "test"
 My problem is now that I'd like Serialized to be an instance of Functor. instance Functor Serialized where
    fmap f (MkSerialized bs) = MkSerialized (encode (f (right (decode bs))))
                               where right (Right r) = r
 But I get the error (Serialize b) can not be deduced. How can I constraint the Functor instance so that Serialize is enforced in the fmap?

 Any help would be much appreciated. Thank you

@TITLE:How does the UV_RUN_NOWAIT mode work in libuv?
@CONTENT:When running an event loop in libuv using the uv_run function, there's a "mode" parameter that is used with the following values: UV_RUN_DEFAULT
UV_RUN_ONCE
UV_RUN_NOWAIT
 The first two are obvious. UV_RUN_DEFAULT runs the event loop until there are no more events, and UV_RUN_ONCE processing a single event from the loop. However, UV_RUN_NOWAIT doesn't seem to be a separate mode, but rather a flag that can be ORed with one of the other two values. By default, this function blocks until events are done processing, and UV_RUN_NOWAIT makes it nonblocking, but any documentation I can find on it ends there. My question is, if you run the event loop nonblocking, how are callbacks handled? The libuv event model is single-threaded (reactor pattern), so I'd assume it needs to block to be able to call the callbacks, but if the main thread is occupied, what happens to an event after it's processed? Will the callback be "queued" until libuv gets control of the main thread again? Or will the callbacks be dispatched on another thread?

@CONTENT:My objective is to stimulate a sequence diagram of an application for this i need the information about a caller and callee class names during runtime. I can successfully retive the caller function but not able to get a caller class name? #Scenario caller.py:

import inspect

class A:

    def Apple(self):
        print "Hello"
        b=B()
        b.Bad()



class B:

    def Bad(self):
        print"dude"
        print inspect.stack()


a=A()
a.Apple()
 When i printed the stack there was no information about the caller class. So is it possible to retrieve the caller class during runtime ?
@CODE:#Scenario caller.py:

import inspect

class A:

    def Apple(self):
        print "Hello"
        b=B()
        b.Bad()



class B:

    def Bad(self):
        print"dude"
        print inspect.stack()


a=A()
a.Apple() a A b B

@TITLE:Why does Angular not databind data when an object is copied from another object?
@CONTENT:I've created a simple jsfiddle to illustrate my question: fiddle Html: <div ng-controller="MyCtrl">   
    <div ng-repeat="p in products">
        <span ng-click="overwrite(p)">{{ p.id }}: {{ p.name }}</span>
    </div>
</div>
 Javascript: var myApp = angular.module('myApp',[]);

function MyCtrl($scope) {

    var products = [{id:1, name:'first'}, {id:2, name:'second'}];
    $scope.products = products;

    var prod = {id: 3, name:'third'};

    $scope.overwrite = function(p){
        p.id = 4;
        p.name = 'forth';

        p = prod; // this doesn't work nor does angular.copy(prod)
    }
}
 As you can see, when I set the properties by hand, the values are bind. But when I overwrite an object, nothing happens. How is this possible? And what do I have to do when I want to restore an object in it's original state? Imagine I create a backup object using var productBackup = angular.copy(product). Then I make changes to the original product and later I decide to cancel my changes. I want to do this using product = productBackup. But this doesn't work! In this case, do I need to set all the properties by hand like this? product.id = productBackup.id;
product.name = productBackup.name;
etc...
@CODE:<div ng-controller="MyCtrl">   
    <div ng-repeat="p in products">
        <span ng-click="overwrite(p)">{{ p.id }}: {{ p.name }}</span>
    </div>
</div> var myApp = angular.module('myApp',[]);

function MyCtrl($scope) {

    var products = [{id:1, name:'first'}, {id:2, name:'second'}];
    $scope.products = products;

    var prod = {id: 3, name:'third'};

    $scope.overwrite = function(p){
        p.id = 4;
        p.name = 'forth';

        p = prod; // this doesn't work nor does angular.copy(prod)
    }
} var productBackup = angular.copy(product) product = productBackup product.id = productBackup.id;
product.name = productBackup.name;
etc...

@TITLE:Creating a Ruby on Rails environment on Windows, in a VM Vagrant Box
@CONTENT:Is Vagrant a good solutions for creating a Rails environment in windows? I have a powerful Windows 8 64bit desktop. I recently did a project with RoR and fell in love with it. As I found out, installing RoR on windows is just bleh; so I created a dual boot to ubuntu. As a creative developer, I find it rather difficult to get any of the "creative" done in ubuntu because of the lack of my typical creative tools. I read a bit about a tool called Vagrant; however, I'm still unsure if it meets my requirements: adobe suite, sublime text, git, rails, rails friendly OS(mac?/ubuntu) Typical duties: edit an image in photoshop(windows), drop it to project assets in VM? Typical duties: push/pull to git; ssh to VPS server? Also, I hear you can install mac os in the VM do you think thats a good option? (because I want to try their new OS)

@TITLE:Why C# lambda expression can't use instance properties and fields?
@CONTENT:Why C# lambda expression can't use instance properties and fields, when is used in a class scope? See this example: public class Point:INotifyPropertyChanged
{
    public float X {get; set;}
    public float Y {get; set;}

    PropertyChangedEventHandler onPointsPropertyChanged =  (_, e)  =>
                               {
                                   X = 5;
                                   Y = 5; //Trying to access instace properties, but a compilation error occurs
                               };
    ...
}
 Why this is not allowed? EDIT If we can do: public class Point:INotifyPropertyChanged
{
    public float X {get; set;}
    public float Y {get; set;}

    PropertyChangedEventHandler onPointsPropertyChanged; 
    public Point()
    {
        onPointsPropertyChanged =  (_, e)  =>
                               {
                                   X = 5;
                                   Y = 5;    
                               };
    }
    ...
}
 Why we can't initialize onPointsPropertyChanged like a other fields inside the class scope?, for instancie: int a = 5. The field onPointsPropertyChanged always will be used after the constructor execute.
@CODE:public class Point:INotifyPropertyChanged
{
    public float X {get; set;}
    public float Y {get; set;}

    PropertyChangedEventHandler onPointsPropertyChanged =  (_, e)  =>
                               {
                                   X = 5;
                                   Y = 5; //Trying to access instace properties, but a compilation error occurs
                               };

@TITLE:Testing controller with fake session
@CONTENT:I want to write test for my controller: Result changeAction = callAction(controllers.routes.ref.Users.changePassword());
assertThat(status(changeAction)).isEqualTo(OK);
 I have a http status code - 300. That's right it is redirect because I have a class named Secured package controllers;

import play.mvc.*;
import play.mvc.Http.*;

public class Secured extends Security.Authenticator {

    @Override
    public String getUsername(Context ctx) {

    @Override
    public Result onUnauthorized(Context ctx) {
        return redirect(routes.Users.login(ctx.request().uri()));
    }


}
 And when I use the @Security.Authenticated(Secured.class) annotation for controller method it redirects if session with "userId" do not exists. So the question is, how can I fake the session? I tried obviously call Controller.session("usderId", "2"); And got an exception: java.lang.RuntimeException: There is no HTTP Context available from here.

@CODE:Result changeAction = callAction(controllers.routes.ref.Users.changePassword());

@TITLE:C# JSON deserialization: can I intercept the deserialization and optionally change the result?
@CONTENT:We've got some JSON that we are deserializing into a strongly-typed object graph in C#. However, we've got one issue: sometimes there is an "empty" value in the JSON (e.g., empty string) in a property that maps to a boolean value in our model. In our case, we know that 100% of the time, we can translate these "blank" values to Boolean false. However, the JSON deserializers I've tried don't know about this (understandably). I've been trying to find a way to intercept the deserialization of each property, and optionally override the output. I.e., if there was an "interceptor" method I could register, that looked like this:     public Boolean JsonDeserializationInterceptor(String rawJson, System.Type targetType, out object result)
    {
        Boolean overrodeValue = false;
        result = null;
        if(targetType == typeof(System.Boolean))
        {
            overrodeValue = true;
            // We'll pretend that we're interpreting the string "Yes" as
            // true, and all other values are false.
            if (rawJson != null && rawJson.ToLower() == "\"yes\"")
                result = true;
            else
                result = false;
        }

        return overrodeValue;
    }
 That's just hypothetical, of course, but hopefully it gives you an idea of what I'm trying to accomplish. In my research I have not been able to figure out a way to do this. I've looked at Json.NET, System.Runtime.Serialization.Json.DataContractJsonSerializer, and System.Web.Script.Serialization.JavaScriptSerializer. I bet there is a way to do this, and I just haven't been able to figure it out. Edit: I think you might be able to use the JsonConverterAttribute, but so far I have not been able to get that working.
@CODE:false public Boolean JsonDeserializationInterceptor(String rawJson, System.Type targetType, out object result)
    {
        Boolean overrodeValue = false;
        result = null;
        if(targetType == typeof(System.Boolean))
        {
            overrodeValue = true;
            // We'll pretend that we're interpreting the string "Yes" as
            // true, and all other values are false.
            if (rawJson != null && rawJson.ToLower() == "\"yes\"")
                result = true;
            else
                result = false;
        }

@LINK:/questions/16956693/why-c-copy-constructor-must-use-const-object
@TITLE:Why C++ copy constructor must use const object?
@CONTENT:I understand that when we define a class copy constructor of the class is necessary as Rule of three states. I also notice that the argument of the copy constructor is usually const as the following codes illustrate: class ABC
{
   public:
       int a;
       int b;
       ABC(const ABC &other)
       { 
         a = other.a;
         b = other.b;
       }
}
 My question is what would happen if the argument of the copy constructor is not const:   class ABC
    {
       public:
           int a;
           int b;
            ABC(ABC &other)
       { 
         a = other.a;
         b = other.b;
       }
    }
 I understand that in some cases if the argument of the copy constructor is const then the second implementation would fail. Also if the argument of the copy constructor is const then the object to be copied will not change its content during the process. However, I do notice that some people still use the second implementation rather than the first one. Are there any reasons that the second implementation is preferred?
@CODE:const class ABC
{
   public:
       int a;
       int b;
       ABC(const ABC &other)
       { 
         a = other.a;
         b = other.b;
       }
} class ABC
    {
       public:
           int a;
           int b;
            ABC(ABC &other)
       { 
         a = other.a;
         b = other.b;
       }

@CONTENT:I am struggling with breakPoint issue in VS 2012 for more than hours. I am from eclipse background, there I never heard about such issues. Problem : The breakpoint will not currently be hit. No symbols have been loaded for this document. I have placed the break point in click action of Jquery. I found the issue using the IE script debugging., The file loaded was old file., i.e I have modified a lot, but I can see no changes in the one which is loaded in IE. How to fix the bug What I have Tried : I know this question is duplicate, but being a newbie to VS and C#., I could not understand the older answers. For example, in this answer, he told to choose Debug -> Windows -> Modules. But I doesn't have Modules under windows in VS 2012. Also even though I read, I could not understand the explanation. Also I am quite new to term Assemblies and PDB. Though, I located PDB files as he said. But how to open the .pdb file? Need : Could anyone explain me the same answer in easier term (with more explanation).

 I am able to use git extensions and git bash to pull the files, but CruiseControl gives me this error. It is very strange and frustrating, because for a while it worked, I could even create a msbuild file to compile it and so on, but it stoped working without changes and now I am stuck. Does anyone knows what could be happening? thanks! Edit: I increased the timeout to 2 hours. I started the build and I also started in a second machine the pull. I could complete 3 pulls and the info I get in the ccnet is still "git fetch origin". It seems it is locked. Is there any way to check the console output for the operations?

I'm creating a post request with a MultipartFormDataContent, which contains the stream. Everything looks fine when I call PostAsync for the first time.

@TITLE:Haskell Linear-Time Online Algorithm
@CONTENT:Please forgive me if I misused the big words in the title; I'm not too knowledgeable about them but hope they describe my problem. I wrote an elaborate scheme to try and encode strings according to these requirements. For strings of length 10^4 and higher, the code I wrote is quite slow, and I'm wondering - since it processes chunks of 200 at a time (albeit moving only one character forward sometimes to take the next chunk), could it be modified to output the result faster or in a more linear fashion (e.g., immediately output the result for each 200 characters processed). Any help with that or other noticeable optimizations would be appreciated. Per tel's suggestion, I simplified my example: encode xs = encode' xs [] where
  encode' []     result = result
  encode' (z:zs) result
    | null test = encode' zs (result ++ [z])

@CONTENT:I really tried to find a solution to this problem but didn't. There are some threads related to this concept, but I didn't find a comprehensive solution. I have a server with Openfire which sends messages. When both users are online, there is no problem. However, when a user is offline I would like to send a push notification, as in Whatsapp. I heard that Whatsapp and other IM apps use a modified version of ejabber to send push notifications, but couldn't find out how. One possibility is to use GCM, but I am not sure if this is the right way to go. Also I would like to avoid polling, for the sake of not draining battery life. Does anyone know some solution to this or has an example?

@TITLE:django-allauth configuration doubts
@CONTENT:I'm using django-allauth with Django 1.5.1 and I have a few questions when setting it up: 1. Configure urls.py The docs says that you have to add the following to urls.py file: urlpatterns = patterns('',
    ...
    (r'^accounts/', include('allauth.urls')),
    ...
)
 The problem is that I already have a custom app called accounts and I already use the following URL pattern: (r'^accounts/', include('accounts.urls')),
 So I have a naming collision here with the accounts/ regex URL. My question is: can I rename the allauth URL pattern to (r'^auth/', include('allauth.urls')) without having problems, or is it unsafe to do so and it'd be better to rename my own URL to something like (r'^users/', include('users.urls')) (and rename my accounts app to users for naming consistency). 2. Customize allauth default templates What is the proper way to customize the default templates for login, etc.? I think that modifying the library directly is not the best approach. I guess it should be done through templates directory using some concrete directory hierarchy. Also, I don't know if some kind of base.html file must be provided to extend from when overriding these templates or the site's base.html that all pages extend can be used without problems. Could you illustrate me with this? 3. Admin login form shows logins and logouts the first time it's accessed When I access the admin panel after some logins and logouts the history appears, but if I refresh the page then it disappears. I think this must be something related with the django messages: 4. Setting SOCIALACCOUNT_PROVIDERS Is the dictionary setting called SOCIALACCOUNT_PROVIDERS optional or must it be set? 5. How is the password calculated when a user signs in with a 3rd party app? When the user is created it has a password, but how is it calculated? And... is it useful or is it only a placeholder for this required field? Can the user use it to local login? Thanks!
@CODE:urls.py urls.py urlpatterns = patterns('',
    ...
    (r'^accounts/', include('allauth.urls')),
    ...
) accounts (r'^accounts/', include('accounts.urls')), accounts/ allauth (r'^auth/', include('allauth.urls')) (r'^users/', include('users.urls')) templates base.html base.html SOCIALACCOUNT_PROVIDERS SOCIALACCOUNT_PROVIDERS

People who are ok with that can simply install that application as a regular Symfony 2 bundle, by getting it from GitHub and doing all the command line stuff that is needed BUT I want people to be able to install that application very simply and without: any knowledge of symfony requiring access to php composer requiring to type any php command line To do that, I have packaged a zip file containing the whole Symfony code + my bundle. Problem: it seems that the CSS and Javascripts are not properly found, I still need to run a command on the server: php app/console assetic:dump --env=prod --no-debug
 Question 1: How could I get rid of that last step? Question 2: Overall, what would you add to my process before making the zip file? Before making that zip file, here is what I do: Remove all git folders Remove my app/config/parameters.yml file (specific to my dev environment) I also execute the following commands: php app/console cache:clear --env=dev
php app/console cache:clear --env=prod
php app/console doctrine:schema:create --env=dev --dump-sql > create-schema.sql

@TITLE:Rails app crashes on Heroku but runs fine locally -> State changed from starting to crashed
@CONTENT:repo at: git@github.com:assafshomer/sample_app.git This app is my learning app based on Michael Hartl's excellent railstutorial. App runs smoothly in development and test suite is all green When deploying to Heroku I get the following error immediatly: "Application Error. An error occurred in the application and your page could not be served" The problem started after upgrading to Rails4 (but I know the problem is not Rails4 itself because, e.g. git://github.com/railstutorial/sample_app_rails_4.git deploys fine to Heroku) I know you are going to ask "did you migrate the db on Heroku?". I did. I even ran pg:reset and then again rake db:migrate on Heroku just in case. They seemed to have run ok. Heroku logs don't give any info either (at least, nothing I can see as useful) 2013-05-25T22:11:26.070468+00:00 heroku[web.1]: Process exited with

 I submitted a support ticket with Heroku, but that will only be attended to earliest Tuesday, and I'm itching to get this "upgrade to rails4" working already, so, any help in resolving this mystery will be much appreciated. obviously, the best way to reproduce is to clone the repo and deploy to heroku :) Thanks!!

@TITLE:Is it acceptable to use a mix of object oriented style with procedural style in coding PHP?
@CONTENT:So before I always used to use procedural style to code php, such as: mysqli_connect
 or mysqli_prepare
 And now I accidentally began to mix it all up and I would do something like: mysqli_connect();
 which is procedural style, and then the next command: $mysqli->prepare();
 which is object oriented style. My code still works, but if I look at php.net whenever it shows examples the entire example is either object oriented or procedural. So I am asking if its ok for me to use object and procedural php code at the same time. Thank you in advance!

 Now my syster project some-how manages to create its database folder inside apache-tomcat-7.0.40/bin/exampleDB on startup while mine doesn't create it and throws an error as above. The code where the error is thrown is the first time I connect to the database: EntityManager entityManager = PersistenceProvider.createEntityManager();

 There is a static class which resolves the instance based on input. However I observed that every call to ObjectFactory.GetInstance returns new instances on every request instead of a Singleton. There are no threads in the application as well. Any idea on why this is happening? Edit: Does a static resolution helper cause any issues? This is the way I am resolving the instance. Singleton works properly in a sample application but it doesnt work on my machine. To add some more details - the project is MVC Web API and I am testing on local IIS.

@CONTENT:I'm running Python 2.7 with the Pandas 0.11.0 library installed. I've been looking around a haven't found an answer to this question, so I'm hoping somebody more experienced than I has a solution. Lets say my data, in df1, looks like the following: df1=   zip  x  y  access
  123  1  1    4
  123  1  1    6
  133  1  2    3

  167  3  1    1
  167  3  1    2
 Using, for instance, df2 = df1[df1['zip'] == 123] and then df2 = df2.join(df1[df1['zip'] == 133]) I get the following subset of data: df2=  zip  x  y  access
 123  1  1    4
 123  1  1    6
 133  1  2    3
 What I want to do is either: 1) Remove the rows from df1 as they are defined/joined with df2 OR 2) After df2 has been created, remove the rows (difference?) from df1 which df2 is composed of Hope all of that makes sense. Please let me know if any more info is needed. EDIT: Ideally a third dataframe would be create that looks like this: df2=  zip  x  y  access
 145  2  2    3
 167  3  1    1
 167  3  1    2
 That is, everything from df1 not in df2. Thanks!

@TITLE:javascript ImageData typed array read whole pixel?
@CONTENT:So there is are a lot of examples on how to write an entire pixel from a Uint32Array view of the ImageData object. But is it possible to read an entire pixel without incrementing the counter 4 times? From hacks.mozilla.org, writing an rgba pixels looks like this. var imageData = ctx.getImageData(0, 0, canvasWidth, canvasHeight);

var buf = new ArrayBuffer(imageData.data.length);
var buf8 = new Uint8ClampedArray(buf);
var data = new Uint32Array(buf);

for (var y = 0; y < canvasHeight; ++y) {
    for (var x = 0; x < canvasWidth; ++x) {
        var value = x * y & 0xff;

        data[y * canvasWidth + x] =
            (255   << 24) |    // alpha
            (value << 16) |    // blue
            (value <<  8) |    // green
             value;            // red
    }
}

imageData.data.set(buf8);

ctx.putImageData(imageData, 0, 0);
 But, how can I read an entire pixel from a single offset in a 32-bit view of ImageData? Here's what I'm finding confusing, shouldn't the buf32 below have a length of 256/4 = 64? // 8x8 image
var imgd = ctx.getImageData(0, 0, canvasWidth, canvasHeight),
    buf32 = new Uint32Array(imgd.data);

console.log(imgd.data.length);  // 256
console.log(buf32.length);      // 256  shouldn't this be 256/4 ?
 thanks!

@TITLE:WebView detect click in iframe
@CONTENT:I have a WebView where I am loading a javascript that loads some content. That content is an html with an iframe. It seems any click within iframe is not triggering calls to WebViewClient#shouldOverrideUrlLoading(WebView view, String url); The webview has set both WebViewClient and WebChromeClient. A work-around I can see of is to call getSettings().setSupportMultipleWindows(true) on the WebView and then within onCreateWindow(WebView view, boolean isDialog, boolean isUserGesture, Message resultMsg) assume the call was made within iframe and use some inserted javascript in order to get the iframe data. But that seems ugly to me. So, the question: how do you detect a click within iframe loaded within the webview? Thanks!

@CONTENT:Beginning programmer here, just wanting to understand the process behind Ruby's sort method when using the spaceship operator <=>. Hope someone can help. In the following: array = [1, 2, 3]
array.sort { |a, b| a <=> b }
 ... I understand that sort is comparing a pair of numbers at a time and then returning -1 if a belongs before b, 0 if they're equal, or 1 if a should follow b. But in the case of sorting in descending order, like so: array.sort { |a, b| b <=> a }
 ... what exactly is happening? Does sort still compare a <=> b and then flip the result? Or is it interpreting the returns of -1, 0 and 1 with reversed behavior? In other words, why does placing the variables in the block like so: array.sort { |b, a| b <=> a }
 ...result in the same sorting pattern as in the first example?
@CODE:sort <=> array = [1, 2, 3]
array.sort { |a, b| a <=> b } sort -1 a b 0 1 a b array.sort { |a, b| b <=> a } sort a <=> b return -1 0 1 array.sort { |b, a| b <=> a }

@TITLE:Website based on REST in ColdFusion
@CONTENT:My company is about to redesign a big project from scratch. We are currently thinking about how to implement data providers. I used to integrate some webservices in the last few months and pretty much like handling data this way. So I was thinking about a RESTful design. We will be using ColdFusion 10 that comes with REST support, but I actually don't like the component structure required for it. The biggest advantage is probably that we'll be able to use REST to provide data for all our platforms, that is: website, mobile website and iOS/Android app. My security approach would be as follow: Public data can be accessed by anyone (obviously). Private data can be accessed with BasicAuth only. Using BasicAuth also allows us to have user roles with different access levels. The authorization will be implicit and based on the session/login. <!--- server-side example to request customer information (private data, BasicAuth required) --->

 Here are the questions that came to my mind: Is it smart to use this general REST approach for everything on every single page? (Is it smart to use REST on websites to begin with?) Do local HTTP requests impact performance and slow down page loading? Is BasicAuth sufficient to protect the data? (I would just add minor security features such as request-spam-protection to it) Is it best to avoid having dependencies within the webservice like /customer/ accessing /address/ to receive its data? On some of the other (older) website we have file based data providers (includes and components that take care of database access etc.), but we experienced several issues with the more complex pages (such as a checkout process) like name conflicts through includes, intransparent and heavy components, mixing up model/view/controller elements etc.
@CODE:<!--- server-side example to request customer information (private data, BasicAuth required) --->

@TITLE:SubGit: How to exclude branches?
@CONTENT:I'm testing SubGit as a way of migrating from SVN to Git. What I would like to do is be able to create remote branches in the git repository that all users can use that does not sync back to SVN. I only want SubGit to track the master branch and sync it back to SVN so that we have the freedom to use and share other Git branches. Is there a simple way to do this? Thank you

@TITLE:How to read in a local JSON file for testing
@CONTENT:I'm trying to write unit tests for json validation (since the app heavily relies on json from a rest API). I have a local file that contains simple json: "goodFeaturedJson.txt" The contents: {
  "test": "TEST"
}
 The test case: - (void)testJsonIsValid
{
    Featured *featured = [Featured new];

    NSString* filepath = [[NSBundle mainBundle]pathForResource:@"goodFeaturedJson" ofType:@"text"];

    NSData *data = [NSData dataWithContentsOfFile:filepath];

    NSString *jsonString = [[NSString alloc] initWithContentsOfFile:filepath encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding error:nil];//[[NSString alloc] initWithData:data encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];

    id JSON = [NSJSONSerialization JSONObjectWithData:data options:kNilOptions error:nil];

    STAssertTrue([featured jsonIsValid:JSON], @"Featured Data is NOT valid...");    
}
 The test fails every time. The console prints: The json string is: (null)
 Why? I know why the test is failing, since clearly if the data is nil/null there will be no valid json, and the validator will break (which it should if its invalid). There must be something simple I missed here, any ideas?
@CODE:{
  "test": "TEST"
} - (void)testJsonIsValid

@TITLE:Exposing properties of an ExpandoObject
@CONTENT:I've got an ExpandoObject that I'm sending to an external library method which takes an object. From what I've seen this external lib uses TypeDescriptor.GetProperties internally and that seems to cause some problems with my ExpandoObject. I could go with an anonymous object instead and that seems to work but it much more convenient for me to use the ExpandoObject. Do I need to construct my own DynamicObject and take care of it myself by implementing ICustomTypeDescriptor or am I missing something here. Ideas? Update Besides the answer by somedave below (as per the comments), I added this class public class ExpandoObjectTypeDescriptionProvider : TypeDescriptionProvider
{
    private static readonly TypeDescriptionProvider m_Default = TypeDescriptor.GetProvider(typeof(ExpandoObject));

    public ExpandoObjectTypeDescriptionProvider()
        :base(m_Default)
    {
    }

    public override ICustomTypeDescriptor GetTypeDescriptor(Type objectType, object instance)
    {

        return instance == null ? defaultDescriptor :
            new ExpandoObjectTypeDescriptor(instance);

TypeDescriptor.AddProvider(new ExpandoObjectTypeDescriptionProvider(), parameters);

@LINK:/questions/16564000/begintransaction-endtransaction-and-settransactionsuccessful-what-exact
@TITLE:beginTransaction(), endTransaction(), and setTransactionSuccessful(). What exactly do they do?
@CONTENT:I have to provide synchronization when inserting, querying, updating and deleting items from a database. As far as I understand beginTransaction() and beginTransactionNonExclusive() are the methods I need. Besides SQLite documentation describes EXCLUSIVE, IMMEDIATE, and DEFERRED quite well. Transactions can be deferred, immediate, or exclusive. Deferred means that no locks are acquired on the database until the database is first accessed. If the transaction is immediate, then RESERVED locks are acquired on all databases as soon as the BEGIN command is executed, without waiting for the database to be used. After a BEGIN IMMEDIATE, no other database connection will be able to write to the database or do a BEGIN IMMEDIATE or BEGIN EXCLUSIVE. Other processes can continue to read from the database, however. An exclusive transaction causes EXCLUSIVE locks to be acquired on all databases. After a BEGIN EXCLUSIVE, no other database connection except for read_uncommitted connections will be able to read the database and no other connection without exception will be able to write the database until the transaction is complete. It seems to provide some protection from unwanted insertions and queries while some thread is working with the database. But I'm not sure that it guarantees synchronization. There is the insert method of my ContentProvider. @Override
public Uri insert(Uri baseUri, ContentValues values) {
    try {
        mDatabase = mHelper.getWritableDatabase();
        mDatabase.beginTransaction(); // EXCLUSIVE
        switch (sUriMatcher.match(baseUri)) {
        case UriCodes.COUNTRIES:
        case UriCodes.CONTINENTS:
        case UriCodes.ORGS:
            String table = baseUri.getLastPathSegment();
            long rowId = mDatabase.insert(table, null, values);
            Uri uri = Uri.withAppendedPath(baseUri, Long.toString(rowId));
            mDatabase.setTransactionSuccessful();
            return uri;

        default:
            mDatabase.endTransaction();
            throw new IllegalArgumentException(UNSUPPORTED_URI + SPACE + baseUri);
        }
    } finally {
        mDatabase.endTransaction();
    }
}
 I haven't had any problems without beginTransaction(), endTransaction(), and setTransactionSuccessful() before. Do I really need to add them?
@CODE:beginTransaction() beginTransactionNonExclusive() EXCLUSIVE IMMEDIATE DEFERRED insert ContentProvider @Override

But i want the output at runtime (as my process can take hours to complete, i don't get any output for all these hours). So is there any other function that gives me the output dynamically (at runtime), means as soon as the process gives first line, it should get printed.

@CONTENT:Beginning programmer here, just wanting to understand the process behind Ruby's sort method when using the spaceship operator <=>. Hope someone can help. In the following: array = [1, 2, 3]
array.sort { |a, b| a <=> b }
 ... I understand that sort is comparing a pair of numbers at a time and then returning -1 if a belongs before b, 0 if they're equal, or 1 if a should follow b. But in the case of sorting in descending order, like so: array.sort { |a, b| b <=> a }
 ... what exactly is happening? Does sort still compare a <=> b and then flip the result? Or is it interpreting the returns of -1, 0 and 1 with reversed behavior? In other words, why does placing the variables in the block like so: array.sort { |b, a| b <=> a }
 ...result in the same sorting pattern as in the first example?
@CODE:sort <=> array = [1, 2, 3]
array.sort { |a, b| a <=> b } sort -1 a b 0 1 a b array.sort { |a, b| b <=> a } sort a <=> b return -1 0 1 array.sort { |b, a| b <=> a }

@TITLE:Website based on REST in ColdFusion
@CONTENT:My company is about to redesign a big project from scratch. We are currently thinking about how to implement data providers. I used to integrate some webservices in the last few months and pretty much like handling data this way. So I was thinking about a RESTful design. We will be using ColdFusion 10 that comes with REST support, but I actually don't like the component structure required for it. The biggest advantage is probably that we'll be able to use REST to provide data for all our platforms, that is: website, mobile website and iOS/Android app. My security approach would be as follow: Public data can be accessed by anyone (obviously). Private data can be accessed with BasicAuth only. Using BasicAuth also allows us to have user roles with different access levels. The authorization will be implicit and based on the session/login. <!--- server-side example to request customer information (private data, BasicAuth required) --->
<cfset requestedID = 123>
<cfhttp url="/customer/#requestedID#" method="get" username="#APPLICATION.REST_SYSTEMUSER#" password="#APPLICATION.REST_SYSTEMUSER_PW#">
    <cfhttpparam type="url" name="includeAddresses" value="true">
</cfhttp>

<cfset customerJSON = deserializeJSON(CFHTTP.FileContent)>
<cfset customer = createObject("component", "Customer").init(customerJSON)>
 Here are the questions that came to my mind: Is it smart to use this general REST approach for everything on every single page? (Is it smart to use REST on websites to begin with?) Do local HTTP requests impact performance and slow down page loading? Is BasicAuth sufficient to protect the data? (I would just add minor security features such as request-spam-protection to it) Is it best to avoid having dependencies within the webservice like /customer/ accessing /address/ to receive its data? On some of the other (older) website we have file based data providers (includes and components that take care of database access etc.), but we experienced several issues with the more complex pages (such as a checkout process) like name conflicts through includes, intransparent and heavy components, mixing up model/view/controller elements etc.

@TITLE:beginTransaction(), endTransaction(), and setTransactionSuccessful(). What exactly do they do?
@CONTENT:I have to provide synchronization when inserting, querying, updating and deleting items from a database. As far as I understand beginTransaction() and beginTransactionNonExclusive() are the methods I need. Besides SQLite documentation describes EXCLUSIVE, IMMEDIATE, and DEFERRED quite well. Transactions can be deferred, immediate, or exclusive. Deferred means that no locks are acquired on the database until the database is first accessed. If the transaction is immediate, then RESERVED locks are acquired on all databases as soon as the BEGIN command is executed, without waiting for the database to be used. After a BEGIN IMMEDIATE, no other database connection will be able to write to the database or do a BEGIN IMMEDIATE or BEGIN EXCLUSIVE. Other processes can continue to read from the database, however. An exclusive transaction causes EXCLUSIVE locks to be acquired on all databases. After a BEGIN EXCLUSIVE, no other database connection except for read_uncommitted connections will be able to read the database and no other connection without exception will be able to write the database until the transaction is complete. It seems to provide some protection from unwanted insertions and queries while some thread is working with the database. But I'm not sure that it guarantees synchronization. There is the insert method of my ContentProvider. @Override
public Uri insert(Uri baseUri, ContentValues values) {
    try {
        mDatabase = mHelper.getWritableDatabase();
        mDatabase.beginTransaction(); // EXCLUSIVE
        switch (sUriMatcher.match(baseUri)) {
        case UriCodes.COUNTRIES:
        case UriCodes.CONTINENTS:
        case UriCodes.ORGS:
            String table = baseUri.getLastPathSegment();
            long rowId = mDatabase.insert(table, null, values);
            Uri uri = Uri.withAppendedPath(baseUri, Long.toString(rowId));
            mDatabase.setTransactionSuccessful();
            return uri;

        default:
            mDatabase.endTransaction();

@TITLE:Twitter Bootstrap Responsive - Show Table Column only on Desktop
@CONTENT:I'm using DataTables.net + Twitter Bootstrap and the responsive layout, what I'm trying is to hide some columns of the table using the class "visible-desktop" thats shows the columns only in big sizes but It seems not to work, hides well but if I resize the windows to get a desktop width the columns hidden start showing stacked, seems a CSS display class problem, because inherits the type of display from the parent: .visible-desktop {
    display: inherit!important;
}
 If I manipulate it to .visible-desktop {
    display: table-cell!important;
}
 works well... Is there a workaround for this? Or I have to write my own class for table column hidding? Thank you! BR

@TITLE:Combined aggregated and non-aggregate query in SQL
@CONTENT:Not sure how to phrase this question, but I want an aggregate query applied to multiple rows. Hopefully an example should make this easier. Assuming I have the following data:   player  | year | games
-------------------------
ausmubr01 | 2006 | 139
ausmubr01 | 2007 | 117
bondsba01 | 2006 | 130
bondsba01 | 2007 | 126
stairma01 | 2006 | 26
stairma01 | 2006 | 77
stairma01 | 2006 | 14
stairma01 | 2007 | 125
 And for each player in each year, I want to calculate their "career year", i.e. the number of years they've been playing:   player  | year | games | cyear
 --------------------------------
ausmubr01 | 2006 | 139   |  1
ausmubr01 | 2007 | 117   |  2
bondsba01 | 2006 | 130   |  1
bondsba01 | 2007 | 126   |  2
stairma01 | 2006 | 26    |  1
stairma01 | 2006 | 77    |  2
stairma01 | 2006 | 14    |  3
stairma01 | 2007 | 125   |  4
 It would be natural to express this transformation as SELECT player, year, games, year - min(year) + 1 as cyear FROM baseball GROUP by player but because of the rules for aggregate queries the expression is only evaluated once for each group:   player  | year | games | cyear
 --------------------------------
ausmubr01 | 2006 | 139   |  1
bondsba01 | 2006 | 130   |  1
stairma01 | 2006 | 26    |  1
 How can I overcome this problem in general (i.e. not just for this case but whenever I want to perform an arithmetic operation combining an existing column and a single per-group number computed with an aggregate function)?
@CODE:player  | year | games
-------------------------
ausmubr01 | 2006 | 139

@TITLE:FileSystemWatcher under mono - watching subdirs
@CONTENT:I have a problem. I have written a wrapper over FileSystemWatcher that detects changes in root folder and all of its subfolders. Nothing fancy: FileSystemWatcher watcher = new FileSystemWatcher ();
watcher.Path = this.Root;
watcher.IncludeSubdirectories = true;
watcher.NotifyFilter = NotifyFilters.LastWrite | NotifyFilters.LastAccess | NotifyFilters.DirectoryName | NotifyFilters.FileName;
watcher.Changed += new FileSystemEventHandler (watcher_Changed);
watcher.Deleted += new FileSystemEventHandler (watcher_Deleted);
watcher.Created += new FileSystemEventHandler (watcher_Created);
watcher.Renamed += new RenamedEventHandler (watcher_Renamed);
watcher.EnableRaisingEvents = true;
 While in .NET, under Windows, it works like a charm. But when I ported the code to mono and ran the code under OSX, it works properly only in the root folder. Issues I have noticed by now: Events are not raised for operations within folders already existing under root at the time the watcher starts Paths I get via EventArgs.FullPath property are not correct (when I copy a file to path_to_root/some/more/subdirs/some.file, the path I get is just path_to_root/some.file). The issue with unproper paths has been already reported one year ago (and looks like it was solved) but my mono comes from December last year (MonoDevelop says in References section it is version 4.0.0.0, it is all I can say about the distribution) and the bugs are still there... See: https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=5747 Any ideas? I am really curious if there is a workaround not requiring writing own watcher that polls the file system repeatedly or starting separate watcher for every folder under root... Thanks in advance!

@TITLE:How To Make Twitter Typeahead Exact Match Words and Phrases
@CONTENT:Twitters Typeahead matches any word anywhere in a phrase so for a search for "car" results can come from a phrase with a second word that matches "car". For instance when searching for car in a list with business card. Business card appears and even worse it appears before car. IE: Search Term: Car
Suggestions:
Business Card
Car
Car Pool
Carbon
 I want it to be more google and twitter like (they never suggest something that isn't matching exactly what is typed from the beginning) where the typed word is the most relevant, so Car would be more relevant when typing car than Business Card. I want it to actually just STOP matching the second word until someone types a space and starts a second word. So in the above example business card would not appear in the list unless I typed: Business C
 How can I stop this behavior of matching and suggesting words that aren't an exact match from the start of the typed search. Another way to say this would be how to stop the typeahead from tokenizing or splitting on the space. The typeahead always matches from the start of a word (^), so if the space wasn't recognized as a word boundary it would work more as google and twitters users would expect. Thanks for any help, Tyler UPDATE 1. I updated my Dataset to return a Datum that has a value and token so that the typeahead _transformDatum method does not tokenize the tokens by splitting on a space. This works great and now it works as desired: Values: Apple, Great Ape Search Term: Ap Suggestions: Apple This is what I want. But now there is a new issue. ISSUE: When using a search term with a space no suggestions are returned. So now when I type "great " the suggestions stop as soon as I type a space.: Search Term: Great (with a space) Suggestions: (none) I'm thinking that tokens can NOT have spaces. Even though the documentation doesn't explicitly say this in an issue: The canonical form of a datum is an object with a value property and a tokens property. value is the string that represents the underlying value of the datum and tokens is a collection of strings that aid typeahead.js in matching datums with a given query.
@CODE:Search Term: Car

 The java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space error occurs each time I use GROUP or JOIN in a pig script executed in local mode. There is no error when the script is executed in mapreduce mode on HDFS. Question 1: How come there is a OutOfMemory error while the data sample is minuscule and local mode is supposed to use less resources than HDFS mode? Question 2: Is there a solution to run successfully a small pig scripts with GROUP or JOIN in local mode? Thanks in advance for any help.

@TITLE:Select element from array with probability proportional to its value
@CONTENT:I have an array of doubles and I want to select a value from it with the probability of each value being selected being inversely proportional to its value. For example: arr[0] = 100
arr[1] = 200
 In this example, element 0 would have a 66% of being selected and element 1 a 33% chance. I am having difficulty coding this. What I have done so far is to calculate the total value of the array (the example would be 300), then I've played around with inversing the numbers before calculating them as a percentage of the total. I can't get anything to work. In the end I desire: new randomNumber
for(int y=0; y < probabilities.length; y++){
     if(randomNumber < probabilities[y]){
          Select probabilities[y]
     }
}
 Or something to that affect. Any help? Coding is in Java but I can adapt any pseudocode.
@CODE:arr[0] = 100
arr[1] = 200 new randomNumber
for(int y=0; y < probabilities.length; y++){

@TITLE:console.log(array) shows different array contents than iterating the array and displaying the individual elements
@CONTENT:I have the following code: console.log("start");
for(var i = 0; i < array.length; i++){
    console.log(i + " = " + array[i]);
}
console.log(array);
console.log("end");
 This gives me the following output: [16:34:41.171] start

[16:34:41.172] 1 = 168

[16:34:41.172] [0, 168, 171, 139]
[16:34:41.172] end
 That is, it doesn't show the 139 element when iterating the array, but console.log does print it when outputting the whole array. WHY? (<-- the question) I do modify the array later on, is the console.log somehow delayed until after I changed the array? Note tho that change the order of the statements, and putting consoel.log(array) directly at the start does not change the outcome (still different outputs). I am using firefox 20.0
@CODE:console.log("start");
for(var i = 0; i < array.length; i++){

    CLLocationCoordinate2D tmp;
    MKCoordinateSpan radiusSpan = MKCoordinateRegionMakeWithDistance(self.coordinate, 0, self.radius).span;
    tmp.latitude = self.coordinate.latitude - radiusSpan.longitudeDelta;

    MKMapRect bounds = MKMapRectMake(upperLeft.x, upperLeft.y, self.radius * 2, self.radius * 2);

}
 MKMapRectMake(...) seems to want width and height measured in Map points. How do I convert the radius to that? In the end I'm rendering it like this: MKMapRect theMapRect = [self.overlay boundingMapRect];
CGRect theRect = [self rectForMapRect:theMapRect];
CGContextAddEllipseInRect(ctx, theRect);
CGContextFillPath(ctx);
 The radius doesn't seem to equal meters on the map in the end and also the distance doesn't seem to be measured correctly. How to do it right? I would be really thankful for every hint.
@CODE:- (MKMapRect)boundingMapRect{

@TITLE:effectively unlocking an SQLite database
@CONTENT:I have a program which frequently crashes (Zotero), leaving its SQLite database locked and inaccessible for use by the restarted program unless I reboot (which I really want to avoid). So this does not work (using the generic name, db.sqlite in place of the actual file in my case, zotero.sqlite): sqlite3 db.sqlite
sqlite> .backup main backup.sqlite
Error: database is locked
 Based on an answer here, I tried: echo ".dump" | sqlite3 db.sqlite | sqlite3 db.sqlite2
mv db.sqlite2 db.sqlite
 db.sqlite2 is 0KB so this obviously did not work. Inspired by another thread, I also tried echo '.dump' | sqlite3 db.sqlite > db.dump
cat db.dump | sqlite3 db.sqlite2
mv db.sqlite2 db.sqlite
 which leads to db.sqlite2 which is slightly smaller in filesize to db.sqlite, and Zotero (the file which requires the database) was not able to recognize its contents. So this seems like a very brute force way of doing it, but worked: cp -pv db.sqlite db.sqlite2
rm -f db.sqlite
mv db.sqlite2 db.sqlite
 I wonder if there are any drawbacks to this solution and why the other methods are proposed before this one.

 and it only shows the formula as a string, e.g. =Table1!A1. I cannot make it update. Neither with CalucalteAll(), nor with RefreshAll(), nor with anyhing. Any suggestions how to achieve an update in the datasheet? EDIT : You can set an entire array with a single statement Range.set_Value(Missing.Value, myFormulas). My question is how to make excel evaluate the formulas in this array (and not treat them as simple strings, or setting the cells one by one which Excel than recalculates.)?

def list () {

}
 I would like to build a simple API for these actions. The save action should accept parameters as JSON and provide a successful message if the records save. The list action should provide the list as JSON Questions Should I make a separate URL mapping for api? (e.g. http://<domain>/<app>/rest/controller/action) Should I be making a separate controller for my API's I am using spring security plugin for authentication. But at some point I might want to authenticate the restful api as well. What are some solutions for that? If I use the same controller, how can I modify these simple actions to do what I need.

 I get a java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space message. That makes sense to me, since it's trying to build up a massive list in memory of all these IO and Promise objects. A few questions: Does anyone have any ideas on how to avoid this? It feels like I'm approaching the problem incorrectly, because I really only care about the longRunningProcess for its side-effects. Is the Enumerator approach here the wrong approach? I'm pretty much out of ideas, so anything will help. Thanks! Update #1 Here is the stack trace: [error] java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space

 I am currently taking the advice of nadavwr to ensure everything is acting like I think it is. I will report back any updates. Update #2 Using ideas from both the answers below, I found a decent solution. As huynhjl suggested (and I verified using nadavwr's suggestion of analyzing the heap dump), consume was causing every inflated ZipEntry to be held in memory, which is why the process was running out of memory. I changed consume to foldM and updated the long-running process to just return a Promise[IOE[Unit]] instead of a reference to the file. That way I have a collection of all IoExceptions at the end. Here is the working solution: def action(f:File):IO[List[Promise[IOE[Unit]]]] = (
  foldM[Promise[IOE[Unit]], IO, List[Promise[IOE[Unit]]]](List.empty)((acc,x) => IO(x :: acc)) %=
  map[IOE[File], Promise[IOE[Unit]], IO](longRunningProcess) %=
  map[IOE[IO[File]], IOE[File], IO](_.unsafePerformIO) &=
  enumZipFile(f)
).run

def longRunningProcess:(iof:IOE[File]):Promise[IOE[Unit]] =
  Promise { Thread.sleep(5000); iof.map(println) }
 This solution inflates each entry while asynchronously uploading them. At the end, I have a huge list of fulfilled Promise objects that contain any errors. I still not fully convinced this is the correct use of an Iteratee, but I do now have several reusable, composeable pieces that I can use in other pieces of our system (this is a very common pattern for us). Thanks for all your help!

@TITLE:How does Zurb Foundation Switch control work
@CONTENT:I recently started using Zurb Foundation 4 for an Asp MVC website and I don't quite understand how the switch control is supposed to work. The docs don't say much http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/switch.html <div class="switch">
  <input id="x" name="switch-x" type="radio" checked>
  <label for="x" onclick="">Off</label>

  <input id="x1" name="switch-x" type="radio">
  <label for="x1" onclick="">On</label>

  <span></span>
</div>
 I'm using this example code, when I click on the switch, there is no change in the html. I figured the "checked" attribute would go on the second input, but this is not the case. How can I detect which radio button has been clicked ? When I POST the form, the "switch-x" variable contains the value "on" no matter what position the switch is in. I tried adding an onclick event on the label, but it's not getting fired as something seems to be overlapping the label. I'm using foundation's javascript, I don't have any errors on the page. I'm definitely missing something... Any ideas ?

The events table contains a field called 'course_id' which relates to the ID of the 'id' field in the courses table. So basically, I'm after some advice on how you go about relating the two (belongsTo()?) and then passing the connected data to the view. Here is where I am at so far http://paste.laravel.com/pf3.

@TITLE:findViewById() returns null - tried EVERYTHING
@CONTENT:I give up... not even my professor knows why this is happening. The problem is: No matter where or how I call for this layout's components, they always return null. LAYOUT: search_layout. 2 EdiText and 2 TextView children. RUNTIME: setView(inflater.inflate(R.layout.search_layout, null)) // works fine, it displays the layout inside the dialog, yet, children are always returned as null by findViewById(R.id.some_search_layout_children)
 EXCEPTION: Parsing exception of the XML, as resource not found, hence null. TRIED: Cleaned my project around 1024 times, tried to implement another class for my dialog box, same result, called findViewById as a member of my main activity, inside the method initSearch() and inside an anonymous implementation of OnClickListener for my dialog, SAME RESULT. Broke the children into independent views and programmatically called them: TextView text = (TextView) findResourceById(R.id.new_independant_textview); // same result
 I think I tried everything. This is my Code: public class Xyz extends Activity {
    public void onCreate(...) { // some listener will trigger initSearch() }

    private void initSearch() {
        AlertDialog.Builder searchDialog = new AlertDialog.Builder(this);
        LayoutInflater inflater = this.getLayoutInflater();
        searchDialog.setTitle("Search Photos");
        searchDialog.setMessage("Specify tag and value...");
        // R.layout.search_dialog is my custom layour, it displays fine, it works. 
        searchDialog.setView(inflater.inflate(R.layout.search_dialog, null));
        EditText tagText = (EdiText) findViewById(R.id.tagField); // WILL RETURN NULL
        searchDialog.setPositiveButton( ... ) ...
        searchDialog.show();
    }
 Now, when I do:  EditText text = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.tagField); // returns null, ALWAYS
 // no matter HOW, WHERE, global, local final, etc, it just returns null.

@TITLE:Avoid instanceof in a composite pattern
@CONTENT:I'm working on a project for university where we're programming a game. In this game several effects can occur and one effect can affect how another effect behaves. Now one of the idea's was using a composite pattern which seemed like a solid solution at first. The biggest problem here is that the way an effect behaves depends on what effect it's coupled with and the only way we saw to fix this was using .getClass() or instanceof which we want to avoid at all cost. What are some ways to design this issue? Edit (a small example): I don't have a explicit code example but I'll try to clarify a bit with the following example: So the game has grenades (which can obviously explode and cause damage), this explosion is seen as an "ExplosionEffect". The square that the grenade is positioned on can have a powerfailure at runtime (PowerfailureEffect). The ExplosionEffect and PowerfailureEffect can be coupled and this causes the explosion to be stronger and cause more damage. The ExplosionEffect can also be coupled with other effects causing the explosion damage to behave even more differently

@LINK:/questions/16172304/rest-expanding-relationships
@TITLE:REST - expanding relationships
@CONTENT:I am building an event management system. The schema is described below. The API understands these relations and returns links to related resources in the request result. For example, GET /Events/1

    "links": {
    "Venue": "/Venues/1",
    "Tickets": "/Tickets?event_id=1",
    "Teams": "/Teams?event_id=1",
    "Registrations": "/Registrations?event_id=1"
}
 Most of what I've read about REST and HATEOAS suggests this is the "right" way to do it however it is very inefficient. For example, if I want to generate a report of users and teams participating in an event it requires many requests. This is analogous to running several select queries instead of running a single join query against a DB. So my question is, should I expand the relationships and embed related resources within a resource request? This also poses a problem b/c the request above will return A LOT of data. The answer might be to stick with the relationship links and setup proper caching. Regardless, I would like your opinions. Schema

I'm using version 1.21 of the Gradle plugin, but it isn't finding the properties file when I put it in the user home .gradle directory. Any pointers would be much appreciated. Thanks UPDATED The Gradle plugin looks by default in the workspace of each project for a gradle.properties file. In order to use one file across all jobs, you need to set your gradle home in your job configurations as follows, by adding the following under 'switches': -Dgradle.user.home=$HOME/.gradle

@TITLE:CORS preflight request returning 403 Forbidden; subsequent request then only sending in Chrome
@CONTENT:After failure using pluploader in this question, I'm now trying FineUploader. After reading up on CORS, I've implemented various headers on my IIS6 server. What seems to happen is that my script fires the first (preflight) authorisation request, which fails, but Chrome allows the second (standard) request to send anyway - Firefox does not. I presume this is actually a bug on behalf of Chrome, but at least it has allowed me to work out that my script is probably working correctly. Here is the first (preflight) request as seen in Chrome and FF: OPTIONS /frog/LOTS/upload/php.php HTTP/1.1

 The Access-Control... headers are those that I've added to IIS. And here are my response headers: HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden

Date: Mon, 22 Apr 2013 15:19:20 GMT
 I've tried to compare the two side by side but I can't find any missing headers which would cause the preflight request to return a 403 Forbidden error. I haven't included my PHP source as it's a lot of code. Suffice to say that it does work in Chrome and that the file is correctly uploaded, so the script should be correct. The only thing which may be worth mentioning is that I've got a header("Content-Type: text/plain"); at the start of my script. Changing that to text/html makes no difference to Chrome nor FireFox. The JavaScript is quite straightforward: $('#jquery-wrapped-fine-uploader').fineUploader({
    request: {
        endpoint: 'http://staff.curriculum.local/frog/LOTS/upload/php.php'
    },
    cors: {
        expected: true, //all requests are expected to be cross-domain requests
        sendCredentials: true //if you want cookies to be sent along with the request
    }
});
 Can anyone help? I've spent literally 8 hours on this single problem today and I'm >< close to ripping my own face off....!! Thanks in advance,

@TITLE:How to extend a lightweight provider in Chef
@CONTENT:I am creating a bunch of different Chef providers to deploy different types of applications. Chef's documentation for Extend a Lightweight Provider suggests it is possible but doesn't actually say what to do. That page suggests that perhaps a call to mixin is needed, but I don't know what structure my code should have in the file under /libraries or how to actually include that code in something under /providers. Here are the examples of what I want to do. In my base class under /libraries: repository "http://my.svn.server/#{deployment[:project]}/branches/#{node[:chef_environment]}/"
user "deploy"
scm_provider Chef::Provider::Subversion
svn_username "svn_user"
svn_password "password"
 In my provider for Torquebox Rails app deployments: deploy_revision "/my/deployment/directory/#{deployment[:project]}" do
  # Magically mixin the code from libraries
  environment "RAILS_ENV" => node[:chef_environment]
  restart_command "rake torquebox:deploy"
end
 And then of course other types of providers for different types of applications. Can anyone point me in the right direction on this? Is there documentation somewhere I'm missing?
@CODE:mixin /libraries /providers /libraries repository "http://my.svn.server/#{deployment[:project]}/branches/#{node[:chef_environment]}/"
user "deploy"
scm_provider Chef::Provider::Subversion
svn_username "svn_user"

  # Magically mixin the code from libraries
  environment "RAILS_ENV" => node[:chef_environment]

@TITLE:How to implement offline capable Single Page Application with Breeze.js and HTML5 local storage
@CONTENT:I have working Single Page Application using Breeze.js for Data Access. It uses the Breeze.js to execute queries against the local cache and the data is requested only once at start up. Only the data updates are posted back on the server afterwards. I am looking for a solution to make the application connection aware. If the mobile device does not have internet connection the changes will be saved locally with Breeze.js and HTML5 local storage. When the mobile device is back online the changes will be synched to the remote data storage. Any guidelines how to implement that requirement? Thanks

@TITLE:Failed to deploy artifacts: Could not find artifact
@CONTENT:I want to deploy a library to my companies remote repository. So its the first time I want to deploy the library project to the remote repositry. I get the following error message: org.sonatype.aether.transfer.ArtifactNotFoundException: Could not find artifact com.http:httpkit:jar:0.0.1 in internal.repo (http://jenkins.internal.com/) Maybe I understand something complete wrong, but the error message says, that in the remote repository doesn't exist the artifact that I try to deploy for the first time.

@LINK:/questions/16098066/how-to-use-extractor-in-polymorphic-unapply
@TITLE:How to use extractor in polymorphic unapply?
@CONTENT:I don't really get this little thingy. I have an abstract class Box with several sub-classes for different types. For example abstract class Box
class StringBox(val sValue : String) extends Box
 The apply method in the companion object for Box is simple: object Box{
    def apply(s: String)  = new StringBox(s)
    def apply(b: Boolean) = new BooleanBox(b)
    def apply(d: Double)  = new DoubleBox(d)
}
 so I can write     val sb = Box("StringBox)
 Okay, writing unapply makes some trouble. My first idea was to use pattern matching on the type, like this this: def unapply(b: Box) = b match {
  case sb: StringBox => Some(sb.sValue)
  case bb: BooleanBox => Some(bb.bValue)
  case db: DoubleBox => Some(db.dValue)
  case _ => None
 } Which simply doesn't work because of type erasures. Second attempt was a generic Box[T] with type T and an abstract type member re-defined in each sub classes. For instance:  abstract class Box[T] {def value : T}
 class StringBox(val sValue : String)  extends Box[String] { 
   override def value : String = sValue
 }
 Consequently, I can re write my unapply as: def unapply[T](b: Box[T]) = b match {
  case sb: Box[String]  => Some(sb.value)
  case bb: Box[Boolean] => Some(bb.value)
  case db: Box[Double]  => Some(db.value)
  case _ => None
 Unfortunately, this doesn't work either. So I guess the explicit type reference in Box[String] gets erased as well so I need to use a type manifest instead. Maybe something like: def unapply[T](b: Box[_])(implicit target: Manifest[T]): Option[T] = {

   if(b.value ==  target) Some(b.value.asInstanceOf[T])
   else None 
}
 This code compiles (2.10) but still does not the desired implicit conversion. Why? Simple question, is there a way to do value extraction without using reflection or a manifest? What really boggles me is the question if there is a simple(r) way to combine polymorphism and pattern matching? If not, are there other ways in Scala to accomplish a similar effect? Any idea or suggestions? Thank you very much.
@CODE:abstract class Box

    def apply(d: Double)  = new DoubleBox(d)
} val sb = Box("StringBox) def unapply(b: Box) = b match {
  case sb: StringBox => Some(sb.sValue)
  case bb: BooleanBox => Some(bb.bValue)
  case db: DoubleBox => Some(db.dValue)
  case _ => None abstract class Box[T] {def value : T}
 class StringBox(val sValue : String)  extends Box[String] { 
   override def value : String = sValue
 } def unapply[T](b: Box[T]) = b match {
  case sb: Box[String]  => Some(sb.value)

@TITLE:How equals() method works
@CONTENT:I am digging into the basics of Java. I infer from this article, that java equals method means, if two objects are equal then they must have the same hashCode(). Here's my example. public class Equals {

    /**
     * @param args
     */
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String a = new String("a"); 
        String b = new String("a");
        System.out.println("a.hashCode() "+a.hashCode());
        System.out.println("b.hashCode() "+b.hashCode());
        System.out.println(a == b); 
        System.out.println(a.equals(b));

    }

}
 output: a.hashCode() 97 b.hashCode() 97 false true Actual Java language equals method   public boolean equals(Object obj) { 
    return (this == obj); 
  }
 In my above example, a.equals(b) has returned true, meaning the condition a==b is satisfied. But then why a==b is returning false in that example? Aren't hashCode and address one and same? Also, is hashCode compared when we say a==b or something else?
@CODE:public class Equals {

    /**
     * @param args
     */
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String a = new String("a"); 
        String b = new String("a");
        System.out.println("a.hashCode() "+a.hashCode());
        System.out.println("b.hashCode() "+b.hashCode());
        System.out.println(a == b); 
        System.out.println(a.equals(b));

    }

} public boolean equals(Object obj) {

@CONTENT:We have a bushy tree in a bucket on Amazon S3 with a large number of files. I just discovered that while some files have two permissions entries, as seen if one clicks on a file in the AWS Management Console, then properties -> permissions, one line being "everyone" and the other some specific user, other files just have one entry for that user. As the results, we're having issues downloading those files to Amazon EC2 instances using boto or curl. What I need to do is go over all files in the bucket and inspect them. I know how to get the full list of keys for a prefix. Can I use boto to extract permissions for a key, and is there a standard way of testing if those permissions are for everyone or someone specific, and what they are? Also, once I determine if a key has restrictive permissions, can I programmatically change them by adding read permissions to "everyone"? Thx

So my question is Is there some kind of underlying philosophy/reasoning behind the logic of type comparisons on PHP? For example, I can see that for loose comparisons: 1, -1, "1" and "-1" can be treated as TRUE and 0 and "0" can be treated as FALSE; Comparing the string value of a number against the number itself with yield TRUE; but it becomes a bit hairy from then on trying to establish a pattern.

        viewHolder.txtTitle.setText(album.getTitle(locale));
        viewHolder.txtDescription.setText(album.getCopyrightInfo(locale));
        ...
        return convertView;
    }
 while the ViewHolder class is usually looks like: static class ViewHolder{
    public ImageView previewImage;
    public TextView txtTitle;
    public TextView txtDescription;
}
 My questions is about ViewHolder implementation. 1) Why doesn't it use a constructor instead of initializing every single field? 2) Why does it use the default access type instead of protected (actually it has to be private but this impacts performance due to static accessors created byt JIT)? Well, I guess its about inheritance only. So why the following pattern is not better (excluding "protected vs default" access type): protected static class ViewHolder{
    public final ImageView previewImage;
    public final TextView txtTitle;
    public final TextView txtDescription;

    public ViewHolder (final ImageView previewImage,  final TextView txtTitle, final TextView txtDescription){
        this.previewImage = previewImage;
        this.txtTitle = txtTitle;
        this.txtDescription = txtDescription;
    }
}
 and the only change in ListAdapter is: ...
final TextView txtDescription = (TextView) convertView.findViewById(R.id.album_copyright);
viewHolder = new ViewHolder(albumImage, txtTitle, txtDescription);
convertView.setTag(viewHolder);
...
 Anyway it must call a constructor. Is it just a matter of taste? Or is this version slower somehow or does it impact performance in some way?
@CODE:...

    @Override
    public View getView(final int position, View convertView, final ViewGroup parent) {

        final Album album = albums.get(position);

        ViewHolder viewHolder = null;
        if (convertView==null){
            convertView = inflater.inflate(R.layout.albums_list_item, null);

            final ImageView albumImage = (ImageView) convertView.findViewById(R.id.album_icon);

            final TextView txtTitle = (TextView) convertView.findViewById(R.id.album_title);

            final TextView txtDescription = (TextView) convertView.findViewById(R.id.album_copyright);

            viewHolder = new ViewHolder();
            viewHolder.albumImage = albumImage;
            viewHolder.txtTitle = txtTitle;
            viewHolder.txtDescription = txtDescription;
            convertView.setTag(viewHolder);
        }
        else
            viewHolder = (ViewHolder)convertView.getTag();

        viewHolder.txtTitle.setText(album.getTitle(locale));
        viewHolder.txtDescription.setText(album.getCopyrightInfo(locale));
        ...
        return convertView;

    int value = source[i];//ushort -> int
    destination[i] = value*factor;//int*float->float

 A few details Value should go from 0 to 2^16-1, it represents the pixel values of a highly sensitive camera I'm on a multicore x86 machine with an i7 processor (i7 960 which is SSE 4.2 and 4.1). Source is aligned to an 8 bit boundary (a requirement of the hardware device) W*H is always divisible by 8, most of the time W and H are divisible by 8 This makes me sad, is there anything I can do about it?

@TITLE:Validate date depending on region
@CONTENT:I have an MVC4 app which is compiled in the UK and hosted on a US server. In my model I have a date field which is required. Attached to this field is a date picker, on selecting a date it will set a date to be UK format "DD/MM/YYYY" e.g. 23/12/2013. On submitting the form the application throws a validation error as it does not expect the the format. In MVC4 how do I: Accept both date formats i.e. Override the date format? I have set the date format but cannot specify multiple date formats Server side I am saving the date to a database using Linq. This also throws an error as an incorrect format. I suspect I will need to convert to a UK date? When loading the details put the date in the correct format depending on the user's location Detect the location of the user server side? Has anyone got any details on how to very validation based on globalisation of the user? Thanks

@CONTENT:I have a text file with one sentence per line. I would like to lemmatize the worlds in each line using hunspell (-s option). Since I want to have the lemmas of each line separately, it wouldn't make sense to submit the whole text file to hunspell.

How interact with the process sending the line and reading the output before send another line? My current code to read the whole text file is (defun parse-spell-sb (file-in)
  (with-open-file (in file-in)
    (let ((p (sb-ext:run-program "/opt/local/bin/hunspell" (list "-i" "UTF-8" "-s" "-d" "pt_BR")

@TITLE:Dynamically creating a query based on params being passed to a controller
@CONTENT:In my task management application, users should be able to filter tasks based on : assignedTo, priority, status and/or dueDate I am not sure on how to create a dynamic query in that it will build a query based on the available parameters. For example : If I have a URL such as : task/index?assignedTo=1&status=2 I can build a query based on only these two parameters. The method I am used to is the Task.findAllByAssignedToAndStatus(
   User.get(params.assignedTo),
   TaskStatus.get(params.status)
)
 I obviously dont want to implement a DRY method by writing out each findAllBy query for every possible URL parameter combination. Is there a good way to do this in grails?
@CODE:assignedTo priority status dueDate task/index?assignedTo=1&status=2 Task.findAllByAssignedToAndStatus(
   User.get(params.assignedTo),
   TaskStatus.get(params.status)
) findAllBy "findAllBy${params.collect { k, v -> k.capitalize() }.join( 'And' )}" assignedTo User status TaskStatus

What am I doing wrong here? upd: I tried to call the it.attach method before the properties are checked, but right after the method call the value of it.attached is false.

@LINK:/questions/15935900/how-to-show-page-preloader-only-once-while-entering-through-domain-name
@TITLE:How to show page preloader only once while entering through domain name?
@CONTENT:So, I have jQuery page preloader on main page like this: <script type="text/javascript">
    $(window).load(function() {
        $("#preloader").delay(700).fadeOut("slow");
    })
 <div id="preloader" class="preloader"></div>
 This shows 4 times: When I enter the site through domain name; When I refresh main page by F5; When I click on logo (i must go to main page when i clicked that); When I click ?Home? menu item. But i want to show it only on first two times. So, the first idea which came in my mind is delete div class to not show preloader image over whole page when i clicking logo or menu item by JS. And have used this: document.getElementById("preloader").className = 'test'; But then... I realized that by clicking menu item to load main page again, i create new copy of document, so my preloader has his class again and showed up. So, i decided to use AJAX and to not reload whole page by clicking menu item or logo. Now i use this:      <script type="text/javascript">
        $(document).ready(function(){
             $("#blog, #logo").click(function(){
                 $("#container").load("/blog");
                 document.getElementById("preloader").className = 'test';
             });
        });
    </script>
 So, when i click logo or menu item i load my category called ?blog? in container. And my side bar looks like this: ...        
<a href="javascript:;" id="logo"><i class="logo"></i></a>
...
<li class="m_blog"><a id="blog" href="javascript:;"><i class="icon"></i>Blog</a></li>
...
 So, it works! Preloader appear only when you open site through domain name. But 1 problem appear. When i open category ?video? i have adress like this: mysite.com/video/ And when i came back to main page through logo or menu i have same adress! Because content loading without reload whole page and adress doesn't change. How i can fix it? Help me, please! I just want to show my preloader only once: when i came through domain name or refresh main page by F5. I already feel dizzy, because i only know HTML and CSS, but today start to learn AJAX and jQuery. Help me in this matter.
@CODE:<script type="text/javascript">
    $(window).load(function() {
        $("#preloader").delay(700).fadeOut("slow");
    }) <div id="preloader" class="preloader"></div> div <script type="text/javascript">
        $(document).ready(function(){
             $("#blog, #logo").click(function(){

             });
        });

@TITLE:Calculating items included in branch and bound knapsack
@CONTENT:Using a branch and bound algorithm I have evaluated the optimal profit from a given set of items, but now I wish to find out which items are included in this optimal solution. I'm evaluating the profit value of the optimal knapsack as follows (adapted from here): import Queue

class Node:
    def __init__(self, level, profit, weight):
        self.level = level # The level within the tree (depth)
        self.profit = profit # The total profit
        self.weight = weight # The total weight

def solveKnapsack(weights, profits, knapsackSize):
    numItems = len(weights)
    queue = Queue.Queue()
    root = Node(-1, 0, 0)    
    queue.put(root)

    maxProfit = 0
    bound = 0
    while not queue.empty():
        v = queue.get() # Get the next item on the queue

        uLevel = v.level + 1 
        u = Node(uLevel, v.profit + e[uLevel][1], v.weight + e[uLevel][0])

        bound = getBound(u, numItems, knapsackSize, weights, profits)

        if u.weight <= knapsackSize and u.profit > maxProfit:
            maxProfit = uProfit

        if bound > maxProfit:    
            queue.put(u)

        u = Node(uLevel, v.profit, v.weight)
        bound = getBound(u, numItems, knapsackSize, weights, profits)

        if (bound > maxProfit):
            queue.put(u)
    return maxProfit

# This is essentially the brute force solution to the fractional knapsack
def getBound(u, numItems, knapsackSize, weight, profit):
    if u.weight >= knapsackSize: return 0
    else:
        upperBound = u.profit
        totalWeight = u.weight
        j = u.level + 1
        while j < numItems and totalWeight + weight[j] <= C:
            upperBound += profit[j]
            totalWeight += weights[j]
            j += 1
        if j < numItems:
            result += (C - totalWeight) * profit[j]/weight[j]
        return upperBound

        uLevel = v.level + 1 
        u = Node(uLevel, v.profit + e[uLevel][1], v.weight + e[uLevel][0])

        bound = getBound(u, numItems, knapsackSize, weights, profits)

@TITLE:regular expression goes into infinite loop
@CONTENT:I am parsing (species) names of the form: Parus Ater

Tyr. rex
 which normally have two terms (binomial) but sometimes have 3 or more. Troglodytes troglodytes troglodytes 
E. rubecula sensu stricto
 I wrote [A-Z][a-z]*\.?\s+[a-z][a-z]+(\s*[a-z]+)*
 which worked most of the time but occasionally went into an infinite loop. It took some time to track down that it was in the regex matching and then I realised it was a typo and I should have written [A-Z][a-z]*\.?\s+[a-z][a-z]+(\s+[a-z]+)*
 which performs properly. My questions are: why does this loop happen? is there a way I can check for similar regex errors before running the program? Otherwise it may be difficult to trap them before the prgram is distributed and cause problems. [Note: I don't need a more general expression for species - there is a formal 100+ line regex specification for Species names - this was just an initial filter]. NOTE: The problem arose because although most names were extracted precisely into 2 or occasionally 3/4 terms (as they were in italics) there were a few false positives (like "Homo sapiens lives in big cities like London") and the match fails at "L".] NOTE: In debugging this I have found that the regex was often completing but being very slow (e.g. on shorter target strings). It is valuable that I found this bug through a pathological case. I have learnt an important lesson!

@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: How to add a device to an existing Ad-Hoc Provisioning Profile? 3 answers Edit April 9, 2013 Apple responded to my bug report on this matter and reported that "The problem has been fixed." I have confirmed that the problem is fixed. I can now add devices to older Ad Hoc provisioning profiles that were created before the website update. The problem is now resolved. Asside: Please note that underscore characters (_) are no longer permitted in the names of new provisioning profiles. As of this previous weekend April 6, 2013, it appears impossible to add devices to my existing Ad Hoc provisioning profiles on the Apple Developer Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles page. There are many questions on StackOverflow describing how to add devices to iOS Ad Hoc profiles, and that was a fairly straightforward task up until this weekend. I am still able to edit the device list for my Development Profiles. Can anyone tell me how to add devices to my Ad Hoc Provisioning Profile on the new Apple Developer website? Notes: This is definitely an Ad Hoc profile, not a App Store Distribution profile. It is impossible to uncheck the radio button below: "iOS Distribution...". Edit iOS Provisioning Profile Screenshot:

@TITLE:Downloading Media File pro-grammatically in Windows Phone 8
@CONTENT:Our app is video/audio based app, and we have uploaded all the media on Windows Azure. However it is required to facilitate user to download audio/video file on demand, so that they can play it locally. So i need to download audio/video file pro-grammatically and save it in IsolatedStorage. We have Windows Azure Media File Access URLs for each audio/video. But I am stuck in 1st step of downloading media file. I googled and came across this article, but for WebClient there is no function DownloadFileAsync that I can use. However I tried its other function DownloadStringAsyn, and download media file is in string format but don't know how to convert it to audio(wma)/video(mp4) format. Please suggest me, how can I proceed? Is there other way to download media file? Here is sample code that I used private void ApplicationBarMenuItem_Click_1(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        WebClient mediaWC = new WebClient();
        mediaWC.DownloadProgressChanged += new DownloadProgressChangedEventHandler(mediaWC_DownloadProgressChanged);

        mediaWC.DownloadStringCompleted += new DownloadStringCompletedEventHandler(mediaWC_DownloadCompleted);

test_list = list.Distinct().ToList();

 I guess the problem is pointed with the "status: RTSP/1.0 461 Unsupported transport", but I don't see what can I change : I already open the ports I use, and I do receive the video on another computer. On the Android phone, I can play some rtsp streams I found on the web, for exemple this one : rtsp://184.72.239.149/vod/mp4:BigBuckBunny_115k.mov . So it should be possible. If anyone can help... !

I have much better scope with external variable.If i want the scope of external variable to be specific file i do not declare this variable else where.i see a lot of flexibility with a global variable that static local variable And we can refer to local static variable outside the function if we have the address of the variable.Memory for local static variable will be in Data segment not in the stack frame of the function.So unique feature does static storage class bring to the table.

 For Java encryption I use bouncycastle and its RijndaelEngine with same parameters - CBC, 256 block size, zero padding. Here is my java code snippet: byte[] sessionKey = "bbee9a3e8e44e28edb4539186d182aaa".getBytes(); 
byte[] iv = "131a68dc13160766f37dc931d7e518aa".getBytes();

PaddedBufferedBlockCipher cipher = new PaddedBufferedBlockCipher(
    new CBCBlockCipher(new RijndaelEngine(256)), new ZeroBytePadding());

int keySize = 256 / 8;

CipherParameters ivAndKey = new ParametersWithIV(new KeyParameter(sessionKey, 0, keySize), iv, 0, keySize);

cipher.init(true, ivAndKey);
byte[] encrypted  = new byte[cipher.getOutputSize(plaintext.length)];
int oLen = cipher.processBytes(plaintext, 0, plaintext.length, encrypted, 0);
cipher.doFinal(encrypted, oLen);
 Bytes arrays for secret key, initial vector and text to encrypt are absolutely the same: secret key: [98, 98, 101, 101, 57, 97, 51, 101, 56, 101, 52, 52, 101, 50, 56, 101, 100, 98, 52, 53, 51, 57, 49, 56, 54, 100, 49, 56, 50, 97, 97, 97]
initial vector: [49, 51, 49, 97, 54, 56, 100, 99, 49, 51, 49, 54, 48, 55, 54, 54, 102, 51, 55, 100, 99, 57, 51, 49, 100, 55, 101, 53, 49, 56, 97, 97]

 But the result array for powershell and Java differs: powershell: [241, 100, 194, 184, 166, 85, 15, 212, 186, 220, 85, 136, 16, 194, 93, 11, 243, 245, 230, 207, 224, 88, 255, 153, 185, 9, 43, 78, 219, 138, 7, 222]

I have spent the last week looking into various solutions, mainly IOKit and applescript, but both of these seem to be unable to locate the iOS device when it is plugged in with a USB cable. While I know that I could jailbreak the device and then it should be simple, this is not an option. I have had a difficult time finding information on this subject, which makes me worry that it is hopeless. However, I know there must be a way to do this without jailbreaking because there exists this beautiful app. I have been able to access the files I need to through this app so I know for sure it is possible. This, however, is not an ideal solution as I really don't have the option to use third party software for my application. I suspect that the app uses applescript to do it as it has an executable called appleScriptServer in the install directory that looks like it may be what handles this. What I need is to understand how they access the files and implement a similar scheme for my (much simpler) needs. Does anyone know of some way to do this? If it is possible in IOKit or through applescript, I would like some resources that help me understand how to properly locate and access an iPad when plugged into the USB port on a mac. The closest I have come was using user$ system_profiler SPUSBDataType from this thread that lets me know:           iPad:

 but I don't know that I can use any of the information it gives me other than to verify that it is plugged in via USB. Thank you very much for any help you can give me.

@TITLE:Testing spring openshift application locally
@CONTENT:I have an application running on Openshift. It works fine, but testing is difficult because i have to push every little thing to openshift and wait for all the building and restarting to see the changes. So i am trying to find a way to test the application locally. Another guy asked the same thing here: How to test an openshift application on local host, but i am wondering if an easier solution exists. I used the quickstart project here http://github.com/openshift/spring-eap6-quickstart.git to start it. So basically it is a Spring application using Hibernate. What i have in mind to have two sets of configuration files (persistence.xml etc.) in the project, one for local Tomcat server and one for Jboss eap and change web.xml according to the server i want to deploy to. Is this doable? Looks so simple, i am afraid of any surprise problems before changing the project.

I can't find any documentation on this, and have (speculatively) tried: //option[@selected=true] //option[@selected="selected"] //option[@selected] but none of these work; they simply don't match any elements.

@TITLE:Custom switch widget in Android 4
@CONTENT:I am getting crazy with switch buttons in Android 4. First of all, I have set a selector as background with two different PNG files selected from drawable folder: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<selector xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
    <item android:drawable="@drawable/form_switch_no" android:state_checked="false"/>

    <item android:drawable="@drawable/form_switch_no"/>
</selector>
 but I don't know why they are x-scaled. I want to manage this size, but I have tried to change layout_width/height/weight... without succes. I have also a custom PNG file to be used as the thumb of the switch. I also need to manage the size of this thumb, because if I set textOn and textOff propieties as "", thumb gets a very small size. Moreover, I would like to change thumb padding in respect of the background, because It does not appears centered. Here is my Switch XML definition: <Switch
    android:id="@+id/switchUsers"

@TITLE:jQuery AJAX upload progress for large text fields
@CONTENT:Is it possible to get the upload-progress for a form with very large textfields using jQuery ajax? I think the client knows how much bytes have been sent, but when I Google I only find solutions for file-uploads using server-site code. This is my ajax-request: $.ajax({
        type: "POST",
        url: "index.php?action=saveNewPost",
        data: {textbox1: textbox1,textbox2: textbox2},
        contentType: "application/x-www-form-urlencoded;charset=UTF-8",
        success: function(){
            //
        }
    });
 I was hoping there would be something like "onProgress" with a parameter containing the amount of bytes already sent... Found a solution $.ajax({
        xhr: function() {
            var req = $.ajaxSettings.xhr();
            if (req) {
                req.upload.addEventListener('progress', function(event) {
                    if (event.lengthComputable) {
                        $('#ajaxFeedbackDiv').html(event.loaded); // = 'test'; //event.loaded + ' / ' + event.total;
                    }
                }, false);
            }
            return req;
        },
        type: "POST",
        url: "index.php?action=saveNewPost",
        data: {textbox1: textbox1,textbox2: textbox2},
        contentType: "application/x-www-form-urlencoded;charset=UTF-8"
        }
    });
 this seems to work, altough there are still 2 problems: the connection on my localhost is way too fast, so it's hard to see the "progress" actually working. I installed this tool http://mschrag.github.com on a second Mac in the same network and I see that it's working perfectly. I'm not sure if this will fall-back friendly on non-XHR/HTML5-compatible browsers, i.e. just upload without progress information?

@CONTENT:The Problem/s: Views are being compiled but hitting refresh in a browser won't show the changes without restarting the server manually. Changes to controllers compile automatically using ~run but only a manual server restart will update the content on the server. Changes to routes under conf are only shown after manually restarting the server. Background: running on OSX 10.8.3 using Eclipse Juno 4.2.2 Server is launched using play ~run Only restarting the server will show changes to views, controllers, routes To be able to make changes without having to restart the server each time I tried (without success): in the console: clean -> eclipse -> ~run in the console: clean -> compile -> ~run shutdown/restart the computer Tick Refresh using native hooks or polling -> remove classes_managed from Referenced Libraries and add it manually Questions: How can the Auto-Reload functionality be restored? How can this problem be solved on IDEs besides Eclipse? Further information: Playframework reload not working Mac OSX Auto-reloading with Play framework on a network filesystem Both of them point to JNotify as the cause for auto-reloading not to work. One of the answers (not enough rep to write a comment) mentions how one could "hack Play framework's sbt plugin to make the PlayReloader trait behave as if JNotify wasn't available." How could one achieve this?

@TITLE:Is jquery-mobile mobile first
@CONTENT:I have read the book "Mobile first" by Luke WROBLEWSKI and many other readings on that topic. I'm a web developer and now I'm really convinced that "mobile first" or "progressive enhancement" is the way to go. Now I'm looking for a framework to achieve this. JQuery mobile annonce they are "mobile first" but I have given a try during some days and now I would tend to say "No it's not". You can't mix it with other frameworks; it does tricks like keeping all pages in the DOM (forcing the load using ajax) so it doesn't make my life easier. Trying to use it to make progressive enhancement and finish by a desktop version without unload it, seems impossible. I mean you don't want to have big buttons with a desktop computer so I guess I will need to just drop the js&css of the framework and that sounds weird. I don't even know if it's possible. JQuery mobile looks like a framework to achieve a dedicated mobile web version of your site with a look&feel as an native apps more than a mobile first website. So please could someone tell me where I'm wrong: * is jQuery mobile really "mobile first"? * could I do progressive enhancement (with desktop as last target) with jquery mobile ? in case of yes, please tell me how. Here is the corresponding page telling that jquerymobile is mobile first: http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.3.0/docs/intro/#ProgressiveEnhancement I have also try zurb's foundation and it works well but do not provide enough widget or tools to provide nice mobiel UI. Mix both would be the great point but it will need a lot of works (CSS conflict + may be JS conflict) and I don't even know if it's possible. Any advices on how do you use jquery mobile in a mobile first context will be welcomed !

@TITLE:Dynamically render view in a partial with Rails and jQuery
@CONTENT:In my app, I have a user profile page that has three tabs and a blank div below it. There is a default tab that is white and two other tabs that are darker and "unselected". I want to make it so that the content in the div below renders a partial based on which tab is selected. I already have it working to the point where jQuery allows me to click on the different tabs and it changes the colors of the tabs without a page refresh. However, I am stuck on how to get the partial to render correctly. Any thoughts on this? I am stuck on how to dynamically call a partial based on which tab is selected in the jQuery and actually am not sure if I need another file to interact with this to make it work. I am relatively new to jQuery in a rails app so I am not sure if I've done everything I need to. User profile page: app > views > show.html.erb    <ul class="profile-tabs">    

        <%= link_to "<li class=\"tab selected\">Tab 1</li>".html_safe, userprofile_users_path, remote: true %>
        <%= link_to "<li class=\"tab\">Tab 2</li>".html_safe, userprofile_users_path, remote: true %>
        <%= link_to "<li class=\"tab\">Tab 3</li>".html_safe, userprofile_users_path, remote: true %>

    </ul>

        $("li.tab").click(function(e) {
          e.preventDefault();
          $("li.tab").removeClass("selected");
          $(this).addClass("selected");
          $("#profile-content").html("<%= escape_javascript(render partial: 
"How can I make this partial name be generated based on the value of the selected li?")%>");
        });
    });

def show
    @user = User.find(params[:id])
end

def userprofile
    respond_to do |format|
        format.js
    end
end
end
 There are three partials corresponding to the three tabs, and I need the jQuery to somehow dynamically change the partial being called based on the selected tab. I'd really appreciate some help with this, or if there is another resource that can answer my question. I have not been able to find anything that directly answers what I am trying to do. Update ------ I used the solution provided rails_has_elegance but nothing is appearing in the div I am targeting.

@TITLE:Quartz.NET - Shouldn't this unit test pass?
@CONTENT:This question is related to this one, but is kept more general and can be treated independently. EDIT: Quartz version is v2.0.1 From my understanding, the following unit test should pass: [Test]
public void Test() {
    // run every first day of month at 14:00 hours
    CronExpression expression = new CronExpression("0 0 14 1 * ?");

    //  TimeZoneInfo.Local = {(UTC+01:00) Amsterdam, Berlin, Bern, Rom, Stockholm, Wien}
    if (!TimeZoneInfo.Local.SupportsDaylightSavingTime) {
        return;
    }

    // get "summertime" period for current timezone
    var daylightChange = TimeZone.CurrentTimeZone.GetDaylightChanges(2013);
    //  -> daylightChange.Start     {31.03.2013 02:00:00}   System.DateTime
    //  -> daylightChange.End       {27.10.2013 03:00:00}   System.DateTime

    // get one startpoint before and one after begin of summertime
    DateTimeOffset beforeSummertime = daylightChange.Start.ToUniversalTime().AddDays(-1);
    DateTimeOffset afterSummertime = daylightChange.Start.ToUniversalTime().AddDays(1);
    // -> beforeSummertime  {30.03.2013 01:00:00 +00:00}    System.DateTimeOffset
    // -> afterSummertime   {01.04.2013 01:00:00 +00:00}    System.DateTimeOffset

    DateTimeOffset? nextValidTimeFromBefore = expression.GetNextValidTimeAfter(beforeSummertime);
    DateTimeOffset? nextValidTimeFromAfter = expression.GetNextValidTimeAfter(afterSummertime);
    // nextValidTimeFromBefore  {01.04.2013 13:00:00 +00:00}    System.DateTimeOffset?
    // nextValidTimeFromAfter   {01.04.2013 12:00:00 +00:00}    System.DateTimeOffset?

    Assert.AreEqual(nextValidTimeFromBefore, nextValidTimeFromAfter);
}  
 However (as you can see), the nextValidTimeFromBefore differs from nextValidTimeFromAfter. The result in nextValidTimeFromAfter is correct. The UTC 12:00 will result in 14:00 during summertime (which already started at that point). It shouldn't matter if the GetNextValidTimeAfter() parameter specifies a time inside or outside of the summertime period. Should the NextValidTimes be equal or is my approach flawed?
@CODE:[Test]
public void Test() {
    // run every first day of month at 14:00 hours
    CronExpression expression = new CronExpression("0 0 14 1 * ?");

    //  TimeZoneInfo.Local = {(UTC+01:00) Amsterdam, Berlin, Bern, Rom, Stockholm, Wien}

@TITLE:ajax post error: NETWORK_ERR: XMLHttpRequest Exception 101
@CONTENT:I have the following ajax post: $.ajax( {
    type: "POST",
    url: "http://192.168.7.9/api",
    dataType: 'json',
    data: { username: "john.doe", password: "123456", method: "search_samples" },

    },
    error: function ( XMLHttpRequest, textStatus, errorThrown ) {
        // Always here: if async true, errorThrown has no message
        // otherwise I se the NETWORK_ERR message
    }
} );
 It is returning with this error: NETWORK_ERR: XMLHttpRequest Exception 101. I have read a bunch of SO posts on this error, most suggest that I set async to true. This DOES remove the error message- but it is still an error, and I never get valid data. It just seems to remove the error message which is not helpful. In fiddler, on the same dev machine this works perfectly- is this a chrome issue? An origin issue? Is something wrong with my syntax?

@LINK:/questions/15648378/crop-image-without-copying
@TITLE:crop image without copying
@CONTENT:I'm writing an application that requires me to split a large image into small tiles, where each tile is essentially a cropped version of the original image. Currently my split operation looks something like this tile.Image = new BitmapImage();
tile.Image.BeginInit();
tile.Image.UriSource = OriginalImage.UriSource;
tile.Image.SourceRect = new Int32Rect(x * tileWidth + x, y * tileHeight, tileWidth, tileHeight);
tile.Image.EndInit();
 Intuitively, I thought that this would create basically a "reference" to the original image, and would just display as a sub rectangle of the image. However, the slow speed at which my split operation performs has lead me to believe that this is actually copying the source rect of the original image, which is very slow for large images (There is a noticeable 3-4 second pause when splitting a decent size image). I looked around a bit but haven't been able to find a way to draw a bitmap as a sub rect of a large image, without copying any data. Any suggestions?
@CODE:tile.Image = new BitmapImage();
tile.Image.BeginInit();
tile.Image.UriSource = OriginalImage.UriSource;
tile.Image.SourceRect = new Int32Rect(x * tileWidth + x, y * tileHeight, tileWidth, tileHeight);

But having very little experince of using a CMS it'd be really helpful to get other views on this from more experienced devs on what pit falls to avoid. N2 CMS - A mature option, I've got this working but the documentation is really lacking. I've also found it difficult to find the minimum spec requirements for a database and also browser compatibility. I do however like the code structure for creating the template pages. Phun CMS - this is a new open source project that I really like the look of in the way the programmer is approaching the problem and separating the concerns. It's probably far too new though to really look at at the moment. Composite C1 - A mature CMS option, great documentation. However says that it only supports IE9+. Umbraco - not tried yet but looks heavyweight Piranha - not tried yet but nice website and documentation and also says that it's lightweight.

@TITLE:How can I retrieve all Tweets and attributes for a given user using Python?
@CONTENT:I am attempting to retrieve data from Twitter, using Tweepy for a username typed at the command line. I'm wanting to extract quite a bit of data about the status and user,so have come up with the following: Note that I am importing all the required modules ok and have oauth + keys (just not included it here) and filename is correct, just been changed: # define user to get tweets for. accepts input from user
user = tweepy.api.get_user(input("Please enter the twitter username: "))

# Display basic details for twitter user name
print (" ")
print ("Basic information for", user.name)
print ("Screen Name:", user.screen_name)
print ("Name: ", user.name)
print ("Twitter Unique ID: ", user.id)
print ("Account created at: ", user.created_at)

timeline = api.user_timeline(screen_name=user, include_rts=True, count=100)
    for tweet in timeline:
        print ("ID:", tweet.id)
        print ("User ID:", tweet.user.id)
        print ("Text:", tweet.text)
        print ("Created:", tweet.created_at)
        print ("Geo:", tweet.geo)
        print ("Contributors:", tweet.contributors)
        print ("Coordinates:", tweet.coordinates) 
        print ("Favorited:", tweet.favorited)
        print ("In reply to screen name:", tweet.in_reply_to_screen_name)
        print ("In reply to status ID:", tweet.in_reply_to_status_id)
        print ("In reply to status ID str:", tweet.in_reply_to_status_id_str)
        print ("In reply to user ID:", tweet.in_reply_to_user_id)
        print ("In reply to user ID str:", tweet.in_reply_to_user_id_str)
        print ("Place:", tweet.place)
        print ("Retweeted:", tweet.retweeted)
        print ("Retweet count:", tweet.retweet_count)
        print ("Source:", tweet.source)
        print ("Truncated:", tweet.truncated)
 I would like this eventually to iterate through all of a user's tweets (up to the 3200 limit). First things first though. So far though I have two problems, I get the following error message regarding retweets: Please enter the twitter username: barackobamaTraceback (most recent call last):

    timeline = api.user_timeline(screen_name=user, count=100, page=1)

    raise TweepError(error_msg)
tweepy.error.TweepError: Twitter error response: status code = 401
 I've isolated both these errors, i.e. they aren't working together. Forgive my ignorance, I am not too hot with Twitter APIs but am learning pretty rapidly. Tweepy documentation really does suck and I've done loads of reading round on the net, just can't seem to get this fixed. If I can get this sorted, i'll be posting up some documentation. I know how to transfer the data into an MySQL db once extracted (it will do that, rather than print to screen) and manipulate it so that I can do stuff with it, it is just getting it out that I am having the problems with. Does anyone have any ideas or is there another method I should be considering? Any help really appreciated. Cheers EDIT: Following on from @Eric Olson's suggestion this morning; I did the following. 1) Created a completely brand new set of Oauth credentials to test. 2) Copied code across to a new script as follows: Oauth consumer_key = "(removed)"
consumer_secret = "(removed)"
access_key="88394805-(removed)"
access_secret="(removed)"
auth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(consumer_key, consumer_secret)
auth.set_access_token(access_key, access_secret)
api=tweepy.API(auth)



# confirm account being used for OAuth
print ("API NAME IS: ", api.me().name)
api.update_status("Using Tweepy from the command line")
 The first time i run the script, it works fine and updates my status and returns the API name as follows: >>> 
API NAME IS:  Chris Howden
 Then from that point on I get this: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:/Users/Chris/Dropbox/Uni_2012-3/6CC995 - Independent Studies/Scripts/get Api name and update status.py", line 19, in <module>

    raise TweepError(error_msg)

 The only reason I can see for it doing something like this is that it is rejecting the generated access token. I shouldn't need to renew the access token should I?

@TITLE:Detailed explanation of 'git remote show'
@CONTENT:I honestly cannot find any detailed documentation of the output of git remote show (certainly not on the man page) In particular, a clear, exact explanation of the Local sections would be appreciated. An example of what I find confusing: Here I have two remotes, klas and origin and the output they produce: > git remote show klas
* remote klas
  Fetch URL: ..\klasrepo
  Push  URL: ..\klasrepo
  HEAD branch: master
  Remote branches:
    experiment  tracked
    feature     tracked
    master      tracked
    pu          tracked
    stashbranch tracked
  Local branch configured for 'git pull':
    pu merges with remote pu
  Local refs configured for 'git push':
    experiment pushes to experiment (fast-forwardable)
    feature    pushes to feature    (fast-forwardable)
    master     pushes to master     (fast-forwardable)
    pu         pushes to pu         (up to date)
> git remote show origin
* remote origin
  Fetch URL: C:/Temp/git/.\barerepo.git
  Push  URL: C:/Temp/git/.\barerepo.git
  HEAD branch: experiment
  Remote branches:
    experiment tracked
    master     tracked
  Local branches configured for 'git pull':
    experiment  merges with remote experiment
    master     rebases onto remote master
  Local refs configured for 'git push':
    experiment pushes to experiment (up to date)
    master     pushes to master     (fast-forwardable)
 Notice that experiment and master are listed under both local refs configured for 'git push'. What does that mean? I have configured master and experiment to track origin/master and origin/experiment respectively (and pu to track klas/pu). My local feature branch is not set up to track anything, but is still listed under local refs configured for 'git push' (the only connection seems to be the identical name, another non-tracking branch, foo, is not mentioned). git push while on feature gives fatal: The current branch feature has no upstream branch. - hardly "fast-forwardable". It seems that the criteria for a local branch being listed under local refs configured for 'git push' is that there happens to exist a remote branch with the same name?? For reference: > git branch -vva

@TITLE:Good design patterns for coding many HTTP requests in Android
@CONTENT:In my app, i have lots of GET,POST, PUT requests. Right now, i have a singleton class that holds my downloaded data and has many inner classes that extend AsyncTask. In my singleton class, i have also a few interfaces like this: /**
* Handlers for notifying listeners when data is downloaded
* 
*/
public interface OnQuestionsLoadedListener {

    public void onDataLoadComplete();

    public void onDataLoadingError();       
}
 Is there something wrong with this pattern (many inner classes that extend AsyncTask)? Could it be done more efficiently with maybe just 1 inner class for every HTTP call (1 for GET, 1 for POST, ...)? If so, how to decide what to do after e.g. GET request?

@TITLE:How to group multiple objects for purpose of rotating them as a unit?
@CONTENT:I need some pointers on the best approach for a rotation task in OpenGL. I know how to rotate objects in 3D space using quaternions, I can translate them, all well and good. But I want to know the best way to treat a collection of different objects as a single entity for the purpose of rotation. For example, suppose you have a desk with objects on it. Each has its own translation and rotation, but now I want to rotate the entire desk and everything on it, while keeping other objects in the room in place. This means objects on the outer edge of the desk will rotate and also translate around the center of the desk, while objects at the center might just rotate but otherwise stay in place, or simply not translate by as much, depending on their distance from the axis of rotation. It seems that a rather inelegant way to do this is to individually rotate and translate each object on the desk, as well as the desk itself, knowing where the axis of rotation is. Perhaps this is the only good way to do it, but is there a technique to "group" disparate objects for this purpose?

(I have Administrator account level on the CMS account and the channels I get 403 error on have "Managed" relationship) Question: Are there any plans to have youtube.analytics api support for querying channels managed under a CMS account?

@TITLE:How to find the last or next entry using R package data.table and rolling joins
@CONTENT:Lets say I have a data table like this.

   customer_id time_stamp value
1:           1        223     4
2:           1        252     1
3:           1        456     3

5:           2        632     2
 So that customer_id and time_stamp together form a unique key. I want to add some new columns indicating the previous and last values of "value". That is, I want output like this.   customer_id time_stamp value value_PREV value_NEXT
1:           1        223     4         NA          1
2:           1        252     1          4          3
3:           1        456     3          1         NA
4:           2        455     5         NA          2
5:           2        632     2          5         NA
 I want this to be fast and work with sparse, irregular times. I thought that the data.table rolling join would do it for me. However the rolling join appears to find the last time OR same time. So if you do a rolling join on two copies of the same table (after adding _PREV to the column names of the copy), this doesn't quite work. You can fudge it by adding a tiny number to the time variable of the copy but this is kinda awkward. Is there a way to do this simply with rollin join or some other data.table method? I've found an efficient way but it still requires about 40 lines of R code. It seems that this could be a one-liner if rolling join could be told to look for the last time NOT including the same time. Or maybe there is some other neat trick. Here is the example data. data=data.table(customer_id=c(1,2,1,1,2),time_stamp=c(252,632,456,223,455),value=c(1,2,3,4,5))
data_sorted=data[order(customer_id,time_stamp)]
 This is the code I wrote. Note that the lines putting NA into the ones where customer_id differ throws a warning and probably needs changing. I have them commented out below. Anyone have any suggestions for replacing those two lines? add_prev_next_cbind<-function(data,ident="customer_id",timecol="time_stamp",prev_tag="PREV",
                   next_tag="NEXT",sep="_"){
  o=order(data[[ident]],data[[timecol]])

  data_prev=data[c(1,1:(Nrow-1)),]
  #shift it, put any junk in the last row
  data_next=data[c(2:(Nrow),Nrow),]
  #flag the rows where the identity changes, these get NA
  prev_diff=data[[ident]] != data_prev[[ident]]
  prev_diff[1]=T
  next_diff=data[[ident]] != data_next[[ident]]  
  next_diff[Nrow]=T
  #change names

@LINK:/questions/15532946/ciareahistogram-inputscale-factor
@TITLE:CIAreaHistogram inputScale factor
@CONTENT:I'm building an application that uses the CIAreaHistogram Core Image filter. I use an inputCount value (number of buckets) of 10 for testing, and an inputScale value of 1. I get the CIImage for the histogram itself, which I then run through a custom kernel (see end of post) to set alpha values to 1 (since otherwise the alpha value from the histogram calculations is premultiplied) and then convert it to an NSBitmapImageRep. I then scan through the image rep's buffer and print the RGB values (skipping the alpha values). However, when I do this, the sum of the R, G, and B values across the 10 do not necessarily add up to 255. For example, with a fully black image, I apply the histogram, then the custom kernel, and get the following output: RGB: 255 255 255
RGB: 0 0 0
RGB: 0 0 0
RGB: 0 0 0
RGB: 0 0 0
RGB: 0 0 0
RGB: 0 0 0
RGB: 0 0 0
RGB: 0 0 0
RGB: 0 0 0
 This is as I expect, since all pixels are black, so everything is in the first bucket. However, if I run the same algorithm with a color image, I get the following: RGB: 98 76 81
RGB: 164 97 87
RGB: 136 161 69
RGB: 100 156 135
RGB: 80 85 185
RGB: 43 34 45
RGB: 31 19 8
RGB: 19 7 3
RGB: 12 5 2
RGB: 16 11 11
 Add up the values for R, G, and B - they don't add up to 255. This causes problems because I need to compare two of these histograms, and my algorithm expects the sums to be between 0 and 255. I could obviously scale these values, but I want to avoid that extra step for performance reasons. I noticed something else interesting that might give some clue as to why this is happening. In my custom kernel, I simply set the alpha value to 1. I tried a second kernel (see end of post) that sets all pixels to red. Clearly, green and blue values are zero. However, I get this result when checking the values from the bitmap rep: RGB: 255 43 25
 But I just set G and B to zero! This seems to be part of the problem, which indicates color management. But since I explicitly set the values in the kernel, there's only one block of code where this can be happening - the conversion to an NSBitmapImageRep from the CIImage from the filter: NSBitmapImageRep *bitmapRep = [[NSBitmapImageRep alloc] initWithCIImage:kernelOutput];
unsigned char *buf = [bitmapRep bitmapData];
 Once I set the pixels to RGB 255 0 0, then execute those lines, then read the buffer, the RGB values are all 255 43 25. I have further tried setting the color space of the original CGImageRef on which the entire workflow is based to kCGColorSpaceGenericRGB, thinking the color profile may be carrying through, but to no avail. Can anyone tell me why a CIFilter kernel would behave this way, and how I could solve it? As mentioned before, here are copies of the CIFilter kernel functions I use. First, the one that sets alpha to 1: kernel vec4 adjustHistogram(sampler src)
{
    vec4 pix = sample(src, destCoord());
    pix.a = 1.0;
    return pix;
}
 And next, the one that sets all pixels to RGB 255 0 0 but that ends up 255 43 25 once it converts to NSBitmapImageRep: kernel vec4 adjustHistogram(sampler src)
{
    vec4 pix = sample(src, destCoord());
    pix.r = 1.0; pix.g = 0.0; pix.b = 0.0;
    pix.a = 1.0;
    return pix;
}
 Thanks in advance for your help.

@CONTENT:Note, I am aware of the following questions on this topic: Are there any performance issues or caveats with resource (.resx) files? Are string resources (.resx) properties kept in memory? et al. However, I don't find any of the answers in these questions satisfactory (they are not concrete enough). I am also aware of the MSDN pages on this topic, but these also seem to skimp on the technical information regarding the overheads of using resource files. My predicament is that we are about to embark on the localisation of a reasonably large sized WinForms application. My concern at this stage is about the performance of accessing resources from a .resx file from within a nested loop for example. Currently for the small part of the code we have localised (Column Names, Row Headers etc. for DataGridView etc.) we are cashing the resources in global variables of the relevant class and using those. How are resources from the .resx accessed (are they included in the assembly at compile-time?) and is there a performance benefit from cashing those resources and using global variables for access? Thanks for your time.

      imageMatrix.postTranslate((imageWidth/2), (imageHeight/2));
      mCamera.restore();
 }
}
 But this code, after 4.0 device like 4.1 or 4.2 isnt working well anymore. I've done some debugging, so I modified this part: //As the angle of the view gets less, zoom in     
  if ( rotation < mMaxRotationAngle ) {
      Log.d("sergi",""+rotation);
   float zoomAmount = (float) (mMaxZoom +  (rotation * 2.9));
   mCamera.translate(0.0f, 0.0f, zoomAmount);          
  } 
 And this returned this on a 4.0.4 device while swipping one image from right to left: 03-20 11:11:43.145: D/debugging(15987): 1

 As you can see, basically what is happening, is that the same method, isn't being used the same way between two different apis.

@TITLE:How to reduce number of connections using SQLAlchemy + postgreSQL?
@CONTENT:I'm developing on heroku using their Postgres add-on with the Dev plan, which has a connection limit of 20. I'm new to python and this may be trivial, but I find it difficult to abstract the database connection without causing OperationalError: (OperationalError) FATAL: too many connections for role. Currently I have databeam.py: import os
from flask import Flask
from flask.ext.sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from settings import databaseSettings

class Db(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.app = Flask(__name__)
        self.app.config.from_object(__name__)
        self.app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL', databaseSettings())
        self.db = SQLAlchemy(self.app)

db = Db()
 And when I'm creating a controller for a page, I do this: import databeam

db = databeam.db
locations = databeam.locations

templateVars = db.db.session.query(locations).filter(locations.parent == 0).order_by(locations.order.asc()).all()
 This does produce what I want, but slowly and at times causes the error metioned above. Since I come from a php background I have a certain mindset of how to deal with DB connections (I.e. like the example above), but I fear it doesn't fit well with python. What is the proper way of abstracting the db connection in one place and then just using the same connection in all imports?

@TITLE:Service run in background?
@CONTENT:One of the functions of the app which I'm building had a record function. I do this by starting a MediaRecorder object in a service: Intent intent = new Intent(v.getContext(), RecordService.class);
Messenger messenger = new Messenger(handler);
intent.putExtra("COUNT", basic);
intent.putExtra("MESSENGER", messenger);

v.getContext().startService(intent);

//service

//...
mRecorder = new MediaRecorder();
//...
 Now I introduced a notification which had to let the user know what the status is of the recording itself because if you go the the home or hit the backbutton, it has to keep recording. Therefore, if you hit the notification, you go back to the app. That is where I am struggling, if I click the notification, I go back to the app but everything is set to the initial state (Timer is back 00:00:00 and I can hit the record button again instead of the pause button) What I should accomplish is of course that it keeps recording and that I can see the ongoing timer + stop button. note: the Timer is not a service right now.. Any ideas how I should handle this? EDIT Suppose I shut the app down, the service is still running. Reopening the app (and thus activity where the service was initially called from) can we do with: private boolean isMyServiceRunning() {
        ActivityManager manager = (ActivityManager) myContext.getSystemService(Context.ACTIVITY_SERVICE);
        for (RunningServiceInfo service : manager.getRunningServices(Integer.MAX_VALUE)) {
            if (MyService.class.getName().equals(service.service.getClassName())) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
 So I partly have that covered, but, the variables passed from that Service to that activity are now gone. It seems that my Handler in my Activity is not picking them up after reopening that Activity? private Handler handler = new Handler() {
        public void handleMessage(Message message) {

            //..
            Bundle bundle = message.getData();
            fileName = bundle.getString("FILENAME");
            tvFileName.setText(fileName);


            Log.e("Filename", "transfered: " + fileName);

        };
    };

@TITLE:Validating double and float values using Hibernate Validator - bean validation
@CONTENT:I'm looking for a way to validate a java.lang.Double field in the Spring command bean for its maximum and minimum values (a value must lie between a given range of values) like, public final class WeightBean
{
     @Max(groups={ValidationGroup.class}, value=Double.MAX_VALUE, message="some key or default message")
     @Min(groups={ValidationGroup.class}, value=1D, message="some key or default message")
     private Double txtWeight;  //Getter and setter.

     public interface ValidationGroup{}         
}
 But both @Max and @Min cannot take a java.lang.Double value. Note that double and float are not supported due to rounding errors (some providers might provide some approximative support) So what is the way of validating such fields? I'm working with Spring 3.2.0 and Hibernate Validator 4.3.1 CR1.
@CODE:java.lang.Double public final class WeightBean
{
     @Max(groups={ValidationGroup.class}, value=Double.MAX_VALUE, message="some key or default message")
     @Min(groups={ValidationGroup.class}, value=1D, message="some key or default message")
     private Double txtWeight;  //Getter and setter.

     public interface ValidationGroup{}

@TITLE:How to use a C++ project from within a .NET application?
@CONTENT:I'm a regular .NET developer aiming to integrate a C++ library into a .NET project. I have a few ideas, but since I'm new to C++ in general I don't know the limits of the technology I'm trying to work with. The C++ project is essentially a fast sound renderer that can playback multi-track audio files with a bunch of different postprocessing tricks. All of this is cool, but considering I have a simple .NET WinForms app I want to integrate with, things start to look messy. Firstly, the C++ project has no .NET bindings or ActiveX/COM integration. Its a plain 'ol MS VC++ 9 project. If I am to work with the project in my .NET app I'll have to somehow interface with it, ie. create class instances, set properties, call methods, marshal data in and out, etc. Secondly, its built to run as an independent Windows app and manages its own windows using the MS Windows API. This is fine, but somehow I need the .NET VM running in the background, managing the show and running all my C# code. I don't write C++ so I need to stick with C# to build an app around this lib. Thirdly, whether I'm running in the same process as the C++ lib or not, I need a way to build/interface/debug these 2 separate apps as if they were one. I have no background in C++ programming except for the fact that I have written a couple C++ DLLs for high-performance data manipulation. So, many questions and no idea how to start! I can fully compile this lib and get it into a VC EXE, but how do I co-compile my .NET code into it? Or alternatively, how do I compile the C++ code into the .NET EXE so it runs within a managed environment? Note that it wasn't designed for this and may misbehave if I attempt to change too much. The main problem is interfacing with it. How do I expose some C++ classes to be accessed from .NET? I know exactly which classes I need and I'll need only a couple dozen classes along with their relevant methods/properties to be available from .NET. I don't mind handwriting wrapper classes in .NET to help the .NET VM understand the class structure of the bytes transferred back and forth. I'm hoping I can directly work with C++ objects from a managed environment so most of my code can remain in .NET. Even if I run it as an independant app, would I have to resort to sockets or something to communicate with it? This is the absolute worse case and I'll do anything to avoid this. Any help or pointers are appreciated, I hope I made myself and my task at hand clear and that my questions are specific enough and answerable. Thanks for any help! Edit: If I write wrapper classes or generate them, can I use P/Invoke to create class instances and call methods on them and have them run native C++ code in the background? Where will the memory for such C++ objects be stored and managed? Within the .NET heap or outside it?

@CONTENT:I am trying to post a notification in a view from my app to another one using NSNotificationCenter. So in my destination class I create my observer as follows: NSNotificationCenter.DefaultCenter.AddObserver ("ChangeLeftSide", delegate {ChangeLeftSide(null);});

@LINK:/questions/15472935/how-to-pool-objects-in-spring
@TITLE:How to pool objects in Spring?
@CONTENT:I'm following this tutorial regarding how to pool objects in Spring. I've followed the instruction written on the tutorial but when I run my application, it always generates a new instance of the object. I'm expecting that since I'm pooling the objects, existing objects will be reuse. As such, no new instances should be created. Also, when I access of the getter method of the bean, a new instance of the bean is created again. What could have I done wrong? Did I misunderstood the concept of pooling in Spring? Below is my code: Application Context: (This is just the body of my application context.) <bean id="simpleBeanTarget" class="com.bean.SimpleBean" scope="prototype">

</bean>

<bean id="poolTargetSource" class="org.springframework.aop.target.CommonsPoolTargetSource">
    <property name="targetBeanName" value="simpleBeanTarget" />
    <property name="maxSize" value="2" />
</bean>

<bean id="simpleBean" class="org.springframework.aop.framework.ProxyFactoryBean">
    <property name="targetSource" ref="poolTargetSource" />
</bean>
 The controller: (This is just the body of my method) @RequestMapping("/hello")
public ModelAndView helloWorld(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
{
    String message = "Hello World, Spring 3.";
    try
    {
        System.out.println("Accessing Application Context");
        ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("applicationContext.xml");

        System.out.println("Getting Bean");
        SimpleBean simpleBean = (SimpleBean) context.getBean("simpleBean");
        //A new SimpleBean... is printed here.

        System.out.println("Displaying Hello World: " + simpleBean.getRandomNum());
        //After this line, A new SimpleBean... is printed again. I simply access the getter method. Why does it create a new instance of SimpleBean?

        return new ModelAndView("hello", "message", message);
    }catch(Exception e)
    {
        System.out.println("Error: " + e);
        e.printStackTrace();
        return new ModelAndView("hello", "message", "Error! " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
 The bean I'm pooling: package com.bean;

import java.util.Random;

public class SimpleBean
{
    int randomNum;
    String str;

    SimpleBean()
    {
        Random randomGenerator = new Random();
        randomNum = randomGenerator.nextInt(100);

        //I'm printing this line just to check if a instance of this bean is created.
        System.out.println("#####################A new SimpleBean was born: " + randomNum);

        str = "This is a string.";
    }

    public int getRandomNum()
    {
        return randomNum;
    }

    public void setRandomNum(int randomNum)
    {
        this.randomNum = randomNum;

I am actually blocked by registration forms ; it happens that I can't declare different forms into FOSUserBundle, and after some research it seems to be impossible. Some answers that I found suggests to use my own registration form, but then How to link it with FOSUserBundle ? Should I populate myself the user table in controllers/forms ? This way the different users would allextends the User from FOSUserBundle, and then I should manage the different forms myself without extending those from FOSUserBundle ? Thanks by advance

@CONTENT:Looking at the Mac OS X 10.8's version of the Objective-C runtime library source code, I noticed that it's got a NSObject.mm file. As its name suggests, it's got the NSObject class implementation, as well as built-in autorelease pool and retain count implementations. However, versions of the ObjC runtime library prior to Mountain Lion's one didn't implement the NSObject class (they didn't have a NSObject.mm file, as you can see at the Mac OS X 10.7's Objective-C runtime library source code, for example). So does this really mean that the NSObject class is now part of the Objective-C runtime library instead of being a Foundation library component? If yes, why? Is it to avoid one linking against the whole Foundation library (with -framework Foundation) when subclassing NSObject?

 That is, the second last record in each group should be returned? Assuming all the RemarkNo for a SerialNo are continuous. The larger the remark number, the later the remark was made. Hence, the second last RemarkNo for SerialNo 10 is 1 with Desp 'rainy'.

Under the GET section, Response Body shows the element type as "(custom)". Are these issues because of the use of generics as the entity types?

@TITLE:What is the preferred way to call an Android Activity back from a Service thread
@CONTENT:I'm currently developing an Android application that has the following needs: A worker thread started in a Service. This thread does some processing and needs to be invoked from the main Activity and provide some asynchronous answers to the same Activity. Invoking the Service from the Activity is easy (IBinder stuff) My question is now about the proper implementation of the service callback. I was first going to add an android.os.Handler in the Activity and handle the thread's anwers in MyActivity.handleMessage(Message) but this requires that I give this handler's reference to the service. So what happens when the Android OS decides to destroy/recreate my Activity due to an orientation change for example ? Does my activity stay alive as it is referenced (indirectly) in the service ? If the Activity destroyed/rebuilt anyway, what happens to my Handler reference in the Service ? I guess I'm not using the right method to callback an Activity from a Service thread, so I wanted to know if someone can point me the correct way of doing. TIA

So how can I actually force the execution order to first install the native packages and then the gem in the same run.

Can someone please explain?? static int fibonacci(int n) {

06_0F                  xmm1, xmm2         5            2
 Now: How do I determine, what ID my CPU has? I'm using Kubuntu 12.04 and tried with sudo dmidecode -t 4 and also with the little program cpuid from the Ubuntu packages, but their output isn't really useful. I cannot find any of the strings listed in the Intrinsics Guide anywhere in the output of the commands above.

@TITLE:Default working directory for Python IDLE?
@CONTENT:Is there a configuration file where I can set its default working directory? It currently defaults to my home directory, but I want to set it to another directory when it starts. I know I can do "import os" followed by "os.chdir("")" but that's kind of troublesome. It'd be great if there is a conf file that I can edit and change that setting, but I am unable to find it. In particular, I've looked into my OS (Ubuntu)'s desktop entry '/usr/share/applications/idle-python3.2.desktop', which doesn't contain a conf file, but points to '/usr/lib/python3.2/idlelib/PyShell.py', which points to config-*.def conf files under the same folder, with 'config-main.def' being the most likely candidate. However I am unable to find where the default path is specified or how it can be changed. It seems that the path is hard-coded in PyShell.py, though I could be wrong with my limited knowledge on Python. I will keep looking, but would appreciate it if somebody knows the answer on top of his or her head. Thanks in advance.

It's a very simple issue, I just want to do it correctly and have a justification! One solution would be to have to two properties, of type 'int', one for x and one for y, within the object. The other would be define a typedef struct of two ints containing x/y values and naming it <ClassPrefix>Coordinate. Similar to CGSize? Are there any other/better ways to do this? Which is preferred?

@TITLE:Twitter Bootstrap - Dynamically Add/Remove Tabs and Tab Content
@CONTENT:Thanks in advance for any and all input/help/advice... I'm using Twitter Bootstrap tabs to organize some information. The tabs will be located on a form page, and each tab will consist of a "contact form", in which the user can add multiple contacts to this page prior to submitting the whole form. <div class="container">
    <ul class="nav nav-tabs">
        <li class="active"><a href="#contact_01" data-toggle="tab">Joe Smith</a><span>x</span></li>

        <div class="tab-pane" id="contact_02">Contact Form: Molly Lewis</div>
    </div>
</div>
 Full code here: http://jsfiddle.net/Harlow/zQnck/34/ I'm trying to mimic the functionality of jQuery UI's "simple manipulation" example of tabs. (http://jqueryui.com/tabs/#manipulation) What I currently have will add a new tab, but I want to be able to add a new, unique tab with it's own ID (continuing from the code, like "contact_01, contact_02, etc.") by clicking on the "+ Add New Contact" which will always be the last tab, but not actually have it's own tab content pane. On the other side of dynamically adding content, I want to be able to delete it by click the small "x" on each tab. --EDIT-- Just to clarify, the jQuery example trigger's a modal upon clicking "New Tab". For my purposes, I just want to create a new tab without inputting the tab name or content (the content will always be the same contact form, and I'm fine with the tab name being the same as the newly generated ID - I will have it automatically update to the contact's name later.)
@CODE:<div class="container">

@TITLE:Devise render sign => up/in form partials elsewhere in code
@CONTENT:I'm just starting with Devise and Rails3. I have the Authenetication down and working and understand the basics. As of now in my Home Controller that represents my Home/Front Page i have two links one that links to Register => sign_up and one that changes depending on login/logout => sign_in/sign_out. However i dont want to redirect my user to login page. Instead i want to display my login form on my front page. So i have seperated the devise/session/new template int to a view and a _form.html.erb partial. And now in my home view i render the login form as so: <% if user_signed_in? %>
    Welcome: <b><%= current_user.username %> (<%= current_user.group.name %>)</b>
    <%= link_to "Logout", destroy_user_session_path, :method => 'delete' %>
<% else %>
    <%= render 'devise/sessions/form' %> // Rendering the partial here
    <%= link_to "Login", new_user_session_path %>
<% end %>
<hr>
 This is the code of the partial: <%= form_for(resource, :as => resource_name, :url => session_path(resource_name)) do |f| %>
  <div><%= f.label :email %><br />
  <%= f.email_field :email, :autofocus => true %></div>

  <div><%= f.label :password %><br />
  <%= f.password_field :password %></div>

  <% if devise_mapping.rememberable? -%>
    <div><%= f.check_box :remember_me %> <%= f.label :remember_me %></div>
  <% end -%>

  <div><%= f.submit "Sign in" %></div>
<% end %>
 My error is as follows: NameError in Home#index

Showing devise/sessions/_form.html.erb where line #1 raised:

undefined local variable or method `resource' for #<#<Class:0x614ec68>:0x6157ff8>

2:   <div><%= f.label :email %><br />
3:   <%= f.email_field :email, :autofocus => true %></div>
4: 
 I understand why the error happens. It's because the partial it not being given the resource attribute. I used dump(resource) and it turns out it's a User model/object So i added the following before it: <% if @user %>
   <% resource = @user %>
<% end %>
 And added following to my Home controller index method: def index
   @user = User.new
end
 However after that i get resource_name error that turns out to simply be :user and if i set that then i get a problem because of devise_mapping.rememberable? which i dont know how to provide. I want to do this properly so i want to avoid messy and unlogical approach that i started.

@CONTENT:I've recently been playing with clojure and reached a problem that I'm not sure how to handle. I have a doseq with 7 parameters and it expands to a huge block, almost passing the maximum class size. Why does doseq expand to such a huge block of clojure code? Example: (def q '(doseq
[p0 (nth (:params operator) 0 (quote (nil)))
p1 (nth (:params operator) 1 (quote (nil)))
p2 (nth (:params operator) 2 (quote (nil)))
p3 (nth (:params operator) 3 (quote (nil)))

p5 (nth (:params operator) 5 (quote (nil)))
p6 (nth (:params operator) 6 (quote (nil)))]
(do-print board (:oname operator) p0 p1 p2 p3 p4 p5 p6)))
 and then: (macroexpand q)
 on my machine this gives a huge chunk of code (97331 bytes). Is this normal or am I doing something wrong? Operator is a simple defrecord. Here's a link to the expanded result if anyone is interested: http://pastebin.com/6gw1q078 edit: By doing the same, but with a for form I get something a few orders of magnitude smaller (3653 bytes): (def q '(for
[p0 (nth (:params operator) 0 (quote (nil)))
p1 (nth (:params operator) 1 (quote (nil)))
p2 (nth (:params operator) 2 (quote (nil)))

(do-print board (:oname operator) p0 p1 p2 p3 p4 p5 p6)))

(macroexpand q)
 the result is here: http://pastebin.com/9MAKK3VD Why is there such a huge difference between the two? The doseq form looks innocent enough, I was really surprised when I got an error saying that java class size has been exceeded.

@TITLE:AVAudioSession / Audio Session Services switching output
@CONTENT:Okay, I have my AVAudioSession defined with the following (yes, mix of the c and obj-c calls) Also note that the app has background mode audio, because if recording it must continue to do so while the app is in the background: [(AVAudioSession *)[AVAudioSession sharedInstance] setDelegate: self];
// Allow the app sound to continue to play when the screen is locked.
[[AVAudioSession sharedInstance] setCategory:AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayAndRecord error:nil];
//Turn off automatic gain on the microphone
[[AVAudioSession sharedInstance] setMode:AVAudioSessionModeMeasurement error:nil];
//Turn on the ability to mix with others
UInt32 doSetProperty = 1;
AudioSessionSetProperty (kAudioSessionProperty_OverrideCategoryMixWithOthers, sizeof(doSetProperty), &doSetProperty);

//Activate the audio session
[[AVAudioSession sharedInstance] setActive:YES error:nil];
 The app has several different options for audio (only the first two have been programmed): Normal: no audio from app, so don't mess with outside audio Only recording of headset mic: must have no gain adjustments, and don't mess with outside audio (which will be playing through headset) Play music from in app, without recording: Stop outside audio, and play through current output (speaker or headset) Play music from in app and record headset mic: Stop outside audio, record and play only through headset The recording is working well in foreground and background, and I'll add the playing later. However, I just noticed tonight that if audio is already playing (Pandora) on the loud speaker and I go into my app and activate the recording mode then it switches Pandora to playing through the phone speaker, and even after the audiosession is deactivated and the app is backgrounded (but not forced closed) the audio continues to play through the phone speaker until I force close the app. //Deactivate the audio session
[[AVAudioSession sharedInstance] setActive:NO error:nil];
 On the flip side, if the headset is in and the music is playing through the headset when the app is started into the recording mode, then there is only a brief pause and the music continues playing at the same volume (correctly, no ducking). I don't see any reason why the route should change when I activate the audio session without a headset in, and why it doesn't change back when the session is deactivated. Especially changing to the phone speaker! Is there something that I'm doing wrong, or do I just need to define the AVAudioSession differently depending on what the user wants to do (instead of the blanket play+record and mode measurement)? And even if I need to define it separately for different use cases. For instance the audio will -always- be going through the headset if the app is recording, and if the app is not recording, then the audio output either the headset or loud speaker (depending on if the user has a headset plugged in or not - i.e., normal behavior). Additional Details Okay, I tried switching all the code c and noticed a note buried within the docs about kAudioSessionProperty_OverrideAudioRoute kAudioSessionOverrideAudioRoute_None Specifies, for the kAudioSessionCategory_PlayAndRecord category, that output audio should go to the receiver. This is the default output audio route for this category. So then I tried setting this property (these properties) in 3 different ways: kAudioSessionProperty_OverrideAudioRoute with kAudioSessionOverrideAudioRoute_Speaker continues playing the audio, but switches it out through the receiver, and shows the route as ReceiverAndMicrophone kAudioSessionProperty_OverrideCategoryDefaultToSpeaker with kAudioSessionOverrideAudioRoute_Speaker stops the currently playing audio, and shows the route as SpeakerAndMicrophone kAudioSessionProperty_OverrideCategoryDefaultToSpeaker with a value of 1 does the same thing as kAudioSessionOverrideAudioRoute_Speaker So basically the docs say that the default is to switch to the Receiver. However, no matter what I do, I can't seem to keep the Speaker output and keep the outside audio playing.

@TITLE:Release/Acquire semantics wrt std::mutex
@CONTENT:I am reading the C++ memory model defined in n3485 and it talks about release/acquire semantics, which from what I understand, and also from the definitions given in this blog: Acquire semantics is a property which can only apply to operations which read from shared memory, whether they are read-modify-write operations or plain loads. The operation is then considered a read-acquire. Acquire semantics prevent memory reordering of the read-acquire with any read or write operation which follows it in program order. Release semantics is a property which can only apply to operations which write to shared memory, whether they are read-modify-write operations or plain stores. The operation is then considered a write-release. Release semantics prevent memory reordering of the write-release with any read or write operation which precedes it in program order. is going to prevent reordering of reads/writes before or after the current read/write being done. The first (acquire) will make sure that the read currently being done is not reordered with any read/write coming after it, the latter (release) will make sure that the current write is not being reordered with read/write operations that come before it. Now can it be said that std::mutex::lock will have acquire semantics and that std::mutex::unlock essentially has release semantics? In the Standard I can find this under section 30.4.1.2 Mutex types [thread.mutex.requirements.mutex] 11 Synchronization: Prior unlock() operations on the same object shall synchronize with (1.10) this operation. From what I understand synchronize with is not explicitly defined in the standard, however it seems to be a type of happens before relation looking at two statements being evaluated between two different threads, however, from my understanding of acquire/release semantics, this has more to do with memory reordering. synchronize with could also be called release/acquire semantics? So do release/acquire semantics apply not only to reordering of load/store operations and also intra-thread interleaving of operations? In the standard section about the memory-model it mostly talks about ordered relations in terms of two threads interleaving. This leaves open to interpretation as to whether this applies also to memory ordering. Can anybody clarify?

@TITLE:Plotting animated exchange (plotting directional edges)
@CONTENT:I once saw this plot (LINK) on shipping trades. I work with dialogue exchanges and thought it may be interesting to map this sort of exchange using R. This is a larger question but I think it may be useful to the community at large. Let's say we have 7 people sitting around a table like this: And I have recorded dialogue exchanges speaker talks and listener hears. I've created a dummy data.frame with this sort of information. here's the head:   speaker receiver duration speaker.x speaker.y receiver.x receiver.y

 I'd like to create animated arrows (from speaker to receiver) that are colored by speaker and weighted (time/duration and length and/or thickness) and animated in the same fashion as the shipping data (row number is the order in which the speech occurs). I think that perhaps the animation package may be useful here but have no clue. Maybe this isn't possible with R currently (as indicated by Ben Schmidt's statement, "I've been hoping I might be able to give up on ArcGIS for the next map project I do and keep everything in R--I'm not convinced after this experience that it will be possible"). I think many people in many fields could use this sort of mapping of exchanges, it just happens that I'm interested in an exchange of dialogue. Eventually I'd plot this on top of a raster image but that's the easy part. Here's the data and plots this far. #the data

@TITLE:Is there a nice way to wrap each Meteor.user in an object with prototype functions and such?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to come up with a nice way to wrap each user I fetch from the Meteor Accounts Collection in a function, including a few prototype helper functions and counts from other collections, etc. The best way to describe this is in code. The User function I want to wrap each user in would look something like this: // - - - - - -
// USER OBJECT
// - - - - - -

var currentUser = null; // holds the currentUser object when aplicable

function User(fbId) {
    var self   = this,
        u      = (typeof id_or_obj == 'string' || id_or_obj instanceof String ? Meteor.users.findOne({'profile.facebook.id': id_or_obj}) : id_or_obj);

    self.fb_id = parseInt(u.profile.facebook.id, 10),

    // Basic info
    self.first_name = u.profile.facebook.first_name,
    self.last_name  = u.profile.facebook.last_name,
    self.name       = u.name,
    self.birthday   = u.birthday,
    self.email      = u.profile.facebook.email,

    // Quotes
    self.likeCount  = Likes.find({fb_id: self.fb_id}).count() || 0;
}

// - - - - - - -
// USER FUNCTIONS
// - - - - - - -

User.prototype = {

    // Get users avatar
    getAvatar: function() {
        return '//graph.facebook.com/' + this.fb_id + '/picture';
    },

    getName: function(first_only) {
        return (first_only ? this.first_name : this.name);
    }

};
 I can easily have a global 'currentUser' variable, that holds this information about the currently logged in user on the client side like this: Meteor.autorun(function() {
    if (Meteor.user()) {
        currentUser = new User(Meteor.user().profile.facebook.id);
    }
});
 It's also easy to implement this into a Handlebars helper, replacing the use of {{currentUser}} like this: Handlebars.registerHelper('thisUser', function() {
    if (Meteor.user()) {
        return new User(Meteor.user());
    } else {
        return false;
    }
});
 What I want to do in addition to this is to make it so that when Meteor returns Meteor.user() or Meteor.users.find({}).fetch(), it includes these helper functions and short handles for first_name, last_name, etc. Can I somehow extend Meteor.user() or is there some way to do this?
@CODE:// - - - - - -
// USER OBJECT
// - - - - - -

var currentUser = null; // holds the currentUser object when aplicable

function User(fbId) {
    var self   = this,
        u      = (typeof id_or_obj == 'string' || id_or_obj instanceof String ? Meteor.users.findOne({'profile.facebook.id': id_or_obj}) : id_or_obj);

    self.fb_id = parseInt(u.profile.facebook.id, 10),

    // Basic info
    self.first_name = u.profile.facebook.first_name,
    self.last_name  = u.profile.facebook.last_name,
    self.name       = u.name,
    self.birthday   = u.birthday,
    self.email      = u.profile.facebook.email,

    // Quotes
    self.likeCount  = Likes.find({fb_id: self.fb_id}).count() || 0;
}

// - - - - - - -
// USER FUNCTIONS
// - - - - - - -

User.prototype = {

    // Get users avatar
    getAvatar: function() {
        return '//graph.facebook.com/' + this.fb_id + '/picture';
    },

    getName: function(first_only) {
        return (first_only ? this.first_name : this.name);
    }

}; Meteor.autorun(function() {
    if (Meteor.user()) {
        currentUser = new User(Meteor.user().profile.facebook.id);
    }
}); {{currentUser}} Handlebars.registerHelper('thisUser', function() {
    if (Meteor.user()) {
        return new User(Meteor.user());
    } else {

@TITLE:How to see javascript console output from Windows Phone 8 Emulator or device running Phonegap app
@CONTENT:I am developing a mobile app using Phonegap Build to generate for different mobile platforms. I have successfully deployed and debugged my APK file on Android devices using adb tools and ddms. Now on to Windows Phone 8, but I am having trouble figuring out how to debug. I have a Windows 8 Pro machine and have successfully installed Windows Phone SDK, deployed the XAP file to both the emulator and a Windows Phone 8 device using the Application Deployment tool (got the MS Dev subscription, registered the phone, all that stuff). The app loads but appears to not receive the deviceready event, but I really have no idea because I can't see the console log. The SDK came with Visual Studio Express, but I don't see how to open an XAP to run it from VS so the output might go to the VS debug windows. Is there any way to see the console.log statements from my XAP from Phonegap Build? or must I create a VS project and compile/run from there?

@TITLE:OpenGL ES Tracer does not collect any data on my Nexus 10
@CONTENT:I'm trying to use the OpenGL ES Tracer, but it just doesn't collect any data. I get to the following screen, but the trace file stays emtpy: I've tried it also with the OpenGLES20Complete example app from Google, to exclude that anything specific to my app is causing this problem, but it just doesn't work. I'm following the documentation for the OpenGL ES Tracer, except that I'm using IntelliJ IDEA and start the Monitor tool from there. I'm using a Nexus 10 with Android 4.2, so it fulfills the minimum version requirements. I now also managed to try it on a different device (a Samsung Galaxy i9000 on Cyanogenmod 10), and there the OpenGL tracing works. So there seems to be something specific to the hardware or the OS running on the Android device that disables or enables the tracing. Are there any further steps or settings I have to take to make this work? What could be the reason why I can't collect any OpenGL traces?

@TITLE:inotify not firing notifications on file modification
@CONTENT:I have been tweaking the example here to make it repeatedly watch a file for 'modifications'. My code is here. In my tests the inotify notification is only firing the first time the file is 'modified'(i.e. touch'ed). Any subsequent modifications to the file are not causing any notifications to fire. stat shows that the 'Modify' time has changed. Also, modifying the code to remove the watch and re-add each time a notification fires(i.e. move inotify_add_watch and inotify_rm_watch to be inside the while(1) loop in my sample) did not help resolve this issue. I was wondering if any one here could help with what I may be doing wrong. Also, although I have added a watch for IN_ALL_EVENTS, I really only care about IN_MODIFY events. Not sure if that makes any difference. Also, does this use case not work? Should I change my approach to watch the directory instead? Please advice. TIA. Edit 1: As noted by themel, the handling of i needed some fixing. However even the fixed version is not firing notifications for subsequent filesystem 'events'. Also, adding a watch on the directory as opposed to the file is exhibiting similar non-deterministic behavior. Edit 2: I would like to get this asio + inotify example based on this answer to work. Unfortunately that example hasn't been working for me at all. Any help would be much appreciated. TIA.

 This works very well for .NET4.0, but I have now extended my application to utilise the async/await features and subsequently need users to install .NET4.5+. The above method is not suitable as the installation for .NET4.5 now does not use the regestry path 'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft.NETFramework\Policy" to store any new information, that is that path does not seem to hold a value that changes between .NET4.0 and 4.5. Now I have seen the following posts: NSIS Installer with .NET 4.5 which uses the registry path/entry 'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\NET Framework Setup\NDP' to do the checks. Now this also does bot work as the entry does not change from .NET4.0 to 4.5. I notice that there is and entry called 'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft.NETFramework\v4.0.30319\SKUs.NETFramework,Version=v4.5' can I use this to check the Framework version invariably? Is there an offical line of the way to check for .NET4.5 using NSIS? Thanks for your time. Note: subsequently some installation of .NET4.5 my users have performed have had registry values for HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\NET Framework Setup\NDP\v4\Full 
 a DWORD value named Release was not 378389 but 378181. Making this change seemed to resolve the problem as the entry for the Release is not in the registry for .NET4.5 and below.

@TITLE:JavaFX - waiting for task to finish
@CONTENT:I have a JavaFX application which instantiates several Task objects. Currently, my implementation (see below) calls the behavior runFactory() which performs computation under a Task object. Parallel to this, nextFunction() is invoked. Is there a way to have nextFunction() "wait" until the prior Task is complete? I understand thread.join() waits until the running thread is complete, but with GUIs, there are additional layers of complexity due to the event dispatch thread. As a matter of fact, adding thread.join() to the end of the code-segment below only ceases UI interaction. If there are any suggestions how to make nextFunction wait until its prior function, runFactory is complete, I'd be very appreciative. Thanks, // High-level class to run the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm.
public class AlignmentFactory {
    public void perform() {

@TITLE:Accessing 802.11 Wireless Management Frames from Python
@CONTENT:From Python on Linux I would like to sniff 802.11 management 'probe-request' frames. This is possible from Scapy like so: # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
from scapy.all import *

def proc(p):
        if ( p.haslayer(Dot11ProbeReq) ):
                mac=re.sub(':','',p.addr2)
                ssid=p[Dot11Elt].info
                ssid=ssid.decode('utf-8','ignore')
                if ssid == "":
                        ssid="<BROADCAST>"
                print "%s:%s" %(mac,ssid)

sniff(iface="mon0",prn=proc)
 Or from tshark like so: tshark -n -i mon0 subtype probereq -R 'wlan.fc.type_subtype eq 4' -T fields -e wlan.sa -e wlan_mgt.ssid
 We could redirect the output from tshark, and slurp it up with some Python (not pretty, but it works). However, both of these options have GPL licensing, which makes potential commercial projects tricky. I'm therefore trying to figure out a 'lower level' solution in Python for this specific problem. From Google I've managed to work out two potential directions to try: Pcap libraries: There seem to be three pcap libraries available for Python: pylibpcap, pypcap, and pcapy. I'm not too sure how to approach incorporating the above functionality into these. Any sample code or solutions would be great. Raw sockets: PF_PACKET: "Packet sockets are used to receive or send raw packets at the device driver (OSI Layer 2) level. They allow the user to implement protocol modules in user space on top of the physical layer." This sounds like it could be another option, bypassing pcap altogether. I've heard comments that this may even be a better approach, removing the overhead of pcap libraries. I'm not sure where to start tackling this, though. Any help in solving this would be greatly appreciated.

@CONTENT:I have an app with an exported activity that can be invoked from other apps (Specifically the sharing action - android.intent.action.SEND) How can an exported activity be excluded from recents? I don't see a way to set the FLAG_ACTIVITY_EXCLUDE_FROM_RECENTS flag, because it is invoked from the outside. The reason I want to do this is because this intent becomes the last one in my activity stack, thus when clicking on the recents, a file is being re-shared instead of the main activity to pop up. Note: android:launchMode="singleTask" solves the problem in a specific case, only where another activity is on top. BUT, this isn't an option because it disrupts the user task flow and doesn't work if there is no other app's activity at the root.

@LINK:/questions/15193117/solr-jvm-peak-every-hour
@TITLE:Solr (JVM) peak every hour
@CONTENT:SOLVED In our case the problem was that for the SuggestRequestHandler (requestHandler name="/suggest") now facelimit has been set: 10 Also there has been several requests for each single suggest request made by the application. Why this led to a (just) hourly peak is quite not clear yet... Thank you all for tips and help - I appreciated! Every full hour (12:00, 13:00, 14:00, ..., 20:00, 21:00, 22:00, 23:00) our Solr/Java process has a peak - which means the Java process where Solr is running increases 3x times CPU usage and the response time take - which usually takes msecs to respond, up to 9 seconds. Always for 2 - 3 minutes and only if there is traffic on our site (there is a php application which calls Java). Crond was completely disabled but still the problem on every full hour. And basically I think we tried almost every GC and memory combination (or maybe not?) Someone any idea why this happens - here some details: System: 32 GB RAM, 24 Core (mostly shared with php-fpm, but even isolated just solr as test same problem) Solr version 3.6 (on Jetty - temporarily also Glassfish) OS: RHEL 5.7 Multicore setup (4 indexes with each 2 cores) Used Handlers (solrconfig.xml): <requestHandler name="standard" class="solr.SearchHandler" default="true">
