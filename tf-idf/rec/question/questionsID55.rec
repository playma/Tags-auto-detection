@TITLE:32-bit MAPI app with 64-bit Outlook
@CONTENT:The 32-bit version of our app is unable to send email using MAPISendMail with 64-bit Outlook installed. It returns an error 0x80004005, about which I can find little information beyond the fact that it seems to be a MAPI initialization error. According to this MSDN document, MAPISendMail is the one exception to the rule that 32-bit apps can't use 64-bit MAPI. And yet it doesn't work (at least with XP and Vista--we haven't tested Win7/8 yet). Can anyone shed any light on this? TIA

@TITLE:Monotouch.Dialog IOS 6 Split view Rotation issue
@CONTENT:BUMP .. still havent figured this out, the thing rotates, but out of view. so weird. can i provide better information to get help? STILL HAVING THIS ISSUE! its really bad i cant fix this :( help PLEASE BUMP .. please im dieing here! someone anyone! :) So, I'm using Monotouch.Dialog and since IOS 6, the rotation of my splitview controller is acting weird. It is actually rotating, but my detail view takes up the whole screen and the master view seems as if its being rotated off the screen frame. That is, I can see the master view for a split second when it rotates then it's gone, and the detail view takes the whole screen. I've added the necessary ShouldAutorotate function and set the GetSupportedInterfaceOrientations since IOS 6. Like I said it rotates, but something is just off. I've tried the IOS 5 simulator and it works, so it's definitely an IOS 6 problem. Anyone have an idea where else I should look for the problem? EDIT: I noticed while debugging that it doesnt go into the ShouldAutorotate override of my master and detail view, only in my split view controller it goes in. In iOS 5 it goes into ShouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation properly. Here is the code i use in my Detail and Master views: public override bool ShouldAutorotate()
    {
        return true;
    }
    [Obsolete]
    public override bool ShouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation       (MonoTouch.UIKit.UIInterfaceOrientation toInterfaceOrientation)
    {
        return true;
    }
 And here is the code i have in my SplitViewController: public override bool ShouldAutorotate()
    {
        return true;
    }

    [Obsolete]
    public override bool ShouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation(UIInterfaceOrientation requested)
    {
        return requested == UIInterfaceOrientation.LandscapeRight || requested == UIInterfaceOrientation.LandscapeLeft;
        //return requested == UIInterfaceOrientation.Portrait || requested == UIInterfaceOrientation.PortraitUpsideDown;

    }

    public override bool ShouldAutomaticallyForwardRotationMethods {
        get {
            return true;
        }
    }
 anyone please? i need this for my work and i cant solve this! any ideas would be helpful!

@TITLE:JOGL setup on Mountain Lion
@CONTENT:I am trying to setup JOGL on Mountain Lion. I want to use it without an IDE like Eclipse or sth. but I just can't get it work. What I did: Downloaded the latest JOGL build from here: http://jogamp.org/wiki/index.php/Downloading_and_installing_JOGL#Downloading_the_latest_automatic_build Put the files jogl-all-natives-macosx-universal.jar - gluegen-java-src.zip - jogl-all.jar - gluegen-rt-natives-macosx-universal.jar - jogl-java-src.zip - gluegen-rt.jar (like it is described in the link above, at least I understood it like this) in a directory: ~/jogl Next step: configure classpath. On my system the CLASSPATH variable is empty at the moment. So I added my jars once with their full name, like export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:~/jogl/gluegen-rt-natives-macosx-universal.jar:~/jogl/... tried to compile the testcode. Error: javax.media.opengl does not exist tried to change the classpath to match all files with an wildcard "*" -> same issue tried to compile with javac -classpath "~/jogl/*" source.java, same error added all files seperately to javac -classpath, same error This question maybe extremely simple and obvious to solve but I would not ask here if I had not tried almost everything to get it work! Here is the test code I used: import java.awt.event.WindowAdapter;
import java.awt.event.WindowEvent;

import javax.media.opengl.GLCapabilities;
import javax.media.opengl.GLProfile;
import javax.media.opengl.awt.GLCanvas;
import javax.swing.JFrame;

    {
      // setup OpenGL Version 2
      GLProfile profile = GLProfile.get(GLProfile.GL2);
      GLCapabilities capabilities = new GLCapabilities(profile);

      // The canvas is the widget that's drawn in the JFrame
      GLCanvas glcanvas = new GLCanvas(capabilities);
      glcanvas.addGLEventListener(new Renderer());
      glcanvas.setSize( 300, 300 );

        JFrame frame = new JFrame( "Hello World" );
        frame.getContentPane().add( glcanvas);

        // shutdown the program on windows close event
        frame.addWindowListener(new WindowAdapter() {
            public void windowClosing(WindowEvent ev) {
                System.exit(0);

@LINK:/questions/12804692/creating-an-xpath-search-app
@TITLE:Creating an XPath search app [closed]
@CONTENT:I asked a question last week about creating a script to search an XML feed of events information. Using multiple Xpath queries to search XML The question was closed with the suggestion I come back once I've written some code. I've done that now, so I wanted to post what I'd done and ask if I've approached this in the right way. Here are the parameters I want to search: id - brings back the information for the specific event with the matching id attribute. q - a general search query that will return matches anywhere in an event note keywords, venue, ticketed, starttime - look for matches within these specific elements program_list, performer_list - look for matches in any children of these elements (there are multiple performers in each event) dateFrom, dateTo - allow for a date range search. Here's a sample event:   <event id="69399">
    <starttimeunixtime>1349791200</starttimeunixtime>
    <endtimeunixtime>1350507600</endtimeunixtime>

 It seems to work as required, but I was just wondering if anyone had any feedback/suggestions of alternate methods as I'm going to need to do this a lot with XML in future. Thanks!

 So let me be brief about the code, This code is basically initializing a GUI and doing lot of exception handling, it is indeed important that you see the whole code so that you understand more clearly to answer precisely. This is the layout I get when I execute the program So after I press the SUM button ONE time still the same image as above no changes I press the SUM button again. for the second time So hope you saw that! the textfields are getting shorter in length whats happening? Dont even know where to start from, if you are going to ask me to do debugging, I already did but still it doesnot do any size reduction whats going on?

@LINK:/questions/12803353/applying-checkbox-styles-in-android-preferenceactivity
@TITLE:Applying Checkbox Styles in Android PreferenceActivity
@CONTENT:I am writing an application that SDK 10+. I would like all of my check boxes in my Activities as well as my PreferenceActivity to look the same. I created a Theme that has a Theme.Black parent. I created a child style of android:Widget.CompoundButton.CheckBox and set the android:checkboxStyle to that child theme. I have applied my theme across the entire app in the application manifest element with: android:theme="@style/AppTheme"
 When I look at the main Activity, the check box style has been applied as expected, but the checkbox in the PreferenceActivity does not have the style. My questions are: Is it possible to style minor parts of preferences without having to specify an entire new layout for each one? More generally, I would like to do this for other controls that show up in the preferences, like toggles or switches. Is that possible? (My guess is that the solution to one will pretty much be able to be applied to those particular issues as well) I know there is an issue for nested preferences, but this question is applicable to Preferences at the top level. Any help is greatly appreciated. I have been banging my head against a wall on this one for a couple hours now... Here is what I have so far: prefs.xml <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<PreferenceScreen xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android" >

    <CheckBoxPreference
        android:key="checkbox1"
        android:summary="This is a themed checkbox preference"
        android:title="Checkbox 1" />

@TITLE:Bind an inputRichText to a Bean
@CONTENT:I'm trying to bind an xp:inputRichText to a bean (ChatBean), but get this validation error when the code tries update the field to the bean: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: argument type mismatch
 I've tried a few of different things like converters to make sure the text will be a string, printing debug messages to find out where things go wrong, changed the type of the "setChatContent()" method (that sets the input to read-only), but can't get it to work.

@TITLE:Create the session during ajax call (php-xajax)
@CONTENT:i need to avoid the creation of the session in the application unless it is completely necessary. I have noticed that xajax calls dont work properly if the session is not started :(. My first approach was to create the session (if it doesn't exist) at the begining of the xajax function, however, it doesn't work the first time the user invokes the call (it works the second time since the session was created). There is any way to handle/fix this situation? Edit: an example code: function example ($parameters) {
    if (!isset($_COOKIE["PHPSESSID"])) {
        session_start(); // we create the session if it didn't exist previously 
    }
    $response = new XajaxResponse();
    .....
    return $response;
}
 My idea is to create the session when the user makes an ajax call. With this situation, the first time i call the "example" function it doesnt work. The second it goes ok, i think because the session was created. EDIT: Hello, i have noticed a problem under chrome and explorer :(. The first ajax call is not received (i get not answer). Than means the user needs to click twice in order to receive the properly answer (with a popup for example) Thanks!

@TITLE:Is it viable to use sharer.php?
@CONTENT:Ok so I know sharer.php URL has been deprecated for a while now, in favour of the social plugins. However, one of the nice advantages (for us) of sharer.php was that we didn't have to create a Facebook App to obtain an ID to use in the SDK init calls. On a project I'm working on the client is already using the sharer.php route, and they do not have an FB app for me to use. So my question is, assuming sharer.php still works (and it seems to) does anyone have a clue if this functionality is threatened to disappear at any point soon? Or at all? I see no reference to it in the roadmap. I'm not asking for best practices or anything like that because I wouldn't generally use a deprecated feature but if it's there, already being used, and works/will continue to work then I'm certainly going to consider it. Cheers!

I have a few doubts I would like to clearify (few problems as well): I tried to query one of the public tables (for test) using this direct URL in my browser: https://www.google.com/fusiontables/api/query?sql=SELECT%20*%20FROM%201W-rjFNnEYYsfJiN2vR8m09XwGQqMQkBHbmRwpQ and faced no problem. Now I want to select all states that have a charcter u in it. (CHANGE) At this first job was to select names of states first. I tried this: https://www.google.com/fusiontables/api/query?sql=SELECT%20State/UT%20Code,India/State/Union%20Territory%20#%20FROM%201W-rjFNnEYYsfJiN2vR8m09XwGQqMQkBHbmRwpQ - I am stuck at this point. Can some body please help. This is a public data and can be viewed here. For this I have already looked at developer docs for querying fusion tables and developer guide for querying fusion tables I am lost on how to access this data at my android side and insert values in it. Do I have to give public permission to my table? I have looked at developer docs for fusion tables. Do I have to make a REST Client for it and do it that way? Also, inserting data from my app is problem. I have not tried anything yet in this regard, but have searched a lot and have not found any thing useful. Any link in this regard would do. What happens after number of request increases the limit? Also, if I create an application using an API key, does the number of hits per user of the application or total number of hits by the application count? Also, what are the charges if one wishes to to increase the limits? Any link or code in this regard is highly appreciated. Thanks

env['user'] = 'code'
env['password'] = 'searce'

def mk_dirtree():
    sudo("mkdir %s" % PROJECT_DIR)
    sudo("chown -R code:code %s" % PROJECT_DIR)
    run("mkdir -p %s" % (PROJECT_DIR + '/www/static'))
    sudo("chown -R www-data:www-data %s" % (PROJECT_DIR + '/www')) fab mk_dirtree [localhost] Login password for 'code': ssh code@localhost

@TITLE:Calculating world space coordinates in the pixel shader
@CONTENT:I have a pixel shader and I want to calculate the position of each pixel in terms of my world space coordinates. How would I do this? What would I need? I have a ps_input structure which has a float4 position : SV_POSITION. I'm assuming this is important, but the values stored inside seems to be kind of funny. I can't seem to figure out what they relate to. For instance, if a pixel is 2d, how come it has a w component, or a z component for that matter? I'm using DirectX and the pixel shader is in HLSL. C++ as my programing language on the CPU. Any help would be appreciated.

@TITLE:Virtual Directory in Tomcat Wont Work
@CONTENT:Help! I am trying to get a virtual directory in Tomcat 6.0 to work. This had been working for years in connecting a virtual directory to a share on two separate servers on two separate org domains than my own. Just recently, and at different instances, this virtual directory stopped mapping, specifically saying: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Document base \xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx\CFSoft does not exist or is not a readable directory at org.apache.naming.resources.FileDirContext.setDocBase(FileDirContext.java:142) at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardContext.resourcesStart(StandardContext.java:4249) ... INFO: Container org.apache.catalina.core.ContainerBase.[Catalina].[localhost].[/callcenter/soft/asho] has not been started It looks like it has something to do with user permissions, as I used to be able to browse (from windows) to these server shares anonymously, meaning without authentication, and now I can't. All I can guess at is that Tomcat can't get to these shares due to some domain authentication required, however nowhere in the context (virtual directory) mapping can you specify any sort of credentials. I am certain my syntax is correct on the mapping: <Context path="/callcenter/soft/aola" docBase="//xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/CFSoft" privileged="true" debug="0"></Context>
 Does anyone have any suggestions? Thanks.

@TITLE:d3: Optionally add child elements based on node content in force layout
@CONTENT:Using the force layout in d3, I can happily add nodes as, say, an SVG group of a circle and some text: var node = vis.selectAll(".node")
    .data(nodes)
    .enter().append("svg:g")
    .attr("class", "node");
node.append("svg:circle")
    .attr("r", 5);
node.append("svg:text")
    .text(function(d) { return d.nodetext });
 However, I would like to optionally add another element to the group, dependent on the node data: so if the data for this node contains an "image" attribute, I'd like to add a new child-element (an svg:image). It's easy to add the svg:image to all nodes (I just do it as I've done the circle and text above). It's also easy to dynamically change an attribute of an element you've already created (by having a function as the attribute's value, as per text above). I do not know how to add an svg:image child element only if the data contains an image attribute. What's the best way of achieving this?
@CODE:var node = vis.selectAll(".node")
    .data(nodes)
    .enter().append("svg:g")
    .attr("class", "node");
node.append("svg:circle")
    .attr("r", 5);

@TITLE:Testing for an Asynchronous throw in Mocha
@CONTENT:I have a block of code that tries to reconnect to Redis if a connection breaks. If it can not re-establish connection, it throws an error. I am trying to test the block of code that throws the error, but I am unable to write a successful test using mocha and chai. My test looks like this:     it('throws an error when a connection can\'t be established', function (done) {
        var c = redisClient.newClient();

        c.end();

        sinon.stub(redisClient, 'newClient', function () {
            return { connected: false };
        });
        redisClient.resetConnection(c, 2, 100, function (err) {
            done();
        });
        process.on('uncaughtException', function (err) {
            err.message.should.equal('Redis: unable to re-establish connection');
            done();
        });
    });
 I've tried using the assert().throws but that fails before the asynchronous throw occurs. A try/catch block also fails for the same reason. My guess is that mocha captures the exception and re-throws it because the uncaughtException block does get the error, but not before mocha has failed the test. Any suggestions? Edit: I had tried wrapping the call in a function: var a = function() {redisClient.resetConnection(c, 2, 100, function () {
        done('Should not reach here');
    });
};
expect(a).to.throw(/unable to re-establish connect/);
 and I get the following: ? 1 of 5 tests failed:
1) RedisClient .resetConnection emits an error when a connection can't be established:
 expected [Function] to throw an error
@CODE:it('throws an error when a connection can\'t be established', function (done) {

        });
        redisClient.resetConnection(c, 2, 100, function (err) {
            done();
        });
        process.on('uncaughtException', function (err) {
            err.message.should.equal('Redis: unable to re-establish connection');
            done();

I'm trying to exercise my GUI from a test framework, which involves manually invoking an event (in this case a button press) within a test script. So far, in addition to other irrelevant guff, I have: # In GUI class:

self.button_1.Bind(wx.EVT_BUTTON, self.button_1)

 My problem is that I don't know what X and Y should be (assuming that the rest is ok). Any help is greatly appreciated.

@TITLE:Access __VIEWSTATE & __EVENTVALIDATION in C#
@CONTENT:In ASP.NET, is it possible to get the values of __VIEWSTATE and __EVENTVALIDATION hidden fields into a variable in C# (server side) in, let's say, overriding the Render method? I have tried: protected override void Render(HtmlTextWriter writer)
{
    StringBuilder stringBuilder = new StringBuilder();
    StringWriter stringWriter = new StringWriter(stringBuilder);
    HtmlTextWriter htmlWriter = new HtmlTextWriter(stringWriter);

    base.Render(htmlWriter);

}
 This gives me the entire ASP.NET output. We can get the values by using a string function, but I did not find it a very clean solution. Is there a better way to do this? What I actually want is the values of __VIEWSTATE & __EVENTVALIDATION when the first request is made and not after the postback is done. That is when the output stream if formed when the first request is made.

@CONTENT:I'm trying to hook up a Select element with a Dojo store. The Select element is declared in HTML and I'm trying to give it a store in some JavaScript code. It seems the Dojo documentation recommends against this and is in favor of programatically creating the Select element when using a store. However this is a yellow flag to me because I like to keep creation of HTML elements separate from their behavior. In this case, it would be ideal if I could keep the Select element in HTML and hook up the store in JavaScript. Is the statement in the Dojo docs really the 'best practice' for this? I'm looking for opinions from experienced Dojo developers as I'm still getting my feet wet with Dojo.

@CONTENT:I have three mysql tables that I would like to extract some information from, the tables are: Videos - represents a video with a score. Tags - contains a global list of tags. VideoTags creates an association between a Video and a Tag. What I want to do is find the videos with the highest points for each tag. There are many videos with the same tag, but my result set will have the same number of rows as there are tags. The end goal is to have a list of the best video (by points) for each unique tag (tags being a topic prefixed with a hash). My SQL noob attempt at achieving this is as follows:   SELECT video.id AS video_id, video.owner_id, MAX(video.points), tag.id AS tag_id
    FROM Videos video, VideoTags videotag, Tags tag
   WHERE video.id = videotag.video_id
     AND videotag.tag_id = tag.id
     AND tag.content LIKE '#%'
GROUP BY tag.id
 Here's the schema and sample data: DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `Video`;
CREATE TABLE `Video` (
  `id` varchar(24) NOT NULL default '',
  `owner_id` varchar(24) NOT NULL default '',
  `points` DOUBLE NOT NULL default 0
);

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `Tags`;
CREATE TABLE `Tags` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,

PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `VideoTags`;
CREATE TABLE `VideoTags` (
  `video_id` varchar(24) NOT NULL default '',
  `tag_id` int(11) NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO Videos (id,owner_id,points) VALUES ('owner-x-video-a','owner-x', 20);
INSERT INTO Videos (id,owner_id,points) VALUES ('owner-x-video-b','owner-x', 15);
INSERT INTO Videos (id,owner_id,points) VALUES ('owner-y-video-k','owner-y', 12);
INSERT INTO Videos (id,owner_id,points) VALUES ('owner-y-video-l','owner-y', 17);
INSERT INTO Videos (id,owner_id,points) VALUES ('owner-y-video-m','owner-y', 44);

INSERT INTO Tags (id, content) VALUES (111, '#topic-1');
INSERT INTO Tags (id, content) VALUES (222, '#topic-2');

INSERT INTO VideoTags (video_id,tag_id) VALUES ('owner-x-video-a',111);
INSERT INTO VideoTags (video_id,tag_id) VALUES ('owner-x-video-b',111);
INSERT INTO VideoTags (video_id,tag_id) VALUES ('owner-y-video-k',111);

    row.add(my);

        alert(i);
    }

    addMinus.addEventListener('click', function(e){

}
 I want to add event listener for accImage,addPlus,addMinus. But i unable to find click event of accImage,addPlus,addMinus separately. If i add event listener inside for loop it working, but the last row children only working. If i click first row addPlus, then the last row addPlus is working. How can i add event listener dynamically for each children in each row. Can any one please..

@TITLE:Compare RGB of 2 images in Java
@CONTENT:I am writing a photo mosaic in Java. For this, I have to calculate and compare RGB of 2 images and replace the target image with the most appropriate tile image. By most appropriate I mean, if we do not find an exact RGB match, an error of say d is allowed. I am using the following code to calculate RGB: protected static int calcRGBForEachFile(String filePath) throws IOException {

        int RGBTotal = 0;

        try{
            BufferedImage tile = ImageIO.read(new File(filePath));
            tileWidth = tile.getWidth();
            tileHeight = tile.getHeight();

            for(int i=0; i<tileWidth; i++){
                for(int j=0; j<tileHeight; j++){
                    RGBTotal = getPixelData(tile.getRGB(i,j));
                }
            }

        int green = (rgb >> 8) & 0xff;  
        int blue = (rgb) & 0xff;

    }
 What it does is that it takes an image from the path given, calculates its RGB and stored it in a HashMap. Is there any better way to calculate RGB and compare them for 2 images to get better results? EDIT: I have edited my question based on some of the comments.
@CODE:d protected static int calcRGBForEachFile(String filePath) throws IOException {

 It works great with FF and Chrome, but IE8 returns "'localStorage' is null or not an object" when I call 'showStuff'. What's interesting is that it doesn't give me an error when I call 'pushArray', which uses 'localStorage' as well.

IE8 is supposed to support localStorage, according to Microsoft and W3, so does anyone has any clue as to where the problem is? Thanks a million!

Can anyone recommend some matlab functions/plugins/starting points for this project? ideally the function for color recognition will take an array of color values and will match them within a certain threshold. Kinda like this: http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/18440-color-detection-using-hsv-color-space-training-and-testing except it works (this one didn't) Update: Here's why I chose not to use the above toolkit.. I start by selecting some colors of interest in the picture and then ask the function to recognize the road in later images... And absolutely nothing useful is triggered. So yeah, apart from the few bugs that I came across in the code on download and fixed, this was kind of the kicker. I didn't try to fix the body of the code that recognizes the colors because.. well, I don't know how, which is why I came here.

@TITLE:Peek into stream of Popen pipeline in Python
@CONTENT:Background: Python 2.6.6 on Linux. First part of a DNA sequence analysis pipeline. I want to read a possibly gzipped file from a mounted remote storage (LAN) and if it is gzipped; gunzip it to a stream (i.e. using gunzip FILENAME -c) and if the first character of the stream (file) is "@", route that entire stream into a filtering program that takes input on standard input, otherwise just pipe it directly to a file on local disk. I'd like to minimize the number of file reads/seeks from remote storage (just a single pass through the file shouldn't be impossible?). Contents of an example input file, first four lines corresponding to one record in FASTQ format: @I328_1_FC30MD2AAXX:8:1:1719:1113/1

hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhahhhhhhfShhhYhhQhh]hhhhffhU\UhYWc
 Files that should not be piped into the filtering program contain records that look like this (first two lines corresponding to one record in FASTA format): >I328_1_FC30MD2AAXX:8:1:1719:1113/1
GTTATTATTATAATTTTTTACCGCATTTATCATTTCTTCTTTATTTTCATATTGATAATAAATATATGCAATTCG
 Some made up semi-pseudo code effort to visualize what I want to do (I know this isn't possible the way I've written it). I hope it makes some sense: if gzipped:
    gunzip = Popen(["gunzip", "-c", "remotestorage/file.gz"], stdout=PIPE)
    if gunzip.stdout.peek(1) == "@": # This isn't possible
        fastq = True
    else:
        fastq = False
if fastq:
    filter = Popen(["filter", "localstorage/outputfile.fastq"], stdin=gunzip.stdout).communicate()
else:
    # Send the gunzipped stream to another file
 Disregard the fact that the code won't run like I've written it here and that I have no error handling etc, all that is already in my other code. I just want help with peeking into the stream or finding a way around that. I would be great if you could gunzip.stdout.peek(1) but I realize that's not possible. What I've tried so far: I figured subprocess.Popen might help me achieve this, and I've tried a lot of different ideas, amongst others trying to use some kind of io.BufferedRandom() object to write the stream to but I can't figure out how that would work. I know streams are non-seekable but maybe a workaround might be to read the first character of the gunzip-stream and then create a new stream where you first input a "@" or ">" depending on file contents and then stuff the rest of the gunzip.stdout-stream into the new stream. This new stream would then be fed into filter's Popen stdin. Note that the file sizes might be several times larger than available memory. I do not want to perform more than one single read of the source file from remote storage and no unnecessary file accessing. Any ideas are welcome! Please ask me questions so I can clarify if I didn't make it clear enough.

@LINK:/questions/12769656/how-can-i-support-scaling-a-view-displayed-in-a-jscrollpane-to-avoid-displaying
@TITLE:How can I support scaling a view displayed in a JScrollPane to avoid displaying JScrollBars up to a minimum size?
@CONTENT:The behavior I want to implement is to display a view at 1:1 scale by default. If its container is made larger (by the user dynamically resizing the parent JFrame) the view should be scaled to fit the larger area; if made smaller, the view should be scaled to fit the smaller area - up to a limit. When smaller than a minimum size, scroll bars should appear with a viewport to support navigating around the view which is displayed at its minimum scale. I have a poorly-functioning implementation now, using a JScrollPane and a ComponentListener to determine when a resize has occurred. Based on the new size a new scale factor is set for painting the view to fit (up to the minimum scale), the preferredSize of the view is set and revalidate() is called. The problem is that this results in "jittery" display; when sizing past the points where a new scale is applied to avoid displaying scrollbars, the scrollbars appear, then disappear. I believe this is because my approach is reactive, not predictive. That is, the LayoutManager is only looking at the view's preferredSize and performing layout based on that. I'm listening for the resize of the JScrollPane and when it is too small only then changing the preferredSize of the view and then causing the container to be laid out again with the call to revalidate(). At least that's how I understand it. I've been reviewing the source for JScrollPane, JViewport and their respecive LayoutManagers. At this point I"m considering subclassing one or more to have a better (predictive, resulting in smoother sizing) implementation. This seems like behavior that others must have implemented before. Is there another way to use existing Containers/LayoutManagers/methods to do this without subclassing and risking unintended behavior across different LnF or platforms? Edit: I've hacked a prototype subclass of ScrollPaneLayout. It checks for the view's minimum size before adding scrollbars. This is working (in that the scrollbars do not appear until the viewport is smaller than the view's minimum size, instead of the original behavior which displayed scrollbars when the viewport was smaller than the view's preferred size) but when the scrollbars are displayed the view thinks it is still the preferred size, not the minimum size. I may have to hack at the ViewportLayout class as well, but this is quickly becoming something that I doubt will be robust. Edit: I went back to basics and tried the suggestions again, and have been succcessful. My attempts to overload the default behavior of ScrollPaneLayout and ViewportLayout, and the interactions between them was not the right direction. After my first attempt I was convinced that there was no way to avoid the flickering and instability of my "reactive" approach to fixing incorrect sizing after the LayoutManagers had done their thing. Fortunately, there is a way to make this work without subclassing either LayoutManager - and as stated, it's by implementing the Scrollable interface (which I had done correctly before, but had not made other changes to make it work). The trick is indeed to implement getScrollableTracksViewport() such that it returns true/false depending on the viewport size. What I hadn't done was update the view's preferredSize in addition to the other calculuations I was doing. This was a critical step. (Note that I'm also relying on listening to ComponentListener.componentResized() notifications to trigger the calculations needed to properly set the return values) The functioning code follows, thatnks for the help. @SuppressWarnings("serial")
class ScalingScreenPanel extends JScrollPane {

@TITLE:How to parse namespace XML in Chrome 24 and jQuery 1.8.2?
@CONTENT:I am trying to parse the following XML: <catalog>
   <ns:book>
       <author>Author</author>
   </ns:book>
</catalog>
 I have researched extensively and found the following (past) solutions and none of them currently work in Chrome 24 with jQuery 1.8   $(xml).find("ns\\:book").each(function()
  {
    $("#output").append($(this).find("author").text() + "<br />");
  });
 nor   $(xml).find("book").each(function()
  {
    $("#output").append($(this).find("author").text() + "<br />");
  });
 nor   $(xml).find("[nodeName=ns:book]").each(function()
  {
    $("#output").append($(this).find("author").text() + "<br />");
  });
 In my research, it would seem that this is primarily a chrome issue and not a jQuery issue. Is there an accepted solution? Is there a better js library to use for XML parsing?
@CODE:<catalog>
   <ns:book>
       <author>Author</author>
   </ns:book>
</catalog> $(xml).find("ns\\:book").each(function()
  {
    $("#output").append($(this).find("author").text() + "<br />");
  }); $(xml).find("book").each(function()
  {
    $("#output").append($(this).find("author").text() + "<br />");
  }); $(xml).find("[nodeName=ns:book]").each(function()
  {
    $("#output").append($(this).find("author").text() + "<br />");
  });

@TITLE:Programming language for multi-platform large software development? [closed]
@CONTENT:I have experience in C/C++ and C#, and I'm planning to create a large software with the help of my friends, which will also include a GUI. It will focus on computer security and analysis, something like penetration testing, risk management, etc. The point is that I want it to be multi-platform software. I want it especially to work in Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. The point is that I don't know which programming language and programming paradigms/tools to use for this purpose. I want to hear your suggestions, any suggestion is highly welcomed. I plan to do several large software developments in the next few years, therefore, I'm even highly willing to learn new programming languages or tools, which will be useful and ease my job.

@TITLE:jeditable showing placeholder text in edit textbox
@CONTENT:I have an issue with jeditable and trying to customize the style of the placeholder text.         $(".labeledit").editable("....", {
            event: "click",
            onblur: "submit",
            width:($(".labeledit").width() + 40) + "px",
            placeholder: "<span class='placeholder'>add label</span>",
            tooltip: "Click to update"
        });
 In the placeholder text I add a span and associate a class. This works fine in the view but when I click on the add label text it places the placeholder text into the textbox so I get <span class='placeholder'>add label</span>
 appearing in the textbox. If I just have placeholder: "add label" then the add label text doesn't show in the textbox. What am I doing wrong?
@CODE:$(".labeledit").editable("....", {

@TITLE:Visual Studio 2010: dll missing
@CONTENT:I googled for a whole day and I'm goin' mad.. Well, that's my problem: I've written my vs project, I've specified all the "include" (by selecting project properties -> configuration properties -> VC++ directories) and all the extern libraries directories (in the same way). Then I specified all the additional libraries by selecting project properties -> Linker -> input -> Additional Dependencies and adding all the .lib files paths. I press F7, it compiles with no errors. I run the project and.. System Error: libsndfile-1.dll is missing. That's okay, so I opened the vs console, I moved to libsndfile-1.def (and libsndfile-1.lib) path and I executed: "lib.exe libsndfile.def". Here I got another error: "LINK: fatal error lnk1104 lib.exe, impossible to open libsndfile.lib" I tried to download libsndfile.dll from web but it still don't works. I've also tried to put all the libraries in my source files in visual studio.. but again, no way. Where am I wrong? Thank you in advance EDIT: I've seen that vs doesn't find the other dll also!

 When I click the Edit link, nothing happens. If I remove :activator => "#activator" from the best_in_place link, it then allows me to click the text field to start editing as I expect; the only problem is this doesn't work on iPad so I need a separate button to trigger this edit function. Does anyone know of a workaround for getting the :activator setting working, or have another suggestion (including a different gem) that they know would work for in place editing of fields?

@TITLE:Android: Broadcast receiver won't receive boot up message
@CONTENT:I've a class MyBroadcastReceiver that is registered to start at boot up. The manifest is below. I am running this via eclipse on a Android Motorola Xoom wifi only tablet - which is Android 3.2, API level 13 (from the dev.android site). I have googled for this and tried a few things: put android:exported="true" used android:installLocation="internalOnly" to make sure it doesn't install on the SD card after installing on the device, I ran the app a couple of times before testing the bootup (as some links said Android 3.x onwards won't immediately start sending boot events to the app unless user has manually initiated it at least once) However even now the broadcast receiver doesn't seem to run when the device boots up (based on logcat).

@TITLE:Open CV, image loading issue on Mac OS X
@CONTENT:I think my question is pretty basic. I was trying to get Open CV to install on my OSX Lion. I had followed all the steps recommended on this link http://tilomitra.com/opencv-on-mac-osx/ However, when I run the C++ code recommended on the website in Xcode, it fails to load an image with the cvLoadImage( ) function. I have placed my image in the project folder (as recommended). Here is the code I was running: // Example showing how to read and write images
#include <opencv2/opencv.hpp>
#include <opencv2/highgui/highgui.hpp>
#include <opencv/cvaux.hpp>

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
IplImage * pInpImg = 0;

// Load an image from file - change this based on your image name
pInpImg = cvLoadImage("my_image.jpg", CV_LOAD_IMAGE_UNCHANGED);
if(!pInpImg)
{
 fprintf(stderr, "failed to load input image\n");
 return -1;
}

// Write the image to a file with a different name,
// using a different image format -- .png instead of .jpg
if( !cvSaveImage("my_image_copy.png", pInpImg) )
{
 fprintf(stderr, "failed to write image file\n");
}

// Remember to free image memory after using it!
cvReleaseImage(&pInpImg);

return 0;
}
 So during execution, the code builds successfully, but always ends up in the following loop and halts execution:     if(!pInpImg)
{
 fprintf(stderr, "failed to load input image\n");
 return -1;
}
 Has anyone faced such a problem before? How could I solve this? (During installation of 'Macports' and 'Cmake', I had received an alert saying that Xcode was not installed or was installed without 'Command Line Tools'. But as per another thread on this forum, I had installed these from the Xcode-->Preferences-->Downloads folder on installing Xcode. However, still during installation, 'Macports' and 'Cmake' gave me warnings, but installed anyway. But could this be the issue? ) Thank you!

 My understanding of the problem is that the "if" statement gets executed before the callback can set the msg variable. Is that right? Or is it a scoping problem? Can I even do it like this, calling "call" from the template? The reason Im using methods here it that the Messages collection can potentially be huge, and I cant subscribe to it as a whole on the client. I have subscriptions for parts of it, but I also need to look up arbitrary messages, no matter what my subscriptions have available.

<li><a href="#section2">Go to Section 2</a></li>

@TITLE:C++: Undefined symbols when loading shared library with dlopen()
@CONTENT:I have an issue when I try to use dlopen() to load a shared library into another shared library. I checked all tutorials on how to use dlopen() correctly. So here is the simplified code: The main shared library contains a class with pure virtual functions which the sub-shared library (aka plug-in) must implement. Additionally, it has some other functions which are implemented with a default behavior. I created a macro which is added to every plug-in to have a symbol to load and create the class. Main shared library plugin.h: Class A {
public:
  virtual int func1() = 0;
  virtual bool func2() const;
}

#define CREATE_CLASS(cls) extern "C" void *CreateClass(void) { return new cls; }
 plugin.cpp: bool A::func2() const {   return true; }
 Build and link main.so g++ -g -Wall -Woverloaded-virtual -Wno-parentheses -O2 -fPIC -c -o plugin.o plugin.cpp
g++ -g -Wall -Woverloaded-virtual -Wno-parentheses -O2 -fPIC  -rdynamic -shared plugin.o -ldl -o main-plugin.so
 The sub-shared library does only implement the pure-virtual functions. The other function can be overridden though it is optional. Sub shared library plugin-impl.cpp Class B : public A {
public:
  virtual int func1() { return 0; }
}

CREATE_CLASS(B)
 These are the lines to build and link the sub-shared library. Build and link sub.so g++ -g -O3 -Wall -Werror=overloaded-virtual -Wno-parentheses -fPIC -c -o subPlugin.o subPlugin.cpp
g++ -g -O3 -Wall -Werror=overloaded-virtual -Wno-parentheses -fPIC  -shared subPlugin.o  -o subPlugin.so
 This is the line to open the sub-shared library. I tried LAZY, NOW, NOW | GLOBAL and so on, without any effects. dlopen() call somewhere in the main-shared library:   handle = dlopen(file.c_str(), RTLD_LAZY);
 Most of this is working very well. However, when I try to load the sub-shared library into the main shared library, dlopen complains about the undefined symbol of bool A::func2() const. The function does only exists in the main shared library, so I guess it must be exported anyway. Please help me out! I am very confused! SOLUTION Because I cannot change the executable, I have to link the main-shared library with the sub-shared librarys by adding the following options to g++: -L$(PLUGINDIR) -Wl,-R$(PLUGINDIR) -lmain-shared
 With this set, it is not required to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
@CODE:Class A {
public:
  virtual int func1() = 0;
  virtual bool func2() const;
}

#define CREATE_CLASS(cls) extern "C" void *CreateClass(void) { return new cls; } bool A::func2() const {   return true; } g++ -g -Wall -Woverloaded-virtual -Wno-parentheses -O2 -fPIC -c -o plugin.o plugin.cpp
g++ -g -Wall -Woverloaded-virtual -Wno-parentheses -O2 -fPIC  -rdynamic -shared plugin.o -ldl -o main-plugin.so Class B : public A {
public:
  virtual int func1() { return 0; }
}

g++ -g -O3 -Wall -Werror=overloaded-virtual -Wno-parentheses -fPIC  -shared subPlugin.o  -o subPlugin.so handle = dlopen(file.c_str(), RTLD_LAZY); bool A::func2() const -L$(PLUGINDIR) -Wl,-R$(PLUGINDIR) -lmain-shared LD_LIBRARY_PATH extern "C"

I don't need the advanced logic on the client and server to funnel all data into one pipe, and I don't need any overhead in my data format to indicate the source/destination of each frame. But are there any downsides to using several WebSockets (5-10) on one client page?

@CONTENT:I have created a windows based application in C# using visual studio 2008 which basically scans for the registry and then fixes the resulting errors. Now using the msi installer i have made a setup and it works fine. However i have met with a new requirement. Usually after providing the setup to the user/client has to install the setup and when installed, in the installed folder there are lots of .dlls that i had used to create the project. But my requirememt is to create a single standalone .exe using which i wouldnt have to provide my users with the setup file. All i need to do is that using this single .exe file my whole project should execute and perform the same process of scanning and fixing the registry. I also tried "ClickOnce Deployment in .NET Framework 2.0" and got the error "ClickOnce does not support the request execution level 'requireAdministrator'". and also have gone through the link "ClickOnce does not support the request execution level 'requireAdministrator.'" But still i feel that i would be comfortable if i can get a single standalone exe which can execute my windows forms application. Is there any way to do it? Any hint with this thing will be really helpful to me. Thanks in advance ~Viknesh

@LINK:/questions/12757478/android-compoundbutton-switch-jumpdrawablestocurrentstate-null-crash
@TITLE:Android CompoundButton Switch jumpDrawablesToCurrentState null crash
@CONTENT:I have an app that successfully uses ToggleButton. I am converting the app for use on JELLY BEAN (4.1.1). 4.1.1 has Switch widget which is a better-looking ToggleButton widget. Both widgets derive from CompoundButton. Android's comparison documentation is here: http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/controls/togglebutton.html It says: The ToggleButton and Switch controls are subclasses of CompoundButton and function in the same manner, so you can implement their behavior the same way. So what I've done is taken my activity layout file containing ToggleButtons, copied it to the directory res/layout-v14/ and replaced all instances of ToggleButton with Switch. This means Android versions 14 and above will use the layout file with Switch, below 14 will use the layout file with ToggleButton. The XML is identical in each, other than the widget name. <Switch
 android:id="@+id/settings_some_option_on_off"
 android:textOn="@string/settings_toggle_on"
 android:textOff="@string/settings_toggle_off"
 android:gravity="center"
 android:paddingRight="@dimen/size_padding_minor"
 android:layout_weight="1"
 android:layout_gravity="center"
 android:layout_width="fill_parent"
 android:layout_height="fill_parent"/>
 In my .java code I'm using CompoundButton only. Not using ToggleButton or Switch at all. private CompoundButton mViewSomeOptionOnOff;
...
mViewSomeOptionOnOff = (CompoundButton) findViewById(R.id.settings_some_option_on_off);
etc.
 When I run on < 14, it works great. Same as before. I get the ToggeButton. When I run on 14, I get a null crash in the Android widget framework. I downloaded the Android source. From the crash backtrace, I know exactly where the crash is. Switch.java: 808     @Override
809     public void jumpDrawablesToCurrentState() {
810         super.jumpDrawablesToCurrentState();
811         mThumbDrawable.jumpToCurrentState();    <------ boom
812         mTrackDrawable.jumpToCurrentState();
813     }
 thumb is a new property to Switch. Even so, I shouldn't have to define it, right? It's not listed as a mandatory property. Just as a test, back in my -v14 layout, I set android:thumb to a drawable. Then I hit null on line 812, the track. I set android:track to a drawable, and the crash is gone. So what's going on? Why am I hitting the null crash? Do I need to find the default Track and Thumb drawables, and copy them in to my app? Is what I'm trying to do -- using ToggleButton and Switch -- not possible?

@TITLE:Subsetting R array: dimension lost when its length is 1
@CONTENT:When subsetting arrays, R behaves differently depending on whether one of the dimensions is of length 1 or not. If a dimension has length 1, that dimension is lost during subsetting: ax <- array(1:24, c(2,3,4))
ay <- array(1:12, c(1,3,4))
dim(ax)
#[1] 2 3 4
dim(ay)
#[1] 1 3 4
dim(ax[,1:2,])
#[1] 2 2 4
dim(ay[,1:2,])
#[1] 2 4
 From my point of view, ax and ay are the same, and performing the same subset operation on them should return an array with the same dimensions. I can see that the way that R is handling the two cases might be useful, but it's undesirable in the code that I'm writing. It means that when I pass a subsetted array to another function, the function will get an array that's missing a dimension, if I happened to reduce a dimension to length 1 at an earlier stage. (So in this case R's flexibility is making my code less flexible!) How can I prevent R from losing a dimension of length 1 during subsetting? Is there another way of indexing? Some flag to set?
@CODE:ax <- array(1:24, c(2,3,4))
ay <- array(1:12, c(1,3,4))

@CONTENT:I have a piece of code that receives a string formatted as a python dictionary "{'a':'1','b':'2',...}"
 which I need to convert to a proper dictionary. I have tried two approaches, using json.loads(s) and ast.literal_eval(s) ast seems to be much more robust, accepting any form of quotes in the string and "just works" while json seems to be very picky about the quoting specifics and wouldn't fail on only a single form of quote format. I really would like to be as flexible as possible with the input and thus prefer to use ast, however, some of my colleagues claim it might not be a "safe" module and function to use. Can anyone advise on ast and ast.literal_eval() safety, especially compared to json.loads() ? thanks

@CONTENT:Im trying to understand a bit more about the workings of bitfields. Given the following code: And assuming int is 32 bits #include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    struct byte
    {
        int one:1;
    };
    struct byte var = {3};

}
 The output I get is: 
-1
0x1
 However I was expecting to see: 
-1
0x3
 Since struct byte var = {3};
 is assigning the value 3 to the 4 bytes of int, isn't it? From the output I actually get it appears as if the above code line tries to store the value 3 into the 1 bit field hence printing 0x1 as the second output line. So my question would be: How does these initializations and assignments on whole structures work? Also, why are the {} necessary?
@CODE:#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    struct byte
    {
        int one:1;

       <td>

 The problem is related to the ID of those two dropdown lists.

@TITLE:Allow Entity Framework 4.5 to use datetime2 with SQL Server CE4
@CONTENT:I am working on an Entity Framework project using SQL Server 2008. We recently changed to use the datetime2 field type for a lot of our Dates as we need the precision. This works fine against our live and development databases, but as part of our end-to-end tests we have been using SQL Server CE 4.0, which doesn't support the datetime2 type. The moment Entity Framework tries to construct the database it returns a series of exceptions like this: error 0040: The Type datetime2 is not qualified with a namespace or alias. Only primitive types can be used without qualification.
 Obviously, there is no value in changing our production code for test purposes, so is there a way to tell it to convert the datetime2 values to a regular datetime or converting them to a varchar? The purpose of the test is to ensure that everything from the data layer up to the interface is working as expected, so if there is a better way to implement this kind of test that might provide a useful alternative.

@CONTENT:Has anyone had success working with a front-end only applications with Ember.js and consuming endpoints from an external host? If so please share your experience. Here are a couple of options. Make the requests through a local proxy (just pass through). Use a proxy + Rails so that you can work the way Ember.js wants you to. Use CORS requests to get around the XSS issue. It seems like the canonical approach to Ember.js is to use a local Rails app to serve up json to an Ember.js app. From what research my team has done, it doesn't seem like CORS is a commmon way to work with Ember.js. EDIT: Regarding the comment below, this is really more a question of how to use Ember-data with an external api rather than Ember.js itself.

@CONTENT:I am implementing custom deploy Task in SBT and I need to copy all required jars to deployment folder. I am able to get paths to all external dependencies using update TaskKey. Unfortunately updateReport does not include internal dependencies. Here is my simple configuration val deploy = TaskKey[Unit]("deploy","deploy")

lazy val projectA = Project(id=project-a,
settings=Project.defaultSettings)

lazy val projectB = Project(id=project-b,
settings=Project.defaultSettings) dependsOn(projectA)

lazy val projectC = Project(id=project-c,
settings=Project.defaultSettings, ++ Seq(deployTask)) dependsOn(projectB)

val deployTask = deploy <<= (update) map {(updateReport) =>
val externalDependency = updateReport.allFiles //paths to all external dependencies are available here
//project-a.jar and project-b.jar are not here
}
 So, the question is how can I obtain absolute path to internal project dependencies i.e. project-a.jar, project-b.jar

@CONTENT:I am reading this: http://www.gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/artifact_management.html to understand how to publish/upload my artifact to a network drive/fileshare which is a requirement (we have a maven repo up and running but some artifacts needs to be dumped on a fileshare). The examples I have found are more focused on deploying to repositories, maven, ivy, etc. I have a simple eclipse java project that I build using gradle 1.2 with the following build.gradle file: apply plugin: 'java' 

sourceSets {
  main {
    java {
      srcDir 'src'
    }

  test {

      dirs "file://internal.newtwork.drive/folder/test"
  }
}

uploadArchives {
  repositories {
      add project.repositories.fileRepo
  }
}
 Where in the gradle docs can I read about how to copy resources to a remote fileshare? I have tried to update the protocol and the dir attribute based on the below answers but I get this error: What went wrong: Execution failed for task ':uploadArchives'. Could not publish configuration ':archives'. java.io.FileNotFoundException: /internal.newtwork.drive/folder/test/sample-gradle-java-unspecified.jar (No such file or directory) The destination is correct so does the flatDir repo not support networkdrives?

@TITLE:How to get the substring of a string that contains HTML tags using C# .net?
@CONTENT:I have a substring what contains HTML tag and I need to shorten it but display it with the same formatting as it appears on the string. It doesn't have to be exactly X characters long, but it should be short enough to be displayed inside a panel with a certain width and height? Is there any way I can achieve this using c#? What about using CSS? I.e. displaying the panel with a fixed height regardless of its content? Thanks.. Example: I have the following panel containing a label that contains text with html tags: I need to remove the scroll bar without making the panel longer but keeping this height & this width..

@TITLE:C# WPF: Creating UI for drawing shapes using mouse
@CONTENT:I am developing an application in C# .NET using WPF. I want the users to be able to draw shapes on a draw area. The shapes are zigzag lines and polygons. The end points of line segments should be small squares as shown in the image below. In some cases, I need arrows in the middle of line segments as shown in the image below. I have partially implemented the drawing by adding lines to a canvas and resizing the lines on mouse events. However, I have not been able to implement creation of small squares on the end points of line segments and arrows. Is there any package or tool that provides the functionality of drawing such shapes? Thank you for any help which you can provide.

@TITLE:jQuery hover, mouseenter, mouseleave state (opacity animate)
@CONTENT:I am trying to understand them but seems like I cannot. So I thought if someone can help me to better understand how these works. When I add hover state it simply do opacity effect whether mouse is on the element or when mouse leaves element... It repeats it... And mouseenter&leave works fine but I don't know how to tell him once $(this) so I made something and it works but perhaps someone may tell me what is correct and better way. $("nav.topMenu-left li, nav.topMenu-right li").on('mouseenter', function() {
    $(this).animate({'opacity': '0.5'}, 100);
});

$("nav.topMenu-left li, nav.topMenu-right li").on('mouseleave', function() {
    $(this).animate({'opacity': '1'}, 100);
});
@CODE:$("nav.topMenu-left li, nav.topMenu-right li").on('mouseenter', function() {
    $(this).animate({'opacity': '0.5'}, 100);
});

$("nav.topMenu-left li, nav.topMenu-right li").on('mouseleave', function() {
    $(this).animate({'opacity': '1'}, 100);

@TITLE:Detecting WebView Height via Scrolling in XAML
@CONTENT:I really need to be able to work out how tall a piece of HTML is inside a given WebView. It's pretty much crucial to the project I'm trying to build. I know it's not immediately possible but I could determine whether a scrollbar existed on a WebView I might be able to increase the height of the view until it disappeared. Any thoughts on this? Or any alternative solutions / suggestions? I looked into converting it for a TextBlock using the HTMLAgilityPack (now ported to Metro) but the HTML is too complex for that.

@TITLE:How to generate labels, buttons, Checkboxes and textboxes dynamically in WPF App
@CONTENT:I am a newbie in WPF. I am following MVVM pattern. I have listbox in my mainwindow which has list of items. I also have a grid which is empty on startup. Now here is the query, on selecting the item from listbox, I want to generate labels, buttons, Checkboxes and textboxes dynamically rather than using toolbox. ListBox & Grid in MainWindow: <ListBox Name="ButtonPanel" ItemsSource="{Binding BoardTabs}" SelectedItem="{Binding SelectedTab, Mode=TwoWay}" >
        <ListBox.ItemTemplate>
        <DataTemplate>
            <StackPanel Orientation="Horizontal">
                <Button Margin="0,27,0,0" Content="{Binding TabName}" />
            </StackPanel>
        </DataTemplate>
        </ListBox.ItemTemplate>
</ListBox>

<Grid Height="461" HorizontalAlignment="Left" Margin="139,0,0,0" Name="grid1" VerticalAlignment="Top" Width="339" >

</Grid>
 TabName is as string which is part of my model class. ViewModel Class: public List<Product> m_BoardTabs; 
public ProductViewModel()
{       
    m_BoardTabs = new List<Product>()
    {
        new Product() {TabName = "A"}, 
        new Product() {TabName = "B"},
        new Product() {TabName = "C"},               
    };
}                      

public List<Product> BoardTabs
{
    get
    {
        return m_BoardTabs;
    }

    set
    {
        m_BoardTabs = value;
    }
}

private Product m_SelectedItem;
public Product SelectedTab
{
    get
    {
        return m_SelectedItem;
    }

    set
    {
        m_SelectedItem = value;                
        NotifyPropertyChanged("SelectedTab");
    }
}    
 Demonstration: ListBox has 3 items. A, B, C On selecting A, in my grid, I want to display L1, L2, L3 in stack order. B1, B2, B3 in stack order, C1, C2, C3 and T1, T2, T3 so on, where L is label, B is button, T is textbox and C is checkbox. On selecting B, in my grid, I want to display L5, L6, L7 in stack order. B5, B6, B7 in stack order, C5, C6, C7 and T5, T6, T7 so on, where L is label, B is button, T is textbox and C is checkbox. Same with Selecting C. Although its easy to create labels in application with the help of toolbox. Is there a way I can generate them inside the grid based on selected item from Listbox?

 how do i call the same page leaving message so that i can close the iFrame when user clicks leave page message. function GoBack() 
{
   var operationType = '<%: (Model.OperationType)%>';
   if (operationType == "Create")
   {
      window.history.back();

   else {     
      $.postMessage(
         'closeIFrame',
         parentUrl,
         parent
      );
   }
}
 (navigation: cancel button -> page leave message -> if(stay on page then 'nothing to do') if(leave page then ) -> close the iFrame)
@CODE:$("#templateSelectionFrame").get(0).contentWindow.location.href = url; window.onbeforeunload var warnNavigateAway = true;

window.onbeforeunload = confirmBrowseAway;

// Called then user leave window without saving content.
function confirmBrowseAway() {

@TITLE:Can't find an Entry Point 'GetDeviceUniqueID' in a PInvoke DLL 'coredll.dll'
@CONTENT:Newish to Porgramming, I have a project which needs a unique device id for each mobile device, done in C#. Windows Mobile 5.0 SDK R2 Heres the code piece I'm working with:     [DllImport("coredll.dll")]
    private extern static int GetDeviceUniqueID([In, Out] byte[] appdata,
                                                int cbApplictionData,

 I understand that I should switch to frame in order to do to any operations in the frame. My problem in there is: How do I switch to frame? (I am not able to figure out the right locator to use in the switch statement (driver.switchto().frame("WHAT SHOULD GO IN HERE")))? Is there a way to check if this frame exists when i navigate to a new page every time? Thanks a ton for the help.... Mike

@CONTENT:In our app, I have a class describing a person (eye and hair colour, height, etc). Once the form of registering is fulfilled, I click in the submit button, and an exception is thrown: Class: java.sql.SQLException
Message: Field 'class' doesn't have a default value
 I am scratching my head about this, because none of the classes have a field named class, for obvious reasons (it's a reserved word), and in the database there is no column named class, neither. Any idea why this happens? And how to fix it? EDIT: I tried this: classThrowingExceptionInstance.class=ClassThrowingException
 And now it says Cannot set readonly property: class for class ClassThrowingException

INVOLVED <- read.table(tc, header=TRUE)
 The goal is to place the least recent ID from MATCHINGS into INVOLVED by matching on Track1 to Track4 and Loc. An extra condition is that the Time of the matching INVOLVED entry may not be higher than the Time of the entry in MATCHING. Furthermore a match on Track1 is most preferred, a match on Track4 is least preferred. However only Track4 is always available (all other Track-columns can be empty). Thus the expected results are: ID Track1 Track2 Track3 Track4 Time Loc

 I tried to this with the data.table package, but fail in doing this efficient. Is it possible to get rid of the vector scans and efficiently go through the data without looping? dat <- data.table(MATCHINGS)
for(i in 1:nrow(INVOLVED)){
    row <- INVOLVED[i,]
    match <- dat[Time>=row$Time][Loc==row$Loc][Track4==row$Track4][Track4!=""][order(Time)][1]
    if(!is.na(match$ID)){ INVOLVED$ID[i]<-match$ID }
    match <- dat[Time>=row$Time][Loc==row$Loc][Track3==row$Track3][Track3!=""][order(Time)][1]
    if(!is.na(match$ID)){ INVOLVED$ID[i]<-match$ID }
    match <- dat[Time>=row$Time][Loc==row$Loc][Track2==row$Track2][Track2!=""][order(Time)][1]
    if(!is.na(match$ID)){ INVOLVED$ID[i]<-match$ID }
    match <- dat[Time>=row$Time][Loc==row$Loc][Track1==row$Track1][Track1!=""][order(Time)][1]
    if(!is.na(match$ID)){ INVOLVED$ID[i]<-match$ID }
}
 update Updated the example data showing the need for Track 1 to 3. As shown Track1 is most important and Track4 least important. Even if Track1 to 3 match to MATCHINGS x and Track4 matches to MATCHINGS y, the ID of y should be assigned to that INVOLVED row. So: Track3 match overrides Track4 match, Track2 match overrides Track3 match, Track1 match overrides Track2 match.

@TITLE:Javascript timeout - specification [closed]
@CONTENT:This is more than a question, it is a request to ensure the Quality of Service (QoS) of Javascript's timeout function. Looking at the following pseudo-code:   .. start something in JS after a user action
  .. some js code
  setTimeout( function() { doSomething }, 1 );
  .. continue for longer than 1ms doing something
  .. end code for user action

  .. after 

  .. execute doSomething
 Can we be sure that on all major browsers, the code of the timeout is done after the code has handled the first user action? This is independent of the delay time. The delay time is not important, rather the fact 'doSomething' code is executed after. What happens with 0 delay? Thanks in advance for your experience on different browsers.

@CONTENT:I've been aware for awhile that I code about 17x faster in Python than in C, and I guess I sort of assumed I wasn't much of a programmer until I really thought about it and realized that the only problem is that I can't handle C strings/char arrays/char pointers/whatever. I have a block about them, and manipulating them takes me hours. I do not have this problem in C++. But life forces me to code in pure C at the moment, and I'm trying to find if there's some third-party library I can add that will make my life easier. I did some googling and I didn't really find much. I'm starting to consider making it myself, but I feel like I'd be reinventing the wheel. Surely there's something out there? Does anyone know of something like that? Something that makes C a little more like C++ in that respect. I realize that's a silly idea, since that's the point of C++, but you understand, I'm sure.

@TITLE:If set to true, AcceptsReturn disables detection of Key.Return in a multiline textbox?
@CONTENT:In my Windows application, I made a multiline textbox by setting AcceptsReturn property to True. It lets the user enter multiple lines of text into the textbox. Also, I'd like to do something every time, the Return/Enter key is pressed in the textbox. The event handler code is as follows... private void TextBox_KeyDown(object sender, KeyEventArgs e)
{ 
    if (e.Key == Key.Return)

        // do something here
}
 It appears that, if AcceptsReturn is set to True and the Return key is pressed, this event handler is not called at all. Any other key press is detected properly. If AcceptsReturn is not set to True and the Return key is pressed, the event handler is called and Return key press is detected just fine. The problem with this is that pressing Return key doesn't advance the user to the new line in the textbox (as expected). So, I'd like the Return key press to properly advance the user to the new line in the textbox as well as I'd like to be able to detect that Return key press. Is my approach wrong? Is there a better way to do this?

@CONTENT:I am trying to append the same variable twice but it appears the code only works on the second one. var test=document.createElement('option');

@TITLE:Initilizing structures containing bit-fields in C
@CONTENT:Im trying to understand a bit more about the workings of bitfields. Given the following code: And assuming int is 32 bits #include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    struct byte
    {
        int one:1;
    };
    struct byte var = {3};
    printf("%d\n", var.one);
    printf("%#x\n", var);
    return 0;
}
 The output I get is: 
-1
0x1
 However I was expecting to see: 
-1
0x3
 Since struct byte var = {3};
 is assigning the value 3 to the 4 bytes of int, isn't it? From the output I actually get it appears as if the above code line tries to store the value 3 into the 1 bit field hence printing 0x1 as the second output line. So my question would be: How does these initializations and assignments on whole structures work? Also, why are the {} necessary?
@CODE:#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    struct byte
    {
        int one:1;
    };
    struct byte var = {3};
    printf("%d\n", var.one);
    printf("%#x\n", var);
    return 0;
} struct byte var = {3}; 0x1 {} struct byte { TYPE var :1; }; (unsigned) int/char

 Next, in my CreateNewRecord.aspx page, I have this code to include both dropdown list from user control. And I can see the dropdown lists works properly. <%@ Register TagPrefix="uc" TagName="VendorListControl" Src="Controls/VendorListControl.ascx" %>
// Some where in the form

       <td>
          <uc:VendorListControl runat="server" />
       </td>

 The problem is related to the ID of those two dropdown lists. When I attemp to do the insert record, it seems not to detect the ID for "ddlVendorList" and "ddlVendorBUList" come from user control ascx page. Error " The name 'ddlVendorList' does not exist in the current context" ExecuteInsert(ddlVendorList.SelectedItem.Text,

@TITLE:Allow Entity Framework 4.5 to use datetime2 with SQL Server CE4
@CONTENT:I am working on an Entity Framework project using SQL Server 2008. We recently changed to use the datetime2 field type for a lot of our Dates as we need the precision. This works fine against our live and development databases, but as part of our end-to-end tests we have been using SQL Server CE 4.0, which doesn't support the datetime2 type. The moment Entity Framework tries to construct the database it returns a series of exceptions like this: error 0040: The Type datetime2 is not qualified with a namespace or alias. Only primitive types can be used without qualification.
 Obviously, there is no value in changing our production code for test purposes, so is there a way to tell it to convert the datetime2 values to a regular datetime or converting them to a varchar? The purpose of the test is to ensure that everything from the data layer up to the interface is working as expected, so if there is a better way to implement this kind of test that might provide a useful alternative.

@CONTENT:Has anyone had success working with a front-end only applications with Ember.js and consuming endpoints from an external host? If so please share your experience. Here are a couple of options. Make the requests through a local proxy (just pass through). Use a proxy + Rails so that you can work the way Ember.js wants you to. Use CORS requests to get around the XSS issue. It seems like the canonical approach to Ember.js is to use a local Rails app to serve up json to an Ember.js app. From what research my team has done, it doesn't seem like CORS is a commmon way to work with Ember.js. EDIT: Regarding the comment below, this is really more a question of how to use Ember-data with an external api rather than Ember.js itself.

@TITLE:how to get internal project dependency jar path in SBT
@CONTENT:I am implementing custom deploy Task in SBT and I need to copy all required jars to deployment folder. I am able to get paths to all external dependencies using update TaskKey. Unfortunately updateReport does not include internal dependencies. Here is my simple configuration val deploy = TaskKey[Unit]("deploy","deploy")

lazy val projectA = Project(id=project-a,
settings=Project.defaultSettings)

lazy val projectB = Project(id=project-b,
settings=Project.defaultSettings) dependsOn(projectA)

lazy val projectC = Project(id=project-c,
settings=Project.defaultSettings, ++ Seq(deployTask)) dependsOn(projectB)

val deployTask = deploy <<= (update) map {(updateReport) =>
val externalDependency = updateReport.allFiles //paths to all external dependencies are available here
//project-a.jar and project-b.jar are not here
}
 So, the question is how can I obtain absolute path to internal project dependencies i.e. project-a.jar, project-b.jar
@CODE:update val deploy = TaskKey[Unit]("deploy","deploy")

lazy val projectA = Project(id=project-a,
settings=Project.defaultSettings)

lazy val projectB = Project(id=project-b,
settings=Project.defaultSettings) dependsOn(projectA)

lazy val projectC = Project(id=project-c,
settings=Project.defaultSettings, ++ Seq(deployTask)) dependsOn(projectB)

val deployTask = deploy <<= (update) map {(updateReport) =>
val externalDependency = updateReport.allFiles //paths to all external dependencies are available here
//project-a.jar and project-b.jar are not here
}

@TITLE:How to upload artifact to network drive using gradle?
@CONTENT:I am reading this: http://www.gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/artifact_management.html to understand how to publish/upload my artifact to a network drive/fileshare which is a requirement (we have a maven repo up and running but some artifacts needs to be dumped on a fileshare). The examples I have found are more focused on deploying to repositories, maven, ivy, etc. I have a simple eclipse java project that I build using gradle 1.2 with the following build.gradle file: apply plugin: 'java' 

sourceSets {
  main {
    java {
      srcDir 'src'
    }
  }
  test {
    java {
      srcDir 'test'
    }
  }
}
repositories {
  flatDir {
      name "fileRepo"
      dirs "file://internal.newtwork.drive/folder/test"
  }
}

uploadArchives {
  repositories {
      add project.repositories.fileRepo
  }
}
 Where in the gradle docs can I read about how to copy resources to a remote fileshare? I have tried to update the protocol and the dir attribute based on the below answers but I get this error: What went wrong: Execution failed for task ':uploadArchives'. Could not publish configuration ':archives'. java.io.FileNotFoundException: /internal.newtwork.drive/folder/test/sample-gradle-java-unspecified.jar (No such file or directory) The destination is correct so does the flatDir repo not support networkdrives?
@CODE:apply plugin: 'java' 

sourceSets {
  main {
    java {
      srcDir 'src'
    }
  }
  test {
    java {
      srcDir 'test'
    }
  }
}
repositories {
  flatDir {
      name "fileRepo"
      dirs "file://internal.newtwork.drive/folder/test"
  }
}

@TITLE:How to get the substring of a string that contains HTML tags using C# .net?
@CONTENT:I have a substring what contains HTML tag and I need to shorten it but display it with the same formatting as it appears on the string. It doesn't have to be exactly X characters long, but it should be short enough to be displayed inside a panel with a certain width and height? Is there any way I can achieve this using c#? What about using CSS? I.e. displaying the panel with a fixed height regardless of its content? Thanks.. Example: I have the following panel containing a label that contains text with html tags: I need to remove the scroll bar without making the panel longer but keeping this height & this width..

@TITLE:C# WPF: Creating UI for drawing shapes using mouse
@CONTENT:I am developing an application in C# .NET using WPF. I want the users to be able to draw shapes on a draw area. The shapes are zigzag lines and polygons. The end points of line segments should be small squares as shown in the image below. In some cases, I need arrows in the middle of line segments as shown in the image below. I have partially implemented the drawing by adding lines to a canvas and resizing the lines on mouse events. However, I have not been able to implement creation of small squares on the end points of line segments and arrows. Is there any package or tool that provides the functionality of drawing such shapes? Thank you for any help which you can provide.

@CONTENT:I am trying to understand them but seems like I cannot. So I thought if someone can help me to better understand how these works. When I add hover state it simply do opacity effect whether mouse is on the element or when mouse leaves element... It repeats it... And mouseenter&leave works fine but I don't know how to tell him once $(this) so I made something and it works but perhaps someone may tell me what is correct and better way. $("nav.topMenu-left li, nav.topMenu-right li").on('mouseenter', function() {
    $(this).animate({'opacity': '0.5'}, 100);
});

$("nav.topMenu-left li, nav.topMenu-right li").on('mouseleave', function() {
    $(this).animate({'opacity': '1'}, 100);

@CONTENT:I really need to be able to work out how tall a piece of HTML is inside a given WebView. It's pretty much crucial to the project I'm trying to build. I know it's not immediately possible but I could determine whether a scrollbar existed on a WebView I might be able to increase the height of the view until it disappeared. Any thoughts on this? Or any alternative solutions / suggestions? I looked into converting it for a TextBlock using the HTMLAgilityPack (now ported to Metro) but the HTML is too complex for that.

 Demonstration: ListBox has 3 items. A, B, C On selecting A, in my grid, I want to display L1, L2, L3 in stack order. B1, B2, B3 in stack order, C1, C2, C3 and T1, T2, T3 so on, where L is label, B is button, T is textbox and C is checkbox. On selecting B, in my grid, I want to display L5, L6, L7 in stack order. B5, B6, B7 in stack order, C5, C6, C7 and T5, T6, T7 so on, where L is label, B is button, T is textbox and C is checkbox. Same with Selecting C. Although its easy to create labels in application with the help of toolbox. Is there a way I can generate them inside the grid based on selected item from Listbox?

@TITLE:how to call window onunload event for iFrame button click where parent page and iFrame resides in different domain
@CONTENT:I have button which opens an iFrame (which reside in domain say 'xyz') the iFrame loads the page which resides in another domain (say 'lmn') $("#templateSelectionFrame").get(0).contentWindow.location.href = url;
 url is from another domain (I communicate in different domain with Jquery 'POSTMESSAGE') when user clicks cancel button from iFrame i need to close the iFrame but before that it is necessary to show the page leaving message (ie. stay on page / leave page - this is alreday called on window.onbeforeunload). var warnNavigateAway = true;

window.onbeforeunload = confirmBrowseAway;

// Called then user leave window without saving content.
function confirmBrowseAway() {
    if (warnNavigateAway) {
        return "If you leave this page, your work will be lost ...";
    }
}

function documentSaved() {
   warnNavigateAway = false;
}

function documentDirty() {
   warnNavigateAway = true;
}


<div id="bottomBar">
   <button class="cancelBtn" onclick="GoBack()">Cancel</button>
</div>
 how do i call the same page leaving message so that i can close the iFrame when user clicks leave page message. function GoBack() 
{
   var operationType = '<%: (Model.OperationType)%>';

   }
}
 (navigation: cancel button -> page leave message -> if(stay on page then 'nothing to do') if(leave page then ) -> close the iFrame)

 I understand that I should switch to frame in order to do to any operations in the frame. My problem in there is: How do I switch to frame? (I am not able to figure out the right locator to use in the switch statement (driver.switchto().frame("WHAT SHOULD GO IN HERE")))? Is there a way to check if this frame exists when i navigate to a new page every time? Thanks a ton for the help.... Mike

 I am scratching my head about this, because none of the classes have a field named class, for obvious reasons (it's a reserved word), and in the database there is no column named class, neither.

 The goal is to place the least recent ID from MATCHINGS into INVOLVED by matching on Track1 to Track4 and Loc. An extra condition is that the Time of the matching INVOLVED entry may not be higher than the Time of the entry in MATCHING. Furthermore a match on Track1 is most preferred, a match on Track4 is least preferred. However only Track4 is always available (all other Track-columns can be empty). Thus the expected results are: ID Track1 Track2 Track3 Track4 Time Loc

 update Updated the example data showing the need for Track 1 to 3. As shown Track1 is most important and Track4 least important. Even if Track1 to 3 match to MATCHINGS x and Track4 matches to MATCHINGS y, the ID of y should be assigned to that INVOLVED row. So: Track3 match overrides Track4 match, Track2 match overrides Track3 match, Track1 match overrides Track2 match.

@TITLE:Javascript timeout - specification [closed]
@CONTENT:This is more than a question, it is a request to ensure the Quality of Service (QoS) of Javascript's timeout function. Looking at the following pseudo-code:   .. start something in JS after a user action
  .. some js code
  setTimeout( function() { doSomething }, 1 );
  .. continue for longer than 1ms doing something
  .. end code for user action

  .. after 

  .. execute doSomething
 Can we be sure that on all major browsers, the code of the timeout is done after the code has handled the first user action? This is independent of the delay time. The delay time is not important, rather the fact 'doSomething' code is executed after. What happens with 0 delay? Thanks in advance for your experience on different browsers.

@TITLE:What third-party options are there for working with strings in C?
@CONTENT:I've been aware for awhile that I code about 17x faster in Python than in C, and I guess I sort of assumed I wasn't much of a programmer until I really thought about it and realized that the only problem is that I can't handle C strings/char arrays/char pointers/whatever. I have a block about them, and manipulating them takes me hours. I do not have this problem in C++. But life forces me to code in pure C at the moment, and I'm trying to find if there's some third-party library I can add that will make my life easier. I did some googling and I didn't really find much. I'm starting to consider making it myself, but I feel like I'd be reinventing the wheel. Surely there's something out there? Does anyone know of something like that? Something that makes C a little more like C++ in that respect. I realize that's a silly idea, since that's the point of C++, but you understand, I'm sure.

@TITLE:How does a 32bit computer work with large bit numbers? Ex. 512bit integers [closed]
@CONTENT:I have been reading an article on cryptography, and I thought to myself "How does a 32bit computer actually perform operations on a 512bit value, or even a 64 bit value?" Would anyone be able to point me in the right direction? Maybe I am at a loss of how to properly express what I want to know, but Google searches haven't been very helpful in figuring this out. Thanks!

@TITLE:If set to true, AcceptsReturn disables detection of Key.Return in a multiline textbox?
@CONTENT:In my Windows application, I made a multiline textbox by setting AcceptsReturn property to True. It lets the user enter multiple lines of text into the textbox. Also, I'd like to do something every time, the Return/Enter key is pressed in the textbox. The event handler code is as follows... private void TextBox_KeyDown(object sender, KeyEventArgs e)
{ 
    if (e.Key == Key.Return)

        // do something here
}
 It appears that, if AcceptsReturn is set to True and the Return key is pressed, this event handler is not called at all. Any other key press is detected properly. If AcceptsReturn is not set to True and the Return key is pressed, the event handler is called and Return key press is detected just fine. The problem with this is that pressing Return key doesn't advance the user to the new line in the textbox (as expected). So, I'd like the Return key press to properly advance the user to the new line in the textbox as well as I'd like to be able to detect that Return key press. Is my approach wrong? Is there a better way to do this?

@TITLE:XNA draw : using one spritebatch at whole game
@CONTENT:I am developing an XNA game. This is time I am careful about the architecture. Til today, I have always implemented my own draw method in this way: public void Draw(SpriteBatch sb, GameTime gameTime)
{
    sb.Begin();
    // ... to draw ...
    sb.End();
}
 I was digging the DrawableGameComponent and saw the Draw method comes in this way: public void Draw(GameTime gameTime)
{
    // ...
}
 First of all, I know that SpriteBatch can collect many Texture2D between Begin and End, so that it can be useful to sort them, or draw with same Effects. My question is about the performance and the cost of passing the SpriteBatch. At DrawableGameComponent it is possible to call spritebatch of game object if its spritebatch is public. What is suggested, what should a xna-game programmer do? Thanks in advice.
@CODE:public void Draw(SpriteBatch sb, GameTime gameTime)

 For some reason on post it does not populate the object within the view model. So when i create a post action all values of (UserMaintenanceViewModel model) are null. Like so..  [HttpPost]
        public ActionResult CreateUser(UserMaintenanceViewModel model)
        {
            try
            {
                /// TODO: Add insert logic here
                var result = repository.insertNewUser(Session["UserId"].ToString(), model.user.UserName, model.user.Password, model.user.FirstName,
                                                      model.user.LastName, model.user.Email, model.user.Phone, model.user.ExpireDate);
                // If result > 0 user insert successful
 Also, if I switch to getting postback through a (FormCollection form) I see that the names of the html elements are "user.UserName" instead of the expected "UserName". Any guidance would be greatly appreciated I feel like I should be able to accomplish this. Thanks so much

@TITLE:how to do mono to stereo conversion?
@CONTENT:I am using libswresample to resample from any PCM format to 44.1kHz, 16bit int, stereo. I was playing around with some audio volume analyzing of the resulting audio stream and I figured out that in case I have 44.1kHz, 16bit int mono as the source, I have roughly the formular: leftSample = sourceSample / sqrt(2);
rightSample = sourceSample / sqrt(2);
 But I was expecting: leftSample = sourceSample;
rightSample = sourceSample;
 (In case the source is stereo, I simply have leftSample = leftSourceSample; rightSample = rightSourceSample;.) My expectation comes from several sources: That is how my own straight forward solution would probably have been. I searched a bit around and other people seem to do the same, e.g. here. In a very common ReplayGain implementation (the only one I know actually, used basically everywhere, I think initially from mp3gain; one copy can be seen here), it also does it: switch ( num_channels) {
case  1: right_samples = left_samples;
case  2: break;
default: return GAIN_ANALYSIS_ERROR;
}
 This is esp. relevant because ReplayGain was calibrated by this implementation using a reference sound (a pink noise, can be downloaded here) which is in mono. In the ReplayGain specification, it is also calculated like this (see here). My confusion raised after I tried to implement ReplayGain myself and I stumbled upon this. So, some questions: Why does libswresample do this? Is this expected in libswresample or a bug? (I'm trying to understand from the source (e.g. here) but I haven't fully understood it all yet.) I added a bug report here. What is the "right" solution? What are other players doing? What is a common soundcard doing if you feed mono samples to it? (I also posted this question on avp.stackexchange now; maybe that is a better place to ask about this, not sure.)
@CODE:leftSample = sourceSample / sqrt(2);
rightSample = sourceSample / sqrt(2); leftSample = sourceSample;
rightSample = sourceSample; leftSample = leftSourceSample; rightSample = rightSourceSample; switch ( num_channels) {
case  1: right_samples = left_samples;
case  2: break;
default: return GAIN_ANALYSIS_ERROR;

@TITLE:Python deep nesting factory functions
@CONTENT:Working through "Learning Python" came across factory function. This textbook example works: def maker(N):
    def action(X):
        return X ** N
    return action


>>> maker(2)
<function action at 0x7f9087f008c0>
>>> o = maker(2)
>>> o(3)
8
>>> maker(2)
<function action at 0x7f9087f00230>
>>> maker(2)(3)
8
 However when going deeper another level I have no idea how to call it: >>> def superfunc(X):
...     def func(Y):
...             def subfunc(Z):
...                     return X + Y + Z
...     return func
... 
>>> superfunc()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: superfunc() takes exactly 1 argument (0 given)
>>> superfunc(1)

>>> superfunc(1)(2)(3)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable
>>> superfunc(1)(2)

 Why doesn't superfunc(1)(2)(3) work while maker(2)(3) does? While this kind of nesting certainly doesn't look like a good, usable code to me, Python still accepts it as valid, so I'm curious as to how this can be called.
@CODE:def maker(N):

 The thing is that the parser expects Event object but if its null then it is receiving empty array. Since the response is auto generated by cakephp, it has to be changed at a lot of places on server side. Is there any simple way for jackson to ignore Event property if its an empty array?? EDIT: I have tried having two properties with Event name: one array and other object but that too didn't work.

@TITLE:how to vb.net date save to mysql date with no 0000-00-00
@CONTENT:I've been killing brain cell for over 5 hours with this question. how to properly save a date from vb.net to mysql date without getting the 0000-00-00all the time. I have tried multiple suggestions where you format the date value before entering but it gets me the same result ex: Dim departDate As Date
Dim d As String = Format(departDate, "05/05/2007")
 in which i tested and didnt works i still got the 0000-00-00 I've tried:     Dim changeFormatDate As Date
    Dim AddFechaListadoCasas2 as String
    changeFormatDate = AddCasasListadoDatePicker.Text
    AddFechaListadoCasas2 = changeFormatDate.ToString("yyyy-MM-dd")
 which still gives me on mysql the 0000-00-00 I also tried this example: Dim myDate as DateTime = DateTime.ParseExact(x, "yyyy-MM-dd", CultureInfo.CurrentCulture)
 and trying to save to mysql still gave me the 0000-00-00 in my program im grabbing the date from a datepicker as text then swtich it to a string and try to save it to the database like that. if necessary i would love to convert it to a date with the format yyyy-MM-dd which is necessary for MySQL but everything i've done above it still shows me the 0000-00-00 which is frustrating. any help would be very appreciated it. Leo here is the MySQL insert statement i have on my program. AddFechaListadoCasas2 = AddCasasListadoDatePicker.Text

@LINK:/questions/12684061/implementing-html-dom-rewriting-logic-on-the-server
@TITLE:Implementing HTML DOM rewriting logic on the server
@CONTENT:My application does massive rewriting of the DOM on the client side at load time. It traverses the page scanning for special markup (think Markdown) or other patterns, replacing them with sometimes rather complicated DOM structures (using DOM calls such as createElement) to style text but also create diagrams and graphics. I adopted this architecture in order to avoid any build or preprocessing steps. It works fine in a desktop browser, but is noticeably slow on mobile devices (several seconds, even after relentless optimization). So I would like to rearchitect the system to pre-scan the page and pre-build the DOM. I'm having a bit of a mental block figuring out how to do this. Obviously, I would prefer not to rewrite all the Javascript in some other server-side language. Also, I would like to preserve the option to do the building at load time as I do now, with the basic rewriting logic sharing the same code. The most likely-sounding option is to build this as a node app, although I am a node beginner. using jsdom both to parse the input and modify the DOM. Or, since I am an a fan of XSLT, and intrigued by Saxon-CE, even though it would mean rewriting everything, I also considered implementing the scanning/rewriting logic in XSLT, to be invoked either from node (for the pre-building case--do people use Saxon from node?) or the browser (for the load-time building case). Can anyone comment on this approach or throw out alternative ideas?

@CONTENT:There is a website I'm trying to load within the HTML component that uses socket.io for some streaming information. It runs perfectly fine outside of AIR but when within the HTML component, the streaming doesn't run. It is streaming from a domain other than itself and I don't have control over either sites. Any ideas on how to get the streaming to work within the HTML component?

@TITLE:Responsive Javascript Files?
@CONTENT:I've built my mobile site using the jQuery Mobile UI but I now realize that I need some functionality to be different between it and my desktop site (datepicker dates should be longer on the desktop site, etc). I've looked into Modernizr and matchMedia to help me load separate js files but I can't figure out a nice way for it to work responsively. Modernizr only works (unless I missed something in the doc) on the initial load and I'm having problems with matchMedia executing multiple times as it crosses the min/max-width threshold. It works sometimes but the trouble is in adding/removing the separate js files. On top of that (but not a huge issue - I don't think), Chrome fires off an error when loading scripts into the DOM from another script. Would the best thing be to write one js file and then add a listener such as $.mobile.media("screen and (min-width: XXXpx)") to the body's width, changing my needed values? I may be making this too hard for myself, or missing something obvious because I'm trying to keep HTTP requests and site size as small as possible, but I can't figure out a good solution for this. Thank you! Lightning Round Bonus Question: Is it good practice/proper to keep all of the jQuery Mobile styling (data-role data-id data-theme) after switching to the desktop site? It looks awfully .. awful for someone only viewing it on a larger screen.

@TITLE:GUI not updating despite use of validate()
@CONTENT:Here is a Connect Four program I'm making. So far, I'm able to add checkers to empty (eligible) slots, alternating red and black each time. My code may be quite inefficient, as this is my first swing program. However, my only major problem is that I can't really get the GUI to update after the empty slots are clicked on. I tried validate(), but that didn't appear to do anything. Links to the images used in the program can be found below. Thanks so much for your help! import java.awt.Container;

@TITLE:Grails GORM integer validation
@CONTENT:Environment: Grails 2.0.4, Java 1.6.0 I'd like to put a constraint on a Domain Object value requiring an integer value to prevent a decimal value from being entered. Entering 3.3 in the view results in the object being created with a value of 3. I was hoping for a validation error that would be kicked back to the user indicating only integer values are valid. class ADomainObject {
    Integer    anInteger
}
 Controller def save() {
   // Note: params["anInteger"] = "3.3"

   ADomainObject aDomainObject = new ADomainObject(params)
   aDomainObject.save flush:true
}
 Result in the persistence of aDomainObject.anInteger = 3 What type of constraint would be needed to cause a failure? I've tried using a range constraint, [0..1000], to no avail.

@TITLE:Ajax post request security
@CONTENT:I am developing a mobile application using PhoneGap which will communicate with a server(PHP) via ajax requests. On the server side(PHP) Something like https://example.com/retrieveData.php will get the user id via $_POST['user_id'] and return some sensitive information about the user as JSON. And on the client side(PhoneGap-Javascript) that JSON output will be parsed and will be used in the application. My concern is that if someone steals this url ( https://example.com/retrieveData.php ), he can manually send fake post requests and can steal the returned user information? How can I secure this communication?

@CONTENT:I want to reproduce this tab indicator structure (screen is from nova launcher): a dropdown menu and an arrow in the right bottom corner. I have no problem about code but i can't reproduce this appearance. I tried this: mBar.addTab(mBar.newTab().setText(ctx.getString(R.string.tab_actions)).setTabListener(this).setCustomView(R.layout.navigation_spinner));
 where mBar is sherlock support actionBar. This is my layout: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

 and this is my result: The problem is that the button in the central tab doesn't fill the tab indicator. How can i set a custom view that perfectly fill the indicator without margin or padding? Or i have to approach this in a different way to have the a result like the firs screen? Thanks in advice

@TITLE:How do I traverse a JavaScript object and check for nulls?
@CONTENT:Let's say I have a JavaScript object like: var obj = {};
obj.computers = {};
obj.computers.favorite = "Commodore 64";
obj.computers.popular = "Apple";
 Now, I can easily check for null like: if(obj != 'undefined' && obj != null) {
    if(obj.computers != 'undefined' && obj.computers != null)) {
        .....
 As you can see, if I need to see if obj.computers.favorite has been set, I have to really nest some conditional logic there. Some of our objects go 3, 4, 5 levels deep. This is what I would like to be able to do: var fav = obj.computers.favorite || 'Unknown';
 But I realize I would need to wrap that in some method. Something like: var fav = getValueOrDefault(obj.computers.favorite, 'Unknown');
 Suggestions appreciated. Thanks EDIT My checking for 'undefined' isn't actually what I use. It just came out of my head when asking the question. lol But I was wondering, could I just wrap in a try/catch and throw default if exception? function(obj, default) {
    try {
        if(obj != null) {
            return obj;
        } else {
            return default;
        }
    } catch(ex) {
        return default;
    }
}
 Also, thanks to Shusi for pointing the redundant vars.
@CODE:var obj = {};
obj.computers = {};
obj.computers.favorite = "Commodore 64";
obj.computers.popular = "Apple"; if(obj != 'undefined' && obj != null) {
    if(obj.computers != 'undefined' && obj.computers != null)) {
        ..... obj.computers.favorite var fav = obj.computers.favorite || 'Unknown'; var fav = getValueOrDefault(obj.computers.favorite, 'Unknown'); function(obj, default) {

        reader.Close();

        bsV.DataSource = bindingsource;
        bsV.DataMember = "ItemElementName";
 The program failed to run at the line bsV.DataMember = "ItemElementName". Any suggestion please

@TITLE:Serial port - how to perform safe search for my device?
@CONTENT:Im writing application that communicate (via serial port) with electronic device which i designed myself. When my PC application starts - it opens available COM ports one by one and it sends some string ("What are you?" for example). My device is programmed, to reply to that "magic question" with own ID (for example: "I am evil device for supervising employees"). When my PC software receive that "magic reply" it starts working normally and its not searching other ports anymore. Of course im not using stupid questions in data transmission, its just example. Question is - can i send strings like on all (not busy) ports, to discover my device? If I can - how that "question" string should look? Are there any normalized standards? This is not first project like this on my desk, but now im developing solution for little industry and i need to pay more attention what my application is doing, because there may be other devices connected to COM ports and I do not know how they can react. Im sorry, if i made some language mistakes, english is my third language. Thanks in advance for replies.

@LINK:/questions/12676228/type-predicates-over-types
@TITLE:type predicates over types
@CONTENT:I'm looking to improve the quality and quantity of compiler warnings I receive -- is there a way in Common Lisp to include type predicates over declared types as well as over instances -- implementation-specific answers are fine, I'm interested in seeing how it's done, if anyone's doing it. Compiling the following in CCL: (defun non-list (o)
  (not (listp o)))

(deftype non-list ()
  '(satisfies non-list))

(defun example (a)
  (list a))

(declaim (ftype (function (non-list) list) example))

(defun hmm ()
  (declare (optimize (debug 3) (safety 3)))
  (let ((a '(a b c))
    (b '(d e f)))
    (declare (type list a))
    (example '(g h i))
    (example a)
    (example b)))
 I'll get a compiler warning on the first call to example -- the one that provides an instance which can be checked against satisfies. This is good, and with debug settings I'll get a runtime error which is good. What I'm wondering is if I can write something like the following: (defun non-list-typep (type)
  (not (subtypep type 'list)))
 and somehow integrate it so that at least the second call -- (example a) will warn at compile time as its declared type list would fail the predicate non-list-typep Cheers!

@CONTENT:I'm trying to maintain state across multiple calls by using an EXTENDED_PERSISTENT_CONTEXT. My understanding is that managed entities will not detach between calls however I keep getting errors related to detached entities in calls after I have previously thrown validation errors. The state is being maintained in a stateful session bean: @Named(SessionFacadeBean.SEAM_NAME)

@Stateful

@AccessTimeout(value = 10, unit = TimeUnit.SECONDS)
public class SessionFacadeBean implements Serializable

        if(sessionData == null) {

        }
        return sessionData;

    }

    public void clearLock() {
    }

    // Other stuff I dont think is relevant.
}
 The (simplified) state is being stored using hibernate. It consists of three classes (a parent, and two children, one of which contains a list of children): @XmlRootElement(name = XMLConstants.COMPONENT_ELEMENT_NAME_IN_XML)
@XmlAccessorType(XmlAccessType.NONE)
@Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.SINGLE_TABLE)

    }

 Im accessing the stateful bean from a stateless bean like so: @Stateless
@LocalBean
@Path("/")
public class MyService
{
    @PersistenceContext(unitName = GlobalParameters.BACKEND_CODE_PERSISTENCE_CONTEXT_NAME)
    private EntityManager       em;

    @Inject
    private SessionFacadeBean   sessionBean;

    @POST
    @Path("/create/item")
    @ValidateRequest
    public ComponentShortSummary addItem(@Form NewItemForm itemForm)
    {       
        if(sessionBean.getLock()) {
            try {
                if(itemForm.getName().equals("INVALID") == true) {
                    throw new ConstraintViolationException("Failed", new HashSet<ConstraintViolation<?>>());
                }

                ChildOne child = new ChildOne(itemForm.getName(), sessionBean.getSessionData());
                em.persist(child);
                return null;
            }
            finally {
                sessionBean.clearLock();
            }
        } else {
            return null;
        }
    }
}
 To reproduce the problem, I perform the following sequence: Call addItem with a valid name (this persists the item to the database). Call addItem with a name INVALID, this throws the constraint exception. Call addItem with a valid name (this results in a detached entity error on the line em.persist(child). What I dont understand is how/why Im ending up with detached entities. In the real code, I would be performing some request / state validation, before modifying the state (so there is no reason that I can see for the state to have been detached). If I remove the call to sessionBean.getLock() then the problem goes away (the objects persist correctly). The purpose of the lock methods is essentially to serialize access to the session state, however currently the getLock() method is empty, it feels like the problem might be related to the fact that Im calling into the stateful bean before throwing the exception. Can anybody explain whats going on that results in my entities becoming detached / if there is a way to avoid it (and ideally point me at any documentation that supports the explanation)? Whilst there are probably ways that I can work around the current issue, performing validation before accessing the stateful bean at all, Im concerned about the general case (where any exception is thrown after the stateful bean has been accessed in the call). Is there an accepted strategy for dealing with exceptions when I dont want the entities from the extended persistent context to be detached?

 Internet explorer has a limit of 31 style sheets it will load, of which jquery has taken 12. Add in yui reset, base and fonts I'm at 15 style sheets already, with none of the sites styles or plugin style sheets loaded in. Obviously, everything works fine when it is bundled as there is only one stylesheet generated. My first instinct was to use the ones that use @Import but that causes bundling to fall over or not minify. What is the best workaround for this, other than fewer style sheets? My current solution is a #if DEBUG construct but is there a better way? #if DEBUG

    // Creates a mutable data object for updating with binary data, like a byte array
    NSMutableData *pdfData = [NSMutableData data];

    // Points the pdf converter to the mutable data object and to the UIView to be converted

    CGContextRef pdfContext = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext();

    // draws rect to the view and thus this is captured by UIGraphicsBeginPDFContextToData
    [aView.layer renderInContext:pdfContext];

    // remove PDF rendering context
    UIGraphicsEndPDFContext();

    // Retrieves the document directories from the iOS device
    NSArray* documentDirectories = NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSDocumentDirectory, NSUserDomainMask,YES);

    NSString* documentDirectory = [documentDirectories objectAtIndex:0];

    // instructs the mutable data object to write its context to a file on disk
    [pdfData writeToFile:documentDirectoryFilename atomically:YES];

}
 From the above code, i am able to generate a pdf file, but i am facing the following issue. If i have more than 50 data, in my app i am able to see only the first 10 data and to see the others i need to scroll them. In this case when the pdf file gets generated it is taking only the data of first 10 and not the others. How to get the other data too
@CODE:- (void)createPDFfromUIView:(UIView*)aView saveToDocumentsWithFileName:(NSString*)aFilename{

@TITLE:CSS: glowing text with glow very wide and high
@CONTENT:I'm investigating since some days box-shadow and text-shadow. I'm trying to gain the following effect. I want a glow come out from the text of the <a> once hovered. Simple, this should be easy as I explored using text-shadow. Ok, but it works with small glows, I mean, once the glow is bigger you just cannot see the glow due to its high blur. There has to be a solution for this. An image will explain better than 100 words. This is what I want to gain: LINK: HOVER: This is the code I've used for #projectBox a:LINK{
    background-image: url('../_img/showcase/projectTabs/link.png');
}

#projectBox a:HOVER{
    background-image: url('../_img/showcase/projectTabs/link.png');
    color:#fa0000;
    text-shadow: 0 0 80px white;
}
 I know I can use background image again for the hover but I want to avoid this. The problem is that if you add more blur it doesnt appear anymore, as its too blur. the other two properties dont help too much, as I want the glow to begin from the middle. Lets work out this together and see how we can do with CSS a wide and high glow effect.
@CODE:<a> #projectBox a:LINK{
    background-image: url('../_img/showcase/projectTabs/link.png');

#projectBox a:HOVER{

 I can validate that the "webapp" folder gets relocated correctly inside my JAR to /webapp, and that when running the code through my IDE (IntelliJ IDEA 11) context.setResourceBase(new PathMatchingResourcePatternResolver().getResource("classpath:/webapp").getURL().toExternalForm()) maps validly to the resource in question. Also, I can show that it resolves to something like: jar:file:~/Projects/Java/web-app/out/web-app.jar!/webapp
 and is accessible (I read it). However, when I start my application's main method, and Jetty starts, on http://localhost:8089 I get the following: HTTP ERROR: 503 Problem accessing /. Reason: Service Unavailable
 Powered by Jetty:// Where am I going wrong? I know that by setting "resourceBase" to "." the address "http://localhost:8089" will act as an interface to the location "~/Projects/Java/web-app/out/" where I can see a listing of all the JAR files, including the "web-app.jar", upon clicking on which I am offered to download it. I have seen the following questions, and the answers do not apply: Embedded jetty application not working from jar: I get NullPointerException since Start.class.getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource() resolves to null. Embedded Jetty WebAppContext FilePermission issue: which not only isn't answered, but the situation clearly does not apply, as I do not have permission issues (the fact that I can get a file listing should prove that). embedding jetty server problems: also unanswered, also not applicable as I don't have any dependency problems (as pointed out previously in my comments above). I think that I should somehow enable Jetty to access the /webapp folder, which is located under my src/main/resources/ directory and is bundled into my web application. Should I be forsaking a bundled web application and deploy the exploded context path to somewhere accessible by Jetty instead (this is not desirable at all as it poses a multitude of issues for me and my clients).

  s.alias("Object", src.core.PowerShell.MyAgain.ResponseObject.class);  
  s.useAttributeFor(src.core.PowerShell.MyAgain.ResponseObject.class, "Type");  
        s.addImplicitCollection(src.core.PowerShell.MyAgain.ParentResponseObject.class, "responseObjects");     
        ParentResponseObject gh =(ParentResponseObject)s.fromXML(k1);
 Using the useAttribute method I am able to read the "Type" attribute of Object Type, but how do I read the values within tags like 4456, 7789 and populate it in the variable ResponseObject.value.
@CODE:<Objects>   
<Object Type="System.Tuning" >4456</Object> 
<Object Type="System.Lag" >7789</Object>    
</Objects> class ParentResponseObject {    
    List <ResponseObject>responseObjects = new ArrayList<ResponseObject>();
    public ParentResponseObject() {
        // TODO Auto-generated constructor stub
    }
}
class ResponseObject {
       String Type;
       String Value;
    public ResponseObject() {

    }
} XStream s = new XStream(new DomDriver());
  s.alias("Objects", src.core.PowerShell.MyAgain.ParentResponseObject.class);
  s.alias("Object", src.core.PowerShell.MyAgain.ResponseObject.class);  
  s.useAttributeFor(src.core.PowerShell.MyAgain.ResponseObject.class, "Type");  
        s.addImplicitCollection(src.core.PowerShell.MyAgain.ParentResponseObject.class, "responseObjects");     
        ParentResponseObject gh =(ParentResponseObject)s.fromXML(k1); useAttribute ResponseObject

@TITLE:UICollectionView doesn't call delegate methods
@CONTENT:I've setup a UICollectionView in a storyboard and connected the dataSource and delegate outlets. I've registered a cell via nib which I dequeue in the cellForItemAtIndexPath: method. All works perfectly expect that the delegate methods are never called. For example: When touching on a cell, I expect the didSelectItemAtIndexPath: to be called. I've double-checked the delegate of the collection view - it's assigned correctly. Does anybody know the reason why the methods are not called?

@CONTENT:Is it possible to eliminate or edit the elements that separates primefaces layoutUnit elements (top, west, center, etc)? These elements have id ending with -resizer I can't find which class do it in primefaces-3.1.1.jar. For example, when element layoutUnit west after generate into html has the css attribute position: absolute;
left: 0px;
width: 94px;
 then the right layoutUnit after generate into html element has the css attribute position: absolute;
left: 107px; 
 because between them is generated resizer element(div) with attributes position: absolute;
left: 100px;
width: 6px;
 How can I avoid this effect?

@LINK:/questions/12668151/understanding-replaygain
@TITLE:understanding ReplayGain
@CONTENT:I'm trying to implement ReplayGain. The specification is here. Here or here is an existing implementation (actually, all implementations I have found anywhere seem to be derived from this code, e.g. mp3gain, r128gain, flac replaygain, ...). I think I understand the Yulewalk filter and the Butterworth filter. As well as how to calculate the RMS. The section about the statistical processing stays a bit unclear to me, esp. what exactly is meant by The value which most accurately matches human perception of perceived loudness is 95% From the above implementation, it becomes a bit more clear. But either I am getting something wrong or the implementation is buggy. There is the formular val = STEPS_per_dB * 10. * log10 ( (lsum+rsum) / totsamp * 0.5 + 1.e-37 ). (lsum+rsum) / totsamp * 0.5 should always be in [0,1] (this should be the mean average of the squared values which are all in [0,1]). So, it seems to me that this is always <0. But from the upcoming code, this doesn't make sense. Edit: I was wrong. All the samples were not in (float)[-1,1] as I thought but in (float)[-0x8000,0x7fff], i.e. just the direct sint16->float conversion. I got this from the implementation; I don't really see where this is explicitly said in the spec. Also, the formulas, while they give numbers which make more sense, seem more made up. At least I don't see where the formula is coming from. Can someone explain? For clearance, the 10. * log10( (lsum+rsum) / totsamp * 0.5 + 1.e-37) is actually (mostly) the same as 20. * log10(rms). This is similar to what you see in the spec but not quite because of the L_{p-p}. In the spec: L = 20 * log10( 2 * rms / L_{p-p} ) What exactly is this L_{p?p} (the maximum peak-to-peak range of the samples in the audio file)? In the implementation, it seems to be 2 (otherwise you wont get 20. * log10(rms)). Initially I thought this the len of the range where the samples are in (if that would be [-1,1], this is 2) but I was wrong there, so this can't be it. Then, also in the code, there is the constant #define PINK_REF 64.82       /* 298640883795 */ /* calibration value for 89dB */
 Where is this value coming from? Edit: My current implementation: here
@CODE:val = STEPS_per_dB * 10. * log10 ( (lsum+rsum) / totsamp * 0.5 + 1.e-37 ) (lsum+rsum) / totsamp * 0.5 10. * log10( (lsum+rsum) / totsamp * 0.5 + 1.e-37) 20. * log10(rms) L_{p-p} L = 20 * log10( 2 * rms / L_{p-p} ) L_{p?p} 20. * log10(rms) #define PINK_REF 64.82       /* 298640883795 */ /* calibration value for 89dB */

@TITLE:EJB remove entity not working
@CONTENT:I'm using netbeans and generate entity class from database. All of my merge calls to insert and update entities are working perfectly, but when I try to remove an entity, it doesn't delete it from the database, and no exception is thrown. Can someone help me solved. My code below: AbstractFacade.java public abstract class AbstractFacade<T> {

    private Class<T>    entityClass;

    }

    public void remove(T entity) {
        getEntityManager().remove(getEntityManager().merge(entity));

@TITLE:Grails GORM integer validation
@CONTENT:Environment: Grails 2.0.4, Java 1.6.0 I'd like to put a constraint on a Domain Object value requiring an integer value to prevent a decimal value from being entered. Entering 3.3 in the view results in the object being created with a value of 3. I was hoping for a validation error that would be kicked back to the user indicating only integer values are valid. class ADomainObject {
    Integer    anInteger
}
 Controller def save() {
   // Note: params["anInteger"] = "3.3"

   ADomainObject aDomainObject = new ADomainObject(params)
   aDomainObject.save flush:true
}
 Result in the persistence of aDomainObject.anInteger = 3 What type of constraint would be needed to cause a failure? I've tried using a range constraint, [0..1000], to no avail.
@CODE:class ADomainObject {
    Integer    anInteger
} def save() {
   // Note: params["anInteger"] = "3.3"

   ADomainObject aDomainObject = new ADomainObject(params)
   aDomainObject.save flush:true

@TITLE:Ajax post request security
@CONTENT:I am developing a mobile application using PhoneGap which will communicate with a server(PHP) via ajax requests. On the server side(PHP) Something like https://example.com/retrieveData.php will get the user id via $_POST['user_id'] and return some sensitive information about the user as JSON. And on the client side(PhoneGap-Javascript) that JSON output will be parsed and will be used in the application. My concern is that if someone steals this url ( https://example.com/retrieveData.php ), he can manually send fake post requests and can steal the returned user information? How can I secure this communication?

@TITLE:Custom tab indicator view
@CONTENT:I want to reproduce this tab indicator structure (screen is from nova launcher): a dropdown menu and an arrow in the right bottom corner. I have no problem about code but i can't reproduce this appearance. I tried this: mBar.addTab(mBar.newTab().setText(ctx.getString(R.string.tab_actions)).setTabListener(this).setCustomView(R.layout.navigation_spinner));
 where mBar is sherlock support actionBar. This is my layout: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<LinearLayout android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent" android:layout_margin="-10dp"
    xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:orientation="vertical">
    <Button android:id="@+id/button1" android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent" android:text="Button" />

</LinearLayout>
 and this is my result: The problem is that the button in the central tab doesn't fill the tab indicator. How can i set a custom view that perfectly fill the indicator without margin or padding? Or i have to approach this in a different way to have the a result like the firs screen? Thanks in advice

@LINK:/questions/12680452/how-do-i-traverse-a-javascript-object-and-check-for-nulls
@TITLE:How do I traverse a JavaScript object and check for nulls?
@CONTENT:Let's say I have a JavaScript object like: var obj = {};
obj.computers = {};
obj.computers.favorite = "Commodore 64";
obj.computers.popular = "Apple";
 Now, I can easily check for null like: if(obj != 'undefined' && obj != null) {
    if(obj.computers != 'undefined' && obj.computers != null)) {
        .....
 As you can see, if I need to see if obj.computers.favorite has been set, I have to really nest some conditional logic there. Some of our objects go 3, 4, 5 levels deep. This is what I would like to be able to do: var fav = obj.computers.favorite || 'Unknown';
 But I realize I would need to wrap that in some method. Something like: var fav = getValueOrDefault(obj.computers.favorite, 'Unknown');
 Suggestions appreciated. Thanks EDIT My checking for 'undefined' isn't actually what I use. It just came out of my head when asking the question. lol But I was wondering, could I just wrap in a try/catch and throw default if exception? function(obj, default) {
    try {
        if(obj != null) {
            return obj;
        } else {
            return default;
        }
    } catch(ex) {
        return default;
    }
}
 Also, thanks to Shusi for pointing the redundant vars.
@CODE:var obj = {};
obj.computers = {};
obj.computers.favorite = "Commodore 64";
obj.computers.popular = "Apple"; if(obj != 'undefined' && obj != null) {
    if(obj.computers != 'undefined' && obj.computers != null)) {
        ..... obj.computers.favorite var fav = obj.computers.favorite || 'Unknown'; var fav = getValueOrDefault(obj.computers.favorite, 'Unknown'); function(obj, default) {
    try {
        if(obj != null) {
            return obj;
        } else {
            return default;
        }
    } catch(ex) {
        return default;
    }
} obj != 'undefined' && obj != null 'undefined' obj != null undefined getValueOrDefault(obj.computers.favorite, 'Unknown') obj.computers

@TITLE:why doesn't the website shrink to the target resolution
@CONTENT:I had recently created a personal site. I wanted to design such that no matter how low the target resolution would be my site would shrink to fit the whole screen without needing to scroll down. I used % values so that it fits on any target resolution. Here is the design of the website with all the main properties. My problem is that when I make the resolution of the browser small, the content doesn't shrink to fit the screen. This is what happens when I shrink the browser resolution. Why is this happening? Here are the css properties #myPageBody

@CONTENT:I'm having a hard time understanding why it would be useful to use the Taylor series for a function in order to gain an approximation of a function, instead of just using the function itself when programming. If I can tell my computer to compute e^(.1) and it will give me an exact value, why would I take an approximation instead?

            file.createNewFile();
            // write the bytes in file
            FileOutputStream fo = new FileOutputStream(file);
            fo.write(image);
            Uri uri = Uri.parse("file://" + file.getAbsolutePath());
            listOfUri.add(i, uri);

        {
            // TODO: handle exception
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

 And for attaching & sending email void sendMultipleAttachments()
    {
        try
        {
            Intent intentEmail = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_SEND);
            intentEmail.setType("text/plain");
            String[] recipients = new String[] { "" };

            intentEmail.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_EMAIL, recipients);
            intentEmail.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_SUBJECT, "subject of email");
            intentEmail.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TEXT, "body of email");
            intentEmail.setType("image/jpeg");
            intentEmail.putParcelableArrayListExtra(Intent.EXTRA_STREAM, listOfUri);
            startActivity(intentEmail);
        } catch (android.content.ActivityNotFoundException ex)
        {
            Toast.makeText(this, "There are no email clients installed.", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();

 I have checked the list of Uri's is prepared perfectly by sending the each file individually. But on sending multiple files by using above code I get following Exception.

My device is programmed, to reply to that "magic question" with own ID (for example: "I am evil device for supervising employees"). When my PC software receive that "magic reply" it starts working normally and its not searching other ports anymore. Of course im not using stupid questions in data transmission, its just example. Question is - can i send strings like on all (not busy) ports, to discover my device? If I can - how that "question" string should look? Are there any normalized standards? This is not first project like this on my desk, but now im developing solution for little industry and i need to pay more attention what my application is doing, because there may be other devices connected to COM ports and I do not know how they can react. Im sorry, if i made some language mistakes, english is my third language. Thanks in advance for replies.

@TITLE:type predicates over types
@CONTENT:I'm looking to improve the quality and quantity of compiler warnings I receive -- is there a way in Common Lisp to include type predicates over declared types as well as over instances -- implementation-specific answers are fine, I'm interested in seeing how it's done, if anyone's doing it. Compiling the following in CCL: (defun non-list (o)
  (not (listp o)))

(deftype non-list ()
  '(satisfies non-list))

(defun example (a)
  (list a))

(declaim (ftype (function (non-list) list) example))

(defun hmm ()
  (declare (optimize (debug 3) (safety 3)))
  (let ((a '(a b c))
    (b '(d e f)))
    (declare (type list a))
    (example '(g h i))
    (example a)
    (example b)))
 I'll get a compiler warning on the first call to example -- the one that provides an instance which can be checked against satisfies. This is good, and with debug settings I'll get a runtime error which is good. What I'm wondering is if I can write something like the following: (defun non-list-typep (type)
  (not (subtypep type 'list)))
 and somehow integrate it so that at least the second call -- (example a) will warn at compile time as its declared type list would fail the predicate non-list-typep Cheers!

@TITLE:Unexpected detached entities with extended persistent context
@CONTENT:I'm trying to maintain state across multiple calls by using an EXTENDED_PERSISTENT_CONTEXT. My understanding is that managed entities will not detach between calls however I keep getting errors related to detached entities in calls after I have previously thrown validation errors. The state is being maintained in a stateful session bean: @Named(SessionFacadeBean.SEAM_NAME)
@SessionScoped
@Stateful
@LocalBean
@AccessTimeout(value = 10, unit = TimeUnit.SECONDS)
public class SessionFacadeBean implements Serializable
{
    public static final String  SEAM_NAME        = "sessionCacheBean";

    @PersistenceContext(unitName = GlobalParameters.BACKEND_CODE_PERSISTENCE_CONTEXT_NAME, type = PersistenceContextType.EXTENDED)
    private EntityManager       em;

    private ParentOne sessionData;

    public synchronized ParentOne getSessionData() {
        if(sessionData == null) {
            sessionData = new ChildTwo();
        }
        return sessionData;
    }

    public boolean getLock() {
        return true;
    }

    public void clearLock() {
    }

    // Other stuff I dont think is relevant.
}
 The (simplified) state is being stored using hibernate. It consists of three classes (a parent, and two children, one of which contains a list of children): @XmlRootElement(name = XMLConstants.COMPONENT_ELEMENT_NAME_IN_XML)
@XmlAccessorType(XmlAccessType.NONE)
@Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.SINGLE_TABLE)
@DiscriminatorColumn(name = "Class", length = 50)
@Entity
public class ParentOne 
{   
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
    @XmlElement(name = "ID")
    private Long              iD;

    @XmlElement(name = "name")
    protected String              friendlyName          = "";
}


@XmlRootElement(name = XMLConstants.COMPONENT_ELEMENT_NAME_IN_XML)

public class ChildOne extends ParentOne
{
    public ChildOne(String name, ParentOne child) {
        super(name);
        myChild = child;
    }

    @ManyToOne(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
    protected ParentOne myChild;   
}


@XmlRootElement(name = XMLConstants.COMPONENT_ELEMENT_NAME_IN_XML)
@XmlAccessorType(XmlAccessType.NONE)
@Entity
public class ChildTwo extends ParentOne
{
    public ChildTwo() {
            super(common);
    }
}
 Im accessing the stateful bean from a stateless bean like so: @Stateless
@LocalBean
@Path("/")
public class MyService
{
    @PersistenceContext(unitName = GlobalParameters.BACKEND_CODE_PERSISTENCE_CONTEXT_NAME)
    private EntityManager       em;

    @Inject
    private SessionFacadeBean   sessionBean;

    @POST
    @Path("/create/item")
    @ValidateRequest
    public ComponentShortSummary addItem(@Form NewItemForm itemForm)
    {       
        if(sessionBean.getLock()) {
            try {
                if(itemForm.getName().equals("INVALID") == true) {
                    throw new ConstraintViolationException("Failed", new HashSet<ConstraintViolation<?>>());
                }

                ChildOne child = new ChildOne(itemForm.getName(), sessionBean.getSessionData());
                em.persist(child);
                return null;
            }
            finally {
                sessionBean.clearLock();
            }
        } else {
            return null;
        }
    }
}
 To reproduce the problem, I perform the following sequence: Call addItem with a valid name (this persists the item to the database). Call addItem with a name INVALID, this throws the constraint exception. Call addItem with a valid name (this results in a detached entity error on the line em.persist(child). What I dont understand is how/why Im ending up with detached entities. In the real code, I would be performing some request / state validation, before modifying the state (so there is no reason that I can see for the state to have been detached). If I remove the call to sessionBean.getLock() then the problem goes away (the objects persist correctly). The purpose of the lock methods is essentially to serialize access to the session state, however currently the getLock() method is empty, it feels like the problem might be related to the fact that Im calling into the stateful bean before throwing the exception. Can anybody explain whats going on that results in my entities becoming detached / if there is a way to avoid it (and ideally point me at any documentation that supports the explanation)? Whilst there are probably ways that I can work around the current issue, performing validation before accessing the stateful bean at all, Im concerned about the general case (where any exception is thrown after the stateful bean has been accessed in the call). Is there an accepted strategy for dealing with exceptions when I dont want the entities from the extended persistent context to be detached?

The problem is that if you add more blur it doesnt appear anymore, as its too blur. the other two properties dont help too much, as I want the glow to begin from the middle. Lets work out this together and see how we can do with CSS a wide and high glow effect.
@CODE:<a> #projectBox a:LINK{
    background-image: url('../_img/showcase/projectTabs/link.png');
}

#projectBox a:HOVER{
    background-image: url('../_img/showcase/projectTabs/link.png');

@TITLE:Starting up embedded jetty server for a JAR file
@CONTENT:What I am trying to do, is to build an executable JAR file which will contain my project. I have included its dependencies right next to it, also in JAR files, so my directory listing looks something like this: ~/Projects/Java/web-app/out: web-app.jar dependency1.jar dependency2.jar dependency3.jar I know and am sure that my problem does not arise from dependencies, as my application functions properly, right up to the moment I start up Jetty embedded. The code I use to start Jetty is like this: public class ServerExecutionGoal implements ExecutionGoal {    

    private final static Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(ServerExecutionGoal.class);    

    private WebAppContext getWebAppContext() throws IOException {    
        WebAppContext context = new WebAppContext();    
        System.out.println("context = " + context);    
        context.setResourceBase(new PathMatchingResourcePatternResolver().getResource("classpath:/webapp").getURL().toExternalForm());    
        context.setContextPath("/");    
        context.setLogger(new StdErrLog());    
        return context;    
    }    

    @Override    
    public void execute(Map<String, Object> stringObjectMap) throws ExecutionTargetFailureException {    
        logger.info("Instantiating target server ...");    
        final Server server = new Server(8089);    
        final ContextHandlerCollection handlerCollection = new ContextHandlerCollection();    
        try {    
            handlerCollection.setHandlers(new Handler[]{new RequestLogHandler(), getWebAppContext()});    
        } catch (IOException e) {    
            throw new ExecutionTargetFailureException("Could not create web application context", e);    
        }    
        server.setHandler(handlerCollection);    
        try {    
            logger.info("Starting server on port 8089 ...");    
            server.start();    
            server.join();    
            logger.info("Server started. Waiting for requests.");    
        } catch (Exception e) {    
            throw new ExecutionTargetFailureException("Failed to properly start the web server", e);    
        }    
    }    

    public static void main(String[] args) throws ExecutionTargetFailureException {    
        new ServerExecutionGoal().execute(null);    
    }    

}    
 I can validate that the "webapp" folder gets relocated correctly inside my JAR to /webapp, and that when running the code through my IDE (IntelliJ IDEA 11) context.setResourceBase(new PathMatchingResourcePatternResolver().getResource("classpath:/webapp").getURL().toExternalForm()) maps validly to the resource in question. Also, I can show that it resolves to something like: jar:file:~/Projects/Java/web-app/out/web-app.jar!/webapp
 and is accessible (I read it). However, when I start my application's main method, and Jetty starts, on http://localhost:8089 I get the following: HTTP ERROR: 503 Problem accessing /. Reason: Service Unavailable
 Powered by Jetty:// Where am I going wrong? I know that by setting "resourceBase" to "." the address "http://localhost:8089" will act as an interface to the location "~/Projects/Java/web-app/out/" where I can see a listing of all the JAR files, including the "web-app.jar", upon clicking on which I am offered to download it. I have seen the following questions, and the answers do not apply: Embedded jetty application not working from jar: I get NullPointerException since Start.class.getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource() resolves to null. Embedded Jetty WebAppContext FilePermission issue: which not only isn't answered, but the situation clearly does not apply, as I do not have permission issues (the fact that I can get a file listing should prove that). embedding jetty server problems: also unanswered, also not applicable as I don't have any dependency problems (as pointed out previously in my comments above). I think that I should somehow enable Jetty to access the /webapp folder, which is located under my src/main/resources/ directory and is bundled into my web application. Should I be forsaking a bundled web application and deploy the exploded context path to somewhere accessible by Jetty instead (this is not desirable at all as it poses a multitude of issues for me and my clients).

@LINK:/questions/12672541/reading-xml-value-to-populate-java-variable
@TITLE:Reading XML value to populate Java variable
@CONTENT:I am working with xstream to convert some XML into Java objects. The XML pattern is of the below format: <Objects>   
<Object Type="System.Tuning" >4456</Object> 
<Object Type="System.Lag" >7789</Object>    
</Objects>
 Basically the parent Objects tag can have n number of Object tags. For this I have modelled my class like this: class ParentResponseObject {    
    List <ResponseObject>responseObjects = new ArrayList<ResponseObject>();
    public ParentResponseObject() {
        // TODO Auto-generated constructor stub
    }
}
class ResponseObject {
       String Type;
       String Value;
    public ResponseObject() {

    }
}
 And finally I am using the below code to populate my java class: XStream s = new XStream(new DomDriver());
  s.alias("Objects", src.core.PowerShell.MyAgain.ParentResponseObject.class);
  s.alias("Object", src.core.PowerShell.MyAgain.ResponseObject.class);  
  s.useAttributeFor(src.core.PowerShell.MyAgain.ResponseObject.class, "Type");  
        s.addImplicitCollection(src.core.PowerShell.MyAgain.ParentResponseObject.class, "responseObjects");     
        ParentResponseObject gh =(ParentResponseObject)s.fromXML(k1);
 Using the useAttribute method I am able to read the "Type" attribute of Object Type, but how do I read the values within tags like 4456, 7789 and populate it in the variable ResponseObject.value.
@CODE:<Objects>   
<Object Type="System.Tuning" >4456</Object> 
<Object Type="System.Lag" >7789</Object>    
</Objects> class ParentResponseObject {

    public ParentResponseObject() {

class ResponseObject {

       String Value;
    public ResponseObject() {

    }
} XStream s = new XStream(new DomDriver());

        s.addImplicitCollection(src.core.PowerShell.MyAgain.ParentResponseObject.class, "responseObjects");

@LINK:/questions/12668151/understanding-replaygain
@TITLE:understanding ReplayGain
@CONTENT:I'm trying to implement ReplayGain. The specification is here. Here or here is an existing implementation (actually, all implementations I have found anywhere seem to be derived from this code, e.g. mp3gain, r128gain, flac replaygain, ...). I think I understand the Yulewalk filter and the Butterworth filter. As well as how to calculate the RMS. The section about the statistical processing stays a bit unclear to me, esp. what exactly is meant by The value which most accurately matches human perception of perceived loudness is 95% From the above implementation, it becomes a bit more clear. But either I am getting something wrong or the implementation is buggy. There is the formular val = STEPS_per_dB * 10. * log10 ( (lsum+rsum) / totsamp * 0.5 + 1.e-37 ). (lsum+rsum) / totsamp * 0.5 should always be in [0,1] (this should be the mean average of the squared values which are all in [0,1]). So, it seems to me that this is always <0. But from the upcoming code, this doesn't make sense. Edit: I was wrong. All the samples were not in (float)[-1,1] as I thought but in (float)[-0x8000,0x7fff], i.e. just the direct sint16->float conversion. I got this from the implementation; I don't really see where this is explicitly said in the spec. Also, the formulas, while they give numbers which make more sense, seem more made up. At least I don't see where the formula is coming from. Can someone explain? For clearance, the 10. * log10( (lsum+rsum) / totsamp * 0.5 + 1.e-37) is actually (mostly) the same as 20. * log10(rms). This is similar to what you see in the spec but not quite because of the L_{p-p}. In the spec: L = 20 * log10( 2 * rms / L_{p-p} ) What exactly is this L_{p?p} (the maximum peak-to-peak range of the samples in the audio file)? In the implementation, it seems to be 2 (otherwise you wont get 20. * log10(rms)). Initially I thought this the len of the range where the samples are in (if that would be [-1,1], this is 2) but I was wrong there, so this can't be it. Then, also in the code, there is the constant #define PINK_REF 64.82       /* 298640883795 */ /* calibration value for 89dB */
 Where is this value coming from? Edit: My current implementation: here
@CODE:val = STEPS_per_dB * 10. * log10 ( (lsum+rsum) / totsamp * 0.5 + 1.e-37 ) (lsum+rsum) / totsamp * 0.5 10. * log10( (lsum+rsum) / totsamp * 0.5 + 1.e-37) 20. * log10(rms) L_{p-p} L = 20 * log10( 2 * rms / L_{p-p} ) L_{p?p} 20. * log10(rms) #define PINK_REF 64.82       /* 298640883795 */ /* calibration value for 89dB */

@CONTENT:I've got an Android project that has multiple modules. These are all Git submodules, and several of them are packaged with the same jars (android support v4, Guice, Roboguice, etc.). My main project also has these same dependencies, so I've got three copies of these jars, one in my project, and one in each of two submodules. When I build, it fails at the dex stage, complaining that certain classes have already been added. I can hack around this, by getting rid of the jars from all the modules, except one, then pointing the dependencies to that location, but it just feels so dirty. There's got to be a better way. Any suggestions?

@TITLE:insertItemsAtIndexPaths Update Error
@CONTENT:In UICollectionView, I am trying to use performBatchUpdates:completion to perform updates to my grid view. My data source array is self.results. Here's my code: dispatch_sync(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{

            [self.collectionView performBatchUpdates:^{

                int resultsSize = [self.results count];
                [self.results addObjectsFromArray:newData];

                NSMutableArray *arrayWithIndexPaths = [NSMutableArray array];

                    [arrayWithIndexPaths addObject:[NSIndexPath indexPathForRow:0 inSection:0]];
                }

                else {
                    for (int i = 0; i < resultsSize; i++) {
                        [arrayWithIndexPaths addObject:[NSIndexPath indexPathForRow:resultsSize + i inSection:0]];
                    }

                    [self.collectionView insertItemsAtIndexPaths:arrayWithIndexPaths];

            } completion:nil];
 Explanation of what I have / what I'm doing: This code runs fine when the initial insertion into the collection view is done. However, when I add/insert more data into my collection view (by updating self.results and calling this), this gives the following error: * Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInternalInconsistencyException', reason: 'Invalid update: invalid number of items in section 0. The number of items contained in an existing section after the update (8) must be equal to the number of items contained in that section before the update (4), plus or minus the number of items inserted or deleted from that section (32 inserted, 0 deleted) and plus or minus the number of items moved into or out of that section (0 moved in, 0 moved out).' I understand this means that the data source wasn't updated properly. However, when querying my self.results array, I see the new count of the data. I am doing that on the first line using addObjectsFromArray. I also stored the old results size in resultsSize. I use that variable to add the newly added index paths into arrayWithIndexPaths. Now when adding/inserting items, I tried the following for-loops: for (id obj in self.results) which is what I am using now. It works initially but further inserts crashes. for (UIImage *image in newData) works as well initially but further inserts crash. From the name of the function, I believe that insertItemsAtIndexPaths will insert all items at those index paths without a loop. However, without a loop, the app crashes when it initially tries to populate the data. I also tried looping from resultsSize + 1 until the new self.results count (which contains the new data) and that also crashes at the initial update. Any suggestions about what I'm doing wrong? Thank you,
@CODE:performBatchUpdates:completion self.results dispatch_sync(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{

@TITLE:Differentiating division from regex when lexing gawk code
@CONTENT:I am writing a flex parser for gawk scripts. I am running into a problem differentiating between uses for a forward slash (/) character. Obviously, a single / would be an operator for division, but two slashes could be both a regular expression or division. Right now, it parses int((r-1)/3)*3+int((c-1)/3)+1
 as having the regular expression /3)*3+int((c-1)/
 instead of the intended division operations. How do I get flex to recognize it as a mathematical expression? Right now, this is my flex regular expression to recognize regular expressions in gawk: EXT_REG_EXP "\/"("\\\/"|[^\/\n])*"\/"
 and the division operator should be caught by my list of operators: OPERATOR "+"|"-"|"*"|"/"|"%"|"^"|"!"|">"|"<"|"|"|"?"|":"|"~"|"$"|"="
 But since the flex regular expressions are greedy I guess it treats two divisions as a regular expression.

@TITLE:Play 2: idiomatic approach to binding a form to List[Model]
@CONTENT:I have several CRUD operations to perform, each one on a collection of models (e.g. game schedule, team roster, game result, game stats, etc.). Up to this point in my Play experience (just a few months, 1 project live) I have been working with one-to-one form binding to model instance. I know I can numerically index form field names, but then how to bind the posted form to List[Model]? This is what my one-to-one binding looks like: // abstract away bindFromRequest to make binding more concise in controllers
def bindForm[T](f: play.api.data.Form[T])(implicit r: play.api.mvc.Request[_]) =
  f.bindFromRequest fold(e=> Left(e.errorsAsJson), Right(_))
 and then in controllers: val result = for {
  model <- bindForm(form).right
  id    <- dao.create(model) as json
} yield id
 what I would like to do is the same, but instead of model binding returning a single Model on success, have it return a List[Model], and pass on to overloaded DAO create/edit/delete operations. I see that there is a list method that one can use as part of a Form mapping, but I have a feeling that that would wreak havoc with my JDBC query wrapper (ScalaQuery/Slick), whose case class/companion object mapping would likely not play well with collections properties. For example, existing mapping of a game schedule looks like: object CompositeForm {
  import play.api.data.{Form, Forms}, Forms._
  import utils.Validator.Bindings.jodaLocalTimeFormat
  val mapper = mapping(
    'id   -> ignored(0),
    'gameDate -> jodaDate,
    'gameType -> optional(text),
    'location -> optional(text),
    'team1    -> number,
    'team2    -> number
  )(Composite.apply)(Composite.unapply)
  val form = Form( mapper )
}
 using list(gameDate), list(gameType) instead then means that form binding will return a single Composite instance whose properties are all collections -- maybe it will work, but doesn't seem nearly as clean/straightforward as working with a collection of model instances. Ideas appreciated ;-)

The scope of the label is the expression being read by the outermost call to read; within this expression, the same label may not appear twice.

Without the selection (null) it reads out all calendars, but I just want one. A query looks like this: public final Cursor query (Uri uri, String[] projection, String selection, String[] selectionArgs, String sortOrder) 
 selection: A filter declaring which rows to return, formatted as an SQL WHERE clause (excluding the WHERE itself). Passing null will return all rows for the given URI. This code is the first try with a selection:             Uri.Builder builder = Instances.CONTENT_URI.buildUpon();
            ContentUris.appendId(builder, now - DateUtils.DAY_IN_MILLIS);

      REAL*8 A,B,C
      INTEGER NCORES, CHUNK, TID

 Note: There are no parallel directives in the main program that calls the routine The arrays A,B,C are initialized serially in the main program. A is initialized to zeros I am enforcing the Fortran fixed source form during compilation I have confirmed the following: Another example program works fine with 8 threads (so no hardware issue) I have used the -openmp compiler argument OMP_GET_NUM_PROCS() and OMP_GET_MAX_THREADS() both return 0 TID is 0 for every iteration over I (which shouldn't be the case) I am unable to diagnose my mistake. I'd appreciate any inputs on this.

@TITLE:What is the easiest way to create a simple COM object in VS2010 using native/C++ code?
@CONTENT:This is a followon to a prior question I posted (see here). I'm trying to call my native/C++ code from Javascript running in an HTML page. The answer in the referenced question was to create a COM object. The Javascript can then create an instance of the COM object and invoke methods on it getting to the native/C++ code. So now I'm left with trying to create a simple COM object to accept the call from the Javascript. It looks like the way to go is to create a DLL and put the COM object in that DLL. Years ago I did tons of reading on COM and have tried to forget it since then :) Now I'm getting a headache wondering how to go about this easily without becoming an expert in COM. Is there a simple/easy way to setup a DLL with a COM object that you would recommend? EDIT: My application is written using native C++/Win32/MFC. I have an MFC dialog which uses the IE ActiveX browser control to render locally generated HTML. Currently the button handler code is all in Javascript, but as you can see from the referenced question, my goal is to handle it on the C++ side.

@LINK:/questions/12644140/deselecting-comboboxitems-in-mvvm
@TITLE:Deselecting ComboBoxItems in MVVM
@CONTENT:I am using a standard wpf/mvvm application where i bind combo boxes to collections on a ViewModel. I need to be able to de-select an item from the dropdown. Meaning, users should be able to select something, and later decide that they want to un-select it (select none) for it. the problem is that there are no empty elements in my bound collection my initial thought was simply to insert a new item in the collection which would result having an empty item on top of the collection. this is a hack though, and it affects all code that uses that collection on the view model. for example if someone was to write _myCollection.Frist(o => o.Name == "foo") 
 this will throw a null reference exception. possible workaround is: _myCollection.Where(o => o != null).First(o => o.Name == "foo");
 this will work, but no way to ensure any future uses of that collection won't cause any breaks. what's a good pattern / solution for being able to adding an empty item so the user can de-select. (I am also aware of CollectionView structure, but that seems like a overkill for something so simple) Update went with @hbarck suggestion and implemented CompositeCollection (quick proof of concept)     public CompositeCollection MyObjects {
        get {
            var col = new CompositeCollection();

            var cc1 = new CollectionContainer();
            cc1.Collection = _actualCollection;

            var cc2 = new CollectionContainer();
            cc2.Collection = new List<MyObject>() { null }; // PROBLEM

            col.Add(cc2);
            col.Add(cc1);
            return col;
        }
    }
 this code work with existing bindings (including SelectedItem) which is great. One problem with this is, that if the item is completely null, the SelectedItem setter is never called upon selecting it. if i modify that one line to this:             cc2.Collection = new List<MyObject>() { new MyObject() }; // PROBLEM
 the setter is called, but now my selected item is just a basic initialized class instead of null.. i could add some code in the setter to check/reset, but that's not good.
@CODE:_myCollection.Frist(o => o.Name == "foo") _myCollection.Where(o => o != null).First(o => o.Name == "foo"); public CompositeCollection MyObjects {
        get {
            var col = new CompositeCollection();

            var cc1 = new CollectionContainer();
            cc1.Collection = _actualCollection;

            var cc2 = new CollectionContainer();
            cc2.Collection = new List<MyObject>() { null }; // PROBLEM

            col.Add(cc2);
            col.Add(cc1);
            return col;
        }
    } cc2.Collection = new List<MyObject>() { new MyObject() }; // PROBLEM

@LINK:/questions/12643065/jquery-deferred-adding-a-callback-to-the-deferred-contract
@TITLE:jQuery Deferred - Adding a callback to the Deferred contract
@CONTENT:I'm trying to add another asynchronous call to the contract of an existing Deferred before its state is set to success. Rather than try and explain this in English, see the following pseudo-code: $.when(
    $.ajax({        
        url: someUrl,
        data: data,
        async: true,        
        success: function (data, textStatus, jqXhr) {
            console.log('Call 1 done.')
            jqXhr.pipe(
                $.ajax({        
                    url: someUrl,
                    data: data,
                    async: true,        
                    success: function (data, textStatus, jqXhr) {
                        console.log('Call 2 done.');
                    },       
                })
            );
        },       
    }),
    $.ajax({        
        url: someUrl,
        data: data,
        async: true,        
        success: function (data, textStatus, jqXhr) {
            console.log('Call 3 done.');
        },       
    })
).then(function(){ console.log('All done!'); });
 Basically, Call 2 is dependent on the results of Call 1. I want Call 1 and Call 3 to be executed in parallel. Once all 3 calls are complete, I want the All Done code to execute. My understanding is that Deferred.pipe() is supposed to chain another asynchronous call to the given deferred, but in practice, I always get Call 2 completing after All Done. Does anyone know how to get jQuery's Deferred to do what I want? Hopefully the solution doesn't involve ripping the code apart into chunks any further. Thanks for any help. UPDATE: Please see my follow up question.
@CODE:$.when(
    $.ajax({

@TITLE:How to use org.apache.felix.scr annotations for a bundle from scratch?
@CONTENT:I've started developing a bundle for apache felix and did so with the ops4j pax plugin. I've created the project structure with pax-create-project and in there did the normal pax-create-bundle. Then you get the initial project structure for building the whole thing with maven. The important part here is, that your bundle has it's own pom (bundlename/pom.xml) and bnd file (bundlename/osgi.bnd) but the configuration for maven-bundle-plugin is already provided under poms/compiled/pom.xml. The bundle metadata is configured under poms/compiled/pom.xml but the standard activator is configured under the above mentioned osgi.bnd file. The default in the bnd file is Bundle-Activator: ${bundle.namespace}.internal.ExampleActivator. Now I wanted to start using annotations from org.apache.felix.scr so I included this in the bundles own pom under dependencies: <dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.felix</groupId>
  <artifactId>org.apache.felix.scr</artifactId>
  <version>1.6.0</version>
</dependency>
 And I created my interface for the service: package namespace;

public interface Sample {
  void sayHello();
}
 As well as the implementation with the annotations from org.apache.felix.scr: package namespace.internal;

import org.apache.felix.scr.annotations.Activate;
import org.apache.felix.scr.annotations.Component;
import org.apache.felix.scr.annotations.Deactivate;
import namespace.Sample;

@Component
@Service
public class SampleImpl implements Sample{

  @Activate
  void start(){
    System.out.println("Started SampleImpl.");
  }

  @Deactivate
  void stop(){
    System.out.println("Stopped SampleImpl.");
  }

  @Override
  public void sayHello() {
    System.out.println("Hello!");
  }
}
 What do I need to place in the osgi.bnd file in order to start the components? I had to remove the default entry mentioned above because I`m not using the BundleActivator any more. Now here is the question: What do I need to do to any of the above mentioned files in order to let the mvn clean install pax:provision start up a felix environment that starts my bundle and let me see any of the printouts? I have already looked at the log output of the Apache Log Service which I'm starting too and it just tells me: 2012.09.28 16:52:44 INFO - Bundle: namespace - BundleEvent STARTED
2012.09.28 16:52:44 INFO - Bundle: namespace - BundleEvent RESOLVED
 Any hints are very well appreciated. Or links, I've searched for more then hours to find a complete guide to use the maven plugins for scr and bundle together. Greetings, Kjellski

@TITLE:How to get the last index of a char in a string?
@CONTENT:I have the following task: There is an xml element containing a long string. I need to use xsl to transform this element into a number of html <input> tags. It works like this: if the string is longer than an <input> field can hold without scrolling I call the same template recursively to create another input field with the remainig text. The problem is that the string is often splitted right in the middle of the word which is not nice. So I need to find the position of the last space character that is not bigger than the size of the substring that fits into the <input> tag and print only the substring before it on the line. So I prepare a substring of max length, that can fit in the field, but I have no idea of how to get the index of the last space in it and pass it as a parameter into the next call of the function. UPD: here is what I've got so far <xsl:template name="multilineInput">

@TITLE:Knowing if a previous handler for an event returned false. defaultPrevented in IE < 9?
@CONTENT:I've put a global modal "Loading, please wait" <div> in an application. It is showing every time an <a> or <input type="button"> is clicked. This is achieved by assigning the <body> an onclick event handler in onload, so that it gets executed when the event bubbles up: <body onload="setup()">
    <!-- No control over what will be here -->
</body>

<script>
function setup() {
    document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0].onclick = clickFunc;
}
function clickFunc(eventData) {
    var clickedElement = (window.event) ? event.srcElement : eventData.target;
    if (someConditions) { 
        document.getElementById('modal').style.display = "block";
    }
}
</script>
 Now, I've got some components in the markup (over which I have no control) that do return false in their onclicks. That's causing the modal popup to show and just stay there when there's a confirm() and the user denies. Probably the proper way of dealing with this would have been preventDefault(), so that the event wouldn't bubble up, as explained in event.preventDefault() vs. return false. But I don't have control over that part, so: Is there a way (preferrably non-jquery+cross-browser) to know the result of previous executions of the event handler (at lower levels) ? If there isn't I guess I'll just have to refrain from showing the modal <div> whenever the component's onclick contains return false. Here is a JSFiddle for testing. UPDATE Bergi's answer below is what I was searching for. However, defaultPrevented doesn't seem to be supported in IE < 9. Is there an equivalent/workaround to achieve that in IE < 9?
@CODE:<div> <a> <input type="button"> <body> onclick onload <body onload="setup()">
    <!-- No control over what will be here -->
</body>

<script>
function setup() {
    document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0].onclick = clickFunc;
}
function clickFunc(eventData) {
    var clickedElement = (window.event) ? event.srcElement : eventData.target;
    if (someConditions) { 
        document.getElementById('modal').style.display = "block";
    }
}
</script> return false onclick confirm() preventDefault() <div> onclick return false defaultPrevented clickedElement.onclick.toString().indexOf('return false') != -1 someConditions <a> return false onclick onclick false defaultPrevented

@CONTENT:I am not knowing anything about gamecentre.I am working on the COCO application I had gone through gamecenter guide and get able to integrate the game center in my application. 1) Now the i am able enter the score in the gamecentre through my application. By doing this:- - (void) reportScore: (int64_t) score forCategory: (NSString*) category 
{
    GKScore *scoreReporter = [[[GKScore alloc] initWithCategory:category] autorelease]; 
    scoreReporter.value = score;

 But i dont know why but delegate method of GKMatchmakerViewController is not called i had set the delegate but still and even i ama not able to get GKMATCH (here currentMatch). So due to this [currentMatch sendDataToAllPlayers: data withDataMode: GKMatchSendDataUnreliable error:&error]; this method is not working. as CurrentMatch refrence is 0X0. Please help me out.How do i send and recive data. M i doing anything wrong?OR is there any thing else to be done. Please help me. Thanks

 I create the array that should populate the table in my viewDidLoad with: _videos = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];
 Then I connect to the url and parse through the received xml data. This works just like it should. When a certain tag is opened I create my video objects and after filling them with data I add those objects to my array with: [_videos addObject:currentVideo];
 This seems to work as well, because it returns the correct number of videos when - (NSInteger)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView numberOfRowsInSection:(NSInteger)section {

    return _videos.count;
}
 is called. But after this point the app crashes and I don't even reach the point where I try to populate my table view. The function looks like this: - (UITableViewCell *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath {

    Video *curVideo = [_videos objectAtIndex:indexPath.row];

    static NSString *CellIdentifier = @"CustomCell";

    CustomCell *cell = [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:CellIdentifier];

    if (cell == nil)        
        cell = [[CustomCell alloc] initWithStyle:UITableViewCellStyleSubtitle reuseIdentifier:CellIdentifier];

    cell.titleLabel.text = [curVideo title];
    cell.descLabel.text = [curVideo desc];

    return cell;
}
 What am doing wrong? Thanks in advance

 I now select a mask in the ListBox, then all the indexlines are displyed in the DataGrid. Everything fine so far. When I know select a DataSource from the ComboBox, it won't be stored into the Indexline object. (Cause when I swich the mask, and then switch back, the selection is gone. Also when I use the debugger, I can see the SelectedDatasource of the Masks are all null) Question What's the cause of this behaviour? What do I need change to get the expected one? Can someone suggest a better title? I feel like the current one is not very helpful :(

@TITLE:OWL Ontology (giving property restrictions)
@CONTENT:I am currently working on the OWL Ontology I have a question in regard to property. To be frankly saying, I don't really see the importance of giving a property restriction to class. For example, Product (class) has manufacturer (property) some Manufacturer. In this case this means that one product has at least one manufacturer. However, then why not just do object property assertions by a plastic model (an individual of the product) has manufacturer (object property) DOCOMO (an instance of the manufacturer) ? Do I have to do both? enve if I don't do the first thing, the reasoner says there is no problem. Why Do i have to do both?

@TITLE:Why do my Gradle tests run repeatedly?
@CONTENT:I have a pretty standard Gradle build that's building a Java project. When I run it for the first time, it compiles everything and runs the tests. When I run it a second time without changing any files, it runs the tests again. According to this thread, Gradle is supposed to be lazy by defaut and not bother running tests if nothing has changed. Has the default behaviour here been changed? EDIT: If I run gradle test repeatedly, the tests only run the first time and are subsequently skipped. However, if I run gradle build repeatedly, the tests get re-run every time, even though all other tasks are marked as up-to-date.

@TITLE:Dynamically invoking WCF service
@CONTENT:I've created ASP.NET application and added simple WCF service to it. The ASP.NET application is host for WCF service. The service is running. The service looks as follows: [ServiceContract]
public interface IService1
{
    [OperationContract]
    string DoWork(string text);
}

public class Service1 : IService1
{
    public string DoWork(string text)
    {
        return text.ToUpper();
    }
}
 On the client side is console application that should invoke WCF service dynamically. I use following code: WSHttpBinding binding = new WSHttpBinding(SecurityMode.None);
IChannelFactory<IRequestChannel> factory = binding.BuildChannelFactory<IRequestChannel>(
   new BindingParameterCollection());
factory.Open();

EndpointAddress address = new EndpointAddress("http://localhost:3929/Service1.svc");
IRequestChannel irc = factory.CreateChannel(address);
using (irc as IDisposable)
{
    irc.Open();

    XmlReader reader = XmlReader.Create(new StringReader(
        @"<DoWork xmlns='http://tempuri.org/'>
        <composite xmlns:a='http://www.w3.org/2005/08/addressing' 
        xmlns:i='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance'>
        <a:StringValue>aaaa</a:StringValue>
        </composite>
        </DoWork>"));

    Message m = Message.CreateMessage(MessageVersion.Soap12,  
                "http://tempuri.org/IService1/DoWork", reader);

    Message ret = irc.Request(m);
    reader.Close();

    Console.WriteLine(ret);
}

//close the factory
factory.Close();
 But, it crashes at this line: Message ret = irc.Request(m);
 with following error: The message version of the outgoing message (Soap12 (http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope) AddressingNone (http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2005/05/addressing/none)) does not match that of the encoder (Soap12 (http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope) Addressing10 (http://www.w3.org/2005/08/addressing)). Make sure the binding is configured with the same version as the message. Does anybody know what I'm doing wrong? Thank you in advance.

@TITLE:Is there a performance advantage in writing a long file sequentially using MappedByteBuffer over a plain FileChannel?
@CONTENT:I am trying to understand what would be the difference between calling FileChannel.write in short successions with a 16k buffer AND mapping multiple ByteBuffers with an append size of 16k as described here: http://stackoverflow.com/a/7367952/962872 I would think that the mapped bytebuffer approach produces a lot of garbage as you discard the MappedByteBuffers after each append. And I am not sure it is faster either. And you still have to do a bunch of mapping operations... (one per append). Or perhaps you should map a huge ByteBuffer (as big as possible) and just keep writing to this MappedByteBuffer? I am using the FileChannel.write approach with a Java-side 16kb buffer as a "fast" way to write a file but I want to make sure I am not missing something faster/better. Can anyone shed a light?

@TITLE:Spring - How to pass a message between Views?
@CONTENT:I have an application that displays, edits and deletes Accounts. Display uses displayAccounts.jsp and is invoked by /accounts url Edit uses editAccount.jsp and is invoked by /accounts/{id}/edit where id is the Primary Key to the Account to be edited. Delete does not have a view of it's own, but simply calls the @RequestMapping method in the Controller, and is invoked by /accounts/{id}/delete Every action, on success, redirects to the Display page. Once an operation (Edit/Delete) has been successfully performed, I want to send a success message that can be displayed on the Display page. How can I accomplish this? Since I dont have a view for the Delete operation, I want to display the Errors in the Display page too. Please help. Thanks in advance.

@TITLE:Android camara parameters getZoomRatio() values not as expected
@CONTENT:if i get a list of zoom ratios with: parameters.getZoomRatios(), values returned are 100,114...200 (corresponeding to 1x 1.14x ...2.0x zoom), but in the camera preview at 200 (2x zoom), the picture appears zoomed much more then 2x. in sample images, show a 6cm fov at 1x and 2.5cm at 2x zoom... I was expecting 3.0cm at 2x. Is there another way i should be interpreting these values?...Anyone else see this? or is this device/version specific, or should i be multiplying by some constant or other value (focal length)? i'm trying to match my camera view to rendered view for my app, and as i zoom, this is messing up the matching. code is standard here: public void setZoom(int pZoom)

Would it be preferable to have a table as follows ? id_employee int date_event datetime event_type varchar, values can be CHECKIN or CHECKOUT. To determine if an employee has already checked in all I have to is check if the last record for a given employee has an event_type of CHECKIN. Also, fetching a record and updating it is no longer necessary. Is the second approach better ? Or do you have other suggestions ?

@LINK:/questions/12631674/consistent-indexing-for-objects-with-variable-attributes-in-zodb
@TITLE:Consistent indexing for objects with variable attributes in ZODB
@CONTENT:I have a ZODB installation where I have to organize several million objects of about a handful of different types. I have a generic container class Table, which contains BTrees to index objects by attributes or combinations of these attributes. Data consistency is quite essential, and so I want to enforce, that the indices are automatically updated, when I write to any of the attributes, which are covered by the indexing. So a simple obj.a = x should be sufficient to calculate all new dependent index entries, check if there are any collisions, and finally write the indices and the value. In general, I'd be happy to use a library for that, so I was looking at repoze.catalog and IndexedCatalog, but was not really happy with that. IndexedCatalog seems dead for quite a while, and not providing the kind of consistency for changes to the objects. repoze.catalog seems to be more used and active, but also not providing this kind of consistency, as far as I understand. If I missed something here, I'd love to hear about it and prefer reusing over reinventing. So, how I see it besides trying to find a library for the problem, I'd have to intercept the write access to the dataobject attributes with descriptors and let the Table class do the magic of changing the indices. For that, the descriptor instances have to know, with which Table instances they have to talk with. The current implementation goes someting like that: class DatabaseElement(Persistent):
    name = Property(constant_parameters)
    ...

class Property(object):
    ...
    def __set__(self, obj, name, val):
        val = self.check_value(val)
        setattr(obj, '_' + name, val)
 When these DatabaseElement classes are generated, the database and the objects within are not yet created. So as mentioned in this nice answer, I'd probably have to create some singleton lookup mechanism, to find the Table objects, without handing them to Property as an instantiation argument. Is there a more elegant way? Persisting the descriptors itself? Any suggestions and best-practice examples welcome!
@CODE:Table obj.a = x Table Table class DatabaseElement(Persistent):
    name = Property(constant_parameters)
    ...

class Property(object):
    ...
    def __set__(self, obj, name, val):
        val = self.check_value(val)

 I am so stuck on this it's not even funny. I am trying to write it in a simple functional way with recursive lambdas, to make my code prettier. I want myzip like this because i want to use its output with another function I wrote which maps a function to a tree def tree_map(func, tree):
    return map(lambda x: func(x) if not isinstance(x, list) else tree_map(func, x), 
               tree)
 I have been trying to do something similar to this with zip, but I can't seem to wrap my head around it. Does anyone have any ideas on how i could write myzip? Edit: Look at tree_map! isn't that pretty! i think so at least, but my mother tongue is Scheme :P and also, I want myzip to go as deep as it needs to. basically, I want myzip to retain the structure of the trees i pass it. Also, myzip will only handle trees that are the same shape.

@LINK:/questions/12628683/json-is-invalid-jsonview-but-i-dont-see-how
@TITLE:JSON is invalid (JSONview), but I don't see how
@CONTENT:OK, I've been going nuts with this. I'm outputting a JSON from PHP, and the JSON View extension, for both Chrome and Firefox, is claiming it's invalid. Both extensions work correctly on JSON View's example, so it seems likely that there actually is something wrong with my JSON V but I have no idea what. The Firefox version has an error message: There was an error parsing the JSON document. The document may not be well-formed.
 The Chrome version lacks such error messages, but still prints the JSON as plaintext. I am setting the header, like so: header('Content-Type: application/json'); I've checked the response header in Firebug and Chrome's development tools; it is correctly set in both cases. Removing that hides the error message in the Firefox version and the plaintext is not in a monospace font, but that's it.

 I've gone through many variations on the JSON itself, but I can't imagine that it's the JSON's problem when something as simple as this: {"session":"expired"}
 is still failing. I've checked repeatedly; that is literally the entirety of the server's response, but JSON View still complains. For more complicated JSONs, I've been using echo json_encode($output, JSON_PRETTY_PRINT);
 where $output is an associative array; the output looks completely right but JSON View is still complaining. This is the only echo in the file that isn't commented out. So what on earth could be going wrong here? I really need JSON View; I work with very large JSONs constantly and the ability to collapse and expand objects and arrays is critical to debugging my application. This online JSON viewer seems to work, but my productivity is going to take a hit if I have to copy and paste the output of these PHP files every time I'm testing them. EDIT: One thing I have found that works is if I do this: <?php
    header('Content-Type: application/json');
    die('{"debug":true}');
    // remainder of the program as-is, starting with...
    require('dbinfo.php');
 If I then go with this: <?php
    header('Content-Type: application/json');
    require('dbinfo.php'); // note this comes before the die statement
    die('{"debug":true}');
    // remainder of the program as-is
 I get the error again. So this implies that dbinfo.php is causing the problem. EDIT: Sorry, I've removed dbinfo.php from this question because it might possibly contain sensitive data that should not be public (even though I stripped out the obvious things). Since the content of dbinfo.php wasn't relevant, it just seems safer to remove it. See my answer below.

I found this post and downloaded the HTMLAgilityPack, however when he says 1) and build the HTMLAgilityPack solution. 2) In your application, add a reference to HTMLAgilityPack.dll in the HTMLAgilityPack\Debug (or Realease) \bin folder. I do not know what he wants me to do. So far, I have downloaded and extracted the HTMLAgilityPack folder. In the folder, I have the files: Net20, Net40, Net40-client, Net45, sl3-wp, sl4, sl4-windowsphone71, sl5, winrt45 If anybody can elaborate on what procedures I need to do, it would be greatly appreciated!

@CONTENT:Related question: Stop jQuery .data() from converting According to the documentation for .data(): Every attempt is made to convert the string to a JavaScript value (this includes booleans, numbers, objects, arrays, and null) otherwise it is left as a string. To retrieve the value's attribute as a string without any attempt to convert it, use the attr() method This is true for jQuery 1.7.2, but 1.8.2 does not do the conversion. Is this the new expected behavior? For example, with the HTML <div data-code-name="007">Bond, James</div> jQuery v1.7.2 $("div").data("codeName") returns 7 Example: http://jsfiddle.net/dMHS4/ jQuery v1.8.2 $("div").data("codeName") returns "007" Example: http://jsfiddle.net/dMHS4/2/

 1) writting the annotation in the method creation throws javassist.CannotCompileException: [source error] syntax error near "myMethod(@Param

@TITLE:Toggling background position on click
@CONTENT:I am trying to achieve this Is there an easy way to toggle background position between two states on click event? I have constructed a function that should work.. haven't got a clue why it won't. I have spent a number of hours trying to achieve this for such a tedious part of my project, but it's necessary. Please take a look at this function: $("#secondarrow").click(function(){
    /*$(".arrows").toggle( 
    function(){ 
        $(this).css({"background-position":"0px 0px"}); 
    },  
    function(){ 
        $(this).css({"background-position":"0px -30px"}); 
    });*/
    /*$(".arrows").toggleClass(function() {
    if ($(this).is(".arrows")) {
    return ".arrowsup";
    } else {
    return ".arrows";
    }
    });*/
    $('#secondarrow').toggle(function() { 
    $("#arrow2").css('backgroundPosition', '0px -15px'); 
    }, function() { 
    $("#arrow2").css('backgroundPosition', '0px 0px'); 
    });
$("#ukmore").slideToggle(100);
$("#clause").slideToggle(100);
});
 What it should do is, on clicking the div name second arrow, it reveals a number of sub-categories and at the same time toggle the background position of a div child with the id #arrow2 from an arrow that's pointing down (to indicate click to reveal more) to an arrow that's pointing up which is part of the same background image (to indicate click to hide sub-categories). I have tried a number of different function structures but none of them are working as required, the latest one - the one that isn't commented out - does change the background position to show the arrow pointing up but it only does it the on the first click AND only does it when clicking directly on the #arrow1 div, when I need it to toggle back and forth on clicking the #secondarrow div. Please help.
@CODE:$("#secondarrow").click(function(){

 The example above results in a ConcurrentModificationException. The condition to remove an element is, of course, just an example. I'm sure I'm just missing something; but how should I construct a loop that achieves the same thing in Java without throwing an exception?
@CODE:ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<Integer>(); // add some values to it

for(int i : list) { // ConcurrentModificationException

   Iterator iterator = list.iterator();

   while(iterator.hasNext()) {

      int n = iterator.next();

      if(n % i == 0) {
         iterator.remove();
      }

   }

Is that true and if it is, how much is price? Also I am interested in information about saving messages in server if user is not active in time of sending. How much push messages can Microsoft Push Service save for one device/user before starts to discard it?

I'm now unable to run the web site in the debugger without crashing the development web server. WebDev.WebServer40.exe has stopped working I see one of two similar stack traces in VS2012: Firstly, an AccessViolationException: mscorlib.dll!System.StringComparer.GetHashCode(object obj) + 0xc bytes

 The exact one that occurs seems to be random. To the best of my knowledge, all I did was install VS2012, reboot, then open my VS2010 solution in the new version of VS, watch it say that the upgrade was successful, and press F5. I'm out of ideas. Can anyone suggest what might be going on?

I researched it online and did in few different ways as well (ie. dwonload from Eclipse marketplace or Download Additional Server Adapters thing from within Add Server dialog), but its still the same - Glassfish server is not available to be added.

@TITLE:protobuf-net and serializing a linked list using interfaces
@CONTENT:I have come across a problem with protobuf-net and have narrowed it down to this simplest case. I want a linked list type structure, where a class has a property of the same type. When I serialize this it works great. However if the type is an interface instead of a class I get the following error: The type cannot be changed once a serializer has been generated for ConsoleApplication1.foo (ConsoleApplication1.ifoo) This is the code I have to generate this error: class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var toSerialize = new foo();
        toSerialize.data = "foo1";

        var subf = new foo();
        subf.data = "foo2";

        toSerialize.subfoo = subf;

        using (var pbfsc = new FileStream("testfile.proto", FileMode.Create))
        {
            using (var cs = new GZipStream(pbfsc, CompressionMode.Compress))
            {
                ProtoBuf.Serializer.Serialize(cs, toSerialize);
            }
            pbfsc.Close();
        }
    }
}

[ProtoContract, ProtoInclude(2000, typeof(foo))]
public interface ifoo
{
    [ProtoMember(1)]
    string data { get; set; }
    [ProtoMember(2)]
    ifoo subfoo { get; set; }
}
[ProtoContract]
public class foo : ifoo
{

    [ProtoMember(1)]
    public string data { get; set; }
    [ProtoMember(2)]
    public ifoo subfoo { get; set; }
}
 I have done all the reading on the subject I can and I can't see what I have done wrong. I tried putting my object in a wrapper class as it looks similiar to a problem with lists of interfaces (code not shown) and this still didn't help. If I change subfoo to type foo then it works fine, but in my more complex real world problem I would rather stick to using interface. Have I done something wrong here or is this a problem with protobuf-net? Any help greatly appreciated. Cheers Alex

 Not really heplful exception message. Especially that I was also not getting any "INITIALIZED" log entries. When I commented out the dataStore.getReports() invocation everything was working fine and beans were constructed in proper order ("INITIALIZED" messages were produced). Including dataStore method invocation was causing above error and was somehow supressing all the log output. I am using Weblogic 12c.

@TITLE:Is there a cleaner way for File::Find to return a list of wanted files?
@CONTENT:I find the design choice behind File::Find::find a little surprising. The examples I've come across all show find used in void context. The documentation also clarifies that the \&wanted coderef in find( \&wanted, @dirs ) is not meant to be a filter (emphasis my own): The wanted() function does whatever verifications you want on each file and directory. Note that despite its name, the wanted() function is a generic callback function, and does not tell File::Find if a file is "wanted" or not. In fact, its return value is ignored. But what if I do want to use it as a filter in a manner similar to grep? I'm curious to know if there's another way to write the following: use strict;
use warnings;
use feature 'say';

use File::Find;

my $wanted = qr/^\d{2}_/;  # e.g.

my @wanted;
find( sub { -f && /$wanted/ && push @wanted, $_ }, '.' );

# I wish my @wanted = find( ... ); worked

say for @wanted;

@LINK:/questions/12620133/backbone-js-rest-api-resources-relationship-interraction
@TITLE:Backbone.js & REST API resources relationship & interraction
@CONTENT:I have a small REST API that is being consumed by a single page web application powered by Backbone.js There are two resource types that the API provides, and therefore, the Backbone app uses. These are articles and comments. These two resources have different endpoints and there is a link from each of the articles to the location of all the comments for that item. The problem that I'm facing is that, on the article list in my web app I would like to be able to display the number of comments for each article. Given that that would only be possible if I also get the comments list, on the current setup, would require me to make one API request to get the the initial article list and another one for each of the articles to be able to count the number of comments. That becomes a problem if, for instance, there are 100 articles, and therefore 101 HTTP requests would be necessary to populate one single view. The solutions I can think of right now are: 1. to include the comments data in the initial articles request like so {
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Article 1",
    ...
    "comments": {
      {
        "id": 1,
        "text": "some comment"
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "text": "some comment"
      },
      ...
    }
  },
}
 The question in this case is: How is it possible to parse the "comments" as a separate comments collection and not include it into the article model? 2. to include some metadata inside the articles response like so: {
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Article 1",
    ...
    "comments": 13
  },
}
 Option that raises the question: how should I handle the parse of the model so that, on one hand the meta information is available, and on the other hand, the "comments" attribute is not one Backbone would try to perform updates on? I feel there might be another solution, compliant with the REST philosophy, for this that I'm missing, so if you have any other suggestion please let me know.
@CODE:{
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Article 1",
    ...
    "comments": {
      {
        "id": 1,
        "text": "some comment"
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "text": "some comment"
      },
      ...
    }
  },
} {
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Article 1",
    ...
    "comments": 13

@TITLE:Garbage collection in JavaScript closures
@CONTENT:I need some help here to undestand how this works (or does not, for that matter). In a web page, I create a click event listener for a node. Within the listener, I create an instance of some random class, which sets the node as property within itself. So, if var classInstance is the instance, I can access the node as something like classInstance.rootNode. When the listener fires, I setup an ajax request, keep classInstance in closure and pass along the ajax response to classInstance and use it to perhaps modify the rootNode's style or content or whatever. My question is, once I'm done with classInstance, assuming nothing else references it and by itself, it holds nothing else in its own closure, will the garbage collector dispose of it? If not, how do I mark it for disposal?

@CONTENT:I have a JSF/PrimeFaces web application. In one page <p:dataTable> and <p:fileDownload> components are been used. The bean constructor loads the data from the DB. It works fine when the page loads. The download button is provided in the last column of the datatable. When this button is clicked, then it is going to file download controller and everything works fine. But if I add a search function to the page which filters the datatable results based on the query, then clicking the download button doesn't return the downloaded file, instead it just refreshes the page. How is this caused and how can I solve it?

@CONTENT:How can I call a stored procedure in the same schema without specifying the full schema name when coding another stored procedure. These are SQL PL procedures within DB2. First SP: CREATE PROCEDURE MYSCHEMA.SP_TEST

 Creating a SP calling this SP directly without a schema name causes a compilation error: CREATE PROCEDURE MYSCHEMA.SP_TEST2

 It will throw: No authorized routine named "SP_TEST" of type "PROCEDURE" having compatible arguments was found.. SQLCODE=-440, SQLSTATE=42884, DRIVER=3.53.71 Directly giving the full schema name works: CREATE PROCEDURE MYSCHEMA.SP_TEST2

@CONTENT:I know very well that you are not allowed to upload a whole folder via drag and drop. The problem is, how can I tell if someone tries to do it? If you drag a folder into the browser, it behaves exactly as if you dragged a file with some extension webkit doesn't know about, like '.sh'. How can you tell the difference? I have tested this in Chrome and Safari and Firefox on Mac OS X and Windows. Depending on the browser and OS, I get slightly different results. Sometimes it succeeds in uploading a zero-byte file. Sometimes it uploads a picture of a folder. Sometimes it fails to upload anything. event.dataTransfer.types and event.dataTransfer.items both lie and say the type is "File" or "file" respectively. Firefox gives this list of types: {"0":"application/x-moz-file","1":"text/x-moz-url","2":"text/plain","3":"Files"}

@TITLE:ndb ComputedProperty filtering
@CONTENT:I have a User ndb.Model which has a username StringProperty that allows upper en lower case letters, at some point I wanted to fetch users by username but have the case forced to lowercase for the filtering. Therefor I added a ComputedProperty to User: username_lower which returns the lowercase version of the username as follows:     @ndb.ComputedProperty
    def username_lower(self):
        return self.username.lower()
 then I filter the query like so:     query = query.filter(User.username_lower==username_input.lower())
 This works, however it only does for users created (put) after I added this to the model. Users created before don't get filtered by this query. I first thought the ComputedProperty wasn't working for the older users. However, tried this and calling .username_lower on an old user does work. Finally, I found a solution to this is to fetch all users and just run a .put_multi(all_users) So seems like a ComputedProperty added later to the model works when you invoke it straight but doesn't filter at first. Does it not get indexed automatically ? or could it be a caching thing.. ? any insight to why it was behaving like this would be welcome thanks

    def username_lower(self):

@TITLE:(Homework) Dice Program, cannot find symbol
@CONTENT:I'm new to java and I've encountered yet another error with my dice program. In this program I have three methods, roll() to roll the die and return a value between 1 and a number specified by the user, getFaceValue(), to return the value of the die roll as an int, and toString(), to return the die roll as a string. The answer to my previous question about my program enabled me to get the program working, but it was not structured as the professor wanted, so I've had to rework it. I now know that none of my methods/variables can be static, and I can only take user input in the main part of the program. When I try to compile, I get the following error: Die.java:12: error: cannot find symbol
double y = (x * sides) + 1;

symbol: variable sides
location: class Die
 My code is as follows: import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class Die {
    //private int sides;
    private int z;
    private String faceName;

    //sets (and returns) the face value to a uniform random number between 1 and the number of faces.
    public int roll() {
        double x = Math.random();
        double y = (x * sides) + 1;
        z = (int)y;
        return z;
    }

    //returns the current face value of the die.
    public int getFaceValue() {
        int face = z;
        return face;
    }

    //returns the string representation of the face value.
    public String toString() {
        faceName = Integer.toString(z);
        return faceName;
    }

    public static void main(String [] args) {
        int sides;
        System.out.println("How many sides will the die have?");
        Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);
        sides = keyboard.nextInt();

        System.out.println(" ");
        Die die = new Die();
        System.out.println("Roll: " + die.roll());
        System.out.println("Face: " + die.getFaceValue());
        System.out.println("String: " + die.toString());
    }
}
 Originally, I had the variable sides as a private int (you can see it commented out in my program), but this produced a static reference error. I appreciate any help you can offer. The previous question was: Methods in Dice Program return 0

@CONTENT:I would like to know how to write the javascript to alter the style of form elements which are required; and change them if they have values in them. What I want to do is have a colored border around the required text fields when they are blank, and remove the border style when they have values. what I've thought of doing is to write a single javascript function which checks if the value is empty and set the appropriate style: function requiredElement(id) {
  var Input = document.getElementById(id);
  if(Input.value==null) {
    Input.style.border = '2px solid #FF0000';
  }
}
 But what I'm stuck with is changing the style as user enters/removes characters in these required fields, and calling the function for the fields. I have a simple html form, each input has a unique ID.
@CODE:function requiredElement(id) {
  var Input = document.getElementById(id);

@CONTENT:There is a related unanswered question here: c++ - Variables auto-initialized to 0 in unnamed namespace? - Stack Overflow When I have a global function pointer in C I can declare it static and it's initialized as NULL and only available for my file. In C++ I'm switching a lot of stuff to anonymous namespaces but I'm curious if they hold that same guarantee. If I have a function pointer in an anonymous namespace will it be initialized to null? Thanks

@TITLE:Emulating ReadAsync
@CONTENT:In .Net 4.5 there exists a method on the Stream class which read asynchronously from a stream while monitoring the cancellation token. ReadAsync : 
       buffer:byte[] * 
       offset:int * 
       count:int * 
       cancellationToken:CancellationToken -> Task<int>
 If another thread should first trigger the cancellation token then closes the stream, then is it guaranteed that the reading thread will be cancelled before ReadAsync throws an exception? Can I somehow achieve this guarantee using the .Net 4.0 framework and F# asynchronous workflows without ReadAsync(which has no overload which accepts a cancellation token to be monitored)?

@CONTENT:I'm trying to figure out how to execute a dynamic append query in Access 2010 against an ODBC database table (see question 12592953) and someone suggested enabling the showplan debugging output: techrepublic link. But Access 2010 / accdb databases apparently don't use the Jet engine, so this doesn't help me. Update: This is the query I'm trying to get working (a full description is in the other stackoverflow question linked above). It is supposed to update the local copy of a table with the new rows from the remote copy. But what happens is Access pulls the entire remote table (which is huge and causes ODBC to timeout), then runs the WHERE locally. INSERT INTO local (dt, latitude, longitude)
SELECT dt, latitude, longitude
FROM remote_odbc, (SELECT max(dt) AS max_dt FROM local) AS sub
WHERE remote_odbc.dt > max_dt;
 Is there something similar to the Jet / Debug / showplan registry hack in Access 2010 for getting more information about how Access views a query?

@TITLE:Prepare array for sorting in closure
@CONTENT:According to my research and googling, Javascript seems to lack support for locale aware sorting and string comparisons. There is localeCompare(), but it has been reported of browser specific differencies and impossibility to explicitly set which locale is used (the OS locale is not always the one wanted). There is some intentions to add collation support inside ECMAScript, but before it, we are on our own. And depending how consistent the results are across browsers, may be we are on our own forever :(. I have the following code, which makes alphabetical sort of an array. It's made speed in mind, and the ideas are got from http://stackoverflow.com/a/11598969/1691517, to which I made some speed improvements. In this example, the words array has 13 members and the sort-function is called 34 times. I want to replace some of the letters in the words-array (you don't have to know what replacements are made, because it's not the point in this question). If I make these replacements in sort-function ( the one that starts with return function(a, b) ), the code is inefficient, because replacements are made more than once per array member. Of course I can make these replacements outside of this closure, I mean before the line words.sort(sortbyalphabet_timo);, but it's not what I want. Question 1: Is it possible to modify the words-array in between the lines "PREPARATION STARTS" and "PREPARATION ENDS" so that the sort function uses modified words-array? Question 2: Is it possible to input arguments to the closure so that code between PREPARATION STARTS and PREPARATION ENDS can use them? I have tried this without success: var caseinsensitive = true;
words.sort( sortbyalphabet_timo(caseinsensitive) );

@TITLE:Only Allow POST Requests and Deny all other REQUEST_METHOD using .htaccess
@CONTENT:I have some email PHP Scripts which I do not want the user to have a look by a GET, but I am using it to send as an email, using wufoo's webHook if anyone knows about it, so it uses POST so I just want POST Requests to be allowed otherwise, 403 or 404 how do I do that? I tried some answers given on SO and browsed documentation of apache web server, the best answer I found was this:  RewriteEngine On
 RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} !=GET
 RewriteRule ^.*$ /path/to
 But I suppose this should be written in the directory where I have PHP Script, I just want use one .htaccess in root. Folder Structure :       public_html (would want to use this folders .htaccess only)
      -- email 
         -- mail.php (ONLY POST)
 I know we can use REQUEST_METHOD in mail.php directly but I don't want to do that, it is kind of thing which is not related to the script actually. can anyone provide some help.

@LINK:/questions/12605374/why-select-n-1-with-no-foreign-keys-and-linq
@TITLE:Why SELECT N + 1 with no foreign keys and LINQ?
@CONTENT:I have a database that unfortunately have no real foreign keys (I plan to add this later, but prefer not to do it right now to make migration easier). I have manually written domain objects that map to the database to set up relationships (following this tutorial http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/43025/A-LINQ-Tutorial-Mapping-Tables-to-Objects), and I've finally gotten the code to run properly. However, I've noticed I now have the SELECT N + 1 problem. Instead of selecting all Product's they're selected one by one with this SQL: SELECT [t0].[id] AS [ProductID], [t0].[Name], [t0].[info] AS [Description] 
FROM [products] AS [t0] 
WHERE [t0].[id] = @p0 
-- @p0: Input Int (Size = -1; Prec = 0; Scale = 0) [65] 
 Controller:     public ViewResult List(string category, int page = 1)
    {
        var cat = categoriesRepository.Categories.SelectMany(c => c.LocalizedCategories).Where(lc => lc.CountryID == 1).First(lc => lc.Name == category).Category;
        var productsToShow = cat.Products;
        var viewModel = new ProductsListViewModel
        {
            Products = productsToShow.Skip((page - 1) * PageSize).Take(PageSize).ToList(),
            PagingInfo = new PagingInfo
            {
                CurrentPage = page,
                ItemsPerPage = PageSize,
                TotalItems = productsToShow.Count()
            },
            CurrentCategory = cat
        };
        return View("List", viewModel);
    }
 Since I wasn't sure if my LINQ expression was correct I tried to just use this but I still got N+1: var cat = categoriesRepository.Categories.First();

 I've tried to comment out everything from my View, so nothing there seems to influence this. The ViewModel is as simple as it looks, so shouldn't be anything there. When reading this ( http://www.hookedonlinq.com/LinqToSQL5MinuteOVerview.ashx) I started suspecting it might be because I have no real foreign keys in the database and that I might need to use manual joins in my code. Is that correct? How would I go about it? Should I remove my mapping code from my domain model or is it something that I need to add/change to it? Note: I've stripped parts of the code out that I don't think is relevant to make it cleaner for this question. Please let me know if something is missing. EDIT: Gert Arnold solved the issue of all Products from the Category being queried one by one. However I'm still having the issue that all Products displayed on the page gets queried one by one. This happens from my view code: List.cshtml: @model MaxFPS.WebUI.Models.ProductsListViewModel

@foreach(var product in Model.Products) {
    Html.RenderPartial("ProductSummary", product);
}
 ProductSummary.cshtml: @model MaxFPS.Domain.Entities.Product

<div class="item">
    <h3>@Model.Name</h3>
    @Model.Description
    @if (Model.ProductSubs.Count == 1)
    {
        using(Html.BeginForm("AddToCart", "Cart")) {
            @Html.HiddenFor(x => x.ProductSubs.First().ProductSubID);
            @Html.Hidden("returnUrl", Request.Url.PathAndQuery);
            <input type="submit" value="+ Add to cart" />
        }
    }
    else
    {
        <p>TODO: l?nk eller dropdown f?r produkter med varianter</p>
    }
    <h4>@Model.LowestPrice.ToString("c")</h4>
</div>
 Is it something with .First() again? I tried .Take(1) but then I couldn't select the ID anyway... EDIT: I tried adding some code to my repository to access the DataContext and this code to create a DataLoadOptions. But it still generates a query for each ProductSub. var dlo = new System.Data.Linq.DataLoadOptions();
dlo.LoadWith<Product>(p => p.ProductSubs);
localizedCategoriesRepository.DataContext.LoadOptions = dlo;
var productsInCategory = localizedCategoriesRepository.LocalizedCategories.Where(lc => lc.CountryID == 1 && lc.Name == category)
    .Take(1)
    .SelectMany(lc => lc.Category.ProductCategories)
    .Select(pc => pc.Product);
 The SQL generated is slightly different though, and the order of the queries is also different. For the queries that select ProductSub the DataLoadOptions-code generates variables named @x1 and without them the variables are named @p0. SELECT [t0].[products_id] AS [ProductID], [t0].[id] AS [ProductSubID], [t0].[Name], [t0].[Price]
FROM [products_sub] AS [t0] 
WHERE [t0].[products_id] = @x1
 The difference in order for queries to me indicate that DataLoadOptions is in fact doing something, but not what I expect. What I'd expect is for it to generate something like this: SELECT [t0].[products_id] AS [ProductID], [t0].[id] AS [ProductSubID], [t0].[Name], [t0].[Price]
FROM [products_sub] AS [t0] 
WHERE [t0].[products_id] = @x1 OR [t0].[products_id] = @x2 OR [t0].[products_id] = @x3 ... and so on
@CODE:SELECT [t0].[id] AS [ProductID], [t0].[Name], [t0].[info] AS [Description] 
FROM [products] AS [t0] 
WHERE [t0].[id] = @p0 
-- @p0: Input Int (Size = -1; Prec = 0; Scale = 0) [65] public ViewResult List(string category, int page = 1)

And say i want the time to be displayed in lower right corner, i want the logtail to scroll in the upper 5 lines of the terminal, and i want the ping to scroll (separately) in the main body of the terminal. So what i am asking, basicly, is: can i make a cli-program behave like a GUI-program where the clock for instance just updates without printing it again, and there are 2 seperate data streams from subprocesses that scroll independantly Did that make sense?

@LINK:/questions/12596882/modal-uinavigationcontroller-hides-although-not-dismisses
@TITLE:Modal UINavigationController hides although not dismisses
@CONTENT:Okay, so I'm building an universal iOS app with an initial login view (view controller named LoginVC), just a plain simple UIViewController. If the login is successful the app segues to an navigation controller (MainNavigationVC). I created this segue through the storyboard gui of XCode, so no programmatic creation of the nav controller is done. The nav controller is presented modally in fullscreen, so the rest of the app is run atop the login view, with this nav controller as the centerpiece of everything. The navigation controller contains a view (with a view controller named UserStartPageVC), and in its navigation bar is a logout button. This button sends an target action to UserStartPageVC, with the goal of dismissing the nav controller thus bringing the user back to the login view. So far everything works fine. I can login and use the app as intended. But! When I log out and then re-login XCode tells me this: Warning! Attempt to present <MainNavigationVC: 0x753110> on <LoginVC: 0x756fcf0> while a presentation is in progress! I suppose this means that the login view is trying to modally display a MainNavigationVC navigation controller, but another one is already displayed, right? But how? Can a view be presented without showing? And how can I get rid of the old nav controller when logging out? I've tried several ways of dismissing the modal view, for instance: from within UserStartpageVC running [x dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:NULL] [x dismissModalViewControllerAnimated:YES] where x is either self, self.parentViewController or self.presentingViewController. setting the LoginVC as a property in UserStartpageVC and running [self.loginVC dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:NULL] and so on. All of the tested calls actually brings me back to the login screen, so it's kind of working. Any ideas? Relevant code samples can be provided if necessary, I just couldn't figure out which pieces that were of interest. The seguing to the navigation controller has no code (except for a performSegueWithIdentifier:sender:), and the code for dismissing it is the part I cannot seem to get straight. As a sidenote. So far this isn't a REAL problem; the app runs, and it IS possible to logout and re-login without any other side-effects than an error message in XCode. But I suppose this will be a memory leak if users logout and login multiple times, and I'm not in the mood of an unnecessary rejection from Apple.

@TITLE:Android Autoreply Application
@CONTENT:I am creating an android application that will send automatic replies to sms received from others if the user is busy. There will be two options for the user to select his status-available or busy. So once the user sets his status as busy, all the incoming sms's will receive an automatic reply (via sms) telling them that" I cant reply, I am busy". I am stuck on one condition though. I also have to make sure that after sending autoreply to that number if I again get an sms from the same number I should not autoreply back to that number if the time interval between two sms's recieved from that number is less than 10 mins and if the time interval exceeds 10 mins, it should send an autoreply. I dont know how to go about this. Can someone explain me the logic about how to code this and also what to use to do this?

My idea is to build that template with placeholders like "text1", "text2", etc. This template would be saved to a PDF file and put on the app bundle. At run time, the template would be copied to a new PDF context and then I would search for the placeholders, replacing them with the real text I want. I have found this page, showing how to create a new PDF from a template and this one on how to search on the PDF. The question now is: how do I replace stuff (texts or images) on the new PDF?

@TITLE:onInterceptTouchEvent, onTouchEvent only see ACTION_DOWN
@CONTENT:I have a top level ViewGroup, which I call SliderView, in which I want to detect swiping. This is mostly working, but one weird failure persists. The essence of SliderView is to override onInterceptTouchEvent and, once the user is actually swiping, return "true" to prevent other views from seing the MotionEvent. Here is a snip of code: public class SliderView extends ViewGroup
{
  enum MoveState { MS_NONE, MS_HSCROLL, MS_VSCROLL };
  private MoveState moveState = MoveState.MS_NONE;

  ... other code ...

  public boolean onInterceptTouchEvent(MotionEvent e)
  {
    final int action = e.getAction();
    switch (action & MotionEvent.ACTION_MASK)
    {
      case MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN:
        moveState = MoveState.MS_NONE;
        break;

      case MotionEvent.ACTION_MOVE:
        if (moveState == MoveState.MS_NONE)
        {
          if (motion is horizontal)
          {
            moveState = MoveState.MS_VSCROLL;
            return true;
          }
          else
            moveState = MoveState.MS_VSCROLL; // let child window handl MotionEvent
        }
        else if (moveState == MoveState.MS_HSCROLL)
          return true; // don't let children see motion event.
    }
    return super.onInterceptTouchEvent (e);
  }

  ... other code ...
}
 It is my understanding that my SliderView (which is the outermost view) should always recevie onInterceptTouchEvent. In one of my tests, where the top level child is a However, in the following case, this appears not to be. When the top level child is a ScrollView, onInterceptTouchEvent gets ACTION_MOVE and my code does what I want. In another case, where the top level child is a LinearLayout, it fails sometimes: it always gets ACTION_DOWN but gets ACTION_MOVE only if the user touches a widget inside the LinearLayout; if touching blank area, only ACTION_DOWN comes through. I'll note that it behaves as if the fail-case touches are happening outside the SliderView. However, if that were the case, why would I get the ACTION_DOWN events? Second note: looking at the source code for ScrollView, I see it checking for "inChild"; I have not figured out what that's for and how it might be relevant.

@TITLE:multiprocessing.Pool processes locked to a single core
@CONTENT:I'm using multiprocessing.Pool in Python on Ubuntu 12.04, and I'm running into a curious problem; When I call map_async on my Pool, I spawn 8 processes, but they all struggle for dominance over a single core of my 8-core machine. The exact same code uses up both of my cores in my Macbook Pro, and all four cores of my other Ubuntu 12.04 desktop (as measured with htop, in all cases). My code is too long to post all of, but the important part is: P = multiprocessing.Pool()
results = P.map_async( unwrap_self_calc_timepoint, zip([self]*self.xLen,xrange(self.xLen)) ).get(99999999999)
P.close()
P.join()
ipdb.set_trace()
 where unwrap_self_calc_timepoint is a wrapper function to pass the necessary self argument to a class, based on the advice of this article. All three computers are using Python 2.7.3, and I don't really know where to start in hunting down why that one Ubuntu computer is acting up. Any help as to how to begin narrowing the problem down would be helpful. Thank you!

     sample<-as.data.frame(cbind(sp1,sp3,sp5))

 Searching yielded things about different scales of numbers not producing the right results (a very small number and a very large number), but that seemed pretty general, and considering the numbers I'm using are of the same scale, I don't think that's why this happens. EDIT: I suppose I didn't define that the "this thing happening" I meant was that it returns 0.2 ... 018 instead of simply resulting in 0.2. I get that print rounds, and removed the print part in the code snippet, as that was misleading.

@TITLE:Bind to all namespaces of custom jquery event
@CONTENT:I'm trying to listen for a custom event but I would like to effectively 'ignore' the fact that it's namespaced or somehow listen to all namespaces without defining them individually. $('#test').on('custom', ...);

$('#test').trigger('custom.namespace1');
$('#test').trigger('custom.namespace2');
 The reason I want to be able to do this is because I have multiple ui plugins that fire events when they are hidden/shown. These events are mainly used internally but are namespaced so they don't collide with each other. However I would also just like to know when a particular ui element is hidden, independent of its source to perform other cleanup logic. In the above example, nothing will happen because the trigger events are namespaced. Can I listen to all namespaces with something to the effect of custom.*? Fiddle demonstrating the problem. Thanks Edit Even something like this would be desirable but still can't get it to work $('#test').on('custom.global', log);

$('#test').trigger('custom.global.namespace1');
$('#test').trigger('custom.global.namespace2');
 Fiddle
@CODE:$('#test').on('custom', ...);

$('#test').trigger('custom.namespace1');
$('#test').trigger('custom.namespace2'); custom.* $('#test').on('custom.global', log);

$('#test').trigger('custom.global.namespace1');
$('#test').trigger('custom.global.namespace2');

@TITLE:Window Loaded and WPF
@CONTENT:I have a WPF project in Windows 2012 in which I need to load some information in the Window Loaded event. I need to do this in the View Model rather than in the CodeBehind, though. I am attempting to use the following code: In my xaml: <interactivity:Interaction.Behaviors>
    <behaviors:WindowLoadedBehavior LoadedCommand="{Binding WindowLoadedCommand}" />
</interactivity:Interaction.Behaviors>
 In my View Model: private DelegateCommand _WindowLoadedCommand;

public DelegateCommand WindowLoadedCommand
{
    get
    {
        return _WindowLoadedCommand;
    }
    private set
    {
        _WindowLoadedCommand = value;
    }
}

public ShellViewModel()
{
    WindowLoadedCommand = new DelegateCommand(WindowLoadedAction);
}

protected void WindowLoadedAction()
{
    ...
}
 My attached behavior: public class WindowLoadedBehavior : Behavior<FrameworkElement>
{
    [SuppressMessage("Microsoft.StyleCop.CSharp.MaintainabilityRules", "SA1401:FieldsMustBePrivate", Justification = "Dependency Property.  Allow public.")]
    public static DependencyProperty LoadedCommandProperty = DependencyProperty.Register("LoadedCommand", typeof(ICommand), typeof(WindowLoadedBehavior), new PropertyMetadata(null));

    public ICommand LoadedCommand
    {
        get { return (ICommand)GetValue(LoadedCommandProperty); }
        set { SetValue(LoadedCommandProperty, value); }
    }

    protected override void OnAttached()
    {
        base.OnAttached();

        AssociatedObject.Loaded += AssociatedObject_Loaded;
    }

    protected override void OnDetaching()
    {
        AssociatedObject.Loaded -= AssociatedObject_Loaded;

        base.OnDetaching();
    }

    private void AssociatedObject_Loaded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
    {
        if (LoadedCommand != null)
            LoadedCommand.Execute(null);
    }
}
 The OnAttached, AssociatedObject_Loaded and LoadedCommand get are all firing, but the LoadedCommand set is not firing and, obviously, the WindowLoadedCommand isn't firing. Any clue what I can do to get this working?
@CODE:<interactivity:Interaction.Behaviors>
    <behaviors:WindowLoadedBehavior LoadedCommand="{Binding WindowLoadedCommand}" />
</interactivity:Interaction.Behaviors> private DelegateCommand _WindowLoadedCommand;

public DelegateCommand WindowLoadedCommand
{
    get
    {
        return _WindowLoadedCommand;
    }
    private set
    {
        _WindowLoadedCommand = value;
    }
}

public ShellViewModel()
{
    WindowLoadedCommand = new DelegateCommand(WindowLoadedAction);
}

protected void WindowLoadedAction()
{
    ...
} public class WindowLoadedBehavior : Behavior<FrameworkElement>
{
    [SuppressMessage("Microsoft.StyleCop.CSharp.MaintainabilityRules", "SA1401:FieldsMustBePrivate", Justification = "Dependency Property.  Allow public.")]
    public static DependencyProperty LoadedCommandProperty = DependencyProperty.Register("LoadedCommand", typeof(ICommand), typeof(WindowLoadedBehavior), new PropertyMetadata(null));

    public ICommand LoadedCommand
    {
        get { return (ICommand)GetValue(LoadedCommandProperty); }
        set { SetValue(LoadedCommandProperty, value); }
    }

    protected override void OnAttached()
    {
        base.OnAttached();

        AssociatedObject.Loaded += AssociatedObject_Loaded;
    }

    protected override void OnDetaching()
    {
        AssociatedObject.Loaded -= AssociatedObject_Loaded;

        base.OnDetaching();
    }

    private void AssociatedObject_Loaded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
    {
        if (LoadedCommand != null)
            LoadedCommand.Execute(null);
    }

@TITLE:Linking errors when compiling python extension module
@CONTENT:So I'm writing a python extension module in C and I'm trying to compile it for my 64-bit Python build. After bashing my head against MinGW for a while, I did some googling around and found that MinGW doesn't do 64-bit extension modules, so I set up Visual C++ 2008 Express with the Win7 SDK and DISTUTILS_USE_SDK and MSSdk both equal to 1 as in the answers to this question. I finally got Distutils to find the compilers, but when I compile the extension I get this output: core.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol __imp__PyErr_NoMemory refer

 I want to alert the users when they lose internet and when they gain it back. But the problem I'm running into is when a user is on an iPhone (with constant network connection) and they connect to Wi-Fi, they get an alert, when they were already connected. So I would only want to alert them if they DIDN'T have an internet connection and connected to Wi-Fi. This code works great for iPod and iPads without data plans, but the problem is on iPhones. Is there something I can do to edit this and make it only show an alert for one or the other? I tried this code for the last alert: else if (remoteHostStatus == ReachableViaWiFi && !(remoteHostStatus == ReachableViaWWAN)) {
        //if connected to Wi-Fi but without Network
        UIAlertView *alertre = [[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:@"Internet Connection!" message:@"Your device re-connected to the internet!"
                                                         delegate:self
                                                cancelButtonTitle:nil
                                                otherButtonTitles:@"Ok!", nil];
        [alertre show];
    }
 But this didn't fix the problem...

@CONTENT:I've been using jshint with node but just recently had to switch over to using it with Rhino. I used to be able to do: jshint --config=jsHintConfig.json fileToLint.js Now, I've tried replacing that call with: rhino jshint-rhino.js --config=jsHintConfig.json fileToLint.js But it doesn't seem to work. I only get the following printed to the console: Usage: jshint.js file.js Does jshint-rhino not accept a json configuration file? Update: http://anton.kovalyov.net/2011/03/01/jshint-edition-update/ - Says: "Added support for providing options to JSHint as command line arguments when used with our Rhino wrapper" but doesn't say how. https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/27 - Something about specifying options on the cli, but also doesn't say how.

@TITLE:UIAlertView does not display on iphone
@CONTENT:I have created a generalized method method to display an alertview. I have appended my code for review. I am trying to validate three uitextfields and if invalid, put relevant information in instance variables used in the uialertview method. You can see that I have plenty of nslog statements sprinkled thru the code. The nslogs at the beginning and end of the method all display relevent information for the error that occurred. When I click on the button in the Simulator screen that sets this in motion, there is no message displayed but the screen background, it is light gray, will change to a darker gray. Here is the code: - (void)SendErrorMessage
{
    NSLog(@"Starting SendErrorMessage");
    NSLog(@"initWithTitle = %@", self.alertViewTitleText);
    NSLog(@"message = %@", self.alertViewMessageText);
    NSLog(@"cancelButtonTitle = %@", self.alertViewCancelButtonText);

    UIAlertView *alert = [[UIAlertView alloc]
                         initWithTitle:self.alertViewTitleText
                         message:self.alertViewMessageText
                         delegate:nil cancelButtonTitle:
                         self.alertViewCancelButtonText
                         otherButtonTitles:nil];
    [alert show];
    NSLog(@"Finished SendErrorMessage");
    return;

}
 Any help on this will be greatly appreciated. OK, I am really confused now. I went into the code and added the following code just below the [alert show]: // Block for 5 seconds [NSThread sleepForTimeInterval:5.0]; I did this to see if the alertview was actually being displayed to fast to be seen. Nope, based on my log the program sat for 5 seconds and then continued on with the program logic. I also replaced the uialertview with an uiactionsheet to see if it would display where the uialertview doesn't. Once again, nope, neither of them will display on the simulator screen. Here is my interface statement in my .h file: @interface BeginningScene : UIViewController, (less than)UIActionSheetDelegate, UITextViewDelegate, UIAlertViewDelegate(greater than) Again, thanks for the assistance and any ideas will be greatly appreciated.
@CODE:- (void)SendErrorMessage

@TITLE:What could make Phonon/DirectShow miss a standard codec?
@CONTENT:We're developing a Qt-based application that includes video playback using Phonon. We use .avi files with MJPEG compression (as we need fast seeking to particular frames). On the development machine (running Windows 7) all works well - Phonon uses DirectShow backend, DirectShow loads and plays our video files using standard MJPEG codec from quartz.dll. But some of the testers on Windows 7 reported broken video playback, I had a quick on one of the machines and see nothing special there, but: InstalledCodecs utility reports MJPEG codec present and enabled Windows Media Player plays the files fine (but I gather it uses a different backend, not the DirectShow). Media Player Classic configured to use DirectShow and the standard MJPEG plugin complains that there is no codec available. Our software indeed breaks, apparently for the same reason, whatever it is. The phonon backend is installed in the plugins directory which is added to the search paths which I see listed in the logs, so it should be loaded. I renamed QtSDK on the development machine to make sure only installed qt plugins are available to the application and it continues to work there. I would appreciate any advice as to where to look at next. What I'd eventually like to know is: what could be the problem how could installer or the app itself detect the problem how could the problem be solved - either automatically, or by instructing the user

@CONTENT:In java, When we call a new Constructor(), then a new object is created each time i.e; a new memory is allocated or suppose there are already many objects created for a class that do not have any reference. So can java return such object that are marked for de-allocation or will the java create a new object each time a new constructor() is called. What's my basic intention to ask this question is if such thing happens then performance can be improved as the cost to create a new memory and destroying a un-refrenced object will be reduced.

@TITLE:NPOI with OOXML Excel password not working
@CONTENT:I am having an issue using the OOXML library when attempting to read encrypted 2007 Excel documents. The password that I send to the DecryptToStream method is sending back a "Password not valid" message, but if I go directly into excel the password works fine. Below is the code I am using. OleStorage ols = new OleStorage(d.fileLocation);
OfficeCrypto oc = new OfficeCrypto();
Stream test = oc.DecryptToStream(ols, "test123");
 I have also tried using the POI Decryptor to attempt to read the encrypted 2007 excel, but I have had no luck with this as well. Below is code. FileStream file = new FileStream(d.fileLocation, FileMode.Open, System.IO.FileAccess.Read);
NPOI.POIFS.FileSystem.POIFSFileSystem nfs;
nfs = new NPOI.POIFS.FileSystem.POIFSFileSystem(file);
Stream excelData;
try
{
    string password = "test123";
    EncryptionInfo info = new EncryptionInfo(nfs);
    Decryptor dc = Decryptor.GetInstance(info);

    if (!dc.VerifyPassword(password))

    }

    excelData = dc.GetDataStream(nfs);

}
catch (Exception ex)

    initialize_PR();

 And the dialog is correctly shown when the button of the Activity that triggers Action_ShowDialog_Buy is clicked. But after that, the Dialog itself has a button: <!-- dialog_buy.xml -->

 The button method Action_ShowDialog_Buy is implemented on the Activity: public void Action_ShowDialog_Buy(View view) {
    BuyDialog.dismiss() ;
}
 but when I click on the Button in the Dialog I receive the error: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Could not find a method BuyActivity.Action_ShowDialog_Buy(View) in the activity class android.view.ContextThemeWrapper for onClick handler on view class android.widget.Button with id 'Button_Buy'
 and below: Caused by: java.lang.NoSuchMethodException:BuyActivity.Action_ShowDialog_Buy
 but as you can see above, the method exists on the Activity. I think I understand this is some kind of scope issue, but I do not manage to understand it. Please note that I have readed Using onClick attribute in layout xml causes a NoSuchMethodException in Android dialogs but I need to understand, not just to copy code. Many thanks

 and two collections: Collection<OrderDetail> and Collection<OrderDetailDto>. Collection<OrderDetailDto> has data changes, that was made somewhere. Now I want to apply these changes to Collection<OrderDetail>, using Automapper. For simplicity, let's think, that items count in these collections are equal, but the order of items may differ. To map collection items correctly, I want to use MergeId property. I need something like this: Mapper.CreateMap<Collection<OrderDetailDto>, Collection<OrderDetail>>()
  .MappingExpression((dto, do) => dto.MergeId == do.MergeId);
 Is this possible to do with Automapper?
@CODE:[DataContract]
public sealed class OrderDetailDto
{
    [DataMember]
    public Guid MergeId { get; set; }
    [DataMember]
    public int Id { get; set; }
    [DataMember]
    public string PostionName { get; set; }
    [DataMember]
    public decimal Quantity { get; set; }
    [DataMember]
    public byte[] Version { get; set; }
} public sealed class OrderDetail
{
    public Guid MergeId { get; set; }
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string PostionName { get; set; }
    public decimal Quantity { get; set; }
    public byte[] Version { get; set; }
} Collection<OrderDetail> Collection<OrderDetailDto> Collection<OrderDetailDto> Collection<OrderDetail> MergeId Mapper.CreateMap<Collection<OrderDetailDto>, Collection<OrderDetail>>()
  .MappingExpression((dto, do) => dto.MergeId == do.MergeId);

@TITLE:Integrating external highlighter tool in Eclipse editor
@CONTENT:Okay, this is probably easy, but I don't know proper words to describe it, and hence, google it... I have an external script which takes a file name and outputs this: /path/to/file.py:683:80: E501 line too long (85 characters)
/path/to/file.py:690:21: other error message
..etc..
 Now, I know this output format is widely accepted by other, much simple IDEs, e.g. EditPlus. I don't know how to integrate it with Eclipse though. I want this script integrated with my editor windows. I want Eclipse to run it in the background, every time I save the file, and then parse the results and mark all the lines which occured in the script's output. It should look something like this: How can I do that? Note (for those who know why I need this): I know PyDev has a pep8.py checker integrated, but it's not enough.

@TITLE:ios 6 uiwebview shows background while scrolling a page using jquery scrolltop
@CONTENT:I have a web page being displayed in a UIWebView that uses jquery scrollTop (using 1.6.4 version of jquery) to scroll the window to a speicified position after the page is loaded. This was working fine with xcode older than 4.5. After I built it using xcode 4.5 the page momentarily shows the background of the UIWebView before scrolling. This happens only in ios6. Has anyone encountered any similar issue with xcode 4.5 and ios6? Is there any new API for UIWebview that I can use to stop this annoying behaviour?

@TITLE:Should we create Model Classes when we use Core Data?
@CONTENT:I am working on an iPad application, that requires me to store data locally if the user doesn't have internet access and later on sync with the back-end database. For local storage, I am planning to use Core Data with SQLite. I am using Core Data for the first time and it seems, it retrieves entity and store entity in the form of a dictionary. So should I be creating Model classes at all ? What is a good design for such application. I have a DataEngine class whose responsibility is to store entity on a server or local DB based on connectivity. Now I am little confused If I need to create a Model class and ask individual model classes to save themselves using NSMangaedObjectContext with a dictionary representation Or just directly save data instead of creating a model object and asking it to do it ? Should I be using a Moel class for each entity and that will server as interface between JSON representation that coms/goes from/to server. and the representation I get from managedObjectContext. Or shall I compeletely rely on the entity and relation ships that Core Data creates ?

 RAD continues to indicate that it's waiting for server startup in the progress pane: "Starting WebSphere Application Server v6.1 at localhost". This is a pain because it eventually times out and tells me the server never started even though it's running and responding to requests and it seems like this state means publishing updates as I change code fails to work. I don't see any errors in the console during server startup - same for the WebSphere 6.1 Launcher's console. Is there a simple way to fix this?

@TITLE:What's the most DRY-appropriate way to execute an SQL command?
@CONTENT:I'm looking to figure out the best way to execute a database query using the least amount of boilerplate code. The method suggested in the SqlCommand documentation: private static void ReadOrderData(string connectionString)
{
    string queryString = "SELECT OrderID, CustomerID FROM dbo.Orders;";
    using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
    {
        SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand(queryString, connection);
        connection.Open();
        SqlDataReader reader = command.ExecuteReader();
        try
        {
            while (reader.Read())
            {
                Console.WriteLine(String.Format("{0}, {1}",     reader[0], reader[1]));
            }
        }
        finally
        {
            reader.Close();
        }
    }
}
 mostly consists of code that would have to be repeated in every method that interacts with the database. I'm already in the habit of factoring out the establishment of a connection, which would yield code more like the following. (I'm also modifying it so that it returns data, in order to make the example a bit less trivial.) private SQLConnection CreateConnection()
{
    var connection = new SqlConnection(_connectionString);
    connection.Open();
    return connection;
}

private List<int> ReadOrderData()
{
    using(var connection = CreateConnection())
    using(var command = connection.CreateCommand())
    {
        command.CommandText = "SELECT OrderID FROM dbo.Orders;";

        using(var reader = command.ExecuteReader())
        {
            var results = new List<int>();
            while(reader.Read()) results.Add(reader.GetInt32(0));
            return results;
        }
    }
}
 That's an improvement, but there's still enough boilerplate to nag at me. Can this be reduced further? In particular, I'd like to do something about the first two lines of the procedure. I don't feel like the method should be in charge of creating the SqlCommand. It's a tiny piece of repetition as it is in the example, but it seems to grow if transactions are being managed manually or timeouts are being altered or anything like that. edit: Assume, at least hypothetically, there's going to have to be a bunch of different types of data being returned. And consequently the solution can't be just one one-size-fits-all method, there will have to be a few different ones depending, at minimum, on whether ExecuteNonQuery, ExecuteScalar, ExecuteReader, ExecuteReaderAsync, or any of the others are being called. I'd like to cut down on the repetition among those.

            }
        }
        finally
        {

@CONTENT:I would like to know the simplest way to sort an xml/xslt table by clicking associated buttons. I'm pretty familiar with xslt but very new to javascript so go easy on me. I've looked at many examples on the internet but it seems like nothing really fits what I'm trying to do or perhaps my coding skills just aren't up to par. I might be way off but I was thinking something along the lines of... xslt: <button onclick="title()">sort by title</button>

<xsl:for each select="record">
<xsl:sort id="title" select="dates/year"/>
<!--more xsl code-->
 javascript: function title() {
document.getElementById(title).select="titles/title";
}
 I'm also not exactly clear on where to put the javascript code. I've already got a .js file that displays my xml & xsl files as an html. Can I put this code there? Or do I need inline script on my xsl file? I've seen many ways of attaching javascript to an xsl file, but I'm not sure which way is best for my purposes

@TITLE:Fade Transition when using PHP Includes
@CONTENT:I'm trying to create a fade or slide transition using jQuery or CSS (or otherwise!) on php included pages which sit within a DIV. I've searched around and found loads of examples of fade transitions which fade divs with one another or fade in hidden content but this situation is slightly different. I have one DIV whose content is controlled by the nav bar. Each page is successfully included within the div using PHP when it is selected but I'm wanting to make the content fade in and out. Any ideas on how to make a nice looking transition between page changes? Many thanks Code: <?php
    if (isset($_GET['page']))
    $page = $_GET['page'];

    else {
            $_GET['page'] = 1;
            $page = $_GET['page'];
}
?>
 and then the pages are included in a div like so: <div id="content">
      <?php switch($page)
    {       
            case "about":
            include('includes/about.php');

            default:
                include('includes/home.php');
            }
?>
    </div>
 The content is selected from a nav bar: <ul>
  <li><a href="m_index.php?page=home"><img src="" width="32" height="32" alt="Home"/></a></li>

@TITLE:H2DB and Java, an approximate> two hour discrepancy
@CONTENT:I am developing a race timing system, and for several instances, I need to retrieve a time object from H2DB. Like its bretheren (or sisteren), the time data type is relative to 1st January 1970 and is expressed in SQL in the 'hh:mm:ss' format, with the date being by set by default to 01-01-1970. It is by default mapped to the a 'java.sql.Time' object. Being a trusting padawan, I coded the following to separate hours from minutes for display purposes.  if(race.getCutOffTime()!=null){
    long cutOffHour=(race.getCutOffTime().getTime())/(3600000);
    int cutOffMinute=(int)(race.getCutOffTime().getTime()%(60*60*1000));
    System.out.println(cutOffHour+":"+cutOffMinute);
    }
 Java's time handling stink arises however in that these functions output unexpected values, for example, the following statement from my db, gives an output of 3:30. INSERT INTO MagEye.Races(RaceName, EventID,CutOffTime) 
VALUES ('TEST', SELECT EventID FROM MagEye.Events 
WHERE EventName='Sabrina Love',TIME '5:50:00');
 Changing this statement to reflect a time of '0:0:0', gives me a value of "-2:00" What am I doing wrong? Thank you (in advance). Edit As requested, here is my code for the database: Table Creation Statement: CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS MagEye.Races (RaceID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT ,  RaceName VARCHAR(100) ,EventID INT, Description TEXT, MaxEntrants INT, MinAge INT, MaxAge INT, RacePrefix VARCHAR (5), TimingMethod CHAR(1), CutOffTime TIME, RaceEnd TIMESTAMP,Finished BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE, Autostart BOOLEAN, FOREIGN KEY(EventID) REFERENCES MagEye.Events(EventID));

@TITLE:How to use GLFW to poll for events in a libdispatch block?
@CONTENT:Following up on the answer to How to use GLUT with libdispatch?, I'm now using GLFW instead X The following code sets up a window, sets up a timer to poll for events, and, over time, enqueues render updates: #include <dispatch/dispatch.h>
#include <GL/glfw.h>

float t=0;

int main(void)
{
    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
        glfwInit();
        glfwDisable(GLFW_AUTO_POLL_EVENTS);
        glfwOpenWindow(320,200,8,8,8,8,8,0,GLFW_WINDOW);
    });

    // Periodically process window events --- this isn't working.
    dispatch_source_t windowEventTimer;
    windowEventTimer = dispatch_source_create(DISPATCH_SOURCE_TYPE_TIMER, 0, 0, dispatch_get_main_queue());
    uint64_t nanoseconds = 100 * NSEC_PER_MSEC;
    dispatch_source_set_timer(windowEventTimer, dispatch_time(DISPATCH_TIME_NOW, nanoseconds), nanoseconds, 0);
    dispatch_source_set_event_handler(windowEventTimer, ^{
        glfwPollEvents();
    });
    dispatch_resume(windowEventTimer);

    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0), ^{
        for(int i=0;i<200;++i)
        {
            // Enqueue a rendering update.
            dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
                glClearColor (0.2f, 0.2f, 0.4f, 1.0f);
                glClear (GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);

                glColor3f (1.0, 0.7, 0.7); 
                glBegin( GL_LINES );
                    glVertex3f(0,0,0);
                    glVertex3f(t+=0.02,.1,0);
                glEnd();

                glfwSwapBuffers();
            });
            // Wait a bit, to simulate complex calculations.
            sleep(1);
        }
    });

    dispatch_main();
}
 The animation updates as expected, but the window frame does not draw, and the window does not respond to events.

@LINK:/questions/12569554/webmethod-not-accessible-in-sitecore
@TITLE:WebMethod not accessible in Sitecore
@CONTENT:I got a problem for a website I was working on. A WebMethod is called from a JavaScript function: var ajaxOptions = {
    url: "/layouts/foobar/Foo.aspx/GetBar"
}
$.ajax(ajaxOptions).done(function(result) { 
    loadResult(result, a);
});
 The method GetBar in Foo.Aspx looks like this: [WebMethod]
[ScriptMethod(ResponseFormat = ResponseFormat.Json)]
public static object GetBar()
{
    return FoobarManager.GetItems();
}
 The function returns a valid JSON object. Sitecore is used in the FoobarManager. Example: Context.Database.GetItem("/sitecore/content/foobar");
 On the development and test environment things ran very smoothly with no problems what so ever. After the deployment to the staging environment I saw that the response of the GetBar function was our custom 404 page. I figured this was because Sitecore was trying to resolve the path "/layouts/foobar/Foo.aspx/GetBar" and failed. Since it worked on the D and T environment, it must be a configuration problem. I added the GetBar url to the IgnoreUrlPrefixes setting. This resulted in a 500 response in the ajax call: the Sitecore.Context.Database was null. I figured it had something to do with the ItemResolver but I can't understand WHY it worked on D and T but not on A. What can I do to resolve the url correctly?

@TITLE:How to configure XStream to map to different classes depending on XML attributes?
@CONTENT:I have the following Java object hierarchy: public interface Function {
    public void calculate(long t);
}

public class ConstantFunction implements Function {
    private double constant;

    @Override
    public void calculate(long t) {
        // ...
    }
}

public class LinearFunction implements Function {
    private double slope;

    private double yIntercept;

    @Override
    public void calculate(long t) {
        // ...
    }
}
 Users can create ConstantFunction and LinearFunction instances by defining them inside XML like so: <myapp>
    <function type="ConstantFunction>
        <!-- ... -->
    </function>
    <function type="LinearFunction>
        <!-- ... -->
    </function>
</myapp>
 I am using XStream to OX-map the user-defined XML into Java POJOs. I'm currently trying to configure the XStream mapper with aliases so that it knows what Java class to bind to the function element: XStream oxmapper = new XStream();
oxmapper.alias("myapp", MyApp.class);
oxmapper.alias("function", ???);
 The problem is, I need to configure XStream with logic that says: *if function/type is ConstantFunction, then use oxmapper.alias("function", ConstantFunction.class); but if its value is LinearFunction, then use oxmapper.alias("function", LinearFunction.class). The problem is, I don't think XStream API gives provides a way to inspect the XML the way I need it to in order to implement this logic. If I am incorrect, please point me in the right direction! If I am correct, then the only solution I can think of would be to have a really nasty "hodgepodge" class that forms a union of all the Function concretions like so: public class FunctionFactory implements Function {
    private double constant;
    private double slope;
    private double yIntercept;

    private Class<? extends Function> concreteClass;

    @Override
    public void calculate(long t) {
        // Do nothing. This class is a workaround to limitations with XStream.
        return;
    }
}
 In the OX-mapper config: oxampper.alias("function", FunctionFactory.class);
oxmapper.aliasField("function", "type", "concreteClass");
 Now, every time I read an XML instance into a MyApp instance, I need to correct the conversion: XStream oxmapper = getConfiguredMapper();
MyApp app = oxmapper.fromXml("<myapp>...</myapp>");

FunctionFactory factory = app.getFunction();
Function concretion = factory.getConcreteClass();

app.setFunction(concretion);
 This is the only workaround I can cook up, but it feels really nasty, and I have to believe there's a better way to do this. Thanks in advance!

@TITLE:Replace jQuery slide with animate() CSS3
@CONTENT:I have jQuery slideUp and down and on a page and the performance of animations is very bad. So i want to replace the sliding function with .animate() or .css() to utilize CSS3 animations (which are generally smoother than jQuery) here is my code jQuery('.close').on("click", function() {
var parent = jQuery(this).parent('.parentbox');
parent.children('.box').slideUp('500');
jQuery(this).hide();
parent.children('.open').show();
parent.animate({"opacity":"0.4"});
});

jQuery('.open').on("click", function() {
var parent = jQuery(this).parent('.parentbox');
parent.children('.box').slideDown('500');
jQuery(this).hide();
parent.children('.close').show();
parent.animate({"opacity":"1"});
});
 Now if i replace .slideUp with .animate({"height":"0px"}); how can i revert it back to the previous height when .open is clicked? I use cookies to close the box if it was closed the last time. This leaves me unable to use .height() to check box's height as in some cases it might be closed.
@CODE:jQuery('.close').on("click", function() {
var parent = jQuery(this).parent('.parentbox');
parent.children('.box').slideUp('500');
jQuery(this).hide();

});

jQuery('.open').on("click", function() {
var parent = jQuery(this).parent('.parentbox');
parent.children('.box').slideDown('500');
jQuery(this).hide();
parent.children('.close').show();
parent.animate({"opacity":"1"});

@CONTENT:I have a application for WP7 and Android, and this application must have supporthas support for "any" connection type (WiFi, NFC, Bluetooth etc) I have then created a layered model with MVVMCross https://github.com/slodge/MvvmCross I have an interface for example Android Bluetooth must implement interface IConnectionService

    void Connect(TargetDevice targetDevice);
    void Disconnect();
    byte[] Read();
    void Write(byte[] command);

 I want to be able to request the user for Bluetooth Access, but I do not want to program my UI specifically to Android Bluetooth, so the view and view-model should not know which intent is used, all this should be handled by the class implementing IConnectionService The issue is that it should also work for Windows Phone which do not use intents, it uses tasks, so how do I make an interface that allows me to make either a Intent request or a task request without anyone knowing what type of request is needed?

When I setup my web dev environment something goes wrong. When I imported my htdocs back, first by just fully copying them to a new fresh install of xampp and notice that all of the codes that put are not working. My CI code is displaying my PHP code in the browser. My theme in wordpress is also commenting out my PHP code when I view the source. The themes included in my fresh wordpress install works so there's something I am missing here. From the looks of it, the php is being executed properly since anything that I install works. Just that the ones that came from a previous xampp is not.

@TITLE:How do I execute an event using jQuery through an html object(button) created through Javascript?
@CONTENT:I'm just new here. So here's where I'm stuck: I created an html table using javascript. I have a button,which when clicked, will create set of tables with exactly the same structure but the objects(eg. button, text) inside those tables have different ID's. Now when I try to execute a click function using jQuery with a button on one of the produced tables, it won't work. How do I go around here? Thanks in advance! Here's a sample function which creates the html table(with unique ID's) in javascript: function CreateTables() {

    var html = ' ';
    var valPrompt = prompt("How many tables would you like to add?");
    parseInt(valPrompt);
    for (i = 1; i <= valPrompt; i++) {

        html += "<table>" + "<tr>" + "<td>" + "Text goes here" + "</td>" + "<td>" + "<input type='text' id='txtTEXT" + i + "'/>" + "</td>" + "<td>" + < input type = 'button'
        id = 'btnALERT" + i + "' / > +"</td>" + "</tr>" + "</table>"
    }
    document.getElementById('HtmlPlaceHolder').innerHTML = html;
}?
 So, if we review the code, Sets of table with buttons(btnALERT) with unique ID's will be created if the function CreateTables is executed. In order to select the objects, I suppose I'll be using jQuery. So for example, if I bind a handler in btnALERT1(produced by CreateTables) say a click function in order to alert a simple "Hello", how will I do this? My code for this doesn't seem to work: $(document).ready(function() {
    $('#btnALERT1').click(function() {
        alert("Hello");
    });
});?
@CODE:function CreateTables() {

    var html = ' ';
    var valPrompt = prompt("How many tables would you like to add?");
    parseInt(valPrompt);
    for (i = 1; i <= valPrompt; i++) {

        html += "<table>" + "<tr>" + "<td>" + "Text goes here" + "</td>" + "<td>" + "<input type='text' id='txtTEXT" + i + "'/>" + "</td>" + "<td>" + < input type = 'button'
        id = 'btnALERT" + i + "' / > +"</td>" + "</tr>" + "</table>"
    }
    document.getElementById('HtmlPlaceHolder').innerHTML = html;
}? $(document).ready(function() {
    $('#btnALERT1').click(function() {
        alert("Hello");
    });
});?

@TITLE:Update MapKit annotation subtitle and image
@CONTENT:I've searched a bit around the web and found a few ideas on how to do what I want, but I would still like to know what you think I should do. Here is the context : I'm developing an app for iOS 5. I use MapKit to display a map, and I add around 5000 annotations to it - yup, that seems a lot, but don't worry, I use a clustering library :). In order not to load them every time the user opens the map, I create them in my appDelegate (I create an array of annotations, and call [_mapView addAnnotations:[appDelegate.annotationsToAdd allObjects]]; when I open the map). It takes about roughly 10 seconds to create the annotationsToAdd array, so I think this solution is working pretty well (you have to wait for those 10 seconds before being authorized to open the map, but you only wait once, at the launch of the app). In each of those annotations, I have a "link" to an object, which contains an array of values (15 floats). For now, when I create the annotation, the subtitle method returns one of those values. In my map's ViewController, I have 2 segmented controls. The first one has 3 segments, the second one has 5, which gives 15 combinations - yup again, that's the same number of values the array of the object in my annotation has :). So you may have seen my problem coming, I would like to update the subtitle of every annotation on my map (even the ones in the clusters, as the cluster gives an average value based on the pins it holds). What I would also want is to update the annotationView's color/image based on the value of the annotation's subtitle. I may be wrong, but based on my research, I understand that you have to remove all the annotations, and recreate them all in order to do that. you understand that this is not an option in my case. I can't make the user wait 10 seconds every time he changes the value of one of the controls. I saw an article on KVO: could that be a working solution ? I don't know much about NSNotification, but should I use them ? I would really appreciate your help, and I would even more appreciate a detailed answer, showing me the steps to follow in my apparently uncommon situation. Thanks in advance.

@TITLE:SQL Server Express database size / BLOB storage
@CONTENT:I was reading about external blob storage in SQL Server and was wondering how this relates to the database size. When talking SQL Server Express, you have a limit in database size (for 2008 it's 10GB I believe). So how about your ESB storage? Is that taken into account for this limit, or does it only count the actual .mdf file itself? Thinking about it, what about the .ldf log file? I was thinking about this related to SharePoint. Since the major part of a content database usually consists of larger blob objects (documents), it could be very cost effective to move those to ESB if that saves you fullsize SQL Server licenses. Update: Posted about a possible savings option for SharePoint Foundation - SQL Express here: http://blog.repsaj.nl/index.php/2012/09/sp2010-saving-yourself-a-full-sql-license/

@CONTENT:I have a need for a listbox that scrolls horizontally and I have followed the advice from several other questions raised in regard to this as to how to implement. What I have currently does scroll horizontally, but at the end of the swipe it does not stay with where I have scrolled to, it reverts back to the original display - a bit like its a piece of elastic that pings back to its original positions after its been stretched. My listbox contains buttons and I want the user to be able to swipe the listbox, get to the button they want and then click that button.         <DataTemplate x:Key="ClassesDisplay">

@CONTENT:Let's imagine I have a user ID and username. I manually open her Facebook page (namely, http://www.facebook.com/username. And there it is! The "lives in" field appears saying she lives in wherever. Nevertheless, when I try to fetch her current_location using FQL (using Python): q = 'SELECT uid, username, current_location FROM user WHERE uid=%s' % aUser
 I get None in the field current_location. On the other hand, I can easily retrieve the current_location from my friends (I mean, for those friends who have made their location public): SELECT current_location FROM user WHERE uid IN (SELECT uid2 FROM friend WHERE uid1 = me())
 I know about the permissions, but there should be a way of fetching locations. In effect, I can see the location (lives in) of user who are not even friends of my friends. How can I do it?? Thanks in advance.

 Where NaN cells means 'empty spaces'. As you can see, A matrix was translate 4 units on x axis and 4 units on y axis, leaving NaN values. The output matrix I must be the same size like A. However, my current program don't work fine using images (It does not put 'NaN' values on empty spaces, it puts '1'): So, this is my program: function t_matrix = translate(input_matrix, dx, dy)

    [rows cols] = size(input_matrix);

    t_matrix = input_matrix;
    t_matrix(:) = NaN;

    T = [1 0 dx; 0 1 dy; 0 0 1];

    for n = 1:numel(input_matrix)


        [x y] = ind2sub([rows cols], n);

        v = [x y 1]';

        v = T*v;

        a = floor(v(1));
        b = floor(v(2));

        if a > 0 && b > 0
            t_matrix(a, b) = input_matrix(x,y);
        end
    end

    t_matrix = t_matrix(1:rows, 1:cols);
 How can I implement homogeneous transformation using matlab in a easier way? Only restriction: keep using this matrix: % for translation
T = [1 0 dx; 0 1 dy; 0 0 1];
 And keep NaN values for empty spaces.

@TITLE:Dynamically update page based on an instance variable from Ajax
@CONTENT:Update: My question was answered, but I wrote a blog post detailing exactly how I went about doing this: http://lathamcity.com/posts/ajaxInRails.html I have a page that shows a list of things based on a Ruby object. My goal is to make an Ajax call to get a new Ruby object and then update the list based on that. I thought that the way to do this was with partials. I make the entire list a partial file with the Rails instance variable in the code. Then I want the Ajax call to set the corresponding instance variable to the new list and re-render the partial. That's the end goal, but right now I'm trying to do a really basic version of that where I just set an instance variable to a string and then show the string. So in my div, I have: <% form_tag :action => :go , :method => :get, :remote => true  do %>
    <%= submit_tag "Go" %>
<% end %>

<div id="test"><%= render(:partial => 'test') %></div>
 There's a _test.erb file in the views/interface (the name of my controller) folder, with only the following line as its contents: <%= @test %>
 And then in my controller, def go
    @test = "Hello You"
    render :update do |page|
        page.replace_html "test", :partial => "test"
    end
end
 When I run this, I get: Missing template interface/update, application/update I don't know much about render :update, I found it in an example on Google. What am I doing wrong that is causing this problem and how can I fix it? Am I going about this the right way or is there a better way to do it?
@CODE:<% form_tag :action => :go , :method => :get, :remote => true  do %>

How can I make this behaviour cease ? What I would like would be to go back to activity A. The closest I could get to this was by launching activities B,C with Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NO_HISTORY. But the problem with this flag is that it prevents activities B,C from ever being re-created throughout the app's life (they should be creatable once task manager leads user to A).

@CONTENT:I am working on a GWT/AppEngine project and noticed that all my GWT java classes end up in compiled form in the WEB-INF/classes/projectpackage/client/ folder of the appcfg staging directory. Not only does this create a bunch of unwanted upload-data for every deploy, but I also really would rather not share these files with the world. Is there a way to exclude these files from the upload? A setting in Eclipse would be amazing, but, of course, an entry in appengine-web.xml would do the trick just as well...

@TITLE:One-to-may and generics: Association references unmapped class
@CONTENT:TL;DR version: The code below gives me a "Association references unmapped class" exception when building the SessionFactory. What should be changed in the code to fix it? Even though Ayende @ Rahien doesn't recommend using mappings to generic classes in this 2007 article I still had a go at it. I used the approach he mentioned. First the bit that is working: <class name="Review`1[Person]" table="Review">
  <id name="Id" column="ReviewId"><generator class="native" /></id>
  <property name="Rating" />
  <many-to-one name="Subject" column="PersonId" class="Person" />
</class>
 The corresponding generic class looks like this: public class Review<T> : BaseEntity where T : IReviewable
{
    public virtual int Rating { get; set; }
    public virtual T Subject { get; set; }
}
 This is working, and I can load these Review entities and show them in my MVC views no problem. The nice part is that my Subject will have the correct type when I use it in the controller and view. However, when trying to map a collection of Review items on my Person class things start to break down. Here's the mapping I'm currently using: <class name="Person">
  <!-- abbreviated -->
  <bag name="Reviews" table="Review">
    <key column="PersonId"/>
    <one-to-many class="Review`1[Person]" />
    <!-- Also tried these:
    <one-to-many class="table="Review"> 
    ... plus a few variations with fully qualified names ...
    -->
  </bag>
</class>
 With this (abbreviated) class: public class Person : BaseEntity, IReviewable
{
    /* Abbreviated */
    public virtual IList<Review<Person>> Reviews { get; set; }
}
 This ends with an exception while building the SessionFactory: Association references unmapped class: ....insert one-to-many.class here.... So the question: What's the problem here? Is this even possible? Should Ijust give up on mapping generic entities?
@CODE:<class name="Review`1[Person]" table="Review">
  <id name="Id" column="ReviewId"><generator class="native" /></id>
  <property name="Rating" />
  <many-to-one name="Subject" column="PersonId" class="Person" />
</class> public class Review<T> : BaseEntity where T : IReviewable
{
    public virtual int Rating { get; set; }
    public virtual T Subject { get; set; }
} Review Subject <class name="Person">
  <!-- abbreviated -->
  <bag name="Reviews" table="Review">
    <key column="PersonId"/>
    <one-to-many class="Review`1[Person]" />
    <!-- Also tried these:
    <one-to-many class="table="Review">

@TITLE:printf support for MSP430 micro-controller
@CONTENT:I am upgrading a fully tested C program for the Texas Instruments (TI) MSP430 micro-controller using a different C compiler, changing from the Quadravox, AQ430 Development Tool to the VisualGDB C compiler. The program compiles with zero errors and zero warnings with VisualGDB. The interrupt service routines, timers, UART control, and more all seem to be working. Certain uses of sprintf, however, are not working. For example: unsigned int duration;
float msec;

msec = (float)duration;

msec = msec / 125.0;

sprintf(glb_response,"break: %3.1f msec",msec);
 This returns: break: %3.1f msec This is what is expected: break: 12.5 msec I have learned about the following (from Wikipedia): The compiler option --printf_support=[full | minimal | nofloat] allows you to use a smaller, feature limited, variant of printf/sprintf, and make that choice at build time. The valid values are: full: Supports all format specifiers. This is the default. nofloat: Excludes support for printing floating point values. Supports all format specifiers except %f, %g, %G, %e, and %E. minimal: Supports the printing of integer, char, or string values without width or precision flags. Specifically, only the %%, %d, %o, %c, %s, and %x format specifiers are supported I need full support for printf. I know the MSP430 on my product will support this, as this C program has been in service for years. My problem is that I can't figure out 1) if VisualGDB has the means to set printf support to full and 2) if so, where and to set it. Any and all comments and answers will be appreciated.

@TITLE:Javascript location.host without www
@CONTENT:I have a php file which is been used to share posts of my users on Facebook and Twitter. If I click on the Twitter icon for example, I get a screen where the hyperlink to my site is automatically been written. This is good, but I like to remove the www. part of the url that is automatically shown on the Twitter screen. I guess this has something to do with location.host, so I googled, but I couldn't find a proper answer to this problem. Here is an example of my code: function e(f,i,an)
{
        with(document)
        {
                write('<div style="width:100%"><table id=m'+i+' style="visibility:hidden"><tr>');
                write('<td id="vst' + i + '" style="white-space:nowrap">&nbsp;</td>');
                write('<td hr(this.childNodes[0])" title="share on facebook"><a href="javascript:od(\'http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=' + location.host + '/e/'+ i +'\',900,400)" class=icon><img src="images/facebook.png" target="_blank"></a></td>');
        write('<td hr(this.childNodes[0])" title="share on twitter"><a href="javascript:od(\'http://twitter.com/home?status=' + location.host + '/e/'+ i +' - %20read!\',800,600)" class=icon><img src="images/twitter.png" target="_blank"></a></td>');
                write('<td class=ei><a name="cid'+i+'"></a><a href="e/'+i+'">( #'+i+' )</a></td>'); 

                  document.write('<td>&nbsp;</td>');
 My second question would be this: how can I add a custom title on the Twitter screen: for example, my websitename without having to use location.host together with the title of the TOPICNAME that is being shared?
@CODE:www. function e(f,i,an)
{
        with(document)
        {
                write('<div style="width:100%"><table id=m'+i+' style="visibility:hidden"><tr>');

                write('<td hr(this.childNodes[0])" title="share on facebook"><a href="javascript:od(\'http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=' + location.host + '/e/'+ i +'\',900,400)" class=icon><img src="images/facebook.png" target="_blank"></a></td>');

@TITLE:Crypt::OpenPGP Symkey decrypt failed: Invalid secret key ID
@CONTENT:I am having a problem where Crypt::OpenPGP is unable to decrypt a message encoded by GPG. It seems that I am not the first to have this problem. But no solution was found on that thread. my $pgp = load_class('Crypt::OpenPGP')->new;
$pgp->handle(
     Data => $encrypted,
) or confess $pgp->errstr;
 Crypt::OpenPGP prompts correctly for the key passphrase, finding the key successfully, and I'v tested to make sure the passphrase works with GPG. But when attempting to decrypt the message with Crypt::OpenPGP I get the error. Symkey decrypt failed: Invalid secret key ID according to the thread the following have been tested Encrypt with gpg and decrypt with gpg. Works fine, as expected Encrypt with perl using Crypt::OpenPGP and decrypt with gpg. Works fine. Encrypt with perl using Crypt::OpenPGP and decrypt with perl using Crypt::OpenPGP Works fine. Encrypt with gpg and decrypt with perl using Crypt::OpenPGP Failure with "Symkey decrypt failed: Invalid secret key ID" message. This is the situation described above which seems to reflect my own observation though I've not tested a few of these. Does anyone know the cause or even better a fix?

@TITLE:Recursive tree menu structure in Ext JS 4.1
@CONTENT:First of all, Im new at ExtJS. I wanted your help to let me know the best way to obtain a tree menu with n recursive items in it. In example: FOLDER ..FOLDER ....ITEM ....FOLDER ......ITEM ......ITEM ....FOLDER ... Im following the best practises proposed by Sencha. I was able to do a tree menu with one level, but when trying to do it for n levels, it fails (in fact, the app works but shows infinite nodes of 1st level). Clearly the issue is the model definition of my menu item, see: Ext.define('Dashboard.model.MenuItem',{
extend: 'Dashboard.model.AbstractMenuElement',

  fields:
  [
        {name: 'content', type: 'string'},
        {name: 'skeletonFlag', type: 'string'},
        {name: 'fatherId', type: 'int'} 
  ],


  associations:
  [
    {type: 'hasMany', model: 'Dashboard.model.MenuItem', name: 'children', mapping: 'items'}
  ]

});
 So this model recursively creates infinite nodes. But... do you know how should i model my menu item in order to achieve the recursive menu? Thanks!
@CODE:Ext.define('Dashboard.model.MenuItem',{
extend: 'Dashboard.model.AbstractMenuElement',

@TITLE:Determine 64-bit file size in C on MinGW 32-bit
@CONTENT:I'm going crazy trying to get this to work in MinGW 32-bit. It works on all other platforms I've tried. All I want to do is get the size of a > 4GB file into a 64-bit int. This works fine on other platforms: #define _FILE_OFFSET_BITS   64
#include <sys/stat.h>

int64_t fsize(const char *filename) {
    struct stat st; 

    if (stat(filename, &st) == 0)
        return st.st_size;

    return -1; 
}
 I tried adding the following defines before the above code, based on various suggestions I found online: #define _LARGEFILE_SOURCE   1
#define _LARGEFILE64_SOURCE 1
#define __USE_LARGEFILE64   1
 Also tried: #ifdef __MINGW32__
#define off_t off64_t
#endif
 And finally tried adding -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 to the gcc flags (should be the same as the above define though...) No luck. The returned int64_t is still getting truncated to a 32-bit value. What is the right way to determine a 64-bit file size in MinGW 32-bit? Thanks!

@TITLE:How do I calculate acceleration/deceleration in the direction of travel from X,Y,Z accelerometer readings from iphone
@CONTENT:I am writing an iPhone/iPad app. I need to compute the acceleration and deceleration in the direction of travel of a vehicle traveling in close to a straight horizontal line with erratic acceleration and deceleration. I have the sequence of 3 readings from the X,Y,Z orthogonal accelerometers. But the orientation of the iphone/ipad is arbitrary and the accelerometer readings include vehicle motion and the effect of gravity. The result should be a sequence of single acceleration values which are positive or negative depending on whether the vehicle is decelerating or accelerating. The positive and negative direction is arbitrary so long as acceleration has the opposite sign to deceleration. Gravity should be factored out of the result. Some amount of variable smoothing of the result would be useful. The solution should be as simple as possible and must be computationally efficient. The answer should be some kind of pseudo-code algorithm, C code or a sequence of equations which could easily be converted to C code. An iPhone specific solution in Objective C would be fine too. Thanks

@CONTENT:I'm trying to learn CXF and want to implement ws security with a simple hello world example. I followed bottom up approach to create a cxf service which is runing and I tested with soap ui. I wrote a spring client and it is working fine too. Then I tried to add the timestamp. I added the WSS4J and saaj interceptors in both server and clent spring bean config files. I followed this blog. cxf-spring-and-ws-security-putting-it I exactly followed the same steps and I added timestamp action. When I run the client I get this I get this exception org.apache.ws.security.WSSecurityException: An error was discovered processing the

 My wsdl does not have any entries concerning the security or the interceptors I added. The SOAP request is the same as the one before interceptors were added.

 I do not see any security headers in the request. So I'm getting the exception when the response is getting processed for them. What I want to get an idea is how to add security headers in the case when the web service is developed in java first approach. Thank you so much.

@LINK:/questions/12537023/hover-not-working-with-iframe-in-ie9
@TITLE:Hover not working with iFrame in IE9
@CONTENT:I'm using CSS3 MegaMenu, that uses jQuery. One of my dropdown menu items uses an iFrame to display a contact form hosted elsewhere. You can see here: http://www.deepdata.biz (it's the last item on the main nav bar to the right: 'Email') It works fine, except in IE9, the hover works to drop it down, but once the mouse enters the iFrame area, it disappears, making it impossible for the user to fill out the form. I've read that this is on purpose for security reasons- but there must be a way around it. I initially had this problem when my own form without an iFrame and by using CSShover3.htc, it worked fine in IE, so I'm fairly certain it's an iFrame issue. While searching I have read of a solution using Javascript: http://jsfiddle.net/ENXpW/3/ - but my inexperience with writing Java has hindered me from understanding it enough to adapt it to my needs. Another solution I searched for was to change the hover styling for the 'Email' link to an onClick command, but again my lack of experience with Javascript is hindering me from grasping just how I would do this. Any help would be greatly appreciated. CArRiE

 In comment in this article i saw this link - Public operator new, private operator delete: getting C2248 "can not access private member" when using new If i unserstand it correct, it doesn't compile because compiler should avoid any memory leaks in situations when there are exception thrown from constructor by calling the appropriate operator delete. But why this code compile and works? #include <cstdlib>

struct Try {
        void *operator new (size_t size) {
            return malloc(size);
        }

    private:
        void operator delete (void *obj) {
            free(obj);
        }
};

int main () {
    Try *t = new Try;

    return 0;
}
 Is it correct by standard or not? And what about this code? #include <cstdlib>

struct Try {
        void *operator new (size_t size) {
            return malloc(size);
        }

    private:
        void operator delete (void *obj) {
            free(obj);
        }
};

int main () {
    Try *t = new Try();

    return 0;
}
 It doesn't compile with gcc 4.7.1. And how things like this should be implemented in the standard library? Comeau doesn't compile all these examples: "ComeauTest.c", line 15: error: function "Try::operator delete"
(declared at line 9) is inaccessible Try *t = new Try; ^
 Can anyone explain me this in detail, please?

@TITLE:unable to use taskkill.exe from a java process
@CONTENT:I need to kill an external process on windows (WindowsXP 32bit) from my integration test. I thought I'd just use 'taskkill.exe' but I cannot seem to get it working. Basically, every time I kick off a 'taskkill.exe' process from java it returns exit value -1073741515, nothing is printed to std error/output. To reproduce the problem I wrote this simple application: public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    ProcessBuilder builder = new ProcessBuilder();
    //In my real code, I kill process by its pid. However below also shows the problem:
    builder.command("taskkill.exe", "/?");
    builder.redirectErrorStream(true);
    Process p = builder.start();
    BufferedReader r = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(p.getInputStream()));
    String line = r.readLine();
    System.out.println("out:");
    while(line != null) {
        System.out.println(line);
        line = r.readLine();
    }
    System.out.println(p.waitFor());
}
 More data points: -1073741515 apparently means "The application failed to initialize properly". Not very helpful for me though ;) I've tried bunch of combinations of taskkill.exe parameters; I've tried prefixing the command with 'cmd', '/c'. Symptoms are exactly the same I tried executing other windows programs that live under windows\system32 and I also get -10737... Executing things like 'dir' or 'echo' works ok. Any hints on what might be the problem?

 An option I am looking at would be change the highLightThumb method to check if the CTRL or Shift Key is selected and not disable the highlights  if (Control.ModifierKeys != Keys.Control)
 //**
 if (Control.ModifierKeys != Keys.Shift)
 Then change the DragDrop DragEnter Routine. Any Help would be greatly appreciated.

@TITLE:Ajax AutoCompleteExtender X styling individual items?
@CONTENT:Short version: I want to know how I can change the css style of individual items generated by an autocompleteextender, but the control only allows me to set the styling of all items as a group. Long version: I have a search box that utilizes an AutoCompleteExtender.

 The AutoCompleteExtender has a property to assign a CSS class to every item, CompletionListItemCssClass and CompletionListHighlightedItemCssClass for the highlighted item. What I want to know is how I can individually style specific items based on certain criteria. In my service, I'm running a stored procedure, manipulating the results a bit, then returning a string array back to the autocompleteextender. I have that stored procedure set up to include a certain flag with each record.. I want to use that flag to highlight certain rows of the search results (turn the text red, for example). How can I do this? I can't seem to find any way to access individual items to change their styling. I've been searching all over for help and am coming up empty handed. Thank you.

@TITLE:Showing graphical instead of strings in an imagelist with title
@CONTENT:At the moment I am getting items out of my database and add them to a string called result which I return and set to my TextView: protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    // TODO Auto-generated method stub
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.level);
    loadDataBase();

}
 The thing is, all these items also have a title(string) and graphical thumb (string) in the database. I would like to show them as illustrated in the picture below, each with an onclicklistener on it, instead of a boring list of items below eachother. Each item has a picture and title. Since my beginning programming skills, I am wondering how to do this best, and if you know any good tutorials on it which explain it well? Thanks!

I got this error also with Jboss 7.1.1 and 7.1.0 so I thought reverting to an older and more stable version would do the trick, but with no use. Below is the problem - the LogManager was not properly installed. I have not deployed anything that might use the logger or anything, I just run standalone.bat after a clean install and restart. I found this issue but it seems to be resolved... The funny thing is, I was able to start it from Eclipse (both Indigo and Juno EE version). Any clue? Thanks

@CONTENT:I'm at the start of developing a Rails engine (and gem) that should provide many small helper functions that generate HTML for views. Now I wonder whether it's advisable to rely on the use of many nested content_tag calls to generate the HTML, or if it's more pragmatic to just rely on partials. In my opinion, the first approach may be a bit cleaner (but slower in performance), but the 2nd approach seems much easier to do, so I guess I will favor the 2nd one. What do you guys think?

@LINK:/questions/12528184/qtimer-becomes-faster-with-each-start-stop
@TITLE:QTimer becomes faster with each start/stop
@CONTENT:I'm using a QTimer to smoothly change the size of a label: it should slowly grow when I hover the mouse over a button, and slowly collapse (decrease it's size until it dissapears) when the mouse leaves the button. I have two timers in my form's class: QTimer oTimer, cTimer;//oTimer for expanding, cTimer for collapsing
 In my form's constructor, I'm setting the timer's values and connecting the button's mouseOver and mouseOut signals to my form's slots: oTimer.setInterval( 25 );
cTimer.setInterval( 25 );

connect( ui.Button, 
         SIGNAL(mouseEntered(QString)), 
         this, 
         SLOT(expandHorizontally(QString)) );
connect( ui.Button, 
         SIGNAL(mouseLeft(QString)), 
         this, 
         SLOT(compactHorizontally(QString)) );
 Now, in these slots I connect the corresponding timer to a slot that will gradually change the size, and then I start the timer: void cForm::expandHorizontally(const QString & str)
{
    ui.Text->setText( str ); 
    connect( &oTimer, SIGNAL(timeout()), this, SLOT(increaseHSize()) );
    cTimer.stop();//if the label is collapsing at the moment, stop it
    disconnect( &cTimer, SIGNAL(timeout()) );
    oTimer.start();//start expanding
}

void cForm::compactHorizontally(const QString &)
{
    connect( &cTimer, SIGNAL(timeout()), this, SLOT(decreaseHSize()) );
    oTimer.stop();
    disconnect( &oTimer, SIGNAL(timeout()) );
    cTimer.start();
}
 After that, the label starts changing it's size: void cForm::increaseHSize()
{
    if( ui.Text->width() < 120 )
    {
        //increase the size a bit if it hasn't reached the bound yet
        ui.Text->setFixedWidth( ui.Text->width() + 10 );
    }
    else
    {
        ui.Text->setFixedWidth( 120 );//Set the desired size
        oTimer.stop();//stop the timer
        disconnect( &oTimer, SIGNAL(timeout()) );//disconnect the timer's signal
    }
}

void cForm::decreaseHSize()
{
    if( ui.Text->width() > 0 )
    {
        ui.Text->setFixedWidth( ui.Text->width() - 10 );
    }
    else
    {
        ui.Text->setFixedWidth( 0 );
        cTimer.stop();
        disconnect( &cTimer, SIGNAL(timeout()) );
    }
}
 The problem: Everything works smoothly at first, the label slowly opens and closes. However, if it does so a couple of times, it starts changing the size faster and faster each time (just as if the timer's interval was getting smaller and smaller, but it obviously isn't). Eventually after a couple of openings/closes it just begins to immediately increase it's size up to the bound when I hover the mouse over the button, and immediately collapse to the zero size when the mouse goes away from the button. What could be the reason for that?
@CODE:QTimer QTimer oTimer, cTimer;//oTimer for expanding, cTimer for collapsing mouseOver mouseOut oTimer.setInterval( 25 );
cTimer.setInterval( 25 );

connect( ui.Button, 
         SIGNAL(mouseEntered(QString)), 
         this, 
         SLOT(expandHorizontally(QString)) );
connect( ui.Button, 
         SIGNAL(mouseLeft(QString)), 
         this, 
         SLOT(compactHorizontally(QString)) ); void cForm::expandHorizontally(const QString & str)
{
    ui.Text->setText( str ); 
    connect( &oTimer, SIGNAL(timeout()), this, SLOT(increaseHSize()) );
    cTimer.stop();//if the label is collapsing at the moment, stop it
    disconnect( &cTimer, SIGNAL(timeout()) );
    oTimer.start();//start expanding
}

@LINK:/questions/12528184/qtimer-becomes-faster-with-each-start-stop
@TITLE:QTimer becomes faster with each start/stop
@CONTENT:I'm using a QTimer to smoothly change the size of a label: it should slowly grow when I hover the mouse over a button, and slowly collapse (decrease it's size until it dissapears) when the mouse leaves the button. I have two timers in my form's class: QTimer oTimer, cTimer;//oTimer for expanding, cTimer for collapsing
 In my form's constructor, I'm setting the timer's values and connecting the button's mouseOver and mouseOut signals to my form's slots: oTimer.setInterval( 25 );
cTimer.setInterval( 25 );

connect( ui.Button, 
         SIGNAL(mouseEntered(QString)), 
         this, 
         SLOT(expandHorizontally(QString)) );
connect( ui.Button, 
         SIGNAL(mouseLeft(QString)), 
         this, 
         SLOT(compactHorizontally(QString)) );
 Now, in these slots I connect the corresponding timer to a slot that will gradually change the size, and then I start the timer: void cForm::expandHorizontally(const QString & str)
{
    ui.Text->setText( str ); 
    connect( &oTimer, SIGNAL(timeout()), this, SLOT(increaseHSize()) );
    cTimer.stop();//if the label is collapsing at the moment, stop it
    disconnect( &cTimer, SIGNAL(timeout()) );
    oTimer.start();//start expanding
}

void cForm::compactHorizontally(const QString &)
{
    connect( &cTimer, SIGNAL(timeout()), this, SLOT(decreaseHSize()) );
    oTimer.stop();
    disconnect( &oTimer, SIGNAL(timeout()) );
    cTimer.start();
}
 After that, the label starts changing it's size: void cForm::increaseHSize()
{
    if( ui.Text->width() < 120 )
    {
        //increase the size a bit if it hasn't reached the bound yet
        ui.Text->setFixedWidth( ui.Text->width() + 10 );
    }
    else
    {
        ui.Text->setFixedWidth( 120 );//Set the desired size
        oTimer.stop();//stop the timer
        disconnect( &oTimer, SIGNAL(timeout()) );//disconnect the timer's signal
    }
}

void cForm::decreaseHSize()
{
    if( ui.Text->width() > 0 )
    {
        ui.Text->setFixedWidth( ui.Text->width() - 10 );
    }
    else
    {
        ui.Text->setFixedWidth( 0 );
        cTimer.stop();
        disconnect( &cTimer, SIGNAL(timeout()) );
    }
}
 The problem: Everything works smoothly at first, the label slowly opens and closes. However, if it does so a couple of times, it starts changing the size faster and faster each time (just as if the timer's interval was getting smaller and smaller, but it obviously isn't). Eventually after a couple of openings/closes it just begins to immediately increase it's size up to the bound when I hover the mouse over the button, and immediately collapse to the zero size when the mouse goes away from the button. What could be the reason for that?
@CODE:QTimer QTimer oTimer, cTimer;//oTimer for expanding, cTimer for collapsing mouseOver mouseOut oTimer.setInterval( 25 );
cTimer.setInterval( 25 );

connect( ui.Button, 
         SIGNAL(mouseEntered(QString)), 
         this, 
         SLOT(expandHorizontally(QString)) );
connect( ui.Button, 
         SIGNAL(mouseLeft(QString)), 
         this, 
         SLOT(compactHorizontally(QString)) ); void cForm::expandHorizontally(const QString & str)
{
    ui.Text->setText( str ); 
    connect( &oTimer, SIGNAL(timeout()), this, SLOT(increaseHSize()) );
    cTimer.stop();//if the label is collapsing at the moment, stop it
    disconnect( &cTimer, SIGNAL(timeout()) );
    oTimer.start();//start expanding
}

void cForm::compactHorizontally(const QString &)
{
    connect( &cTimer, SIGNAL(timeout()), this, SLOT(decreaseHSize()) );
    oTimer.stop();
    disconnect( &oTimer, SIGNAL(timeout()) );
    cTimer.start();
} void cForm::increaseHSize()
{
    if( ui.Text->width() < 120 )
    {
        //increase the size a bit if it hasn't reached the bound yet
        ui.Text->setFixedWidth( ui.Text->width() + 10 );
    }
    else
    {
        ui.Text->setFixedWidth( 120 );//Set the desired size
        oTimer.stop();//stop the timer
        disconnect( &oTimer, SIGNAL(timeout()) );//disconnect the timer's signal
    }
}

@TITLE:Targeting Flash Player 11.2 - 11.4 APIs with the OpenLaszlo SWF11 runtime
@CONTENT:I've read here that there is an OpenLaszlo version capable of compiling LZX into SWF11 files for Flash Player 11.1. The SDK included with the flex4.6 branch of OpenLaszlo is - as we can tell by the name - Flex SDK 4.6. In another discussion on the Flash context menu in OpenLaszlo it was mentioned that it is possible to target Flash Player APIs higher than 11.1 with the flex4.6 branch of OpenLaszlo. What changes would have to be made the the flex4.6 branch to achieve this? Does that involve changing Java code within the LPS?

@LINK:/questions/12526889/verifying-qunits-results-with-zombie-js
@TITLE:Verifying Qunit's results with Zombie.js
@CONTENT:I am doing test-driven development with Qunit: when creating a new function, I write tests for it, create the function, reload the page, and if all the tests pass I move on... Whilst this works fine at the beginning, it starts to become a time consuming process after a while as all the tests take several seconds to run, and that's the time I have to wait for every time I refresh my browser. In an attempt to workaround that problem, I thought about introducing Zombie.js to perform head-less testing: the idea is to have Zombie.js continuously check the webpage (e.g. $ watch -n1 "node queryTheWebpage.js") and report to me Qunits's results while coding (once in a while, as Zombie.js isn't a "real" browser, I would open up a browser and check the page manually to validate). So far here is what I have for my node/Zombie piece of code: browser.visit("http://localhost/mywebpage.html", function () {
        var qunit_tests = browser.query('body');
        console.log(qunit_tests.innerHTML);
});
 In the console output I do see the Qunit tests container <ol id="qunit-tests"></ol> but it is empty which means when the visit callback function is called, the tests haven't run. I've tried to use the wait function to wait for the tests to run, but unsuccessfully: function waitForQunitToEnd(window) {
    var last = window.document.querySelector('selectorOfMyLastTest');
    var first_failed = window.document.querySelector('li.failed');
    return (last || first_failed);
}

browser.visit("http://localhost/mywebpage.html", function () {
    browser.wait(waitForQunitToEnd, function() {
        var qunit_tests = browser.query('body');
        console.log(qunit_tests.innerHTML); // still gives me empty <ol id="qunit-tests"></ol>
    });    
});
 I tried to play with the waitFor option (e.g. set to 5000ms) but that didn't help either. Q1: Is what I'm trying to do making sense, or is there a much simpler way of doing something similar? Q2: Do you know how I could get Zombie.js to wait for the Qunit tests to run?
@CODE:Qunit Zombie.js Zombie.js $ watch -n1 "node queryTheWebpage.js" Qunits Zombie.js browser.visit("http://localhost/mywebpage.html", function () {
        var qunit_tests = browser.query('body');
        console.log(qunit_tests.innerHTML);
}); Qunit <ol id="qunit-tests"></ol> visit wait function waitForQunitToEnd(window) {
    var last = window.document.querySelector('selectorOfMyLastTest');
    var first_failed = window.document.querySelector('li.failed');
    return (last || first_failed);
}

browser.visit("http://localhost/mywebpage.html", function () {
    browser.wait(waitForQunitToEnd, function() {
        var qunit_tests = browser.query('body');
        console.log(qunit_tests.innerHTML); // still gives me empty <ol id="qunit-tests"></ol>
    });

@TITLE:Custom Excel VBA Function (Modified VLOOKUP) from Cell referring to a range in different file gives an error
@CONTENT:First time I'm writing a stackOverflow question so please let me know if I do anything wrong. I've searched for a few hours now and haven't been able to find a solution to my problem (usually I find the answer hence why this is my first question after using stackoverflow for a few years as a lurker). Basically I'm trying to write a modified VLOOKUP function that functions similar to VLOOKUP except it return the "next smallest larger" value instead of the default "previous largest smaller" value. I'm aware of the index/match method unfortunately I would need to carefully replace literally thousands of VLOOKUPs manually that already exist in the workbook I'm currently cleaning up at work. Therefore I resorted to writing a VLOOKUPnew function so I could just "find/replace" all the VLOOKUP with VLOOKUPnew. Function VLOOKUPnew(lookup_value As Variant, table_array As Range, _
        col_index_num As Integer, Optional exactMatch As Boolean) As Variant
    Dim row As Integer

    Debug.Print table_array.Address

    With Application
        On Error GoTo NO_ROW
        row = .Match(lookup_value, table_array.Columns(1), 0)
        On Error GoTo 0

        If row = -1 And Not exactMatch Then
            row = .Match(lookup_value, table_array.Columns(1), 1)
            row = row + 1
        End If

        VLOOKUPnew = .index(table_array.Columns(col_index_num), row, 0)
    End With

Exit Function

NO_ROW:
    row = -1
    Resume Next
End Function
 And I succeeding in writing the function but hit a snag. Because I declared "table_array" as a Range, vba fails to identify range references to other workbooks e.g. "=VLOOKUPnew($A432,'reallyLongFilepath/[filename.xlsx]tablename'!$B$6:$N$35,columnNumber,0),FALSE)" resolves to a #VALUE error The really weird thing is that if I open the file, then the filepath drops out of the formula (becoming just "=VLOOKUPnew($A432,'[filename.xlsx]tablename'!$B$6:$N$35,columnNumber,0),FALSE)") and then my custom function works just fine returning the correct value. So my problem is how do I resolve not having to open the other file to use this workbook. I'm not even sure how Excel is passing the address or range to the custom formula so I'm suspecting it's breaking when the filepath is included in the range reference. Is there a way to split the filepath, filename, sheet and address (after it has been passed in)? Or possibly pass it in as a string then easily split it? Or pass it in as something that will correctly identify the range in the different workbook? Keep in mind that I'm trying to avoid changing the arguments of the function because I want to do the find/replace trick and that this is for work so there's a restraint on too much change in data layout. Also that the workbook is for other employees to use and I'm just setting it up for use. Thanks in advance! Andrew

 Bellow are unclear areas for me. How Zend_Db_Table_Abstract Maintain database connections? Is it creating new connection all the time when I call this function or Does it have some connection pooling? I didn't write any coding to open or close database connection. So will zend framework automatically close connections? If this open and close connection works all the time if I execute this function, Is there any performance issue? Thank you and appreciate your suggestions and opinion on this.

@LINK:/questions/12522858/implementing-a-qhash-like-lookup-with-multiple-keys
@TITLE:Implementing a QHash-like lookup with multiple keys
@CONTENT:I'm trying to find the best way to implement a QHash-like lookup table that uses multiple keys to return one value. I have read that the Boost library has similar functionality, but I would like to avoid this if possible. An example of what I would like to do is as follows (obviously the following pseudo-code is not possible): //First key (int) - Engine cylinders
//Second key (int) - Car weight
//Value (int) - Top speed
MyLookup<int, int, int> m_Lookup
m_Lookup.insert(6, 1000, 210);
m_Lookup.insert(6, 1500, 190);
m_Lookup.value(6, 1000); //Returns 210
 My first (and extremely slow) idea was to just create a Struct, and iterate over a list until I find a qualifying item. Struct Vehicle {
   int cyl;
   int weight;
   int speed'
}

QList<Vehicle> carList; //Assume this is populated
for(i = 0; i < carList.length; ++i) { 
if(carList[i].cyl == 6 && carList[i].weight == 1000) {
return carList[i].speed; } }
 My other idea was to concatenate the two keys into one key, and implement a couple functions to combine and separate the two keys when needed. While this would work, and probably be a lot faster than a full iteration, it seems a bit hacked together. QHash<QString, int> m_Lookup;
m_Lookup.insert("6|1000", 210);
 Does anyone know of a better way to try and achieve this?
@CODE://First key (int) - Engine cylinders
//Second key (int) - Car weight
//Value (int) - Top speed
MyLookup<int, int, int> m_Lookup
m_Lookup.insert(6, 1000, 210);
m_Lookup.insert(6, 1500, 190);
m_Lookup.value(6, 1000); //Returns 210 Struct Vehicle {
   int cyl;
   int weight;
   int speed'
}

for(i = 0; i < carList.length; ++i) { 
if(carList[i].cyl == 6 && carList[i].weight == 1000) {

@TITLE:MVC3 Razor Ajax.ActionLink won't use POST method
@CONTENT:I've got a page that contains multiple links. These links should do an ajax post and callback. However, the link is doing a Get instead of a Post. This causes a 404 error since I do not have an action method to handle a get at the requested URL. If I remove the HTTPPost attribute from my Action method, the link works, but the call back fails and the Json I return is rendered in a new page. Here is the code I'm using in my view. <td id="action-@item.ItemID">@Ajax.ActionLink("Add", "AddToOrder", new { itemID = item.ItemID }, new AjaxOptions { HttpMethod = "POST", OnSuccess = "actionCompleted" }, new { id = "add-" + item.ItemID })</td>
 This ends up adding this HTML:  <td id="action-012679"><a data-ajax="true" data-ajax-method="POST" data-ajax-success="actionCompleted" href="/mysite/neworder/AddToOrder?itemID=012679" id="add-012679">Add to Order</a></td>
 My Controller has the following Action Method. [HttpPost]
public JsonResult AddToOrder(string itemID) {
    return Json(new { id = itemID, Action = "Added", "Just getting this working"});
}
 My callback method that is called on Success looks like this: <script language="javascript" type="text/javascript">        
    function actionCompleted(response, status, data) {
        alert("We have returned");
    }

</script>
 If I change the [HTTPPost] attribute on my action method to [HTTPGet] I get an Json error. I can fix this by adding the JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet to my return value, but this doesn't use the call back function defined on the page and fails. Any help would be appreciated.

 Maybe because the first task is doing so much extra work than the other thread that's why everything as a whole will finish faster if I set the second method a low priority. Anyways now my question is The startProcessingItems runs with ThreadPriority = Lowest. How could I change it's priority to highest? If I create a new Task in that method will it be running with low priority? Basically the startProcessingItems ends with a list and once it has that list I will like to start executing with highest priority.

There is a PHP file as well (see at bottom) but I don't think that it is the issue. I have tried several variations and I am ending up with <img src="undefined" alt="image"> This is what the log is saying TypeError: 'undefined' is not an object (evaluating '$item.find('media\\:content').attr('url').text') Here is an example of the XML from the RSS feed (I am trying to grab what is in url="this value") <media:content url="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2011/11/30/technology/bits-daily-report/bits-daily-report-thumbStandard.jpg" medium="image" width="75" height="75"></media:content> Here is my HTML with jQuery Embeded.

I can add the OpenGl and GLUT frameworks very easily but I cant find any glew frameworks or something similar. Main problem is that one of my files has #include GL/glew.h and it cant find it.

@TITLE:PyRun_String stop sending result to stdout after any error
@CONTENT:I'm writing a Python terminal GUI in C++. I'm using the following code to run a user-typed Python command-line: void RunTerminalCommand (char * line) 
{

    PyObject *py_main, *py_dict;
    py_main = PyImport_AddModule("__main__");
    py_dict = PyModule_GetDict(py_main);
    PyObject * PyRes = PyRun_String(line, Py_single_input, py_dict, py_dict);

    return 0;
}
 It works very well, with the command line being executed and the result being printed on the output window via stdout. But whenever the Python command line leads to a Python error, it stops working: My stdout doesn't receive any data Notes: PyRes always returns NULL, even before the error line is injected I don't know if I should call PyImport_AddModule every time. But it seems to work this way. If I use PyRun_SimpleString(line) insted of PyRun_String(line, Py_single_input, py_dict, py_dict), it always work, and I still get the Error messages via stdout/stderr. But this call doesn't send the result of command line evaluatiosn to stdout, so I don't want to use it. For example, the command line "2+2" will print "4" on stdout when I use PyRun_String, but not when I use PyRun_SimpleString.
@CODE:void RunTerminalCommand (char * line) 
{

    PyObject *py_main, *py_dict;
    py_main = PyImport_AddModule("__main__");
    py_dict = PyModule_GetDict(py_main);

@TITLE:Entity Framework: combining exact and wildcard searching conditional on search term
@CONTENT:I'm creating a query to search the db using EF. TdsDb being the EF context. string searchValue = "Widget";
TdsDb tdsDb = new TdsDb();
IQueryable<Counterparty> counterparties;
 I can do exact match: counterparties = tdsDb.Counterparties.Where(x => x.CounterpartyName == searchValue);
 or wildcard match: counterparties = tdsDb.Counterparties.Where(x => x.CounterpartyName.Contains(searchValue));
 But I want to be able to do both i.e. (psudo code) counterparties = tdsDb.Counterparties.Where(x => 
          if (searchValue.EndsWith("%")) 
                 {
                      if (searchValue.StartsWith("%"))
                          {x.CounterpartyName.Contains(searchValue)}
                      else 
                          {x.CounterpartyName.StartsWith(searchValue)}
                 }   
          else
                 {x => x.CounterpartyName == searchValue}
      );
 Now clearly I can't put an if statement in the where clause like that. But I also can't duplicate the queries: shown here they are hugely dumbed down. The production query is far longer, so having multiple versions of the same long query that vary on only one clause seems very unhealthy and unmaintainable. Any ideas?
@CODE:string searchValue = "Widget";
TdsDb tdsDb = new TdsDb();
IQueryable<Counterparty> counterparties; counterparties = tdsDb.Counterparties.Where(x => x.CounterpartyName == searchValue); counterparties = tdsDb.Counterparties.Where(x => x.CounterpartyName.Contains(searchValue)); counterparties = tdsDb.Counterparties.Where(x => 
          if (searchValue.EndsWith("%")) 
                 {
                      if (searchValue.StartsWith("%"))
                          {x.CounterpartyName.Contains(searchValue)}
                      else 
                          {x.CounterpartyName.StartsWith(searchValue)}

          else

@TITLE:Can I install a file using Izpack 5 without it being part of the install.jar built by izpack
@CONTENT:My installation widget.zip zipfile contains the following: 32bitJava install.jar widgetinstaller.exe widgetinstaller.ini widgetinstaller.ico To summarize: 32bitJava is a 32bit JRE downloaded from Oracle install.jar is the installer created by Izpack widgetinstaller.* are created by winrun4j providing an exe wrapper for the installer. So with this setup I can install my application without user having to have a java runtime already installed. However once installed the actual application also needs a java runtime to actually run. So at the moment a copy of 32bitJava is included as part of the izpack install, i.e it exists in install.jar and is installed at installation time. But this means I have two copies of the JVM, and because the 32bitJava is larger than my actual application makes my download much too large. So how can I copy the 32bitJava folder into the installation during/after installation instead of having to include it in install.jar ?

 I want to know because from my reading of the documentation mktime should create a timestamp just as valid as say strtotime or DateTime. Indeed using class DateTime method getTimestamp 28/10/2012 = 1351378800 29/10/2012 = 1351468800 an increment of 90000 So once again an hour has been added implying that I am correct in this assumption. Obviously the class can deal with this. BUT no where up until this point has there been any mention of the fact that incrementing a timestamp however it is generated could result in an issue... thus making the use of the DateTime class or another approach mandatory to avoid issues such as have been encountered. If I have to convert the code you use the class so be it. But I would like to know why this is necessary.

@TITLE:How to reduce SSRS PDF Export Size
@CONTENT:I have a SSRS report that is Exported to PDF. The report has one table with 2 lines. (A header with no formatting and one record). The PDF export that is created is 130K. I am sure that this is much larger than it needs to be. Is there any way to reduce the size of the created PDFs from SSRS? Or any issues that can bloat a PDF from SSRS that I should be aware of?

@TITLE:Performance issues with HTML5 mobile game
@CONTENT:We start developing a simple mobile game with HTML5 but we're having second thoughts about our decision. When we've added some simple animations using CSS3, these animations work very slowly to not at all on some android devices, and on iOS they run faster but not fast enough. Do you think there's a way to dramatically improve (simple) graphic performance on HTML5? We're a bit confused now, as much as we'd hate to lose all the work we've put in this so far, it's better to stop now than in a month or two. The app we're developing is similar in style to Song Pop and now that we know that they have developed their apps (iOS, Android and facebook) using Adobe AIR, we were thinking that might be an alternative. I wanted to ask you if you think we need to abandon HTML5 and develop the game using Adobe AIR or maybe go native (something we're really trying to avoid as we want to launch on all platforms within a reasonable time)?

@TITLE:Rounding numpy float array read from img with python, values returned not rounded
@CONTENT:Simple rounding of a floating point numpy array seems not working for some reason.. I get numpy array from reading a huge img (shape of (7352, 7472)). Ex values: >>> imarray[3500:3503, 5000:5003]
array([[ 73.33999634,  73.40000153,  73.45999908],
       [ 73.30999756,  73.37999725,  73.43000031],
       [ 73.30000305,  73.36000061,  73.41000366]], dtype=float32)
 And for rounding I've been just trying to use numpy.around() for the raw value, also writing values to a new array, a copie of raw array, but for some reason no results.. arr=imarray
numpy.around(imarray, decimals=3, out=arr)
arr[3500,5000] #results in 73.3399963379, as well as accessing imarray
 So, even higher precision!!! Is that because of such big array? I need to round it to get the most frequent value (mode), and I'm searching the vay to avoid more and more libraries..
@CODE:>>> imarray[3500:3503, 5000:5003]

@CONTENT:I am very new with emacs and Lisp, though from experience with other functional languages it's not too hard for me to mimic what I am seeing in useful code snippets. I've added some nice window toggling features in the .emacs file and they are working well. But on start-up, I'd like to configure a specific arrangement of windows/frames. Basically, I want to do the following each time I launch emacs (which is generally at most once per day and then it is left open for days/weeks). 1. Split the screen in half (C-x 2)
2. Grow the top half bigger by 20 lines (C-u 20 C-x ^)
3. Open a second frame of emacs (C-x 5 2)
 Ideally, I'd even like to maximize the first frame on my left monitor and the second frame on my right monitor, but I can do without that. I am just wondering how you write the function equivalent of the key commands into the .emacs file.

@LINK:/questions/12511325/php-incrementing-time-stamp-error
@TITLE:php incrementing time stamp error?
@CONTENT:I have a pagination function which pages through a time table and advances the dates on a weekly basis and displays the details relevant to the new dates. Whilst testing some new data I encountered a paging problem. In that it would not page passed 22/10/2012. Debugging the code I eventually found the source of the problem which is that incrementing the date stamp representing 22/10/2012 by 7 days returned (via strftime) a date of 28/10/2012 when obviously I was expecting a date of the 29/10/2012. This error effectively causing a continuous loop as %W (which drives the weekly pagination) is 43 for 22/10/2012 and 43 for 28/10/2012 and of course it should be 44 for 29/10/2012. In a quick test to isolate and recreate this problem I used the following: /*
 * test %W
 */

$time_Stamp_1 = mktime(0,0,0,10,22,2012);
echo "date : " . strftime("%d/%m/%Y", $time_Stamp_1);
echo "W for first time stamp " . $time_Stamp_1 . " is " . strftime("%W", $time_Stamp_1); 

$time_Stamp_1a = $time_Stamp_1 += (60 * 60 * 24 * 7);
echo "new date : " . strftime("%d/%m/%Y", $time_Stamp_1a);
echo "W for new date time stamp: " . strftime("%W", $time_Stamp_1a);

$time_Stamp_2 = mktime(0,0,0,10,29,2012);
echo "W for second time stamp: " . strftime("%W", $time_Stamp_2);
 The pagination happily moves between all the other weeks I have tested and obviously uses this increment / decrement as appropriate. Hopefully I am missing something obvious. Any thoughts?
@CODE:/*
 * test %W
 */

$time_Stamp_1 = mktime(0,0,0,10,22,2012);
echo "date : " . strftime("%d/%m/%Y", $time_Stamp_1);
echo "W for first time stamp " . $time_Stamp_1 . " is " . strftime("%W", $time_Stamp_1); 

$time_Stamp_1a = $time_Stamp_1 += (60 * 60 * 24 * 7);
echo "new date : " . strftime("%d/%m/%Y", $time_Stamp_1a);
echo "W for new date time stamp: " . strftime("%W", $time_Stamp_1a);

$time_Stamp_2 = mktime(0,0,0,10,29,2012);

@TITLE:still not find package, after 'mvn install'
@CONTENT:I'm trying to use Google protocol buffer for Java(I'm a newbie about Java, just trying). First of all, I'm using OSX and I've installed protocol buffer with brew install protobuf command. protoc command works okay. I've generated MyProtocol.java by protoc. I've installed protocol buffer for Java as its instruction(README.txt). mvn install command created .m2 directory and I can find protobuf-java-2.4.1.jar file somewhere in the directory. I wrote simple test Java code just importing MyProtocol.java and it complains could not find package com.google.protobuf. So, I've just make jar file mvn package and add its directory as CLASSPATH and it compiled well. javac -classpath <protobuf-dir>/jara/target/classes Test.java ./com/example/tutorial/AddressBookProtos.java
 If I use maven's repository directory (~/.m2/repository), it complains again. Doesn't maven make CLASSPATH for me if I install the package? If not, how can I use installed package by maven to compile my code?

@TITLE:How to set focus on element after server side validation - MVC 3
@CONTENT:Good morning one and all. For one reason or another, I have a layer of server side validation on a model's dropdown list:  public IEnumerable<ValidationResult> Validate(ValidationContext validationContext)
    {
        if (SomethingVisible && DropDownListSelection == 0)
        {
            yield return new ValidationResult("Please make a selection", new[] { "DropDownListSelectionId"});
        }
    }


<div class="editor-field">
                            @Html.DropDownListFor(x => x.DropDownListSelectionId, new SelectList(Model.DropDownListSelection, "DropDownListSelectionId", "DropDownListSelectionName"))
                            <br />
                            @Html.ValidationMessageFor(model => model.DropDownListSelectionId)
                        </div>
 This works fine and dandy and shows the appropriate validation error when !Model.IsValid. Lovely. However, as some such forms can be quite tall (I know, I know, nasty) and this validation can go missing i.e. you have to scroll down to see the validation error, some people won't like to scroll. As such, what I would like to do is use jquery/javascript to set focus on the element that is validated, how would I go about doing this? Apologies for the thick question.

@LINK:/questions/12508473/ibm-mq-xms-subscription-not-closing
@TITLE:IBM MQ XMS subscription not closing
@CONTENT:I have an application that uses WebSphere MQ to send data through WebSphere to a datacentre in the Cloud. Part of the functionality is that if the server-side subscriber detects that a message has not been received for 30 minutes, the thread is paused for 5 minutes, and the connection is removed. When it restarts, it reconnects. In practice, I've found that disconnecting has not removed the subscription. When attempting to reconnect, I see this error: "There may have been a problem creating the subscription due to it being used by another message consumer. Make sure any message consumers using this subscription are closed before trying to create a new subscription under the same name. Please see the linked exception for more information." This shows the message handler is still connected, meaning disconnect has failed. Disconnect code for the XmsClient object (part of the library, although one of my colleagues might have changed it) is: public override void Disconnect()
        {
            _producer.Close();
            _producer.Dispose();
            _producer = null;
            _consumer.MessageListener = null;
            _consumer.Close();
            _consumer.Dispose();
            _consumer = null;
            _sessionRead.Close();
            _sessionRead.Dispose();
            _sessionRead = null;
            _sessionWrite.Close();
            _sessionWrite.Dispose();
            _sessionWrite = null;
            _connection.Stop();
            _connection.Close();
            _connection.Dispose();
            _connection = null;

            //GC.Collect();



            IsConnected = false;
        }
 Anyone have any thoughts as to why the connection still exists?

 here's the XML file <items>

 the value like 100 and 200 change every 5 seconds here's I tried the code but I failed. ListAdapter adapter = new SimpleAdapter(Activity.this, menuItems,

@TITLE:Algorithm - matching student examination centers
@CONTENT:I have a problem of grouping the students to the nearest examination center. Here are the conditions/constraints: There are X students and Y examination centers. Each center will hold a different number of students. The maximum capacity of the total of examination centers can be greater than the number of students, but not smaller. A student can have the smallest distance to more than 1 examination center. The examination will hold at the same time for all examination centers. For example, there are 11500 students and 15 examination centers. 5 centers (1 to 5) will hold 1500 students, 3 for 600 (6 to 8) and the other 7 (9 to 15) will hold 350 students. I have developed the followings: A database table with the student's location (register address) to each of the examination centers. Something like below Student ID  Dist-Ex1  Dist-Ex2 ... Dist-Ex14  Dist-Ex15
1            10         70            20         50
2            25         43            5          105
...
11499        35         12             35         55
11500        5          23              5         5
 I can add a column of storing the nearest examination center to each of the student, and create a table like below: Ex centers           Nearest for no. of students
1                     2000
2                      500
...
14                     150
15                     500
 But I don't know how to further proceed. I believe it is some kind of algorithm problem. I would be grateful if anyone would give me some idea. Thanks a lot in advance!

@TITLE:An efficient way to implement a custom generic list/queue/stack combination
@CONTENT:I have found more than one occasions where a generic collection needs to be treated as a list at one point in time and as a stack or queue at another time. For an an application I'm currently developing, it does not make sense to use three separate objects. The simplest solution I could think of was to implement Queue/Dequeue/Push/Pop/Peek functions on the standard List. Also (not included in the code below), an interface constraint is applied on T allowing the class to maintains a position/ordinal index for each list, queue and stack. public class List<T>:
    System.Collections.Generic.List<T>
{
    private object SyncRoot = new object();

    public void Enqueue (T item)
    {
        lock (this.SyncRoot)
        {
            this.Add(item);
        }
    }

    public T Dequeue ()
    {
        T item = default(T);

        lock (this.SyncRoot)
        {
            if (this.Count > 0)
            {
                item = this [0];
                this.RemoveAt(0);
            }
        }

        return (item);
    }

    public void Push (T item)
    {
        lock (this.SyncRoot)
        {
            this.Add(item);
        }
    }

    public T Pop ()
    {
        T item = default(T);

        lock (this.SyncRoot)
        {
            if (this.Count > 0)
            {
                item = this [this.Count - 1];
                this.RemoveAt(this.Count - 1);
            }
        }

        return (item);
    }

    public T PeekQueue ()
    {
        T item = default(T);

        lock (this.SyncRoot)
        {
            if (this.Count > 0)
            {
                item = this [0];
            }
        }

        return (item);
    }

    public T PeekStack ()
    {
        T item = default(T);

        lock (this.SyncRoot)
        {
            if (this.Count > 0)
            {
                item = this [this.Count - 1];
            }
        }

        return (item);
    }
}
 Since this is a rough, on-the-fly implementation, I'm not sure what corner cases to look out for so would appreciate pointers or links to any existing such implementations. Secondly, I am skeptical about performance on very large lists. Is the decision to inherit from List better than using say LinkedList for large lists. In my case, adding/removing items has more priority than enumerating the list.

 Nothing happens. No output. What am I doing wrong here. I'm trying to use this to XOR encrypt a string with a given key, but am having issues with this operation. I guess I could get the ASCII value and convert it to its corresponding char, but this tool will be used to encrypt files as well as plain text so I would like to avoid that at all costs.

@TITLE:Understanding Document.createElement()
@CONTENT:I'm using GWT and its underlaying DOM capabilities. What I'm basically trying to achieve is : Have a div element holding some text Some of these text would be surrounded by span elements The span elements are draggable into each other and offers contextual menus New span elements can be created dynamically by the end-users This is what it could look like : At the startup of the application, and during end-users dynamic creation of spans, I have to do some Element and Nodes manipulations (creating, inserting, modifying, deleting). To achieve this, I have to go through the DOM tree to be able to find particular elements. I'm looking for ways to reduce useless time spent at the startup of the application, where I build my div element (containing all the text and span elements). Take this example : DivElement outermostDiv = Document.get().createDivElement();
processText(outermostDiv, text); // text could be a Java String element
turnTheseIntoSpans(listOfSpans, outermostDiv); // listOfSpans could be a list of text that must be surrounded by span elements.
 Let's imagine, that turnTheseIntoSpans do lots of modifications of the outermostDiv element using methods like : appendChild(), removeFromParent(), ... My questions are : Is it a good practise to modify outermostDiv and its childs before inserting it into the DOM ? I can have access to outermostDiv childs, sibling of childs, without having added it to the DOM. I would like to understand how a browsable tree of elements exists even before outermostDiv is added to the DOM ?
@CODE:GWT DOM div span span spans Element Nodes div span DivElement outermostDiv = Document.get().createDivElement();
processText(outermostDiv, text); // text could be a Java String element
turnTheseIntoSpans(listOfSpans, outermostDiv); // listOfSpans could be a list of text that must be surrounded by span elements. turnTheseIntoSpans outermostDiv appendChild() removeFromParent() outermostDiv DOM outermostDiv

How to use the new implemented Something gem in my application without to make it public (that is, without put that on a public server)?

    //Formulate the string as a URL object.
    NSURL *requestURL=[NSURL URLWithString:url];
    NSData* data = [NSData dataWithContentsOfURL: requestURL];

    NSString *returnString = [[NSString alloc] initWithData:data encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];

@LINK:/questions/12502775/does-session-upload-progress-work-with-nginx-and-php-fpm
@TITLE:Does session upload progress work with nginx and php-fpm?
@CONTENT:I'm running nginx 1.2.3 / php-fpm 5.4.6 and trying to use the Session upload progress feature. During an upload $_SESSION never contains any upload data whatsoever. At first I assumed coding errors, but even the most simple/basic upload progress tests failed to produce anything within $_SESSION. I now suspect that the file is being POSTed directly to nginx, which completely handles the upload from beginning to end, THEN nginx passes the upload on to php-fpm so quickly that there is no real "progress" to report. Am I correct in this assessment? If so, how can I get around this? phpconfig confirms that the session.upload settings are all set correctly. Below is the current test code, borrowed from this blog. <?php
  /* File upload progress in PHP 5.4 */

  /* needs a 5.4+ version */
  $version = explode( '.', phpversion() );
  if ( ($version[0] * 10000 + $version[1] * 100 + $version[2]) < 50400 )
    die( 'PHP 5.4.0 or higher is required' );

  if ( !intval(ini_get('session.upload_progress.enabled')) )
    die( 'session.upload_progress.enabled is not enabled' );

  session_start();

  if ( isset( $_GET['progress'] ) ) {

    $progress_key = strtolower(ini_get("session.upload_progress.prefix").'demo');

    if ( !isset( $_SESSION[$progress_key] ) ) exit( "uploading..." );

    $upload_progress = $_SESSION[$progress_key];
    /* get percentage */
    $progress = round( ($upload_progress['bytes_processed'] / $upload_progress['content_length']) * 100, 2 );

    exit( "Upload progress: $progress%" );

 Is there anything I can do to optimise the query? With only 5,278,808 records, it seems unlikely that I've reached the hardware limits. I've also tried moving the entire table to a otherwise the same ENGINE=MEMORY table. The time improved by roughly 30%. However, that's still slow.

@TITLE:How can I pass command-line parameters with whitespace to an apache pig script?
@CONTENT:I want to write a pig script that takes a filter condition as a command line parameter. From the command line I want to type something like: pig -p "MY_FILTER=field1 == 0 and field2 == 5" myscript.pig
 In my script I have a line: my_filtered_data = filter my_data by $MY_FILTER;
 This works as expected when MY_FILTER has no spaces and I pass quotes around my value; So if I type MY_FILTER=\"field1==0\" at the command line the shell will pass the quotes with the value and pig does the expansion I want. However, the parameter will fail to expand if I supply it like MY_FILTER=\"field1 == 0\" I've tried a bunch of different quoting techniques and even tried running the command directly from python's subprocess module to ensure my shell wasn't doing something weird.
@CODE:pig -p "MY_FILTER=field1 == 0 and field2 == 5" myscript.pig my_filtered_data = filter my_data by $MY_FILTER; MY_FILTER MY_FILTER=\"field1==0\" MY_FILTER=\"field1 == 0\"

@TITLE:Deleting multiple columns in different data sets in R
@CONTENT:I'm wondering if there is a good way to delete multiple columns over a few different data sets in R. I have a data set that looks like: RangeNumber    Time    Value    Quality    Approval
          1    2:00        1          1           1
          2    2:05        4          2           1
 And I want to delete everything but the Time and Value columns in my data sets. I'm "deleting" them by setting each column to NULL, e.x.: data1$RangeNumber <- NULL. I'm going to have upwards of 16 or more data sets with identical column setups, and data sets are going to be numbered in incremental order, e.x.: data1, data2, data3, &c. I'm wondering if a for loop that iterates through all of the data set columns is the best way to accomplish this, or -- since I have read that R is slow at for loops-- if there is an easier way to do this. I'm also wondering if I need to combine all of my data sets into one variable, and then iterate through to remove the columns. If a for loop is the best way to go, how would I set it up?

@TITLE:C# Winforms Designer calling base property instead of 'new' one?
@CONTENT:I have a class that inherits from another class, who has a non-virtual property ("Controls"). Since I can't overwrite this property, Im using the 'new' keyword associated with my property. At runtime, this property is called as I want it to, in the correct context. When I open my form from the designer, the designer calls the base.Controls instead of my 'new' control. Am I missing something, or is this just incorrect behavior in the winforms designer? Edit, added the code in question for more explanation. I have the following class: public partial class BauerGroupBox : ComponentFactory.Krypton.Toolkit.KryptonGroupBox
   {
      public BauerGroupBox()
         : base()
      {
      }

            return this.Panel.Controls;
         }
      }
   }
 When I get to the following code in my intializecomponent: BauerGroupBox thisBox = new BauerGroupBox()
thisBox.Controls.Add(something)
 When I add a new 'BauerGroupBox' to my code, it works fine. However, when I open my code in the designer (even while using the debugging the devenv), the messagebox is NOT shown, and the breakpoint is NOT hit. When I run my app, the breakpoint is hit.
@CODE:public partial class BauerGroupBox : ComponentFactory.Krypton.Toolkit.KryptonGroupBox

@LINK:/questions/12496549/memory-leak-in-matlab-mex-file-managed-dll
@TITLE:Memory leak in MATLAB > MEX file > managed DLL
@CONTENT:My MEX file is written in C++/CLI and calls a DLL written in C#. When gcnew'ing an object, shouldn't it be garbage collected when the mexFunction returns? Its references should be lost but nothing seems to be garbage collected... each call to the mex function increases MATLAB's memory allocation (and no, the memory is not used for MATLAB variables). I've experimented with creating a large dummy value with narrow scope and when stepping through the MEX file I can see the memory allocated and released. But not so with the main object created in the mexFunction =( I've tried to delete it in the destructor and finalizer, but I can't get it to garbage collect. How can I free the managed memory when returning to MATLAB? I don't think external DLL filers are the problem. To illustrate, I created this silly mexFunction: public ref class Foo
{
    public:
        Foo()
        {
            Dictionary<int,String^>^ bar = gcnew Dictionary<int,String^>;
            for(int i=0;i<10000000;i++)
            {
                bar->Add(i, "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvxyz");
            }
        }
};

void mexFunction(int nlhs, mxArray* plhs[], int nrhs, mxArray* prhs[])
{
    Foo^ test = gcnew Foo();
}
 This bumps MATLAB's memory by around 300?MB, although subsequent calls don't increase the memory further like in my real MEX file. EDIT: I answered my own question, the culprit was mxArrayToString
@CODE:public ref class Foo
{
    public:
        Foo()
        {
            Dictionary<int,String^>^ bar = gcnew Dictionary<int,String^>;

};

 Note that i escape interfaces and abstract classes so that I will get the default implementations of SignalR from the base DefaultDependencyResolver and here I assigned the resolver using WebActivator:         public static void PostStart() 
    {

        // Inject Dependencies to SignalR, should be always come before ASP.NET MVC configuration

        AreaRegistration.RegisterAllAreas();
        RegisterGlobalFilters(GlobalFilters.Filters);
        RegisterRoutes(RouteTable.Routes);

    }
 However, SignalR is always trying to resolve it's own dependencies using the Resolver i assigned and i get the following error: 'myhub' hub could not be resolved. I only need the resolver to be aware of other dependencies(my Repository for example) and keep the default implementation of SignalR services.

@TITLE:Core Plot 1.0 Retina images not displayed correctly
@CONTENT:I am just about done with my App and have added some great things with core plot and the help of their dedicated staff. My question pertains to using images with the retina display. I have an annotation that is a picture of a speech bubble. When I run the App in the simulator, it displays fine for regular resolution, but when I switch to retina, the image is cropped. See pictures below. I have a .png that I called Bubble, and I added another that is called Bubble@2x, which is twice the size, I thought this was what I needed to do. That did not work. So I have tried to set the view.contentScale, see below code. But nothing seems to work. Anyone have any ideas what I am forgetting to do? Thanks once again. {
    //first annotation
    NSValue *value = [self.myData objectAtIndex:index];
    CGPoint point = [value CGPointValue];
    NSString *number1 = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"(%.2f, ", point.x];
    NSString *number2 = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%.2f)", point.y];
    NSNumber *x = [NSNumber numberWithFloat:point.x];
    NSNumber *y = [NSNumber numberWithFloat:point.y];    
    NSArray *anchorPoint = [NSArray arrayWithObjects: x, y, nil];
    NSString *final = [number1 stringByAppendingString:number2];

    //second annotation        
    UIImage *bubble = [UIImage imageNamed:@"Bubble.png"];
    CPTImage *fillimage = [CPTImage imageWithCGImage:bubble.CGImage];
    CPTBorderedLayer *imageLayer = [[CPTBorderedLayer alloc] init];
    //imageLayer.contentsScale = [[UIScreen mainScreen] scale]; //tried this
    imageLayer.frame = CGRectMake(0, 0, 150, 80);
    //imageLayer.contentsScale = 2.0f;  //and this

    imageLayer.fill = [CPTFill fillWithImage:fillimage];

    CPTTextLayer *textLayer = [[CPTTextLayer alloc] initWithText:final style:annotationTextStyle];
    _annotation = [[CPTPlotSpaceAnnotation alloc] initWithPlotSpace:graph.defaultPlotSpace anchorPlotPoint:anchorPoint];        
    _annotation.contentLayer = textLayer;        
    _annotation.displacement = CGPointMake(90.0f, 5.0f);
    _annotation.rotation = M_PI * .03f;

    _picAnnotation = [[CPTPlotSpaceAnnotation alloc] initWithPlotSpace:graph.defaultPlotSpace anchorPlotPoint:anchorPoint];
    _picAnnotation.contentLayer = imageLayer;
    _picAnnotation.displacement = CGPointMake(75.0f, 5.0f);

}
 after that code, I then placed both of the annotations. As you can see one works, the other doesn't.
@CODE:{
    //first annotation
    NSValue *value = [self.myData objectAtIndex:index];
    CGPoint point = [value CGPointValue];

    NSArray *anchorPoint = [NSArray arrayWithObjects: x, y, nil];
    NSString *final = [number1 stringByAppendingString:number2];

    //second annotation        
    UIImage *bubble = [UIImage imageNamed:@"Bubble.png"];
    CPTImage *fillimage = [CPTImage imageWithCGImage:bubble.CGImage];
    CPTBorderedLayer *imageLayer = [[CPTBorderedLayer alloc] init];
    //imageLayer.contentsScale = [[UIScreen mainScreen] scale]; //tried this
    imageLayer.frame = CGRectMake(0, 0, 150, 80);
    //imageLayer.contentsScale = 2.0f;  //and this

    imageLayer.fill = [CPTFill fillWithImage:fillimage];

    CPTTextLayer *textLayer = [[CPTTextLayer alloc] initWithText:final style:annotationTextStyle];
    _annotation = [[CPTPlotSpaceAnnotation alloc] initWithPlotSpace:graph.defaultPlotSpace anchorPlotPoint:anchorPoint];

    _annotation.displacement = CGPointMake(90.0f, 5.0f);
    _annotation.rotation = M_PI * .03f;

@TITLE:Controls, properties, events and timers running in design time
@CONTENT:Im using some custom control in vb.net, where I have a boolean property that, whenever it changes, it starts a timer if it's value is false or stops if it's true. If the timer runs for several seconds, it raises a messagebox that warns of a problem happening. The problem is that this messagebox shows even in design time. As I have traced, the default value for the property is false when the control loads in the winform in design time, it seems it starts the timer and when it ends raises the messagebox, this happens whenever I open the project or rebuild it. I don't get why this behaviour, as this should only happen at run time but it's driving me crazy, I have tried starting the timer directly when the property changes in the setter and creating "onpropertychanged" events, but this still happens in design time. Anyone has an idea of how to get rid of this or how to solve it to avoid this of happening, is really disturbing that things happens when the program isn't even running. Thanks in advance. Regards

@LINK:/questions/12488879/datetime-parsing-in-powershell
@TITLE:DateTime parsing in PowerShell
@CONTENT:I'm trying to write a PowerShell script that will generate a table of information with two columns: a name, and a date (which will be retrieved from a third-party application - in this case svn.exe). The overall script works well, but I'm struggling to get the date that the server sends back into the DataTable. Here's a simplified version of my script: # Set up a DataTable and initialise columns
$table = New-Object system.Data.DataTable Test Table
$col1 = New-Object system.Data.DataColumn Name,([string])
$col2 = New-Object system.Data.DataColumn DateFromServer,([DateTime])
$table.columns.add($col1)
$table.columns.add($col2)

# Create a new row and add the data
$row = $table.NewRow()
$row.Name = "Test"
$lastCommit = GetDateFromExternalApp
$lastCommit.GetType() # this returns DateTime as I would expect
$row.DateFromServer = $lastCommit # this throws up an error
$table.Rows.Add($row)

# Output the table
$table | Format-Table -AutoSize

# This function simulates what the actual function does
# (the real one goes to SVN and pulls down data, but it
# ends up with the same resulting date)
Function GetDateFromExternalApp
{   
    $externalAppDate = "2012-09-17T16:33:57.177516Z"

    return [DateTime]($externalAppDate)
}
 The problem (noted in comments in the script above) is that while the function seems to be happily returning a DateTime instance, when I try to add this into the table row's DateFromServer column it's throwing up an error: Exception setting "DateFromServer": "Unable to cast object of type 'System.Management.Automation.PSObject' to type 'System.IConvertible'.Couldn't store <18/09/2012 2:33:57 AM> in DateFromServer  Column.  Expected type is DateTime." At line:13 char:6
+ $row. <<<< DateFromServer = $lastCommit
    + CategoryInfo          : InvalidOperation: (:) [], RuntimeException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : PropertyAssignmentException
 However, the call to $lastCommit.GetType() shows that this is indeed a DateTime - and in fact if I add this line somewhere in the script: $lastCommit
 then I can see a nicely formatted datetime, suggesting that it is indeed parsing it and converting it correctly: Date        : 18/09/2012 12:00:00 AM
Day         : 18

DateTime    : Tuesday, 18 September 2012 2:33:57 AM
 As such I'm quite puzzled as to why I'm getting the exception above. I realise that PowerShell does function return values differently than C#, but it looks to me like the function is returning the right type!

@TITLE:PHP's PDO execute() vs. fetch()?
@CONTENT:I have a quick question that I hope has a quick and clear answer. On php.com's manual, it states that execute() after binding the values to a prepared query will return true on success and false on failure. Simple enough. I just wanted to make sure I had this clear. The values returned on execute() correspond to direct errors. For instance, if the database somehow went down after a successful connect, and the query could not be executed - or some other extraordinary issue. Consider some code:     protected function territoryCheck($numberOut)
    {
        $this->numberOut = $numberOut;

        //Execute test
        $this->checkConnect();
        $stmt = $this->dbh->prepare("SELECT t_id FROM Territory WHERE t_id = :param1")
        $stmt->bindParam(':param1', $this->numberOut);
        $stmt->execute();

        //Determine value of test
        if($stmt == FALSE)
        {
            return FALSE;
        }   
    }
 I am rather sure that this will not operate as I want. The point is to see if t_id exists in the database based on whether there is a corresponding value to the parameter. In that case, I need to use $stmt->fetch(). Am I correct in saying that? Any help is appreciated. Edit: Along the same lines, would it be prudent - or I should say best practice - to put //Execute test
        $this->checkConnect();
        $stmt = $this->dbh->prepare("SELECT t_id FROM Territory WHERE t_id = :param1")
        $stmt->bindParam(':param1', $this->numberOut);
        $stmt->execute();
 within a try-catch since PDO returns exceptions?
@CODE:protected function territoryCheck($numberOut)
    {
        $this->numberOut = $numberOut;

        //Execute test
        $this->checkConnect();

@TITLE:Query dynamoDB with non hash key field (with boto / python)
@CONTENT:I'm using dynamoDB with boto, and having a bit of a problem in the design/query of my table. I'd like my data to look something like +---------------------------------------+
hash_key    account_id    mykey
-----------------------------------------
1           12345         myvalue1
2           12345         myvalue2
3           12345         myvalue3
4           123456        myvalue4
+---------------------------------------+
 And then retrieve all data for account 12345. Looking at the boto docs, I always need to have the hash_key available. I know how I would query this standard SQL / MongoDB, but I can't find a solution for boto. I assume this is possible? Thanks! EDIT: This seems to work +---------------------------------------+
hash_key    range_key    mykey
-----------------------------------------
12345       12568        myvalue1
12345       53890        myvalue2
12345       12322        myvalue3
123456      23432        myvalue4
+---------------------------------------+
 Followed by > res = table.query(hash_key='12345')
> for item in res:
>    print i
 Since I want to grab all the entries with account # 12345, regardless of the range_key, I need to query instead of get_item

@TITLE:Should I optimize around reads or CPU time in Google App Engine
@CONTENT:I'm trying to optimize my design, but it's really difficult to put things in perspective. Say I have the following cases: A. A User has 1,000 status updates. These updates are stored in a separate entity, Statuses. I want to get a User's statuses which have a uploadDate after date X. So I do a query: statuses = Statuses.query(Statuses.uploadDate > X).fetch() B. A User has 1,000 status updates. Each User entity has a list property list_of_status_keys, which is a list of all keys to the user's statuses. I want to get all statuses with uploadDate after date X. So I easily get a list of statuses using statuses = ndb.get_multi(list_of_status_keys). Then I loop through each one, checking the date: for a_status in statuses:
  if a_status.uploadDate > X:
     myList.append(a_status)
 I really don't know which I should be optimizing for. A query is more organized it seems, but fetching by keys is quicker. Anyone have any insight? UPDATE Here's what it comes down to: In each http request to GAE, I get all notifications and status updates for a user (just like facebook). Using Appstats, it tells me that each request costs 490 micropennies (where 1 penny = 1,000,000 micropennies). Getting notifications and statuses is important for a user, so you can expect them to do this many times. What I'm having a hard time with is determining if this is a lot or not. I'm freaking out trying to minimize this number in any way possible. I've never run a service before, so I don't know if this is how much it should cost. Here's the math: Each request costs 490 micropennies when no results are returned (so just for a basic query it costs 490, but on some cases when several results are returned, it could cost 10,000 mp), so for 1 penny, I can run 2040 requests, or for $1 dollar, I can run 204,000 requests. Let's say I have 50,000 users, and each user checks for notifications 75 times a day (reasonable): 75 requests X 490 mp per request X 50,000 users = 1,837,500,000 micropennies per day = 1837.5 pennies = 18.37 dollars per day. (is that right?) I've never run a large scale service before, so are these usual costs? Or is this too high? Is 490 micropennies per request high? How would I find an answer to this if it depends?
@CODE:statuses = Statuses.query(Statuses.uploadDate > X).fetch() list_of_status_keys statuses = ndb.get_multi(list_of_status_keys) for a_status in statuses:
  if a_status.uploadDate > X:
     myList.append(a_status) 75 requests X 490 mp per request X 50,000 users = 1,837,500,000 micropennies per day = 1837.5 pennies = 18.37 dollars per day. [s for s in statuses if s.uploadDate > X]

@LINK:/questions/12481199/how-do-you-know-when-the-uitableview-is-done-updating-its-view
@TITLE:How do you know when the UITableView is done updating it's view?
@CONTENT:So I implement UITableViewDataSource protocol using an NSFetchedResultsController. I then modify the contents of the Core Data base and the NSFetchedResultsController then update the tableView.. Is there anyway to know when the tableView has done reloading the data? We have a complex data model that is caching against a REST implementation, and it's difficult to determine if we need to get more data to fill up the screen (because the screen might be using complex filters against the raw data loaded). Also, the UITableViewCell objects are NOT guaranteed to be the same height. The easy answer was to simply dump the data to core data, and use an NSFetchedResultsController to serve the data to the UITableView. Here is how it works: We added a tableview.tableFooterView that displays our "data loading" message. Loading up a batch of data from the REST API and then using it update our Core Data objects. This triggers the controllerDidChangeContent method to trigger, which then triggers a tableView reloadData (eg:) - (void)controllerDidChangeContent:(NSFetchedResultsController *)controller 
{
   [self.tableView reloadData];
}
 We then basically then "Check" to see if the Footer is still visible 250ms later by calling a method like: [self performSelector:@selector(checkIfFooterViewIsVisible) withObject:nil afterDelay:0.25];

- (void)checkIfFooterViewIsVisible
{
  BOOL viewVisible = CGRectIntersectsRect(self.tableView.bounds,self.tableView.tableFooterView.frame);
  if (viewVisible)
  {
    [self getMoreData];
  }
 We also check to see if the Footer is in view everytime we scroll. - (void)scrollViewDidScroll:(UIScrollView *)scrollView
{
    [self checkIfFooterViewIsVisible];
}
 If we load the "last batch" of data, we actually just remove the tableViewFooter view object from the table (so it can't ever be visible). So the answer is cool, because we can figure out if we need to pull more data, only if the user "needs" it. Either because there wasn't much visible data in the first batch, or because they have scrolled down and want more data. Checking the current placement of the tableFooterView lets us know if we have "painted" enough data on the screen. The PROBLEM is - can I get rid of the: [self performSelector:@selector(checkIfFooterViewIsVisible) withObject:nil afterDelay:0.25];
 If we set the delay too fast, then UITableView doesn't have time to update the screen (and change the footer's position). If we update too slowly, then it feels like the app "stutters" as it loads data, and can load data slower than it could. But different iOS devices (and different network coverage) are going to mean slightly different timings, so the "let the UITableView update and check a bit later" works most of the time, but I feel like this could work smoother. Is there anyway (maybe by overloading UITableView) that we can determine that the UITableView is "done" loading UITableViewCell objects? (at least until the next time the scroll moves?). Adding in this weird delay works well, but it would work cleaner if we knew definitively that the [tableview reloadDate] operation has completed.
@CODE:UITableViewDataSource NSFetchedResultsController NSFetchedResultsController UITableViewCell NSFetchedResultsController UITableView controllerDidChangeContent - (void)controllerDidChangeContent:(NSFetchedResultsController *)controller 
{
   [self.tableView reloadData];
} [self performSelector:@selector(checkIfFooterViewIsVisible) withObject:nil afterDelay:0.25];

- (void)checkIfFooterViewIsVisible
{
  BOOL viewVisible = CGRectIntersectsRect(self.tableView.bounds,self.tableView.tableFooterView.frame);
  if (viewVisible)
  {
    [self getMoreData];
  } - (void)scrollViewDidScroll:(UIScrollView *)scrollView
{
    [self checkIfFooterViewIsVisible];
} tableViewFooter tableFooterView [self performSelector:@selector(checkIfFooterViewIsVisible) withObject:nil afterDelay:0.25]; UITableView UITableView UITableView UITableView UITableViewCell [tableview reloadDate] UITableView

@CONTENT:I am trying to make a product between a 2772x128 matrix and a 4000x128 matrix. Both are matrices of SIFT descriptors, using next code: Mat a = Mat(nframes, descrSize, CV_8U, DATAdescr);
Mat b = Mat(vocabulary_size, descrSize, CV_8U, vocabulary);
Mat ab =a * b.t();
 The problem is that when calculating the product, it throws an error saying err_msg = 0x00cdd5e0 "..\..\..\src\opencv\modules\core\src\matmul.cpp:711: error: (-215) type == B.type() && (type == CV_32FC1 || type == CV_64FC1 || type == CV_32FC2 || type == CV_64FC2)"
 The solution to this has been to convert the data type to CV_32FC1 Mat a = Mat(nframes, descrSize, CV_8U, DATAdescr);
Mat b = Mat(vocabulary_size, descrSize, CV_8U, vocabulary);
a.convertTo(a, CV_32FC1);
b.convertTo(b, CV_32FC1);
Mat ab = a * b.t();
 It works well, but it is consuming too much time, about 1.2 s. I would like to try the same product but using integers, to see if I can speed this up. Am I doing something wrong? I can't see any reason I cannot do matrix product between CV_8U matrices. EDIT: The answers are related to using other libraries or solving other way.

@TITLE:How do I store a previous iteration in a while loop in C++?
@CONTENT:I saw something with a similar title has been answered, but the content was too dense for me as I don't know a lot of c++. I am very new to programming, I cannot figure out how to store the previous iteration in my while loop. I am trying to use a while loop to write a users text into a file, and end their input with two \n characters. This is where my problem is because with my current code the input ends with one instance of enter. My code looks like this, but I know temp and new_advice are the same: char new_advice, temp;
while( (!(new_advice == '\n' + '\n'))) && (!(temp == '\n')) )
{
    temp = new_advice;
    cin.get(new_advice);
    fout.put(new_advice);
}
 Edit* Ok, I don't think I was clear about what I was asking. The original assignment said "Allow the user to type in advice so that it can be any number of lines long. The user is told to end his or her advice by pressing the return key two times. Your program can then test to see that it has reached the end of input by checking to see when it reads two consecutive occurrences of the character '\n'." Does this change any answers to my question? I have now tried to do this with the code: char new_advice;
         int temp = 0;

         while(temp < 2)
         {
         if(new_advice == '\n')
         {
         temp = temp++;
         }
         cin.get(new_advice);
         fout.put(new_advice);

         }
 But this is not working either, my program does not recognize enter as ending the program. Would the context of the whole program be worth posting?
@CODE:\n temp new_advice char new_advice, temp;
while( (!(new_advice == '\n' + '\n'))) && (!(temp == '\n')) )
{
    temp = new_advice;
    cin.get(new_advice);
    fout.put(new_advice);
} char new_advice;
         int temp = 0;

         while(temp < 2)
         {
         if(new_advice == '\n')
         {
         temp = temp++;
         }
         cin.get(new_advice);
         fout.put(new_advice);

         } '\n' + '\n' '\n' == new_advice temp '\n'

@TITLE:How do I disable body.blur() in IE8?
@CONTENT:I work on an enterprise web application that runs in IE8. It appears blur() is being called on the body causing the IE window to be sent to the background. Unfortunately this code is in a portion of the application that is controlled by the vendor. Is there any possible way to prevent blur() from being called on the body without modifying the code that is actually calling body.blur()? Since this is an enterprise application, solutions outside of changes in the application itself are acceptable; Such as changes to IE8 settings, registry, etc.

@CONTENT:I'm trying to figure-out JQuery in the HTML Service but I can't seem to get it to work. Following the first example at https://developers.google.com/apps-script/html_service I can get Hello World! to display. But if I add a script tag and point to JQuery it doesn't work, nothing shows-up on the page, it's just blank! This is my code.gs file: function doGet() {
  return HtmlService.createHtmlOutputFromFile('myPage');
}
 The myPage.html that works looks like this: <html>
  <body>
    Hello World!
  </body>
</html>
 The one that doesn't looks like this: <html>
  <body>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.7.2.min.js"/>
    Hello World!
  </body>
</html>
 So how do I get JQuery (ultimately JQueryUI) to work? Are there any examples or tutorials anywhere? Thanks,
@CODE:function doGet() {
  return HtmlService.createHtmlOutputFromFile('myPage');

@LINK:/questions/12466142/xmlattribute-not-working-with-xmlarray
@TITLE:XmlAttribute not working with XmlArray
@CONTENT:I'm having trouble producing the following XML-structure using the XmlSerializer: <Root xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
  <Name>This is root.</Name>
  <OtherValue>Otha.</OtherValue>
  <Shapes Name="This attribute is ignored!">
    <Circle>
      <Name>This</Name>
      <Value>Is</Value>
      <Whatever>Circle</Whatever>
    </Circle>
    <Square>
      <Name>And</Name>
      <Value>this is</Value>
      <Something>Square</Something>
    </Square>
  </Shapes>
</Root>
 The only problem is that the attributes of <Shapes> doesn't get written. The classes I'm using for the serialization are the following: public class Root
{
    [XmlElement]
    public string Name { get; set; }

    [XmlElement]
    public string OtherValue { get; set; }

    [XmlArray("Shapes")]
    [XmlArrayItem("Circle", typeof(Circle))]
    [XmlArrayItem("Square", typeof(Square))]
    public ShapeList Shapes { get; set; }
}

public class ShapeList : List<Shape>
{
    // Attribute that is not in output
    [XmlAttribute]
    public string Name { get; set; }
}

public class Shape
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Value { get; set; }
}

public class Circle : Shape
{
   public string Whatever { get; set; }
}

public class Square : Shape
{
    public string Something { get; set; }
}
 And a little main method to run the serialization: public static void Main(String[] args)
{
    var extraTypes = new Type[] {
        typeof(Shape),
        typeof(Square),
        typeof(Circle)
    };

    var root = new Root();
    root.Name = "This is root.";
    root.OtherValue = "Otha.";

    root.Shapes = new ShapeList()
    {
        new Circle() { Name = "This", Value="Is", Whatever="Circle" },
        new Square() { Name = "And", Value="this is", Something="Square" }
    };
    root.Shapes.Name = "This is shapes.";

    using (var sw = new StreamWriter("data.xml"))
    {
        var serializer = new XmlSerializer(typeof(Root), extraTypes);
        serializer.Serialize(sw, root);
    }
}
 Why am I not getting the Name attribute of the ShapeList? If this cannot be accomplished using this method, is there any another simple way?
@CODE:<Root xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">

@TITLE:Validate caracter amount, text length and decimal places from input using javascript
@CONTENT:I am using a javascript to validate input from a textbox that's inside a ASPxGridView control(DevExpress component). I am using this javascript code to validate it(thru OnKeyPress event): function CheckKey(s, e) {
    var key = ASPxClientUtils.GetKeyCode(e.htmlEvent);
    var char = String.fromCharCode(key);
    if (e.htmlEvent.shiftKey) {
        if (!IsAvailableChar(char))
            ASPxClientUtils.PreventEvent(e.htmlEvent);
    } else
        if (!(IsAvailableChar(char) || IsAvailableKey(key))) ASPxClientUtils.PreventEvent(e.htmlEvent);

    return;
}

function IsAvailableChar(char) {
    var AvailableChars = "0123456789,";
    return AvailableChars.indexOf(char) != -1;
}

function IsAvailableKey(key) {

    switch (key) {
        case 46: //delete
            return true;
            break;
        case 37: //left arrow
            return true;
            break;
        case 39: //right arrow
            return true;
            break;
        case 16: //shift
            return true;
            break;
        case 188: //comma
            return true;
            break;
        default:
            return false;
            break;
    }
 I use this to "block" some caracters and it works fine. But now I wanna do something a little bit more complicated: I don't want the user to input more than one comma in the textbox. A little bit more complicated than that: the maxlength of this textbox is 6. I want it to allow two decimal places only and the maximum of three numbers before the decimal places. For example: I want it to allow these strings: "123,12", "45,32", "7,65", "9,6", "85,32", "94,1", "310,2". I don't want it to allow these strings: "1,123", "125,789", "1234,2" Any ideas on how I can do that? Thank you! Edit: I tried to use the two regular expressions you guys told me to like this: function CheckKey(s, e) {
    var key = ASPxClientUtils.GetKeyCode(e.htmlEvent);
    var char = String.fromCharCode(key);

    var text = document.getElementsByName(s.uniqueID)[0].value + char;

    var regEx = new RegExp("/^\d{0,3}(,\d{0,2})?$/");

    if(regEx.test(text))
        return;
    else
        ASPxClientUtils.PreventEvent(e.htmlEvent);

    return;
}
 However, regEx.test(text) is always returning false, even when the input matches the regular expression. Another edit: I changed the instantiation of the RegExp object in the code above from this: var regEx = new RegExp("/^\d{0,3}(,\d{0,2})?$/");
 To this: var regEx = /^\d{0,3}(,\d{0,2})?$/
 And now it worked, thank you!
@CODE:function CheckKey(s, e) {
    var key = ASPxClientUtils.GetKeyCode(e.htmlEvent);
    var char = String.fromCharCode(key);
    if (e.htmlEvent.shiftKey) {
        if (!IsAvailableChar(char))
            ASPxClientUtils.PreventEvent(e.htmlEvent);
    } else
        if (!(IsAvailableChar(char) || IsAvailableKey(key))) ASPxClientUtils.PreventEvent(e.htmlEvent);

    return;
}

function IsAvailableChar(char) {
    var AvailableChars = "0123456789,";
    return AvailableChars.indexOf(char) != -1;
}

function IsAvailableKey(key) {

    switch (key) {
        case 46: //delete
            return true;
            break;
        case 37: //left arrow
            return true;
            break;
        case 39: //right arrow
            return true;
            break;
        case 16: //shift
            return true;
            break;
        case 188: //comma
            return true;
            break;
        default:
            return false;
            break;
    } function CheckKey(s, e) {
    var key = ASPxClientUtils.GetKeyCode(e.htmlEvent);
    var char = String.fromCharCode(key);

    var text = document.getElementsByName(s.uniqueID)[0].value + char;

    var regEx = new RegExp("/^\d{0,3}(,\d{0,2})?$/");

@TITLE:Sending JSON to Spring MVC controller
@CONTENT:I am trying to send JSON to a Spring MVC Controller. On the Spring MVC side, everything is configured correctly. Below is the code but doesn't seem to run: <html>
<head>
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js"></script>

    url: $('#myForm').attr('action'), 
    data: dat, 
    contentType: 'application/json' 
    success: function(hxr) {

                <input type="text" name="name" value="myName">
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
 In Tomcat I get the following error: org.springframework.web.servlet.mvc.support.DefaultHandlerE xceptionResolver handleNoSuchRequestHandlingMethod WARNING: No matching handler method found for servlet request: path '/application/save', method 'POST', parameters map['name' -> array['myName']] Any ideas where I am going wrong? I am new to JSON. I am trying to to send JSON to Spring MVC controller. @Controller
@RequestMapping("/run/*")
public class HistoryController {

    @RequestMapping(value = "save", method = RequestMethod.POST, headers = {"content-type=application/json"})
public @ResponseBody Response save(@RequestBody User user) throws Exception {
    Response userResponse = new Response();
    System.out.println("UserId :" + " " + user.getName());
    return userResponse;
}
}

@RequestMapping(value = "find", method = RequestMethod.GET)
public @ResponseBody Response find() {
    System.out.println("Run");
    Response userResponse = new Response();
    userResponse.setVersionNumber("1.0");
    return userResponse;
}
 When invoking /application/run/save I get a JSON response. However the @RequestBody does not work. I still have had no luck. Have read some many similiar problems. The requirement is that the server will only accept application/json types. I am using a Spring MVC Controller. As mentioned earlier, the code sends a response back as JSON through @ResponseBody. I want to get information through the @RequestBody in my Spring MVC Controller. I am using JSP to send JSON to Spring MVC Controller. My code and Spring MVC can be seen below: I am new to JSON and Javascript. JSP - index.jsp <%@page language="java" contentType="text/html"%>

@TITLE:Change CS:IP in Assembly Language
@CONTENT:How can you forcibly change CS and IP both in assembly language ? ORG directive can be used to change the number of the IP, but how do you change the CS? Basically I wan to implement multi-threading using assembly. Many forums, including a question in stack overflow has said its impossible, but then how does C have multi-threading options even when it is made from assembly code ?

@TITLE:Huge file upload
@CONTENT:I have a web service that accepts really huge files. Usually in the range of 10 - 15 GB (not MB). However upload using a browser is only possible using Chrome on Linux. All 3 major browsers have different flaws trying to upload such a file: Internet Explorer stops after exactly 4GB. Firefox does not start at all. Chrome (on Windows) transfers the whole file but fails to send the closing bondary (send 0xff instead). Now we are searching for a way to get uploads to work. Preferably using HTML/JS only, but I see no way to make that happen. Second try would be flash, but FileReference seems to break for files > 4GB. Last way would be Java but that is not what we are looking for in the browser client. Note that this is about the client. I know that the server side code works, as I can upload a 12GB file using standard HTML-Upload with Chrome on Linux. It is the only browser/os combination that works so far, but therefor I am sure, the server coode is fine. Does anyone know any way to get huge file uploads to work? Regards, Steffen

@LINK:/questions/12462286/svg-background-pattern-is-using-global-and-not-local-coordinate-system
@TITLE:SVG background pattern is using global and not local coordinate system
@CONTENT:at the moment i am working with svg graphics to display a "map" of a splice. When i try to draw rectangles or paths with a pattern (image) as a background, the pattern won't use the local coordinate system of the drawn rect/path, but the global one. This is how i define a pattern in the svg-document: <defs>
    <pattern preserveAspectRatio="true" patternUnits="userSpaceOnUse" height="24" width="50" y="0" x="0" id="black_h">
         <image height="24" width="50" y="0" x="0" xlink:href="http://newlini.lokal/img/svg/black_h.png"/>
    </pattern>
</defs>
 This is how i apply the pattern to a path: <path style="fill: url(#black_h)" d="M324 0 L324 375 L348 375 L348 0">
 So the behaviour i would expect is, that the pattern starts at the top left corner of the path and repeats itself in both directions. But in my example the pattern starts at the top left corner of the svg document, so the path only looks good, when the y-coord is a multiple of 24. Do you have any idea where i am stucked? Thanks in advance, Tobi EDIT1: Here is a little example of my problem on jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/E3wBn/ EDIT2: I used the advice from robertc and changed my example svg to this: http://jsfiddle.net/2DKXn/ I also uploaded an example jpg which shows how it should look like later. http://www.img-share.net/uploads/oi1IcdPBVk.jpg
@CODE:<defs>
    <pattern preserveAspectRatio="true" patternUnits="userSpaceOnUse" height="24" width="50" y="0" x="0" id="black_h">

@LINK:/questions/12461094/how-does-one-handle-webhooks-in-braintree
@TITLE:How does one handle Webhooks in BrainTree
@CONTENT:I am trying to use the BrainTree webhooks for subscription transactions but have been unable to get my page to verify. From BrainTree: https://www.braintreepayments.com/docs/php/webhooks/destination_verification When you attempt to add the destination, our servers will make a GET request to the provided URL with a query param named bt_challenge. This query param should be passed to the verify method. The result of calling this method should be returned as the body of the response. Braintree_WebhookNotification::verify(bt_challenge_param);
 First, I tried in NodeJS (as our transactions are successfully done this way): //WEBHOOK GET PROCESS FOR BRAINTREE SUBSCRIPTION
app.get('/getwebhook', function(req, res){

    var bt_challenge_param = req.param('bt_challenge_param', null);
    var jsObj = new Object();

    jsObj.response = gateway.webhookNotification.verify(bt_challenge_param);

    res.json(JSON.stringify(jsObj));
});
 where my PHP page communicated with the NodeJS process and puts the result in the body. Once this failed verification, I wrote a test page directly in PHP: <?php
require_once 'lib/Braintree.php';

Braintree_Configuration::environment('production');
Braintree_Configuration::merchantId('mymid');
Braintree_Configuration::publicKey('mypubkey');
Braintree_Configuration::privateKey('myprodkey');

$bt_challenge = "";
if(isset($_GET['bt_challenge']))
{
    $bt_challenge = $_GET['bt_challenge'];
}


?>

<?php
if(isset($bt_challenge) && $bt_challenge != ""){
    echo Braintree_WebhookNotification::verify($bt_challenge);
}
?>

 However, this too failed verification. Not sure what is wrong as there is no test for verification or any indication of what is wrong. I tried contacting BrainTree support but with no response back.

But when I typed typeof(window.close) it showing 'object' in IE8 and 'function' in chrome. Why this different behavior? What are the ways I can use to check type of a variable in JavaScript? Is there other functions which shows this type of behavior? Thanks

@LINK:/questions/12457582/download-file-size-is-unknown-although-file-size-is-present-in-header
@TITLE:Download file size is unknown although file size is present in header
@CONTENT:I am doing the follwoing on a web page: A click on an element sends a set of data (attached to the element) to my server which will then generate a custom zip-file: $.post(urlprefix + 'makeZip.php', params, function(data){
    window.location = urlprefix + 'getZip.php?file=' + data; //get file
}).error(handleAJAXError);
 makeZip.php works just fine and returns the name of the (temporary) zip file that the client should then download. As I want to keep my server clean I route the file through another script called getZip.php which does the following: /* RETURN REQUESTED FILE AND DELETE FROM SERVER*/
$filename = $_GET['file'];
/* TRANSFER FILE CONTENTS */
header('Content-type: application/zip');
header('Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="customDownload.zip"');
header('Content-Length: '.filesize($filename));
readfile($filename);
/* REMOVE FILE FROM SERVER */
unlink($filename);
 All browsers will download the file successfully, yet I am facing one problem: the files can get rather big (up to 200MB) so I thought it would be nice to have an estimate of how long the download's going to take. That's why I am sending the Content-Length header (the specified filesize is correct). Yet, all browsers I tested this is are telling me the filesize is unknown (which might lead to the user skipping the download). Is this some kind of problem with my header information? Is it a client-side problem? Should I use another approach to getting the client to download the file?
@CODE:$.post(urlprefix + 'makeZip.php', params, function(data){
    window.location = urlprefix + 'getZip.php?file=' + data; //get file
}).error(handleAJAXError); makeZip.php getZip.php /* RETURN REQUESTED FILE AND DELETE FROM SERVER*/
$filename = $_GET['file'];

@TITLE:XML header getting removed after processing with elementtree
@CONTENT:i have an xml file and i used Elementtree to add a new tag to the xml file.My xml file before processing is as follows <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

<PackageInfo xmlns="http://someurlpackage">


<data ID="http://someurldata1">data1</data >
<data ID="http://someurldata2">data2</data >
<data ID="http://someurldata3">data3</data >
</PackageInfo>
 I used following python code to add a new data tag and write it to my xml file  tree = ET.ElementTree(xmlFile)
 root = tree.getroot()
 elem= ET.Element('data')
 elem.attrib['ID']="http://someurldata4"
 elem.text='data4'
 root[1].append(elem)
 tree = ET.ElementTree(root)
 tree.write(xmlFile)
 But the resultant xml file have <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?> absent and the file looks as below <PackageInfo xmlns="http://someurlpackage">
<data ID="http://someurldata1">data1</data >
<data ID="http://someurldata2">data2</data >
<data ID="http://someurldata3">data3</data >

@TITLE:wcf rest ierrorhandler webfaultexception
@CONTENT:I have a WCF 4 Rest service that is to be consumed by a java client and also an c# mvc3 client. The response content needs to be returned as json. I want to be able to return any exception/faults back to clients in a consistent way. I read that WebFaultException should be used and indeed it works fine. However, I do not want to pollute my application logic project with WebFaultExceptions as it may be used by a non web project. I therefore looked at implementing IErrorHandler in the WCF Rest service to catch ANY exceptions and then for specific ones i.e. ValidationException, return the exception as a fault wrapped in a WebFaultException. However this doesn't seem to work and I get the following Http 504 response when called form fiddler [Fiddler] ReadResponse() failed: The server did not return a response for this request. I've reduced the code to its bare bones to show the essence of what I'm doing. public void ProvideFault(Exception error, 
                         MessageVersion version, 
                         ref Message fault)
{
    var ex = new WebFaultException<Exception>(
                                      new Exception("you can't do that"), 
                                      HttpStatusCode.Unauthorized);

    var xmf = ex.CreateMessageFault();
    fault = Message.CreateMessage(version,
                                  null,
                                  xmf,
                                 new DataContractJsonSerializer(xmf.GetType()));
}
 What am I doing wrong?

@TITLE:mshtml and CLS-compliance
@CONTENT:I am witnessing some odd behaviour with mshtml and CLS-compliance. I have an assembly marked CLSCompliant(true). This assembly does not expose any types from mshtml publicly. I can make the code conform to CLS fairly easily, but several things seem to break it: Introducing a "using mshtml;" statement instead of referencing the namespace manually each time I use a type. For some reason, this breaks CLS compliance. If I convert the following:     var doc = webBrowser.Document as mshtml.HTMLDocument;

    var scriptNode = doc.createElement("SCRIPT") as mshtml.IHTMLScriptElement;

    var nodes = doc.getElementsByTagName("head");

    foreach (var head in nodes)
    {
        var htmlHead = (mshtml.HTMLHeadElement)head;
        if (htmlHead != null)
            htmlHead.appendChild((mshtml.IHTMLDOMNode)scriptNode);
    }
 to this:     foreach (var head in nodes.OfType<mshtml.IHTMLDOMNode>())
        head.appendChild((mshtml.IHTMLDOMNode)scriptNode);
 This also seems to break CLS compliance. Can anyone offer any insight as to what might be going on here? Because for me, none of this breaks CLS compliance. PS When I say breaks CLS compliance, 167 warnings are raised about each type in the mshtml namespace that begins with an underscore, or similar CLS violations. Thanks.

@TITLE:Firefox augments the content-type of XMLHttpRequest
@CONTENT:How can FireFox be forced to use a specific content type for XMLHttpRequest without appending the charset parameter after the type itself? I am using FireFox 15 to extract some data out of a very custom http server. The server takes JSON from the POST body and responds with another JSON. The server accepts only "Content-Type: application/json" as valid content type. Anything after except this exact header will not be recognized by the server as valid content type. When I use the below code in Chrome it sets the content type as expected "Content-Type: application/json" var invocation = new XMLHttpRequest();
invocation.open('POST', url, true);
invocation.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
invocation.onreadystatechange = function(data){ /* some processing */ };
invocation.send(body);
 The issue is that FireFox sets the content type to "Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8".
@CODE:var invocation = new XMLHttpRequest();
invocation.open('POST', url, true);
invocation.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
invocation.onreadystatechange = function(data){ /* some processing */ };
invocation.send(body);

 Can anyone advise me how to get in the same query also contact name? Specifically field ContactsContract.PhoneLookup.DISPLAY_NAME? I mean, I understand how to get those field in separate query, but I need to get it in the same query as for conversations.

@TITLE:How to validate an xml file using a schema file in C programming language using libxml2
@CONTENT:I have been trying to validate XML file using schema file in my C Code. The validation happens successfully stating whether the file is valid or invalid. But my issue is it prints valid/invalid only. There should be a report/output as to what was missing in the xml file in case it was invalid. May be something like the line number in XML file. Hope, i have made my self clear. Here's my C code:-  int validateXmlFile()
{
    int iError = 0;
    xmlDocPtr pDoc;
    xmlDocPtr pSchemaDoc;
    xmlSchemaParserCtxtPtr pSchemaCtxt;
    xmlSchemaPtr pSchema;
    xmlSchemaValidCtxtPtr pValidCtxt;
    char * xmlFilename = "C:\\Documents and Settings\\pbhatia\\Desktop\\Schema\\ipt_config.xml";
    char * schemaFilename = "C:\\Documents and Settings\\pbhatia\\Desktop\\Schema\\ipt_config.xsd";

    PRNT(printf("Schema file : %s \n", schemaFilename));
    PRNT(printf("XML file : %s \n", xmlFilename));

    pDoc = xmlReadFile(xmlFilename, NULL, XML_PARSE_NONET);
    if (!pDoc)
        return -1;

    pSchemaDoc = xmlReadFile(schemaFilename, NULL, XML_PARSE_NONET);

        return -4;

    pValidCtxt = xmlSchemaNewValidCtxt(pSchema);
    if(!pValidCtxt)
        return -5;

    // Attempting to validate xml with schema
    xmlSchemaFreeParserCtxt(pSchemaCtxt);
    xmlFreeDoc(pSchemaDoc);

@TITLE:How to collect variables from a URL, insert them into an array and dynamically change a href URLs?
@CONTENT:How to collect variables from a URL, insert them into an array and dynamically change a href URLs? I'm not a developer so please be easy on me here! I am familiar with HTML and not bad at taking snippets of code from various sources and cobbling them together. This is the first time, I've ever decided to reach out for help on a blog like this because I've been looking around and just can't seem to find exactly what I need. Very close and yet so far.. Please help! What I want to do is: collect variables from the URL like this (wwww.myurl.com/index.html?var1=1&var2=2&var3=3 etc. etc..) Take those variables and insert them into an array while stripping out the un-needed parts. I found this code which gets it but prints it on the screen, which I don't need.. myurl.com/index.html?log=1&pass=2
 function addComment()
{
    var parameters = location.search.substring(1).split("&");

    var temp = parameters[0].split("=");
    l = unescape(temp[1]);

    temp = parameters[1].split("=");
    c = unescape(temp[1]);

    document.getElementById("log").innerHTML = l;
    document.getElementById("pass").innerHTML = c;
}
addComment();


<p>http://www.myurl.com/</b><span id="log" ></span></p>
<p>http://www.myurl.com/</b><span id="pass"></span></p>

</script>
 Dynamically alter a href tags on the fly based on the parameters gathered from the URL. I found this code which works great to alter the URLs but (a) the variable is gathered from an input form and I need to be able to take them from the URL. (b) I also need several of them (could be like 20) so an array is needed. <input type="text" id="mySearchBox" />
<a href="http://www.myurl.com/index.html?" onclick="this.href+=+document.getElementById('mySearchBox').value">Enter Parameter</a>
 (edited code format) Regarding the technology... I'm not stuck on any particular language or method but javascript and the jquery seems to be the easiest for me. I haven't done much with PHP and other languages. The easiest method for dummies you can provide the better. I'm sure this is like elementary school stuff to you out there but I just can't seem to figure it out so your advice is much appreciated!
@CODE:wwww.myurl.com/index.html?var1=1&var2=2&var3=3 myurl.com/index.html?log=1&pass=2 function addComment()
{
    var parameters = location.search.substring(1).split("&");

    var temp = parameters[0].split("=");
    l = unescape(temp[1]);

    temp = parameters[1].split("=");
    c = unescape(temp[1]);

    document.getElementById("log").innerHTML = l;
    document.getElementById("pass").innerHTML = c;
}
addComment();


<p>http://www.myurl.com/</b><span id="log" ></span></p>

</script> <input type="text" id="mySearchBox" />

@TITLE:404 Not Found Error in a simple Jetty/Maven Hello World webapp
@CONTENT:I have followed the instructions to create a "Standard WebApp with Jetty and Maven" precisely as described on the eclipse wiki: http://wiki.eclipse.org/Jetty/Tutorial/Jetty_and_Maven_HelloWorld#Developing_a_Standard_WebApp_with_Jetty_and_Maven However when I run the webapp (mvn jetty:run) and go to localhost:8080/hello-world/hello I end up at a "HTTP ERROR 404 Problem accessing /hello-world/hello. Reason: Not Found". I have read through documentation, looked at the wiki page's history, poked around other forums and stackoverflow threads, but can not find the answer to this seemingly simple problem. I will post my source, but it is literally the same as the tutorial. Any help would be appreciated. I'd really like to start playing around with this technology but its disheartening to keep slamming into the same dead end. (Please note: the first part of the tutorial to create "JettyMavenHelloWorld" work fine. My problem is with the second part, "JettyMavenHelloWarApp".

@LINK:/questions/12451013/immutable-objects-and-unmodifiable-collections
@TITLE:Immutable objects and unmodifiable collections
@CONTENT:With an immutable object, where is it proper to wrap a contained collection as unmodifiable? I see 3 options: In the immutable object's factory: public class ImmutableFactory {

    public Immutable build(){
       List<Integer> values = new ArrayList<Integer>();

        values.add(1);
        values.add(2);
        values.add(3);

        return new Immutable(Collections.unmodifiableList(values), "hello");
    }
}
 In the immutable's contructor public class Immutable {

    private final List<Integer> values;
    private final String hello;

    public Immutable(List<Integer> values, String hello) {
        this.values = Collections.unmodifiableList(values);
       this.hello = hello;
    }

    public List<Integer> getValues() {
        return values;
    }

    public String getHello() {
        return hello;
    }
}
 In the immutable's accessor (if applicable). public class Immutable {

    private final List<Integer> values;
    private final String hello;

    public Immutable(List<Integer> values, String hello) {
        this.values = values;
        this.hello = hello;
    }

    public List<Integer> getValues() {
        return Collections.unmodifiableList(values);
    }

    public String getHello() {
        return hello;
    }
}
 Are there any other options and which one is proper?
@CODE:public class ImmutableFactory {

    public Immutable build(){
       List<Integer> values = new ArrayList<Integer>();

        values.add(1);
        values.add(2);

       this.hello = hello;
    }

    public List<Integer> getValues() {

    }

    public String getHello() {

@TITLE:Replacing WaitForMultipleObjects in Qt
@CONTENT:I am not familar with WINAPI, and I am looking for a way to replace WaitForMultipleObjects used in one example I'm porting to Qt by anything using Qt only. Is it possible? EDIT: (Providing more information as requested in comments) A 3rd party API provides an array of events: HANDLE  m_hEv[MAX_EV];
 In an endles-loop of a thread, the program waits for the events like this: WaitForMultipleObjects(m_EvMax, m_hEv, FALSE ,INFINITE )
 The HANDLE type seems to be void*. So I wonder, if any Qt class could observe m_hEv for changes and unlock thread execution.

@TITLE:Complete removal and fresh install of python on Ubuntu 12.04
@CONTENT:This is embarrassing to admit, but I just continue to struggle with setting up my Python environment on an Ubuntu install. Sometimes I get it to work fine. But here's the problem: I feel like whenever I sit down to do some hobby hacking on a python project, I end up spending hours on end just trouble shooting inconsistencies with my python installation. Right now I keep getting an error message of: ImportError: cannot import name urandom 
 when trying to import a module called googleplaces (https://github.com/slimkrazy/python-google-places). But it's always something that causes me to go on an endless snipe hunt for the proper configuration of this that or the other. I just want to work on the project, not plumb around endlessly in forums. Which brings me to my point: How do I completely nuke my existing python setup (including virtualenv, pip, easy_install, etc. etc.) and just start from a completely clean slate? I have already tried reinstalling everything python from synaptic, but no success, still getting error. UPDATE: I've reinstalled virtualenv and that seems "ok" so far. Found that my import error is a permissions problem, if I import in the interactive using sudo, it passes fine. How should I be correcting my permissions so I don't have to run sudo? (Probably close this and start a new question.)

@LINK:/questions/12447427/c-maintaining-a-mixed-collection-of-subclass-objects
@TITLE:C++ maintaining a mixed collection of subclass objects
@CONTENT:Apologies if I'm missing a fairly fundamental concept here, but I'm trying to work out how to maintain a collection of multiple class types (all derived from the same parent) and still have access to their subclass-specific methods when retrieving them from the collection. As context, I have one base class ("BaseClass") and a number of classes (say "SubClassA" through "SubClassZ") that all derive from this base class. I also need to maintain a central indexed collection of all SubClass objects, which I have created as typedef unordered_map<std::string, BaseClass*> ItemCollectionType;
ItemCollectionType Items;
 The list will only ever contain SubClass objects but I've defined the list member type as a "BaseClass" pointer so that it can store instances of any sub class. So far, I'm assuming there's nothing particularly bad about this approach (but please correct me if I'm wrong). The issue I have is that sometimes I need to create a copy of these collections and their contents. The (simplified) code I have for this is as follows: ItemCollectionType CopiedItems;
ItemCollectionType::const_iterator it_end = Items.end();

for (ItemCollectionType::const_iterator it = Items.begin(); it != it_end; ++it) 
{
    BaseClass *src = it->second;
    BaseClass *item = new BaseClass(src);
    NewItems[item->code] = item;
}
 The obvious issue here is that the compiler will only call the BaseClass copy constructor, rather than that of the SubClass that "src" actually points to, because it does not know what type of SubClass it is. What is the recommended approach for a situation like this? Should I even be in a situation where I "lose" this sub class type information by adding to a collection of type BaseClass? I can't see any other way to maintain the collection but please let me know of any better alternative. Each SubClass object does contain a numeric ID that indicates which flavour of sub class it is; as a result, is it possible to write a function that translates this numeric ID into a "type" object, which can then be used to cast the source object before calling the copy constructor? Is this a valid use for templating? Of course, this could be terrible programming practice and/or not possible. I'm just certain there should be a better option than the simplest and least-maintainable solution of switch (src->code)
{
    case SubClassTypes::VarietyA:
        SubClassA *item = new SubClassA( *((SubClassA*)src) );
        Items[item->code] = item;
        break;
    case SubClassTypes::VarietyB:
        SubClassB *item = new SubClassB( *((SubClassB*)src) );
        Items[item->code] = item;
        break;
    ...
    ...
}
@CODE:typedef unordered_map<std::string, BaseClass*> ItemCollectionType;
ItemCollectionType Items; ItemCollectionType CopiedItems;
ItemCollectionType::const_iterator it_end = Items.end();

{
    BaseClass *src = it->second;

@LINK:/questions/12446912/sql-service-broker-collecting-data-from-distributed-sources
@TITLE:SQL Service Broker: Collecting data from distributed sources.
@CONTENT:Summary: I need to collect data reliably from the satelite SQL servers using the SQL Server Service Broker. I need to design the protokol that allows a kind of plug-in another satelite SQL server smoothly. (I am going to refine the question based on your suggestions -- including pictures. But I need to start somehow.) Background: I do have one central SQL server (Microsoft, SQL 2008 R2 Standard ed.) and several small ones near the production machines (the same version, Express edition). The small server collects temperatures from sensors into the table defined this way: CREATE TABLE dbo.line_sensor_values (
    UTC DATETIME NOT NULL,
    line_no TINYINT NOT NULL,   -- line number: 1, 2, 3, etc.
    sensor_no TINYINT NOT NULL, -- sensor number: 1, 2, 3, etc.
    sensor_value float NULL,    -- the measured value

  PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED (
    UTC ASC,
    line_no ASC,
    sensor_no ASC
  )
)
 The line_no is constant for the small SQL at the production line. The same table is created at the central SQL server, that can be temporarily physically disconnected from the small servers. (You know, the real, physical environment.) The goal is to transwer all the collected data from the small SQL servers to the central ones. All the servers have the tables created; however, they know nothing about the data at the other side of communication. This way, some protocol must be designed to make the data collection working. A kind of hanshake must be designed to know where to continue with the data transfer after reconnection or after the failure of the sensor data collection. The central server uses the collected sensor data to be processed as finalisation of some tasks. Say, the data points of certain sensor from certain line (known to the task) must be processed to form the chart. The task knows the time interval for which the sensor values are to be collected. However, the task database environment is not synchronized by events with collection of data. This way, UTC interval is the only way to determine whether the sensor data belong to the task or not. Again, the data sensor sampling interval is independent on the task, and the SQL servers may be disconnected temporarily. Sometimes, the sensor may be broken, or there can be another reason for missing physical data from the sensor. However, if there is the sensor data with the UTC time, it means that all previous values or exist in the table or they never existed. Consequently, the way to know whether the data for the task are complete is equal to the knowledge that there are newer data for the sensor (produced after the UTC range interval for the task). The goal is that no collected sensor value is lost. The ideal goal is that there is no need for any other special invocation of the functionality (i.e. via any kind of scheduler). What was done already: Basically, the sensor inserts the data into the dedicated table (other than the mentioned dbo.line_sensor_values above). The trigger gets the data and transforms them, and inserts them to the dbo.line_sensor_values. In other words, the table at the satelite machine is already collecting the data. It already works. This trigger or another mean could be used to send the sensor value via the Service Broker. The stored procedure that takes the task, checks the table at the central SQL server for the sensor data, and makes the chart if the data is present was already designed and it works. However, it was use only manually as a proof of the concept. The Service Broker setting was already suggested earlier. But the Service Broker communication for the purpose was not designed nor partly tested, yet. I understand this is a broad question. This way I am going to split it to separate questions... Separate questions to be solved: SQL Service Broker: Collecting data X plug-in scenario analysis Thanks for your time and experience, Petr

@LINK:/questions/12446912/sql-service-broker-collecting-data-from-distributed-sources
@TITLE:SQL Service Broker: Collecting data from distributed sources.
@CONTENT:Summary: I need to collect data reliably from the satelite SQL servers using the SQL Server Service Broker. I need to design the protokol that allows a kind of plug-in another satelite SQL server smoothly. (I am going to refine the question based on your suggestions -- including pictures. But I need to start somehow.) Background: I do have one central SQL server (Microsoft, SQL 2008 R2 Standard ed.) and several small ones near the production machines (the same version, Express edition). The small server collects temperatures from sensors into the table defined this way: CREATE TABLE dbo.line_sensor_values (
    UTC DATETIME NOT NULL,
    line_no TINYINT NOT NULL,   -- line number: 1, 2, 3, etc.
    sensor_no TINYINT NOT NULL, -- sensor number: 1, 2, 3, etc.
    sensor_value float NULL,    -- the measured value

  PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED (
    UTC ASC,
    line_no ASC,
    sensor_no ASC
  )
)
 The line_no is constant for the small SQL at the production line. The same table is created at the central SQL server, that can be temporarily physically disconnected from the small servers. (You know, the real, physical environment.) The goal is to transwer all the collected data from the small SQL servers to the central ones. All the servers have the tables created; however, they know nothing about the data at the other side of communication. This way, some protocol must be designed to make the data collection working. A kind of hanshake must be designed to know where to continue with the data transfer after reconnection or after the failure of the sensor data collection. The central server uses the collected sensor data to be processed as finalisation of some tasks. Say, the data points of certain sensor from certain line (known to the task) must be processed to form the chart. The task knows the time interval for which the sensor values are to be collected. However, the task database environment is not synchronized by events with collection of data. This way, UTC interval is the only way to determine whether the sensor data belong to the task or not. Again, the data sensor sampling interval is independent on the task, and the SQL servers may be disconnected temporarily. Sometimes, the sensor may be broken, or there can be another reason for missing physical data from the sensor. However, if there is the sensor data with the UTC time, it means that all previous values or exist in the table or they never existed. Consequently, the way to know whether the data for the task are complete is equal to the knowledge that there are newer data for the sensor (produced after the UTC range interval for the task). The goal is that no collected sensor value is lost. The ideal goal is that there is no need for any other special invocation of the functionality (i.e. via any kind of scheduler). What was done already: Basically, the sensor inserts the data into the dedicated table (other than the mentioned dbo.line_sensor_values above). The trigger gets the data and transforms them, and inserts them to the dbo.line_sensor_values. In other words, the table at the satelite machine is already collecting the data. It already works. This trigger or another mean could be used to send the sensor value via the Service Broker. The stored procedure that takes the task, checks the table at the central SQL server for the sensor data, and makes the chart if the data is present was already designed and it works. However, it was use only manually as a proof of the concept. The Service Broker setting was already suggested earlier. But the Service Broker communication for the purpose was not designed nor partly tested, yet. I understand this is a broad question. This way I am going to split it to separate questions... Separate questions to be solved: SQL Service Broker: Collecting data X plug-in scenario analysis Thanks for your time and experience, Petr

@TITLE:Set Different Umask For Files And Folders
@CONTENT:I am writing a bash script to update some files/directories and I want to run umask in the script to set default permissions for files/directories created by the script. I know I can umask to set the permissions for both files and directories however I need the permissions to be different for files and folders. I want files to be:   -rw----r-- (0604)
I want folders to be: drwx-----x (0701)
 Can I do this using umask? If so how do I go about doing it? If not what is the best way to achieve it? Thank you in advance.

The variable model represents a partial model- assignment to only some of the variables. The function call EXTEND(P, true, model) returns a new partial model in which P has the value true. function  TT-ENTAILS? (KB,\) returns  true  or  false
  inputs: KB, the knowledge base, a sentence in propositional logic

@TITLE:Deploying spring web apps using Spring Tool Suite
@CONTENT:I'm new to Java web framework, I googled to find that spring is one of the most popular framework. I tried to install tools and searched a tutorial to run spring framework on my mac. step 1 - Tomcat installation Following this site, I could install Tomcat on my mac. I'm using :8080 port for Tomcat. step 2 - spring tool suite installation From this site, I could install Spring Tool Suite. step 3 - making an example following tutorial I found a tutorial on using Spring Tool Suite. Following the procedure, I could build manolitomvc app. step 4.1 - deployment <-- issue 1 Finally, I'd like to access the web app at http://localhost:8080/manolitomvc. I clicked the green arrow to see the error message. step 4.2 - deployment <-- issue 2 I opened overview page, and I guessed that I could set server location and deploy path to make spring web app available. However, I have no idea how to set the server location (Tomcat server location that I installed in step1). I tried to copy the manolitomvc directory into Tomcat main document directory(/Library/Tomcat/webapps), but it doesn't work. How can I deploy the web app so that I can access the spring web app at http://localhost:8080/manolitomvc? Could you recommend any other practical tutorial that I can follow to setup and use spring framework?

@CONTENT:I have been developing apps on Android for a while now. I have the development environment installed on my laptop and everything was working till this morning. I had the v15 and v10 SDK platforms and emulators installed. Just to try the Android Jelly Bean emulator, I tried to download the v16 SDK from SDK Manager. That led to a series of updates in SDK manager and then the ADT plug in also. Since that I have been facing this issue whenever I try to start the emulator. I have searched a lot and tried all of the following methods but the error still persists. I have a Intel Core 2 Duo laptop with the Mobile Intel(R) 4 Series Express Chipset Family graphics card. The latest driver version 8.15.10.2555 is installed now. 1) Uninstalled the newly installed Jelly Bean v16 SDK components. 2) Uninstalled and reinstalled Android SDK and ADT plugin. 3) Updated my graphics driver. 4) Tried number of combinations of AVD settings (camera off, gps off, accelerometer off, resolutions, RAM size, SD card size) Any help is greatly appreciated.

@TITLE:Sending Mail from Windows Azure Service, using Godaddy SMTP
@CONTENT:With the following settings I have not been able to send mails from local PC. Having searched stack overflow for many responses - I tried swapping host from smtpout.secureserver.net to relay-hosting.secureserver.net. Which didn't help. (Probably because relay-hosting has to be used when hosting on godaddy server) My host is windows azure service.. I read on SO that defaultCredentials & enableSSL is mutually exclusive. Please suggest. Port 25 may be blocked by several ISP, so as an alternative port 80 could be used for sending mail using http. System.net.Mail doesn't support godaddy's 465 port for https. Having tried all these possibilities, I end up with either of the two errors - Failure sending Mail - Unable to connect with remote server. The SMTP server requires a secure connection or the client was not authenticated. Question 1. Please suggest precisely, what piece of configuration do I need to use godaddy smtp server from Windows Azure service?

Dim RefRange As Range, queryRange As Range, checkCell As Rnage
String pasteDate As String

Set RefRange = Range("A1:A50")
Set queryRange = .Selected

For Each checkCell In queryRange

@TITLE:Prevent the default blue selection on click
@CONTENT:As a normal website, when I develop website as a native android application, There is a blue rectangle selection on the area I clicked after the click like a normal site while surfing in the android. I would like to know if there is any way preventing that, so the applicatin will have a real native-like GUI. Thanks!

@TITLE:Mono.Security.Cryptography RijndaelManaged class issue using CFB-8 mode
@CONTENT:I'm writing to report about cryptography issue. The problem happens using RijndaelManaged class from the System.Security.Cryptography. It is important for me to use RijndaelManaged with CFB-8 (FeedbackSize = 8) mode without padding (PaddingMode.None). Such settings configuration makes encrypted data size equal to the decrypted data size. Unfortunately Mono (Mono Compiler for MVS2010 IDE v2.0.8152) compiled code throws exception on data encryption with message: [Unhandled Exception: System.Security.Cryptography.CryptographicException: invalid block length at Mono.Security.Cryptography.SymmetricTransform.FinalEncrypt]. 
 I made tests with the .NET framework 4.0 under Windows XP and Windows 7, using the native Visual Studio 2010 compiler. I found that the native Microsoft .NET compiler does not throw any exceptions, and the code example works well. Below I have pasted two examples (Repro code), one for Mono which throws an exception and one for native C# compiler in this case there are no exceptions. Also I have also pasted links to online compilers to test the code. Why is the Mono Compiler throwing this exception? Mono code Sample (Online compiler for testing, Compile Online) using System;

@TITLE:How do I run large SQL scripts that contain many keywords, including GO using C#?
@CONTENT:I'm creating a web application that serves as a front end to do SQL Replication. I have many scripts stored in the properties of the program. Let's use the first one as an example. The first script is the script that you get from creating a publication on the publisher server. USE [<<SOURCE_DATABASE_NAME>>]
EXEC sp_replicationdboption @dbname = N'<<SOURCE_DATABASE_NAME>>',
    @optname = N'publish', @value = N'true'
GO
USE [<<SOURCE_DATABASE_NAME>>]
EXEC [<<SOURCE_DATABASE_NAME>>].sys.sp_addlogreader_agent @job_login = N'XXX\Admin',
    @job_password = NULL, @publisher_security_mode = 0,
    @publisher_login = N'Admin', @publisher_password = N'<<PASSWORD>>',
    @job_name = NULL
GO

USE [<<SOURCE_DATABASE_NAME>>]

 Instead of running this script in SQL Management Studio, I want to use my web application to run it. I tried: public static void CreatePublication(string server, string query)
{
    string finalConnString = Properties.Settings.Default.rawConnectionString.Replace("<<DATA_SOURCE>>", server).Replace("<<INITIAL_CATALOG>>", "tempdb");

     using (SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection(finalConnString))
     {
         using (SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand(query, conn))
         {
             conn.Open();

             cmd.ExecuteNonQuery();
         }
      }
}

public static string ConstructCreatePublicationScript(string rawPublicationScript, string rawAddArticleScript,
            string password, string sourceServerName, string sourceDatabaseName, List<string> selectedTables)
{
    string createPublicationScript = "";
    string addArticleScript = "";

    createPublicationScript = rawPublicationScript.Replace("<<PASSWORD>>", password)
            .Replace("<<SOURCE_SERVER_NAME>>", sourceServerName)
            .Replace("<<SOURCE_DATABASE_NAME>>", sourceDatabaseName);

    createPublicationScript = createPublicationScript + "\n\n";

    foreach (string selectedTable in selectedTables)
    {
        addArticleScript = rawAddArticleScript.Replace("<<SOURCE_DATABASE_NAME>>", sourceDatabaseName)
             .Replace("<<SOURCE_TABLE_NAME>>", selectedTable);

             createPublicationScript = createPublicationScript + addArticleScript + "\n\n";
     }
            //write script to file

            return createPublicationScript;
     }
 But ran into this error: SqlException was caught Incorrect syntax near 'GO'. Incorrect syntax near 'GO'. Incorrect syntax near 'GO'. Incorrect syntax near 'GO'. Incorrect syntax near 'GO'. My question is, how can I run this whole script above in C#? Should I just get rid of the "GO" keywords?

@CONTENT:I just noticed something unusual. This is what I want to accomplish: I want a div to be shown when I click a link I want the div to disappear when I click somewhere else in the document I don't want it to disappear when I click the div itself Something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/XPmyF/ JS: (function() {
    var box = $('#box');
    $(document).on('click', function() {
        if (box.css('display') == 'block') {
            box.css('display', 'none');
        }
    });
    $('#start').on('click', function(e) {
        box.css({
            'text': 'Box',
            'position': 'absolute',
            'top': '50px',
            'left': '0',
            'background': '#EEE',
            'border': '1px solid #555',

        e.stopPropagation();
    });

    box.on('click', function(e) {
        e.stopPropagation();
    });
})();?
 That fiddle works just fine but when I tested that in Firefox (15.0.1), if you right-click on the div, it dissapears, which is not the behavior I'm looking for. It seems that stopPropagation() works for clicks but not right-clicks in Firefox. Chrome keeps right-clicks from propagating to the document. How can I fix it? Thanks

@CONTENT:Ive got a question regarding the validation of uniqueness. From : http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations_callbacks.html#uniqueness "It does not create a uniqueness constraint in the database, so it may happen that two different database connections create two records with the same value for a column that you intend to be unique. To avoid that, you must create a unique index in your database." Does that mean whenever I validate uniqueness I have to add an index in the database? Or is this only necessary when its likely to happen that two recors are going to be inserted at the same time? Whats the best practice here: Unique and Index always together or dependant on the situation?

    setContentView(R.layout.topic_edit);

    TextView text = (TextView) dialog.findViewById(R.id.please_wait_text);
    text.setText("Please wait while the comment loads...");
    dialog.show();
 I declare Dialog dialog right before the class declaration, and then whenever I try to dismiss it with dialog.dismiss(); it doesn't close. Here is the please_wait.xml <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<RelativeLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"

</RelativeLayout>
 Would someone know why the dialog does not close on dialog.dismiss()... I try the dismiss in an async call after the call returns. But I did check, and the line dialog.dismiss() is executed, just for some reason does not close the dialog. This is how I try to dismiss the dialog: @Override

    dialog.dismiss();
}

@LINK:/questions/12424776/static-variables-not-returning-correctly
@TITLE:Static variables not returning correctly?
@CONTENT:I'm building a little app, that's working quite nicely with a service and activity right now. Although, I'm trying to save some static information upon login (like has the service been started already?) into a static boolean, isRunning. It will set to true upon onCreate(), but when I call it later from the activity, it always returns false. From the service: public static boolean isRunning = false;

public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();
    isRunning = true;
}
 Does anyone know why this doesn't work? I've tried using some logs to figure out what's happening but I can't seem to figure it out. From the activity public void onResume() {
        super.onResume();
        if(mIsBound) {
            Log.i(LOG_TAG, "Resuming: Service is running");
            if(Service.isRunning) {
                Log.e(LOG_TAG, "SERVICE IS RUNNING!");
            } else {
                Log.e(LOG_TAG, "SERVICE IS NOT RUNNING!");
            }
        } else {
            Log.i(LOG_TAG, "Resuming: Service NOT running");
        }
        StopCheck.setChecked(mIsBound);
    }
 The mIsBound is what is being created by the activity to bind to the service (I wanted it to rebind, but that seems to be impossible), and it's reliable in its current state. But not outside of that activity, that's what I want to use the static variable for. The Service.isRunning should return true, if mIsBound equals to true. Yet the result of that little test in my log is "Resuming: Service is running" followed by "SERVICE IS NOT RUNNING". Any suggestions or questions are very much appreciated.

@CONTENT:I have a domain model, persisted in a database, which represents a graph. A graph consists of nodes (e.g. NodeTypeA, NodeTypeB) which are connected via branches. The two generic elements (nodes and branches will have properties). A graph will be sent to a computation engine. To perform computations the engine has to be initialised like so (simplified pseudo code): Engine Engine = new Engine() ;
Object ID1 = Engine.AddNodeTypeA(TypeA.Property1, TypeA.Property2, K, TypeA.Propertyn);
Object ID2 = Engine.AddNodeTypeB(TypeB.Property1, TypeB.Property2, K, TypeB.Propertyn);
Engine.AddBranch(ID1,ID2);
 Finally the computation is performed like this: Engine.DoSomeComputation();
 I am just wondering, if there are any relevant design patterns out there, which help to achieve the above using good design principles. I hope this makes sense. Any feedback would be very much appreciated.
@CODE:Engine Engine = new Engine() ;
Object ID1 = Engine.AddNodeTypeA(TypeA.Property1, TypeA.Property2, K, TypeA.Propertyn);

@TITLE:discrepancy between build result and Problems view in Eclipse CDT
@CONTENT:I'm using Eclipse 4.2, with CDT, and MinGW toolchain on a Windows machine (although I've a feeling the problem has nothing to do with this specific configuration). The G++ compiler is 4.7 I'm playing with c++11 features, with the following code: #include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>
#include <memory>
#include <vector>
#include <list>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main( int argc, char* argv[] )
{
    vector<int> v { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 };
    int x {5};
    auto mark = remove_if( v.begin(), v.end(), [x](int n) { return n<x; } );
    v.erase( mark, v.end() );
    for( int x : v ) { cout << x << ", "; }
    cout << endl;
}
 Everything is very straight forward and idiomatic c++11. The code compiles with no problems on the command line (g++ -std=c++11 hello.cpp). In order to make this code compile In eclipse, I set the compiler to support C++11: Properties -> C/C++ Build -> Settings -> Miscellaneous -> Ohter Flags: I'm adding -std=c++11 Properties -> C/C++Build -> Discovery Options -> Compiler invocation arguments: Adding -std=c++11 That's the only change I did to either the global preferences or to the project properties. First Question: Why do I've to change the flags in two places? When each compiler flags is used? If I hit Ctrl-B, the project will build successfully, as expected, and running it from within eclipse show the expected result (It prints: '5, 6, 7,'). However, the editor view shows red marks of error on both the 'remove_if' line, and the 'v.erase' line. Similarly, the Problems view shows I've these two problems. Looking at the details of the problem, I get: For the remove_if line: 'Invalid arguments. Candidates are: #0 remove_if(#0, #0, #1) For the erase line: 'Invalid arguments Candidates are: '? erase(?), ? erase(?,?)' Second questions: It appears there are two different builds: one for continues status, and one for the actual build. Is that right? If so, do they have different rule (compilation flags, include paths, etc.)? Third question: In the problem details I also see: 'Name resolution problem found by the indexer'. I guess this is why the error message are so cryptic. Are those messages coming from MinGW g++ compiler or from Eclipse? What is this Name resolution? How do I fix? Appreciate your help. EDIT (in reply to @Eugene): Thank you Eugene. I've opened a bug on Eclipse. I think that C++11 is only partially to blame. I've cleaned my code from C++11 stuff, and removed the -std=c++11 flag from both compilation switch. And yet, the CodAn barks on the remove_if line: int pred( int n ) { return n < 5; }

int main( int argc, char* argv[] )
{
    vector<int> v;
    for( int i=0; i<=7; ++i ) { 
        v.push_back( i );
    }

    vector<int>::iterator mark = remove_if( v.begin(), v.end(), pred );
    v.erase( mark, v.end() );

    for( vector<int>::iterator i = v.begin(); i != v.end(); ++i ) {
        cout << *i << ", ";
    }
    cout << endl;
}
 The code compiles just fine (with Ctrl-B), but CodAn doesn't like the remove_if line, saying: Invalid Arguments, Candidates are '#0 remove_if(#0,#0,#1)'. This is a very cryptic message - it appears it misses to substitute arguments in format string (#0 for 'iterator' and #1 for 'predicate'). I'm going to update the bug. Interestingly, using 'list' instead of 'vector' clears up the error. However, as for my question, I'm curious about how the CodAn work. Does it uses g++ (with a customized set of flags), or another external tool (lint?), or does it do it internally in Java? If there is a tool, how can I get its command line argument, and its output?

[3/4]
[4/4]
 Probably some javascript somewhere is updating with something like: div.innerHTML = "[2/4]"; 
 My question is: can I somehow intercept/(listen to) innerHTML changes so that I could monitor how long they take. I am in a position where I could inject any javascript and I would like to collect something like console.log("1/4 has been called at timestamp");
console.log("2/4 has been called at timestamp");
console.log("3/4 has been called at timestamp");
...
@CODE:[1/4]
[2/4]
[3/4]
[4/4] div.innerHTML = "[2/4]"; console.log("1/4 has been called at timestamp");
console.log("2/4 has been called at timestamp");
console.log("3/4 has been called at timestamp");

@LINK:/questions/12421029/why-is-my-conditional-format-offset-when-added-by-vba
@TITLE:Why is my conditional format offset when added by VBA?
@CONTENT:I was trying to add conditional formats like this: If expression =($G5<>"") then make set interior green, use this for $A$5:$H$25. Tried this, worked fine, as expected, then tried to adapt this as VBA-Code with following code, which is working, but not as expected: With ActiveSheet.UsedRange.Offset(1)
  .FormatConditions.Delete
  'set used row range to green interior color, if "Erledigt Datum" is not empty
  With .FormatConditions.Add(Type:=xlExpression, _
                             Formula1:="=($" & cstrDefaultProgressColumn & _
                                                      .row & "<>"""")")
        .Interior.ColorIndex = 4
      End With
End With
 The Problem is, .row is providing the right row while in debug, however my added conditional-formula seems to be one or more rows off - depending on my solution for setting the row. So I am ending up with a conditional formatting, which has an offset to the row, which should have been formatted. In the dialog it is then =($G6<>"") or G3 or G100310 or something like this. But not my desired G5. Setting the row has to be dynamicall, because this is used to setup conditional formats on different worksheets, which can have their data starting at different rows. I was suspecting my With arrangement, but it did not fix this problem. edit: To be more specific, this is NOT a UsedRange problem, having the same trouble with this: Dim rngData As Range
Set rngData = ActiveSheet.Range("A:H") 'ActiveSheet.UsedRange.Offset(1)

rngData.FormatConditions.Delete

With rngData.FormatConditions.Add(Type:=xlExpression, _
                                  Formula1:="=($" & cstrDefaultProgressColumn & _
                                                  1 & "<>"""")")
    .Interior.ColorIndex = 4
End With
 My Data looks like this: 1 -> empty cells
2 -> empty cells
3 -> empty cells
4 -> TitleCols -> A;B;C;...;H
5 -> Data to TitleCols

 When I execute this edited code on Excel 2007 and lookup the formula in the conditional dialog it is =($G1048571<>"") - it should be =($G1<>""), then everything works fine. Whats even more strange - this is an edited version of a fine working code, which used to add conditional formats for each row. But then I realized, that it's possible to write an expression, which formats a whole row or parts of it - thought this would be adapted in a minute, and now this ^^ edit: Additional task informations I use conditional formatting here, because this functions shall setup a table to react on user input. So, if properly setup and a user edits some cell in my conditionalized column of this tabel, the corresponding row will turn green for the used range of rows. Now, because there might be rows before the main header-row and there might be a various number of data-columns, and also the targeted column may change, I do of course use some specific informations. To keep them minimal, I do use NamedRanges to determine the correct offset and to determine the correct DefaultProgessColumn. GetTitleRow is used to determine the header-row by NamedRange or header-contents. With ActiveSheet.UsedRange.Offset(GetTitleRow(ActiveSheet.UsedRange) - _
                                ActiveSheet.UsedRange.Rows(1).row + 1)
 Corrected my Formula1, because I found the construct before not well formed. Formula1:="=(" & Cells(.row, _
           Range(strMatchCol1).Column).Address(RowAbsolute:=False) & _
           "<>"""")"
 strMatchCol1 - is the name of a range.

@CONTENT:I am looking for a way to open many connections to websites in java. My problem is that the server response times are really slow in many occasions. I therefore thought it would be a good idea to look for some java library that can handle opening many connections and that perhaps uses a handler when the connection/response is ready. Is there something like (this is pseudo code!!) getWebsiteContent(URL url) { //does not wait for the response
new AsynchronousConnection(url) {

    requestServedHandler(ConnectionObject) {
        InputStream is = ConnectionObject.getInputStream();

        //here I will process the content of the stream only when it is available
    }

 I would not mind a handler that gives me the raw HTML.

@CONTENT:I know there have been many questions answered on this topic, but none of them worked. Using apache2.2, mod_wsgi 3.3, python 2.7.3 and django 1.4 on centos6.2. I tried starting up my code form urls.py, it is executed random amount of times and is executed randomly after startup is already finished. Next I tried using middleware trick explained here Where to put Django startup code? ,startup code was also executed random amount of times (printing out some debug messages, seeing same message multiple times). The problem is, I wish to have one global TCP Client, connecting and communicating with TCP Server. It should be Initialized only once, if it randomly creates new instance old connection will be lost, destroyed who knows when and that socket will probably be destroyed when os runs out of memory (not sure about that). So the goal would be to have one global TCP Client, being used by all functions that trigger TCP Client functions such as Connect/Disconnect/Send/Receive. Is there some kind of apache or mod_wsgi option for that? I am running same configuration on Windows 7 and everything works without a problem.

NSArray *a = @[n1, s];
NSDictionary *d = @{ @"ha" : @1, @3 : @"hello" };

NSLog(@"retain count of @1 is %i", [n1 retainCount]);
NSLog(@"retain count of @2 is %i", [n2 retainCount]);
NSLog(@"retain count of @3 is %i", [n3 retainCount]);
NSLog(@"retain count of @100 is %i", [n100 retainCount]);

NSLog(@"retain count of @\"haha\" is %i", [s retainCount]);

NSLog(@"retain count of array literal is %i", [a retainCount]);
NSLog(@"retain count of dictionary literal is %i", [d retainCount]);
 and the result is: retain count of @1 is 10
retain count of @2 is 4
retain count of @3 is 5
retain count of @100 is 1
retain count of @"haha" is -1
retain count of array literal is 1
retain count of dictionary literal is 1
 so the retain count of array literal and dictionary literal is 1, and string literal is said to exist for the whole app's running, so that's why it is -1 (probably meaning MAX unsigned int), but the retain count of @1 actually come out as 7, 8, and 10 at different times. Is there a rule to it? I found that I can do [n1 retain] and [n1 release] as well, and it will increase and decrease the retain count accordingly.
@CODE:NSNumber *n1 = @1;
NSNumber *n2 = @2;
NSNumber *n3 = @3;
NSNumber *n100 = @100;

NSString *s = @"haha";
NSArray *a = @[n1, s];
NSDictionary *d = @{ @"ha" : @1, @3 : @"hello" };

retain count of @2 is 4
retain count of @3 is 5
retain count of @100 is 1
retain count of @"haha" is -1
retain count of array literal is 1
retain count of dictionary literal is 1 @1 [n1 retain] [n1 release]

@TITLE:How to enable Software Update in an Eclipse product?
@CONTENT:In my Eclipse project, I defined a simple plugin (bundle), a feature that includes the plugin and a product that includes the feature. When I export the poduct (via the "Eclipse Product export wizard" of the product editor), it does build the product. I can launch the product, everything works fine (the plugin is there and doing what it is supposed to do). The only problem is that the user of the product cannot install additional Eclipse features using the Software Update menu (Help -> Software Updates). The Software Updates sub-menus ("Find and Install..." and "Manage Configuration...") are grayed out. What plugins and/or features are we supposed to add to the product so the product could accept additional features using the Software Updates menu ? I tried to add a bunch of org.eclipse.equinox.p2.* plugins, but it is still not working.   <plugin id="org.eclipse.equinox.p2.artifact.repository"/>

@LINK:/questions/12413988/how-can-i-convert-validation-error-field-names-to-input-names-in-cakephp
@TITLE:How can I convert validation error field names to input names in CakePHP?
@CONTENT:I have a CakePHP (latest version) web app with forms and validation all working properly using traditional postback, but now I'm switching some of the forms to submit via ajax. When there are validation errors, I would like to get them back on the client as JSON formatted like so: {
"success":false,
"errors":{
    "data[User][username]":["This is not a valid e-mail address"],
    "data[User][password]":["You must choose a password"]
}}
 The keys for the errors array need to correspond to the name attribute on the form fields. We have some prebuilt client script that is expecting JSON formatted in this way. The good news is that this is very close to what the validationErrors object looks like in CakePHP. So I'm currently doing this in my controller: if ($this->User->save($this->request->data)) {

} else {
    if ($this->request->is('ajax')) {
        $this->autoRender = $this->layout = false;
        $response['success'] = false;
        $response['errors'] = $this->User->validationErrors;
        echo json_encode($response);
        exit(0);
    }
}
 However, this is what the JSON response looks like: {
"success":false,
"errors":{
    "username":["This is not a valid e-mail address"],
    "password":["You must choose a password"]
}}
 Note that the errors keys have just the basic database table field names in them. They are not converted into data[User][username] format, which the FormHelper usually takes care of. Is there some easy way to adjust the array before I return it? I don't want to simply loop through and prepend "data[User]" because that is not robust enough. I'd like some code I can put in one place and call from various controllers for various models. What does FormHelper use to come up with the input name attributes? Can I tap into that? Should I somehow use a JSON view?
@CODE:{
"success":false,
"errors":{
    "data[User][username]":["This is not a valid e-mail address"],
    "data[User][password]":["You must choose a password"]
}} if ($this->User->save($this->request->data)) {

} else {
    if ($this->request->is('ajax')) {
        $this->autoRender = $this->layout = false;
        $response['success'] = false;
        $response['errors'] = $this->User->validationErrors;
        echo json_encode($response);
        exit(0);
    }
} {
"success":false,
"errors":{
    "username":["This is not a valid e-mail address"],
    "password":["You must choose a password"]
}}

@TITLE:Fetch a specific tag from Rally in order to compute a value in another field
@CONTENT:I'm extremely new to Rally development so my question may sound dumb (but couldn't find how to do it from rally's help or from previous posts here) :) I've started from the rally freeform grid example - my purpose is to implement a Business Value calculator: I fill the score field with a 5-digit figure where each number is a score in the 1-5 range. Then I compute a business value as the result of a calculation, where each number is weighted by a preset weight. I can sort my stories by Business Value to help me prioritize my backlog: that's the first step, and it works. Now what I want to do is to make my freeform grid editable: I am extracting each of my digits as a separate column, but those columns are display-only. How can I turn them into something editable? What I want to do of course is update back the score field based on the values input in each custom column. Here's an example: I have a record with score "15254", which means Business Value criteria 1 scores 1 out of 5, Business Value criteria 2 scores 5 out of 5, and so on... In the end my Business Value is computed as "1*1 + 5*2 + 2*3 + 5*4 + 4*5 = 57". So far this is the part that works. Now let's say I found that the third criteria should not score 2 but 3, I want to be able to edit the value in the corresponding column and have my score field updated to "15354", and my Business Value to display 60 instead of 57. Here is my current code, I'll be really grateful if you can help me with turning that grid into something editable :) <!--Include SDK-->

@TITLE:Pascal's Triangle Row Sequence
@CONTENT:I'm currently working on finding the row sequences of Pascal's triangle. I wanted to input the row number and output the sequence of numbers in a list up until that row. For example, (Pascal 4) would give the result (1 1 1 1 2 1 1 3 3 1). I am trying to use an algorithm that I found. Here is the algorithm itself: Vc = Vc-1 * ((r - c)/c) r and c are supposed to be row and column, and V0=1. The algorithm can be specifically found on the wikipedia page in the section titled "Calculating and Individual Row or Diagonal." Here is the code that I have so far: (define pascal n)
  (cond((zero? n) '())
       ((positive? n) (* pascal (- n 1) (/ (- n c)c))))
 I know that's hardly anything but I've been struggling a lot on trying to find scoping the function with a let or a lambda to incorporate column values. Additionally, I've also been struggling on the recursion. I don't really know how to establish the base case and how to get to the next step. Basically, I've been getting pretty lost everywhere. I know this isn't showing much, but any step in the right direction would be greatly appreciated.

@LINK:/questions/12413149/persist-a-value-in-an-web-application-without-using-the-session-context
@TITLE:Persist a value in an web application without using the session context
@CONTENT:I have a "variable" that users can modify in a JSP/Struts application that must be persisted across that entire web application's session. They may navigate away from the page where it is set and viewed (still staying in the application), and when they come come back the value they last set for that variable should still be present. The obvious choice would be to store it as a session attribute. And that's what I would have done a few years ago. But Internet Explorer 8 and higher cause a web app user to have one session for all browsers that are open to the same site. In other words, if a user opens my application in a browser, then opens it a second time in another browser, they share a single session. I presume they are sharing the cookies that represent that session. The result is if they change the value in one browser's session, that value will then be changed in the other browser as well. My users will run the web app multiple times on a single workstation, and I need for them to be able to set different values for the above mentioned variable in their different browser windows (or even tabs), and have the different values persist for that browser (or tab) lifetime, but not affect any other open browsers (or tabs) to the same application. So, as far as I can tell using session attributes is out of the question. (Well there is the IE -nomerge option, but there is no way to force the users to launch IE using that option). I am hoping I am not the first to deal with this issue, and someone out there has solved it elegantly, and that person reads this post and responds.

I've looked up methods for SendMessage and PostMessage What I've done so far: This is an example of post here that would have been exactly what I want if it didn't use Qt and would work on an external application. Everything I've been able to find is about creating a right click menu when I just want to view an external application's right click menu. I've tried getting the handle of the context menu using Spy++ but the menu just disappears as soon as I select the "Find Window" option in Spy++ (which is to be expected). The only way I could think of doing this is using mouse_event to display the box but then I don't know where to go from there. I feel like this would also be very inefficient. I'm working on some legacy code so I don't have a lot of choice in what I can use, if it's possible I'd like to not use libraries that aren't included in Visual Studio 2008. What I'm trying to do: I'm looking for a way to access the right click context menu in an external application and read the data in it and then select an item. I feel like this should be really simple but my research skills are subpar. If anyone can point me in the right direction I would really appreciate it. Thank you for reading!

@TITLE:How to allow users to select the Android app's installation location (SD card or internal storage)
@CONTENT:I need to allow a user to select whether the app should be installed to an SD card or the internal memory. I cannot find any information about that at developer.android.com. The only thing I can do is to specify android:installLocation as "internalOnly", "auto", or "preferExternal". However, I'd like to let users choose that when the app is being installed. Is it possible to do that on Android?

@LINK:/questions/12408784/ksoap2-multipart-related-response
@TITLE:kSoap2 multipart/related response
@CONTENT:We have problems with getting a response from a webservice when we want to call it. We are using the KSOAP2 Library and when we want to get normal SOAPObjects with Content-Type text/xml it all goes well but now we need to get a response from a action who gives back a content-type: multipart/related. So the standard code doesn't work. public SoapObject getDocuments(String id, String type)
{

    SoapObject Request = new SoapObject(NAMESPACE, METHOD_NAME_GETDOCUMENTS);
    Request.addProperty("humres", id);
    Request.addProperty("type", type);

    SoapSerializationEnvelope envelope = new SoapSerializationEnvelope(SoapEnvelope.VER11);
    envelope.setOutputSoapObject(Request);
    envelope.dotNet = true;

    HttpTransportSE androidHttpTransport = new HttpTransportSE(URL);
    androidHttpTransport.debug = true; 
    try
    {
        androidHttpTransport.call(SOAP_ACTION_GETDOCUMENTS, envelope);
        SoapObject response = (SoapObject)envelope.getResponse();
        return response;        
    }
    catch(XmlPullParserException exPull)
    {
        exPull.printStackTrace();
        return null;
    }
    catch(IOException exIO)
    {
        exIO.printStackTrace();
        return null;
    }
}
 And next up is the error we receive     09-13 14:14:31.078: W/System.err(875): org.xmlpull.v1.XmlPullParserException: PI must not start with xml (position:unknown --=_1e3686ff8230e83d586a024e6feaaf4d

@CONTENT:On my website i'm using virtual host so my users can have virtual domain like 'user1.mydomain.com', 'user2.mydomain.com',... The problem is that on virtual domains like 'user1.domain.com' the index page is always the same as on my index page 'http://mydomain.com'. What i want to do is to have two different index pages for the domain and for subdomains. My question, how to have subdomains redirected to 'index2.php' (for example) and still have the subdomains to look like 'user1.mydomain.com'?

@TITLE:White-space: nowrap vs white-space: normal why is the effect on floating elements so big?
@CONTENT:Definition from w3c : normal Sequences of whitespace will collapse into a single whitespace. Text will wrap when necessary. This is default Play it ? nowrap Sequences of whitespace will collapse into a single whitespace. Text will never wrap to the next line. The text continues on the same line until a tag is encountered. So why does it make so much difference in the looks of floated elements? e.g. compare this: JsBin with white-space normal showing a nicely aligned layout <table>

@LINK:/questions/12407209/configuring-mod-proxy-for-apache-to-reject-wrong-domain-requests
@TITLE:Configuring mod_proxy for Apache to reject wrong domain requests
@CONTENT:Recently, I noticed my website was running slower and slower. I discovered 8GB Apache logs on my server (I run a Play!Framework web application on a Debian 6 server) and a bandwidth completely overloaded. Which was completely insane for a small personal website with a few views per day. After investigating and gathering some information, I discovered my mistake : on my Apache configuration, I had uncommented the line "ProxyRequests On", so my server was freely used as a free proxy for everybody in the world. What a shame. At least in that time, I adjusted my firewall to limit concurrent connections, and installed mod_qos for Apache2. But still, now instead of redirecting requests to their destination like a good free proxy, all incoming requests are redirected to my web application, whatever the domain is. For example if someone uses my server thinking it is still a working proxy to search for "young naked children" on yahoo, he will fall on my website. I think now you see my point. Then, what should I do so that if a request for "http://yahoo.com/whatever" is sent to my server, the request is simply denied ? Here is my current configuration : in /etc/init.d/apache2/sites-available/mysite.fr : ProxyRequests Off
NameVirtualHost *:80

     ServerName mysite.fr
     ServerAlias *.mysite.fr

@LINK:/questions/12407173/storing-meta-information-to-class-properties
@TITLE:Storing meta information to class properties
@CONTENT:I've been agaonizing about this problem for some days: I have a class Info public class Info
  {
    private int _no;

    public int No
    {
      get
      {
        return _no;
      }
      set
      {
        _no = value;
      }
    }
  }
 That class can be used anywhere in any classes (inherited or as property). The property can be considered as security relevant or not. That information is known at design time and needs to be stored for that particular property. So for some classes which uses that class as property I want the member "No" to be set accordingly.   public class IsRelevant
  {
    private Info _prop = new Info();
    public Info Prop { get { return _prop; } set { _prop = value; } }
  }

  public class IsNotRelevant
  {
    private Info _prop = new Info();
    public Info Prop { get { return _prop; } set { _prop = value; } }
  }
 For a first try I was thinking about introducing an custom attribute like this: [SecurityRelevant(RelevantLevel = SecurityRelevant.SecurityRelevant_Level1, IsRelevant = true)]
 And then once I instanciate the class "IsRelevant", I will go through the properties and its classes and set the custom attribute as desired: IsRelevant.Prop.No => IsRelevant = true, eg IsNotRelevant.Prop.No => IsRelevant=false. But as far as I understood the meta information (attributes) for a class is an instance created once for each type. So if I change the values of the custom attribute I will change it for all instances of that class (because it's bound to that type!?) Edit: This can't be done as stated here: Change Attribute's parameter at runtime Everytime you access the custom attributes, a new instance with the default values will be created. Changes to that attribute won't be stored there. A second approach was to store that information in an external class and save all the model paths etc. I don't like that because the information belongs to a specific class. The third approach was to implement an interface which holds a dictionary which stores that information:   public interface ISecRelevant
  {
    Dictionary<PropertyInfo, bool> SecInfo { get; set; }
  }
 and then every class which has a security relevant property would need to implement it. On every instantiation of that class, the information needs to be added in the dicationary. This is the best solution I came up with yet. The class which holds the information doesn't necessarily needs to be a dictionary because in a second step I want to ask an instance with a potential security relevant property if it really is relevant. So I could just pass that property in a method of that "security relevant information container" and ask if the property is relevant. So I'm basically asking if someone has a better idea to store that information or to access it, because somehow I still don't like the solution. So here are some general conclusions about that problem: The information whether a property is security relevant is not really a runtime information, but available upfront. So ideally I would like to store it in a "static" way The information is best to be attached to the property, at least to the parent class, because only it should know about that information, not any other class which uses that Info class to avoid coupling There are many more security relevant properties which are scatterd over a lot more classes. These are also used in a more deeper and complex object hierarchy, but I thought it basically comes down to the problem I described here. Edit: Since I did not come up with a better idea, I implemented the third solution, but with a string for the property name. But then I stumbled into another problem when using Lists. What happens if you have a List as property with a type that has a sec-relevant property? The List would have to know where it is sitting to enable adding the information to every instance which is inserted in the List... While searching I found another post, basicallay asks for the same thing: C# - add some meta data associated to a particular field when I am assigning a value to the field of a class? He suggests to implement a base class which hold that kind of information. This will work for "normal" properties. But not for the list-case. Further explanation and example: I thought the example with "security relevant" was helping you guys to understand the problem, but maybe it just confused you. Simply said: I need to attach meta information a any property of a class (and also to the items which are maybe contained in a list). Where I need to put this information is known at design-time but is dependent on the instanciation of the classes. So it DOES matter who is instanciating the class. This is also the reason why I cant use static information. Here is an example: Class A {
  public int MetaProperty; // (this it the propert where i might want to add meta info)
}

Class B {
  public A ThePropertyWithMetadata;
}

Class C{
  public A TheProperty;
}
 Whenever I create an instance of class B, I need to attach meta information to InstanceOfB.ThePropertyWithMetadata.MetaProperty On the other hand whenever I create an instance of class C, I DO NOT want to to attach any meta information to that property. I want to show that meta info in the user interface and give the user more information about that property. So I do know when to assign the meta information, but cant put it in the classes at design time. Hope this clarifies it now :-)
@CODE:public class Info
  {
    private int _no;

    public int No
    {
      get
      {
        return _no;
      }
      set
      {
        _no = value;
      }
    }
  } public class IsRelevant
  {
    private Info _prop = new Info();
    public Info Prop { get { return _prop; } set { _prop = value; } }
  }

  public class IsNotRelevant
  {
    private Info _prop = new Info();
    public Info Prop { get { return _prop; } set { _prop = value; } }
  } [SecurityRelevant(RelevantLevel = SecurityRelevant.SecurityRelevant_Level1, IsRelevant = true)] public interface ISecRelevant
  {
    Dictionary<PropertyInfo, bool> SecInfo { get; set; }
  } Class A {
  public int MetaProperty; // (this it the propert where i might want to add meta info)
}

Class B {
  public A ThePropertyWithMetadata;
}

@CONTENT:Possible Duplicate: org.apache.jasper.el.ELContextImpl cannot be cast to org.apache.jasper.runtime.ELContextImpl I export a web service project (contains jsp pages) from Eclipse in a war file and deploy it in Jetty 8.1.5. It works fine on my machine. But after deploying the same war file on Jetty 8.1.3 on another machine (windows server 2003) it gives HTTP Error 500 and the following exception when I go to the index.jsp page: org.apache.jasper.el.ELContextImpl cannot be cast to org.apache.jasper.runtime.ELContextImpl the full trace and more details in this question which I posted two days ago. while all the jars that I have in WEB_INF/lib are provided in these two screenshots: two days of looking around the internet for a solution resulted in knowing that the problem is caused by conflicts between the jars shipped in the war file and other jars (I guess the jetty jars). The question is: how can I find out which jar is causing the problem? I tried browsing the contents of these jars looking for the class ElContextImpl but did not find anything ? Any thoughts? EDIT: I tried copying my local whole Jetty 8.1.5 into the server and statrted jetty from there.. but still no success.

@TITLE:Detect what is selected (highlighted) or clicked within an element on a page?
@CONTENT:How would one go about detecting what has been selected on a page in a browser? Example: Click, hold, select 3 words and 1 image on a page, release. Sub-question: How to detect what letter someone clicked on? Without using: A span injector breaking everything up OR a WYSIWYG plugin I'm hoping this isn't just a type of browser interaction you can't detect. There could be many uses, but my goal is a simple 'live' page editor, or at least a way to know what someone is clicking on/selecting aside from just the id of an element.

@TITLE:Python: can isinstance(i, type(i)) evaluate to False?
@CONTENT:I am looking for something in the following piece of code so that the isinstance() check afterwards evaluates to True in any case: i = WonderfulClass()
classinfo_of_i = something(i)
isinstance(i, classinfo_of_i) # must evaluate to True
 If type is your answer, I'd be grateful if you explained why. Is type the real counterpart of isinstance? Or, asked the other way round, can you think of a case where isinstance(i, type(i)) evaluates to False? This question arose in the context of the simple way to check if the elements of a list or set are single type?, where we have to go through a sequence and check if all the sequence elements are of the same kind. In this context, elements will be compared to each other. This comparison could be based on type or based on isinstance. Relevant documentation regarding isinstance(object, classinfo): Return true if the object argument is an instance of the classinfo argument
@CODE:something isinstance() True i = WonderfulClass()
classinfo_of_i = something(i)
isinstance(i, classinfo_of_i) # must evaluate to True type type isinstance isinstance(i, type(i)) type isinstance isinstance(object, classinfo) type type isinstance isinstance(i, type(i)) isinstance... True type WonderfulClass() type()

@TITLE:Font-face does not work on firefox. Works well on others
@CONTENT:I have a project that's been using font-face without problem for some time. Today I checked and font face is not working on firefox v14 and v15 provably also not working on v12+ as is the case in this thread: http://css-tricks.com/forums/discussion/17337/font-face-problem-with-firefox-v-12/p1 My problem is exactly the same as in the previous thread. To summarize. I'm using font face to load web fonts like this: @font-face {
    font-family: 'TradeGothicLTStdCnBold';
    src: url('/jovenestalentos/fonts/tradegothicltstd-bdcn20-webfont.eot');
    src: url('/jovenestalentos/fonts/tradegothicltstd-bdcn20-webfont.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'),
         url('/jovenestalentos/fonts/tradegothicltstd-bdcn20-webfont.woff') format('woff'),
         url('/jovenestalentos/fonts/tradegothicltstd-bdcn20-webfont.ttf') format('truetype'),
         url('/jovenestalentos/fonts/tradegothicltstd-bdcn20-webfont.svg#TradeGothicLTStdCnBold') format('svg');
    font-weight: normal;
    font-style: normal;
 and then #bea .bea {
    font-family: 'TradeGothicLTStdCnBold';
    font-size: 14px;
}
 The fonts are loading correctly according to firebug. It works on safari, chrome, IE and some firefoxs. I've tried 6 firefoxs (v13-15) and it worked in some of them and not on others. I haven't been able to establish any reason why. I've also looked for the firefox configuration value gfx.font_rendering.cleartype.always_use_for_content; And i've noticed is set to false in all the firefoxs I tested, even the ones that work correctly. Live example: http://comoquierascolacao.com/jovenestalentos/ How it should look: http://postimage.org/image/n2r9fxdsv/ To summarize: - The routes work. - The routes are in the same domain, no cross-domain issues. - It does work in some firefoxs and it doesn't in others (no reason that i can figure out). - It did work in my own firefox before, maybe prior to v12. Thank you all, any help will be greatly appreciated because this is driving me nuts.

@TITLE:protobuf-net concurrent performance issue in TakeLock
@CONTENT:We're using protobuf-net for sending log messages between services. When profiling stress testing, under high concurrency, we see very high CPU usage and that TakeLock in RuntimeTypeModel is the culprit. The hot call stack looks something like: *Our code...*

 I see that we can use the new precompiler to get a speed boost, but I'm wondering if that will get rid of the issue (sounds like it doesn't use reflection); it would be a bit of work for me to integrate this, so I haven't tested it yet. I also see the option to call Serializer.PrepareSerializer. My initial (small scale) testing didn't make the prepare seem promising. A little more info about the type we're serializing: [ProtoContract]
public class SomeMessage
{
    [ProtoMember(1)]
    public SomeEnumType SomeEnum { get; set; }

    [ProtoMember(2)]
    public long SomeId{ get; set; }

    [ProtoMember(3)]
    public string SomeString{ get; set; }

    [ProtoMember(4)]
    public DateTime SomeDate { get; set; }

    [ProtoMember(5, DynamicType = true, OverwriteList = true)]
    public Collection<object> SomeArguments
}
 Thanks for your help! UPDATE 9/17 Thanks for your response! We're going to try the workaround you suggest and see if that fixes things. This code lives in our logging system so, in the SomeMessage example, SomeString is really a format string (e.g. "Hello {0}") and the SomeArguments collection is a list of objects used to fill in the format string, just like String.Format. Before we serialize, we look at each argument and call DynamicSerializer.IsKnownType(argument.GetType()), if it isn't known, we convert it to a string first. I haven't looked at the ratios of data, but I'm pretty sure we have a lot of different strings coming in as arguments. Let me know if this helps. If you need, I'll try to get more details.

 Rules: For every element in a defined nodeset (in this case <ScreenSize> | <ConfigurationHotSpots>), do the following: process all leaf descendants (i.e., those without children) such that a new element is created; the name of this new element should be the concatenation of all elements between the current node and the childless descendant. There is a variable number of these "blocks" throughout the document, so no manual templates (i.e., one that processes only descendants of <ScreenSize>, one that processes only descendants of <ConfigurationHotSpots>, etc.) What I Currently Have: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

Dim Cell As Range
Dim ResultRange As Range

For Each Cell In Rng
    If Abs(Cell.Value) >= Limit Then
        If ResultRange Is Nothing Then
            Set ResultRange = Cell
        Else
            Set ResultRange = Union(ResultRange, Cell)
        End If
    End If    
Next
Set FilterGreaterThan = ResultRange
End Function
 The issue is that once a number is below the threshold, other numbers after that one that are above the threshold do not get added to the range. For example: Threshold - 2

Numbers -

3
4
1
5
 It will loop through adding 3 and 4 but 5 will not be added. I end up getting a #value error. But I get no error and it works fine if I only enter the range - 3, 4 or the range - 3, 4, 1.

@TITLE:Hierarchical Clustering Large Sparse Distance Matrix R
@CONTENT:I am attempting to perform fastclust on a very large set of distances, but running into a problem. I have a very large csv file (about 91 million rows so a for loop takes too long in R) of similarities between keywords (about 50,000 unique keywords) that when I read into a data.frame looks like: > df   
kwd1 kwd2 similarity  
a  b  1  
b  a  1  
c  a  2  
a  c  2 
 It is a sparse list and I can convert it into a sparse matrix using sparseMatrix(): > myMatrix 
  a b c  
a . . .
b 1 . .
c 2 . .
 However, when I attempt to turn it into a dist object using as.dist(), I get the error that the 'problem is too large' from R. I have read the other dist questions on here, but the code others have suggested does not work for my above example data set. Thanks for any help!

@TITLE:node.js + socket.io - duplicate websocket writes?
@CONTENT:I'm new to the node.js and socket.io scene, so this may be a simple fix... but here goes. I have the following POC for taking in messages via UDP and echoing them back to a browser. UDP messages are received on 55555, a websocket write is performed, and the client sees the data in their browser. However, the moment another client connects to the server, four websocket writes are performed when a datagram is received - two to each client I believe, as the appended data now shows up twice. Firing up a third client shows six websocket writes - appended data appears three times now. Any ideas what is causing this? Dumb error? Misinterpretation? Bug? server: var dgram = require("dgram");
var udpserver = dgram.createSocket("udp4");
udpserver.bind(55555);  //udp listener

var express = require("express");
var app = express();
var http = require('http');
var server = http.createServer(app);
var io = require('socket.io').listen(server);

@CONTENT:I want to check within my Java application whether the windows virtual keyboard is already running or not. I searched for it and found, that I can use wmic.exe to search for a process. This is what I'm doing: Process proc = Runtime.getRuntime().exec("wmic.exe");

OutputStreamWriter oStream = new OutputStreamWriter(proc

        return;
    }
}

 This is working, but wmic is somehow creating the file TempWmicBatchFile.bat with the line process where name='osk.exe' get caption. How can I prevent this from happening?

"482.sphinx3")), Class = structure(c(3L, 1L, 2L, 3L, 1L, 4L,

"PF", "PI", "PU")), Config = structure(c(1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 
1L, 1L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 
4L, 4L, 4L, 4L, 4L, 4L, 4L, 5L, 5L, 5L, 5L, 5L, 5L, 5L), .Label = c("Disabled", 
"Shallowest", "Deepest", "StorePref", "StridedPref"), class = "factor"), 
    Perf = c(1, 0.72, 0.8, 1, 0.32, 1.16, 0.79, 1, 0.98, 1, 1, 
    0.72, 1, 0.99, 1, 0.98, 1, 1, 1.12, 0.97, 1, 1, 0.97, 1, 
    1, 0.99, 0.97, 1, 1, 1.18, 1, 1, 0.99, 0.97, 1)), .Names = c("Benchmark", 
"Class", "Config", "Perf"), row.names = c(NA, -35L), class = "data.frame")
 First I attempted using barchart like this: barchart(Perf ~ Benchmark | Class, dm, groups=Config,
         scales=list(x=list(relation='free')), auto.key=list(columns=3))
 That gave me the following plot: As you can see, there is a gap between the benchmarks for PI, PF and CS classes. The reason is that each factor is only present in a given class, thus it is missing in all the others, and barchart might introduce a gap in the x axis. My second attempt was to call barchart four times (one for each class): class.subset <- function(dframe, class.name) {
    return(dframe[dframe$Class == class.name, ])
}

pl1 <- barchart(Perf ~ Benchmark, class.subset(dm, 'PI'), groups=Config)
pl2 <- barchart(Perf ~ Benchmark, class.subset(dm, 'PF'),, groups=Config)
pl3 <- barchart(Perf ~ Benchmark, class.subset(dm, 'CS'),, groups=Config)
pl4 <- barchart(Perf ~ Benchmark, class.subset(dm, 'PU'),, groups=Config)

print(pl1, split=c(1, 1, 2, 2), more = TRUE)
print(pl2, split=c(1, 2, 2, 2), more = TRUE)
print(pl3, split=c(2, 1, 2, 2), more = TRUE)
print(pl4, split=c(2, 2, 2, 2))
 The plot that I got is pretty much what I want, but now I do not know how to create a single global legend for all the subplots (instead of the very same legend for each subplot): Ideally, I would prefer to solve the problem that I am facing using the first approach (since in that way I would also have the class name in each of the panels). However, if in the second case, it is possible to add a global legend and a title for each subplot containing the class name, that would be okay too.

@TITLE:Remove (absolute) paths in ANTLR generated java classes:
@CONTENT:I am using ANTLRWorks 1.4.3 together with ANTLR 3.4 to generate a Java-based parser and lexer from a grammar file. The generated .java-files contain strings like C:\\Users\\[path to the eclipse project]\\src\\some\\package\\name\\MyGrammar.g
 This absolute path is used as return string e.g. in method getGrammarFileName() of lexer and parser, and throughout the both files various times as comment. I see following disadvantages: If somebody else with different paths in his development environment will regenerate these files, a lot of changes will be introduced even if no changes in the grammar file were done. Nobody, especially in an open source project, needs to know where I exactly store my grammar files. E.g., what about C:\\Users\\simon\\customerA\\crap_software\\[rest of the path to grammar file] Is there a way to control this in ANTLRWorks or ANTLR s.th. at least only relative paths are used?

@CONTENT:Heys guys! Im have been study UML and im trying to to design the use case diagram of a problem. Lets supose my app consists in this: Two Requesites: - create teams - create players This is the deal: A user can create a team, and after create a team he can create players for that team(not required). But in this app there are multiple users, and a user can create a team and other user can create players. The only constraint is that to create players must exist alreay a team. I research and i end up a little confuse. If i get the concepts of relations on use case diagrams right, i think i should have the folowwing two use cases: [use case - create team] <-------extends---- [use case - create player] I need opinions,Is this the proper solution? or should i have two not related use cases? Thanks in advance, and im sorry my english.

@TITLE:Hibernate web application with MySQL failover
@CONTENT:I developed a Java web application, using Hibernate 3.3.2 as persistence framework and Apache Tomcat 7.0.27 as server. This application was successfully set up to use MySQL 5.5 Replication Servers: 1 master, 1 slave. Read-only queries go on the latter and the others on the master instance. And here comes the problem: I would like to test DB failover, i.e. at some time stop the slave MySQL instance and see the application still work well with read-only queries. As far as I understood from the following article MySQL Failover with Connector/J, this should be possible with no changes to the code. To start I am interested in the 2nd case: A communication exception (SQL State starting with "08"). Unfortunately this does not happen, if I stop the slave, sometimes it takes a very long time to get a response from the server, sometimes none comes back and the HTTP connection becomes stuck. In the Tomcat log just get the following line: The last packet successfully received from the server was N milliseconds ago. The last packet sent successfully to the server was 0 milliseconds ago. Here is a snippet of hibernate configuration: <property name="hibernate.connection.driver_class">com.mysql.jdbc.ReplicationDriver</property>
<property name="hibernate.connection.url">jdbc:mysql://masterIP,slaveIP/mydb?loadBalancePingTimeout=1500&amp;loadBalanceBlacklistTimeout=7000&amp;autoReconnect=true&amp;failOverReadOnly=false&amp;roundRobinLoadBalance=true</property>
 While looking at the MySQL connector documentation, I've tried many properties configurations, but cannot figure out how to obtain a reliable failover.

@TITLE:CakePHP redirect method not redirecting
@CONTENT:I am trying to redirect to a new page using CakePHP redirect method but for some reason the redirect is not working. The code I am using to redirect is public function update_sticky_postition_in_db()
{   
     $this->autoRender = false;

     ... // Save info to database

     $this->redirect(array('action' => 'tool'));
}
 Where tool is the name of the view I am tring to redirect to. To try and speed the process of finding the problem I have checked few things and think I have found the cause of the problem. Basically I am trying to redirect to the view that is currently active which I think is part of the reason why it is not redirecting. I have read that it might have something to do with caching of the page but I am not sure how to solve that issue. Also when using firebug I can see the redirect is sending a GET request but after that nothing is happening. Do I have to do something with the GET request or should Cake handle that for me. Also I have checked the URL of the GET and it is correct. It is located within the controller with the correct name as I can view the original tool page. Also the update_sticky_postition_in_db() method does not have a view (hence why the auto render is set to false), its intended purpose is to update a row in the database from an ajax call.

@CONTENT:I need some help is some unique solution. I have a text file in which I have to replace some value based on some position. This is not a big file and will always contain 5 lines with fixed number of length in all the lines at any given time. But I have to specficaly replace soem text in some position only. Further, i can also put in some text in required position and replace that text with required value every time. I am not sure how to implement this solution. I have given the example below. Line 1 - 00000 This Is Me 12345 trying
Line 2 - 23456 This is line 2 987654
Line 3 - This is 345678 line 3 67890
 Consider the above is the file I have to use to replace some values. Like in line 1, I have to replace '00000' with '11111' and in line 2, I have to replace 'This' with 'Line' or any require four digit text. The position will always remain the same in text file. I have a solution which works but this is for reading the file based on position and not for writing. Can someone please give a solution similarly for wrtiting aswell based on position Solution for reading the file based on position : def read_var file, line_nr, vbegin, vend

 I have also tried this solution for writing. This works but I need it to work based on position or based on text present in the specific line. Explored solution to wirte to file : open(Dir.pwd + '/Files/Try.txt', 'w') { |f|
  f << "Four score\n"
  f << "and seven\n"
  f << "years ago\n"

@TITLE:Should one use redis to generate auto incrementing values?
@CONTENT:I am designing an application that uses MongoDB for storage. As you probably know the ObjectId datatype that mongo provides is a 12 byte hexadecimal. I would like to show my users a more user friendly id instead. I looked into several options like PHP's uniqid() and several variations thereof but I don't trust them because of the collisions the randomness entails (see Birthday Problem). Redis looks really attractive to me for this kind of operation (see INCR). This requires the web application to call redis every time it needs to create new record. I will only need about 15-20 counters inside redis which will have a tiny footprint so replication will never become an issue. Also the app can connect to it using a socket to avoid the tcp overhead. Am I thinking about it the wrong way? Is there something else I should consider? Thanks, Alex

@TITLE:Importing google app engine project from eclipse into intellij
@CONTENT:I'm trying out intellij to see what it is like to develop/maintain google app engine projects. I've used the GAE plugin for eclipse for a couple of years and it usually worked flawlessly for me but I've heard a lot about intellij recently so I wanted to see what I was missing. I've read many sites that describe step-by-step how to create new GAE projects in intellij but none that describe how to do so for existing projects. I'm struggling with I imagine is some intellij 101 topics. I have a few questions that I'm bundling together here: I added the Web/GAE facet to the project and specified the appropriate GAE SDK directory and appengine account info. What's the right way to associate the right SDK jars with my project? IntelliJ recognized my maven imports and added them to my External Libraries, things like apache commons, slf4j, etc. How do these jars make their way into the (exploded war) artifact I created for the project? Are they automatically copied there after a successful compile? I'm using JDO so I downloaded the DataNucleus plugin. How do I wire it up so it enhances my classes? Thanks in advance.

@TITLE:Deserializing an object that contains JSON using GSON
@CONTENT:I'm using gson to deserialize POJO objects from JSON representations. I'd like one of the fields in one of my POJOs to contain arbitrary JSON data. For example: class B {
    public String stringField;
    public JsonObject jsonField;
}
 I'd like to be able to call Gson.fromJson(json, B.class) on the following JSON: {
    "stringField": "booger",
    "jsonField" :
    {
        "arbitraryField1": "foo"
    }
}
 and have the resulting B.jsonField contain a JsonObject with an arbitraryField of value foo. However, when I attempt to do this, jsonField is always an empty object ({}). In fact, more generally, it appears that the following always returns an empty object: new Gson().fromJson("{ foo: 1 }", JsonObject.class)
 I would expect the above to return an object containing a field named foo of value 1. How can I have gson preserve arbitrary json data when deserializing json to POJOS?
@CODE:class B {
    public String stringField;
    public JsonObject jsonField;
} Gson.fromJson(json, B.class) {
    "stringField": "booger",
    "jsonField" :

I have absolutely no idea how to start implementing the API. The other stuff surrounding API's have been helpful, but I literally am stuck on what the very first step should be to begin implementing the API. I need for a user to be able to sign up and authenticate, then supply data that will be tracked through the external API. I've got the user sign up and authenticate stuff down pat, just need to know what the very first baby step to using this API should be. The logic behind the answer would be equally helpful.

@LINK:/questions/12379525/what-kind-of-member-access-do-friend-and-static-member-functions-have
@TITLE:What kind of member access do friend and static member functions have?
@CONTENT:I'm wondering what kind of class member access friend functions and static member functions have for class objects. Specifically, what the differences are and why to use one over the other. It's my understanding that functions declared as friend of a class or as static members both have access to private members of any instance of that class. I'll give a quick example to show why they seem so similar to me. Both functions operator< and MyClass::lessThan seem to have the same access privileges and can do the exact same thing. class MyClass {
    friend bool operator<(const MyClass &left, const MyClass &right);
public:
    MyClass(int pub, int priv) : m_pub(pub), m_priv(priv) {}
    static bool lessThan(const MyClass &left, const MyClass &right);
    int m_pub;
private:
    int m_priv;
};

bool operator<(const MyClass &left, const MyClass &right) {
    return ( (left.m_pub < right.m_pub) && (left.m_priv < right.m_priv) );
}

bool MyClass::lessThan(const MyClass &left, const MyClass &right) {
    return ( (left.m_pub < right.m_pub) && (left.m_priv < right.m_priv) );
}

int main(int argc, const char* argv[]) {
    MyClass a(1, 2),
        b(3, 4),
        c(-1, 1);
    cout << "a < b        = " << (a<b) << endl;
    cout << "a lessThan b = " << MyClass::lessThan(a,b) << endl;
    cout << "a < c        = " << (a<c) << endl;
    cout << "a lessThan c = " << MyClass::lessThan(a,c) << endl;
}
 Clearly this is a simplified example, but I suppose my question is two-part: What are the differences between friend and static functions in regards to member access? What kinds of things should come into consideration when deciding which to use?
@CODE:friend static friend static operator< MyClass::lessThan class MyClass {
    friend bool operator<(const MyClass &left, const MyClass &right);
public:
    MyClass(int pub, int priv) : m_pub(pub), m_priv(priv) {}
    static bool lessThan(const MyClass &left, const MyClass &right);
    int m_pub;
private:
    int m_priv;
};

bool operator<(const MyClass &left, const MyClass &right) {
    return ( (left.m_pub < right.m_pub) && (left.m_priv < right.m_priv) );
}

bool MyClass::lessThan(const MyClass &left, const MyClass &right) {
    return ( (left.m_pub < right.m_pub) && (left.m_priv < right.m_priv) );
}

int main(int argc, const char* argv[]) {
    MyClass a(1, 2),
        b(3, 4),
        c(-1, 1);
    cout << "a < b        = " << (a<b) << endl;
    cout << "a lessThan b = " << MyClass::lessThan(a,b) << endl;
    cout << "a < c        = " << (a<c) << endl;

It works pretty well except that it has two problems: The mouse cursor is missing from the images and I know it will be because BufferedImages do not contain cursor information in them. They have to be added programatically. The thread that takes screenshots is a daemon thread. So if I close the application, the thread is killed and the PNG image that was being written gets corrupted. I want to avoid that. Here are the images of my application: The award-winning, intuitive GUI: The high-definition images captured look like this: As you can see from the image the cursor information is being displayed in the console using MouseInfo's static methods.

 I think the root of the problem is bind() or transform() but I don't know what exactly is wrong with the code (as it compiles fine without a single warning with g++). Anyone knows how to fix my code without resorting to prepocessor magics?
@CODE:#define #ifdef #include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <array>
#include <algorithm>
#include <functional>
#include <cmath>
#include <iterator>

typedef unsigned char UINT8;
const UINT8 MAX_COLL = 10;

template< typename BaseT, typename ExpT >
struct fopow {
    BaseT operator() ( BaseT base, ExpT exp ) const {
        return std::pow( base, exp );
    }
};

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    using namespace std::placeholders;

    array<int, MAX_COLL> intCollection_init = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 };
    vector<int> intCollection( intCollection_init.begin(), intCollection_init.end() );

    transform( intCollection.begin(), intCollection.end(),
               ostream_iterator<int>( cout, " " ),
               bind( fopow<int, int>(), 3, _1 )
            );
    cout << endl;

    transform( intCollection.begin(), intCollection.end(),
               ostream_iterator<int>( cout, " " ),
               bind( fopow<int, int>(), _1, 3 )
            );
    cout << endl;

@TITLE:Setting default interpreter for a python script
@CONTENT:I am using a module that can only be found in python 2.7, so when I run my script I have to specify python2.7 script instead of just script. I know there are bigger issues out there, but still I was wondering - is it possible, when writing a python script, to set the interpreter to 2.7 by default? Maybe by setting #! /usr/bin/env python for example?

@TITLE:Java applet JTextField inaccesible after JDialog on Ubuntu
@CONTENT:I have 2 problems with java on Ubuntu: JTextField gets inaccessible and you cant type anything in it. To reproduce you have to click on label ('Click this label') it will open my extended JDialog. After closing it with Cancel button JTextField gets inaccessible. The problem is that it doesen't happen all the time. I think around 1 on 10 tries. When it happens you have to click somewhere else on browser window or open dialog one more time. Second problem is that when ubuntu opens JDialog it creates other process which is shown on left side app bar. You can than click somewhere on the applet under the dialog and this dialog will go under the browser even thought it is modal and should be on top. Did anyone get similar errors with ubuntu and know how to fix it. On windows everything works fine. We use ubuntu-12.04-desktop and java 1.6.0_34-b04. It was tested in firefox 11.0 and Google chrome (newest I think) Here is my code TestApplet.java class:     import java.awt.FlowLayout;

@LINK:/questions/12373041/sorting-an-array-of-files-for-rename
@TITLE:Sorting an array of files for rename
@CONTENT:I've recently written a small program to rename a bunch of files located in 6 directories. The program loops through each directory from a list and then renames each file in that directory using the File.Move method. The files are renamed to cart_buttons_1.png with the 1 incrementing by 1 each time. public static int RenameFiles(DirectoryInfo d, StreamWriter sqlStreamWriter, 
                                       int incrementer, int category, int size)
{
    FileInfo[] files = d.GetFiles("*.png");

    foreach (FileInfo fileInfo in files)
    {
        File.Move(fileInfo.FullName, d.FullName + "cart_button_" + incrementer + ".png" );
        incrementer++;
    }

    return incrementer;
}
 The problem I'm encountering is when I run the program more than once it runs fine up until it hits the folder containing the 100th record. The d.Getfiles method retrieves all the files with the 100s first, causing and IOException, because the file which it is trying to rename already exists in the folder. The workaround I've found for this is just to select all the records with 100 in the filename and renaming them all to 'z' or something so that it just batches them all together. Any thoughts or ideas on how to fix this. Possibly some way to sort the GetFiles to look at the others first.
@CODE:public static int RenameFiles(DirectoryInfo d, StreamWriter sqlStreamWriter, 
                                       int incrementer, int category, int size)
{
    FileInfo[] files = d.GetFiles("*.png");

    foreach (FileInfo fileInfo in files)
    {
        File.Move(fileInfo.FullName, d.FullName + "cart_button_" + incrementer + ".png" );

@TITLE:jQuery Datepicker beforeShowDay
@CONTENT:I'm using jQuery's datepicker beforeShowDay event, where I check the dates if they has to be enabled in the calendar. First I got the dates to check on a page load with PHP, but now I want to get those dates with an ajax request (I'm using Wordpress), but i can't figure that out. Here's my code: $(function() {  
    var enabledDays = [];        

    function openedDays() {
        var data = {
            action: 'get_dates',
            zaal: <?php echo $zaal_id; ?>,
            async: false,
            dataType: 'json'
        };

        $.getJSON(ajaxurl, data, function(response) {
            $.each(response, function(key, value) {
                enabledDays.push(value);  
            });
            //works, console.log(enabledDays) shows here an array of dates: ["9-8-2012","9-10-2012"] 

            //add option beforeShowDay to datepicker? (does't work yet)
            $(this).datepicker('option','beforeShowDay',enableAllTheseDays); 

        });

    }


    function enableAllTheseDays(date) {
        //how to get value of the enabledDays variable in here

        var m = date.getMonth(), d = date.getDate(), y = date.getFullYear();

        for (i = 0; i < enabledDays.length; i++) {
            if($.inArray((m+1) + '-' + d + '-' + y,enabledDays) != -1) {
                //return true(enable date in Current Days Open calendar) if date is in array, add class 'ui-datepicker-opened-day' and tooltip 'opened' to it.
                return [true,'ui-datepicker-opened-day','opened'];
            }
        }            

        //return false(disable date in Current Days Open calendar) if date isn't in both of the arrays, and add tooltip 'closed' to it.    
        return [false,'ui-datepicker-closed-day','closed'];

    }


    //show Current Days Open Calendar
        $( "#currentdays" ).datepicker({
            dateFormat: "dd-MM-yy",
            changeMonth: true,
            numberOfMonths: 1,
            minDate: 0,
            beforeShow: openedDays
        });  

});
 I need to find a way to get the dates from the openedDays function, before executing the enableAllTheseDays function, so I can use the enabledDays variable in the enableAllTheseDays function.
@CODE:$(function() {  
    var enabledDays = [];        

    function openedDays() {
        var data = {
            action: 'get_dates',
            zaal: <?php echo $zaal_id; ?>,
            async: false,
            dataType: 'json'
        };

        $.getJSON(ajaxurl, data, function(response) {
            $.each(response, function(key, value) {
                enabledDays.push(value);  
            });
            //works, console.log(enabledDays) shows here an array of dates: ["9-8-2012","9-10-2012"] 

            //add option beforeShowDay to datepicker? (does't work yet)
            $(this).datepicker('option','beforeShowDay',enableAllTheseDays); 

        });

    }


    function enableAllTheseDays(date) {
        //how to get value of the enabledDays variable in here

        var m = date.getMonth(), d = date.getDate(), y = date.getFullYear();

        for (i = 0; i < enabledDays.length; i++) {
            if($.inArray((m+1) + '-' + d + '-' + y,enabledDays) != -1) {
                //return true(enable date in Current Days Open calendar) if date is in array, add class 'ui-datepicker-opened-day' and tooltip 'opened' to it.
                return [true,'ui-datepicker-opened-day','opened'];
            }
        }            

        //return false(disable date in Current Days Open calendar) if date isn't in both of the arrays, and add tooltip 'closed' to it.    
        return [false,'ui-datepicker-closed-day','closed'];

    }


    //show Current Days Open Calendar
        $( "#currentdays" ).datepicker({
            dateFormat: "dd-MM-yy",
            changeMonth: true,
            numberOfMonths: 1,
            minDate: 0,
            beforeShow: openedDays
        });

@TITLE:codeigniter specifying limit to NULL not working in latest CI version 2.1.2
@CONTENT:I have following get_authors_list function in one of my Codeigniter model function get_authors_list($limit,$offset){
    $data = array();

    $this->db->select('*')->from('authors')->limit($limit,$offset)->order_by('id','desc');

    $query = $this->db->get();         
    if ($query-> num_rows() >  0){
      $data = $query->result_array();
    }
    return $data;
    $q->free_result();
  }
 Before upgrading to Codeigniter 2.1.2, I used call this method from my controller as $data['authors'] = $this->author_model->get_authors_list(NULL, 0)
 and it worked as expected but after upgrading to codeigniter version 2.1.2 it doesn't work, to get it working I had to specify limit as follows in my function call $data['authors'] = $this->author_model->get_authors_list(50, 0)
 That's specifying limit to NULL is not working, why? Am I doing anything wrong here? I followed Codeigniter's upgrade instruction correctly but it's some side effect I didn't expect. Any explanation is welcome. Thanks !

@TITLE:Magento redirect from adminthtml page to a frontend action
@CONTENT:Following this post I've finally managed to capture an event by extending the Magento_Adminhtml_Controller_Action and carry out some actions before it. But now I'm trying to improve it so I can capture another event triggered on the admin panel and from there pass an array through the request variable to another event on the frontend. I've these SO questions/answers, here and here but no way I can achieve what I need. I've tested the observer code using die() to be sure that the execution thread goes into the correct call and it is ok. I'm using the CommerceBug from AlanStorm, in case it can be used to get some light on this issue. This is my Observer.php code. <?php

@CONTENT:I am working on a simple android app, my Requirement is, "After some move events(MotionEvent.ACTION_MOVE is true) on the screen, if the user stops moving for few seconds some where with out taking finger from the screen, then need to perform some action." *I learnt that LongPress is something which triggers when user doesn't make any move after the down event is triggered(MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN).* So is there any way to trigger LongPress after Moving around in the screen? Or should I create my own listener for the same functionality?? Any help is appreciated. Thank you.

 When I type "http://localhost/" into the browser the file index.phtml in the "application/views/scripts/index/" directory is rendered ok. If I try to access other views using the controller and action names in a url I get a 404 error saying that the requested URL could not be found on the server. For example I have the controller file TestController.php which is in the same directory as IndexController.php /TestController.php/ <?php

class TestController extends Zend_Controller_Action
{

    public function init()

 I have created a test directory containing a file called index.phtml in "application/views/scripts/"; /views/scripts/test/index.phtml/ <br /><br />
<div id="view-content">
<p>View script for controller <b>Test</b> and script/action name <b>index</b></p>
</div>
 When I try to render this file by typing "http://localhost/test/" I get a 404 error stating that the requested URL could not be found. All of the Zend Framework documentation I have read and countless other resources all state that this method should render correctly. I must be missing something, but after an exhaustive search have been unable to find anyone else having this particular problem. Regards Roan

@TITLE:How to get return value synchronously using ReadTextAsync(StorageFile file) in Windows8 app
@CONTENT:Basiclly, my code is a very simple test for write and read files in a windows 8 style app. Here, a string "Jessie" is firstly written to dataFile.txt, and then it is read by the program so that the Text property of a Textblock in xaml could be updated. From msdn samples, I knew that WriteTextAsync and ReadTextAsync are for dataFile access to file in Windows 8 programming. However, the test result is that WriteTextAsync function actually works whereas ReadTextAsync does not(I can see the real txt file that "Jessie" has been written to dataFile.txt, however the variable str is always null). I have seen similar questions from internet, but none of the answers for them make sense to me. Many answer mentioned the problem might be ReadTextAsync is a async function, such like using Task but all of their solutions doen't work to my code. My question is how can I get the return value synchronously using ReadTextAsync or is there any other method to read data from txt file in Windows8 app so that I can update the UI synchronously? Here is code: public sealed partial class MainPage : Page
{  
    Windows.Storage.StorageFolder localFolder = Windows.Storage.ApplicationData.Current.LocalFolder;

    public MainPage()
    {
        this.InitializeComponent();

        Write();
        Read();
    }

    async void Write()
    {
        StorageFile sampleFile = await localFolder.CreateFileAsync("dataFile.txt", Windows.Storage.
                  CreationCollisionOption.ReplaceExisting);

        await FileIO.WriteTextAsync(sampleFile, "Jessie");
    }

    async void Read()
    {
        try
        {      
            StorageFile sampleFile = await localFolder.GetFileAsync("dataFile.txt");
            string str = await FileIO.ReadTextAsync(sampleFile);

            Text.DataContext = new Test(str, 1);
        }
        catch (FileNotFoundException)
        {

        }
    }

    public class Test
    {
        public Test() { }

        public Test(string name, int age)
        {
            Name = name;
            Age = age;

@TITLE:Accessing a file object outside a try/catch block that creates it (Java)
@CONTENT:I want to create a RandomAccessFile object (in Java) and both write to it and read to it. My problem is that, as far I know I seem to need to create the file within a try/catch block. If I try to create it outside a try/catch block and then initialize it within the block like this, RandomAccessFile valueFile; 

try
{
    valueFile = new RandomAccessFile("valuefile.txt", "rw");
    for (int i=0; i<numOfNums; i++)
        valueFile.writeDouble(randomizer.nextDouble()*200);
}
catch (Exception e)
{
    System.out.println("Couldn't find the values file.");
    System.exit(0);
}

for (int i=0; i<numOfNums; i++)
{
    double total = 0;
    valueFile.seek(0); // go to beginning of file to start reading it.
}
 then I get the error "unreported exception java.io.IOException; must be caught or declared to be thrown". (I also get "variable valueFile might not have been initialized".) But when I do create it within try/catch, like this, try
{
    RandomAccessFile valueFile = new RandomAccessFile("valuefile.txt", "rw");
    for (int i=0; i<numOfNums; i++)
        valueFile.writeDouble(randomizer.nextDouble()*200);
}
catch (Exception e)
{
    System.out.println("Couldn't find the values file.");
    System.exit(0);
}

for (int i=0; i<numOfNums; i++)
{
    double total = 0;
    valueFile.seek(0);
}
 I get "cannot find symbol: variable valueFile" on the later part of the program. I presume that that's because valueFile is considered local to the try/catch block? But then how do I create valueFile so it's not local to the try/catch block?
@CODE:RandomAccessFile valueFile; 

try
{
    valueFile = new RandomAccessFile("valuefile.txt", "rw");

@TITLE:HTML5 video tag not playing in Firefox
@CONTENT:I have a MVC/.NET project and I set the mimetype in my webconfig: <staticContent>
      <mimeMap fileExtension=".mp4" mimeType="video/mp4" />
      <mimeMap fileExtension=".m4v" mimeType="video/m4v" />

 Then I added this video tag to my webpage <video width="640" height="385" controls="controls">

    </video> 
 And I open this webpage in Firefox, but I get the message "no video with supported format and MIME type found". If I open http://localhost/videos/sample_mpeg4.mp4 Firefox opens the download window, so it means the video path is correct. I searched in Stackoverflow and google and this brought me to my current status, but now I am stuck. Can someone help me troubleshooting this issue?

@TITLE:Algorithm guidance with 3n+1 Conjecture
@CONTENT:Okay, I know this is going to sound like homework; but here goes any way. I am trying to solve this problem using C#. The excerpt from the problem description is shown below: Given an input n, it is possible to determine the number of numbers printed (including the 1). For a given n this is called the cycle-length of n. In the example above, the cycle length of 22 is 16. For any two numbers i and j you are to determine the maximum cycle length over all numbers between i and j. Question I understand everything except for one thing, the cycle length. I just don't understand it exactly. I find that the text is ambiguous about the definition of it. I assume, that the cycle length is how many numbers were in the sequence so lets say that the input is 10 the cycle length would be 8. But I am just not exactly sure. No code is required on your part but guidance is all I ask. In addition, I already know how to read from standard input and output. Since the problem is in programming competition format. My implementation of displaying the sequence of numbers giving n as input static void collatz(ref int n)
{    
     if (n % 2 == 0)
     {
          n /= 2;
     }
     else
     {
          n = (3 * n) + 1;
     }
     Console.WriteLine(n);
}

static int GetCycleLength(int n)
{
     if (n > 0)
     {
          int count = 1;
          while (n != 1)
          {
               collatz(ref n);
               count++;
          }
          return count;
     }
     else
     {
          return -1;
     }

I am making an Android app (an "installed application"?) that offers an in-app subscription, and doesn't require the user to log in to an account (a "service account"?). All that I want to do is to check whether or not the user has purchased a subscription.

@LINK:/questions/12359608/chrome-tabs-update-redirects-to-chrome-extension-invalid
@TITLE:chrome.tabs.update() redirects to 'chrome-extension://invalid/'
@CONTENT:I've written a chrome extension that redirects the current tab based on the value of a timer injected as a content script. A background script keeps track of elapsed times across all open tabs by polling each timer every once in a while, and if time spent on a particular site is over a given limit, redirects the active tab to an interstitial page with the option to reset the timer and restore the previous URL. This works, but once the timer has been reset once, chrome.tabs.update() redirects the active tab to chrome-extension://invalid/. I'm not sure why, or even how to diagnose what's going on here. Here's how it's supposed to work, step by step. First, an if block in the background script is triggered when time's up: background.js: if (time_elapsed > time_limit) {
                settings.restore_url = tab.url;
                var timeup_url = chrome.extension.getURL('timeup.html');
                update_icon("off");
                chrome.tabs.update({url: timeup_url});
}
 This saves the current tab's url to a settings object, gets the URL of the static page timeup.html from the extension directory, updates the toolbar icon, and redirects the current tab to timeup.html. timeup.html: <!DOCTYPE html>

        </div>
    </div>

</html>
 This is pretty simple. Two buttons that are hooked up to 'click' event listeners in... timeup.js: document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {
    document.getElementById("close-tabs").addEventListener('click', close_tabs);
    document.getElementById("restart-timer").addEventListener('click', restart_timer);
});

var port = chrome.extension.connect();

function close_tabs () {
    port.postMessage({close_tabs: true});
}

function restart_timer () {
    port.postMessage({restart_timer: true});
} 
 The #restart-timer button calls restart_timer(), which sends a message back to the content script to redirect the tab: background.js: // Listen for connections from content scripts
chrome.extension.onConnect.addListener(function(port) {
    port.onMessage.addListener(function(msg) {
        if (msg.name == "update") {
            update_times(msg.update, port.sender.tab);
        }

        // Messages from timeup page:
        if (msg.close_tabs === true) {
            chrome.tabs.remove(port.sender.tab.id);
        }

        if (msg.restart_timer === true) {
            var reset_hostname = get_location(settings.restore_url).hostname;
            settings.elapsed_times[reset_hostname] = 0;
            chrome.tabs.update({url: settings.restore_url});
        }
    });
});
 This should reset the elapsed time stored in settings and redirect the tab to settings.restore_url. This works correctly the first time through, but once the timer has been reset, seems to redirect to chrome-extension://invalid/. Even after the first reset, the correct value of settings.restore_url is passed to chrome.tabs.update(), so I'm not sure where the redirect is coming from. What's going wrong here? How can I diagnose this sort of error in the future?
@CODE:chrome.tabs.update() chrome-extension://invalid/ if if (time_elapsed > time_limit) {
                settings.restore_url = tab.url;
                var timeup_url = chrome.extension.getURL('timeup.html');
                update_icon("off");

@LINK:/questions/12359334/mvc-model-validation-required-not-working-on-all-fields
@TITLE:mvc model validation required not working on all fields
@CONTENT:I'm working in ASP.NET MVC 4 and I have the problem that my model validation isn't working correctly. For some reason not all my required fields have to be filled in. Here's my model: public class MovieModel
    {
        public int Id { get; set; }
        [Required]
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public DateTime ReleaseDate { get; set; }
        [Required]
        public string Genre { get; set; }
        [Required]
        public decimal Price { get; set; }

        public virtual ICollection<RoleInMovie> RoleInMovie { get; set; }
    }
 Here's the View: @using (Html.BeginForm())
{
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <label>Name:</label></td>
            <td>@Html.EditorFor(m => m.Name)</td>
            <td>@Html.ValidationMessageFor(m => m.Name)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <label>Genre:</label></td>
            <td>@Html.EditorFor(m => m.Genre)</td>
            <td>@Html.ValidationMessageFor(m => m.Genre)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <label>Price:</label></td>
            <td>@Html.EditorFor(m => m.Price)</td>
            <td>@Html.ValidationMessageFor(m => m.Price)</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
}
 And here's my action: [HttpPost]
        public ActionResult Add(MovieModel model)
        {
            if(ModelState.IsValid)
            {
                return RedirectToAction("Index");
            }
            return View();
        }
 Now here's the thing: as soon as I enter only a price, modelstate.isvalid becomes true. When hovering over my model, it sais both name and genre are null. Ofcourse they are required, but the validation doesn't work. Also, the validationmessagefor only works on price. I hope I'm not overlooking something too ridiculous. Thanks for the help!

@TITLE:Column with alternate serials
@CONTENT:I would like to create a table of user_widgets which is primary keyed by a user_id and user_widget_id, where user_widget_id works like a serial, except for that it starts at 1 per each user. Is there a common or practical solution for this? I am using PostgreSQL, but an agnostic solution would be appreciated as well. Example table: user_widgets  |  user_id  |  user_widget_id  |  user_widget_name    |
 +-----------+------------------+----------------------+

 +-----------+------------------+----------------------+
 Edit: I just wanted to include some reasons for this design. 1. Less information disclosure, not just "Security through obscurity" In a system where user's should not be aware of one another, they also should not be aware of eachother's widget_id's. If this were a table of inventory, weird trade secrets, invoices, or something more sensitive, they be able to start have their own uninfluenced set of ID's for those widgets. In addition to the obvious routine security checks, this adds an implicit security layer where the table has to be filtered by both the widget id and the user id. 2. Data Imports Users should be permitted to import their data from some other system without having to trash all of their legacy IDs (if they have integer IDs). 3. Cleanliness Not terribly dissimilar from my first point, but I think that users who create less content than other may be baffled or annoyed by significant jumps in their widget ID's. This of course is more superficial than functional, but could still be valuable. A possible solution One of the answers suggests the application layer handles this. I could store a next_id column on that user's table that gets incremented. Or perhaps even just count the rows per user, and not allow deletion of records (using a deleted/deactivated flag instead). Could this be done with a trigger function, or even a stored procedure rather than in the application layer?

@TITLE:how to use a complex return object from clojurescript in javascript
@CONTENT:I want to write a clojurescript function that returns a complex item like ["foo" "bar"] or (list "foo" "bar") and I want to be able to call this function from javascript and get at the parts of the return value. How can it be done? In my case, the number of items in the vector/list/collection that I'm returning is known beforehand, and the collection should remain ordered. Here's my clojurescript function. I could do something differently here if it made things easier. Just don't know what that would be. (defn myFn [] ["foo" "bar"])
 Here's what it looks like after it has been compiled to javascript. This part is completely determined/generated by the previous bit of code. To make changes here, I'd have to know how to tweak the previous part in clojurescript. my.ns.myFn = function myFn() {
  return cljs.core.PersistentVector.fromArray(["foo", "bar"], true)
};
 When I do the following in javascript, I see an alert box pop up with ["foo" "bar"] alert(my.ns.myFn());
 But if I try the following, the alert shows "undefined" instead of "foo". var tmp = my.ns.myFn();
alert(tmp[0]);
 What should I do differently to get the alert to show "foo" ? (Hmm. I guess I could write more clojurescript to use the value and see how that appears when compiled to javascript...)
@CODE:(defn myFn [] ["foo" "bar"]) my.ns.myFn = function myFn() {
  return cljs.core.PersistentVector.fromArray(["foo", "bar"], true)
}; alert(my.ns.myFn()); var tmp = my.ns.myFn();
alert(tmp[0]);

@CONTENT:I have a text file containing 10 hundreds of lines, with different lengths. Now I want to select N lines randomly, save them in another file, and remove them from the original file. I've found some answers to this question, but most of them use a simple idea: sort the file and select first or last N lines. unfortunately this idea doesn't work to me, because I want to preserve the order of lines. I tried this piece of code, but it's very slow and takes hours. FILEsrc=$1;

while [ "$LineIndex" -le "$MaxLines" ]

sed -i -e  ${X}d ${FILEsrc};       #remove selected line from source file

done
 I found this line the most time consuming one in the code: sed -i -e  ${X}d ${FILEsrc};

 and I found this: http://mathiasbynens.be/demo/url-regex I would like to use the diegoperini's regex (which according to the tests is the best): _^(?:(?:https?|ftp)://)(?:\S+(?::\S*)?@)?(?:(?!10(?:\.\d{1,3}){3})(?!127(?:\.\d{1,3}){3})(?!169\.254(?:\.\d{1,3}){2})(?!192\.168(?:\.\d{1,3}){2})(?!172\.(?:1[6-9]|2\d|3[0-1])(?:\.\d{1,3}){2})(?:[1-9]\d?|1\d\d|2[01]\d|22[0-3])(?:\.(?:1?\d{1,2}|2[0-4]\d|25[0-5])){2}(?:\.(?:[1-9]\d?|1\d\d|2[0-4]\d|25[0-4]))|(?:(?:[a-z\x{00a1}-\x{ffff}0-9]+-?)*[a-z\x{00a1}-\x{ffff}0-9]+)(?:\.(?:[a-z\x{00a1}-\x{ffff}0-9]+-?)*[a-z\x{00a1}-\x{ffff}0-9]+)*(?:\.(?:[a-z\x{00a1}-\x{ffff}]{2,})))(?::\d{2,5})?(?:/[^\s]*)?$_iuS
 But I want o make it global to replace all the url's in a string. When I use this: /_(?:(?:https?|ftp)://)(?:\S+(?::\S*)?@)?(?:(?!10(?:\.\d{1,3}){3})(?!127(?:\.\d{1,3}){3})(?!169\.254(?:\.\d{1,3}){2})(?!192\.168(?:\.\d{1,3}){2})(?!172\.(?:1[6-9]|2\d|3[0-1])(?:\.\d{1,3}){2})(?:[1-9]\d?|1\d\d|2[01]\d|22[0-3])(?:\.(?:1?\d{1,2}|2[0-4]\d|25[0-5])){2}(?:\.(?:[1-9]\d?|1\d\d|2[0-4]\d|25[0-4]))|(?:(?:[a-z\x{00a1}-\x{ffff}0-9]+-?)*[a-z\x{00a1}-\x{ffff}0-9]+)(?:\.(?:[a-z\x{00a1}-\x{ffff}0-9]+-?)*[a-z\x{00a1}-\x{ffff}0-9]+)*(?:\.(?:[a-z\x{00a1}-\x{ffff}]{2,})))(?::\d{2,5})?(?:/[^\s]*)?_iuS/g
 It does not work, how do I make this regex global and what does the underscore at the beginning and the "_iuS", at the end, means? I would like to use it with php so I am using: preg_replace($regex, '<a href="$0">$0</a>', $examplestring);

@TITLE:Project reference vs. file links in Mono multi-target projects
@CONTENT:I've seen a few discussions regarding this issue, but I've yet to see clear-cut answers, certainly not for MonoTouch / Mono for Android. I'm developing a Xamarin-based multi-target solution and naturally I have a lot of common code. Ideally, this code will reside in a "common" standard .NET class library project (or project). When I reference this project in platform-specific project, I do get the warning "The project 'Common' cannot be referenced. The referenced project is targeted to a different framework family (.NETFramework)", but the solution is still compiled successfully. Essentially, I'm asking if I must use the file links approach when my common code is addressing multiple targets. In more detail, my questions are: Is the above approach valid when my "common" projects reference only assemblies which are supported by Mono* targets? If the answer to the above is yes: Say I reference a 3rd party .NET library (in a form of a DLL, not a project) in my "common" project, and this library does have different assemblies for different targets (but it doesn't reference an assembly not supported by Mono*), can I still reference the Windows version of the assembly and get away with it?

 This is how I need the information. Basically its SUM(count) but in a column for each "route": drug_id | PO | IV 
-----------------
1       | 2  | 10
2       | 6  | 2
 I assume I need a pivot, which I was trying to learn about, but I cannot for the life of me piece together a succinct query which will work. I've tried things like: SELECT drug_id, PO, IV 
FROM 
    (
        SELECT drug_id, SUM(count) as PO, '0' as IV FROM `core_reports_antiinfectives` WHERE route="PO"

    ) aa
 However this gives me 0 for ALL IV columns, and I'm not convinced that its appropriate anyway - it'll need to "group" by drug_id and put the columns together, which I am also stuck on. Is there something I am missing? Or is there a better way to go about it? Thanks!

 Unfortunately the above code fails to compile, with the following errors: error CS0106: The modifier 'abstract' is not valid for this item error CS0106: The modifier 'public' is not valid for this item error CS0106: The modifier 'override' is not valid for this item error CS0106: The modifier 'public' is not valid for this item However if the interface is instead a non-nested interface, like this: public interface SomeInterface

public abstract class B : SomeInterface

public class C : B

 It compiles OK. Why the compiler error in the first case? Am I missing something here? Or is it not allowed to implement a nested interface with an abstract class?

 This works exactly as expected and produces the following "swingloggingsscce.log" file: Sep 09, 2012 8:37:43 PM swingloggingsscce.SwingLoggingSSCCE logButtonActionPerformed

 Now I am trying to get the same thing to work in my main application. This is the class with main(): /*

 I won't include the rest of the code as there are 24 classes for the complete application. The problem is that my BBCT application creates a "log/bbct.log" file, but after running the application, the file is empty! I don't see how my code for the Baseball class differs from SwingLoggingSSCCE. Obviously something is different, though, or else it would work. I just need some fresh eyes to look at my code, I think. In the mean time, I'll try to figure it out on my own. Thanks in advance for your help. Edit: I forgot to mention that SwingLoggingSSCCE also displays the logging information on the console, but bbct.Baseball does not. Update: Okay, I have narrowed down the problem a little bit. I added a call to Logger.log() before creating the BaseballCardIO object. This appears in the log file, but not the one after bcio is created. I guess I just need to continue my investigation from there. ** Another Update:** The following constructor seems to be the source of my logging issues: public BaseballCardJDBCIO(String url) throws BBCTIOException {
    try {
        Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(BaseballCardJDBCIO.class.getName());
        logger.log(Level.INFO, "Creating BaseballCardJDBCIO object");
        logger.log(Level.INFO, "Getting database connection.");
        this.conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url);

        logger.log(Level.INFO, "Creating table");
        this.createTable();
    } catch (SQLException ex) {
        // TODO: Need a more user-friendly error message.
        throw new BBCTIOException(ex);
    }
}
 All logging stops after the call to DriverManager.getConnection(url);. Some further research shows that JDBC uses java.util.logging. I probably don't want all of the JDBC logging data. However, JDBC seems to be interfering with the logging I need to add to my application. Is this a "feature" of JDBC?

 This is the part of the mlab code that flags the error: dx.max()-dx.min() = 1.7763568394002505e-15
dy.max()-dy.min() = 0.0
epsy = np.finfo(yi.dtype).resolution 
if dx.max()-dx.min() > epsx or dy.max()-dy.min() > epsy:
   raise ValueError("output grid must have constant spacing"
                    " when using interp='linear'")
 I would love to know how to get around this problem. I don't own this python installation so I cannot modify the if statement. Sometimes this works and sometimes it doesn't, it seems to depend on the data input but in this case when it does break, the dy and dy are all the same. Is this a bug in mlab? If I change to 'nn' instead of linear, the problem goes away but I need the 'linear' interpolation. Thanks, /Shejo284

@TITLE:Test Event expiration in Drools Fusion CEP
@CONTENT:Ciao, I have tested in several ways, but I'm still unable to test and verify the Event expiration mechanism in Drools Fusion, so I'm looking for some little guidance, please? I've read the manual and I'm interested in this feature: In other words, one an event is inserted into the working memory, it is possible for the engine to find out when an event can no longer match other facts and automatically retract it, releasing its associated resources. I'm using the Drools IDE in Eclipse, 5.4.0.Final and I modified the template code created by the "New Drools Project" wizard to test and verify for Event expiration. The code below. The way I understood to make the "lifecycle" to work correctly is that: You must setup the KBase in STREAM mode - check You must Insert the Events in temporal order - check You must define temporal constraints between Events - check in my case is last Message() However, when I inspect the EventFactHandle at the end, none of the Event() has expired. Thanks for your help. Java: public class DroolsTest {

    public static final void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            KnowledgeBase kbase = readKnowledgeBase();
            // I do want the pseudo clock
            KnowledgeSessionConfiguration conf = KnowledgeBaseFactory.newKnowledgeSessionConfiguration();
            conf.setOption(ClockTypeOption.get("pseudo"));
            StatefulKnowledgeSession ksession = kbase.newStatefulKnowledgeSession(conf, null);
            SessionPseudoClock clock = ksession.getSessionClock();
            KnowledgeRuntimeLogger logger = KnowledgeRuntimeLoggerFactory.newFileLogger(ksession, "test");
            // Insert of 2 Event:
            Message message = new Message();

@LINK:/questions/12334646/semi-sandboxing-javascript-eval
@TITLE:Semi-sandboxing Javascript eval
@CONTENT:Background: I'm working on a framework/library to be used for a specific site in coordination with greasemonkey/userscripts. This framework/library will allow for addon support. The way it will work is an addon registers with the library listing required pages, resources, ectera and the library will wait until all critera is met to call the addon's load() function. The Issue:In this listing of 'required stuff' I want addon devs to be able to specify javascript(as string) to be evaluated as a 'required resource'. For example 'document.getElementById("banana")'. What I want to do is semi-sandbox the evaluation of 'required resource' so the evaluation can access the window & DOM objects but is not able to directly alter them. I'd also like to make eval, and evalJS inaccessible from the sandbox. Examples: document.getElementById("banana") -> valid document.getElementById("apple).id = "orange" -> invalid window.grape -> valid window.grape = 'potato' -> invalid (someObj.applesCount > 0 ? 'some' : 'none') -> valid What I have so far: function safeEval(input) {

    // Remove eval and evalJS from the window:
    var e = [window.eval, window.evalJS], a;
    window.eval = function(){};
    window.evalJS = function(){};

    try {

        /* More sanition needed before being passed to eval */

        // Eval the input, stuffed into an annonomous function
        // so the code to be evalued can not access the stored
        // eval functions:
        a = (e[0])("(function(){return "+input+"}())");
    } catch(ex){}

    // Return eval and evalJS to the window:
    window.eval = e[0];
    window.evalJS = e[1];

    // Return the eval'd result
    return a;
}
 Notes: This is a Greasemonkey/userscript. I do not have direct access to alter the site, or it's javascript. The input for safeEval() can be any valid javascript, be it a DOM query, or simple evaluations so long as it does not alter the window object or DOM.
@CODE:load() 'document.getElementById("banana")' document.getElementById("banana") document.getElementById("apple).id = "orange" window.grape window.grape = 'potato' (someObj.applesCount > 0 ? 'some' : 'none') function safeEval(input) {

if exists(
select BetSlipID from betslips where MatchID = MatchIDP and UserID = User)

else
(
   insert into Betslips (MatchID,TipID , UserID) value (MatchIDP,TipID,User)

 I just want to check if data exists in table before i do insert , and i can not use "On duplicate key update" because my primary key does not mean anything , its table where i put in 2-3 foreign keys ....

@TITLE:PHP to detect and convert Special Characters?
@CONTENT:In PHP when i read the Data, let say the data (chunks of strings) is containing HTML Special Character DECIMAL HEX Codes like: This is a sample string with &#x153; and &#x161; We can say above HEX codes are the source codes of its correspondence Symbol and these will be rendered as correct Symbols in Browser. But what i want to do is, for these characters (for example), i want these HEX(es) as the converted original Character Symbols like: This is a sample string with ? and ? So how can i detect the any of decimal HEX Codes inside a string and convert each of them into final Symbol(s), instead of keeping HEX codes? Note: For more clearence, is there any function to detect and convert the Hex to Symbol? Like: &#x153; => ? &#x161; => ?
@CODE:This is a sample string with &#x153; and &#x161; This is a sample string with ? and ? &#x153; ? &#x161; ?

@CONTENT:I have to display a table dynamically as follows: If there are 3 names:

@TITLE:evp_encrypt wont work in a for loop in c
@CONTENT:I'm new here so please excuse if I'm doing something wrong. I attempt to make an array with encrypted strings, I'm using the EVP API for the encryption. This works fine, but wHen I try to use the encrypt function in a foor loop the console gives me nothing. Here is my encrypt function: char *encrypt(char *key, char *iv, char * source){

    //char *target;
    int in_len, out_len;
    EVP_CIPHER_CTX ctx;
    in_len=strlen((const char *)source);
    unsigned char *target = (unsigned char *) malloc(in_len);
        //printf("This is the text before ciphering: %s\n",source);
        //printf("The length of the string is: %d\n",in_len);

        EVP_CIPHER_CTX_init(&ctx);
        EVP_EncryptInit_ex(&ctx,EVP_aes_128_cbc(),NULL,(unsigned char*) key,(unsigned char*)iv);
        EVP_EncryptUpdate(&ctx,target,&out_len,(unsigned char*)source,in_len);
        EVP_EncryptFinal_ex(&ctx,target,&out_len);
        target[out_len] = '\0';

        //EVP_CIPHER_CTX_cleanup(&ctx);


        return ((char *)target);
}
 and in main the loop: int main(){
    char source[17]="Shahababamamaaaa";
    char key[17]="ahardtobreakkey1";
    char iv[17] = "veryinterestingv";
     int rows = 1280;
     int cols = (3*800)/16;
        char *encrypted=encrypt(key, iv, source);
        printf("encrypted: %s\n", encrypted);
        char *encrypted2;
        encrypted2=encrypt(key, iv, encrypted);
        printf("encrypted2: %s\n", encrypted2);
        char *mx[rows];
        char *in, *temp;
        in = (char *) malloc ( cols * sizeof(char) );
        temp =(char *) malloc ( strlen(encrypted) );
        int i, j;

        for (i=0; i<5; i++){
            strcpy(in,encrypted);
            for(j=0;j<3;j++){
                    printf("in: %s\n", in);
                    strcpy(temp, encrypted2);
                    printf("temp: %s\n", temp);
                    memset(encrypted2,0x00, strlen(encrypted));
                    encrypted2=encrypt(key, iv,temp);
                    printf("encrypted2 nach j=%d : %s\n",j, encrypted2);

                    mx[i]=in;
            }

        }
        printf("Stele 0 Inhalt %s\n",mx[0]);
        printf("Laenge von 1 %d\n", strlen(mx[0]));

        //system ("PAUSE");
        free(in);
        return 0;

     }
 What am I missing? Is it imposible to use encrypt2 again? Thank you very much.

@LINK:/questions/12327609/qpushbutton-changes-margins-on-other-widgets-in-the-same-layout
@TITLE:QPushButton changes margins on other widgets in the same layout
@CONTENT:I have a big layout that contains widgets and layouts of the following structure: QVBoxLayout
  QTableView
  QPushButton
 I set the margins, padding, and spacing on the layout to 0. The way this renders on Mac OS X, the button doesn't fill all of its space. Instead, there is some padding around it. Magically, the layout seems to know this, and makes sure the table view is exactly as wide as the button is wide: When I remove the button, the table view returns to its full width: How can I change it so the button, as well as the table view, become as wide as the layout? I've played with stylesheet's padding and margin, and while I can use those to make the button wider, the extra padding around the tree view remains. The only solution I have so far is to wrap the button in another widget, and then set its margin and padding to 0 via stylesheet, but then I lose the rounded look.

@LINK:/questions/12327086/in-opencv-what-data-types-does-cv2-filter2d-expect
@TITLE:In OpenCV, what data types does cv2.filter2D() expect?
@CONTENT:I'm teaching myself about edge detectors, and I'm trying to use OpenCV's filter2D to implement my own gradient calculator, similar to cv2.Sobel(). In the Python interface to OpenCV, cv2.filter2D() allows users to convolve an image with a custom filter. In OpenCV nomenclature, this filter is called a "kernel." Using an image (per00001.png) from the MIT pedestrian dataset, I find that cv2.Sobel() produces a reasonable looking output. (Code is below, output image is here.) #OpenCV's Sobel code (outputs nice-looking gradient)
import cv2, numpy
img = cv2.imread("./per00001.png")

gradientX = cv2.Sobel(img, -1, 1, 0)

compression_params = [cv2.cv.CV_IMWRITE_PNG_COMPRESSION, 9]
cv2.imwrite("gradientX.png", gradientX, compression_params)
  GOOD  BROKEN When I try to implement my own Sobel()-like code (below), I get an all-black image. I'm speculating that the problem is with the data type of the kernel parameter (horizontalSobelMtx) that I'm passing into cv2.filter2D(). However, I haven't been able to find any documentation about the kernel data type for cv2.filter2D(). #Custom Sobel code (outputs all-black image)
import cv2, numpy
img = cv2.imread("./per00001.png")

horizontalSobelMtx = [[-1,0,1],[-2,0,2],[-1,0,1]]
horizontalSobelMtx = numpy.asanyarray(horizontalSobelMtx) #guessing about appropriate datatype.
gradientX_customSobel = cv2.filter2D(img, -1, horizontalSobelMtx)

compression_params = [cv2.cv.CV_IMWRITE_PNG_COMPRESSION, 9]
cv2.imwrite("gradientX_customSobel.png", gradientX_customSobel, compression_params)
 So, here are my questions: 1) What data type does cv2.filter2D(..., kernel, ...) expect for the kernel parameter? 2) If the data type of kernel isn't the problem here, then what's causing my custom Sobel code to output a blank image?
@CODE:filter2D cv2.Sobel() cv2.filter2D() cv2.Sobel() #OpenCV's Sobel code (outputs nice-looking gradient)
import cv2, numpy
img = cv2.imread("./per00001.png")

gradientX = cv2.Sobel(img, -1, 1, 0)

compression_params = [cv2.cv.CV_IMWRITE_PNG_COMPRESSION, 9]
cv2.imwrite("gradientX.png", gradientX, compression_params) Sobel() horizontalSobelMtx cv2.filter2D() cv2.filter2D() #Custom Sobel code (outputs all-black image)

@TITLE:Java: Finding the shortest word in a string and printing it out
@CONTENT:I'm a novice with Java. I took a class in C, so I'm trying to get myself out of that mode of thinking. The program I'm writing has a section in which the user enters an integer, n, and then n number of words afterwards. This section then searches through those words and finds the shortest one, then returns it to the user. For instance, an input might be: INPUT: 4 JAVA PROGRAMMING IS FUN OUTPUT: IS The code I have currently seems to return the wrong word. In this instance, it returns "PROGRAMMING", when it should return "IS". I thought maybe you all could point me in the right direction. int numwords = scan.nextInt();
    String sentence = scan.nextLine();
    String shortestword = new String();
    String[] words = sentence.split(" ");
    for (int i = 0; i < numwords; i++){
        if (shortestword.length() < words[i].length()){
            shortestword = words[i];

        }
    }
    System.out.printf(shortestword);
 To give you an idea of what I was trying to do, I was attempting to enter the words into a string, "sentence," then break that string up into individual words in an array, "words[]," then run a for loop to compare the strings to each other by comparing the lengths to the entries in the array. Thank you for your assistance!
@CODE:int numwords = scan.nextInt();
    String sentence = scan.nextLine();
    String shortestword = new String();
    String[] words = sentence.split(" ");
    for (int i = 0; i < numwords; i++){
        if (shortestword.length() < words[i].length()){
            shortestword = words[i];

        }
    }
    System.out.printf(shortestword);

@CONTENT:I have an app in JavaFX that is getting a bit large, and I want to keep the code readable. I have a LineChart that I want to have zoom functionality built in, that occurs on a mouseclick. I know I need to register a mouse listener to the chart. What I cannot figure out from Oracle examples, ie as written here: http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/events/handlers.htm is how to NOT have my handler defined inline to the registering. In other words, I want the body of the handler (which is many lines of code) to be in another class. Can I do that? And if so, how do I register the handler to my chart in my main Javafx controller code?

@TITLE:JQuery FullCalendar trouble with invoking rerenderEvents from ajax success
@CONTENT:For some reason, I cannot get the calendar to rerender after a POST. All goes well up to that point: $('#calendar').fullCalendar({
    ...
    select: function (startDate, endDate) {
        $.ajax({
            url: 'data.php',
            type: "POST",
            data: {
                'start':startDate,
                'end':endDate,
                }
            success: $('#calendar').fullCalendar('rerenderEvents')
            }
     ...
    });
 The data posts successfully, my php script adds the new event to the database just fine. The only problem is that the calendar is not being rerendered with the new data in the database. If I refresh the page (F5 in Firefox) the new event is rendered. Obviously, I need the event to show up as soon as it has been committed to the database. I can't expect my user to refresh the page. I have done many permutations of this success statment, eg: function () {
    $('#calendar').fullCalendar('rerenderEvents');
}
 and (with my php returning 'success'), function (data) {
    if (data === 'success') $('#calendar').fullCalendar('renderEvents');
}
 However, no matter what, the new event added to the database only shows up if I refresh the screen. Can anyone suggest what I might be doing wrong?
@CODE:$('#calendar').fullCalendar({
    ...
    select: function (startDate, endDate) {
        $.ajax({
            url: 'data.php',

@CONTENT:I'm building a new site using HTML5 Boilerplate 4.0, and am running into trouble with its jQuery local fallback code. The code in question is here: <!-- <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.1/jquery.min.js"></script> -->

 I'm developing locally, for now, so I've commented out the CDN line. My problem is that jQuery does load, but it loads after plugins.js and main.js, leading to undefined errors. The closest to maybe an explanation I've found is the #4 point of this previous answer, which suggests this would be expected, but... the above is easily the most used local fallback code for jQuery, and it's H5BP, which is heavily vetted. I must be missing something, yes?

I am having an issue with the data being updated, so I want to debug it to see what is happening.

@CONTENT:I have a binary image of several connected components, some large and some small (maybe only 1 pixel). With this I am seeking a way to make each connected component into a checkers pattern, instead of the connected blobs, in an efficient way. So far I have come up with two ways this could be tried, but they can either produce errors, or be quite unefficient: I know the entire image and can make a checkers pattern mask to remove 50% of the pixels. This is very fast, but will on average remove 50% of the connected components which are only one pixel in area. Use bwlabel() in MATLAB/Octave, and loop through each connected component only applying the mask to that component if it is over 1 pixel (while leaving the other components to be considered when the loop gets to them). This can be very inefficient. Any smart/built-in solutions which could be used? Code to generate figure T = zeros(40,40);
T(10:30,10:30) = 1;

chessVec = repmat([1;0],20,1);

@TITLE:Retrieving values from a PHP Multi-dimensional Array
@CONTENT:I have a multi-dimensional array that I want to print statistics from for a website admin. My problem is that once I get the data into an array in the format I want it, I can't figure out how to retrieve it. I have to know the key values in order to get it e.g. $uniqueBrowser["Firefox"]["14.0.1"]['times']; I want to be able to say for example - Firefox 70%, IE 30% as a start (aggregate all version 'times used' for the browsers). I then want to drill down further to specific versions e.g. FF3.6 14%, FF14 51% etc. (simply printing out the times value associated with the version). EDIT: My Question is, how do I retrieve my data in the way described above? My head is fried and I've been on this for too long. Please someone put me out of my misery. If there is a better way to do this, please let me know also. The code I have so far is below. This code is run in a for each loop which iterates through data returned by the database. The $browser and $version variables are set to the browser values and version values returned from the database at each iteration of the foreach loop. if(in_array($browser, $uniqueBrowser)) {        
    if(in_array($version, $uniqueBrowser[$browser])) {
        $uniqueBrowser[$browser][$version]['times'] = $uniqueBrowser[$browser][$version]['times'] + 1;
    } else {            
        $uniqueBrowser[$browser]['version'] = $version;
        $uniqueBrowser[$browser][$version]['times'] = 1;
    }       
} else {
    $uniqueBrowser[] = $browser;
    $uniqueBrowser[$browser]['version'] = $version;
    $uniqueBrowser[$browser][$version]['times'] = 1;
}

 I expect that calling o.some_method_that_uses_external_class() in test.py will not actually use external interface, but mock object. But seems still actual object is used.

Even if I try to apply the same patch in b.py (as class decorator). What am I doing wrong? I use python 2.7 and mock library 1.0 by Michael Foord if that matters.

@TITLE:socialauth - can you use same session across a redirect?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to use socialauth to login with google, facebook et al (I'll assume google here) and have a question about how it works. I'm using JSF 2 without Seam. The basic idea is that you: make a few API calls indicating that you want to login with google. make another API call which returns a URL for google. supply a result URL which will be used by google to redirect back to your site. redirect to the google URL. then google will either immediately redirect back to your site or first ask for login details. My confusion is about linking together the data from the outbound and inbound sides. In the getting started page (linked above) they suggest this: Outbound SocialAuthManager manager = new SocialAuthManager();
String successUrl = "http://my.domain.com/socialauthd/successAction.xhtml";
String url = manager.getAuthenticationUrl(id, successUrl);
// Store in session
session.setAttribute("authManager", manager);
 Inbound // get the auth provider manager from session
SocialAuthManager manager = (SocialAuthManager)session.getAttribute("authManager");
 The problem I have is that I don't see how this can work, and it doesn't in testing. They suggest storing a reference to an instance of SocialAuthManager in the session, however when the request is received from google a new session is created. It doesn't have the JSESSIONID cookie and so isn't part of the session that sent the request to google in the first place. To work around this I got a unique per-request id from the socialauth api (openid.assoc_handle - it's sent as a query param), put it in a concurrentHashMap in an app scoped bean, and retrieve the reference in a preRenderView listener in the completion page (successUrl - badly named in the example as it is called either way). This all seems like a lot of hassle for something that isn't included in the documentation. I've tried this with @RequestScoped CDI beans, although I usually use CODI @ViewAccessScoped. With CODI I've tried adding the windowId to the success URL, and also adding the JSESSIONID cookie to the redirect, but neither approaches work. I don't think the bean scope is relevant but the more information the better. I could dive into the spring, seam and struts examples but for a pure EE 6 developer it's a lot of overhead, and with a better understanding of this issue I can produce a simple, working, JSF only example which I will make available to the socialauth team for use on google code. Am I missing something obvious or does this just have to be complicated? and if so why did they document an approach that simply doesn't work? Edit: I think that the successUrl may be named more appropriately than I thought, because in testing with Yahoo I realise that you won't be redirected back to your own site unless correct login details are provided. I expect this is the same for all providers. I have added some comments regarding this solution to the socialauth site, and also to an issue I logged about this problem (neither of which have received any response from anyone involved in the socialauth project).
@CODE:SocialAuthManager manager = new SocialAuthManager();
String successUrl = "http://my.domain.com/socialauthd/successAction.xhtml";
String url = manager.getAuthenticationUrl(id, successUrl);
// Store in session
session.setAttribute("authManager", manager); // get the auth provider manager from session

So formulating an equation for this, T(n) = 2T(n-1) + c In order to find the complexity of this one, I used the recursive tree method. Since input is divided into 2 at each step, the number of nodes will get squared at each step while since only one element is getting eliminated, every level will lose only one element from the list.

@TITLE:How can I set a binding to a Combox in a UserControl?
@CONTENT:I have spent several days on this issue and can't seem to get it to work. I have a user control that is saved out to a xaml file with the following code:         StringBuilder outstr = new StringBuilder();
        XmlWriterSettings settings = new XmlWriterSettings();
        settings.Indent = true;
        settings.OmitXmlDeclaration = true;

        XamlDesignerSerializationManager dsm = new 
        XamlDesignerSerializationManager(XmlWriter.Create(outstr, settings));
        dsm.XamlWriterMode = XamlWriterMode.Expression;

        System.Windows.Markup.XamlWriter.Save(test1, dsm);

        String saveCard = outstr.ToString();

        File.WriteAllText("inputEnum.xaml", saveCard);
 Xaml for the user control: <Grid >
    <Grid.ColumnDefinitions>
        <ColumnDefinition Width="{Binding DescriptionWidth}" />
        <ColumnDefinition Width="{Binding ValueWidth}" />
    </Grid.ColumnDefinitions>

    <ComboBox Grid.Column="1" Background="White" FontSize="{Binding FontSizeValue}" Width="Auto" 
              Padding="10,0,5,0" ItemsSource="{Binding ComboItemsProperty}" SelectedIndex="{Binding EnumSelectedIndex}">

    </ComboBox>
</Grid>
 The ItemsSource in the combobox is what is giving me problems. When I save an instance of this usercontrol out to a file, from my understanding, the {Binding ComboItemsProperty} is lost. So, in the constructor of my usercontrol I have: public UserInputEnum()
{
     InitializeComponent();

     Binding bind = new Binding();
     bind.Mode = BindingMode.TwoWay;
     bind.Source = this;
     bind.Path = new PropertyPath("ComboItemsProperty");
     this.SetBinding(ComboBox.ItemsSourceProperty, bind);
}
 Here is my property and the changed method:     EnumItemsCollection ComboItems = new EnumItemsCollection();
    public EnumItemsCollection ComboItemsProperty
    {
        get { return ComboItems; }
        set 
        { 
            ComboItems = value;
            OnPropertyChanged("ComboItemsProperty"); 
        }
    }
    public void OnPropertyChanged(string propertyName)
    {
        getEnumItems(this.ComboItemsProperty, this.EnumSelectedIndex, this.ID, this.SubmodeID);
        PropertyChangedEventHandler handler = PropertyChanged;
        if (handler != null)
        {
            handler(this.ComboItems, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(propertyName));
        }
    }
 Just a note. EnumItemsCollection is a simple class that inherits off ObservableCollection. There is nothing else to this class. (not sure if this makes a difference). I think this should work but when when I load the XAML file through the XAMLReader, my combobox items won't update. EDIT: I ran a little test on an instance of user control that wasn't loaded from XAML but is in the MainWindow.xaml. Everything works fine. When I add to the ComboItemsProperty, the combobox updates. So, I took away the {Binding ComboItemsProperty} and tried to set the binding in the code as above changing 'this' to the instance of the user control. Didn't work. This tells me it is the binding code that is not functioning correctly. I'm fairly certain is the bind.Source line that is the issue. When it is in a UserControl I am unsure of what to put there. EDIT: Code that loads usercontrol from file: FileStream stream = File.Open("usercontrol.xaml", FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read);

 It loads perfectly fine. The Binding just isn't working(ItemsSource={Binding ComboItemsProperty}) because Bindings aren't saved out. I load it from a file because this program will have many User Interfaces in a sense. Each one will be loaded by a different person using the program.

        XamlDesignerSerializationManager(XmlWriter.Create(outstr, settings));
        dsm.XamlWriterMode = XamlWriterMode.Expression;

        System.Windows.Markup.XamlWriter.Save(test1, dsm);

        String saveCard = outstr.ToString();

@TITLE:How to make Google Chrome extension sample work?
@CONTENT:Recently I decided to write a very simple Google Chrome extension. All it's going to do is to hide some DOM-elements from the web-page using JavaScript when user presses the extension's button. Since I knew nothing about Chrome extensions, I started reading tutorials, and I came across this Google's sample: A browser action with no icon that makes the page red This sample is really close to what I want to make. The problem is that I can't make it work. Whenever I load the extension in Chrome, I can see the button of this extension, but when I press it - nothing happens. Sample doesn't work, probably I should know something I don't know yet. And before you started asking me: Yes, I tried restarting the browser; I use the newest version of Chrome. Thanks for help.

The map filter is to "map/collect an array on a given property" - but how do you determine the property? This example exists - Liquid Template Map Filter - but it seems specific to a single use case. How does map work generally? I understand that the output to be filtered is array, but what is the parameter for map? For example: {{ page.tags | map: 'name' }}
 What is name? Is it the label for the value to be output? For a given object, how does one determine what that label might be?

@TITLE:What is the preferred method of creating, using and dropping temp tables in sql server?
@CONTENT:When using temp tables in SQL Server stored procs, is the preferred practice to; 1) Create the temp table, populate it, use it then drop it CREATE TABLE #MyTable ( ... )

-- Do stuff

DROP TABLE #MyTable
 2) Check if it exists, drop it if it does, then create and use it IF object_id('tempdb..#MyTable') IS NOT NULL
DROP TABLE #MyTable

CREATE TABLE #MyTable ( ... )
 3) Create it and let SQL Server clean it up when it goes out of scope CREATE TABLE #MyTable ( ... )

-- Do Stuff
 I read in this answer and its associated comments, that this can be useful in situations where the temp table is reused that SQL Server will truncate the table but keep the structure to save time. My stored proc is likely to be called pretty frequently, but it only contains a few columns, so I don't know how advantageous this really is in my situation.
@CODE:CREATE TABLE #MyTable ( ... )

-- Do stuff

DROP TABLE #MyTable IF object_id('tempdb..#MyTable') IS NOT NULL
DROP TABLE #MyTable

CREATE TABLE #MyTable ( ... ) CREATE TABLE #MyTable ( ... )

@TITLE:CakePHP cookies not persisting after browser close
@CONTENT:I am in the process of moving away from Apache in favor of nginx due to the lower resource consumption. I have set up an Ubuntu Server box with the LEMP stack installed. After moving all my applications over (3 CakePHP 2.0.5 apps, 1 Wordpress install), everything seems to be working perfectly except for one thing - Cake's cookies suddenly disappear when the browser is closed. I have created a very simple test PHP page to test if cookies are working at all and they are in fact working, just not in Cake. Wordpress is also not having any troubles remembering me when I close my browser. Using the Chrome developer tools, I have inspected to see if the cookie is being set at all, and it is as you can see below: The expiry date is even set a month into the future as well, so I don't understand why they don't live past browser close. As soon as I fire my browser up and navigate to my app, the cookie is now gone: One thing I did notice is that with my app running on Apache, the CAKEPHP cookie you see above above has the same value before and after close. However on the nginx server, that cookie has a different value everytime I close and re-open my browser. I thought this might have to do with sessions, so I checked my session settings in core.php and it's set to let PHP do the session handling: Configure::write('Session', array(
    'defaults' => 'php'
));
 I've checked my /tmp directory and session files are being created. I tried changing the session handler to cake so that Cake would store sessions in its app/tmp/sessions directory, and while the sessions would successfully get created in this directory my cookies are still lost on browser close. Has anybody experienced this behavior between nginx and Cake before, or have any ideas as to why this might be happening?

@CONTENT:I am using a ConcurrentHashMap as my datastructure because mutiple threads will be reading and writing to it concurrently. But I am finding that the client code will also need to iterate over it quite often . So I took a look in LinkedHashMap class which gives better iteration performance and found this section in its java doc : A linked hash map has two parameters that affect its performance: initial capacity and load factor. They are defined precisely as for HashMap. Note, however, that the penalty for choosing an excessively high value for initial capacity is less severe for this class than for HashMap, as iteration times for this class are unaffected by capacity. So iteration doesn't depend on capacity .What other operations depend on initial capacity for a LinkedHashMap or HashMap in general ?Also is there any concurrent version of the LinkedHashMap in recent JDK versions ?

@TITLE:Fastest way to insert object if it doesn't exist with SQLAlchemy
@CONTENT:So I'm quite new to SQLAlchemy. I have a model Showing which has about 10,000 rows in the table. Here is the class: class Showing(Base):
    __tablename__   = "showings"

    id              = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    time            = Column(DateTime)
    link            = Column(String)
    film_id         = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('films.id'))
    cinema_id       = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('cinemas.id'))

    def __eq__(self, other):
        if self.time == other.time and self.cinema == other.cinema and self.film == other.film:
            return True
        else:
            return False
 Could anyone give me some guidance on the fastest way to insert a new showing if it doesn't exist already. I think it is slightly more complicated because a showing is only unique if the time, cinmea, and film are unique on a showing. I currently have this code: def AddShowings(self, showing_times, cinema, film):
    all_showings = self.session.query(Showing).options(joinedload(Showing.cinema), joinedload(Showing.film)).all()
    for showing_time in showing_times:
        tmp_showing = Showing(time=showing_time[0], film=film, cinema=cinema, link=showing_time[1])
        if tmp_showing not in all_showings:
            self.session.add(tmp_showing)
            self.session.commit()
            all_showings.append(tmp_showing)
 which works, but seems to be very slow. Any help is much appreciated.
@CODE:class Showing(Base):
    __tablename__   = "showings"

    id              = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    time            = Column(DateTime)
    link            = Column(String)
    film_id         = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('films.id'))
    cinema_id       = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('cinemas.id'))

    def __eq__(self, other):
        if self.time == other.time and self.cinema == other.cinema and self.film == other.film:
            return True
        else:
            return False def AddShowings(self, showing_times, cinema, film):
    all_showings = self.session.query(Showing).options(joinedload(Showing.cinema), joinedload(Showing.film)).all()
    for showing_time in showing_times:
        tmp_showing = Showing(time=showing_time[0], film=film, cinema=cinema, link=showing_time[1])
        if tmp_showing not in all_showings:
            self.session.add(tmp_showing)
            self.session.commit()
            all_showings.append(tmp_showing)
