@TITLE:How do I create a multiline table cell in iOS?
@CONTENT:How can I get the second cell to expand to fit the text rather than scaling the text? Is there a built in way of doing this in iOS or will I have to come up with some home-cooked solution? If you look in the iOS Contacts application, there's a box like this for Address. I can't find how to implement this though. For anyone looking to achieve this in future, here's the code for my solution: HEADER file: #define FONT_SIZE 22.0f
#define CELL_CONTENT_WIDTH 320.0f
#define CELL_CONTENT_MARGIN 5.0f
 IMPLEMENTATION file: - (CGFloat)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView heightForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath {

    if (indexPath.section == 0 && indexPath.row == 1) {

        NSString *text = [atmAnnotation address];

        CGSize constraint = CGSizeMake(CELL_CONTENT_WIDTH - (CELL_CONTENT_MARGIN * 2), 20000.0f);

        CGSize size = [text sizeWithFont:[UIFont systemFontOfSize:FONT_SIZE] constrainedToSize:constraint lineBreakMode:UILineBreakModeWordWrap];
        NSLog(@"Size for address is Height:%f Width:%f",size.height,size.width);

        CGFloat height = MAX(size.height, 44.0f);

        return height + (CELL_CONTENT_MARGIN * 2);  

    }
    return 44.0f;
}
 Here's a screenshot of the result:
@CODE:#define FONT_SIZE 22.0f
#define CELL_CONTENT_WIDTH 320.0f
#define CELL_CONTENT_MARGIN 5.0f - (CGFloat)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView heightForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath {

    if (indexPath.section == 0 && indexPath.row == 1) {

@CONTENT:I'm currently trying to understand how IPv6 adresses work. There are link-local and site-local adresses used for small and organisational networks respectively. But if one of those clients also has internet access, it would need two IPs, correct? One link/site-local and one global adress. How is that managed by the interface and the routers? One interface would need two IPs, since there is no NAT in IPv6.

@TITLE:Handling large quantity of MKMapView Annotations
@CONTENT:I have a map view with a large quantity of annotations (3000+), when the user is zoomed to a reasonable level all is well and fast. Although when the user zooms out and a large quanitiy of annotations come into view there is a lot of slow down due to the sheer amount of annotations being shown at once. What is the best way to handle this? The current solution i am using: - (void)mapView:(MKMapView *)_mapView regionDidChangeAnimated:(BOOL)animated {

    NSArray *annotations = [_mapView annotations];  
    MapAnnotation *annotation = nil; 

    for (int i=0; i<[annotations count]; i++)
    {
        annotation = (MapAnnotation*)[annotations objectAtIndex:i];
        if (_mapView.region.span.latitudeDelta > .010)
        {
            [[_mapView viewForAnnotation:annotation] setHidden:YES];
            warningLabel.hidden = NO;
        }
        else {
            [[_mapView viewForAnnotation:annotation] setHidden:NO];
            warningLabel.hidden = YES;
        }
    }
}
 Works great although due to the sheer size of the loop this causes a lot of slow down when zooming in and out and scrolling around. I can't seem to think of a better way to handle this, is there a way to only loop through the annotations currently being displayed or something along those lines to reduce the size of the loop?
@CODE:- (void)mapView:(MKMapView *)_mapView regionDidChangeAnimated:(BOOL)animated {

    NSArray *annotations = [_mapView annotations];  
    MapAnnotation *annotation = nil; 

    for (int i=0; i<[annotations count]; i++)

@CONTENT:I've found three ways of instantiating a Singleton, but I have doubts as to whether any of them is the best there is. I'm using them in a multi-threaded environment and prefer lazy instantiation. Sample 1: private static final ClassName INSTANCE = new ClassName();

public static ClassName getInstance() {
    return INSTANCE;
}
 Sample 2: private static class SingletonHolder {

 Sample 3: private static ClassName INSTANCE;

public static synchronized ClassName getInstance()

}
 The project I'm using ATM uses Sample 2 everywhere, but I kind of like Sample 3 more. There is also the Enum version, but I just don't get it. The question here is - in which cases I should/shouldn't use any of these variations? I'm not looking for lengthy explanations though (there's plenty of other topics about that, but they all eventually turn into arguing IMO), I'd like it to be understandable with few words.

@CONTENT:I am using a layered architecture with the Entity Framework. Here's What I came up with till now (All the projects Except UI are class library): Entities: The POCO Entities. Completely persistence ignorant. No Reference to other projects. Generated by Microsoft's ADO.Net POCO Entity Generator. DAL: The EDMX (Entity Model) file with the context class. (t4 generated). References: Entities BLL: Business Logic Layer. Will implement repository pattern on this layer. References: Entities, DAL. This is where the objectcontext gets populated: var ctx=new DAL.MyDBEntities(); UI: The presentation layer: ASP.NET website. References: Entities, BLL + a connection string entry to entities in the config file (question #2). Now my three questions: Is my layer discintion approach correct? In my UI, I access BLL as follows: var customerRep = new BLL.CustomerRepository(); var Customer = customerRep.GetByID(myCustomerID); The problem is that I have to define the entities connection string in my UI's web.config/app.config otherwise I get a runtime exception. IS defining the entities connectionstring in UI spoils the layers' distinction? Or is it accesptible in a muli layered architecture. Should I take any additional steps to perform chage tracking, lazy loading, etc (by etc I mean the features that Entity Framework covers in a conventional, 1 project, non POCO code generation)? Thanks and apologies for the lengthy question.

@LINK:/questions/4229219/how-to-code-for-multitouch
@TITLE:How to code for multitouch
@CONTENT:So I'm developing an application that must handle multitouch. Basically I want single touch for rotating ( this is no problem ). And multitouch for scrolling. I have the basic code in, but I'm having problems when the shift from single to multitouch, and vice verca, occur. Basically the movement will jolt because the median position of the multitouch ( two fingers ) and the absolute position of the single finger are at a distance. So if I have two fingers on the screen, they make up a median position, and then lift one finger, it would be like a quick movement from that median position to the absolute single finger position. This will be the movement that I don't want. This is my code: @Override
public boolean onTouchEvent( MotionEvent event ) {
    float xEvent[] = new float[ 2 ];
    float yEvent[] = new float[ 2 ];
    switch( event.getPointerCount() ) {
        case 1:
            xEvent[ 0 ] = event.getX( 0 );
            yEvent[ 0 ] = event.getY( 0 );
            switch( event.getAction() ) {
                case MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN:
                    camera.onTouchDown( xEvent[ 0 ], yEvent[ 0 ] );
                    return true;
                case MotionEvent.ACTION_MOVE:
                    camera.onTouchRotate( xEvent[ 0 ], yEvent[ 0 ] );
                    return true;
                default: return super.onTouchEvent( event );
            }
        case 2:
            xEvent[ 0 ] = event.getX( 0 );
            yEvent[ 0 ] = event.getY( 0 );
            xEvent[ 1 ] = event.getX( 1 );
            yEvent[ 1 ] = event.getY( 1 );
            switch( event.getAction() ) {
                case MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN:
                    camera.onTouchDown( ( ( xEvent[ 0 ] + xEvent[ 1 ] ) / 2 ), ( ( yEvent[ 0 ] + yEvent[ 1 ] ) / 2 ) );
                    return true;
                case MotionEvent.ACTION_MOVE:
                    camera.onTouchSlide( ( ( xEvent[ 0 ] + xEvent[ 1 ] ) / 2 ), ( ( yEvent[ 0 ] + yEvent[ 1 ] ) / 2 ) );
                    return true;
                case MotionEvent.ACTION_POINTER_1_UP:
                    camera.onTouchDown( xEvent[ 1 ], yEvent[ 1 ] );
                    return true;
                case MotionEvent.ACTION_POINTER_2_UP:
                    camera.onTouchDown( xEvent[ 0 ], yEvent[ 0 ] );
                    return true;
                default: return super.onTouchEvent( event );
            }
        default: return false;
    }
}
 The onTouchDown function of the camera just sets the first value of the touch move. That's why I also use it in the up movement to set a new begin value for the single touch movement when coming from a multitouch. I hope someone knows what my problem is and can help me further.

@TITLE:Ways to implement data versioning in PostreSQL
@CONTENT:Can you share your thoughts how would you implement data versioning in PostgreSQL. (I've asked similar question regarding Cassandra and MongoDB. If you have any thoughts which db is better for that please share) Suppose that I need to version records in a simple address book. Address book records are stored in one table without relations for simplicity. I expect that the history: will be used infrequently will be used all at once to present it in a "time machine" fashion there won't be more versions than few hundred to a single record. history won't expire. I'm considering the following approaches: Create a new object table to store history of records with a copy of schema of addressbook table and add timestamp and foreign key to address book table. Create a kind of schema less table to store changes to address book records. Such table would consist of: AddressBookId, TimeStamp, FieldName, Value. This way I would store only changes to the records and I wouldn't have to keep history table and address book table in sync. Create a table to store seralized (JSON) address book records or changes to address book records. Such table would looks as follows: AddressBookId, TimeStamp, Object (varchar). Again this is schema less so I wouldn't have to keep the history table with address book table in sync. (This is modelled after Simple Document Versioning with CouchDB)

Eggs can be very hard or very fragile means it may break if dropped from the first floor or may not even break if dropped from 100 th floor.Both eggs are identical. You need to figure out the highest floor of a 100-storey building an egg can be dropped without breaking. Now the question is how many drops you need to make. You are allowed to break 2 eggs in the process I am sure the two egg problem ( mentioned above ) has been discussed sufficiently. However could someone help me understand why the following solution is not optimal. Let's say I use a segment and scan algorithm with the segment size s. So, d ( 100 / s   + (s-1) ) = 0    [ this should give the minima,  I need '(s-1)' scans per segment and there are '100/s' segments]
-
ds

=> -100 / s^2 + 1 = 0
=> s^2 = 100

 So according to this I need at most 19 drops. But the optimal solution can do this with 14 drops. So where lies the problem?
@CODE:s d ( 100 / s   + (s-1) ) = 0    [ this should give the minima,  I need '(s-1)' scans per segment and there are '100/s' segments]

ds

=> -100 / s^2 + 1 = 0
=> s^2 = 100
=> s = 10

@TITLE:Lifting methods to function values in Scala
@CONTENT:Does the Scala library provide any support for lifting a method of a given type to a function value? For example, suppose I want to lift String.length. I can write val f: String => Int = _.length
 or val f = { s: String => s.length }
 However, this syntax is not always ideal (particularly in the midst of a larger expression). I think I'm looking for something that will enable expressions like Lift[String](_.length)
Lift[Option[Int]].lift(_.filter)
 and I have in mind something like this: class Lift[T] {                                                          
   def apply[R](f: T => R): T => R = f

   def lift[A, R](f: (T) => (A) => R): (T, A) => R = 
         f(_)(_) 
   def lift[A1, A2, R](f: (T) => (A1, A2) => R): (T, A1, A2) => R =
         f(_)(_,_)
   // ... etc. ...
}
object Lift {
   def apply[T] = new Lift[T]
}
 Question 1: Does the standard library (or any library) provide something like this? Question 2: If not, is it possible to write it in such a way that Option.filter can be lifted as above (rather than as Lift[Option[Int]].lift[Int => Boolean, Option[Int]](_.filter))? Without supplying the type parameters on the lift method I get the following error: 
error: missing parameter type for expanded function ((x$1) => x$1.filter)
       Lift[Option[Int]].lift(_.filter)
                              ^
 Update: Apparently, the problem I'm running in to has something to do with the overloaded lift method. If I rename the overloads, I can lift Option.filter without all the extra type parameters.
@CODE:String.length val f: String => Int = _.length val f = { s: String => s.length } Lift[String](_.length)
Lift[Option[Int]].lift(_.filter) class Lift[T] {                                                          
   def apply[R](f: T => R): T => R = f

   def lift[A, R](f: (T) => (A) => R): (T, A) => R = 
         f(_)(_) 
   def lift[A1, A2, R](f: (T) => (A1, A2) => R): (T, A1, A2) => R =
         f(_)(_,_)
   // ... etc. ...
}
object Lift {
   def apply[T] = new Lift[T]
} Option.filter Lift[Option[Int]].lift[Int => Boolean, Option[Int]](_.filter) lift lift Option.filter

 Does anyone know how to handle this? It's not a very useful stack trace so I have no idea where it's happening. Should I just wrap any and all access to a remote source via http with a try/catch block? Or is there a better way? In general I don't care if this does happen or if some task does not get completed because of this. What I do care about is that the process should just shrug it off and work on the next task.

@CONTENT:I'm trying to figure out how to use JQuery to display some tools when the user is hovering over a content block. For example, the blocks are displayed as follows with the tools initially hidden: <div id="block_1">

<div id="block_2">
    <div class="tools" style="display:none;">Tools Here</div>

 I need it to show the tools for block_1 when the user is hovering over anything in block_1. I see that you can use wildcards to do something like: $("*[id^=block_]").hover(

    function () {

@TITLE:Memory Fences - Need help to understand
@CONTENT:I'm reading Memory Barriers by Paul E. McKenney http://www.rdrop.com/users/paulmck/scalability/paper/whymb.2010.07.23a.pdf everything is explained in great details and when I see that everything is clear I encounter one sentence, which stultifies everything and make me think that I understood nothing. Let me show the example void foo(void)
{
   a = 1; #1
   b = 1; #2
}

void bar(void)
{
   while (b == 0) continue; #3
   assert(a == 1); #4
}
 let's say this two functions are running on a different processors. Now what could possibly happen is store to a #1 could be seen after store to b #2 by the second processor, because first processor queues store to "a" and proceed to store b instruction. OK, that's fine, we add a write fence in the line between #1 and #2, but this code still can fail, because second processor might queue the invalidate message, so we add one more memory fence (read fence this time) in the line between #4 and #4. void foo(void)
{
   a = 1; #1
   write_memory_barrier();
   b = 1; #2
}

void bar(void)
{
   while (b == 0) continue; #3
   read_memory_barrier();
   assert(a == 1); #4
}
 this enforce second processor to process all queued messages (invalidate a) and read it again by sending read MESI message to first processor on #4. OK. Next the article says Many CPU architectures therefore provide weaker memory-barrier instructions that do only one or the other of these two. Roughly speaking, a ¡§read memory barrier¡¨ marks only the invalidate queue and a ¡§write memory barrier¡¨ marks only the store buffer. while a full-fledged memory barrier does both. Great, that's clear, but after that I see this The effect of this is that a read memory barrier orders only loads on the CPU that executes it, so that all loads preceding the read memory barrier will appear to have completed before any load following the read memory barrier. Similarly, a write memory barrier orders only stores, again on the CPU that executes it, and again so that all stores preceding the write memory barrier will appear to have completed before any store following the write memory barrier. so all loads preceding the read memory barrier will appear to have completed before any load following the read memory barrier that mixes up everything what was explained before. What does it mean? Which load in function "bar" have to complete before load of "a" #4? I understand the assert could fail without memory barrier in this function just because the processor may read an old value, because it still didn't manage to invalidate it's cache line, where object "a" is located. Explanation in details would be really helpful, I'm trying to understand it all the day. Thanks very much in advance.

@CONTENT:BACKGROUND: I now understand how to write a C# application that can monitor packets going in/out of the network card on the PC the application is running on. The approach I know relies on http://www.winpcap.org/ being already installed on the PC however, and then I use a C# wrapper such as http://pcapdotnet.codeplex.com/ or http://sourceforge.net/projects/sharppcap/ . QUESTION: My question however, what would I need to do to be able to have a C# application that can sniff packets that does NOT require a 3rd party application/drivers to be pre-installed? CLARIFICATION: That is I really want the application I currently have but without any requirement for me to tell the user to have to go and download/install XYZ prior to being able to use the application. For the purpose of the question assume that automating the download and install of a 3rd party application/drivers is not allowed either. (with WinPCap I'm not sure if you can bundle it, however I believe you're not supposed to in any case unfortunately) thanks

In this case, my Team View would be associated with a single Team ViewModel as well as any number of Player ViewModels (in the Team collection). Does having multiple ViewModels associated with a single View violate any design guidelines for MVVM , and is there a preferred way of implementing this scenario? Thanks!

@TITLE:What is the .call() function doing in this Javascript statement?
@CONTENT:I'm actively learning javascript, and I came across the following statement: Object.prototype.toString.call([]); 
 And I don't know what it means or what it does. I have a vague understanding of .call, in that it allows you to call a method in the context of a different object (I think), but I am having a hard time understanding what role the .call() function is playing in the above statement. So I was wondering if anyone could explain what .call() is doing here? Thanks!!

@TITLE:How to vectorize R strsplit?
@CONTENT:When creating functions that use strsplit, vector inputs do not behave as desired, and sapply needs to be used. This is due to the list output that strsplit produces. Is there a way to vectorize the process - that is, the function produces the correct element in the list for each of the elements of the input? For example, to count the lengths of words in a character vector: words <- c("a","quick","brown","fox")

> length(strsplit(words,""))
[1] 4 # The number of words (length of the list)

> length(strsplit(words,"")[[1]])
[1] 1 # The length of the first word only

> sapply(words,function (x) length(strsplit(x,"")[[1]]))
a quick brown   fox 
1     5     5     3 
# Success, but potentially very slow
 Ideally, something like length(strsplit(words,"")[[.]]) where . is interpreted as the being the relevant part of the input vector.
@CODE:strsplit sapply strsplit words <- c("a","quick","brown","fox")

    #We're done, now print the result
    for point in oldNearest:
        print point.station, point.english, point.distance

    return
 I initially wrote this in C, using the exact same approach, and it works fine there, and is basically instantaneous for nPoints<=100. So I decided to port it to python because I wanted to use SqlAlchemy to do some other stuff. I first ported it without the deepcopy statements that now pepper the method, and this caused the results to be 'odd', or partially incorrect, because some of the points were just getting copied as references(I guess? I think?) -- but it was still pretty nearly as fast as the C version. Now with the deepcopy calls added, the routine does it's job correctly, but it has incurred an extreme performance penalty, and now takes several seconds to do the same job. This seems like a pretty common job, but I'm clearly not doing it the pythonic way. How should I be doing this so that I still get the correct results but don't have to include deepcopy everywhere? EDIT: I've hit on a much simpler and faster solution, def compute_nearest_points2( lat, lon, nPoints=5 ):
    """Find the nearest N points, given the input coordinates."""

    points = session.query(PointIndex).all()
    nearest = []

    for point in points:
        distance = compute_spherical_law_of_cosines( lat, lon, point.avg_lat, point.avg_lon )
        nearest.append( 
            PointDistance(
                point.point, point.kana, point.english, point.avg_lat, point.avg_lon, distance=distance
                )
            )

    nearest_points = sorted(nearest, key=lambda point: point.distance)[:nPoints]     
    for item in nearest_points:
        print item.point, item.english, item.distance
    return
 So basically I'm just making a complete copy of the input and appending a new value - the distance from the reference point. Then I just apply 'sorted' to the resulting list, specifying that the sort key should be the distance property of the PointDistance object. This is much faster than using deepcopy although I confess I don't really understand why. I guess it is down to the efficient C implementations python's "sorted"?

@TITLE:Number of attempts to brute force an average password / non intrusive yet meaningful limits?
@CONTENT:There are several useful answers on SO regarding prevention of brute forcing a password of a web service by applying throttling. I couldn't find any good numbers though and I have little expertise in this area, so the question is: How many attempts does it usually take to brute-force an average password of 6 or more characters (with no additional knowledge that may help, but taking into account that passwords are probably prone to dictionary attacks) and based on that, what are meaningful limits to apply to the throttling algorithm without disrupting the user experience? This is my current scheme: The login form uses a nonce, so the attacker has to wait for a complete request cycle to complete to both get the result of the login attempt and retrieve a new token. I allow the login form to be retrieved 50 times per IP with less than a minute between requests, after that the IP will be blocked for 1 minute. Any new attempts within this one minute will restart the timeout. There's a sleep applied for each fetching of the login page of # of attempts / 5, so after 5 requests with less than a minute between requests it'll take > 1 second to fetch the form, after 10 requests > 2 seconds, etc. Additionally, I'm only allowing 100 failed login attempts per user account with 2 hours between attempts, after that the account is blocked for 2 hours. To avoid frequent DoS'ing of accounts, IPs can be whitelisted (no limits applied) or blacklisted (any login attempt ignored completely). Based on the answers so far, I have tweaked it to work like this: Retrieving the login form is progressively slowed down on a per IP basis. Each new request is slept for # of requests / 2 seconds. The counter is reset after 10 minutes of no login activity. I'm keeping a FIFO stack of login attempts for each IP. If an IP fails to log in 30 times within 2 hours, it's suspended. I'm also keeping a list of number of suspensions per IP, and the suspension time is calculated as 2 ^ (# of suspensions + 1) hours. This should lead to a rapid de facto blacklisting of continually offending IPs. Additionally, if an account failed to log in 20 times within one day it's being suspended for 2 hours. I'm not too sure about this measure yet, since this means accounts can be DoS'd quite easily. Short of a massive distributed botnet though, offending IPs should become de facto blacklisted faster than an account can be permanently DoS'd. It's also quite an effective measure to protect an account. I think these limits should not harm normal users, even ones that regularly forget their password and try to log in several times. The IP limits should also work okay with heavily NAT'ed users, given the average size of the service. Can somebody prove this to be efficient or inefficient with some solid math? :)

@TITLE:CSRF Protection in AJAX Requests using MVC2
@CONTENT:The page I'm building depends heavily on AJAX. Basically, there is just one "page" and every data transfer is handled via AJAX. Since overoptimistic caching on the browser side leads to strange problems (data not reloaded), I have to perform all requests (also reads) using POST - that forces a reload. Now I want to prevent the page against CSRF. With form submission, using Html.AntiForgeryToken() works neatly, but in AJAX-request, I guess I will have to append the token manually? Is there anything out-of-the box available? My current attempt looks like this: I'd love to reuse the existing magic. However, HtmlHelper.GetAntiForgeryTokenAndSetCookie is private and I don't want to hack around in MVC. The other option is to write an extension like public static string PlainAntiForgeryToken(this HtmlHelper helper)
{
    // extract the actual field value from the hidden input
    return helper.AntiForgeryToken().DoSomeHackyStringActions();
}
 which is somewhat hacky and leaves the bigger problem unsolved: How to verify that token? The default verification implementation is internal and hard-coded against using form fields. I tried to write a slightly modified ValidateAntiForgeryTokenAttribute, but it uses an AntiForgeryDataSerializer which is private and I really didn't want to copy that, too. At this point it seems to be easier to come up with a homegrown solution, but that is really duplicate code. Any suggestions how to do this the smart way? Am I missing something completely obvious?

I can do a Response.Redirect in the page_load event. I can write javascript that will update the location.href which will cause the postback. I'm sure there are more ways to skin this cat. My question is, what is the best practice for an ASP.NET site on IIS 6 or 7 to redirect an http page to https? Is there a best practice or are all alternatives equal?

@TITLE:How to prevent a globally overridden ¡§new¡¨ operator from being linked in from external library
@CONTENT:In our iPhone XCode 3.2.1 project, we're linking in 2 external static C++ libraries, libBlue.a and libGreen.a. libBlue.a globally overrides the "new" operator for it's own memory management. However, when we build our project, libGreen.a winds up using libBlue's new operator, which results in a crash (presumably because libBlue.a is making assumptions about the kinds of structures being allocated). Both libBlue.a and libGreen.a are provided by 3rd parties, so we can't change any of their source code or build options. When we remove libBlue.a from the project, libGreen.a doesn't have any issues. However, no amount of shuffling the linking order of the libraries seems to fix the problem, nor does any experimentation with the various linking flags. Is there some way to tell XCode to tell the linker to "have libGreen's use of the new operator use the standard C++ new operator rather than the one redefined by libBlue"?

@CONTENT:I'm interested in learning how to design/plan for web application development, in a multiple developer team scenario. Assuming the role of "Project Manager/Lead": What "documents" are needed for successful web application development? What UML diagrams are needed and to what degree? In the design/plan phase does each - as per use case - class need to be diagrammed? How detailed (depth and breadth) should the class diagrams be? If you have any helpful book/website recommendations, please share. Follow-up (Added 11/18/09): What do coders/developers use as a guide during coding i.e. creation of classes, and their respective methods & properties? If there isn't a complete (yet mutable) list of classes with their methods and properties, doesn't that ambiguity cause heavy reliance on each coders' knowledge/experience, resulting in deviations in code quality/usability/maintainability?

@TITLE:nearest neighbor - k-d tree - wikipedia proof
@CONTENT:On the wikipedia entry for k-d trees, an algorithm is presented for doing a nearest neighbor search on a k-d tree. What I don't understand is the explanation of step 3.2. How do you know there isn't a closer point just because the difference between the splitting coordinate of the search point and the current node is greater than the difference between the splitting coordinate of the search point and the current best? EDIT: Added text of Wikipedia article in question in case it is later changed on Wikipedia. Nearest neighbor search Animation of NN searching with a KD Tree in 2D The nearest neighbor (NN) algorithm aims to find the point in the tree which is nearest to a given input point. This search can be done efficiently by using the tree properties to quickly eliminate large portions of the search space. Searching for a nearest neighbor in a kd-tree proceeds as follows: Starting with the root node, the algorithm moves down the tree recursively, in the same way that it would if the search point were being inserted (i.e. it goes right or left depending on whether the point is greater or less than the current node in the split dimension). Once the algorithm reaches a leaf node, it saves that node point as the "current best" The algorithm unwinds the recursion of the tree, performing the following steps at each node: 1. If the current node is closer than the current best, then it becomes the current best. 2. The algorithm checks whether there could be any points on the other side of the splitting plane that are closer to the search point than the current best. In concept, this is done by intersecting the splitting hyperplane with a hypersphere around the search point that has a radius equal to the current nearest distance. Since the hyperplanes are all axis-aligned this is implemented as a simple comparison to see whether the difference between the splitting coordinate of the search point and current node is less than the distance (overall coordinates) from the search point to the current best. 1. If the hypersphere crosses the plane, there could be nearer points on the other side of the plane, so the algorithm must move down the other branch of the tree from the current node looking for closer points, following the same recursive process as the entire search. 2. If the hypersphere doesn't intersect the splitting plane, then the algorithm continues walking up the tree, and the entire branch on the other side of that node is eliminated. When the algorithm finishes this process for the root node, then the search is complete. Generally the algorithm uses squared distances for comparison to avoid computing square roots. Additionally, it can save computation by holding the squared current best distance in a variable for comparison.

@CONTENT:A program is compiled from some language to ASM --> Machine Code (directly executable). When people say that this is platform dependent, the mean that the binaries formed will run (correctly) only on the CPUs with same Instruction Set Architecture like x86, x86-64. It may (incorrectly) / may not (at all) run on other processes because of the difference in ISA. Right? Now, the concept of binaries is confusing me. Everything is about the "Machine Language Code" & "CPU". Where does the OS come into play? I mean the compiled binary has direct instructions for CPU when it is loaded into memory. & CPU executes one instruction at a time. I couldn't see the role of Operating System any where except in process management link text . It should be running on the CPU of same ISA irrespective of Operating System. right? But its not the case. If I build a code to x86 on windows machine. It won't run on Mac x86 machine or Linux x86 machine. I'm missing something here. Please clear my confusion.

@CONTENT:I've spent two days on this so far and combed through every source at my disposal, so this is the last resort. I have an X509 certificate whose public key I have stored in the iPhone's keychain (simulator only at this point). On the ASP.NET side, I've got the certificate in the cert store with a private key. When I encrypt a string on the iPhone and decrypt it on the server, I get a CryptographicException "Bad data." I tried the Array.Reverse suggested in the RSACryptoServiceProvider page on a longshot, but it did not help. I have compared the base-64 strings on both sides and they're equal. I've compared the raw byte arrays after decoding and they too are equal. If I encrypt on the server using the public key, the byte array is different from the iPhone's version and readily decrypts using the private key. The raw plaintext string is 115 characters so it's within the 256-byte limitation of my 2048-bit key. Here's the iPhone encryption method (pretty much verbatim from the CryptoExercise sample app's wrapSymmetricKey method): + (NSData *)encrypt:(NSString *)plainText usingKey:(SecKeyRef)key error:(NSError **)err

    OSStatus status = SecKeyEncrypt(key, kSecPaddingNone,

 My suspicion was that there was some encoding problems between the platforms. I know that one is big-endian and the other is little-endian but I don't know enough to say which is which or how to overcome the difference. Mac OS X, Windows, and the iPhone are all little-endian so that's not the problem. New theory: if you set the OAEP padding Boolean to false, it defaults to PKCS#1 1.5 padding. SecKey only has SecPadding definitions of PKCS1, PKCS1MD2, PKCS1MD5, and PKCS1SHA1. Perhaps Microsoft's PKCS#1 1.5 != Apple's PKCS1 and so the padding is affecting the binary output of the encryption. I tried using kSecPaddingPKCS1 with the fOAEP set to falseand it still didn't work. Apparently, kSecPaddingPKCS1 is equivalent to PKCS#1 1.5. Back to the drawing board on theories¡K Other newly-tried theories: Certificate on iPhone (.cer file) is not exactly the same as the PKCS#12 bundle on the server (.pfx file) and so it could never work. Installed .cer file in different cert store and server-encrypted string roundtripped just fine; Conversion to base-64 and act of POSTing to server resulted in oddness that wasn't present in same class roundtrip so I first tried some URLEncoding/Decoding and then posted raw binary from iPhone, verified that it was equal, and got same bad data; My original string was 125 bytes so I thought it might be truncating in UTF-8 (long shot) so I cropped it down to a 44-byte string with no result; Looked back over the System.Cryptography library to make sure I was using an appropriate class and discovered `RSAPKCS1KeyExchangeDeformatter`, became elated at new prospects, and dejected when it behaved exactly the same. Success! It turned out that I had some cruft in my Keychain on the iPhone Simulator that was muddying the waters, so to speak. I deleted the Keychain DB at ~/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/User/Library/Keychains/keychain-2-debug.db to cause it to be re-created and it worked fine. Thank you for all of your help. Figures it would have been something simple but non-obvious. (Two things I learned: 1) uninstalling the app from the simulator does not clear its Keychain entries and 2) start absolutely fresh periodically.) NOTE: The generic path for the keychain file is dependent on the iOS version: ~/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/[version]/Library/Keychains/keychain-2-debug.db e.g., ~/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/4.3/Library/Keychains/keychain-2-debug.db

The tableview is a UITableViewController but viewWillAppear never fires once the settings screen goes away. I've tried making the custom cell a property of the tableview so it can be accessed from the settings view, then called setNeedsDisplay and setNeedsLayout. Those didn't work either. Any suggestions?

@TITLE:history rows management in database
@CONTENT:As in many databases, i am designing a database that should keep record of previous versions of the rows changed in each table. The standard solution to this problem is to keep a history table for each data table, and whenever a row needs to be updated in the data table, a copy of the current row gets inserted to the history table and than the row in the data table gets updated. the disadvantages of this solution for me: maintenance of 2 tables instead of 1, (in case the structure of the table needs change) the application needs to know both of the tables instead of one names of the tables might need to be short to keep a convention of the table name and the history table name (SOME_TABLE, SOME_TABLE_HIST for example) I am considering a different solution and would like to know if it's ok. for each table, we add the column IS_LAST when a row gets inserted to the table, it will get inserted with IS_LAST=1. when a row gets updated, a copy of the original row will be duplicated to the same table with the change of IS_LAST=0, and the original row will get updated as needed (still keeping IS_LAST=1). assume that in my case, rows are updated at an average of 10 times. also assume that at least 90% of the actions performed by the application happens only on the recent version of the rows. my database is an Oracle 10g so to keep the "active" table slim, we can split the table to 2 partitions: the IS_LAST=1 partition, and the IS_LAST=0 partition. Is partitioning a good way of solving the history data keeping problem? Does this solution limits other partition potential to these tables? thanks!

@TITLE:Java Threadpool vs. new Thread in high request scenario
@CONTENT:I have some old java code for a REST service that uses a separate thread for every incoming request. I.e. the main loop would loop on socket.accept() and hand off the socket to a Runnable which then would start up its own background thread and invoke run on itself. This worked admiringly well for a while until recently i noticed that the lag of accept to processing the request would get unacceptable under high load. When i say admiringly well, i mean that it was handling 100-200 requests a second without significant CPU usage. The performance only degraded when other daemons were adding load as well and then only once load exceeded 5. When the machine was under high load (5-8) from a combination of other processes, the time from accept to processing would get ridiculously high (500ms to 3000ms) while the actual processing stayed sub-10ms. This is all on dual-core centos 5 systems. Having been used to Threadpools on .NET, i assumed that thread creation was the culprit and i thought i'd apply the same pattern in java. Now my Runnable is executed with ThreadPool.Executor (and the pool uses and ArrayBlockingQueue). Again, it works great under most scenarios unless the machine load gets high, then the time from creating the runnable until run() is invoked exhibits about the same ridiculous timing. But worse, the system load nearly doubled (10-16) with the threadpool logic in place. So now i get the same latency problems with double the load. My suspicion is that the lock contention of the queue is worse than the previous new thread start-up cost that had no locks. Can anyone share their experience of new thread vs. threadpool. And if my suspicion is correct, anyone have an alternative approach to dealing with a threadpool without lock contention? I'd be tempted to just make the whole system single-threaded since i don't know how much my threading helps and IO doesn't seem to be an issue, but I do get some requests that are long-lived that would then block everything. thanks, arne UPDATE: I switched over to Executors.newFixedThreadPool(100); and while it maintained the same processing capacity, load pretty much immediately doubled and running it for 12 hours showed load staying consistently at 2x. I guess in my case a new thread per request is cheaper.

@TITLE:Need Better Algorithm for Finding Mapping Between 2 Sets of Points with Minimum Distance
@CONTENT:Problem: I have two overlapping 2D shapes, A and B, each shape having the same number of pixels, but differing in shape. Some portion of the shapes are overlapping, and there are some pieces of each that are not overlapping. My goal is to move all the non-overlapping pixels in shape A to the non-overlapping pixels in shape B. Since the number of pixels in each shape is the same, I should be able to find a 1-to-1 mapping of pixels. The restriction is that I want to find the mapping that minimizes the total distance traveled by all the pixels that moved. Brute Force: The brute force approach to solving this problem is obviously out of the question, since I would have to compute the total distance of all possible mappings of which I think there are n! (where n is the number of non-overlapping pixels in one shape) times the computation of calculating a distance for each pair of points in the mapping, n, giving a total of O( n * n! ) or something similar. Backtracking: The only "better" solution I could think of was to use backtracking, where I would keep track of the current minimum so far and at any point when I'm evaluating a certain mapping, if I reach or exceed that minimum, I move on to the next mapping. Even this won't do any better than O( n! ). Is there any way to solve this problem with a reasonable complexity? Also note that the "obvious" approach of simply mapping a point to it's closest matching neighbour does not always yield the optimum solution. Simpler Approach?: As a secondary question, if a feasible solution doesn't exist, one possibility might be to partition each non-overlapping section into small regions, and map these regions, greatly reducing the number of mappings. To calculate the distance between two regions I would use the center of mass (average of the pixel locations in the region). However, this presents the problem of how I should go about doing the partitioning in order to get a near-optimal answer. Any ideas are appreciated!!

@TITLE:Finding the next in round-robin scheduling by bit twiddling
@CONTENT:Consider the following problem. You have a bit-string that represents the current scheduled slave in one-hot encoding. For example, "00000100" (with the leftmost bit being #7 and rightmost #0) means that slave #2 is scheduled. Now, I want to pick the next scheduled slave in a round-robin scheduling scheme, with a twist. I have a "request mask" which says which slaves actually want to be scheduled. The next slave will be picked only from those that want to. Some examples (assume round-robin scheduling is done by rotating left). Example1: Current: "00000100" Mask: "01100000" Next schedule: "00100000" - in normal round-robin, #3 and then #4 should come after #2, but they don't request, so #5 is picked. Example2: Current: "01000000" Mask: "00001010" Next: "00000010" - because scheduling is done by cycling left, and #1 is the first requesting slave in that order. Now, this can be easily coded in a loop, I know. But I actually want to get my result by a bit-twiddling operation, without loops. The motivation: I want to implement this in hardware (in an FPGA) in VHDL/Verilog. A bonus is to make up an algorithm that's generic for any amount of slaves N. By the way, this is not a homework question. It's an important problem whenever one wants to schedule slaves in some manner, and condition the scheduling by the slaves' requests. My current solution is somewhat "heavy" and I wanted to know if I'm missing something obvious.

@CONTENT:I've been watching Douglas Crockford's talks at YUI Theater, and I have a question about JavaScript inheritance... Douglas gives this example to show that "Hoozit" inherits from "Gizmo": function Hoozit(id) {
    this.id = id;
}
Hoozit.prototype = new Gizmo();
Hoozit.prototype.test = function (id) {
    return this.id === id;
};
 Why does he write Hoozit.prototype = new Gizmo() instead of Hoozit.prototype = Gizmo.prototype? Is there any difference between these two?
@CODE:function Hoozit(id) {
    this.id = id;
}
Hoozit.prototype = new Gizmo();
Hoozit.prototype.test = function (id) {
    return this.id === id;
}; Hoozit.prototype = new Gizmo() Hoozit.prototype = Gizmo.prototype

@LINK:/questions/372589/automated-exception-handling
@TITLE:Automated Exception Handling
@CONTENT:I was wondering if something exists (in Java world) able to take an snapshot of the JVM current state with the following features: Do it while an exception is being thrown. Capture local variables, method's arguments, etc. Put it in a handy file which can be used to extract or reproduce in a IDE the situation in your source code. The two first features are required (third would be awesome). And it must be suitable for production use (so, there is no way about debuggers). Before asking this I've searched through the WWW (as long as possible) and I found some pointers: Cajoon Interceptor: As said in Dzone post, it's a passive JVM agent which fulfill the three requirements! But, it has two downsides: you must pay for it and the site is down (maybe there is no chance to pay anything). AviCode Intercept Studio: Cajoon's .NET equivalent. Just to give some insight about. JavaFrame: Ok, it's a tweet, but it points to a available SVN repo which have the source code (under MIT license) of a JVM agent which looks fine (I'm going to give a try to it). So, maybe I'm looking for a non existent solution? It's not urgent, but I had this idea for a project and it would be great to explore this "unknown" (?) path and get something real. It seems to be clear that it would be a JVM agent (exception event from JVMTI, for example). At last, I would highlight the followin paragraph from Wikipedia's Exception Handling article: In runtime engine environments such as Java or .NET, there exist tools that attach to the runtime engine and every time that an exception of interest occurs, they record debugging information that existed in memory at the time the exception was thrown (call stack and heap values). These tools are called Automated Exception Handling or Error Interception tools and provide 'root-cause' information for exceptions. That's the idea. I hope somebody can give me some insight or maybe, in the future, somebody get inspired by this humble post :) Thanks!

@TITLE:Is there ANY way to suppress the browser's login prompt on 401 response when using XmlHttpRequest
@CONTENT:I am using jQuert .ajax function to call a page method. The site is using FormsAuthentication. So when an authentication ticket expires a call to the page method will obviously cause a redirect to the login page. Now, the geniuses that wrote the System.Web.Handlers.ScriptModule decided that if for some reason a REST style call to a page method or a web service method, from JavaScript causes a 302 Redirect, they're going to just simply turn the response into a 401 Unauthorized. This causes a browser to popup a login UI that is totally misleading, as the user tries to type in their username and password, which means nothing, because FormsAuthentication is used. Finally, when the user clicks Cancel, the 401 comes through to the error handler. So, the question is, how can one disable the browser's login UI prompt in any way? Some people on the web suggest to use a username and password in the XHR request, but it does not seem to work.

@TITLE:Wanted: good overview of .NET technologies
@CONTENT:I'm looking for a good overview of all the .NET Framework assemblies and their namespaces and how they (are supposed to) work together. The MSDN .NET Framework Reference has a seemingly complete list of all .NET Framework Class Libraries. Of course---being the MSDN after all---this list is at best rated "border line sufficient", describing each namespace with a sentence or two. Can you recommend a resource (book or website) to gain a broad understanding of the various bits that make up the .NET Framework? The specific question that triggered this question was "Where does System.Collections.ObjectModel come from, what else (besides ObservableCollection<>) does it contain and where is it used?" From there the obvious extension was "What else have I missed?" leading to this search for a broader understanding of the bits of the Framework. Prompted by a remark from Pop Catalin about "pocket books", I found Programming .NET 3.5 from O'Reilly, which looks interesting: [The authors] uncover the common threads that unite the .NET 3.5 technologies, so you can benefit from the best practices and architectural patterns baked into the new Microsoft frameworks. The book offers a "Grand Tour" of .NET 3.5 that describes how the principal technologies can be used together, with Ajax, to build modern n-tier and service-oriented applications. There is even a preview of the book on Safari, O'Reilly's online library. At 480 pages it probably fits only in the biggest of pockets, but then the framework is neither the slimmest piece of software on earth. Review I've ordered and read the book now. The book is focusing only on the new 3.5 stuff (WPF, WCF, CardSpaces, etc) and ignores everything else. Half of the book is WPF/XAML/Silverlight which I already knew. Additionally the authors often repeat source examples, once annotated and once as a "full listing" which is quite wasteful of the space in the book. Therefore I'm a bit disappointed by the book.

@CONTENT:I need a good understanding of the inner workings of System.Web.Routing. Usually we define the RoutesTable. But how does it do the routing? The reason I'm asking it is that I want to pass the routing to subapps. What I want to see working is a way of passing the current request to mvc apps that work in other AppDomains. Just to make it clear this is what I'm imagining I have a MVC APP that only has the barebone Global.asax and that loads in other app domains some dlls that are mvc apps.. and the comunication is done through a transparent proxy created through _appDomain.CreateInstanceAndUnwrap(...). Hope this is clear enough. Edit: from what I can tell the codebehind Default.aspx is invoked on the first page reguest and that starts the MvcHttpHandler that does all the voodoo of displaying the pages we are requesting. So it might just be a matter of passing the http context. If you have any ideas on matter please post your thoughts.

@TITLE:Data Layer Best Practices
@CONTENT:I am in the middle of a "discussion" with a colleague about the best way to implement the data layer in a new application. One viewpoint is that the data layer should be aware of business objects (our own classes that represent an entity), and be able to work with that object natively. The opposing viewpoint is that the data layer should be object-agnostic, and purely handle simple data types (strings, bools, dates, etc.) I can see that both approaches may be valid, but my own viewpoint is that I prefer the former. That way, if the data storage medium changes, the business layer doesn't (necessarily) have to change to accommodate the new data layer. It would therefore be a trivial thing to change from a SQL data store to a serialized xml filesystem store. My colleague's point of view is that the data layer shouldn't have to know about object definitions, and that as long as the data is passed about appropriately, that is enough. Now, I know that this is one of those questions that has the potential to start a religious war, but I'd appreciate any feedback from the community on how you approach such things. TIA

When I run the decrypt, sometimes it works and other times it doesn't. When it fails I generally get a "Error while finalizing cipher, pad block corrupted" error.

        cos.write(d, 0, b);
    }

}

 Currently the Salt and Password are static and do not change for testing purposes. Still get errors about half the time. Does anyone have any ideas on why this happens?

I think I am just missing something simple... Update! People were right when it was the salt. When I removed the salt, the problem was solved... Did a little more digging, turns out salt+Pass was the issues, but because the salt was a byte[] and Pass was a string. I changed salt to String and then used salt.concat(Pass) and the problem was solved!

@TITLE:How to implement customized stack view in android?
@CONTENT:I have searched the internet but I couldn't find some good explanation or advice. Basically, I want to implement this functionality. on slide down I used the StackView class and all I get is this "diagonal" stack I want views to be one behind another, as in the pictures above. Similar question is asked here -> Android customize stackview, but I couldn't find any satisfying answers. I have read the code for StackView as suggested, but honestly, I don't know how would I customize it to get what I want. When I change the value of PERSPECTIVE_SHIFT_FACTOR_X or PERSPECTIVE_SHIFT_FACTOR_Y nothing changes and I get the same "diagonal view". Am I missing something? Thanks in advance for the answers.

@TITLE:Posgresql gem for rails wont install, even when both home brew and app are installed
@CONTENT:I have tried following this answer to get the gem to work, but it wont. I have my projects set up such that individuals projects have there own gems instead of all themes gems living in global space, and then I use binstubs to allow me to do things like bin/rails. So all gems are installed to .bundle/gems/ for each project. the one that always gives me the toughest problems is posgresql. Lets go through the steps. So I run: bundle It explodes stating: Gem::Installer::ExtensionBuildError: ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.

An error occurred while installing pg (0.18.1), and Bundler cannot continue.
Make sure that `gem install pg -v '0.18.1'` succeeds before bundling.
 So then, because I have the home brew version installed at 9.4.0 and the posgresql.app installed I then did: bundle config build.pg --with-pg-config=/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/9.3/bin/pg_config
 Followed by, because I use 18.1 gem install pg -v '0.18.1'
 And I got: Building native extensions.  This could take a while...

 From there I tried bundle Well we are back to square one because even though the gem installed - I get the EXACT same error. Is this because I am installing the pg gem globally and not locally? How can I fix this? This one project, every time I have to do a rm -rf .bundle/gems Causes this exact issue over and over again. I should point out I get the same error even if I use the home brew psql pg_config Do all the steps above, just with home brew version, same results.

@TITLE:ViewPager Fragments ¡V Shared Element Transitions
@CONTENT:An app I'm developing displays a grid of images. When you tap an image, it goes into the details view. The details view contains a ViewPager that allows you swipe between every image in the grid. This is done by passing a lists of paths (containing every image in the grid), along with an offset of the image that was tapped so the ViewPager can be set to show that page initially. What's the best way to have a shared element transition inside the Fragment of the current offset page in the ViewPager? The grid (RecyclerView) image should expand into the full screen image in the current page. I saw the ability to postpone and resume activity transitions, so the app would wait to display the shared element transition until the image is loaded from the disk. But I want to be able to make it animate to the correct page in the view pager, and also exit to whatever the current page is when the user goes back (since you can swipe between pages). If you swipe to a different page now, the initial page is what animates back into the grid. Currently, I assign every image in the Fragments of the view pager with a transitionName in the format "image_[index]". When I start the details activity, I use the same transitionName with the index being the offset. Related to this, I was also wondering how to make ripples work with long presses. When you change a view's activated state, it seems to cancel the ripple. I want an effect similar to Gmail, where the ripple starts over again and quickly finishes after a long press is complete and triggers the activated state.

@TITLE:iOS 8 web app screen shrinks after loading camera app
@CONTENT:I am in the process a building a web app and ran into a problem with iOS 8. Please note this is specific to iOS 8 as it works fine in previous versions. I have a page that uploads images taken directly from the phone or tablet. I use the following link to call the camera app: <input type="file" accept="image/*" capture="camera" name="files[]">
 The camera app opens as expected and takes the picture with no problem. However when the camera app closes and returns to the web app the screen height is reduced by more then half. There is no way to correct expect for closing and restarting the app. You can see how it looks after taking the picture here: Screencast It appears as if the screen remains in landscape. However rotating the device only makes it worse. I am assuming this is an iOS 8 bug but wondering if anyone has any ideas on how to correct or work around the issue. One last note, the issue only occurs when running as a web app. When using safari it works. FYI - here are the meta tags I am using:         <!-- Run in full-screen mode. -->

@TITLE:nginx and php-fpm socket owner
@CONTENT:After an update of my system I ran into a bad gateway error of my PHP apps running on Nginx. *1 connect() to unix:/var/run/php-fcgi-vhostname-php-fcgi-0.sock failed (13: Permission denied) while connecting to upstream, client: xx.xxx.xx.xx, server: localhost, request: "GET / HTTP/1.1", upstream: "fastcgi://unix:/var/run/php-fcgi-vhostname-php-fcgi-0.sock:", host: "xx.xx.xx.xx"
 The problem is caused by bad permissions of the php-fpm sockets used, in fact I see /var/run/php-fcgi.sock owned by root:root but nginx and php-fpm use as user www-data. I've already edited the php-fpm config at /etc/php-fpm.d/www.conf with: listen.owner = www-data
listen.group = www-data
listen.mode = 0660
 but it doesn't solve the problem and when i restart nginx and php-fpm the sockets are created with root:root as user/group. The only way I've found to fix it is to change the owner of the sockets to www-data:www-data manually. But this is not a real solution because everytime I restart my services I've to apply it again. How can I fix this problem? I'm on CentOS 6.5 Edit: I use Ajenti-V to configure my vhosts and my PHP-FPM. It creates a new socket for each website/vhost, and them are set in /etc/php-fpm.conf They have this structure: [vhostname-php-fcgi-0]
user = www-data
group = www-data

listen = /var/run/php-fcgi-vhostname-php-fcgi-0.sock

pm = dynamic
pm.max_children = 5
pm.start_servers = 1
pm.min_spare_servers = 1
pm.max_spare_servers = 5
 If I add to each entry these strings: listen.owner = www-data
listen.group = www-data
listen.mode = 0666
 Everything works correctly. So looks like the www.conf is not included (maybe?). This is my php-fpm.conf: [global]

error_log = /var/log/php5-fpm.log

@LINK:/questions/23339150/azure-federations-are-deprecated-what-are-my-options
@TITLE:Azure Federations are Deprecated. What are my options?
@CONTENT:The background: We have an application where the main entity is a customer. All information in this applications starts from the customer. We thought it would be really nice if we can use this for some kind of partitioning. We designed the service with Azure SQL Database as a backend. Our tables look like this (only the relevant part is left for brevity): TABLE dbo.Orders
(
     CustomerId INT NOT NULL DEFAULT( FEDERATION_FILTERING_VALUE( 'FEDERATION_BY_CUSTOMER' ) ),
     OrderId INT NOT NULL,
     ....,
     CONSTRAINT PK_Orders PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED ( CustomerId, OrderId )
) FEDERATED ON ( FEDERATION_BY_CUSTOMER = CustomerId );
 Now this allowed us to do some crazy things. Our entry points to all SQL related stuff always contains the following command first: USE FEDERATION GroupFederation( FEDERATION_BY_CUSTOMER = 1 ) WITH RESET, FILTERING = ON
 In this case this statement: SELECT * FROM Orders
 or INSERT INTO Orders ( OrderId ) VALUES ( 10 );
 will work without a problem, working only on the data of the given customer. The CustomerId COLUMN will always be inferred from the system function FEDERATION_FILTERING_VALUE; Now we could have all our customer in a single database without a problem, and they would be isolated from each other. If sometime in the future, one of them got too big, we could SPLIT the federation at that particular customer ID and we don't have to change anything in our code to support it. Heck, we could have each customer in separated federation database and the service using it wouldn't know a single thing about it. We were very happy with our solution and I thought I was very clever coming up with it. Not until recently when Microsoft announced that they are deprecating the azure federations feature with the new azure database editions that are coming up. Read more about it here and here. I hope you see my problem. What do you think my alternatives are? Do you use Azure Federations and how are you going to transition? Thank you.

@TITLE:ICommandHandler/IQueryHandler with async/await
@CONTENT:EDITH says (tl;dr) I went with a variant of the suggested solution; keeping all ICommandHandlers and IQueryHandlers potentially aynchronous and returning a resolved task in synchronous cases. Still, I don't want to use Task.FromResult(...) all over the place so I defined an extension method for convenience: public static class TaskExtensions
{
    public static Task<TResult> AsTaskResult<TResult>(this TResult result)
    {
        // Or TaskEx.FromResult if you're targeting .NET4.0 
        // with the Microsoft.BCL.Async package
        return Task.FromResult(result); 
    }
}

// Usage in code ...
using TaskExtensions;
class MySynchronousQueryHandler : IQueryHandler<MyQuery, bool>
{
    public Task<bool> Handle(MyQuery query)
    {
        return true.AsTaskResult();
    }
}

class MyAsynchronousQueryHandler : IQueryHandler<MyQuery, bool>
{
    public async Task<bool> Handle(MyQuery query)
    {
        return await this.callAWebserviceToReturnTheResult();
    }
}
 It's a pity that C# isn't Haskell ... yet 8-). Really smells like an application of Arrows. Anyway, hope this helps anyone. Now to my original question :-) Introduction Hello there! For a project I'm currently designing an application architecture in C# (.NET4.5, C#5.0, ASP.NET MVC4). With this question I hope to get some opinions about some issues I stumbled upon trying to incorporate async/await. Note: this is quite a lengthy one :-) My solution structure looks like this: MyCompany.Contract (Commands/Queries and common interfaces) MyCompany.MyProject (Contains the business logic and command/query handlers) MyCompany.MyProject.Web (The MVC web frontend) I read up on maintainable architecture and Command-Query-Separation and found these posts very helpful: Meanwhile on the query side of my architecture Meanwhile on the command side of my architecture Writing highly maintainable WCF services So far I've got my head around the ICommandHandler/IQueryHandler concepts and dependency injection (I'm using SimpleInjector - it's really dead simple). The Given Approach The approach of the articles above suggests using POCOs as commands/queries and describes dispatchers of these as implementations of the following handler interfaces: interface IQueryHandler<TQuery, TResult>
{
    TResult Handle(TQuery query);
}

interface ICommandHandler<TCommand>
{
    void Handle(TCommand command);
}
 In a MVC Controller you'd use this as follows: class AuthenticateCommand
{
    // The token to use for authentication
    public string Token { get; set; }
    public string SomeResultingSessionId { get; set; }
}

class AuthenticateController : Controller
{
    private readonly ICommandHandler<AuthenticateCommand> authenticateUser;

    public AuthenticateController(ICommandHandler<AuthenticateCommand> authenticateUser) 
    {
        // Injected via DI container
        this.authenticateUser = authenticateUser;
    }

    public ActionResult Index(string externalToken)
    {
        var command = new AuthenticateCommand 
        { 
            Token = externalToken 
        };
        this.authenticateUser.Handle(command);

        var sessionId = command.SomeResultingSessionId;
        // Do some fancy thing with our new found knowledge
    }
}
 Some of my observations concerning this approach: In pure CQS only queries should return values while commands should be, well only commands. In reality it is more convenient for commands to return values instead of issuing the command and later doing a query for the thing the command should have returned in the first place (e.g. database ids or the like). That's why the author suggested putting a return value into the command POCO. It is not very obvious what is returned from a command, in fact it looks like the command is a fire and forget type of thing until you eventually encounter the weird result property being accessed after the handler has run plus the command now knows about it's result The handlers have to be synchronous for this to work - queries as well as commands. As it turns out with C#5.0 you can inject async/await powered handlers with the help of your favorite DI container, but the compiler doesn't know about that at compile time so the MVC handler will fail miserably with an exception telling you that the method returned before all asynchronous tasks finished executing. Of course you can mark the MVC handler as async and this is what this question is about. Commands Returning Values I thought about the given approach and made changes to the interfaces to address issues 1. and 2. in that I added an ICommandHandler that has an explicit result type - just like the IQueryHandler. This still violates CQS but at least it is plain obvious that these commands return some sort of value with the additional benefit of not having to clutter the command object with a result property: interface ICommandHandler<TCommand, TResult>
{
    TResult Handle(TCommand command);
}
 Naturally one could argue that when you have the same interface for commands and queries why bother? But I think it's worth naming them differently - just looks cleaner to my eyes. My Preliminary Solution Then I thought hard of the 3rd issue at hand ... some of my command/query handlers need to be asynchronous (e.g. issuing a WebRequest to another web service for authentication) others don't. So I figured it would be best to design my handlers from the ground up for async/await - which of course bubbles up to the MVC handlers even for handlers that are in fact synchronous: interface IQueryHandler<TQuery, TResult>
{
    Task<TResult> Handle(TQuery query);
}

interface ICommandHandler<TCommand>
{
    Task Handle(TCommand command);
}

interface ICommandHandler<TCommand, TResult>
{
    Task<TResult> Handle(TCommand command);
}

class AuthenticateCommand
{
    // The token to use for authentication
    public string Token { get; set; }

    // No more return properties ...
}
 AuthenticateController: class AuthenticateController : Controller
{
    private readonly ICommandHandler<AuthenticateCommand, string> authenticateUser;

    public AuthenticateController(ICommandHandler<AuthenticateCommand, 
        string> authenticateUser) 
    {
        // Injected via DI container
        this.authenticateUser = authenticateUser;
    }

    public async Task<ActionResult> Index(string externalToken)
    {
        var command = new AuthenticateCommand 
        { 
            Token = externalToken 
        };
        // It's pretty obvious that the command handler returns something
        var sessionId = await this.authenticateUser.Handle(command);

        // Do some fancy thing with our new found knowledge
    }
}
 Although this solves my problems - obvious return values, all handlers can be async - it hurts my brain to put async on a thingy that isn't async just because. There are several drawbacks I see with this: The handler interfaces are not as neat as I wanted them to be - the Task<...> thingys to my eyes are very verbose and at first sight obfuscate the fact that I only want to return something from a query/command The compiler warns you about not having an appropriate await within synchronous handler implementations (I want to be able to compile my Release with Warnings as Errors) - you can overwrite this with a pragma ... yeah ... well ... I could omit the async keyword in these cases to make the compiler happy but in order to implement the handler interface you would have to return some sort of Task explicitly - that's pretty ugly I could supply synchronous and asynchronous versions of the handler interfaces (or put all of them in one interface bloating the implementation) but my understanding is that, ideally, the consumer of a handler shouldn't be aware of the fact that a command/query handler is sync or async as this is a cross cutting concern. What if I need to make a formerly synchronous command async? I'd have to change every consumer of the handler potentially breaking semantics on my way through the code. On the other hand the potentially-async-handlers-approach would even give me the ability to change sync handlers to be async by decorating them with the help of my DI container Right now I don't see a best solution to this ... I'm at a loss. Anyone having a similar problem and an elegant solution I didn't think of?

        function checkConnection() {
            var networkState = Connection.CELL;
            alert("2"); // doesn't run this

@TITLE:Mybatis Generator: What's the best way to separate out ¡§auto generated¡¨ and ¡§hand edited files¡¨
@CONTENT:I am on a project that uses both Mybatis (for persisting java to database) and Mybatis Generator (to automatically generate the mapper xml files and java interfaces from a database schema). Mybatis generator does a good job at generating the files necessary for basic crud operation. Context For some of the tables/classes, we will need more "stuff" (code queries, etc) than the "crud stuff" generated by the MyBatis Generator tool. Is there any way to have "best of both worlds", i.e use auto generation as as well as "custom code". How do you separate out and structure the "hand edited files" and "automatically generated files". Proposal I was thinking about the following, i.e. for table "Foo" Auto-Generated FooCrudMapper.xml interface FooCrud.java (where "Crud" stands for "Create Read Update Delete") Hand Edited FooMapper.xml interface Foo extends FooCrud The notion: if the schema changed, you could always safely autogenerate the "Crud" xml and .java files without wiping out any of the custom changes. Questions Would mybatis correctly handle this scenario, i.e. would this mapper correctly execute the auto-generated 'crud code'? FooMapper fooMapper = sqlSession.getMapper(FooMapper.class); What approach do you recommend? Edit 1: * Our db design uses a 'core table' ("element") with other tables 'extending' that table and adding extra attributes (shared key) . I've looked at docs and source concluded that I cannot use Mybatis Generator in conjunction with such 'extension' without any hand editing: i.e. This does not work. -ElementMapper extends "ElementCrudMapper" -FooMapper.xml extends both "ElementCrudMapper" and "FooCrudMapper" thanks all!

@TITLE:Efficient 4x4 matrix multiplication (C vs assembly)
@CONTENT:I'm looking for a faster and trickier way to multiply two 4x4 matrices in C. My current research is focused on x86-64 assembly with SIMD extensions. So far, I've created a function witch is about 6x faster than a naive C implementation, which has exceeded my expectations for the performance improvement. Unfortunately, this stays true only when no optimization flags are used for compilation (GCC 4.7). With -O2, C becomes faster and my effort becomes meaningless. I know that modern compilers make use of complex optimization techniques to achieve an almost perfect code, usually faster than an ingenious piece of hand-crafed assembly. But in a minority of performance-critical cases, a human may try to fight for clock cycles with the compiler. Especially, when some mathematics backed with a modern ISA can be explored (as it is in my case). My function looks as follows (AT&T syntax, GNU Assembler):     .text

 It calculates a whole column of the resultant matrix per iteration, by processing four floats packed in 128-bit SSE registers. The full vectorisation is possible with a bit of math (operation reordering and aggregation) and mullps/addps instructions for parallel multiplication/addition of 4xfloat packages. The code reuses registers meant for passing parameters (%rdi, %rsi, %rdx : GNU/Linux ABI), benefits from (inner) loop unrolling and holds one matrix entirely in XMM registers to reduce memory reads. A you can see, I have researched the topic and took my time to implement it the best I can. The naive C calculation conquering my code looks like this: void matrixMultiplyNormal(mat4_t *mat_a, mat4_t *mat_b, mat4_t *mat_r) {
    for (unsigned int i = 0; i < 16; i += 4)
        for (unsigned int j = 0; j < 4; ++j)
            mat_r->m[i + j] = (mat_b->m[i + 0] * mat_a->m[j +  0])
                            + (mat_b->m[i + 1] * mat_a->m[j +  4])
                            + (mat_b->m[i + 2] * mat_a->m[j +  8])
                            + (mat_b->m[i + 3] * mat_a->m[j + 12]);
}
 I have investigated the optimised assembly output of the above's C code which, while storing floats in XMM registers, does not involve any parallel operations ¡V just scalar calculations, pointer arithmetic and conditional jumps. The compiler's code seems to be less deliberate, but it is still slightly more effective than my vectorised version expected to be about 4x faster. I'm sure that the general idea is correct ¡V programmers do similar things with rewarding results. But what is wrong here? Are there any register allocation or instruction scheduling issues I am not aware of? Do you know any x86-64 assembly tools or tricks to support my battle against the machine?

@TITLE:In Django, how do I set user field in form to the currently logged in user?
@CONTENT:Django and stackoverflow noob here. I'm making an election information app, and I want to allow the currently logged-in user to be able to declare himself and only himself as a candidate in an election. I'm using Django's built-in ModelForm and CreateView. My problem is that the Run for Office form (in other words, the 'create candidate' form) allows the user to select any user in the database to make a candidate. I want the user field in the Run for Office to be automatically set to the currently logged-in user, and for this value to be hidden, so the logged-in user cannot change the value of the field to someone else. views.py class CandidateCreateView(CreateView):
    model = Candidate
    form_class = CandidateForm
    template_name = 'candidate_create.html'

    def form_valid(self, form):
        f = form.save(commit=False)
        f.save()
        return super(CandidateCreateView, self).form_valid(form)
 forms.py class CandidateForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Candidate
 models.py class Candidate(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(UserProfile)
    office = models.ForeignKey(Office)
    election = models.ForeignKey(Election)
    description = models.TextField()

    def __unicode__(self):
        return unicode(self.user)

    def get_absolute_url(self):
        return reverse('candidate_detail', kwargs={'pk': str(self.id)})
 Thanks for reading. I've been stuck on this problem a couple days now, and would really appreciate your help. If you need more info, please lemme know.

@TITLE:Integration Test of REST APIs with Code Coverage
@CONTENT:We have built a REST API that exposes bunch of business services - a business service may invoke other platform/utility services to perform database read and writes, to perform service authorization etc. We have deployed these services as WAR files in Tomcat. We want to test this whole setup using a integration test suite which we would like to also treat as regression test suite. What would be a good approach to perform integration testing on this and any tools that can speed up the development of suite? Here are few requirements we think we need to address: Ability to define integration test cases which exercise business scenarios. Set up the DB with test data before suite is run. Invoke the REST API that is running on a remote server (Tomcat) Validate the DB post test execution for verifying expected output Have code coverage report of REST API so that we know how confident we should be in the scenarios covered by the suite.

@TITLE:NullReferenceException from PresentationFramework.dll
@CONTENT:I'm fighting with a strange NullReferenceException that is apparently fired from the GetNameCore() function of the ItemAutomationPeer class. The details of the exception are below but the really intriguing aspect is that it doesn't occur on my development machine running Windows 7, or other Windows 7 computers we have tested with. It only happens on my Windows 8 Pro test machine. The exception is thrown apparently when attempting to edit a cell in a WPF DataGrid control. I've been trying to track it down all day without success. I tried debugging the process remotely using Visual Studio and stepping through the code but none of the user code seems to be triggering the exception. It's obviously executed by a sequence of events inside of the PresentationFramework.Dll and the exception just bubbles up through the AppDomain and eventually crashes the application. If anybody can think of anything that might be causing this, or a way to fix it it would really help. Exception Type:         System.NullReferenceException
Exception Message:  Object reference not set to an instance of an object.

@CONTENT:I recently started to develop a pretty huge site. On the site i would like to allow users to upload their sample works. We are pretty limited at the moment so the images will be stored on our server. I am a bit stuck with the logic. So my logic would be this. User creates a folder with a name that is stored in the database with the users id attached to it folder table Rows id | folder        | user_id 
1  | Some folder   | 1
2  | New folder    | 4
3  | Nother folder | 7
 Images table Rows id | image_name        | folder_id |

2  | image2.jpg        | 1
3  | image3.jpg        | 1
4  | image4.jpg        | 2
5  | image5.jpg        | 2

 Relations class Folder extends Eloquent 
{
    public function images()
    {
        return static::has_many('Images');
    }
}

class Image extends Eloquent 
{
    public function folder()
    {
        return static::belongs_to('Folder');
    }
}
 folder structure on server - samples
  -user_id
   - folder_id
     - image1
     - image2
     - image3
 so as you can see, user creates a folder, after the folder is created, user uploades the image name in to the database with the folders id, and showing the images would be the way describe above with the realation. So my questions. Is this a good logic in your opinion can this lead problems in the future what woud you offer for this functionality And what i am most sacred of are 2 things. I think this will lead to a huge database, second are the id's, after x time when there will be more users, the id's will increase, and i know this will sound strange, but since lot of users will upload images will lead to huge id's, what i mean by this it will maybe reach millions, is there a way to solve this problem? Thank you for the help

}
 but i felt its not suited to implement all the classes with DBConnection Class. My question : What sort of design pattern is suited to overcome this problem?

@CONTENT:Hoping someone might be able to help me with something I am experimenting with in MVC 4 using bootstrap. I have a strongly-typed index view which displays items in a table along with edit and delete action icons in each line. @model IEnumerable<Models.EquipmentClass>

            </a>
        </td>
    </tr>

} <!-- foreach -->
 The EquipmentClass controller returns the Edit view for the selected item based on the id. All great and as expected at this point public ViewResult Edit(int id)
{
    return View(equipmentclassRepository.Find(id));
}
 What I would like to know is how to open the edit form in a bootstrap modal dialog. I could try and substitute the edit action in the table with the following and then have a modal div at the bottom of the view but how do I pass in the ID of the selected item and which html helper should I use in the modal section? <!-- replaced table action -->
<a class="btn pull-right" data-toggle="modal" href="#myModal" >Details</a>

....

<!-- modal div -->
<div class="modal hide fade in" id="myModal" )>
    <div class="modal-header">
        <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal">¡Ñ</button>
        <h3>Modal header</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="modal-body">
        @Html.Partial("Edit")
    </div>
    <div class="modal-footer">
        <a href="#" class="btn" data-dismiss="modal">Close</a>

@TITLE:Android, Blur Bitmap instantly?
@CONTENT:So I'm trying to blur an image as fast as possible(instant feel like), as the activity needs to be updated as I press the Blur button. The problem I am having is that, I cannot find a Blur that works quick enough... Note: The blur, preferably a Gaussian blur, doesn't need to be the best quality at all.. I tried out the following, but it takes a few seconds, is there anyway this code could be made to run quicker in sacrifice of quality ? Or are there any other alternatives? I would look into GPU stuff, but this blur is really just an effect related to the UI and only happens when I press open a transparent activity sized as a small box... Any Ideas? static Bitmap fastblur(Bitmap sentBitmap, int radius, int fromX, int fromY,
    int width, int height) {

All well described here. The question: Why bother with 3-legs, when 2-legs seems to be fine? It's more work both for the provider and the client. Why didn't one of the big player make a move and removed 3-leg?

@TITLE:Add version control to existing SQL Server database [closed]
@CONTENT:I am part of a development team currently working with a database that does not have any kind of source control. We work with SQL Server 2008 R2 and have always managed the DB directly with SSMS. It now has ~340 tables and ~1600 stored procedures, plus a few triggers and views, so it is not a small DB. My goal is to have the DB under version control, so I have been reading articles, like Scott Allen's series and many old SO related questions. But I am still unable to decide on how to proceed. What I'm thinking of is to script the database schema in one file, then procedures, triggers and views in one file each. Then keep everything versioned under Mercurial. But of course, every member of the team can access SSMS and directly change the schema and procedures, with the possibility that any of us can forget to replicate those changes in the versioned files. What better options are there? And, did I forget any element worth having source control of? My biggest concern is that most of the literature I found explains how to do version control when creating a new database, but not when it is already old and relatively big.

@TITLE:Hibernate + MySQL: How to set the encoding utf-8 for database and tables
@CONTENT:My system runs on Linux Mandriva, RDBMS - MySQL 5. I need to have the database and tables created in UTF-8. Here is a fragment of hibernate.cfg.xml - ... 
 <property name="hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto">create-drop</property>   
 <property name="hibernate.dialect">org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect</property>
 <property name="hibernate.connection.characterEncoding">utf8</property> 
...

[mysqld]

collation-server=cp1251_general_ci
init-connect="SET NAMES cp1251"
skip-character-set-client-handshake
...
[mysqldump]
...    
default-character-set=cp1251
...
 Some class, for example - @Entity
@Table(name = "USER")
public class User {
    @Id 
    @Column(name = "USERID")
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
    private Integer id;

    @Column(name = "USERNAME")
    private String name;

    @Column(name = "USERPASSWORD")
    private String password;

    @Column(name = "USERIP")
    private String ip;
        // getter's and setter's here
        ...
 But when the tables are generated, I see the encoding latin1 For example- SHOW CREATE TABLE USER;

USER  | CREATE TABLE `user` (
  `USERID` int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
  `USERIP` varchar(255) default NULL,
  `USERNAME` varchar(255) default NULL,
  `USERPASSWORD` varchar(255) default NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY  (`USERID`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1 |
 How to change the encoding to UTF-8? I would be most grateful for the information! Thank you! ... This is strange, I have changed all to utf8 - # The MySQL server
    [mysqld]
    ...
    default-character-set=utf8
    character-set-server=utf8
    collation-server=utf8_general_ci
    init-connect="SET NAMES utf8"
    skip-character-set-client-handshake
    ...
    [mysqldump]
    ...    
    default-character-set=utf8
    ...
 And now - SHOW CREATE TABLE USER;

USER  | CREATE TABLE `USER` (
  `USERID` int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,

@TITLE:Typesetting a font in small caps on iOS
@CONTENT:On iOS, I load a custom font in my project by adding its file name (an .otf file) to the info.plist file and then using this line of code: UIFont myFont * = [UIFont fontWithName:titleFontName size:titleFontSize]; I obtain the font that I can use in UILabels and UITextViews. How could I obtain that this font is displayed only in small caps? If I use it in Photoshop, it's possible to turn on the small caps switch to have all words typeset in small caps (and so, I conclude that there is nothing missing with the font). How could I obtain a similar effect on iOS? Converting my strings to uppercase is not a viable option for other reasons. Further information : the font has only one member in its family, as I could understand by using the following code, there is no standalone small caps member in the family.  for (NSString * familyName in [UIFont familyNames])
   {
        NSLog(@"---------------- %@ ---------------", familyName);

@CONTENT:I upgraded to version 4.2 and found that my old code did not compile because it appears the ForceOverflow parent theme has been removed. After Googling this issue it appears that the it was deliberately removed to maintain device consistent menu buttons. I do understand the argument for using the physical menu button, but I just don't agree with it... plus it is so damn ugly those old menus. I really don't want users saying they cannot access previous functionality (which after all is the reason the menus buttons were moved to be visible on screen), so what are my options here? Will this be changed in a future release? Do I have to stick with a previous version of ABS and deal with some other bugs in the old ABS libs which were fixed in recent versions? Is there any work around?

@TITLE:Core Data memory usage and Memory Warning
@CONTENT:I have this issue. I have a database of images in Core Data. I fetch all images (about 80MB) and put in an NSMutableArray. The objects are correctly faulted: NSArray *fetchResults = [self.managedObjectContext executeFetchRequest:request error:&error];
self.cache = [NSMutableArray arrayWithArray:fetchResults];

 Reading the log, I see that the objects are all correctly faulted However, using Instruments, I see that 80MB of memory are used. I think this is why Core Data caches it's results, and should free the memory when it's needed. But (and this is my "problem"), if I simulate a memory warning, nothing happens! The 80MB remains there. Looking at instruments - allocations, the 80MB are used by many Malloc: (example) Graph Category Live Bytes # Living # Transitory Overall Bytes # Overall # Allocations (Net / Overall) 0 Malloc 176,00 KB 8,59 MB 50 57 18,39 MB 107 %0.00, %0.00 0 Malloc 200,00 KB 8,20 MB 42 460 98,05 MB 502 %0.00, %0.04 0 Malloc 168,00 KB 7,05 MB 43 19 10,17 MB 62 %0.00, %0.00 This is a link to an image of the entire Call Tree: https://www.dropbox.com/s/du1b5a5wooif4w7/Call%20Tree.png Any ideas?

When I'm ready to push my changes commit them in git. What I'm not sure about is the following: How to push my changes out to the live server? What if I accidentally delete my local copy? What about my database? If I add new tables and data on my local machine will I need to manually make these changes on my live server too? EDIT Yes, sorry, not enough detail.

@CONTENT:I'm writing an Android app in OpenCV to detect blobs. One task is to threshold the image to differentiate the foreground objects from the background (see image). It works fine as long as the image is known and I can manually pass a threshold value to threshold()--in this particular image say, 200. But assuming that the image is not known with the only knowledge that there would be a dark solid background and lighter foreground objects how can I dynamically figure out the threshold value? I've come across the histogram where I can compute the intensity distribution of the grayscale image. But I couldn't find a method to analyze the histogram and choose the value where the objects of interest (lighter) lies. That is; I want to differ the obviously dark background spikes from the lighter foreground spikes--in this case above 200, but in another case could be say, 100 if the objects are grayish.

@TITLE:Adding opencv processing to gstreamer application
@CONTENT:I'm trying to do the following: receive video stream using gstreamer and process it with opencv. I've found few solutions, and one of them is to write video into (from gstreamer) fifo and then read it using opencv. (OPTION3 here MJPEG streaming and decoding). The problem is I cant open pipe. cvCreateFileCapture just never returns. Here is a part code I wrote: if(mkfifo("fifo.avi", S_IRUSR| S_IWUSR) == -1)
{
    cout<<"Cant create fifo"<<endl;
    cout<<errno<<endl;
}

loop = g_main_loop_new(NULL, false);

fsink = gst_element_factory_make("filesink", "fsink");
g_object_set(G_OBJECT(fsink), "location", "fifo.avi", NULL);

playbin = gst_element_factory_make("playbin2", "play");    
g_object_set(G_OBJECT(playbin), "uri", uri.c_str(), NULL);
g_object_set(G_OBJECT(playbin), "video-sink", fsink, NULL);

bus = gst_pipeline_get_bus(GST_PIPELINE(playbin));

@TITLE:Design for a chat app using Core Data
@CONTENT:I'm writing a chat app and I'm in the process of changing my db to use Core Data. I currently use sqlite directly but I want to take advantage of iCloud feature so I'm switching the engine. My main table is called Entry with the following properties: NSInteger type;
NSDate* timestamp;
NSString* username;
NSString* session;
NSString* body;
 where 'type' can be: 1 - message
2 - file transfer (which then 'body' represents a file name in the documents folder)
3 - user joined
4 - user left
 My app also supports multi-user chat (hence why the 'user joined'/'user left' types). All messages belong to the same conversation (multi-chat only), will have a valid 'session' property. In my chat history, my problem is how to achieve the 'load more' like Apple did in the SMS app: I will query based on 'username=%@ AND session IS NULL' or 'session=%@' to show that history and use a LIMIT of 50 sorted by reversed 'timestamp'. I then want to have a button "Load more" which will load the next 50 messages - I'm not sure how to do it with Core Data. My next question is how to show the list of conversations. Right now with raw sqlite, I perform a join on 2 queries: the first is the last message of each user and the second is the last message of each multi-user conversation. I then sort them all by date. Since Core Data does not support joins, I'm not sure how to perform this query. Thanks
@CODE:NSInteger type;
NSDate* timestamp;
NSString* username;
NSString* session;
NSString* body; 1 - message
2 - file transfer (which then 'body' represents a file name in the documents folder)

4 - user left 'username=%@ AND session IS NULL' 'session=%@'

@TITLE:Downcasting from base pointer to templated derived types
@CONTENT:I have the following hierarchy: class base

template <typename T>
class derived1 : public base

template <typename T>
class derived2 : public base

 Now given a pointer to base, I'd like to find out if the underlying is either derived1 or derived2. The problem is that both derived1 and derived2 can be specialised on many different types, using dynamic_cast to test for a down cast requires the template type to be know. I've ended up with messy, unmaintable and incomplete bit of code: base* b = new derived1<int>();

if (dynamic_cast<derived1<int>*> ||
    dynamic_cast<derived1<unsigned int>*> ||

else if (dynamic_cast<derived2<int>*> ||
    dynamic_cast<derived2<unsigned int>*> ||
    dynamic_cast<derived2<double>*>)
  std::cout << "is derived2";
 Is there a better way, that can handle any type specialization?

@CONTENT:Could somebody explain how you can manually create a remember me cookie in a controller? I want the users to stay logged in after they pressed the "register" button, without having to login with their credentials afterwards. I've tried to create a cookie manually but i'm guessing the cookie value is incorrect, and therefor the "remember me" functionality doesn't work. A cookie with the correct name gets set. I've checked that. The remember me functionality works as expected when using the normal login procedure with the user's credentials. security.yml security.yml remember me security:
   firewalls:
       main:
           remember_me:

               path:     /
               key:      myKey
 This is what I have now, even though the cookie is set, it doesn't work. $um = $this->get('fos_user.user_manager');
$member = $um->createUser();

¡K Form stuff with bindRequest etc.

$um->updatePassword($member);
$um->updateUser($member);

$providerKey = $this->container->getParameter('fos_user.firewall_name');
$securityKey = 'myKey';

$token = new RememberMeToken($member, $providerKey, $securityKey,

 i have tried custom scrollview for that but i have problem with touchesBegan method. its not calling every time. even i tried this but not able to stop two finger scroll in UIScrollview. for (UIGestureRecognizer *mgestureRecognizer in _scrollView.gestureRecognizers) {

@LINK:/questions/8485947/why-does-a-single-threaded-process-execute-on-several-processors-cores
@TITLE:Why does a single threaded process execute on several processors/cores?
@CONTENT:Say I run a simple single-threaded process like the one below: public class SirCountALot {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int count = 0;
        while (true) {
            count++;
        }
    }
}
 (This is Java because that's what I'm familiar with, but I suspect it doesn't really matter) I have an i7 processor (4 cores, or 8 counting hyperthreading), and I'm running Windows 7 64-bit so I fired up Sysinternals Process Explorer to look at the CPU usage, and as expected I see it is using around 20% of all available CPU. But when I toggle the option to show 1 graph per CPU, I see that instead of 1 of the 4 "cores" being used, the CPU usage is spread all over the cores: Instead what I would expect is 1 core maxed out, but this only happens when I set the affinity for the process to a single core. Why is the workload split over the separate cores? Wouldn't splitting the workload over several cores mess with the caching or incur other performance penalties? Is it for the simple reason of preventing overheating of one core? Or is there some deeper reason? Edit: I'm aware that the operating system is responsible for the scheduling, but I want to know why it "bothers". Surely from a naive viewpoint, sticking a (mostly*) single-threaded process to 1 core is the simpler & more efficient way to go? *I say mostly single-threaded because there's multiple theads here, but only 2 of them are doing anything:
@CODE:public class SirCountALot {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int count = 0;
        while (true) {
            count++;

@TITLE:Best practice for organising reusable DBAL queries in Symfony2?
@CONTENT:I'm working on a Symfony2 project at the moment. For the most part it's totally standard; I'm using the ORM layer to interface with the database via my Entities. No problems there. However, I do need to make infrequent queries to a small handful of tables in an existing schema elsewhere in the system, which contains what I would call 'reference' information: things like currency conversion ratios and such. I have SELECT only access to this schema. I set up another connection and I have been dropping to the DBAL layer to make the queries on this schema, which has been working pretty well so far. My issue is that, although infrequent, I think I'll need to repeat some of my DBAL queries in more than one place in my app; I would like to refactor these queries into some sort of repository, where they are more easily used/tested/etc. I thought about creating Entities for the tables, but I feel this is overkill in this case. Am I correct in thinking that you need Entities to create a repository? Instead I am wondering if there is a 'Symfony way' to do this? Something nice and elegant :) Thanks! Darragh

@TITLE:Design for a chat app using Core Data
@CONTENT:I'm writing a chat app and I'm in the process of changing my db to use Core Data. I currently use sqlite directly but I want to take advantage of iCloud feature so I'm switching the engine. My main table is called Entry with the following properties: NSInteger type;
NSDate* timestamp;
NSString* username;
NSString* session;
NSString* body;
 where 'type' can be: 1 - message
2 - file transfer (which then 'body' represents a file name in the documents folder)
3 - user joined
4 - user left
 My app also supports multi-user chat (hence why the 'user joined'/'user left' types). All messages belong to the same conversation (multi-chat only), will have a valid 'session' property. In my chat history, my problem is how to achieve the 'load more' like Apple did in the SMS app: I will query based on 'username=%@ AND session IS NULL' or 'session=%@' to show that history and use a LIMIT of 50 sorted by reversed 'timestamp'. I then want to have a button "Load more" which will load the next 50 messages - I'm not sure how to do it with Core Data. My next question is how to show the list of conversations. Right now with raw sqlite, I perform a join on 2 queries: the first is the last message of each user and the second is the last message of each multi-user conversation. I then sort them all by date. Since Core Data does not support joins, I'm not sure how to perform this query. Thanks
@CODE:NSInteger type;
NSDate* timestamp;
NSString* username;
NSString* session;
NSString* body; 1 - message
2 - file transfer (which then 'body' represents a file name in the documents folder)
3 - user joined
4 - user left 'username=%@ AND session IS NULL' 'session=%@'

@TITLE:Downcasting from base pointer to templated derived types
@CONTENT:I have the following hierarchy: class base
{
public:
   virtual ~base(){}
   virtual void foo() {}
};

template <typename T>
class derived1 : public base

};

template <typename T>
class derived2 : public base
{
   virtual void foo() {};
};
 Now given a pointer to base, I'd like to find out if the underlying is either derived1 or derived2. The problem is that both derived1 and derived2 can be specialised on many different types, using dynamic_cast to test for a down cast requires the template type to be know. I've ended up with messy, unmaintable and incomplete bit of code: base* b = new derived1<int>();

if (dynamic_cast<derived1<int>*> ||
    dynamic_cast<derived1<unsigned int>*> ||
    dynamic_cast<derived1<double>*>)

else if (dynamic_cast<derived2<int>*> ||
    dynamic_cast<derived2<unsigned int>*> ||
    dynamic_cast<derived2<double>*>)
  std::cout << "is derived2";
 Is there a better way, that can handle any type specialization?

@CONTENT:Could somebody explain how you can manually create a remember me cookie in a controller? I want the users to stay logged in after they pressed the "register" button, without having to login with their credentials afterwards. I've tried to create a cookie manually but i'm guessing the cookie value is incorrect, and therefor the "remember me" functionality doesn't work. A cookie with the correct name gets set. I've checked that. The remember me functionality works as expected when using the normal login procedure with the user's credentials. security.yml security.yml remember me security:
   firewalls:
       main:
           remember_me:
               lifetime: 86400
               domain:   ~
               path:     /
               key:      myKey
 This is what I have now, even though the cookie is set, it doesn't work. $um = $this->get('fos_user.user_manager');
$member = $um->createUser();

¡K Form stuff with bindRequest etc.

$um->updatePassword($member);
$um->updateUser($member);

$providerKey = $this->container->getParameter('fos_user.firewall_name');
$securityKey = 'myKey';

$token = new RememberMeToken($member, $providerKey, $securityKey,
$member->getRoles());
$this->container->get('security.context')->setToken($token);

$redirectResponse = new RedirectResponse($url);
$redirectResponse->headers->setCookie(

$member->getPassword()))),
       time() + 60*60*24
   )

 (This is Java because that's what I'm familiar with, but I suspect it doesn't really matter) I have an i7 processor (4 cores, or 8 counting hyperthreading), and I'm running Windows 7 64-bit so I fired up Sysinternals Process Explorer to look at the CPU usage, and as expected I see it is using around 20% of all available CPU. But when I toggle the option to show 1 graph per CPU, I see that instead of 1 of the 4 "cores" being used, the CPU usage is spread all over the cores: Instead what I would expect is 1 core maxed out, but this only happens when I set the affinity for the process to a single core. Why is the workload split over the separate cores? Wouldn't splitting the workload over several cores mess with the caching or incur other performance penalties? Is it for the simple reason of preventing overheating of one core? Or is there some deeper reason? Edit: I'm aware that the operating system is responsible for the scheduling, but I want to know why it "bothers". Surely from a naive viewpoint, sticking a (mostly*) single-threaded process to 1 core is the simpler & more efficient way to go? *I say mostly single-threaded because there's multiple theads here, but only 2 of them are doing anything:
@CODE:public class SirCountALot {

@TITLE:Best practice for organising reusable DBAL queries in Symfony2?
@CONTENT:I'm working on a Symfony2 project at the moment. For the most part it's totally standard; I'm using the ORM layer to interface with the database via my Entities. No problems there. However, I do need to make infrequent queries to a small handful of tables in an existing schema elsewhere in the system, which contains what I would call 'reference' information: things like currency conversion ratios and such. I have SELECT only access to this schema. I set up another connection and I have been dropping to the DBAL layer to make the queries on this schema, which has been working pretty well so far. My issue is that, although infrequent, I think I'll need to repeat some of my DBAL queries in more than one place in my app; I would like to refactor these queries into some sort of repository, where they are more easily used/tested/etc. I thought about creating Entities for the tables, but I feel this is overkill in this case. Am I correct in thinking that you need Entities to create a repository? Instead I am wondering if there is a 'Symfony way' to do this? Something nice and elegant :) Thanks! Darragh

@CONTENT:I started doing some thinking about creating an Android application that can be used within a corporate building to determine what room you are in. Obviously I'm thinking GPS and network locations wouldn't be accurate enough to accomplish this. (Not to mention the instability of GPS signal inside) I looked briefly into calculating distance via the accelerometer, but it is apparently highly volatile and leaves a large margin for error. I've also considered some sort of triangulation from routers, but you run into issues with walls/microwaves and various other things that could upset the signal strength. Does anyone have any possible ideas or directions to try?

@TITLE:Context aware authorization using CanCan
@CONTENT:I want to use CanCan to handle my permissions. My site has many different permissions levels, and most of them are context aware. For instance, Here are the relations in my 3 main models: class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :league_relations
  has_many :leagues, :through => :league_relations
end

class League < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :league_relations
  has_many :users, :through => :league_relations
end

class LeagueRelation < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :user
  belongs_to :league
end
 Note, LeagueRelations is a nested resource of Leagues. What I want to do is allow a user to modify leagues, and gauge each user's authorization based off of data stored in league_relation. I would then like a user to modify league relation, based only the data stored in the user model. To be succinct: I basically want LeagueRelations to be used to authorize League actions, and Users to be used to authorize LeagueRelations actions. i.e. league_relation.owner = true to delete a League, but user.owner? must be true to delete a LeagueRelation. How can I authorize based on the attributes of league_relation when inside the league controller, and authorize other actions in other controllers on other models. Please leave a comment if you need more clarification. Thanks.

@TITLE:Sass: Dealing with the IE 4095 selectors per stylesheet restriction
@CONTENT:Note: This question refers to a Rails project with Sass & Compass. Using the Rails Asset Pipeline? Then have a look at this question. We are developing a big application with many use cases and many individually styled pages, partly for multiple contexts. Which simply means a lot of style information. With the newest section of our application, we have broken Internet Explorer's limit of 4095 selectors per stylesheet. (Want a proof of this limitation? http://marc.baffl.co.uk/browser_bugs/css-selector-limit/) Okay. So, why do we not simply split the application style sheet into multiple ones by design? Well, mixins and selector inheritance will not work across multiple Sass files (not partials), right? I'd say the quality of the stylesheets is rather good, we cannot optimize away the exceeding amount of selectors. (There is rather more to come.) I also believe that minimizing the amount of selectors should not be our primary optimization goal. The Sass core team advises to use selector inheritance instead of mixins where applicable in order to save CSS file size. By doing so, the number of selectors tends to grow though. So what should I do? I am thinking about writing a script that generates additional css files, partitioning my big application.css file. These would only be loaded in IE then (so that I don't have multiple requests in modern browsers). I would need a simple css parser for that in order to cut the application.css file after max. 4095 selectors at a valid position. And I would need an compass compile - after hook so that developers don't need to generate the IE files by hand in order to test it. Please, tell me, that you got a better idea! Best, Christian

@CONTENT:For some reasons I can't use xml layout files. But I need to create a tablet android app. I decided to use fragments. I want to create the same layout that this xml generates: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

<LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:orientation="horizontal"
    android:layout_width="fill_parent" android:layout_height="fill_parent">

            android:background="?android:attr/detailsElementBackground" />

</LinearLayout>
 But I have problems with adding fragments to my linearLayout:     public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(createUI());
    }

    private View createUI() {
        LinearLayout layout = new LinearLayout(this);

        layout.setOrientation(LinearLayout.HORIZONTAL);
        layout.setLayoutParams(new LinearLayout.LayoutParams(AbsListView.LayoutParams.FILL_PARENT, AbsListView.LayoutParams.FILL_PARENT));
        layout.setId(0x101);
        {
            FragmentTransaction fragmentTransaction = getFragmentManager().beginTransaction();
            fragmentTransaction.add(0x101, new ItemsList());
            fragmentTransaction.add(0x101, new ItemDetails());
            fragmentTransaction.commit();
        }
        return layout;
    }
 Actually I can't even create LinearLayout with two identical fragments:             ...
            fragmentTransaction.add(0x101, new ItemsList());
            fragmentTransaction.add(0x101, new ItemsList());
            ...
 Please help Btw I can't figure out why do we need to declare "FrameLayout" for itemDetails Fragment but "fragment" is enough for itemsList ListFragment? UPD: To do so one should just add third param:             ...
            fragmentTransaction.add(0x101, new ItemsList(), "uniqueTag1");
            fragmentTransaction.add(0x101, new ItemsList(), "uniqueTag2");
            ...
 Default value for the tag parameter is null, so I was trying to create two different elements with identical ids. Thanks to p-lo for his comment.

I use the character "¡Ó" as my prompt for git repositories. In Emacs' ansi-term, my prompt isn't rendered as unicode, and shows as "\302\261". Displaying the current coding system shows that it defaults to utf-8-unix for input to the process, but I get raw binary as the decoding output. I can hit C-c RET p to change the encoding and decoding coding systems. I'm drawing a blank as to how to set this automatically when I start a terminal? I've tried adding to term-mode-hook to set the buffer's coding system to no avail. I think I've found what I'm looking for in term.el, but I don't care to tweak the distribution elisp, and it appears the raw binary was added to fix a bug somewhere else. EDIT: This was unclear originally. I'm having issues setting the default process coding system for ansi-term running under Cocoa-ized Emacs 23.3 on MacOS.

@TITLE:volatile variables and memory barrier in java
@CONTENT:I've got a data structure which consists of linked nodes. You can think of it as of a simple LinkedList. Each node of the list consists of some value and a next field pointing the other node or null if it is the last node. The first node works as a root, it has no value it only points to the next node. All the other nodes are practically immutable that is once they are created neither their value nor their next field change during lifetime, unless the structure is being disposed which relates to a specific situation. One (only one) thread adds new nodes to the front of the list. It is accomplished by constructing a new object, setting its fields and setting the next field to the object pointed by the root, then setting the root's next field to this new node. The other nodes browse through the structure only performing reads. They have a reference to the root node, then they go through the other nodes until they find what are looking for or reach the end of the list. My question is: is it sufficient to make the next field volatile? From my understanding of java memory model, if the main thread (the one that adds new nodes) will perform a volatile write when adding a new node then everything will be synchronized just fine and no inconsistencies will occur. Also is it right to assume that on x86 architecture reads of a volatile variable won't incur any performance degradation? As the other threads will frequently browse through the structure reading the next field it is important that this can be done freely without any memory barriers etc. I also have one more concern. The threads that are going to browse the structure are also going to hold some additional nodes. These nodes will be completely thread-local that is they are going to be used by only the thread that created them and are not going to be shared at all. For these additional nodes it is unnecessary for the next field to be volatile. Moreover setting the volatile next field will issue a memory barrier which will cause an undesirable performance loss. I wonder is there a way to avoid this. Ideally it would be just perfect if the next field would work sometimes as a volatile field and sometimes as a normal field ;) or if I had a full control and could issue memory barriers on my own, whenever I need. Edit: I also wondered would it be possible to somehow synchronize all these writes on a different volatile variable? For example some other completely unrelated static variable? Since volatile write flushes all the pending writes, wouldn't it be possible for the next field not to be volatile and instead a different volatile variable would be written after the updating thread does all the work? It does not look very safe to me since there is no happens before relation and the previous writes might get reordered. Next field assignments could be reoredered with the value fields assignments leading to iterating threads observing inconsistent object state. But maybe it is possible to come up with such a scheme that would be safe? How about this one: updating thread first constructs a new object, initializes its value fields, sets its next field to node pointed by the root node, performs a volatile write on some static variable, sets the next field of the root node to the newly created node

@TITLE:IOS Saving State For Complex Apps
@CONTENT:I'm building a fairly complex business application on the iPad IOS 4.2: 4 tabs, with potentially deep navigational paths on each tab. In the opinion of some of your more experienced IOS developers, what would the general expectation of a user be with respect to saving application state between launches (i.e. after an app's been fully terminated and subsequently restarted)? I'm using Core Data and have all the data issues covered, but I'm concerned about the application's navigational tree. If the user had left the 1st tab on screen 3, the 2nd tab on screen 4, the third on screen 2, where he left the entry of a new record half-complete, and was, at the time of the app entering the background, working on the 4th tab on screen 3...do you think the average user would expect the application to remember all that the next time it launched? (My gut says yes, though I'm unsure for how long.) If the answer is yes, can you suggest a general strategy for handling this (and, again, I'm talking about the navigational tree here, not Core Data stuff)? For example, if navigational controllers were used as the root view controller for each tab, it would be simple enough to record enough info about their navigational stacks to be able to restore them later. But what about things like popovers, alert/action sheets, or modal VCs created on the fly? Should each view controller record the state of its UI objects and, if so, what is the recommended way to do this? I know a lot of this is up to the user, but I'm asking for the general perspective on these issues, i.e. the voice of experience. Thanks, Wayne

@CONTENT:Imagine I have something like this: def example = {

}
 Explaining my problem: Although dynamic finders are very easy to use and fast to learn, I must replace dynamic finders of my website for sql queries because it is a requirement. As I don't understand SQL that much, my main questions are: a) I am using an SQLS database, with the drivers and datasource good configured and my website works as it is right now. If I want to replace the "findAllByUser" for an sql statement, should i do something like this: def dataSource
...
def db = new Sql(dataSource)
def temp = db.rows("SELECT ... ")
 b) And that will work? I mean, the temp object will be a list as it is if I use "findAllByUser", and do I need to open a connection to the database =?

@TITLE:Textures in OpenGL ES 2.0 for Android
@CONTENT:I'm new to OpenGL and I'm teaching myself by making a 2D game for Android with ES 2.0. I am starting off by creating a "Sprite" class that creates a plane and renders a texture to it. To practice, I have two Sprite objects that are drawn alternating in the same place. I got this much working fine and well with ES 1.0, but now that I've switched to 2.0, I am getting a black screen with no errors. I'm exhausted trying to figure out what I'm doing wrong, but I have a strong feeling it has to do with my shaders. I'm going to dump all the relevant code here and hopefully somebody can give me an answer or some advice as to what I'm doing wrong. And if it's not immediately apparent what I'm doing wrong, perhaps some advice on how to figure it out? Thanks in advance for looking through all the code I'm about to post. The three classes I'm posting are: GameRenderer - the renderer for my GLSurfaceView Shader - creates a shader program object Sprite - creates a square and draws a texture on it Also, I'll post my vertex and fragment shader source. Related classes I didn't think were relevant enough to post: GameActivity GameView - A GLSurfaceView GameLoopThread - My main game loop FPSCounter - outputs the average FPS to logcat every 100 frames.

@TITLE:Find differences between two entities of the same type
@CONTENT:I'm working on an mvc3 web app. When the user updates something, I want to compare the old data to the new one the user is inputing and for each field that is different add those to a log to create an activity log. Right now this is what my save action looks like: [HttpPost]
public RedirectToRouteResult SaveSingleEdit(CompLang newcomplang)
{
    var oldCompLang = _db.CompLangs.First(x => x.Id == newcomplang.Id);

    _db.CompLangs.Attach(oldCompLang);
    newcomplang.LastUpdate = DateTime.Today;
    _db.CompLangs.ApplyCurrentValues(newcomplang);
    _db.SaveChanges();

    var comp = _db.CompLangs.First(x => x.Id == newcomplang.Id);

    return RedirectToAction("ViewSingleEdit", comp);
}
 I found that I could use this to iterate through my property of oldCompLang: var oldpropertyInfos = oldCompLang.GetType().GetProperties();
 But this doesn't really help as it only shows me the properties (Id, Name, Status...) and not the values of these properties (1, Hello, Ready...). I could just go the hard way: if (oldCompLang.Status != newcomplang.Status)
{
    // Add to my activity log table something for this scenario
}
 But I really don't want to be doing that for all the properties of the object. I'm not sure what's the best way to iterate through both objects to find mismatches (for example the user changed the name, or the status...) and build a list from those differences that I can store in another table.
@CODE:[HttpPost]
public RedirectToRouteResult SaveSingleEdit(CompLang newcomplang)
{
    var oldCompLang = _db.CompLangs.First(x => x.Id == newcomplang.Id);

    newcomplang.LastUpdate = DateTime.Today;

@LINK:/questions/5515021/compute-a-compounded-return-series-in-python
@TITLE:Compute a compounded return series in Python
@CONTENT:Greetings all, I have two series of data: daily raw stock price returns (positive or negative floats) and trade signals (buy=1, sell=-1, no trade=0). The raw price returns are simply the log of today's price divided by yesterday's price: log(p_today / p_yesterday)
 An example: raw_return_series = [ 0.0063 -0.0031 0.0024 ..., -0.0221 0.0097 -0.0015]
 The trade signal series looks like this: signal_series = [-1. 0. -1. -1. 0. 0. -1. 0. 0. 0.]
 To get the daily returns based on the trade signals: daily_returns = [raw_return_series[i] * signal_series[i+1] for i in range(0, len(signal_series)-1)]
 These daily returns might look like this: [0.0, 0.00316, -0.0024, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0023, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0] # results in daily_returns; notice the 0s
 I need to use the daily_returns series to compute a compounded returns series. However, given that there are 0 values in the daily_returns series, I need to carry over the last non-zero compound return "through time" to the next non-zero compound return. For example, I compute the compound returns like this (notice I am going "backwards" through time): compound_returns = [(((1 + compounded[i + 1]) * (1 + daily_returns[i])) - 1) for i in range(len(compounded) - 2, -1, -1)]
 and the resulting list: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0023, 0.0, 0.0, -0.0024, 0.0031, 0.0] # (notice the 0s)
 My goal is to carry over the last non-zero return to the accumulate these compound returns. That is, since the return at index i is dependent on the return at index i+1, the return at index i+1 should be non-zero. Every time the list comprehension encounters a zero in the daily_return series, it essentially restarts.
@CODE:log(p_today / p_yesterday) raw_return_series = [ 0.0063 -0.0031 0.0024 ..., -0.0221 0.0097 -0.0015] signal_series = [-1. 0. -1. -1. 0. 0. -1. 0. 0. 0.] daily_returns = [raw_return_series[i] * signal_series[i+1] for i in range(0, len(signal_series)-1)] [0.0, 0.00316, -0.0024, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0023, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0] # results in daily_returns; notice the 0s compound_returns = [(((1 + compounded[i + 1]) * (1 + daily_returns[i])) - 1) for i in range(len(compounded) - 2, -1, -1)] [0.0, 0.0, 0.0023, 0.0, 0.0, -0.0024, 0.0031, 0.0] # (notice the 0s) python scipy\numpy python

@TITLE:Good Architecture/Library For Robust Plugin/Addon Management
@CONTENT:We have an application which, as one of its requirements, will take arbitrary 3rd party plugins, load them, and run their UI alongside our home-grown application. We've been loading these 3rd party plugins into their own AppDomains for isolation purposes, and everything works ok. Until one of the plugins crashes out with an unhandled exception. In this circumstance, the entire application goes down, even though all that is really affected is one of our 'extra' tool windows. We'd like, ideally, some way to handle the "unhandled" exception, unload the damaged AppDomain, and then just reload it fresh. The problem is that we can't find a mechanism in the event handler for the unhandled exception whereby we can flag the exception as being 'handled'. Further, since the plugins have their own UI components with their own set of interactions with the user, it would be extremely difficult to "wrap" our interactions with the plugins in try/catch/finally blocks. Are there any frameworks/programming libraries/patterns that lend themselves to solving this problem? We can do plugin stuff fine; what we need help with is keeping the application alive when code in a different AppDomain fails unexpectedly.

@CONTENT:I want to create a tagging system like seen here on Stack Overflow or on Quora. It'll be its own model, and I'm planning on using this autocomplete plugin to help users find tags. I have a couple of questions: I want tags to be entirely user-generated. If a user inputs a new tag by typing it and pressing an "Add" button, then that tag is added to the db, but if a user types in an existing tag, then it uses that one. I'm thinking of using code like this: def create

@video.tags = find_or_create_by_name(@video.tags.name)

end
 Am I on the right track? I'd like to implement something like on Stack Overflow or Quora such that when you click a tag from the suggested list or click an "Add" button, that tag gets added right above the text field with ajax. How would I go about implementing something like that? I know this is kind of an open-ended question. I'm not really looking for the exact code as much as a general nudge in the right direction. Of course, code examples wouldn't hurt :) Note I am NOT asking for help on how to set up the jQuery autocomplete plugin... I know how to do that. Rather, it seems like I'll have to modify the code in the plugin so that instead of the tags being added inside the text field, they are added above the text field. I'd appreciate any direction with this.

@TITLE:apache .gz gzip content handler for Linux documentation /usr/share/doc and localhost/doc/
@CONTENT:How could I create a simple content handler for apache .gz gzip content. I want it to uncompress say http://localhost/doc/FAQ/Linux-FAQ.gz and send it to the browser as plain text. There is a lot of documentation for Linux in /usr/share/doc and localhost/doc/. I don't want to use zless, zcat or vim to read the content. I use apache to browse the documentation on my local machine and have my web browser revive it as standard text so that it does not ask me to download the *.gz file every time. Alias /doc/ "/usr/share/doc/"
Alias local.doc "/usr/share/doc/"
<Directory "/usr/share/doc/">
    Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride None
    Order deny,allow
    Deny from all
    Allow from 127.0.0.0/255.0.0.0 ::1/128
</Directory>
 But Now I want all those .gz file under /usr/share/doc/ to be servered as plain text. I think I could do that very simply with a python script in cgi-bin. I am looking for a nice content handler for those files. Like the way it php files are handled .gz should be uncompressed and sent to the browser. <IfModule mod_php5.c>
  AddType application/x-httpd-php .php .phtml .php3
  AddType application/x-httpd-php-source .phps
</IfModule>
LoadModule php5_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/libphp5.so
 I see there is a mod_deflate, how would this apply. Could this handle the gzip content. It would make browsing documentation so much easier. Any programing resources to help here would be nice.

@LINK:/questions/5218333/asp-net-mvc3-set-custom-iserviceprovider-in-validationcontext-so-validators-can
@TITLE:Asp.Net MVC3: Set custom IServiceProvider in ValidationContext so validators can resolve services
@CONTENT:Update 18th December 2012 Since this question seems to be getting quite a few views, I should point out that the accepted answer is not the solution I used, but it does provide the links and resources to build a solution, but, to my mind, not the ideal solution. My answer contains replacements for standard parts of the MVC framework; and you should only use those if you are comfortable checking that they still work for future versions (some private code was ripped out of the official sources, because there wasn't enough extensibility in the base classes). I can confirm, however, that these two classes also work for Asp.Net MVC 4 as well as 3. It is also possible to repeat a similar implementation for the Asp.Net Web API framework as well, which I have done recently. End update I have a type that has a lot of 'standard' validation (required etc) but also a bit of custom validation as well. Some of this validation requires grabbing hold of a service object and looking up some lower-level (i.e. 'beneath' the Model layer) meta data using one of the other properties as a key. The meta data then controls whether one or more properties are required as well as valid formats for those properties. To be more concrete - the type is a Card Payment object, simplified to two of the properties in question as follows: public class CardDetails
{
  public string CardTypeID { get; set; }
  public string CardNumber { get; set; }
}
 I then have a service: public interface ICardTypeService
{
  ICardType GetCardType(string cardTypeID);
}
 ICardType then contains different bits of information - the two here that are crucial being: public interface ICardType
{
  //different cards support one or more card lengths
  IEnumerable<int> CardNumberLengths { get; set; }
  //e.g. - implementation of the Luhn algorithm
  Func<string, bool> CardNumberVerifier { get; set; }
}
 My controllers all have the ability to resolve an ICardTypeService using a standard pattern i.e.  var service = Resolve<ICardTypeService>();
 (Although I should mention that the framework behind this call is proprietary) Which they gain via the use of a common interface public interface IDependant
{
  IDependencyResolver Resolver { get; set; }
}
 My framework then takes care of assigning the most-specific dependency resolver available for the controller instance when it is constructed (either by another resolver, or by the MVC standard controller factory). That Resolve method in the last-but one code block is a simple wrapper around this Resolver member. So - if I can grab the selected ICardType for the payment that is received from the browser, I can then perform initial checks on card number length etc. The issue is, how to resolve the service from within my override of IsValid(object, ValidationContext) override of ValidationAttribute? I need to pass through the current controller's dependency resolver to the validation context. I see that ValidationContext both implements IServiceProvider and has an instance of IServiceContainer - so clearly I should be able to create a wrapper for my service resolver that also implements one of those (probably IServiceProvider). I've already noted that in all places where a ValidationContext is produced by the MVC framework, the service provider is always passed null. So at what point in the MVC pipeline should I be looking to override the core behaviour and inject my service provider? I should add that this will not be the only scenario in which I need to do something like this - so ideally I'd like something which I can apply to the pipeline so that all ValidationContexts are configured with the current service provider for the current controller.
@CODE:public class CardDetails
{
  public string CardTypeID { get; set; }
  public string CardNumber { get; set; }
} public interface ICardTypeService
{
  ICardType GetCardType(string cardTypeID);
} ICardType public interface ICardType
{
  //different cards support one or more card lengths
  IEnumerable<int> CardNumberLengths { get; set; }
  //e.g. - implementation of the Luhn algorithm
  Func<string, bool> CardNumberVerifier { get; set; }
} ICardTypeService var service = Resolve<ICardTypeService>(); public interface IDependant
{
  IDependencyResolver Resolver { get; set; }
} Resolve Resolver ICardType IsValid(object, ValidationContext) ValidationAttribute ValidationContext IServiceProvider IServiceContainer IServiceProvider ValidationContext ValidationContext

@CONTENT:I have a ListView where each row has two webviews side by side, taking up the entire row. I've set up onListItemClick() in my ListActivity, but they are not fired when I tap on one of the rows (unless the place I happen to tap is outside the webview's border - but this isn't likely behavior, users would most likely want to tap on the image inside the webview). I've tried setting setFocusable(false) and setFocusableInTouchMode(false), but those don't help. Ideally this would operate exactly like Facebook's newsfeed, where you can tap on the profile picture of someone's wall post and it acts as if you've tapped the entire row (in FBs case the text for the wall post)

@LINK:/questions/4511570/facebook-api-session-still-exists-after-user-logout
@TITLE:Facebook API - Session still exists after user logout
@CONTENT:I am using Facebook php-sdk in my iframe facebook app to get user login status. Right after I sign out using facebook Account > Log out link, the session is not destroyed yet. I must wait a few minutes before old session expires, then my app will again get the correct login status. I expect the facebook to kill itself and the session when user signs out. How do I manually kill the session? Here is my code: $initParams = array(
  'appId'  => $conf['app_id'], 
  'secret' => $conf['secret_api_key'],
  'cookie' => TRUE,
);

$fb = new Facebook($initParams);
$fb->getSession();  // will return a session object eventhough user signed out!
 SOLVED: calling $fb->api('/me') will destroy the session if user has previously logged out. I've changed my code as following: if ($session)
{
    try
    {
        $fbuid = $fb->getUser();
        $me = $fb->api('/me');
    }
    catch(FacebookApiException $e){}
}
 If the API call is unsuccessful, $session will be set to NULL. Very weird behavior, I don't explain everything that is going on here but it solved my problem of having residual session object not being updated via getSession() method.
@CODE:$initParams = array(
  'appId'  => $conf['app_id'],

@TITLE:EF4: LINQ 2 Entities query works in C# but not in VB
@CONTENT:[EDITED: I left the original question below, with some more context and code to reproduce the problem. The short version below contains the essence of the question] Short version: the query below throws a System.NotSupportedException: "Unable to cast the type 'System.Linq.IOrderedQueryable1' to type 'System.Linq.IQueryable1'. LINQ to Entities only supports casting Entity Data Model primitive types." The exception is only raised in the VB.Net version. When translated to C#, no exception is raised.    Dim doesThisCrash = From outerOrder In orders
        Where outerOrder.ProductId =
        (From p In products Join o In orders On p.Id Equals o.ProductId
         Order By p.Id
         Select p.Id).FirstOrDefault()
        Select outerOrder
    doesThisCrash.ToList()
 So, to make it crash, it seems that we need a subquery where the original ObjectSet (orders) is joined with another ObjectSet (products), and ordered. When using just the orders or the products set, no crash occurs. When leaving out the Order By, also no crash. I'm inclined to think this is a (VB.Net) compiler bug, unless there is something obvious that I'm overlooking here... For now my question still stands: why does a seemingly exact same query work in C# but not in VB? can this query be made to work in VB.Net? [/EDIT] Optional, longer version (original question): My domain looks very different, but I translated the problem to a simpler version, with the following entities (note: I actually defined these using the .edmx designer, so this is a simplified version):     public class Product
    {
        public int Id { get; set; }
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public DateTime DateCreated { get; set; }
    }

    public class Order
    {
        public int Id { get; set; }
        public int CustomerId { get; set; }
        public int ProductId { get; set; }
        public DateTime OrderDate { get; set; }
    }

    public class Customer
    {
        public int Id { get; set; }
    }
 I'm trying to work out a linq-to-entities query that should strucurally look like this, in VB.Net:     Dim db = New SampleEntities()
    Dim orders As IQueryable(Of Order) = db.Orders
    Dim products As IQueryable(Of Product) = db.Products
    Dim currentDate = DateTime.Now

    Dim qLinq = From outerOrder In orders
                Where outerOrder.OrderDate = currentDate AndAlso
                outerOrder.ProductId =
                    (From p In products Join o In orders On p.Id Equals o.ProductId
                     Where o.OrderDate = outerOrder.OrderDate AndAlso
                            outerOrder.CustomerId = o.CustomerId
                     Order By p.DateCreated
                     Select p.Id).FirstOrDefault()
                Select outerOrder
 This raises a System.NotSupportedException: "Unable to cast the type 'System.Linq.IOrderedQueryable1' to type 'System.Linq.IQueryable1'. LINQ to Entities only supports casting Entity Data Model primitive types." When leaving out the 'Order By' part, no exception is raised. I don't really see a reason why this query would not be supported... So I decided to try the same thing in C#: var qLinq = from oOut in orders
            where oOut.OrderDate == currentDate
                  && oOut.ProductId == 
                          (from p in products join o in orders on p.Id equals o.ProductId
                           where oOut.OrderDate == o.OrderDate 
                           && oOut.CustomerId == o.CustomerId
                           orderby p.DateCreated
                           select p.Id).FirstOrDefault()
                    select oOut;
 To my surprise, this works! Then I translated the C# query to extension method syntax, and then back to VB, but got the same results (the C# version works, the VB.Net version raises the same exception). So I guess my question is twofold: why does a seemingly exact same query work in C# but not in VB? can this query be made to work in VB.Net? For reference, here are the queries in extension method syntax: C# version:         var q = orders.Where(outerOrder => 
            outerOrder.OrderDate == currentDate &&
            outerOrder.ProductId == 
            (products
                .Join(orders, 
                    f => f.Id, 
                    o => o.ProductId,
                    (f, o) => new { f, o })
                .Where(t => t.o.OrderDate == outerOrder.OrderDate 
                           && outerOrder.CustomerId == t.o.CustomerId)

                             outerOrder.ProductId = (products.Join(orders,

@TITLE:Transactional And Reporting Databases - How?
@CONTENT:When building a transactional system that has a highly normalized DB, running reporting style queries, or even queries to display data on a UI can involve several joins, which in a data heavy scenario can and usually does, impact performance. Joins are expensive. Often, the guidance espoused is that you should never run these queries off your transactional DB model, rather you should use a denormalized flattened model that is tailored for specific UI views or reports which eliminates the need for many joins. Data duplication is not an issue in this scenario. This concept makes perfect sense, but what I rarely see when experts make these statements is exactly HOW to implement this. For example, (and quite frankly I'd appreciate an example using any platform) in a mid sized system running on a sql server back-end you have a normalized transactional model. You also have some reports and a website that require queries. So, you create a "reporting" database that flattens up the normalized data. How do you keep this in sync? Transaction log shipping? If so, how do you transform the data to fit in the reporting model?

Are there best practices for managing this, pitfalls to avoid, etc.? I gather this can create a very large load on the db if not done properly (or maybe even then?). If it makes a difference it is likely that people will 'follow' only a relatively small number of people (but a person may have many followers). However this is not certain, and I wouldn't want to count on it. Any advice gratefully received. Thanks.

@CONTENT:My iPhone app (http://hexalex.com) is not universal but it has a feature that I'd like to enable for people playing on iPads. Is there some way to detect that you're running on an iPad in compatibility mode? The UIDevice methods for detecting machine specs all return the values you would get on an iPhone (on the simulator at least). The only thing I can think of is detecting OS 3.2, but that technique won't work for long.

@CONTENT:So, I am looking at different hash functions to use for hashing a 4 tuple ip and port to identify flows. One I came across was ((size_t)(key.src.s_addr) * 59) ^
((size_t)(key.dst.s_addr)) ^
((size_t)(key.sport) << 16) ^
((size_t)(key.dport)) ^
((size_t)(key.proto));
 Now for the life of me, I cannot explain the prime used (59). why not 31, and then why go mess it up by multiplying the sport by a power of 2. Is there a better hash function to be used for ip addresses ?

@TITLE:Background Audio and Remote Control Support using MPMusicPlayerController on iOS 4. Is this even possible?
@CONTENT:I've spent two days on this and have gotten nowhere. I'm trying to use [MPMusicPlayerController applicationMusicPlayer] to play audio chosen from the user's iPod library and have it run in the background as well as support remote events. Now getting the music actually playing is the easy part. Get the instance, pick the songs, assign the music queue and play. Done and done. BUT... a) I can't get it to play in the background, and b) even when in the foreground I can't get the remote control events to work at all! And before you ask, yes, I have set the plist entries, the audio session category, the call to say I'm interested in getting remote events and set up a first responder to listen for them, so please know, yes, I've read read every single document on the subject that I could find* (*a task I blame Apple for for not being clear at all on this topic, nor having ANY example code for it!) and I've watched every one of the WWDC videos relating to it (even freezing the screen to copy the code exactly from their example...) so unless I've missed something not in this list, replying with any of those answers is not going to help. One more thing... I am explicitly talking about using the MPMusicPlayerController which according to the docs, never uses an application session. It always uses the system session. (Maybe that in itself answers my question, but the docs don't clearly say that so I'm not sure, hence this question.) That said, after two days, my thoughts are this: When using the MPMusicPlayerController, regardless of what methods you call or what plist entries you set, your app will never run in the background. Period. If you use the ipodMusicPlayer instance, the music keeps playing, but that's because it's the iPod that's playing, not your app. If you use the applicationMusicPlayer instance instead, when going to the background your music stops. In both cases, your app is suspended. Regardless of your using the ipodMusicPlayer or applicationMusicPlayer instances, all remote events go to the iPod application itself, not yours, even if you've explicitly asked for them. If you are using the applicationMusicPlayer instance and you use the remote to select 'Play', the iPod app receives the command so your audio ducks out and is interrupted and playback begins in the iPod app. If you've chosen the ipodMusicPlayer instead, then of course it doesn't matter as you have explicitly said you're basically just interested in remotely controlling the iPod app which again, is what actually receives the remote events. The icon in the quick-switch controls at the bottom never changes to your app's icon because again, your app is never actually set up to receive the events. The iPod application is, which is why its icon does appear there. So what I want to know is... am I wrong here? Has anyone successfully been able to use MPMusicPlayerController and been able to intercept the remote events? While I'd prefer to use the applicationMusicPlayer with background music support so I don't muck with the user's iPod, the bigger thing is remote control notifications, meaning if I have to use the ipodMusicControl and keep my app in the foreground to intercept those messages, so be it. It's ugly that way, but at least it's something. Code examples, or at least explicit steps against one of the built-in app templates would be GREATLY appreciated. (Don't even need the implementation... just the steps. Hopefully that will appease the inevitable 'It's still under NDA' thing that people keep answering questions with.) Mark

EDIT: Alsciende: I can agree that #1 and #8 are too vague. Therefore I remove #8 and try to clarify #1: With "Pseudocode for the skeleton", I basically mean could this be done entirely using JavaScript timers and how would you set up the various timers? Library for Google Analytics: Which libraries support the Google Analytics API and can produce neat charts. Preferably HTML5, JavaScript-based like Protovis. Library for Twitter: Which libraries would you recommend for fetching twitter search results and latest tweets from profiles. Libraries for Typography/CSS/HTML5: Trying to learn some HTML5 etc. in the process, please advice on any other typography/css libraries that could be of relevance. Scraping/Parsing? I'll give you a concrete example: Trying to fetch today's menu from this restaurant's website, how would you go about? (it's in Swedish - but you get the point - sorry ;) ) Real-time stats? I'm using the WassUp-plugin for WordPress to track real-time visitors on our website. Other logging software (AWStats etc.) is probably also installed on the webserver.

So my question is, could it be possible to write a java app to use http_proxy variable? Instead of programmatically setting http proxy and host in every app I will write.

@TITLE:Convert a string with a hex representation of an IEEE-754 double into JavaScript numeric variable
@CONTENT:Suppose I have a hex number "4072508200000000" and I want the floating point number that it represents (293.03173828125000) in IEEE-754 double format to be put into a JavaScript variable. I can think of a way that uses some masking and a call to pow(), but is there a simpler solution? A client-side solution is needed. This may help. It's a website that lets you enter a hex encoding of an IEEE-754 and get an analysis of mantissa and exponent. http://babbage.cs.qc.edu/IEEE-754/64bit.html Because people always tend to ask "why?," here's why: I'm trying to fill out an existing but incomplete implementation of Google's Procol Buffers (protobuf).

@CONTENT:When my application connects to an Oracle database I want to be able to see by looking at the active sessions in the database that it is connected. Currently it identifies itself as "JDBC Thin Client" because that's the driver that I'm using, but other Java based applications that I have are somehow able to set this value to something more meaningful, like "SQL Developer". I thought it was a property of the Connection or the OracleDataSource, but I've not managed to find one that does the trick. Is this possible?

For example, I want to get posts from author 'ivan' to show on a page. Normally, I create a link to '/posts/author/ivan' or smth like it, create a new Action like 'byAuthorAction()' in the Posts controller (or maybe Users controller, wherever), view for it (and all code what gets posts from model goes there) and create a new Route to it. How to add functionality to get any user's posts in json, xml formats for ajax and maybe API, keeping the DRY principle and designing the code structure as smart as I can? -- Thanks for answers!

@TITLE:How can I check Spring Security for user authentication and get roles from Flex?
@CONTENT:I'm using Spring, Spring Security, BlazeDS, Flex and spring-flex. I know that I can call channelSet.login() and channelSet.logout() to hook into Spring Security for authentication. channelSet.authenticated apparently only knows about the current Flex session, as it always starts off as false, until you call channelSet.login(). What I want to do: Check from Flex to know if a user is already in a session. If so, I want their username and roles. UPDATE I just thought I'd add details of the solution I used from brd6644's answer below, so that this might be easier for someone else who looks this up. I used this StackOverflow answer to make the SecurityContext injectable. I won't be rewriting the code from that answer in this one, so go look at it for the SecurityContextFacade. securityServiceImpl.java public class SecurityServiceImpl implements SecurityService {

@TITLE:SQL Insert one row or multiple rows data?
@CONTENT:I am working on a console application to insert data to a MS SQL Server 2005 database. I have a list of objects to be inserted. Here I use Employee class as example: List<Employee> employees;
 What I can do is to insert one object at time like this: foreach (Employee item in employees)
{
  string sql = @"INSERT INTO Mytable (id, name, salary) 
    values ('@id', '@name', '@salary')";
  // replace @par with values
  cmd.CommandText = sql; // cmd is IDbCommand
  cmd.ExecuteNonQuery();
}
 Or I can build a balk insert query like this: string sql = @"INSERT INTO MyTable (id, name, salary) ";
int count = employees.Count;
int index = 0;
foreach (Employee item in employees)
{
   sql  = sql + string.format(
     "SELECT {0}, '{1}', {2} ",
     item.ID, item.Name, item.Salary);
   if ( index != (count-1) )
      sql = sql + " UNION ALL ";
   index++
 }
 cmd.CommandType = sql;
 cmd.ExecuteNonQuery();
 I guess the later case is going to insert rows of data at once. However, if I have several ks of data, is there any limit for SQL query string? I am not sure if one insert with multiple rows is better than one insert with one row of data, in terms of performance? Any suggestions to do it in a better way?

The problem is, in XAML, there's no immediately obvious way to get control over the instantiation of the Converter object. So my XAML contains a line something like this: Source="{Binding Path=CurrentMessage, Converter={StaticResource ImagePathConverter}}" Where, the ImagePathConverter will be created for me. I suppose I could create a "service locator" static class and call it to resolve my dependency and change the StaticResource to a property "MyServiceLocator.TheImageConverter", but that makes me want to vomit. I am hoping this question can be answered with a few snippets of code that specifically target the code supplied - and perhaps a supporting link to an example. Not simply a recommendation to take a look somewhere. Also, very importantly, assume that the XAML does not have a code-behind - and that I cannot use one. I'm creating a skin and do not want a code behind. So I cannot set a class variable in the class constructor and reference it. Maybe that's unreasonable, I'm not sure yet.

It should be 508 compliant and for the most part, 508 compliance eliminates all the JavaScript grids. It has to be easy to use. Not too expensive ( a couple hundred dollars ) I've already reviewed the following grids: Ext Js MvcContrib jQueryGrid Update I found a javascript grid that performs the magic I am looking for yet, maintains 508 compatibility. It's a jQuery plugin called Datatables. It takes a preexisting table on the page and gives it sortablity and search features. Other grids would either render the table themselves or make ajax requests to the server.

@TITLE:WPF render performance with BitmapSource
@CONTENT:I've created a WPF control (inheriting from FrameworkElement) that displays a tiled graphic that can be panned. Each tile is 256x256 pixels at 24bpp. I've overridden OnRender. There, I load any new tiles (as BitmapFrame), then draw all visible tiles using drawingContext.DrawImage. Now, whenever there are more than a handful new tiles per render cycle, the framerate drops from 60fps to zero for about a second. This is not caused by loading the images (which takes in the order of milliseconds), nor by DrawImage (which takes no time at all, as it merely fills some intermediate render data structure). My guess is that the render thread itself chokes whenever it gets a large number (~20) of new BitmapSource instances (that is, ones it had not already cached). Either it spends a lot of time converting them to some internal DirectX-compatible format or it might be a caching issue. It cannot be running out of video RAM; Perforator shows peaks at below 60MB, I have 256MB. Also, Perforator says all render targets are hardware-accelerated, so that can't be it, either. Any insights would be appreciated! Thanks in advance Daniel @RandomEngy: BitmapScalingMode.LowQuality reduced the problem a little, but did not get rid of it. I am already loading tiles at the intended resolution. And it can't be the graphics driver, which is up-to-date (Nvidia). I'm a little surprised to learn that scaling takes that much time. The way I understood it, a bitmap (regardless of its size) is just loaded as a Direct3D texture and then hardware-scaled. As a matter of fact, once the bitmap has been rendered for the first time, I can change its rotation and scale without any further freezes.

 First of all, this doesn't seem to work - in the generated Xcode project (I'm running cmake . -G Xcode), SDKROOT is still set to nothing, and so it says "Current Mac OS". Second, assuming this is the right way to do this, how do I set the attribute only for the configuration Debug-iPhone?

@TITLE:Speeding up build times in ASP.NET
@CONTENT:I am currently involved in a ASP.NET project with about 40 projects in the solution. We are doing all our development in cloned Virtual PC environments so all developers have identical setups. That's all good, managing dependencies is easy, however building the solution is horribly slow. Virtual PC can only utilize one CPU so I'm really only using half of my computers resources. It takes a full 3 minutes from build to a complete page load.. and it's getting worse every day as the projects grow. Fixing simple things is starting to take a long time and personally, I'm getting frustrated waiting all the time as I can't really work while the computer is compiling. Is there any way of distributing my build across several computers to speed up the build process? Would an SSD noticeably improve upon my build times? Are there any other way of speeding up the build? Note: I have tried precompiling static dependencies with ngen but later read that ASP.NET does not support ngen. I use Visual Studio 2008 and there is no antivirus software present in the virtual environment.

@LINK:/questions/748331/strongly-typed-viewmodel-in-post-action-method-contains-only-null-values
@TITLE:Strongly typed ViewModel in POST action method contains only null values
@CONTENT:I am trying to implement my Edit action methods with strongly typed view which receives a custom-shaped ViewModel class. In other words, I want a strongly typed ViewModel which contains the Linq entity that should be edited plus a few other objects that should be displayed in the View. I can see the view when calling the GET Edit action method, but the strongly typed POST action method receives only a ViewModel class with null parameters and I can't figure out how to retrieve the POST parameters. The View Model looks as follows: //my custom-shaped ViewModel
public class CustomersFormViewModel
{
    public SelectList AccountTypesDropDownBox;
    public SelectList CountriesDropDownBox;
    public Customer Customer;
}
 The action method looks as follows: //
// GET: /CustomersController/Edit   

public ActionResult Edit(int ID)
{
   var model = new CustomersFormViewModel
                    {
                        Customer = repository.Load(ID.Value),
                        CountriesDropDownBox = GetCountries(),
                        AccountTypesDropDownBox = GetAccountTypes()
                    };
    return View(model);
}

//
// POST: /CustomersController/Edit  

[AcceptVerbs(HttpVerbs.Post)]
public ActionResult Edit(CustomersFormViewModel model)
{
    //THE NEXT LINE THROWS!!!
    Debug.Assert(Model.Customer!=null);
    return View(model);
}
 And this is my Edit view: <%@ Page Title="" Language="C#" MasterPageFile="~/Views/Shared/CustAdminMaster.master"
    Inherits="System.Web.Mvc.ViewPage<Zeiterfassung.Controllers.CustomersController+CustomersFormViewModel>" %>

<asp:Content ID="Content1" ContentPlaceHolderID="TitleContent" runat="server">
    NewEdit
</asp:Content>
<asp:Content ID="Content2" ContentPlaceHolderID="MainContent" runat="server">
    <h2>
        NewEdit</h2>
    <%= Html.ValidationSummary("Edit was unsuccessful. Please correct the errors and try again.") %>
    <% using (Html.BeginForm())
       {%>
    <fieldset>
        <legend>Fields</legend>
        <p>
            <label for="FirstName">FirstName:</label>
            <%= Html.TextBox("FirstName",Model.Customer.FirstName) %>
            <%= Html.ValidationMessage("FirstName", "*") %>
        </p>
        <p>
            <input type="submit" value="Save" />
        </p>
    </fieldset>
    <% } %>
    <div>
        <%=Html.ActionLink("Back to List", "Index") %>
    </div>
</asp:Content>
 I've also tried a POST action method with formValues parameters, but the the viewmodel still did not contain the posted parameters: [AcceptVerbs(HttpVerbs.Post)]
public ActionResult Edit(int ID, FormCollection formValues)
{
      CustomersFormViewModel model = new CustomersFormViewModel();            
      UpdateModel(model);
      //THE NEXT LINE STILL THROWS
      Debug.Assert(model.Customer!=null);
      return View("NewEdit",model);
}
 The only way I have found so far is to write my own code that grab the posted parameters from the FormCollection and updates my custom ViewModel accordingly. But this approach seems a bit primitive. Is there really no better way to do this? EDIT: I've just tried a different syntax in the view as tvanfosson suggested, but the problem remains unchanged: <label for="Customer.FirstName">FirstName:</label>
    <%= Html.TextBox("Customer.FirstName") %>
    <%= Html.ValidationMessage("Customer.FirstName", "*") %>

@LINK:/questions/657281/how-do-you-model-application-states
@TITLE:How do you model application states?
@CONTENT:I'm writing a game, and I want to model its different states (the Game Maker analogy would be frames, I guess) in a clean, object-oriented way. Previously, I've done it in the following way: class Game
{
  enum AppStates
  {
    APP_STARTING,
    APP_TITLE,
    APP_NEWGAME,
    APP_NEWLEVEL,
    APP_PLAYING,
    APP_PAUSED,
    APP_ENDED
  };

  typedef AppState(Game::*StateFn)();
  typedef std::vector<StateFn> StateFnArray;

  void Run()
  {
    // StateFn's to be registered here

    AppState lastState(APP_STARTING);
    while(lastState != APP_ENDED)
    {
      lastState = GetCycle_(lastState);
    }
    // cleanup
  }

protected:
  // define StateFn's here

  AppState GetCycle_(AppState a)
  {
    // pick StateFn based on passed variable, call it and return its result.
  }

  StateFnArray states_;
};
 This was hardly manageble for a smaller project. All the variables that the states were using were dumped in the Game class, however I'd want to keep object-orientedness to a maximum, only exposing variables that are shared by more than one state. I also want to be able to initialize a new state when switching to it rather than having to do it in the state that's just finishing (as it might have multiple outcomes - APP_PLAYING can switch to APP_PAUSED, APP_GAMEOVER, APP_NEWLEVEL, etc.). I thought of something like this (CAUTION! FUZZY STUFF!): struct AppState
{
  enum { LAST_STATE = -1; }
  typedef int StateID;
  typedef std::vector<AppState*> StateArray;

  static bool Add(AppState *state, StateID desiredID);
  // return false if desiredID is an id already assigned to

  static void Execute(StateID state)
  {
    while(id != LAST_STATE)
    {
      // bounds check etc.
      states_[id]->Execute();
    }
  }

  AppState() {};
  virtual ~AppState() {};

  virtual StateID Execute() =0; // return the ID for the next state to be executed

protected:
  static StageArray stages_;
};
 The problem here is that the class and instance levels are getting jumbled up (static vs virtual). The states need to inherit from AppState, but - how I'd imagine - most of them would be classes with all-static members, or, at least I won't need more than one instance from one class (TitleState, LevelIntroState, PlayingState, GameOverState, EndSequenceState, EditorState... - pausing would no longer be a state, rather than being taken care of in the states where it makes sense). How can it be done elegantly and efficiently?
@CODE:class Game
{
  enum AppStates
  {
    APP_STARTING,
    APP_TITLE,
    APP_NEWGAME,
    APP_NEWLEVEL,
    APP_PLAYING,
    APP_PAUSED,
    APP_ENDED
  };

  typedef AppState(Game::*StateFn)();
  typedef std::vector<StateFn> StateFnArray;

  void Run()
  {
    // StateFn's to be registered here

    AppState lastState(APP_STARTING);
    while(lastState != APP_ENDED)
    {
      lastState = GetCycle_(lastState);
    }
    // cleanup
  }

  // define StateFn's here

  AppState GetCycle_(AppState a)
  {
    // pick StateFn based on passed variable, call it and return its result.
  }

  StateFnArray states_;
}; struct AppState
{
  enum { LAST_STATE = -1; }
  typedef int StateID;
  typedef std::vector<AppState*> StateArray;

  static bool Add(AppState *state, StateID desiredID);
  // return false if desiredID is an id already assigned to

  static void Execute(StateID state)
  {
    while(id != LAST_STATE)
    {
      // bounds check etc.
      states_[id]->Execute();
    }
  }

  AppState() {};

 I can use this to find a target node in the graph. The worklist dequeues (or pops) the items as the worklist is processed. Once I find the target how can I return the full path to the node? Update I am trying to figure out how to reverse the path to the root. The method is called on the root node, after that, children may have two parents, so it isn't as simple as calling the parent property on each node and traversing back up. The goal of the method is to find the path, not to iterate all nodes, or to check if a node does exist.

The Filesystem library is not a header-only library. I have been following the Getting Started on Windows guide posted on the official boost web page. Here are the steps I have taken: I used bjam to build the complete set of lib files using: bjam --build-dir="C:\Program Files\boost\build-boost" --toolset=msvc --build-type=complete
 I copied the /libs directory (located in C:\Program Files\boost\build-boost\boost\bin.v2) to C:\Program Files\boost\boost_1_37_0\libs. In Visual C++, under Project > Properties > Additional Library Directories I added these paths: C:\Program Files\boost\boost_1_37_0\libs C:\Program Files\boost\boost_1_37_0\libs\filesystem\build\msvc-9.0express\debug\link-static\threading-multi I added the second one out of desperation. It is the exact directory where libboost_system-vc90-mt-gd-1_37.lib resides. In Configuration Properties > C/C++ > General > Additional Include Directories I added the following path: C:\Program Files\boost\boost_1_37_0 Then, to put the icing on the cake, under Tools > Options VC++ Directories > Library files, I added the same directories mentioned in step 3. Despite all this, when I build my project I get the following error: fatal error LNK1104: cannot open file 'libboost_system-vc90-mt-gd-1_37.lib'
 Additionally, here is the code that I am attempting to compile as well as a screen shot of the aformentioned directory where the (assumedly correct) lib file resides: #include "boost/filesystem.hpp"   // includes all needed Boost.Filesystem declarations

There have been similar discussions on "fuzzy matching," but I'm not really interested in phonetic matching. I'm interested in what I'd call ordered-subset-matching. I would like it to work akin to QuickSilver (OSX) or Launchy (Windows). Here are a few examples of matches for a given search string: mit ? Massachusetts Institute of Technology ffox ? Fire**fox** osx ? Mac OS X ms ? Micro**s**oft Corporation My end goal is to have a web page with an auto-completing text field that's data driven from the server. I'm confident I'll get adequate results on the client side by combining features from jQuery LiveUpdate and/or jQuery QuickSelect. Where I need help is in how to best handle the flex match on the server side against a large table. I have some ideas in how to build my own custom index using the Quicksilver scoring algorithm and maybe some permutation index logic, but I'd rather not re-invent the wheel if something else if readily available. In summary: What is the best way to gain a fast flex match against a database table with many rows?

@TITLE:Linq2Sql Many:Many question, How would you do this?
@CONTENT:I know many:many isn't supported in Linq2Sql but I am working on a workaround I am working with my little SO clone and I have a table with Questions and a table with Tags and a linking table QuestionTag so I have a classic many:many relationship between Questions and Tags. To display the list of Questions on the front page I have this class I want to fill up from a Linq2Sql query public class ListQuestion
{
   public int QuestionID { get; set; }
   public string Title{ get; set; }
   public IEnumerable<Tag> Tags { get; set; }
}


public IEnumerable<ListQuestion> GetQuestions()
{
   from q in Questions
   .................
   select new ListQuestion{ ... }
}
 The problem is how should I fill up the Tag collection. I found out this isn't possible to do in 1 single query so I have divided this into 2 queries, 1 to get the questions and 1 to get the tags and later try to join them. I know many:many is supported in Entity framework so how do they do it? How would you do this? Any alternative approach? The query should of course be efficient.
@CODE:public class ListQuestion
{
   public int QuestionID { get; set; }
   public string Title{ get; set; }
   public IEnumerable<Tag> Tags { get; set; }
}


public IEnumerable<ListQuestion> GetQuestions()
{
   from q in Questions
   .................
   select new ListQuestion{ ... }

@TITLE:CruiseControl.net ¡X How to checkin code during the build
@CONTENT:I'm setting up CruiseControl.NET and during the build I want to modify my version.txt file and have it checked in. When I do this, CruiseControl.NET doesn't know this checkin was done by the build and so the next time it checks sources, it sees there were modifications and rebuilds again (I have IfModificationExists set in the project build). How do I tell CruiseControl.NET to check this file in or let it know that this one is OK so it doesn't keep re-triggering builds?

@LINK:/questions/117751/spring-jta-transactionmanager-config-supporting-both-tomcat-and-jboss
@TITLE:Spring JTA TransactionManager config: Supporting both Tomcat and JBoss
@CONTENT:I have a web application using JPA and JTA with Spring. I would like to support both JBoss and Tomcat. When running on JBoss, I'd like to use JBoss' own TransactionManager, and when running on Tomcat, I'd like to use JOTM. I have both scenarios working, but I now find that I seem to need two separate Spring configurations for the two cases. With JOTM, I need to use Spring's JotmFactoryBean: <bean id="transactionManager" 
 class="org.springframework.transaction.jta.JtaTransactionManager">
    <property name="userTransaction">
        <bean class="org.springframework.transaction.jta.JotmFactoryBean"/>
    </property>
</bean>
 In JBoss, though, I just need to fetch "TransactionManager" from JNDI: <bean id="transactionManager" 
 class="org.springframework.transaction.jta.JtaTransactionManager">
    <property name="transactionManager">
        <bean class="org.springframework.jndi.JndiObjectFactoryBean">
             <property name="resourceRef" value="true" />
             <property name="jndiName" value="TransactionManager" />
             <property name="expectedType" 
               value="javax.transaction.TransactionManager" />
        </bean>
    </property>
</bean>
 Is there a way to configure this so that the appropriate TransactionManager - JBoss or JOTM - is used, without the need for two different configuration files?
@CODE:JotmFactoryBean <bean id="transactionManager" 
 class="org.springframework.transaction.jta.JtaTransactionManager">
    <property name="userTransaction">
        <bean class="org.springframework.transaction.jta.JotmFactoryBean"/>

             <property name="expectedType"

@TITLE:How to do Flash pseudo-streaming?
@CONTENT:I need to build something that starts serving a H.264 encoded video to a flash player halfway through the file (to support skipping to a point in the video that has not been buffered yet). Currently, the videos are in the FLV container format, but transcoding is an option. I managed to re-write the file header and metadata information for a given byte offset. This works for older videos, but not for H.264 encoded files. I suspect this is because the video tags inside the file also have to be altered, which is not feasible (it would take too much processing power). What is the "proper" way to do it?

@TITLE:Simple audio input API on a Mac?
@CONTENT:I'd like to pull a stream of PCM samples from a Mac's line-in or built-in mic and do a little live analysis (the exact nature doesn't pertain to this question, but it could be an FFT every so often, or some basic statistics on the sample levels, or what have you). What's a good fit for this? Writing an AudioUnit that just passes the sound through and incidentally hands it off somewhere for analysis? Writing a JACK-aware app and figuring out how to get it to play with the JACK server? Ecasound? This is a cheesy proof-of-concept hobby project, so simplicity of API is the driving factor (followed by reasonable choice of programming language).

@TITLE:How to run recurring task in the Python Flask framework?
@CONTENT:I'm building a website which provides some information to the visitors. This information is aggregated in the background by polling a couple external APIs every 5 seconds. The way I have it working now is that I use APScheduler jobs. I initially preferred APScheduler because it makes the whole system more easy to port (since I don't need to set cron jobs on the new machine). I start the polling functions as follows: from apscheduler.scheduler import Scheduler

@app.before_first_request
def initialize():
    apsched = Scheduler()
    apsched.start()

    apsched.add_interval_job(checkFirstAPI, seconds=5)
    apsched.add_interval_job(checkSecondAPI, seconds=5)
    apsched.add_interval_job(checkThirdAPI, seconds=5)
 This kinda works, but there's some trouble with it: For starters, this means that the interval-jobs are running outside of the Flask context. So far this hasn't been much of a problem, but when calling an endpoint fails I want the system to send me an email (saying "hey calling API X failed"). Because it doesn't run within the Flask context however, it complaints that flask-mail cannot be executed (RuntimeError('working outside of application context')). Secondly, I wonder how this is going to behave when I don't use the Flask built-in debug server anymore, but a production server with lets say 4 workers. Will it start every job four times then? All in all I feel that there should be a better way of running these recurring tasks, but I'm unsure how. Does anybody out there have an interesting solution to this problem? All tips are welcome! [EDIT] I've just been reading about Celery with its schedules. Although I don't really see how Celery is different from APScheduler and whether it could thus solve my two points, I wonder if anyone reading this thinks that I should investigate more in Celery?
@CODE:from apscheduler.scheduler import Scheduler

@app.before_first_request
def initialize():
    apsched = Scheduler()
    apsched.start()

    apsched.add_interval_job(checkFirstAPI, seconds=5)
    apsched.add_interval_job(checkSecondAPI, seconds=5)

@TITLE:Mobile app: how to show the OTP my app sends in a popup without leaving my app?
@CONTENT:We've had to code an OTP based authentication. I have seen some apps, like my bank's app, which when it sends the OTP also then immediately does a quick popup of the SMS that has just arrived, so I can see the OTP without leaving the app. I just memorize the number, close the popup, and get on with the login inside that app. How do they do that? Is there some iOS/Android spec I should be looking at, which allows us to similarly popup the OTP without the user having to go to the SMS screen, then come back to our app? Thanks! EDIT: I have very useful Android suggestions. Now looking for iOS variations of these recommendations. Understand iOS has much more stringent sandboxing limitations, so the "listener" may be more complex?

@TITLE:Using elasticsearch-river-mysql to stream data from MySQL database to Elasticsearch
@CONTENT:I want to use elasticsearch-river-mysql in order to continuously transfer data from MySQL database to ElasticSearch. I'm beginner with ES and rivers so I hope you can help me out with my questions. From what I know, the data will be streamed from the MySQL database to the ES cluster which will index it automatically. Is that correct? Are there any timeouts or limits I have to be aware of? How the foreign key relations between the relational database tables will be translated into ES? Will the table row containing the foreign key become an inner object for an ES document or some other relation between the ES documents will be used? Are there any disadvantages in using this river for the mentioned above purpose? What will be the load on ES by implementing this? I assume that ES is powerful enough, but still I was wondering. Will the searches made on the ES cluster be affected anyhow in this scenario?

@TITLE:Finding the longest repeated substring without suffix arrays or suffix trees
@CONTENT:The longest repeated substring problem is the following: Given a string w, find the longest substring of w that appears in at least two locations. This problem can be solved in linear time using suffix trees and in linear time using enhanced suffix arrays. My question is this - are there any linear-time algorithms for this problem that do not involve suffix trees or suffix arrays? I'm curious because suffix trees and suffix arrays are famously difficult to code up and manipulate and it would be nice if there were an algorithm for this problem that didn't require the coding or memory overhead of these other structures. Thanks!

@LINK:/questions/20976946/dynamically-generating-product-flavors
@TITLE:Dynamically generating product flavors
@CONTENT:I've created an Android App which needs to be build in many (30+) flavors. My idea was to generate the different productFlavors directly from the folder structure in my src directory, since the configuration is always very similar (basically just another packageName, a new launcher icon and some strings change). The src folder look like this: ¢|¢w¢w src
    ¢u¢w¢w flavor1
    ¢x?? ¢u¢w¢w flavor2.keystore
    ¢x?? ¢u¢w¢w res
    ¢u¢w¢w flavor2
    ¢x?? ¢u¢w¢w res
    ¢x?? ¢u¢w¢w flavor2.keystore    
    ¢|¢w¢w main
     ?? ¢u¢w¢w AndroidManifest.xml
     ?? ¢u¢w¢w java
     ?? ¢|¢w¢w res
 If I had to create the gradle properties by hand it would look somehow like this: android {

    ....

    productFlavors {
        flavor1 {
            packageName 'com.example.flavor1'
        }
        flavor2 {
            packageName 'com.example.flavor2'
        }
    }

}
 Everytime I try to change the productFlavors configuration after its creation I get either an error or the changes / additions are ignored silently. This could a be problem caused by me, because my Gradle / Groovy experience is very limited, or this isn't possible. I mostly get error, saying that GroupableProductFlavorDsl_Decorated could not be manipulated the way I want. What I'm trying to archive should somehow look like this: android {

    ....

    def flavors = getMyFlavorsFromFileSystem()

    productFlavors {

    }

    flavors.each { name, config ->
        productFlavors[name] << config
    }

}
 Note: I know this question is basically an duplicate of an older question, which sadly was never answered. Since Gradle is kind of new to the Android world, I'm hoping to get more answers as since the last time the question was asked, because more developers are using Gradle now. Update: Here some very simple approaches I tried: Variant 1: android {

    productFlavors {

    }

    productFlavors['flavor1'] << {
        packageName "com.example.flavor1"
    }

    productFlavors['flavor2'] << {
        packageName "com.example.flavor2"
    }
}

/*

> GroupableProductFlavorDsl with name 'flavor1' not found.

*/
 Variant 2: android {

    productFlavors {

    }

    productFlavors['flavor1'] = {
        packageName "com.example.flavor1"
    }

    productFlavors['flavor2'] = {
        packageName "com.example.flavor2"
    }
}

/*

*/
 ** Variant 3:** android {

    productFlavors {

    }

    productFlavors['flavor1'] = [packageName: "com.example.flavor1"]

    productFlavors['flavor2'] = [packageName: "com.example.flavor2"]
}

 All of them as a Gist.

@TITLE:GL error from OpenGLRenderer: 0x502
@CONTENT:Our code is performing very simple operations on a Canvas (entirely in UI thread): drawText, translate, save, restore. Occasionally, we get this (on Nexus 4 running 4.3): W/Adreno200-ES20(22118): <gl_draw_error_checks:550>: GL_INVALID_OPERATION
D/OpenGLRenderer(22118): GL error from OpenGLRenderer: 0x502
E/OpenGLRenderer(22118):   GL_INVALID_OPERATION
 and the corresponding text is not drawn to the canvas. One problem is that it happens randomly. The code will work without error for maybe 10-20 calls, then there will be this error, then back to working normally for another 10-20 calls before the error again.

@TITLE:CSS: -webkit-mask-image
@CONTENT:I'm using the CSS property -webkit-mask-image
 To apply a mask over an image. However, in chrome, the mask moves as you scroll the image off the page. How do you prevent the mask from moving? Or is it a rendering artifact? JSFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/DZTvR/ (Scroll down on the frame with the map in it).

@TITLE:Serving files stored in S3 in express/nodejs app
@CONTENT:I have app where user's photos are private. I store the photos(thumbnails also) in AWS s3. There is a page in the site where user can view his photos(i.e thumbnails). Now my problem is how do I serve these files. Some options that I have evaluated are: Serving files from CloudFront(or AWS) using signed url generation. But the problem is every time the user refreshes the page I have to create so many signed urls again and load it. So therefore I wont be able to cache the Images in the browser which would have been a good choice. Is there anyway to do still in javascript? I cant have the validity of those urls for longer due to security issues. And secondly within that time frame if someone got hold of that url he can view the file without running through authentication from the app. Other option is to serve the file from my express app itself after streaming it from S3 servers. This allows me to have http cache headers, therefore enable browser caching. It also makes sure no can view a file without being authenticated. Ideally I would like to stream the file and a I am hosting using NGINX proxy relay the other side streaming to NGINX. But as i see that can only be posible if the file exist in the same system's files. But here I have to stream it and return when i get the stream is complete. Dont want to store the files locally. I am not able to evaluate which of the two options would be a better choice?? I want to redirect as much work as possible to S3 or cloudfront but even using singed urls also makes the request first to my servers. I also want caching features. So what would be ideal way to do? with the answers for the particular questions pertaining to those methods?

@TITLE:How to remove only html tags in a string using javascript
@CONTENT:I want to remove html tags from given string using javascript. I looked into current approaches but there are some unsolved problems occured with them. Current solutions (1) Using javascript, creating virtual div tag and get the text   function remove_tags(html)
  {
       var tmp = document.createElement("DIV");
       tmp.innerHTML = html; 
       return tmp.textContent||tmp.innerText; 
  }
 (2) Using regex   function remove_tags(html)
  {
       return html.replace(/<(?:.|\n)*?>/gm, '');
  }
 (3) Using JQuery   function remove_tags(html)
  {
       return jQuery(html).text();
  }
 These three solutions are working correctly, but if the string is like this   <div> hello <hi all !> </div>
 stripped string is like hello . But I need only remove html tags only. like hello <hi all !> Edited: Background is, I want to remove all the user input html tags for a particular text area. But I want to allow users to enter <hi all> kind of text. In current approach, its remove any content which include within <>.
@CODE:function remove_tags(html)
  {
       var tmp = document.createElement("DIV");
       tmp.innerHTML = html; 
       return tmp.textContent||tmp.innerText; 
  } function remove_tags(html)
  {
       return html.replace(/<(?:.|\n)*?>/gm, '');
  } function remove_tags(html)
  {
       return jQuery(html).text();
  } <div> hello <hi all !> </div> hello hello <hi all !> <hi all>

P.S. I'm using selenium Firefox driver to scrape data from some other website but that solution is not good because selenium Firefox driver is dependent on FireFox's EXE i.e Firefox must be installed before running the scraper. Selenium Firefox driver is consuming around 100MB memory for one instance and my requirement is to run a lot of instances at a time to make the scraping process quick so there is memory limitation as well. Firefox crashes sometimes during the execution of scraper, don't know why. Also I need window less scraping which is not possible in case of Selenium Firefox driver. My ultimate goal is to run the scrapers on Heroku and I have Linux environment over there so selenium Firefox driver won't work on Heroku. Thanks

@CONTENT:So far as I understand it, messages are associated with commits. But when you look at a repo on GitHub it helpfully lists the message by each file, for when it was last changed. I'd like to replicate that in a web view of a repo I have. Looking at the GitHub api it looks to me the only way to get that info is to download all the commits (which can be paged), and work from the most recent ones assigning commit messages to the files in your local cache, going further and further back until you've got the message for every file, potentially to the very first commit, if any of the files have not been changed since the initial commit Question is, is that the right way to do it? Is that not going to kill even the 5000/hr quota?

Function bye

}

Write-Host "PowerShell sample says hello."
 and the Python script: import argparse
import subprocess as sp

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Sample call to PowerShell function from Python')
parser.add_argument('--functionToCall', metavar='-f', default='hello', help='Specify function to run')

args = parser.parse_args()

psResult = sp.Popen([r'C:\WINDOWS\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe',

output, error = psResult.communicate()
rc = psResult.returncode

print "Return code given to Python script is: " + str(rc)
print "\n\nstdout:\n\n" + str(output)
print "\n\nstderr: " + str(error)
 So, somehow, I want to run the 'hello()' or the 'bye()' function that is in the PowerShell sample. It would also be nice to know how to pass in parameters to the function. Thanks!

@TITLE:eBay API to download user listing (eBay API user guide / step by step guide)
@CONTENT:I am new to the eBay API and currently developing in PHP, I have managed to use GetItem to import details of an order based on the Item ID to my website's database. But What I want to do now is to link a users account to my website and import their listings to my database. I have put the code I used for GetItem (below) but now I am stuck and I don't know what to use, GetAccount, GetUser or GetSellerList to: First: have my user redirected from my website to eBay to authorize my application to access his/her listings. Second: Import that listing (an echo would be enough for now) to my website. This is my code for GetItem:      require_once('keys.php');
     require_once('eBaySession.php');

    if(isset($_POST['Id']))
    {
        //Get the ItemID inputted
        $id = $_POST['Id'];

        $siteID = 101;

@LINK:/questions/13885454/mono-on-osx-couldnt-find-gtksharpglue-2-dll
@TITLE:Mono on OSX: Couldn't find gtksharpglue-2.dll
@CONTENT:I'm trying to do my first steps in C# and wanted to build an empty GTK window as my first task. Via macports I installed the following packages: mono@2.10.9 gtk-sharp@1.0.10 gtk-sharp2@2.12.10 I also use MonoDevelop from the Mono homepage. I added gtk-sharp.dll (from /opt/local/lib/mono/gtk-sharp-2.0) to my references. My code looks like this: using System;
using Gtk;

namespace lolbr_client
{
    class MainClass
    {
        public static void Main (string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Loading..");
            Window window = new Window("test");
        }
    }
}
 When I compile and run that snippet, it seems to find and include the GTK-library, it prints "Loading.." to the console, but the line after Console.WriteLine() causes this error: System.DllNotFoundException: gtksharpglue-2
  at (wrapper managed-to-native) Gtk.Container:gtksharp_gtk_container_get_focus_child_offset ()
  at Gtk.Container..cctor () [0x00000] in <filename unknown>:0
 While that particular .dll doesn't exist on my filesystem, a quick locate gtksharpglue-2 revealed the following files: /Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/2.10.9/lib/libgtksharpglue-2.so
/opt/local/lib/libgtksharpglue-2.a
/opt/local/lib/libgtksharpglue-2.la
/opt/local/lib/libgtksharpglue-2.so
 Do those files help me? What are the next steps from here to debug/fix this? I already searched Google, but either I am too new to this subject to recognize useful information, or useful information just doesn't exist. Can someone help me? Thanks in advance!

@LINK:/questions/13221736/android-device-not-receiving-multicast-package
@TITLE:Android device not receiving multicast package
@CONTENT:I am developing a chat application where Android clients will exchange their IP's using multicasting(UDP). Every device will send its ip to multiple clients(all the devices running this app) in one separate Thread. There will be another receiver thread which will listen to these multicast packets. Here is my code. //Multicasting code. DatagramSocket socket = new DatagramSocket(9898);
            byte buff[] = ip.getBytes();
            DatagramPacket packet = new DatagramPacket(buff, buff.length, InetAddress.getByName("224.0.0.1"),9999);
            socket.send(packet);
            socket.close();
 //Receiver code MulticastSocket socket = new MulticastSocket(9999);
        InetAddress group = InetAddress.getByName("224.0.0.1");
        socket.joinGroup(group);

        DatagramPacket packet;

            byte[] buf = new byte[256];
            byte  b = 'x'; //just a separator for time being
            Arrays.fill(buf,b);
            packet = new DatagramPacket(buf, buf.length);
            String received= "";
            while(received!=null)
            {
                socket.receive(packet);
                received = new String(packet.getData());
                received = received.substring(0,received.indexOf('x'));
                this.setIp(received);
                System.out.println("Address: " + received);
            }

        socket.leaveGroup(group);
        socket.close();
 The problem is every device prints its own address. It seems it never listens to other multicast packages(I mean it should print other ip's as well). I also get a below log, not sure if that's related. 11-04 23:56:17.985: I/OSNetworkSystem(603): mcastAddDropMembership interfaceIndex=0
 Any help will be appreciated.

@CONTENT:I have an ember app and the concept of the outlet and connecting the outlet is fine, I get that. What I don't understand is how to have more than one view/controller view inside of another one without insane nesting Suppose I am designing icloud clone where I have email functionality and a photo gallery functionality. Now if I wanted to accomplish something like ***********************************************************
* INBOX LIST     **  COMPOSE OR VIEW MESSAGE              *
*                **                                       *
*                **                                       *
*                **                                       *
*                **                                       *
* CONTACTS LIST  **                                       *
*                **                                       *
*                **                                       *
*                **                                       *
*                **                                       *
***********************************************************
 The way that I would want to design this would be something like EmailController/View
|-- SplitViewController/View
   |-- InboxListController/View
   |-- ContactsListController/View
   |-- ComposeMessageController/View
   |-- ReadMessageController/View
 Where I can hot swap these to the level of the SplitView or remove them alltogether, but I don't see a good way of doing this with only one outlet allowed. It would force me next things inside of things that should not be nested. Using the single outlet approach, my structure would look more like EmailController/View
|-- SplitViewController/View
   |-- InboxListController/View
       |-- ContactsListController/View
           |-- ComposeMessageController/View
               |-- ReadMessageController/View
 How would I find an architecture style that fits with Ember.js/Router that still allows for more complex nesting?

@TITLE:How can apache be allowed to send email?
@CONTENT:I have a CentOS 6.2 virtual machine running Apache 2.2 and PHP 5.3 that I'm trying to send email from via PHP's mail() function. I can send email from the CLI without problems but when PHP tries it fails. In the sendmail log is the following: Oct  9 11:42:03 localhost sendmail[3080]: NOQUEUE: SYSERR(apache): can not chdir(/var/spool/clientmqueue/): Permission denied
 It seems like Apache doesn't have permission to do this but I'm not sure how to fix it. I've found a lot discussion about this but nothing specific enough to what I'm doing that I could use. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!

@TITLE:Symfony 2 Embedded Form Collection Many to Many
@CONTENT:I have 2 Entities - User and Group. They have a many-to-many relationship and Group is used to store a users' roles. I'm trying to make a User edit form by adding a collection, I want to be able to add a new role by selecting it from a dropdown (limited to what's already in the DB) UserType.php: class UserType extends AbstractType
{
    public function buildForm(FormBuilderInterface $builder, array $options)
    {
        $builder
            ->add('username')
            ->add('email')
            ->add('forename')
            ->add('surname')
            ->add('isActive')
            ->add('joinDate', 'date', array('input' => 'datetime', 'format' => 'dd-MM-yyyy'))
            ->add('lastActive', 'date', array('input' => 'datetime', 'format' => 'dd-MM-yyyy'))
            ->add('groups', 'collection', array(
                    'type' => new GroupType(),
                    'allow_add' => true,
                    ))
        ;
    }

    public function setDefaultOptions(OptionsResolverInterface $resolver)
    {
        $resolver->setDefaults(array(
            'data_class' => 'Sfox\CoreBundle\Entity\User'
        ));
    }
}
 and GroupType.php: class GroupType extends AbstractType
{
    public function buildForm(FormBuilderInterface $builder, array $options)
    {
        $builder
            ->add('name')
            ->add('role');
    }

    public function setDefaultOptions(OptionsResolverInterface $resolver)
    {
        $resolver->setDefaults(array(
                "data_class" => 'Sfox\CoreBundle\Entity\Group'
                ));
    }
}
 This displays the roles in the form in basic text boxes, but if I add an entry to the form, it will cascade persist a new entry into Groups and if I were to edit an entry, it would change the underlying Group data. I tried making a GroupSelectType.php: class GroupSelectType extends AbstractType
{
    public function buildForm(FormBuilderInterface $builder, array $options)
    {
        $builder
            ->add('role', 'entity', array('class'=>'SfoxCoreBundle:Group', 'property'=>'name'));
    }

    public function setDefaultOptions(OptionsResolverInterface $resolver)
    {
        $resolver->setDefaults(array(
                "data_class" => 'Sfox\CoreBundle\Entity\Group'
                ));
    }
}
 Adding the field as an "entity" type, this displays the correct select box (but with the default values) I cant seem to bind it to the UserType form! All I want the form to do is modify the underlying 'groups' ArrayCollection in the User entity. Does anyone know how I can achieve this?
@CODE:class UserType extends AbstractType
{
    public function buildForm(FormBuilderInterface $builder, array $options)
    {
        $builder
            ->add('username')
            ->add('email')
            ->add('forename')
            ->add('surname')
            ->add('isActive')
            ->add('joinDate', 'date', array('input' => 'datetime', 'format' => 'dd-MM-yyyy'))
            ->add('lastActive', 'date', array('input' => 'datetime', 'format' => 'dd-MM-yyyy'))
            ->add('groups', 'collection', array(
                    'type' => new GroupType(),
                    'allow_add' => true,
                    ))
        ;
    }

    public function setDefaultOptions(OptionsResolverInterface $resolver)
    {
        $resolver->setDefaults(array(
            'data_class' => 'Sfox\CoreBundle\Entity\User'
        ));
    }
} class GroupType extends AbstractType
{
    public function buildForm(FormBuilderInterface $builder, array $options)
    {
        $builder
            ->add('name')
            ->add('role');
    }

@LINK:/questions/12078812/how-to-choose-oo-design-patterns-for-javascript
@TITLE:How to choose OO design patterns for JavaScript
@CONTENT:By OO I mean classical OO. I keep going back and forth between defining my "classes" ( javascript does not have traditional classes ) using the module pattern to provide privacy and using object literals to create a collection of "public statics". I have no guiding force when I create "classes" that lets me determine what type of organization to use. Well, besides the fact that my code passes both jshint and jslint w/ no options set. I'm working w/ about 1500 lines of code so I need a "guiding force" before the code becomes un-manageable and I have to scrap it. I am well aware of the different ways to write "classes" in JavaScript. Those taught by JavaScript Web Applications written by Alex MacCaw as well as the numerous ways listed here on SO. However, application wise, I just don't know what method to use. The simplest seems to be a collection of methods and variables in an object literal like this: var public_statics = {
    public_func: function () {},
    public_var: "hello"
}
 and the most complicated seems to be - an IIFE. (function(){
    var private_var;
    function private_func(){
    }
})();
 How do I know which one to use or the multitude of in-between variations? For a concrete example: How about for a controller in the MVC. Currently ( and some what randomly chosen), I implement a controller like this: var Co = {};
Co.Controller = function(){
    // 'classes' from Mo are called here
    // 'classes' from Su are called here
}
 then I tack on other Control related method to Co. How do I choose what style of OO to use? Updated My library is currently divided between 4 namespaces: var Mo = {},
    Vi = {},

@LINK:/questions/11317813/android-phonegap-timeout-error-when-trying-to-set-a-webviewclient
@TITLE:Android Phonegap - TIMEOUT ERROR when trying to set a WebViewClient
@CONTENT:I'm working with Android and Phonegap, and at the moment I'm having trouble with one simple thing. I need to setup a webViewClient to the PhoneGap webView in order to capture the URL of a page finished and to work with that. This is the code: public class PhoneGapTest extends DroidGap {

    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)
    {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        super.setBooleanProperty("loadInWebView", true);
        super.clearCache();
        super.keepRunning = false; 
        super.loadUrl("file:///android_asset/www/index.html");

        super.appView.setWebViewClient(new WebViewClient(){

          @Override
          public void onPageStarted(WebView view, String url, Bitmap bitmap) {

            Log.i("TEST", "onPageStarted: " + url);

          }

          @Override
          public void onPageFinished(WebView view, String url) {

            Log.i("TEST", "onPageFinished: " + url);

          }

        });

    }
 That code doesn't seems to work, the page never loads and I get a TIMEOUT ERROR, but if I remove the "setWebViewClient" part the page loads perfectly. I saw that there is a class CordovaWebViewClient, do I have to use that instead of WebViewClient? I found this way on the web:         this.appView.setWebViewClient(new CordovaWebViewClient(this){

          @Override
          public boolean shouldOverrideUrlLoading(final WebView view, String url) { 
            Log.i("BugTest", "shouldOverrideUrlLoading: " + url); 
            return true; 
          }

          @Override
          public void onPageStarted(WebView view, String url, Bitmap bitmap) {

            Log.i("TEST", "onPageStarted: " + url);

          }

          @Override
          public void onPageFinished(WebView view, String url) {

            Log.i("TEST", "onPageFinished: " + url);

          }

          @Override
          public void doUpdateVisitedHistory(WebView view, String url, boolean isReload){        
          }

        });
 But that code isn't working either, I still got a TIMEOUT ERROR. I also saw that there is already a webVieClient member, but I don't if I have to use it and how.

@TITLE:Index a MySQL database with Apache Lucene, and keep them synchronized
@CONTENT:When a new item is added in MySQL, it must be also indexed by Lucene. When an existing item is removed from MySQL, it must be also removed from Lucene's index. The idea is to write a script that will be called every x minutes via a scheduler (e.g. a CRON task). This is a way to keep MySQL and Lucene synchronized. What I managed until yet: For each new added item in MySQL, Lucene indexes it too. For each already added item in MySQL, Lucene does not reindex it (no duplicated items). This is the point I'm asking you some help to manage: For each previously added item that has been then removed from MySQL, Lucene should also unindex it. Here is the code I used, which tries to index a MySQL table tag (id [PK] | name): public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

    Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver").newInstance();
    Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost/mydb", "root", "");
    StandardAnalyzer analyzer = new StandardAnalyzer(Version.LUCENE_36);
    IndexWriterConfig config = new IndexWriterConfig(Version.LUCENE_36, analyzer);
    IndexWriter writer = new IndexWriter(FSDirectory.open(INDEX_DIR), config);

    String query = "SELECT id, name FROM tag";
    Statement statement = connection.createStatement();
    ResultSet result = statement.executeQuery(query);

    while (result.next()) {
        Document document = new Document();
        document.add(new Field("id", result.getString("id"), Field.Store.YES, Field.Index.NOT_ANALYZED));
        document.add(new Field("name", result.getString("name"), Field.Store.NO, Field.Index.ANALYZED));
        writer.updateDocument(new Term("id", result.getString("id")), document);
    }

    writer.close();

}
 PS: this code is for tests purpose only, no need to tell me how awful it is :) EDIT: One solution could be to delete any previsouly added document, and reindex all the database: writer.deleteAll();
while (result.next()) {
    Document document = new Document();
    document.add(new Field("id", result.getString("id"), Field.Store.YES, Field.Index.NOT_ANALYZED));
    document.add(new Field("name", result.getString("name"), Field.Store.NO, Field.Index.ANALYZED));
    writer.addDocument(document);
}

@TITLE:Relational Integrity and Validation in Core Data iCloud Syncing
@CONTENT:Consider the following simple entity model: Entity A has a to-one relationship to Entity B called b. Entity B has an inverse to-one relationship called a. Neither relationship is optional. A            B
b  < ----- > a
 Assume we have two devices (1) and (2) that begin fully synced. Each has one object of class A, and one object of class B, and they are associated with one another. On device 1, we have objects A1 and B1, and on device B we have the same logical objects A1 and B1. Now assume that simulateous changes are made on each device: On device 1, we delete B1, insert B2, and associate A1 with B2. Then save changes. On device 2, we delete B1, insert B3, and associate A1 with B3. Then save changes. Device 1 now attempts to import the transaction logs from device 2. B3 will be inserted, and A1 will be associated with B3. So far so good, but B2 is now left with relationship a equal to nil. The a relationship is non-optional, so a validation error occurs. Something similar will occur on device 2, because there are two B objects, and only one A object to be associated with. There must thus always be a validation error, because one of B objects must have an a relationship set to nil. Even worse, any future change will always leave an errant B object hanging around, and so will fail validation. In effect, the user cannot fix the problem themselves by resetting the relationship. It is permanently broken. The question is, how can you address a validation error like this? This all happens before the NSPersistentStoreDidImportUbiquitousContentChangesNotification notification is triggered. It is not a validation error in your apps main NSManagedObjectContext, it is a validation error that occurs during the initial import of transaction logs into the persistent store. The only option I can think of is perhaps to try to delete the invalid B object in a custom setter (setA:), or in a KVC validation method (validateA:error:) on the B class itself, because these do seem to be triggered during the transaction log import. But I'm not sure that side effects like these are allowed, and when I try it, it does seem to result in nasty log messages to that effect. Anyone know what the right way to handle this is?

@TITLE:Recognize images in Python
@CONTENT:I'm kinda new both to OCR recognition and Python. What I'm trying to achieve is to run Tesseract from a Python script to 'recognize' some particular figures in a .tif. I thought I could do some training for Tesseract but I didn't find any similar topic on Google and here at SO. Basically I have some .tif that contains several images (like an 'arrow', a 'flower' and other icons), and I want the script to print as output the name of that icon. If it finds an arrow then print 'arrow'. Is it feasible?

 However, this does not place a marker on the center. I want to place some kind of marker at the the point I start with (and optionally some kind of name for it). Any idea how this can be achieved?

@TITLE:dynamic start_urls in scrapy
@CONTENT:I'm using scrapy to crawl multiple pages on a site. The variable start_urls is used to define pages to be crawled. I would initially start with 1st page, thus defining start_urls = [1st page] in the file example_spider.py Upon getting more info from 1st page, I would determine what are next pages to be crawled, then would assign start_urls accordingly. Hence, I have to overwrite above example_spider.py with changes to start_urls = [1st page, 2nd page, ..., Kth page], then run scrapy crawl again. Is that the best approach or is there a better way to dynamically assign start_urls using scrapy API without having to overwrite example_splider.py? Thanks.

Do users deliver us their public keys and we authenticate against them? Do we need to sign / provision each user individually using our own certicate?

@TITLE:Self-restarting MathKernel - is it possible in Mathematica?
@CONTENT:This question comes from the recent question "Correct way to cap Mathematica memory use?" I wonder, is it possible to programmatically restart MathKernel keeping the current FrontEnd process connected to new MathKernel process and evaluating some code in new MathKernel session? I mean a "transparent" restart which allows a user to continue working with the FrontEnd while having new fresh MathKernel process with some code from the previous kernel evaluated/evaluating in it? The motivation for the question is to have a way to automatize restarting of MathKernel when it takes too much memory without breaking the computation. In other words, the computation should be automatically continued in new MathKernel process without interaction with the user (but keeping the ability for user to interact with the Mathematica as it was originally). The details on what code should be evaluated in new kernel are of course specific for each computational task. I am looking for a general solution how to automatically continue the computation.

@CONTENT:I am doing a small research on Unit Testing of EJB 3.1. At the end my goal is to produce a easy to use solution for Unit Testing EJB 3.1. I do not have much knowledge with big EJB implementations and hence I would like to first get some experienced hands (You) to just pool in your ideas on what is difficult in Unit Testing EJBs. With the initial research I have already done, I can understand the advantages of using mocking frameworks for Unit Testing rather than using embedded containers. Though both are good, mocking frameworks stands a little above when it comes to Unit Testing. The embedded containers are ofcourse very good and have their own advantages, but may be a different phase of unit testing. I still believe that there should be some shortfalls at least in some scenarios in using such frameworks which can be improved. I hope I could make a complete solution for Unit Testing EJB which I can share in this forum once done. Thanks for your support.

@TITLE:How can I draw an animated view in android?
@CONTENT:I created a custom view from scratch. Extended View and overrided onDraw(). When comes down in animating the view i generate a custom animation using offsets. eg. while(!isOnTop){
mOffset++;

//draw the component a a it higher using the offset

if(position == 0)
isOnTop==true;
invalidate();

}
 The thinking is that my frames come from invalidate it self. The problem is that invalidation of this view can come just by scrolling a listview at the same screen. This "shared invalidation()" causes lag to my animation.So is there a way out of that lag? Do you have any other suggestion of performing animations in that shared enviroment? Creating an animation using a seperate thread that calculates the offset also needs forced invalidation() calls to display the animation (correct me if i'm wrong). Is the only solution to perform the animation in eg 10 invalidation requests with a larger step? It will ease the lag out but i think i can use a different approach on that.

@TITLE:Using snow (and snowfall) with AWS for parallel processing in R
@CONTENT:In relation to my earlier similar SO question , I tried using snow/snowfall on AWS for parallel computing. What I did was: In the sfInit() function, I provided the public DNS to socketHosts parameter like so sfInit(parallel=TRUE,socketHosts =list("ec2-00-00-00-000.compute-1.amazonaws.com")) The error returned was Permission denied (publickey) I then followed the instructions (I presume correctly!) on http://www.imbi.uni-freiburg.de/parallel/ in the 'Passwordless Secure Shell (SSH) login' section I just cat the contents of the .pem file that I created on AWS into the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys of the AWS instance I want to connect to from my master AWS instance and for the master AWS instance as well Is there anything I am missing out ? I would be very grateful if users can share their experiences in the use of snow on AWS. Thank you very much for your suggestions. UPDATE: I just wanted to update the solution I found to my specific problem: I used StarCluster to setup my AWS cluster : StarCluster Installed package snowfall on all the nodes of the cluster From the master node issued the following commands hostslist <- list("ec2-xxx-xx-xxx-xxx.compute-1.amazonaws.com","ec2-xx-xx-xxx-xxx.compute-1.amazonaws.com") sfInit(parallel=TRUE, cpus=2, type="SOCK",socketHosts=hostslist) l <- sfLapply(1:2,function(x)system("ifconfig",intern=T)) lapply(l,function(x)x[2]) sfStop() The ip information confirmed that the AWS nodes were being utilized
@CODE:sfInit() socketHosts sfInit(parallel=TRUE,socketHosts =list("ec2-00-00-00-000.compute-1.amazonaws.com")) Permission denied (publickey) snowfall hostslist <- list("ec2-xxx-xx-xxx-xxx.compute-1.amazonaws.com","ec2-xx-xx-xxx-xxx.compute-1.amazonaws.com") sfInit(parallel=TRUE, cpus=2, type="SOCK",socketHosts=hostslist) l <- sfLapply(1:2,function(x)system("ifconfig",intern=T)) lapply(l,function(x)x[2]) sfStop()

@TITLE:Multi-tenant rails application: what are the pros and cons of different techniques?
@CONTENT:I originally wrote my Ruby on Rails application for one client. Now, I am changing it so that it can be used for different clients. My end-goal is that some user (not me) can click a button and create a new project. Then all the necessary changes (new schema, new tables, handling of code) are generated without anyone needing me to edit a database.yml file or add new schema definitions. I am currently using the SCOPED access. So I have a project model and other associated models have a project_id column. I have looked at other posts regarding multi-tenant applications in Rails. A lot of people seem to suggest creating a different schema for each new client in Postgres. For me, however, it is not much useful for a new client to have a different schema in terms of data model. Each client will have the same tables, rows, columns, etc. My vision for each client is that my production database first has a table of different projects/clients. And each one of those tables links to a set of tables that are pretty much the same with different data. In other terms a table of tables. Or in other terms, the first table will map to a different set of data for each client that has the same structure. Is the way I explained my vision at all similar to the way that Postgres implements different "schemas"? Does it look like nested tables? Or does Postgres have to query all the information in the database anyway? I do not currently use Postgres, but I would be willing to learn if it fits the design. If you know of database software that works with Rails that fits my needs, please do let me know. Right now, I am using scopes to accomplish multi-tenant applications, but it does not feel scalable or clean. It does however make it very easy for a non-technical user to create a new project provided I give them fillable information. Do you know if it is possible with the multi-schema Postgres defintion to have it work automatically after a user clicks a button? And I would prefer that this be handled by Rails and not by an external script if possible? (please do advise either way) Most importantly, do you recommend any plugins or that I should adopt a different framework for this task? I have found Rails to be limited in some cases of abstraction as above and this is the first time I have ran into a Rails-scaling issue. Any advice related to multi-tenant applications or my situation is welcome. Any questions for clarification or additional advice are welcome as well. Thanks, --Dave

@TITLE:How to detect Fingersize with IOS?
@CONTENT:Is it possible to detect the fingersize in an IOS Application? I've read in the documentation: Notes: A finger on the screen affords a much different level of precision than a mouse pointer. When a user touches the screen, the area of contact is actually elliptical and tends to be offset below the point where the user thinks he or she touched. This ¡§contact patch¡¨ also varies in size and shape based on which finger is touching the screen, the size of the finger, the pressure of the finger on the screen, the orientation of the finger, and other factors. The underlying Multi-Touch system analyzes all of this information for you and computes a single touch point. Source: http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#DOCUMENTATION/EventHandling/Conceptual/EventHandlingiPhoneOS/MultitouchEvents/MultitouchEvents.html So, does that mean theres no possibility with the SDK to detect the physical fingersize? What I want to accomplish: I need virtual "buttons" in my OpenGL ES Application. And if someone hold the iPhone like a gamepad, he will probalbly use one finger for two buttons (rolling off the thumb). I hope its understandable what I mean... Any ideas?

@TITLE:Cube root modulo P ¡X how do I do this?
@CONTENT:I am trying to calculate the cube root of a many-hundred digit number modulo P in Python, and failing miserably. I found code for the Tonelli-Shanks algorithm which supposedly is simple to modify from square roots to cube roots, but this eludes me. I've scoured the web and math libraries and a few books to no avail. Code would be wonderful, so would an algorithm explained in plain English. Here is the Python (2.6?) code for finding square roots: def modular_sqrt(a, p):
    """ Find a quadratic residue (mod p) of 'a'. p
        must be an odd prime.

        Solve the congruence of the form:
            x^2 = a (mod p)
        And returns x. Note that p - x is also a root.

        0 is returned is no square root exists for
        these a and p.

        The Tonelli-Shanks algorithm is used (except
        for some simple cases in which the solution
        is known from an identity). This algorithm
        runs in polynomial time (unless the
        generalized Riemann hypothesis is false).

@LINK:/questions/6728750/html5-file-uploading-with-multiple-progress-bars
@TITLE:HTML5 file uploading with multiple progress bars
@CONTENT:I'm uploading multiple files via XmlHTTPRequest and HTML5. I have the uploading working fine, but I would like to have a progress bar for each file upload going on. The code I have, however, uses the last progress bar for ALL of the file uploads instead of each upload using its own progress bar. So this is mostly visual on the client-side, but it's really annoying me. For some reason I'm assuming that the event that attaches the progress of the file upload overwrites itself and uses the last progress bar. Here's my code: var files = event.dataTransfer.files;

    // iterate over each file to upload, send a request, and attach progress event
    for (var i = 0, file; file = files[i]; i++) {
        var li = $("<li>" + file.name + "<div class='progressbar'></div></li>");

        // add the LI to the list of uploading files
        $("#uploads").append(li);

        // fade in the LI instead of just showing it
        li.hide().fadeIn();

        var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();

            xhr.upload.addEventListener('progress', function(e) {
                var percent = parseInt(e.loaded / e.total * 100);
                li.find(".progressbar").width(percent);
            }, false);

            // check when the upload is finished
            xhr.onreadystatechange = stateChange;

            // setup and send the file
            xhr.open('POST', '/attachments', true);
            xhr.setRequestHeader('X-FILE-NAME', file.name);
            xhr.send(file);
        }
 I'm assuming that the proper "li" is not getting read properly by the "progress" event. I suspect there's some sort of binding I have to do to tell the "progress" event to use a particular variable as it's "li", but I'm not sure what I'm missing.
@CODE:var files = event.dataTransfer.files;

    // iterate over each file to upload, send a request, and attach progress event
    for (var i = 0, file; file = files[i]; i++) {
        var li = $("<li>" + file.name + "<div class='progressbar'></div></li>");

        // add the LI to the list of uploading files
        $("#uploads").append(li);

        // fade in the LI instead of just showing it
        li.hide().fadeIn();

        var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();

            xhr.upload.addEventListener('progress', function(e) {
                var percent = parseInt(e.loaded / e.total * 100);
                li.find(".progressbar").width(percent);
            }, false);

            // check when the upload is finished
            xhr.onreadystatechange = stateChange;

            xhr.open('POST', '/attachments', true);
            xhr.setRequestHeader('X-FILE-NAME', file.name);
            xhr.send(file);

@TITLE:Grails Spring Security plugin - modify logged in user's authorities
@CONTENT:I have a simple Grails app with Spring Security Core plugin installed and working fine. However, I haven't found any solution to the problem with updating a logged in user's authorities in the security context. I am not talking about updating the current user's details (i.e. springSecurityService.reauthenticate). My problem is: I have a simple user management app with ROLE_ADMIN and ROLE_USER authorities used. Now, I have 2 administrators logged in at the same time (with ROLE_ADMIN authority) from different computers, and one admin decides to change the other admin's authority from ROLE_ADMIN to ROLE_USER. How can I update the user and role so that the modified user (with new ROLE_USER role) cannot perform any ROLE_ADMIN level actions and is immediately redirected to ROLE_USER level pages? Is there a way to update the security context so I don't have to do additional checking in all the controller actions whether the logged in user's authorities have been changed? Can I use the cahceUsers property for that somehow? I haven't modified the cacheUsers and in my understanding, it's false by default. Please, correct me if I'm wrong. EDIT: The sequence that's causing the problem is Administrator "A" modifies administrator "B" and sets a new role (ROLE_USER) for administrator "B" the code calls PersonRole.removeAll(personInstanceB) and PersonRole.create(personInstanceB, roleAdmin) and everything is updated normally at the same time Administrator "B" is already logged in when their authorities are modified. Administrator "B" can continue working on ROLE_ADMIN restricted pages until he/she logs out and does a new login. Only then the authorities are updated and Administrator "B" has the new role (ROLE_USER) I want Administrator "B" to be redirected to the ROLE_USER pages when the user is updated with the new role and not only after logout/login calling springSecurityService.reauthenticate personInstanceB.username) causes Administrator "A" to be "logged in" as Administrator "B" so this does not work. Any ideas would be very welcome. I may have missed something simple here but I have no idea what the solution would be. Cheers, mizzzto

Here are some questions I have: How do I separate the static resources from the Python code so that I don't waste time processing the static content through Django? As apps are reusable modules, they are not really tight to a project, so should they be located in the project directory, or in another directory that would contain all my "homemade" apps?

@CONTENT:I have read lots of blog posts. I have read the docs. I am usually fairly good at picking up new stuff but even though I keep reading, but I just don't understand the parts of a PIVOT in SQL Server (2008). Can someone please give it to me, nice and slow. (ie Pivot for Dummies) If an example is needed then we can use the one in this question. Here is how I tried to pivot that example: SELECT OtherID, Val1, Val2, Val3, Val4, Val5
FROM 
    (SELECT OtherID, Val
    FROM @randomTable) p
PIVOT
(
    max(val)
    FOR Val IN (Val1, Val2, Val3, Val4, Val5)
) AS PivotTable;
 The above query gives me nulls instead of values in the Val1, Val2... columns. But to be clear, I am not looking for a fixed query here. I need to understand PIVOT as I am looking to pivot something far more complex than this example. Specifically what is the deal with the aggregate? I just want to take all string values that match on a given ID and put them in the same row. I am not trying to aggregate anything. (Again, see this question for my example.)

@LINK:/questions/4907848/whats-the-most-efficient-way-to-parse-fix-protocol-messages-in-net
@TITLE:What's the most efficient way to parse FIX Protocol messages in .NET?
@CONTENT:I came across this very similar question but that question is tagged QuickFIX (which is not relevant to my question) and most of the answers are QuickFIX-related. My question is broader. I'm looking for the most efficient way to parse a FIX Protocol message using C#. By way of background, a FIX message consists of a series of tag/value pairs separated by the ASCII <SOH> character (0x01). The number of fields in a message is variable. An example message might look like this: 8=FIX.4.2<SOH>9=175<SOH>35=D<SOH>49=BUY1<SOH>56=SELL1<SOH>34=2482<SOH>50=frg<SOH>
52=20100702-11:12:42<SOH>11=BS01000354924000<SOH>21=3<SOH>100=J<SOH>55=ILA SJ<SOH>
48=YY77<SOH>22=5<SOH>167=CS<SOH>207=J<SOH>54=1<SOH>60=20100702-11:12:42<SOH>
38=500<SOH>40=1<SOH>15=ZAR<SOH>59=0<SOH>10=230<SOH>
 For each field, the tag (an integer) and the value (for our purposes, a string) are separated by the '=' character. (The precise semantics of each tag are defined in the protocol, but that isn't particularly germane to this question.) It's often the case that when doing basic parsing, you are only interested in a handful of specific tags from the FIX header, and not really doing random access to every possible field. Strategies I have considered include: Using String.Split, iterating over every element and putting the tag to index mapping in a Hashtable - provides full random-access to all fields if needed at some point (Slight optimisation) Using String.Split, scanning the array for tags of interest and putting the tag to index mapping into another container (not necessarily a Hashtable as it may be a fairly small number of items, and the number of items is known prior to parsing) Scanning the message field by field using String.IndexOf and storing the offset and length of fields of interest in an appropriate structure Regarding the first two - although my measurements indicate String.Split is pretty fast, as per the documentation the method allocates a new String for each element of the resultant array which can generate a lot of garbage if you're parsing a lot of messages. Can anyone see a better way to tackle this problem in .NET? EDIT: Three vital pieces of information I left out: Tags are not necessarily unique within FIX messages, i.e., duplicate tags can occur under certain circumstances. Certain types of FIX fields can contain 'embedded <SOH>' in the data - these tags are referred to as being of type 'data' - a dictionary lists the tag numbers that are of this type. The eventual requirement is to be able to edit the message (particularly replace values).

@LINK:/questions/4831154/which-hierarchical-model-should-i-use-adjacency-nested-or-enumerated
@TITLE:Which Hierarchical model should I use? Adjacency, Nested, or Enumerated?
@CONTENT:I have a table which contains a location of all geographical locations in the world and their relationships. Here is a example that shows the hierarchy. You will see that the data is actually stored as all three Enumerated Path Adjacency list Nested Set The data obviously never changes either. Below is an example of direct ancestors of the location Brighton in England which has a woeid of 13911. Table: geoplanet_places (Has 5.6million rows) Large Image: http://tinyurl.com/68q4ndx I then have another table called entities. This table stores my items which I would like to map to a geographical location. I store some basic information but most important I store the woeid which is a foreign key from geoplanet_places. Eventually the entities table will contain several thousand entities. And I would like a way to be able to return a full tree of all of the nodes which contain entities. I plan on creating something to facilitate the filtering and searching of entities based on their geographical location and be able to discover how many entities can be found on that particular node. So if I only have one entity in my entities table, I might have something like this `Earth (1) United Kingdom (1) England (1) East Sussex (1) Brighton and Hove City (1) Brighton (1)` Lets then say that I have another entity which is located in Devon, then it would show something like: Earth (2) United Kingom (2) England (2) Devon (1) East Sussex (1) ... etc The (Counts) which will say how many entities are "inside" of each geographical location do not need to be live. I can live with generating my object every hour and caching it. The aim, is to be able to create an interface which might start out showing only the Countries which have entities.. So like Argentina (1021), Chile (291), ..., United States (32,103), United Kingdom (12,338) Then the user will click on a location, such as United Kindom, and will then be given all of the immediate child nodes which are descendants of United Kingdom AND have an entity in them. If there are 32 Counties in United Kindgdom, but only 23 of them eventually when you drill down have entities stored in them, then I don't want to display the other 9. It is only locations. This site aptly demonstrates the functionality that I wish to achieve: http://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rentals/europe/r5 How do you recommend that I manage such a data structure? Things I am using. PHP MySQL Solr I plan on having the Drill downs be as rapid as possible. I want to create an AJAX interface that will be seemless for searching. I would also be interested to know which columns you would recommend indexing on.

While there are resources for writing the content of the manual, typography for a good user manual does not seems to be addressed any where. A good manual should be legible, easy to read and it should be easy to find a particular information quickly and above all it should be beautiful to look at. Going though some fine user manuals with beautiful typograpy is sure to inspire me as well as others looking to produce nice user manuals. So dear SO users, if you have come across some outstanding user manuals please post (links to) them as answers to this question, and let this question be a list of beautiful manuals for inspiration and information. with regards, raj PS: This question is not a duplicate of this question as I am more interested in beautifully typeset manuals than it's contents.

@LINK:/questions/4278888/using-alloc-and-init
@TITLE:using alloc and init
@CONTENT:We know about the complete pattern of alloc/init that alloc and init must be combined. NSObject *myObj = [[NSObject alloc] init];
 1- init method receives the object from another source(not from a alloc,new,copy or alike or retained) so according to the fundamental memory management rule its not the owner and it must not release it. However, "Allocating and Initializing Objects / The Returned Object" article says that init could free the receiver. How could this be possible when its against the fundamental rule? 2- Also, from the same article, init could return another object or nil. So, in this case, when we use the complete pattern of alloc/init, we could not release the object returned by alloc but we could only release the object returned from init and, init releases the object it received from alloc instead of us. But init is not a alloc,new,copy or alike method so we must not release the object returned from it as it does not give us the ownership of object. How could we release the object returned from init although this is against the fundamental rule? 3- Or, to adhere to the last paragraph of the same article, must we accept init method as a special case and use alloc/init pattern as an exception to the fundamental rule? Memory Management Fundamental Rule: You only release or autorelease objects you own. You take ownership of an object if you create it using a method whose name begins with ¡§alloc¡¨ or ¡§new¡¨ or contains ¡§copy¡¨ (for example, alloc, newObject, or mutableCopy), or if you send it a retain message. You use release or autorelease to relinquish ownership of an object. autorelease just means ¡§send a release message in the future¡¨ (to understand when this will be, see ¡§Autorelease Pools¡¨). http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/MemoryMgmt/Articles/mmRules.html Allocating and Initializing Objects / The Returned Object: However, in some cases, this responsibility can mean returning a different object than the receiver. For example, if a class keeps a list of named objects, it might provide an initWithName: method to initialize new instances. If there can be no more than one object per name, initWithName: might refuse to assign the same name to two objects. When asked to assign a new instance a name that¡¦s already being used by another object, it might free the newly allocated instance and return the other object¡Xthus ensuring the uniqueness of the name while at the same time providing what was asked for, an instance with the requested name. In a few cases, it might be impossible for an init... method to do what it¡¦s asked to do. For example, an initFromFile: method might get the data it needs from a file passed as an argument. If the file name it¡¦s passed doesn¡¦t correspond to an actual file, it won¡¦t be able to complete the initialization. In such a case, the init... method could free the receiver and return nil, indicating that the requested object can¡¦t be created. Because an init... method might return an object other than the newly allocated receiver, or even return nil, it¡¦s important that programs use the value returned by the initialization method, not just that returned by alloc or allocWithZone:. The following code is very dangerous, since it ignores the return of init. id anObject = [SomeClass alloc];
[anObject init];
[anObject someOtherMessage];
 Instead, to safely initialize an object, you should combine allocation and initialization messages in one line of code. id anObject = [[SomeClass alloc] init];
[anObject someOtherMessage];

@TITLE:CouchApp without Server side or CouchDB backend with xdomain issues?
@CONTENT:I have been playing with CouchDB and CouchApp for a little while now. I am planning on using it for a new web site project I'm working on. From a scalability viewpoint I love the idea of CouchApp. The downside is that with no server side code there are some things (like oAuth authentication) that are hard to do on the client side. At some point I'm sure I will need some server side code of some description - I guess you can then look at Node.js but would rather not at this point. Using CouchDB purely as a backend solution while your pages are served from another server is also a great fit but the downside here is that the cross domain issues prevent you from easily using the built in CouchDB API. So does anyone have a solution to one of these two downsides? Can you somehow serve server side code (even PHP would be a win) from CouchApp or can you somehow use a separate site to serve your pages but overcome the cross domain issue? I am really trying to keep the solution as clean (and as scalable) as possible and one of the great things about CouchDB is the super simple, super fast API so I don't really want to use a wrapper around it - unless it doesn't hinder the performance/scalability. Your opinions are welcome.

@CONTENT:My question is: given a list L of length n, and an integer i such that 0 <= i < n!, how can you write a function perm(L, n) to produce the ith permutation of L in O(n) time? What I mean by ith permutation is just the ith permutation in some implementation defined ordering that must have the properties: For any i and any 2 lists A and B, perm(A, i) and perm(B, i) must both map the jth element of A and B to an element in the same position for both A and B. For any inputs (A, i), (A, j) perm(A, i)==perm(A, j) if and only if i==j. NOTE: this is not homework. In fact, I solved this 2 years ago, but I've completely forgotten how, and it's killing me. Also, here is a broken attempt I made at a solution: def perm(s, i):
  n = len(s)
  perm = [0]*n
  itCount = 0
  for elem in s:
    perm[i%n + itCount] = elem
    i = i / n
    n -= 1
    itCount+=1
  return perm
 ALSO NOTE: the O(n) requirement is very important. Otherwise you could just generate the n! sized list of all permutations and just return its ith element.
@CODE:def perm(s, i):
  n = len(s)
  perm = [0]*n
  itCount = 0
  for elem in s:
    perm[i%n + itCount] = elem
    i = i / n
    n -= 1
    itCount+=1
  return perm (ABCDEF) i (BCDEF) (BCDEF) i

@TITLE:Factory Design Pattern (needing critique)
@CONTENT:I am putting together an explanation and code example of this design pattern, attempting to help others around me grasp it (along with helping myself to master the pattern as well). What I am looking for is opinions & or critique of my explanation and code sample...thanks! What is the factory pattern? The factory pattern utilizes a particular dedicated "object creator object" to handle creation of - and most times instantiation of - objects, similar to a real world factory. Real world example Think of an automobile factory being the creator of various types of automobiles. One of the assembly lines in that automobile factory may produce a truck one day, but on another day may be re-tooled for producing cars. Say a dealership places an order for 10 cars to their assigned account handling department. That department then utilizes a certain factory and orders up the 10 cars. The account handlers are not concerned with making the cars themselves (imagine the poor results) they only work with the final product, ensuring the dealership gets their vehicles. A new model of that same car comes out the next year and orders begin flowing in. The account handlers (still not concerned with the production of the car) place the orders, but now the car they receive is different, the assembling method or even maybe the factory altogether may be different, yet the account handlers need not worry about this. An additional thought: the factory assemblers of the vehicles may know exactly what action to take if a certain account handler places an order (i.e. account handler X places an order, factory assembler knows that for account handler X, they produce 10 vehicles of type Y). Another option may be that the account handler tells the assembler exactly what type of vehicle to produce. If the account handlers also handled the creation of the vehicles (i.e. they were coupled), every time a vehicle changed in any way, each of the account handlers would have to be retrained in producing that vehicle. This would create quality issues as there are far more account handlers than there would be factories...mistakes would happen, expense would be far greater. Circling back to OOP An object factory as a design pattern applied to software engineering is similar to the above example in concept¡K The factory churns out various types of other objects, you can utilize an assembly line (object assembler) which produces a certain object type, returned in a certain way. The assembler can either inspect the requesting client and handle, or the client may tell the assembler what object it requires. Now...you are on a project and create an object factory and various assemblers, later on down the road in the project, the requirements change slightly, you are now asked to alter object contents and how its clients are handling that object. Since you utilized the factory pattern this is a simple change and in one location, you can change or add the objects the factory produces, and alter the format in which the assemblers lay the object contents out. The unfortunate way to have done this would have been without a factory method, instantiating each object instance and formatting object contents in the clients themselves...say you used this particular object in 20 clients. Now you must go to each one of the clients, alter each of the object instances and formats...what a waste of time¡KBe lazy...do it the right way the first time so you save yourself (and others) time and effort later. Code example (C#) Below is an example utilizing a factory for food and various food objects Factory module

@TITLE:Best way to develop/manage/design recurring tasks/calendar
@CONTENT:An example of what I'm talking about is similar to Google Calendar. When a new recurring task is created. After creating the recurring task "template" - which all of the individual tasks are based on, do you create all of the individual tasks and store them in the database? or do you just store the "template" recurring events and their exceptions? If the user requests a "month" view, and you want to display all of the events/tasks, it seems like creating the output in real time from the template, and including all of the exceptions would be a lot more resource intensive then if each individual recurring tasks was created from the template and inserted into the database. This would make searching/sorting, etc, a lot more easier too. Anybody create something like this before? ideas?

@CONTENT:I am using iTunes file sharing in my app, and need to put Core Data's sqlite database elsewhere so that users don't fiddle with it. I have read a previous SO post regarding the best way to hide the sqlite file that Core Data uses. There seems to be conflicting opinions regarding whether to put the database in Library/Preferences or in a directory called .data, but I think I agree the best approach is to use the .data directory. There is currently an -applicationDocumentsDirectory method that was provided by the Core Data template code: - (NSString *)applicationDocumentsDirectory {
    return [NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSDocumentDirectory, NSUserDomainMask, YES) lastObject];
}
 I would like to implement a function called applicationHiddenDocumentsDirectory that will give me access to the ".data" subdirectory, but I don't know enough about Objective-C or the Cocoa/Foundation frameworks to access the directory. Could someone help me implement this method please? Thanks! ==Rowan==

@CONTENT:I am writing a web based application with hibernate and jsp/servlet. I have read about the sessionFactory.getCurrentSession and sessionFactory.openSession methods. I know the basic difference between them (using getCurrentSession you don't have to close the connection and when you commit the transaction, your session will automatically close). According to the my understanding, we should opt for getCurrentSession and do it through session-per-request. Let's consider the following scenario: Method A calls getCurrentSession and got the current session In Method A, a transaction is started using the session from step 1 Method A calls Method B, which also has getCurrentSession and starts a transaction Method B commits its transaction Control returns to method A and it also commits the transaction Now my questions are Will the session found in step 1 and step 3 will be the same session? If the answer for the question 1 is yes, then how would it handle the commit in step 4? Ideally it should close the session there itself and should throw an exception at step 5. If the answer for the question 1 is no, then how do you handle such a scenario?

@CONTENT:So I'm beginning to learn how to use Cocoa. I think I've pretty much got it but I'm hung up on creating and switching views. I'm rewriting a game I made a little bit ago for practice. All I want is one window (preferably not resizable) and I want to be able to switch out views for different screens in the game. First, I have the main menu (Start Game, High Scores, Exit). Then I need a window for each screen (Gameplay screen, Highscore screen). What I'm getting confused with is how to design this. I looked up NSViewController thinking it manages views but it doesn't. It only manages one view by loading it really. I don't understand why I'd need to use NSViewController then. Couldn't I just have a window class that contains multiple subclasses of NSView and load them like that? I'm not sure I understand the purpose of the ViewController. Does my Window Class really need to subclass NSWindowController? I was trying to follow the example of Apple's ViewController example and it has a window controller class that's a subclass of NSWindowController. I don't see what the purpose was of subclassing that. All NSWindowController seems to add is - initWithPath:(NSString *)newPath but I fail to see the use in that either when I can just edit the plist file to open the window on start up. Apple's example also has an NSView variable and an NSViewController variable. Don't you only need one variable to store the current view? Thanks in advance guys, I'm really confused as to how this works.

@TITLE:Lazy load images for UITableViewCells from NSDocumentDirectory?
@CONTENT:I have a UITableView in my app in which I load several images from the NSDocumentDirectory. It works, but when scrolling up and down, the app seems to freeze a bit, most likely because of the images being served in the main thread, effectively blocking the tableView from scrolling until it's loaded. My problem is that I don't know how to load them in later, a "lazy load" feature, while scrolling. This is the code snippet used to load the images now: imagesPath = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@/images/", [NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSDocumentDirectory, NSUserDomainMask, YES) objectAtIndex:0]];
if ([fileManager fileExistsAtPath:[imagesPath stringByAppendingPathComponent:[NSString stringWithFormat:@"/%d.png", rowID]]]) {
    UIImage *image = [[UIImage alloc] initWithContentsOfFile:[imagesPath stringByAppendingPathComponent:[NSString stringWithFormat:@"/%d.png", rowID]]];
    // If image contains anything, set cellImage to image. If image is empty, use default, noimage.png.
    if (image != nil){
        // If image != nil, set cellImage to that image
        cell.cellImage.image = image;
    }
    [image release];
}
 What is the best way to "lazy load" the images in each cell to avoid lagging in the scrolling?
@CODE:UITableView NSDocumentDirectory imagesPath = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@/images/", [NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSDocumentDirectory, NSUserDomainMask, YES) objectAtIndex:0]];

@TITLE:How do I join three tables with SQLalchemy and keeping all of the columns in one of the tables?
@CONTENT:So, I have three tables: The class defenitions: engine = create_engine('sqlite://test.db', echo=False)
SQLSession = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
Base = declarative_base()

class Channel(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'channel'

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key = True)
    title = Column(String)
    description = Column(String)
    link = Column(String)

class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'user'

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key = True)
    username = Column(String)
    password = Column(String)
    sessionId = Column(String)

class Subscription(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'subscription'

    userId = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('user.id'), primary_key=True)
    channelId = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('channel.id'), primary_key=True)
 NOTE: I know user.username should be unique, need to fix that, and I'm not sure why SQLalchemy creates some row names with the double-quotes. And I'm trying to come up with a way to retrieve all of the channels, as well as an indication on what channels one particular user (identified by user.sessionId together with user.id) has a subscription on. For example, say we have four channels: channel1, channel2, channel3, channel4; a user: user1; who has a subscription on channel1 and channel4. The query for user1 would return something like: channel.id | channel.title | subscribed
---------------------------------------
1            channel1        True
2            channel2        False
3            channel3        False
4            channel4        True
 This is a best-case result, but since I have absolutely no clue as how to accomplish the subscribed column, I've been instead trying to get the particular users id in the rows where the user has a subscription and where a subscription is missing, just leave it blank. The database engine that I'm using together with SQLalchemy atm. is sqlite3 I've been scratching my head over this for two days now, I've no problem joining together all three by way of the subscription table but then all of the channels where the user does not have a subscription gets omitted. I hope I've managed to describe my problem sufficiently, thanks in advance. EDIT: Managed to solve this in a slightly clunky way involving a sub-query: # What a messy SQL query!
stmt = query(Subscription).filter_by(userId = uid()).join((User, Subscription.userId == User.id)).filter_by(sessionId = id()).subquery()
subs = aliased(Subscription, stmt)
results = query(Channel.id, Channel.title, subs.userId).outerjoin((subs, subs.channelId == Channel.id))
 However, I'll be continuing to search for a more elegant solution, so answers are still very much welcomed.

@CONTENT:I remember, I have a GoF book back in college about design patterns which helped me a lot with my C and C++ programming, since my jump ship to Rails I was trying to use those design patterns I learned previously, Rails is a relatively new paradigm to me, plurals, verbs, REST, DRY.. Can you give me a recommended book for Rails that I can easily understand what I previously learned back in College. P.S. I suspect Matz knew about the GoF book, and applied it on Ruby... :-)

@TITLE:How to follow user location with MapKit
@CONTENT:I'm using MapKit to display the user's location relative to pins around them. I'd like to be able to mimic the functionality that Maps provides via the crosshair button in the lower left-hand corner of the screen. I'm already aware that MapKit provides a CLLocation object with the user's location via MKUserLocation, I just wanted to seek advice on how I should keep focus on that location. My initial inclination was to use an NSTimer to center the map on that coordinate every 500ms or so. Is there a better way to do this? Is there something built in to MapKit that I'm missing that will accomplish this? Thanks so much, Brendan

@TITLE:Testing approach for multi-threaded software
@CONTENT:I have a piece of mature geospatial software that has recently had areas rewritten to take better advantage of the multiple processors available in modern PCs. Specifically, display, GUI, spatial searching, and main processing have all been hived off to seperate threads. The software has a pretty sizeable GUI automation suite for functional regression, and another smaller one for performance regression. While all automated tests are passing, I'm not convinced that they provide nearly enough coverage in terms of finding bugs relating race conditions, deadlocks, and other nasties associated with multi-threading. What techniques would you use to see if such bugs exist? What techniques would you advocate for rooting them out, assuming there are some in there to root out? What I'm doing so far is running the GUI functional automation on the app running under a debugger, such that I can break out of deadlocks and catch crashes, and plan to make a bounds checker build and repeat the tests against that version. I've also carried out a static analysis of the source via PC-Lint with the hope of locating potential dead locks, but not had any worthwhile results. The application is C++, MFC, mulitple document/view, with a number of threads per doc. The locking mechanism I'm using is based on an object that includes a pointer to a CMutex, which is locked in the ctor and freed in the dtor. I use local variables of this object to lock various bits of code as required, and my mutex has a time out that fires my a warning if the timeout is reached. I avoid locking where possible, using resource copies where possible instead. What other tests would you carry out? Edit: I have cross posted this question on a number of different testing and programming forums, as I'm keen to see how the different mind-sets and schools of thought would approach this issue. So apologies if you see it cross-posted elsewhere. I'll provide a summary links to responses after a week or so

@CONTENT:So I'm beginning to learn how to use Cocoa. I think I've pretty much got it but I'm hung up on creating and switching views. I'm rewriting a game I made a little bit ago for practice. All I want is one window (preferably not resizable) and I want to be able to switch out views for different screens in the game. First, I have the main menu (Start Game, High Scores, Exit). Then I need a window for each screen (Gameplay screen, Highscore screen). What I'm getting confused with is how to design this. I looked up NSViewController thinking it manages views but it doesn't. It only manages one view by loading it really. I don't understand why I'd need to use NSViewController then. Couldn't I just have a window class that contains multiple subclasses of NSView and load them like that? I'm not sure I understand the purpose of the ViewController. Does my Window Class really need to subclass NSWindowController? I was trying to follow the example of Apple's ViewController example and it has a window controller class that's a subclass of NSWindowController. I don't see what the purpose was of subclassing that. All NSWindowController seems to add is - initWithPath:(NSString *)newPath but I fail to see the use in that either when I can just edit the plist file to open the window on start up. Apple's example also has an NSView variable and an NSViewController variable. Don't you only need one variable to store the current view? Thanks in advance guys, I'm really confused as to how this works.

@CONTENT:I have a UITableView in my app in which I load several images from the NSDocumentDirectory. It works, but when scrolling up and down, the app seems to freeze a bit, most likely because of the images being served in the main thread, effectively blocking the tableView from scrolling until it's loaded. My problem is that I don't know how to load them in later, a "lazy load" feature, while scrolling. This is the code snippet used to load the images now: imagesPath = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@/images/", [NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSDocumentDirectory, NSUserDomainMask, YES) objectAtIndex:0]];
if ([fileManager fileExistsAtPath:[imagesPath stringByAppendingPathComponent:[NSString stringWithFormat:@"/%d.png", rowID]]]) {

    if (image != nil){
        // If image != nil, set cellImage to that image
        cell.cellImage.image = image;
    }

The static request that came in where directly delivered by Nginx without having to go to Apache. In this case Nginx handled a large portion of the request and I can clearly see the necessity of Nginx. Now that I moved all the static content to another domain, is there still a need to have nginx in front of Apache. Because now all the request are by default dynamic requests and all go to Apache. Are there any other benefits of having Nginx and Apache running for only dynamic content. My dynamic content is PHP/MySQL Edit: To be clear: I now have Nginx as a reverse proxy. It delivers static and dynamic content. But I am moving my static files to a CDN. Do I then still need Nginx on my domain.

@TITLE:SQL Server 2008 - Shrinking the Transaction Log - Any way to automate?
@CONTENT:I went in and checked my Transaction log the other day and it was something crazy like 15GB. I ran the following code: USE mydb
GO
BACKUP LOG mydb WITH TRUNCATE_ONLY
GO
DBCC SHRINKFILE(mydb_log,8)
GO
 Which worked fine, shrank it down to 8MB...but the DB in question is a Log Shipping Publisher, and the log is already back up to some 500MB and growing quick. Is there any way to automate this log shrinking, outside of creating a custom "Execute T-SQL Statement Task" Maintenance Plan Task, and hooking it on to my log backup task? If that's the best way then fine...but I was just thinking that SQL Server would have a better way of dealing with this. I thought it was supposed to shrink automatically whenever you took a log backup, but that's not happening (perhaps because of my log shipping, I don't know). Here's my current backup plan: Full backups every night Transaction log backups once a day, late morning (maybe hook the Log shrinking onto this...doesn't need to be shrank every day though) Or maybe I just run it once a week, after I run a full backup task? What do you all think?

@TITLE:How do I join three tables with SQLalchemy and keeping all of the columns in one of the tables?
@CONTENT:So, I have three tables: The class defenitions: engine = create_engine('sqlite://test.db', echo=False)
SQLSession = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
Base = declarative_base()

class Channel(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'channel'

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key = True)
    title = Column(String)
    description = Column(String)
    link = Column(String)
    pubDate = Column(DateTime)

class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'user'

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key = True)
    username = Column(String)
    password = Column(String)
    sessionId = Column(String)

class Subscription(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'subscription'

    userId = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('user.id'), primary_key=True)
    channelId = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('channel.id'), primary_key=True)
 NOTE: I know user.username should be unique, need to fix that, and I'm not sure why SQLalchemy creates some row names with the double-quotes. And I'm trying to come up with a way to retrieve all of the channels, as well as an indication on what channels one particular user (identified by user.sessionId together with user.id) has a subscription on. For example, say we have four channels: channel1, channel2, channel3, channel4; a user: user1; who has a subscription on channel1 and channel4. The query for user1 would return something like: channel.id | channel.title | subscribed
---------------------------------------
1            channel1        True
2            channel2        False
3            channel3        False
4            channel4        True
 This is a best-case result, but since I have absolutely no clue as how to accomplish the subscribed column, I've been instead trying to get the particular users id in the rows where the user has a subscription and where a subscription is missing, just leave it blank. The database engine that I'm using together with SQLalchemy atm. is sqlite3 I've been scratching my head over this for two days now, I've no problem joining together all three by way of the subscription table but then all of the channels where the user does not have a subscription gets omitted. I hope I've managed to describe my problem sufficiently, thanks in advance. EDIT: Managed to solve this in a slightly clunky way involving a sub-query: # What a messy SQL query!
stmt = query(Subscription).filter_by(userId = uid()).join((User, Subscription.userId == User.id)).filter_by(sessionId = id()).subquery()
subs = aliased(Subscription, stmt)
results = query(Channel.id, Channel.title, subs.userId).outerjoin((subs, subs.channelId == Channel.id))
 However, I'll be continuing to search for a more elegant solution, so answers are still very much welcomed.

@CONTENT:I'm using MapKit to display the user's location relative to pins around them. I'd like to be able to mimic the functionality that Maps provides via the crosshair button in the lower left-hand corner of the screen. I'm already aware that MapKit provides a CLLocation object with the user's location via MKUserLocation, I just wanted to seek advice on how I should keep focus on that location. My initial inclination was to use an NSTimer to center the map on that coordinate every 500ms or so. Is there a better way to do this? Is there something built in to MapKit that I'm missing that will accomplish this? Thanks so much, Brendan

@LINK:/questions/2437763/testing-approach-for-multi-threaded-software
@TITLE:Testing approach for multi-threaded software
@CONTENT:I have a piece of mature geospatial software that has recently had areas rewritten to take better advantage of the multiple processors available in modern PCs. Specifically, display, GUI, spatial searching, and main processing have all been hived off to seperate threads. The software has a pretty sizeable GUI automation suite for functional regression, and another smaller one for performance regression. While all automated tests are passing, I'm not convinced that they provide nearly enough coverage in terms of finding bugs relating race conditions, deadlocks, and other nasties associated with multi-threading. What techniques would you use to see if such bugs exist? What techniques would you advocate for rooting them out, assuming there are some in there to root out? What I'm doing so far is running the GUI functional automation on the app running under a debugger, such that I can break out of deadlocks and catch crashes, and plan to make a bounds checker build and repeat the tests against that version. I've also carried out a static analysis of the source via PC-Lint with the hope of locating potential dead locks, but not had any worthwhile results. The application is C++, MFC, mulitple document/view, with a number of threads per doc. The locking mechanism I'm using is based on an object that includes a pointer to a CMutex, which is locked in the ctor and freed in the dtor. I use local variables of this object to lock various bits of code as required, and my mutex has a time out that fires my a warning if the timeout is reached. I avoid locking where possible, using resource copies where possible instead. What other tests would you carry out? Edit: I have cross posted this question on a number of different testing and programming forums, as I'm keen to see how the different mind-sets and schools of thought would approach this issue. So apologies if you see it cross-posted elsewhere. I'll provide a summary links to responses after a week or so

The program simulates ESEUTIL.exe, in the sense, it uses 2 threads, one for reading and one for writing. The reader thread reads 256 KB from source and fills a buffer. Once 16 such 256 KB blocks are filled, the writer thread writes the contents in the buffer to the destination file. As you can see, the writer thread writes 8MB of data in 1 shot. The program allocates 32 such 8MB blocks... hence, the writing and reading can happen in parallel. Details of ESEUtil.exe can be found in the above link. Note: I am taking care of the data alignment issues when using NO_BUFFERING. I used bench marking utilities like ATTO and found out that our RAID 5 hardware has a write speed of 44MB per second when writing 8MB data chunk. Which is around 2.57 GB per minute. But my program is able to achieve only 1.4 GB per minute. Can anyone please help me identify what the problem is? Are there faster API's other that CreateFile, ReadFile, WriteFile available?

@TITLE:What's the best way to deploy an executable process on a web server?
@CONTENT:The original question: The title of this question might be a bit clumsily phrased, but here's the situation: I have a .NET web project deployed on my server. It's still in beta, so there's a lot of releasing and re-releasing happening. I have also written a C# executable in the same VS solution (call it "admin.exe") that runs in the background on the server, periodically performing certain business rule integrity checks and making appropriate insertions to a warning table in the DB. Question is: what's the best way to deploy this app so that it gets updated whenever I make a new release? It should be running all the time in between releases, so ideally I'd like some sort of setup whereby the shutdown-deploy-startup process involves the minimum possible number of steps. Thanks! Edit - Bounty started The answers given thus far have been helpful and interesting, but haven't provided me with a clear, concise and elegant solution. Please do not assume I have extensive knowledge of deployment projects, because I don't. Bounty goes to the person who can provide a solution that does the following: Publish the latest version of the web site; Shut down any instances of admin.exe that are running on the server; Update admin.exe; Launch admin.exe; All of the above should be done preferably in one step, or as few steps as possible, seeing as it will be done repeatedly throughout the life of the product; and All of the above should be done preferably without requiring installation of any 3rd party software. Thank you for your help! Minor edit - clarification I think a lot of the solutions offered thus far have overestimated the complexity of the problem, so let me clarify: everything that is to be deployed, only has to be deployed on one computer, which also happily has Visual Studio available with all source code. I only need to (1) publish the web site to the web folder, and (2) shut down, reinstall and restart admin.exe on the same server. Isn't there a simple way of doing this in one step? Can it be done with a VS Deployment project?

@TITLE:Python multiprocessing: restrict number of cores used
@CONTENT:I want to know how to distribute N independent tasks to exactly M processors on a machine that has L cores, where L>M. I don't want to use all the processors because I still want to have I/O available. The solutions I've tried seem to get distributed to all processors, bogging down the system. I assume the multiprocessing module is the way to go. I do numerical simulations. My background is in physics, not computer science, so unfortunately, I often don't fully understand discussions involving standard tasking models like server/client, producer/consumer, etc. Here are some simplified models that I've tried: Suppose I have a function run_sim(**kwargs) (see that further below) that runs a simulation, and a long list of kwargs for the simulations, and I have an 8 core machine. from multiprocessing import Pool, Process

#using pool
p = Pool(4)
p.map(run_sim, kwargs)

# using process
number_of_live_jobs=0
all_jobs=[]
sim_index=0
while sim_index < len(kwargs)+1:
   number_of_live_jobs = len([1 for job in all_jobs if job.is_alive()])
   if number_of_live_jobs <= 4:
      p = Process(target=run_sim, args=[], kwargs=kwargs[sim_index])
      print "starting job", kwargs[sim_index]["data_file_name"]
      print "number of live jobs: ", number_of_live_jobs
      p.start()
      p.join()
      all_jobs.append(p)
      sim_index += 1
 When I look at the processor usage with "top" and then "1", All processors seem to get used anyway in either case. It is not out of the question that I am misinterpreting the output of "top", but if the run_simulation() is processor intensive, the machine bogs down heavily.

(suppose 10 bytes no problem, 20 bytes no problem & 200 bytes a problem) What does each color indicates? Which color indicates our code / From which detail we can get to the code where we have allocated the object & forgot to dealloc it? (For example - On clicking of UIKit second cell in detail - we cant get to the code) Why we must resolve all the leaks? - even a single leak can chock up iPhone ? Why iPhone allows leaks to be remain in memory? / why garbage collection isn't done automatically after termination of application? If I try to dealloc objects which should be deallocated according to instruments, My application terminates abnormally. If I don't dealloc, My application runs perfectly, How? Why it is suggested that you wait in a view up to 10 or more seconds, if there is a leak, leak will be detected by Instruments?

@LINK:/questions/892415/how-to-set-up-a-development-environment-in-ms-access
@TITLE:How to set up a development environment in MS Access
@CONTENT:I have created an MS Access 2003 application, set up as a split front-end/back-end configuration, with a user group of about five people. The front end .mdb sits on a network file server, and it contains all the queries, forms, reports, and VBA code, plus links to all the tables in the back end .mdb and some links to ODBC data sources like an AS/400. The back end sits on the same network file server, and it just has the table data in it. This was working well until I "went live" and my handful of users started coming up with enhancement requests, bug reports, etc. I have been rolling out new code by developing/testing in my own copy of the front-end .mdb in another network folder (which is linked to the same back-end .mdb), then posting my completed file in a "come-and-get-it" folder, alerting the users, and they go copy/paste the new front-end file to their own folders on the network. This way, each user can update their front end when they're at a 'stopping point' without having to boot everyone out at once. I've found that when I'm developing now, sometimes Access becomes extremely slow. Like, when I am developing a form and attempt to click a drop-down on the properties box, the drop-down arrow will push in, but it will take a few seconds before the list of options appears. Or there's tons of lag in selecting & moving controls on a form. Or lots of keyboard lag. Then, at other times, there's no lag at all. I'm wondering if it's because I'm linked to the same back end as the other users. I did make a reasonable effort to set up the queries, forms, reports etc. with minimal record locking, if any at all, depending on the need. But I may have missed something, or perhaps there is some other performance issue I need to address. But I'm wondering if there is an even better way for me to set up my own development back-end .mdb, so I can be testing my code on "safe" data instead of the same live data as the rest of the users. I'm afraid that it's only a matter of time before I corrupt some data, probably at the worst possible moment. Obviously, I could just set up a separate back-end .mdb and manually reconfigure the table links in the front end every time, using the Linked Table Manager. But I'm hoping there is a more elegant solution than that. And I'm wondering if there are any other performance issues I should be considering in this multi-user, split database configuration. EDIT: I should have added that I'm stuck with MS Access (not MS-SQL or any other "real" back end); for more details see my comment to this post.

I'd like to know first of all what the preferred method is of implementing username/password authentication in this scenario.

@TITLE:Best .NET3.5 based strategy for creating disconnected db application
@CONTENT:My requirements are: Relatively small database: 25-30 tables with 4-5k rows in each. 4-5 users with their own copies of local database on their laptops. Sync when needed or at the end of the day. Free solution, as am making this setup for a NFP ogranization. I have been researching various options in last few days. At last I was thinking of narrowing to Datasets, while serializing them to XML, but it seems that it is not a good idea afterall (answers to my previous questions suggested that strongly.) So my question now is what approach (database and the access tech.) should I take? I would like to use c# and an easy to use technology to access my database and sync it at the end of the day. According to this link: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/8fxztkff.aspx, MS suggests two different approaches. I am surprised to see that they have not mentioned LINQ here. So group, what path do you recommend? Thanks a lot for reading.

@CONTENT:I'm using my Gmail Apps for Domain account to send email within my rails application for standard automated emails (user signup, forgot password, notify admin of new comment, etc), but I'm worried about the 500 emails per day limit set by Google.

@TITLE:What's the difference in these ways of creating the static instance for a singleton?
@CONTENT:I have had a bug recently that only manifested itself when the library was built as a release build rather than a debug build. The library is a .NET dll with a COM wrapper and I am using CoCreateInstance to create a class from the dll in an unmanaged c++ app. When I finally tracked the bug down it was caused by accessing a singleton object. I had the singleton instance declared like so: private static readonly MyObjectType s_instance = new MyObjectType;
 and then accessed it with: public static MyObjectType Instance 
    { 
        get 
        {                               
            return s_instance; 
        } 
    }
 this was failing. Changing it to: private static MyObjectType s_instance;

public static MyObjectType Instance 
    { 
        get 
        {               
            if (s_instance==null) 
            { 
                s_instance = new MyObjectType(); 
            } 
            return s_instance; 
        } 
    }
 fixed the issue. Any ideas why the initial usage didn't work and if there are any downsides to doing it either way? The release dll seemed to be perfectly usable from another managed app.
@CODE:private static readonly MyObjectType s_instance = new MyObjectType; public static MyObjectType Instance 
    { 
        get 
        {

@TITLE:Is it a bad idea to reload routes dynamically in Rails?
@CONTENT:I have an application I'm writing where I'm allowing the administrators to add aliases for pages, categories, etc, and I would like to use a different controller/action depending on the alias (without redirecting, and I've found that render doesn't actually call the method. I just renders the template). I have tried a catch all route, but I'm not crazy about causing and catching a DoubleRender exception that gets thrown everytime. The solution for this I've come up with is dynamically generated routes when the server is started, and using callbacks from the Alias model to reload routes when an alias is created/updated/destroyed. Here is the code from my routes.rb: Alias.find(:all).each do |alias_to_add|
	map.connect alias_to_add.name, 
			:controller => alias_to_add.page_type.controller, 
			:action => alias_to_add.page_type.action,
			:navigation_node_id => alias_to_add.navigation_node.id
end
 I am using callbacks in my Alias model as follows: after_save :rebuild_routes
after_destroy :rebuild_routes

def rebuild_routes
	ActionController::Routing::Routes.reload!
end
 Is this against Rails best practices? Is there a better solution?
@CODE:Alias.find(:all).each do |alias_to_add|
	map.connect alias_to_add.name, 
			:controller => alias_to_add.page_type.controller,

I want to count how many single users used an app each day, no matter what's the type of the log, or the device he used.] If it was SQL, assuming that each key of the document is a column, I would query something like this: SELECT app, date, count(*) FROM LOGS group by date, owner, app ant the result would be something like: 'App1', '2015-06-01', 200 'App1', '2015-06-02', 232 'App2', '2015-06-01', 142 'App2', '2015-06-02', 120 How can I get the same result using Cloudant/CouchDB?

@TITLE:Making a request parameter binding case insensitive
@CONTENT:I have a requirement where I have to make requestParams to bind properly even if the cases of the param name changes. Note:I am using spring 3.2 For eg: http://localhost:8080/sample/home?**userName**=xxx or http://localhost:8080/sample/home?username=xxx or http://localhost:8080/sample/home?usernaMe=xxx should map properly to my @RequestParam value. @RequestMapping(value = "home", method = RequestMethod.GET)
public goToHome(@RequestParam(value = "userName", required = false) String userName) {

}
 All the three urls should call the above method and bind the user name properly. Please give me suggestions on how to implement this by implementing new argument handler resolver? Overriding spring config classes to implement generically is preferred over changing the logic in the code for all @RequestParam.
@CODE:http://localhost:8080/sample/home?* http://localhost:8080/sample/home? http://localhost:8080/sample/home? @RequestMapping(value = "home", method = RequestMethod.GET)

@LINK:/questions/26368403/beacon-ranging-in-background-on-ios
@TITLE:Beacon Ranging in Background on iOS
@CONTENT:I understand the difference between monitoring and ranging, and I understand the limitation of iOS in that beacon ranging can only happen in the foreground or in the background when entering and exiting regions as explained here (http://developer.radiusnetworks.com/2013/11/13/ibeacon-monitoring-in-the-background-and-foreground.html). But I'm trying to figure out how to solve a common scenario. If I had a bunch of beacons installed in a department store, how am I supposed to detect when a person moves within range of those beacons? With the way it currently works, the app will get an event when the user enters the store (didEnterRegion) because the collection of all beacons acts as one big region. But there's no way to know that a user is moving between different sections of the store unless the beacons are placed far enough for the user to exit and enter the region again which is probably not practical. The reason I want to range for beacons in the background is that I might need to know that a user is at a specific section/product in the store to display specific offers/information (through a notification) for that section without needing the user to have the app open. This seems to me like a very common scenario for malls and museums, etc... I'm wondering how other developers solved this or whether there's another way of achieving what I want. I didn't include code snippets here because the issue is not with the code, it's just a conceptual issue. If any clarification or code is needed I can add that too. Thanks

@LINK:/questions/23433027/onpagechangelistener-alpha-crossfading
@TITLE:OnPageChangeListener alpha crossfading
@CONTENT:There are a lot of questions with regard to crossfading in Android, but they all include animations. My question is about crossfading using the OnPageChangeListener of a ViewPager. I have a ViewPager which could have an unlimited number of views, but in practice uses about 6 or 7 views. Not much going on there. Each View in the ViewPager has a background Bitmap which should be fixed and crossfade with the background of the next (or previous) View instead of scrolling along with the rest of the View. To achieve this I decoupled the backgrounds and add to an ArrayList and assign them to ImageViews later. But since I don't want to risk the chance that my Activity will end up with numerous ImageViews I thought of the following structure: <FrameLayout 
    android:id="@+id/backgroundContainer"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent">

    <ImageView
        android:id="@+id/bottomImage"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:scaleType="center" />

    <ImageView
        android:id="@+id/middleImage"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:scaleType="center" />

    <ImageView
        android:id="@+id/topImage"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:scaleType="center" />

</FrameLayout>
 Then a OnPageChangeListener is assigned to the ViewPager to assign the backgrounds to the ImageViews. @Override
public void onPageSelected(int position) {
    MyLog.i(TAG, "PAGE SELECTED: " + position);

    if(position == 0) {
        _bottomBackground.setImageBitmap(null);
        _topBackground.setImageBitmap(_backgroundStack.get(position+1));
    } else if (position == NUM_ITEMS-1) {
        _bottomBackground.setImageBitmap(_backgroundStack.get(position-1));
        _topBackground.setImageBitmap(null);
    } else {
        _bottomBackground.setImageBitmap(_backgroundStack.get(position-1));
        _topBackground.setImageBitmap(_backgroundStack.get(position+1));
    }

    _middleBackground.setImageBitmap(_backgroundStack.get(position));            

    // Make the top front background transparent 
    _topBackground.setAlpha(0f);
    _currentBackgroundPosition = position;
}
 This works fine if I would've liked to just swap the backgrounds. I want the backgrounds to cross fade into each other while the user swipes the ViewPager. I've got the fade for a forward scroll working, but I don't understand why the fade for the backward scroll somehow doesn't give a good result. During a backward scroll the middle background should fade into the bottom background. I'm afraid I'm missing something. I'm never changing the alpha of the bottom background, but the Log results always show the exact same value for getAlpha() as for the middle background. @Override
public void onPageScrolled(int position, float positionOffset, int positionOffsetPixels) {
    if(_currentBackgroundPosition == position) {
        // scroll forward
        _topBackground.setAlpha(positionOffset)
    } else {
        //scroll backward
        _middleBackground.setAlpha(positionOffset);               
    }

    MyLog.i(TAG, "Bottom BackgroundAlpha: " + _bottomBackground.getAlpha());
    MyLog.i(TAG, "Middle BackgroundAlpha: " + _middleBackground.getAlpha());
    MyLog.i(TAG, "Top BackgroundAlpha: " + _topBackground.getAlpha());
}
 And wait! There's one more thing I really am not able to figure out how to fix. Although the forward scroll fade is working. There's a super short flickering in the background. I assume this is happening because of way I set up the onPageSelected method. Is there another way how I can create/fix this behavior?

@TITLE:Why is Synchronized block better than synchronized method?
@CONTENT:I have started learning synchronization in threading. Synchronized method: public class Counter{

  private static int count = 0;

  public static synchronized int getCount(){
    return count;
  }

  public synchoronized setCount(int count){
     this.count = count;
  }

}
 Synchronized block : public class Singleton{

private static volatile Singleton _instance;

public static Singleton getInstance(){
   if(_instance == null){
            synchronized(Singleton.class){
              if(_instance == null)
              _instance = new Singleton();
            }
   }
   return _instance;
}
 When should I use Synchronized method and Synchronized block ? Why is Synchronized block better than synchronized method ?
@CODE:public class Counter{

@LINK:/questions/20734438/algorithm-to-generate-a-hexagonal-grid-with-coordinate-system
@TITLE:Algorithm to generate a hexagonal grid with coordinate system
@CONTENT:I am trying to roll up 19 lines of code into a single for loop, but I am feeling a bit stumped. The reason I ask, is because I want the grid to be other sizes instead of 5. In Main::drawHexGridAdvanced(), I am trying to deduce the similarities between each line as opposed to Main::drawHexGridBasic() where I am hard-coding values. I am not sure how to determine the start of the x for each column in each row, because the pattern for n == 5 is 0, -1 -2 -2 -2 after that each consecutive column is just incremented except when the loop reaches the halfway point... Information and Understanding `n` must be odd

n | columns-per row sequence
--+-------------------------
3 | 2 3 2
5 | 3 4 5 4 3
7 | 4 5 6 7 6 5 4
9 | 5 6 7 8 9 8 7 6 5
 int[] columns(int n) {
    int[] columns = new int[n];
    int h = (int) java.lang.Math.floor(n / 2);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        columns[i] = n - java.lang.Math.abs(i - h);
    }

    return columns;
}

// Prints [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5]       
System.out.println(java.util.Arrays.toString(columns(n)));
 Python looks so much more elegant: def hex(n):
    for x in [(n-abs(x-int(n/2))) for x in range(n)]:
        for y in range(n-x):
            print(' '),
    for y in range(x):
        print(' * '),
    print('')

@TITLE:Numpy efficient big matrix multiplication
@CONTENT:To store big matrix on disk I use numpy.memmap. Here is a sample code to test big matrix multiplication: import numpy as np
import time

rows= 10000 # it can be large for example 1kk
cols= 1000

#create some data in memory
data = np.arange(rows*cols, dtype='float32') 
data.resize((rows,cols))

#create file on disk
fp0 = np.memmap('C:/data_0', dtype='float32', mode='w+', shape=(rows,cols))
fp1 = np.memmap('C:/data_1', dtype='float32', mode='w+', shape=(rows,cols))

fp0[:]=data[:]
fp1[:]=data[:]

#matrix transpose test
tr = np.memmap('C:/data_tr', dtype='float32', mode='w+', shape=(cols,rows))
tr= np.transpose(fp1)  #memory consumption?
print fp1.shape
print tr.shape

res = np.memmap('C:/data_res', dtype='float32', mode='w+', shape=(rows,rows))
t0 = time.time()
# redifinition ? res= np.dot(fp0,tr) #takes 342 seconds on my machine, if I multiplicate matrices in RAM it takes 345 seconds (I thinks it's a strange result)
res[:]= np.dot(fp0,tr) # assignment ?
print res.shape
print (time.time() - t0)
 So my questions are : How to restrict memory consumtion of aplication which is using this procedure to some value for example to 100Mb(or 1Gb or something else).Also I don't understand how to estimate memory consumtion of procedure (I think memory is only allocated when "data" variable is created, but how much memory used when we use memmap files?) Maybe there is some optimal solution for multiplication of big matrices stored on disk? For example maybe data not optimally stored on disk or readed from disk, not properly chached, and also dot product use only one core.Maybe I should use something like PyTables? Also I interested in algorithms solving linear system of equations (SVD and others) with restricted memory usage. Maybe this algorithms called out-of-core or iterative and I think there some analogy like hard drive<->ram, gpu ram<->cpu ram, cpu ram<->cpu cache. Also here I found some info about matrix multiplication in PyTables. Also I found this in R but I need it for Python or Matlab.

 if (n<0)
   return 0;
 else if (n==0)
   return 1;
 else if (map[n]>-1)

 I know C and C++, not JAVA. This is from the Cracking the Coding interview book. Could anybody can explain why and how she employs the function map here? map here is array right? I do not see any line to save an input to the map array but how would it return something? Anybody has an idea of C++ or C version of this code? It is hard to understand this code. Maybe not because of the JAVA grammar, but the implicit structure of dynamic programming. What would be the time complexity of this algorithm? It should be smaller than O(3^n) ? I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks, guys

@TITLE:Speed up web scraper
@CONTENT:I am scraping 23770 webpages with a pretty simple web scraper using scrapy. I am quite new to scrapy and even python, but managed to write a spider that does the job. It is, however, really slow (it takes approx. 28 hours to crawl the 23770 pages). I have looked on the scrapy webpage and the mailing lists and stackoverflow, but I can't seem to find generic recommendations for writing fast crawlers understandable for beginners. Maybe my problem is not the spider itself, but the way i run it. All suggestions welcome! I have listed my code below, if it's needed. from scrapy.spider import BaseSpider

@TITLE:Add a Tab Bar Controller Programmatically to current App Flow
@CONTENT:I want to add a tab Bar Controller to my current App Flow. Currently I have a page with a button which on clicking opens a new viewcontroller with a web view where the user logs in and after login I want to take him to his home Page where the navigation bar has his name and a logout button in the right. The home page should also have a tab bar with 3 different tabs. I am able to load the home page view from the webview and get the navigation bar. But I am unable to add the tabBar and get it working. I am confused as to where to add the code for adding TabBar. I am using the below code to add tab bar - UITabBarController *tabBar = [[UITabBarController alloc] init];

HomeViewController *home = [[PPHomeViewController alloc] initWithUserName:[self.userInfo objectForKey:@"name"] Email:[self.userInfo objectForKey:@"email"] Phone:[self.userInfo objectForKey:@"phone_number"]];
home.tabBarItem = [[UITabBarItem alloc]initWithTabBarSystemItem:UITabBarSystemItemFavorites tag:1];

req.tabBarItem = [[UITabBarItem alloc]initWithTabBarSystemItem:UITabBarSystemItemFavorites tag:2];

homeImg.tag=11;
homeImg.image=[UIImage imageNamed:@"footer"];

UIImageView *reqImg=[[UIImageView alloc]initWithFrame:CGRectMake(81, 432,80, 49)];
reqImg.tag=12;
reqImg.image=[UIImage imageNamed:@"footer"];

UIImageView *sendImg=[[UIImageView alloc]initWithFrame:CGRectMake(162, 432,80, 49)];
sendImg.tag=13;
sendImg.image=[UIImage imageNamed:@"footer"];

@TITLE:External Login Account vs. Native Login Account
@CONTENT:I am brand new to Visual Studio 2012 and MVC 4, and I've been working with the SimpleMembershipProvider via the WebMatrix.WebData library. I'd like to integrate Facebook as an external login source down the road, but it's not a requirement as of right now. However, to get a decent feel for what it would take, I've been following the tutorial and guide found here - http://www.asp.net/mvc/tutorials/mvc-4/using-oauth-providers-with-mvc. My question : If a user has already been created using : WebSecurity.CreateUserAndAccount(model.Email, model.Password);
WebSecurity.Login(model.Email, model.Password);
 Can they be "upgraded" to an oAuthMemebership account in the future, if they choose to use their Facebook credentials instead of the email and password they created when first signing up? I couldn't find a clear answer to this question in the guide, or elsewhere, so I'm hoping someone can clarify how that process may work.

@TITLE:how to make each thread use its own RNG in C++11
@CONTENT:I'm using the new random number generators in in C++11. Although there are varying opinions, from this thread it seems that the majority believe they are not thread safe. As a consequence, I would like to make a program, where each thread uses its own RNG. An example is given in the related discussion of how to accomplish this with OpenMP: #include <random>
#include <iostream>
#include <time.h>
#include "omp.h"

using namespace std;



int main()
{
    unsigned long long app = 0;
    {
        //mt19937_64 engine((omp_get_thread_num() + 1)); //USE FOR MULTITHREADING
        mt19937_64 engine; //USE FOR SINGLE THREAD
        uniform_real_distribution<double> zeroToOne(0.0, 1.0);

        //#pragma omp parallel for reduction(+:app) //USE FOR MULTITHREADING
        for (unsigned long long i = 0; i < 2000000000; i++)
        {
            if(zeroToOne(engine) < 0.5) app++;
        }
    }
    cout << app << endl;
    return 0;
}
 When I run the multi-threaded and single-threaded version of this program and keep track of the time, they take the same amount of time to finish after execution. Also, app does not have the same size in the two cases, but I suspect that is merely because of the different seeds. Question: Does the provided example correctly show how to force each thread to use its own RNG? If not, can I see an example of how this is done, or get a reference to some place where they explain how to achieve this?
@CODE:#include <random>
#include <iostream>
#include <time.h>
#include "omp.h"

using namespace std;



int main()
{
    unsigned long long app = 0;
    {
        //mt19937_64 engine((omp_get_thread_num() + 1)); //USE FOR MULTITHREADING
        mt19937_64 engine; //USE FOR SINGLE THREAD
        uniform_real_distribution<double> zeroToOne(0.0, 1.0);

        //#pragma omp parallel for reduction(+:app) //USE FOR MULTITHREADING
        for (unsigned long long i = 0; i < 2000000000; i++)
        {
            if(zeroToOne(engine) < 0.5) app++;
        }

 None of this impacts the correct functioning of the tests, but as one might imagine the appearance of "ERROR" and "WARNING" might be rather confusing to, for example, parsing rules in Jenkins looking for failures. Sure I can get really fancy with regular expression in the parsing rules, but it would be really nice to turn off this verbose and unnecessary logging on the part of chromedriver.exe. I have seen many mentions of this searching for an answer. No one has come up with a solution. Yes, chromedriver possibly has a "--silent" option, but there seems to be no way to pass that to the executable. Code similar to below is supposed to work, but has zero effect as far as I can see. Any ideas? profile = Selenium::WebDriver::Chrome::Profile.new

@TITLE:How to update my version of git on OSX 10.8
@CONTENT:I'm on OSX 10.8.2 and I'm running git git v1.7.4.4 I just installed git on a remote server and it's version 1.11.x. I'm I would like to be running the same version of the software but I cannot figure out how to update git on my laptop. I attempted to follow the steps listed here, which instruct to download the git-OSX-installer, run the install (which ran smoothly) and then do: $ sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin
$ sudo ln -s /usr/local/git/bin/git /usr/local/bin/git
 But after this I do git --version and it's still 1.7.4.4. Did I just reinstall the same version? Or did I install a newer version somewhere else? I've been reading similar questions and I think the issue is that OSX ships with an old version of git installed in a different location then where the git-osx-installer or mac ports will put it. But I'm not sure how to correct this. Thanks in advance for your advice. Update: which git returns: /usr/bin/git echo $PATH returns: /opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/usr/local/rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p194/bin:/usr/local/rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p194@global/bin:/usr/local/rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.3-p194/bin:/usr/local/rvm/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/git/bin:/opt/sm/bin:/opt/sm/pkg/active/bin:/opt/sm/pkg/active/sbin Update2: ESL ~/Downloads$ export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
ESL ~/Downloads$ which git

 It appears I installed the newer git version in local. So should I add the export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH to my .bash_profile? Is it a problem that both versions of git are installed? I added export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH to the bottom of my ~/.bash_profile and now the new version of git runs.

@TITLE:How can I modify the Load Balancing behavior Jenkins uses to control slaves?
@CONTENT:We use Jenkins for our CI build system. We also use 'concurrent builds' so that Jenkins will build each change independently. This means we often have 5 or 6 builds of the same job running simultaneously. To accommodate this, we have 4 slaves each with 12 executors. The problem is that Jenkins doesn't really 'load balance' among its slaves. It tries to build a job on the same slave that it previously built on (presumably to reduce the time syncing from source control). This is a problem because Jenkins will build all 6 instances of our build on the same slave (or more likely between 2 slaves). One build machine gets bogged down and runs very slowly while the rest of them sit idle. Is there a plugin or something that alters the load balancing behavior Jenkins uses to control its slaves?

@LINK:/questions/10805174/qobject-generic-signal-handler
@TITLE:QObject generic signal handler
@CONTENT:(With "signal handler" I mean slots, not handlers for POSIX signals.) I need to "connect" (probably not using QObject::connect directly) all signals from an instance of a (not yet known) subclass of QObject to one single slot of another QObject. I need this in order to send the signal (with arguments) over network (for an own RPC system with support for signals). (With "not yet known" I mean that my code should be as generic as possible. So it souldn't contain a connect statement for each signal in each class I'm using with my RPC system, but provide something like RPC::connectAllSignals(QObject*);, which then scanns all signals during runtime and connects them.) What I'd like to achieve is: Handle all signals and serialise them (signal name + arguments). I already can serialise the arguments, but I don't know how to get the signal name. After googling, it seems to be impossible to use something similar like there is sender() for the QObject instance. So I need to do something far more complicated. My current type system for passing the arguments to a target function on the remote end is restricted to some types anyway. (That's because I need qt_metacall, which excepts the arguments to be of type void* with the "correct types" behind them. My RPC system uses QVariants with only a couple of types internally and I convert them to void* of the correct types using custom methods. I heard about QVariant::constData too late to use it, and it probably won't fit anyway; so I will stick to my type conversion if there is no drawback.) The target slot, where all signals should be mapped to, should look similar to this: void handleSignal(QByteArray signalName, QVariantList arguments);
 It would be best if the solution is supported by C++03, so I only want to use variadic templates if it is a big drawback to not use them. In this case C++11 is OK, so I'm also happy about answers using C++11. Now my possible solution to the question I'm thinking about: I could scan all signals of the object using its QMetaObject and then creating a QSignalMapper (or something similar which passes all arguments) for each signal. This is easy, and I need no help on this part. As mentioned before, I'm already restricted to some types for arguments, and I can also live with a restriction on the argument count. It sounds like a dirty hack, but I could use some sort of custom, template-based signal mappers like this (in this example for three arguments): template<class T1, class T2, class T3>
class MySignalMapper : public QObject
{
    Q_OBJECT
public:
    void setSignalName(QByteArray signalName)
    {
        this->signalName = signalName;
    }
signals:
    void mapped(QByteArray signalName, QVariantList arguments);
public slots:
    void map(T1 arg1, T2 arg2, T3 arg3)
    {
        QVariantList args;
        // QVariant myTypeConverter<T>(T) already implemented:
        args << myTypeConverter(arg1);
        args << myTypeConverter(arg2);
        args << myTypeConverter(arg3);
        emit mapped(signalName, args);
    }
private:
    QByteArray signalName;
};
 Then I could connect a QMetaMethod called method (which is known to be a signal) of a QObject called obj like this (which might be generated using some sort of script for all supported types and argument counts... yeah... it's getting dirty!):     // ...
}
else if(type1 == "int" && type2 == "char" && type3 == "bool")
{
    MySignalMapper<int,char,bool> *sm = new MySignalMapper<int,char,bool>(this);
    QByteArray signalName = method.signature();
    signalName = signalName.left(signalName.indexOf('(')); // remove parameters
    sm->setMember(signalName);

    // prepend "2", like Qt's SIGNAL() macro does:
    QByteArray signalName = QByteArray("2") + method.signature();

    // connect the mapper:
    connect(obj, signalName.constData(),
            sm, SLOT(map(int,char,bool)));
    connect(sm, SIGNAL(mapped(int,char,bool)),
            this, SLOT(handleSignal(const char*,QVariantList)));
}
else if(type1 == ...)
{
    // ...
 As this may work, it really is a dirty solution. I'd need either a lot of macros to cover all combinations of types for at most N arguments (where N is about 3 to 5, not yet known), or a simple script generating the code for all cases. The problem is that this will be a lot of cases, as I'm supporting about 70 different types per argument (10 primitive types + nested lists and maps with depth 2 for every type of them). So for an argument count limit of N there are N ^ 70 cases to cover! Is there a completely different approach for this objective, which I'm overlooking? UPDATE: I solved the problem on my own (see answer).

@LINK:/questions/10667491/is-there-a-general-algorithm-for-microcontroller-eeprom-wear-leveling
@TITLE:Is there a general algorithm for microcontroller EEPROM wear leveling?
@CONTENT:I'm working on an Arduino library that will maximize the life of the AVR's EEPROM. It takes the number of variables you want to store and does the rest. This is my attempt, which does not work in all cases. Background information Atmel says each memory cell is rated for 100,000 write/erase cycles. They also provide an application note, which describes how to perform wear levelling. Here is a summary of the application note. By alternating writes across two memory addresses, we can increase the erase/write to 200,000 cycles. Three memory addresses gives you 300,000 erase/write cycles and so on. To automate this process, a status buffer is used to keep track of where the next write should be. The status buffer must also be the same length as the parameter buffer because wear leveling must be performed on it as well. Since we can't store the index of the next write we increment the corresponding index in the status buffer. Here is an example.    <------------------- EEPROM -------------------->  
   0                                               N
   -------------------------------------------------
       Parameter Buffer    |     Status Buffer     |
   -------------------------------------------------

   Initial state.
   [ 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 ]

   First write is a 7. The corresponding position
   in the status buffer is changed to previous value + 1.
   Both buffers are circular.
   [ 7 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 ]

   A second value, 4, is written to the parameter buffer 
   and the second element in the status buffer becomes
   the previous element, 1 in this case, plus 1.
   [ 7 | 4 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 ]

   And so on
   [ 7 | 4 | 9 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 ]
 To determine where the next write should occur, we look at the difference between elements. If the previous element + 1 does NOT equal the next element then that is where the next write should occur. For example:    Compute the differences by starting at the first
   element in the status buffer and wrapping around. 
   General algo: previous element + 1 = current element
   1st element:  0 + 1 = 1 = 1st element (move on)
   2nd element:  1 + 1 = 2 = 2nd element (move on)
   3rd element:  2 + 1 = 3 = 3rd element (move on)
   4th element:  3 + 1 = 4 != 4th element (next write occurs here)

   [ 7 | 4 | 9 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 ]
                 ^                       ^
                 |                       |

   Another edge case to consider is when the incrementing values
   wrap around at 256 because we are writing bytes. With the
   following buffer we know the next write is at the 3rd element 
   because 255 + 1 = 0 != 250 assuming we are using byte arithmetic.

   [ x | x | x | x | x | x | 254 | 255 | 250 | 251 | 252 | 253 ]
                                          ^
                                          | 

   After we write at element 3 the status buffer is incremented 
   to the next value using byte arithmetic and looks like this.
   255 + 1 = 0 (wrap around)
   0 + 1 != 251 (next write is here)

   [ x | x | x | x | x | x | 254 | 255 |  0  | 251 | 252 | 253 ]
                                                ^
                                                | 
 These examples above show how to extend the life of the EEPROM for one variable. For multiple variables imagine segmenting the EEPROM into multiple segments with the same data structure, but smaller buffers. Problem I have working code for what I described above. My problem is the algorithm does not work when the buffer length >= 256. Here is what happens    Buffer length of 256. The last zero is from
   the initial state of the buffer. At every index
   previous element + 1 == next element. No way to
   know where the next write should be.

   <-------------- Status Buffer ------------>
   [  1  |  2  | ... | 253 | 254 | 255 |  0  ]


   A similar problem occurs when the buffer length
   is greater than 256. A lookup for a read will think
   the next element is at the first 0 when it should be at 
   255.
   <-------------------- Status Buffer ------------------>
   [  1  |  2  | ... | 253 | 254 | 255 |  0  |  0  |  0  ]
 Question How can I solve the above problem? Is there a better way to track where the next element should be written?

@CONTENT:I have searched for PDF annotation on Google, stackoverflow, and Apple's developer library but none of them really satisfies my need. Here is my problem and my current knowledge of it, please correct me if I'm wrong. I would like to allow users to first select some lines of text to highlight, and then draw highlighting rectangles on top them. [Question]: How do we select text on a PDF page rendered by CGContextDrawPDFPage()? Specifically, if I were to override the touchesBegan/Moved/Ended delegate methods, what should I do in there in order to track the text frame that a user wants to select? I don't want to use FastPDFKit because it displays a logo and costs money, or UIWebView because it is very limited in terms of things that we can do with it, plus I would like to learn how to do this myself :-) Thanks! Derek -- UPDATE -- Potential solution: I could probably put a transparent view on top of my PDF, and while parsing the PDF content, build a rectangle for every Tj or every string element in TJ. Those rectangles would be the selectable "text" that users can highlight. One caveat is that some PDFs jam several words into one Tj, so that prevents users from selecting individual words in that case. I will try this approach and update the result later.

@TITLE:jQuery Animation, Chaining, .each() and .animate() (or fadeIn() and fadeOut())
@CONTENT:I'm having a bit of a trouble trying to figure this out today, i want to make 5 items inside my DOM (which is listed under the same attribute element, $('.elements')) fade in and out, and after reading up a bit on the API i thought .each() would be a fabulous idea to implement a fade in and fade out showcase gallery. However, i'm currently using: $('.elements').each(function() {
    $(this).fadeIn(2000).delay(200).fadeOut(2000).show();
})
 but everything gets faded in and out at once. How do i do a sequential effect where everything is chained together and it starts from the first item in the list (a.k.a - $('elements').eq(0)?) down to the last one, and then restarts again? Do i really need a while loop to do this in javascript/jquery? I was hoping there would be a similar function that i could chain for jQuery to perform to reduce load and filesize. Also, is there a way to restrict the images from overflowing out from my div?

@LINK:/questions/9881471/map-and-reduce-monad-for-clojure-what-about-a-juxt-monad
@TITLE:Map and Reduce Monad for Clojure¡K What about a Juxt Monad?
@CONTENT:Whilst learning Clojure, I've spent ages trying to make sense of monads - what they are and how we can use them.... with not too much success. However, I found an excellent 'Monads for Dummies' Video Series - http://vimeo.com/20717301 - by Brian Marik for Clojure So far, my understanding of monads is that it is sort of like a macro in that it allows a set of statements to be written in a form that is easy to read - but monads are much more formalised. My observations are limited to two examples: 1. The Identity Monad (or the 'let' monad) taken from http://onclojure.com/2009/03/05/a-monad-tutorial-for-clojure-programmers-part-1/ The form that we wish to write is: (let [a  1
      b  (inc a)]
  (* a b))
 and the corresponding monad is (domonad identity-m
    [a  1
     b  (inc a)]
 (* a b))
 2. The Sequence Monad (or the 'for' monad) taken from http://onclojure.com/2009/03/06/a-monad-tutorial-for-clojure-programmers-part-2/ The form we wish to write is: (for [a (range 5)
      b (range a)]
  (* a b))
 and the corresponding monad is (domonad sequence-m
  [a (range 5)
   b (range a)]
  (* a b))
 Monad Definitions in Clojure Looking at the source, using clojure monads library - https://github.com/clojure/algo.monads: user=>(use 'clojure.algo.monads)
nil
 indentity monad: user=> (source identity-m)
(defmonad identity-m
  [m-result identity
   m-bind   (fn m-result-id [mv f]
              (f mv))
  ])
 sequence monad: user=> (source sequence-m)
(defmonad sequence-m
   [m-result (fn m-result-sequence [v]
               (list v))
    m-bind   (fn m-bind-sequence [mv f]
               (flatten* (map f mv)))
    m-zero   (list)
    m-plus   (fn m-plus-sequence [& mvs]
               (flatten* mvs))
    ])
 So my conclusion is that a monad is some sort of a generalised higher-order function that takes in an input-function and input-values, adds its own control logic and spits out a 'thing' that can be used in a 'domonad' block. Question 1 So finally, to the questions: I want to learn how to write a monad and say I want to write a 'map monad' that imitates the 'map' form in clojure: (domonad map-m
  [a [1 2 3 4 5]
   b [5 6 7 8 9]]
  (+ a b))
 Should be equivalent to (map + [1 2 3 4 5] [5 6 7 8 9])
 and return the values [6 8 10 12 14]
 If I look at the source, it should give me something similar to identity-m and sequence-m: user=> (source map-m)
(defmonad map-m
   [m-result ...
    m-bind   ...
    m-zero   ...
    m-plus   ...
    ])
 Question 2 I also want to be able to define 'reduce-m' such that I can write: (domonad reduce-m
  [a [1 2 3 4 5]]
  (* a))
 this could potentially give me 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 = 120 or (domonad reduce-m
  [a [1 2 3 4 5]
   b [1 2 3 4 5]]
  (+ a b))
 will give me (1+2+3+4+5) + (1+2+3+4+5) = 30 Finally Would I also be able to write a 'juxt monad' that imitates the juxt function but instead of passing in values for binding, I pass in a set of functions. : (domonad juxt-m
  [a #(+ % 1)
   b #(* % 2)]
  '([1 2 3 4 5] b a) )
 gives [ [2 2] [4 3] [6 4] [8 5] [9 6] ] 
 Potentially, I could do all of those things with macros so I don't really know how useful these 'monads' will be or if they are even considered 'monads'... With all the resources on the internet, It seems to me that if I wanted to learn Monads properly, I have to learn Haskell and right now, learning another syntactic form is just too hard. I think I found some links that maybe relevant but it is too cryptic for me Please can someone shed some light!

@TITLE:BeanPostProcessor confusion
@CONTENT:I am trying to understand BeanPostProcessor in Spring and I don't understand what it does. Is it correct that the BeanPostProcessor defines two methods that is called at these points: Before initialization (either init method or afterPropertiesSet), but the instance is created. After the init method or afterPropertiesSet method is called Is that correct? Given the example and text on page 118 and further is confusing. I don't think I am allowed to copy more from the text to the question but the annotations and whats happening there is hard to understand. And are you supposed to implement this interface on the beans you want or are you supposed to use this on a bean that is general for many beans? I see that you get both and object and string argument passed in. Sometimes, you may find yourself in a position where you need to performsome additional processing immediately before and after Spring instantiates the bean. The processing can be as simple as modifying the bean or as complex as returning a completely different object! The BeanPostProcessor interface has two methods: postProcessBeforeInitialization, which is called before Spring calls any bean initialization hooks (such as InitializingBean.afterPropertiesSet or the init-method), and postProcessAfterInitialization, which Spring calls after the initialization hooks succeed.

@CONTENT:I've been using either Pig or Java for Map Reduce exclusively for running jobs against a Hadoop cluster thus far. I've recently tried out using Python Map Reduce through the Hadoop streaming and that was pretty cool as well. All of these make sense to me, but I'm a little hazy on when I would want to use one implementation v.s. another. Java map reduce, I've been using basically exclusively when I need speed, but when would I ever want to use something like Python streaming instead of just writing out the same thing in fewer, more easily understandable lines in PIG/Hive? In short, what are the pros and cons to each?

@TITLE:Generics, Polymorphism, Interfaces: what is the solution?
@CONTENT:I know the title is Very wide - spanning over a lot ! And I hope that this question might evolve to a bigger "info wiki thingy" on the subjects. What I have learned - so far: When using Generics - understand the concepts (covariance and contravariance). Do NOT "mis-use" the concept of generics combined with inheritance. I did and it could make you head directly into covariance problems! Make sure you "break off" the generic at the correct point in you inheritance - if you are combining the two. (please correct me - if you think i'm wrong, missing or have misunderstood anything). My problem was: But by now I've spend countless hours, trying to figure out, how to solve this "big puzzle" I have on my desk. And I've gotten some good answers from several of you SO users already - but now its time to get something working in a bigger scale. I ventured into Generics with this one: Generics and Polymorphism working together And now I'm kinda stuck on this one: Situations where Generics won't work Why I end up with covariance problems - is because of my class procedure in my hierarchy. So I'm wondering if Interfaces is my next bold move in this "saga". How do one "step over" a covariance problem. One thing is to find out that you actually have this problem - another thing is "how to work around it". So IF any of you good people "out there" has any opinions on this - I'm all ears. Basically : Tell me to go for Interfaces (I have never done one from scratch myself). Or .. throw me a bone in the direction you would suggest. My current source pool is as stated in the second link - from the top. Here is a small snippet from my earlier post that shows my covariance problem. David kindly explained - Why I ran into the bush.. But now I need info on - How to run around it. var

@CONTENT:when my page opens, I call the collection and populate the view: var pagColl = new pgCollection(e.models); 
var pagView = new pgView({collection: pagColl});
 Separately (via a Datepicker), I wish to want to populate the same collection with different models and instantiate the view again. The problem I have is how to close the original pagView and empty the pagColl before I open the new one, as this "ghost view" is creating problems for me. The variables referred to above are local variables? is it that I need to create a global pagColl and reset() this?

@CONTENT:SO I created a django project and app as per the tutorial and I have all the dependencies necessarry for MongoDB Engine it all seemed to be working fine and dandy till I tried enabling the admin interface.

@CONTENT:I'm using JavaScript to detect taps in a page I'm showing in a UIWebView, like so: <div id="wrapper">

<script>
  document.getElementById("wrapper").addEventListener('click', function() {
      document.location = 'internal://tap';

</script>
 I'm intercepting links with my web view delegate, and look for "internal://tap". When I get that, I prevent the web view from navigating, and respond to the tap. However doing this I lose the ability to select text. Tapping the link does still work correctly. In fact, just adding an event listener for 'click' removes the ability to select text, even if the handler doesn't attempt to change the document location. Any idea what I'm doing wrong?

@TITLE:How to optimize testng and seleniums tests
@CONTENT:For my internship, I have to use TestNG and selenium for testing a web-application. But I have a problem, sometimes selenium or the Browser is not working for some random reason, so a working test is marked as "failed". To avoid that, I can use the annotation @Test(invocationCount = 4, successPercentage = 25), then if the test succeeds one time, the test is marked as "Succeed", that's good but the problem is that this solution multiply the time for testing by 4, this is not very efficient. What I can do to decrease the time for testing, is to write some rule "if the test failed, rerun this test (and only if the test has failed), and if it worked the second, third, or the fourth time, then mark this test as "succeed" " So I can avoid these random bugs. But I've not found how to write this rule, I saw that we can add a listener, so we have a method called "onTestFailure" so I can do something when the test has failed but I don't know how to re-run the test. I also found testng-failed.xml where all the failed tests are saved, so we can run this xml file for rerun these tests, but this will erase the report from the previous first run, but I want just that the failed tests are marked as "succeed" if the second run is successful. (I have integrated testNG/selenium to Jenkins, so I have a graph with all tests, so this method is not very adapted, but this method don't multiply the time for testing by 4 and this is what I want) So if you have any clue for how to do that, it would be very nice. (sorry for my english, I'm french, so if you want to reply in french there is no problem :) ) Thanks !

if ($time->timeExpired()){

 It doesn't have to be exactly like above, but are there any native PHP functions or classes that do something like this? Edit: Ben Lee's answer with pcnt_fork would be the perfect solution except that it's not available for Windows. Is there any other way to accomplish this with PHP that works for Windows and Linux, but doesn't require an external library? Edit 2: XzKto's solution works in some cases, but not consistently and I can't seem to catch the exception, no matter what I try. The use case is detecting a timeout for a unit test. If the test times out, I want to terminate it and then move on to the next test.

@TITLE:Playing encrypted video
@CONTENT:What I want to do is next: We need to protect the video content(encrypt it) and be able to play it. Tricky part is that we do not want to load everything into memory at once and decrypt there.(though that is also a option) What am essentially looking for is the solution for us to play encrpyted video content, from HDD, such that only our APPLICATIOn can play that video. Yet it should read the file from block by block(because if we are dealing with 2GB file, it should not be loaded into memory all at once). Please let us know, what are possible ways? SilverLight4 DRM - Okay, this looks like reasonable solution, flexible enough for our needs. However, the PlayReady SDK costs about $30,000 and we do not want to use SilverLight. Presumably C# or C++ well one idea we had, is to split big video file to seperate encrypted video files(like sequence) and then load each file("block") to directly memory/decrypt it and play it from memory(and alternate between sequence files), this seems to be the easiest one yet and probably the one what could be really done. However, what libs are capable of playing video file from memoryStream? I do believe VLC should BE able to do it..? Another idea was to just take uncompressed AVI, process video frame by frame, modify each frame(encrypt it somehow), now when we play the video, we reprocess the frame in memory and decrypt it. Dealing with only one specific codec and writing custom solution for it - actually this sounds pretty cool but im afraid it will take us way too much time, but do let us know about this approach The another one, using VLC to play encrypted stream from localhost(eg APPLICATION is streaming encrypted HDD file to the localhost:800/BLAHBLAH) and the same application has VLC control there to decrypt the encrypted stream. We still dont know if the file on HDD can actually be encrypted too(so user would not be able to play that file on another player), plus VLC is GPL which is no good for us.

@TITLE:SVG: using getComputedTextLength to wrap text
@CONTENT:I'm trying to wrap text by building up a text string, and using 'getComputedTextLength' to find out when the text goes beyond the allowed width. However, I can't find a simple way to incrementally build up the text which will work with getComputedTextLength. The general idea is:   str = svgDocument.createTextNode(myText[word]); // first word on new line
  word++;
  obj = text.cloneNode(true);                     // new text element for this line
  obj.appendChild(str);
  svgDocument.documentElement.appendChild(obj);   // reqd for getComputedTextLength?
  for( ; word < myText.length; word++) {
     next_width = obj.getComputedTextLength();    // get current line width
     if(next_width >= extent)
        break;
     str += " ";                                  // add next word to the line
     str += myText[word];
     ...
  }
 Can anyone tell me how to get this to work? Presumably 'str' is copied rather than referenced in 'obj', but I've also tried putting 'obj.removeChild(str)' and 'obj.appendChild(str)' in the loop, but the appendChild crashes. I've also tried various combinations of moving around the documentElement.appendChild, and removing obj and re-appending it, and so on. Thanks - Al

@LINK:/questions/6778269/rails-3-polymorphic-liking-of-entities-by-user-how
@TITLE:Rails 3: Polymorphic liking of Entities by User, how?
@CONTENT:Background: I followed the tutorial here to setup a polymorphic User favorites data model in my application. This allows me to let a User make pretty much any Entity in the system which I add 'has_many :favorites, :as => :favorable' line to its model a favorite. I plan on using this to implement a Facebook style 'Like' system as well as several other similar systems. To start off I added the favoritability to a Post model (each user can create status updates like on Facebook). I have it all done and unit tested so I know the data model is sound and functioning from either side of the relationship (User and Post). Details: I have a Home controller with a single index method and view. on the index view I render out the posts for the user and the user's friends I want the user to be able to like posts from their friends The Posts controller has only a create and a destroy method with associated routes (not a full fledged resource) and through the Post method via AJAX posts are created and deleted without issue Where I am stuck How do I add the link or button to add the post to the user's Favorites? According to the tutorial the way to create a new Favorite through the polymorphic association is to do it from the Post.favorites.build(:user_id => current_user.id). From this direction the build handles pulling out the Post's ID and TYPE and all I have to do is pass in the user's id Do I use an AJAX form post to a Favorites controller with a Create and Destroy method similar to the Post controller? I am still struggling to uncross the wires in my brain from ASP.Net N-Tier web application development over to Rails MVC. Hasn't been too bad until now ;) I bet there are Gems out there that might do this but I need to learn and the best way is to suffer through it. Maybe a tutorial or sample code from someone who has implemented liking functionality within their application would be helpful. Thanks in advance for the assistance!

@LINK:/questions/6702740/core-data-search-optimization
@TITLE:Core Data search optimization
@CONTENT:I'm working on a search feature in one of my Core Data based apps and I'm trying to gather everyone's tips on search optimization to get it as fast as I possibly can. The search needs to be fast enough that it can deliver near-instantaneous results for database of 20,000+ objects. What I've done so far (as far as optimization goes) Implemented the technique shown in WWDC 2010 session 137, creating a keyword entity and creating a to-many relationship from my main object entities to it. The keyword entity's name attribute is indexed, and keywords are created during the initial import procedure by splitting apart relevant strings in the main entities and normalizing them (stripped of case and diacritics) Using >= and < binary comparators instead of BEGINSWITH, etc. My predicate format is: SUBQUERY(keywords, $keyword, ($keyword.name >= $LB) AND ($keyword.name < $UB)).@count != 0 Where $LB is the lower bounds string and $UB is upper bounds. I create a compound AND predicate using this format and the array of search terms. Right now, I'm executing a fetch once (when the user types the first letter) using a fetch batch size of about 20, and then narrowing down the search results using NSArray's -filteredArrayUsingPredicate method as they continue typing. I also prefetch the keywords relationship because this is used to filter. The part that takes up the most time, obviously, is the initial fetch. There's a noticeable delay of ~1-2s on a library of around 15,000 objects. Time profiling shows that it is indeed the fetch that is causing the delay: http://cl.ly/3a1b2022452M2V323f2H One other thing thats worth noting is that I have to fetch multiple entities for the results. All of the entities have a ranking attribute, but I can't fetch more than one at once so I'm forced to fetch them separately, combine them into a single array, and then sort manually via -sortedArrayUsingDescriptors. Any tips on how to speed this up would be greatly appreciated. EDIT: Based on @ImHuntingWabbits' suggestions: After adding a KeywordFirstChar entity, my data model (simplified) would look like this: Now, the questions is how would I write a predicate for the Car entity that fetches based on KeywordFirstChar? The only thing I can think of would be this: SUBQUERY(keywords, $keyword, $keyword.firstChar.char == %@) where %@ is the character to search for, but I don't know how this would be much more efficient considering that it still has to enumerate over keywords, unless I misinterpreted the suggestions.
@CODE:name >= < BEGINSWITH SUBQUERY(keywords, $keyword, ($keyword.name >= $LB) AND ($keyword.name < $UB)).@count != 0 $LB $UB AND keywords ranking -sortedArrayUsingDescriptors KeywordFirstChar Car KeywordFirstChar SUBQUERY(keywords, $keyword, $keyword.firstChar.char == %@) %@ keywords

Encrypt given string (from step 3) with 'rijndael-256' algo. (mcrypt family of functions). Encode to base64. Set cookie with given value. What do you think. Is this ok? What else could I implement with $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] check, to make sure that the cookie isn't stolen (except IP address)? P.S. From sensitive data cookie would contain only userId. EDIT: Ok to clear some things. I'm trying to make "safe" auth system that doesn't rely on sessions. The app in question is build more or less as pure restful api. Step 2: Problem: "Fu¡¦s protocol does not provide an answer to this question. There is only one key involved in Fu¡¦s proto- col, namely the server key. One straightforward solu- tion is to use this server key to encrypt the data field of every cookie; however, this solution is not secure." Solution: "Our solution to this problem is simple and efficient. We propose to use HMAC(user name|expiration time, sk) as the encryption key. This solution has the fol- lowing three good properties. First, the encryption key is unique for each different cookie because of the user name and expiration time. Note that whenever a new cookie is created, a new expiration time is included in the cookie. Second, the encryption key is unforgeable because the server key is kept secret. Third, the encryp- tion key of each cookie does not require any storage on the server side or within the cookie, rather, it is com- puted by a server dynamically. " From paper "A Secure Cookie Protocol" by Alex X. Liu1 , Jason M. Kovacs Step 4: Encrypts data (which would look something like this: 'marko@example.com|34234324234|324erfkh42fx34gc4fgcc423g4'), so that even client couldn't know exactly what's inside. Step 5: Base64 encode is there just to make final value pretty.

@TITLE:Where do you put your validation in asp.net mvc 3?
@CONTENT:One common recommended practice in asp.net mvc is that you should not send your business models to your views.. instead you should create viewmodels specific to each view. When that is done and you call the ModelState.IsValid method in your controller you are effectively checking the validity of the viewmodel but not the business object. What is the conventional approach to dealing with this? public class Person
{
public int ID {get; set;};

[Required]
public string Name {get; set;}

[Required]
public string LastName {get; set;}

public virtual ICollection<Exam> Exams {get; set;}

}

public class PersonFormViewModel
{

public int ID {get; set;};    


[Required]
public string Name {get; set;}

[Required]
public string LastName {get; set;}

}
 This is exactly what I have right now but Im not sure if the [Required] attribute should appear on both models or just the ViewModel or just the Business Model. Any tips on this issue are appreciatedd. More links to support my claim that it is a common good practice to always use view models.

@LINK:/questions/6462275/mathematica-and-c-c-exchanging-data
@TITLE:Mathematica and C/C++: Exchanging Data
@CONTENT:I would like to know how to exchange data between Mathematica and a C/C++ with pipes. In the Mathematica tutorial it says that "when you open a file or a pipe, Mathematica creates a 'stream object' that specifies the open stream associated with the file or pipe". I know how to create files in both C and Mathematica and I can make each program read and write to them. What I still don't know how to do is how to send output from C through a pipe to another program, much less how to even do this from Mathematica. Here is a function in which Mathematica that writes a matrix to a binary file as well as reading a file written in that format. writeDoubleMatrix[obj_, fileName_] := Module[{file},
  file = OpenWrite[fileName, BinaryFormat -> True];
  BinaryWrite[file, Length@obj, "Integer32"];
  BinaryWrite[file, Length@obj[[1]], "Integer32"];
  BinaryWrite[file, Flatten[obj], "Real64"];
  Close[file]
 ]
readDoubleMatrix[fileName_] := Module[{file, obj, m, n},
  file = OpenRead[fileName, BinaryFormat -> True];
  m = BinaryRead[file, "Integer32"];
  n = BinaryRead[file, "Integer32"];
  obj = BinaryReadList[file, "Real64", m*n];
  Close[file];
  Partition[obj, n]
 ]
 The first function will write 2 integers to a file (the size of the matrix) and the data of the matrix. I'm not doing any error checking here and thus I'm assuming that the data to be written is specifically in the form {{r11, r12, ..., r1n}, ...., {rm1, rm2, ..., rmn}}. The second function will be able to read the binary file and return the matrix. Next comes my C program. This program will read the data stored in the file MathematicaData.bin, multiply this matrix by 2 and write data to another file. // genData.c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv){
    int m, n, i;
    double* matrix;
    FILE* fin;
    FILE* fout;

    // Reading input file
    fin = fopen(argv[1], "rb");
    fread(&m, sizeof(int), 1, fin);
    fread(&n, sizeof(int), 1, fin);
    matrix = (double*)malloc(m*n*sizeof(double));
    fread(matrix, sizeof(double), m*n, fin);
    fclose(fin);

    //Modifying data
    for (i = 0; i < m*n; ++i) matrix[i] = 2*matrix[i];

    // Writing output file
    fout = fopen(argv[2], "wb");
    fwrite(&m, sizeof(int), 1, fout);
    fwrite(&n, sizeof(int), 1, fout);
    fwrite(matrix, sizeof(double), m*n, fout);
    fclose(fout);

    // De-allocate memory used for matrix.
    free(matrix);
    return 0;
 }
 This program does not have any error checking. You need to be careful how you use it otherwise the program may not detect the files or even allocate the amount of memory that you want. In any case, we can compile the program with your compiler of your choice. gcc -o genData genData.c
 And now we can try to use these functions to communicate between the two languages from Mathematica. matrix = {{1, 2, 3, 4}, {5, 6, 7, 8}, {9, 10, 11, 12}};
writeDoubleMatrix[matrix, "MathematicaData.bin"];
Run["./genData MathematicaData.bin CData.bin"];
readDoubleMatrix["CData.bin"]
 If everything went well the output you should get is {{2., 4., 6., 8.}, {10., 12., 14., 16.}, {18., 20., 22., 24.}}
 Yes, this is a very time consuming way of multiplying a matrix by 2 but this is just a simple example to show how to exchange data from Mathematica to C and from C to Mathematica. What I do not like is the fact that everything is stored to a file first and then it is read in the other program. Can someone show me how to exchange data without writing files. I have a feeling that pipes is what I need but I have no idea how to read or write them from neither language. It would be helpful if you could modify this program to adapt it to pipes. UPDATE: I found out how to make the C program "pipeable". //genDataPipe.c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv){
    int m, n, i;
    double* matrix;

    // Reading input file
    fread(&m, sizeof(int), 1, stdin);
    fread(&n, sizeof(int), 1, stdin);
    matrix = (double*)malloc(m*n*sizeof(double));
    fread(matrix, sizeof(double), m*n, stdin);

    //Modifying data
    for (i = 0; i < m*n; ++i) matrix[i] = 2*matrix[i];

    // Writing output file
    fwrite(&m, sizeof(int), 1, stdout);
    fwrite(&n, sizeof(int), 1, stdout);
    fwrite(matrix, sizeof(double), m*n, stdout);

    // Deallocate memory used for matrix.
    free(matrix);
    return 0;
}
 This means that we have to use the program like this: ./genDataPipe < fileIn.bin > fileOut.bin
 I have been searching in the documentation on the Mathematica side but all I have figured out that I can open a file by piping an external command. Take OpenWrite for instance: On computer systems that support pipes, OpenWrite["!command"] runs the external program specified by command, and opens a pipe to send input to it. This means that I can give my binary input directly to the c program. The problem is that I can't find a way of redirecting the output of the program. What I have come up with is, write a data to a file and make a wrapper to run the external command and read the contents of the output of the external command. Here we assume the existence of writeDoubleMatrix from before. getDataPipe[fileName_] := Module[{file, obj, m, n},
  file = OpenRead["!./genDataPipe < " <> fileName, 
  BinaryFormat -> True];
  m = BinaryRead[file, "Integer32"];
  n = BinaryRead[file, "Integer32"];
  obj = BinaryReadList[file, "Real64", m*n];
  Close[file];
  Partition[obj, n]
 ]
matrix = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}};
writeDoubleMatrix[matrix, "MData.bin"];
output = getDataPipe["MData.bin"]
 Which results in output having the following contents {{2., 4., 6.}, {8., 10., 12.}}. The only goal that remains now is to find out how to eliminate the need of writeDoubleMatrix and pass the data directly without having to write a file.
@CODE:writeDoubleMatrix[obj_, fileName_] := Module[{file},
  file = OpenWrite[fileName, BinaryFormat -> True];
  BinaryWrite[file, Length@obj, "Integer32"];

I assume the program would be entirely in VB, but didn't know if I would have the option of writing something in VB.NET or (preferably) C#. Also, I despise the presentation layer: any good GUI-builders for Access applications?

@TITLE:Object Oriented implementation of graph data structures
@CONTENT:I have been reading quite a bit graph data structures lately, as I have intentions of writing my own UML tool. As far as I can see, what I want can be modeled as a simple graph consisting of vertices and edges. Vertices will have a few values, and will so best be represented as objects. Edges does not, as far as I can see, need to be neither directed or weighted, but I do not want to choose an implementation that makes it impossible to include such properties later on. Being educated in pure object oriented programming, the first things that comes to my mind is representing vertices and edges by classes, like for example: Class: Vertice
    - Array arrayOfEdges;
    - String name;

Class: Edge
    - Vertice from;
    - Vertice to;
 This gives me the possibility to later introduce weights, direction, and so on. Now, when I read up on implementing graphs, it seems that this is a very uncommon solution. Earlier questions here on Stack Overflow suggests adjacency lists and adjacency matrices, but being completely new to graphs, I have a hard time understanding why that is better than my approach. The most important aspects of my application is having the ability to easily calculate which vertice is clicked and moved, and the ability to add and remove vertices and edges between the vertices. Will this be easier to accomplish in one implementation over another? My language of choice is Objective-C, but I do not believe that this should be of any significance.

@QREC:5629972
@LINK:/questions/5629972/integrating-json-feed-with-backbone-js
@TITLE:Integrating JSON feed with Backbone JS
@CONTENT:I'm currently working on a project where I type a keyword inside an input box and when I click send it hits a PHP server with a link like (localhost/json-status.php?query=input text) and it returns whatever is after "query=" in json format. Now I've accomplished this with jQuery and I'm trying to do this again in backbone js. $("#updateStatus").click(function(){

   var query = $("#statusBar").val();

   var url = "json-status.php" + "?query=" + query;

   $.getJSON(url,function(json){
            $.each(json.posts,function(i,post){
         $("#content").append(
            '<div>'+
               '<p>'+post.status+'</p>'+
            '</div>'
         );
      });
   });
});
 I've pretty much ported over what I did in jQuery over to backbone js and it's not working out as expected so far, please let me know if my approach is correct and how I can solve my problem. backbone code: (function ($) {
   Status = Backbone.Model.extend({
      status: null
   });

   StatusList = Backbone.Collection.extend({
      initialize: function (models, options) {
         this.bind("add", options.view.addStatusList);
      }
   });

   AppView = Backbone.View.extend({
      el: $("body"),
      initialize: function () {
         this.status = new StatusList( null, { view: this });
      },
      events: {
         "click #updateStatus":   "getStatus",
      },
      getStatus: function () {
         var url = "json-status.php" + "?query=" + $("#statusBar").val();
         var statusModel;

         $.getJSON(url,function(json){
            $.each(json.posts,function(i,post){
               statusModel = new Status({ status: post.status });
               this.status.add( statusModel );
            });
         });
      },
      addStatusList: function (model) {
         $("#status").prepend("<div>" + model.get('status') + "</div>");
      }
   });

   var appview = new AppView;
})(jQuery);
 PHP server code which returns in json format (this works fine): <?php
    $getQuery = $HTTP_GET_VARS["query"];

    $json='
    {"posts":[
        {
            "status": "' . $getQuery . '"
        }
    ]}
    ';
    echo $json;
?>

@TITLE:GridView scrolling problem on Android
@CONTENT:this must be somethng very simple I'm overlooking, but I have the following problem (the post is rather lengthy, but I want to provide as much info as possible :) ). I have a gridview in my Android application where each cell holds custom view: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<RelativeLayout
  xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"

 My adapter looks like this: public class ImageAdapter extends BaseAdapter {
    private List<String> mPictures = null;

    public ImageAdapter(List<String> pictures) {
         mPictures = pictures;
    }

    public int getCount() {
          return mPictures != null ? mPictures.size() : 0;
    }
    public Object getItem(int position) {
          return mPictures != null ?  mPictures.get(position) : null;
    }
    public long getItemId(int position) {
          return mPictures != null ? position : -1;
    }
    @Override
    public View getView(int position,View convertView,ViewGroup parent) 
    {
        ImageThumbView i = null;
        try
            {               
            Thread.sleep(100);

            if (convertView == null) 
            {
                String path = mPictures.get(position);
                Log.d(((Integer)position).toString(), path);
                i = addSingleView(_li, path);
                TextView idx = (TextView) i.findViewById(R.id.caption);
                if (idx != null)
                    idx.setText(((Integer)position).toString());
            }
            else 
            {
                Log.d(((Integer)position).toString(), "ALREADY NOT NULL");
                i = (ImageThumbView) convertView;
                                    // These 2 lines were added only in desperate attempt to get it working, but it makes no difference
                String path = mPictures.get(position);
                i.updateView(path);
            }
        }
        catch(InterruptedException ie)
        {
            ie.printStackTrace();
        }
    return i;
        }
}
 So initially it works properly, ie it shows first 18 images and few pixels from the next row. But when I start scrolling the gridvew, the images start to appear at random, ie after the last image I see few from the beginning and so on. Out of curiosity, I've tried few samples like this one: http://androidsamples.blogspot.com/2009/06/how-to-display-thumbnails-of-images.html ...and see the same result. So, am I doing something wrong? why on earth would GridView display more items than it is supposed to do? and why do items appear at the wrong positions? BR, Alex

I have a PDF with embedded annotations. Each annotation has an URL. I can find the coordinates of touch area but the question is how I can find if there is an annotation under my finger and how to extract URL to open it in browser?

 On the top status bar I see 'Attaching to AppName'. The only weird thing about the project is it has a dependency on ZXingWidget for QR code scans. Weirder that it works on a co-workers computer, but not mine. Tried removing my build directory, no dice. I can run other iPhone projects from source in Xcode 4 with no problem. Has anyone else seen this?

@LINK:/questions/5323291/node-formidable-and-a-simple-progress-bar
@TITLE:node-formidable and a simple progress bar
@CONTENT:If I look into the node-formidable documentation I can read: "Event: 'progress' (bytesReceived, bytesExpected)
Emitted after each incoming chunk of data that has been parsed. 
Can be used to roll your    own progress bar."
 I am wondering how to implement my own progress bar I mean how to read that information client side? I am quite confused. Is it implemented with a polling GET that starts after the POST has started or is it possible to read the information from the POST request while uploading? If I look at this: http.createServer(function(req, res) {
  if (req.url == '/upload' && req.method.toLowerCase() == 'post') {
    // parse a file upload
    var form = new formidable.IncomingForm();
    form.parse(req, function(err, fields, files) {
      res.writeHead(200, {'content-type': 'text/plain'});
      res.write('received upload:\n\n');
      res.end(sys.inspect({fields: fields, files: files}));
    });
    return;
  }
 Look like the /upload url is handling the POST request and returning something res.write('received upload:\n\n'); My question is who can read that res.write('received upload:\n\n');
@CODE:"Event: 'progress' (bytesReceived, bytesExpected)

    if (have_posts()) : while (have_posts()) : the_post();
        $posttags = get_the_tags();
        if ($posttags) {
            foreach($posttags as $tag) {
                $all_tags_arr[] = $tag -> name;
            }
        }
    endwhile; endif; 

    $tags_arr = array_unique($all_tags_arr);
?>
    <ul>
<?php
    foreach($tags_arr as $tag){
        echo '<li>'.$tag.'</li>';
    }
?>
</ul>
<?php wp_reset_query(); ?>
 UPDATE( simplified )::: to make a list of tags from a specific category this code is much better(just change the category name): ::Recently updated again because of a loop error::     <ul>
                <?php
                    query_posts('category_name=html');
                    if (have_posts()) : while (have_posts()) : the_post();

                        if( get_the_tag_list() ){
                            echo $posttags = get_the_tag_list('<li>','</li><li>','</li>');

                    wp_reset_query();

@TITLE:Python's super(), abstract base classes, and NotImplementedError
@CONTENT:Abstract base classes can still be handy in Python. In writing an abstract base class where I want every subclass to have, say, a spam() method, I want to write something like this: class Abstract(object):
    def spam(self):
        raise NotImplementedError
 The challenge comes in also wanting to use super(), and to do it properly by including it in the entire chain of subclasses. In this case, it seems I have to wrap every super call like the following: class Useful(Abstract):
    def spam(self):
        try:
            super(Useful, self).spam()
        except NotImplementedError, e:
            pass
        print("It's okay.")
 That's okay for a simple subclass, but when writing a class that has many methods, the try-except thing gets a bit cumbersome, and a bit ugly. Is there a more elegant way of subclassing from abstract base classes? Am I just Doing It Wrong?
@CODE:spam() class Abstract(object):
    def spam(self):
        raise NotImplementedError super() super class Useful(Abstract):

        except NotImplementedError, e:

@CONTENT:I am trying to write a blur shader for the iPad. I have it working but I am not very happy with the results. I get very choppy frame rates and the blur looks like crap when blur amount is high. Any ideas on how to improve things? Some sample output: uniform sampler2D texture;
varying mediump vec2 fragTexCoord;
varying mediump vec3 eyespaceNormal;

varying highp float blurAmount;

void main(void)
{
    highp vec2 gaussFilter[7];
    gaussFilter[0] = vec2(-3.0, 0.015625);
    gaussFilter[1] = vec2(-2.0, 0.09375);
    gaussFilter[2] = vec2(-1.0, 0.234375);
    gaussFilter[3] = vec2(0.0, 0.3125);
    gaussFilter[4] = vec2(1.0, 0.234375);
    gaussFilter[5] = vec2(2.0, 0.09375);
    gaussFilter[6] = vec2(3.0, 0.015625);

    highp float blurSize = blurAmount * 1.0;

    /////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // 7x1 gaussian blur fragment shader
    /////////////////////////////////////////////////

    highp vec4 color = vec4(0,0,0,1);

    for( int i = 0; i < 7; i++ )
    {
        color += texture2D( texture, vec2( fragTexCoord.x+gaussFilter[i].x*blurSize, fragTexCoord.y+gaussFilter[i].x*blurSize ) )*gaussFilter[i].y;
    }

    gl_FragColor = color;
}
 Edit: A box blur may be the way to go. Here is a box blur version of the shader: highp vec4 color = vec4(0,0,0,1);

color += texture2D(texture, vec2(fragTexCoord.x, fragTexCoord.y - 4.0*blurAmount)) * 0.05;
color += texture2D(texture, vec2(fragTexCoord.x, fragTexCoord.y - 3.0*blurAmount)) * 0.09;
color += texture2D(texture, vec2(fragTexCoord.x, fragTexCoord.y - 2.0*blurAmount)) * 0.12;
color += texture2D(texture, vec2(fragTexCoord.x, fragTexCoord.y - blurAmount)) * 0.15;
color += texture2D(texture, vec2(fragTexCoord.x, fragTexCoord.y)) * 0.16;
color += texture2D(texture, vec2(fragTexCoord.x, fragTexCoord.y + blurAmount)) * 0.15;
color += texture2D(texture, vec2(fragTexCoord.x, fragTexCoord.y + 2.0*blurAmount)) * 0.12;
color += texture2D(texture, vec2(fragTexCoord.x, fragTexCoord.y + 3.0*blurAmount)) * 0.09;
color += texture2D(texture, vec2(fragTexCoord.x, fragTexCoord.y + 4.0*blurAmount)) * 0.05;

gl_FragColor = color;

@TITLE:Django : Is it a good idea to generate JS dynamically?
@CONTENT:When I write my JS files for a Django project, of course I do some AJAX calls, and for the moment the urls for those calls are hard-coded (which is very ugly). I was thinking of having the JS files served by django (instead of Apache), so I could take advantage of the template tags ({% url %} !!!). Is there a reason why I shouldn't do this ? Or is there a right way to do this ? (I can give a least one : it will consume a lot of time resending JS files that haven't changed. What would be great is to have an application that generates files when restarting django server, and serves them statically after !)

Does anyone have any tips on how I go about doing this? I've thought about screen capturing a document loaded using UIDocumentInteractionController or UIWebView but this means they'd all have to be thumbnailed before displaying the table.

 The problem that I'm facing is that some_function() takes some time to execute and I would like the post request to return straight away when called and for some_function() to be executed in another thread/process if possible. I'm using berkeley db as the database and what I'm trying to do is relatively simple. I have a database of users each with a filter. If the filter matches the message, the server will send the message to the user. Currently I'm testing with thousands of users and hence upon each publication of a message via a post request it's iterating through thousands of users to find a match. This is my naive implementation of doing things and hence my question. How do I do this better?

@TITLE:How should I architect my DB & API server for a turn based multiplayer iPhone board game? (thinking about nodejs, mongo, couch, etc)
@CONTENT:I'm working on a turn based board game for iPhone and eventually Android. I'm using Appcelerator Titanium to develop it. My multiplayer design is similar to Words With Friends. Users take turns when ready, and then the opponent's game board is updated accordingly. One of my needs is to have a messaging API which enables the 2 players' devices to update one another on the status of the game board after a move. Thinking of doing this with JSON and keeping a JSON object on the device which contains the location of all game board pieces at any given time. This is the object that will need to update on the local device and then send a change to the opponent's device after a move is made. I've done APIs in the past for mobile platforms and to do so I've used PHP with MySQL and sent JSON back and forth between the API server and the mobile device. Works just dandy for low concurrent users, and generally non-massive apps. Here's to hoping this one will get massive ;) So now, instead of a general httpd server and the like, I'm starting to think about persistent sockets and if they're needed or not for my new game. I'm also thinking that it might be smart to forgo the big LAMP stack, and for scalability and maybe ease of development, to lean more towards a data flow of something like Mongo/Couch -> node.js -> iPhone. I'll be honest, it would be my first foray into a non-sql db and node.js as well. Interested to hear others' takes and experiences on this, more options/thoughts, and whether I am thinking about it the right way, or just creating headaches for myself.

@TITLE:Dynamic UI Generation in C#
@CONTENT:I am designing an application for a library. Not a large scale library, but a very small scale library where my primary task is to just keep information about the books. But this library application should be able to adapt to any professional's private library. For an example, for a lawyer, apart from the basic information about the book (title, author, publisher etc), there maybe other special fields that is associated with a book (Case Number, Court Number etc). A doctor may have some other special attributes for a book. Same goes for other professions. So I am going to use an SQL Server CE database and I am hoping to have a BOOK table with the usual attributes and on demand ALTER the table to suit the special needs (add more columns). But my worry is generating the GUI dynamically to support the new attributes. Are there any approaches to tackle the dynamic GUI generation? I am not asking for complete code (which obviously I wont get), but if you do have any coding to support the approach, please be kind enough to post it :) Is there anything I should know about the pros, cons, dead ends, cautions or warnings etc?

 So I found a common fix for this problem: increasing heap and permgen space with: set CATALINA_OPTS="-Xms1024m -Xmx1024m -XX:PermSize=128m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m"
 Added into C:\apache-tomcat-6.0.26\bin\catalina.bat. Unfortunately this didn't work, but the problem is that I'm not sure that Tomcat is picking it up. I checked various logs but these options are never printed out. Is there a way to log them and make sure that Tomcat has read them? EDIT: I tried to add the following JVM options with tomcat6w.exe: -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled
-XX:+CMSPermGenSweepingEnabled 
-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC
 And nothing changed. I get a permGen after 2-3 minutes of uptime. Any other idea? Cheers! Mulone

@CONTENT:This is an interview question I found in a website, the questions says: "In virtual memory, can two different processes have the same address? When you answer "No" which is correct, how one process can access another process' memory, for example the debugger can access the variables and change them while debugging?" What I understand is : 2 diff process can have same virtual memory address. This is because each process has its own page table. Each process thinks it as 4Gb memory on a 32-bit machine. So both P1 and P2 can access address 0xabcdef - but the physical memory location might be different. Isnt this right ? The debugger works on the same principle - 2 processes can access the same address. So it can modify variables etc on the fly.

I've read that that is because the dBFS spectrum for 16 bit audio recordings is only 96 dB. I tried modifying this piece of code in the init function: dataFormat.mSampleRate = 44100.0f;
dataFormat.mFormatID = kAudioFormatLinearPCM;
dataFormat.mFramesPerPacket = 1;
dataFormat.mChannelsPerFrame = 1;
dataFormat.mBytesPerFrame = 2;
dataFormat.mBytesPerPacket = 2;
dataFormat.mBitsPerChannel = 16;
dataFormat.mReserved = 0;
 I changed the value of mBitsPerChannel, hoping to increase the bit value of the recording. dataFormat.mBitsPerChannel = 32;
 With that variable set to 32, the "mAveragePower" function returns only 0. So, how can i measure more decibels? All my code is practically the same as in the tutorial i posted above. Thanks in advance, Thomas
@CODE:dataFormat.mSampleRate = 44100.0f;
dataFormat.mFormatID = kAudioFormatLinearPCM;
dataFormat.mFramesPerPacket = 1;
dataFormat.mChannelsPerFrame = 1;
dataFormat.mBytesPerFrame = 2;
dataFormat.mBytesPerPacket = 2;
dataFormat.mBitsPerChannel = 16;
dataFormat.mReserved = 0; dataFormat.mBitsPerChannel = 32;

@TITLE:Howto project a planar polygon on a plane in 3d-space
@CONTENT:I want to project my Polygon along a vector to a plane in 3d Space. I would preferably use a single transformation matrix to do this, but I don't know how to build a matrix of this kind. Given the plane's parameters (ax+by+cz+d), the world coordinates of my Polygon. As stated in the the headline, all vertices of my polygon lie in another plane. the direction vector along which to project my Polygon (currently the polygon's plane's normal vector) goal -a 4x4 transformation matrix which performs the required projection, or some insight on how to construct one myself UPDATE Thank you for the answer, it works as intended. A word of caution to the people who found this: If the Plane of projection's normal is parallel to the projection vector, the Denominator D will become (almost) 0, so to avoid strange things from happening, some kind of handling for this special case is needed. I solved it by checking if D < 1e-5, and if so, just translate my polygon along hte extrusion vector.

@TITLE:Transposing JSON list-of-dictionaries for analysis in R
@CONTENT:I have experimental data expressed as dicts of key-value pairs for each experiment. A set of related experiments is serialized as a list of these dicts in JSON. This is parseable in in R via the rjson package, but the data is loaded in a form which is challenging to analyze data <- fromJSON('[{"k1":"v1","k2":"v2"}, {"k1":"v3","k2":"v4"}]')
 yields [[1]]
[[1]]$k1
[1] "v1"

[[1]]$k2
[1] "v2"


[[2]]
[[2]]$k1
[1] "v3"

[[2]]$k2
[1] "v4"
 Attempting to turn this into a data.frame directly with as.data.frame(data) yields:   k1 k2 k1.1 k2.1
1 v1 v2   v3   v4
 clearly viewing the the sequence of key/value pairs across all experiments as a flat 1-dimensional list. What I want is a more conventional table with a row for each experiment, and a column for each unique key:   k1 k2
1 v1 v2
2 v3 v4
 How can I cleanly express this transform in R?
@CODE:rjson data <- fromJSON('[{"k1":"v1","k2":"v2"}, {"k1":"v3","k2":"v4"}]') [[1]]

@TITLE:CodeIgniter: Dynamic post-login redirection?
@CONTENT:I'm building a basic CodeIgniter site that requires a login before you can access any of the site. If a user visits some site url, something like this: http://www.mysite.com/project/detail/2049
 AND they are current logged out, I have it set to automatically kick them back to the login page. My question is, after they login, what is the best way to redirect them to the original URL they typed in, instead of say, redirecting them to the websites homepage? I was thinking maybe, dynamically create the URL as a hidden form element in the login form and redirect there upon a successful login... What do you guys think? Is there a better/best practice for this type of dynamic post-login redirection?

Are there any best practice patterns out there for how to implement this sort of thing? I'm most interested in how the database for this would look. What would this look like from a SQL perspective (any database)? What would this look like from a NOSQL perspective (any NOSQL database)? The thing I am most interested in, is how is the question of "content visibility" solved within the database? i.e. how does the database/application ensure that only approved friends may see the user created content?

@CONTENT:I have a Tomcat6 running on a Windows2003 machine. I deployed 2 Grails apps on this server and I soon noticed that everything was crashing sometime after the deploy with a classic PermGen error. java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: PermGen space

 java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClassCond(ClassLoader.java:632)
 java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass(ClassLoader.java:616)

 So I found a common fix for this problem: increasing heap and permgen space with: set CATALINA_OPTS="-Xms1024m -Xmx1024m -XX:PermSize=128m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m"
 Added into C:\apache-tomcat-6.0.26\bin\catalina.bat. Unfortunately this didn't work, but the problem is that I'm not sure that Tomcat is picking it up. I checked various logs but these options are never printed out. Is there a way to log them and make sure that Tomcat has read them? EDIT: I tried to add the following JVM options with tomcat6w.exe: -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled
-XX:+CMSPermGenSweepingEnabled 
-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC
 And nothing changed. I get a permGen after 2-3 minutes of uptime. Any other idea? Cheers! Mulone

@CONTENT:This is an interview question I found in a website, the questions says: "In virtual memory, can two different processes have the same address? When you answer "No" which is correct, how one process can access another process' memory, for example the debugger can access the variables and change them while debugging?" What I understand is : 2 diff process can have same virtual memory address. This is because each process has its own page table. Each process thinks it as 4Gb memory on a 32-bit machine. So both P1 and P2 can access address 0xabcdef - but the physical memory location might be different. Isnt this right ? The debugger works on the same principle - 2 processes can access the same address. So it can modify variables etc on the fly.

@CONTENT:I am trying to contribute to a project that uses Subversion. I used Mercurial and its hgsubversion extension to clone the repo. My work takes place on a feature branch. How do I keep the feature branch up to date with stuff that happens on the default branch (hg speak) aka the trunk (svn speak)? So I used hg up feature to update to the feature branch, then hg pull which gave me changesets on the default branch. So I did hg merge default, the committed the merge, then tried hg push to send my changesets to Subversion. And Mercurial said: "Sorry, can't find svn parent of a merge revision."

@TITLE:How to get a volume measurement of iPhone recording in dB, with a limit of at least 120dB
@CONTENT:I am trying to make a simple volume meter for the iPhone. I want the volume to be displayed in dB. When using this turorial, I am only getting measurements up to 78 dB. I've read that that is because the dBFS spectrum for 16 bit audio recordings is only 96 dB. I tried modifying this piece of code in the init function: dataFormat.mSampleRate = 44100.0f;
dataFormat.mFormatID = kAudioFormatLinearPCM;
dataFormat.mFramesPerPacket = 1;
dataFormat.mChannelsPerFrame = 1;
dataFormat.mBytesPerFrame = 2;
dataFormat.mBytesPerPacket = 2;
dataFormat.mBitsPerChannel = 16;
dataFormat.mReserved = 0;
 I changed the value of mBitsPerChannel, hoping to increase the bit value of the recording. dataFormat.mBitsPerChannel = 32;
 With that variable set to 32, the "mAveragePower" function returns only 0. So, how can i measure more decibels? All my code is practically the same as in the tutorial i posted above. Thanks in advance, Thomas

@TITLE:Howto project a planar polygon on a plane in 3d-space
@CONTENT:I want to project my Polygon along a vector to a plane in 3d Space. I would preferably use a single transformation matrix to do this, but I don't know how to build a matrix of this kind. Given the plane's parameters (ax+by+cz+d), the world coordinates of my Polygon. As stated in the the headline, all vertices of my polygon lie in another plane. the direction vector along which to project my Polygon (currently the polygon's plane's normal vector) goal -a 4x4 transformation matrix which performs the required projection, or some insight on how to construct one myself UPDATE Thank you for the answer, it works as intended. A word of caution to the people who found this: If the Plane of projection's normal is parallel to the projection vector, the Denominator D will become (almost) 0, so to avoid strange things from happening, some kind of handling for this special case is needed. I solved it by checking if D < 1e-5, and if so, just translate my polygon along hte extrusion vector.

Are there any best practice patterns out there for how to implement this sort of thing? I'm most interested in how the database for this would look. What would this look like from a SQL perspective (any database)? What would this look like from a NOSQL perspective (any NOSQL database)?

@TITLE:Extending FutureTask, how to handle cancel
@CONTENT:I've extended FutureTask from java.util.concurrent to provide callbacks to track the execution of tasks submitted to an ExecutorService. public class StatusTask<V> extends FutureTask<V> {

    private final ITaskStatusHandler<V> statusHandler;

    public StatusTask(Callable<V> callable, ITaskStatusHandler<V> statusHandler){
        super(callable);
        if (statusHandler == null)
            throw new NullPointerException("statusHandler cannot be null");
        this.statusHandler = statusHandler;
        statusHandler.TaskCreated(this);
    }

    @Override

        statusHandler.TaskRunning(this);

    }

    @Override
    protected void done() {
        super.done();
        statusHandler.TaskCompleted(this);
    }

}
 Now, what I see is if the task is submitted, but ends up queued and i cancel(true); the task - the run() method still gets called - and the FutureTask.run() (likely) checks that the task is cancelled and doesn't call the wrapped callable. Should I do e.g. @Override
public void run() {
  if(!isCancelled()) {  
    statusHandler.TaskRunning(this);
    super.run();
  }
}
 Or should I still call super.run() ? Both these approaches seems susceptible to race conditions in between checking for cancellation and doing something about it.. any thoughts appreciated.
@CODE:FutureTask java.util.concurrent ExecutorService public class StatusTask<V> extends FutureTask<V> {

    private final ITaskStatusHandler<V> statusHandler;

 Which seems like it would be the logical django equivalent of the example in the docs: from google.appengine.api import images

class Guestbook(webapp.RequestHandler):

    greeting = Greeting()
    if users.get_current_user():

    greeting.avatar = db.Blob(avatar)
    greeting.put()
    self.redirect('/')
 (source: http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/images/usingimages.html#Transform) But, I keep getting an error that says: NotImageError / Empty image data. and refers to this line: image = images.resize(request.POST.get('image'), 100, 100)
 I'm having trouble getting to the image data. Seems like it's not being uploaded but I can't figure out why. My form has the enctype="multipart/form-data" and all that. I think something's wrong with how I'm referring to the image data. "request.POST.get('image')" but I can't figure out how else to reference it. Any ideas? Thanks in advance.

@LINK:/questions/1550831/what-is-the-profile-of-a-sharepoint-developer
@TITLE:What is the profile of a SharePoint developer
@CONTENT:I have a development team specialized in ASP.NET. So the solutions we provide are web based, running on IIS and using MS SQL server. Everything within the intranet of the company. The team has this expertise, and they are excellent in C#, and .Net in general. The company is deploying SharePoint MOSS 2007. This deployment is part of a project that I am not involved in, and for which I have very little information. However I know that they have established the "thinkers" layer (those who will say what to do), the integrations layer (the who will configure, deploy and manage the production), and that they need to establish the so called development layer (those who will do things the other two can't). I am asked to evaluate the possibility to increase my team's expertise by adding SharePoint development. This is the easy part, I just have to find the required training and send my people. However these days the word development could mean a lot of things and sometimes I discover that configuration is used in place of development. I don't have any objections to evolve the team by developing new expertise, but I want to be sure to keep things stimulating for my developers. Secondly I don't want to say that we have SharePoint development expertise, and actually what we do is just modifying css or xml files. Also, I don't think that using wizards to produce a solution is the best path to push a C# developer to follow. The questions I am asking myself first is : what is the background of a SharePoint developer? how could .Net developers feel if asked to become SharePoint developers? Any thoughts will be greatly appreciated.

@TITLE:Is my ASP.NET MVC application structured properly?
@CONTENT:I've been going through the tutorials (specifically ones using Linq-To-Entities) and I understand the basic concepts, however some things are giving me issues. The tutorials usually involve only simple models and forms that only utilize basic create, update and delete statements. Mine are a little more complicated, and I'm not sure I'm going about this the right way because when it comes time to handle the relationships of a half dozen database objects, the tutorials stop helping. For the post method, the usual way of performing CRUD operations entities.AddToTableSet(myClass);
entities.SaveChanges();
 Won't do what I want, because a fully implemented class isn't getting posted to the controller method. I may post individual fields, form collections, or multiple DTO objects and then call a method on a service or repository to take the information I receive from a form post, along with information that it needs to query for or create itself, and then from all of those things, create my database object that I can save. [AcceptVerbs(HttpVerbs.Post)]
public ActionResult Add(int id, [Bind(Exclude = "Id")] ClassA classA,
                        [Bind(Exclude = "Id")]ClassB classB)
{
   // Validation occurs here

   if(!ModelState.IsValid)
      return View();

   try
   {
      _someRepositoryOrService.Add(id, classA, classB);
      return RedirectToAction("Index", new { id = id });
   }
   catch(Exception ex)
   {
      // Logging and exception handling occurs here
   }
}


public void Add(int id, ClassA classA, ClassB classB)
{
    EntityA eA = new EntityA
    {
        // Set a bunch of properties using the two classes and
        // whatever queries are needed
    };

    EntityB eB = new EntityB
    {
        // Set a bunch of properties using the two classes and
        // whatever queries are needed
    };

    _entity.AddToEntityASet(eA);
    _entity.AddToEntityBSet(eB);
    _entity.SaveChanges();
}
 Am I handling this correctly or am I bastardizing the framework? I never actually use an entity object directly, whenever I query for one I put the information I need in a DTO and base my Views off of that. Same goes with the creation. Is this allowed, or is my avoidance of using entities directly going against the purpose of using the framework? Edit: I'm also worried about this approach because it requires empty constructors to properly do the LINQ queries because of this error message: Only parameterless constructors and initializers are supported in LINQ to Entities. This isn't a big deal since I rarely need logic int the constructors, but is this an issue to have no constructors and only public properties?
@CODE:entities.AddToTableSet(myClass);

@CONTENT:Which approach is better: 1) to use a third-party ORM system or 2) manually write DAL and BLL code to work with the database? 1) In one of our projects, we decided using the DevExpress XPO ORM system, and we ran across lots of slight problems that wasted a lot of our time. Amd still from time to time we encounter problems and exceptions that come from this ORM, and we do not have full understanding and control of this "black box". 2) In another project, we decided to write the DAL and BLL from scratch. Although this implied writing boring code many, many times, but this approach proved to be more versatile and flexible: we had full control over the way data was held in the database, how it was obtained from it, etc. And all the bugs could be fixed in a direct and easy way. Which approach is generally better? Maybe the problem is just with the ORM that we used (DevExpress XPO), and maybe other ORMs are better (such as NHibernate)? Is it worth using ADO Entiry Framework? I found that the DotNetNuke CMS uses its own DAL and BLL code. What about other projects?

Is there any way to do this in a way that can be used in a datatemplate? EDIT: I've hooked up to the CollectionChanged event in my ItemsSource and tried to apply an animation manually.

@CONTENT:I have a small SQL Server database that I need to copy on command -- I need to be able to take the mfd and ldf files at any given moment, copy them, zip them, and make them available to an end user. Right now this is possible by manually: 1) Logging onto the SQL server via Remote Desktop 2) Detaching the database via SQL Management Studio. I have to fiddle around with a combination of setting the database to single_user and/or restarting the service so I can get it to detach since the app server is normally logged into it. 3) While detached I go through the file system and copy the mdf and ldf files. 4) I re-attach the database via SQL Management Studio 5) I zip the copied files, and I move them to an FTP server so the people who need them can get them. It's a horrible, inefficient process. It's not just a matter of needing the schema, but rather a need for people to work with snapshots of real, production data on their own local machines for the purpose of destructive experimentation. Luckily the zipped database is very small -- maybe 30 megs with the log. So ideally, I'd like to create a page in the ASP .NET web application that has a button the user can press to initiate the packaging of the current database into a zip file, and then I'd just provide the link to the file download.

I have another date range, specified in code, that defines the current week as 'week_start' and 'week_end'. I'd like to query all Events for the week. The cases seem to be: Event begins and ends within the week Event begins before the week, but ends within the week Event begins within the week, but ends after the week Event begins before the week and also ends after the week Events that neither reside within, nor overlap the week at all are ignored I'm attempting to come up with a query that can handle all these cases. So far I've only been able to get cases that handle the week overlaps, or events that are fully internal; Essentially, too many records, or none at all.

@TITLE:Python NTL - Identifying text interest / topic
@CONTENT:I am attempting to build a model that will attempt to identify the interest category / topic of supplied text. For example: "Enjoyed playing a game of football earlier." would resolve to a top level category like: "Sport". I'm not sure what the correct terminology is for what I am trying to achieve here so Google hasn't turned up any libraries that may be able to help. With that in mind, my approach would be something like: Extract features from text. Use tagging to classify each feature / identify names / places. Would probably use NTLK for this, or Topia. Run a Naive Bayes classifier for each interest category ("Sport", "Video Games", "Politics" etc.) and get a relevancy % for each category. Identify which category has the highest % accuracy and categorise the text. My approach would likely involve having individual corpora for each interest category and I'm sure the accuracy would be fairly miserable - I understand it will never be that accurate. Generally looking for some advice on the viability of what I am trying to accomplish, but the crux of my question: a) is my approach is correct? b) are there any libraries / resources that may be of assistance?

@LINK:/questions/17487356/hidden-markov-model-for-multiple-observed-variables
@TITLE:Hidden Markov Model for multiple observed variables
@CONTENT:I am trying to use a hidden Markov model (HMM) for a problem where I have M different observed variables (Yti) and a single hidden variable (Xt) at each time point, t. For clarity, let us assume all observed variables (Yti) are categorical, where each Yti conveys different information and as such may have different cardinalities. An illustrative example is given in the figure below, where M=3. My goal is to train the transition,emission and prior probabilities of an HMM, using the Baum-Welch algorithm, from my observed variable sequences (Yti). Let's say, Xt will initially have 2 hidden states. I have read a few tutorials (including the famous Rabiner paper) and went through the codes of a few HMM software packages, namely 'HMM Toolbox in MatLab' and 'hmmpytk package in Python'. Overall, I did an extensive web search and all the resources -that I could find- only cover the case, where there is only a single observed variable (M=1) at each time point. This increasingly makes me think HMM's are not suitable for situations with multiple observed variables. Is it possible to model the problem depicted in the figure as an HMM? If it is, how can one modify the Baum-Welch algorithm to cater for training the HMM parameters based on the multi-variable observation (emission) probabilities? If not, do you know of a methodology that is more suitable for the situation depicted in the figure? Thanks. Edit: In this paper, the situation depicted in the figure is described as a Dynamic Naive Bayes, which -in terms of the training and estimation algorithms- requires a slight extension to Baum-Welch and Viterbi algorithms for a single-variable HMM.

I like how the restful system breaks up requests, and how named routes encapsulate the URI's and decouple them from the function names. This worked in Laravel 3. Am I missing something in the syntax, or did Laravel 4 purposefully disallow this kind of mix-and-match behavior? Thanks...

@LINK:/questions/15892974/scrolling-over-large-canvas
@TITLE:Scrolling over large canvas
@CONTENT:I need some help understanding the fundamentals of scrolling over items that are drawn to a canvas in Android. Suppose I want to create a timeline where time at 0 is the top of a visualization and as time increased the timeline continues to be rendered below the previous point. If I wish to render this on Android I know I could simply create a bunch of items on a canvas by overriding onDraw(). However, let's suppose the visualization is bigger than the screen allows. For example in the first picture below the large black box contains the entire canvas as I render it. I create a blue line that runs vertically up and down as well as several yellow, green and blue rectangles. The red box represents the screen of the Android that is rendering the visualization. As it initially opens all items are drawn but only the items contained within the red box show up on the screen. Now if the user is to scroll down, items that initially appeared below the red box are in view while items that have gone out of the confines of the red box are no longer visable, as represented in the second picture. I believe I need to use scrollables but I'm quite lost how to do so. I've read over this page http://developer.android.com/training/custom-views/custom-drawing.html explaining how to create your own customer images and this page http://developer.android.com/training/custom-views/making-interactive.html explaining how to make the UI interactive, but I think I'm missing something. A sample code that illustrates this problem (this is basic, assume there is logic dictating WHERE the boxes/lines go, etc.) is as follows: package com.example.scrolltest;

import com.example.scrolltest.Draw;

import android.os.Bundle;
import android.app.Activity;
import android.graphics.Color;

public class MainActivity extends Activity {
    Draw draw;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

    draw = new Draw(this);
    draw.setBackgroundColor(Color.WHITE);
    setContentView(draw);
    }
}
 and package com.example.scrolltest;


import android.content.Context;
import android.graphics.Canvas;
import android.graphics.Color;
import android.graphics.Paint;
import android.view.View;


public class Draw extends View {
    Paint paint = new Paint();

    public Draw(Context context) {
        super(context);            
    }

    @Override
    public void onDraw(Canvas canvas) {

        paint.setColor(Color.GREEN);
        canvas.drawRect(30, 30, 90, 200, paint);
        paint.setColor(Color.BLUE);

        canvas.drawLine(100, 20, 100, 1900, paint);

        paint.setColor(Color.GREEN);
        canvas.drawRect(200, 2000, 400, 3000, paint);
        }
}
 What I cannot figure out though, is how I use a scrollable to scroll down to the rectangles that are off of the screen. I'm also unsure if I started this correctly or should use drawables instead...
@CODE:package com.example.scrolltest;

import com.example.scrolltest.Draw;

import android.os.Bundle;
import android.app.Activity;
import android.graphics.Color;

public class MainActivity extends Activity {
    Draw draw;

    @Override

        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

    draw = new Draw(this);
    draw.setBackgroundColor(Color.WHITE);
    setContentView(draw);
    }
} package com.example.scrolltest;


import android.content.Context;

How can I stop the number of VC's proliferating? The way the app works, the user does constantly return to the root VC - effectively a search screen.

src/test/java ........................ (java test classes)
src/test/resources ................... (some test .properties files) 
 (that is pretty standard maven project directory structure) So, and my question is: Should I put spring configuration files to resources directory or not ? I'm not sure if they can be considered as resource files. Most of the spring projects have configuration in WEB-INF/ directory. But there is one problem with unit testing, because when I need to load servlet configuration then is maven expecting configuration files in /test/resources directory. I know, that I can copy context xml file to the tested class and everything will be ok, but that not look so good for me. I was reading a lot of articles on the internet, but I'm still not sure what is the right way. So I have tree options: 1. stay with current structure 2. move all spring configuration to the /main/(java|test)/resources Here I can see one bad thing. All configuration files will be in classes directory and I'm not sure if this is right. 3. move only servlet config to the /main/(java|test)/resources and keep other spring configuration files in /WEB-INF/ directory. So, what do you recommend ? What is the best practices for configuration files placement when using Spring with Maven and JUnit ? UPDATE: fixed directory naming in option 2. and 3. UPDATE: I found very interesting reading [1] about best practices in Spring. It looks very promising and confirming Ralph's solution. I'm still not happy about presence META-INF directory in WEB-INF/classes but, well ... nothing is perfect.

@CONTENT:so I have a couple of ssh keys that are used for other accounts that I have. I now need to be able to clone a heroku repository on my computer. I created a new ssh key and used heroku keys:add to add it to my heroku account. However when I try and clone the repository I get this error: Your key with fingerprint: .... is not authorized to access rural-visions. fatal: the remote end hung up unexpectedly I've heard that I need to create a config file in the .ssh folder, but I don't know what to put into there.

@TITLE:JmDNS doesn't work properly on android 4.1
@CONTENT:JmDNS I am implementing JmDNS as follows here. When running the code on my android 2.3.5 htc Evo I am able to discover my linux computer. However, when i run the same code on my samsung galaxy s3 (4.1.0) nothing shows up. What is strange is that it was working on my 4.1 a week ago and now it isn't. I have tried someone else's solution here but no luck. If any one has experienced this and could shed some light on why gingerbread is working with jmdns but not jellybean. Clarification: My android 4.1 device will not resolve any services except for those that are created from the device. My 2.3 device will resolve services except those created from the 4.1 device. could it be ip6 to ip4?

@TITLE:Python Code: Geometric Brownian Motion - what's wrong?
@CONTENT:I'm pretty new to Python, but for a paper in University I need to apply some models, using preferably Python. I spent a couple of days with the code I attached, but I can't really help, what's wrong, it's not creating a random process which looks like standard brownian motions with drift. My parameters like mu and sigma (expected return or drift and volatility) tend to change nothing but the slope of the noise process. That's my problem, it all looks like noise.

@LINK:/questions/12692577/core-data-saving-objects-in-background-issue
@TITLE:Core Data saving objects in background issue
@CONTENT:What I'm trying todo in a nutshell is I am using a background queue to save JSON objects pulled from a web service to the Core Data Sqlite3 database. The saving takes place on a serialized background queue I've created via GCD, and saved to a secondary instance of NSManagedObjectContext that is created for that background queue. Once the save is complete I need to update the instance of NSManagedObjectContext that is on the main thread with the newly created/updated objects. The problem I am having though is the instance of NSManagedObjectContext on the main thread is not able to find the objects that were saved on the background context. Below is a list of actions I'm taking with code samples. Any thoughts on what I'm doing wrong? Create a background queue via GCD, run all pre-processing logic and then save the background context on that thread. // process in the background queue dispatch_async(backgroundQueue, ^(void){ if (savedObjectIDs.count > 0) {
    [savedObjectIDs removeAllObjects];
}
if (savedObjectClass) {
    savedObjectClass = nil;
}

// set the thead name
NSThread *currentThread = [NSThread currentThread];
[currentThread setName:VS_CORE_DATA_MANAGER_BACKGROUND_THREAD_NAME];

// if there is not already a background context, then create one
if (!_backgroundQueueManagedObjectContext) {
    NSPersistentStoreCoordinator *coordinator = [self persistentStoreCoordinator];
    if (coordinator != nil) {
        _backgroundQueueManagedObjectContext = [[NSManagedObjectContext alloc] init];
        [_backgroundQueueManagedObjectContext setPersistentStoreCoordinator:coordinator];
    }
}

// save the JSON dictionary starting at the upper most level of the key path, and return all created/updated objects in an array
NSArray *objectIds = [self saveJSON:jsonDict objectMapping:objectMapping class:managedObjectClass managedObjectContext:_backgroundQueueManagedObjectContext level:0];

// save the object IDs and the completion block to global variables so we can access them after the save
if (objectIds) {
    [savedObjectIDs addObjectsFromArray:objectIds];
}
if (completion) {
    saveCompletionBlock = completion;
}
if (managedObjectClass) {
    savedObjectClass = managedObjectClass;
}

// save all changes object context
[self saveManagedObjectContext];
 }); The "saveManagedObjectContext" method basically looks at which thread is running and saves the appropriate context. I have verified that this method is working correctly so I will not place the code here. All of this code resides in a singleton, and in the singleton's init method I am adding a listener for the "NSManagedObjectContextDidSaveNotification" and it calls the mergeChangesFromContextDidSaveNotification: method // merge changes from the context did save notification to the main context (void)mergeChangesFromContextDidSaveNotification:(NSNotification *)notification { NSThread *currentThread = [NSThread currentThread]; if ([currentThread.name isEqual:VS_CORE_DATA_MANAGER_BACKGROUND_THREAD_NAME]) { // merge changes to the primary context, and wait for the action to complete on the main thread
[_managedObjectContext performSelectorOnMainThread:@selector(mergeChangesFromContextDidSaveNotification:) withObject:notification waitUntilDone:YES];

// on the main thread fetch all new data and call the completion block
dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{

    // get objects from the database
    NSMutableArray *objects = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];
    for (id objectID in savedObjectIDs) {
        NSError *error;
        id object = [_managedObjectContext existingObjectWithID:objectID error:&error];
        if (error) {
            [self logError:error];
        } else if (object) {
            [objects addObject:object];
        }
    }

    // remove all saved object IDs from the array
    [savedObjectIDs removeAllObjects];
    savedObjectClass = nil;

    // call the completion block
    //completion(objects);
    saveCompletionBlock(objects);

    // clear the saved completion block
    saveCompletionBlock = nil;
});
 } } As you can see in the method above I am calling the "mergeChangesFromContextDidSaveNotification:" on the main thread, and I have set the action to wait until done. According to the apple documentation the background thread should wait until that action is complete before it continues with the rest of the code below that call. As I mentioned above once I run this code everything seems to work, but when I try to print out the fetched objects to the console I don't get anything back. It seems that the merge is not in fact taking place, or possibly not finishing before the rest of my code runs. Is there another notification that I should be listening for to ensure that the merge has completed? Or do I need to save the main object context after the merge, but before the fecth? Also, I apologize for the bad code formatting, but it seems that SO's code tags don't like method definitions. Thanks guys! UPDATE: I've made the changes that were recommended below, but still having the same problem. Below is the updated code I have. This is the code that invokes the background thread saving processes // process in the background queue
dispatch_async(backgroundQueue, ^(void){

    if (savedObjectIDs.count > 0) {
        [savedObjectIDs removeAllObjects];
    }
    if (savedObjectClass) {
        savedObjectClass = nil;
    }

    // set the thead name
    NSThread *currentThread = [NSThread currentThread];
    [currentThread setName:VS_CORE_DATA_MANAGER_BACKGROUND_THREAD_NAME];

    // if there is not already a background context, then create one
    if (!_backgroundQueueManagedObjectContext) {
        NSPersistentStoreCoordinator *coordinator = [self persistentStoreCoordinator];
        if (coordinator != nil) {
            _backgroundQueueManagedObjectContext = [[NSManagedObjectContext alloc] init];
            [_backgroundQueueManagedObjectContext setPersistentStoreCoordinator:coordinator];
        }
    }

    // save the JSON dictionary starting at the upper most level of the key path
    NSArray *objectIds = [self saveJSON:jsonDict objectMapping:objectMapping class:managedObjectClass managedObjectContext:_backgroundQueueManagedObjectContext level:0];

    // save the object IDs and the completion block to global variables so we can access them after the save
    if (objectIds) {
        [savedObjectIDs addObjectsFromArray:objectIds];
    }
    if (completion) {
        saveCompletionBlock = completion;
    }
    if (managedObjectClass) {
        savedObjectClass = managedObjectClass;
    }

    // listen for the merge changes from context did save notification
    [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(mergeChangesFromBackground:) name:NSManagedObjectContextDidSaveNotification object:_backgroundQueueManagedObjectContext];

    // save all changes object context
    [self saveManagedObjectContext];
});
 This is the code that is called with by the NSManagedObjectContextDidSaveNotification notification     // merge changes from the context did save notification to the main context
- (void)mergeChangesFromBackground:(NSNotification *)notification
{
    // kill the listener
    [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] removeObserver:self name:NSManagedObjectContextDidSaveNotification object:_backgroundQueueManagedObjectContext];

    NSThread *currentThread = [NSThread currentThread];

    // merge changes to the primary context, and wait for the action to complete on the main thread
    [[self managedObjectContext] performSelectorOnMainThread:@selector(mergeChangesFromContextDidSaveNotification:) withObject:notification waitUntilDone:YES];

    // dispatch the completion block
    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{

        // get objects from the database
        NSMutableArray *objects = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];
        for (id objectID in savedObjectIDs) {
            NSError *error;
            id object = [[self managedObjectContext] existingObjectWithID:objectID error:&error];
            if (error) {
                [self logError:error];
            } else if (object) {
                [objects addObject:object];
            }
        }

        // remove all saved object IDs from the array
        [savedObjectIDs removeAllObjects];
        savedObjectClass = nil;

        // call the completion block
        //completion(objects);
        saveCompletionBlock(objects);

        // clear the saved completion block
        saveCompletionBlock = nil;
    });
}
 UPDATE: So I found the solution. Turns out that the way I was saving out the object IDs on the background thread and then trying to use them on the main thread to re-fetch them wasn't working out. So I ended up pulling the inserted/updated objects from the userInfo dictionary that is sent with the NSManagedObjectContextDidSaveNotification notification. Below is my updated code that is now working. As before this code starts the pre-prossesing and saving logic // process in the background queue
dispatch_async(backgroundQueue, ^(void){

    // set the thead name
    NSThread *currentThread = [NSThread currentThread];
    [currentThread setName:VS_CORE_DATA_MANAGER_BACKGROUND_THREAD_NAME];

    [self logMessage:[NSString stringWithFormat:@"(%@) saveJSONObjects:objectMapping:class:completion:", [managedObjectClass description]]];

    // if there is not already a background context, then create one
    if (!_backgroundQueueManagedObjectContext) {
        NSPersistentStoreCoordinator *coordinator = [self persistentStoreCoordinator];
        if (coordinator != nil) {
            _backgroundQueueManagedObjectContext = [[NSManagedObjectContext alloc] init];
            [_backgroundQueueManagedObjectContext setPersistentStoreCoordinator:coordinator];
        }
    }

    // save the JSON dictionary starting at the upper most level of the key path
    [self saveJSON:jsonDict objectMapping:objectMapping class:managedObjectClass managedObjectContext:_backgroundQueueManagedObjectContext level:0];

    // save the object IDs and the completion block to global variables so we can access them after the save
    if (completion) {
        saveCompletionBlock = completion;
    }

    // listen for the merge changes from context did save notification
    [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(mergeChangesFromBackground:) name:NSManagedObjectContextDidSaveNotification object:_backgroundQueueManagedObjectContext];

    // save all changes object context
    [self saveManagedObjectContext];
});
 This is the modified method that handles the NSManagedObjectContextDidSaveNotification - (void)mergeChangesFromBackground:(NSNotification *)notification
{
    // kill the listener
    [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] removeObserver:self name:NSManagedObjectContextDidSaveNotification object:_backgroundQueueManagedObjectContext];

    // merge changes to the primary context, and wait for the action to complete on the main thread
    [[self managedObjectContext] performSelectorOnMainThread:@selector(mergeChangesFromContextDidSaveNotification:) withObject:notification waitUntilDone:YES];

    // dispatch the completion block
    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{

        // pull the objects that were saved from the notification so we can get them on the main thread MOC
        NSDictionary *userInfo = [notification userInfo];
        NSMutableArray *modifiedObjects = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];
        NSSet *insertedObject = (NSSet *)[userInfo objectForKey:@"inserted"];
        NSSet *updatedObject = (NSSet *)[userInfo objectForKey:@"updated"];

        if (insertedObject && insertedObject.count > 0) {
            [modifiedObjects addObjectsFromArray:[insertedObject allObjects]];
        }
        if (updatedObject && updatedObject.count > 0) {
            [modifiedObjects addObjectsFromArray:[updatedObject allObjects]];
        }

        NSMutableArray *objects = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];

        // iterate through the updated objects and find them in the main thread MOC
        for (NSManagedObject *object in modifiedObjects) {
            NSError *error;
            NSManagedObject *obj = [[self managedObjectContext] existingObjectWithID:object.objectID error:&error];
            if (error) {
                [self logError:error];

@TITLE:blocks, self, retain cycles
@CONTENT:I'm having a bit of trouble getting my head around referencing self within a block, and not creating a retain cycle. Can you let me know if my understanding is correct: If I ever reference self within a block, it will create a retain cycle, and instead I should be creating a weak reference to self outside of the block and then using that weak reference inside the block? Thanks!

@TITLE:Load WPF UI into MVVM application from plug-in assembly
@CONTENT:I am working on an application that uses a plug-in architecture to expand it's functionality. What is the best way to load WPF UIs from a plug-in? I will have a listbox listing all of the available plug-ins. When a plug-in is selected, a WPF UI defined in the plug-in should be displayed in a ContentControl. The options I have thought of include: Require a UserControl to be created that implements a specific interface. I am thinking this would make it easy for plug-in creation. Implement an interface and you are good to go. My question with this method is how to dynamically load the UserControl into a ContentControl. Also, since I am using the MVVM design pattern it seems that a DataTemplate would be preferred over a UserControl. Allow a DataTemplate to be loaded from the plug-in. I believe this would require the plug-in to contain a XAML file named a certain way. My application would read the DataTemplate into my resource dictionary like shown in this question. I have seen quite a few questions similar to this, except they usually only need to load one additional, predefined assembly to get DataTemplates from. This problem would require any number of unknown assemblies to be searched for DataTemplates. If I choose the second option, I think I could select the DataTemplate similarly to how this answer describes. Which method do you think is better? Or do you have a better way to accomplish this?

@TITLE:GCM with custom broadcastreceiver
@CONTENT:I am implementing gcm notifications in my application. Because I use my code to generate lot of application with different package names I cannot use standard mypackage.GCMIntentService name. When generating applications I do changes only in Manifest and change imports of my R class. So I impelented my own BroadcastReceiver public class GCMReceiver extends GCMBroadcastReceiver {
  @Override
  protected String getGCMIntentServiceClassName(Context context) {
    return GCMIntentService.class.getName();
  }
}
 to return name of GCMIntentService regardless of package name. Here is my manifest:     <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.GET_ACCOUNTS" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WAKE_LOCK" />

 Everything works fine, I can register, unregister, receive messages. But when application is not runnig no GCMIntentService.onMessage is not called. Am I missing something in my manifest? Why system did not start service?

@LINK:/questions/11924711/how-to-make-iscroll-and-lazy-load-jquery-plugins-work-together
@TITLE:How to make Iscroll and Lazy Load jQuery plugins work together?
@CONTENT:Is there any chance of getting this two plugins to work together? Right now if I use iscroll in a div with images, Lazy load won't detect when the images should be visible. Thanks. EDIT: As said in one of the comments, I have tried to apply lazyload on scroll like this: onScrollMove: function () {
    $("img").lazyload();
    $('img').on('load',function(){myScroll.refresh();});
}
 To work correctly I guess I would have to apply the same to onBeforeScrollEnd: onBeforeScrollEnd: function () {
    $("img").lazyload();
    $('img').on('load',function(){myScroll.refresh();});
}
 But is this solution affecting performance (as it is continuosly applying lazyload to all images and refreshing when they are loaded to readapt to the loaded image width/height)? I am really concerned about performance here as I will have a container scroller with several (let's say 30) scrollers inside all of theme with images. What else can I do? EDIT 2: This is what I have so far that I think works almost good: onScrollMove: function() {
    $('#my_container img').lazyload({
        container: $('#my_container'),
        threshold: 200
    }).on('load', function() {
        myScroll.refresh();
    });?
}
 But the problem with this solution is that when myScroll refreshes the first time, lazyload loads all the images.. Here is a fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/U3gYS/ and it also has the problem that if the first image is viewable from the beggining, lazyload won't load that image. http://jsfiddle.net/U3gYS/1/ EDIT 3: http://jsfiddle.net/pdakD/ I almost have it, please some help. In the new fiddle, the problems are: onBeforeScrollEnd doesn't seem to work. If I include in it a console.log('something'), it looks to me as it is firing when the scroll Starts. The initial #container has a height which is the span+first img. To make it look better, I added a padding-bottom (not too big) and remove it when the last image has finally loaded...What else can I do? EDIT 4: This looks better: http://jsfiddle.net/pdakD/1/ .onBeforeScrollEnd stills looks bad to me. I also have this option: http://jsfiddle.net/pdakD/1/ which applies checkDOMChanges:true
 But as I have multiple iscrollers and ajax data, etc, I don't think is a good idea. SOLUTION: Here is the jfiddle of the solution proposed by Michael Alexander Freund. http://jsfiddle.net/pdakD/11/ It works but gets stuck in the bottom if you "scroll" fast.
@CODE:onScrollMove: function () {
    $("img").lazyload();
    $('img').on('load',function(){myScroll.refresh();});
} onBeforeScrollEnd: function () {
    $("img").lazyload();
    $('img').on('load',function(){myScroll.refresh();});
} onScrollMove: function() {
    $('#my_container img').lazyload({
        container: $('#my_container'),
        threshold: 200
    }).on('load', function() {
        myScroll.refresh();
    });?
} checkDOMChanges:true

@TITLE:Download SQLite database from Internet and load into Android application
@CONTENT:For my android application, I would like to use a large database (about 45 MB). One solution would be to include the (splitted) database in the assets folder and copy it to the database directory on the first startup. But this would consume disk space twice - one time in the assets folder where the file can't be deleted and one time in the database directory where it has been copied to. So I would rather like to download the database from the Internet (webserver) on the first startup. How could I do this? Can I download a complete SQLite file and save it to the database directory? Or should I rather go with JSON data files that are used to populate the database?

@TITLE:Mongoose embedded documents / DocumentsArrays id
@CONTENT:In the Mongoose documentation at the following address: http://mongoosejs.com/docs/embedded-documents.html There is a statement: DocumentArrays have an special method id that filters your embedded documents by their _id property (each embedded document gets one): Consider the following snippet:  post.comments.id(my_id).remove();
  post.save(function (err) {
    // embedded comment with id `my_id` removed!
  });
 I've looked at the data and there are no *_id*s for the embedded documents as would appear to be confirmed by this post: How to return the last push() embedded document My question is: Is the documentation correct? If so then how do I find out what 'my_id' is (in the example) to do a *'.id(my_id)'* in the first place? If the documentation is incorrect is it safe to use the index as an id within the document array or should I generate a unique Id manually (as per the mentioned post).

In the documentation, I read "Outlets should generally be weak, except for those from File¡¦s Owner to top-level objects in a nib file (or, in iOS, a storyboard scene) which should be strong." Examples? I don't understand when it's better use "weak" instead of "strong" property for an IBOutlet.

@TITLE:Internationalization in JSF 2.0
@CONTENT:I'm wondering how internationalization works in jsf? I have read tutorial on coreservlets.com about it, but in my case it works slightly differently. In that tutorial said that i have to use FacesContext.getCurrentInstance().getViewRoot().setLocale(newLocale);
 in actionListener(listener for changing locale) and also backing bean has to have property getCurrentLocale() to use it in <f:view> tag. I have 2 property files with messages(default and with specified locale), they are registered in faces-config.xml. <f:view> tag I have only at one page(index.xhtml) <f:view locale="#{bean.locale}">
...
</f:view>
 Also I have 2 buttons(with actionListener) for each locale. In backing bean I simply modify current locale variable(don't use getViewRoot().setLocale(newLocale)). But locale changes for all pages(even if they don't have <f:view locale="#{bean.locale}">)
@CODE:FacesContext.getCurrentInstance().getViewRoot().setLocale(newLocale); getCurrentLocale() <f:view> faces-config.xml <f:view> <f:view locale="#{bean.locale}">

@TITLE:Rails 3 - Best way to handle nested resource queries in your controllers?
@CONTENT:If there's one thing I've learned about Rails 3 is if I'm having a hard time doing something, I'm probably doing it wrong. So I'm looking for help. I have a few models which are related in a many to many relationship. I am able to create the associations in the models without a problem. My problem lies in how to build the controllers to work with these relationships. I'll try and give an example if you don't see where I'm going with this. For instance... class Account < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :locations
end

class Contact < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :locations
end

class Location < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_and_belongs_to_many :accounts
    has_and_belongs_to_many :contacts
end
 Let's say I have the above models. This would be my resources... resources :accounts do
    resources :locations
end

resources :contacts do
    resources :locations
end

resources :locations do
    resources :accounts
    resources :contacts
end
 So just to keep this shortened a bit, let's say I want a list of all locations for an account. The above routes would presumably be account/1/locations. Thus landing me at locations#index. Hopefully I haven't screwed up my example at this point but what's the best way to build this action out as it really has multiple jobs... at a minimum the locations for an account, contact, and all locations. So I end up with something like this... class LocationController < ApplicationController

 Update #1: To clarify, as I am getting some answers that suggest I change my Model relationships. I am working with a legacy system in which I can NOT change the relationships at this point. It is ultimately my goal to clean up the database and the relationships but for now I can not. So I need to find a solution that works with this configuration.
@CODE:class Account < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :locations
end

class Contact < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :locations
end

class Location < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_and_belongs_to_many :accounts
    has_and_belongs_to_many :contacts
end resources :accounts do
    resources :locations
end

resources :contacts do
    resources :locations
end

resources :locations do
    resources :accounts
    resources :contacts
end class LocationController < ApplicationController
    def index
        if params[:account_id]
            @locations = Location.find_all_by_account_id(params[:account_id])
        elsif params[:contact_id]
            @locations = Location.find_all_by_contact_id(params[:account_id])
        else
            @locations = Location.all
        end

@CONTENT:Using an available WiFi IP (i.e. 192.xxx.x.x, using post 8080), I'd like to create a http server in android that can connect and can be accessed by a desktop so that I can transfer files to the android device. Update: I'm currently trying out NanoHTTPD but I can't seem to make the sample HelloWorld run on android device.. I changed the hello world code and made it extend activity instead and created an object nanohttpd. I modified up to specifying what port to be used but upon further debugging, I found out that the server socket has no getInetAddress at all. I thought NanoHTTPD no longer needs further config...?

@LINK:/questions/6311643/jsf-active-sessions-counter-how-to
@TITLE:JSF Active Sessions counter. How to?
@CONTENT:Good evening, In a test JSF 2.0 web app, I am trying to get the number of active sessions but there is a problem in the sessionDestroyed method of the HttpSessionListener. Indeed, when a user logs in, the number of active session increases by 1, but when a user logs off, the same number remains as it is (no desincrementation happens) and the worse is that, when the same user logs in again (even though he unvalidated the session), the same number is incremented. To put that in different words : 1- I log in, the active sessions number is incremented by 1. 2- I Logout (the session gets unvalidated) 3- I login again, the sessions number is incremented by 1. The display is = 2. 4- I repeat the operation, and the sessions number keeps being incremented, while there is only one user logged in. So I thought that method sessionDestroyed is not properly called, or maybe effectively called after the session timeout which is a parameter in WEB.XML (mine is 60 minutes). That is weird as this is a Session Listener and there is nothing wrong with my Class. Does someone please have a clue? package mybeans;

@TITLE:Synchronization in multiplayer networked game?
@CONTENT:Recently I have been working on a multiplayer networking app. I had successfully implemented the client server model using Bonjour services and NSStream objects. The two way communication has been done successfully. The problem I'm facing is: the two devices running the app are connected via local wifi. There is a latency problem while sending the messages from client to server and vice versa. Describing in brief: It's a car racing game with at most two players. One server and other client. When client press the buttons a particular message is sent to the server telling which key or button was pressed. Then the server responds accordingly and make changes on the client's car on the server itself. These changes are not always the same. There is always a difference between the actual location of the car on the client's screen and that in the server screen. Any ideas?

@TITLE:How to make a UITableViewCell with different subviews reusable?
@CONTENT:I have a UITableView in which I display, naturally, UITableViewCells which are all of the same class, let's call it MyCell. So I have one MyCell.xib, one MyCell.h and one MyCell.m. Unfortunately, this cells do contain one subview, which holds varying content, e.g. a train subview and a car subview. So if the UITableView is in need of a new cell, it's always a MyCell but sometimes it contains a train subview and sometimes a car subview. Now, here is my problem: How to make MyCell properly reusable? The cell itself is reusable as intended (In the .xib I defined it's identifier) but it's subview has to be created again and again for every cell. My first idea was to change the identifier of MyCell depending on it's content but unfortunately, reuseIdentifier can't be changed on runtime. I could, however, implement my own - (NSString *) reuseIdentifier {} which I guess would work, though I wouldn't consider it great style. Is there a better way to do this? Many thanks in advance! EDIT: I realize I need to add that the subviews are stored in their own classes/xibs to keep their code seperated.

@LINK:/questions/5216459/how-can-i-cancel-a-uiscrollview-zoom-bounce
@TITLE:How can I cancel a UIScrollView zoom bounce?
@CONTENT:I'm using a zooming UIScrollView to show images in my iPad app. The zooming works great, with a pinch making an image smaller or bigger as appropriate. I also have bouncesZoom enabled so that it bounces back to the minimum or maximum zoom if the user stretches it too far one way or the other. Now I'd like to recognize when a pinch has ended with the image 10% smaller than the minimum zoom size and, in such a case, prevent the bounce from happening and trigger a different animation that shrinks the image to "close" it. This way, there can be a sort of "pinch to close" gesture. What I've come up with to do this, at its simplest, is this: - (void)scrollViewDidZoom:(UIScrollView *)scrollView {
    if (self.zoomBouncing && zoomedToScale / self.minimumZoomScale < 0.90) {
        // We've let go and were under 90% of the minimum size.
        self.minimumZoomScale = zoomedToScale;
        [self shrinkImageToNothing];
    } else {
        // How far have we gone?
        zoomedToScale = self.zoomScale;
    }
}
 This works great, except that at this point it's already bouncing, so the setting of minimumZoomScale does nothing. Therefore, the bounce and shrink occur at the same time, which as you might imagine looks pretty weird. So my question is: How can I prevent the bounce from happening only in this specific situation? There is no UIScrollViewDelegate method that allows my code to do something between when the gesture finishes and when the UIScrollView decides to bounce back. I've tried a bunch of other techniques with no luck, including: Returning nil from ¡VviewForZoomingInScrollView: when my 90% zoom threshold has been passed. Doesn't work because this method is called when the gesture begins, not for every point of the zoom. Setting bouncesZoom in -scrollViewDidZoom: to false when the zoom factor is less than 90% and to true when it's greater than or equal to 90%. Makes the image shake badly when the scale gets under 90% because it disallows that size when the bouncesZoom is false. Adding a -touchesEnded:withEvent method. It never gets called. Adding my own UIPinchGestureRecognizer to execute concurrently with the UIScrollView's own pinch recognizer. Doesn't work because its handlers (and delegate methods) are called after UIScrollView's pinch gesture, which makes the decision to bounce before my gesture can tell it not too. I tried removing all the core gestures, adding mine, and adding the core gestures back. But my gesture was still called after UIScrollView had decided it was bouncing. So I'm at a bit of a loss. Anyone else tried to do something like this?
@CODE:bouncesZoom - (void)scrollViewDidZoom:(UIScrollView *)scrollView {
    if (self.zoomBouncing && zoomedToScale / self.minimumZoomScale < 0.90) {
        // We've let go and were under 90% of the minimum size.
        self.minimumZoomScale = zoomedToScale;
        [self shrinkImageToNothing];
    } else {
        // How far have we gone?
        zoomedToScale = self.zoomScale;
    }
} minimumZoomScale nil ¡VviewForZoomingInScrollView: bouncesZoom -scrollViewDidZoom: bouncesZoom -touchesEnded:withEvent

@CONTENT:On iOS 4.2 when I use UIImagePickerController to let the user select a image from the photo library these are the dictionary keys that are returned to me: 2011-03-02 13:15:59.518 xxx[15098:307] didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo:

}
 Using one or more of these keys, how can I get a JPEG representation that would include the image metadata (such as exposure information and GPS location data) such that I can upload that somewhere and have the metadata included (not stripped off)? I see from Warren Burton's very nice answer in Display image from URL retrieved from ALAsset in iPhone? how to use the UIImagePickerControllerReferenceURL and the ALAssetsLibrary assetForURL method to get to the ALAsset and the ALAssetRepresentation. But what do I do then to get to the JPEG that includes in it all the metadata? Or is there a mechanism through the UIImage? The bottom line here is that I want to get JPEG with the metadata included in it...

@TITLE:Localizing validation messages at client side by jQuery in ASP.net MVC
@CONTENT:I am using jquery for client side validation together with data annotations. Everything is working fine but I would like to localize a message when a non numeric value is entered in numeric textbox. For server side validation it can be done by setting DefaultModelBinder.ResourceClassKey to resource class name and providing value for PropertyValueInvalid key. However for client side validation asp.net mvc is using it's own resource file with key 'ClientDataTypeModelValidatorProvider_FieldMustBeNumeric'. The only way to solve it that I found is described at Custom Server and Client Side Required Validator in MVC 2 using jQuery.validate. The solution does work but I was wondering if there is an easier or more correct way to do it. Thanks.

@TITLE:How to clear / reset an ItemizedOverlay in Android?
@CONTENT:I have a program that is creating an ItemizedOverlay and a map. Everything works fine upon startup. When you close ande re-open the app, I am using onRestart() to get updated information from my server and update the map. The problem is that at this point, the ItemizedOverlay still contains the old items, and then proceeds to add the new data to the existing data. I am looking for a way to clear out the ItemizedOverlay. There does not appear to be an ItemizedOveraly.clear, or any similar function. Ideas about how I can do this / why is it not obvious ?

@TITLE:Android GPS Status driving me nuts
@CONTENT:I am making a application that uses the GPS receiver. The application will work on all versions starting from 1.6. I have a satellite Icon in which I tell the users the current status: if icon is red - gps disabled if icon is orange - gps is enabled and trying to fix on the satellites if icon is green - gps is fixed and running fine. After reading around here, I've found that some events for onLocationChanged trigger on 1.6 version but not later, so taking the advice I implemented a GPS listener. I have some really weird behavior as the status of the icon gets messed out. For instance I enable GPS and gets orange... after a fix get's green.. after a few seconds gets read after a second orange and so on... Here is the code I use.

@TITLE:How to build a generic repository
@CONTENT:I'm developing a web application in ASP.NET MVC with NHibernate. Based in articles and tutorials I've found at Google, I'm using Repository for my classes. I have 10 classes and 10 repositories. Today I figured out that 90% of mine repositories are exactly equal each other, except for the class. This is one example: public class PromocaoRepository:IPromocaoRepository {
    private ISession Session;

    public PromocaoRepository() {
        this.Session = NHibernateSessionFactory.OpenSession();
    }

    public void Add(Promocao promocao) {
        using(ITransaction transaction = this.Session.BeginTransaction()) {
            this.Session.Save(promocao);
            transaction.Commit();
        }
    }

    public void Edit(Promocao promocao) {
        using(ITransaction transaction = this.Session.BeginTransaction()) {
            this.Session.Update(promocao);
            transaction.Commit();
        }
    }

    public void Remove(Promocao promocao) {
        using(ITransaction transaction = this.Session.BeginTransaction()) {
            this.Session.Delete(promocao);
            transaction.Commit();
        }
    }

    public Promocao GetById(int id) {
        return this.Session.Get<Promocao>(id);
    }

}
 There is a way to do a kind of generic repository witch I can use in all my classes? If it's possible, what should I do in case I need to create a particular method for an specific class?
@CODE:public class PromocaoRepository:IPromocaoRepository {
    private ISession Session;

    public PromocaoRepository() {

            transaction.Commit();
        }
    }

    public void Edit(Promocao promocao) {
        using(ITransaction transaction = this.Session.BeginTransaction()) {
            this.Session.Update(promocao);
            transaction.Commit();

@TITLE:How can I improve core data fetch performance on the iPhone?
@CONTENT:Core data's performance on the iPhone is absolutely miserable. Is indexing completely broken or is it just a poor implementation? I have about 21500 objects of a single type in my core data store (SQLite backing store). The objects are indexed on a UUID which is an NSString (for example, one looks like this: "6b09e200-07b6-11df-a245-002500a30d78"). A single fetch where the object exists using executeFetchRequest in NSManagedObjectContext takes about 0.75 seconds! This is with the simplest possible predicate of "uuid == $UUID" where $UUID is a string like the example above. This is really surprising. If I wanted to fetch every object in my store, one by one, it would take nearly 4.5 hours! Is there anyway to improve this performance or should I just abandon core data all together?

Edit: To clarify, I'd like all of this functionality to be embedded in a single non-webapp non-website project. That is, the project is made up of three parts: the command-line interface, the optionally-run web interface (the HTTP server), and the core that waits for and reacts to requests by either of those two interfaces.

@CONTENT:I am wondering if there is a good-performing query to select distinct dates (ignoring times) from a table with a datetime field in SQL Server. My problem isn't getting the server to actually do this (I've seen this question already, and we had something similar already in place using DISTINCT). The problem is whether there is any trick to get it done more quickly. With the data we are using, our current query is returning ~80 distinct days for which there are ~40,000 rows of data (after filtering on another indexed column), there is an index on the date column, and the query always manages to take 5+ seconds. Which is too slow. Changing the database structure might be an option, but a less desirable one.

@CONTENT:Core data's performance on the iPhone is absolutely miserable. Is indexing completely broken or is it just a poor implementation? I have about 21500 objects of a single type in my core data store (SQLite backing store). The objects are indexed on a UUID which is an NSString (for example, one looks like this: "6b09e200-07b6-11df-a245-002500a30d78"). A single fetch where the object exists using executeFetchRequest in NSManagedObjectContext takes about 0.75 seconds! This is with the simplest possible predicate of "uuid == $UUID" where $UUID is a string like the example above. This is really surprising. If I wanted to fetch every object in my store, one by one, it would take nearly 4.5 hours! Is there anyway to improve this performance or should I just abandon core data all together?

@CONTENT:I'm trying to use Phing to automate : running tests running DB migrations on each Developer machine [using dbdeply] deployment to production when needed I think it does make sense to add a build folder in my project and put all my build configuration files and db deltas in that folder. and commit all that into the SVN repository. so every developer will get the updated build files when he check-out from svn. and be able to run the build to update his DB with the new changes. on the production server: I was planning to add another build file there to get the latest Tagged version in svn and perform CSS & JS compression. I was planning to implement continues integration using PHPUnderControl too, so I can keep track of the result of each build and get notified whenever the build fails. so, do you think this all does make sense, or you do have other better suggestions?

@TITLE:Automatic Login with Rails?
@CONTENT:I am trying to get up a simple authentication system with Rails' Restful-Authentication plugin, and am just wondering how it works, b/c I can't seem to figure out what the requirements are for cookies, and how to make it so the browser always remembers you (for 6+ months). Few questions: 1) How do you do remember_me's for ruby's restful_authentication? I can't seem to find a good one-liner to solve this problem... If a user signs up and checks "Remember Me", how does the rails application get the session/cookie without the user doing anything but going to the page the next time they go to the page, say 3 months later? 2) Do I need to send some sort of info to the server, like their IP address or something? What is cookies[:auth_token], where is that defined? The goal is: I don't want them to have to enter their email/password again, like how StackOverflow works :)

@TITLE:Programmatically starting an HTTP server in C#?
@CONTENT:I'm a C#, ASP.NET newbie. Let's say I have an existing C# project (from a "Console Application" template; I work with Visual Studio). I want to be able to start a simple HTTP server and serve .aspx pages (or ordinary text even, in which case I'm also looking for a nice templating library ^^), but only if a certain command is given to the program via the command-line interface. (So, the server is not up by default.) How could I best accomplish this? Thank you very much for any help! Edit: To clarify, I'd like all of this functionality to be embedded in a single non-webapp non-website project. That is, the project is made up of three parts: the command-line interface, the optionally-run web interface (the HTTP server), and the core that waits for and reacts to requests by either of those two interfaces. This is the current state of the existing project, sans the web-interface.

@TITLE:How to quickly select DISTINCT dates from a Date/Time field, SQL Server
@CONTENT:I am wondering if there is a good-performing query to select distinct dates (ignoring times) from a table with a datetime field in SQL Server. My problem isn't getting the server to actually do this (I've seen this question already, and we had something similar already in place using DISTINCT). The problem is whether there is any trick to get it done more quickly. With the data we are using, our current query is returning ~80 distinct days for which there are ~40,000 rows of data (after filtering on another indexed column), there is an index on the date column, and the query always manages to take 5+ seconds. Which is too slow. Changing the database structure might be an option, but a less desirable one.

@CONTENT:We've just set up a new remote access solution using Microsoft's TS Gateway, which requires a couple of somewhat fiddly steps on the end users behalf in order to get it working (installing our root ca cert, requirement of RDP 6.1 client etc). In order to make this setup process as easy as possible (a lot of these users aren't technically minded), I'm looking to create a program to perform all these tasks automatically. I have most of it working, however I'm not entirely sure how to go about importing the Root CA cert into the Windows certificate store. Because this can potentially be run on a wide range of computers with varying levels of patches and updates, I'm steering well clear of .NET and anything that isn't native - the tool should 'just run' without the user having to install anything extra (well, I will say windows XP, no service packs, is the bare minimum required version of windows). In saying that, I don't mind using something third party if it can be bundled in with the tool, as long as it's not huge, and doesn't introduce any interactive steps. Ideally something in the windows API would be best, however I can't seem to track down anything relevant. Currently the tool is a C++ application, so I don't mind if it's quite low level stuff.

 Note #2: "RoutingConnectionString" just happens to be the name of the ConnectionString in this particular version of the class and is not something which would remain the same throughout all of our projects. Note #3: All of our projects utilize SQLServer2005, but I do not see anything wrong with modifications which could help make it more flexible with other database systems such as MySQL or older/newer versions of SQL Server.

@TITLE:WCF InstanceContextMode.Multiple issues
@CONTENT:So I'm hosting WCF service in a WinForms application. I have the following [ServiceBehavior(ConcurrencyMode = ConcurrencyMode.Multiple, 
         InstanceContextMode = InstanceContextMode.PerCall)]
public class Test : ITest
{
    public string TestIt(string input)
    {
        Thread.Sleep(5000);
        return "test";
    }
}
 I'm using Named Pipes and have two instances of another application that act as clients to the above WCF service (running in a WinForms application). I thought based on the ConcurrencyMode setting of Multiple that when Client1 calls the Test Service, Client2 doesn't have to wait till the first call is complete. However, when Client1 calls TestIt, Client2 blocks until the call from Client1 is complete!?!?! Shouldn't it make a new instance each time based on the above settings? Also, is the best way to keep a WinForms application that is hosting a WCF service responsive is by running the WCF service on a separate thread? NOTE: Setting [CallbackBehavior(UseSynchronizationContext = false)] on the Test class does not alleviate the problem. The service still only responds to one request at a time.
@CODE:[ServiceBehavior(ConcurrencyMode = ConcurrencyMode.Multiple, 
         InstanceContextMode = InstanceContextMode.PerCall)]

@TITLE:ID for tags in tag systems
@CONTENT:I'm implementing a tag system similar to StackOverflow tag system. I was thinking about when storing the tags and relating to a question, that relationship will be directly with the tag name or it's better create a field tagID to "link" the question with the tag? Looks that linking directly to tag name is easier, but it doesn't look good, mainly why when working with statistics and/or tag categorization (IMHO) can be hard to manage this. Another problem is when one admin decides "fix" a tag name. If there isn't a tagID separated from tag name, then I will be changing the key of the table... What's your thoughts? Thanks for all replies. I will delete this post since there is another posts with the same subject. I wonder why the search and the suggestion doesn't show it results for me...

@CONTENT:When hovering over a span I would like to get the offsetLeft and offsetTop values so I can make something hover near it. When I do this I get 0 for both values. What is a better way to tackle this? I am using jQuery. Assume I am starting with (looped by server-side scripting): <span onmouseover="hoverNearMe(this.offsetLeft,this.offsetTop);">some username</span><br />
 FINAL THOUGHTS: I'm giving the the answer rep out based on "code leverage"/DRY. The longer function you could use over and over in your own js library. The second short answer however is 100% correct too.

Some extra info: Yes, I do need a DSL, and even if I didn't I still want the experience of building and using one in a project. The DSL contains only data (declarative?), it doesn't get "executed".

Our application has a problem during start in that it doesn't show a task bar icon until the main window is up, even though there are loading progress windows, logon-windows, etc. on screen before that. We change the code to fix this, but unfortunately this fix, when running the app through citrix, now shows two icons, one with just the icon and no text. Is there a way for me to detect that the application is running through citrix? I don't know the right term for this, but only the app window is brought to the users desktop, not the whole remote desktop. If it matters, the app is written in Delphi.

@TITLE:Database design for Tagging multiple types of entities
@CONTENT:I'm currently designing a database schema that's used to store recipes. In this database there are different types of entities that I want to be able to tag (ingredients, recipe issuers, recipes, etc). So a tag has multiple n:m relations. If I use the "three table design", this would result in tables (cross table) for every entity type (recipes, ingredients, issuers) that I have. In other words every time I introduce an entity I have to add a cross table for it. I was thinking of creating one table which has a unique id, that all the entities refer to, and a n:m relation between the tags table and the "unique id"-table. This way there is just one cross table between the "unique id"-table and the tag table. Just in case that some people will think this question already was asked. I already read Database Design for Tagging. And there the three table design is mentioned.

 In my activity, first of all I am scanning all the available devices & preparing ListView. On clicking on list item I connect to that particular device. When device's status become connected then I discover services. I have UUIDs of the device's service & its characteristics. But I am not sure how to write to any particular characteristics or enable or read data from it. Although I have tried this thing but I don't see any success. If any one has any idea about it, so please help me.

@TITLE:Python PyCrypto encrypt/decrypt text files with AES
@CONTENT:I already have a working program, but the only thing that doesn't work is the decrypt_file() function I have. I can still copy the encrypted text from the file and put it in my decrypt() function and have it work, but when I try to use my supposed-to-be handy decrypt_file() function it throws an error. Now I know 99.999% sure that my encrypt() and decrypt() functions are fine, but there is something with the bytes and strings conversion when I read and encode the text file that throws an error; I just can't find the hangup.

@TITLE:WP_Query Woocommerce products that belong in distinct multiple categories only tax_query
@CONTENT:I'm using WP_Query for Woocommerce products in attempt to query products in a particular category. This is the syntax that worked for me - $args = array(
    'posts_per_page' => -1,
    'product_cat' => 'category-slug-here',
    'post_type' => 'product',
    'orderby' => 'title',
);
$the_query = new WP_Query( $args );
// The Loop
while ( $the_query->have_posts() ) {
    $the_query->the_post();
    echo '' . get_the_title() . '<br /><br />';
}
wp_reset_postdata();
 This returns data, but I want to pass an ID, not a category slug, to filter and I want to find products that exist in multiple categories only. The argument product_cat is not native to WP_Query (at least that I can find), so I'm assuming this is something custom to Woocommerce. Through their documentation, I haven't been able to find anything that will allow me to filter by category ID, nor use an AND condition for this filtering. Using cat, the array of tax_query, and category__and have not yielded any results. Essentially, I would like to query all products that exist in both category ID 102, and 115. If I have to use slugs, I'm sure there is a way around getting that info based on the ID I have, but I'd like to avoid 2 queries to filter by multiple categories. Does anyone know how to accomplish this? UPDATE: I have learned that separating category slugs by commas in the product_cat argument will produce an "OR" effect, so it will combine distinct products from both, but this is not what I am looking for. So, for example:  'product_cat' => 'category-slug1, category-slug2'
 will return products from both categories in total, but I am still searching for a way to find distinct products that ONLY belong to both, or multiple, categories.
@CODE:WP_Query $args = array(
    'posts_per_page' => -1,
    'product_cat' => 'category-slug-here',
    'post_type' => 'product',
    'orderby' => 'title',
);
$the_query = new WP_Query( $args );
// The Loop
while ( $the_query->have_posts() ) {
    $the_query->the_post();
    echo '' . get_the_title() . '<br /><br />';
}

@TITLE:Download, Installing and Delete .apk file on android device programmatically from a website other than marketplace
@CONTENT:I've developed some android games and created .apk file.. I've put these .apk files on my website (say: http://www.sush19.com/androidApp/apk/myGame1.apk) Is it possible to directly install this game when this url visit from another app onClick() event. I don't want user to download .apk fine to their sdcard and then install manually, infact the game should be installed directly to the device. I was trying below code in my another app onClick() event: Intent goToMarket = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW).setData(Uri.parse("http://www.sush19.com/androidApp/apk/myGame1.apk"));
startActivity(goToMarket);
 I know the above code is not correct.. but can anyone comment on this..
@CODE:onClick() onClick() Intent goToMarket = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW).setData(Uri.parse("http://www.sush19.com/androidApp/apk/myGame1.apk"));
startActivity(goToMarket); .apk you are about to install myGame1 on your device OK Cancel OK

The push I am receiving from my web server end and what the string it has in alert key is displayed in banner when push comes and you are outside of the app. But as a requirement we want that if I change the language from setting from English to Norwegian then when push comes it's banner's alert string would also change to Norwegian.

@TITLE:Using DTO to transfer data between service layer and UI layer
@CONTENT:I've been trying to figure this out for days but there seems to be very little info on this particular subject with ASP.NET MVC. I've been Googling around for days and haven't really been able to figure anything out about this particular issue. I've got a 3 layer project. Business, DAL and UI/Web layer. In the DAL is dbcontext, repository and unit of work. In the business layer is a domain layer with all the interfaces and the EF models. In the business layer there is also a service layer with DTOs for the EF models and a generic repository service that accesses the repository. This picture should help explain it. My problem is that i just can't seem to figure out how to use the DTOs to transfer data from the business layer. I've created service classes for the DTOs. I've got a ImageDTO and model and same for image anchors. I've created a service class for each DTO. So i've got a image service and anchor service. These services inherit the repository service and at the moment implement their own services. But thats about as far as i have gotten. Since these services have constructors that receive a IUnitOfWork interface via IoC i've pretty much gotten stranded. If i reference the service directly from the UI everything works as it should but i just can't get my mind around how to use DTOs to transmit data both from the service layer to the UI layer and the other way around. My service layer: Business/Services/DTOs public class AnchorDto
{
      public int Id { get; set; }
      public int x1 { get; set; }
      public int y1 { get; set; }

      public int targetImageId { get; set; }

      public AnchorDto(int Id, int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2, string description, int imageId, int targetImageId)

 The Image Service, the IImageService interface is currently empty until i figure out what i need to implement. public class ImageService : RepoService<ImageModel>, IImageService
{
    public ImageService(IUnitOfWork repo)
        : base(repo)
    {

    }
}
 At the moment my controllers aren't really working and aren't using the service layer so i decided not to include any of those. I plan to map the DTOs to ViewModels using auto mapper once i've sorted this issue out. So now, please anyone knowledgeable enough to give me that idea I'm missing so that i can figure this out?

@TITLE:Is there a way to deploy new code with Tornado/Python without restarting the server?
@CONTENT:I've recently started to experiment with Python and Tornado web server/framework for web development. Previously, I have used PHP with my own framework on a LAMP stack. With PHP, deploying updated code/new code is as easy as uploading it to the server because of the way mod_php and Apache interact. When I add new code or update code in Python/Tornado, do I need to restart the Tornado server? I could see this being problematic if you have a number of active users. (a) Do I have to restart the server, or is there another/better way? (b) If so, how can I avoid users being disconnected/getting errors/etc. while it's restarting (which could take a few seconds)? [One possible thought is to use the page flipping paradigm with Nginx pointing to a server, launch the new server instance with updated code, redirect Nginx there and take down the original server...?]

@LINK:/questions/7597989/making-selection-adding-tag-dynamically-in-javascript
@TITLE:Making Selection & Adding tag dynamically in JavaScript
@CONTENT:I need some help about JavaScript on iPhone UIWebView; I have HTML like below: <html>
   <head>
      <title>Example</title>
   </head>
   <body>
     <span>this example for selection <b>from</b> UIWebView</span>
   </body>
</html>
 I want to make a selection, and add <span> tag with color to the selected text in HTML to write a note just like an e-book reader. This is my JavaScript code to get the selected text: NSString *SelectedString = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"function getSelText()"
                     "{"
                     "var txt = '';"
                     " if (window.getSelection)"
                     "{"
                     "txt = window.getSelection();"
                     " }"
                     "else if (document.getSelection)"
                     "{"
                     "txt = document.getSelection();"
                     "}"
                     "else if (document.selection)"
                     "{"
                     "txt = document.selection.createRange().text;"
                     "}"
                     "else return;"
                     "alert(txt);"
                     "}getSelText();"];
[webView stringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromString:SelectedString];
 This works good, and returns me the selected text. Also this JS code for adding a new tag: NSString *AddSpanTag = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"function selHTML() {"
                 "if (window.ActiveXObject) {"
                 "var c = document.selection.createRange();"
                 "return c.htmlText;"
                 "}"
                 "var nNd = document.createElement(\"span\");"
                 "var divIdName = \'myelementid\';"
                 "var ColorAttr = \"background-color: #ffffcc\";"
                 "nNd.setAttribute(\'id\',divIdName);"
                 "nNd.setAttribute(\'style\',ColorAttr);"
                 "var w = getSelection().getRangeAt(0);"
                 "w.surroundContents(nNd);"
                 "return nNd.innerHTML;"
                 "}selHTML();"];
[webView stringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromString:AddSpanTag];
 My problem is so: if I select "example" (look at the HTML text) text from WebView, it works, because it doesn't contain any tag. But if I select "selection from" (look at the HTML text) text from WebView, it's not working, because it starts the tag of <b>, and </b> is out of my selection, then I can't add a new tag between <b> and </b>. How can I solve this problem?

@TITLE:Problem with pThread sync issue
@CONTENT:I am facing a sync issue with pthread. threadWaitFunction1, is a thread wait function. I expect line no. 247 flag = 1 to be executed only after 243-246 has finished. But i find it strange that sometimes, it jumps directly to 247 before 243-246 has finished. Please help me. Thanks in advance. 236   struct timespec timeToWait;
237   static void* threadWaitFunction1(void *timeToWaitPtr)

 The thread which creates and calls the above thread is: 263  static void timer_trackStartTime ()

269 
270      /* Setting timer expiration */
271       timeToWait.tv_sec = lt_leak_start_sec;;  // First expiry after 1 sec
272       timeToWait.tv_nsec = lt_leak_start_nsec;

275       //pthread_kill(thread, SIGKILL); // Destroying the thread to ensure no leaks
276 
.
.
283       }
 If i protect the whole function using pthread_mutex_lock, but still the same problem persists. How to ensure orderly execution? Can anyone help? EDIT: now.tv_sec and now.tv_nsec removed from the code. *EDIT: Changed the flags inside the mutex (still does not work)*

@CONTENT:I have a question, maybe a silly one, but I think it is important. Why the parameter: convertView (View) on the public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent) is always null? android is supposed to recycle the views once they're created the first time, isn't it? or how can I do to recycle those views? I feel like the method receives those 3 parameters, but in none of the google examples they use either of them.

@LINK:/questions/5031409/speeding-up-some-sse2-intrinsics-for-color-conversion
@TITLE:Speeding up some SSE2 Intrinsics for color conversion
@CONTENT:I'm trying to perform image colour conversion from YCbCr to BGRA (Don't ask about the A bit, such a headache). Anyway, this needs to perform as fast as possible, so I've written it using compiler intrinsics to take advantage of SSE2. This is my first venture into SIMD land, I'm basically a beginner and so I'm sure there's plenty I'm doing inefficiently. My arithmetic code for doing the actual colour conversion turns out to be particularly slow, and Intel's VTune is showing it up as a significant bottleneck. So, any way I can speed up the following code? It's being done in 32bit, 4 pixels at a time. I originally tried doing it in 8 bits, 16 pixels at a time (as in the upper loop), but the calculations cause integer overflow and a broken conversion. This whole process, including the Intel jpeg decode is taking ~14ms for a single field of full HD. It'd be great if I could get it down to at least 12ms, ideally 10ms. Any help or tips gratefully appreciated. Thanks! const __m128i s128_8    = _mm_set1_epi8((char)128);

@TITLE:GWT RequestFactory: how to use single EntityManager per request
@CONTENT:In order to get RequestFactory to persist attached entities, I need to ensure that I use the same EntityManager for each request. I cobbled together my own Factory class for this based on a ThreadLocal implementation, but I'm unsure how to properly release resources (e.g. how to know that the request has finished and call close()). Is there a simple way to ensure that a single EntityManager is used throughout a given ServletRequest without resorting to full-on J2EE/CDI? I'll take that route if I must, but I was hoping to keep things simple, especially since I'd like to continue using the lightweight development server that comes with GWT.

@CONTENT:I want to create a html page with a header of fixed height, a middle part with variable height and a footer with fixed height. The footer and the header shall not move when scrolling. No problem so far. But i want the midlle part to be divided, so that the right column and the left column have seperate scrollbars and scroll independently. This is possible with overflow:scroll as long as the parts have fixed heights. But i want them zu grow and shrink with the window. I do not linke frames and i want to alter the contents of the 2 columns frequently using javascript (ajax). What is the best way to create such a page?

@CONTENT:Possible Duplicate: strtok wont accept: char *str When using the strtok function, using a char * instead of a char [] results in a segmentation fault. This runs properly: char string[] = "hello world";
char *result = strtok(string, " ");
 This causes a segmentation fault: char *string = "hello world";
char *result = strtok(string, " ");
 Can anyone explain what causes this difference in behaviour?

@TITLE:Multi-tiered Comment Replies: Display and Storage
@CONTENT:So I'm trying to create a comment system in which you can reply to comments that are already replies (allowing you to create theoretically infinite threads of replies). I want them to display in chronological order (newest on top), but of course the replies should be directly underneath the original comment. If there are multiple comments replying to the same comment, the replies should also be in chronological order (still underneath the original comment). I also want to limit the number of comment groups (a set of comments with a single comment that is not a reply at all) to, say, 25. How should I set up the MySQL table, and what sort of query would I use to extract what I want? Here's a simplified version of my DB: ID int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, DatePosted datetime NOT NULL, InReplyTo int(11) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0', Sorry if this is kind of confusing, I'm not sure how to word it any differently. I've had this problem in the back of my mind for a couple months now, and every time I solve one problem, I end up with another...

@LINK:/questions/3848162/how-do-i-parse-a-polymorphic-json-array
@TITLE:How do I parse a polymorphic JSON array?
@CONTENT:I have a file in JSON format with record for individual users. Some of the users have a comment field stuck in the middle of their records. I just want to parse top-level items ( fullName contributorName email) using the Newtonsoft.JSON parser, but I can't seem to get it to recognize individual objects. When I parse the whole string into one big object, I don't know how to iterate the individual ones. This is how I was trying to do it (property by property), but it didn't work if they were out of order or had subproperties. I need to put it into an object instead: StreamReader re = File.OpenText("C:\\dropbox\\my dropbox\\clients\\towson\\english 317\\Ning Archive\\ning-members.json");
JsonTextReader reader = new JsonTextReader(re);
string ct = "";

try
{
    ct += "<table style='border:1px solid black'>";
    while (reader.Read())
    {
        if (reader.TokenType == JsonToken.PropertyName)
        {
            if (reader.Value.ToString() == "fullName")
            {
                reader.Read();
                ct += "\r\n\r\n<tr><td>" + reader.Value + "</td>";
            }

            }
        }
    }       
}
catch { }

ct+="</table>";
namesText.Text = ct;
 Note the first record has a comments field that I don't care about, but gets in the way of the order when I try to parse as a stream. [

@TITLE:Native Google Reader iPhone Application
@CONTENT:I am currently in the process of building a native Google Reader iPhone application similar to the successful application "Reeder for iPhone", however, with a full Twitter client inbuilt as well. I have finished the Twitter client and am now struggling to start the Google Reader client. I've browsed through multiple documents and have taken a look at the gdata-objective-client samples, yet I still can't seem to understand what I have to do to accomplish the same functionality as Reeder does. Basically I want to be able to present the user with a login screen. The user then submits their credentials and the access token and all of that are done behind scenes, like they do with Twitter's xAuth. I then want to push a view controller that shows a UITableView with all the current unread feeds. When the user clicks the UITableViewCell a detailed view is respectively pushed containing the posts content. Is this possible and if so, how do I go about implementing these features? I would appreciate it if people posted "code snippets" and actually show how they achieve the implementations. Thanks in advance! EDIT: It has been brought to my attention that the google app engine isn't needed. The question however, still remains the same. How would I implement Google Reader into my application?

@TITLE:DOM traversal one by one node using jquery
@CONTENT:I wanted to traverse node by node on a web page by maintaining sequence. e.g. Below is basic DOM : <BODY>
     <DIV id ='1'> Test 1 </DIV>
     <DIV id='2'> Details about <SPAN id='3'> Execution </SPAN> </DIV>   
</BODY>
 As per above example I want traverse each node by node i.e. 1st Traversal : <BODY>

2nd Traversal : <DIV id ='1'>

3rd Traversal : <DIV id='2'>

4rd Traversal : <SPAN id='3'>
 My motive is to loop over all the nodes available on current page and visit each node one by one saying simply nextnode(), while traversing not looking in to parent and child relations. Exepcted is, it should visit each node by following sequence. So my statement will be like this : startnode //consider this is start node

While ( startnode!=null ) {

  // will process on startnode

   startnode= startnode->nextnode();
  // something like that to visit each node
}
 Is any one knows about this, how to achieve this using jquery(preferably) or javascript, please share their references. Thanks -Pravin

@TITLE:Static Variables Behaviour in a Java Servlet
@CONTENT:I am developing a java servlet that while running, starts different objects methods in new threads. Those threads should access a variable that describes the specific servlet instance, say jobId. For this reason, i declared the jobId variable as static. The servlet constructor is calculating this value for each servlet instance (call). I was wandering if the servlet is called few times at the same time, the static jobId variable is shared between the calls, which means that some threads will get the wrong jobId, or it is calculated once for each call- so the threads that a specific servlet started will use the jobId calculated for this specific servlet (which is the way i want it to work). Any ideas? Thanks a lot!

@CONTENT:Sometimes I'm writing ugly if-else statements in C# 3.5; I'm aware of some different approaches to simplifying that with table-driven development, class hierarchy, anonimous methods and some more. The problem is that alternatives are still less wide-spread than writing traditional ugly if-else statements because there is no convention for that. What depth of nested if-else is normal for C# 3.5? What methods do you expect to see instead of nested if-else the first? the second? if i have ten input parameters with 3 states in each, i should map functions to combination of each state of each parameter (really less, because not all the states are valid, but sometimes still a lot). I can express these states as a hashtable key and a handler (lambda) which will be called if key matches. It is still mix of table-driven, data-driven dev. ideas and pattern matching. what i'm looking for is extending for C# such approaches as this for scripting (C# 3.5 is rather like scripting) http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/2004/02/24/79292.aspx

@TITLE:Using Python locale or equivalent in web applications?
@CONTENT:Python's locale implementation seems to want to either read the locale from system settings or have it be set via a setlocale call. Neither of these work for me since I'd like to use the capabilities in a web application, where the desired locale is the user's locale. And there are warnings in the locale docs that make the whole thing scary: On top of that, some implementation are broken in such a way that frequent locale changes may cause core dumps. This makes the locale somewhat painful to use correctly And It is generally a bad idea to call setlocale() in some library routine, since as a side effect it affects the entire program So, is there a reasonable locale alternative for use in web apps? Is Babel it or are there other alternatives? I'm looking for something that will handle currencies as well as dates and numbers. [Update] To clarify, I'm most interested in date, number, and currency formatting for various locales.

@CONTENT:Part 1 I want to build a PHP Zend Framework application that users can sign up to use. When they register, I would like the application to create a sub-domain that points to their public page, that serves up content specific to that client. For example: http://mywebapp.com/username or http://username.mywebapp.com Update: "Using sub-domains as account keys" is a good tutorial that pretty much answered my question on this one. This involves using Zend_Controller_Router_Route_Hostname. However, I am still wondering... Question #1: the tutorial doesn't mention setting up a wildcard sub-domain. Is this necessary in order to achieve this? Is there any way around using a wildcard subdomain? Part 2 I will also need to offer users the ability to register domain names and point them to their page. So if you were to go to http://clientdomain.com, you would be seeing http://clientname.mywebapp.com, but you would never be able to tell because the url in the address bar shows http://client1.com. Does that make sense? I think the process is called domain masking. I basically want to offer my users free domain masking. Update: I've just discovered the world of domain reseller APIs. OpenSRS looks nice. Do you have one to recommend? Question #2: How does domain masking work? Can it work with a domain reseller API?

In SQL, "WHERE col IN (1,2,3)" is roughly the equivalent of "WHERE col = 1 OR col = 2 OR col = 3". He's looking for something which I'll pseudo-code as  WHERE col IN_LIKE ('A%', 'TH%E', '%C')

@TITLE:Add fields to ActiveRecord model dynamically in Rails 2.2.2?
@CONTENT:Say I wanted to allow an administrative user to add a field to an ActiveRecord Model via an interface in the Rails app. I believe the normal ActiveRecord::Migration code would be adequate for modifying the AR Model's table structure (something that would not be wise for many applications - I know). Of course, only certain types of fields could be added...in theory. Obviously, the forms that add (or edit) records to this newly modified ActiveRecord Model would need to be build dynamically at run-time. A common form_for approach won't do. This discussion suggests this can only be accomplished with JavaScript. http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-talk/browse_thread/thread/fc0b55fd4b2438a5 I've used Ruby in the past to query an object for it's available methods. I seem to remember it was insanely slow. I'm too green with Ruby and Rails to know an elegant way to approach this. I hope someone here may. I'm also open to entirely different approaches to this problem that don't involve modifying the database.

@TITLE:C++ member variable aliases?
@CONTENT:I'm pretty sure this is possible, because I'm pretty sure I've seen it done. I think it is awesome, but I will gladly accept answers along the lines of "this is a terrible idea because ____". Say we have a basic struct. struct vertex
{
    float x, y, z;
};
 Now, I want to implement aliases on these variables. vertex pos;
vertex col;
vertex arr;

pos.x = 0.0f; pos.y = 0.5f; pos.z = 1.0f;
col.r = 0.0f; col.g = 0.5f; col.b = 1.0f;
arr[0] = 0.0f; arr[1] = 0.5f; arr[2] = 1.0f;
 Ideally the third syntax would be indistinguishable from an array. That is, if I sent arr as a reference parameter to a function expecting an array of floats into which it will store data (eg many of the OpenGL glGet functions), it would work fine. What do you think? Possible? Possible but stupid?

When called, the function can access these variables. The explicit use of closures is associated with functional programming and with languages such as ML and Lisp. Constructs such as objects in other languages can also be modeled with closures. To use this inside of JavaScript, can someone point me to an example of how this applies?

This C++ library by Mike Vandelay seems like it could also be a great starting point. ...or... any other "wheel" that can take a triangle of Vector3's and tell me if it intersects with an AABB), relatively efficiently. There seem to be a variety of algorithms, but most seem to be written in c++, or just described abstractly in white papers and I need a c# specific implementation for our application. Efficiency is not key, but c# is. (though efficiency is obviously nice too of course ;p ) Any C# options, before I wade through a "math" port ;) would be greatly appreciated! Thanks.

 The error message is confusing me as it appears it has converted the BusinessUser class to an integer. I also tried by putting in the data_class => null and the form then loaded but on submission I got an error that the field was empty though the ID in the hidden field appeared correctly hen the form was generated. Can someone point me in the right direction as have a feeling its something very simple that im not seeing. Thanks UPDATE: I made some changes as realised I should be setting the company in the controller and passing it into the form, and that all seems to work but when the form is submitted I still get null in the database or if i set the field to @Assert\NotBlank() the form wont submit as field cannot be blank even though when I check the source I can see the Id of the BusinessUser in the hidden field. *UPDATE - While implemeting Coma's suggestion below I finally realised where I had gone wrong - it was the transformer it was not returning the object * - If anyone else comes onto this question I would recommend Coma's solution below is much better than having to create a hidden each time. If it is a one off the solution above has been updated to return the object and should work fine.

@TITLE:How to implement an Equalizer
@CONTENT:I know there are a lot of questions about equalizers in so, but I didn't get what I was looking. What I want to do is an equalizer for modifying audio samples in such a way like: equalizer.eqAudio(audiosamples, band, gain)
 I'm not sure if that is the exact interface that I want because I know little about DSP in terms of implementing them (I used filters, limiters, compressors but not made them). So Googling about this I read that I must do a FFT to the samples so I get the data per frequency ranges instead of amplitude, process it the way I want and then make the inverse of the FFT so I get the result in audio samples again. I looked for an implementation of this FFT and found JTransform for Java. This library has an implementation of a FFT related algorithm called Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). My questions are : Well, Am I in the right way? Since FFT gives me data about frequency, I should pass to the FFT algorithm a chunk of samples. How big this chunk must be? Is there a good book about DSP programming that explains equalizers ? Thanks!

@TITLE:how to implement lexical analyser and parser in Haskell
@CONTENT:I got this piece of code here, it is a program written in an imperative programming language structured in Haskell, so the question is "how can I implement a lexer analyser and parser for this language", the program is defined to be a sequence of statements of which there are 6 types: ":=", "goto", "write", "stop", "if goto" and "int" int n=5 write n int fac=1 if0 n goto 8 fac := fac * n n := n-1 goto 4 write fac stop I'm kinda lost here, I've read about lexers and parsers, but did not find any example how to implement them,I will appreciate if you could give me piece of code, so that I could try to do it myself, or at least links with useful info

@TITLE:Absolute session expiration after N minutes even if user is using the system
@CONTENT:I¡¦m working on a grails web application with spring security. I have a requirement for forcing a session expiration after a fixed set of time even if the session is active. I think I can add filter and check for each request's last login time: if (CURRENT_TIME - LAST_LOGIN > ABSOLUTE_SESSIO EXPIRATION) then FORCE LOGOUT
 But the problem is that the session is still active on the server until the user makes request. Is this possible to destroy session immediately after N minutes even if user is using the system? I was researching tomcat session management and how spring security handles it, but didn¡¦t find any useful information. Could anybody point me at some example? Has anybody implemented something similar?

    res = curl_easy_perform(curl);
 The request body is arriving like this:     { '"name" : "Pedro", "age" : "22"' }
 With { ' at the start and ' } at the end. --- MORE INFO ----- if I declare this code     char* jsonObj = "{ \"name\" : \"Pedro\" , \"age\" : \"22\" }";

 the server receives this as the request body: { '{ "name" : "Pedro" , "age" : "22" }': '' }
 My question is: Is the libCurl pre-formatting/encoding automatically the Json request? By the way, does the libCurl have some way of encoding a JSON object? Thanks so much!

@TITLE:GWT or not for enterprise apps
@CONTENT:I am working on an tool to create enterprise level applications on app-engine. This needs to be cross browser (also including IE8), works on mobile, and at a later point of time also supports desktop clients through (Qt4/GTK/etc) The problem that I consistently face is this: For my web-application - should I use GWT(GoogleWebToolkit) or not? I am pretty good at using "EXT-JS", but its not a choice due to its open-source policy. There is another framework "SmartClient" which has a better opensource license- Its pretty mature and better than EXT-JS (based on some POCs), but its documentation sucks! It takes me a lot of time to get something done in a right way. SmartClient and EXT-JS are pretty good for enterprise level applications (when used correctly) - I have experienced this with Ext-JS and very much sure on SmartClient too. Then there is this combination "JQuery and addons and HTML5". I love the faster, cleaner and smaller JS compared to the above libs. I am skeptical about HTML5 since thats an evolving standard What I really like about GWT is its performance benefits. Atleast the examples seem to work great. What I dislike about it is Java and I am pretty good at javascript For my server-side-application at app-engine I am not using Java -but Python. so rpc would be based on json only. We do not have a mobile-version on the plate yet, but thats again a very much needed version later and we may use Sencha-touch for that later. I have done POCs for all of these and GWT deployments feel fast and smooth compared to extjs or smartclient. And there is a lot of stuff that GWT does for me automatically. Also I love the "clean-html" rendered by gwt. I am pretty good at using javascript too and very well aware of the "mistakes" that happen there that lead to the javascript hell. (I am not looking forward to ExtGWT or SmartGWT) Any suggestions on whether I should switch to GWT or is it a good thing for enterprise level applications? Or if somebody has experienced building large apps using GWT, what were the cons (and pros)?

@TITLE:Tagging system: Toxi solution questions
@CONTENT:I'm sort of breaking my head over the Toxi solution for tag database schemas. I'm working on a system to which users can submit items, and those items can have tags associated with them. After reading up on tagschemas, I found the Toxi solution to suit my needs most. However, I'm not entirely sure if I'm planning this right, so I'd like your opinions on this please. I'll have three databases. items containing item_id and others tagmap using item_id and tag_id as foreign keys tags containing tag_id and tag_text When adding a new item, am I right to assume the process to add the tags to the database is as follows? sort submitted tags into array for every tag in the array: get tag_id from tags where tag_text matches the current tag if that returns 0 rows: add tag to tags table get the tag_id add item_id and tag_id to tagmap finish (give user the a-okay, etc) This means we'll end up with an entry in the tagmap for every tag for every item. It seems correct, but I can't help but think there's a better way to do that than ending up with a huge amount of entries there... As for editing the tags, I've thought up the following process, though I think there's a better way which I haven't found yet. get tags using item_id and insert into editable field user makes changes. on submit: delete rows from tagmap where item_id matches the one being edited same process as the one listed above I'm kind of iffy about point 3 there. Is there a way for me to check if any tags have been removed, so I can selectively delete tags instead of just deleting and re-adding them? And just to be sure: when deleting tagmap rows, the related items won't be deleted with it because it points to a foreign key instead of acting as one, right? Also, I may want to keep track of the amount of times a tag is used, but I don't want to run a query to count those every time it needs to be displayed. I'm thinking of having a cron job count the number of instances for every tag_id in tagmap once every hour, or bihourly, and then update the tag_use value in the tags table. Is that a correct way to do it, or is there a better way? Looking back, that's quite the hefty amount of text. Welp, rather too detailed than missing information, and rather asking too many questions and learning a lot of new things than asking too few. Good chance I've just spent too much time looking into this today, and it'll all make more sense tomorrow. Thanks in advance!

@TITLE:Adding a sliding view to a table cell when selected
@CONTENT:I have a dynamic table view with cells populating from a db. When a cell is selected the user should have the possibility to choose few other options. I know how to push another view when the cell is selected but I don't like this approach graphically. It could be better if, for example, the same cell could flip over and show the options (then flip back) maybe with a swipe. Or the entire cell could slide off the screen revealing the options, or another view could slide down from the cell and then slide back up. Which of these solutions is the easiest to do? Can anyone point me to the right direction? I don't need the code of course, I'm here to learn and I just need to know what to look at. Until now, I've read something about subclassing the UITableViewCell, but, honestly, I haven't got it yet. Any input will be greatly appreciated.

@TITLE:PHP: Database Connection Class Constructor Method
@CONTENT:I'm new to OOP. Originally I was defining variables and assigning values to them within the class and outside of the constructor, but after an OOP lesson in Java today, I was told this is bad style and should be avoided. Here is my original PHP database connection class that I mocked-up: class DatabaseConnection {
    private $dbHost = "localhost";
    private $dbUser = "root";
    private $dbPass = "";
    private $dbName = "test";

    function __construct() {    
        $connection = mysql_connect($this->dbHost, $this->dbUser, $this->dbPass)
            or die("Could not connect to the database:<br />" . mysql_error());
        mysql_select_db($this->dbName, $connection) 
            or die("Database error:<br />" . mysql_error());
    }
}
 Is the above considered okay? Or is the following a better way? class DatabaseConnection {
    private $dbHost;
    private $dbUser;
    private $dbPass;
    private $dbName;

    function __construct() {
        $this->dbHost = "localhost";
        $this->dbUser = "root";
        $this->dbPass = "";
        $this->dbName = "test";

        $connection = mysql_connect($this->dbHost, $this->dbUser, $this->dbPass)
            or die("Could not connect to the database:<br />" . mysql_error());
        mysql_select_db($this->dbName, $connection) 
            or die("Database error:<br />" . mysql_error());
    }
}
 What should I be focusing on to make sure I am understanding OOP correctly?
@CODE:class DatabaseConnection {
    private $dbHost = "localhost";
    private $dbUser = "root";
    private $dbPass = "";

It is stored in the models whether they have already voted and what their previous vote was. But how would I be able to modify the stars to show this?

@TITLE:Do good multiplayer/mmo client<>server games use latency within movement calculations?
@CONTENT:There's a couple of questions here. Imagine I have client A who's going to send the following message to Server: "START MOVEMENT FORWARD". The server will not receive this message instantly, as there is a delay because of latency. Question 1: ping (or better: round trip time) is the amount of time it takes for the client to send a message to the server and receive a response back. Does this mean the following if you can ignore the time it takes for the server to notice that it has received a message and start sending a response (this should be very short)? time it takes for client to send someting to server = round-trip-time / 2 time it takes for server to send something to client = round-trip-time / 2 So, when client A sends that message, the server will supposedly receive that message round-trip-time / 2 milliseconds after the client has send the message. This leads me to the next question. Question 2: should the client first send the package, and then wait round-trip-time / 2 milliseconds before actually executing that command client-side (in this case: move forward) to compensate with the latency/lag? Now, the server will send the following message to all nearby players: "CLIENT A IS NOW MOVING FORWARD". These clients will then make sure that the character of client a starts moving, this leads me to the next question. Question 3: should the client receiving the message that an other client has moved take into account that this message was send by the server round-trip-time / 2 milliseconds ago? So that the current time used for movement calculations timestamps should be reduced by round-trip-time / 2? All these methods would in my mind make sure that synchronisation improves between clients, as latency is taken into account. Is this the right way of doing things? Do most other good multiplayer games do this? Any comments, suggestions, alternatives or random but related shouts that you'd like to give? Thanks in advance.

I'am very confused about many aspects of the problem domain. Hope someone will be able to help me. So far I have obtained a stream of decoded audio data from a given mp3. I have understood onset detection is the first step towards transcription. . Is there any java library available which can be used for detecting onsets. Next, detecting the fundamental frequency is also done with the use of FFT as I have read. I want to know the use of FFT in these tasks. (I'm not familiar with FFT much). Is it absolutely necessary to perform FFT for onset detection and F0 detection. If not what are the other ways. Can I perform the FFT on the audiostream I have, or is there some other operation that has to be done in order to manipulate these audio data. Thanks a lot.

@TITLE:Real-time multiplayer game (concept question)
@CONTENT:I've been reading this article from Valve that seems to explain the architecture of their multiplayer system. It seems they delay rendering by a couple ticks on the client so they can handle dropped packets, but they also send packets as "delta snapshots" (the difference between two adjacent states). Suppose we have times A, B, C, and the client is correct at time A but drops the packet at B, and then receives the one at C. How can it correctly deduce the state at time C? The packet at C only tells (I think) the delta between states B and C, and the client only knows the state at A. What am I missing here?

This is to allow direct voice contact between two players, for example, or any other client plugin they may have installed which don't need server interaction (like playing some kind of random game between the two). The server can be there to help setting up the connection. From duskwuff's answer, I got several leads: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STUN which describes an algorithm to do that, and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UDP_hole_punching From those, I got more leads: http://www.h-online.com/security/features/How-Skype-Co-get-round-firewalls-747197.html http://nutss.gforge.cis.cornell.edu/stunt.php -- A possible STUN implementation with TCP With time, I could surely work out something for my program.

That counter is then displayed on a webpage and updated with AJAX or otherwise. The problem is that the tweepy.Stream() function must be continuously running and connected to twitter (thats the point).

    (

 All the reading I have done so far suggests I turn this into JSON by using json_encode If I run the Array though this and echo it to the screen I get: [{"poiUid":"20","poiName":"Brighton Cineworld","poiCode":"brighton-cineworld","poiLon":"-0.100450","poiLat":"50.810780","poiType":"Cinemas"},{"poiUid":"21","poiName":"Brighton Odeon","poiCode":"brighton-odeon","poiLon":"-0.144420","poiLat":"50.821860","poiType":"Cinemas"}]

@TITLE:Unified way to scrape HTML from any type of browser process? [closed]
@CONTENT:Is there a unified way to do this? Browsers usually don't respond as expected to user32's GetWindowText and SendMessage, which you can use to scrape the text out of most win32 applications. I'd like to get the equivalent of "View Source" on the open web page. Currently, I'm using the API for screen readers to scrape from IE, but that doesn't work for FF or Chrome or etc. ANY suggestions (not requiring me to proxy or try to connect to a web server) to do this for different browsers is GREATLY appreciated. Again, I'm using the screen reader API for IE (which doesn't always work correctly!)... This question now has a bounty. To collect the bounty, I want to see code, in c#, to scrape an IE window and a FireFox window. Alternatively, code for a HTTP proxy that does the same thing (i.e., record the current request's content) that works for HTTPS as well. Let me be clear... My requirements are to scrape a window. Oh, and by the way, that window is a browser. I give you the option to show me a proxy to claim the bounty. I already understand there are proxies and what they do, telling me about their existence isn't helping me. I also can't just connect to the url in code and scrape the response object. Why? Requirements won't let me, among other issues. I require a solution in .net, as the tags say.

@CONTENT:All port operations in Rebol 3 are asynchronous. The only way I can find to do synchronous communication is calling wait. But the problem with calling wait in this case is that it will check events for all open ports (even if they are not in the port block passed to wait). Then they call their responding event handlers, but a read/write could be done in one of those event handlers. That could result in recursive calls to "wait". How do I get around this?

@TITLE:How can I perform a culture-sensitive ¡§starts-with¡¨ operation from the middle of a string?
@CONTENT:I have a requirement which is relatively obscure, but it feels like it should be possible using the BCL. For context, I'm parsing a date/time string in Noda Time. I maintain a logical cursor for my position within the input string. So while the complete string may be "3 January 2013" the logical cursor may be at the 'J'. Now, I need to parse the month name, comparing it against all the known month names for the culture: Culture-sensitively Case-insensitively Just from the point of the cursor (not later; I want to see if the cursor is "looking at" the candidate month name) Quickly ... and I need to know afterwards how many characters were used The current code to do this generally works, using CompareInfo.Compare. It's effectively like this (just for the matching part - there's more code in the real thing, but it's not relevant to the match): internal bool MatchCaseInsensitive(string candidate, CompareInfo compareInfo)
{
    return compareInfo.Compare(text, position, candidate.Length,
                               candidate, 0, candidate.Length, 
                               CompareOptions.IgnoreCase) == 0;
}
 However, that relies on the candidate and the region we compare being the same length. Fine most of the time, but not fine in some special cases. Suppose we have something like: // U+00E9 is a single code point for e-acute
var text = "x b\u00e9d y";
int position = 2;
// e followed by U+0301 still means e-acute, but from two code points
var candidate = "be\u0301d";
 Now my comparison will fail. I could use IsPrefix: if (compareInfo.IsPrefix(text.Substring(position), candidate,
                         CompareOptions.IgnoreCase))
 but: That requires me to create a substring, which I'd really rather avoid. (I'm viewing Noda Time as effectively a system library; parsing performance may well be important to some clients.) It doesn't tell me how far to advance the cursor afterwards In reality, I strongly suspect this won't come up very often... but I'd really like to do the right thing here. I'd also really like to be able to do it without becoming a Unicode expert or implementing it myself :) (Raised as bug 210 in Noda Time, in case anyone wants to follow any eventual conclusion.) I like the idea of normalization. I need to check that in detail for a) correctness and b) performance. Assuming I can make it work correctly, I'm still not sure how whether it would be worth changing over all - it's the sort of thing which will probably never actually come up in real life, but could hurt the performance of all my users :( I've also checked the BCL - which doesn't appear to handle this properly either. Sample code: using System;
using System.Globalization;

class Test
{
    static void Main()
    {
        var culture = (CultureInfo) CultureInfo.InvariantCulture.Clone();
        var months = culture.DateTimeFormat.AbbreviatedMonthNames;
        months[10] = "be\u0301d";
        culture.DateTimeFormat.AbbreviatedMonthNames = months;

        var text = "25 b\u00e9d 2013";
        var pattern = "dd MMM yyyy";
        DateTime result;
        if (DateTime.TryParseExact(text, pattern, culture,
                                   DateTimeStyles.None, out result))
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Parsed! Result={0}", result);
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Didn't parse");
        }
    }
}
 Changing the custom month name to just "bed" with a text value of "bEd" parses fine. Okay, a few more data points: The cost of using Substring and IsPrefix is significant but not horrible. On a sample of "Friday April 12 2013 20:28:42" on my development laptop, it changes the number of parse operations I can execute in a second from about 460K to about 400K. I'd rather avoid that slowdown if possible, but it's not too bad. Normalization is less feasible than I thought - because it's not available in Portable Class Libraries. I could potentially use it just for non-PCL builds, allowing the PCL builds to be a little less correct. The performance hit of testing for normalization (string.IsNormalized) takes performance down to about 445K calls per second, which I can live with. I'm still not sure it does everything I need it to - for example, a month name containing "?" should match "ss" in many cultures, I believe... and normalizing doesn't do that.
@CODE:CompareInfo.Compare internal bool MatchCaseInsensitive(string candidate, CompareInfo compareInfo)

    return compareInfo.Compare(text, position, candidate.Length,

@TITLE:Different cast operator called by different compilers
@CONTENT:Consider the following short C++ program: #include <iostream>

class B {
public:
    operator bool() const {
        return false;
    }
};

class B2 : public B {

};

int main() {
    B2 b;
    std::cout << std::boolalpha << (bool)b << std::endl;
}
 If I compile it on different compilers, I get various results. With Clang 3.4 and GCC 4.4.7 it prints true, while Visual Studio 2013 prints false, which means that they call different cast operators at (bool)b. Which is the correct behavior according to the standard? In my understanding operator bool() needs no conversion, while operator int() would require an int to bool conversion, so the compiler should choose the first one. Does const do something with that, is const-conversion considered more "expensive" by the compiler? If I remove the const, all compilers equally produce false as output. On the other hand, if I combine the two classes together (both operators will be in the same class) all three compilers will produce true output.
@CODE:#include <iostream>

class B {
public:
    operator bool() const {

@LINK:/questions/18958747/how-does-mn-exactly-n-times-twice-work
@TITLE:How does {m}{n} (¡§exactly n times¡¨ twice) work?
@CONTENT:So, some way or another (playing around), I found myself with a regex like \d{1}{2}. Logically, to me, it should mean: (A digit exactly once) exactly twice, i.e. a digit exactly twice. But it, in fact, appears to just mean "a digit exactly once" (thus ignoring the {2}). String regex = "^\\d{1}{2}$"; // ^$ to make those not familiar with 'matches' happy
System.out.println("1".matches(regex)); // true
System.out.println("12".matches(regex)); // false
 Similar results can be seen using {n}{m,n} or similar. Why does this happen? Is it explicitly stated in regex / Java documentation somewhere or is it just a decision Java developers made on-the-fly or is it maybe a bug?

@LINK:/questions/10723458/should-the-hash-code-of-null-always-be-zero-in-net
@TITLE:Should the hash code of null always be zero, in .NET
@CONTENT:Given that collections like System.Collections.Generic.HashSet<> accept null as a set member, one can ask what the hash code of null should be. It looks like the framework uses 0: // nullable struct type
int? i = null;
i.GetHashCode();  // gives 0
EqualityComparer<int?>.Default.GetHashCode(i);  // gives 0

// class type
CultureInfo c = null;
EqualityComparer<CultureInfo>.Default.GetHashCode(c);  // gives 0
 This can be (a little) problematic with nullable enums. If we define enum Season
{
  Spring,
  Summer,
  Autumn,
  Winter,
}
 then the Nullable<Season> (also called Season?) can take just five values, but two of them, namely null and Season.Spring, have the same hash code. It is tempting to write a "better" equality comparer like this: class NewNullEnumEqComp<T> : EqualityComparer<T?> where T : struct
{
  public override bool Equals(T? x, T? y)
  {
    return Default.Equals(x, y);
  }
  public override int GetHashCode(T? x)
  {
    return x.HasValue ? Default.GetHashCode(x) : -1;
  }
}
 But is there any reason why the hash code of null should be 0? EDIT/ADDITION: Some people seem to think this is about overriding Object.GetHashCode(). It really is not, actually. (The authors of .NET did make an override of GetHashCode() in the Nullable<> struct which is relevant, though.) A user-written implementation of the parameterless GetHashCode() can never handle the situation where the object whose hash code we seek is null. This is about implementing the abstract method EqualityComparer<T>.GetHashCode(T) or otherwise implementing the interface method IEqualityComparer<T>.GetHashCode(T). Now, while creating these links to MSDN, I see that it says there that these methods throw an ArgumentNullException if their sole argument is null. This must certainly be a mistake on MSDN? None of .NET's own implementations throw exceptions. Throwing in that case would effectively break any attempt to add null to a HashSet<>. Unless HashSet<> does something extraordinary when dealing with a null item (I will have to test that). NEW EDIT/ADDITION: Now I tried debugging. With HashSet<>, I can confirm that with the default equality comparer, the values Season.Spring and null will end in the same bucket. This can be determined by very carefully inspecting the private array members m_buckets and m_slots. Note that the indices are always, by design, offset by one. The code I gave above does not, however, fix this. As it turns out, HashSet<> will never even ask the equality comparer when the value is null. This is from the source code of HashSet<>:     // Workaround Comparers that throw ArgumentNullException for GetHashCode(null).
    private int InternalGetHashCode(T item) {
        if (item == null) { 
            return 0;
        } 
        return m_comparer.GetHashCode(item) & Lower31BitMask; 
    }
 This means that, at least for HashSet<>, it is not even possible to change the hash of null. Instead, a solution is to change the hash of all the other values, like this: class NewerNullEnumEqComp<T> : EqualityComparer<T?> where T : struct
{
  public override bool Equals(T? x, T? y)
  {
    return Default.Equals(x, y);
  }
  public override int GetHashCode(T? x)
  {
    return x.HasValue ? 1 + Default.GetHashCode(x) : /* not seen by HashSet: */ 0;
  }
}
@CODE:System.Collections.Generic.HashSet<> null null 0 // nullable struct type
int? i = null;
i.GetHashCode();  // gives 0
EqualityComparer<int?>.Default.GetHashCode(i);  // gives 0

// class type
CultureInfo c = null;
EqualityComparer<CultureInfo>.Default.GetHashCode(c);  // gives 0 enum Season
{
  Spring,
  Summer,
  Autumn,
  Winter,
} Nullable<Season> Season? null Season.Spring class NewNullEnumEqComp<T> : EqualityComparer<T?> where T : struct
{
  public override bool Equals(T? x, T? y)
  {
    return Default.Equals(x, y);
  }
  public override int GetHashCode(T? x)
  {
    return x.HasValue ? Default.GetHashCode(x) : -1;
  }
} null 0 Object.GetHashCode() GetHashCode() Nullable<> GetHashCode() null EqualityComparer<T>.GetHashCode(T) IEqualityComparer<T>.GetHashCode(T) ArgumentNullException null null HashSet<> HashSet<> null HashSet<> Season.Spring null m_buckets m_slots HashSet<> null HashSet<> // Workaround Comparers that throw ArgumentNullException for GetHashCode(null).
    private int InternalGetHashCode(T item) {
        if (item == null) { 
            return 0;
        } 
        return m_comparer.GetHashCode(item) & Lower31BitMask; 
    } HashSet<> null class NewerNullEnumEqComp<T> : EqualityComparer<T?> where T : struct
{
  public override bool Equals(T? x, T? y)
  {
    return Default.Equals(x, y);
  }
  public override int GetHashCode(T? x)

  char *pread;

 Say, ex.buf points to an array or some malloc'ed memory. If my code always ensures that pwrite and pread point within that array or one past it, then I am fairly confident that ex.pwrite - ex.pread will always be defined. However, what if pwrite and pread are both NULL. Can I just expect subtracting the two is defined as (ptrdiff_t)0 or does strictly compliant code need to test the pointers for NULL? Note that the only case I am interested in is when both pointers are NULL (which represents a buffer not initialized case). The reason has to do with a fully compliant "available" function given the preceding assumptions are met: size_t buf_avail(const struct s_buf *b)

Launching instruments connected to an iPhone from the command line works fine but if I attempt to launch a second instruments connected to an iPad, the first instruments session hangs. Upon terminating the first instruments session, I get one of more of the following lines printed: Stopped: Script stopped due to device being disconnected After extensive research on the subject, with no results on the phrase, I've been trying to read into what is meant by Apple's Instruments Guide: When you choose All Processes, Attach to Process, or Choose Target from the Target menu, Instruments sets the default target for all instruments to the program you choose. There are occasions, however, when you might want to set a different target for each instrument. You might want to sample two different programs at the same time, for example, using the Sampler instrument. If you have some instruments that are capable of tracing all processes, you might want them to do just that while single-process instruments sample just one process. I'm wondering if the Automation.tracetemplate is a single-process only instrument and that if another process is started with the same Automation trace then the first is usurped. Any advice would be grateful as this is a major block for running our time intensive automation tests over multiple iOSDevices.

@CONTENT:I've got a junk directory where I toss downloads, one-off projects, email drafts, and other various things that might be useful for a few days but don't need to be saved forever. To stop this directory from taking over my machine, I wrote a program that will delete all files older than a specified number of days and logs some statistics about the number of files deleted and their size just for fun. I noticed that a few project folders were living way longer than they should, so I started to investigate. In particular, it seemed that folders for projects in which I had used SVN were sticking around. It turns out that the read-only files in the .svn directories are not being deleted. I just did a simple test on a read-only file and discovered that System.IO.File.Delete and System.IO.FileInfo.Delete will not delete a read-only file. I don't care about protecting files in this particular directory; if something important is in there it's in the wrong place. Is there a .NET class that can delete read-only files, or am I going to have to check for read-only attributes and strip them?

In order to do that I need to redirect the user to a LinkedIn URL which contains a callback redirect_uri parameter which will tell LinkedIn to redirect the user back to my webapp and include a "code" query param in the URL. It's a traditional Oauth 2.0 flow. Everything works great except that LinkedIn redirects the user back to the following URL: http://localhost:8080/?code=XXX&state=YYY#/users/123/providers/LinkedIn/social-sites
 I would like to remove ?code=XXX&state=YYY from the URL in order to make it clean. The user does not need to see the query parameters I received from LinkedIn redirect. I tried $location.absUrl($location.path() + $location.hash()).replace(), but it keep the query params in the URL. I am also unable to extract the query parameters, e.g. "code", using ($location.search()).code. It seems like having ? before # in the URL above is tricking Angular.

@LINK:/questions/15442262/gmspolyline-very-large-memory-spike
@TITLE:GMSPolyline very large memory spike
@CONTENT:In a GPS app that allows the user to display a list of complex location points that we call tracks on various different types of map, each track can consist of between 2k to 10k of location points. The tracks are copiously clipped, pruned and path-simplified when they are rendered on non-Google map types. This is to keep memory usage down and performance up. We typically only wind up submitting far less than a thousand (aggregate) transformed location points to the OpenGL pipeline, even in the worst cases. In integrating the Google Maps SDK for iOS, we initially attempted to continue to leverage our own OpenGL track rendering system, but ran into issues with conflicting OpenGL context usage (rendering worked, but we couldn't get GMSMapView to and our own internal OpenGL resources to both release without someone touching deleted memory). So we are trying to leverage the GMSPolyline constructs and just let the Google SDK do the track rendering, but we've run into major memory usage issues, and are looking for guidance in working around them. Using Xcode Instruments, we've monitored memory usage when creating about 25 poly lines with about 23k location points total (not each). Over the course of poly line creation, app memory usage grows from about 14 MB to about 172 MB, a net peak of about 158 MB. Shortly after all the poly lines are created, memory usage finally drops back down to around 19 MB and seems stable, for a cumulative net of around 5 MB, so it seems each location point requires around 220 bytes (5 MB / 23k points) to store. What hurts us is the peak memory usage. While our laboratory test only used 23k location points, in the real world there are often many more, and iOS seems to jettison our application after Google Maps has consumed around 450 MB on an iPhone 5 (whereas our internal poly line rendering system peaks at around 12 MB for the same test case). Clearly the GMSPolyLine construct is not intended for the heavy weight usage that we require. We tried wrapping some of the poly line creation loops with separate autorelease pools, and then draining those at appropriate points, but this has no impact on memory use. The peak memory use after the poly lines are created and control is returned to the main run loop didn't change at all. Later it became clear why; the Google Map system isn't releasing resources until the first DisplayLink callback after the poly lines are created. Our next effort will be to manually throttle the amount of data we're pushing at GMSPolyline, probably using our own bounds testing, clipping, pruning & minimization, rather than relying on Google Maps to do this efficiently. The drawback here is that it will mean many more GMSPolyline objects will be allocated and deallocated, potentially while the user is panning/zooming around the map. Each of these objects will have far fewer location points, yet still, we're concerned about unforeseen consequences of this approach, hidden overhead of many GMSPolyline allocs and deallocate. So the question is, what is the best approach for dealing with this situation, and can someone from Google shed some light on any GMSPolyline best practices, upper bounds, bottlenecks, etc. ?

@TITLE:Have you ever burned your hands by some new and immature technology?
@CONTENT:I often hear people saying you shouldn't rush into adopting new technologies until they have become stable, tried and tested. There is even a joke on how it takes 3 versions to get it right. This might be the voice of real-life experience, but at least sometimes such posture is the result of complacency, resistance to change and effort necessary to learn new skills. In my opinion however, it is crucial for success in software industry to keep the pace with the innovation. While big companies have whole departments dedicated to R&D, in smaller companies it's the development teams that have to keep up. Embark on the new technology even before it is officially out - this will give you some head-start and will help you keep up with the rest. Here is the strategy that I try to follow whenever possible: Be aggressive in adopting new technologies Use early betas for experimenting and prototypes and RCs for development Address any last minute changes to the product when official release of technology you adopted early comes out Do not rely on some obscure open source project with 0 activity Be sure to study but take with a grain of salt official product roadmap. So far, I never paid the price of being too zealous to jump on some new technology train, still I reaped the benefits. I wonder if this is just a coincidence or maybe being early-adopter is not so dangerous after all? More than inviting to a discussion on the subject early-adoption, since such issue is surely to be contentious and subjective, I would like to hear real-life experiences where adopting early new technology proved to be a serious mistake and dire price had to be paid.

    print word, count iteritems() items() for word, count in sorted(count_words(filename).iteritems()):
    print word, count

@TITLE:how to pass an integer as ConverterParameter?
@CONTENT:I am trying to bind to an integer property: 
<RadioButton Content="None"
             IsChecked="{Binding MyProperty,
                         Converter={StaticResource IntToBoolConverter},
                         ConverterParameter=0}" />
 and my converter is: 
[ValueConversion(typeof(int), typeof(bool))]
public class IntToBoolConverter : IValueConverter
{
    public object Convert(object value, Type t, object parameter, CultureInfo culture)
    {
        return value.Equals(parameter);
    }

    public object ConvertBack(object value, Type t, object parameter, CultureInfo culture)
    {
        return value.Equals(false) ? DependencyProperty.UnsetValue : parameter;
    }
}
 the problem is that when my converter is called the parameter is string. i need it to be an integer. of course i can parse the string, but do i have to? thanks for any help konstantin
