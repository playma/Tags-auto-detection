@TITLE:Why do the System.IOUtils functions and TStreamReader use fmShareCompat?
@CONTENT:When I first saw the System.IOUtils unit with functions like TFile.ReadAllBytes and TFile.ReadAllText and the TStreamReader and TBinaryReader classes in System.Classes I was quite excited to have easy ways to read binary and text files. After using them for a while I noticed that the default share mode is implicitly fmShareCompat, since they all use TFileStream.Create, but do not explicitly specify a share mode. Since fmShareCompat is treated as fmShareExclusive on Windows this leads to file locking problems when using them. Is this an oversight by the Delphi developers? Or is there a reason to not use fmShareDenyWrite by default? Also why is there no way to specify a share mode? I am now tempted to write my own version of these classes in order to make them more sharing friendly.

@LINK:/questions/23333446/using-shared-ptr-with-swig-directors-for-java
@TITLE:Using shared_ptr with SWIG Directors for Java
@CONTENT:I'm starting to get the hang of SWIG, and the latest version(v3.0) of SWIG seems to handle just about everything I need out of the box, including C++11 features, but I have hit a snag when it comes to using shared_ptr with my director classes. I have been able to get shared_ptr to work with normal proxy classes great, but now on my directors, it seems to not be supported out of the box. It is giving me the auto-generated type like SWIGTYPE_p_std__shared_ptrT_MyDataType_t and is generating a broken interface because it isn't using the same types that the proxy classes use. I have a simplified example of what I'm trying to do (run with swig -c++ -java Test.i on swig 3.0): Test.i %module(directors="1") test
%{

%}

%include <std_shared_ptr.i>

%shared_ptr(MyDataType)

class MyDataType {
public:
    int value;
};

class NonDirectorClass {
public:
    std::shared_ptr<MyDataType> TestMethod();
};

%feature("director") CallbackBaseClass;

class CallbackBaseClass {
public:
    virtual ~CallbackBaseClass() {};
    virtual std::shared_ptr<MyDataType> GetDataFromJava() {};
};
 Basically what I'm going to be doing is extending the CallbackBaseClass in Java and I want to be able to pass around my shared_ptr wrapped types. The non-director class generates the shared_ptr types just fine. The director class proxy files get generated correctly, but the SwigDirector_ methods in the wrapper reference the incorrect types. It seems like I could manually repair the files by changing the type of SWIGTYPE_p_std__shared_ptrT_MyDataType_t to MyDataType everywhere, but I'm hoping someone with more swig knowledge can answer the question so this can be generated correctly. The best clue I have is here, but I'm still trying to figure out how to correctly use these type maps, especially for shared_ptr and not basic primitives. UPDATE: The documentation says: Note: There is currently no support for %shared_ptr and the director feature. Though it gives no indication as to why. I'd like to know if this is an impossibility with swig directors, if there is a good reason why not to use shared_ptr in directors. It seems like it makes sense to use the same types you use everywhere else. I hope the answer is it is still possible.

@TITLE:How to combine lenses in ¡§parallel¡¨
@CONTENT:I'm new to the excelent Control.Lens and I'm trying to combine 2 lens in "parallel" (not in sequence) like I would do with `Control.Arrow.&&&). If I take the example from the lens documentation: `data Foo a = Foo { _baz :: Int, _bar :: Int, a }
 I would like to be able to do stuff like : >> let foo = (bar &&& baz) .~ (1, 20) $ Foo undefined undefined "FOO"
>> foo ^. (bar &&& baz) 
(1, 20)
 I've looked everywhere and I could not find a way to do so. Is that because : (&&&) exist with another name and I missed it. It's useless. I should not need it, therefore nobody bothered implementing it. It's trivial to do in another way (using both or <*>) Update &&& can be implemented that way : (/|\) :: Lens' f a -> Lens' f b -> Lens' f (a, b)
a /|\ b = lens getBoth setBoth where
    getBoth f = (f ^. a, f ^. b)
    setBoth f (v, w) = a .~ v $ f' where
        f' = b .~ w $ f

barz :: Lens' Foo (Int, Int)
barz = bar /|\ baz
 However, it needs a type signature which is a bit annoying.

@LINK:/questions/23320787/why-does-sslsocketfactory-lack-setenabledciphersuites
@TITLE:Why does SSLSocketFactory lack setEnabledCipherSuites?
@CONTENT:SSLSocketFactory provides getDefaultCipherSuites (ciphers that are enabled by default on sockets) and getSupportedCipherSuites (ciphers that can be enabled, if desired). However, SSLSocketFactory does not offer setEnabledCipherSuites to configure the cipher list once to provide the preference on subsequent sockets. In fact, I think making setEnabledCipherSuites part of SSLSocket really complicates wok flows. For example, HttpsURLConnection does not provide a getSocket, and it really breaks this flow: ...
SSLContext context = SSLContext.getInstance("TLS");
context.init(null, trustManager.getTrustManagers(), null);

HttpsURLConnection connection = (HttpsURLConnection) url.openConnection();
connection.setSSLSocketFactory(context.getSocketFactory());
 I think the same can be said about SSLContext since it has methods like getDefaultSSLParameters and getSupportedSSLParameters. I'm trying to come up with a sound security engineering reason for the (in)ability, but I can't. Perhaps there's a software engineering reason for the decision. (I suspect there's a good reason, and I lack the insight to see it at the moment). Why does Java lack the ability to configure the SSLSocketFactory? Its clearly a design decision, and I'm trying to understand why it was made at the expense of security in a relevant portion of the library.

@TITLE:Enforcing supertype & subtype data integrity without stored procedures, triggers, or UDFs
@CONTENT:I run a small food production business and I need to manage customer orders. I have built a conceptual data model of this aspect of my business but I need some pointers on how to fully implement this in an RDMS. As a first step, I have come up with the logical model given below. My knowledge of data modeling is limited, so there may be errors in my diagram but hopefully it conveys my intention. Note that this is merely a simplified portion of a larger schema and I'm presenting only the relevant tables for the sake of simplicity. The data model in brief A customer Ordr can have one or more OrdrItems An OrdrItem can be either a FoodItem or a ComboItem A ComboItem is a logical grouping of two or more FoodItems I have implemented the above schema in MySQL and I have written a few small programs to populate the tables with customer orders. This gets the job done but without much thought towards data integrity. I have noticed that with this implementation some data integrity rules are not enforced at the database level. For example, FoodItem is a subtype of OrdrItem. For each row in FoodItem there must be exactly one corresponding row in OrdrItem. However, in its current implementation, I can delete a row from FoodItem thus leaving a row in OrdrItem without a corresponding row in one of the subtype tables. This should be disallowed Some further data constraints An order must have at least one associated "order item" (i.e., an order cannot be empty) An order item must be of exactly one associated subtype of either FoodItem or ComboItem (i.e., an OrderItem cannot be both a FoodItem and ComboItem). Some further constraints will probably arise in the future I would like these data integrity rules to be baked into the database, such that I don't have to concern myself with their enforcement in every new client application, throw-away script or shoddy SQL statement that I write. I suspect that if I don't make these guarantees at the database level, I greatly increase my chances of running into data integrity issues down the road. The Question I have only the faintest knowledge of stored procedures, triggers, and user-defined functions. I get the impression that some or all of these features can help me achieve what I want. However, if I can get the job done with check constraints, foreign keys and relatively simple features alone, I'll gladly go that route. Basically, I want to limit complexity as much as possible and not pull in every nifty database feature if it isn't warranted. Is it possible to ensure the data integrity I want without resorting to stored procedures, triggers, user-defined functions and other more esoteric database features? I'm willing to use either MySQL or Postgresql to implement my solution as I have a basic working knowledge of both systems. Finally, if this kind of approach towards data integrity is considered overkill, or if there is a far more pragmatic but slightly imperfect solution, I'm open to that as well.

@TITLE:Preserve traditional anchor behavior with ng-include
@CONTENT:I am not building a single-page application, but rather a "traditional" site that uses AngularJS in places. I've hit the following problem (using 1.3.0-beta.6): Standard, working anchor links: <a href="#foo">Link text</a>
... [page content]
<a id="foo"></a>
<h1>Headline</h1>
[more content]
 That works fine. Now I introduce a template partial somewhere: <script type="text/ng-template" id="test-include.html">
  <p>This text is in a separate partial and inlcuded via ng-include.</p>
</script>
 which is invoked via: <div ng-include="'test-include.html'"></div>
 The partial is included properly, but the anchor link no longer works. Clicking on "Link text" now changes the displayed URL to /#/foo rather than /#foo and the page position does not change. My understanding is that using ng-include implicitly tells Angular that I want to use the routes system and overrides the browser's native anchor link behavior. I've seen recommendations to work around this by changing my html anchor links to #/#foo, but I can't do that for other reasons. I don't intend to use the routes system - I just want to use ng-include without it messing with browser behavior. Is this possible?

 And a friend of mine, reviewing my code, said that I shouldn't create methods that 'extend the List class', since that violates the open/closed principle. If I want to extend the class List I should create a new class that inherits from List and implement my "merge" method in that new class. Is he right? Extending the List class violates the Open/Closed principle?
@CODE:public static bool Assimilate(this List<Card> first, List<Card> second)
{
    // Trivial
    if (first.Count == 0 || second.Count == 0)
    {
        return false;
    }

    // Sort the lists, so I can do a binarySearch
    first.Sort();
    second.Sort();

    // Copia only the new elements
    int index;
    for (int i = 0; i < second.Count; i++)
    {
        index = first.BinarySearch(second[i]);
        if (index < 0)
        {
            first.Insert(~index, second[i]);
        }
    }

    // Edit
    second = null;

@TITLE:How do I mock controller context in my unit test so that my partial view to string function works?
@CONTENT:I am attempting to create a unit test for my controller, but the action I am testing uses a partial view to string function which doesn't want to work in my tests. private string RenderPartialViewToString(string viewName, object model = null)
{
   if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(viewName))
            viewName = ControllerContext.RouteData.GetRequiredString("action");

   ViewData.Model = model;

      viewResult.View.Render(viewContext, sw);

   }
}
 This gives me an error of "Object reference not set to an instance of an object" on the line ViewEngineResult viewResult = ViewEngines.Engines.FindPartialView(ControllerContext, viewName); My setup in the unit test for the controller is (with a few bits removed to simplify it): var mock = new Mock<ControllerContext>();

@TITLE:innerHTML not writing into an svg group Firefox and IE
@CONTENT:I am working on a project and ran into a road block. In Chrome it works as intended but not in Firefox and IE. The code below is really just a very simplified version of the real project code. Basically I'm trying to replace the circles in each group of the svg. So I start with precoded circles and then remove and set innerHTML to a new circle with new location and radius. It is necessary to remove the existing circles as in the final version I will want to completely replace the contents. I realize innerHTML will replace the contents but I am running this in a loop and so I'd ultimately need to += to the end of the circles after clearing it out. I know probably not a good explanation... Requirements are that it clears the children of group with id="whateverIWant" as there is more than one group, then redefines the children. There can be more than one child circle in the group, and each iteration, or refresh, there could be a different number of children circles as the last time. A lot of trial and error got me to this point, but there are probably better methods to clear the children and re create them. Keep in mind the attributes of the new children can change and that in production I may be handling hundreds of these children. I'm also storing a collection of the children as strings in an array before adding them for purposes of other processing. <svg viewBox="0 0 640 480" height="480" width="640" style="background-color:white" version="1.1">

@LINK:/questions/23272782/why-does-every-class-in-vba-have-an-application-property
@TITLE:Why does every class in VBA have an Application property?
@CONTENT:I would like a bit of clarification about why each class (or nearly each class) in VBA (when you scroll through Object Browser) has an Application property. MSDN says When used without an object qualifier, this property returns an Application object that represents the Microsoft Excel application. When used with an object qualifier, this property returns an Application object that represents the creator of the specified object (you can use this property with an OLE Automation object to return the application of that object). Read-only. The first sentence is pretty clear. Your hosting application used without a qualifier can be one of the MS Office products supporting VBA. In Excel Debug.Print Application = Microsoft Excel In Word Debug.Print Application = Microsoft Word etc... but...the second sentence is totally unclear to me... So I am thinking like no matter where you call .Application from it will always return the host of an object... So, what is the point of each class in VBA to have an Application property? PS. you can always call .Parent => .Parent to go up the hierarchy... can't you? You can just call the Application wit no qualifier to get that... I can't even think of one SSCCE OLE scenario for this so I am sorry I am not providing an example. The Application property (not to be confused with Application class) is poorly documented this is why I am asking for someone with more experience to clarify this for me. ????One (well, sort of) scenario, but not sure it even applies here could be using Interop for Office. Like, when you have an external application that opens two files ( one Excel, and one Word ) then by getting references to Ranges in both, you may be able to return Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Word.. but would this be even useful to anyone? hmm..Am I not understanding this entire concept?

The one problem I've encountered with it, however, is "flickering" on page load. What I mean by this is fairly straight forward: The page loads with original HTML select element (which of course looks like crap) The Bootstrap-select plugin JS runs At some noticeable time after the page loads the original HTML select element is converted to a nice Bootstrap-select element by JS in Step (2). So, the user first sees the HTML select element and then sees it switch to the pretty Bootstrap-select item, thus the "flickering". Has anyone found a good solution to the problem?

@TITLE:Memory leak using Powershell Remote Calls in C#
@CONTENT:I have a windows service that is doing a lot of exchange remote calls to get some server information. I noticed that as longs as the time passes the memory used by the service starts growing until a memory exception is thrown. I have searched and it looks like there is a known memory leak in the System.Management.Automation that does not dispose all the memory of the Runspace created while calling the close and/or dispose method. I reviewed a post that suggest using the CreateOutOfProcessRunspace of the RunspaceFactory but not sure how to use it. Here is how the issue can be reproduced: (System.Management.Automation dll referenced) for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++)
{
    var runspace = RunspaceFactory.CreateRunspace();
    runspace.Open();
    runspace.Close();
    runspace.Dispose();
}
 If you run this code, you will see how the memory is incremented. Due to the requirements, keeping a connection open as much as possible is not a good solution. Do you know how I can fix this issue, even using the CreateOutOfProcessRunspace method of the RunspaceFactory or how to propery dispose the memory? Thanks in advance EDIT I was using the V3 and change the runspace creation to use the CreateRunspacePool method and it looks like the leak is gone. Thanks so much for your help!

@CONTENT:I'm trying to write a macro which expands to a let form with destructuring. My problem is that I would like to have the list of the symbols that are defined in the let form, including those obtained by destruturing. Use case I'm trying to factor out this kind of behavior, for validation for example : (let [a (foo bar)
      {x :x,
       y :y,
       {u :u, v: v :as nested-map} :nested} some-map]
  (and x y nested-map u v ; testing truthiness

       (valid-y? y)
       (valid-nested? nested-map)
       (valid-u-and-v? u v)
       ))
 Proposed solution It would be really nice to achieve this through some sort of and-let macro which I could call like this: (and-let [a (foo bar)
          {x :x,
           y :y,
           {u :u, v: v :as nested-map} :nested} some-map]
         (valid-a? a)
         (valid-x? x)
         (valid-nested? nested-map)
         (valid-u-and-v? u v))
 What I'm missing But I'm missing some way of accessing the list of the symbols that are bound in the let form. If I had something like a list-bound-symbols function, I could do it like this : (defmacro and-let
  "Expands to an AND close that previouly checks that the values declared in bindings are truthy, followed by the tests."
  [bindings & tests]
  (let [bound-symbols (list-bound-symbols bindings) ;; what I'm missing

intent.setData(Uri.parse("tel:9898989898"));
startActivity(intent);
 This opens Intent Chooser if Skype is installed in phone. What i want is it should directly make call from default call application. How can i achieve this? Thanks in Advance.
@CODE:Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_CALL);                 
intent.setData(Uri.parse("tel:9898989898"));

@TITLE:search a path between two graph nodes in XQuery
@CONTENT:I'm trying to make an algorithm that searchs and returns a path between two nodes in a graph in xQuery, i've had no luck so far as it returns just one node and it's adyacent nodes. First i should make clear that the graph is a directed graph and every node can have zero, one or more origins, in the XML a node only has the link to it's origin but not to it's following nodes Here's an example of some nodes and their XML <node>
  <id> 123-456-789</id>
  <name> something </name>
  <Links>
     <Link>
        <origin></origin>
     </Link>
  <Links>

 <node>
  <id> 245-678-901</id>
  <name> node 2</name>
  <Links>
     <Link>
        <origin> 123-456-789 </origin>
     </Link>

  <id> xxx-xxx-xxx</id>
  <name> node 3</name>

     <Link>
        <origin> 245-678-901</origin>
     </Link>
  <Links>
 From that XML i would like to get the path from node 1 to node 4 ( node1-> node2 -> node4) but whatever i try to do would just give me node1-node2 and node3 but not node4 another thing is that i want to select a path that is not direct, i mean, if i want the path between node5 and node7 but both node5 and node7 are directed towards node6 I've tried adapting this python code to xquery def BFS(graph,start,end,q):

temp_path = [start]

q.enqueue(temp_path)

while q.IsEmpty() == False:
    tmp_path = q.dequeue()
    last_node = tmp_path[len(tmp_path)-1]
    print tmp_path
    if last_node == end:
        print "VALID_PATH : ",tmp_path
    for link_node in graph[last_node]:
        if link_node not in tmp_path:
            new_path = []
            new_path = tmp_path + [link_node]
            q.enqueue(new_path)
 (code not mine, it belongs to it's rightful coder at this activestate page) here is what i've tried to do: declare function local:BFS($graph as element()* , $ini_node as element(Node)*, $end_node as element(Node)*) as element()*
{
    let $seq := $ini_node
    let $queue := ($seq)
    for $item in $queue
        return
            if ( count($queue) > 0) then
                let $seq := remove($queue, count($queue))
                let $last := $seq[last()] return if (deep-equal($last, $end_node)) then $seq
                else
                    for $node in $graph[contains(.,$graph/id[contains(.,$last/Links/Link/origin/text())])] (: what i've tried was to get the graph nodes which id is equal to the origins of the last node :)
                        return if(not(functx:is-node-in-sequence-deep-equal($node,$seq))) then
                            let $new_path:= ()

@CONTENT:I've read the official doc https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#int, but still confused. I've tried some command on my terminal, I find some rules, but still not quite clear about it. Hope someone with more knowledge about this can explain it further. Below are my examples and findings: int('0', base=1)

int('333', base=4)
63

int('353', base=4)
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 4:
 I find two rules here: the single string numbers must be smaller than the base number. the int() will return a number which equals (n)*(base^(n-1)) + (n-1)*(base^(n-2)) + ... + 1*(base^0) Are there any other hidden rules than this, and what kind of problem the base is designed to solve?

 Here my Procfile (btw: gunicorn seems to be a Unix "only" command and does not work for Windows; read here): web: gunicorn mytodo.wsgi
 The Heroku tutorial does not mention a setup.py file, but it seems that one is necessary, so I simply copied a template.... not my preferred solution, but I did not know what else to do. setup(
    name='mysite',
    version='0.1.0',
    install_requires=[],  # Don't put anything here, just use requirements.txt
    packages=['mysite'],
    package_dir={'mysite': 'src/mysite'},
)
 What could be going on: - The unicode error message could stem from the Procfile. Somewhere online I read that it has to be ASCII file, but I am not sure how to declare that as the Procfile has no file ending. - The setup.py file is wrong. Any help is appreciated. Thanks!

@TITLE:What's the difference between Spring Data MongoDB and Hibernate OGM for MongoDB?
@CONTENT:I have not used Spring Data before but I've used Hibernate ORM a number of times for MySQL based application. I just don't understand which framework to choose between the two for a MongoDB based application. I've tried searching for the answer but I can't find the answer which does a comparison between the two in a production environment. Has anyone found problems working with these two frameworks with MongoDB ?

@TITLE:Meteor.js - Check logged in status before render
@CONTENT:First off lets just start with the fact that I am a complete noob with Meteor. Now that that is out of the way let the problem begin... I have two pages, a splash page at '/' and a home page at '/home'. I am using iron-router for the routing. Now If I am not logged in and on the splash page and login I have it redirecting to the home page this works. Now if I close my browser and reopen and goto the '/' it loads for a few seconds then realizes that I am actually still logged in and then redirects me to '/home'. My question is how to I get rid of this initial showing on the '/' when I am already logged in? I only want to show that page to people not signed in. Here is the code that I have in my router:     Router.configure({layoutTemplate: 'mainLayout'});

Router.map(function() {
  this.route('splash', {path: '/'});
  this.route('home');
});

var mustBeSignedIn = function(pause) {
  if (!(Meteor.user() || Meteor.loggingIn())) {
    Router.go('splash');
    pause();
  }
};

var goToDashboard = function(pause) {
  if (Meteor.user()) {
    Router.go('home');
    pause();
  }
};

Router.onBeforeAction(mustBeSignedIn, {except: ['splash']});
Router.onBeforeAction(goToDashboard, {only: ['splash']});
 Hope this helps.

@TITLE:Grunt build not exposing the globals I need
@CONTENT:When I run my project locally with my grunt:server task, the project works as I expect. However, after building which takes all the vendor code and puts it into one file, two of my needed module aren't avialable, and the project doesn't work. Here is my requirejs configuration: requirejs.config
  baseUrl: './js'
  shim:
    'underscore':
      exports: '_'
    'backbone':
      deps: ['underscore', 'jquery']
      exports: 'Backbone'

    'd3.global': '../components/d3.global/d3.global'
    'stack': '../components/stack/stack'
    'highlight': '../components/highlightjs/highlight.pack'

require ['app/vendors'],->
  console.log("Backbone", Backbone)
  console.log("_", _)
  console.log("$", $)
  console.log("d3", d3)
  console.log("stack", stack)
  console.log("hljs", hljs)
 app/vendors looks like define [
  'underscore'
  'jquery'
  'backbone'
  'text'
  'd3.global'
  'stack'
  'highlight'
], ->
 When I run the project locally via grunt, I see all the globals printed out. However, when I build the project, Backbone Underscore and JQuery print out, while stack fails (hljs is also not available, and if I remove stack from app/vendors, it doesn't fix highlight, so its probably not an order thing). the requirejs optimizer is called with the following configuration: requirejs:
  compile:
    options:
      baseUrl: 'js/'
      appDir: './<%= yeoman.tmp_dist %>/'
      dir: './<%= yeoman.dist %>/'

      wrap: true

      removeCombined: true
      keepBuildDir: true

      inlineText: true
      mainConfigFile: '<%= yeoman.tmp_dist %>/js/main.js'

      # no minification, is done by the min task

        { name: 'app/app', exclude: ['app/vendors'] }
        { name: 'main', exclude: ['app/app', 'app/vendors'] }
 Could there be something wrong with the stack and highlight files that I need to fix in order to make requirejs optimization and uglify work with them? I installed highlightjs via bower by adding "highlightjs": "~8.0" to my bower.json file and running bower install. I downloaded stack.js from mbostock's stack project. I'm using v0 at the moment, with minor changes to make it work in this project. The source for all these are in the components directory of my github project. BOUNTY If anyone is willing to clone the repo themselves, and try running the project with grunt server and grunt build to help me track down the problem, I'd greatly appreciate it. At the moment I have the vendor scripts in the github repo itself, so all you should need is compass and bower to run it.

@CONTENT:Keeping stacktrace out of it, lets say that the idea of 'error' is a problem that you didn't want to occur, but did. String[] array = new String[10];
int i = 0;
 If I were to use a boolean system to check if the action successfully completed, it would look something like this: public boolean accessValue(int id) {
     if(id < array.length) {
          //do something
          return true;

     return false;
}

while(true) {
     if(!accessValue(i++)) {
          //tend to situation
     }

}

public boolean accessValue(int id) throws InvalidAccessException {
     if(!id < array.length || !id >= 0) 
          throw new InvalidAccessException();

@TITLE:Is HyperThreading / SMT a flawed concept?
@CONTENT:The primary idea behind HT/SMT was that when one thread stalls, another thread on the same core can co-opt the rest of that core's idle time and run with it, transparently. In 2013 Intel dropped SMT in favor of out-of-order execution for its Silvermont processor cores, as they found this gave better performance. ARM no longer support SMT (for energy reasons). AMD never supported it. In the wild, we still have various processors that support it. From my perspective, if data and algorithms are built to avoid cache misses and subsequent processing stalls at all costs, surely HT is a redundant factor in multi-core systems? While I appreciate that there is low overhead to the context-switching involved since the two HyperThreads' discrete hardware exists within the same physical core, I cannot see that this is better than no context switching at all. I'm suggesting that any need for HyperThreading points to flawed software design. Is there anything I am missing here?

@CONTENT:I have a windows service that is doing a lot of exchange remote calls to get some server information. I noticed that as longs as the time passes the memory used by the service starts growing until a memory exception is thrown. I have searched and it looks like there is a known memory leak in the System.Management.Automation that does not dispose all the memory of the Runspace created while calling the close and/or dispose method. I reviewed a post that suggest using the CreateOutOfProcessRunspace of the RunspaceFactory but not sure how to use it. Here is how the issue can be reproduced: (System.Management.Automation dll referenced) for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++)
{
    var runspace = RunspaceFactory.CreateRunspace();
    runspace.Open();
    runspace.Close();
    runspace.Dispose();
}
 If you run this code, you will see how the memory is incremented. Due to the requirements, keeping a connection open as much as possible is not a good solution. Do you know how I can fix this issue, even using the CreateOutOfProcessRunspace method of the RunspaceFactory or how to propery dispose the memory? Thanks in advance EDIT I was using the V3 and change the runspace creation to use the CreateRunspacePool method and it looks like the leak is gone. Thanks so much for your help!

       (valid-nested? nested-map)
       (valid-u-and-v? u v)
       ))
 Proposed solution It would be really nice to achieve this through some sort of and-let macro which I could call like this: (and-let [a (foo bar)
          {x :x,
           y :y,
           {u :u, v: v :as nested-map} :nested} some-map]
         (valid-a? a)
         (valid-x? x)
         (valid-nested? nested-map)
         (valid-u-and-v? u v))
 What I'm missing But I'm missing some way of accessing the list of the symbols that are bound in the let form. If I had something like a list-bound-symbols function, I could do it like this : (defmacro and-let
  "Expands to an AND close that previouly checks that the values declared in bindings are truthy, followed by the tests."
  [bindings & tests]
  (let [bound-symbols (list-bound-symbols bindings) ;; what I'm missing
        ]
    `(let ~bindings
       (and 
         ~@bound-symbols
         ~@tests)
     ))) 
 Has anyone got a clue how I might do this?
@CODE:(let [a (foo bar)
      {x :x,
       y :y,
       {u :u, v: v :as nested-map} :nested} some-map]
  (and x y nested-map u v ; testing truthiness
       (valid-a? a)
       (valid-x? x)
       (valid-y? y)
       (valid-nested? nested-map)
       (valid-u-and-v? u v)
       )) and-let (and-let [a (foo bar)
          {x :x,
           y :y,
           {u :u, v: v :as nested-map} :nested} some-map]
         (valid-a? a)
         (valid-x? x)
         (valid-nested? nested-map)
         (valid-u-and-v? u v)) list-bound-symbols (defmacro and-let
  "Expands to an AND close that previouly checks that the values declared in bindings are truthy, followed by the tests."
  [bindings & tests]
  (let [bound-symbols (list-bound-symbols bindings) ;; what I'm missing
        ]
    `(let ~bindings
       (and 
         ~@bound-symbols
         ~@tests)
     )))

@TITLE:search a path between two graph nodes in XQuery
@CONTENT:I'm trying to make an algorithm that searchs and returns a path between two nodes in a graph in xQuery, i've had no luck so far as it returns just one node and it's adyacent nodes. First i should make clear that the graph is a directed graph and every node can have zero, one or more origins, in the XML a node only has the link to it's origin but not to it's following nodes Here's an example of some nodes and their XML <node>
  <id> 123-456-789</id>
  <name> something </name>
  <Links>
     <Link>
        <origin></origin>

 From that XML i would like to get the path from node 1 to node 4 ( node1-> node2 -> node4) but whatever i try to do would just give me node1-node2 and node3 but not node4 another thing is that i want to select a path that is not direct, i mean, if i want the path between node5 and node7 but both node5 and node7 are directed towards node6 I've tried adapting this python code to xquery def BFS(graph,start,end,q):

temp_path = [start]

q.enqueue(temp_path)

while q.IsEmpty() == False:
    tmp_path = q.dequeue()
    last_node = tmp_path[len(tmp_path)-1]
    print tmp_path
    if last_node == end:
        print "VALID_PATH : ",tmp_path
    for link_node in graph[last_node]:
        if link_node not in tmp_path:
            new_path = []
            new_path = tmp_path + [link_node]
            q.enqueue(new_path)

 I find two rules here: the single string numbers must be smaller than the base number. the int() will return a number which equals (n)*(base^(n-1)) + (n-1)*(base^(n-2)) + ... + 1*(base^0) Are there any other hidden rules than this, and what kind of problem the base is designed to solve?

 The Heroku tutorial does not mention a setup.py file, but it seems that one is necessary, so I simply copied a template.... not my preferred solution, but I did not know what else to do. setup(

 What could be going on: - The unicode error message could stem from the Procfile. Somewhere online I read that it has to be ASCII file, but I am not sure how to declare that as the Procfile has no file ending. - The setup.py file is wrong. Any help is appreciated. Thanks!

@TITLE:Meteor.js - Check logged in status before render
@CONTENT:First off lets just start with the fact that I am a complete noob with Meteor. Now that that is out of the way let the problem begin... I have two pages, a splash page at '/' and a home page at '/home'. I am using iron-router for the routing. Now If I am not logged in and on the splash page and login I have it redirecting to the home page this works. Now if I close my browser and reopen and goto the '/' it loads for a few seconds then realizes that I am actually still logged in and then redirects me to '/home'. My question is how to I get rid of this initial showing on the '/' when I am already logged in? I only want to show that page to people not signed in. Here is the code that I have in my router:     Router.configure({layoutTemplate: 'mainLayout'});

Router.map(function() {
  this.route('splash', {path: '/'});
  this.route('home');
});

var mustBeSignedIn = function(pause) {
  if (!(Meteor.user() || Meteor.loggingIn())) {
    Router.go('splash');
    pause();
  }
};

var goToDashboard = function(pause) {
  if (Meteor.user()) {
    Router.go('home');
    pause();
  }
};

Router.onBeforeAction(mustBeSignedIn, {except: ['splash']});
Router.onBeforeAction(goToDashboard, {only: ['splash']});
 Hope this helps.

 I can do pip search django-, but there is a huge amount of packages that I'm not interested in. Does pip provide a way to find packages by a regex?

@TITLE:Grunt build not exposing the globals I need
@CONTENT:When I run my project locally with my grunt:server task, the project works as I expect. However, after building which takes all the vendor code and puts it into one file, two of my needed module aren't avialable, and the project doesn't work. Here is my requirejs configuration: requirejs.config
  baseUrl: './js'
  shim:
    'underscore':
      exports: '_'
    'backbone':
      deps: ['underscore', 'jquery']
      exports: 'Backbone'
    'stack':
      deps: ['d3.global']
      exports: 'stack'
    'highlight':
      exports: 'hljs'

    'underscore': '../components/underscore/underscore'
    'backbone': '../components/backbone/backbone'

    'd3': '../components/d3/d3'
    'd3.global': '../components/d3.global/d3.global'
    'stack': '../components/stack/stack'
    'highlight': '../components/highlightjs/highlight.pack'

require ['app/vendors'],->
  console.log("Backbone", Backbone)
  console.log("_", _)
  console.log("$", $)
  console.log("d3", d3)
  console.log("stack", stack)
  console.log("hljs", hljs)
 app/vendors looks like define [
  'underscore'
  'jquery'
  'backbone'
  'text'
  'd3.global'
  'stack'
  'highlight'
], ->
 When I run the project locally via grunt, I see all the globals printed out. However, when I build the project, Backbone Underscore and JQuery print out, while stack fails (hljs is also not available, and if I remove stack from app/vendors, it doesn't fix highlight, so its probably not an order thing). the requirejs optimizer is called with the following configuration: requirejs:
  compile:
    options:
      baseUrl: 'js/'
      appDir: './<%= yeoman.tmp_dist %>/'
      dir: './<%= yeoman.dist %>/'

      wrap: true

      removeCombined: true
      keepBuildDir: true

      inlineText: true
      mainConfigFile: '<%= yeoman.tmp_dist %>/js/main.js'

      # no minification, is done by the min task
      optimize: "none"

      modules: [
        { name: 'app/vendors', exclude: [] }
        { name: 'app/app', exclude: ['app/vendors'] }
        { name: 'main', exclude: ['app/app', 'app/vendors'] }
 Could there be something wrong with the stack and highlight files that I need to fix in order to make requirejs optimization and uglify work with them? I installed highlightjs via bower by adding "highlightjs": "~8.0" to my bower.json file and running bower install. I downloaded stack.js from mbostock's stack project. I'm using v0 at the moment, with minor changes to make it work in this project. The source for all these are in the components directory of my github project. BOUNTY If anyone is willing to clone the repo themselves, and try running the project with grunt server and grunt build to help me track down the problem, I'd greatly appreciate it. At the moment I have the vendor scripts in the github repo itself, so all you should need is compass and bower to run it.

@CONTENT:Keeping stacktrace out of it, lets say that the idea of 'error' is a problem that you didn't want to occur, but did. String[] array = new String[10];
int i = 0;
 If I were to use a boolean system to check if the action successfully completed, it would look something like this: public boolean accessValue(int id) {
     if(id < array.length) {
          //do something
          return true;
     }
     return false;
}

while(true) {
     if(!accessValue(i++)) {
          //tend to situation
     }
}
 If I were to use Exceptions, it would look like this: class InvalidAccessException extends Throwable {

}

public boolean accessValue(int id) throws InvalidAccessException {
     if(!id < array.length || !id >= 0) 
          throw new InvalidAccessException();

          //tend to situation
     }

@TITLE:Is HyperThreading / SMT a flawed concept?
@CONTENT:The primary idea behind HT/SMT was that when one thread stalls, another thread on the same core can co-opt the rest of that core's idle time and run with it, transparently. In 2013 Intel dropped SMT in favor of out-of-order execution for its Silvermont processor cores, as they found this gave better performance. ARM no longer support SMT (for energy reasons). AMD never supported it. In the wild, we still have various processors that support it. From my perspective, if data and algorithms are built to avoid cache misses and subsequent processing stalls at all costs, surely HT is a redundant factor in multi-core systems? While I appreciate that there is low overhead to the context-switching involved since the two HyperThreads' discrete hardware exists within the same physical core, I cannot see that this is better than no context switching at all. I'm suggesting that any need for HyperThreading points to flawed software design. Is there anything I am missing here?

@TITLE:How can I make an animation with contourf()?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to animate the wigner function of the spatial coordinates of some time-dependent data. The wigner function is 2 dimensional, so I'm using contourf() to plot it. I have the data stored in a HDF5 file and can make Wigner distributions on the fly, but I can't figure out how to animate it. All of the animation tutorials and examples I've been able to find (for example this one and this one) are strictly for line plots. Specifically, their animate(i) function uses line.set_data(), and I can't seem to find an equivalent for contourf(). How can I animate images made with contourf()? What's the contourf() equivalent of set_data()?

@LINK:/questions/23041356/corrupted-resource-cpp-file-when-using-qt5-add-resources-and-multithread-compil
@TITLE:Corrupted resource .cpp file when using QT5_ADD_RESOURCES and multithread compiling with CMake
@CONTENT:The 5.0 release of Qt has brought a set of easier commands to build Qt projects using CMake. See http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5/cmake-manual.html. Resources for a project need to be included using the command QT5_ADD_RESOURCES. If my resource file is named for instance Icon32.qrc, the QT5_ADD_RESOURCES(RESOURCES Icon32.qrc) command will automatically convert it into a qrc_Icon32.cpp file and define a ${RESOURCES} variable that I will then be able to include into the proper targets. Doing this works perfectly, except that I get a compilation error in CDash roughly once every 20 builds. The error is typically of the following form: /.../CMake/build/qrc_Icon32.cpp:272380:1: error: unknown type name 'qCleanupResources_Icon32'
 What is happening is that a variable portion of the last line of the qrc_Icon32.cpp file is repeated after what should normally the end of file, thus creating one last nonsensical line for the compiler. Logging what CMake does, it seems that the behavior of QT5_ADD_RESOURCES is the following: whenever it reaches a project that requires the resources in question, it executes a depend make file that is specific to the compilation target but that still would write the qrc_Icon32.cpp at the root of the build directory, and this for all targets. So if two targets are being compiled in parallel, two invocations of rcc could be writing into the same file at the same time, hence the corruption. I have not found any report/discussion of this issue/feature on the web so I am wondering if I might have missed something: Is there a way to tell CMake to save the generated qrc_Icon32.cpp in a different location for each target? Better yet, is it possible to tell CMake to call rcc only once from its main make file so that qrc_Icon32.cpp is later available for all targets? I guess a workaround would be to create a static library that would be the only one using ${RESOURCES} and then to link that library into all targets. But still, I think CMake ought to be able to manage its dependencies properly when compiling with the multithreading -j flag. To reproduce the issue, in an empty folder, create a CMakeList.txt containing the following CMAKE_MINIMUM_REQUIRED(VERSION 2.8.11)
PROJECT(SSCCE CXX)

 Then Main1.cpp and Main2.cpp are created using #include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
        std::cout<<"Hello World 1"<<std::endl;
        return 0;
}
 The qrc file is <RCC>
    <qresource prefix="/">
        <file>Icon32/YourImage.png</file>
    </qresource>
</RCC>
 Then create a folder named Icon32 and add a png image of your choice name YourImage.png. Finally, create a build directory, enter it and run: cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++-4.8 -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS='-std=c++11 -fPIE' ..

 You can see that qrc_Icon32.cpp is created twice at about the same time, at the root of the build directory. The qrc_Icon32.cpp.o files though are properly created in the FirstTarget.dir and SecondTarget.dir so there are no conflicts. My point is that either: 1) qrc_Icon32.cpp should be created in FirstTarget.dir and SecondTarget.dir as well or 2) it should be created at the root of the build directory, but only once for all targets.

The only thing is left to change bundle id, which is not desirable in my case. Hopefully someone knows alternative ways how to get rid of unfinished transaction.

@CONTENT:I have developed a REST API with sailsjs and I'd like to add OAuth2 authorization to secure this API. I'm quite new to OAuth and I'm not sure where to start. I found several modules that could be used for this purposes, for instance oauth2orize and an example of its usage https://github.com/aaron524/sails-oauth2-provider-example but I do not fully understand how this is working internally. Basically, I'll have several clients consuming the API I'm developing: - clients that I trust and that I'd like to use with the "Resource Owner Credential Authorization" - clients that I do not trust and that will connect using the Authorization Code flow I was thinking of adding a trusted property to the Client model within the sails application and then when a user will log onto an application: - he will have a direct access to its resources (case of the trusted application) - he will be requested to approve or deny the application from accessing his resources (case of the untrusted application) Is this a good approach ? Any pointers on how to select the corresponding strategy based on the client trusted level ? UPDATE I've setup the following project on GitHub, using several tutorial and projects I found. https://github.com/lucj/sails-oauth2-api  
 This project is not functional yet. I'm still not clear on how to select the correct grant type (authorization code vs resource owner's password) when the user consume the API through an application. How to integrate this check in the policies ? I do not manage to create the link between the OAuth endPoint (/oauth/authorize, /oauth/token) and the call to oauth2orize. Any idea ?

@TITLE:rails secret_key_base not being recognized in production
@CONTENT:So I am trying to deploy my rails app in production. When I go to the page I get a 500 error. When I go to my error logs I get the following error: Exception RuntimeError in Rack application object (Missing `secret_key_base` for 'production' environment, set this value in `config/secrets.yml`) 
 I am running Rails 4.1 and my config/secrets.yml looks like this:     development:
      secret_key_base: <development key>        
    test:
      secret_key_base: <test key>

    # Do not keep production secrets in the repository,
    # instead read values from the environment.
    production:
      secret_key_base: <%= ENV["SECRET_KEY_BASE"] %>
 I ran rake secret to get the key and put the export in my bash_profile and sourced it. I ran rake assets:precompile successfully. Yet I still keep getting this error. Any ideas? Update: I tried to update the error message provided to give slightly better information....and the message didn't update. I then tried adding the key directly to the yml file instead of using an environment variable and still no dice. Im running on hostmonster so I can't restart the server.....but something is telling me thats what needs to be done... Update 2: After sleeping through the night it seems that this issue is no longer an issue. It must have been some sort of caching. Now my issue is that its trying to use an old config that i changed days ago for my database. If I figure out how to nullify the cache I will post it here and mark it as an answer. If someone else knows how to do it please let me know and I will mark it as an answer. I am using HostMonster as my hosting and followed the steps they have on their site for hosting my rails app.
@CODE:Exception RuntimeError in Rack application object (Missing `secret_key_base` for 'production' environment, set this value in `config/secrets.yml`) development:

@TITLE:How to call fragment from an activity in android?
@CONTENT:I am working on android fragments. In my app I am getting an issue with activity and fragment. i.e I created a button in fragment1 and called an activity1 in that button click. Again in activity1 I created another button and called activity2. Now from activity2 I called activity1 and from activity1 I am trying to call fragment1. But it is showing error at id(can anyone tell me which id we need to give). I researched in google on how to call fragment from activity but I didnt find any solution for this. Please help me out with this issue. Thanks in advance. My code: Activity1.class public void back(View v) {

 MyFragment1 fragmentS1 = new MyFragment1();
 getFragmentManager().beginTransaction().replace(android.R.id.frame_container, fragmentS1).commit();

}

 I can build the solution, and the web application works as expected, but I keep getting this error in the IDE and it's very annoying. I spent the entire day trying to solve this issue. Can someone please tell me how to fix it? Edit: When everything works well, when I navigate to definition (F12) of the ViewBag, I get the Assembly System.Web.Mvc.dll, v5.1.0.0 from Recipes.Web\Bin\System.Web.Mvc.dll and there are 4 using statements, one of which is System.Runtime.CompilerServices. When the error appears, when I navigate to definition (F12) of the ViewBag, I get the same Assembly System.Web.Mvc.dll, v5.1.0.0 from Recipes.Web\Bin\System.Web.Mvc.dll, BUT there are only 3 using statements, System.Runtime.CompilerServices is gone. Sometimes, the error doesn't appear, but if I close the solution and Visual Studio then reopen the solution, the error appears again. I don't even rebuild or do anything else. Why is this happening?

@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: Can I use break to exit multiple nested for loops? 14 answers I have really simple code where I use break inside inner loop: for (int it=0; it<5; it++) {
    for (int it2=0; it2<5; it2++) {
        if (it2==2) 
            break; //break here not it2, but it loop

 I receive an output: it=0 it2=0, it=0 it2=1,

it=2 it2=0, it=2 it2=1,
it=3 it2=0, it=3 it2=1,
it=4 it2=0, it=4 it2=1
 I know in some programic languages there is possibility to determine on which loop break statement should affect. Is it possible to call break to stop outer loop (for with it variable)?

 Which shows that yes this route does exist. My routes file for this engine looks like: Xaaron::Engine.routes.draw do

      resources :users
      resources :api_keys
      resources :sessions
      resources :roles
      resources :password_resets
end
 What am I missing? update For those of you curious how I am getting these routes, its because the dummy app's routes file is set up (by default) as such: Rails.application.routes.draw do

  mount Xaaron::Engine => "/xaaron"
end
 Update II I have been reading this api docs on how routing is done in engines and I believe the way I have done this is correct, how ever the controller is defined as such: module Xaaron
  class ApiKeysController < ActionController::Base
    before_action :authenticate_user!

      @api_key = Xaaron::ApiKey.where(:user_id => current_user.id)

      Xaaron::ApiKey.find(params[:id]).destroy
      flash[:notice] = 'Api Key has been deleted.'
      redirect_to xarron.api_keys_path

The problem is, the user has the ability to change the timezone, but even if the system timezone is changed, the java program keeps running with the "old" timezone. I suspect that the Java VM sets as default the timezone when the java program is run (the javadoc for Timezone.setDefault() says "reset the default to the value it had originally when the VM first started.") Is that true? Java can't update the default timezone to the new system timezone and therefore requires a restart of the VM?

 In my tests the first methods looks faster, but my main problem is in both ways at first everythings goes fine, for every file writing operation it tooks almost the same time (like 20 milliseconds), but after the 250 - 300th package it starts to make some peaks like 150 to 300 milliseconds and then goes down to 20 milliseconds and then again 150 ms and so on... So it becomes very unpredictable. When I put some timers to the code I figured out that the main reason for these peaks are because of the fout.open(...) and pfile = fopen(...) lines. I have no idea if this is because of the operating system, hard drive, any kind of cache or buffer mechanism etc... So the question is; why these file opening lines become problematic after some time, and is there a way to make file writing operation stable, I mean fixed time? Thanks. NOTE: I'm using Visual studio 2008 vc++, Windows 7 x64. (I tried also for 32 bit configuration but the result is same) EDIT: After some point writing speed slows down as well even if the opening file time is minimum. I tried with different package sizes so here are the results: For 2 MB packages it takes double time to slow down, I mean after ~ 600th item slowing down begins For 4 MB packages almost 300th item For 8 MB packages almost 150th item So it seems to me it is some sort of caching problem or something? (in hard drive or OS). But I also tried with disabling hard drive cache but nothing changed... Any idea?

@LINK:/questions/22745653/overriding-inversedby-mapping-in-doctrine-2-inheritance
@TITLE:Overriding inversedBy mapping in Doctrine 2 inheritance
@CONTENT:I have the following entity: class Restaurant
{
    /**
     * @OneToMany(targetEntity="CollectionTime", mappedBy="restaurant")
     */
    protected $collectionTimes;

    /**
     * @OneToMany(targetEntity="DeliveryTime", mappedBy="restaurant")
     */
    protected $deliveryTimes;
}
 Mapping to two subclasses of the same entity: /**
 * @Entity
 * @InheritanceType("SINGLE_TABLE")
 * @ORM\DiscriminatorMap({
 *   "CollectionTime" = "CollectionTime",
 *   "DeliveryTime"   = "DeliveryTime"
 * })
 */
abstract class OrderTime
{
    /**
     * @ManyToOne(targetEntity="Restaurant")
     */
    protected $restaurant;
}

/**
 * @Entity
 */
class CollectionTime extends OrderTime
{
}

/**
 * @Entity
 */
class DeliveryTime extends OrderTime
{
}
 Now the problem is, doctrine orm:validate-schema reports the following errors: The field Restaurant#collectionTimes is on the inverse side of a bi-directional relationship, but the specified mappedBy association on the target-entity CollectionTime#restaurant does not contain the required 'inversedBy=collectionTimes' attribute. The field Restaurant#deliveryTimes is on the inverse side of a bi-directional relationship, but the specified mappedBy association on the target-entity DeliveryTime#restaurant does not contain the required 'inversedBy=deliveryTimes' attribute. In short, Doctrine expects every mappedBy to have an inversedBy on the other side. The only solution I can see so far is to move the OrderTime::$restaurant property and mapping to CollectionTime and DeliveryTime, just to be able to add the proper inversedBy mapping: abstract class OrderTime
{
}

/**
 * @Entity
 */
class CollectionTime extends OrderTime
{
    /**
     * @ManyToOne(targetEntity="Restaurant", inversedBy="collectionTimes")
     */
    protected $restaurant;
}

/**
 * @Entity
 */
class DeliveryTime extends OrderTime
{
    /**
     * @ManyToOne(targetEntity="Restaurant", inversedBy="deliveryTimes")
     */
    protected $restaurant;
}
 But it is cumbersome and goes against the principle of inheritance. Is there a way to just override the inversedBy attribute in the subclasses, without having to (re)declare the whole property in the subclass? I've looked into @AssociationOverrides and @AttributeOverrides, but they don't seem to be designed for this purpose.
@CODE:class Restaurant
{
    /**
     * @OneToMany(targetEntity="CollectionTime", mappedBy="restaurant")
     */
    protected $collectionTimes;

    /**
     * @OneToMany(targetEntity="DeliveryTime", mappedBy="restaurant")
     */
    protected $deliveryTimes;
} /**
 * @Entity
 * @InheritanceType("SINGLE_TABLE")
 * @ORM\DiscriminatorMap({
 *   "CollectionTime" = "CollectionTime",
 *   "DeliveryTime"   = "DeliveryTime"
 * })
 */
abstract class OrderTime
{
    /**
     * @ManyToOne(targetEntity="Restaurant")
     */
    protected $restaurant;
}

/**
 * @Entity
 */
class CollectionTime extends OrderTime
{
}

/**

 */
class DeliveryTime extends OrderTime
{
} doctrine orm:validate-schema mappedBy inversedBy OrderTime::$restaurant CollectionTime DeliveryTime inversedBy abstract class OrderTime
{
}

/**

class CollectionTime extends OrderTime
{
    /**

@TITLE:How to use Jenkins pre-build branch merging only for branches I want to merge?
@CONTENT:I am reading https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Git+Plugin#GitPlugin-AdvancedFeatures which allows pre-builds of feature branches before pushing commits to the master branch, effectively implementing a pre-commit build/test queue. It says under Using Git, Jenkins and pre-build branch merging: Set up your Jenkins project, and leave the 'branch' field in the Git SCM blank. This will cause Jenkins to consider any change on any branch for building. Next, pick a particular branch name as the integration target in the 'Advanced' section - (e.g. 'master', or 'stable'), and select 'Merge before build'. Select 'Push GIT tags back to origin repository' from the post-build actions (this is required to update your centralised git repo with the results of the build). Now, developers should never commit directly to your integration branch (the 'master' or 'stable'). Instead, they should either use feature branches, or create new remote branches on commit (e.g : "git push origin HEAD:refs/heads/myNewFeature"). You could also set up your GIT repository to only accept commits onto the integration branch from Jenkins. You're done. Commits should now be automatically merged with the integration branch (they will fail if they do not merge cleanly), and built. If the build succeeds, the result of the merge will be pushed back to the remote git repository. Now I often have feature branches that I would like to continue developing on, and only merge them into master later. As far as I understand, this setup will merge and push any feature branch into master as soon as it builds. (How) Can Jenkins support my use case, building all feature branches, but merging only those into master that I indend to be merged?

@LINK:/questions/22713780/why-is-generics-collections-tobjectlist-list-unsafe
@TITLE:Why is Generics.Collections.TObjectList.List unsafe?
@CONTENT:TList and TOjectList in Generics.Collections have a .List property, which is an enumerator. For instance: oList := TObjectList<TItem>.Create;
// Add items to oList
for Item in oList.List do begin
  // Do something with Item
end;
 This is neat, but has a drastic consequence. .List just reads FList (a private declaration on TList and TObjectList), which is merely an arrayofT. Since a dynamic array is doubled in size whenever an item is added beyond its size, it means it has space for non-used items. In case you have added 3 TItems, the actual FList is 4 items long, with the fourth (and last) item being nil. Thus using TObjectList's .List is unsafe, because it will likely throw an access violation, if your TObjectList doesn't have a .Count value with a power of 2 (e.g. 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.). The following code could likely throw an access violation: for Item in oList.List do begin
  Writeln(Item.ClassName);
end;
 Of course, the safe solution is a simple iteration using .Count: for I := 0 to oList.Count - 1 do begin
  Item := oList.Items[I];
  Writeln(Item.ClassName);
end;
 This is just not as pretty as the enumerator. (You can also check if Item is nil, of course.) My questions are thus: Why .List isn't an actual enumerator? And does TList/TObjectList have an actual enumerator? Here is an example from a TForm (where btn1 simply adds a line and mmo1 is a TMemo). procedure TForm2.btn1Click(Sender: TObject);
var
  Line: string;
begin
  Line := 'Line';
  mmo1.Lines.Add(Line);
  fList.Add(Line);
  mmo1.Lines.Add(Format('Count: %d; Actual length: %d', [fList.Count, Length(fList.List)]));
  for Line in fList.List do begin
    mmo1.Lines.Add(Format('Found: "%s"', [Line]));
  end;
end;
 Now, using string does not throw an access violation. But when I have clicked 3 times, I get the following: Count: 3; Actual length: 4
Found: "Line"
Found: "Line"
Found: "Line"
Found: ""
@CODE:TList TOjectList Generics.Collections .List oList := TObjectList<TItem>.Create;

@TITLE:Creating an MKMapSnapshotter with an MKPolylineRenderer
@CONTENT:I thought iOS 7's MKMapSnapshotters would be a simple way to take a snapshot of an MKMapView, the benefit is that you can do it without loading the map into view. Even though it seems like more work to add pins and overlays (because of the need for core graphics). The WWDC videos give a very good example of creating an MKMapSnapshotter with adding an MKAnnotationView. However, for someone with not a lot of core graphics experience it's not really obvious how you create an MKMapSnapshotter from an MKPolylineRenderer. I have tried to do this, but the path is inaccurate. It draws about 10% of the line accurately, but then draws the rest of the path straight. Here's my code: MKMapSnapshotter *snapshotter = [[MKMapSnapshotter alloc] initWithOptions:snapshotOptions];

[snapshotter startWithQueue:dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0)
          completionHandler:^(MKMapSnapshot *snapshot, NSError *error)
{
            if (error == nil)
            {
                UIImage *mapSnapshot = [snapshot image];

                UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptions(mapSnapshot.size,
                                                       YES,
                                                       mapSnapshot.scale);

                [mapSnapshot drawAtPoint:CGPointMake(0.0f, 0.0f)];

                CGContextRef context = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext();

                //Draw the points from the MKPolylineRenderer in core graphics for mapsnapshotter...
                MKPolylineRenderer *overlay = (MKPolylineRenderer *)[self.mapView rendererForOverlay:[_mapView.overlays lastObject]];

                if (overlay.path)
                {
                    CGFloat zoomScale = 3.0;

                    [overlay applyStrokePropertiesToContext:context
                                                atZoomScale:zoomScale];

                    CGContextAddPath(context, overlay.path);
                    CGContextSetLineJoin(context, kCGLineJoinRound);
                    CGContextSetLineCap(context, kCGLineCapRound);
                    CGContextStrokePath(context);
                }

                UIImage *pathImage = UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext();

                [map addMapIcon:pathImage];
                UIGraphicsEndImageContext();
            }
}];
 Does anyone have a good workable example on how to do this please?

@CONTENT:Are there any real pitfalls in using single process mode in production? The official statement seems to discourage this, but so far the application has been stable. CEF1 seems to have been abandoned, and if CEF3 single process is used for dev, then the latter should be at the very least be part of the test suite, and therefore stable. Or is that not true? Also, is CEF3 single process not equivalent to CEF1? The new Battle.net launcher is using CEFl (1453). I wonder if that was for legacy reasons or if that was a conscious decision to avoid using CEF3.

@TITLE:JavaScript promise confusion
@CONTENT:I'm trying to grasp the concept of javascript promise. But I'm getting some problems. I set up a very small web service locally(don't get angry, the web service does not conform to conventions). Here some details about it /login/<username>/<password> ==> login into the system, the correct username and password is both noor if user is login, a call can be made on /car/<brand>/<color>/<plate_number>, I'm not performing any validation on the type of color,brand,platenumber This one works perfectly fine, I'm logging and adding a car $.ajax({type: "GET",url: url+"/login/noor/noor"})
                .then(function( data, textStatus, jqXHR ) {console.log("login success");},function(){console.log("login error");})
                .then($.ajax({type: "GET",url: url+"/car/1/1/1"}))
                .then(function(){console.log("car added");},function(){console.log("car not added");});
 This one perfectly shows an error because an invalid url is used: $.ajax({type: "GET",url: url+"/carasdsad/1/1/1"})
                .then(function(){console.log("car added");},function(){console.log("car not added");});
 "/carasdsad/1/1/1" is an invalid url and car not added is returned I'm getting a problem with this one. The code below uses the code just above. I was expecting car not added to be shown but its showing car added $.ajax({type: "GET",url: url+"/login/noor/noor"})
                .then(function( data, textStatus, jqXHR ) {console.log("login success");},function(){console.log("login error");})
                .then($.ajax({type: "GET",url: url+"/carasdsad/1/1/1"}))
                .then(function(){console.log("car added");},function(){console.log("car not added");});
 The above code is returning car added although "/carasdsad/1/1/1" is an invalid url in the second call.
@CODE:/login/<username>/<password> /car/<brand>/<color>/<plate_number> $.ajax({type: "GET",url: url+"/login/noor/noor"})

                .then(function(){console.log("car added");},function(){console.log("car not added");}); $.ajax({type: "GET",url: url+"/carasdsad/1/1/1"})

@TITLE:how exactly does http.sys work
@CONTENT:I'm trying to get a deeper understanding of how IIS works. http.sys i understand is one its major components. However, i have been having trouble finding easily digestible information about it. I couldn't get a good mental model going until i heard about the WSK, then i think it all fell into place. From a lot of random googling a little experimentation this is my current high level understanding of why it exists and how it does it's stuff. Why: Port sharing, and higher performance caching. How: User mode processes use the WinSock api to open a socket listening on a port to gain access to the networking subsystem, e.g. tcp/ip. Kernal mode software like the http.sys driver uses Winsock Kernal Sockets (WSK) api to achieve the same end using the same pool of TCP port numbers as the WinSock api. IIS, a web service or anything that wants to use http registers itself with http.sys using a unique url/port combination. http.sys opens up a socket on this port using WSK (if it hasn't already for another url/port combination with the same port) and listens. When the transport layer (tcpip.sys) has reconstructed a load of ip packets back into an http request that a client sent it gives it to http.sys via the port in the request. Http.sys uses the url/port number to send it the the appropriate process which parses it however it pleases. I know it seems like I'm answering my own question but I'm really not that sure of myself on this and would like some closure so i can get on with more interesting things. Am i close?

@TITLE:Where is javax.annotation
@CONTENT:Ok, so this is probably a NooB question (I'm more of a C++ guy), but I'm lost in the java woods and its frameworks forests... I'm trying to look into eclipse RCP development. For that I'm following this well-known tutorial: http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseRCP/article.html At step 15 I need to add the following dependency packages to import in my bundle. javax.annotation javax.injection The problem is that I cannot select these (they are not in the selection list) I do have javax.el javax.servlet.* and javax.xml.* Looking at http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/overview-summary.html suggests that this should be part of the standard java. What obvious mistake am I missing?

@TITLE:Menu button crashes application when has overflow actions on API 7
@CONTENT:I am trying to implement Action Bar for API 7 and above. I am using Android Studio to create a new simple project with the following configuration: - Minimum SDK: API 7 - Target SDK: API 14 - Compile: Google APIs 14 - Theme: Holo Light with Dark Action Bar - Set the Create Activity, Fragments, Navigation Drawer, Action Bar Then in the next screen I select Blank Activity On the last screen I select Navigation Drawer for additional features. I run the application on the Emulator with API 14 and everything is working fine. But when I run it on the Emulator with API 7 (also on a real device) it crash when I press the menu button. After doing some experiments I found that it only happens if there are overflow actions in the action bar. What am I missing? All the code is auto-generated by Android Studio (Some small modification for testing purposes) MainActivity.java package com.test.myapplication4.app;

@TITLE:libGDX - How to clip
@CONTENT:I have one SpriteBatch in my game, between whose batch.begin() and batch.end() I draw... a large static background image several game sprites I want to clip the area in which the sprites are seen, which I've read is done using ScissorStack. The problem is that ScissorStack appears to clip the entire SpriteBatch that's sent to the GPU. The result is that it clips my game sprites and the background image. Question: Must I have two separate batch.begin() and batch.end() cycles, one without clipping for the background, and another with clipping for the sprites? Or is there a way of clipping just the sprites without using ScissorStack? If the former, then isn't it rather expensive flushing the SpriteBatch twice as many times simply in order to clip a few sprites, or is it really nothing to worry about in terms of performance? Related question: The calculateScissors() method in the latest source code has more parameters than I've seen documented anywhere... calculateScissors(camera, viewportX, viewportY, viewportWidth, viewportHeight, batchTransform, area, scissor) What is the purpose of the viewportX, viewportY, viewportWidth, viewportHeight when they appear to be duplicating the camera's viewport and area information, and are not mentioned in any docs? Basically, I'm really confused... even after (or especially after!) testing the behaviour of different values for each of these parameters. Any advice sought.

 It looks very different in Windows 8 than it does in Windows 7. Now, the strange part is that in the DESIGNER, everything looks perfect on a Windows 8 machine as if it were Windows 7... But at runtime, the style isn't "applied." On the other hand, it looks perfect on Windows 7 in both the designer and runtime. Is there a way to fix this?

@TITLE:Any way to get OWIN to host a SOAP service?
@CONTENT:How do I get OWIN to host a SOAP endpoint (do not care if WCF is or isn't involved, SOAP gives WSDL which makes services easier to consume by certain clients, that's why I want SOAP and REST) I suspect the answer is: Implement your own middleware that hosts a SOAP endpoint. If that's the answer so be it, but that's a lot of work so I'll probably just end up sticking with WCF and avoiding OWIN if that's the case. I find it hard to believe no one has implemented a SOAP hosting middleware yet... As a rule we like to do both REST and SOAP endpoints on our services; currently we use IIS and the WCF restful bits to host the SOAP with [ServiceContract]/[OperationContract] attributes, and the rest is defined with [WebInvoke] attributes, with these attributes the services need no reimplementation for the different endpoint types. We just use the ASP.NET routes to add new ServiceRoutes which add a rest binding to URI/REST with the same service as a soap binding to URI/SOAP. Now we're looking at doing some new services work and I'd like to move forward to using OWIN so we can implement our new services with hosting agnosticism as some services will be better served by windows service hosting and some better served by IIS service hosting. All of my fiddling with things and so far I can come up with no way of getting a SOAP endpoint hosted by OWIN. I have the rest handled fine by making my service inherit from ApiController and then using this little snippet of code in the OWIN app's Configuration method:     public void Configuration(IAppBuilder app)
    {
        HttpConfiguration config = new HttpConfiguration();
        config.MapHttpAttributeRoutes();
        app.UseWebApi(config);
        [...]

 Is there any way (in angular) to add multiple options? The client now wants to have the first, default option say "Select from addresses", and have the Add New Address option shown above be the last option in the list, after all the populated options from ng-options. (I know I could use jQuery to add that option, but would rather keep it all angular if possible.)

 I attempt to run the following command to generate haddock documentation to no avail: sudo cabal install --reinstall --force-reinstalls --enable-documentation
 The command was from a similar question a user had on the haskell mailing list. http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/glasgow-haskell-users/2012-February/021780.html How do I appease ghc-pkg check and remove these warnings? CAVEAT: When I say "fresh install" I mean I have installed the Haskell-platform from scratch, and installed globally cabal-1.18.0.3and added cabal's bin directory to my path.

@LINK:/questions/22548545/how-can-i-add-jdt-as-a-maven-dependency
@TITLE:How can I add JDT as a Maven dependency?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to create a project that depends on JDT core. I was using the entries in Maven central until I realized they were several years out of date. After poking around a little, I came across https://repo.eclipse.org. I found the repository I needed and added it: <repository>
    <id>eclipse</id>
    <name>Eclipse Repository</name>
    <url>https://repo.eclipse.org/content/groups/eclipse/</url>
</repository>
...
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.eclipse.jdt</groupId>
    <artifactId>org.eclipse.jdt.core</artifactId>
    <version>3.10.0.v20140316-0146</version>
</dependency>
 But then I started getting an error: The type org.eclipse.core.runtime.IProgressMonitor cannot be resolved. It is indirectly referenced from required .class files I managed to find the type in one of the Nexus repositories and added it: <repository>
    <id>eclipse-acceleo</id>
    <name>Eclipse Repository</name>
    <url>https://repo.eclipse.org/content/groups/acceleo/</url>
</repository>
...
<dependency>

    <artifactId>org.eclipse.equinox.common</artifactId>
    <version>3.6.200.v20130402-1505</version>
</dependency>
 Now I'm getting the error The type org.eclipse.core.runtime.Plugin cannot be resolved. It is indirectly referenced from required .class files And I cannot find the class in any of the Nexus repositories. org.eclipse.jdt.core.JavaCore is the class referencing org.eclipse.core.runtime.Plugin. 1. Which dependency do I need to add to include org.eclipse.core.runtime.Plugin? 2. Is there a better way to include JDT as a dependency in Maven? /e1 I found org.eclipse.core.runtime.Plugin with the help of http://grepcode.com. This time, the up-to-date dependency is in Maven Central (and not in Eclipse's Nexus repo): <dependency>
    <groupId>org.eclipse.core</groupId>
    <artifactId>runtime</artifactId>
    <version>3.9.100-v20131218-1515</version>
</dependency>
 Now when I try to run my tests, I get the following exception all over the place: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/eclipse/core/resources/IResource

 At this point I'm considering downloading the complete JAR and adding it as a system dependency. Is there any better way to add JDT as a Maven dependency?

@LINK:/questions/22546007/how-can-i-tell-if-an-object-is-an-angular-q-promise
@TITLE:How can I tell if an object is an Angular $q promise?
@CONTENT:I have a pre-existing non-Angular API library in my project. It has a .request method which returns jQuery.Deferred promises. I created a simple Angular service which wraps the .request method to transform its result into an Angular $q promise instead. It looks something like this: var module = angular.module('example.api', []);

module.factory('api', function(
    $q,
    $window
) {
    function wrappedRequest() {
        var result = $window.API.request.apply($window.API, arguments);
        return $q.when(result);
    };

    return {
        request: wrappedRequest
    };
});
 I would like to write a test which ensures that this service is functioning correctly. It will provide a mock $window with an API whose request method returns jQuery.Deferred promises. I need to ensure that the resulting objects are Angular $q promises. How can I determine whether an object is an Angular $q promise? For the example given in this question it would be sufficient to distinguish between jQuery.Deferred promises and Angular $q promises, but ideally we could identify Angular $q promises in general.
@CODE:.request .request var module = angular.module('example.api', []);

module.factory('api', function(
    $q,
    $window
) {
    function wrappedRequest() {
        var result = $window.API.request.apply($window.API, arguments);
        return $q.when(result);
    };

    return {
        request: wrappedRequest
    };
}); $window API request

@LINK:/questions/22527979/common-controls-are-not-properly-painted-with-wm-ctlcolorstatic-handler-after-i
@TITLE:Common controls are not properly painted with WM_CTLCOLORSTATIC handler after I set Visual Styles on
@CONTENT:INTRODUCTION AND RELEVANT INFORMATION: I have 2 dialog boxes created via Resource editor. Since I use Microsoft Visual Studio Express edition, I had to download free resource editor to create them. In my program, I have Visual Styles enabled like this: #include <commctrl.h>

#pragma comment( lib, "comctl32.lib")

#pragma comment( linker, "/manifestdependency:\"type='win32' \
        name='Microsoft.Windows.Common-Controls' version='6.0.0.0' \
        processorArchitecture='*' publicKeyToken='6595b64144ccf1df' \
        language='*'\"")
 As far as I know, check box, radio button, and group box get WM_CTLCOLORSTATIC message for painting their text. This is what I have coded for the first and second dialog box: case WM_CTLCOLORSTATIC:
    {
        SetBkMode( (HDC)wParam, TRANSPARENT );
        SetTextColor( (HDC)wParam, RGB( 0, 0, 0 ) );
        return (INT_PTR)( (HBRUSH)GetStockObject(NULL_BRUSH) );
    }
 I want those controls to have transparent text background and black color of their text. THE PROBLEM: On Windows XP, here is the result image for first dialog: Group box has blue text, and brown border, while check box has everything black. On Windows 7, after starting the same program, I get this: Here, group box and check box have proper text color, yet background of the check box and the border of the group box are wrong. In my dialog box, I have static controls and they are painted properly both on Windows 7 and Windows XP. WHAT HAVE I TRIED SO FAR: I have browsed through SO archive, but haven't found anything I could use to modify my WM_CTLCOLORSTATIC handler. I have found a workaround which removes Visual Styles from those controls, so it can achieve the desired result, but I need to keep the Visual Styles and make the background of the text transparent, thus this solution can not satisfy me. After looking through Visual Styles reference and a little experimenting, I have found a workaround for radio button and check box ( but not for group box ) with the following code: case WM_CTLCOLORSTATIC:
    if( (HWND)lParam == GetDlgItem( hwnd, IDC_RADIO1 ) ) 
    {
        RECT r;
        GetClientRect( hwnd, &r );
        DrawThemeParentBackground( (HWND)lParam, (HDC)wParam, &r );
    }
    else
    {
        SetTextColor( (HDC)wParam, RGB( 0, 0, 0 ) );
        SetBkMode( (HDC)wParam, TRANSPARENT );
    }
    return (INT_PTR)( (HBRUSH)GetStockObject(NULL_BRUSH) );
 Still, I have "hit the wall" with this: In my dialog box there is a treeview and once I select node and press spacebar ( or any other key for that matter ) dialog's background bitmap gets on top of my static controls. After I comment out DrawThemeParentBackground(), recompile and start program again everything works fine ( when I select tree's node and press spacebar ) but then I am "at square one". THE QUESTIONS: How can I modify my WM_CTLCOLORSTATIC handler to fix my problem ? If the above is not possible, can I get the desired effect with NM_CUSTOMDRAW ? NOTE: I think that I will have to draw group box using GDI. If that is the case, I will accept this solution too, as my main concern is checkbox and radio button. EDITED WITH SUBMITTED EXAMPLE PROJECT: On request, I am submitting a SSCCE. To create the project follow these steps: 1.) Create default Win32 project in Visual Studio. 2.) In the stdafx.h copy/paste the following directives, below #include <windows.h>: #include <commctrl.h>
#include <Uxtheme.h>

#pragma comment( linker, "/manifestdependency:\"type='win32' \ 
                    name='Microsoft.Windows.Common-Controls' version='6.0.0.0' \
                    processorArchitecture='*' publicKeyToken='6595b64144ccf1df' \
                    language='*'\"")

#pragma comment( lib, "comctl32.lib")
#pragma comment( lib,"Msimg32.lib")    // needed for GradientFill(...) API
#pragma comment( lib, "UxTheme.lib")
 3.) In the resource editor, alter About dialog box by adding a 2 radio buttons, 2 checkboxes and a group box enclosing them ( see the above pictures too see what I mean ) and add a treeview control ( this control will "trigger" the problem ). 4.) In your main cpp file, add the helper function for drawing the custom background: void GradientTriangle( HDC MemDC, 
    LONG x1, LONG y1, 
    LONG x2, LONG y2, 
    LONG x3, LONG y3, 
    COLORREF top, COLORREF bottom )
{
    TRIVERTEX vertex[3];

    vertex[0].x     = x1;
    vertex[0].y     = y1;
    vertex[0].Red   = GetRValue(bottom) << 8;
    vertex[0].Green = GetGValue(bottom) << 8;
    vertex[0].Blue  = GetBValue(bottom) << 8;
    vertex[0].Alpha = 0x0000;

    vertex[1].x     = x3;
    vertex[1].y     = y3; 
    vertex[1].Red   = GetRValue(bottom) << 8;
    vertex[1].Green = GetGValue(bottom) << 8;
    vertex[1].Blue  = GetBValue(bottom) << 8;
    vertex[1].Alpha = 0x0000;

    vertex[2].x     = x2;
    vertex[2].y     = y2;
    vertex[2].Red   = GetRValue(top) << 8;
    vertex[2].Green = GetGValue(top) << 8;
    vertex[2].Blue  = GetBValue(top) << 8;
    vertex[2].Alpha = 0x0000;

    // Create a GRADIENT_TRIANGLE structure that
    // references the TRIVERTEX vertices.

    GRADIENT_TRIANGLE gTriangle;

    gTriangle.Vertex1 = 0;
    gTriangle.Vertex2 = 1;
    gTriangle.Vertex3 = 2;

    // Draw a shaded triangle.

    GradientFill( MemDC, vertex, 3, &gTriangle, 1, GRADIENT_FILL_TRIANGLE);
}
 5.) Initiate common controls in _tWinMain: // initialize common controls

INITCOMMONCONTROLSEX iccex;
iccex.dwSize = sizeof(INITCOMMONCONTROLSEX);
iccex.dwICC = ICC_LISTVIEW_CLASSES | ICC_UPDOWN_CLASS | ICC_STANDARD_CLASSES ;
InitCommonControlsEx(&iccex);
 6.) Insert some items in the treeview in the WM_INITDIALOG : case WM_INITDIALOG:
    {
        HWND TreeView = GetDlgItem( hDlg, IDC_TREE1 );

        // add root item

        TVINSERTSTRUCT tvis = {0};

        tvis.item.mask = TVIF_TEXT;
        tvis.item.pszText = L"This is root item";
        tvis.hInsertAfter = TVI_LAST;
        tvis.hParent = TVI_ROOT;

        HTREEITEM hRootItem = reinterpret_cast<HTREEITEM>( SendMessage( TreeView , 
            TVM_INSERTITEM, 0, reinterpret_cast<LPARAM>( &tvis ) ) );

        // add firts subitem for the hTreeItem

        memset( &tvis, 0, sizeof(TVINSERTSTRUCT) );

        tvis.item.mask = TVIF_TEXT;
        tvis.item.pszText = L"This is first subitem";
        tvis.hInsertAfter = TVI_LAST;
        tvis.hParent = hRootItem;

        HTREEITEM hTreeSubItem1 = reinterpret_cast<HTREEITEM>( SendMessage( TreeView , 
            TVM_INSERTITEM, 0, reinterpret_cast<LPARAM>( &tvis ) ) );

        // now we insert second subitem for hRootItem

        memset( &tvis, 0, sizeof(TVINSERTSTRUCT) );

        tvis.item.mask = TVIF_TEXT | TVIF_STATE; // added extra flag
        tvis.item.pszText = L"This is second subitem";
        tvis.hInsertAfter = TVI_LAST;
        tvis.hParent = hRootItem;

        HTREEITEM hTreeSubItem2 = reinterpret_cast<HTREEITEM>( SendMessage( TreeView , 
            TVM_INSERTITEM, 0, reinterpret_cast<LPARAM>( &tvis ) ) );
    }
    return (INT_PTR)TRUE;
 7.) Paint the custom background of the dialog: case WM_ERASEBKGND:
    {
        RECT r;
        GetClientRect( hDlg, &r );

        GradientTriangle( (HDC)wParam, r.right, r.bottom - r.top, 
            r.left, r.bottom - r.top,
            r.left, r.top,
            RGB( 0x0, 0x0, 0xFF ), RGB( 0xFF, 0xFF, 0x0 ) );

        GradientTriangle( (HDC)wParam, r.right, r.bottom - r.top, 
            r.right, r.top,
            r.left, r.top, 
            RGB( 0xFF, 0x0, 0x0 ), RGB( 0x0, 0xFF, 0x0 ) );
    }
    return TRUE;
 8.) Add the handler for WM_CTLCOLORSTATIC: case WM_CTLCOLORSTATIC:
    if( ( (HWND)lParam == GetDlgItem( hDlg, IDC_RADIO1 ) )       
        || ( (HWND)lParam == GetDlgItem( hDlg, IDC_CHECK1 ) ) ) 
    {
        RECT r;
        GetClientRect( hDlg, &r );
        DrawThemeParentBackground( (HWND)lParam, (HDC)wParam, &r );
    }
    else
    {
        SetTextColor( (HDC)wParam, RGB( 0, 0, 0 ) );
        SetBkMode( (HDC)wParam, TRANSPARENT );
    }
    return (INT_PTR)( (HBRUSH)GetStockObject(NULL_BRUSH) );
 That would be all required steps and information to create minimal program that demonstrates the problem. Now run the application and observe the differences: Radio button with IDC_RADIO1 and checkbox with IDC_CHECK1 will be properly painted ( transparent text with black color ), while other checkbox and radio button will not. Furthermore, after you click on a treeview and press spacebar you will see the problem with dialogs background. END OF EDIT Thank you. Best regards.

@TITLE:How do I load and use a CRF trained with Mallet?
@CONTENT:I've trained a CRF using GenericAcrfTui, it writes an ACRF to a file. I'm not quite sure how to load and use the trained CRF but import cc.mallet.grmm.learning.ACRF;
import cc.mallet.util.FileUtils;
ACRF c = (ACRF) FileUtils.readObject(Paths.get("acrf.ser.gz").toFile());
 seems to work. However, the labeling seems incorrect and seems to rely on the labels that I pass as input. How do I label using a loaded ACRF? Here's how I do my labeling: GenericAcrfData2TokenSequence instanceMaker = new GenericAcrfData2TokenSequence();
instanceMaker.setDataAlphabet(c.getInputAlphabet());
instanceMaker.setIncludeTokenText(true);
instanceMaker.setFeaturesIncludeToken(true);
instanceMaker.setLabelsAtEnd(false);
Pipe pipe = new SerialPipes(new Pipe[] {
        instanceMaker,
        new TokenSequence2FeatureVectorSequence(c.getInputAlphabet(),
                true, false),
});
InstanceList testing = new InstanceList(pipe);
Iterator<Instance> testSource = new LineGroupIterator(
    // initialize the labels to O
        new StringReader("O O ---- what W=the@1 W=hell@2\n"
                    + "O O ---- the W=what@-1 W=hell@1\n"
                    + "O O ---- hell W=what@-2 W=the@-1"),
        Pattern.compile("^\\s*$"), true);
testing.addThruPipe(testSource);
System.out.println(c.getBestLabels(testing.get(0)));
 I got that by looking at GenericAcrfTui. Some things I tried: When I tried giving different initial labels (other than "O"), then the resulting labeling changed but this doesn't help because I can't guess what labels to give initially, otherwise I wouldn't need a tagger. I tried not giving any initial labels at all but that just caused exceptions, it seems that Mallet really wants those labels. I noticed that there's also the SimpleTagger that can be used to train a CRF but I think that I will still have the same problem using that to label new input. Any help with labeling using a CRF from SimpleTagger or GenericAcrfTui would help. BTW I usually use CRF++ but for this task, I want to build my own graph because I'm using dependency parse features.
@CODE:GenericAcrfTui ACRF import cc.mallet.grmm.learning.ACRF;

@TITLE:User.IsInRole(¡§fake group¡¨) results in ¡§The trust relationship between the primary domain and the trusted domain failed¡¨
@CONTENT:I have an MVC 3 app, using Windows Authentication with Claims using WIF 4.5. Access to the application is controlled (currently) via membership in an AD group: <deny users="?" />
<allow roles="domain\somegroup" />
<deny users="*" />
 In addition to the AD groups, we have custom roles that need to be added. (This app is being converted from Forms to Windows authentication) To support these custom roles (until they are managed in AD), we are adding them as ClaimTypes.GroupSid claims to the user, so that existing code utilizing [Authorize("ADMIN")] and User.IsInRole("ADMIN") continues to function: Application_PostAuthenticateRequest(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    var identity = ClaimsPrincipal.Current.Identity as WindowsIdentity;
    var roles = userDAL.GetRoles(identity.Name);
    foreach(var role in roles)
    {
        identity.AddClaim(new Claim(ClaimTypes.GroupSid, role));
    }
}
 And this is all working as expected. Except when the current user is NOT a member of some custom role (like ADMIN) and that role also doesn't exist in AD We use [Authorize("ADMIN")] on Controller Action Methods, as well as various instances of User.IsInRole("ADMIN") depending in the scenario. It's in those instances where the error occurs and the app blows up. The AD infrastructure is in the midst of an upgrade/migration. I'm not privy to all the details there, but I do know there are a handful of domains, supposedly with trust between them, and it's been alluded to me by the infrastructure folks that these trust relationships are up and running. So really I guess I'm wondering 2 things: This really doesn't seem like something our code should have to handle. So what could really be wrong with the domain? Can I find out what 'trusted' domain the trust relationship is failing for? What is the best way to work around this? I dislike the idea of writing helper methods & Authorize() subclasses just to trap this exception.
@CODE:<deny users="?" />
<allow roles="domain\somegroup" />
<deny users="*" /> [Authorize("ADMIN")] User.IsInRole("ADMIN") Application_PostAuthenticateRequest(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    var identity = ClaimsPrincipal.Current.Identity as WindowsIdentity;
    var roles = userDAL.GetRoles(identity.Name);
    foreach(var role in roles)
    {
        identity.AddClaim(new Claim(ClaimTypes.GroupSid, role));
    }
} [Authorize("ADMIN")] User.IsInRole("ADMIN") Authorize()

@TITLE:How do I configure android tests directory?
@CONTENT:The Android gradle build forces my AndroidTests to be in src/androidTests. How do I change this to be another directory of my choosing? Here is some background: I am migrating a project from eclipse. According to the build documentation, when I add this to my gradle build file: androidTest.setRoot('tests')
 The android gradle build does this: "Note: setRoot() moves the whole sourceSet (and its sub folders) to a new folder. This moves src/androidTest/* to tests/*" That is great for the build and makes it run just fine. However, it forces my project structure to put my androidTests within: src/AndroidTest. This makes Eclipse unable to compile because it thinks all the test code should be in a package called androidTests.com.etc.etc.etc... I'd like to set some property like this: androidTest
{
    java.srcDirs = ['tests']
}

@TITLE:Subset a data frame based on value pairs stored in independent ordered vectors
@CONTENT:I have an R dataframe that I need to subset data from. The subsetting will be based on two columns in the dataframe. For example: A <- c(1,2,3,3,5,1)
B <- c(6,7,8,9,8,8)
Value <- c(9,5,2,1,2,2)
DATA <- data.frame(A,B,Value)
 This is how DATA looks A B Value

2 7     5
3 8     2
3 9     1

 I want those rows of data for which (A,B) combination is (1,6) and (3,8). These pairs are stored as individual (ordered) vectors of A and B: AList <- c(1,3)
BList <- c(6,8)
 Now, I am trying to subset the data basically by comparing if A column is present in AList AND B column is present in BList DATA[(DATA$A %in% AList & DATA$B %in% BList),]
 The subsetted result is shown below. In addition to the value pairs (1,6) and (3,8) I am also getting (1,8). Basically, this filter has given me value pairs for all combinations in AList and BList. How do I restrict it to just (1,6) and (3,8)? A B Value
1 6     9
3 8     2
1 8     2
 This is my desired result: A B Value

@CODE:A <- c(1,2,3,3,5,1)
B <- c(6,7,8,9,8,8)

@TITLE:C++11: Difference between v = { } and v { } [duplicate]
@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: Are ={} and {}-style initializations the same in C++11? 3 answers I would like to ask if there is any difference between following two statements: // C++11
std::vector<int> d {1, 2, 3};
std::vector<int> d = {1, 2, 3};
 In both cases the sequence constructor gets invoked: class A {
public:
  int a;

  A() {
    cout << "default constructor" << endl;
  };

  A(const A& other) {
    cout << "copy constructor" << endl;
  };

  A& operator =(const A& other) {
    cout << "assignment operator" << endl;
  }

  A(std::initializer_list<int> e) {
    cout << "sequence constructor" << endl;
  };

  A& operator =(std::initializer_list<int> e) {
    cout << "initializer list assignment operator" << endl;
  }
};

int main(int argc, char** argv) {

  A a {1, 2}; // sequence constructor
  A b = {1, 2}; // sequence constructor
  b = {1, 2}; // initializer list assignment operator

@LINK:/questions/22429534/angularjs-ngtable-delays-display-of-ajax-data
@TITLE:AngularJS ngTable delays display of ajax data
@CONTENT:Background I am struggling with the finer points of using ngTable. I went through the ngTable ajax demo and tried to follow the example as reasonably as possible; however, I need to deviate from the part where the ngTable ajax demo defines an ngResource inline with the Controller. Problem I successfully built an ngTable with ngTable filters; My webapp is here (also see the plunker). This is an ngTable which: Loads data from a json REST service Builds the ngTable from the json data Sorts Filters The json REST service loads correctly, and the filters work. However, my problem is that the table is blank until I type something in the Filter field (see the before and after screenshots below). The problem exists with all browsers I have tried: Firefox 27.0.1 (Windows Vista) Chrome Version 33.0.1750.146 (Windows Vista) Chrome Version 32.0.1700.123 (Linux - Debian 7.0 Wheezy) I know the webapp is broken in Internet Exploder 9... I don't know why, but I really don't care about IE; this webapp is not going to be a public web service. Questions How do I make the table populate the first time I load my webapp (without typing anything in the filter boxes)? Why is this broken now? Note: The source code is at the bottom of the page... I built a plunker for it. End Notes Note 1Sharp-eyed readers may notice that I'm using [[ and ]] in my AngularJS form instead of the default curly-brace delimiters. I did this because I'm using Flask with Jinja (which also needs double curly-braces for its templating engine).. Screen shots BEFORE: Page is blank when I load it: AFTER: However, if I type any character in the filters, the ngTable displays the data: Update: Explicit Problem Resolution, thanks to lib3d's answer <script type="text/javascript">

 I'm using... Yahoo PureCSS version 0.4.2 jQuery version 2.0.3 AngularJS version 1.2.14Note 1 What I already tried None of these things seemed to have an effect on the problem: Remove jQuery Remove Yahoo PureCSS Change default values on the ngTable Filters Remove all other javascript from the page (this actually had multiple AngularJS controllers on the same page, but removed all others in hopes that it was just a simple script conflict. Several experimental what-if-I-modify-this (read: grasping at straws) in the AngularJS controller which builds the ngTable. Tried using null instead of empty strings in my filter, as suggested by Sander Elias If I inline the json data inside the <script> block instead of making an ajax json REST service call, the table populates correctly when the page loads, but that really doesn't help since the data changes from time to time.

@LINK:/questions/22425306/resolving-conflicts-when-generating-code-with-cxf-and-wsdl2java
@TITLE:Resolving conflicts when generating code with CXF and wsdl2java
@CONTENT:I'm struggling with some conflicts during code generation from a bunch of WSDL files using wsdl2java via the cxf-codegen-plugin with Maven. The WSDLs declare different APIs of the same system, and the generated code has some amount of overlap (especially with the model classes). The external system and the WSDLs come from a third party and are therefore not controlled by us. The first problem I have is a naming conflict in one of the resulting ObjectFactory classes caused by one of the WSDLs. It defines a complexType with the name Foo that contains an element with the name Status, and it also defines a element with the name FooStatus. When generating the code, JAXB throws a fit because the ObjectFactory would have two factory methods with the name createFooStatus(...) and I end up with an exception during runtime. I've tried providing the option -autoNameResolution to wsdl2java with no avail. I've looked at "Two declarations cause a collision in the ObjectFactory class" and "Applying external JAXB binding file to schema elements imported from WSDL", and based on those I've written an external binding file that renames one of the factory methods. I use SCD instead of XPath in the binding file as shown in the latter link, because I had the same problem with XPath as the author. This works, but only if I process the WSDL files individually and apply the binding file only to the WSDL that causes the conflict. The Maven configuration looks like this: <plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.cxf</groupId>
  <artifactId>cxf-codegen-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>3.0.0-milestone1</version>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <id>generate-proxies</id>
      <phase>generate-sources</phase>
      <configuration>
        <wsdlOptions>
          <wsdlOption>
            <wsdl>${basedir}/First.wsdl</wsdl>
            <bindingFiles>
              <bindingFile>${basedir}/bindings.xml</bindingFile>
            </bindingFiles>
          </wsdlOption>
          <wsdlOption>
            <wsdl>${basedir}/Second.wsdl</wsdl>
          </wsdlOption>
          <wsdlOption>
            <wsdl>${basedir}/Third.wsdl</wsdl>
          </wsdlOption>
          ... More wsdlOption declarations ...
        </wsdlOptions>
      </configuration>
      <goals>
        <goal>wsdl2java</goal>
      </goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
 Now, if I do this I end up with another problem, because the generated code from the different WSDL files uses the same package structure. What this means in practice is that the ObjectFactory classes get overridden when processing subsequent WSDL files, meaning that only the one generated from the last WSDL will exist after the plugin execution. I know that I could change the target package structure, but the code generated from the different WSDLs has a lot of overlap and it would feel silly to duplicate it. I've also tried using the -keep wsdl2java option, but that doesn't seem to do anything (or at least the ObjectFactory classes still get overridden). My understanding is that the solution to this would be to process all of the WSDLs in one go with a Maven configuration like this (showing only the configuration section, all else stays the same): <configuration>
  <defaultOptions>
    <bindingFiles>
      <bindingFile>${basedir}/bindings.xml</bindingFile>
    </bindingFiles>
  </defaultOptions>
  <wsdlRoot>${basedir}</wsdlRoot>
  <includes>
    <include>*.wsdl</include>
  </includes>
</configuration>
 However, this results in a com.sun.istack.SAXParseException2, saying that my SCD expression doesn't match any schema component (since the schema component exists only in one of the WSDLs). I can get the result I want if I modify the WSDL file itself and use the latter Maven configuration without the binding file. By doing this, the resulting ObjectFactory is a merge from the ones that would be created when processing the WSDLs individually with the first Maven config. However, I'd rather not do that, but instead would like to manage this with an external binding file. How should I go about solving this? Can I write/apply the binding file so that no exception is raised if the matching schema component is not found? Or can I process the WSDLs individually and not overwrite the ObjectFactory classes? Or do I just have to suck it up and either generate the code from different WSDLs to different packages or edit the WSDL files themselves? Just in case it matters, my current binding file looks like this (the WSDLs are located inside my project in the same directory with the binding file): <bindings scd="x-schema::tns" xmlns:tns="NamespaceOfFoo" xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/jaxb" version="2.1">

@TITLE:Concise syntax for function composition in Scala?
@CONTENT:I'm learning Scala and ran across the following task - if string is blank then return null, otherwise uppercase it. There are two functions in Apache Commons that composed together solves the problem. In Haskell I'd just write: upperCaseOrNull = StringUtils.stripToNull . StringUtils.upperCase
 However I can't find a way to do an easy and clean function composition in Scala. the shortest way I found is as follows: def upperCaseOrNull (string:String) = StringUtils.stripToNull (StringUtils.upperCase(string))

@CONTENT:I am a bit stumped as to how to properly define constraints that will collapse the space between views when a given view is removed. I have tried adding vertical constraints with a greater than or equal relation, however, it seems that the min distance to satisfy the constraint is not preferred. For example, given the following layout with three constraints V:[A]-5-[B], V:[B]-5-[C], and V:[A]-(>=5)-[C]: [ View A ]

 After removing view B I want it to look like this: [ View A ]

 But it looks like this: [ View A ]
    |
   5 pt + 5 pt + height of view B

@TITLE:Git - How to selectively apply changes from one branch to another?
@CONTENT:Is it possible to selectively apply changes from one branch to another with Git? More specifically, I use a public dev branch for GitHub and a private master branch for deployment. When changes are made to one branch they will need to be applied to the other, but some lines of code need to stay different. In my case it's a few css classes and a feed. I'm new to Git but I've made my research : git merge --no-commit --no-ff can be used followed by a git mergetool to chose what I want in case of a conflict. The problem is that it only works for conflicts Git can't automatically merge, so what I want to stay different gets replaced before I get the chance to use my mergetool. git difftool --cached is useful as it allows me to see the differences, but I need to copy what I want to keep from there and manually replace it with a text editor, as I cannot simply choose and save like I can with mergetool. git cherry-pick seems to apply a specified commit to another, but what I want to stay different may be scattered to different commits, and these commits may not only include what I want to stay different. I cannot see this working unless I make millions of commits that would drive me mad. Also to be clear, I don't want one branch to become another, what seems to be the case with a merge. I want two separate branches with their respective differences and apply changes from one to the other. Is there a better workflow that would allow me to keep a development and a deployment version by applying their changes and keeping a few differences? I don't mind using separate repositories or different tools if it leads to a solution.

@LINK:/questions/22331008/using-calc-to-transition-width-and-height-in-ie
@TITLE:Using calc() to transition width and height in IE
@CONTENT:I've come across an issue today where trying to use CSS transitions to change an object's dimensions with calc() aren't working in IE. Or, rather, they're working in the sense that the calculated values are being applied but the transition rules are being ignored. See an example here: http://jsfiddle.net/32Qr7/ .block {
  width: 350px; height: 100px;
  background-color: red;
  margin: 10px; padding-left: 10px;
  transition: all 1s ease-in-out;
}

.block:hover {
  width: calc(100% - 50px);
  height: calc(150px + 10%);
}
 In this example, a div exists which changes its' width, height, and background-color over the course of one second on hover. In IE the background color still animates smoothly, but the width and height change is instantaneous. This is pretty big issue for me as I have a responsive web app with drawers that slide out from the side, and the rest of the layout has to adjust to compensate. Since I'm dealing with a multitude of screen sizes I can't use hard-coded values. (And yes, I looked at IE 10 + 11: CSS transitions with calc() do not work hoping for a solution there, but that question doesn't involve dimension changes, and as such the accepted solution there doesn't work for me.) Does anyone know of a workaround for this issue, or have any other alternate strategies to suggest? I'm hoping to be able to do it in CSS and avoid having to fall back to using jQuery animation techniques or somesuch.
@CODE:.block {
  width: 350px; height: 100px;
  background-color: red;
  margin: 10px; padding-left: 10px;
  transition: all 1s ease-in-out;
}

.block:hover {
  width: calc(100% - 50px);
  height: calc(150px + 10%);

@TITLE:How do you inject jdbiFactory DAOs into a Dropwizard Command?
@CONTENT:I'm starting to work with Dropwizard and I'm trying to create a Command that requires to use the database. If someone is wondering why I'd want to do that, I can provide good reasons, but this is not the point of my question anyway. It's about dependency inversion and Service initialization and run phases in Dropwizard. Dropwizard encourages to use its DbiFactory to build DBI instances but in order to get one, you need an Environment instance and/or the database configuration: public class ConsoleService extends Service<ConsoleConfiguration> {

  public static void main(String... args) throws Exception {
    new ConsoleService().run(args);
  }

  @Override
  public void initialize(Bootstrap<ConsoleConfiguration> bootstrap) {
    bootstrap.setName("console");
    bootstrap.addCommand(new InsertSomeDataCommand(/** Some deps should be here **/));
  }

  @Override
  public void run(ConsoleConfiguration config, Environment environment) throws ClassNotFoundException {
    final DBIFactory factory = new DBIFactory();
    final DBI jdbi = factory.build(environment, config.getDatabaseConfiguration(), "postgresql");
    // This is the dependency I'd want to inject up there
    final SomeDAO dao = jdbi.onDemand(SomeDAO.class); 
  }
}
 As you can see, you have the configuration for your Service and its Environment in its run() method, but commands need to be added to the Service's bootstrap in its initialize() method. So far, I've been able to achieve this by extending ConfiguredCommand in my Commands and creating DBI instances inside their run() methods, but this is a bad design, because dependencies should be injected into the object instead of creating them inside. I'd prefer to inject DAOs or any other dependencies of my Commands through their constructor, but this seems currently impossible to me, as the Environment and the configuration are not accesible in Service initialization, when I need to create and add them to its bootstrap. Does anyone know how to achieve this?
@CODE:Environment public class ConsoleService extends Service<ConsoleConfiguration> {

  public static void main(String... args) throws Exception {
    new ConsoleService().run(args);
  }

  @Override
  public void initialize(Bootstrap<ConsoleConfiguration> bootstrap) {

I've tried to put an !important the the padding and the box-sizing, but that didn't worked either. I've also tried change border-box with content-box (an answer from a google search) but that didn't worked either.

@LINK:/questions/22285043/forcing-compiler-to-c99-standard
@TITLE:Forcing compiler to C99 standard
@CONTENT:I was coding on my project when I discovered that the anonymous structs I've been using for a while are actually only available in C11, not C99, the standard I want to code against. Given the following code: struct data {
    int a;
    struct {
        int b;
        int c;
    };
};

int main()
{
    struct data d;

    d.a = 0;
    d.b = 1;
    d.c = 2;
    return 0;
}
 This code should only compile in C11 (or if compiler extensions provide this feature and are enabled). So let's see the results on different compilers: clang 5 compiler:
    Apple LLVM version 5.0 (clang-500.2.79) (based on LLVM 3.3svn)
    Target: x86_64-apple-darwin13.1.0
    Thread model: posix
command: 
    clang -std=c99 -Wall test.c -o test
result: 
    **OK**

    gcc (GCC) 4.1.2 20080704 (Red Hat 4.1.2-54)

    gcc -std=c99 -Wall test.c -o test
result: 
    **NOT OK**
    test.c:6: warning: declaration does not declare anything
    test.c: In function 'main':
    test.c:14: error: 'struct data' has no member named 'b'
    test.c:15: error: 'struct data' has no member named 'c'
 gcc 4.7 compiler:
    gcc (GCC) 4.7.2 20121109 (Red Hat 4.7.2-8)
command: 
    gcc -std=c99 -Wall test.c -o test
result: 
    **OK**
    test.c: In function 'main':
    test.c:11:14: warning: variable 'd' set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
 I've always tried to force the compiler to C99 mode by specifying -std=c99, but obviously this doesn't work (except for gcc 4.1 which compiles fine without the -std parameter). So my question is now, how can I force the compilers gcc and clang, in any version, to issue an error if I write code that does not conform to the standard I specify using -std? Is there some command line argument that I don't know of?

@LINK:/questions/22280775/underscore-equivalent-of-pick-for-arrays
@TITLE:Underscore equivalent of _.pick for arrays
@CONTENT:I understand that pick is used to get back an object with only specified properties: _.pick({name: 'moe', age: 50, userid: 'moe1'}, 'name', 'age');
=> {name: 'moe', age: 50}
 How would I perform that same operation on an array, say I have an array such as: [{name: 'moe1', age: 50, userid: 'moe1'},
{name: 'moe2', age: 50, userid: 'moe1'},
{name: 'moe3', age: 50, userid: 'moe1'}]
 and I want to map it to an array so to include only the name and age properties, like: [{name: 'moe1', age: 50},
{name: 'moe2', age: 50},
{name: 'moe3', age: 50}]
 Do I have to do an each() on the array then perform a pick() on each object, or is there a cleaner way? EDIT Sorry but just another small requirement, how would I perform a where (i.e. get all those whose age is greater than 50) and then perform the pick? EDIT got it done like this, was unaware of how chaining works in underscore. _(data).reject(function (r) { return d.age<51; }).map(function (o) {
            return _.pick(o, "age", "name");
});
@CODE:_.pick({name: 'moe', age: 50, userid: 'moe1'}, 'name', 'age');
=> {name: 'moe', age: 50} [{name: 'moe1', age: 50, userid: 'moe1'},
{name: 'moe2', age: 50, userid: 'moe1'},
{name: 'moe3', age: 50, userid: 'moe1'}] name age [{name: 'moe1', age: 50},
{name: 'moe2', age: 50},
{name: 'moe3', age: 50}] each() pick() pick _(data).reject(function (r) { return d.age<51; }).map(function (o) {
            return _.pick(o, "age", "name");

@LINK:/questions/22260343/powershell-convertto-json-missing-nested-level
@TITLE:Powershell ConvertTo-JSON missing nested level
@CONTENT:It looks like Powershell cuts off data when exporting to JSON if it nests too deep. My object hierchy looks like this: Main Object
    Metadata
    More Metadata
    Collection of Other object Sources
        Collection of data used by these sources
 For some reason, when I convert to JSON, powershell exports the Third level (Collection of data used by these sources) as an empty string, even though it is an array of objects with various NoteProperties added to them. For example: $test = New-Object -TypeName PSObject

$obj = New-Object -TypeName PSObject
$obj | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name "Name" -Value "adsf"

$test2 = New-Object -TypeName PSObject
$test2 | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name "ArrayTest" -Value @($obj, $obj)

$test3 = New-Object -TypeName PSObject
$test3 | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name "ArrayTest" -Value @($obj, $obj, $obj)

$test | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name "CollectionTest" -Value @($test2, $test3)
 This results in the following JSON String: PS C:\Users\user\projects\Powershell> $test | ConvertTo-Json
{
    "CollectionTest":  [
                           {
                               "ArrayTest":  " "
                           },
                           {
                               "ArrayTest":  "  "
                           }
                       ]
}
 Converting to XML results in a similar situation: <?xml version="1.0"?>
<Objects>
  <Object Type="System.Management.Automation.PSCustomObject">
    <Property Name="CollectionTest" Type="System.Object[]">
      <Property Type="System.Management.Automation.PSCustomObject">

@TITLE:Removing the info window from an embedded map in the new Google Maps
@CONTENT:In years past, it was easy to remove the info window from an embedded Google Maps. Just add iwloc=near in the query string. In the past few weeks, Google has migrated to a NEW embed query string format, to coincide with their new Maps product. Does anybody know how to hide the info bubble with the new query string? I do want to keep the marker icon (obstructed by the info window). I tried including iwloc=near before the rest of the query string, but that did nothing. I don't see any option on the new Embedded Map builder, either. <iframe

@CONTENT:I am trying to retrieve a value of private property via reflection // definition

@TITLE:strsplit on all spaces and punctuation except apostrophes [duplicate]
@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: Regex; eliminate all punctuation except 1 answer I have asked related questions HERE and HERE. I tried to generalize these answers but have failed. Basically I have a string I want to split into words, numbers and any sort of punctuation, yet, I want to retain the apostrophes. Here is what I've tried and I'm so close (I think): x <- "Raptors don't like robots! I'd pay $500.00 to rid them."

strsplit(x, "(\\s+)|(?=[[:punct:]])", perl = TRUE)

## [[1]]
##  [1] "Raptors" "don"     "'"       "t"       "like"    "robots"  "!"             
##  [8] ""   "I"   "'"    "d"  "pay"     "$"       "500"     "."       "00"      "to"         
## [20] "rid"   "them"    "."  
 Here's what I'm after: ## [[1]]
##  [1] "Raptors" "don't"       "like"    "robots"  "!"       ""        "I'd"      
##  [8] "pay"     "$"       "500"   "."   "00"  "to"      "rid"     "them"    "."  
 While I want a base solution I would like to see other solutions (I'm sure someone has a stringr solution) which makes the question more generalizable to others. Note: R has a specific regex system. You will want to be familiar with R to answer this question.
@CODE:x <- "Raptors don't like robots! I'd pay $500.00 to rid them."

strsplit(x, "(\\s+)|(?=[[:punct:]])", perl = TRUE)

@TITLE:Is there a way to prevent only a specific child from triggering a SIGCHLD?
@CONTENT:I'm writing a debugging utility, and I want to fork a child while preventing that child's termination from triggering a SIGCHLD to its parent. I still want other children to normally cause a SIGCHLD upon termination. I want to do this because I don't want the fork to trigger an existing $SIG{CHLD} handler, but I still want other children to trigger it. That is, I want to isolate my new child and I don't want it to interfere with management of existing children. I'm wary of locally installing a custom $SIG{CHLD} handler since I don't think I can properly detect when I should call the original handler. For instance, if I install a local $SIG{CHLD} handler, then I'm guaranteed to receive a SIGCHLD signal once I spawn a child and have the parent waitpid for it to terminate. However, that SIGCHLD won't indicate whether or not other children have terminated as well, so I can't be sure whether to call the original handler. I researched that a process cannot change its parent pid. I'm not sure if changing the child's process group id or session id would be useful. Is it even possible to prevent a specific child from triggering the SIGCHLD on the parent? Am I forced to rely on the existing $SIG{CHLD} handler to Do The Right Thing when it receives the SIGCHLD signal for a child that it did not expect? Although there may be a better way to implement that debugging utility (let me know if there is), I'm still wondering whether POSIX offers such fine-grained control over children, and am looking for a Perl solution to my dilemma.

@TITLE:CDI : WELD-001408 Unsatisfied dependencies, how to resolve it?
@CONTENT:I do a small test project with CDI. My application is composed of an EJB EAR and WAR, all deployed on Glassfish 4. I'm using Hibernate 4.3.4 to access the database. My goal is to verify that a class in an EJB (DAO) can receive an injection of an EntityManager. The pattern SessionBean + EJB is not fantastic but I have to modify an application already created so I do not have much choice. Here is my code of the EJB: @Named
public class DAOTest implements Serializable {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    @PersistenceContext(unitName="CDI-ejb")
    private EntityManager em;

    public void test(){
        //em.getClass();
    }


    public EntityManager getEm() {
       return em;
    }


    public void setEm(EntityManager em) {
        this.em = em;
    }

    public DAOTest() {
        // TODO Auto-generated constructor stub
    }

}
 Service.java @Stateless
@LocalBean
public class Service implements ServiceLocal {

    @Inject DAOTest test;
    /**
    * Default constructor. 
    */
    public Service() {
        // TODO Auto-generated constructor stub
    }


    @Override
    public void test() {
        test.test();

    }


}
 and ServiceLocal.java @Local
public interface ServiceLocal {
    void test();
}
 And inside my war : @WebServlet("/Test")
public class Test extends HttpServlet {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
    @Inject private ServiceLocal service;

    /**
    * @see HttpServlet#HttpServlet()
    */
    public Test() {
        super();
        // TODO Auto-generated constructor stub
    }


    /**

    protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {

 }
 I tested the DAOTest by annotating it with @ Stateless annotation. Everything happens as it should. So CDI works well. But with just @ Named it does not want to work. Any idea?

@TITLE:Overlay two audio buffers into one buffer source
@CONTENT:Trying to merge two buffers into one; I have been able to create the two buffers from the audio files and load and play them. Now I need to merge the two buffers into one buffer. How can they get merged?   context = new webkitAudioContext();
  bufferLoader = new BufferLoader(
    context,
    [
      'audio1.mp3',
      'audio2.mp3',
    ],
    finishedLoading
    );

  bufferLoader.load();

function finishedLoading(bufferList) {
  // Create the two buffer sources and play them both together.
  var source1 = context.createBufferSource();
  var source2 = context.createBufferSource();
  source1.buffer = bufferList[0];
  source2.buffer = bufferList[1];

  source1.connect(context.destination);
  source2.connect(context.destination);
  source1.start(0);
  source2.start(0);  
}
 Now these sources are loaded separately and are played at the same time; but how do I merge these two sources into one buffer source? I do NOT want to append them, I want to overlay/merge them. explanations and/or snippets would be great.
@CODE:context = new webkitAudioContext();
  bufferLoader = new BufferLoader(
    context,
    [
      'audio1.mp3',
      'audio2.mp3',

  bufferLoader.load();

function finishedLoading(bufferList) {
  // Create the two buffer sources and play them both together.
  var source1 = context.createBufferSource();
  var source2 = context.createBufferSource();
  source1.buffer = bufferList[0];

@LINK:/questions/22130402/can-gcc-optimize-methods-of-a-class-with-compile-time-constant-variables
@TITLE:Can GCC optimize methods of a class with compile-time constant variables?
@CONTENT:Preamble I'm using avr-g++ for programming AVR microcontrollers and therefore I always need to get very efficient code. GCC usually can optimize a function if its argument are compile-time constants, e.g. I have function pin_write(uint8_t pin, bool val) which determine AVR's registers for the pin (using my special map from integer pin to a pair port/pin) and write to these registers correspondent values. This function isn't too small, because of its generality. But if I call this function with compile-time constant pin and val, GCC can make all calculations at compile-time and eliminate this call to a couple of AVR instructions, e.g. sbi PORTB,1
sbi DDRB,1
 Amble Let's write a code like this: class A {
        int x;
public:
        A(int x_): x(x_) {}
        void foo() { pin_write(x, 1); }
};

A a(8);
int main()  {
        a.foo();
}
 We have only one object of class A and it's initialized with a constant (8). So, it's possible to make all calculations at compile-time: foo() -> pin_write(x,1) -> pin_write(8,1) -> a couple of asm instructions
 But GCC doesn't do so. Surprisely, but if I remove global A a(8) and write just  A(8).foo()
 I get exactly what I want: 00000022 <main>:
  22:   c0 9a           sbi     0x18, 0 ; 24
  24:   b8 9a           sbi     0x17, 0 ; 23
 Question So, is there a way to force GCC make all possible calculation at compile-time for single global objects with constant initializers? Because of this trouble I have to manually expand such cases and replace my original code with this: const int x = 8; 
class A {
public:
    A() {}
    void foo() { pin_write(x, 1); }
}
 UPD. It very wonderful: A(8).foo() inside main optimized to 2 asm instructions. A a(8); a.foo() too! But if I declare A a(8) as global -- compiler produce big general code. I tried to add static -- it didn't help. Why?
@CODE:pin_write(uint8_t pin, bool val) pin pin pin val sbi PORTB,1
sbi DDRB,1 class A {
        int x;
public:
        A(int x_): x(x_) {}
        void foo() { pin_write(x, 1); }
};

A a(8);
int main()  {
        a.foo();
} foo() -> pin_write(x,1) -> pin_write(8,1) -> a couple of asm instructions A a(8) A(8).foo() 00000022 <main>:
  22:   c0 9a           sbi     0x18, 0 ; 24
  24:   b8 9a           sbi     0x17, 0 ; 23 const int x = 8; 
class A {
public:
    A() {}
    void foo() { pin_write(x, 1); }
} A(8).foo() main A a(8); a.foo() A a(8) static x const constexpr

@LINK:/questions/22098799/rmongo-dbgetqueryforkeys-returns-na
@TITLE:RMongo dbGetQueryForKeys returns NA
@CONTENT:I'm using the dbGetQueryForKeys function (which I learned about here), and don't seem to be getting proper return values---it collects the right keys, but the values are all NA. Here's my query in the mongo console, which produces what I expect: db.final.find({},{"ids.myid":1,"org.name":1,"_id":0}).skip(0).limit(5000)
 This produces the list of... {"ids" : {"myid": "123"}, "org": {"name": "Fred"}},
 However, the equivalent in RMongo: dbGetQueryForKeys(db,'final', '{}','{"ids.myid":1,"org.name":1,"_id":0}',skip=0,limit=5000)
 Produces     ids.myid         org.name X_id
1         NA               NA   NA
2         NA               NA   NA
3         NA               NA   NA
 There are a couple problems: It has NAs for everything The X_id column is still there, even though it was 0'd. But it does correctly /omit/ all the rest of the keys, so it's clearly recognizing the command at some level, just returning the wrong values for these. Now, documentation says this:  The output is a data.frame object
 and will work properly only if the mongoDB collection contains
 primitive data types. It may not work properly if there are any
 embedded documents or arrays.
 This seems like the likely problem in that I am querying nested variables. However, the return values of those nestings are themselves singular, ids.myid and org.name are both strings and not arrays. Still, is this really the case? RMongo only works for completely flat collections with no nesting whatsoever?
@CODE:dbGetQueryForKeys db.final.find({},{"ids.myid":1,"org.name":1,"_id":0}).skip(0).limit(5000) {"ids" : {"myid": "123"}, "org": {"name": "Fred"}}, dbGetQueryForKeys(db,'final', '{}','{"ids.myid":1,"org.name":1,"_id":0}',skip=0,limit=5000) ids.myid         org.name X_id
1         NA               NA   NA
2         NA               NA   NA
3         NA               NA   NA The output is a data.frame object

@TITLE:Hiding everything until the page has finished loading

 Then run jQuery to show it again upon window load $(window).load(function() {
  $("body").fadeIn("slow");
});
 I have an issue with this, as the page is reliant on JS to show anything at all. I appreciate this is a rare thing, but just feels wrong. Ideally I would like to use jQuery to add the display:none css as well however... The problem is when I add $(document).ready(function {
  $(body).css('display', 'none');
});
 Even this takes a while to run and the page flickers with content before hand. Is there a better way? Could I use the above script without document.ready (tried, but didn;t work) Thanks.

@TITLE:Chutzpah and Jasmine 2.0 and RequrieJs
@CONTENT:I'm having some bother getting Chutzpah to work with requireJs/jasmine 2.0. This method worked for version 1.3 but now for jasmine version 2.0 chutzpah has stopped picking up the tests. I upgraded chutzpah to 3.1.1 for the jasmine 2.0 support as well. I did have to make a small change to load jasmine from requireJs to make it work but I figured this shouldn't affect chutzpah as it was just loading the html. Here's the command I run for chutzpah. chutzpah.console.exe path/to/SpecRunner.html
 The console now fails to pick up tests === 0 total, 0 failed, took 0.25 seconds ===
 But when I run the actual html file it finds the tests Any help would be greatly appreciated Instead of the HTML route I've been trying just the chutzpah built in configuration {
    "Framework": "jasmine",
    "TestHarnessReferenceMode": "AMD",
    "TestHarnessLocationMode": "SettingsFileAdjacent",
    "Tests": [
        {"Path" : "Specs/example.spec.js"}, 
    ],
    "References" : [
        {"Path" : "../../../Scripts/lib/require/require.js" }, 
        {"Path" : "../../../Scripts/app/app.js" }
    ]
}
 This runs however I'm getting an error Error: Error: Script error for: specs/example.spec

Error: Timeout occured when executing test file
While Running:C:\path\to\specs\example.spec.js

System.AggregateException: One or more errors occurred. 
---> System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.

at Chutzpah.FileProbe.<FindScriptFiles>d__1a.MoveNext() in c:\Dev\chutzpah\Chutzpah\FileProbe.cs:line 159
 The path here is definitely correct as i've copied and pasted it into an explorer window just to make sure. The test is a simple compiled coffeescript file which looks like this (function() {

  define([], function() {
    return describe('==== example test ====', function() {
      return describe('the test should', function() {
        return it('showcase toBe', function() {
          return expect(true).toBe(true);
        });
      });
    });
  });

}).call(this);
 And I'm certain that this works as it's passing in my browser html based equivalent. This was my final configuration that works with html. I couldn't get it to work with just the config discovering the tests. Hopefully this will be resolved when item 214 is resolved as in the below answer {

I don't use any native library and all externals libraries don't use any native code Version of Android where it happened: Android 4.0.3 - 4.0.4 (97.7%) Android 4.0 - 4.0.2 (1.5%) Android 4.1 (0.8%) Can anybody help me with workaround? Can receiver in AndroidManifest call this issue?

@TITLE:VBA Excel 2010 - Embedding Pictures and Resizing
@CONTENT:I've been lurking for a while and found it very helpful, so thanks for the help already! I'm trying to write a macro to embed images into a worksheet from individual files and resize them, whilst keeping the full resolution of the image intact should it need to be enlarged again. First of all I tried: ActiveSheet.Pictures.Insert(imageName).Select
With Selection.ShapeRange
    .Height = 100
    .Width = 100
End With
 This essentially inserted a link to the picture and if the image file was removed or the excel file moved to another computer, the link would be broken. Next I tried: ActiveSheet.Shapes.AddPicture Filename:=imageName, _
    linktofile:=msoFalse, _
    savewithdocument:=msoCTrue, _
    Width:=100, _
    Height:=100
 This code also works, but the image is resized to 100 * 100 pixels before insertion, so the original file resolution is lost. Is there any way to insert image files and then scale them down in size, so that the original resolution is retained? Many thanks, Adam.

@TITLE:Thymeleaf/Spring MVC - How do you nest variables/expressions in a Link expression?
@CONTENT:For example, my controller method in Spring does this: model.addAttribute("view_name", "foobar")
 And I'm trying to do this in my Thymeleaf template: <link th:href="@{/resources/libs/css/${view_name}.css}" rel="stylesheet" />
 But the rendered result is this: <link href="/app/resources/libs/css/${view_name}.css" rel="stylesheet" />
 So it's not replacing the ${view_name} like I'm expecting. What am I doing wrong? In general, how do you nest expressions like that in Thymeleaf?
@CODE:model.addAttribute("view_name", "foobar") <link th:href="@{/resources/libs/css/${view_name}.css}" rel="stylesheet" /> <link href="/app/resources/libs/css/${view_name}.css" rel="stylesheet" /> ${view_name}

@CONTENT:I have an Azure website. I also have dotless running in my MVC app to translate and bundle Less files. When I deploy a release build to Azure, the Less file returns 404 unless I set it to Build Action="Content" in it's properties. Once I change that setting, everything works as expected. So, I no longer have an issue, except I don't understand why it has to be set to Content. Can someone explain?

@TITLE:MVC Submit Form With Partial View
@CONTENT:Apologies if this has been answered before, I can't find anything that matches my issue. I have a View, which contains a Partial View, and when submitting the View, the data from the partial view is not sent to the controller. I understand that if I use an editor template, this should work, but I'm unable to use this, as I need data from my main model inside the Partial. My Create View (simplified): @model CreateXmlSchemaModel
@using (Html.BeginForm("Create", "XmlSchema", FormMethod.Post, new { enctype = "multipart/form-data" }))
{
    <fieldset>
        <div class="editor-label">
            @Html.LabelFor(m => m.XmlSchema.Name)
        </div>
        <div class="editor-field">
            @Html.EditorFor(m => m.XmlSchema.Name)
        </div>
        <div id="fieldmapping">
            @Html.Partial("_XmlFieldMapping")
        </div>
        <div>
            <input type="submit" value="Create" class="button" />
        </div>
    </fieldset>
}
 My Model structure (simplified): public abstract class XmlSchemaModelContainerBase
{
    public IEnumerable<string> BusinessObjects { get; set; }
    public IEnumerable<XmlInputFieldModel> XmlFields { get; set; }
    public IEnumerable<string> BusinessObjectFields { get; set; }
}

public class XmlSchemaModelContainer : XmlSchemaModelContainerBase
{
    public XmlSchemaModel XmlSchema { get; set; }
}

public class XmlSchemaModel
{
    public Guid Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string BusinessObject { get; set; }
    public IEnumerable<XmlSchemaField> MappedFields { get; set; }
}

public class XmlSchemaField
{
    public string XmlElement { get; set; }
    public string BusinessObjectField { get; set; }
}

public class XmlInputFieldModel
{
    public string XmlElement { get; set; }
    public string XmlValue { get; set; }
}

public class CreateXmlSchemaModel : XmlSchemaModelContainer
{
    [Required(ErrorMessage = "File upload required")]
    public HttpPostedFileBase Xml { get; set; }
}
 My Controller (I won't post it all, as I can tell immediately that my viewModel does not contains the MappedFields): [HttpPost]
public ActionResult Create(CreateXmlSchemaModel viewModel)
{
}
 My _XmlMappedFields Partial View: @model CherwellXmlConnector.Models.XmlSchemaModelContainer
@{
    Model.XmlSchema.MappedFields = Model.XmlSchema.MappedFields.OrderBy(i => i.XmlElement);
}

<div>
    <div>
        @for(int i = 0; i < @Model.XmlFields.Count(); i ++)
        {
            List<CherwellXmlConnector.Models.XmlSchemaField> fields = Model.XmlSchema.MappedFields.ToList();
            string itemValue = Model.XmlFields.FirstOrDefault(x => x.XmlElement == fields[i].XmlElement).XmlValue;

            <div style="width: 300px; display: inline-block;">
                @Html.DisplayFor(x => fields[i].XmlElement)
            </div>
            <div style="width: 300px; display: inline-block;">
                @itemValue
            </div>

                @Html.DropDownListFor(x => fields[i].BusinessObjectField, new SelectList(Model.BusinessObjectFields))
            </div>
            <hr />
        }
    </div>
</div>
 My intention is to display to the user in the partial, a list of all the given XmlFields and their values, and allow them to select a BusinessObjectField from a dropdown for each XmlField. I then want this submitted back to the Controller inside the IEnumerable<XmlSchemaField> MappedFields object. Is this possible?

@TITLE:How to use the QT Jni class ¡§QAndroidJniObject¡¨
@CONTENT:I'm a beginner of "QT for Android" and now I'm using it to develop a communication oftware based on mobile.I hava developed java functions that call android's api as a class in a .java document.In order to Simplify UI development,the UI is based on QT Widget program.Then I use the QT-JNI class "QAndroidJniObject" to call these java functions according to QT5.2 API document.Android resource file is stored in the directory:./android/src/com/comm/sipcall/SipCallSend.java.Since the less information in this regard,I developed the java and c++ program according to API document.But I encountered the following problems, and also hope to get answers: 1) The QT program is based on QT Widget.The java program needs to get the current application object Context in order to initialize java object.The c++ code I developed as following: //c++:
    QPlatformNativeInterface *interface = QApplication::platformNativeInterface();
    jobject activity = (jobject)interface->nativeResourceForIntegration("QtActivity");
    QAndroidJniObject* at = new QAndroidJniObject(activity);
    QAndroidJniObject appctx = at->callObjectMethod("getApplicationContext","()Landroid/content/Context;");

//.pro¡G
    QT += core gui gui-private
 Is this right? 2) The java class contains a constructor function and three public functions: java:
package com.comm.sipcall;
improt XXXX
....

public class SipCallSend extends Activity {
    private Context context; // ±µ¦¬QTªºcontext
    public String sipToAddress = "";
    public String sipDomain = "";
    public String user_name = "";
    public String pass_word = "";

        public SipCallSend(){

        Log.i("ddd","init");
        sipToAddress = "";
        sipDomain = "";
        user_name = "";
        pass_word = "";
        }
        public void SetContext(Context cnt)
        {
            this.context = cnt;
            //Log.i("ccc",user_name);
        }
        public int Login(String domain,String username,String password){
            ....

            ...
            return 0;
        }
}

    if (!m_sipcall->isValid())
        return;
    m_sipcall->callMethod<void>("SetContext","(Landroid/content/Context;)V",
                                            appctx.object<jobject>());

    QAndroidJniObject domain = QAndroidJniObject::fromString("10.3.56.54");
    QAndroidJniObject username = QAndroidJniObject::fromString("1006");
    QAndroidJniObject password = QAndroidJniObject::fromString("1234");
    jint res = m_sipcall->callMethod<jint>("Login","(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)I",
                                            domain.object<jstring>(), username.object<jstring>(),password.object<jstring>());

    if (res!=0)
        return;

    QAndroidJniObject addrNum = QAndroidJniObject::fromString("1018");
    res = m_sipcall->callMethod<jint>("Call","(Ljava/lang/String;)I",addrNum.object<jstring>());
 The "new QAndroidJniObject" returns non-empty,but the the following functions connot execute,why? 3) I have tried to make the Context from c++ as a parameter of constructor function,but I found the code not running,why? java:
        public SipCallSend(Context cnt){

        this.context = cnt;
        }
C++:
    QAndroidJniObject m_sipcall("com/comm/sipcall/SipCallSend","(Landroid/content/Context;)V",appctx.object<jobject>());
 4) According to QT5.2 API document,QAndroidJniObject provides a method named "callObjectMethod": QAndroidJniObject myJavaString; ==> "Hello, Java"
QAndroidJniObject mySubstring = myJavaString.callObjectMethod("substring", "(II)Ljava/lang/String;" 7, 10);
 But when I use it as following, the IDE prompts me the parameter are incorrect,why? jint res = m_sipcall->callMethod<jint>("Login","(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)I",
                                        domain.object<jstring>(), username.object<jstring>(),password.object<jstring>());

@TITLE:lookup field values in two fixed format file in unix - not working
@CONTENT:I have 2 fixed length files input#1 & input#2. I want to match the rows based on the value in position 37-50 in both files (pos 37-50 will have same value in both files). If any matching record is found then cut the value against company code & Invoice number from input file #1 (position 99 until end of line). The cut string (from Input #1) need to be appended at the end of the record/line. Below is the code I tried (not working) and the input files & desired output. Please provide your advice. Code: awk '
NR==FNR && NF>1 {
    v=substr($0,37,14);
#print substr($0,37,14)
    next
}
NR==FNR && ( /Company Code/ OR /Invoice Number/ ) {
    sub(/Company Code/,"",$0);
    sub(/Invoice Number/,"",$0);
    a[v]=$0;
print $0
    next
}
(substr($0,37,14) in a) {
    print $0 a[substr($0,99)]
}' Input1.txt input2.txt input3.txt

@CONTENT:For a project, I need to start SBT with specific JVM options (-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 and a number of memory/gc options) - but I don't necessarily want to apply those same options to every SBT project I have. I've seen references (in sbt-extras) to the .sbtopts (project-specific SBT command line options) and .jvmopts (project-specific SBT JVM options) files that are supposed to support this, if found in the root directory of an SBT project, but the standard Windows version of SBT (I'm using version 0.13.1) seems to ignore them. (The sbt-extras approach appeals to me because, assuming that .sbtopts and .jvmopts are tracked in version control, there is zero SBT configuration required for people wishing to build the project.) Is there a current mechanism to specify project-specific SBT options that works cross platform?

@LINK:/questions/22000272/how-to-limit-the-raster-processing-extent-using-a-spatial-mask
@TITLE:How to limit the raster processing extent using a spatial mask?
@CONTENT:I am trying to limit raster processing in MATLAB to include only areas within a shapefile boundary, similar to how ArcGIS Spatial Analyst functions use a mask. Here is some (reproducible) sample data I am working with: A 4-band NAIP image (WARNING 169MB download) A shapefile of study area boundaries (A zipped shapefile on File Dropper) Here is a MATLAB script I use to calculate NDVI: file = 'C:\path\to\doi1m2011_41111h4nw_usda.tif';
[I R] = geotiffread(file);
outputdir = 'C:\output\'

% Calculate NDVI
NIR = im2single(I(:,:,4));
red = im2single(I(:,:,1));

ndvi = (NIR - red) ./ (NIR + red);
double(ndvi);
imshow(ndvi,'DisplayRange',[-1 1]);

% Stretch to 0 - 255 and convert to 8-bit unsigned integer
ndvi = floor((ndvi + 1) * 128); % [-1 1] -> [0 256]
ndvi(ndvi < 0) = 0;             % not really necessary, just in case & for symmetry
ndvi(ndvi > 255) = 255;         % in case the original value was exactly 1
ndvi = uint8(ndvi);             % change data type from double to uint8

% Write NDVI to .tif file (optional)
tiffdata = geotiffinfo(file);
outfilename = [outputdir 'ndvi_' 'temp' '.tif'];  
geotiffwrite(outfilename, ndvi, R, 'GeoKeyDirectoryTag', tiffdata.GeoTIFFTags.GeoKeyDirectoryTag) 
 The following image illustrates what I would like to accomplish using MATLAB. For this example, I used the ArcGIS raster calculator (Float(Band4-Band1)/Float(Band4+Band1)) to produce the NDVI on the right. I also specified the study area shapefile as a mask in the environment settings. Question: How can I limit the raster processing extent in MATLAB using a polygon shapefile as a spatial mask to replicate the results shown in the figure? What I have unsuccessfully tried: roipoly and poly2mask, although I cannot seem to apply these functions properly (taking into account these are spatial data) to produce the desired effects. EDIT: I tried the following to convert the shapefile to a mask, without success. Not sure where I am going wrong here... s = 'C:\path\to\studyArea.shp'

shp = shaperead(s)
lat = [shp.X];
lon = [shp.Y];

x = shp.BoundingBox(2) - shp.BoundingBox(1)
y = shp.BoundingBox(3) - shp.BoundingBox(1) 

x = poly2mask(lat,lon, x, y)

@TITLE:Calling node.js script from PHP returns nothing
@CONTENT:What I want to do is simple in theory, but I cannot quite get it to work. I wrote a simple node.js script that uses the request package to asynchronously fetch some data, parse it, and spit it out as html. I wanted to integrate this script in my client's php and apache based website which is on a shared host, and ran into some snags: There is no mod_proxy, so I can't simply run my node script as a server and proxy through Apache I don't want to run node on port 80 and proxy to apache from node. It's just way too much overkill for what I need to do, and would introduce too many headaches for me. My particular shared host is known to have trouble keeping node server instances up, and I can't justify potential downtime just for this script to run. I tried the node-cgi package but it didn't work for me. I got errors about internal node methods not existing, I think this package is just out of date. So what I have landed on is trying to simply call node from PHP. My whole index.php file is: <?php
  header("Content-Type: text/html");
  exec("node beerlist.nd", $output);
  echo implode('', $output);
 When I execute php index.php on the command line, I get my expected output, however, when I try to access this from the browser, I get nothing ie Content-Length: 0. Why? I thought maybe it had to do with the async nature of my node script but it seems like the process stays alive until it finishes all the async calls. So shouldn't my php snippet send the output to the browser without any trouble? What am I missing here? Edit: This gist of my node script is var req = require('request')

req("http://mywebsite.com", function(err, resp, body) {
  var output = // pull some interesting pieces out of the whole body
  console.log(output);
});
 The generation of my output variable is not central to the issue here. The relevant parts are that I use request to make an asynchronous call and use console.log to output my results... maybe this is a problem?
@CODE:request node-cgi index.php <?php
  header("Content-Type: text/html");
  exec("node beerlist.nd", $output);
  echo implode('', $output); php index.php Content-Length: 0 var req = require('request')

@CODE:/oneWord/... /secondWord url: '/{type:(oneWord|secondWord)}/:group', Unbalanced capture group in route '/{type:(oneWord|secondWord)}/:group' url: "/{page:[0-9]{1,8}}" (oneWord|secondWord)

@TITLE:How to get the IP address of the associated access point on an iOS device
@CONTENT:Use Case: We have an iOS application where you can run a network test between an iOS device and its associated wireless access point to test throughput. The app can get the IP address of the iOS device just fine, but the user has to type in the IP of the access point. Problem: The task is to get the IP address of the associated access point, and pre fill it for the user, hence avoiding user intervention there. My Approach: Find out the Mac Address/BSSID of the access point. I do this by employing the Captive Network API. Issue an ARP request to find out the IP associated to the access point. I haven't been able to accomplish this as of yet. Google and SO search has kind of lead me to a dead end here. Here are some similar questions: How do I query the ARP table on iPhone? AND ARP Requests on iPhone Question: What is the right way to do this? In fewer words, what is the best way to get the IP address of the access point an iOS device is connected to.

@TITLE:Why is an explicit type NOT required for basic Prelude arithmetic?
@CONTENT:I was answering a question and wrote some code to get the job done. isPrime :: Int -> Bool
isPrime n = primeCheck n $ floor $ sqrt $ (fromIntegral n :: Double)
 I assumed that the explicit type signature would be required, as explained in my answer. Then I checked it in both GHC and GHCi and discovered that I did not need the explicit type for the conversion despite floor and sqrt being polymorphic. I know GHCi does does some type defaulting, but I'm not aware of any in GHC. Obviously both Float and Double would be valid choices here, why does GHC choose one over the other? What type is defaulted to, and why does (presumably) GHC default in this case?

@TITLE:dotless on Azure Web Project doesn't understand &:extend
@CONTENT:I'm using Azure SDK 2.2 and created a brand new MVC 5 web project. I added dotless, bootstrap-less (and subsequently updated to the latest LESS from getbootstrap.com), and font-awesome. I'm updated to the latest of everything and resolved the issue where dotless added a section to my web.config file and caused the project to return a 500 internal server error. That configuration has moved to according to the error. Now the page loads, but there is an issue with the bootstrap compilation from less to CSS. Here is what I see when I go to the bootstrap.less file: Expected '}' but found ':' on line 643 in file 'mixins.less':
[642]:   padding-right: (@grid-gutter-width / 2);
[643]:   &:extend(.clearfix all);
       --^
[644]: }
 This is what my BundleConfig.cs file says: bundles.Add(new StyleBundle("~/Content/css").Include(
    "~/Content/bootstrap/bootstrap.less",
    "~/Content/css/font-awesome.css",
    "~/Content/site.css"));
 Font-Awesome shows up fine along with the Site CSS, but they're not using LESS. The LESS code is straight out of the Bootstrap 3.1.1 source off http://getbootstrap.com so I don't think that is the issue. I've also tried separating the Bootstrap into its own bundle: bundles.Add(new StyleBundle("~/bundles/bootstrap").Include(
    "~/Content/bootstrap/bootstrap.less"));

bundles.Add(new StyleBundle("~/Content/css").Include(
    "~/Content/css/font-awesome.css",
                  "~/Content/site.css"));
 Separating the bundle raises the same exception seen above and gives this error message in the Debug console: Critical error was detected at line 2, column 10 in http://127.0.0.1/Content/bootstrap/bootstrap.less. SCRIPT1004: Expected ';'
 That line is simply an import in the less bootstrap.less file. Any suggestions on where else to look?

@CONTENT:This is using the Static Maps API. I have a web page with 3 img tags, each of which is a call to the static maps API, eg http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/staticmap?format=png&center=cv33%209ND&zoom=10&size=999x998&maptype=roadmap&markers=color:red%7Clabel:aa%7Ccv33%209ND&sensor=false&markers=color:blue%7Clabel:A%7Ce14%208js&sensor=false&key=AIzaSyA7-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx_JGk (NB of course this is not the real api key) . The 3 tags are identical, except the zoom, which is 10, 13 and 16 for the three images. The API Key is from a project with the Static maps API enabled, and billing configured and enabled. I have sent perhaps 60 requests in total (this is a brand new development project, so I'm just getting started). What I'm seeing is that sometimes, all three maps are displayed. At other times one (random from the three) map fails with 403 "The Google Maps API server rejected your request. An internal error was found for this API project." So if I refresh the page 5 times, ie 15 requests, I get approx 4 failures and 11 successes. So why is Google Maps randomly rejecting some of the requests with this 403?

@TITLE:.ctor is ambiguous because multiple kinds of members with this name exist in class
@CONTENT:I am replicating a situation that I am facing. Let's say we have an assembly, with C# class as: public class Program
{
    int n = 0;

    public void Print()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(n);
    }

    public Program()
    {
    }

    public Program(int num = 10)
    {
        n = num;
    }
}
 We refer the above assembly in VB.NET project and trying to create an instance of the Program class: Module Module1 
    Sub Main()
        Dim p As New Program()
        p.Print()
        p = New Program(20)
        p.Print()
        Console.ReadLine()
    End Sub
End Module
 The VB.NET project is not compiling, giving error: '.ctor' is ambiguous because multiple kinds of members with this name exist in class 'ConsoleApplication2.Program'. From the error message we can see the the VB.NET compiler is not sure which constructor to call - as one constructor is parameterless and other with one optional parameter. This issue is occurring in VS2010/.NET 4 and not in VS2012/.NET 4.5. Also in C# it is not givng any issues, it successfully compiles and runs the code of object initiaization of Program class. Is there a way we can create Program class' instance in VB.NET + VS2010/.NET 4 without changing the constructors ?
@CODE:public class Program
{
    int n = 0;

    public void Print()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(n);
    }

    public Program()
    {
    }

    public Program(int num = 10)
    {
        n = num;
    }
} Module Module1 
    Sub Main()
        Dim p As New Program()
        p.Print()
        p = New Program(20)
        p.Print()
        Console.ReadLine()
    End Sub

@CONTENT:Under the gcc docs 128-bit integers is: As an extension the integer scalar type __int128 is supported for targets which have an integer mode wide enough to hold 128 bits. Simply write __int128 for a signed 128-bit integer, or unsigned __int128 for an unsigned 128-bit integer. There is no support in GCC for expressing an integer constant of type __int128 for targets with long long integer less than 128 bits wide. I was wondering what gcc version added support for this type, or if there's a macro that can be used directly to test for its existence.

@CONTENT:I'm playing around with CoreBluetooth in iOS 7, and have successfully got two devices sending quite a large amount of data between each other (one is the central, one is the peripheral). Between an iPhone 5 and 4S I had an MTU of 20 bytes, and between an iPhone 5s and iPhone 5 I had an MTU of 132 bytes. The size is much larger, so I assumed fewer individual messages would be sent and therefore the overall time of the transfer would decrease. Unfortunately the time remains pretty much the same in both scenarios (around 15 seconds). Was my original assumption incorrect or is there something I may be doing wrong?

@TITLE:How big is too big for a PostgreSQL table?
@CONTENT:I'm working on the design for a RoR project for my company, and our development team has already run into a bit of a debate about the design, specifically the database. We have a model called Message that needs to be persisted. It's a very, very small model with only three db columns other than the id, however there will likely be A LOT of these models when we go to production. We're looking at as much as 1,000,000 insertions per day. The models will only ever be searched by two foreign keys on them which can be indexed. As well, the models never have to be deleted, but we also don't have to keep them once they're about three months old. So, what we're wondering is if implementing this table in Postgres will present a significant performance issue? Does anyone have experience with very large SQL databases to tell us whether or not this will be a problem? And if so, what alternative should we go with?

@TITLE:How can Json.NET perform dependency injection during deserialization?
@CONTENT:When I have a class with no default constructor, i.e. using dependency injection to pass its dependencies, can Newtonsoft.Json create such an object? For example: public class SomeFoo
{
    private readonly IFooDependency _dependency;

    public SomeFoo(IFooDependency dependency){
        if(dependency == null)
            throw new ArgumentNullException("dependency");

    public void DoFoo(){
        Data = _dependency.GetFooData();
        MoreData = _dependency.GetMoreFooDate();
    }
}
 During serialization, I only care of storing Data and MoreData (and the type of the object, but let's don't complicate things for the moment). Now, to deserialize, can I call something like var obj = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<SomeFoo>(jsonText);
 How can I let JsonConvert know about my DI container? (Note: A work-around would be to always have default constructors in my classes, and call Service Locator in there to get any dependencies I need. I'm just looking for some more clean solution without poluting my classes with such constructors).
@CODE:Newtonsoft.Json public class SomeFoo
{
    private readonly IFooDependency _dependency;

    public SomeFoo(IFooDependency dependency){
        if(dependency == null)

        _dependency = dependency;
    }

    public string Data { get; set; }
    public int MoreData { get; set; }

    public void DoFoo(){
        Data = _dependency.GetFooData();
        MoreData = _dependency.GetMoreFooDate();
    }

@TITLE:Deadlock using SELECT ¡K FOR UPDATE in MySQL
@CONTENT:Let's say I have the table: CREATE TABLE t (id INTEGER AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL, desc TEXT NOT NULL)
 I populate the table with 1 element: INSERT INTO TABLE t VALUES (1, 'Hello')
 And I run two transactions in MySQL. In t1 I run: START TRANSACTION;
SELECT * FROM t WHERE id = 1 FOR UPDATE;
 In t2 I run: START TRANSACTION;
SELECT * FROM t WHERE id = 1 FOR UPDATE;
 At this point I expect t1 to hold an e(X)clusive lock on the row, and t2 to wait until it can get an X lock (and t2 gets indeed blocked, so far so good). I then run an update in t1 (without any WHERE clause!): UPDATE t SET desc = 'Hello from t1';
 At this point in t2 I get immediately (no need to COMMIT the transaction) the error: ERROR 1213 (40001): Deadlock found when trying to get lock; try restarting transaction
 Why am I getting this error? I guess there is a lock that t2 is obtaining that the full UPDATE needs to proceed, making a deadlock, but I don't understand how can t2 obtain a lock given that it should be waiting for t1 to finish.

@LINK:/questions/21840713/angularui-separate-files-for-modal-controllers
@TITLE:AngularUI separate files for modal controllers
@CONTENT:My Angular application has a number of modals, and I have AngularUI to provide the modal directive. http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/ So far I have several main controllers, and these are all in the app.js file as routes. $routeProvider.when '/dashboard',         templateUrl: '/templates/dashboard/dashboard.html', controller: 'DashboardController'
$routeProvider.when '/dataset/:panel_id', templateUrl: '/templates/dataset/dataset.html',   controller: 'DatasetController'
$routeProvider.when '/batches/:panel_id', templateUrl: '/templates/design/design.html',     controller: 'PanelController'  
 This works fine. Then I created a function which calls a modal, and the modal has an instance controller of ConfigureModalCtrl. I initially had this at the bottom of the calling controller file, and it worked OK. $scope.invokeConfigureModal = (assay_id) ->
   $scope.assay_id = assay_id
   $scope.primer3 = $scope.getPrimer(assay_id)
   modalInstance = $modal.open(
     templateUrl: '/templates/configure_modal/configure_modal.html'
     controller: ConfigureModalCtrl
     windowClass: 'configure-dialog'
     resolve:
           primer3: ->
             $scope.primer3
   )
   modalInstance.result.then ((primer3) ->
      $scope.primer3 = primer3
      return
     ), ->
      return   
 Now I have moved the modal instance controller into it's own file, but the calling function cannot find it. angular.module('assaypipelineApp').controller "ConfigureModalCtrl", ($scope,  $modalInstance, primer3) ->
  $scope.primer3 = primer3['data']
  $scope.ok = ->  
    $modalInstance.close $scope.primer3
    return
  $scope.cancel = ->
    $modalInstance.dismiss "cancel"
  serverErrorHandler = ->
    alert("There was a server error, please reload the page and try again.")
 Error message Error: Unknown provider: ConfigureModalCtrlProvider <- ConfigureModalCtrl
 Similar question but does not resolve my problem. How to create separate AngularJS controller files? So how can I resolve this problem, and why does this not occur for the other (non-modal instance) controllers? Is it because they are named in the routes? Any recommendations on coding style are welcome also ... thanks for reading this.

 You can retrieve the variable through the scope setting in the return: scope: {

 If the callback is not set, eg: <my-directive />
 The value of $scope.callback is still: $scope.callback():function (locals) {

@CONTENT:I'm trying to use the polymer-ui-tabs component for a traditional tab component where you switch content based on which tab is selected. Unless I'm missing something the polymer-ui-tabs component only seems to provide the tab selector bit without an in built mechanism for switching content. Is that correct? If it doesn't then how do I build that on top of it?

@LINK:/questions/21809556/mvc5-attribute-routing-precedence-among-controllers
@TITLE:MVC5 : Attribute Routing Precedence Among Controllers
@CONTENT:I am using the Attribute Routing from MVC5 in my controllers. Question: Is there a way to control attribute routing precedence among controllers? Consider the following [Route("home/{action=index}/{username?}")]
public class HomeController : Controller
{
    [Route("home/index/{username?}", Order = 1)]
    [Route("home/{username?}", Order = 2)]
    [Route("{username?}", Order = 3)]
    public ActionResult Index()
    {
        // ... bunch of stuff
    }
}
 Base on the code above, HomeController.Index() action method should be invoked using the following requests: domain/ domain/{username} domain/home/ domain/home/{username} domain/home/index/ domain/home/index/{username} Second Controller: [Authorize(Roles = "Member")]
[Route("profile/{action=index}")]
public class ProfileController : Controller
{
    [Route("profile")]
    public ActionResult Index()
    {

    }
}
 The ProfileController.Index() should be invoked using the following request. domain/profile domain/profile/index The problem From the examples, if I send domain/profile in the url, an ambiguity exception is thrown. It seems that there is an ambiguity between domain/{username} and domain/profile. Now, if I used convention-based routing, this would have worked (first match wins). But can it be done in MVC5 Attribute Routing? because I found that a third party library supports precedence among controllers https://github.com/mccalltd/AttributeRouting/wiki/Controlling-Route-Precedence routes.MapAttributeRoutes(config =>
{
    config.AddRoutesFromController<ProfileController>();
    config.AddRoutesFromController<HomeController>();
});
@CODE:[Route("home/{action=index}/{username?}")]
public class HomeController : Controller
{
    [Route("home/index/{username?}", Order = 1)]
    [Route("home/{username?}", Order = 2)]
    [Route("{username?}", Order = 3)]
    public ActionResult Index()
    {
        // ... bunch of stuff
    }
} HomeController.Index() [Authorize(Roles = "Member")]
[Route("profile/{action=index}")]
public class ProfileController : Controller
{
    [Route("profile")]
    public ActionResult Index()
    {

    }
} ProfileController.Index() domain/profile domain/{username} domain/profile routes.MapAttributeRoutes(config =>
{
    config.AddRoutesFromController<ProfileController>();
    config.AddRoutesFromController<HomeController>();

@TITLE:Join tables on columns of composite foreign / primary key in a query
@CONTENT:CREATE TABLE subscription (
   magazine_id bigint,
   user_id     bigint,
   PRIMARY KEY (magazine_id, user_id)
)

CREATE TABLE delivery (
   magazine_id bigint,
   user_id     bigint,
   FOREIGN KEY (subscription) REFERENCES subscription (magazine_id, user_id)
)
 What is a good way to query for deliveries given a particular subscription? Is there a way to assign a column name to PRIMARY KEY (magazine_id, user_id) and the corresponding foreign key so that I can query like this SELECT *
FROM subscription
JOIN delivery ON (delivery.subscription_fk = delivery.subscription_pk)
 Note: I can write something like this: SELECT *
FROM subscription
JOIN delivery ON (delivery.magazine_id = subscription.magazine_id
              AND delivery.user_id = subscription.user_id)
 However, I am under the impression that there is a less verbose way to achieve this.
@CODE:CREATE TABLE subscription (
   magazine_id bigint,
   user_id     bigint,
   PRIMARY KEY (magazine_id, user_id)
)

CREATE TABLE delivery (
   magazine_id bigint,
   user_id     bigint,
   FOREIGN KEY (subscription) REFERENCES subscription (magazine_id, user_id)
) PRIMARY KEY (magazine_id, user_id) SELECT *
FROM subscription
JOIN delivery ON (delivery.subscription_fk = delivery.subscription_pk) SELECT *
FROM subscription
JOIN delivery ON (delivery.magazine_id = subscription.magazine_id
              AND delivery.user_id = subscription.user_id)

I'm surprised, I thought it was possible, but I didn't find any info on php's docs on this, neither on the web. Any clarification / alternative is welcome! Note : I'm using php 5.3.6 / 5.3.8 (dev/prod) Example : Consider this prepared statement : INSERT INTO table VALUES (:param1, 0), (:param1, 1);

@TITLE:How do I get the most accurate time with Android?
@CONTENT:I really don't think this question is a duplicate. Most answers to similar questions say to use System.currentTimeMillis() as the most accurate time, but I've noticed that two Android devices side-by-side may be off up to 5 seconds or more from each other or (more importantly) the real time, and I believe currentTimeMillis() will reflect that difference. So what I'm really looking for is a comprehensive solution to get the most accurate time possible in a given moment. For example, it would start with the GPS and, if that's not available or there's no signal, fall back to SNTP, or if that doesn't work ask Android to refresh its wall clock with via its own SNTP or carrier NITZ. My goal is accuracy within .1 seconds. Is that possible? Thanks.

@TITLE:Update breaking Sass framework - Incompatible units: 'px' and 'em'
@CONTENT:Something seems to have updated that is breaking compass or gumby. It was working perfectly until a few days ago until I updated my gems and gemfile. Now even when go back to the earlier gemfile it still gives me the error. I opened a detailed issue on it with details in a comment of how to recreate it here Does anyone know any better ways I can debug this problem? I literally can't move past it or do anything. Suspected lines of code From a full stack trace I can see that the error is coming from this line in compass which seems to get its variables from this line in Gumby Minimum amount of code The minimum amount of code needed to reproduce the error is an installation of Gumby, which is already installed in a project here and my gemfile which includes rails 4.0.

@TITLE:Does Qt support forked processes
@CONTENT:When I fork() in a Qt application, what parts of Qt behave sane? Does Qt support this? Obviously, e.g. the GUI on MacOSX will not work because Cocoa itself does not support forked processes. But there are many other parts, e.g. the list of threads, etc. QCoreApplication::applicationPid() seems to return the wrong value. (According to here.) Or to put the question a bit different: I must fork() in my app and there are certain parts which might access Qt in the child process. Where do I need to take extra care, despite all the Qt GUI stuff?

@TITLE:reboot linux from a program
@CONTENT:This question has been asked before: How to restart Linux from inside a C++ program? However, none of the answers seem to work for me. Here's my problem: I have a program on a piece of hardware. I can log in as root and run it without any issues. However, if I login as a different user with root priveleges, the program executes fine but does not reboot as it should. It only shuts down the current Telnet session. To reboot, I've used system(reboot). So far I have tried: sync();
reboot(RB_POWER_OFF);
 And execl("/sbin/reboot","reboot",NULL,NULL);
 to no avail. (I'm not sure, if I've used execl correctly. It is the first time I use it. Please correct me if I messed up). Any help would be appreciated. Edit: /data/local/sbin # cat /etc/passwd
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/sh
service:54zljpSAe:0:0:root:/root:/data/local/sbin/script
 if I login as service, "script" will be run. The user has a list options to choose from. One of the options is to run the above mentioned program. Edit: Also worth mentioning: One of the options in the script is to reboot the system. If called from inside the script, it works. But I would like to call reboot from the program.
@CODE:system(reboot) sync();
reboot(RB_POWER_OFF); execl("/sbin/reboot","reboot",NULL,NULL); execl /data/local/sbin # cat /etc/passwd

@TITLE:Cross domain Sails.js + Socket.io authorization
@CONTENT:I'm working in an application which delivers push content to a group of web applications hosted in different domains. I'm using Sails.js and Socket.io, and structured it like this: The client script, running on each web application's client's browser, is something like: socket.on('customEvent', function(message){
    //do something with message on event trigger
}
 And then, in the server, the event 'customEvent' is emitted when needed, and it works (e.g. on the onConnect event: sails.io.emit('customEvent',{message ...}). But I'm facing a problem when it comes to handle authorization. The first approach I've tried is a cookie-based auth, as explained here (by changing the api/config/sockets.js function authorizeAttemptedSocketConnection), but it isn't a proper solution for production and it isn't supported in browsers with a more restrictive cookie policy (due to their default prohibition to third-party cookies). My question is: how to implement a proper cross-browser and cross-domain authorization mechanism using sails.js, that can be supported in socket.io's authorization process? ====== More details: I also tried adding a login with a well-known oauth provider (e.g. facebook), using this example as a base. I've got the Passport session, but I'm still unable to authenticate from the client script (it only works in pages hosted by my node app directly). A JSONP request to obtain the session might be a solution, but it didn't work well in Safari. Plus I prefer the user to be authenticated in one of the web apps, rather than in my node application directly.

@TITLE:executing glmnet in parallel in R
@CONTENT:My training dataset has about 200,000 records and I have 500 features. (These are sales data from a retail org). Most of the features are 0/1 and is stored as a sparse matrix. The goal is to predict the probability to buy for about 200 products. So, I would need to use the same 500 features to predict the probability of purchase for 200 products. Since glmnet is a natural choice for model creation, I thought about implementing glmnet in parallel for the 200 products. (Since all the 200 models are independent) But I am stuck using foreach. The code I executed was: foreach(i = 1:ncol(target)) %dopar%
{
assign(model[i],cv.glmnet(x,target[,i],family="binomial",alpha=0,type.measure="auc",grouped=FALSE,standardize=FALSE,parallel=TRUE))
}
 model is a list - having the list of 200 model names where I want to store the respective models. The following code works. But it doesn't exploit the parallel structure and takes about a day to finish ! for(i in 1:ncol(target))
{ assign(model[i],cv.glmnet(x,target[,i],family="binomial",alpha=0,type.measure="auc",grouped=FALSE,standardize=FALSE,parallel=TRUE))
}
 Can someone point to me on how to exploit the parallel structure in this case?

@TITLE:floating point product expansion equivalence
@CONTENT:In IEEE 754 floating point, it is possible that a*(b-c) != a*b-a*c // a, b, c double
 So expansion of a product is not guaranteed to be equal to the unexpanded product. But what about this: a*(b1+b2+...+bn) == a*b1+a*b2+...+a*bn // b1==b2==...==bn
 When all b equal, is equivalence guaranteed (in case of no under-/overflow)? Is there a difference if equality of b is known at compile time or not? Edit: It is not - see Eric Postpischil and Pascal Cuoq. But maybe holds the weaker assertion?:    (1.0/n)*(b1+b2+...+bn) <= 1.0
&& (1.0/n)*b1+(1.0/n)*b2+...+(1.0/n)*bn <= 1.0

// when all b<=1.0 and n integral double but not power of 2
// so that 1.0/n not exactly representable with base-2 floating point
 I simply wonder if you can guarantee that the average of a data set does not exceed some value that is also not exceeded by every single data value, no matter how you compute the average (first adding and once dividing, or adding every value divided). Edit2: Ok, the && doesn't hold. See Eric Postpischil and David Hammen: average of nine 1.0 -> only first condition is true, second exceeds.
average of ten 1.0/3 -> only second condition is true, first exceeds.
 Is then the optimal method of computation of an average dependent of upper expected limit of data set? Or also of size (that means n) of data set? Or is there no optimal method surely existing?
@CODE:a*(b-c) != a*b-a*c // a, b, c double a*(b1+b2+...+bn) == a*b1+a*b2+...+a*bn // b1==b2==...==bn b b (1.0/n)*(b1+b2+...+bn) <= 1.0

    [Route("{username?}", Order = 3)]
    public ActionResult Index()
    {
        // ... bunch of stuff
    }
}
 Base on the code above, HomeController.Index() action method should be invoked using the following requests: domain/ domain/{username} domain/home/ domain/home/{username} domain/home/index/ domain/home/index/{username} Second Controller: [Authorize(Roles = "Member")]
[Route("profile/{action=index}")]
public class ProfileController : Controller
{
    [Route("profile")]
    public ActionResult Index()
    {

    }
}
 The ProfileController.Index() should be invoked using the following request. domain/profile domain/profile/index The problem From the examples, if I send domain/profile in the url, an ambiguity exception is thrown. It seems that there is an ambiguity between domain/{username} and domain/profile. Now, if I used convention-based routing, this would have worked (first match wins). But can it be done in MVC5 Attribute Routing? because I found that a third party library supports precedence among controllers https://github.com/mccalltd/AttributeRouting/wiki/Controlling-Route-Precedence routes.MapAttributeRoutes(config =>
{
    config.AddRoutesFromController<ProfileController>();
    config.AddRoutesFromController<HomeController>();
});
@CODE:[Route("home/{action=index}/{username?}")]
public class HomeController : Controller
{
    [Route("home/index/{username?}", Order = 1)]
    [Route("home/{username?}", Order = 2)]
    [Route("{username?}", Order = 3)]
    public ActionResult Index()
    {
        // ... bunch of stuff
    }
} HomeController.Index() [Authorize(Roles = "Member")]
[Route("profile/{action=index}")]
public class ProfileController : Controller
{
    [Route("profile")]
    public ActionResult Index()
    {

    }
} ProfileController.Index() domain/profile domain/{username} domain/profile routes.MapAttributeRoutes(config =>
{
    config.AddRoutesFromController<ProfileController>();
    config.AddRoutesFromController<HomeController>();

@TITLE:ASP.NET Timer only works in debug mode
@CONTENT:I am using the ajax timer control inside an update panel. <asp:UpdatePanel ID="UpdatePanel1" runat="server">
    <ContentTemplate>

 The timer should update the label every second with the current datetime.     protected void Timer1_Tick(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        Label1.Text = DateTime.Now.ToString();
    }
 Everything works fine in debug mode but when I run the site without debugger (CTRL+F5) or if I deploy the site to my server the timer does not tick. But when I add "debug=true" to the web.config everything works fine. Even on my server. <compilation targetFramework="4.0" debug="true">
 Internet Explorer throws the exception "Object doesn't support this action" in ScriptResource.axd. How can I solve this issue? EDIT: I think I have solved it. I don't know why but two things can solve this issue: Using a ScriptManager instead of a ToolScriptManager Using the ToolScriptManager with CombineScripts="false" I have no clue if this is a bug or not. Maybe somebody can explain it.

@TITLE:Why I cannot pass a functor defined in a function to another function?
@CONTENT:I found the functor can be used to simulate defining a function within a function like this using namespace std;
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    struct MYINC {
        int operator()(int a) { return a+1; }
    } myinc;
    vector<int> vec;
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) vec.push_back(myinc(i));
    return 0;
}
 But If I passed it to an outside function, such as std::transform like the following example, I've got a compiling error saying error: no matching function for call to ¡¥transform(std::vector<int>::iterator, std::vector<int>::iterator, std::vector<int>::iterator, main(int, char**)::MYINC&)¡¦ using namespace std;
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    struct MYINC{
        int operator()(int a) { return a+1; }
    } myinc;
    vector<int> vec;
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) vec.push_back(i);
    transform(vec.begin(), vec.end(), vec.begin(), myinc);
    return 0;
}
 So I put the definition outside the main function and all is OK now. using namespace std;
struct MYINC{
    int operator()(int a) { return a+1; }
} myinc;
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    vector<int> vec;

 What is a good way to query for deliveries given a particular subscription? Is there a way to assign a column name to PRIMARY KEY (magazine_id, user_id) and the corresponding foreign key so that I can query like this SELECT *
FROM subscription
JOIN delivery ON (delivery.subscription_fk = delivery.subscription_pk)
 Note: I can write something like this: SELECT *
FROM subscription
JOIN delivery ON (delivery.magazine_id = subscription.magazine_id
              AND delivery.user_id = subscription.user_id)
 However, I am under the impression that there is a less verbose way to achieve this.

@TITLE:How do I get the most accurate time with Android?
@CONTENT:I really don't think this question is a duplicate. Most answers to similar questions say to use System.currentTimeMillis() as the most accurate time, but I've noticed that two Android devices side-by-side may be off up to 5 seconds or more from each other or (more importantly) the real time, and I believe currentTimeMillis() will reflect that difference. So what I'm really looking for is a comprehensive solution to get the most accurate time possible in a given moment. For example, it would start with the GPS and, if that's not available or there's no signal, fall back to SNTP, or if that doesn't work ask Android to refresh its wall clock with via its own SNTP or carrier NITZ. My goal is accuracy within .1 seconds. Is that possible? Thanks.

@CONTENT:When I fork() in a Qt application, what parts of Qt behave sane? Does Qt support this? Obviously, e.g. the GUI on MacOSX will not work because Cocoa itself does not support forked processes. But there are many other parts, e.g. the list of threads, etc. QCoreApplication::applicationPid() seems to return the wrong value. (According to here.) Or to put the question a bit different: I must fork() in my app and there are certain parts which might access Qt in the child process. Where do I need to take extra care, despite all the Qt GUI stuff?

@CONTENT:This question has been asked before: How to restart Linux from inside a C++ program? However, none of the answers seem to work for me. Here's my problem: I have a program on a piece of hardware. I can log in as root and run it without any issues. However, if I login as a different user with root priveleges, the program executes fine but does not reboot as it should. It only shuts down the current Telnet session. To reboot, I've used system(reboot). So far I have tried: sync();
reboot(RB_POWER_OFF);
 And execl("/sbin/reboot","reboot",NULL,NULL);
 to no avail. (I'm not sure, if I've used execl correctly. It is the first time I use it. Please correct me if I messed up). Any help would be appreciated. Edit: /data/local/sbin # cat /etc/passwd
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/sh
service:54zljpSAe:0:0:root:/root:/data/local/sbin/script
 if I login as service, "script" will be run. The user has a list options to choose from. One of the options is to run the above mentioned program. Edit: Also worth mentioning: One of the options in the script is to reboot the system. If called from inside the script, it works. But I would like to call reboot from the program.

@TITLE:Cross domain Sails.js + Socket.io authorization
@CONTENT:I'm working in an application which delivers push content to a group of web applications hosted in different domains. I'm using Sails.js and Socket.io, and structured it like this: The client script, running on each web application's client's browser, is something like: socket.on('customEvent', function(message){
    //do something with message on event trigger
}
 And then, in the server, the event 'customEvent' is emitted when needed, and it works (e.g. on the onConnect event: sails.io.emit('customEvent',{message ...}). But I'm facing a problem when it comes to handle authorization. The first approach I've tried is a cookie-based auth, as explained here (by changing the api/config/sockets.js function authorizeAttemptedSocketConnection), but it isn't a proper solution for production and it isn't supported in browsers with a more restrictive cookie policy (due to their default prohibition to third-party cookies). My question is: how to implement a proper cross-browser and cross-domain authorization mechanism using sails.js, that can be supported in socket.io's authorization process? ====== More details: I also tried adding a login with a well-known oauth provider (e.g. facebook), using this example as a base. I've got the Passport session, but I'm still unable to authenticate from the client script (it only works in pages hosted by my node app directly). A JSONP request to obtain the session might be a solution, but it didn't work well in Safari. Plus I prefer the user to be authenticated in one of the web apps, rather than in my node application directly.

@TITLE:executing glmnet in parallel in R
@CONTENT:My training dataset has about 200,000 records and I have 500 features. (These are sales data from a retail org). Most of the features are 0/1 and is stored as a sparse matrix. The goal is to predict the probability to buy for about 200 products. So, I would need to use the same 500 features to predict the probability of purchase for 200 products. Since glmnet is a natural choice for model creation, I thought about implementing glmnet in parallel for the 200 products. (Since all the 200 models are independent) But I am stuck using foreach. The code I executed was: foreach(i = 1:ncol(target)) %dopar%
{
assign(model[i],cv.glmnet(x,target[,i],family="binomial",alpha=0,type.measure="auc",grouped=FALSE,standardize=FALSE,parallel=TRUE))
}
 model is a list - having the list of 200 model names where I want to store the respective models. The following code works. But it doesn't exploit the parallel structure and takes about a day to finish ! for(i in 1:ncol(target))
{ assign(model[i],cv.glmnet(x,target[,i],family="binomial",alpha=0,type.measure="auc",grouped=FALSE,standardize=FALSE,parallel=TRUE))
}
 Can someone point to me on how to exploit the parallel structure in this case?

@TITLE:knitr: Knitting separate Rnw documents within an Rmd document
@CONTENT:I have a master R markdown document (Rmd) within which I would like to knit several separate Rnw documents (NO child documents) in one of the chunks. However, when I call knit on the Rnw document, the contained R code chunks do not seem to be processed, resulting in an error when trying to run texi2pdf on them. Illustration of the situation: Inside master.Rmd: ```{r my_chunk, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='asis'}

... some code ...

knit("sub.**Rnw**", output = ..., quiet = TRUE)

tools::texi2pdf(tex_file)

```
 Is there some additional configuration required to make this scenario work?

@TITLE:floating point product expansion equivalence
@CONTENT:In IEEE 754 floating point, it is possible that a*(b-c) != a*b-a*c // a, b, c double
 So expansion of a product is not guaranteed to be equal to the unexpanded product. But what about this: a*(b1+b2+...+bn) == a*b1+a*b2+...+a*bn // b1==b2==...==bn
 When all b equal, is equivalence guaranteed (in case of no under-/overflow)? Is there a difference if equality of b is known at compile time or not? Edit: It is not - see Eric Postpischil and Pascal Cuoq. But maybe holds the weaker assertion?:    (1.0/n)*(b1+b2+...+bn) <= 1.0
&& (1.0/n)*b1+(1.0/n)*b2+...+(1.0/n)*bn <= 1.0

// when all b<=1.0 and n integral double but not power of 2
// so that 1.0/n not exactly representable with base-2 floating point
 I simply wonder if you can guarantee that the average of a data set does not exceed some value that is also not exceeded by every single data value, no matter how you compute the average (first adding and once dividing, or adding every value divided). Edit2: Ok, the && doesn't hold. See Eric Postpischil and David Hammen: average of nine 1.0 -> only first condition is true, second exceeds.
average of ten 1.0/3 -> only second condition is true, first exceeds.
 Is then the optimal method of computation of an average dependent of upper expected limit of data set? Or also of size (that means n) of data set? Or is there no optimal method surely existing?
@CODE:a*(b-c) != a*b-a*c // a, b, c double a*(b1+b2+...+bn) == a*b1+a*b2+...+a*bn // b1==b2==...==bn b b (1.0/n)*(b1+b2+...+bn) <= 1.0
&& (1.0/n)*b1+(1.0/n)*b2+...+(1.0/n)*bn <= 1.0

@LINK:/questions/21637556/datetime-tryparse-cannot-parse-datetime-minvalue
@TITLE:DateTime.TryParse cannot parse DateTime.MinValue
@CONTENT:I'm using a library called Json.NET that uses the following code internally to parse a JSON string into a DateTime: if (DateTime.TryParse(s, Culture, DateTimeStyles.RoundtripKind, out dt))
{
     dt = DateTimeUtils.EnsureDateTime(dt, DateTimeZoneHandling);
     SetToken(JsonToken.Date, dt);
     return dt;
}
 I thought Json.NET was screwing up the conversion, but it looks like it's DateTime.TryParse itself that's botching the value. When I parse the following valid Iso date (which corresponds to UTC DateTime.MinValue): string json = "0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00";
DateTime dt;
DateTime.TryParse(json, invariantCulture, DateTimeStyles.RoundtripKind, out dt);
 The result is a localized DateTime: {0001-01-01 8:00:00 PM}, which when converted back to Utc time gives {0001-01-02 0:00:00 PM}. Essentially, the date underflowed, which is exactly the kind of problem you would expect DateTimeStyles.RoundtripKind to avoid. How do I avoid this scenario?

@TITLE:Making swipe work for a pivot control with embedded WebBrowser on Windows Phone 8.0
@CONTENT:I'd like my application to have a Pivot control with a WebBrowser control in each PivotItem. The problem is that swiping to next PivotItem doesn't work since it instead results in scrolling the web page horizontally. However, the web pages are responsive and doesn't need to be scrolled horizontally so instead I want horizontal swiping to result in a pivot switch. Can this be accomplished? If I can't use a Pivot control what is the recommended way to implement page switching with WebControls on the pages? A top menu a la iOS/Android?

@TITLE:Mirroring - server network address cannot be reached or does not exist
@CONTENT:I have read a number of articles on how to configure mirroring on SQL Server 2012. I went through the steps and everything worked until hitting the final step, which didn't work. When I run this on the Principal: ALTER DATABASE MyDBName SET PARTNER = 'TCP://1.2.3.4:5022'; I get this error: The server network address "TCP://1.2.3.4:5022" can not be reached or does not exist. When I run the counterpart ALTER statement shown above, but on the Mirror, it works fine. I have tried all the steps in this troubleshooting article. Important points: The Primary and Mirror servers are in different datacenters, not on the same network at all. Not connected by VPN. Completely untrusted by each other. I can connect to the Mirror via SSMS on the Primary and run queries. And vice versa. I configured certificates on each server to establish the trust relationship. Everything worked during the setup and config, no errors. I configured the endpoints on both servers and verified they're active/enabled. I opened port 5022 on both servers by configuring incoming and outgoing windows firewall rules. I can telnet to the Mirror from the Principal and vice versa - ports appear open, no problems. In the troubleshooting guide mentioned above, I tried steps 1-6. I didn't try 7, deleting the endpoints and re-creating, because they look perfectly valid and active to me. Looking for some ideas on this one.

@TITLE:Using xattr to set the Mac OSX quarantine property
@CONTENT:There is a lot of information on StackOverflow and elsewhere about how to clear the Mac quarantine property. In my case I would like to set it. This is in order to test that my app is properly signed so that the user will hot get the "Untrusted Developer" warning after downloading it. My app is particularly large (we distribute from a large file download site, not the store) and it is not convenient to have to upload and download to test this. I have had some battles with code signing the past week so this testing is important to me. Once a file has the quarantine property I see how I can alter it to have the values: 0002 = downloaded but never opened (this is the one that causes the warning)
0022 = app aborted by user from the warning dialogue (you hit 'cancel' in the dialogue)
0062 = app opened (at least) once (you hit 'open' in the dialogue)
 But I don't know how to give it the property in the first place.

@TITLE:PyQt Widget connect() and disconnect()
@CONTENT:Depending on a conditions I would like to connect/re-connect a button to a different function. Let's say I have a button: myButton = QtGui.QPushButton()
 For this example let's say I check if there is an internet connection. if connected == True:
    myButton.clicked.connect(function_A)

elif connected == False:
    myButton.clicked.connect(function_B)
 First of all I would like to disconnect a button from any function it was already connected before the button is being re-assigned/re-connected to another function (function_A or function_B). Secondly, I have already noticed that after the button is re-connected it takes an extra click for the button to pick up a new function. After the button is re-connected to another function it still attempts to run a previous function - a function to which a button was connected earlier (before a re-connection). Please advice. Thanks in advance! EDITED LATER: It appears a widget's .disconnect() method can be used to disconnect a button from a function it it is connected. myButton.disconnect()
 Unfortunately .disconnect() throws an error if a widget is not connected to any function. To get around it I am using Try/Except. But I would rather use a more elegant solution... try: myButton.clicked.disconnect() 
except Exception: pass
@CODE:myButton = QtGui.QPushButton() if connected == True:
    myButton.clicked.connect(function_A)

@TITLE:C++, OpenCV : Assertion failed in Resize
@CONTENT:As a C++ beginner, I am currently facing a problem I somehow can't solve, even if the code is pretty simple. I've been searching for answers all over the Internet, but none was applicable for my problem. I am currently coding basic SVMs with C++, under VS2013, using OpenCV 2.4.8. I was able to work on images of same size, specifying fixed height, width at the beginning of my code. Now, I'm trying to : open images of different sizes, resize them to a certain lower size, and apply the previous code to the now-resized dataset. Simple as that. Here's the beginning of my code : #include <opencv2/core/core.hpp>
#include <opencv2/highgui/highgui.hpp>
#include <opencv2/imgproc/imgproc.hpp>
#include <opencv2/ml/ml.hpp>
#include <iostream>
#include <math.h>
#include <fstream>
#include <string>
#include <sstream>
#include <windows.h>

using namespace cv;
using namespace std;

int main(){
 Input parameters are : int Nb_Data_Class_1 = 10;
int Nb_Data_Class_0 = 5;
int Height_Zone = 200;
int Width_Zone = 200;
 so I will resize all my files to 200x200 format. string Path = "C:\\Users\\....";
string Format = ".jpg";

int Nb_Files = Nb_Data_Class_1 + Nb_Data_Class_0;
Mat TrainingMat(Nb_Files, Zone_Image, CV_32FC1);
Mat TrainingLabels(Nb_Files, 1, CV_32FC1);
 For every file of the class labelled {1} - they are all named Tree01, Tree02, etc. - I open, and resize. for (int i = 0; i < Nb_Data_Class_1; ++i)
{
    stringstream ss;
    ss << Path << "\\Tree0" << i + 1 << Format;
    Mat Image = cv::imread(ss.str(), 0);
    resize(Image, Image, Size(Width_Zone, Height_Zone));}
 Things worked perfectly without the last line. I had a Mat array, filled with 0-t0-255 numbers. Now, I get the following error : OpenCV Error: Assertion failed >0> in cv::resize, file C:\builds\2-4-PackSlave-win32-vc12-shared\opencv\modules\imgproc\serc\imgwarp.cpp, line 1824 What could be the problem ? I thought that maybe OpenCV wasn't properly opening the files ; but, in that case, how everything could have been previously working ? Still wondering. Any help would be much appreciated ! Thanks in advance.

 As you can see in the above example, if f is called in A's enclosing namespace scope, the compiler just can't find f, which gives me the idea that f is not in this scope. But when an out-of-calss definition of a function with the same signature is added, the compiler issues an error of function redefinition, which gives me the opposite idea that f is actually in this scope. So, I'm puzzled which scope an in-class-defined friend function belongs to.
@CODE:class A {
    friend void f() {}
};

// void f() {}  // compile error: redifinition of 'void f()'

@TITLE:Authenticate HTML5 application wrapped with Phonegap (or equivalent)
@CONTENT:Is there a way, using JavaScript only (client side), to ensure that an HTTP request is actually coming from my Phonegap application? Be aware: I'm not talking about authenticating the user, rather, in a sense, about authenticating the app itself. There isn't (and mustn't be) any kind of user interaction related to this. Not even talking about confidentiality of the communication (I'm not using HTTPS and the payload is not encrypted). My guess is, in the end, this inevitably requires some sort of hard-coded key. The problem is, as you can see for example here, such a key would be usually accessible by almost anyone - and this problem comes up not only with Javascript assets, but also with Java in Android. If no way with Phonegap or any Cordova plugin, could you suggest an equivalent framework (or environment like Icenium) that could make this thing possible? Or, at last, would there be any real risk in not taking this precaution for the aforesaid scenario? EDIT: Kurt Du Bois reminded me I did not mention SSL client authentication. Be it applicable/convenient or not, it always ends up to the problem of keeping a private key secret. I find this is well described here, and summed up in the sentence: "the assurance that the key hasn't been exported is only as strong as the key store itself".

I'm pretty sure I read somewhere in the past that AllowsTransparency = true would force WPF to render in software-mode. However, I've read elsewhere that with window layering you can have hardware acceleration and this is what WPF does. I also find it hard to imagine that Visual Studio 2013 -with its custom frame and transparent border blur- would be software-rendered. Is there a definitive answer to the question (assuming Windows 7 onwards), Is WPF Hardware-accelerated when Window AllowsTransparency = true? If not, how does Visual Studio pull it off?

 Now, I'm facing difficulty porting it to Hibernate Query Language. I've tried many variations, but I'm unable to get epoch from date difference. This certainly doesn't work: "FROM SomeEntity " +
"WHERE someAttribute = :attr " +
"AND epoch(localtimestamp - deviceInfo.storageTime) / 3600 > :threshold_hour";

@TITLE:Sift Implementation :: Keypoints from different octaves
@CONTENT:I am trying to implement SIFT in MATLAB. I have obtained keypoints for (say) 4 different octaves by locating local maxima and minima in DOG (difference of gaussian) space. However I am at loss at what to do with the keypoints from the last 3 octaves. Do I include them in keypoints for the original image, if yes then how do I do the translation from the reduced image to the original e.g pixel (i,j) in 256 x 256 image(2nd octave) to pixel(i',j') in 512x512 image (1st octave). I tried many sift tutorials but didn't find anything conclusive.

@TITLE:Is a reference in a View to a ViewModel (which is its DataContext) in any way detrimental to MVVM pattern?
@CONTENT:Let's say a ViewModel publishes an Event and a View which is using that VM as its DataContext subscribes to that Event by obtaining a reference to the VM by casting its DataContext to VM instance: vm = DataContext as MainViewModel;
if (vm == null) return;
vm.SomeUIRelatedNotice += DoSomethingUIRelated;
 The way I see this, the VM ramains decoupled and its testability is in no way affected, and the View already has a reference to the VM so I see no problem with this at all but I want to hear from the MVVM purists if they think this is bad design with negative impact on the MVVM pattern and if so why?

@TITLE:Is there a way to hide figure captions when using knitr and pandoc to create docx files?
@CONTENT:I am using knitr and pandoc to write reports into word (we need to be able to circulate for comments using track changes etc). It is working very well so far, but I have found that the plots are all coming out with captions at the bottom, and I don't want captions. While I could just delete them in the word doc, if I can stop them showing in the code it would be better. So for the following code in markdown: Test test test

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(cars)
```
 I then run the following code in R: library("knitr")

# Stackoverflow table test 1.html

knit2html("captiontest.rmd")

FILE <- "captiontest"

system(paste0("pandoc -o ", FILE, ".docx ", FILE, ".md"))
 And the graph, in the word document, has the caption "plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-2" I know I can change this caption, e.g. {r fig.width=7, fig.height=6, fig.cap='hello'}, but I thought that fig.cap=NULL would make it hidden. Instead it seems to make the whole plot disappear. Are plots required to have a caption - do I just have to go through each word doc and delete them manually? Or is there a way to hide them?

@TITLE:Breeze using angular $http interceptor
@CONTENT:I use a angular $http interceptor, to check if a ajax request returns 401 (not authenticated). If response is 401, the original request gets queued, a login form is shown and after login successfully, it retries the queued requests. This already works with $http, and the source for the angular interceptor is: define('common.service.security.interceptor', ['angular'], function() {
'use strict';

angular.module('common.service.security.interceptor', ['common.service.security.retryQueue'])

.factory('securityInterceptor', [
    '$injector',
    '$location',
    'securityRetryQueue',
    function($injector, $location, securityRetryQueue) {

        return function(promise) {

            var $http = $injector.get('$http');


            // catch the erroneous requests
            return promise.then(null, function(originalResponse){
                if(originalResponse.status === 401){
                    promise = securityRetryQueue.pushRetryFn('Unauthorized', function retryRequest(){
                        return $injector.get('$http')(originalResponse.config);
                    });
                }

                 return promise;
            });
        };
    }
])

// register the interceptor to the angular http service. method)
.config(['$httpProvider', function($httpProvider) {
    $httpProvider.responseInterceptors.push('securityInterceptor');

}]);});
 How can I make breeze request using this angular $http interceptor? Breeze provides a wrapper for the angular $http service in the file "Breeze/Adapters/breeze.ajax.angular.js". So the first idea was to tell breeze to use it: breeze.config.initializeAdapterInstance("ajax", "angular", true);
 Debugging angular.js, it shows that breeze now in fact uses $http, but it does not execute the above registered interceptor. Inside $http, there is an array "reversedInterceptors", which holds the registered interceptors. I log this array to console. If i use $http, the length of this array is one (as expected), but when making request with breeze, this array is empty. The question is, how can i use this $http interceptor with breeze requests? Here is the code for breeze.ajax.angular.js, provided by breeze define('breeze.ajax.angular.module', ['breeze', 'angular'], function (breeze) {

@CONTENT:I found out there is a new component in LibGDX in nightly builds - TextArea which is part of the scene2d.ui package. It's nice to have a component like this, very easy to use, but what I'm missing is some support for a multi-colored text. I want to highlight some keywords in a text with a different color but I don't know how to do it with current api. There is one method in BitmapFontCache class: public void setColors (Color tint, int start, int end)
 Javadoc for this method says following: Sets the color of the specified characters. This may only be called after setText(CharSequence, float, float) and is reset every time setText is called. But I don't know how to use it through TextArea object or if it's even possible to do it that way. Someone who tried to figure it out? Every hint will be appreciated.

@TITLE:VBA automation of Excel leaves a process in memory after Quit
@CONTENT:I have seen a lot of suggestions for this problem, and I have tried them all, but none seem to work. The VBA code is in a non-Microsoft product (SAP Business Objects, which might be the problem). I create an Excel object: Set oExcel = CreateObject("Excel.Application") Load the contents from column 1 of one of the WorkSheets in a particular workbook, then close Excel. Each time, it leaves a process in memory, taking up 5+ mb of memory. I tried making the oExcel object visible, so that at least I could kill it without resorting to the Task Manager, but when I call Quit, the UI quits, and still leaves the process. Every time I run the code, it creates a new process. So I tried to reuse any existing Excel processes by calling Set m_oExcel = GetObject(, "Excel.Application") and only creating it if that call returns nothing, That did not proliferate the processes, but the single process grew by 5+ mb each time, so essentially the same problem. In each case, I close the workbook I opened and set DisplayAlerts to False before quitting: m_oBook.Close SaveChanges:=False
m_oExcel.DisplayAlerts = False
m_oExcel.Quit
 This bit of code has been in use for at least five years, but this problem did not crop up until we moved to Windows 7. Here is the full code in case it helps. Note all the Excel objects are module level variables ("m_" prefix) per one suggestion, and I have used the "one-dot" rule per another suggestion. I also tried using generic objects (i.e. late bound) but that did not resolve the problem either: Private Function GetVariablesFromXLS(ByVal sFile As String) As Boolean

See, I have a need to display the current serving Spring Controller from a JSP page. The name doesn't have to be parsed in the JSP itself, I'm actually using another class (a kind of taglibrary) to display this information on the bottom of ever page. Is there a way to get the controller name from an outside class? (When i say outside, I mean from another class than the Controller itself.) Perhaps from the request somehow? (Or some Spring Security request attribute?). Perhaps an interceptor? I would like to avoid extending a class from the controller just to fix this issue. Any advice is appriciated!

@CONTENT:I am building a Wordpress website with two language support English and Danish. I want to keep the language code string en for English and da for Danish prepended in request uri. Like: (Currently this is working for me) http://example.com/da
 If i visit post or page, it should be map like this: (This is not working, getting 404) http://example.com/da/post-name
http://example.com/da/page-name
http://example.com/da/post/is/too/long
 I have also tried Wordpress Rewrite API add_rewrite_rule() (Rewrite rules currently i have) <?php
add_action('init', function () {    
    add_rewrite_rule(
        '^(da|en)/?', //Regex
        'index.php?lang=$matches[1]', //request to
        'top' //called earlier than wordpress rules
    );
});
 and also add_rewrite_tag(), but i think Wordpress just provide an add_rewrite_endpoint (and i don't need this at all). I think it may only be possible with htaccess %{QUERY_STRING} conditions? (Don't know) .htaccess contents: <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteRule ^index\.php$ - [L]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.php [L]
</IfModule>
# END WordPress
 Edit: I'm using WP Native Dashboard for translation on admin pages however on front i'm just using __() and _e() with .mo and .po files and its working perfectly. P.S: This problem is not specific to Wordpress website, I also need this help with custom based websites in future. Provide me .htaccess rules/conditions if you can.

@TITLE:Reading arabic data text in R and plot()
@CONTENT:R appears not to handle arabic text very well. Though it is possible to type some arabic strings like Names <- c("????", "????", "????").
 Now I use word or excel to write longer lists of name and save the file as text. I can import the file in R (RStudio) and display correctly the imported data. However, I can not manipulate the imported list. Plotting for example produces funny characters. why directly typed lists (not easy at all) can be plotted but not the imported list? I am using windows 7, R v.3.0.2, and RStudio to read the file. Any help on using arabic text in R will be appreciated. Thanks

I tried Heroku's password, my Windows account password, every password I use, but nothing happens. I checked, and "Hanan" is not a role in Postgresql, so trying to change the password through psql doesn't work. I have no problem logging in to Postgresql through other roles, but it's this 'default' log-in process which I can't seem to crack. Also, since I'm using windows, I'm not sure how to run commands like sudo -u postgres psql, which I see as a possible solution. Will appreciate any help regarding this issue, I'm really frustrated by now...

My project contains the default Web.Release.config transformation that should remove the Web.config attribute /configuration/system.web/compilation/@debug which should (amongst others) enable script bundling. It appears the web.config transformation is not executed during deployment, so I guess it doesn't use the Release configuration during build/deployment.

@CONTENT:For years I used RVM as my Ruby version manager, but I want to switch to rbenv for its simplicity. However I'm finding some strange problems deploying. Here's where it seems to go wrong: # env RBENV_ROOT=\"/home/deploy/.rbenv\" PATH=\"/home/deploy/.rbenv/shims:/home/deploy/.rbenv/bin:$PATH\"  /home/deploy/.rbenv/bin/rbenv exec bundle install --gemfile /domains/myapp.com/releases/20140119013611/Gemfile --path /domains/myapp.com/shared/bundle --deployment --without development test

 Okay, so I specify the rbenv version I want -- # env RBENV_ROOT=\"/home/deploy/.rbenv\" PATH=\"/home/deploy/.rbenv/shims:/home/deploy/.rbenv/bin:$PATH\" RBENV_VERSION=\"2.0.0-p353\" /home/deploy/.rbenv/bin/rbenv exec bundle install --gemfile /domains/myapp.com/releases/20140119013611/Gemfile --path /domains/myapp.com/shared/bundle --deployment --without development test

 Huh. That's weird. # rbenv versions
> system
> * 2.0.0-p353 (set by /home/deploy/.rbenv/version)
 Any idea where I'm going wrong? The bundle install command appears to think that 2.0.0-p353 is absent, but rbenv versions shows it. What might be up?
@CODE:# env RBENV_ROOT=\"/home/deploy/.rbenv\" PATH=\"/home/deploy/.rbenv/shims:/home/deploy/.rbenv/bin:$PATH\"  /home/deploy/.rbenv/bin/rbenv exec bundle install --gemfile /domains/myapp.com/releases/20140119013611/Gemfile --path /domains/myapp.com/shared/bundle --deployment --without development test

 });
 App.SubscriptionThread.Start();
 Once I start this I have no idea how to stop it. Things I've tried. Using the Thread.Abort. This apparently doesn't stop it, as the thread just goes into a hang then forever (no unsubscription happens). Using the _redisSubscription.UnSubscribeFromAllChannels() from the UI thread. This also causes the applicaiton to go into a blocking state forever Forcefully shutdown using Environment.Exit(0). This one seems to do the trick. Unfortunetly it also has the side effect of...well...shutting down my application. How do I go about just stopping the listening, so I can connect/reconnect at will? Am I doing it wrong by starting the SubscribeToChannels in a new thread?

 As you can see, the values in the many of the rows are repeats, for some of the columns. What I want to do is remove the duplicated rows, based on the value (the min) of the effRank variable. I have set the key to be chr, bp, and effRank. So the table should be sorted on the basis of those three columns. I got kind of close. The following command returns the rows that I want, but does not return all columns, which I want. > test[,min(effRank), by=pos]

 All I need is a way to make the above command return all columns in the data.table, not just the ones mentioned in the expressions. Otherwise, works perfectly. Any help is appreciated. The output of dput is below, for those that with to make their own example. Cheers, Davy > dput(test)

@CONTENT:My project was using Spring Security 3.2.0.RC2 and my JSP's used the Spring taglib's form:form tag to automatically insert the CSRF token into my forms. After upgrading to Spring Security 3.2.0.RELEASE, I'm finding that the form:form tag no longer automatically inserts the CSRF token into my form, and that I now must manually add it via placing this in my form: <input type="hidden" name="${_csrf.parameterName}" value="${_csrf.token}"/> Has anyone else encountered the same issue? If so, what did you do for a workaround? Thanks.

 Sample data: INSERT INTO tblTest ( Code, Name ) VALUES ( 'a1', 'name1' )
 Delphi code: ADOQuery.SQL.Text := 'SELECT * FROM tblTest WHERE sysId = :sysId';
AdoQuery.Parameters.ParseSQL(ADOQuery.SQL.Text,True);

AdoQuery.open;
 ConnectionString (database: MyDb) Provider=SQLOLEDB.1;Integrated Security=SSPI;Persist Security Info=False;Initial  Catalog=MyDb;Data Source=.
 as a solution i use this delphi code AdoQuery.Parameters.ParseSQL(ADOQuery.SQL.Text,false);

@TITLE:Share a Drive document without notifying user with Google Apps Script
@CONTENT:I am creating a workflow process in Apps Script where a Doc is generated from a template and shared with various users for approval. The Script sends a customised email notifying a user that the document requires their approval but they also receive a second email at each stage in the process from the user whose Drive the document is stored in saying "User has shared a document with you". Is there any way of disabling these alerts? When you share a document manually from your Drive, there is a checkbox option that allows you to choose whether or not the user receives a notification. However, I cannot find a way to disable this notification with Apps Script. I am using doc.addEditors(users) to share the document. Many Thanks

@TITLE:Construct url in view for Web Api with attribute routing
@CONTENT:How can I get the url from web api in my view? Example (from the msdn-blog): [RoutePrefix("reviews")]
public class ReviewsController : ApiController
{
    // eg.: /reviews
    [Route]
    public IHttpActionResult Get() { ... }
    // eg.: /reviews/5
    [Route("{reviewId}")]

    // eg.: /reviews/5/edit
    [Route("{reviewId}/edit")]
    public IHttpActionResult Edit(int reviewId) { ... }
}
 Now I want to construct "/reviews/edit" in my view, how can I do this? I've tried creating a little extension method, but it requires me to give every route an actual "RouteName". Is there a method I can use (like in MVC) where I can just pass the controller and action? @Url.Action("Edit", "Reviews)
 The method I'm using now (with RouteName) also doesn't allow me to use integers as parameters (unless I pass a default value). If I do need to name all my routes, how can I create a route url, but pass my parameters in the "data"-portion of my request? Current method: public static string ResolveWebApiRoute(this UrlHelper urlHelper, string routeName, object routeValues = null)
{
    var newRouteValues = new RouteValueDictionary(routeValues);
    newRouteValues.Add("httproute", true);

    return urlHelper.RouteUrl(routeName, newRouteValues);
}
 EDIT When I used methods like Url.RouteUrl(new { controller = ..., action = ...}), It redirects directly to that action (e.g. new { controller = "Reviews", action = "Show"} --> /reviews/show, whilest I want it to redirect to /reviews/...
@CODE:[RoutePrefix("reviews")]
public class ReviewsController : ApiController
{
    // eg.: /reviews
    [Route]
    public IHttpActionResult Get() { ... }

{
    var newRouteValues = new RouteValueDictionary(routeValues);
    newRouteValues.Add("httproute", true);

@TITLE:Create a JAR containing classes and resources from webapp using Gradle
@CONTENT:I would like to create a jar from the contents of a WAR using gradle. The result I want is quite like what the archiveClasses = true setting of maven-war-plugin does. I understand that the gradle war plugin doesn't seem to do this (as per this stackoverflow question). Is there a way to do this manually? Say by manipulating the gradle jar task to collect the required parts from the WEB-INF folder? When I just use the default jar task it doesn't get the resources from the WEB-INF directory. The reason I want to do this is because I have modularised a WAR and the modules depend on common resources in the WAR (FreeMarker files in my case). I want to be able to test each module by depending on JAR created from the WAR. I understand I could also create a "common" jar that held all the resources and have both the WAR and the module depend on this, but it would be more convenient to create a JAR form the WAR as per the maven-war-plugin.

@TITLE:Read free format with no advance
@CONTENT:In a given file record, I need to read the first two integer elements at first, and then the rest of the line (a large number of real elements), because the assignment depend on the first 2. Suppose the format of the first two integer elements is not really well defined. The best way to solve the problem could be something: read(unitfile, "(I0,I0)", advance='no') ii, jj
read(unitfile,*) aa(ii,jj,:)
 But it seems to me the "(I0)" specification is not allowed in gfortran. Basically the file read in unitfile could be something like: 0   0    <floats>
0   10   <floats>
10   0    <floats>
100   0    <floats>
100   100    <floats>
 which is hard to be read with any fortran-like fixed field format specification. Is there any other way to get around this, apparently trivial, problem?

@TITLE:Why does RKNSJSONSerialization crash on iOS 6?
@CONTENT:I'm seeing a crash in RKNSJSONSerialization on iOS 6 only - not on iOS 7. I'm using RestKit 0.20.3 and it happens fairly consistently for me. Even when I make the same request and get the same response for iOS 6/7, it works fine on iOS 7 but crashes on iOS 6. Here's the crash - it's an EXC_BAD_ACCESS: http://crashes.to/s/2610b639062 The relevant (crashing) line in RestKit's RKNSJSONSerialization is the return: + (id)objectFromData:(NSData *)data error:(NSError **)error
{
    return [NSJSONSerialization JSONObjectWithData:data options:0 error:error];
}
 So perhaps it's not RestKit at all - perhaps it's NSJSONSerialization. I profiled the app with the Zombies tool and found this: "An Objective-C message was sent to a deallocated 'CFString (immutable)' object (zombie) at address: 0x16851250." Am I doing something wrong?

@TITLE:assignment operator on empty inizializer_list
@CONTENT:can you explain how STL containers handle assignment operator with empty initializer list? when i'll do something like this: vector<int> v;
v = { };
 the function that is called is not: vector& operator= (initializer_list<value_type> il);
 but: vector& operator= (vector&& x);
 on the other hand, when i'll do something similar with my own class: struct A {
    A& operator= (const A&) { return *this; }
    A& operator= (A&&) { return *this; }
    A& operator= (initializer_list<int>) { return *this; }
};

/* ... */

A a;
a = { };
 the code does not compile on VS2013, and says: error C2593: 'operator =' is ambiguous
 if the list is not empty, it works fine, it just calls the function with initializer list. the problem appears only when the list is empty, on vector it calls the rvalue assignment operator, on my class it gives error. how this situation is handled in vector and other containers?
@CODE:vector<int> v;
v = { }; vector& operator= (initializer_list<value_type> il); vector& operator= (vector&& x); struct A {
    A& operator= (const A&) { return *this; }

@TITLE:Alternative dependencies in a Homebrew formula (e.g. for use with gcc)
@CONTENT:How can I describe alternative dependencies in a Homebrew formula? There are two different kinds I'm thinking of. 1. Alternative packages My formula can depend on package P or Q, but it must have one of them. So, I want either depends_on 'P'
 or depends_on 'Q'
 and I need at least one. 2. Alternative flags for the same package My formula requires another package X for building, and it needs a package X with one of two flags, A and B. That is, I want either depends_on 'X' => [:build, 'A']
 or depends_on 'X' => [:build, 'B']
 and I need at least one. Example A specific example of where these alternative dependencies would be useful is a formula depending on gcc. There are multiple packages for gcc (e.g. gcc4[3-9]), which could be supported by #1 above. gcc has a flag enable-all-languages which implies enable-java, so if a formula that requires gcj would use #2 to specify the alternative flags.
@CODE:P Q depends_on 'P' depends_on 'Q' X X A B depends_on 'X' => [:build, 'A'] depends_on 'X' => [:build, 'B'] gcc gcc gcc4[3-9] gcc enable-all-languages enable-java gcj

@LINK:/questions/21114933/avoid-creating-non-significant-white-space-text-nodes-when-creating-a-nokogiri
@TITLE:Avoid creating non-significant white space text nodes when creating a `Nokogiri::XML` or `Nokogiri::HTML` object
@CONTENT:I'll start off by explaining the motivation behind this. First of all, I would like to count the children of each node in a Nokogiri XML Document and access the first or last child that is not a non-significant white space. A non-significant white space text node is usually created when you are parsing an indented XML representation. For example, if you have the following XML: <note>
  <to>Tove</to>
  <from>Jani</from>
  <heading>Reminder</heading>
  <body>Don't forget me this weekend!</body>
</note>
 Whose string representation is as follows:  "<note>\n  <to>Tove</to>\n  <from>Jani</from>\n  <heading>Reminder</heading>\n  <body>Don't forget me this weekend!</body>\n</note>\n"
 When creating a Nokogiri::XML object from this string representation, you get the following Document created: #(Document:0x3fc07e4540d8 {
  name = "document",
  children = [
    #(Element:0x3fc07ec8629c {
      name = "note",
      children = [
        #(Text "\n  "),
        #(Element:0x3fc07ec8089c {
          name = "to",
          children = [ #(Text "Tove")]
          }),
        #(Text "\n  "),
        #(Element:0x3fc07e8d8064 {
          name = "from",
          children = [ #(Text "Jani")]
          }),
        #(Text "\n  "),
        #(Element:0x3fc07e8d588c {
          name = "heading",
          children = [ #(Text "Reminder")]
          }),
        #(Text "\n  "),
        #(Element:0x3fc07e8cf590 {
          name = "body",
          children = [ #(Text "Don't forget me this weekend!")]
          }),
        #(Text "\n")]
      })]
  })
 Here, you get lots white space nodes of type Nokogiri::XML::Text. Those are the nodes that I wish to not be parsed, or somehow find a way to make a distinction between those and the ones that are significant such as the text node that represents the string "Tove". EDIT: Just to be clear, I do not want the whitespace between a closing and an opening tag represented. Or, if I cannot avoid that, distinguish them from significant text nodes like tha text node inside the element <to>. EDIT 2: Here is an example rspec of something that I am looking for: require 'nokogiri'
require_relative 'spec_helper'

xml_text = <<XML
<note>
  <to>Tove</to>
  <from>Jani</from>
  <heading>Reminder</heading>
  <body>Don't forget me this weekend!</body>
</note>
XML

xml = Nokogiri::XML(xml_text)

def significant_nodes(node)
  return 0
end

describe "Stackoverflow Question" do
  it "should return the number of significant nodes in nokogiri." do
    expect(significant_nodes(xml.css('note'))).to eq 4
  end
end
 So essentially, I want to know how to create the significant_nodes function. EDIT 3: If I change the XML to: <note>
  <to>Tove</to>
  <from>Jani</from>
  <heading>Reminder</heading>
  <body>Don't forget me this weekend!</body>
  <footer></footer>
</note>
 Then when I create the Document, I still would like footer represented, so using the config.noblanks is not an option.
@CODE:children Document <note>
  <to>Tove</to>
  <from>Jani</from>
  <heading>Reminder</heading>

          name = "to",

 I read one post that said this was a permissions issue, and that the solution was to rebuild permissions using the Disk Utility app in Mac OS X. I have done that with no effect. Over the past few days, I have tried so many things, I can't keep track but, they all get about the same results. I have tried installing earlier versions, different versions (x86), and on and on. If anyone has a recommendation as to what else I might try I would really appreciate it. I would love to get MySQL working on this machine. It was on my machine and working at one point but, I uninstalled it because of some problems I was having long ago. Now, I can't get it to work.

@TITLE:How to perform asynchronous off-screen queries?
@CONTENT:I have several (potentially thousands) of scenes I would like to render in order to perform queries on what is drawn. The problem I am running into is that calls to glGetQueryObjectiv() are expensive, so I'd like to figure out a way to render several scenes in advance while I wait for the results of the queries to become available. I have read a bit about Framebuffer Objects and Pixel Buffer Objects, but mostly in the context of saving to a file using glReadPixels() and I haven't been able to track down an example of using either of these objects in asynchronous queries. Is there any reason why the setup for performing glGetQueryObjectiv() would be different from glReadPixels() as in this example (e.g., should I use an FBO or a PBO)? Note: This is NOT for a graphics application. All I'm interested in is the result of the GL_SAMPLES_PASSED query (i.e. how many pixels were drawn?). The specific application is estimating how much sunlight is striking a surface when other surfaces are casting shadows. If you are interested, you can read about it here.

 I then get a password prompt, which I can't, for the life of me, figure out. After 2 guesses I get password authentication failed for user "Hanan", and that's it. I tried Heroku's password, my Windows account password, every password I use, but nothing happens. I checked, and "Hanan" is not a role in Postgresql, so trying to change the password through psql doesn't work. I have no problem logging in to Postgresql through other roles, but it's this 'default' log-in process which I can't seem to crack. Also, since I'm using windows, I'm not sure how to run commands like sudo -u postgres psql, which I see as a possible solution. Will appreciate any help regarding this issue, I'm really frustrated by now...

@CONTENT:I created an ASP.NET MVC web application project which I commit to Visual Studio Online (Git repo) and is linked to a Windows Azure website for automatic deployment (if all unit tests succeed). My project contains the default Web.Release.config transformation that should remove the Web.config attribute /configuration/system.web/compilation/@debug which should (amongst others) enable script bundling. It appears the web.config transformation is not executed during deployment, so I guess it doesn't use the Release configuration during build/deployment.

@CONTENT:For years I used RVM as my Ruby version manager, but I want to switch to rbenv for its simplicity. However I'm finding some strange problems deploying. Here's where it seems to go wrong: # env RBENV_ROOT=\"/home/deploy/.rbenv\" PATH=\"/home/deploy/.rbenv/shims:/home/deploy/.rbenv/bin:$PATH\"  /home/deploy/.rbenv/bin/rbenv exec bundle install --gemfile /domains/myapp.com/releases/20140119013611/Gemfile --path /domains/myapp.com/shared/bundle --deployment --without development test

 Okay, so I specify the rbenv version I want -- # env RBENV_ROOT=\"/home/deploy/.rbenv\" PATH=\"/home/deploy/.rbenv/shims:/home/deploy/.rbenv/bin:$PATH\" RBENV_VERSION=\"2.0.0-p353\" /home/deploy/.rbenv/bin/rbenv exec bundle install --gemfile /domains/myapp.com/releases/20140119013611/Gemfile --path /domains/myapp.com/shared/bundle --deployment --without development test

 Huh. That's weird. # rbenv versions
> system
> * 2.0.0-p353 (set by /home/deploy/.rbenv/version)
 Any idea where I'm going wrong? The bundle install command appears to think that 2.0.0-p353 is absent, but rbenv versions shows it. What might be up?
@CODE:# env RBENV_ROOT=\"/home/deploy/.rbenv\" PATH=\"/home/deploy/.rbenv/shims:/home/deploy/.rbenv/bin:$PATH\"  /home/deploy/.rbenv/bin/rbenv exec bundle install --gemfile /domains/myapp.com/releases/20140119013611/Gemfile --path /domains/myapp.com/shared/bundle --deployment --without development test

 });
 App.SubscriptionThread.Start();
 Once I start this I have no idea how to stop it. Things I've tried. Using the Thread.Abort. This apparently doesn't stop it, as the thread just goes into a hang then forever (no unsubscription happens). Using the _redisSubscription.UnSubscribeFromAllChannels() from the UI thread. This also causes the applicaiton to go into a blocking state forever Forcefully shutdown using Environment.Exit(0). This one seems to do the trick. Unfortunetly it also has the side effect of...well...shutting down my application. How do I go about just stopping the listening, so I can connect/reconnect at will? Am I doing it wrong by starting the SubscribeToChannels in a new thread?

 As you can see, the values in the many of the rows are repeats, for some of the columns. What I want to do is remove the duplicated rows, based on the value (the min) of the effRank variable. I have set the key to be chr, bp, and effRank. So the table should be sorted on the basis of those three columns. I got kind of close. The following command returns the rows that I want, but does not return all columns, which I want. > test[,min(effRank), by=pos]

 All I need is a way to make the above command return all columns in the data.table, not just the ones mentioned in the expressions. Otherwise, works perfectly. Any help is appreciated. The output of dput is below, for those that with to make their own example. Cheers, Davy > dput(test)

@CONTENT:My project was using Spring Security 3.2.0.RC2 and my JSP's used the Spring taglib's form:form tag to automatically insert the CSRF token into my forms. After upgrading to Spring Security 3.2.0.RELEASE, I'm finding that the form:form tag no longer automatically inserts the CSRF token into my form, and that I now must manually add it via placing this in my form: <input type="hidden" name="${_csrf.parameterName}" value="${_csrf.token}"/> Has anyone else encountered the same issue? If so, what did you do for a workaround? Thanks.

AdoQuery.open;
 ConnectionString (database: MyDb) Provider=SQLOLEDB.1;Integrated Security=SSPI;Persist Security Info=False;Initial  Catalog=MyDb;Data Source=.

@TITLE:Share a Drive document without notifying user with Google Apps Script
@CONTENT:I am creating a workflow process in Apps Script where a Doc is generated from a template and shared with various users for approval. The Script sends a customised email notifying a user that the document requires their approval but they also receive a second email at each stage in the process from the user whose Drive the document is stored in saying "User has shared a document with you". Is there any way of disabling these alerts? When you share a document manually from your Drive, there is a checkbox option that allows you to choose whether or not the user receives a notification. However, I cannot find a way to disable this notification with Apps Script. I am using doc.addEditors(users) to share the document. Many Thanks

@TITLE:Construct url in view for Web Api with attribute routing
@CONTENT:How can I get the url from web api in my view? Example (from the msdn-blog): [RoutePrefix("reviews")]
public class ReviewsController : ApiController
{
    // eg.: /reviews
    [Route]
    public IHttpActionResult Get() { ... }
    // eg.: /reviews/5
    [Route("{reviewId}")]
    public IHttpActionResult Show(int reviewId) { ... }
    // eg.: /reviews/5/edit
    [Route("{reviewId}/edit")]
    public IHttpActionResult Edit(int reviewId) { ... }
}
 Now I want to construct "/reviews/edit" in my view, how can I do this? I've tried creating a little extension method, but it requires me to give every route an actual "RouteName". Is there a method I can use (like in MVC) where I can just pass the controller and action? @Url.Action("Edit", "Reviews)
 The method I'm using now (with RouteName) also doesn't allow me to use integers as parameters (unless I pass a default value). If I do need to name all my routes, how can I create a route url, but pass my parameters in the "data"-portion of my request? Current method: public static string ResolveWebApiRoute(this UrlHelper urlHelper, string routeName, object routeValues = null)
{
    var newRouteValues = new RouteValueDictionary(routeValues);
    newRouteValues.Add("httproute", true);

    return urlHelper.RouteUrl(routeName, newRouteValues);
}
 EDIT When I used methods like Url.RouteUrl(new { controller = ..., action = ...}), It redirects directly to that action (e.g. new { controller = "Reviews", action = "Show"} --> /reviews/show, whilest I want it to redirect to /reviews/...
@CODE:[RoutePrefix("reviews")]
public class ReviewsController : ApiController
{
    // eg.: /reviews
    [Route]
    public IHttpActionResult Get() { ... }

    public IHttpActionResult Show(int reviewId) { ... }

} @Url.Action("Edit", "Reviews) public static string ResolveWebApiRoute(this UrlHelper urlHelper, string routeName, object routeValues = null)
{
    var newRouteValues = new RouteValueDictionary(routeValues);
    newRouteValues.Add("httproute", true);

    return urlHelper.RouteUrl(routeName, newRouteValues);

@TITLE:Create a JAR containing classes and resources from webapp using Gradle
@CONTENT:I would like to create a jar from the contents of a WAR using gradle. The result I want is quite like what the archiveClasses = true setting of maven-war-plugin does. I understand that the gradle war plugin doesn't seem to do this (as per this stackoverflow question). Is there a way to do this manually? Say by manipulating the gradle jar task to collect the required parts from the WEB-INF folder? When I just use the default jar task it doesn't get the resources from the WEB-INF directory. The reason I want to do this is because I have modularised a WAR and the modules depend on common resources in the WAR (FreeMarker files in my case). I want to be able to test each module by depending on JAR created from the WAR. I understand I could also create a "common" jar that held all the resources and have both the WAR and the module depend on this, but it would be more convenient to create a JAR form the WAR as per the maven-war-plugin.

@TITLE:Read free format with no advance
@CONTENT:In a given file record, I need to read the first two integer elements at first, and then the rest of the line (a large number of real elements), because the assignment depend on the first 2. Suppose the format of the first two integer elements is not really well defined. The best way to solve the problem could be something: read(unitfile, "(I0,I0)", advance='no') ii, jj
read(unitfile,*) aa(ii,jj,:)
 But it seems to me the "(I0)" specification is not allowed in gfortran. Basically the file read in unitfile could be something like: 0   0    <floats>
0   10   <floats>
10   0    <floats>
100   0    <floats>
100   100    <floats>
 which is hard to be read with any fortran-like fixed field format specification. Is there any other way to get around this, apparently trivial, problem?

@TITLE:Why does RKNSJSONSerialization crash on iOS 6?
@CONTENT:I'm seeing a crash in RKNSJSONSerialization on iOS 6 only - not on iOS 7. I'm using RestKit 0.20.3 and it happens fairly consistently for me. Even when I make the same request and get the same response for iOS 6/7, it works fine on iOS 7 but crashes on iOS 6. Here's the crash - it's an EXC_BAD_ACCESS: http://crashes.to/s/2610b639062 The relevant (crashing) line in RestKit's RKNSJSONSerialization is the return: + (id)objectFromData:(NSData *)data error:(NSError **)error
{
    return [NSJSONSerialization JSONObjectWithData:data options:0 error:error];
}
 So perhaps it's not RestKit at all - perhaps it's NSJSONSerialization. I profiled the app with the Zombies tool and found this: "An Objective-C message was sent to a deallocated 'CFString (immutable)' object (zombie) at address: 0x16851250." Am I doing something wrong?
@CODE:+ (id)objectFromData:(NSData *)data error:(NSError **)error

@TITLE:assignment operator on empty inizializer_list
@CONTENT:can you explain how STL containers handle assignment operator with empty initializer list? when i'll do something like this: vector<int> v;
v = { };
 the function that is called is not: vector& operator= (initializer_list<value_type> il);
 but: vector& operator= (vector&& x);
 on the other hand, when i'll do something similar with my own class: struct A {
    A& operator= (const A&) { return *this; }
    A& operator= (A&&) { return *this; }
    A& operator= (initializer_list<int>) { return *this; }
};

/* ... */

A a;
a = { };
 the code does not compile on VS2013, and says: error C2593: 'operator =' is ambiguous
 if the list is not empty, it works fine, it just calls the function with initializer list. the problem appears only when the list is empty, on vector it calls the rvalue assignment operator, on my class it gives error. how this situation is handled in vector and other containers?
@CODE:vector<int> v;
v = { }; vector& operator= (initializer_list<value_type> il); vector& operator= (vector&& x); struct A {
    A& operator= (const A&) { return *this; }
    A& operator= (A&&) { return *this; }
    A& operator= (initializer_list<int>) { return *this; }

@TITLE:Alternative dependencies in a Homebrew formula (e.g. for use with gcc)
@CONTENT:How can I describe alternative dependencies in a Homebrew formula? There are two different kinds I'm thinking of. 1. Alternative packages My formula can depend on package P or Q, but it must have one of them. So, I want either depends_on 'P'
 or depends_on 'Q'
 and I need at least one. 2. Alternative flags for the same package My formula requires another package X for building, and it needs a package X with one of two flags, A and B. That is, I want either depends_on 'X' => [:build, 'A']
 or depends_on 'X' => [:build, 'B']
 and I need at least one. Example A specific example of where these alternative dependencies would be useful is a formula depending on gcc. There are multiple packages for gcc (e.g. gcc4[3-9]), which could be supported by #1 above. gcc has a flag enable-all-languages which implies enable-java, so if a formula that requires gcj would use #2 to specify the alternative flags.
@CODE:P Q depends_on 'P' depends_on 'Q' X X A B depends_on 'X' => [:build, 'A'] depends_on 'X' => [:build, 'B'] gcc gcc gcc4[3-9] gcc enable-all-languages enable-java gcj

@TITLE:Avoid creating non-significant white space text nodes when creating a `Nokogiri::XML` or `Nokogiri::HTML` object
@CONTENT:I'll start off by explaining the motivation behind this. First of all, I would like to count the children of each node in a Nokogiri XML Document and access the first or last child that is not a non-significant white space. A non-significant white space text node is usually created when you are parsing an indented XML representation. For example, if you have the following XML: <note>
  <to>Tove</to>
  <from>Jani</from>
  <heading>Reminder</heading>
  <body>Don't forget me this weekend!</body>
</note>
 Whose string representation is as follows:  "<note>\n  <to>Tove</to>\n  <from>Jani</from>\n  <heading>Reminder</heading>\n  <body>Don't forget me this weekend!</body>\n</note>\n"
 When creating a Nokogiri::XML object from this string representation, you get the following Document created: #(Document:0x3fc07e4540d8 {
  name = "document",
  children = [
    #(Element:0x3fc07ec8629c {
      name = "note",
      children = [
        #(Text "\n  "),
        #(Element:0x3fc07ec8089c {
          name = "to",
          children = [ #(Text "Tove")]
          }),
        #(Text "\n  "),
        #(Element:0x3fc07e8d8064 {
          name = "from",
          children = [ #(Text "Jani")]
          }),
        #(Text "\n  "),
        #(Element:0x3fc07e8d588c {
          name = "heading",
          children = [ #(Text "Reminder")]
          }),
        #(Text "\n  "),
        #(Element:0x3fc07e8cf590 {
          name = "body",
          children = [ #(Text "Don't forget me this weekend!")]
          }),
        #(Text "\n")]
      })]
  })
 Here, you get lots white space nodes of type Nokogiri::XML::Text. Those are the nodes that I wish to not be parsed, or somehow find a way to make a distinction between those and the ones that are significant such as the text node that represents the string "Tove". EDIT: Just to be clear, I do not want the whitespace between a closing and an opening tag represented. Or, if I cannot avoid that, distinguish them from significant text nodes like tha text node inside the element <to>. EDIT 2: Here is an example rspec of something that I am looking for: require 'nokogiri'
require_relative 'spec_helper'

xml_text = <<XML
<note>
  <to>Tove</to>
  <from>Jani</from>
  <heading>Reminder</heading>
  <body>Don't forget me this weekend!</body>
</note>
XML

xml = Nokogiri::XML(xml_text)

def significant_nodes(node)
  return 0
end

describe "Stackoverflow Question" do
  it "should return the number of significant nodes in nokogiri." do
    expect(significant_nodes(xml.css('note'))).to eq 4
  end
end
 So essentially, I want to know how to create the significant_nodes function. EDIT 3: If I change the XML to: <note>
  <to>Tove</to>
  <from>Jani</from>
  <heading>Reminder</heading>
  <body>Don't forget me this weekend!</body>
  <footer></footer>
</note>
 Then when I create the Document, I still would like footer represented, so using the config.noblanks is not an option.
@CODE:children Document <note>
  <to>Tove</to>
  <from>Jani</from>
  <heading>Reminder</heading>

Over the past few days, I have tried so many things, I can't keep track but, they all get about the same results. I have tried installing earlier versions, different versions (x86), and on and on. If anyone has a recommendation as to what else I might try I would really appreciate it. I would love to get MySQL working on this machine. It was on my machine and working at one point but, I uninstalled it because of some problems I was having long ago. Now, I can't get it to work.

I have read a bit about Framebuffer Objects and Pixel Buffer Objects, but mostly in the context of saving to a file using glReadPixels() and I haven't been able to track down an example of using either of these objects in asynchronous queries. Is there any reason why the setup for performing glGetQueryObjectiv() would be different from glReadPixels() as in this example (e.g., should I use an FBO or a PBO)? Note: This is NOT for a graphics application. All I'm interested in is the result of the GL_SAMPLES_PASSED query (i.e. how many pixels were drawn?).

@TITLE:What is a ¡§calling context?¡¨
@CONTENT:ECMA-262 5.1 subsections 10.4.2 and 10.4.2.1 refer to a "calling context." This doesn't appear to be described anywhere else in the document. Quoting the spec, emphasis mine: 10.4.2 Entering Eval Code The following steps are performed when control enters the execution context for eval code: If there is no calling context or if the eval code is not being evaluated by a direct call (15.1.2.1.1) to the eval function then, 10.4.2.1 Strict Mode Restrictions The eval code cannot instantiate variable or function bindings in the variable environment of the calling context that invoked the eval if either the code of the calling context or the eval code is strict code. Instead such bindings are instantiated in a new VariableEnvironment that is only accessible to the eval code. What does "calling context" mean in these paragraphs? I would assume it refers to the Execution Context at the top of the stack just before eval is called; can anyone verify this? What does it mean to have "no calling context?" Can someone provide an example of code or conditions that could result in a call to eval with no calling context?

@TITLE:sklearn.LabelEncoder with never seen before values
@CONTENT:If a sklearn.LabelEncoder has been fitted on a training set, it might break if it encounters new values when used on a test set. The only solution I could come up with for this is to map everything new in the test set (i.e. not belonging to any existing class) to "<unknown>", and then explicitly add a corresponding class to the LabelEncoder afterward: # train and test are pandas.DataFrame's and c is whatever column
le = LabelEncoder()
train[c] = le.fit_transform(train[c])
test[c] = test[c].map(lambda s: '<unknown>' if s not in le.classes_ else s)
le.classes_ = np.append(le.classes_, '<unknown>')
test[c] = le.transform(test[c])
 This works, but is there a better solution? Update As @sapo_cosmico points out in a comment, it seems that the above doesn't work anymore, given what I assume is an implementation change in LabelEncoder.transform, which now seems to use np.searchsorted (I don't know if it was the case before). So instead of appending the <unknown> class to the LabelEncoder's list of already extracted classes, it needs to be inserted in sorted order: import bisect
le_classes = le.classes_.tolist()
bisect.insort_left(le_classes, '<unknown>')
le.classes_ = le_classes
 However, as this feels pretty clunky all in all, I'm certain there is a better approach for this.
@CODE:sklearn.LabelEncoder "<unknown>" LabelEncoder # train and test are pandas.DataFrame's and c is whatever column
le = LabelEncoder()
train[c] = le.fit_transform(train[c])
test[c] = test[c].map(lambda s: '<unknown>' if s not in le.classes_ else s)
le.classes_ = np.append(le.classes_, '<unknown>')
test[c] = le.transform(test[c]) LabelEncoder.transform np.searchsorted <unknown> LabelEncoder import bisect
le_classes = le.classes_.tolist()
bisect.insort_left(le_classes, '<unknown>')
le.classes_ = le_classes <unknown> [0] 0 LabelEncoder np.searchsorted <unknown>

@TITLE:GWT - ¡§Access is Denied¡¨ JavaScript error when setting document.domain in Internet Explorer only
@CONTENT:Background Information I am working on a web application that utilizes GWT (v2.4). For the application, I am creating an iframe that will display some information from another website. I need to access some information from that iframe that is normally restricted via the Same Origin Policy (SOP). However, both sites (the parent and iframe) are hosted on the same super-domain, just under different sub-domains. So, something like this: Parent: dev.app.mySite.com frame: someOtherContent.mySite.com I know the usual solution for this problem is to set the property: document.domain = 'mySite.com' on both parent and iframe site to allow passage of SOP. This works for all browsers (that I'm concerned with) except Internet Explorer 8 (and probably other versions). The Problem In IE, when I attempt to load my web application, I get a completely blank page with the following JS exception, "Access is denied." The source of this problem is in GWT's myGwtAppName.nochache.js where GWT generates some code during the compilation process that it needs (see below). From the research I've done on this problem in general, the root cause of this issue seems to be that in IE, unlike all other browsers, iframes don't inherit their parent's document.domain settings. From what I understand, the code generated by GWT runs in an iframe (based on this comment: http://stackoverflow.com/a/5161888). So, what I think is happening based on my limited knowledge of JS: I set document.domain = 'mySite.com' in the parent index page via JS and it is processed. myGwtAppName.nochache.js is processed. In nochache.js, code is ran to setup the GWT iframe sand-box environment In that code, a call is being made to a SOP restricted property of the sand-box iframe An exception is thrown because the site's parent document domain has been set to 'mySite.com' and the iframe's document.domain doesn't inherit that setting, so it's still 'dev.app.mySite.com'. This won't pass SOP because the domain has to be exactly the same. The generated code that causes the exception The below code, looks like it's setting up the GWT sandbox iframe environment. var $intern_4 = 'myGwtAppName',
$intern_7 = 'body',
$intern_8 = 'iframe',
$intern_9 = 'javascript:""',
$intern_10 = 'position:absolute; width:0; height:0; border:none; left: -1000px; top: -1000px; !important',
$intern_11 = '<html><head><\/head><body><\/body><\/html>',
$intern_12 = 'script',
$intern_13 = 'javascript',

 My Questions Is my analysis of the situation completely off-base? Has anyone seen a solution for this problem that will work in a GWT environment in IE? Information Sources IE doesn't inherit document.domain settings: http://stackoverflow.com/a/1888711 (and many other threads).

@TITLE:How do I build and use the latest version of git on cygwin?
@CONTENT:As for why I'd want to do this, see this question: What are the downsides to using the official Windows Git binaries from cygwin? Or you could look at this: http://git.661346.n2.nabble.com/Fwd-Error-with-git-svn-pushing-a-rename-td7599382.html It prevents you from pushing renamed files to the svn server. Cygwin is stuck at a version of git that has numerous bugs when used with the git-svn bridge. A lot of these have been fixed in the latest git (their master branch, not the one available for download). So how do you get, build and use it? I'll answer this below.

@TITLE:Drawing an svg containing html in a canvas with safari
@CONTENT:I'm trying to create some thumbnails of dynamically created pages for a website, i have found a solution by adding the html in a svg which I then draw on an image inside a canvas that I resize after the image has been drawn. This solution works in firefox and chrome but not in safari, the svg doesn't seem to be drawn I just get a blank page. I don't get any error even if i put some try catch and I couldn't find a solution on the web. My html is just a basic test page with a canvas, I tried to add a meta tag on the head <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="application/xhtml+xml; charset=utf-8" />
 but it didn't work either. Here's the code I wrote : var canvas = document.getElementById('canvasTest'),

            } catch(e) {                    
                window.BlobBuilder = window.BlobBuilder || window.WebKitBlobBuilder || window.MozBlobBuilder || window.MSBlobBuilder;

            var url = DOMURL.createObjectURL(svg);

 Safari can use the Blob constructor so it doesn't go in the catch. It seems like the problem is when I pass the svg reference (img.src = url) but i can't figure out what to do differently, if someone has some ideas or solution it would be great.

Dependencies look like this: libA has the constructor libB also has a constructor libC depends on libA and libB program depends on libA program links libC via dlopen() Now, when I run the program: libA's constructor gets run before main() starts libB's constructor gets run by dlopen() Apparently, dlopen executes constructors of libraries when they are loaded into memory. Is this specified somewhere, and how does the linker check which libs are already loaded?

@TITLE:Apple Mach-O Linker Warning - Framework Search Paths?
@CONTENT:I've stumbled upon an annoying error: Apple Mach-O Linker Warning. ld: warning: directory not found for option '-F/Users/erik/Documents/Xcode/Hello' ld: warning: directory not found for option '-FFriend'. My Project folder is called "Hello Friend". In my Framework Search Paths it has 4 rows showing: $(inherited) /Users/erik/Documents/Xcode/Hello Friend $(PROJECT_DIR) It looks like it has divided the word "Hello Friend" into two sections because of the space between the words so I'm thinking that's the explanation? I've tried to edit it to $(inherited) /Users/erik/Documents/Xcode/Hello Friend $(PROJECT_DIR) but it jumps back. Any ideas? Very much appreciated!

@TITLE:How to use bootstrap datepicker inside ng-grid
@CONTENT:I'm trying to use bootstrap datepicker (via angulart ui bootstrap) inside an ng-grid. I'm setting the grid with: $scope.gridSettings = {
    data: "myData",
    enableCellSelection: true,
    enableRowSelection: false,
    enableCellEditOnFocus: true,
    columnDefs:
        [
            { field: "StartDate", displayName: "Date", 
              editableCellTemplate: '<input type="text" datepicker-popup="dd/MM/yyyy" ng-model="COL_FIELD" />' }
        ]
};
 And it works, when I click a cell it changes into a datepicker - but - the calendar popup is clipped by the cell boundaries - this means that I can only see the part of the popup that fits into the cell (the top border) What do I need to set to allow the datepicker popup to appear above the grid instead of being clipped to the cell? Update: tried switching from Angular UI bootstrap to angular-strap, now the datepicker works but I have the exact same problem with the timepicker
@CODE:$scope.gridSettings = {
    data: "myData",
    enableCellSelection: true,
    enableRowSelection: false,
    enableCellEditOnFocus: true,
    columnDefs:
        [
            { field: "StartDate", displayName: "Date", 
              editableCellTemplate: '<input type="text" datepicker-popup="dd/MM/yyyy" ng-model="COL_FIELD" />' }
        ]

@CONTENT:I can't debug android ndk app on Windows. It seems it is a new line problem on Windows c:\Android\android-ndk-r9c\samples\hello-jni>..\..\ndk-build DUMP_APP_ABI

 There is no line after all on Linux I use unmodified hello-jni from android-ndk-r9c I also compared size of every unzipped file and they are original. It is clean unmodified NDK from Google. It is able to compile and do JavaDebug but not NativeDebug. (on Windows) My questions is: What I am doing wrong? Does someone can confirm that unmodifed Android NDK r9c (latest today) is able to do native debugging with Eclipse+NDKPlugin. PS I forgot to mention that when I do Native Debug I get [2013-11-18 14:38:50 - HelloJni] Unknown Application ABI:

@LINK:/questions/20978847/tweenaccessor-for-music-class-in-libgdx
@TITLE:TweenAccessor for music.class in LibGDX
@CONTENT:I've been wondering: is it possible to use Universal Tween Engine in LibGDX to - for example - change the volume of a song? I wrote my own MusicAccessor with code similar to my SpriteAccessor, which actually works for Sprite.class, but when it comes to music objects - it always gets the same error: java.lang.RuntimeException: No TweenAccessor was found for the target
 The thing is, I DO register my accessor by: Tween.registerAccessor(Music.class,new MusicAccessor()); I'm quite sure it's actually being registered, as System.out.println(Tween.getRegisteredAccessor(Music.class)); prints: the.name.of.my.packages.MusicAccessor@14bb523. Honestly, I'm stuck. The music file itself is in .mp3 format and I load it by an asset manager. So, my questions are: why the Tween Engine cannot correctly recognise the class of my music object? Is there a way to make it work or am I stuck with regular timers to change the volume over time? Would changing the format or loading the music file in a different way help?
@CODE:java.lang.RuntimeException: No TweenAccessor was found for the target Tween.registerAccessor(Music.class,new MusicAccessor()); System.out.println(Tween.getRegisteredAccessor(Music.class)); the.name.of.my.packages.MusicAccessor@14bb523 cast(Music.class)

@TITLE:With two res directories per build variant, Gradle stopped tracking changes in resource files
@CONTENT:I, quite innocently, switched to using different app icons for each product flavour along these lines: sourceSets.production {
    res.srcDirs = ['res', 'res-production']
}

sourceSets.beta {
    res.srcDirs = ['res', 'res-beta']
}

sourceSets.internal {
    res.srcDirs = ['res', 'res-internal']
}
 Thing is, after that, Gradle stopped noticing changes in any layout files, such as res/layout/activity_faq.xml, and requires a clean build each time, if I want my XML changes to be included in the APK. I first thought this was an Android Studio problem, but in fact I can reproduce it with pure Gradle, on the command line, simply looking at the files that appear under build/res/all/internal/debug/layout. When I run ./gradlew assembleInternalDebug, it outputs: :compileInternalDebugNdk UP-TO-DATE
:preBuild UP-TO-DATE
:preInternalDebugBuild UP-TO-DATE
:prepareInternalDebugDependencies
:compileInternalDebugAidl UP-TO-DATE

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
 Here, processInternalDebugResources is shown to be UP-TO-DATE, while I think it should not be, when there are changed resource files. Before the icon-per-flavour change, in similar Gradle output, processInternalDebugResources was not shown up-to-date. Question is, any way to fix this, or did I stumble upon a bug in Android Gradle plugin? My build.gradle: buildscript {

@CONTENT:What are Groups? You can use CKAN Groups to create and manage collections of datasets. This could be to catalogue datasets for a particular project or team, or on a particular theme, or as a very simple way to help people find and search your own published datasets. What are Organizations? CKAN Organizations are used to create, manage and publish collections of datasets. Users can have different roles within an Organization, depending on their level of authorisation to create, edit and publish. Both are used to create and manage collections of datasets. Can someone please explain the difference between Organizations & Groups in CKAN?

@CONTENT:I am trying to host a .Net web service on GoDaddy. I don't know if this is an issue on GoDaddy, or if there is anything I can do about it. The full error message is: Unhandled Exception: System.Web.Services.Protocols.SoapException: Server was unable to process request. ---> Request for the permission of type 'System.Security.Permissions.SecurityPermission, mscorlib, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089' failed. The web service just has 2 methods, one is the default "HelloWorld" function and another returns one value from my MySQL database. The "HelloWorld" function works fine. But when I call from my MySQL database, I get the above error. It works when ran in local host. As it is shared hosting on GoDaddy I cannot run the service with full trust. I have tried adding <trust level="Medium" /> to the Web.config to hopefully allow GoDaddy to run the service, but it gives the same error. Is there anything I can do to read values in a MySQL database from a web service hosted on GoDaddy? EDIT: Tried the suggestions in the answer by Patrick Hofman below and still no joy. Exact same error, even though it has been compiled to allow partial trust. Any other answers would be greatly appreciated. EDIT 2: Tried various dlls from the projects described below and now getting SocketPermission errors. Tried to use ODBC instead and get OdbcPermission errors. I think the moral of the story is don't use GoDaddy. It's all to do with their medium trust and what they allow. Going to look into a php webservice method. Not ideal but might be the only way.

@CONTENT:I am working on a JavaScript library (bitcoin-prices.js) which I'd like to maintain using browserify. The library depends on jQuery. I would not like to force the library users move to browserify, but retain "drop one file + script tag" integration for those who have not drank the latest koolaid from JavaScript community. My question is how to create a bundle.js with browserify, so that browserify-enabled users can install the package from NPM, having proper jQuery dependency Traditional users can as still use <script> tag drop in bundle, loading their jQuery wherever they want to with another <script> and the code still works fine I guess some kind of boilerplate code is needed around $ = require('jquery.js')?

@CONTENT:I have been writing some Clojure recently, and I found myself using the following pattern frequently enough: (let [x (bam)
      y (boom)]
  {:x x
   :y y})
 So I went ahead and wrote the following macro: (defmacro make-keyword-map [& syms]
  `(hash-map ~@(mapcat (fn [s] [(keyword (name s)) s]) syms)))
 With that, code now looks like: (let [x (bam)
      y (boom)]
  (make-keyword-map x y)
 Would this sort of macro be considered idiomatic? Or am I doing something wrong, and missing some already established pattern to deal with something of this sort?

      y (boom)]
  {:x x

@TITLE:Disable system-level events on Android monkey
@CONTENT:While monkey testing my app % adb shell monkey -p com.foo.bar --throttle 1000 -v 14400
 I notice that it accesses various system settings on my device like audio control and taking screen shots. According to http://developer.android.com/tools/help/monkey.html, this is the way it was meant to behave. The Monkey is a program that runs on your emulator or device and generates pseudo-random streams of user events such as clicks, touches, or gestures, as well as a number of system-level events. Is it possible to exclude the system level events so the monkey completely focuses on my target app? I looked at the '-c' option for constraints, but looking at the available Intents at http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html, I don't seem to see anything related to disabling such system level events. Any pointers?

@TITLE:Displaying read only properties in PropertyGrid control
@CONTENT:I am using the WPF Extended Toolkit to display the properties of a Team object. Now one of these properties is a collection Persons. No problem I get a nice drop down, which when I click on shows me the names and ages of each of these people. Now the problem is that I don't actually want to expose my Collection as public. However as soon as I make its setter private the property is disabled preventing the user from seeing the Person collection and the person details: How should I display my Person Collection when its setter is private? Can I do this with a XAML template? If so how? I'm using MVVM so I don't want to put anything in the code behind. Update OK so the solution by @tencntraze got me most of the way there - thanks. However it doesn't work for Collections of objects which is what I've got in my case.

@TITLE:Is there a way to OR together the WHERE and HAVING clauses in a SQL query?
@CONTENT:Suppose that I have a SQL query SELECT Label1, Label2, SUM(number) as MySum
FROM MyTable
GROUP BY Label1, Label2
 and it gives me some results like Label1 | Label2 | MySum 
-------+--------+------
Foo    | Bar    |   100
Foo    | Baz    |  -100
NotFoo | Bar    |   100
NotFoo | Baz    |  -100
 I can put a WHERE and HAVING clause to filter down the results SELECT Label1, Label2, SUM(number) as MySum
FROM MyTable
WHERE Label1 = 'Foo'
GROUP BY Label1, Label2
HAVING MySum > 0
 and this gives me the results Label1 | Label2 | MySum 
-------+--------+------
Foo    | Bar    |   100
 The WHERE and HAVING are ANDed implicitly together. Is there a syntax for something like SELECT Label1, Label2, SUM(number) as MySum
FROM MyTable
WHERE Label1 = 'Foo'
GROUP BY Label1, Label2
OR HAVING MySum > 0
 giving the results Label1 | Label2 | MySum 
-------+--------+------
Foo    | Bar    |   100
Foo    | Baz    |  -100
NotFoo | Bar    |   100
 ? I could do SELECT Label1, Label2, SUM(number) as MySum
FROM MyTable
WHERE Label1 = 'Foo'
GROUP BY Label1, Label2

UNION 

SELECT Label1, Label2, SUM(number)
FROM MyTable
GROUP BY Label1, Label2
HAVING MySum > 0
 Disadvantage: This can be inefficient as the database has to work out the Foo | Bar | 100 line twice, find that it is a duplicate and then throw it away. I could also write SELECT Label1, Label2, SUM(number) as MySum
FROM MyTable
WHERE Label1 = 'Foo'
GROUP BY Label1, Label2

UNION ALL

SELECT Label1, Label2, SUM(number)
FROM MyTable
WHERE Label1 <> 'Foo'
GROUP BY Label1, Label2
HAVING MySum > 0
 Disadvantage: It is starting to become less easy to understand at first glance (possibly the least bad disadvantage). Or SELECT Label1, Label2, SUM(number) as MySum
FROM MyTable
GROUP BY Label1, Label2
HAVING MySum > 0
OR Label1 = 'Foo'
 Disadvantage: This will make the database could do a lot of extra work aggregating up lots of non Foo labels.
@CODE:SELECT Label1, Label2, SUM(number) as MySum

@TITLE:React: Why is `this.props.children` undefined?
@CONTENT:I'm building an electronic resistance calculator with ReactJS. I have a composed component declared as so: var ResistanceCalculator = React.createClass({
    getInitialState: function() {
        return {bands: [0,0,0,0,0]}
    },
    componentDidMount: function() {
        console.log(this.props.children); // => undefined
    },
    render: function() {
        return (
            <div>
                <OhmageIndicator bands={this.state.bands} />
                <SVGResistor bands={this.state.bands} />
                <BandSelector band={1} />
                <BandSelector band={2} />
                <BandSelector band={3} />

                <BandSelector band={5} />
            </div>
         );
    }
});
 BandSelector renders <select> elements and when one changes I want to update ResistanceCalculator's state. So my thinking was that I need to bind an event listener to ResistanceCalculator children. However this.props.children seems to be empty. Why is this?
@CODE:var ResistanceCalculator = React.createClass({
    getInitialState: function() {
        return {bands: [0,0,0,0,0]}

    },
    render: function() {

@TITLE:Center elements vertically inside UINavigationBar with custom height
@CONTENT:I'm developing an iOS 6 and 7 app that requires the navigation bar to be taller than the usual 44/64 pts I've searched high and low and so far it seems the cleanest solution is to use a category (or subclass) and implement the - (CGSize)sizeThatFits:(CGSize)size method to return a different size. This works fine in just making , however doing this causes all the items inside to rest at the bottom of the navigation bar, while I'd like to have them centered. I have tried using the Appearance Proxy protocol to define vertical offsets for the buttons, specifically this code [[UIBarButtonItem appearance] setBackgroundVerticalPositionAdjustment: -10    forBarMetrics:UIBarMetricsDefault];
[[UIBarButtonItem appearance] setBackButtonBackgroundVerticalPositionAdjustment: -10 forBarMetrics:UIBarMetricsDefault];
[[UINavigationBar appearance] setTitleVerticalPositionAdjustment: -10 forBarMetrics: UIBarMetricsDefault];
 Works just fine on iOS 6, producing this result But doesn't work on iOS 7, giving me this instead. I have read around that under iOS 7 the adjustments only work when using custom views but it seems odd to me, especially considering that setBackButtonTitlePositionAdjustment:forBarMetrics: actually moves the text for the back button up, but not the chevron and that the title actually does nudge up. I've also tried going for a subclassing route, using layoutSubviews to move down the views inside the UINavigationBar. This works, but of course when a new view controller is pushed the buttons jump around during the transition. Am I missing something? Thanks in advance UPDATE I have edited the description to make it clearer that my issue is with what's inside the bar, not the bar itself.
@CODE:- (CGSize)sizeThatFits:(CGSize)size [[UIBarButtonItem appearance] setBackgroundVerticalPositionAdjustment: -10    forBarMetrics:UIBarMetricsDefault];

But while coding, intellisence dose not recognize those internal types and methods. And if I write them manually, they are not colored as expected. I'm working on Visual Studio 2013 Ultimate edition. Edit: In the picutre above why Shapefile (this is the internal class type that is defined in the class library and I'm using it in a friend assembly) is not colored like DataColumn? Is this a bug? More Strange Issue: Every time the solution can be built successfully but after a while some errors appear in the error list and say e.g. Shapefile.Read is inaccessible due to its protection level! Here is a snapshot (all of these methods are internal). Its strange I didn't know projects with errors may be built successfully :)

@CONTENT:I built OpenSSL using the MSVC++ 2013 Express compiler by doing the following: Installing ActivePerl 5.16.3 from here. Grabbing openssl-1.0.1e.tar.gz and extracting it to C:\OpenSSL\Win64. Opening up the "VS2013 x64 Cross Tools Command Prompt" and cd-ing to the directory where I had extracted the archive. Running the following commands: perl Configure VC-WIN64A
ms\do_win64a
nmake -f ms\ntdll.mak This completed without errors (the proper DLLs are built). However, something very strange has happened. If I open up openssl/ssl.h, the contents of the file are: ../../ssl/ssl.h
 Since this is obviously not valid C/C++, I can't compile any applications that depend on OpenSSL headers due to the problem above. What have I done wrong?

The same select2 works when I put it outside the modal popup. When I searched, I found many are facing this same problem and found this post Select2 doesn't work when embedded in a bootstrap modal I implemented both the solutions from it Removed tabindex from modal popup. Commented code of enforceFocus function in modal.js file. But it is still not working! Any idea what I could still be missing? Edit1 It works on firefox when tabindex is removed from the modal div but not with IE9 Edit2 I found that removing tabindex is actually not getting recognized by IE9 because I can still hide the popup by escape key in IE but not in Firefox.

@CONTENT:I feel like I'm going crazy but alert() and console.log() refuses to work anywhere on Firefox 26. At first I thought it was my own website's problem, but I cannot for the life of me to get it to work via javascript: urls, Firebug, I even tried it in jsfiddle.net by just putting alert('test'); in the script panel. Tried uninstalling and installing again, no luck. The only extension I'm running is Firebug. Heck, Stackoverflow didn't even prompt me about leaving when I accidentally clicked the back button while writing this. Also yes, I made sure there was some content inside the alert() and console.log() What I mean by not working is that Firefox treats the code as if it were non-existent, nothing happens. Once again, here's my environment: Browser: Firefox 26.0 OS: Windows 8.1 Pro Issue: alert(), console.log(), and apparently prompt() doesn't work If anyone might know why this is happening, I would highly appreciate an answer. UPDATE Following Pointy's comment, it appears that both alert() and console.log() work as expected on the New Tab Page, but nowhere else

@TITLE:4th bullet point in iso 12.1 p5 doesn't make sense to me
@CONTENT:Maybe I'm missing something, but IMO the 4th bullet point in iso ¡±12.1 p5 is wrong: X is a union and all of its variant members are of const-qualified type (or array thereof), simply because you can't have more than one const qualified member in a union. From ¡±9.1 we have: In a union, at most one of the non-static data members can be active at any time, that is, the value of at most one of the non-static data members can be stored in a union at any time. Edit: This snippet doesn't compile in Ideone union U
{
    const int i;
    const char c;
    float x;
    U(int j, char a) : i(j), c(a) {}
};
 Edit1: The following code compiles in Coliru and Ideone. But according to 12.1 p5 4th bullet point, it shouldn't as the default constructor should be deleted. #include <iostream>
union T
{
    const int y;
    const int x;
    const float z;
    T(int j) : y(j) {}
    T() = default;
};

int main()
{
    T t;
}
 Edit2: I also don't understand why the Standard disallows this code (see note in 9.5 p2) struct S
{
    int i;
    S() : i(1) {}
};

union T
{
    S s;
    char c;
};

int main()
{
    T t;
}
 but allows this. What's the difference? struct S
{
    int i;
    S() : i(1) {}
};

union T
{
    S s;
    char c;
    T() {}
};

int main()
{
    T t;
}

 when included inline I can reuse the icons using the <use> tag like so: <svg width="32" height="32" viewBox="0 0 32 32">
    <g>
       <use xlink:href="#chat"/>
    </g>
</svg>
 Q: Is it possible to include the defs as an external file?

@TITLE:Replacement of Self-tracking entities in Entity Framework 6
@CONTENT:I am sure most of .NET developers must be facing this issue one way or the other. The problem is simple, I am upgrading my project from .NET 4 to .NET 4.5.1. So far so good the upgrade went neatly. But when I upgraded from EF4 to EF6, I did encounter lot of bugs in my queries. Some of these were related to renaming the context which I did, but as for the errors related to Self-tracking entities, I am a little confused. Self-tracking entities are a major part of my project and EF6 not supporting them means I will have to rewrite a major part of my DAL. I tried to find out but have not been able to find any alternative to STE in EF6. Does anyone know way around to this scenario? Will I have to rewrite my STE dependent Queries. The answers should not include explanations on why Microsoft decided to put STEs behind as I have already gone through many blogs explaining that.

@TITLE:HTML5 & Web audio api: Streaming microphone data from browser to server. Ideal transports and data compression
@CONTENT:I am looking to take the audio input from the browser and stream it to multiple listeners. The intended use is for music, so the quality must mp3 standard or thereabouts. I have attempted two ways, both yielding unsuccessful results: WebRTC Streaming audio directly between browsers works fine, but the audio quality seems to be non-customisable though what I have seen. (I have seen that it is using the Opus audio codec, but seems to not expose any controls). Does anyone have any insight into how to increase the audio quality in WebRTC streams? Websockets The issue is the transportation from the browser to the server. The PCM audio data I can acquiring via the method below has proven too large to repeatedly stream to the server via websockets. The stream works perfectly in high speed internet environments, but on slower wifi it is un-usable. var context = new webkitAudioContext()
navigator.webkitGetUserMedia({audio:true}, gotStream)

function gotStream (stream)
{
    var source = context.createMediaStreamSource(stream)
    var proc = context.createScriptProcessor(2048, 2, 2)

    source.connect(proc)
    proc.connect(context.destination)
    proc.onaudioprocess = function(event)
    {
        var audio_data = event.inputBuffer.getChannelData(0)|| new Float32Array(2048)
        console.log(audio_data)
        // send audio_data to server
    }
}
 So the main question is, is there any way to compress the PCM data in order to make it easier to stream to the server? Or perhaps there is an easier way to go about this?
@CODE:var context = new webkitAudioContext()
navigator.webkitGetUserMedia({audio:true}, gotStream)

function gotStream (stream)
{
    var source = context.createMediaStreamSource(stream)
    var proc = context.createScriptProcessor(2048, 2, 2)

    source.connect(proc)
    proc.connect(context.destination)
    proc.onaudioprocess = function(event)
    {
        var audio_data = event.inputBuffer.getChannelData(0)|| new Float32Array(2048)
        console.log(audio_data)
        // send audio_data to server
    }

@TITLE:How to create a distributed lock with Redis?
@CONTENT:On the redis documentation, I found a primitive lock can be implemented via SETNX: http://redis.io/commands/setnx C4 sends SETNX lock.foo in order to acquire the lock The crashed client C3 still holds it, so Redis will reply with 0 to C4. C4 sends GET lock.foo to check if the lock expired. If it is not, it will sleep for some time and retry from the start. Instead, if the lock is expired because the Unix time at lock.foo is older than the current Unix time, C4 tries to perform: GETSET lock.foo Because of the GETSET semantic, C4 can check if the old value stored at key is still an expired timestamp. If it is, the lock was acquired. If another client, for instance C5, was faster than C4 and acquired the lock with the GETSET operation, the C4 GETSET operation will return a non expired timestamp. C4 will simply restart from the first step. Note that even if C4 set the key a bit a few seconds in the future this is not a problem. However, as some users commented, using a UNIX timestamp as the expiration requires the client 's and server's time to be perfectly synchronized. Is there a better alternative to create a global/distributed lock in Redis?

@TITLE:Including Grails plugin migrations in the changelog of the application
@CONTENT:I am developing a modular application with Grails 2.x and I would like to organize our database migrations in a way that every plugin/module hosts their own migrations in their grails-app/migrations folder. (as opposed to putting all migrations into the migrations folder of the composing application project) The composing application project itself normally doesn't have any migrations since these are stored in the plugins. Is it possible to build a "master" changelog in the application project and only reference the plugin migration files in the proper order? This way I could have a very clean and migration system which handles plugin dependency problems as well (I place the plugin migration files references in the order which respects the plugin dependencies, which may change over time, so ordering of the migrations can be fairly complex). By default the Database Migrations plugin doesn't seem to check/execute plugin migrations at all (inline plugins in my case). The docs don't say anything about this scenario, they concentrate on the simple, non-modular development workflow. I have seen a solved issue with the DB Migrations plugin that somehow allows running migration files outside of the migrations directory of the app but I assume that would use some kind of hardcoded relative/absolute paths which would not be very elegant. The most elegant solution would be if I could also specify the plugin for each migration "include" statement so my master changelog would look like this. databaseChangeLog = {
  include plugin:'core'       ,file:'000-initial.groovy'
  include plugin:'accounting' ,file:'000-initial.groovy'
  include plugin:'core'       ,file:'001-drop-constr-XXX.groovy'
  include plugin:'accounting' ,file:'001-add-col-yyy-to-posting-table.groovy'
}
 Is it possible to implement something similar with the current Database Migrations Plugin? Any help/idea is appreciated.

@LINK:/questions/20712500/ews-managed-api-breaks-appointment-html-message-body-on-update
@TITLE:EWS Managed API breaks Appointment HTML message body on update
@CONTENT:I'm using EWS Java 1.2, although 2.0 in C# shows the exact same issues, and Exchange 2010 SP3, so a particular bug in SP2 prior to rollup 3 regarding message bodies is not the problem. Long story short: EWS + Exchange = pain. Using EWS in Exchange, you can create an Appointment. You can specify that the message body of the Appointment be HTML and give it a bunch of HTML to go with it. This will do some kind of HTML -> RTF conversion that wrecks the HTML when you view it in an Outlook desktop or web client. Okay, well, we can tailor the HTML to something that doesn't get eaten in the process and still looks decent. Except that when you update the Appointment with a change to the message body, it REALLY eats the HTML formatting. It doesn't matter if it's the same HTML you gave it when it was created. The second save will destroy it, leaving little more than bold text, line breaks, and tabs. It's as if it's either displaying the plain text with a few small pieces of formatting or it's displaying a very stripped-down RTF from converted HTML. What's really maddening is that it only happens once you update the body. The thing is, I've taken a look at these Appointments (and related MeetingRequests, which are mulched the same way) in both MFCMAPI and in EWS by checking the extended properties. When the Appointment is first created, only the RTF body is populated. The plain text and HTML bodies are null, the RTF is in sync, and the native body value is 2, which means it should display RTF. Okay, that makes sense. On update, all three body types are present. The RTF is out of sync. The native body value is 3, which means that it should display HTML. I checked in MFCMAPI. Both the plain text body and RTF body show out of memory errors, but opening the property will show it correctly. The HTML body is present. There is ZERO reason that this should be happening according to the documentation. The Best Body algorithm states that if the native body property is populated, then that is what will be used and it's all done. Well, that's obviously not happening. If it's not getting that value for some reason, then it will go through a conditional chain. Well, the conditional chain shows that the HTML body should be displayed in this case. MFCMAPI agrees when the item exported as it shows the native body to be the HTML body. OWA will display it just fine. But Outlook 2010/2013? Nope. I'm at my wit's end here. I cannot get desktop Outlook to display the body properly no matter what I do. It seems to be something fundamentally broken serverside, but there are no known bugs listed (aside from the aforementioned SP2 pre-rollup 3 issue, which isn't the case here) and I cannot find any documentation that explains why the update breaks it so badly. The best I've been able to do is set the pidTagBodyHtml directly on creation and have it broken from the start. At least that's consistent. EDIT: I've implemented the RTF decompression algorithm to peek inside. Sure enough, the RTF message body for a new Appointment and the RTF message body for an updated appointment (in which the body was updated with a virtually identical one) are very different! Exchange is following two separate code paths serverside and it's breaking the body format! The only possible solution I see is to also implement the compression and formatting algorithms and manually construct a valid RTF body in the client, which isn't exactly a small feat.

@TITLE:How to do text to speech with python on a Toshiba laptop and Windows 7?
@CONTENT:I am trying to find a way to create text to speech in python (I am on windows 7). I am using pyinstaller to compile this program. I have tried a large number of approaches, including using Google's unofficial text to speech program accessed through the urllib2 module. This ends up creating an mp3 file. For details on the code, much of this code is from http://glowingpython.blogspot.com/2012/11/text-to-speech-with-correct-intonation.html. I have then needed to play the mp3 file that this generates. I have used mplayer, ffmpeg, mp3play, audiere, pydub, and pygame all with the same results: no sound was played, yet no exceptions were raised. I have even used the same pygame code on a raspberry pi and successfully played an mp3 file. I have also tried converting it to a wav file, which has worked fine, only when I try to play it with pygame or winsound, the same thing happens. No sound, no exceptions. My current code uses winsound, playing a wav file that I can successfully play in the windows media player (I can even open it in windows media player from python, using os.startfile()). Here it is: winsound.PlaySound("file.wav", winsound.SND_FILENAME)    #the wav file is in the same directory as the program
 I am also trying to use pygame mixer an music modules. For example: init()                            #this is pygame.init(), I only imported init and the mixer module
pygame.mixer.init()               #initializes pygame.mixer
pygame.mixer.music.load(filename) #loads it in music
pygame.mixer.music.play()         #plays it in music
time.sleep(20)
 I have even played sounds from python successfully with the winsound and win32api Beep() functions. However, this obviously cannot play an mp3 or wav file. I have also tried a completely different text to speech engine, which plays the sound without an mp3 file in the mix, using pyttsx: import pyttsx

engine = pyttsx.init()

def tts(mytext):
    engine.say(mytext)
    engine.runAndWait()
 This has also failed to create sound, or raise an exception. Because of this pattern, I have a feeling that this has something to do with the system, but it doesn't seem like it is something obvious. Because this almost definitely has something to do with the hardware (pygame.mixer has worked this way on different hardware, and I am sure it usually works on windows) it may be important to know I am using a Toshiba laptop. Also, I am using python 2.7. Ideally, I would like to do this with pygame, because I have the most experience using it and there are some sound editing features I would like to access in pygame if at all possible. I also tried using 64 bit python (I was using 32 bit python on 64 bit windows 7). It still failed to work. I also tried playing an mp3 file inside a Ubuntu virtual box environment, but on the same device. It still didn't work. This isn't particularly surprising because virtualbox uses a lot of the resources (like screen and wifi) from the host operating system, hence it wouldn't necessarily play sounds any differently. Any way around this would be helpful. Some sounds play fine, just not specifically mp3 or wav files in python, so there is probably a solution.
@CODE:winsound.PlaySound("file.wav", winsound.SND_FILENAME)    #the wav file is in the same directory as the program init()                            #this is pygame.init(), I only imported init and the mixer module
pygame.mixer.init()               #initializes pygame.mixer
pygame.mixer.music.load(filename) #loads it in music
pygame.mixer.music.play()         #plays it in music
time.sleep(20) import pyttsx

engine = pyttsx.init()

def tts(mytext):
    engine.say(mytext)
    engine.runAndWait() print mp3 C:\Users\....\file.mp3 subprocess threading

@TITLE:TextureView throwing fatal signal 11 after resuming application
@CONTENT:I have a TextureView based on Romain Guy's example which can be found here. On Android 4.3 and 4.4, after a few rounds of pausing and resuming the application, the application crashes and the only trace of an error is a fatal signal 11 in LogCat. I created a test application which uses Romain Guy's exact code to see if it was something I had done in my code and Romain's code crashes with the fatal signal 11, too. I have determined that if I run the code with a Handler instead of a Thread, it does not seem to crash the application. The Handler should be running on the main UI thread (or at least I believe it is), which is perhaps suggesting it is a threading issue. I have also determined that the crash occurs during a call to canvas.drawX (drawColor, drawBitmap, drawRect, etc...). Locking and unlocking the canvas does not seem to be an issue. I suspect that the thread is being cancelled while some other code is still using the canvas, but I am having a very difficult time tracking the issue due to a lack of any real exceptions being thrown and the crash being fairly inconsistent. Any insights would be greatly appreciated.

@TITLE:Set icon to each node in Jtree
@CONTENT:I want to set for each node in my JTree a different icon, actually I'm loading each node from a data base, with a "while", I set each icon like a root, leaf or parent. Like this: All my declarations are global: private ResultSet myResultSet;
protected DefaultTreeModel treeModel;
private DefaultMutableTreeNode rootNode,childNode,parent1,parent2;
 And this is the code where I set my nodes: myResultSet=rtnNodes(); /*Method that returns a RS with my nodes*/
while(myResultSet.next()){
  switch(myResultSet.getInt(1)){  /*The first column is the type of node: root, parent, leaf...*/
    case 0: treeModel = new DefaultTreeModel((rootNode=new DefaultMutableTreeNode(myResultSet.getString(2)))); break;  /*root node*/
    case 1: case 4: parent1 = parent2 = makeNode(rootNode); break;  /*parent node*/
    case 2: makeNode(parent2); break;  /*leaf node*/
    case 3: parent2 = makeNode(parent1); break;  /*sub patern node*/
  } /*makeNode is the method where I create the nodes*/
}
 The method makeNode is this: public DefaultMutableTreeNode makeNode(DefaultMutableTreeNode parent){
  //The second column in the RS is the name of the node
  treeModel.insertNodeInto((childNode=new DefaultMutableTreeNode(myResultSet.getString(2))),parent,parent.getChildCount());
  return childNode;
}
 After to fill the treemodel with my nodes, I set the model to my JTree: myJTree.setModel(treeModel);
myJTree.getSelectionModel().setSelectionMode(TreeSelectionModel.SINGLE_TREE_SELECTION);
 But the problem is. when I try to set the icons. I create a subclass called myTreeRenderer, and I use this: myJTree.setCellRenderer(new treeRenderer());
 But it doesn't set the icons as I want, the subclass is: private ImageIcon root,parent,leaf;

public myTreeRenderer() {
   root=setIcons(2);  /*setIcons is a method that I dont publish in this post, that helps me to set the path of the icons*/
   parent=setIcons(3);
   leaf=setIcons(4);
}

@Override
public Component getTreeCellRendererComponent(JTree tree,Object value,boolean selected,boolean expanded,boolean leaf,int row,boolean hasFocus){               
   super.getTreeCellRendererComponent(tree,value,selected,expanded,leaf,row,hasFocus);
   DefaultMutableTreeNode nodo = (DefaultMutableTreeNode)value;
   TreeNode t = nodo.getParent();
   if(t!=null){
      setIcon(root);
   }
   return this;
}
 How I can set the icon for each node without using his name? The code of the subclass, as is, set all the nodes with the same icon, and each time I selected a node in the jtree, the getTreeCellRendererComponent runs, I don?t want this.
@CODE:private ResultSet myResultSet;
protected DefaultTreeModel treeModel;

@TITLE:linux bash - Parse date in custom format
@CONTENT:I have a date in a the %c format (could be any other) and I need to use it in the date command. %c is NOT the American format. It is the German one because it's a German server. This also did not work properly on an American server. (Locales set to German or American) This does not work (error included): user@server:~$ NOW=$(date +%c); echo $NOW
Do 19 Dez 2013 22:33:28 CET
user@server:~$ date --date="$NOW" +%d/%m/%Y
date: ung?ltiges Datum ?Do 19 Dez 2013 22:33:28 CET¡§
 (date: ung?ltiges Datum ?Do 19 Dez 2013 22:33:28 CET¡§ = date: invalid date ?Do 19 Dez 2013 22:33:28 CET¡§) The difficulty is that I don't know which locale or even whci dateformat will be used later since the user can set their own format. So a simple specific parsing solution ist not really going to work! But how do I do it? To gerneralize the issue: If I have a date format format1 (which could be any or at least one that can be reversed) I can use date to get a formatted date. But if I want to format it to another date (format2) how do I do it? Any solution using anything else than the coreutils is pointless since I am trying to develop a bash script for as many unix machines as possible. DATE=$(date "+$format1")

date --date="$DATE" "+$format2" # Error in most cases!
 This is needed because I have a command which the user can give a date format. This date string is going to be displayed. But in a later step I need to convert this date string into another fixed one. I can manipulate the whcih format the command will get and I can maniplulate the output (or what the user will see). I cannot run the command twice because it is very time consuming. Update: I have found something like a solution: # Modify $user_format so it can be parsed later
user_format="$user_format %s"

# Time consuming command which will print a date in the given format
output=$(time_consuming_command params "$user_format" more params)

# This will only display what $user_format used to be
echo ${output% *}

# A simple unix timestamp parsing ("${output##* }" will only return the timestamp)
new_formated_date=$(date -d "1970-01-01 ${output##* } sec UTC" "+$new_format")
 This is working and might be helpful to others. So I will share this with you.

 Here is the graph it creates As you can tell, this graph has intersecting lines, something one doesn't see in a line graph. When I isolate the points, and don't draw the lines, I get this result: As you can tell, there is a way to connect these points without intersecting lines. Why does matplotlib do this?

@LINK:/questions/20643245/phpstorm-code-hinting-for-array-of-object-arrays
@TITLE:PHPStorm Code Hinting for array of object arrays
@CONTENT:In PHPStorm, the Code Hinting for an object array is simple and awesome; class FooList {
    public function __construct(){
        $this->_fooList[] = new Foo(1);
        $this->_fooList[] = new Foo(2);
        $this->_fooList[] = new Foo(3);
        $this->_fooList[] = new Foo(4);
    }

    /**
     * @return Foo[]
     */
    getFoos() {
        return $this->_fooList;
    }
}
 So if I do... $fooList = new FooList();

foreach($fooList as $foo)
{
    // Nice hinting.
    $foo->FooMethod...
}
 PHPStorm understands that $fooList is an array of Foos, and therefore knows that $foo's type is Foo. The problem is that I want an array of FooList. $listOfLists[] = new FooList();
$listOfLists[] = new FooList();
$listOfLists[] = new FooList();
$listOfLists[] = new FooList();

foreach ($listOfLists as $fooList)
{
    foreach($fooList as $foo)
    {
        // No code hinting for $foo :(
    }
}
 I know that you can code hint manually inside the foreach, like... foreach ($listOfLists as $fooList)
{
    foreach($fooList as $foo)
    {
        /** $var $foo Foo */
        // Code hinting, yay!!
    }
}
 Or ... foreach ($listOfLists as $fooList)
{
    /** $var $fooList Foo[] */
    foreach($fooList as $foo)
    {
        // Code hinting, yay!!
    }
}
 But I think that is ugly, as $listOfLists is build of Foo arrays, it should know what I am talking about without reminding it every time I implement a listOfLists. Is there a way to implement this?
@CODE:class FooList {
    public function __construct(){
        $this->_fooList[] = new Foo(1);
        $this->_fooList[] = new Foo(2);
        $this->_fooList[] = new Foo(3);
        $this->_fooList[] = new Foo(4);
    }

    /**
     * @return Foo[]
     */
    getFoos() {
        return $this->_fooList;
    }
} $fooList = new FooList();

foreach($fooList as $foo)
{
    // Nice hinting.
    $foo->FooMethod...
} $listOfLists[] = new FooList();
$listOfLists[] = new FooList();
$listOfLists[] = new FooList();
$listOfLists[] = new FooList();

foreach ($listOfLists as $fooList)
{
    foreach($fooList as $foo)
    {
        // No code hinting for $foo :(
    }
} foreach ($listOfLists as $fooList)
{
    foreach($fooList as $foo)
    {
        /** $var $foo Foo */
        // Code hinting, yay!!
    }
} foreach ($listOfLists as $fooList)
{
    /** $var $fooList Foo[] */
    foreach($fooList as $foo)
    {
        // Code hinting, yay!!
    }

@TITLE:Execute a rake task on a remote server
@CONTENT:The physical architecture of the production environment includes several machines doing different jobs (rake tasks), all of them over the same database. One of the jobs would do a large UPDATE over a table that usually returns a postgres deadlock if the other jobs are running. I already have a rake task to gracefully stop the other jobs, but I can only execute it from the local machines. What I want to achieve is: task :big_update => :environment do
  stop_tasks_on_another_servers

  # do the SQL UPDATE
  ...
end
 where the stop_tasks_on_another_servers should execute a rake task on the other servers. My best try was to use the https://github.com/capistrano/sshkit gem. The same that Capistrano uses it, but I'm still missing a step here. I'm trying the following on a rails console in the production machine: require 'sshkit/dsl'
hosts = ['machine1', 'machine2']

on hosts do
  within "/home/me/project/current" do
    with rails_env: :production do
      rake "stop_tasks"
    end
  end
end
 But it returns: INFO [70a0610a] Running /usr/bin/env rake stop_tasks on machine1
SSHKit::Command::Failed: rake stdout: Nothing written
 What am I missing or is there an easier way to execute remote tasks?
@CODE:UPDATE task :big_update => :environment do

@CONTENT:The AngularJS documentation for $http at http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.$http states "The $http service will not actually send the request until the next $digest() is executed.". I was just wondering why it does not just make the HTTP request immediately? It seems like an unnecessary requirement, I wonder what I am missing. UPDATE: Its been suggested that this is necessary because the completion handlers will need to update the digest. However, those completion events will need to make their own $apply/$digest call later either way.

@TITLE:OSStatus error -67028 When Building Ad Hoc iOS App
@CONTENT:I'm getting an error when trying to do an archive build for ad hoc distribution on iOS for an iPhone-only app. The app is signed with the proper certificates and has the proper provisioning profile (checked with a friend who was able to sign properly as well, so it's not a code signing issue). Whenever I try to distribute with the Xcode archive panel, I get the following error message in an alert sheet: OSStatus error -67028
 I've never encountered this error before. I'm able to build and have the app run fine in both the simulator and device, but for whatever reason, I'm completely unable to get the distribution feature of Xcode to work to create an ad hoc build. Has anyone ran into this issue before? Things I've checked are: Code signing (generated all new certs and profiles to start from scratch) Files and frameworks The only thing that I could find with the files and frameworks that might be off is that the main Storyboard file (Main_iPhone.storyboard) couldn't be found in the Copy Bundle Resources, although the storyboard loads properly in Xcode and allows editing, and can be found in the Finder under the Base.lproj folder.

@CONTENT:I need to have a variable in a class which is an instance of class "ClassA" but which also implements interface "InterfaceI". Obviously this can be done for one or the other easily: private ClassA mVariable;
private InterfaceI mVaraible;
 but how can I enforce the object both extends ClassA and implements InterfaceB? Something like: private <? extends ClassA & InterfaceI> mVaraible;
 is what I need but I have no idea of the syntax or if it is even possible. I will also need a get and set method, but that can be done with generics (I think?) The obvious solution is public class ClassB extends ClassA implements InterfaceI{
    //whatever here
}
 However both InterfaceI and ClassA are part of an external libary, this libary has classes which extend ClassA and InterfaceI and I cant edit them to make them extend ClassB, therefore this solution will not work.
@CODE:private ClassA mVariable;
private InterfaceI mVaraible; private <? extends ClassA & InterfaceI> mVaraible; public class ClassB extends ClassA implements InterfaceI{

@LINK:/questions/20553740/storing-object-references-in-json
@TITLE:Storing object references in JSON
@CONTENT:I'm currently building a pretty complex AngularJS application that stores data in a sqlite database. My application data contains references to objects that are shared throughout the app. Angular is able to render this data, compare it, and everything has been fine so far. What do I mean by all of this? Check out this example for the "boilerplate" of the objects in my application. var Person = {
    name:'some person',
    owns:[]
}

var Cat = {
    name:'some cat'
}

var project = {
    name:'some project',
    people:[],
    cats:[]
}
 My application will allow users to create and manipulate these objects, and create relationships between them. Instances of Person may be created, and each Person object may store references to instances of Cat. As you may have already guessed, my project will eventually look like this after the user is done manipulating it. var project = {
    name:'some project',
    people:[person, person, person],
    cats:[cat, cat cat, cat, cat, cat]
}

console.log(project.people[0].owns)
//logs something like "cat, cat, cat". These are references.
 My application then has views set up to view each person and will list out the owns property, which contains the instances of Cat. All is fine in dandy until I realized that there may be complications storing this as JSON in a database. JSON.Stringify() and angular.toJSON() do not treat references as references, instead they read them as individual objects. I am hoping to gain some insights on the best way to preserve these relationships/references. Here are the two options that I believe I have. Option 1: Scrap the idea of storing this in JSON, and use a relational database to store everything. This isn't ideal because it starts to eat away at the flexible nature of object rendering in AngularJS. Additionally, this data will be stored in multiple places (online & locally) which may present differences in the database scheme which would be a debugging nightmare. Option 2: Store a unique identifier with each instance of Person and Cat. I can then use this identifier when rendering and creating the associations. This will work if I create custom filters in Angular, but globally removing references when objects are deleted could be a nightmare.
@CODE:var Person = {
    name:'some person',
    owns:[]
}

var Cat = {
    name:'some cat'
}

var project = {
    name:'some project',
    people:[],
    cats:[]
} Person Person Cat project var project = {
    name:'some project',
    people:[person, person, person],
    cats:[cat, cat cat, cat, cat, cat]
}

console.log(project.people[0].owns)
//logs something like "cat, cat, cat". These are references. person owns Cat JSON.Stringify() angular.toJSON() Person Cat project

@TITLE:How to move MVC 5 IdentityModels.cs into a separate assembly
@CONTENT:I wonder if someone ran into the issue that I am having with trying to move ApplicationUser into Models project (where all other models reside including the ones related to Users table). My test MVC 5 solution consists of a web project and two class libraries: one for data access layer (DAL) and the other for Models. I references AspNet.Identity.EntityFramework in all three projects. In my DAL class I implement Repository pattern and a UnitOfWork. UnitOfWork extends IdentityDbContext<ApplicationUser>. ApplicationUser : IdentityUser is in Models class library. In my web project UnitOfWork is instantiated using Autofac DI. For regular controllers I defined a base class that inherits from Controller and takes IUnitOfWork as a parameter in the constructor. All controllers inherit from my custom base controller. I ran into a problem with AccountController. It has two constructors: one with no parameters that seems to instantiate ApplicationDbContext, the other takes UserManager as a parameter. The parameter-less constructor gives me most of the grief. I tried many things: make accountcontroller inherit from my custom base controller, then try to inherit it from the Controller class. At best I succeed in making my solution compile but when I test the app and fill out user Registration form I get 'Object is not instantiated' message. When I debug I see that the second constructor in AccountController gets called but UserManager is null there. Any ideas? I would really appreciate somebody's brainy input into this.

 In the line T tSum = T(); // tSum = 0
 they are saying it will call the default constructor for particular type (based on the type we call this function). My doubt is how this call assigning the value to tSum, as this will call the constructor fine. but since constructor does not return anything how iSum is initialized to 0 for int or 0.0 for double.

@CONTENT:I have designed a JSON representation of a mailbox so that I can look up mails easily, for example mailjson[UID].Body. However after looking at Angularjs and Ember, templating MVC JS engines, it seems that the JSON should be of the format: [{

   "body": "Blah blah blah..."
 },
 {
   "id": 2,
   "body": "More blah foo blah"
 },
 {

 And then there is some findAll(id) function to grab the item based on the id one wants, that iterates through the JSON. So now I'm wondering does my JSON design have merit? Am I doing it wrong? Why don't people use the dict lookup design I'm using with my JSON? Any other tips to make sure I have a good data structure design, I would be grateful.

@LINK:/questions/20468564/why-is-1-right-shift-1-1-in-java
@TITLE:Why is -1 right shift 1 = -1 in Java?
@CONTENT:I came across the question "Why is -1 zero fill right shift 1=2147483647 for integers in Java?" I understood the concept of zero fill right shift perfectly well from the above question's answer. But when I tried to find -1>>1, I am getting a totally complex answer which I felt difficult to understand. 
-1 in binary form is as follows: 11111111111111111111111111111111
After flipping the bits, I got:  00000000000000000000000000000000
Upon adding 1 to it, I got:      00000000000000000000000000000001
Now shifting one position right: 00000000000000000000000000000000 
After flipping the bits, I got:  11111111111111111111111111111111
Now adding 1 to it:              00000000000000000000000000000000
 I don't understand how -1>>1 is -1 itself, then?

@TITLE:No source for ruby-1.9.2-p321 provided with debugger-ruby_core_source gem
@CONTENT:I recently updated to Mavericks. Added Command Line tools for xcode. Tried "bundle update debugger", along with every other fix I found, including this rake add_source to include the appropriate header found here:http://sponsorpay.github.io/blog/2012/06/11/ruby-debugger-and-no-source-for-ruby-error/, and I still cannot push my project to heroku without errors. Any help is appreciated. Thanks in advance. Update: Found this but not sure how to do it. "Gems such as debugger-linecache require explicit patch levels of Ruby, this is fine for development, but should not be used in production. If you have one of these Gems in production and the patch of Ruby gets upgraded your deploy will fail. The fix is to move your dependency out of the production group of your Gemfile."

@TITLE:Inconsistent behaviour of primitive integer types in Java
@CONTENT:Can someone explain to me like I'm five why I get different behaviour for two of four primitive types representing integers in Java? AFAIK all four are signed and they all use the most significant bit as a sign bit, so why do byte and short behave normally, and int and long act, well, strange? The fragment of oracle docs explaining this would be perfect. byte a = (byte) (Math.pow(2, 7)-1); //127 - as expected
short b = (short) (Math.pow(2, 15)-1); //32767 - as expected
int c = (int) (Math.pow(2, 31)-1); //2147483647 - as expected
long d = (long) (Math.pow(2, 63)-1); //9223372036854775807 - as expected

a = (byte) (Math.pow(2, 7)); //-128 - as expected
b = (short) (Math.pow(2, 15)); //-32768 - as expected
c = (int) (Math.pow(2, 31)); //2147483647 - why not '-2147483648'?
d = (long) (Math.pow(2, 63)); //9223372036854775807 - why not '-9223372036854775808'?

a = (byte) (Math.pow(2, 8)); //0 - as expected
b = (short) (Math.pow(2, 16)); //0 - as expected
c = (int) (Math.pow(2, 32)); //2147483647 - why not '0'?
d = (long) (Math.pow(2, 64)); //9223372036854775807 - why not '0'?

Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.45-b08, mixed mode)
 EDIT, after reading all the answers and tuning my code. So, to sum up, the only way I found to get expected values is the use of BigInteger. Shift operator works well for bytes, shorts and ints, but when it comes to longs, I cought it on one malfunction. byte a = (byte) ((1l << 7) - 1); //127 - as expected
short b = (short) ((1l << 15) - 1); //32767 - as expected
int c = (int) (1l << 31) - 1; //2147483647 - as expected
long d = (1l << 63) - 1; //9223372036854775807 - as expected

a = (byte) (1l << 7); //-128 - as expected
b = (short) (1l << 15); //-32768 - as expected
c = (int) 1l << 31; //-2147483648 - as expected
d = 1l << 63; //-9223372036854775808 - as expected

a = (byte) (1l << 8); //0 - as expected
b = (short) (1l << 16); //0 - as expected
c = (int) (1l << 32); //0 - as expected
d = 1l << 64; //1 instead of 0, probably because of the word length limitation      
 With BigInteger everything works flawlessly byte a = (byte) (new BigInteger("2").pow(7).longValue() - 1); //127 - as expected
short b = (short) (new BigInteger("2").pow(15).longValue() - 1); //32767 - as expected
int c = (int) (new BigInteger("2").pow(31).longValue() - 1); //2147483647 - as expected
long d = (new BigInteger("2").pow(63).longValue() - 1); //9223372036854775807 - as expected

a = (byte) (new BigInteger("2").pow(7).longValue()); //-128 - as expected
b = (short) (new BigInteger("2").pow(15).longValue()); //-32768 - as expected
c = (int) new BigInteger("2").pow(31).longValue(); //-2147483648 - as expected
d = new BigInteger("2").pow(63).longValue(); //-9223372036854775808 - as expected

a = (byte) (new BigInteger("2").pow(8).longValue()); //0 - as expected
b = (short) (new BigInteger("2").pow(16).longValue()); //0 - as expected
c = (int) (new BigInteger("2").pow(32).longValue()); //0 - as expected
d = new BigInteger("2").pow(64).longValue(); //0 - as expected

@TITLE:Different result for [NSDate date] in several devices
@CONTENT:To start, I have to say that I set autoset in date&time settings and time zone is the same for each device. So I use [NSDate date] to get time stamp in milliseconds, then encode to NSData and send to another device. On receiver data is being decoded and subtract with new [NSDate date]. So that I get total time needed for send and receive message. That I was thought because when sender is iPhone 4 iOS6 and receiver is iPhone 5 iOS7 then receiver have earlier time stamp than sender. I don't know why? Maybe [NSData date] isn't the most reliable class for that kind of operations? I use GCDAsyncUdpSocket for sending/receiving UDP. Code sender NSData *data2 = [self createRandomNSData:8192];
NSMutableData *dataToSend =[NSMutableData data];
[dataToSend appendBytes:&tag length:sizeof(int)];
long long currentTimeStamp = (long long)([[NSDate date] timeIntervalSince1970]*1000.0);
[dataToSend appendBytes:&currentTimeStamp length:sizeof(long long)];
[dataToSend appendData:data2];
NSLog(@"%i || %lld || %lu",tag, currentTimeStamp,(unsigned long)[dataToSend length]);
[_udpSocket sendData:dataToSend toHost:@"230.0.0.1" port:_port withTimeout:-1 tag:tag];
tag++;
 Code receiver char* dataBytes = [data bytes];
int inTag;
long long inCurrentTimeStamp;
[data getBytes:&inTag length:sizeof(int)];
[data getBytes:&inCurrentTimeStamp range:NSMakeRange(sizeof(int), sizeof(long long))];

@LINK:/questions/20395132/cookie-is-null-in-rare-cases-after-redirecting-to-acs-and-back
@TITLE:Cookie is null in rare cases after redirecting to ACS and back
@CONTENT:On my website, there is a registration form. After having filled this in, the user gets redirected to Azure ACS in order to log in. After having logged in, the user gets redirected back to my website and is to be registered and logged in. The registration form is submitted by a JavaScript. The information that the user has filled in is saved to a cookie by the RedirectToProvider method in the RegisterController and the user is redirected to ACS. When the user has been redirected back to the website from ACS, the cookie is then read by the RegisterUser method in the RegisterController. The problem is: this works 95% of the time. 5% of the time, the cookie is null when the user comes back. I have been unable to track the cause of this and am wondering if there are any known issues or something that I may have overseen. The form code looks like this: @using (Html.BeginForm("RedirectToProvider", "Register", FormMethod.Post, new { id = "registerForm" }))

    ... various fields...

    <input type="button" class="btn" id="registerSubmitButton" value="Register" onclick="RegisterRedirect()" />
}
 The RegisterRedirect() JavaScript that submits the form (with irrelevant functionality left out here): var RegisterRedirect = function () {
    $("#registerForm").valid();
    $("#registerForm").submit();
}
 The RedirectToProvider method in the RegisterController: [AllowAnonymous]
[HttpPost]
public ActionResult RedirectToProvider(RegisterViewModel viewModel)
{
    if (ModelState.IsValid)
    {
        var providerUrl = viewModel.SelectedProviderUrl;
        viewModel.SelectedProviderUrl = "";

        var json = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(viewModel);

        try
        {
            var cookie = new HttpCookie("RegisterViewModel", json)
                {
                    Expires = DateTime.Now.AddMinutes(10)
                };
            ControllerContext.HttpContext.Response.Cookies.Add(cookie);
        }
        catch (FormatException)
        {
            return RedirectToAction("Index", "Error", new { reason = "Cookie saving error." });
        }
        return Redirect(providerUrl);
    }
    return RedirectToAction("Index", "Error", new { reason = "Invalid data. Try again." });
}
 The user is redirected to ACS and chooses to log in with, for example, Gmail. ACS calls back to my ClaimsAuthenticationManager (configured in web.config). Afterwards, the method to be called back to (configured in ACS) is called and in turn calls the RegisterUser method that is supposed to read the cookie: [Authorize]
public ActionResult RegisterUser(User user){
    var cookie = ControllerContext.HttpContext.Request.Cookies["RegisterViewModel"];
    if (cookie != null){
        ... registers the user...
    }
}
 95% of the time, the cookie is not null. 5% of the time, something fails and the cookie is null. The fail rate is higher during the first builds of the website after the Azure Emulator has just started, and lower later on. I have read that it could have something to do with sessions. Does anyone see an obvious error or have any advice? Thanks in advance for any help!

@CONTENT:I have made a small application using jQuery datepicker. I am setting unavailable dates to it from json file which looks like this: {"dates":["2013-12-11","2013-12-10","2013-12-07","2013-12-04"]}.
 I would like to check if a date given is already in this list and remove it if so. My current code looks like this: if(isset($_GET['date'])) //the date given
{
    if($_GET['roomType']==2)
    {
        $myFile = "bookedDates2.json";
        $date = $_GET['date'];
        if(file_exists($myFile))
        {
            $arr = json_decode(file_get_contents($myFile),true);
            if (!in_array($date, $arr['dates']))
            {
            $arr['dates'][] = $_GET['date'];   //adds the date into the file if it is not there already
            }
            else
            {

                foreach ($arr['dates'] as $key => $value)
                {
                    if (in_array($date, $arr['dates']))
                    {
                        unset($arr['dates'][$key]);
                        array_values($arr['dates']);

                    }
                }

            }
        }
            $arr = json_encode($arr);
            file_put_contents($myFile,$arr);

    }
 My problem here is that after I encode the array again, it looks like this {"dates":["1":"2013-12-11","2":"2013-12-10","3":"2013-12-07","4":"2013-12-04"]}
 Is there a way to find the date match in the json file and remove it, w/o the keys appearing after the encode? Any help is appreciated.
@CODE:datepicker {"dates":["2013-12-11","2013-12-10","2013-12-07","2013-12-04"]}. if(isset($_GET['date'])) //the date given

@TITLE:Java multithreading - thread priority
@CONTENT:Can anybody explain how thread priority works in java. The confusion here is if java does'nt guarantee the implementation of the Thread according to its priority then why is this setpriority() function used for. My code is as follows : public class ThreadSynchronization implements Runnable{

    public synchronized void run() {
        System.out.println("Starting Implementation of Thread "+Thread.currentThread().getName());
        for(int i=0;i<10;i++)
        {
            System.out.println("Thread "+Thread.currentThread().getName()+" value : "+i);
        }
        System.out.println("Ending Implementation of Thread "+Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Program starts...");
        ThreadSynchronization th1 = new ThreadSynchronization();
        Thread t1 = new Thread(th1);
        t1.setPriority(1);
        synchronized(t1)
        {
            t1.start();

            t2.start(); 
        }

        System.out.println("Program ends...");
    }
}
 In the above program even if I change the priority I find no difference in the output. Also a real time application of how thread priority can be used would be of great help. Thanks.

@TITLE:IE throws Security Error when calling toDataUrl on canvas
@CONTENT:first of all, I know that accessing toDataURL method of canvas when its source image is from another origin is a security issue. but in my case, I am using data: url as the source of my img and then use img and draw it on canvas and then call canvas.toDataUrl. this works fine on Chrome and Firefox but fails with security error in IE! any idea? ...

}
image.src = URL.createObjectURL(new Blob([svgxml], {type: "image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8" }))
 Here is the quote from svgopen.org Transferring data from SVG to Canvas has security issues, which cause Canvas to become write-only. We argue that these issues could be avoided with our SVG.toDataURL() proposal (section "Recommendations"). Same Origin and Canvas Origin Policy Web pages are composed of different elements coming from different origins. Elements coming from the same origin are considered to be safe [Origin10]. Canvas has powerful image reading and writing capabilities. It would be trivial to use canvas as middleman for transfering a local image to a third-party just by loading image into Canvas element from file:// -URL and then sending the pixel data from the Canvas element to any host with JavaScript. To prevent information leakage with Canvas, browsers are carefully protecting the usage of Canvas when the source for image data is not safe. All Canvas elements are created as their origin-clean attribute set to true. When any of the actions that may potentially be used for using Canvas element to transfer content that violates the same origin policy, the origin-clean property is permanently set to false. If methods that return the pixel data stored in canvas, such as toDataURL() or getImageData(), are called on the Canvas element whose origin-clean is false, then a DOMException 18 SECURITY_ERR is raised [Canvas10]. But I am creating SVG on the fly in the browser.

 d3.behavior.zoom() supports autoscaling of x and y axes. However, I have to scale two y axes at the same time. When zoom() is triggered, I can get the current scale and translate info from d3.event.scale and d3.event.translate, but I cant figure out how to make appropriate scale for the second y axis(y2) with them. I am also looking at https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Quantitative-Scales. Since y1's range is automatically adjusted by zoom, if there is a way to get y1's current range, I can get its min and max and set y2's range based on them. However, the document doesn't specify a way to get range given a scale object.

@TITLE:Fast Numerical Integration in Python
@CONTENT:I have a program that involves computing a definite integral many times, and have been struggling to find a way to do so quickly. The integrals I need to solve are of the following form: I have to solve this integral for many different values of r, which affects both the limits of integration and also the integrand (through the function g). Because of this, I have not found a way to vectorize the problem and must instead rely on loops. This significantly slows down the problem, because I need to make function calls in each loop. Below is one way to do it using loops (using made up data and functions): import numpy as np 

f = lambda x: x**2
g = lambda x: np.log(x)

b=1000
r = np.arange(10,500,10)
a = 1.1*r+r**-1

def loop1(r,a):
    integration_range=[np.linspace(a[i],b,1000) for i in range(len(a))]
    out=np.zeros(len(r))
    i=0
    while i<len(r):
        out[i]=np.trapz(f(integration_range[i])*a_pdf(integration_range[i]-r[i]),integration_range[i])
        i=i+1
    return out  
 This takes approximately 17.7 ms, which is too slow for my current needs. I don't care too much about getting the integrals to be super precise; I would be happy with a solution that gave approximations within 1% of the true value. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

@LINK:/questions/20303032/unable-to-successfully-link-to-sdl2-libs-i-get-undefined-reference-for-all-sdl
@TITLE:Unable to successfully link to SDL2 libs. I get undefined reference for all SDL functions i use
@CONTENT:I'm relatively new to programming and I've decided to give SDL a try, but I'm a bit stuck. I haven't been able to build the project in codeblocks and I get 'undefined reference' to all SDL functions. I've seen a lot of similar questions here, but none of the solutions seems to help. I've already added the \include\SDL2 and the \lib folders to search directories, I've added SDL2Main and SDL2 to link libraries in linker options, I've even added -mwindows to other linker options. Also, I tried linking against the 64-bit version as well, but things got even worse. Here's my source code, pretty much copied straight out of the tutorial I started: #include <SDL.h>
SDL_Window* g_pWindow = 0;
SDL_Renderer* g_pRenderer = 0;
int main(int argc, char* args[])
    {
        // initialize SDL
    if(SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_EVERYTHING) >= 0)
    {
    // if succeeded create our window
        g_pWindow = SDL_CreateWindow("Chapter 1: Setting up SDL",
        SDL_WINDOWPOS_CENTERED, SDL_WINDOWPOS_CENTERED,
        640, 480,
        SDL_WINDOW_SHOWN);
        // if the window creation succeeded create our renderer
        if(g_pWindow != 0)
        {
            g_pRenderer = SDL_CreateRenderer(g_pWindow, -1, 0);
        }
    }
    else
    {
        return 1; // sdl could not initialize
    }
    // everything succeeded lets draw the window
    // set to black // This function expects Red, Green, Blue and
    // Alpha as color values
    SDL_SetRenderDrawColor(g_pRenderer, 0, 0, 0, 255);
    // clear the window to black
    SDL_RenderClear(g_pRenderer);
    // show the window
    SDL_RenderPresent(g_pRenderer);
    // set a delay before quitting
    SDL_Delay(5000);
    // clean up SDL
    SDL_Quit();
        return 0;
}

@CONTENT:I want to disable or enable collision with object in unity 2d game based on its tag. Lets say I have object with tag "foo1" and objects with tag "foo2". If user choose to collide with objects "foo1" then it should not collide with objects "foo2". How could I achieve this? I tried this:  void OnCollisionEnter(Object other)
 {
      if (other.tag == "foo1")
          collider.enabled = false;
 }
 But this is not working for two reasons. First object has to have isTrigger set to true (this could not be set for objects that serves as ground) and if I disable entire collider then object will fall through ground. I am new to unity and I will study it in more details but I am asking for quick help and maybe idea how to do this?

dim2 = np.random.randint(3, 5, size=n)
data1 = np.random.randint(10, 20, size=n)

        return 0
    else:
        return (x['val1'].sum())*1.0/x['val2'].sum()*1.0
 Grouping by one of the columns and aggregating returns a result: df.groupby(['a']).aggregate(h)['val1']
 Albeit it converts all the existing columns to the desired result rather than adding a new column Grouping by two columns leads to an error when using aggregate: df.groupby(['a','b']).aggregate(h)['val1']

KeyError: 'val2'
 But switching aggregate for apply seems to work. I have two questions: Why does apply work and not aggregte? If after grouping a dataframe by some set of keys, I want to use a function that aggregates group values as a new column, what's the best way to do that? Thanks in advance.

@TITLE:When to use Binomial Heap?
@CONTENT:Binomial Heap has quite special design. Personally I don't think this design is intuitive. Although posts such as What is the difference between binary heaps and binomial heaps? talks about diff and its speciality, I am still wondering when I should use it. In http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_heap, it says Because of its unique structure, a binomial tree of order k can be constructed from two trees of order k?1 trivially by attaching one of them as the leftmost child of root of the other one. This feature is central to the merge operation of a binomial heap, which is its major advantage over other conventional heaps. I presumes that an advantage of Binomial Heap is its merge. However, Leftist heap also has O(logN) merge and much simpler, why we still use Binomial Heap? When should I use Binomial Heap? edit One of the actual question I wanna ask here is What's exactly the advantage of Binomial Heap?

@TITLE:Is it possible to directly access the radio signals on iOS or Android phones?
@CONTENT:I am interested in directly accessing the radio signal input/output in iOS or Android phone devices. This could be the WiFi and/or the cellular radio signal. I want to get at the digital equivalent of a digital oscilloscope trace of what radio signal going out of the phone and what radio signal is being received by the phone. Ultimately, a phone transmits and receives radio signals, and then a lot of signal processing is done to those signals to turn them into useful information like digital data / GSM data, etc. What is the best way using software running on the device to directly access the radio signal that is transmitted out of the device (the raw radio signal waveform) or the radio signal that is received by the device (the raw radio signal waveform)? I'd like to: Directly access the output radio signal. Directly access the input radio signal. This would be the raw signal intensity, e.g. in samples vs. time at a high sampling rate (kHz/MHz). This would basically be the equivalent of what a digitally-recording oscilloscope attached to a radio frequency antenna would receive while sitting next to the phone itself.

Can anyone test this on their server to see if they experience the same behavior? I have tested this on both my Development and Testing machines.

 So as you can guess, the: map: THREE.ImageUtils.loadTexture("images/circle.png");
 is the problem. With Firefox it works very well.

It is just an image on my hard drive with HTML and JS files, no server, no "origin".

@TITLE:How to know if a listener gets the message in JMS?
@CONTENT:I'm using Spring JMS and ActiveMQ to send message from one sender to multiple listeners asynchronously. All listeners subscribe to an ActiveMQ Topic so that the message can be delivered to them. I want to know if a particular listener gets the message from the sender. Is there a way to achieve this? Edit: Added the JMS sender and listener classes This is my message sender class: public class CustomerStatusSender {
    private JmsTemplate jmsTemplate;
    private Topic topic;

    public void setJmsTemplate(JmsTemplate jmsTemplate) {
        this.jmsTemplate = jmsTemplate;
    }

    public void setTopic(Topic topic) {
        this.topic = topic;
    }

    public void simpleSend(final String customerStatusMessage) {
        jmsTemplate.send(topic, new MessageCreator() {
            public Message createMessage(Session session) throws JMSException {
                TextMessage message = session.createTextMessage("hello from sender.");
                message.setStringProperty("content", customerStatusMessage);
                return message;
            }
        });
    }
}
 And this is one of the message listeners: public class CustomerStatusListener implements MessageListener {
    public void onMessage(Message message) {
        if (message instanceof TextMessage) {
            try {
                System.out.println("Subscriber 1 got you! The message is: "
                        + message.getStringProperty("content"));
            } catch (JMSException ex) {
                throw new RuntimeException(ex);
            }
        }

 Upon calling simpleSend() method in the sender class, all listeners subscribed to this topic will get this message asynchronously. But I want to know if this particular CustomerStatusListener receives the message from the message sender. How to do it asynchronously? I assume that I can't use ReplyTo in the sender and listener as suggested in one of the answers if I want to do it asynchronously. What do I need to add in the sender and listener classes to get message receipt confirmation from the listener?
@CODE:public class CustomerStatusSender {
    private JmsTemplate jmsTemplate;
    private Topic topic;

    public void setJmsTemplate(JmsTemplate jmsTemplate) {
        this.jmsTemplate = jmsTemplate;
    }

    public void setTopic(Topic topic) {
        this.topic = topic;
    }

    public void simpleSend(final String customerStatusMessage) {
        jmsTemplate.send(topic, new MessageCreator() {
            public Message createMessage(Session session) throws JMSException {
                TextMessage message = session.createTextMessage("hello from sender.");
                message.setStringProperty("content", customerStatusMessage);
                return message;
            }
        });
    }
} public class CustomerStatusListener implements MessageListener {
    public void onMessage(Message message) {
        if (message instanceof TextMessage) {
            try {
                System.out.println("Subscriber 1 got you! The message is: "
                        + message.getStringProperty("content"));
            } catch (JMSException ex) {
                throw new RuntimeException(ex);
            }

@TITLE:Assigning out parameters in Moq for methods that return void
@CONTENT:In this question, I found an this answer that seems to be the best way to solve the problem to me. The provided code assumes that the function that is mocked returns a value: bool SomeFunc(out ISomeObject o);
 However, the object I want to mock has an out function as follows: void SomeFunc(out ISomeObject o);
 The relevant code fragment from the mentioned answer: public delegate void OutAction<TOut>(out TOut outVal);

public static IReturnsThrows<TMock, TReturn> OutCallback<TMock, TReturn, TOut>(
    this ICallback<TMock, TReturn> mock, OutAction<TOut> action)
    where TMock : class
{
    // ...
}
 Void is not a valid type for TReturn. So I believe I would have to somehow adapt this code to get it to work with methods returning void. But how?
@CODE:bool SomeFunc(out ISomeObject o); void SomeFunc(out ISomeObject o); public delegate void OutAction<TOut>(out TOut outVal);

public static IReturnsThrows<TMock, TReturn> OutCallback<TMock, TReturn, TOut>(
    this ICallback<TMock, TReturn> mock, OutAction<TOut> action)

@TITLE:Need to store high precision decimal values in MongoDB
@CONTENT:I have little experience with MongoDB. I am usual working on large scale SQL server DBs. MongoDB only supports double and there is no decimal. The C# driver serializes decimals as strings. What functionality do I miss if I store decimals as strings in MongoDB? Is there a way to set a default serialization of decimals as double (AllowTruncation) without having to put an Attribute on each property? What do I lose in precision if I used Bson double? Thanks for your help! UPDATE I have an existing application model that uses decimals in C#. I want to use MongoDB as a new DB layer and change as little in the existing app as possible. Thats why I am looking for a way to map decimals in C# to double in MongoDB. I understand that I loose precision and would have to analyze the side effects of it. My only remaining question is to know if there is a way to set a default serialization of decimals as double. Thanks again. Great answers and comments so far.

So, while I was checking stackoverflow, I knew many people are running emulators like this one: Where is Soft Buttons on KitKat Emulator? But whats the problem in mine? I did give it enough properties so that it would work fine(like VM space), but I know that Kitkat can work on memory constrained devices also (as seen in dev bytes on youtube), so I guess thats not a problem. In short how do I setup an emulator specifically for Android phones(not tablets) preferably for google nexus 5. Any guidance or help would be greatly appreciated.

@CONTENT:I am using R and want to use the twitteR package available on CRAN. I installed the twitteR package using: install.packages(twitteR)
 then loaded the package with: library(twitteR)
 after that I wanted to run the first command to get the latest trends on twitter with: getTrends(period="weekly")
 which showed following error: Error in getTrends(period = "weekly") : 
argument "woeid" is missing, with no default
 Also the command: searchTwitter("#orms")
 showed an error, namely: Error in twInterfaceObj$doAPICall(cmd, params, "GET", ...) : 
OAuth authentication is required with Twitter's API v1.1
 And also for the command: userTimeline("informs")
 there was an error output: Error in twInterfaceObj$doAPICall(cmd, params, method, ...) : 
OAuth authentication is required with Twitter's API v1.1
 What is the reason for that? From my research so far I figured out, it has something to do with oauth. But actually I don't know, what oauth is, and how to configure it, so I can properly use the twitteR package. Could please anybody provide me some help for this issue?? Thank you very much in advance for your support. With best regards!!!

I know next to nothing about the inner workings of a programming language, so to me it seems easy to make an array's length changeable. I assume that there is a good reason for array lengths being immutable, probably related to performance. Does anybody know this reason? Sorry if this question has been asked before. If it has, I didn't find it in about 10 minutes of searching. EDIT: I know that when an array is is initialized, a certain amount of memory is allocated. Why can't more memory be allocated?

@TITLE:Change tint color of UIAlertview and UIActionsheet buttons
@CONTENT:I am trying to adapt my application for iOS 7. The issue I am having is I can not change the tint color of some controls. I did add self.window = [[[UIWindow alloc] initWithFrame:[[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds]] autorelease];

    self.window.tintColor = [self greenTintColor];
 to my app delegate's            - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application

 It mostly helped but color of message box and action sheet buttons is still the default blue. How can I recolor all such buttons too? Some screenshots:

@LINK:/questions/19990835/issue-with-cindent-indentation-based-on-scope-in-switch-case-statements-in-vim
@TITLE:Issue with cindent indentation based on scope in switch/case statements in VIM
@CONTENT:I currently have the following set in my indentation settings for C in VIM: set cinoptions=l1
 This allows autoindent to automatically handle indentations for case statements so I get the following type of alignment automatically: switch(intForSwitching) {
   case 1: {
      // Comment
      // More comments
      break;
   }
   case 2: {
      //Comment
      break;
   }
   default: {
      break;
   }
}
 However, this only works if each case (after the statement) is wrapped with braces, {}. I only use braces in case statements if I need to declare new temporary variables in just that case, as it introduces a new level of block scope. So, the following example, gives indentation I do not want, as the case statement is aligned with the code that it executes, which makes it harder to separate case statements from code chunks associated with them: // This is what I get
switch(intForSwitching) {
   case 1: {
      // Comment
      // More comments
      break;
   }
   case 2:
   //Comment
   break;
   default:
   break;
}

// This is what I want
switch(intForSwitching) {
   case 1: {
      // Comment
      // More comments
      break;
   }
   case 2:
      //Comment
      break;
   default:
      break;
}
 Additionally, ifdef statements are not working anymore. Previously, autoindent would align all preprocessor directives at column zero, ie: char c;
if (c) {
#ifdef TESTING
   printf("%c", c);
#endif
}
 Now, it aligns it with the code, which I do not want. ie: char c;
if (c) {
   #ifdef TESTING
   printf("%c", c);
   #endif
}
 Is there a way to retain the existing alignment for when I use braces to surround an individual case, and also have similar alignment for the case where I don't use braces? Thank you.
@CODE:set cinoptions=l1 case switch(intForSwitching) {
   case 1: {

      //Comment
      break;
   }
   default: {
      break;
   }
} {} // This is what I get

   case 1: {
      // Comment

@TITLE:What to use instead of mudflap with gcc/llvm (for detecting memory access bugs)?
@CONTENT:It seems that the -fmudflap feature was removed from GCC. Thus my question: what to use instead of it for dynamically analyzing programs for out-of-bound read/writes, uninitialized reads and such issues? (and perhaps as a side question: why was it removed?) The approach of mudflap (instrumentalizing generated code inside the compiler) looks quite elegant. Background Other tools instrumentalize on a machine-code level (e.g. Purify), on a source-code level (e.g. Insure) or instrumentalize during the emulation of a CPU (e.g. Valgrind). The mudflap approach has the potential to find errors which can't be detected by valgrind or purify (e.g. stack based array access errors). It is also more lightweight than other approaches. I am searching for an open source solution.

If I open the project in VS2013 (just installed) and do the same, blank page named SQLQuery1.sql and a basic connection to SQL Express (ie. master, model, etc.) MS page tells me Tools / Options / Visual Database tools - but this doesn't exist on my installation!

@LINK:/questions/19978380/cross-domain-javascript-callback-is-not-supported-in-authenticated-services-aja
@TITLE:Cross domain javascript callback is not supported in authenticated services. AJAX query to WCF service via SSL proxy
@CONTENT:I have a WCF / SVC web service which is consumed by a JavaScript call via AJAX. The page is accessed via a SSL proxy (https://gate.company.com/MyPage) located in the DMZ which then forwards the request to the internal webserver (http://myLocalWebServer/MyPage). After a lot of googeling and trying around, I was able to make it work, playing around with the parameters crossDomainScriptAccessEnabled and Access-Control-Allow-Origin. Although, it does only work if the authentication mode is set to false or if the user is not logged in yet. As soon as the call is made from within a page on which you need to be logged in (forms authentication), it does not work any more. The error message I get then is: cross domain javascript callback is not supported in authenticated services
 It does work again, however, once I logout and do the call from a non-protected page. My service looks like this namespace MyNameSpace
{
   [ServiceContract(Namespace = "MyNameSpace")]
   [AspNetCompatibilityRequirements(RequirementsMode = AspNetCompatibilityRequirementsMode.Allowed)]
   public class Service
   {
      [OperationContract]
       public string[] GetDropDownData(string id)
      {
         List<string> resultList = new List<string>();
         ...
         return resultList.ToArray();
      }
   }
}
 The service call and the callback method in JavaScript: function fillDropdwon(dropId){
    jQuery.ajax({
        type: "POST",
        dataType: "jsonp",
        contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8",
        cache: true,
        url: "Service.svc/GetDropDownData",
        data: '{"dropId":"' + dropId + '"}',
        jsonpCallback: "onDone",
        error: function (a,b,c) {
            alert("error");
        }
    });
}

// Callback-Methode after ServiceCall
function onDone(result) {
   var theDropDown = jQuery("#<%= cboSelection.ClientID %>");
    if (theDropDown.length > 0) {
        //Clear the old entries
        theDropDown.empty();

        //Add an empty entry
        if ("<%= cboSelection.ShowEmptyRow %>".toLowerCase() == "true") {
            theDropDown.append($('<option></option>'));
        }

        // Add the found items
        for (var i = 0; i < result.length; i++) {
            var text = result[i];
            theDropDown.append($('<option></option>').val(text).html(text));
        }
    }
}
 The web.config part which concerns the service: <system.serviceModel>
  <behaviors>
    <endpointBehaviors>
      <behavior name="MyNameSpace.ServiceAspNetAjaxBehavior">
        <enableWebScript />
      </behavior>
    </endpointBehaviors>
    <serviceBehaviors>
      <behavior>
        <serviceMetadata httpGetEnabled="true" />
      </behavior>
    </serviceBehaviors>
  </behaviors>
  <serviceHostingEnvironment aspNetCompatibilityEnabled="true" multipleSiteBindingsEnabled="true" />
  <standardEndpoints>
    <webScriptEndpoint>
      <standardEndpoint crossDomainScriptAccessEnabled="true" name=""/>
    </webScriptEndpoint>
  </standardEndpoints>
  <services>
    <service name="MyNameSpace.Service">
      <!-- Service endpoint for HTTPS -->
      <endpoint address="" behaviorConfiguration="MyNameSpace.ServiceAspNetAjaxBehavior" binding="webHttpBinding" bindingConfiguration="jsonpBinding" contract="MyNameSpace.Service" /> -->
    </service>
  </services>
  <bindings>
    <webHttpBinding>
      <binding name="jsonpBinding" crossDomainScriptAccessEnabled="true">
        <security mode="None" />
      </binding>
      <binding name="jsonpSslBinding" crossDomainScriptAccessEnabled="true">
        <security mode="Transport" />
      </binding>
    </webHttpBinding>
  </bindings>
</system.serviceModel>
 I first tried to use the ASP.NET AJAX Proxy to call the service, but this did not work because the call was made to the webserver directly, which is not SSL and the error I got was more or less: 'Page https://gate.company.com/MyPage tried to load not save content from page http://myLocalWebServer/MyPage...'. That is why I used the AJAX-call listed above. function fillDropdwon(dropId){
   var service = new MyNameSpace.Service();
   service.GetDropDownData(dropId, onDone);
}
 I also tried to add the following in the web.config <system.webServer>
  <httpProtocol>
    <customHeaders>
      <!-- Enable Cross Domain AJAX calls -->
      <remove name="Access-Control-Allow-Origin" />
      <add name="Access-Control-Allow-Origin" value="https://gate.company.com"/>
    </customHeaders>
  </httpProtocol>
</system.webServer>
 I checked the headers sent to the server and saw that when I am NOT logged in, the header looks like this: Request URL:`https://gate.company.com/MyPage/Servic.svc/GetDropDownData?callback=onDone`

 The main difference is that there is a SessionID and the jsonerror:true for the version "logged in". It there a way to fix this problem? Is it not possible to "disable" the authentication for the AJAX request by changing the header before the call or something like that. Or is there any error in my code, web.config? I appreciate any hint, since I am trying around for a long time.

@TITLE:Non-capturing wildcards in Play Framework routes
@CONTENT:I'm exposing an HTTP API through Play, and in order to manage compatibility-breaking changes, the URL contains the version number. At present this looks like the following: GET   /api/v1/someMethod       com.foo.Api.someMethod()
 As I introduce a change to the output of one of the methods, I'd like to support v2. For most of the methods though, the behaviour is identical, so I don't care which version is used. I tried to modify the above line to: GET   /api/v:version/someMethod       com.foo.Api.someMethod()
 But Play fails to compile this, with the error Missing parameter in call definition: version. I know I didn't use the version parameter in the call - because I didn't need to! Is there a sensible way to achieve what I'm after here, either to get Play to skip this check, or to put a wildcard in the route that is not captured as a parameter? (I suppose if not I could add the parameter to the method definition, and then ignore it. But I'd rather avoid that if possible.)

@TITLE:postgres collation differences. osx v ubuntu
@CONTENT:So, i've recently come to realize that collation is a huge deal on postgres, and that many comments refer to OSX / locale support as "broken", which hasn't enlightened me. for the purposes of this question, i'm ignoring the table/column default aspects of collation, and specifying it explicitly. my laptop is osx with postgres 9.2.4 my server is ubuntu with postgres 9.1.9 common to both:   # show lc_collate ;
   en_US.UTF-8
  # show lc_ctype ;
   en_US.UTF-8
 on my laptop: select ',' < '-' collate "en_US.UTF-8" as result;
  true
 now, my server does not have collation "en_US.UTF-8", but it does have "en_US.utf8" (which i recognize is not the same thing, though i would expect it to behave the same) select ',' < '-' collate "en_US.utf8" as result;
 false
 so, here's where i'm freaking out. "C" order would always say (for both machines) that ',' is less than '-', which my brain would agree with. which utf8 implementation is correct? and if someone could point me at the definition that would help, as mostly i've only been able to find accusations of "broken" leveled at osx. So i'd be worried that i've been wrong my entire life thinking that comma orders before hyphen, but enter a reasonably reliant arbiter of text and unicode etc. python. which on the ubuntu server yields: >>> print u',' < u'-', ',' < '-'
True True
 So, I'm feeling a lot like this collation concept is more broken on my ubuntu server than my osx server. but i don't have a "proper" collation to create my "en_US.UTF-8" collation from ala "create collation", so i'm lost as to how to create parity, or which answer (true/false) i should be using as the correct reference. (besides personally siding with ascii order for what are, after all, ascii characters). so, in a nutshell, which is the proper answer for en_US.UTF-8 ?
@CODE:# show lc_collate ;
   en_US.UTF-8
  # show lc_ctype ;
   en_US.UTF-8 select ',' < '-' collate "en_US.UTF-8" as result;
  true select ',' < '-' collate "en_US.utf8" as result;
 false >>> print u',' < u'-', ',' < '-'
True True

@TITLE:Memory overhead for structs with pointers in C [duplicate]
@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: Memory alignment in C-structs 10 answers I realized there's a memory overhead in my structs when they contain a pointer. Here you have an example: typedef struct {
    int num1;
    int num2;

typedef struct {
    int *p;
    int num2;
} myStruct2;

int main()

        sizeof(int*), sizeof(myStruct1), sizeof(myStruct2));
    return 0;
}
 This prints the following in my 64-bit machine: Sizes: int: 4, int*: 8, myStruct1: 8, myStruct2: 16
 Everything makes sense to me except the size of myStruct2, which I thought it would only be 12 instead of 16 (sizeof(int*) + sizeof(int) = 12). Could anyone explain me why this is happening? Thank you! (I'm pretty sure this must have been asked somewhere else, but I couldn't find it.)

EEG = fromfile(fneeg, int16)
 Here's where things get confusing to me. According to the documentation, matlab's fread is a method of reading binary files via fread(loaded_file, size, data_type). The alternative in python is using numpy's fromfile and reshaping (according to this thread here: MATLAB to Python fread) using the built in reshape function. I'm not sure how this works, or even relates to the matlab method? I'm sorry if my question is confusing, matlab is still very new to me Edit: If you wanna look have a look at the file here it is: https://www.dropbox.com/s/zzm6uvjfm9gpamk/data.eeg Edit2: The answers to the raw inputs are t=10, ch=32.

@CONTENT:My app is having issues with the MediaPlayer streaming, specifically on Nexus 5. I'm not sure if this is Nexus 5 or API level 19 causing the problem. Basically my MediaPlayer gets prepared and I call MediaPlayer.start(), but the MediaPlayer doesn't begin streaming. This happens at random and only on my Nexus 5 device. When this happens, if I try seeking the MediaPlayer it begins to play. Is anyone else experiencing this?

I need to find a way to test every possible two-set partition of this list for something, and to do that, I need to break the list into every possible two-set combination.

 It is working fine in production. Now for another project we are migrating to Hibernate4. we copied over the same configuration except using Hierrnate 4's SessionFactory,TransacionManager etc. from org.springframework.orm.hibernate4.* package. However it started giving exception saying "Save is not valid without active transaction". After searching a bit many people seemed to have faced the problems and several people suggested not to use         <prop key="hibernate.current_session_context_class ">thread</prop>
 property and it worked. It also worked for me. All little information I could gather from the posts that it has something to do with contextual sessions and thread strategy interfering with Spring's session management strategy. But no where I could find any concrete answer. Also, why did it work with Hibernate3 and not with Hibernate4. What is the difference and what has changed? Every other configuration is same. I am not using @Transactional but the old school XML way.     Can somebody point me to clear explaination for this behavioural difference in Hibernate3 and Hibernate4?

@CONTENT:I'm trying to add the current user to a group in the system, then execute a command that requires permission for that group. My playbook is like so: - name: Add this user to RVM group
  sudo: true

- name: Install Ruby 1.9.3
  command: rvm install ruby-1.9.3-p448 creates=/usr/local/rvm/bin/ruby-1.9.3-p448
 The problem is that all of this is happening in the same shell. vagrant's shell hasn't been updated with the new groups yet. Is there a clean way to refresh the user's current groups in Ansible? I figure I need to get it to re-connect or open a new shell. However I tried opening a new shell and it simply hangs: - name: Open a new shell for the new groups
  shell: bash
 Of course it hangs: the process never exits! Same thing with newgrp - name: Refresh the groups
  shell: newgrp
 Because it basically does the same thing. Any ideas?

@TITLE:Why does having a base class disqualify a class from being aggregate?
@CONTENT:What is it about having an aggregate public base class (or even multiple aggregate public base classes) that would make a class lose the nice properties of aggregate classes? Definition of "aggregate base class" from http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/aggregate_initialization http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C++_classes#Aggregate_classes The nice properties of aggregate classes: Without defining a constructor, an aggregate type can be initialized by passing in a brace-enclosed list of values to initialize its members (or base classes, if they had allowed them). Aggregate types are considered "simple" (a generalization of PODs), and can be used as a literal type for the purposes of constexprs. Abridged example of initialization from http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/aggregate_initialization#Example: #include <string>
#include <array>
struct S {
  int x;
  struct Foo {

    int j;
    int a[3];
  } b;

 And I want to represent it in HTML5. The tricky thing is that tables like this must be semantically important, but the top-left cell is not semantically important, but instead a spacer to line up the more important column headers. What's the best way to do this? My first idea is to do it like this: <table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th></th>
            <th>Col1</th>
            <th>Col2</th>

            <td>D3.2</td>
            <td>D3.3</td>

    </tbody>
</table>

@CONTENT:I want to make an entire page of my documentation 'Internal' so that it is only generated when INTERNAL_DOCS = YES. I'm using markdown format for the bulk text of this document, so all these files are .md extension, not that that should make a difference. If I apply this within an @page part of a source text file the following works as expected, in that all evidence of the page disappears from the output: @internal
@page hidden_page Blah Blah
Text is here.    
@endinternal
 However, some of my pages are quite long and I've factored them out to a separate file. # Page Title

Extensive text here.
 The first-line markdown title stops Doxygen using the filename for the title of the page. The problem is, if I do this... @internal
# Page Title

Extensive text here.
@endinternal
 The text body is duly hidden, but the (blank) page still exists in the output, showing the filename as the page title. Reversing the order of the top lines makes no real difference - it just means the blank page is titled differently. I can't find anything in the relevant parts of the Doxygen manual. I'm using 1.8.5. One, undesirable, solution is to 'unfactor' the separated page(s) back into a page that is always visible and use the technique described at the top. However, there are quite a number of such pages. Does anyone know how whole files can be made completely internal, or have any other approaches that may work for this?

What does that do to the accessibility of that inner class? 3) What is best practices in dealing with access levels when it comes to your Inner Classes?

@TITLE:OptionsMenu of Nested Fragments within ViewPager
@CONTENT:I am using ActionBarSherlock and I am trying to implement a nested fragment structure with a viewpager. I have an activity which contains some views and a wrapper fragmet (FragmentA) This FragmentA contains a view pager which shows FragmentA.1, FragmentA.2 ,FragmentA.3. By Default, onCreateOptionsMenu events are not dispatched to child fragments as it is discussed here. So I am using this solution to overcome the issue. It works great over API level 17, but for below it does not show the optionsmenu for the first fragment but when i scroll to others everything starts to work just fine. I have tried calling onCreateOptionsMenu from parent fragment but no result. It also works when i scroll back to first fragment. Any suggestions? Update : More clear way of expressing the structure : By wrapper fragment, i meant the fragment which holds the viewpager. So the structure is ACTIVITY 
        -> WRAPPER FRAGMENT (holds viewpager and passes childfragmentmanager to adapter(FragmentPagerAdapter) as fragmentmanager) (parent is activity)
             -> CHILDFRAGMENTS(items of viewpager) (parent is wrapper fragment but viewpager manages its framelayout)
 Also i have found a temp solution which is not so nice : if(Build.VERSION.SDK_INT > 17){

            pager.setCurrentItem(1,false);

        } else {

            new android.os.Handler().postDelayed(new Runnable() {

 With std::tie it works, but assigning directly to the tuple of references doesn't compile, giving "error: conversion from ¡¥std::tuple<int, float>¡¦ to non-scalar type ¡¥std::tuple<int&, float&>¡¦ requested" or "no suitable user-defined conversion from std::tuple<int, float> to std::tuple<int&, float&>" Why?

 Which evaluates as true. I also checked online to see if it maybe was the fault of msvc, but all compilers give the same result.

@TITLE:Opposite of HEX() in SQLite?
@CONTENT:I have this simple query that returns a bunch of guids as hexadecimal strings: SELECT HEX(guid) FROM table;
 One of them is for instance 43F4124307108902B7A919F4D4D0770D. Then imagine I want to get the record with this guid, so I write a query like this: SELECT * FROM table WHERE guid = '43F4124307108902B7A919F4D4D0770D';
 Of course, this will not work, since the string is directly interpreted as a blob and not converted to it's hex value. I looked here, but couldn't find anything that looks like a method that takes a hexadecimal string and converts it to a blob.

@LINK:/questions/19779687/dynamically-loading-angularjs-modules-from-within-templates-views
@TITLE:Dynamically loading AngularJS modules from within Templates (Views)
@CONTENT:Background: Let's suppose for the sake of argument that you have 100,000 views (partials). Let's also suppose you have accompanying view-scoped controllers, and potentially view-scoped services and filters as well. Try to envision an aggregating application that hosts 100,000 disparate small applications. Issue: When you have "partials" that require accompanying controllers, the typical solution is to do something like this: $routeProvider.when('/app1', {
        templateUrl: 'partials/view1.html',
        controller: 'controller1'
    });
 The controller is typically loaded from index.html via: <script src="js/directives/Controller1.js"></script>
 The problem with this approach is that it doesn't scale. There are solutions out there for dynamically loading controllers, but they still require adding touch points in various config. Ideal Solution: Ideally - again for very small applications whose numbers are in the 000's, the controller could be loaded dynamically, and from within the partial itself. This would alleviate the need to manage several files and several configuration touch points (not to mention network requests), and keep each partial very well contained. It would look something like this: In router: $routeProvider.when('/apps/:appId', {
        templateUrl: 'partials/app-frame.html',
        controller: 'AppCtrl'
    });
 In containing html (app-frame) include the relatively disparate "mini app": <h1>Currently hosting {{appId}}</h1><hr>
<div class="ng-include: appUrl"></div>
 In partial resolved with appUrl, define controller and markup in one: <script>
  myApp.controller('controller1', ['$scope', function ($scope) {
    $scope.foo = "bar";
  }]);
</script>


<div ng-controller="controller1">
     {{foo}}
</div>
 For cases like this, where there are a lot of partials and a 1-1 mapping for controller and view, it can make sense to couple the two for development efficiencies and maintenance. It's a lot cleaner than using several files and additional configuration touch points. The problem is, this doesn't work. It could be as simple as forcing the script to load prior to applying the directive... but not sure how to do that? Here are some similar explanations of the problem: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/angular/H4haaMePJU0 Loading Partial Page With Angular and Compile The Controller Igor from the AngularJS team says: I see.. we looked into supporting script tags in jqlite, but what needs to be done to get a cross-browser support involves a lot of black magic. For this reason we decided that for now we are just going to recommend that users use jquery along with angular in this particular case. It doesn't make sense for us to rewrite one third of jquery to get this working in jqlite.
 But I don't know what he means by "use jquery" ... JQuery is already loaded into the application from index.html (and prior to angularjs), but it sounds like I need to do something specifically within the partial itself.
@CODE:$routeProvider.when('/app1', {
        templateUrl: 'partials/view1.html',

 The full file has three more Object nodes similar to this. Two of those nodes have the value "False" in the "IsCoreGroup" attribute and the other two are "True". What I am trying to do is get the value of the "Name" property and other attributes from the Object nodes that have the value of "False" in the "IsCoreGroup" attribute. I have tried a number of ways to get this attribute but can't figure out how to drill down into the sibling attributes. Here's what I have so far: [xml]$file = get-content C:\Admin\ClusterGroups.xml
$xmlProperties = $file.SelectNodes("/Objects/Object/Property")
Foreach ($xmlProperty in $xmlProperties) {
    $strName = ($xmlProperty | Where-Object {$_.Name -eq "IsCoreGroup" }).InnerXml
    If ($strName -eq "False")
    {
    Echo $xmlProperty
    }
}
 This gives me the following: Name                                      #text

IsCoreGroup                               False      
 But I can't figure out how to get the sibling properties I tried backing up a level with: [xml]$file = get-content C:\Admin\ClusterGroups.xml
$xmlObjects = $file.SelectNodes("/Objects/Object")
Foreach ($xmlObject in $xmlObjects) {

@TITLE:Hotmail adding p tags within email, creating unwanted spacing
@CONTENT:I've created an email signature, using tables for layout as I've read this is the best approach. Everything looks great for internal emails sent via Outlook 2013 but annoyingly when viewing an email in Hotmail, a bunch of spacing has been injected per <tr>. Viewing the source reveals that the content within the <tr> is being wrapped in a <p> with a .ecxMsoNormal class specified. The p tag is being set a bottom-margin of 1.35em, hence the spacing issue. I've tried to override the class but it looks like <style> tags are being stripped before Outlook 2013 sends the email or it's completely getting ignored server side. Is there a way to remove this spacing? If not, what would be a suitable work around? Nothing I try (table layout, div layout, wrapping inner content in font/div tags, overriding styles) seems to get rids of these p tags. Edit: See image for more details.

@TITLE:Matplotlib slow with large data sets, how to enable decimation?
@CONTENT:I use matplotlib for a signal processing application and I noticed that it chokes on large data sets. This is something that I really need to improve to make it a usable application. What I'm looking for is a way to let matplotlib decimate my data. Is there a setting, property or other simple way to enable that? Any suggestion of how to implement this are welcome. Some code: import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

n=100000 # more then 100000 points makes it unusable slow
plt.plot(np.random.random_sample(n))
plt.show()
 Some background information I used to work on a large C++ application where we needed to plot large datasets and to solve this problem we used to take advantage of the structure of the data as follows: In most cases, if we want a line plot then the data is ordered and often even equidistantial. If it is equidistantial, then you can calculate the start and end index in the data array directly from the zoom rectangle and the inverse axis transformation. If it is ordered but not equidistantial a binary search can be used. Next the zoomed slice is decimated, and because the data is ordered we can simply iterate a block of points that fall inside one pixel. And for each block the mean, maximum and minimum is calculated. Instead of one pixel, we then draw a bar in the plot. For example: if the x axis is ordered, a vertical line will be drawn for each block, possibly the mean with a different color. To avoid aliasing the plot is oversampled with a factor of two. In case it is a scatter plot, the data can be made ordered by sorting, because the sequence of plotting is not important. The nice thing of this simple recipe is that the more you zoom in the faster it becomes. In my experience, as long as the data fits in memory the plots stays very responsive. For instance, 20 plots of timehistory data with 10 million points should be no problem.

@TITLE:Visual Studio 2013 feature Code Lens with NUnit
@CONTENT:In the new Visual Studio 2013 there is a nice new feature called Code Lens (I think that it is only in the Ultimate version). Regarding methods, besides it shows references (how many and where) it also shows some information about versioning when working in team and tests statistics so that you know how many tests using the method are passing and how many failing. I assume that this works perfectly with test projects embedded in Visual Studio, but does it work with NUnit? We are using NUnit for unit testing and we are trying to decide whether or not to move to VS2013 and one of reasons would be this new feature that we would sure like to use to its full extent if it support NUnit. Do you have any experience with it?

@LINK:/questions/19714985/is-returning-self-retain-in-copywithzone-for-immutable-classes-with-mutable-su
@TITLE:Is returning [self retain] in copyWithZone for immutable classes with mutable subclasses really safe / a good idea?
@CONTENT:One often reads, that immutable classes can implement copyWithZone very efficiently in the following way: - (id) copyWithZone:(NSZone*)zone
{
    return [self retain];
}
 The idea behind that implementation is obvious: The original and the copy are both immutable instances and they will always have exactly the same content, so why not let both point to the same storage by retaining the original and avoid the overhead of copying. However, what will happen if there is a mutable subclass? With a clean architecture, where a subclass does not have to care about implementation details of its base class, the mutable subclass should be fine to implement copyWithZone in this way: - (id) copyWithZone:(NSZone*)zone
{
    MyClass* myCopy = [super copyWithZone:zone];
    myCopy->myMember = [myMember copyWithZone:zone];
    return myCopy;
}
 But what does this mean with the above superclass implementation of copyWithZone? The subclass is mutable, so although the copy still is immutable, the original now is mutable, but the subclass copyWithZone thanks to the superclass implementation operates on a retained instance of itself: self and myCopy both point the the same instance, so if I later change the value of mutableOriginal.myMember, then that will also change immutableCopy.myMember, which is just plain wrong. So shouldn't immutable classes better implement copyWithZone in the following way? - (id) copyWithZone:(NSZone*)zone
{
    if([[self class] isMemberOfClass:[MyBaseClass class]])
        return [self retain];
    else
    {
        MyBaseClass* myCopy = [[self alloc] init];
        myCopy->myBaseMember = [myBaseMember copyWithZone:zone];
        return myCopy;
    }
}
@CODE:- (id) copyWithZone:(NSZone*)zone
{
    return [self retain];
} - (id) copyWithZone:(NSZone*)zone
{
    MyClass* myCopy = [super copyWithZone:zone];
    myCopy->myMember = [myMember copyWithZone:zone];
    return myCopy;
} - (id) copyWithZone:(NSZone*)zone
{
    if([[self class] isMemberOfClass:[MyBaseClass class]])
        return [self retain];
    else
    {
        MyBaseClass* myCopy = [[self alloc] init];
        myCopy->myBaseMember = [myBaseMember copyWithZone:zone];
        return myCopy;
    }
} copy [super copy]

@TITLE:SKProductsRequest crashing app at startup with iOS 7.0.3
@CONTENT:Reports of our app crashing started flooding in last night. Many users who upgraded to 7.0.3 had the app crash at startup. Analyzing the itunes crash logs it was due to the app getting killed for taking too long to startup. Apparently the call to check for available in-app purchases is what was causing the crash. We removed all in-app purchases from sale and now users are reporting that the app is now working. - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions { 

// earlier stuff...
    [self requestProductData]; // ask for in-app purchase localized prices/names
    [[SKPaymentQueue defaultQueue] addTransactionObserver:self]; // process any   pending transactions

// more stuff...
}

    }


    SKProductsRequest *request= [[SKProductsRequest alloc] initWithProductIdentifiers:prodSet];
    request.delegate = self;
    [request start];
}
 In didFinishLaunchingWithOptions, we make the call to request product data. Do we need to be doing this in another thread? Anyone else having this issue?

@LINK:/questions/19707578/how-to-call-a-function-whenever-a-key-is-pressed-in-python
@TITLE:How to call a function whenever a key is pressed in python
@CONTENT:I have a program that is running a loop. Whenever I press, for example, the key "ESC" on keyboard, it should call out a function which prints "You pressed the key ESC" and maybe executes some commands too. I tried this: from msvcrt import getch

while True:
    key = ord(getch())
    if key == 27: #ESC
        print("You pressed ESC")
    elif key == 13: #Enter
        print("You pressed key ENTER")
        functionThatTerminatesTheLoop()
 After all my tries, msvcrt doesnt seem to work in python 3.3 or for whatever other reason. Basically, how do I make my program react to any keypress at any point of the time while the program is running? EDIT: Also, I found this: import sys

while True:
    char = sys.stdin.read(1)
    print ("You pressed: "+char)
    char = sys.stdin.read(1)
 But it requires enter to be entered into the command console for the input to be reistered, but I have my loop running in a tkinter, so I still need a way for it to do something immediately after the keypress is detected.
@CODE:from msvcrt import getch

while True:
    key = ord(getch())
    if key == 27: #ESC
        print("You pressed ESC")
    elif key == 13: #Enter
        print("You pressed key ENTER")
        functionThatTerminatesTheLoop() import sys

while True:
    char = sys.stdin.read(1)

@TITLE:Is there documentation on when Dagger falls back to reflection when injecting dependencies?
@CONTENT:My team has adopted Dagger for dependency injection within our Android app and I must say that we love it so far. However, we want to make sure that we are using it efficiently. I was wondering if anyone can explain or if there is any documentation explaining the cases in which Dagger falls back to reflection for injecting dependencies?

@TITLE:How do I detect the Ubuntu version?
@CONTENT:I'm currently writing a Python app that changes some network configuration files. The app needs to run on Ubuntu 10.04 to 13.10. The problem is, that NetworkManager is broken in different ways on different versions (though they seem to have finally fixed it in 13.04+), and this causes incompatibilities with my app. I've figured out the problems on each version and developed workarounds for them, I'm just not sure what the best way is to detect which version of Ubuntu the user is running. The best solution I've come up with so far is to parse the output of lsb_release -a, but this seems to be a rather fragile solution and would probably fail with Ubuntu-derived distributions such as Mint and possibly even with some of the "official" variants (Kubuntu, Xubuntu, etc.). Is there a good way to detect the base distribution and version for a given Linux distribution so I can base the choices my app makes on that version?

@TITLE:How to read length of video recorded with MediaRecorder into private app storage directory constructed via context.getFilesDir()?
@CONTENT:I am having a weird issue reading the length/duration of a video file recorded with a device's camera by using MediaRecorder. The file is recorded into the application's private storage directory, which is set like so: mMediaRecorder.setOutputFile(context.getFilesDir() + "/recordings/webcam.3gpp");
 After recording is complete, I attempt to read the length of the video with these methods: Method 1: MediaMetadataRetriever mediaMetadataRetriever = new MediaMetadataRetriever();
mediaMetadataRetriever.setDataSource(context.getFilesDir() + "/recordings/webcam.3gpp");
String time = mediaMetadataRetriever.extractMetadata(MediaMetadataRetriever.METADATA_KEY_DURATION);
return Long.parseLong(time);
 Method 2: MediaPlayer mp = MediaPlayer.create(context, Uri.parse(context.getFilesDir() + "/recordings/webcam.3gpp"));
long duration = mp.getDuration();
mp.release();
return duration;
 None of the methods work. mediaMetadataRetriever.extractMetadata returns null and MediaPlayer.create fails with an IOException. I have verified that the file exists. Important note: This issue DOES NOT happen if I save the recording to "/sdcard/recordings/webcam.3gpp". For some reason, I just cannot read the duration when the file is in the private files directory that belongs to the application. Also, this issue ONLY happens on my Samsung Droid Charge, which runs Android 2.3. It DOES NOT happen on a Samsung Galaxy S4, which runs Android 4.2, and Asus Nexus 7, which runs Android 4.3. Edit: If I take the same file and copy it to the sdcard, then read the length of it there, everything works. What gives? copy(new File(context.getFilesDir() + "/recordings/webcam.3gpp"), new File("/sdcard/wtfisthiscrap.3gpp"));
MediaMetadataRetriever mediaMetadataRetriever = new MediaMetadataRetriever();
mediaMetadataRetriever.setDataSource("/sdcard/wtfisthiscrap.3gpp");
String time = mediaMetadataRetriever.extractMetadata(MediaMetadataRetriever.METADATA_KEY_DURATION);
return Long.parseLong(time); // works!
 What can I do to solve this issue?
@CODE:mMediaRecorder.setOutputFile(context.getFilesDir() + "/recordings/webcam.3gpp"); MediaMetadataRetriever mediaMetadataRetriever = new MediaMetadataRetriever();
mediaMetadataRetriever.setDataSource(context.getFilesDir() + "/recordings/webcam.3gpp");
String time = mediaMetadataRetriever.extractMetadata(MediaMetadataRetriever.METADATA_KEY_DURATION);
return Long.parseLong(time); MediaPlayer mp = MediaPlayer.create(context, Uri.parse(context.getFilesDir() + "/recordings/webcam.3gpp"));
long duration = mp.getDuration();
mp.release();
return duration; mediaMetadataRetriever.extractMetadata MediaPlayer.create copy(new File(context.getFilesDir() + "/recordings/webcam.3gpp"), new File("/sdcard/wtfisthiscrap.3gpp"));
MediaMetadataRetriever mediaMetadataRetriever = new MediaMetadataRetriever();
mediaMetadataRetriever.setDataSource("/sdcard/wtfisthiscrap.3gpp");

Foo.prototype is an object instance --> Foo {} And who is the constructor function of Foo{} ? it is the the function Foo(){} you can see it here in yellow : ok But I was told here that : So Foo.prototype.__proto__ should reference to the prototype of function Foo(){} and not to Object.prototype !

@TITLE:Redundant cast of uint8 doesn't work with GCC 4.8.1
@CONTENT:I have some legacy code which was usually compiled for PowerPC with GCC 3.4.4 . Now I am porting some code parts which I want to compile with the GCC 4.8.1 from MinGW. At some point in the code I found this: // Prototypes
void foo(uint8* pData);
uint8 bar();

// Function
void foo(uint8* pData)
{
    (uint8) *(pData++) = bar(); // Original Code - Doesn't work with GCC 4.8.1
    *(pData++) = bar();         // Works with GCC 4.8.1
}
 If I want to compile the line from the original code with the GCC 4.8.1 I get the lvalue required as left operand of assignment error. If I get rid of the cast operator it works fine. Can someone explain why this is? Isn't that cast just redundant and shouldn't matter anyway? And why is it working with the GCC 3.4.4 ?

@LINK:/questions/19673614/memory-consumption-when-using-delphi7-com-interfaces-in-a-multithreaded-way
@TITLE:Memory consumption when using Delphi7 COM interfaces in a multithreaded way
@CONTENT:It seems that there is some memory problem in Delphi7 when accessing COM object interfaces such as IXMLDocument and IXMLNode - and so forth - in a multithreaded way. Other COM interfaces may share this problem, but my "research" isn't that deep cause I have to proceed my current project as well. Creating TXMLDocument and manipulating it via interfaces like IXMLDocument and IXMLNode on a single thread is ok, but in a multithreading approach, when one thread creates the TXMLDocument object and the others manipulates it uses more and more memory. CoInitializeEx(nil, COINIT_MULTITHREADED) is called in every thread but in vain. It seems that every thread allocates some memory when getting an interface and does not free it, but every thread allocates it once - at least for a certain interface - e.g. the DocumentElement or ChildNodes - so one working thread beside the one that created the object - does not cause visible memory leak. But dynamically created threads are all behave the same way and eventually consume up process memory. Here is my full test application Delphi7 form as SCCE which try to show three different scenario mentioned above - single thread, one working thread and dynamically created threads. unit uComTest;

@TITLE:Why is SQLite refusing to use available indexes when adding a JOIN?
@CONTENT:This is related to Why is SQLite refusing to use available indexes? The queries to create the database is: CREATE TABLE foo(id TEXT);
CREATE INDEX `foo.index` ON foo(id);
CREATE TABLE bar(id TEXT);
CREATE INDEX `bar.index` ON bar(id);
CREATE VIEW baz AS SELECT id FROM foo UNION ALL SELECT id FROM bar;
CREATE TABLE bam(id TEXT, value TEXT);

INSERT INTO foo VALUES('123');
INSERT INTO foo VALUES('1123');
INSERT INTO foo VALUES('2123');
INSERT INTO foo VALUES('3123');

INSERT INTO bar VALUES('44123');
INSERT INTO bar VALUES('441123');
INSERT INTO bar VALUES('442123');
INSERT INTO bar VALUES('443123');
 The result of EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT * FROM baz LEFT JOIN bam ON baz.id=bam.id WHERE baz.id IN ('123', '234'); is: SCAN TABLE foo (~1000000 rows)
SCAN TABLE bar (~1000000 rows)
COMPOUND SUBQUERIES 2 AND 3 (UNION ALL)
SCAN SUBQUERY 1 (~2000000 rows)
EXECUTE LIST SUBQUERY 4
SEARCH TABLE bam USING AUTOMATIC COVERING INDEX (id=?) (~7 rows)
 EDIT: Interestingly enough if I do EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM baz WHERE baz.id IN ('123', '234')) AS t LEFT JOIN bam ON t.id=bam.id ; it still doesnt use the index but if i do EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT * FROM baz WHERE baz.id IN ('123', '234'); it does. What is going on? Why isnt it using the indexes on foo and bar?? It does use the indexes without the JOIN section as apparent in the linked question. SQL Fiddle: http://sqlfiddle.com/#!7/32af2/14 (use WebSQL)
@CODE:EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT * FROM baz LEFT JOIN bam ON baz.id=bam.id WHERE baz.id IN ('123', '234'); EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM baz WHERE baz.id IN ('123', '234')) AS t LEFT JOIN bam ON t.id=bam.id ; EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT * FROM baz WHERE baz.id IN ('123', '234');

@TITLE:What are the weight values to use in numpy polyfit and what is the error of the fit
@CONTENT:I'm trying to do a linear fit to some data in numpy. Ex (where w is the number of samples I have for that value, i.e. for the point (x=0, y=0) I only have 1 measurement and the value of that measurement is 2.2, but for the point (1,1) I have 2 measurements with a value of 3.5. x = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3])
y = np.array([2.2, 3.5, 4.6, 5.2])
w = np.array([1, 2, 2, 1])

z = np.polyfit(x, y, 1, w = w)
 So, now the question is: is it correct to use w=w in polyfit for these cases or should I use w = sqrt(w) of what should I use? Also, how can I get the fit error from polyfit?
@CODE:(x=0, y=0) 2.2 (1,1) 3.5 x = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3])
y = np.array([2.2, 3.5, 4.6, 5.2])
w = np.array([1, 2, 2, 1])

z = np.polyfit(x, y, 1, w = w) w=w w = sqrt(w)

 Final conclusion: The problem lay in the fact that the path to my db had a space in it; no combination of backslashing, double or single quotes, or both resolved the issue. Running the command from the same directory as my db file did the trick. The space issue may be due to my not understanding the right escape sequences to use in bash - I may have to double-escape the spaces if schemacrawler is spawning other processes using my name as part of the command line. However, the app did continue to ask for my password, but just pressing enter allowed it to continue successfully.

EDIT: Here's my ASPX markup for the entire UpdatePanel containing the button: <asp:UpdatePanel ID="updNoUsage" runat="server">
  <ContentTemplate>
    <asp:Button ID="btnNoUsageLookup" runat="server" Text="Get No Usage Lines Report"

        BorderWidth="1px" PageSize="25" OnPageIndexChanging="gv_PageIndexChanging"
        OnSorting="gv_Sorting" OnRowCreated="gvNoUsage_RowCreated">

 Here's the "btnExport_Click" C# function in the code behind: protected void btnExport_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
  //Get dataset and output filename
  DataTable dt = dtNoUsage;
  string exportFile = "No Usage Report.csv";

  //Now convert DataSet to a CSV file
  //  Clear the response so there is nothing coming back.
  Response.Clear();
  Response.ClearHeaders();

  //  Add an HTTP header for the content type to tell the browser that this is a file that is being passed back.
  Response.AddHeader("Content-Disposition", string.Format("attachment; filename={0}", exportFile));

  //  Tell the browser the correct file type (should cause the file to open with Microsoft Excel)
  Response.ContentType = "application/vnd.ms-excel";

  //  Get CSV file from DataTable
  string csvData = HelperFunctions.CreateCSVFile(dt);

  //  Write the response to the HTTP stream back to the client browser
  Response.Write(csvData);

  //  End the stream write and commit it
  Response.End();
}
 Here's the HelperFunctions.CreateCSVFile() method: public static string CreateCSVFile(DataTable dt)
{
  //  Build the file line by line from the DataSet
  StringBuilder sbFile = new StringBuilder();

  //  Add the header row
  for (int i = 0; i < dt.Columns.Count; i++)
  {
    sbFile.AppendFormat("{0}", EscapeCSVField(dt.Columns[i].ColumnName));
    if (i < dt.Columns.Count - 1)
    {
      sbFile.Append(",");
    }
  }
  //  Add a newline
  sbFile.AppendLine(String.Empty);
  //  Add the data rows
  for (int i = 1; i < dt.Rows.Count; i++)
  {
    for (int j = 0; j < dt.Columns.Count; j++)
    {
      sbFile.AppendFormat("{0}", EscapeCSVField(dt.Rows[i][j].ToString().Trim()));
      if (j < dt.Columns.Count - 1)
      {
        sbFile.Append(",");
      }
    }
    //  Add a newline
    sbFile.AppendLine(String.Empty);
  }
  return sbFile.ToString();
}
 Like I said, this same code is working perfectly in another project. Any ideas what might be happening? EDIT: I watched the response in Fiddler, and as far as I can tell, the correct response is coming back - the browsers (Chrome, IE, Firefox) are just not responding to the file that is sent. Here's what the response looks like: HTTP/1.1 200 OK

 Then there's a blank line and the file contents are dumped. The contents also look correct. I'm baffled.

@TITLE:Possible to populate $templateCache before defining routes?
@CONTENT:I don't wish to lazy load my route templates. Instead I want to load all my route templates into $templateCache ahead of any routes executing. This is what I am doing: angular.module('myApp', ['ngRoute']).config(['$routeProvider', '$locationProvider', function ($routeProvider, $locationProvider)
{
    $locationProvider.html5Mode(false);

    $routeProvider.when("/main", {templateUrl: "main", controller: "MainCtrl"})
                  .when("/login",{templateUrl: "login", controller: "LoginCtrl"});
}])
.run(['$location','$templateCache', function ($location, $templateCache)
{
   //...Save templates in $templateCache
   $location.path("/login");
}]);
 This works OK if you browse to / because it doesn't match any route. But if you browse or refresh on /#/login it seems the route service attempts to load the template before my run block gets to run and makes a request to the server for it. Is there anyway to ensure the code that populates the $templateCache will execute before the route service goes looking for the template?
@CODE:angular.module('myApp', ['ngRoute']).config(['$routeProvider', '$locationProvider', function ($routeProvider, $locationProvider)
{
    $locationProvider.html5Mode(false);

    $routeProvider.when("/main", {templateUrl: "main", controller: "MainCtrl"})
                  .when("/login",{templateUrl: "login", controller: "LoginCtrl"});
}])
.run(['$location','$templateCache', function ($location, $templateCache)
{
   //...Save templates in $templateCache
   $location.path("/login");
}]); / /#/login

@CONTENT:GHC warns that I don't have the function signatures at the top level. I don't get why I would need them. The problem with providing them is that they are quite sophisticated, like this one (autogenerated): applyValue :: forall t t1 t2 t3 t4.

                -> (t2 -> t3 -> t4 -> t1) -> t2 -> t3 -> t4 -> (t -> Bool) -> [t1]
 So why would I bother adding them? the function itself: applyValue getValueAt stitchAndMove at fabric mark matchAt =
   if matchAt (getValueAt at)
   then [stitchAndMove at fabric mark]
   else []

@TITLE:How to add namespace url to a django-rest-framework router viewset
@CONTENT:I would like to add a url namespace to my api router but when I do the router still looks for urls without a namespace: router = DefaultRouter()
router.register(r'users', UserViewSet)
router.register(r'events', EventViewSet)
router.register(r'comments', CommentViewSet)

urlpatterns = patterns('apiroot.views',
                       url(r'^', include(router.urls, namespace='api')),
                       )
 The browsable api looks for url names like 'user-list' and 'user-detail' still instead of 'api:user-list' which is what I would like to have happen. I'm assuming there is an easy fix for this (it seems like a pretty standard thing to want to do) but I can't find any solution in the django-rest-framework docs. If I'm missing something from the docs, please share a link or if I am approaching this wrong (i.e "why would you do that, it's bad practice" or whatever) please explain why or what the correct way to manage api urls would be. Thanks!

@TITLE:Trying to replace deprecated loadnibnamed:owner
@CONTENT:I'm trying to replace the deprecated [NSBundle loadNibNamed:@"Subscriptions" owner:self];
 with this instead (only thing I can find that's equivalent) [[NSBundle mainBundle] loadNibNamed:@"Subscriptions" owner:self topLevelObjects:nil];
 but the dialog pops up and disappears right away instead of staying open like it was doing with the deprecated call. This code is inside a viewcontroller like this. - (id)init{
    self = [super init];
    if (self) {
        //[NSBundle loadNibNamed:@"Subscriptions" owner:self];

        [[NSBundle mainBundle] loadNibNamed:@"Subscriptions" owner:self topLevelObjects:nil];
    }
    return self;
 } and I'm calling it from the appdelegate like this. SubscriptionsViewController *subscriptionsViewController = [[SubscriptionsViewController alloc] init];
[subscriptionsViewController.window makeKeyAndOrderFront:self];
 Is there anything I'm missing? It seems straight forward to me.
@CODE:[NSBundle loadNibNamed:@"Subscriptions" owner:self]; [[NSBundle mainBundle] loadNibNamed:@"Subscriptions" owner:self topLevelObjects:nil]; - (id)init{
    self = [super init];
    if (self) {

@TITLE:Jasper Reports w/ Maven - How do I specify Java version to compile with?
@CONTENT:Is there any way I can specify which version of Java to use when compiling my .jrxml files with Jasper Reports in Maven (using jasperreports-maven-plugin)? I saw this blog post saying claiming that Jasper uses the "default virtual machine set in your computer" and not "same version of the maven-compiler-plugin". If I cannot change or guarantee the JAVA_HOME environment variable, how can I get Jasper to compile with Java6? Here is a snippet from my pom.xml: <plugins>

 Looking on the Codehaus docs, there is a parameter you can use, but it doesn't say how to specify which Java version. Thanks!

@TITLE:How can I set the 'size' attribute for the element <input> using an attribute object?
@CONTENT:I am a jQuery beginner and have come across one of the methods to create a new element on the page. I am able to create the element fine. However, one of the attributes (size) defaults to 20 even though I clearly state that it should be bigger. Is this a jQuery bug, or am I missing something? The other attributes in the attribute object (type, autofocus) work fine. The code I am using is this: $('<input>', {
  'type' : 'text',
  'size' : 50,
  'autofocus' : 'true'
});
 I do not have any CSS file. When I use the attr() method, I am able to set the size. But I want to know that I am not the only one who is unable to set the size attribute for the element using an attribute object. I am using jQuery 1.9.1. Any answers will be appreciated.

@CONTENT:I have created a simple REST service with two resources. The first resource works great and just returns MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN. For the second resource I wanted to try mapping POJO to Java and followed this example: https://github.com/jersey/jersey/tree/2.3.1/examples/json-moxy/src/main/java/org/glassfish/jersey/examples/jsonmoxy with my testbean defined as: @XmlRootElement
public class Company {

    public String name;
    public String symbol;
    public String country;

    public Company(String name, String symbol,
            String country) {
        this.name = name;
        this.symbol = symbol;
        this.country = country;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public String getSymbol() {
        return symbol;
    }

    public String getCountry() {
        return country;
    }
}
 The resource is trivial as well: @Path("company/{name}")
public class CompanyResource {

    private Map<String, Company> companies;

    public CompanyResource() {
        companies = new LinkedHashMap<String, Company>();
        companies.put("Apple", new Company("Apple Inc.", "AAPL", "USA"));
        companies.put("Microsoft", new Company("Microsoft Corp.", "MSFT", "USA"));
        companies.put("Honda", new Company("Honda Motor Co Ltd", "HMC", "Japan"));
        companies.put("Random", new Company("Random Inc.", "RND", "Undefined"));

    }
}
 I have debugged a request and arrive at the return statement without problems. From here however, I think a JAXBException is thrown but I am unable to view the details, and nothing appears in any log anywhere. All that happens is that the browser display an "internal server error 500" message. Under monitoring configuration I have in desperation set everything to level HIGH. Still nothing appears anywhere. The only similar questions I found were jax-rs 2.0 and Glassfish 4 unable to @consume JSON into Pojo and JAX RS Jersey + JSON --> HTTP 500 Internal Server Error but they didn't seem entirely related. For client I am simply using Google Chrome with the "Advanced REST Client" app. Any help would be much appreciated.

@TITLE:When to use separate SQL database tables for two slightly different types of information?
@CONTENT:I need help with an SQL decision that has confused me for a while. I'm trying to make a short story website where users can write their own stories and can browse each other's, etc. I've also got a collection of classic short stories written by great writers from the past. I'm confused as to whether I should store both types of story in the same database table. I want to keep the two types of stories (classic authors/users) distinct to some degree, since you should be able to search the website and filter out user stories from the results. But I can't just have a single database row in the table to represent this, ie a boolean CLASSIC, since with classic short stores, several other of the rows would be different too - there is no user, the date would be YYYY (ie, 1869) instead of a full datetime when the user submitted it. Yet I can't quite justify putting them in separate tables either. When most of the attributes are the same, should I really have two different database tables for short stories? At the moment I am filling in NULL into the user row for classic short stories, and my filtered search has an option to search only through classics, which selects from the database where user is NULL. This seems to hit performance though, when you're searching through a huge database of potentially millions of user stories just to find a few thousand classic stories. Note that there are other tables too, like tags for the stories, linked to the short stories table. So I'm basically asking you SQL experts - is there enough justification for separating the two types of information into different tables? I'm currently using SQLite in development but will switch to MySQL or PostgreSQL later.

 My Question: Clearly the PhpBrowser is not obeying the redirect. Changing the redirect to a location header, allows the test to pass, but I don't want to (can't) change my application to fit the test suite. Is this a bug in Codeception? In PhpBrowser? (I'm not really clear on where one starts and the other begins, or if PhpBrowser is even a separate project.) Or maybe this is a functionality I shouldn't expect from a headless browser? I should disclose that this is my first time working with a test suite.

 I tried version 1.4.6 and 1.4.0, neither worked. Version 1.4.6 - Net20/HtmlAgilityPack.dll Version 1.4.0 - Net20/HtmlAgilityPack.dll This is the code,     HtmlWeb web = new HtmlWeb();
    HtmlDocument doc = web.Load(url);
    HtmlNode table = doc.GetElementbyId("tblThreads");
 This didn't work either,     HtmlWeb web = new HtmlWeb();
    HtmlDocument doc = new HtmlDocument { OptionUseIdAttribute = true };
    doc = web.Load(url);
    HtmlNode table = doc.GetElementbyId("tblThreads");
 How can I fix this issue? Thanks.

@TITLE:Document interaction controller with iOS 7 status bar?
@CONTENT:The UIDocumentInteractionController seems to have trouble interacting properly with the new iOS 7 status bar particularly in landscape orientation. The code I have for displaying the viewer right now: - (void)viewDidAppear:(BOOL)animated
{
    [super viewDidAppear:animated];

    NSString *filePath = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"example" ofType:@"pdf"];
    NSURL *url = [NSURL fileURLWithPath:filePath];

    UIDocumentInteractionController *pdfViewer = [UIDocumentInteractionController interactionControllerWithURL:url];
    [pdfViewer setDelegate:self];
    [pdfViewer presentPreviewAnimated:YES];
}

- (UIViewController *)documentInteractionControllerViewControllerForPreview:(UIDocumentInteractionController *)controller
{
    return self;
}

- (UIView *)documentInteractionControllerViewForPreview:(UIDocumentInteractionController *)controller
{
    return self.view;
}
 When the interaction controller first appears the status bar overlaps the title. Rotating to landscape on the other side fixes the behaviour temporarily. As expected tapping on the document itself allows dismisses the frame. However once the document is tapped once more to activate the frame the overlap occurs again as with the first image. I have tried setting documentInteractionControllerRectForPreview to no avail. - (CGRect)documentInteractionControllerRectForPreview:(UIDocumentInteractionController *)controller
{
    return CGRectMake(0, 20, self.view.bounds.size.width, self.view.bounds.size.height);
}
 I do not wish to hide the status bar when the interaction controller comes up and I assume it is possible to do this correctly since the Mail app behaves correctly and it looks like it is using the same class. A minimal example project attached for anyone who wants to play with the code: https://hostr.co/PiluL1VSToVt

@TITLE:Is it possible to change only the color of text shadow?
@CONTENT:I have 9 differently colored buttons (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, pink, off-white and slate) and I was wondering if it was possible to manipulate and alter only the color of the text-shadow CSS property for these buttons, while keeping the other values the same? For example, I have two different classes; one is for buttons with 11px font size and the other is for 14px font size (standard across my website): .button-11 {
    font-size: 0.8em;
    border-width: 0.09091em;
    border-style: solid;
    padding: 0 0.90909em;
    text-shadow: 0.09091em 0.09091em 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
    -webkit-box-shadow: 0 -0.09091em rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3) inset;
    -moz-box-shadow: 0 -0.09091em rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3) inset;
    box-shadow: 0 -0.09091em rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3) inset;
}

.button-14 {
    border-width: 0.07143em;
    border-style: solid;
    padding: 0 0.71429em;
    text-shadow: 0.07143em 0.07143em 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
    -webkit-box-shadow: 0 -0.07143em rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3) inset;
    -moz-box-shadow: 0 -0.07143em rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3) inset;
    box-shadow: 0 -0.07143em rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3) inset;
}
 For those unaware, I have two separate classes because each font size requires different values for the borders and text shadow, since I'm using the em measurement - 0.09em equates to 1px at font size 11px, and 0.07em equates to 1px at font size 14px. So, in order to cut down on the CSS file size, it would help greatly if I could simply change the color of the text-shadow CSS properties without having to include the other values. Does anyone know if this is possible? Thank you.

@TITLE:Is there a number ¡§value equals¡¨?
@CONTENT:By default, Java does Binary Numeric Promotion for primitives, but does not do the same thing for objects. Here's a quick test to demonstrate: public static void main(String... args) {
  if(100 == 100L) System.out.println("first trial happened");
  if(Integer.valueOf(100).equals(Long.valueOf(100))) {
    System.out.println("second trial was true");
  } else {
    System.out.println("second trial was false");
  }
  if(100D == 100L) System.out.println("third trial, fun with doubles");
}
 Output: first trial happened
second trial was false
third trial, fun with doubles
 This is obviously correct behavior - an Integer is not a Long. However, does there exist a "value equals" for Number subclasses that would return true the same way that 100 == 100L returns true? Or 100d == 100L? In other words, is there a method (that is not Object.equals) that will do the equivalent of the Binary Numeric Promotion behavior for objects?
@CODE:public static void main(String... args) {
  if(100 == 100L) System.out.println("first trial happened");
  if(Integer.valueOf(100).equals(Long.valueOf(100))) {
    System.out.println("second trial was true");
  } else {
    System.out.println("second trial was false");
  }
  if(100D == 100L) System.out.println("third trial, fun with doubles");
} first trial happened
second trial was false
third trial, fun with doubles Integer Long Number 100 == 100L 100d == 100L Object.equals 10*(0.1+0.2) == 3 org.hamcrest.number.IsCloseTo.closeTo() Number

@TITLE:Leaflet.js fitBounds with padding?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to set the fitBounds option in a leaflet map like this: var bounds = new L.LatLngBounds([[Math.max(lat, borneLat), Math.max(lng, borneLng)], [Math.min(lat, borneLat), Math.min(lng, borneLng)]]);
map.fitBounds(bounds, { padding: [20, 20] });
 However this doesn't seem to add any padding ? at least the map "zoom level" doesn't change, and it's always showing the two points in the edges (i.e. one is top far right and the other is bottom far left). For some marker sets, it works ok, the zoom is at a decent level away and you can see everything nicely. However when the items are quite close to each other, it seems it zooms in a bit too much unless I can fit it with some "padding." Also I'm unsure if the bounds would be correct like that? Should I use instead just: var bounds = [[Math.max(lat, borneLat), Math.max(lng, borneLng)], [Math.min(lat, borneLat), Math.min(lng, borneLng)]];
@CODE:var bounds = new L.LatLngBounds([[Math.max(lat, borneLat), Math.max(lng, borneLng)], [Math.min(lat, borneLat), Math.min(lng, borneLng)]]);

@TITLE:How to transparently stream a file to the browser?
@CONTENT:CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT: IE8, IIS 7, ColdFusion When issuing a GET request pointing to a media file such as .mp3, .mpeg, etc. from IE, the browser will launch the associated application (Window Media Player) and I guess that the way IIS serves the file allows the application to stream it. We would like to be able to have a full control over the streaming process of a file so that we can allow it at certain times and to certain users only. For that reason we cannot simply let IIS directly serve the file and we wanted to use ColdFusion to serve the file instead. We have tried a few different approaches, but in every case the browser is downloading the entire file content before launching the external application. That's what we want to avoid. Please note that we do not want an NTFS-permission based solution. The solution that looked the most promising was Using ColdFusion To Stream Files To The Client Without Loading The Entire File Into Memory but the only advantage that seemed to offer was that the file wouldn't be entirely loaded in memory when served to the browser, but the browser still waits until the end of the transfer and then opens up the file in Winwodw Media Player. Is there a way to use ColdFusion or Java to stream a file to the browser and having the browser delegate the handling to the associated application just like when we let IIS directly serve the file?

@TITLE:How to implement interactive transitions in a custom container view controller
@CONTENT:I implemented my own custom container view controller and I try to make it compatible with iOS 7 view controller transitions. I make my custom container view controller conform to UIViewControllerContextTransitioning and I send self when I call transitionDuration: and animateTransition:. It all works fine as long as I use only animated transitions. Now I want to make it work with interactive transitions, so I call the interaction controller's startInteractiveTransition: instead of the animation controller's animateTransition:, using self again as a parameter. However, if I use a UIPercentDrivenInteractiveTransition as the interaction controller, it then calls a _animator method on my context (which is the container view controller itself). Of course, I haven't implemented this method which is private and undocumented, so it crashes... Am I missing something in my implementation? Is UIPercentDrivenInteractiveTransition only compatible with Apple classes because it uses some implementation magic (as when it requires that everything should be in a UIView animation block)? The documentation and header files make it look like we can implement our own container view controllers and still use custom transitions, but is it really true or just wishful thinking because nobody would actually do that? If I can't use UIPercentDrivenInteractiveTransition, then where exactly should the interaction/animation logic be? In the UIViewControllerTransitionCoordinatorContext object? In the UIViewControllerInteractiveTransitioning object (most likely, this object is the driver...)? Or in the UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning object (this is probably where the real animation should happen, but would that mean calling animateTransition: several times during the interaction? Or adding new methods for each step of the interactive transition?) Edit: The documentation says: A percent-driven interactive transition object drives the custom animation between the disappearance of one view controller and the appearance of another. It relies on a transition animator delegate¡Xa custom object that adopts the UIViewControllerAnimatorTransitioning protocol¡Xto set up and perform the animations. There is no UIViewControllerAnimatorTransitioning protocol. Assuming it is a mistake, or a name change that happened during iOS 7 development and it is actually the UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning protocol, how do we link the interaction controller with the animation controller? I guess it's the responsibility of the view controller driving the transition but I don't see any API to make this link, so it would mean that UIPercentDrivenInteractiveTransition is indeed reserved for Apple classes?
@CODE:UIViewControllerContextTransitioning self transitionDuration: animateTransition: startInteractiveTransition: animateTransition: self UIPercentDrivenInteractiveTransition _animator UIPercentDrivenInteractiveTransition UIView UIPercentDrivenInteractiveTransition UIViewControllerTransitionCoordinatorContext UIViewControllerInteractiveTransitioning UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning animateTransition: UIViewControllerAnimatorTransitioning UIViewControllerAnimatorTransitioning UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning UIPercentDrivenInteractiveTransition

@CONTENT:I've stumbled upon a somewhat unusual issue with File.WriteAllLines. I have code that looks like this File.WriteAllLines(filename, data);
bool exists = File.Exists(filename);
 The problem is that sometimes file writing fails, but does not raise an exception, and the code thinks the file exists when it doesn't. The file is in a network location. The file name is Database.lock. Does a lock extension mean anything to the OS? Exists returns true, but the file is simply not there. No exception is raised. Calling Exists from a separate process returns false. Calling Process.Start(filename) results in an error (not a code exception, just the OS saying it can't find the file). The local machine is running Windows 7. The remote machine is running Windows XP. How can I debug what's going on here? Update Following David's advice, I watched the process using procmon.exe. This is the result: http://i.imgur.com/IBz6Ujt.png You'll notice there's a lot of things going on repetitively, which I don't fully understand, and at the end, the file is reported to have been written successfully. Solved Thanks to Patrick's suggestion, I discovered that due to a code path I hadn't taken into consideration, the file was getting immediately deleted in a different segment of code. Sorry for wasting everyone's time. I am relieved though that it's just me being thoughtless, instead of unforeseeable network issues.

A similar question was asked in Functions that look pure to callers but internally use mutation and the general consensus seemed to be that it was OK for pure functions to perform mutation, as long as the mutations were performed on local copies of variables (i.e. the effect of the mutation does not escape the function and have a non-local effects). The question arose when I translated the bubble sort in Shen (Local mutation, global mutation, mutable datastructures, Bubblesort in Qi), which does not mutate the list, to common lisp and compared to the bubblesort in Bubblesort in Common Lisp, which does mutate the list. The result was that I found that (in Common Lisp) the version which mutated the list was significantly faster, for very large lists, than the version which did not mutate the list.

@TITLE:Why won't my random path code work?
@CONTENT:I have some code for an XNA tower defense. I have it set so that the enemy (bug) goes on a random path down from a certain side of the grid until it hits the house(destination) or the row on the side of the house. I debugged this project and the bug gets drawn and starts moving in a diagonal (kind of) path. It's the same every time (it's not random). I don't no what I'm doing wrong. It also sometimes gives an OutOfMemory exception at the spot in the code where I specified it. I dunno if I explained it very well so feel free to ask questions. The grid is surrounded by a forest which is not part of the grid so that's what the forest means. public class Bug : Sprite

@TITLE:Why does `libpq` use polling rather than notification for data fetch?
@CONTENT:I am reading libpq reference. It has both of sync and async methods. Bu I discovered something strange. When I see PQsendQuery function, it seems to send a query and return immediately. And I expected a callback function to get notified, but there was no such thing and the manual says to poll for data availability. I don't understand why async method is written in polling way. Anyway, as libp is the official client implementation, I believe there should be a good reason for this design. What is that? Or am I missing correct callback stuffs mentioned somewhere else?

@TITLE:Algorithm to determine whether a given number N can become hypotenuse of right triangle with all 3 integral sides
@CONTENT:Suppose you are given hypotenuse of a right angled triangle,then how can you determine whether there are two integral smaller sides possible with the given hypotenuse. For example, you are given hypotenuse as 5.Then you have to determine whether you have smaller integral sides for the given right triangle.The answer will be yes because we can have smaller sides as 3 and 4,hence getting a 3-4-5 right triangle. Similarly,for hypotenuse as 7 we can have no such right triangle. In other words,we have to find whether a given number N can serve as hypotenuse for a right triangle with all 3 sides as integers. I went through entire article on Pythagorean triples but still no success.I am confused what conditions to check.Please help.
@CODE:yes

@TITLE:Odd behaviour of the by() function in R 3.0.0?
@CONTENT:I am trying to become familiar with the vast universe that constitutes R. There is an excellent function by() which seems to do just what I need, but it doesn't seem to like selection of multiple columns in a data frame. I used the standard iris dataset, and while it seems well-behaved with a single column selected, it doesn't seem to like the selection of multiple columns. The example is taken from a reference book, but of course there may be a typo. First version (this works) > by(iris[,2],Species,mean)
Species: setosa
[1] 3.428
------------------------------------------------------------ 
Species: versicolor
[1] 2.77
------------------------------------------------------------ 
Species: virginica

 Second version (this doesn't) > by(iris[,2:3],Species,mean)

Species: versicolor

@TITLE:chef ruby gem installer failing
@CONTENT:I am trying to setup cassandra on an CentOS VM via chef and it fails with the error below. I have tried clearing out bundle caches to no avail. The recipe works on another machine but a key difference is that I ran other recipes on that machine beforehand so I suspect I am missing a chef dependency (which is why I haven't tried just fixing the packages directly). I am also terribly new to ruby so sorry if this is an obvious question.

@TITLE:Can I ¡§stack¡¨ !important;?
@CONTENT:I googled a little bit and I couldn't find the answer. My question is: does stacking !important works in some way? Or can I achieve the same functionality in another way? I'm aware that it's not a good practice Example, say I have: .myOuterDiv
{
   margin-left: 5px !important; 
}

.myInnerDiv
{
   margin-left: 10px !important; 
}
 It's obvious that the content of the inner div will have a margin of 10px, but can I add another important such as .myOuterDiv
{
   margin-left: 5px !important !important; 
}
 I wanna do exactly that, override the inner important so I can have a margin-left of 10. Can I do it like this or in some other way?
@CODE:.myOuterDiv
{
   margin-left: 5px !important; 
}

.myInnerDiv
{
   margin-left: 10px !important; 
} .myOuterDiv
{
   margin-left: 5px !important !important; 
} .myOuterDiv .myInnerDiv

@TITLE:How to do Diffie Hellman Key Generation and retrieve raw key bytes in Java
@CONTENT:I am writing a test harness in java for an existing program. As part of this i need to generate a Diffie Hellman key pair and pass the public key to the other program in its raw (i.e unencoded bytes) form. I can successfully the key pair using the following code: KeyPairGenerator kpg = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance("DiffieHellman");
kpg.initialize(512);
KeyPair dkp = kpg.generateKeyPair();
 However, i cannot seem to retrieve the raw byte value of the keys :-( Calling dkp.getPublic().getEncoded() returns a byte array but its of the Key in an x509 encoded format. Three possible ways forward occur to me: Find some method of getting the key data out of the above in its raw form. Decode the x509 encoding of the key into its raw form Generate the keys in a different manner that allows access to the raw key But im not how to go about doing any of them (and which will turn out to be best)? Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated!
@CODE:KeyPairGenerator kpg = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance("DiffieHellman");

@TITLE:How to close SP.UI.ModalDialog from button click in sharepoint?
@CONTENT:I want to show Confirmation Dialog when user saves any document from EDITForm.aspx. So I have written following JavaScript code. function PreSaveAction() {

 var _html = document.createElement();
 _html.innerHTML = "  <input  type=\"button\"  value=\"Submit\"    onclick ='javascript:SubmitDlg();'  />  <input  type=\"button\"  value=\"Cancel\" onclick =\"javascript:CloseDlg();\"     /> </td>           </tr>   </tbody> </table>";


 var options = {
            title: "Confirm",
            width: 400,
            height: 200,
            showClose: false,
            allowMaximize: false,
            autoSize: false,
            html: _html           
        };
        SP.UI.ModalDialog.showModalDialog(options); 

}

function SubmitDlg() { 
   SP.UI.ModalDialog.commonModalDialogClose(SP.UI.DialogResult.OK);


}

function CloseDlg() {
     SP.UI.ModalDialog.commonModalDialogClose(SP.UI.DialogResult.Cancel);
}
 Now I have following queries. SubmitDlg and CloseDlg is not fired when clicking on Submit or Cancel. Is this right way to Submit form (SubmitDlg method ) and Cancel dialog (CloseDlg method) from modal dialog ? Also this modal dialog-box should be only appeared if no validation errors while saving record, means if any field-value is required and we have not put any value then it should display in-built red colored messages. Thanks

@TITLE:Subscribed Calendar name has the .ics URL when opened from a UIWebView
@CONTENT:My iPhone app (supporting iOS 6+) has a web view which lists events with a "Add To Calendar" button for each event. The "Add To Calendar" button is a hyperlink to an .ics file on the server. To make this work, I have modified IIS to use "text/calendar" as the MIME type for .ics files and used the following code in my UIWebView delegate's shouldStartLoadWithRequest: when the request URL contains the ".ics" path extension [[UIApplication sharedApplication] openURL:ics_url]; When tapping on the "Add To Calendar" button for an event, I get an alert "Subscribe to the calendar "http://blah.com/pathtoics/file.ics"" with 2 buttons Subscribe and Cancel. When I tap "Subscribe", I get another alert "The Calendar "http://blah.com/pathtoics/file.ics" has been added" with 2 buttons "View Events" and "Done". When I open the Calendar app by tapping on "View Events" button, I see the event gets added but the Subscribed Calendar name is the URL "http://blah.com/pathtoics/file.ics" Two Questions: Is there a way to modify the alert to say "Subscribe to the calendar event Team Event 1"" i.e., the event name/description instead of the server path to the ics file? If so, how do I do that? Is there a way to make the name of the Subscribed Calendar to be a description text that I use in the ics file instead of the path to the ics file? If so how?

@LINK:/questions/19299045/merging-multiple-arbitrarily-sorted-lists-into-one-list
@TITLE:Merging multiple, arbitrarily sorted lists into one list
@CONTENT:Given 3 lists which are arbitrarily sorted by the same but unknown sort order. Is there an algorithm that merges these lists into one which is then still sorted by the same order? Example: List1: a b c f h List2: b c e h List3: c d e f Assume these lists are sorted but the sort order used is not known. I want to combine these lists to a result that does not contain duplicates but still maintains the sort order: a b c d e f h As said above: It is known, that the given lists are sorted but it is not known by which order, but the requirement is that the merged list is still sorted by the same (unknown) order. In the example above, I know that the element "f" is positioned between "e" and "h" because from List1 I know that "c" < "f" < "h", from List2 I know that "c" < "e" < "h" and from List3 I know that "e" < "f" and "c" < "e" which combines to: "c" < "e" < "f" < "h" If the sort order cannot be determined by any of the given lists, it is permissible to just append the element to the end of the result list. Also, if the sort order of a sequence of elements cannot be determined it is permissible to insert them in any order into the list as long as they are in the right place (e.g. if I know that "b" and "c" must be inserted between "a" and "d" but I don't know if it should be a b c d or a c b d, then both are permissible.) Of course this is just an example. The real lists are longer (but contain less than 100 elements), contain not single but multiple character elements and the sort order is not alphabetic. Also, I have got up to 5 lists. I need to implement this algorithm in Delphi (and no: This is not homework but a real life problem), but I take an algorithm in an language provided it does not contain too much compiler magic or complex library functions. Performance is not much of an issue because this is done once.

@CONTENT:I'm trying to find a better merge file option and wanted to try out Sublime as of my work is done using it. so I installed Sublimerge and now am stuck. I know I can compare two already open files or compare via the Sidebar but what I want to do is fire it off via the command line so I can kick it off from our source control program like I can with every other merge tool I've seen. Does anyone know the command line format to do this? N.B. - I've long since given up trying to use sublime to handle merges and instead switched to other tools to handle this. Therefore I've never felt I can accept any answer as I'm not checking them to see if they work in the way I'd want, or indeed whether they work at all.

 But it's not so working. Please see this images below.. At first this is what my "Home" looks like. Status bar disappears while playing a video from Youtube/Vimeo (or whatever). When I go back, see them bunched up. Found out that FB figure out how to handle this. They had their status bar appears right there. Any help??? Cheers in advance!

 I understand that problem with RedirectAttributes, But I don't understand how to solve it. By MockMvc how to test that redirectAttributes contains rd and fa ? I use 3.2.3.RELEASE spring framework version
@CODE:@RequestMapping(value="/someURL", method=GET)
public String myMethod(RedirectAttributes redirectAttributes)
{
   redirectAttributes.addAttribute("rd", "rdValue");
   redirectAttributes.addFlashAttribute("fa", faValue);
   return "redirect:/someOtherURL";
} @Test
    public void myMethod() throws Exception{

    MockHttpServletRequestBuilder request = MockMvcRequestBuilders
                .get("/someURL");
    ResultActions result = mockMvc.perform(request);

@TITLE:This API does not support parsing form-encoded input
@CONTENT:I tried to submit data to an endpoint but it said the data size was too large, so I changed the method to POST and received the error: This API does not support parsing form-encoded input.
 Next I changed the type to application/json, still with post and now I am getting: {
"error": {
  "errors": [

    "domain": "global",
"reason": "parseError",
  "message": "Parse Error"
 }
 ],
  "code": 400,
 "message": "Parse Error"
 }
}
 What is the best way to post a large amount of data, i.e. 2730 bytes to an endpoint and have it handle it properly? In my case the field in question is of type Text as I am over the 500 character limit for app engine to hold in a String. Also, as with many things, this works great on my local machine, it only gives this error on the live app engine instance. Thanks!

@CONTENT:This is for a Desktop C# app in Visual Studio Express 2012. I am using a webBrowser control to logon to various websites but find some do not respond and timeout. I suspected it may be the webBrowser control inherently running IE7 but found the websites work fine on an old PC running IE7 as a native browser. Is there something in webBrowser I need to set to allow a website such as the one in the code below to process responses? The code below navigates to a website I am having trouble with. If you enter any values for Login and Password in a native browser, it immediately responds and throws an error , but in a webBrowser it sits there waiting for a response and eventually times-out.

@LINK:/questions/19236628/jetty-9-setting-up-the-most-basic-ssl-https
@TITLE:jetty 9: setting up the most basic SSL / https
@CONTENT:NOTE: If you want to see the behaviour of this demo app, just go to www.collaborativepowernowinternational.us. Here, select the testssl.PersonController, and you may create a person. Then go and edit the person, where the SSL channel is designated, which will give a redirect loop. It seems like with Jetty 9 more configuration items went into the start.ini file, I have version 9.05. In order to test the most basic SSL/https, I am uncommenting the following lines in start.ini: #===========================================================
# SSL Context
# Create the keystore and trust store for use by
# HTTPS and SPDY
#-----------------------------------------------------------
jetty.keystore=etc/keystore
jetty.keystore.password=OBF:1vny1zlo1x8e1vnw1vn61x8g1zlu1vn4
jetty.keymanager.password=OBF:1u2u1wml1z7s1z7a1wnl1u2g
jetty.truststore=etc/keystore
jetty.truststore.password=OBF:1vny1zlo1x8e1vnw1vn61x8g1zlu1vn4
jetty.secure.port=8443
etc/jetty-ssl.xml

#===========================================================
# HTTPS Connector
# Must be used with jetty-ssl.xml
#-----------------------------------------------------------
jetty.https.port=8443
etc/jetty-https.xml
 No other Jetty configuration changes. I then built the most basic Grails app (has a Person class) where I set certain controller actions to secure, which works fine on my development machine using an older built in Jetty version (that Grails includes). This is done simply by including spring-security-core and then adding the following lines to a configuration file: grails.plugins.springsecurity.secureChannel.definition = [
  '/person/list': 'REQUIRES_INSECURE_CHANNEL',
  '/person/delete/**': 'REQUIRES_SECURE_CHANNEL',
  '/person/edit/**': 'REQUIRES_SECURE_CHANNEL',
  '/person/show': 'REQUIRES_INSECURE_CHANNEL'
]

grails.plugins.springsecurity.portMapper.httpPort=80
grails.plugins.springsecurity.portMapper.httpsPort=443
 When I access the person/edit action I get a redirect loop in the browser (using deployed WAR file to Jetty 9 on dedicated CentOs 6 machine). This is using the provided keystore that comes with Jetty 9, just uncommenting the lines in start.ini to use it. The main Jetty SSL configuration page I'm reading is here. What isn't clear to me is, is updating the start.ini file enough? If not, how exactly does one add the lines in jetty-https.xml described in this previous link, i.e. the lines:  <New id="sslContextFactory" class="org.eclipse.jetty.util.ssl.SslContextFactory">
    <Set name="KeyStorePath"><Property name="jetty.home" default="." />/etc/keystore</Set>
    <Set name="KeyStorePassword">OBF:1vny1zlo1x8e1vnw1vn61x8g1zlu1vn4</Set>
    <Set name="KeyManagerPassword">OBF:1u2u1wml1z7s1z7a1wnl1u2g</Set>
    <Set name="TrustStorePath"><Property name="jetty.home" default="." />/etc/keystore</Set>
    <Set name="TrustStorePassword">OBF:1vny1zlo1x8e1vnw1vn61x8g1zlu1vn4</Set>
 </New>
 Not sure how to add them, but they also seem a duplicate of the start.ini file lines above. Can you please help help me get the most basic Jetty SSL running? Thanks much. If not familiar with Grails, one can simply download it, then create a domain class -- there is a command line option for this. Then give it fields String firstName, String lastName. Then there are commands to generate a controller and views for it -- this is all totally automatic. Then one adds the plugin, spring-security-core. In chapter 16/17 of this doc and as I have shown, when lists which controller actions are secure, such as person/edit.

@TITLE:How to get the values for a series of checkboxes in Laravel 4 controller (if checked)
@CONTENT:I would like to get the values for a series of checkboxes I have set up in a Laravel 4 form. Here is the code in the view setting up the checkboxes: @foreach ($friends as $friend)
<input tabindex="1" type="checkbox" name="friend[]" id="{{$friend}}" value="{{$friend}}">
@endforeach
 In my controller, I would like to get the values for the checked boxes and put them in an array. I am not exactly sure how to do this, but I assume it is something like: array[];

foreach($friend as $x)
if (isset(Input::get('friend')) {
        array[] = Input::get('friend');

 } 
endforeach
 Could you provide me with a solution to do this? Thank you. EDIT: This is what I have in the controller: public function describe_favorite() {

            $fan = Fan::find(Auth::user()->id);
            $fan->favorite_venue = Input::get('venue');
            $fan->favorite_experience = Input::get('experience');

            $friends_checked = Input::get('friend[]');

            print_r($friends_checked);

            if(is_array($friends_checked))
            {
             $fan->experience_friends = 5;
            }

            $fan->save();


            return Redirect::to('fans/home');

        }
 It is not going through the "if" loop. How do I see the output of the print_r to see what's in the $friends_checked variable?
@CODE:@foreach ($friends as $friend)
<input tabindex="1" type="checkbox" name="friend[]" id="{{$friend}}" value="{{$friend}}">
@endforeach array[];

foreach($friend as $x)
if (isset(Input::get('friend')) {
        array[] = Input::get('friend');

 } 
endforeach public function describe_favorite() {

            $fan = Fan::find(Auth::user()->id);
            $fan->favorite_venue = Input::get('venue');
            $fan->favorite_experience = Input::get('experience');

            $friends_checked = Input::get('friend[]');

            print_r($friends_checked);

            if(is_array($friends_checked))
            {
             $fan->experience_friends = 5;
            }

            $fan->save();


            return Redirect::to('fans/home');

@TITLE:jQuery change event fired twice when giving focus to another control inside the change callback
@CONTENT:A weird bug caused me a lot of headaches recently, and I've been able to dumb it down to the simplest form possible. See this fiddle : http://jsfiddle.net/PgAAb/ <input type="text" id="foo" placeholder="Change me!"><br>
<input type="text" id="bar" size="30" placeholder="Dummy control to switch focus">

$('#foo').change(function() {
    console.log('Changed!');
    $('#bar').focus();
});
 Basically, when you change the first textbox and use the mouse to click elsewhere in the document, the change event fires, as usual. However, if you change the value, and hit the enter key to trigger the change, the event fires twice. I've noticed the bug is only with Chrome. Firefox does not trigger the event twice, and IE does not even support the enter key to trigger change on an input. I guess that happens because of the focus switching inside the event callback. Is there any way around this?
@CODE:<input type="text" id="foo" placeholder="Change me!"><br>
<input type="text" id="bar" size="30" placeholder="Dummy control to switch focus">

$('#foo').change(function() {
    console.log('Changed!');
    $('#bar').focus();

@TITLE:Dynamically toggle visibility of WPF grid column from C# code
@CONTENT:My problem is: I can't find out how to toggle the visibility of my WPF grid column. Assume following XAML markup: <Grid x:Name="myGrid">
    <Grid.RowDefinitions>
        <RowDefinition x:Name="Row1" />
        <RowDefinition x:Name="Row2" />

        <ColumnDefinition x:Name="Column1" />
        <ColumnDefinition x:Name="Column2" />
    </Grid.ColumnDefinitions>
</Grid>
 Aferwards the grid is filled with some controls etc. Now I want to hide a single column dynamically out of my C# code. I've tried achieving this by setting the the column's definition width to zero, e.g. Column1.Width = 0. This works, but I don't really like this solution - is there really no better way? I'm looking for something like myGrid.Columns[0].Visibility = COLLAPSED or Column1.Visibility = HIDDEN. I just can't find something like that - any ideas?
@CODE:<Grid x:Name="myGrid">
    <Grid.RowDefinitions>
        <RowDefinition x:Name="Row1" />

@TITLE:Calling C++ function from Excel and VBA using DLL created in C++
@CONTENT:I've created DLL containing function named "koduj". Calling this function by using it inside Excel Worksheet Cell returns desired result. Calling "koduj" from VBA's codefile returns wrong answer. koduj needs two arguments: string nr_id and integer x1. It calculates sum of nr_id's letters in ASCII representation and adds x1. Calculated sum is than returned. I was following instructions found here Here's my .cpp sourcefile: #include<Windows.h>
#include<string>
using namespace std;


//Convert BSTR to wstring for convenience
wstring BSTR_to_wstring (BSTR text){
    return wstring(text, SysStringLen(text));
}

//Calculate sum of letters in ASCII representation
int ASCII_sum (wstring ws){
    int sum = 0;
    for (unsigned int i = 0; i < ws.length(); i++)
        sum += ws[i];
    return sum;
}

//"koduj" function
int _stdcall koduj (BSTR nr_id, int & x1){
    wstring ws_nr_id = BSTR_to_wstring(nr_id);
    return ASCII_sum(ws_nr_id) + x1;
}
 Here's my VBA function declaration: Declare Function koduj _
Lib "<dll_directory_and_full_name>" (ByVal x As String, ByRef y As Integer) As Integer
 By writing: =koduj("aaa";1)
 inside Worksheet's Cell i get desired result (292) Debugging this VBA code: Sub test()

Dim a As Integer
a = koduj("aaa", 1)

End Sub
 reveals wrong result (a = 24930) I am absolute novice considering DLLs and VBA programming, so please take into consideration that I could have made some beginner's mistake. I belive my C++ code is fine, as it works properly when called from Excel's Worksheet.

@TITLE:Map value to color scale
@CONTENT:I have a list of values which should be plotted to a map with a certain color. The plotting to the map is already done, but I need to figure out a way to map the value n to a color that represents its value. An example and my solution so far is to normalize the values based on the min and max and then assign them to hex color 0 for the lowest and 255 for the highest. This of course limits my self to the grey scale. Here is the code: $color = ($value / $max) * 255    // (min is zero)
 But how to do this if the values should go from blue to red for instance? Is there any common libraries or tools that can solve this? So far I haven't been able to locate any.

 So should i do this several times for n_clusters = 1...n and watch at the Error rate to get the right k ? think this would be stupid and would take a lot of time?!

@TITLE:Access Denied when uploading files to Amazon using Paperclip and IAM policies
@CONTENT:I am unable to get an upload working with Paperclip using an S3 IAM policy. I'm even having issues with direct jQuery uploads (no Paperclip). My scenario is as follows, I have an application that will have many sites. Each site will have it's own bucket and should only be able to access their own bucket, nobody else's. The IAM Example Policies documentation explains exactly what I want to do under "Example: Allow each IAM user access to a folder in a bucket". I have an IAM group set up for the application and have one user per site within the group. These IAM users belong to the group. The policy on the group is as follows: {
   "Version":"2012-10-17",
   "Statement":[{
         "Effect":"Allow",
         "Action":[
            "s3:PutObject",
            "s3:GetObject",
            "s3:GetObjectVersion",
            "s3:DeleteObject",
            "s3:DeleteObjectVersion"
         ],
         "Resource":"arn:aws:s3:::my-app/${aws:username}/*"
      }
   ]
}
 Here is my CORS configuration on the bucket, for dev of course, it will get locked down later: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<CORSConfiguration xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
    <CORSRule>

 Here are my Paperclip settings: has_attached_file :background_image,
                  storage: :s3,
                  s3_credentials: {
                    access_key_id: "xxx",
                    secret_access_key: "xxx"
                  },
                  bucket: "my-app",
                  s3_permissions: "public-read",
                  path: "/background_images/:id/:filename"
 I was previously working with policies directly on the bucket, which did work but wasn't as flexible as I need it to be when I move into a production environment with many "sites". As far as I can tell I've followed the documentation exactly yet anything I do results in 'Access Denied'. At this point I'm not even sure if my issue is with my IAM policy or my Paperclip configuration. edit: clarification. edit 2: FINAL SOLUTION Here is my final IAM policy based on this article: {
 "Version":"2012-10-17",
 "Statement": [
   {
     "Sid": "AllowUserToSeeBucketListInTheConsole",
     "Action": ["s3:ListAllMyBuckets", "s3:GetBucketLocation"],
     "Effect": "Allow",
     "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::*"]
   },
  {
     "Sid": "AllowRootAndHomeListingOfCompanyBucket",
     "Action": ["s3:ListBucket"],
     "Effect": "Allow",
     "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::my-app"],
     "Condition":{"StringEquals":{"s3:prefix":["","home/"],"s3:delimiter":["/"]}}
    },
   {
     "Sid": "AllowListingOfUserFolder",
     "Action": ["s3:ListBucket"],
     "Effect": "Allow",
     "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::estimator-app"],
     "Condition":{"StringLike":{"s3:prefix":["home/${aws:username}/*"]}}
   },
   {
     "Sid": "AllowAllS3ActionsInUserFolder",
     "Effect": "Allow",
     "Action": ["s3:*"],
     "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::my-app/home/${aws:username}/*"]
   }
 ]
}
 And my updated Paperclip settings: has_attached_file :background_image,
                    storage: :s3,
                    s3_credentials: {
                      access_key_id: "xxx",
                      secret_access_key: "xxx"
                    },
                    bucket: "estimator-app",
                    s3_permissions: "public-read",
                    path: "/home/my_s3_username/background_images/:id/:filename"
 It was important to include the username in the Paperclip path. I was assuming Amazon would infer that from the credentials but that's not the case.

@CONTENT:I am trying to call a web service cross domain from within an HTML widget. This does not seem to work. It worked great under the same domain. I am trying to create a log in page within Orchard that could be used to log in to my software on another domain. The web service is validating the user credentials and returning a boolean which then would generate the users authentication. I read that I could use an HTTP Handler or another web service (on the Orchard side) to call the web service on the other domain, but I'm not familiar enough with MVC or Orchard to do this. How can I add one of these to my Orchard web application?

@TITLE:Printing a Form/UserControl in C#
@CONTENT:My Program: Contains a form with few textboxes and one button. 'Default Printer' is set as Adobe PDF on my computer. My Goal: Want to take a screenshot of a form/usercontrol when the user clicks 'Print' button. The screenshot is then saved on the desktop in .pdf format. My Problem: I have following two problems with the code: Size of Screenshot: The size of the screenshot is too big and it does not fit the size of the page (default page size) when printed/converted to .pdf. Please refer the two images below. I want the entire screenshot to fit inside the page. Asks twice where to convert and save: When I click on 'Print Form' button, programs asks me TWICE where to print/convert and save the file. I want the program to ask me only Once, where to print and save the file. Problem 1: The screenshot captured by the program does not fit the page when printed. I want the screenshot image to fit like this on one page of .pdf: Code: public partial class Form1 : Form
{
    public Form1()
    {
        InitializeComponent();
        button1.Text = "Print Form";
        button1.Click += new EventHandler(button1_Click);

@CONTENT:Based on a proposed answer to my other question here... is it possible to update a variable during LINQ enumeration so you can use it as part of a test? For instance, is anything like this possible? // Assume limitItem is of type Foo and sourceList is of type List<Foo> 

// Note the faux attempt to set limitItemFound in the TakeWhile clause
// That is what I'm wondering.

sourceList.Reverse()
    .TakeWhile(o => (o != limitItem) && !limitItemFound; limitItemFound = limitItemFound || (o == limitItem) )
    .FirstOrDefault(o => ...);
 This would make the search inclusive of limitItem.

@TITLE:In the context of year values how does ¡§aaaa¡¨ differ from ¡§yyyy¡¨?
@CONTENT:Referring to the SimpleDateFormat docs, the pattern character for representing years is y, so we have representations like yy and yyyy (13, 2013 respectively). That's fine. When I output the DEFAULT / SHORT / MEDIUM / LONG / FULL patterns for most locales, I get something along these lines: (EG: New Zealand) Default: d/MM/yyyy
Short: d/MM/yy
Medium: d/MM/yyyy
Long: d MMMM yyyy
Full: EEEE, d MMMM yyyy
 However looking at some locales, eg France, I get this: Default: j MMM aaaa
Short: jj/MM/aa
Medium: j MMM aaaa
Long: j MMMM aaaa
Full: EEEE j MMMM aaaa
 Obviously here aaaa is a representation of the year, but what's the distinction in intent between yyyy and aaaa? IE: why do they use aaaa instead of just yyyy. Initially I thought it might be something along the lines of French for "[y]ear" is "[a]nn?e" (and "[d]ay" is "[j]our", but I see it's also aaaa for Hungarian (and many other locales), and Hungarian for "year" is "?v" (day "nap"), so I think the "a" / "ann?e" correlation I'm making is coincidence. So what is the difference one is supposed to infer here? I googled about, but drew a blank. Also it might be as obvious as an obvious thing to a Java dev, but I'm just a CFML dev who simply bolts Java into my CFML occasionally when Java does something more expediently than I can do it in native CFML. So sorry if it's a dumb question.
@CODE:y yy yyyy DEFAULT SHORT MEDIUM LONG FULL Default: d/MM/yyyy
Short: d/MM/yy
Medium: d/MM/yyyy
Long: d MMMM yyyy
Full: EEEE, d MMMM yyyy Default: j MMM aaaa

Long: j MMMM aaaa

@LINK:/questions/19134105/playframework-runtimeexception-java-lang-reflect-invocationtargetexception
@TITLE:Playframework: [RuntimeException: java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException]
@CONTENT:I'm trying to create a simple login based on the Zentask sample --zentask - playframework, however when I click the login button which calls the Application.authenticate actions, it gives runtime exception. I have marked the line with -- error [RuntimeException: java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException]
 Application.java public class Application extends Controller {

.........

public static class Login 
{
    public String email;
    public String password;

    public String validate() 
    {
        if (User.authenticate(email, password) == null) {
          return "Invalid user or password";
        }
        return null;
    }
}

   public static Result authenticate() 
    {
        Form<Login> loginForm = form(Login.class).bindFromRequest();  //--- error
        if(loginForm.hasErrors()) {
            return badRequest(login.render(loginForm));
        } else {
            session("email", loginForm.get().email);
            return redirect(
                routes.Application.index()
            );
        }
    }
}
 I understand it has something to do with the validate function in Login Class, because when I remove the call to User.authenticate in the validate function it works without error. But I am unable to figure it out. The user class is as - @Entity
public class User extends Model
{
    @Id
    @Constraints.Required
    @Formats.NonEmpty
    public String userId;

    @OneToOne(cascade=CascadeType.PERSIST)
    AccountDetails accDetails;


    public static Model.Finder<String,User> find = new Model.Finder<String,User>(String.class, User.class);



    // Authenticate the user details
    public static User authenticate(String email, String password) 
    {
        String tempId = AccountDetails.authenticate(email, password).userId;

        return find.ref(tempId);
    }

    .. . . . . . .

}
 and the AccountDetails Class - @Entity
public class AccountDetails extends Model
{
    @Id
    String userId;

    @Constraints.Required
    String emailId;

    @Constraints.Required
    String password;

    public static Model.Finder<String,AccountDetails> find = 
            new Model.Finder<String,AccountDetails>(String.class, AccountDetails.class);


    public static AccountDetails authenticate(String email, String password) 
    {       
        return find.where()
            .eq("email", email)
            .eq("password", password)
            .findUnique();
    }

}
 Any help would be highly appreciated. Thanx a lot.

@TITLE:Force use of locks inside std::atomic during debugging with libstdc++
@CONTENT:I've done a bit of a google and can't seem to turn up a GCC option or libstdc++ macro for this. Is it possible to force the use of locking internally on all the std::atomic template specializations. On some platforms some of the specializations are locking anyway, so it certainly seems like a feasible option. In the past I've found the use of std::atomic to be very painful when debugging data-races with tools such as Valgrind (Helgrind or DRD) due to the enormous number of false positives. If use of atomics is pervasive enough, suppression files seem to not be a very scalable solution.

@TITLE:Parse dates in format dmy together with dmY using parse_date_time in package lubridate
@CONTENT:I have a vector of character representation of dates, where formats mostly are dmY (e.g. 27-09-2013), dmy (e.g. 27-09-13), and occasionally some b or B months. Thus, parse_date_time in package lubridate that "allows the user to specify several format-orders to handle heterogeneous date-time character representations" could be a very useful function for me. However, it seems that parse_date_time has problem parsing dmy dates when they occur together with dmY dates. When parsing dmy alone, or dmy together with some other formats relevant to me, it works fine. This pattern was also noted in a comment to @Peyton's answer here. A quick fix was suggested, but I wish to ask if it is possible to handle it in lubridate. Here I show some examples where I try to parse dates on dmy format together with some other formats, and specifying orders accordingly. library(lubridate)
# version: lubridate_1.3.0

# regarding how date format is specified in 'orders':
# examples in ?parse_date_time
# parse_date_time(x, "ymd")
# parse_date_time(x, "%y%m%d")
# parse_date_time(x, "%y %m %d")
# these order strings are equivalent and parses the same way
# "Formatting orders might include arbitrary separators. These are discarded"

# dmy date only
parse_date_time(x = "27-09-13", orders = "d m y")
# [1] "2013-09-27 UTC"
# OK

# dmy & dBY
parse_date_time(c("27-09-13", "27 September 2013"), orders = c("d m y", "d B Y"))
# [1] "2013-09-27 UTC" "2013-09-27 UTC"
# OK

# dmy & dbY
parse_date_time(c("27-09-13", "27 Sep 2013"), orders = c("d m y", "d b Y"))
# [1] "2013-09-27 UTC" "2013-09-27 UTC"
# OK

# dmy & dmY
parse_date_time(c("27-09-13", "27-09-2013"), orders = c("d m y", "d m Y"))
# [1] "0013-09-27 UTC" "2013-09-27 UTC"
# not OK

# does order of the date components matter?
parse_date_time(c("2013-09-27", "13-09-13"), orders = c("Y m d", "y m d"))
# [1] "2013-09-27 UTC" "0013-09-27 UTC"
# no
 What about the select_formats argument? I am sorry to say this, but I have a hard time understand this section of the help file. And a search for select_formats on SO: 0 results. Still, this section seemed relevant: "By default the formats with most formating tockens (%) are selected and %Y counts as 2.5 tockens (so that it can have priority over %y%m).". So I (desperately) tried with some additional dmy dates: parse_date_time(c("27-09-2013", rep("27-09-13", 10)), orders = c("d m y", "d m Y"))
# not OK. Tried also 100 dmy dates.

# does order in the vector matter?
parse_date_time(c(rep("27-09-13", 10), "27-09-2013"), orders = c("d m y", "d m Y"))
# no
 I then checked how the guess_formats function (also in lubridate) handled dmy together with dmY: guess_formats(c("27-09-13", "27-09-2013"), c("dmy", "dmY"), print_matches = TRUE)
#                   dmy        dmY       
# [1,] "27-09-13"   "%d-%m-%y" ""        
# [2,] "27-09-2013" "%d-%m-%Y" "%d-%m-%Y"
# OK   
 From ?guess_formats: y also matches Y. From ?parse_date_time: y* Year without century (00¡V99 or 0¡V99). Also matches year with century (Y format). So I tried: guess_formats(c("27-09-13", "27-09-2013"), c("dmy"), print_matches = TRUE)
#                   dmy       
# [1,] "27-09-13"   "%d-%m-%y"
# [2,] "27-09-2013" "%d-%m-%Y"
# OK
 Thus, guess_format seems to be able to deal with dmy together with dmY. But how can I tell parse_date_time to do the same? Thanks in advance for any comments or help. Update I posted the question on the lubridate bug report, and got a rapid reply from @vitoshka: "This is a bug".

@TITLE:YouTube API v3 with OAuth2: update and delete fail with ¡§Insufficient Permission¡¨ error
@CONTENT:I am trying to update and delete videos using the YouTube API v3 with OAuth2 for authentication via the google-api-client (0.6.4) Ruby gem. However, when I attempt to execute either of these two actions, I see the following error message: Google::APIClient::ClientError: Insufficient Permission
 Here's the odd thing: Using the exact same authentication procedure as with update and delete, I can insert (upload) successfully, no problem! So, I do not believe this is a problem with my authentication setup, but somewhere else in my code. My read-write scope is always the same across any of these actions: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.upload
 And according to the API documentation, that space-delimited set of scopes should cover insert, update and delete actions. My client_id, client_secret, refresh_token are always the same for all these actions too -- so, that can't be the problem either, can it? Note that my program automatically obtains a new access_token when it expires, so, again, I do not believe that is where the problem lies. To compare, here is what my insert (upload) code looks like (this works): # Auth stuff, then...
@client.execute!(
  :api_method => @youtube.videos.insert,
  :body_object => body,
  :media => Google::APIClient::UploadIO.new(file_path, 'video/*'),
  :parameters => {
    'uploadType' => 'multipart',
    :part => body.keys.join(','),
  }
)
 And here is what my delete code looks like (this fails): # Auth stuff, then...
@client.execute!(
  :api_method => @youtube.videos.delete,
  :parameters => {
    'id' => youtube_id,
  }
)
 What am I missing? Unfortunately, the YouTube API documentation for delete does not provide any examples, so I've got nothing to compare against. Please let me know if there is further information that I can provide to make my question clearer.
@CODE:update delete google-api-client (0.6.4) Google::APIClient::ClientError: Insufficient Permission update delete insert scope https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.upload insert update delete client_id client_secret refresh_token access_token insert # Auth stuff, then...

The problem is with my menu. I think because of my menu , it is cycling through all of the commands before doing the command selected. Any help with this will be fully appreciated, the batch script is in a code box below. echo off

@LINK:/questions/19118854/unable-to-cross-compile-to-sparc-using-clang
@TITLE:Unable to cross-compile to SPARC using clang
@CONTENT:So here's the situation: I need to be able to compile binaries from a Linux machine (on Ubuntu, for what it's worth) which are able to run from a SPARC server. The program I'm trying to compile is very simple: #include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    printf("Testing the SPARC program...");
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
 I've tried a number of different compile lines to get it to work, but unfortunately nothing appears to be working. I tried the traditional:  clang -target sparc blah.c -o blahsparc
 But this doesn't work, with a bunch of assembler failures:  /tmp/blah-519e77.s: Assembler messages:
 /tmp/blah-519e77.s:7: Error: unknown pseudo-op: '.register'
 /tmp/blah-519e77.s:8: Error: unknown pseudo-op: '.register'

 /tmp/blah-519e77.s:10: Error: unknown pseudo-op: '.register'

 /tmp/blah-519e77.s:12: Error: no such instruction: 'st %g0, [%fp+2043]'
 ...
 clang: error: assembler (via gcc) command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
 I've tried this also: clang -cc1 -triple "sparc-unknown-Linux" blah.c -o blahsparc
 which complains about the missing headers, so instead of using -cc1, I use -Xclang: clang -Xclang -triple -Xclang "sparc-unknown-Linux" blah.c -o blahsparc
 however, this also fails due to "error: unknown target CPU 'x86-64'". I'm not sure where to proceed with this. I've tried using crosstool-ng as well with very little success.

#include <stdlib.h>

@LINK:/questions/19106976/technique-for-extending-a-class-with-private-constructors
@TITLE:Technique for extending a class with private constructors
@CONTENT:Is there a standard technique to "extend" a class with private constructors, as with most Singleton classes? Specifcally, I'm trying to extend the java.lang.management.ThreadInfo class because I'm adding a LOT of them to a HashSet to control uniqueness. However, the way I determine if two threads are equal is different and not identical to the default implementation of the equals() method. Extending the class is obviously not an option in this case. Would it be reasonable to make something like a wrapper class which accepts a ThreadInfo in the constructor and then manually populates all relevant fields with the values, then overrides equals() and hashCode(), or is there a better way to do this? Something like this is what I'm starting to write, but a better implementation would be ideal: class ThreadInfoWrapper {

    private ThreadInfo info;
    ThreadInfoWrapper(ThreadInfo info) {
        this.info = info;
    }

    //Populate instance variables with Thread.State, thread ID, etc.. with
    //Getters/setters and all that other stuff

    public boolean equals(Object o) { //Unique implementation
    }

    public int hashCode() { //Whatever implementation
    }

}
 But this feels like a very roundabout way to achieve some basic functionality. I looked into it, and implementations of Sets with custom Comparators do not exist in the Java standard library. I suppose I could write my own hash set implementation but that's too much work for a simple situation. Any insights would be helpful.
@CODE:java.lang.management.ThreadInfo HashSet equals() ThreadInfo equals() hashCode() class ThreadInfoWrapper {

    private ThreadInfo info;
    ThreadInfoWrapper(ThreadInfo info) {
        this.info = info;
    }

    //Populate instance variables with Thread.State, thread ID, etc.. with
    //Getters/setters and all that other stuff

    public boolean equals(Object o) { //Unique implementation
    }

    public int hashCode() { //Whatever implementation
    }

@LINK:/questions/19106826/can-static-cast-to-same-type-introduce-runtime-overhead
@TITLE:Can static_cast to same type introduce runtime overhead?
@CONTENT:I have a structure template that takes two types (T and S), and at some point uses a static_cast to convert from one type to the other. It is often the case that T and S are the same type. A simplified example of the setup: template <typename T, typename S = T>
struct foo
{
  void bar(T val)
  {
    /* ... */
    some_other_function(static_cast<S>(val));
    /* ... */
  }
};
 In the case that S is the same class as T, does or can the static_cast introduce extra overhead, or is it a null operation which will always be ignored? If it does introduce overhead, is there a simple template metaprogramming trick to perform the static_cast only if needed, or will I need to create a partial specialization to cope with the T == S case? I'd rather avoid the partial specialization of the entire foo template if possible.
@CODE:T S static_cast T S template <typename T, typename S = T>
struct foo
{
  void bar(T val)
  {
    /* ... */
    some_other_function(static_cast<S>(val));
    /* ... */
  }
}; S T static_cast static_cast T == S foo int a = 5; int b = static_cast<int>(a); std::string some_other_function const std::string& val val

@TITLE:why initializer list cannot be main's parameter? how to propose it?
@CONTENT:The valid C++ main signatures are the following: int main()
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
int main(int argc, char **argv)
 But isn't allowed to declare main taking an initializer list: int main(std::initializer_list<char *> args)
 AFAIK the initializer list could be implemented as a pair of pointers or a pointer (this could be the argv parameter) plus a length (this could be deduced from the argc parameter), and its storage could be automatic, temporary, or static read-only memory depending on the situation. So i think that an std::initializer_list<char *> could handle and manage without any problem the command line parameters, then i'm wondering why this hypothetical main signature wasn't added after the approval of the initializer lists on the C++11 standard, and because of that i'm asking: What could be the disadvantages or problems derived of allowing an initializer list as the main only parameter? (i couldn't think of any). Which would be the correct way to propose to the standards committee this addition (or any other change)?

int main(int argc, char *argv[])

@CONTENT:I want to make my Qt Window stay on top. When setWindowFlags(Qt::WindowStaysOnTopHint) is executed, the window becomes hidden (on Windows 7). I've also tried: Qt::WindowFlags flags = windowFlags();
setWindowFlags(flags | Qt::WindowStaysOnTopHint);
 And, it still does the same. What did I do wrong here?

@TITLE:hooks versus middleware in slim 2.0
@CONTENT:Can anyone explain if there are any significant advantages or disadvantages when choosing to implement features such as authentication or caching etc using hooks as opposed to using middleware? For instance - I can implement a translation feature by obtaining the request object through custom middleware and setting an app language variable that can be used to load the correct translation file when the app executes. Or I can add a hook before the routing and read the request variable and then load the correct file during the app execution. Is there any obvious reason I am missing that makes one choice better than the other?

@TITLE:What does [^.]* mean in regular expression?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to get 482.75 from the following text: <span id="yfs_l84_aapl">482.75</span> The regex I used is: regex = '<span id="yfs_l84_[^.]*">(.+?)</span>' and it worked. But the thing that I do not understand is why [^.]* can match aapl here? My understanding is that . means any character except a newline; and ^ means negator. So [^.] should be newline and [^.]* should be any number of new lines. However this theory is contrary to real world implementation. Any help is appreciated and thanks in advance. The python code I used: import urllib
import re 
htmlfile = urllib.urlopen("http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=AAPL&ql=0")
htmltext = htmlfile.read()
regex = '<span id="yfs_l84_[^.]*">(.+?)</span>'
pattern = re.compile(regex)
price = re.findall(pattern, htmltext)
print "the price of of aapl is", price[0]

@TITLE:What has happened to MultiBinding between .NET 3.5 and .NET 4.5?
@CONTENT:We are currently in the process of converting a project from version 3.5 to version 4.5 of .NET. We set a text box IsEnabled flagged using a multi binding with a multi binding converter. Each of the bindings has their own converter. All worked well in .NET 3.5 but in .NET 4.5 the target type that is passed to the child converter is of type object instead of bool. Is this a known issue? has MS refactored the multi binding to not pass the target type to child converters. I created a simplified project that demonstrates the issue. I created the project in VS2008 and then converted it to VS2012 and .NET 4.5. Window XAML: <Window x:Class="TestMultiBinding.Window1"

@TITLE:numpy/scipy analog of matlab's fminsearch
@CONTENT:I am converting some Matlab code into python using numpy. Everything worked pretty smoothly but recently I encountered fminsearch function. So, to cut it short: is there an easy way to make in python something like this: banana = @(x)100*(x(2)-x(1)^2)^2+(1-x(1))^2;
[x,fval] = fminsearch(banana,[-1.2, 1])
 which will return x = 1.0000    1.0000
fval = 8.1777e-010
 Up till now I have not found anything that looks similar in numpy. The only thing that I found similar is scipy.optimize.fmin. Based on the definition it Minimize a function using the downhill simplex algorithm. But right now I can not find to write the above-mentioned Matlab code using this function
@CODE:banana = @(x)100*(x(2)-x(1)^2)^2+(1-x(1))^2;
[x,fval] = fminsearch(banana,[-1.2, 1]) x = 1.0000    1.0000

@CONTENT:Based on a proposed answer to my other question here... is it possible to update a variable during LINQ enumeration so you can use it as part of a test? For instance, is anything like this possible? // Assume limitItem is of type Foo and sourceList is of type List<Foo> 

// Note the faux attempt to set limitItemFound in the TakeWhile clause
// That is what I'm wondering.

sourceList.Reverse()
    .TakeWhile(o => (o != limitItem) && !limitItemFound; limitItemFound = limitItemFound || (o == limitItem) )
    .FirstOrDefault(o => ...);
 This would make the search inclusive of limitItem.

@LINK:/questions/19154099/in-the-context-of-year-values-how-does-aaaa-differ-from-yyyy
@TITLE:In the context of year values how does ¡§aaaa¡¨ differ from ¡§yyyy¡¨?
@CONTENT:Referring to the SimpleDateFormat docs, the pattern character for representing years is y, so we have representations like yy and yyyy (13, 2013 respectively). That's fine. When I output the DEFAULT / SHORT / MEDIUM / LONG / FULL patterns for most locales, I get something along these lines: (EG: New Zealand) Default: d/MM/yyyy
Short: d/MM/yy
Medium: d/MM/yyyy
Long: d MMMM yyyy
Full: EEEE, d MMMM yyyy
 However looking at some locales, eg France, I get this: Default: j MMM aaaa
Short: jj/MM/aa
Medium: j MMM aaaa
Long: j MMMM aaaa
Full: EEEE j MMMM aaaa
 Obviously here aaaa is a representation of the year, but what's the distinction in intent between yyyy and aaaa? IE: why do they use aaaa instead of just yyyy. Initially I thought it might be something along the lines of French for "[y]ear" is "[a]nn?e" (and "[d]ay" is "[j]our", but I see it's also aaaa for Hungarian (and many other locales), and Hungarian for "year" is "?v" (day "nap"), so I think the "a" / "ann?e" correlation I'm making is coincidence. So what is the difference one is supposed to infer here? I googled about, but drew a blank. Also it might be as obvious as an obvious thing to a Java dev, but I'm just a CFML dev who simply bolts Java into my CFML occasionally when Java does something more expediently than I can do it in native CFML. So sorry if it's a dumb question.
@CODE:y yy yyyy DEFAULT SHORT MEDIUM LONG FULL Default: d/MM/yyyy
Short: d/MM/yy
Medium: d/MM/yyyy
Long: d MMMM yyyy
Full: EEEE, d MMMM yyyy Default: j MMM aaaa
Short: jj/MM/aa
Medium: j MMM aaaa
Long: j MMMM aaaa
Full: EEEE j MMMM aaaa aaaa yyyy aaaa aaaa yyyy aaaa

@TITLE:E2009 Incompatible types: 'Parameter lists differ'
@CONTENT:I get the following error: E2009 Incompatible types: 'Parameter lists differ' However I disagree, looking at the definitions I can see no difference. Here's the record definition: type

 And here's the Mod function I want to assign: function dividefixedi32(const Buffer: TFastDiv; x: integer): integer;
asm
 The following assignment issues the error: class operator TFastDiv.Implicit(a: integer): TFastDiv;

@TITLE:Playframework: [RuntimeException: java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException]
@CONTENT:I'm trying to create a simple login based on the Zentask sample --zentask - playframework, however when I click the login button which calls the Application.authenticate actions, it gives runtime exception. I have marked the line with -- error [RuntimeException: java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException]
 Application.java public class Application extends Controller {

.........

public static class Login 
{
    public String email;
    public String password;

          return "Invalid user or password";
        }
        return null;
    }
}

        Form<Login> loginForm = form(Login.class).bindFromRequest();  //--- error
        if(loginForm.hasErrors()) {
            return badRequest(login.render(loginForm));
        } else {
            session("email", loginForm.get().email);

                routes.Application.index()
            );
        }
    }
}
 I understand it has something to do with the validate function in Login Class, because when I remove the call to User.authenticate in the validate function it works without error. But I am unable to figure it out. The user class is as - @Entity
public class User extends Model
{
    @Id
    @Constraints.Required
    @Formats.NonEmpty
    public String userId;

    @OneToOne(cascade=CascadeType.PERSIST)
    AccountDetails accDetails;


    public static Model.Finder<String,User> find = new Model.Finder<String,User>(String.class, User.class);



    // Authenticate the user details
    public static User authenticate(String email, String password) 
    {
        String tempId = AccountDetails.authenticate(email, password).userId;

        return find.ref(tempId);
    }

    .. . . . . . .

}
 and the AccountDetails Class - @Entity
public class AccountDetails extends Model
{
    @Id
    String userId;

    @Constraints.Required
    String emailId;

    @Constraints.Required
    String password;

    public static Model.Finder<String,AccountDetails> find = 
            new Model.Finder<String,AccountDetails>(String.class, AccountDetails.class);


    public static AccountDetails authenticate(String email, String password) 
    {       
        return find.where()
            .eq("email", email)
            .eq("password", password)
            .findUnique();
    }

}
 Any help would be highly appreciated. Thanx a lot.

@TITLE:Force use of locks inside std::atomic during debugging with libstdc++
@CONTENT:I've done a bit of a google and can't seem to turn up a GCC option or libstdc++ macro for this. Is it possible to force the use of locking internally on all the std::atomic template specializations. On some platforms some of the specializations are locking anyway, so it certainly seems like a feasible option. In the past I've found the use of std::atomic to be very painful when debugging data-races with tools such as Valgrind (Helgrind or DRD) due to the enormous number of false positives. If use of atomics is pervasive enough, suppression files seem to not be a very scalable solution.

@TITLE:Parse dates in format dmy together with dmY using parse_date_time in package lubridate
@CONTENT:I have a vector of character representation of dates, where formats mostly are dmY (e.g. 27-09-2013), dmy (e.g. 27-09-13), and occasionally some b or B months. Thus, parse_date_time in package lubridate that "allows the user to specify several format-orders to handle heterogeneous date-time character representations" could be a very useful function for me. However, it seems that parse_date_time has problem parsing dmy dates when they occur together with dmY dates. When parsing dmy alone, or dmy together with some other formats relevant to me, it works fine. This pattern was also noted in a comment to @Peyton's answer here. A quick fix was suggested, but I wish to ask if it is possible to handle it in lubridate. Here I show some examples where I try to parse dates on dmy format together with some other formats, and specifying orders accordingly. library(lubridate)
# version: lubridate_1.3.0

# regarding how date format is specified in 'orders':
# examples in ?parse_date_time
# parse_date_time(x, "ymd")
# parse_date_time(x, "%y%m%d")
# parse_date_time(x, "%y %m %d")
# these order strings are equivalent and parses the same way
# "Formatting orders might include arbitrary separators. These are discarded"

# dmy date only
parse_date_time(x = "27-09-13", orders = "d m y")
# [1] "2013-09-27 UTC"
# OK

# dmy & dBY
parse_date_time(c("27-09-13", "27 September 2013"), orders = c("d m y", "d B Y"))
# [1] "2013-09-27 UTC" "2013-09-27 UTC"
# OK

# dmy & dbY
parse_date_time(c("27-09-13", "27 Sep 2013"), orders = c("d m y", "d b Y"))
# [1] "2013-09-27 UTC" "2013-09-27 UTC"
# OK

# dmy & dmY
parse_date_time(c("27-09-13", "27-09-2013"), orders = c("d m y", "d m Y"))
# [1] "0013-09-27 UTC" "2013-09-27 UTC"
# not OK

# does order of the date components matter?
parse_date_time(c("2013-09-27", "13-09-13"), orders = c("Y m d", "y m d"))
# [1] "2013-09-27 UTC" "0013-09-27 UTC"
# no
 What about the select_formats argument? I am sorry to say this, but I have a hard time understand this section of the help file. And a search for select_formats on SO: 0 results. Still, this section seemed relevant: "By default the formats with most formating tockens (%) are selected and %Y counts as 2.5 tockens (so that it can have priority over %y%m).". So I (desperately) tried with some additional dmy dates: parse_date_time(c("27-09-2013", rep("27-09-13", 10)), orders = c("d m y", "d m Y"))
# not OK. Tried also 100 dmy dates.

# does order in the vector matter?
parse_date_time(c(rep("27-09-13", 10), "27-09-2013"), orders = c("d m y", "d m Y"))
# no
 I then checked how the guess_formats function (also in lubridate) handled dmy together with dmY: guess_formats(c("27-09-13", "27-09-2013"), c("dmy", "dmY"), print_matches = TRUE)
#                   dmy        dmY       
# [1,] "27-09-13"   "%d-%m-%y" ""        
# [2,] "27-09-2013" "%d-%m-%Y" "%d-%m-%Y"
# OK   
 From ?guess_formats: y also matches Y. From ?parse_date_time: y* Year without century (00¡V99 or 0¡V99). Also matches year with century (Y format). So I tried: guess_formats(c("27-09-13", "27-09-2013"), c("dmy"), print_matches = TRUE)
#                   dmy       
# [1,] "27-09-13"   "%d-%m-%y"
# [2,] "27-09-2013" "%d-%m-%Y"
# OK
 Thus, guess_format seems to be able to deal with dmy together with dmY. But how can I tell parse_date_time to do the same? Thanks in advance for any comments or help. Update I posted the question on the lubridate bug report, and got a rapid reply from @vitoshka: "This is a bug".

@TITLE:YouTube API v3 with OAuth2: update and delete fail with ¡§Insufficient Permission¡¨ error
@CONTENT:I am trying to update and delete videos using the YouTube API v3 with OAuth2 for authentication via the google-api-client (0.6.4) Ruby gem. However, when I attempt to execute either of these two actions, I see the following error message: Google::APIClient::ClientError: Insufficient Permission
 Here's the odd thing: Using the exact same authentication procedure as with update and delete, I can insert (upload) successfully, no problem! So, I do not believe this is a problem with my authentication setup, but somewhere else in my code. My read-write scope is always the same across any of these actions: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.upload
 And according to the API documentation, that space-delimited set of scopes should cover insert, update and delete actions. My client_id, client_secret, refresh_token are always the same for all these actions too -- so, that can't be the problem either, can it? Note that my program automatically obtains a new access_token when it expires, so, again, I do not believe that is where the problem lies. To compare, here is what my insert (upload) code looks like (this works): # Auth stuff, then...
@client.execute!(
  :api_method => @youtube.videos.insert,
  :body_object => body,
  :media => Google::APIClient::UploadIO.new(file_path, 'video/*'),
  :parameters => {
    'uploadType' => 'multipart',
    :part => body.keys.join(','),
  }
)
 And here is what my delete code looks like (this fails): # Auth stuff, then...
@client.execute!(
  :api_method => @youtube.videos.delete,
  :parameters => {
    'id' => youtube_id,
  }
)
 What am I missing? Unfortunately, the YouTube API documentation for delete does not provide any examples, so I've got nothing to compare against. Please let me know if there is further information that I can provide to make my question clearer.

@TITLE:Unable to cross-compile to SPARC using clang
@CONTENT:So here's the situation: I need to be able to compile binaries from a Linux machine (on Ubuntu, for what it's worth) which are able to run from a SPARC server. The program I'm trying to compile is very simple: #include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    printf("Testing the SPARC program...");
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
 I've tried a number of different compile lines to get it to work, but unfortunately nothing appears to be working. I tried the traditional:  clang -target sparc blah.c -o blahsparc
 But this doesn't work, with a bunch of assembler failures:  /tmp/blah-519e77.s: Assembler messages:
 /tmp/blah-519e77.s:7: Error: unknown pseudo-op: '.register'

 ...
 clang: error: assembler (via gcc) command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
 I've tried this also: clang -cc1 -triple "sparc-unknown-Linux" blah.c -o blahsparc
 which complains about the missing headers, so instead of using -cc1, I use -Xclang: clang -Xclang -triple -Xclang "sparc-unknown-Linux" blah.c -o blahsparc
 however, this also fails due to "error: unknown target CPU 'x86-64'". I'm not sure where to proceed with this. I've tried using crosstool-ng as well with very little success.

@LINK:/questions/19106976/technique-for-extending-a-class-with-private-constructors
@TITLE:Technique for extending a class with private constructors
@CONTENT:Is there a standard technique to "extend" a class with private constructors, as with most Singleton classes? Specifcally, I'm trying to extend the java.lang.management.ThreadInfo class because I'm adding a LOT of them to a HashSet to control uniqueness. However, the way I determine if two threads are equal is different and not identical to the default implementation of the equals() method. Extending the class is obviously not an option in this case. Would it be reasonable to make something like a wrapper class which accepts a ThreadInfo in the constructor and then manually populates all relevant fields with the values, then overrides equals() and hashCode(), or is there a better way to do this? Something like this is what I'm starting to write, but a better implementation would be ideal: class ThreadInfoWrapper {

    private ThreadInfo info;
    ThreadInfoWrapper(ThreadInfo info) {
        this.info = info;
    }

    //Populate instance variables with Thread.State, thread ID, etc.. with
    //Getters/setters and all that other stuff

    public boolean equals(Object o) { //Unique implementation
    }

    public int hashCode() { //Whatever implementation
    }

}
 But this feels like a very roundabout way to achieve some basic functionality. I looked into it, and implementations of Sets with custom Comparators do not exist in the Java standard library. I suppose I could write my own hash set implementation but that's too much work for a simple situation. Any insights would be helpful.
@CODE:java.lang.management.ThreadInfo HashSet equals() ThreadInfo equals() hashCode() class ThreadInfoWrapper {

    private ThreadInfo info;
    ThreadInfoWrapper(ThreadInfo info) {
        this.info = info;
    }

    //Populate instance variables with Thread.State, thread ID, etc.. with
    //Getters/setters and all that other stuff

    public boolean equals(Object o) { //Unique implementation
    }

    public int hashCode() { //Whatever implementation
    }

@TITLE:Can static_cast to same type introduce runtime overhead?
@CONTENT:I have a structure template that takes two types (T and S), and at some point uses a static_cast to convert from one type to the other. It is often the case that T and S are the same type. A simplified example of the setup: template <typename T, typename S = T>
struct foo
{
  void bar(T val)
  {
    /* ... */
    some_other_function(static_cast<S>(val));

 In the case that S is the same class as T, does or can the static_cast introduce extra overhead, or is it a null operation which will always be ignored? If it does introduce overhead, is there a simple template metaprogramming trick to perform the static_cast only if needed, or will I need to create a partial specialization to cope with the T == S case? I'd rather avoid the partial specialization of the entire foo template if possible.
@CODE:T S static_cast T S template <typename T, typename S = T>
struct foo

@LINK:/questions/19099615/why-initializer-list-cannot-be-mains-parameter-how-to-propose-it
@TITLE:why initializer list cannot be main's parameter? how to propose it?
@CONTENT:The valid C++ main signatures are the following: int main()
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
int main(int argc, char **argv)
 But isn't allowed to declare main taking an initializer list: int main(std::initializer_list<char *> args)
 AFAIK the initializer list could be implemented as a pair of pointers or a pointer (this could be the argv parameter) plus a length (this could be deduced from the argc parameter), and its storage could be automatic, temporary, or static read-only memory depending on the situation. So i think that an std::initializer_list<char *> could handle and manage without any problem the command line parameters, then i'm wondering why this hypothetical main signature wasn't added after the approval of the initializer lists on the C++11 standard, and because of that i'm asking: What could be the disadvantages or problems derived of allowing an initializer list as the main only parameter? (i couldn't think of any). Which would be the correct way to propose to the standards committee this addition (or any other change)?
@CODE:main int main()
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
int main(int argc, char **argv) main int main(std::initializer_list<char *> args) argv argc std::initializer_list<char *> main main _tmain( int argc, wchar_t *argv[])

@TITLE:setWindowFlags(Qt::WindowStaysOnTopHint) hides Qt Window
@CONTENT:I want to make my Qt Window stay on top. When setWindowFlags(Qt::WindowStaysOnTopHint) is executed, the window becomes hidden (on Windows 7). I've also tried: Qt::WindowFlags flags = windowFlags();
setWindowFlags(flags | Qt::WindowStaysOnTopHint);
 And, it still does the same. What did I do wrong here?

@TITLE:hooks versus middleware in slim 2.0
@CONTENT:Can anyone explain if there are any significant advantages or disadvantages when choosing to implement features such as authentication or caching etc using hooks as opposed to using middleware? For instance - I can implement a translation feature by obtaining the request object through custom middleware and setting an app language variable that can be used to load the correct translation file when the app executes. Or I can add a hook before the routing and read the request variable and then load the correct file during the app execution. Is there any obvious reason I am missing that makes one choice better than the other?

@TITLE:What does [^.]* mean in regular expression?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to get 482.75 from the following text: <span id="yfs_l84_aapl">482.75</span> The regex I used is: regex = '<span id="yfs_l84_[^.]*">(.+?)</span>' and it worked. But the thing that I do not understand is why [^.]* can match aapl here? My understanding is that . means any character except a newline; and ^ means negator. So [^.] should be newline and [^.]* should be any number of new lines. However this theory is contrary to real world implementation. Any help is appreciated and thanks in advance. The python code I used: import urllib
import re 
htmlfile = urllib.urlopen("http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=AAPL&ql=0")
htmltext = htmlfile.read()
regex = '<span id="yfs_l84_[^.]*">(.+?)</span>'

price = re.findall(pattern, htmltext)
print "the price of of aapl is", price[0]

@TITLE:What has happened to MultiBinding between .NET 3.5 and .NET 4.5?
@CONTENT:We are currently in the process of converting a project from version 3.5 to version 4.5 of .NET. We set a text box IsEnabled flagged using a multi binding with a multi binding converter. Each of the bindings has their own converter. All worked well in .NET 3.5 but in .NET 4.5 the target type that is passed to the child converter is of type object instead of bool. Is this a known issue? has MS refactored the multi binding to not pass the target type to child converters. I created a simplified project that demonstrates the issue. I created the project in VS2008 and then converted it to VS2012 and .NET 4.5. Window XAML: <Window x:Class="TestMultiBinding.Window1"

Based on the definition it Minimize a function using the downhill simplex algorithm. But right now I can not find to write the above-mentioned Matlab code using this function
@CODE:banana = @(x)100*(x(2)-x(1)^2)^2+(1-x(1))^2;
[x,fval] = fminsearch(banana,[-1.2, 1]) x = 1.0000    1.0000

@TITLE:Nexus 7, Android 4.3: Same directory, two canonical paths
@CONTENT:I'm using a Nexus 7 running Android 4.3. Two directory paths on this device are confusing me: /storage/emulated/legacy
/storage/emulated/0
 If I call new File(<path>).getCanonicalPath() for either of these, I get the same path back. If I call the C function realpath with either, it succeeds and returns the same path. So it sounds like each of these is its own canonical path, and therefore they are different directories. However, If I create a subdirectory in either one, that subdirectory also appears in the other. That gives me the impression that they are two paths to the same directory. Is there a better way to tell that these paths are really for the same directory?

@LINK:/questions/19055501/travis-ci-fails-on-symbol-lookup-error-works-fine-elsewhere
@TITLE:Travis-CI fails on symbol lookup error, works fine elsewhere
@CONTENT:I have a library (technically a Ruby extension) called NMatrix which is written in C and C++. It uses C++ templates to manage different types, e.g., Rational128 versus Rational64. It also has RubyObject and Complex64 and Complex128. I force these template versions to be built by creating some inside an object file -- in a function that is called from the library entry point. It works just fine in GCC 4.7, but when I compile on Travis-CI, it encounters an undefined symbol error at run-time: exposes cblas rot /home/travis/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-p247/bin/ruby: symbol lookup error: /home/travis/build/SciRuby/nmatrix/lib/nmatrix.so: undefined symbol: _ZN2nm7ComplexIfEC1ERKNS_10RubyObjectE
 The undefined symbol is nm::Complex::Complex(nm::RubyObject const&), which is explicitly defined and instantiated (see below). Here's a pared down version of data.cpp: #include "data.h"

void nm_init_data() { // called from library entry point
  // These force the compiler to build these versions of the typedef'd templates.
  // I think this is a gross way to do it, but can't find a better idea.
  nm::RubyObject obj(INT2FIX(1));
  nm::Rational32 x(obj);
  nm::Rational64 y(obj);
  nm::Rational128 z(obj);
  nm::Complex64 a(obj);    // Clear instantiation of the undefined symbol
  nm::Complex128 b(obj);
}
 and data.h like so: #include "nmatrix.h"

#include "complex.h" // classes are all declared in headers
#include "rational.h"
#include "ruby_object.h"

void nm_init_data();
 nmatrix.cpp is where the library entry point is declared. The relevant parts look like this: void Init_nmatrix() {
  // declarations of Ruby-exposed functions here, e.g., 
  rb_define_method(cNMatrix, "initialize", (METHOD)nmatrix_constructor, -1);

  nm_init_data();
}
 So what am I doing wrong? Why does this work on GCC 4.7.1 (all specs pass), but not 4.6.3? Is it a bug? (If it's a bug, is there a work-around?) If you're curious, the full versions of the relevant files are here.

@TITLE:Are locals destroyed before or after evaluation of a function return value?
@CONTENT:I am thinking of making a class which represents ownership of a synchronization primitive, something like this: class CCriticalSectionLock
{
public:
    CCriticalSectionLock( CCriticalSection &cs ) : cs( cs )
    { cs.Enter(); }
    ~CCriticalSectionLock()
    { cs.Leave(); }
private:
    CCriticalSection &cs;
};
 This looks like a good way to be able to take ownership during a function and ensure ownership is released even if there are multiple exit points or exceptions. It does, however, raise some subtle issues about exactly when the compiler will have various things evaluated. Consider the following use: int MyMethod( void )
{
    not_locked(); // do something not under lock

    CCriticalSectionLock myLock( someCriticalSection );

    locked(); // do something under lock

    return ...; // some expression
}
 AFAIK, C++ lifetime rules would guarantee that not_locked() would be called before the lock is taken, and that locked() would be called while the lock is held. However, what I am not so clear on is exactly when the expression being returned would be evaluated with respect to the point at which the lock destructor is called. Is it guaranteed that the expression will be evaluated before the destructor? I would think so but I'm not 100% sure, and if not it could lead to very subtle, intermittent, hard-to-find bugs!
@CODE:class CCriticalSectionLock
{
public:
    CCriticalSectionLock( CCriticalSection &cs ) : cs( cs )
    { cs.Enter(); }
    ~CCriticalSectionLock()
    { cs.Leave(); }
private:
    CCriticalSection &cs;

{
    not_locked(); // do something not under lock

    CCriticalSectionLock myLock( someCriticalSection );

A_unique = DISTINCT A;

 In facebook sdk documentation it is stated that: FacebookDialog.getNativeDialogCompletionGesture - Only available if the user logged into your app using Facebook and did complete is true. Value is either "post" or "cancel". But I can not understand what exactly do they mean by this phrase.
@CODE:FacebookDialog.getNativeDialogCompletionGesture onActivityResult() private void sendToFacebook()

        if (!FacebookDialog.canPresentShareDialog(getActivity().getApplicationContext(),        FacebookDialog.ShareDialogFeature.SHARE_DIALOG))

@LINK:/questions/18994479/ios-7-simulator-bug-nsattributedstring-does-not-appear
@TITLE:iOS 7 Simulator Bug - NSAttributedString does not appear
@CONTENT:UPDATE: I have just encountered this issue on an actual iPhone 5 running iOS 7. Will provide more information soon. I think I have found a bug in the iOS 7 Simulator where a NSAttributedString does not appear. It would be great if someone else could test this to confirm it is a bug, then I will file a bug with Apple. The problem appears to be the combination of using NSUnderlineStyleAttributeName and NSParagraphStyleAttributeName for NSAttributedString. Here are the steps to reproduce: 1) In Xcode 5 create a new 'Single View Application'. Call it whatever. 2) In ViewController.m, replace the viewDidLoad method with: - (void)viewDidLoad
{
    [super viewDidLoad];

    NSMutableParagraphStyle* paragraph = [[NSMutableParagraphStyle alloc] init];
    paragraph.alignment = NSTextAlignmentCenter;

    NSAttributedString* attrStr = [[NSAttributedString alloc] initWithString:@"Lorem ipsum dolor sit" attributes:
                                   @{NSUnderlineStyleAttributeName:@1,
                                     NSParagraphStyleAttributeName:paragraph}];

    UILabel* myLabel = [[UILabel alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(10, 30, 0, 0)];
    myLabel.backgroundColor = [UIColor greenColor];
    myLabel.attributedText = attrStr;
    [myLabel sizeToFit];

    [self.view addSubview:myLabel];
}
 3) Run on an iOS 7 device and then run it again in the iOS 7 simulator. 4) Lastly, set the deployment target to iOS 6 and run it on the iOS 6 simulator. The results should be the following iOS 7 Device: Displays correctly iOS 7 Simulator: Only displays label background iOS 6 Simulator: Displays correctly Screenshots: iOS7 Device iOS7 Simulator
@CODE:- (void)viewDidLoad
{
    [super viewDidLoad];

    NSMutableParagraphStyle* paragraph = [[NSMutableParagraphStyle alloc] init];
    paragraph.alignment = NSTextAlignmentCenter;

    NSAttributedString* attrStr = [[NSAttributedString alloc] initWithString:@"Lorem ipsum dolor sit" attributes:
                                   @{NSUnderlineStyleAttributeName:@1,
                                     NSParagraphStyleAttributeName:paragraph}];

    UILabel* myLabel = [[UILabel alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(10, 30, 0, 0)];
    myLabel.backgroundColor = [UIColor greenColor];
    myLabel.attributedText = attrStr;
    [myLabel sizeToFit];

@TITLE:How to convert binary string to the byte array of 2 bytes in java
@CONTENT:I have binary string String A = "1000000110101110". I want to convert this string into byte array of length 2 in java I have taken the help of this link I have tried to convert it into byte by various ways I have converted that string into decimal first and then apply the code to store into the byte array         int aInt = Integer.parseInt(A, 2);
                byte[] xByte = new byte[2];
            xByte[0] = (byte) ((aInt >> 8) & 0XFF);
            xByte[1] = (byte) (aInt & 0XFF);
            System.arraycopy(xByte, 0, record, 0,
                    xByte.length);
 But the values get store into the byte array are negative             xByte[0] :-127
            xByte[1] :-82
 Which are wrong values. 2.I have also tried using   byte[] xByte = ByteBuffer.allocate(2).order(ByteOrder.BIG_ENDIAN).putInt(aInt).array();
 But it throws the exception at the above line like       java.nio.Buffer.nextPutIndex(Buffer.java:519)     at
      java.nio.HeapByteBuffer.putInt(HeapByteBuffer.java:366)   at
      org.com.app.convert.generateTemplate(convert.java:266)
 What should i do now to convert the binary string to byte array of 2 bytes?Is there any inbuilt function in java to get the byte array

@TITLE:How to avoid memory leak with shared_ptr and SWIG
@CONTENT:I'm trying to use boost::shared_ptr's to allow for me to use c++ file I/O stream objects in my python script. However, the generated wrapper warns me that it is leaking memory. Here's a minimal .i file exhibiting the problem: %module ptrtest

%include "boost_shared_ptr.i"
%include "std_string.i"

%shared_ptr( std::ofstream )

%{
#include <fstream>
#include <boost/shared_ptr.hpp>

typedef boost::shared_ptr< std::ofstream > ofstream_ptr;

ofstream_ptr mk_out(const std::string& fname ){
    return ofstream_ptr( new std::ofstream( fname.c_str() ) );
}

%}

ofstream_ptr mk_out(const std::string& fname );


%pythoncode %{

    ''' demonstration function -- when I call
        this, I get a warning about memory leaks
    ''''
    ostr=mk_out('/tmp/dont_do_this.txt')


%}
 Here's the warning: In [2]: ptrtest.leak_memory()
swig/python detected a memory leak of type 'ofstream_ptr *', no destructor found.
 Is there a way to modify the .i file to tell the interface how to dispose of the shared_ptr properly?

@LINK:/questions/18877536/can-a-jsp-template-be-used-from-within-java
@TITLE:Can a JSP template be used from within Java?
@CONTENT:I'm pretty new to JSP. So far it seems that the flow of processing is very much Java runs first, then populates a JSP template. I am wondering if there is a way from within Java to utilize a JSP template. What I mean is, imagine I had a simple "SimpleDiv.jsp" template on classpath like this: <div id="${id}" class="${class}">
    ${content}
</div>
 And then from within an arbitrary Java file (perhaps not even running on a servlet), I could do something like this: private String getDivHtml( id, html ) {
    Template simpleDiv = TemplateLoader.load("SimpleDiv.jsp");
    simpleDiv.set("id", id);
    simpleDiv.set("class", Whatever.CLASS_NAME);
    simpleDiv.set("content", html);

    return simpleDiv.toString();
}
 This is a pretty simplistic example so don't get caught up on the details of that. Main question is -- can I pull in a JSP template in Java and cause it to generate HTML inline?
@CODE:<div id="${id}" class="${class}">
    ${content}
</div> private String getDivHtml( id, html ) {
    Template simpleDiv = TemplateLoader.load("SimpleDiv.jsp");
    simpleDiv.set("id", id);
    simpleDiv.set("class", Whatever.CLASS_NAME);
    simpleDiv.set("content", html);

    return simpleDiv.toString();

@TITLE:Compiler bug, or non standard code? - Variadic template capture in lambda
@CONTENT:I have the following C++11 code; template<typename... T>
int g(T... t)
{
    return 0;
}

template<class... Args>
void f(Args... args)
{
    auto lm = [&, args...] { return g(args...); };
    lm();
}

int main()
{
    f(2, 5, 7);
}
 I do believe that it's valid C++11, according to; Section 5.1.2.23 of the standard; A capture followed by an ellipsis is a pack expansion (14.5.3). [ Example: template<class... Args> void f(Args... args) {
    auto lm = [&, args...] { return g(args...); }; lm();
}
 ¡X end example ] However while Clang++ compiles fine, G++ provides this error; main.cpp: In function 'void f(Args ...)':
main.cpp:10:23: error: expected ',' before '...' token
     auto lm = [&, args...] { return g(args...); };
                   ^
main.cpp:10:23: error: expected identifier before '...' token
main.cpp:10:26: error: parameter packs not expanded with '...':

main.cpp: In lambda function:

@TITLE:Missing parameters with RESTful request when upgrading to Grails 2.3.0
@CONTENT:I am using Grails with RESTful to develop my web application. Everything works fine, till I upgrade my application to Grails 2.3. Here is my UrlMappings: I still send request, submit or do some other things normally, but in POST, PUT requests, the parameters are missing. Server just recognize only the parameters I put on the URL directly, but the remain I enclose in form or model when submit cannot be found in the "params" variable. He is my UrlMappings: class UrlMappings {

    static mappings = {
        "/$controller/$action?/$id?"{ constraints {} }

        name apiSingle: "/api/$controller/$id"(parseRequest:true){
            action = [GET: "show", PUT: "update", DELETE: "delete"]
            constraints { id(matches:/\d+/) }
        }
        name apiCollection: "/api/$controller"(parseRequest:true){

        "/"(view:"/welcome")

    }
}
 I have read the latest document of Grails 2.3, at http://grails.org/doc/latest/guide/theWebLayer.html#restfulMappings but I think it is not clear. I have tried it follow the documentation but have no result. And there are no any sample about using Grails 2.3 with RESTful for me to refer. How can I make it work normally as before, and can access all parameter values in REST request? Thank you so much!

@LINK:/questions/18859284/mongoose-custom-schema-types
@TITLE:mongoose custom schema types
@CONTENT:I read from mongoose documentation that it is possible to create custom schema types to be added to the ones already existing. As suggested I tried to look into the mongoose-long example: https://github.com/aheckmann/mongoose-long I need this in an application I am developing in which I have a profile that is a mongoose model. The profile has several fields such as name, surname and so on that are MultiValueField. A MultiValueField is on object with the following structure: {
    current : <string>
    providers : <Array>
    values : {
         provider1 : value1,
         provider2 : value2
    }
}
 The structure above has a list of allowed providers (ordered by priorities) from which the field's value can be retrieved. The current property keeps track of which provider is currently picked to use as value of the field. Finally the object values contains the values for each provider. I have defined an object in node.js, whose constructor takes the structure above as argument and provides a lot of useful methods to set a new providers, adding values and so on. Each field of my profile should be initialized with a different list of providers, but I haven't found a way yet to do so. If I define MultiValueField as an Embedded Schema, I can do so only having each field as Array. Also I cannot initialize every field at the moment a profile is created with the list of providers. I think the best solution is to define a SchemaType MultiValueFieldType, that has a cast function that returns a MultiValueField object. However, how can I define such a custom schema type? And how can I use custom options when defining it in the schema of the profile? I already posted a question on mongoose Google group to ask how to create Custom Schema Types: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/mongoose-orm/fCpxtKSXFKc
@CODE:name surname MultiValueField MultiValueField {
    current : <string>

@TITLE:Java faster than C [duplicate]
@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: How do I write a correct micro-benchmark in Java? 10 answers Today I made a simple test to compare the speed between java and c - a simple loop that makes an integer "i" increment from 0 to two billion. I really expected c-language to be faster than java. I was surprised of the outcome: the time it takes in seconds for java: approx. 1.8 seconds the time it takes in seconds for c: approx. 3.6 seconds. I DO NOT think that java is a faster language at all, but I DO NOT either understand why the loop is twice as fast as c in my simple programs? Did I made a crucial misstake in the program? Or is the compiler of MinGW badly configurated or something? public class Jrand {

 public static void main (String[] args) {

    long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();

@CONTENT:TLDR: If X exists as a remote branch, then git checkout X should create a local branch of it. In my case, for a single branch, it does not. The remote repository has a master, release, and some other branches (say refactor-update) I do: git clone WHATEVER/repo.git git checkout release But I do not get the normal branch switch message, nor is a local branch tracking origin/release created (per the man page for git checkout). I am still on master. Note that if I do git checkout refactor-update everything works as expected. This is reproducible on other computers (though the same platform and likely the same version of git). I have (out of desperation, not because I thought it would work), removed the release branch and replaced it with a backup and master respectively with no change in behaviour (git push origin :release && git push origin master:release) I am stuck for what might be causing the problem. My suspicion is that git checkout doesn't seem to recognize the word release for some reason, which would make it much like executing just git checkout. To try and follow up on this, in another repo I created a release branch to see if it was a reserved word or something, but it is definitely just in this repository. There doesn't seem to be anything out of the ordinary in .git/config. Git version: 1.8
@CODE:git checkout X master, release, refactor-update git clone WHATEVER/repo.git git checkout release origin/release man git checkout master. git checkout refactor-update release master git push origin :release && git push origin master:release git checkout release git checkout .git/config git fetch --prune git checkout X git fetch --prune -p --prune fetch = --prune fetch.

@LINK:/questions/18832307/external-appsettings-file-not-merging-with-web-config
@TITLE:External AppSettings File NOT merging with web.config
@CONTENT:In my app, I have a web.config file with an appSettings section. The appSettings section contains a number of keys that the app uses. The appSettings section also contains the file="AppSettings.config" attribute. The AppSettings.config file then contains a subset of the values from the main web.config. The idea is for the web.config to contain all the base/default settings, and then to provide overrides of the defaults in the AppSettings.config file. According to this post (http://stackoverflow.com/a/6940086/216160), my setup ought to work (particularly : will merge (and override) settings in the .config file). The problem I'm seeing is that its not working. I have a default value of false, which then drives some logic about displaying some beta reporting functionality (or not), and have set the AppSettings.config to override this key to 'true'. Sadly, it continues to hide the report system. But, if I change the web.config value, then the item displays. Is it possible that the AppSettings are not getting merged? How can I test/prove what's really happening? EDIT It appears that there was some kind of error in the AppSettings.config file. When all is working as it should, the merge happeded exactly as expected. However, I still have the issue of how to detect when the AppSettings.config file has some kind of issue. I'd tested to see if the file was valid XML (and it was), but yet, some issue remained. When I copied the functioning key from web.config, and pasted it right below the non-working key from AppSettings.config, they appeared to be identical. I expect there must be some way to throw an error in the event of a config file merge error?

@TITLE:Check if url leads to a file or a page
@CONTENT:We need the following: Download a file from an URL if it is actually a file. Otherwise if its a page do nothing. For a quick example I've got the following to download a file:  My.Computer.Network.DownloadFile(

"d:\ff_googleinfrastructure_large.jpg")
 But if we got a normal web page for example "http://www.google.com" it will just download the page which is something we do not want. So how can i find out if an URL will lead to a file instead of a page? It could be any type of file so checking if the URL ends with .zip or .jpg or .docx or... simply won't do. Answers in VB.NET or C# are both welcome which is why i marked both.

@TITLE:Rails.root points to the wrong directory in production during a Resque job
@CONTENT:I have two jobs that are queued simulataneously and one worker runs them in succession. Both jobs copy some files from the builds/ directory in the root of my Rails project and place them into a temporary folder. The first job always succeeds, never have a problem - it doesn't matter which job runs first either. The first one will work. The second one receives this error when trying to copy the files: No such file or directory - /Users/apps/Sites/my-site/releases/20130829065128/builds/foo That releases folder is two weeks old and should not still be on the server. It is empty, housing only a public/uploads directory and nothing else. I have killed all of my workers and restarted them multiple times, and have redeployed the Rails app multiple times. When I delete that releases directory, it makes it again. I don't know what to do at this point. Why would this worker always create/look in this old releases directory? Why would only the second worker do this? I am getting the path by using: Rails.root.join('builds') - Rails.root is apparently a 2 week old capistrano release? I should also mention this only happens in the production environment. What can I do ?

@TITLE:Type Checking Array Contents with Closure-Compiler
@CONTENT:In Google Closure, if an Array of a specific @type {Array.<type>} is initialized, can I be sure that Google Closure will confirm the Array contents? Here is a small test case. It appears to me that an {Array.<string>} is sneaking past an {Array.<number>} check, although a {string} is correctly blocked by the same check. I am a little new to GC, is this an error on my part? I've pasted this to the Google Closure Service, and I'm showing only one of two expected errors (Sept 12 2013). I've double-tested this on my local jar file (newest, v20130823) with ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS and warning_level VERBOSE. It still looks like the {Array.<string>} sneaks by. Docs: Annotating for Google Closure Thanks in advance for your input. // ==ClosureCompiler==

 note: I've taken a close look at this related question, where the type of Array.push() was manually filled in. This question concerns initialization, though. If I take his corrected code and init all of his arrays with garbage data, as above, GC fails to catch the garbage in his case as well. Edited: added warning_level VERBOSE and language ECMASCRIPT5 to the header on the test case, just to be sure. {Array.<string>} still not detected.

@TITLE:Row_Number() in Access select statement
@CONTENT:I believe similar questions have been asked but I can't quite find a solution that works for me. I've got a database that I use to sort through digitised books and their pages and I'm trying to sort through several thousand pages that contain maps. Of the two tables I'm using the first lists all the pages in a book and the order they occur in the book, it's got three columns (bookID, pageOrder, pageID), each page has its own row. The second table lists all the places (in a map) that occur on each page, it has two columns (pageID, placeID) if there are multiple places on one page then a new row is added to the table for each place. What I need to do is create a select statement that gives every pageID/placeID combination a unique number but the numbers must go in the order they appear in the book. In SQL Server I would do this: SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY bp.bookID, bp.pageOrder, pp.placeID) AS uniqueNumber, pp.pageID, pp.placeID
FROM booksAndPages AS bp INNER JOIN pagesAndPlaces AS pp ON bp.pageID = pp.pageID
 Unfortunately, I'm stuck using Access. Ideally I'd like to do it (if possible) with a single SQL statement, similar to the one above but I would also try it using VBA. Any help is greatly appreciated.

@LINK:/questions/18732088/how-does-the-piggybacking-of-current-thread-variable-in-reentrantlock-sync-work
@TITLE:How does the piggybacking of current thread variable in ReentrantLock.Sync work?
@CONTENT:I read about some of the details of implementation of ReentrantLock in "Java Concurrency in Practice", section 14.6.1, and something in the annotation makes me confused: Because the protected state-manipulation methods have the memory semantics of a volatile read or write and ReentrantLock is careful to read the owner field only after calling getState and write it only before calling setState, ReentrantLock can piggyback on the memory semantics of the synchronization state, and thus avoid further synchronizationsee Section 16.1.4. the code which it refers to: protected boolean tryAcquire(int ignored) {
    final Thread current = Thread.currentThread();
    int c = getState();
    if (c ==0) {
        if (compareAndSetState(0, 1)) {
             owner = current;
             return true;
        }
     } else if (current == owner) {
         setState(c+1);
         return true;
     }
}
 And I believe this is the simplified code of the nonfirTryAcquire in the ReentrantLock.Sync. final boolean nonfairTryAcquire(int acquires) {
    final Thread current = Thread.currentThread();
    int c = getState();
    if (c == 0) {
        if (compareAndSetState(0, acquires)) {
            setExclusiveOwnerThread(current);
            return true;
        }
    }
    else if (current == getExclusiveOwnerThread()) {
        int nextc = c + acquires;
        if (nextc < 0) // overflow
            throw new Error("Maximum lock count exceeded");
        setState(nextc);
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}
 So, the baffling part is how the setting of owner, which is merely a plain instance variable in AbstractOwnableSynchronizer, becomes visible to else if (current == owner) in other threads. Indeed, the read of owner is after the calling of getState() (and the state is a volatile qualified variable of AQS), but after the setting of owner, there's nothing (can impose synchronization semantics) at all. Data race happens? Well, in light of the authority of this book and the thoroughly tested code, two possibilities come to my mind: The full barrier (be it mfence or 'lock'ed instruction) before the setting owner = current does the hidden work. But from I've learned from several famous articles, the full barrier cares more about the writes before it as well as the reads after it. Well, if this possibility holds true, then some sentences in "JCIP" might be inappropriately stated. I notice that 'geographically' the setState(c+1) really comes after owner = current in the code snippet, although it's in another branch of if-else. If what the comments says is the truth, does it mean that the barrier inserted by setSate(c+1) can impose synchronization semantics on owner = current in another branch? I'm a novice in this area, and several great blogs help me a lot in understanding what's underlying the JVM(no ordering): http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com/ http://preshing.com/ http://bartoszmilewski.com http://psy-lob-saw.blogspot.com/ as well as the always magnificent: http://g.oswego.edu/dl/jmm/cookbook.html After doing my homework and searching the internet, I fail to come to a satisfying conclusion. Pardon me if this is too wordy or unclear(English is not my mother tongue). Please help me with this, anything related is appreciated.

    final Thread current = Thread.currentThread();
    int c = getState();

@LINK:/questions/18721202/difference-between-higher-order-and-curried-functions
@TITLE:Difference between higher order and curried functions
@CONTENT:I'm reading a book, Functional Programming Using F#, which says (page 33), in the section Declaration of higher-order functions We have seen higher-order built-in functions like (+) and (<<) and at the end of the section Higher-order functions may alternatively be defined by supplying the arguments as follows in the let-declaration: let weight ro s = ro * s ** 3.0;;
 However there were some helpful comments at the bottom of a question that I asked earlier today (which was originally titled "When should I write my functions as higher order functions") that seem to throw some doubt on whether these examples are in fact higher-order functions. The wikipedia definition of higher-order function is: a higher-order function (also functional form, functional or functor) is a function that does at least one of the following: (i) take one or more functions as an input; (ii) output a function. On the one hand, I can see that functions like (+), and weight might be regarded as higher order functions because given a single argument they return a function. On the other hand I can see that they are properly regarded as curried functions. I'm learning F# as a self-study project and would like to get the concepts clear, so the answers and discussion on this site are particularly helpful. My question is, what is the right term for these functions, and, perhaps more importantly, how do people normally use the terms "higher order functions" and "curried functions"?

@TITLE:Sending JSON params with HTTPS request
@CONTENT:I need to call "HTTPS" api and pass JSON params with it to the server. Right now i am trying like this: HttpClient httpclient = new DefaultHttpClient();

            HttpPost httppost = new HttpPost("https://myapi call goes here...");
            httppost.setHeader("Content-Type", "application/json");

            try

                j.put("email", "my email value goes here");

                StringEntity s = new StringEntity(j.toString());

                httppost.setEntity(s);
                HttpResponse response = httpclient.execute(httppost);

                /* Checking response */
                if(response != null)

@TITLE:How to handle Symfony form collection with 500+ items
@CONTENT:I have form collection which need to handle more than 500 entity instances. After I increased timeout to 60s and increased max_input_vars form work but it is annoying how slow it is. Rendering form is slow but submitting that big form is pain in the ass. I was considering creating plain HTML form but there is some other drawback suck as validation. So, is there any proper way to handle that big set of data via symfony form ? CONTROLLER: public function ratesCardAction() {

    $em = $this->getDoctrine()->getManager();
    $form = $this->createForm(new AdvertiserRatesType($bannerList));
    if ('POST' == $this->getRequest()->getMethod()) {

            }
            $em->flush();
        }
    }

    return array(

So my question is, on an event where failure on the 2nd step, what is the correct http status code to return? should the response be 424?

 I want to keep one of the parameters to the gamma distribution as a variable (say the shape), and fix one of the parameters (say scale=1). However, if I keep the loc variable as zero, I am not able to fix the scale at one. Is there some workaround for this? Can I not parametrize the gamma distribution using only the shape and scale?

@LINK:/questions/18669197/c-does-casting-create-a-new-object
@TITLE:C++ Does casting create a new object?
@CONTENT:As indicated in the title above, my question is simply whether or not a C++ cast does create a new object of the target class. Of course, I have used Google, MSDN, IBM and stackoverflow's search tool before asking this but I can't find an appropriate answer to my question. Lets consider the following implementation of the diamond problem solved by using virtual inheritance: #include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>

struct A
{
  int a;

  A(): a(2) {  }
};

struct B: virtual public A
{
  int b;

  B(): b(7) {  }
};

struct C: virtual public A
{
  int c;

  C(): c(1) {  }
};

struct END: virtual public B, virtual public C
{
  int end;

  END(): end(8) {  }
};

int main()
{
  END *end = new END();
  A *a = dynamic_cast<A*>(end);
  B *b = dynamic_cast<B*>(end);
  C *c = dynamic_cast<C*>(end);

  std::cout << "Values of a:\na->a: " << a->a << "\n\n";
  std::cout << "Values of b:\nb->a: " << b->a << "\nb->b: " << b->b << "\n\n";
  std::cout << "Values of c:\nc->a: " << c->a << "\nc->c: " << c->c << "\n\n";

  std::cout << "Handle of end: " << end << "\n";
  std::cout << "Handle of a: " << a << "\n";
  std::cout << "Handle of b: " << b << "\n";
  std::cout << "Handle of c: " << c << "\n\n";
  system("PAUSE");
  return 0;
}
 As I understood, the actual structure of B and C, which normally consists of both an embedded instance of A and variables of B resp. C, is destroyed since the virtual A of B and C is merged to one embedded object in END to avoid ambiguities. Since (as I always thought) dynamic_cast usually only increases the address stored by a pointer by the offset of the embedded (cast's) target class there will be a problem due to the fact that the target (B or C) class is divided into several parts. But if I run the example with MSVC++ 2011 Express everything will happen as expected (i.e. it will run, all *.a output 2), the pointers only slightly differ. Therefor, I suspect that the casts nevertheless only move the addresses of the source pointers by the internal offset of B's / C's instance. But how? How does the resulting instance of B / C know the position of the shared A object. Since there is only one A object inside the END object but normally an A object in B and C, either B or C must not have an instance of A, but, indeed, both seem to have an instance of it. Or does virtual only delegate calls to A's members to a central A object without deleting the respective A objects of each base class which inherits virtual from A (i.e. does virtual actually not destroy the internal structure of inherited and therefor embedded objects but only not using their virtualized (= shared) members)? Or does virtual create a new "offset map" (i.e. the map which tells the address offsets of all members relative to the pointer to a class instance, I dunno the actual term) for such casted objects to handle their "distributedness"? I hope I have clarified everything, many thanks in advance BlueBlobb PS: I'm sorry if there are some grammar mistakes, I'm only a beer loving Bavarian, not a native speaker :P Edit: If have added these lines to output the addresses of all int a's:   std::cout << "Handle of end.a: " << &end->a << "\n";
  std::cout << "Handle of a.a: " << &a->a << "\n";
  std::cout << "Handle of a.b: " << &b->a << "\n";
  std::cout << "Handle of a.c: " << &c->a << "\n\n";
 They are the same implying that there is indeed only one A object.

@TITLE:Cast one object to another
@CONTENT:I have got two user defined CLR objects which are identical and only differ in name, for example this code: public class Person
{
  public string Name { get; set; }
  public string Address { get; set; }
  public string LastName { get; set; }
  public string ETC { get; set; }
}

public class PersonData
{
  public string Name { get; set; }
  public string Address { get; set; }
  public string LastName { get; set; }
  public string ETC { get; set; }
}
 I know that this can be done by creating an object from either of these CLR's and than pass all properties one by one to it. But is there another way? I got a few CLR's that are pretty big, 15+ properties. [Edit] Some more context. The classes where already there. I generated a model from the database using EntityFramework. The database has almost the exact same structure as the classes. Also, it's a lot of code that was already there. These classes also inherit from several interfaces etc. Refactoring now is not an option, so i'm looking for an easy fix for now.
@CODE:public class Person
{
  public string Name { get; set; }
  public string Address { get; set; }
  public string LastName { get; set; }

@TITLE:Laravel Blade Templates Section Repeated / cache error
@CONTENT:I am looking to Bootstrap my site and as such, have put common twitter bootstrap components into blade templates. sidebar.blade.php @include('panel1')

    <div class="panel-heading">

 This way, every time I wish to use a panel, then I can use @extends('panelTemplate'). panel1.blade.php @extends('panelTemplate')

@section('title')

@section('body')

 The problem that I am facing is that instead of showing the contents of panel1.blade.php, then the contents of panel2.blade.php as declared in sidebar.blade.php the contents of panel1.blade.php is being repeated (shown twice). Is Blade caching the request which is why panel1 is being repeated twice? Is there a way to override this behaviour or am I using the blade templating engine in a way which it was never intended?

@CONTENT:I want to have a fragment for each item in a listview, because I want to separate some logic out. I am using a view holder for each item. If the view doesn't exist, I create a new fragment and add it into the container. holder.mMyFragment = new MyFragment(mActivity, this);
mActivity.getSupportFragmentManager().beginTransaction().add(R.id.my_container, holder.mMyFragment).commit();
 Also for each item, I call holder.mMyFragment.setUi(dataSource, position) to set UI of the fragment based on the data source and position. The problem I'm having is I initialize the UI elements of fragment in onCreateView method of the fragment class, but it's not called when I add the fragment to the item. So later when I call setUi() which uses some UI elements in fragment it complains a NullPointerException. Does anyone have a suggestion? Thanks!
@CODE:holder.mMyFragment = new MyFragment(mActivity, this);
mActivity.getSupportFragmentManager().beginTransaction().add(R.id.my_container, holder.mMyFragment).commit();

@TITLE:Can macro expansion contain (declare ¡K) expressions?
@CONTENT:The Common Lisp Hyperspec states "Macro forms cannot expand into declarations; declare expressions must appear as actual subexpressions of the form to which they refer." I'm confused on the meaning of "expand into". A macro such as the following won't work for obvious reasons: (defmacro optimize-fully ()
    `(declare (optimize (speed 3) (safety 0))))
 But what if the macro expansion merely contains a (declare ...) expression? (defmacro defun-optimized (name (&rest lambda-list) &rest body)
    `(defun ,name ,lambda-list
        (declare (optimize (speed 3) (safety 0)))
        ,@body))

(defun-optimized foobar (a b)
    (* a b))
 Is this a violation of the spec? The CL implementation I use, SBCL, does not complain, and in fact, the macro above seems to work precisely as expected. What gives?
@CODE:(defmacro optimize-fully ()
    `(declare (optimize (speed 3) (safety 0)))) (declare ...) (defmacro defun-optimized (name (&rest lambda-list) &rest body)
    `(defun ,name ,lambda-list
        (declare (optimize (speed 3) (safety 0)))
        ,@body))

(defun-optimized foobar (a b)
    (* a b))

@TITLE:How to properly handle thread interrupts
@CONTENT:I am working on an application that at some point starts a worker thread. This thread's behaviour will vary greatly depending on the parameters used to start it, but the following list of properties apply: It will do some minor I/O operations It will spend minor time in 3rd party libraries It may create some worker threads for a certain subtask (these threads will not be reused after their task is finished) It will spend most of its time crunching numbers (there are no blocking calls present) Due to the possible long duration (5 minutes up to several hours, depending on the input), we want to be able to abort the calculation. If we choose to abort it, we no longer care about the output, and the thread is in fact wasting valuable resources as long as it keeps running. Since the code is under our control, the advised way is to use interrupts to indicate an abort. While most examples on the web deal with a worker thread that is looping over some method, this is not the case for me (similar question here). There are also very few blocking calls in this work thread, in which case this article advises to manually check the interrupt flag. My question is: How to deal with this interrupt? I see several options, but can't decide which is the most "clean" approach. Despite my practical example, I'm mainly interested in the "best practice" on how to deal with this. Throw some kind of unchecked exception: this would kill the thread in a quick and easy way, but it reminds me of the ThreadDeath approach used by the deprecated Thread#stop() method, with all its related problems. I can see this approach being acceptable in owned code (due to the known logic flow), but not in library code. Throw some kind of checked exception: this would kill the thread in a quick and easy way, and alleviates the ThreadDeath-like problems by enforcing programmers to deal with this event. However, it places a big burden on the code, requiring the exception to be mentioned everywhere. There is a reason not everything throws an InterruptedException. Exit the methods with a "best result so far" or empty result. Because of the amount of classes involved, this will be a very hard task. If not enough care is taken, NullPointerExceptions might arise from empty results, leading to the same problems as point 1. Finding these causes would be next to impossible in large code bases.

 I'm trying to calculate the moving maximum slope over 7 days beginning on 4 November of each year without using a loop. This moving maximum slope needs to account for WinterID, SiteID, and SubstrateConcat. For clarification, the calculation I'm trying to obtain is this: Slope=(max-min)/7, where:
Max= (i-3)+(i-2)+(i-1)+i+(i+1)+(i+2)+(i+3) 
Min= (i-3)

(((i-3)+(i-2)+(i-1)+i+(i+1)+(i+2)+(i+3)) - (i-3))/7
 So, using a real example starting with 2002-11-19 as i: (0+0.24+7.13+10.61+2.97+0+0.97) - 0)/7 = 3.13
 I tried using zoo package rollmean, however, I could not figure out how to account for WinterID, SiteID, and SubstrateConcat. This gave me an "order.by" error where my Date values were not unique, since I have dates with different SubstrateConcat and WinterID criteria. As I enter more data into the database, there will eventually be dates with multiple SiteID criteria as well. I thought maybe xts, TTR and ROC would be what I could use as in this question: Maximum slope for a given interval each day. But again, I don't understand how to specify the multiple group factors, as well as going three days forward and three days back as in align=center with rollmean. Will someone please point me in the right direction here? Will one of the above functions combined with ddply work? Thank you! EDITED to include the answer after the answer supplied by @eddi. dt <- data.table(df)
dt[, MaxSlope := if(length(HDD)<7) {rep(NA_real_, length(HDD))} else {filter(HDD, c(1,1,1,1,1,1,0)/7)}, by=list(Winter, Site, Substrate)]
 This code works perfectly for dates that are continuous. Can anyone recommend how to tweak this code for data that has missing dates? For instance, I have:    Date  Temp 
 Nov 21  14 
 Nov 23  10 
 Nov 24  12 
 Nov 27  11 
 Nov 28  7 
 Nov 29  9 
 Nov 30  10 
 Dec 01  12 
 Dec 02  8  
 Dec 03  7
 I don't want the Max Slope calculated for Nov 21, Nov 23 and Nov 24 because there isn't consecutive data for the calculation. Instead, I want "NA" inserted. Can the existing code above, be modified to accommodate this?

@TITLE:Checked exceptions in visitors
@CONTENT:I am learning ANTLR4 and I have no previous experience with parser generators. When I define my own visitor implementation, I have to override methods of the BaseVisitor (I am looking for instance at the EvalVisitor class at page 40 of the book). In case my method implementation possibly throws an exception, what should I do? I cannot use a checked exception since the original method has an empty throws clause. Am I expected to use unchecked exceptions? (this seems a bad Java design). For instance, assume that in the EvalVisitor class I want method visitId (page 41) to throw a user-defined exception, say UndefinedId, rather than returning 0. How should I write my code?

@TITLE:Using position:absolute while keeping it inside the document flow
@CONTENT:It's a screenshot from a page currently I'm building. I'm trying to make sure the green button is always on the bottom of the container. Here is a piece of the code: HTML <div class="list-product-pat">
  <article>

   <!-- title, image, spec ... -->

   <div class="pricing-pat">

     <!-- the button goes here -->

   </div>
  </article>

 }

 .list-product-pat .pricing-pat {
    position: absolute;
    bottom: 0;
    width: 100%;
 }
 So far there is no problem... until the product spec gets too long and it breaks into the green button. I want to maintain the green button in the most bottom position, but in the same time I also want the height to extend if the product title/product spec gets too long. In the ideal world, it should be something like this: So my idea is to maintain the absolute positioning while still keeping it inside the document flow (so the product spec knows the green button is there and doesn't break through it). I need it only to extend if the spec height gets too long. In other words, if the spec is in normal height, it wouldn't extent. I'd like to avoid a weird gap between the spec and the green button. Is there any idea how to do it? Here is a fiddle to see how I did it: http://jsfiddle.net/xaliber/xrb5U/
@CODE:<div class="list-product-pat">
  <article>

   <!-- title, image, spec ... -->

@CONTENT:I'm using Laravel 4 and have loaded hybridauth via composer and got it working just fine with Facebook and Twitter. Now i'm trying to get it working with Steam, which is listed as an additional provider, however I keep getting the following error: require_once(vendor/hybridauth/hybridauth/hybridauth/Hybrid/Providers/Steam.php) [function.require-once]: failed to open stream: No such file or directory Clearly it's looking in the wrong place, the actual class resides in this location: vendor/hybridauth/hybridauth/additional-providers/hybridauth-steam/Providers/Steam.php There's very little documentation that I can find on this, my only guess is that the author of hybridauth only offered these additional providers as optional extras and expects you to move the location of the class to the proper place, however with composer this isn't the way to do things and will cause problems anytime I run composer update. I can't find anyone having a similar problem via Google, which seems strange so i'm worried i'm missing obvious. Is there a way to use the additional providers, to have them autoload, while using hybridauth with Composer? The only solution I can think to do is to manually include the correct file before it tries to autoload. I don't mind doing that, but i'm assuming there must be a proper way to do this otherwise using Composer with Hybridauth is fairly useless.

@LINK:/questions/18575246/passing-an-int-array-to-mvc-controller
@TITLE:Passing an int array to MVC Controller
@CONTENT:I'm trying to pass an array of int from JavaScript to an MVC controller that accepts 2 parameters - an int array and an int. This is to perform a Page Redirect to the View returned by the Controller Action. var dataArray = getAllIds(); //passes back a JavaScript array 
window.location.replace("/" + controllerName + "/EditAll?ids=" + dataArray + "&currentID=" + dataArray[0])
 dataArray contains 1,7 as expected for my sample usage. Controller Code public virtual ActionResult EditAll(int[] ids, int currentID)
{

  currentModel = GetID(currentID);
  currentVM = Activator.CreateInstance<ViewModel>();
  currentVM.DB = DB;
  currentVM.Model = currentModel;
  currentVM.ViewMode = ViewMode.EditAll;
  currentVM.ModelIDs = ids;

  if (currentModel == null)
  {
      return HttpNotFound();
  }

  return View("Edit", MasterName, currentVM);
}
 The issue is that when inspecting the int[] ids passed to the controller, it's value is null. currentID is set to 1 as expected. I've tried setting jQuery.ajaxSettings.traditional = true which has no effect I've also tried creating a server side url using @Url.Action in JavaScript. I also tried JSON.Stringify before passing the array e.g. window.location.replace("/" + controllerName + "/EditAll?ids=" + JSON.stringify(dataArray) + "&currentID=" + dataArray[0])
 Again the id array ends up null on the controller side. Does anyone have any pointers on getting the int array to pass to the controller correctly? I could declare the parameter as String in the Controller Action and manually serialize and de-serialize the parameter but I need to understand how to get the framework to automatically do simple type conversions. Thanks!
@CODE:var dataArray = getAllIds(); //passes back a JavaScript array 
window.location.replace("/" + controllerName + "/EditAll?ids=" + dataArray + "&currentID=" + dataArray[0]) public virtual ActionResult EditAll(int[] ids, int currentID)
{

  currentModel = GetID(currentID);
  currentVM = Activator.CreateInstance<ViewModel>();
  currentVM.DB = DB;
  currentVM.Model = currentModel;
  currentVM.ViewMode = ViewMode.EditAll;
  currentVM.ModelIDs = ids;

  if (currentModel == null)
  {
      return HttpNotFound();
  }

  return View("Edit", MasterName, currentVM);

@TITLE:Implicit initialization of static member variables for template classes
@CONTENT:Currently I am working on a C++ project in which I plan to embed Lua scripts. For that reason certain classes need to be exported to Lua and I wanted to make this more convenient therefore I created a template class: template <class T>
class ExportToLua {
    public:
        ExportToLua() {}
        ~ExportToLua() {}
    private:
        static int m_registered;
};
template <class T> int ExportToLua<T>::m_registered = T::exportToLua();
 Now every class that needs to be exported is derived from ExportToLua<T> with T="the class to be exported". Example:  class Example: public ExportToLua<Example> {
 public:
     Example();
     virtual ~Example();
     static int exportToLua();
 private:
 };
 where Example's static member function exportToLua() holds the class-specific registration code. My understanding is that an instance of the static member variable ExportToLua<T>::m_registered exists for every compile unit - that is - for every T. But when I start my program the registration code never gets called. For example in example.cpp:  int Example::exportToLua() {
     std::cout << "int Example::exportToLua()" << std::endl;
     return -2;
 }
 however I never see this message when I run my program. Any idea why? Is the compiler some "optimizing away" the static variable m_registered, because I am not using it anywhere? Thanks for your input, Best, Christoph
@CODE:template <class T>
class ExportToLua {
    public:
        ExportToLua() {}
        ~ExportToLua() {}
    private:
        static int m_registered;
};
template <class T> int ExportToLua<T>::m_registered = T::exportToLua(); ExportToLua<T> T class Example: public ExportToLua<Example> {
 public:
     Example();
     virtual ~Example();
     static int exportToLua();
 private:
 }; Example exportToLua() ExportToLua<T>::m_registered T int Example::exportToLua() {
     std::cout << "int Example::exportToLua()" << std::endl;
     return -2;
 } m_registered template class ExportToLua<Example>; class Example

@CONTENT:I am using a custom angular.js filter for datetime objects: function relativeTimeFilter()

    };
}

function getRelativeDateTimeString(dt)
{
    if(!dt) return "undefined ago";

    var delta = dt.getSeconds();
    if (delta < 0) return "not yet";
    if (delta < 1 * 60) return delta == 1 ? "one second ago" : delta + " seconds ago";
    if (delta < 2 * 60) return "a minute ago";
    if (delta < 45 * 60) return Math.floor(delta/60) + " minutes ago";
    if (delta < 90 * 60) return "an hour ago";
    if (delta < 24 * (60*60)) return Math.floor(delta/60/60) + " hours ago";
    if (delta < 48 * (60*60)) return "yesterday";
    if (delta < 30 * (24 * (60*60))) return Math.floor(delta/60/60/24) + " days ago";
    if (delta < 12 * (30 * (24 * (60*60))))
    {
        var months = Math.floor(delta/60/60/24/30);

    }
}

module.filter("relativetime", relativeTimeFilter);
 At this point, it is not so important which filter I use (I think). The filter receives a Datetime object. The relative time declaration is only valid one second. Meaning one second ago must be updated after a second to 2 seconds ago and so on. When I apply the filter, this only happens once. So how do I trigger the filter appliance in a regular interval? I tried the following: setInterval(function() {$scope.$apply()}, 1000) // placed in controller function
 ...with no success. Any ideas?
@CODE:function relativeTimeFilter()
{
    return function (dateObj) {
        return getRelativeDateTimeString(dateObj);

 I also get the "Method 'setFilterProcessesUrl' is marked deprecated" warning and if I add <logout /> I get the same warning the second time. On the other hand, if I replace <form-login /> and <logout /> with <http-basic /> the warnings go away.

@TITLE:Pitfalls in my code for detecting text file encoding with Python?
@CONTENT:I know more about bicycle repair, chainsaw use and trench safety than I do Python or text encoding; with that in mind... Python text encoding seems to be a perennial issue (my own question: Searching text files' contents with various encodings with Python?, and others I've read: 1, 2. I've taken a crack at writing some code to guess the encoding below. In limited testing this code seems to work for my purposes* without me having to know an excess about the first three bytes of text encoding and the situations where those data aren't informative. *My purposes are: Have a dependency-free snippet I can use with a moderate-high degree of success, Scan a local workstation for text based log files of any encoding and identify them as a file I am interested in based on their contents (which requires the file to be opened with the proper encoding) for the challenge of getting this to work. Question: What are the pitfalls with using a what I assume to be a klutzy method of comparing and counting characters like I do below?

 I am assuming it would be slow compared to chardet, which I am not particularly familiar with. Also less accurate. They way it is designed, any roman character based language that uses accents, umlauts, etc. will not work, at least not well. It will be hard to know when it fails. However, most text in English, including most programming code, would largely be written with string.printable on which this code depends. External libraries may be an option in the future, but for now I want to avoid them because: This script will be run on multiple company computers on and off the network with various versions of python, so the fewer complications the better. When I say 'company' I mean small non-profit of social scientists. I am in charge of collecting the logs from GPS data processing, but I am not the systems administrator - she is not a python programmer and the less time I take of hers the better. The installation of Python that is generally available at my company is installed with a GIS software package, and is generally better when left alone. My requirements aren't too strict, I just want to identify the files I am interested in and use other methods to copy them to an archive. I am not reading the full contents to memory to manipulate, appending or to rewriting the contents. It seems like a high-level programming language should have some way of accomplishing this on its own. While "seems like" is a shaky foundation for any endeavor, I wanted to try and see if I could get it to work.

 Now the o is being passed as the parameter to the method. And the same method is being called by multiple threads in parallel. Can we safely say that this code is thread safe? There are two scenarios: If the someObject is being shared among the threads If every Thread has its own copy of someObject

@TITLE:How to change the size of an existing scene2d.ui widget in a window/table?
@CONTENT:I'm attempting to resize a scene2d.ui window (which is basically a table that can be moved around) and its contents. So far I can only successfully change the window size itself, but not its contents. I'm doing it like this: window.setWidth(newTableWidth);
textField.setWidth(newFieldWidth);
window.invalidate(); <--- New size of window is drawn properly when invalidate() is called
textField.invalidate(); <--- New textField size is NOT drawn, however
 In this case, the window contains a text field which I'm trying to resize along with the window, but only the window gets redrawn with its new size while the text field remains the same. How do I properly update the widgets within the window?

@TITLE:Value return when no rows in PDO
@CONTENT:I have a PDO function: function(){
    $success=$this->query($query, $bindvalues);

    return ($success == true) ? $this->stmt->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC) : false;
}
 When I perform a select query that returns a row (or more), it will return for example: array(1) { ["Id"]=> string(1) "1" }
 When the query fails (if I have a wrong syntax for example), it will return FALSE. But if no rows are found with the query it also returns FALSE. So the return value with an error in the query and with no rows will both return FALSE. How is that possible? I need to return FALSE only when there is an error in the query, and I need to return NULL for example when there are no results. Is there something wrong in my function? Thanks!

@TITLE:Javascript/Ajax NTLM Authentication
@CONTENT:I am developing an HTML5 mobile app, which communicates with WebServices. WebServices use NTLM authentication protocol. I am having difficulties to handle the handshake via JavaScript. NTLM sends the 401 unauthorized as response to my POST, which I have not found any way to respond to. Is NTLM authentication possible with JavaScript? Should I build a proxy web service with e.g. basic authentication in-between? my jQuery call is something like... $.ajax({

@CONTENT:I'm running my app on my local machine and using the remote API to access a datastore on my production side. Everything was working great until I tried adding a second app in google app engine launcher (I believe this is what caused the issue) because I had to merge what I was working on with some more up to date code and wanted to test as I went along. Suddenly I can't even access the remote datastore anymore. I get the error app s~buybottandrew cannot access app dev~buybottandrew's data
 I tried clearing the local datastore which allows me to access the remote datastore once, then the problem comes up again. I read suggestions on the default_partition flag and I've tried passing that as well, with a muitiplicity of different things including nothing and an empty string. --default_partition=s~buybottandrew
 It gives me the same error no matter the argument dev_appserver.py: error: unrecognized arguments: --default_partition=s~buybottandrew
 If I remove all my remote api code and deploy it when I test it on the production server everything works perfectly. I can't seem to narrow down what is going on for the life of me. Any input would be greatly appreciated.

Also, how can I get the return results from loadstring (ie the 'false' from the blah call) or set the function name when using _G (ie.

@LINK:/questions/18498749/looping-statements-performance-and-pre-allocating-the-looping-statement-itself
@TITLE:Looping statements performance and pre-allocating the looping statement itself
@CONTENT:This observation is not that important, because the time performance wasted on the loop statements will probably be much higher than the looping itself. But anyway, I will share it since I searched and couldn't find a topic about this. I always had this impression that pre-allocating the array I would loop, and then loop on it, would be better than looping directly on it, and decided to check it. The code would be to compare the efficiency between this two fors: disp('Pure for with colom on statement:')
tic
for k=1:N
end
toc

disp('Pure for with colom declared before statement:')
tic
m=1:N;
for k=m
end
toc
 But the results I got are: Pure for with colom on statement:
Elapsed time is 0.003309 seconds.
Pure for with colom declared before statement:
Elapsed time is 0.208744 seconds.
 Why the hell is that? Shouldn't pre-allocating be faster? In fact, the matlab help for says: Long loops are more memory efficient when the colon expression appears in the FOR statement since the index vector is never created. So, contradicting my expectations the colon expression at the for statement is better, because it does not allocate the vector and, because of that, is faster. I made the following script to test other occasions that I also would think that would be faster: % For comparison:
N=1000000;

disp('Pure for loop on cell declared on statement:')
tic
for k=repmat({1},1,N)
end
toc

disp('Pure for loop on cell declared before statement:')
tic
mcell=repmat({1},1,N);
for k=mcell
end
toc

disp('Pure for loop calculating length on statement:')
tic 
for k=1:length(mcell)
end
toc

disp('Pure for loop calculating length before statement:')
tic
lMcell = length(mcell);
for k=1:lMcell
end
toc

disp('Pure while loop using le:')
% While comparison:
tic
k=1;
while (k<=N)
  k=k+1;
end
toc

disp('Pure while loop using lt+1:')
% While comparison:
tic
k=1;
while (k<N+1)
  k=k+1;
end
toc


disp('Pure while loop using lt+1 pre allocated:')
tic
k=1;
myComp = N+1;
while (k<myComp)
  k=k+1;
end
toc
 And the timings are: Pure for loop on cell declared on statement:
Elapsed time is 0.259250 seconds.
Pure for loop on cell declared before statement:
Elapsed time is 0.260368 seconds.
Pure for loop calculating length on statement:
Elapsed time is 0.012132 seconds.
Pure for loop calculating length before statement:
Elapsed time is 0.003027 seconds.
Pure while loop using le:
Elapsed time is 0.005679 seconds.
Pure while loop using lt+1:
Elapsed time is 0.006433 seconds.
Pure while loop using lt+1 pre allocated:
Elapsed time is 0.005664 seconds.
 Conclusions: You can gain a bit of performance just by loop on comma statements, but that can be negligible comparing to the time spent on the for-loop. For cells the difference seems to be negligible. It is better to pre-allocate length before doing the loop. The while has the same efficiency as the for without pre-allocating the vector, which makes sense as stated before As expected, it is better to calculate fixed expressions before the while statement. But the question that I can't answer is, what about the cell, why isn't there time difference? The overhead could be much lesser than the observed? Or it has to allocate the cells since it is not a basic type as a double? If you know other tricks concerning this topic fill free to add. Just adding the timings to show the results of turning feature('accel','off') as said in @Magla's answer. Pure for with colom on statement:
Elapsed time is 0.181592 seconds.
Pure for with colom declared before statement:
Elapsed time is 0.180011 seconds.
Pure for loop on cell declared on statement:
Elapsed time is 0.242995 seconds.

@CONTENT:I have written up a piece of C code which declares a square matrix of size 4x4. Then it samples from a sampling function called rgig in package GeneralizedHyperbolic in R.

 its gives the error: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/bin/Rcmd: line 62: exec: embedR_matinv: not found
 What am I doing wrong? I also changed the main() to test() and made a shared object as R CMD SHLIB -lgsl -lgslcblas embedR_matinv.c -o embedR_matinv

 If I do a dyn.load("embedR_matinv.so") in R Studio, the code runs without any termination i.e. it hangs! Any suggestions on what is wrong in the code?

@TITLE:Strange horizontal whitespace on iPhone 4 Safari
@CONTENT:While testing my website's mobile version on several devices, I noticed a very strange behaviour. I have a scrollable content div with overflow: auto, and this works properly on all tested devices, except iPhone 4 on Safari. Other browsers and devices display it correctly, even iPhone 5 Safari. On iPhone 4 Safari, when you scroll to the end of the content, a lot of extra whitespace appears at the bottom (looks like 100-200% extra height) and the text disappears when scrolling. This doesn't happen on any other devices in Safari, nor does it happen in other browsers on iPhone 4. Has anyone ever heard of such a phenomenon before? I have absolutely no clue what causes this behaviour or how to fix it. Since I only have access to a limited amount of devices for testing, I may be overlooking other devices/browsers where this issue also occurs. If you have a mobile device and want to test it as well, the live site is here: Live site. On the mobile homepage, click one of the logo's to expand the content, then try scrolling down.

@LINK:/questions/18486699/entity-configuration-management-with-ddd-bounded-contexts
@TITLE:Entity configuration management with DDD bounded contexts
@CONTENT:I'm trying to implement multiple DDD bounded contexts as outlined here. This is an example context: I have an entity type configuration file for each entity with the appropriate FluentAPI mappings (reverse engineered using EF tooling). These configuration files also include the relationship configurations. e.g.: UserMap.cs // Relationships
this.HasOptional(t => t.SecurityProfile)
    .WithMany(t => t.Users)
    .HasForeignKey(t => t.SecurityProfileCode);
 SecurityProfile and DomainPermission are not DbSets in the context. They are automatically brought into the model due to the navigation properties on User and Module respectively. This causes my first issue. When adding User (or any other entity) to any other context I have to remember to do one of two things: Also add the configuration to the model builder for SecurityProfile (and every other relationship on the entity) Exclude SecurityProfile from the model explicitly somehow. This is starting to become a bit of a maintenance nightmare. I would be satisfied to explicitly "trim" the entity graph as outlined in point 2 above. However it doesn't seem possible to Ignore() entities when relationships are already being defined in the entity configuration files. Trying modelBuilder.Ignore<SecurityProfile>(); for the above context OnModelCreating gives the following error in ConfigureAssociations(): System.InvalidOperationException: The navigation property 'SecurityProfile' is not a declared property on type 'User'. Verify that it has not been explicitly excluded from the model and that it is a valid navigation property. The only solution I can think of is to inherit the base configuration classes and override the relationship configuration in each context. Considering we may end up with 30-40+ separate contexts this could also become a maintenance nightmare. Alternatively I could have very specific entity models for each context, but again this would lead to entity class explosion and a potential maintenance problem in duplicated configuration. How can I best manage and maintain entities and their entity configurations when implementing bounded contexts?
@CODE:// Relationships
this.HasOptional(t => t.SecurityProfile)
    .WithMany(t => t.Users)
    .HasForeignKey(t => t.SecurityProfileCode); SecurityProfile DomainPermission DbSets User Module User SecurityProfile SecurityProfile Ignore() modelBuilder.Ignore<SecurityProfile>(); OnModelCreating ConfigureAssociations()

@TITLE:Android runOnUiThread/AsyncTask cannot resolve CalledFromWrongThreadException
@CONTENT:I'm working for an Android app and implementing a ProgressBar by using AsyncTask class. The problem is that on some devices, it causes "CalledFromWrongThreadException: Only the original thread that created a view hierarchy can touch its views." in onPostExecute. On those devices, the problem occurs 100%. On other devices, it works fine. public final class MyAsyncTask extends AsyncTask<String, Integer, String>
{
    private ProgressBar progress;
    private ListActivity activity;

    public MyAsyncTask(ListActivity activity, ProgressBar progress)
    {
        this.progress = progress;
        this.activity = activity;
    }

    protected void onPreExecute()
    {
        this.progress.setVisibility(view.VISIBLE);
    }

    protected String doInBackground(String[] arg0)
    {
        // getting xml via httpClient
        return string;
    }

    protected void onPostExecute(String result)
    {
        this.progress.setVisibility(view.GONE);
    }
 I don't understand why onPostExecute does not run on the UI thread, on those certain devices. Next, I tried to call it with runOnUiThread, to make absolutely sure that it runs on the UI thread. runOnUiThread(new Runnable() {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        ProgressBar progress = (ProgressBar)findViewById(R.id.some_view_progressbar);
        MyAsyncTask task = new MyAsyncTask(activity, progress);
        task.execute();
    }
} );
 Even this did not solve the problem. The same exception still occurs. From Log, I confirmed that Thread.currentThread().getId() is certainly different from the app's main activity's thread inside the handler. I'm stuck. Any advice will be appreciated. NOTE:I edited the sample code (not a real code) above to fix the wrong method name and missing "return string". I will add more information later.
@CODE:public final class MyAsyncTask extends AsyncTask<String, Integer, String>

@TITLE:Plotting an existing MATLAB plot into another figure
@CONTENT:I used the plot command to plot a figure and then changed lots of its properties using set command. I also store the handle of the plot (say h1). What I need is to use the handle to plot the same figure again later in my code. I checked the plot command and did not find any version that accepts handle. I also thought of getting the Xdata and Ydata and use them to re-plot the same figure. What is the simplest solution? Edit 1: A working sample code based on copyobj that PeterM suggested. hf(1) = figure(1);
plot(peaks);

hf(2) = figure(2);
plot(membrane);

hf(3) = figure(3);
ha(1) = subplot(1,2,1);
ha(2) = subplot(1,2,2);

for i = 1:2
    hc  = get(hf(i),'children');
    hgc = get(hc, 'children');
    copyobj(hgc,ha(i));
end
 Edit 2: I also found this function that can copy figures (including legend) into a subplot.
@CODE:hf(1) = figure(1);
plot(peaks);

hf(2) = figure(2);
plot(membrane);

hf(3) = figure(3);
ha(1) = subplot(1,2,1);
ha(2) = subplot(1,2,2);

for i = 1:2
    hc  = get(hf(i),'children');

@CONTENT:In my app, I call TextToSpeech.getLanguage() well after instantiating TextToSpeech (~800ms according to LogCat), yet it sometimes (not always) return null, despite the language set properly in the system's TextToSpeech settings: System Settings > Language & input > 
  Text-to-speech output > Google Text-to-speech > English (United Kingdom)
 This only happens in Jelly Bean (Android 4.1.1). It doesn't happen in Android 2.2. Is this a known Android bug? Or am I doing something wrong? I instantiate, BTW, TextToSpeech in my app's main activity with: new TextToSpeech(this, this); 
 And both instantiation and the call to TextToSpeech.getLanguage() are made in the same thread (thus order of calls is guaranteed).

@TITLE:jQuery $().css(¡§content¡¨) returning the string ¡§normal¡¨ in IE9
@CONTENT:I'm using the CSS content attribute to pass some values from my LESS stylesheet to JavaScript (to use some colors defined in LESS in Canvas elements). To make my life easier I decided to place these values in a easy way to parse them in JavaScript. LESS code: div#colorChart-critical {
   content:'@{critical-highest},@{critical-veryhigh},@{critical-high},@{critical-low},@{critical-medium},@{critical-verylow}';
}
 which when compiled brings the following CSS: div#colorChart-critical6 {
    content: '#ff0000,#ff7200,#fffc00,#0000ff,#a200ff,#00ff00';
}
 Then I try to read them using jQuery: $("div#colorChart-critical").css("content").split(",");
 The problem is that in IE9 calling $("div#colorChart-critical").css("content") is returning the string "normal" for some reason. Opera, Firefox, Safari and Chrome works fine. Why does this happen in IE9? Any work-around this issue on IE9? If not any other CSS atribute I can put random texts in? I could use something like: background: url(#ff0000,#ff7200,#fffc00,#0000ff,#a200ff,#00ff00);
 But this would generate errors on the console.
@CODE:content div#colorChart-critical {

@CONTENT:I am writing my first app in phonegap and have been testing it on an android device. I believe I have granted the appropriate permission: <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
 But the map is not showing up. I am trying to get a latitude and longitude from a web service and use this to put a flag on a google map. I believe the issue is actually with the internet access as if I run this through visual studio as a website the service returns the co-ordinates and the map is displayed. However, when the app is compiled and that website is run inside the app webview the co-ordinates are not returned and no map is displayed. I also added a table to show the returned co-ordinates, again they are displayed in a browser but are blank in the running app. Anyone have any idea why the webview wouldn't be able to connect to the internet and return the required data? I have removed the actual address of the web service but I know that is fine as it works in a browser. HTML page:     <script type="text/javascript">

@TITLE:Advantages of Constructor Overloading
@CONTENT:I am very new to Java and trying to learn the subject, having previous programming exposure in only HTML/CSS. I have started with Herbert Schildt and progressed through a few pages. I am unable to understand the exact advantages of Constructor Overloading. Isn't it easier to Overload Methods using single constructor for flexibility? Moreover if I am trying to use constructor overloading to use one object to initialize another, there are simpler ways to do it! So what are the benefits and in which situation should I use Constructor Overloading.

@TITLE:Java - Filling an ArrayList of Threads with loop
@CONTENT:this question is probably pretty easy to answer but I just don't get it. I reduced my problem until this little piece of code was left in order to find the "origin" of this problem: I'm trying to fill an ArrayList of Threads with a loop. public static int u=0;

public void test(){
    while (u <10) {
        synchronized(threadList){
            threadList.add(u, new Thread(){                
                @Override public void run(){                    
                    System.out.println("Thread at Index: " + u);                     
                } 
            });
        }
        u++;            
    }

    threadList.get(2).start();    
}
 With the last line I wanted to test the loop above by starting the thread at Index '2'. I'm expecting the console to show "Thread at Index: 2" but instead this is shown: "Thread at Index: 10" No matter which integer I write in the ".get(int)"-method, I receive the index '10'. Why is that? And how to fix this? The creation of the threads seems to work...so is the integer 'u' the problem? I appreciate any kind of help! Thanks in advance!
@CODE:public static int u=0;

public void test(){
    while (u <10) {
        synchronized(threadList){
            threadList.add(u, new Thread(){                
                @Override public void run(){

 userLoggedIn() is within a parent controller index.js. The function itself runs fine within the angular app. This error doesn't occur on my other $scope.$parent boolean or strings variables in the controller, so it's related directly to calling functions within a parent. I'm thinking that I'm either using $scope.$parent the wrong way or that I need to define my index.js controller in the test, but Karma testing documentation is sporadic, so it's hard to know.

@TITLE:Serialize Dictionary<,> as array in Json.NET [duplicate]
@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: Json.Net - Serialize Dictionary as Array (of Key Value Pairs) 5 answers How can I make Json.NET serializer to serialize IDictionary<,> instance into array of objects with key/value properties? By default it serializes the value of Key into JSON object's property name. Basically I need something like this: [{"key":"some key","value":1},{"key":"another key","value":5}]
 instead of: {{"some key":1},{"another key":5}}
 I tried to add KeyValuePairConverter to serializer settings but it has no effect. (I found this converter is ignored for type of IDictionary<> but I cannot easily change the type of my objects as they are received from other libraries, so changing from IDictionary<> to ICollection<KeyValuePair<>> is not option for me.)
@CODE:IDictionary<,> [{"key":"some key","value":1},{"key":"another key","value":5}] {{"some key":1},{"another key":5}} KeyValuePairConverter IDictionary<> IDictionary<> ICollection<KeyValuePair<>>

@CONTENT:I have 2 tables: photo and like. I am trying to get popular photos based on number of likes in a day. So basically something like 'popular today'. SELECT
  p.id AS id, COUNT(li.id) AS total_likes \
FROM `photo` p \
  LEFT JOIN `like` li \
    ON p.id = li.photo_id \
WHERE

GROUP BY \
  p.id
 This works well when there are enough number of likes today. But if there are no likes in the past day, it will return no records. I also want to change this a little. Is it possible to make levels? For example: Rank photos based on multiple days: 1. Get photos based on how many likes today
2. Get photos based on how many likes for last week
and so on...
 So basically what this does is, let's say we need to get 30 items. First it will try to get rows based on how many likes there were today. It may be any number 20, 15 etc. Then it will get the remaining rows needed to get to a total of 30 but now will sort based on how many likes in a week. So something like:
SELECT FROM photo SORT BY likes today, likes in a week ...
 Thanks for your help!

@TITLE:File creation time in C#
@CONTENT:I need to get when a file was created - I have tried using:         FileInfo fi = new FileInfo(FilePath);

        var creationTime = fi.CreationTimeUtc;
 and         var creationTime = File.GetCreationTimeUtc(FilePath);
 Both methods generally return the wrong creation time - I guess it is being cached somewhere. The file is deleted and re-created with the same name and I need to know when/if it has been re-created (by checking if the created date/time has changed) - I had planned to do this by seeing it the file creation time had changed but I have found this to be inaccurate. I'm working on Win 7 and if I check File Explorer it shows the new file creation time correctly. I have also tried using the FileSystemWatcher but it doesn't entirely work for my use case. E.g. if my program is not running, the FileSystemWatcher is not running, so when my program starts up again I don't know if the file has been deleted and recreated or not. I've seen MSDN http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.file.getcreationtime.aspx where it says: This method may return an inaccurate value, because it uses native functions whose values may not be continuously updated by the operating system. But I have also tried using their alternative suggestion and setting the SetCreationDate after creating a new file but I also find that this doesn't work. See test below:     [Test]

When i have the fluent in the same folder it just works, because then it don't load it from the embedded referenced fluent. And the Fluent can find the style too so.

@TITLE:Python class variable name vs __name__
@CONTENT:I'm trying to understand the relationship between the variable a Python class object is assigned to and the __name__ attribute for that class object. For example: In [1]: class Foo(object):
   ...:     pass
   ...: 

In [2]: Foo.__name__ = 'Bar'

In [3]: Foo.__name__
Out[3]: 'Bar'

In [4]: Foo

----> 1 Bar

NameError: name 'Bar' is not defined
 So it seems like I have changed the __name__ attribute of the class but I can't refer to it by that name. I know this is a bit general but could someone explain the relationship between Foo and Foo.__name__?

@CONTENT:We are dealing with an issue where our assets are compiling w/o any issues during slug compilation. However, starting yesterday after a push to both our staging and production applications, we are now running into issues where the browser is indicating that the assets can't load for some reason. Using the browser dev tools we are seeing this error: Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found) : /assets/application-a3b17e738ce8996d058795310e3cd9b4.js The first thing we decided to do was rollback our codebase to the last commit (which was the commit that was fully functional in a previous heroku push). The same issue exists where the browser can't load the asset. Using bash, I connected to the heroku instance and checked out the public/assets directory to ensure the assets were actually there. They are ALL there with the correct hash codes preceding the file names. The files are not empty and the manifest file looks good to go. I'm not sure what else to try at this point. We've never had issues until now with loading of assets. There is nothing in the heroku push logs that indicate anything is throwing an error at any point.

@TITLE:How to update the volume indicator provided by the MinimalMediaRouteProvider
@CONTENT:When registering the MinimalMediaRouteProvider/MediaRouteButton from Androids Chromecast SDK, we get a standard dialog for connecting to existing Cromecast Devices. Once connected to the device, same dialog also provides a way to set the volume using a draggable seek bar. I am having trouble synchronizing the position of this volume seek bar with the actual volume that is already set in the Chromecast device. As part of registering the MinimalMediaRouteProvider we provide a com.google.cast.MediaRouteAdapter implementation. The onSetVolume(volume) of this interface is called when the user drags the volume seekBar above. This gives us a god way to update the volume level of the connected chromecast channel by using messageStream.setVolume(volume). The problem is that once we update the volume, there is no way to tell back the MinimalMediaRouteProvider UI that the volume has changed so it can position itself accordingly - currently it always shows the volume as 0. What is the proper way to notify the MinimalMediaRouteProvider about the current volume level so it can update its volume UI? Looking at the MediaRoute sample included with support library 7, there seem to be a way to create MediaRouteDescriptor, update the volume there and thus communicate this back to the MediaRouteProvider, but but it is not very clear how to do this in the content of Chromecast/MinimalMediaRouteProvider.

@TITLE:Bytecode changes over time in undocumented manner
@CONTENT:Today I was exploring classes of huge applications (like jboss server with apps) with javaagent and instrumentation on my openjdk 7. I called retransform on all classes every 10 seconds, so their bytecode got in my ClassFileTransformer implementation. My implementation simply keeps track of how bytecode of classes changes over time. First of all, I was surprised, that order of fields and methods, method access modifiers, contents of constant pool and other such things vary from one check to the other. But, still, it is documented. What is not documented - that some items may be created in class'es constant pool and injected into methods. For now I noticed that to happen with numeric values (Longs, Doubles, Floats and such). This is how it looks in javap; before: pool:
...
#17 Float NaNf
method:
#1 fload #17 //NaNf
...
 After something changed class during runtime: pool:
...
#17 Float NaNf
#18 Float NaNf
method:
#1 fload #18 //NaNf <- look, it loads #18 now
 I double checked, that no other transformers or agents are attached. Why can't JVM just leave my bytecode the same? Where can I read about such optimisations/transformations (or what else is it)? I read JVM sources, but these only confused me more. I'm just trying to create some kind of realtime bytecode verificator - a security tool.

@CONTENT:Some months ago I write a CGI application for Linux that uses popen() to read the output of a command, and then I close the pipe with fclose(). Now, I read that for close pipes is needs use pclose(). The manual says: The return value from popen() is a normal standard I/O stream in all respects save that it must be closed with pclose() rather than fclose(3). My code is like this: if ((NULL != (f = popen(command.value, "r")))) {
    //do something
    fclose(f);
}
 My question is: My mistake have a security concern? It program is currently in production. In tests it not do anything problem. Is really needed, patch it using pclose() instead fclose() ? Note: I only open the PIPE one time in the program. Today, in my local home I do some test and fclose() and pclose() not return EOF indicating failure.

@CONTENT:I am having a problem with the PRESENT statement with Fortran 95. Currently I am using Silverfrost's Plato and their FTN95 compiler (in "Release Win32" mode). What I wanted to do is to create a subroutine SUB(a,b), where b is an optional variable. So far so good, but the problem arises when I try to give a new value to b with if (.NOT. present(b)) b=0.

integer :: i=2, j=1

call SUB(i,j)
call SUB(i)
call SUB(j)

end program TEST
 Is there an elegant way out of this situation, or do I really need to create another variable, b_aux for instance, and then use the following code?: if (present(b)) then
  b_aux=b
  else
    b_aux=0
endif

@TITLE:SQL: How to merge case-insensitive duplicates
@CONTENT:What would be the best way to remove duplicates while merging their records into one? I have a situation where the table keeps track of player names and their records like this: stats
-------------------------------
nick     totalgames     wins   ...
John     100            40
john     200            97
Whistle  50             47
wHiStLe  75             72
...
 I would need to merge the rows where nick is duplicated (when ignoring case) and merge the records into one, like this:     stats
    -------------------------------
    nick     totalgames     wins   ...
    john     300            137
    whistle  125            119
    ...
 I'm doing this in Postgres. What would be the best way to do this? I know that I can get the names where duplicates exist by doing this: select lower(nick) as nick, totalgames, count(*) 
from stats 
group by lower(nick), totalgames
having count(*) > 1;
 I thought of something like this: update stats
set totalgames = totalgames + s.totalgames
from (that query up there) s
where lower(nick) = s.nick
 Except this doesn't work properly. And I still can't seem to be able to delete the other duplicate rows containing the duplicate names. What can I do? Any suggestions?

@TITLE:¡§java: package org.apache.cordova does not exist¡¨ when compliling Cordova in Android Studio
@CONTENT:New to android dev world and am just getting started here, well trying to anyway. I've downloaded Cordova (2.8, might need to upgrade this), Java JDK (1.7), and the new Android Studio, the Andriod SDK, installed all the 4.x packages with that, and installed ant (1.9.2). Everything seems to be working as far as that goes. Problem is when I can create a Cordova project, from the command line, load it up in Studio using the import feature, not tweaking anything, just accepting (as I read to do so on some blog out there) and everything seems to load ok and the project is there in Studio, until I try to make it. At this point, I get and error "java: package org.apache.cordova does not exist" This is followed by several other errors, which I feel may be related. I'm not nor am I trying to do anything fancy here, just get the stock up and running. Anybody know what I'm missing? Do I need to copy a file somewhere or compile something extra? Or am I using the wrong version of something? Thanks!

@TITLE:Invoke remote powershell command from C#
@CONTENT:I'm trying to run an invoke-command cmdlet using C# but I can't figure out the right syntax. I just want to run this simple command: invoke-command -ComputerName mycomp.mylab.com -ScriptBlock {"get-childitem C:\windows"}
 In C# code, I have done the following: InitialSessionState initial = InitialSessionState.CreateDefault();
Runspace runspace = RunspaceFactory.CreateRunspace(initial);
runspace.Open();
PowerShell ps = PowerShell.Create();
ps.Runspace = runspace;
ps.AddCommand("invoke-command");
ps.AddParameter("ComputerName", "mycomp.mylab.com");
ps.AddParameter("ScriptBlock", "get-childitem C:\\windows");
foreach (PSObject obj in ps.Invoke())
{
   // Do Something
}
 When I run this, I get an exception: Cannot bind parameter 'ScriptBlock'. Cannot convert the "get-childitem C:\windows" value of type "System.String" to type "System.Management.Automation.ScriptBlock".
 I'm guessing I need to use ScriptBlock type here somewhere, but don't know how to. This is just a simple example to get started with, the real use case would involve running a larger script block with multiple commands in it, so any help on how to do this would be highly appreciated. Thanks

@TITLE:Should I use a JOIN function or run several queries in a loop structure?
@CONTENT:I have this 2 mysql tables: TableA and TableB TableA * ColumnAId * ColumnA1 * ColumnA2 TableB * ColumnBId * ColumnAId * ColumnB1 * ColumnB2 In PHP, I wanted to have this multidimensional array format $array = array(
    array(
        'ColumnAId' => value,
        'ColumnA1' => value,
        'ColumnA2' => value,

                'ColumnB1' => value,
                'ColumnB2' => value
            )
        )
    )
);
 so that I can loop it in this way foreach($array as $i => $TableA) {
    echo 'ColumnAId' . $TableA['ColumnAId'];
    echo 'ColumnA1' . $TableA['ColumnA1'];
    echo 'ColumnA2' . $TableA['ColumnA2'];
    echo 'TableB\'s';
    foreach($value['TableB'] as $j => $TableB) {
        echo $TableB['...']...
        echo $TableB['...']...
    }
}
 My problem is that, what is the best way or the proper way of querying MySQL database so that I can achieve this goal? Solution1 --- The one I'm using $array = array();
$rs = mysqli_query("SELECT * FROM TableA", $con);
while ($row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($rs)) {
    $rs2 = mysqli_query("SELECT * FROM Table2 WHERE ColumnAId=" . $row['ColumnAId'], $con);
    // $array = result in array
    $row['TableB'] = $array2;
}
 I'm doubting my code cause its always querying the database. Solution2 $rs = mysqli_query("SELECT * FROM TableA JOIN TableB ON TableA.ColumnAId=TableB.ColumnAId");
while ($row = mysqli_fet...) {
    // Code
}
 The second solution only query once, but if I have thousand of rows in TableA and thousand of rows in TableB for each TableB.ColumnAId (1 TableA.ColumnAId = 1000 TableB.ColumnAId), thus this solution2 takes much time than the solution1?
@CODE:$array = array(
    array(
        'ColumnAId' => value,

@TITLE:C#: Simple and functional way to zoom picturebox images with scroll bars
@CONTENT:Is there a simple and functional way to zoom an image in a picturebox including scroll bars? At the moment, I use a picture box in a panel with auto scroll activated. To zoom, I enlarge the picturebox and move it with the scroll bars on the panel. The problem is, that it behaves strange. For example: If you zoom in to far, the margin between the upper and left form border and the image get's bigger and bigger. That's the zooming method. I got it from here. private void ZoomInOut(bool zoom)
    {
        //Zoom ratio by which the images will be zoomed by default
        int zoomRatio = 10;
        //Set the zoomed width and height
        int widthZoom = pictureBox_viewer.Width * zoomRatio / 100;
        int heightZoom = pictureBox_viewer.Height * zoomRatio / 100;
        //zoom = true --> zoom in
        //zoom = false --> zoom out
        if (!zoom)
        {
            widthZoom *= -1;
            heightZoom *= -1;
        }
        //Add the width and height to the picture box dimensions
        pictureBox_viewer.Width += widthZoom;
        pictureBox_viewer.Height += heightZoom;

    }
 Any help is appreciated. Thanks in advance. Marco EDIT: Two screenshots of an unzoomed and a zoomed (16 times) image. Pay attention to the margin between the upper border of the image and the upper border of the form.

@LINK:/questions/18264338/google-appengine-server-instance-clock-synchronization
@TITLE:Google AppEngine server instance clock synchronization
@CONTENT:I just came across the following paragraph in the AppEngine documentation for Query Cursors: An interesting application of cursors is to monitor entities for unseen changes. If the app sets a timestamp property with the current date and time every time an entity changes, the app can use a query sorted by the timestamp property, ascending, with a Datastore cursor to check when entities are moved to the end of the result list. If an entity's timestamp is updated, the query with the cursor returns the updated entity. If no entities were updated since the last time the query was performed, no results are returned, and the cursor does not move. For this to work reliably, there would have to be some sort of guarantees about the clock synchronization across different server instances. Otherwise you could get the following scenario: Server instance 1 (fast clock) saves an update with time-stamp 1000. Client asks for updates and finds this one update. Server instance 2 (slow clock) saves another update with time-stamp 950. Client asks for updates and does NOT find this update as time-stamp didn't increase. As far as I understood, there never were any such clock synchronization guarantees. Did this change??? Update: I just realized that even if the clocks were sync'ed perfectly, this approach might miss results due to the eventual consistency of queries. If a later update ends up getting committed before an earlier update and makes it into a simultaneous query while the earlier one doesn't, it will hide the earlier update. Or am I missing something?

@TITLE:R & Inkscape: text labels in SVG graphics exported from R did not recognized as a text in Inkscape
@CONTENT:I constructed dendrogram in R with the code: data(iris)

aver<-sapply(iris[,-5],function(x) by(x,iris$Species,mean))
matrix<-dist(aver)

clust<-hclust((matrix),"ave")
clust$labels<-row.names(aver)
plot(as.dendrogram(clust))
 I wanted to save the dendrogram as svg file using the code: install.packages("Cairo")
library(Cairo)

svg("plot.svg")
plot(as.dendrogram(clust))
dev.off()
 Here the problem started: When I imported the "plot.svg" into Inkscape (ver: 0.48.4) and selected any label (e.g. "setosa") it was not recognized as a text, but rather as some "user defined" object. Specifically, when I selected any "letter" in the label and inspect it with the XML Editor (ctrl+shift+X) in Inkscape I obtained this information:     **id**: use117

    **x**: 142.527344

    **xlink:href**: #glyph0-8

    **y**: 442.589844
 On the other hand, when I manually wrote "setosa" using "create and edit text objects" tool, and inspected in XML Editor, it returned:     **id**: text4274

    **sodipodi:linespacing**: 125%

    **style**: font-size:18px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;font-stretch:normal;line-height:125%;letter-spacing:0px;word-spacing:0px;fill:#000000;fill-opacity:1;stroke:none;font-family:Palatino Linotype;-inkscape-font-specification:Palatino Linotype

     **x**: 176.02016

     **xml:space**: preserve

     **y**: 596.96674
 It is likely that Inkscape did not recognize the labels as a text according to the attribute "id" from XML Editor. Hence, I am not able to change neither font, size as well as use other functions related to text objects in Inkscape. Here is the svg file, that I made with the previous code and imported into Inkscape I checked previous steps using other versions of Inkscape as well as R, but it would be the same. Here is the question: Do you have any suggestion how I can gather labels as a text attribute instead of a "user defined" (or whatever it is object...) when importing svg files from R into Inkscape? UPDATE @baptiste linked to the SO thread where @Oscar Perpi??n suggested three packages (gridSVG, SVGAnnotation and RSVGTipsDevice) that manipulate SVG. Unfortunately, neither of packages suggested could solve the problem with the text issue. So far I found SO thread where @Mo Sander suggested RSvgDevice package since it can preserve text object rather than glyphs. Being stuck with the RSvgDevice installation procedure, I found that it RSvgDevice is only available for 32-bit installations and R < 2.15.0. Otherwise, R returned warning message: Warning message:
package ¡¥RSvgDevice¡¦ is not available (for R version 3.0.1) 
 Beside the requirements for older R versions, currently only RSvgDevice can preserve a text object in SVG.

@TITLE:T-SQL - How can I make a SELECT query with multiple LIKE clauses quicker?
@CONTENT:I've got a search function for news articles that looks like this (contains more than 5 search items): SELECT TOP 5 *
FROM NewsArticles
WHERE (headline LIKE '% sustainable %'OR
headline LIKE '% sustainability %' OR
headline LIKE '% conservation %' OR

headline LIKE '% environmentally %') 
OR
(body LIKE '% sustainable %'OR
body LIKE '% sustainability %' OR
body LIKE '% conservation %' OR
body LIKE '% environmental % OR
body LIKE '% environmentally %')
ORDER BY publishDate DESC 
 This query is designed to pull out the top 5 news stories relating to sustainability and sits on my main sustainability homepage. However, it takes a while to run and the page is slow to load. So I'm looking up ways to speed this up. Having so many LIKE clauses seems cumbersome so I've tried something with a JOIN like this: CREATE TABLE #SearchItem (Search varchar(255))

INSERT INTO #SearchItem VALUES
('sustainable'),
('sustainability'),
('conservation'),
('environmental'),
('environmentally')

SELECT TOP 5 *
FROM NewsArticles as n
JOIN #SearchItem as s
ON n.headline COLLATE DATABASE_DEFAULT LIKE '% ' + s.Search + ' %' OR 
n.body COLLATE DATABASE_DEFAULT LIKE '% ' + s.Search + ' %'
ORDER BY n.publishDate DESC
 This seems to work very well for performance, but seems to sometimes bring back duplicate articles where one of the search words appears in both the body and the headline (which is often the case). I've tried using the word using 'SELECT DISTINCT TOP 5 *' but this gives me an error saying 'The ntext data type cannot be selected as DISTINCT because it is not comparable'. Is there away of stopping this from bringing back duplicates without doing 2 separate searches and using UNION?

@LINK:/questions/18242119/general-approach-for-equivalent-of-backreferences-within-character-class
@TITLE:General approach for (equivalent of) ¡§backreferences within character class¡¨?
@CONTENT:In Perl regexes, expressions like \1, \2, etc. are usually interpreted as "backreferences" to previously captured groups, but not so when the \1, \2, etc. appear within a character class. In the latter case, the \ is treated as an escape character (and therefore \1 is just 1, etc.). Therefore, if (for example) one wanted to match a string (of length greater than 1) whose first character matches its last character, but does not appear anywhere else in the string, the following regex will not do: /\A       # match beginning of string;
 (.)      # match and capture first character (referred to subsequently by \1);
 [^\1]*   # (WRONG) match zero or more characters different from character in \1;
 \1       # match \1;
 \z       # match the end of the string;
/sx       # s: let . match newline; x: ignore whitespace, allow comments
 would not work, since it matches (for example) the string 'a1a2a':   DB<1> ( 'a1a2a' =~ /\A(.)[^\1]*\1\z/ and print "fail!" ) or print "success!"
fail!
 I can usually manage to find some workaround1, but it's always rather problem-specific, and usually far more complicated-looking than what I would do if I could use backreferences within a character class. Is there a general (and hopefully straightforward) workaround? 1 For example, for the problem in the example above, I'd use something like /\A
 (.)              # match and capture first character (referred to subsequently
                  # by \1);
 (?!.*\1\.+\z)    # a negative lookahead assertion for "a suffix containing \1";
 .*               # substring not containing \1 (as guaranteed by the preceding
                  # negative lookahead assertion);
 \1\z             # match last character only if it is equal to the first one
/sx
 ...where I've replaced the reasonably straightforward (though, alas, incorrect) subexpression [^\1]* in the earlier regex with the somewhat more forbidding negative lookahead assertion (?!.*\1.+\z). This assertion basically says "give up if \1 appears anywhere beyond this point (other than at the last position)." Incidentally, I give this solution just to illustrate the sort of workarounds I referred to in the question. I don't claim that it is a particularly good one.
@CODE:\1 \2 \1 \2 \ \1 1 /\A       # match beginning of string;
 (.)      # match and capture first character (referred to subsequently by \1);
 [^\1]*   # (WRONG) match zero or more characters different from character in \1;
 \1       # match \1;
 \z       # match the end of the string;
/sx       # s: let . match newline; x: ignore whitespace, allow comments 'a1a2a' DB<1> ( 'a1a2a' =~ /\A(.)[^\1]*\1\z/ and print "fail!" ) or print "success!"
fail! /\A
 (.)              # match and capture first character (referred to subsequently
                  # by \1);
 (?!.*\1\.+\z)    # a negative lookahead assertion for "a suffix containing \1";
 .*               # substring not containing \1 (as guaranteed by the preceding
                  # negative lookahead assertion);

 This method is actually a slot that is attached to a signal. I would like to add a delay of one sec using Qtimer.However I am not sure on how to accomplish this. Since the timer triggers a signal when its finished and the signal would need to be attached to another method that does not take in any parameters. Any suggestion on how I could accomplish this task.? Update : The signal will be called multiple times in a second and the delay will be for a second. My issue here is passing a parameter to the slot attached to timeout() signal of a timer. My last approach would be to store the value in a memeber variable of a class and then use a mutex to protect it from being changed while the variable is being used .however I am looking for simpler methods here.

@CONTENT:I have an issue where .doc and .pdf files are coming out OK but a .docx file is coming out corrupt. In order to solve that I am trying to debug why the .docx is corrupt. I learned that the docx format is much stricter with regard to extra characters than either .pdf or .doc. Therefore I have searched the various xml files WITHIN the docx file looking for invalid XML. But I can't find any. It all validates fine. Could anyone suggest directions for me to investigate now? UPDATE: The full listing of files inside the folder is as follows: /_rels

 UPDATE 2: I should also have mentioned that the reason for corruption is almost certainly a bad binary file POST on my behalf. why are docx files corrupted by binary post, but .doc and .pdf are fine? UPDATE 3: I have tried the demo various docx repair tools. They all seem to repair the file ok but give no clue as to the cause of the error. My next step is to examine the contents of the corrupted file with the repaired version. If anybody knows of a docx repair tool that gives a decent error message I'd appreciate hearing about it. In fact I might post that as a separate question.

 UPDATE: I add this line of code :  galleryOne.setSelection(0);
 after this line : galleryOne.setSelection(galleryOne.getCount()/2);  
 in my code it result in showing the first image as specified it in DayGallery activity , but it result to one way infinite scrolling to left side only but not in both side , How we can get two way infinite scrolling of my gallery images with showing the first image as specified it in DayGallery activity ? really appreciate any help , thanks.

@TITLE:Where do I find android.support.v7.mediarouter.R$attr?
@CONTENT:Short version I'm getting an unhandled exception when instantiating an android.support.v7.app.MediaRouteButton object. I get: NoClassDefFoundError: android.support.v7.mediarouter.R$attr
 Where is this class? Or if it's auto-generated, how do I get it to auto-generate? Longer version I am following along with the tutorial for Android app development for chromecast found here: https://developers.google.com/cast/cast_2nd-screen_app_tutorial I am developing using the ADT bundled eclipse, on ubuntu 13.04. I imported the following jar files into a libs directory right in my workspace and have included them in my Java Build Path via "Add Jars..." button in the "Libraries" tab of the "Java Build Path" panel of my project's properties: GoogleCastSdkAndroid-1.0.0.jar android-support-v4.jar android-support-v7-appcompat.jar android-support-v7-gridlayout.jar android-support-v7-mediarouter.jar I have a single activity (the default "hello world" created by Eclipse), and have not modified the layout. The only code I need to add to cause the error (pasted below) to show is this: import android.support.v7.app.MediaRouteButton;
...
MediaRouteButton mrb = new MediaRouteButton(this.getApplicationContext());
 When I build and run the app I see the error message pasted below in LogCat (I can post more of it if anyone feels it's relevant). The key things I notice are that I seem to be missing android.support.v7.mediarouter.R$attr (NoClassDefFoundError), and that it is being called from android.support.v7.app.MediaRouteButton's constructor 08-12 00:36:02.837: E/AndroidRuntime(29600): java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: android.support.v7.mediarouter.R$attr

08-12 00:36:02.837: E/AndroidRuntime(29600):    at com.jeffbmartinez.helicast.MainActivity.onCreate(MainActivity.java:31)
...
 The fact that it is running the MediaRouteButton's constructor leads me to believe the jar files are being properly found so I don't think I misconfigured eclipse in relation to the dependencies (jar files). However, my understanding is that these 'R' files are auto-generated. If this is correct, where is my android.support.v7.mediarouter.R file? I do not see it in the gen directory, which where com.jeffbmartinez.helicast.R file is being placed. Furthermore, I find it curious that the MediaRouteButton refers to a package name that I cannot find in any of the 5 jar dependencies listed above. android-support-v7-mediarouter.jar contains only android.support.v7.app.* and android.support.v7.media.*. The only place I find reference to android.support.v7.mediarouter, aside from my error logs, is at https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/mediarouter/package-summary.html but there is little information there. Am I missing a dependency? If so, where do I get it or how do I generate it? Thanks!

@TITLE:Region of Interest in Video File
@CONTENT:This is my first time posting here and hoping for a positive result since my research is near its conclusion. I want to add in my code a function that will process only the define region of interest of a video file. (I cant post image since I dont have yet a reputation but same question is posted here ---> http://answers.opencv.org/question/18619/region-of-interest-in-video-file/) Storyboard: Im making a program in C++/OPenCV that will make the pedestrians and vehicles look that they are not in the scene/disappear by getting the running average of the videos frame. I already made that. Now my problem is I do want only the portion of the video that is under the region of interest to be processed because I want to preserve the Lighting/Illumination of the christmas lights while their blinking. Why? I want to use this method to capture only the blinking lights this coming yuletide season without the disturbance of vehicle and people in the scene. How can I do that? Getting a region of interest in a video file Thanks in advance.

@TITLE:Column Name Conflict on Laravel 4 Fluent Query Builder
@CONTENT:I have a query like this: $users = DB::table('users')->join('user_roles','users.role_id','=','user_roles.id')->get();
 and a table that has a column id (users.id) and another table that has columns id and user_id (user_roles.id & user_roles.user_id), but the problem is.. what is being returned on $user->id is the user_roles.id instead of the users.id column.. how do i fix this so that what i get is not the role id but the user id instead.. thanks!

 I have I have looked at the code, and it does not make sense for me. It calls logger.tagged. The object behind the variable logger is not a logger, but a Formatter object. This is strange. Any idea what could cause this? So far I: deleted my Gemfile.lock gem update rails bundle install bundle update In this and different orders. How can I approach this?
