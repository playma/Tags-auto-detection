@CONTENT:I have been developing an application in VS2010 and compiling it for the .NET 4.0 as the target framework. After integrating a library into my application, I get the following error message when I try to compile: Mixed mode assembly is built against version 'v1.1.4322' of the runtime and cannot be loaded in the 4.0 runtime without additional configuration information. The library works fine under .NET 3.5, but when I change my target framework to .NET 3.5, I get the following error for all my .resx files: Error 1 Object reference not set to an instance of an object. I tried ctrl-h Version=4.0.0.0 to Version=3.5.0.0 but that doesn't seem to work. Is there anything I can do other that create a new application?

I have done the creation PDF files using QTextDocument, QTextCursor and QPrinter. But when I tried to apply the same QTextDocument for odt, I ended up with just format error. Is there a way to generate such documents using any other libraries that use C++? How you guys use to generate such documents (.odt/.doc) in C++?

@TITLE:Setting a rotation transformation to a UIView or its layer doesn't seem to work?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to have one of the children views in my screen (owned by one view controller) not rotate when the device rotates. My view controller allows rotations as it should, and I'm trying to apply a 90-degree rotation to the one "stationary" view to counteract the overall rotation. Problem is, everything seems to rotate anyways, and the transform doesn't seem to do anything. I've attempted with an affine transform on the view, and with a 3d transform on the layer (below). The method is getting called, but I never see a visual difference. Any thoughts? Thanks. - (void)willAnimateRotationToInterfaceOrientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation)interfaceOrientation duration:(NSTimeInterval)duration

@TITLE:Removing every other character in a string using Java regex
@CONTENT:I have this homework problem where I need to use regex to remove every other character in a string. In one part, I have to delete characters at index 1,3,5,... I have done this as follows: String s = "1a2b3c4d5";
System.out.println(s.replaceAll("(.).", "$1"));
 This prints 12345 which is what I want. Essentially I match two characters at a time, and replacing with the first character. I used group capturing to do this. The problem is, I'm having trouble with the second part of the homework, where I need to delete characters at index 0,2,4,... I have done the following: String s = "1a2b3c4d5";
System.out.println(s.replaceAll(".(.)", "$1"));
 This prints abcd5, but the correct answer must be abcd. My regex is only incorrect if the input string length is odd. If it's even, then my regex works fine. I think I'm really close to the answer, but I'm not sure how to fix it.
@CODE:String s = "1a2b3c4d5";
System.out.println(s.replaceAll("(.).", "$1")); 12345 String s = "1a2b3c4d5";

@TITLE:Callers block until getFoo() has a value ready?
@CONTENT:I have a Java Thread which exposes a property which other threads want to access: class MyThread extends Thread {
   private Foo foo;
   ...
   Foo getFoo() {
     return foo;
   }
   ...
   public void run() { 
     ...
     foo = makeTheFoo();

 The problem is that it takes some short time from the time this runs until foo is available. Callers may call getFoo() before this and get a null. I'd rather they simply block, wait, and get the value once initialization has occurred. (foo is never changed afterwards.) It will be a matter of milliseconds until it's ready, so I'm comfortable with this approach. Now, I can make this happen with wait() and notifyAll() and there's a 95% chance I'll do it right. But I'm wondering how you all would do it; is there a primitive in java.util.concurrent that would do this, that I've missed? Or, how would you structure it? Yes, make foo volatile. Yes, synchronize on an internal lock Object and put the check in a while loop until it's not null. Am I missing anything?

@CONTENT:Sorry the basic question, but this bugs me for a while now. I create a details view from a UITable and try to dynamically set its labels, but they are not updating: - (void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath {
  myObject *tmpObj = [[myObject objectAtIndex:indexPath.section] objectAtIndex:indexPath.row];

  myViewController *tmpVC = [[myViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"NIBfile" bundle:nil];

  NSLog(@"%@", tmpVC.myLabel);              // NSLog SHOWS NULL

  [self.navigationController pushViewController:tmpVC animated:YES];
  [tmpObj release];
}
 the connections in Interface Builder are set. The Connections Tab for File Owner shows 'myLabel' - 'Label (myLabel)'
 any ideas why the value is not coming through? A few more Observations: I also have an IBAction connected. This method is properly called when I click the connected button. I got a few pointers to my NSLog-statement, whether that should not better use tmpVC.myLabel.text, but trying also returns NULL. myLabel is declared as IBOutlet UILabel *myLabel in the interface. The property is defined as nonatomic, retain. THERE'S THE LIGHT: After playing around with it for a bit more I moved the pushViewController statement above the label updates. That resolved the label updates. Working code looks like this: - (void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath {
 myObject *tmpObj = [[myObject objectAtIndex:indexPath.section] objectAtIndex:indexPath.row];

 myViewController *tmpVC = [[myViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"NIBfile" bundle:nil];

 [tmpVC.myLabel setText:tmpObj.myTitle];   // The debugger shows the text: myTitle = "myText"
 NSLog(@"%@", tmpVC.myLabel);              // NSLog SHOWS NULL

 But I don't understand why I need to push my viewController first ???

@CONTENT:I'm trying to open a user control in one of our projects. It was created, I believe, in VS 2003, and the project has been converted to VS2008. I can view the code fine, but when I try to load the designer view, VS stops responding and I have to close it with the task manager. I have tried leaving it running for several minutes, but it does not do anything. I ran "devenv /log" but didn't see anything unusual in the log. I can't find a specific error message anywhere. Any idea what the problem might be? Is there a lightweight editing mode I might be able to use or something? The reason I need to have a look at the visual representation of this control is to decide where to insert some new components. I've tried googling it and searching SO, but either I don't know what to search or there is nothing out there about this. Any help is appreciated. (The strangest thing is that the user control seems to load fine in another project which references, but VS crashes as soon as I even so much as click on it in that project.) EDIT The user control is a wrapper of a 3rd party HTML editor...so not exactly something which accesses a database. I just tried putting the control on a new project and it crashed as soon as I dragged it onto the form.

@TITLE:C++ Function pointers vs Switch
@CONTENT:What is faster: Function pointers or switch? The switch statement would have around 30 cases, consisting of enumarated unsigned ints from 0 to 30. I could do the following: class myType
{
    FunctionEnum func;
    string argv[123];
    int someOtherValue;
};
// In another file:
myType current;
// Iterate through a vector containing lots of myTypes
 // ... for ( i=0; i < myVecSize; i ++ )
    switch ( current.func )
    {
           case 1:
            //...
            break;
           // ........
           case 30:
             // blah
            break;
    }
 And go trough the switch with func every time. The good thing about switch would also be that my code is more organized than with 30 functions. Or I could do that (not so sure with that): class myType
{
    myReturnType (*func)(int all, int of, int my, int args );
    string argv[123];
    int someOtherValue;
};
 I'd have 30 different functions then, at the beginning a pointer to one of them is assigned to myType. What is probably faster: Switch statement or function pointer? Calls per second: Around 10 million. I can't just test it out - that would require me to rewrite the whole thing. Currently using switch. I'm building an interpreter which I want to be faster than Python & Ruby - every clock cycle matters!
@CODE:case class myType
{
    FunctionEnum func;
    string argv[123];
    int someOtherValue;

@CONTENT:I'm programming a spellcheck program in Python.

I know I need to start by generating a list with an edit distance of one from the invalid word(and then run that again on all the generated words). I have three methods, inserts(...), deletions(...) and changes(...) that should output a list of words with an edit distance of 1, where inserts outputs all valid words with one more letter than the given word, deletions outputs all valid words with one less letter, and changes outputs all valid words with one different letter. I've checked a bunch of places but I can't seem to find an algorithm that describes this process.

@CONTENT:I have a stl::list containing Widget class objects. They need to be sorted according to two members in the Widget class. For the sorting to work, a less-than comparator comparing two Widget objects must be defined. There seems to be a myriad of ways to do it. From what I can gather, one can either: a. Define a comparison operator overload in the class: bool Widget::operator< (const Widget &rhs) const
 b. Define a standalone function taking two Widgets: bool operator<(const Widget& lhs, const Widget& rhs);
 And then make the Widget class a friend of it: class Widget {
    // Various class definitions ...
    friend bool operator<(const Widget& lhs, const Widget& rhs);
};
 c. Define a functor and then include it as a parameter when calling the sort function: class Widget_Less :
public binary_function<Widget, Widget, bool> { 
    bool operator()(const Widget &lhs, const Widget& rhs) const;
};
 Does anybody know which method is better? In particular I am interested to know if I should do 1 or 2. I searched the book Effective STL by Scott Meyer but unfortunately it does not have anything to say about this. Thank you for your reply.

@TITLE:Detecting circular imports
@CONTENT:I'm working with a project that contains about 30 unique modules. It wasn't designed too well, so it's common that I create circular imports when adding some new functionality to the project. Of course, when I add the circular import, I'm unaware of it. Sometimes it's pretty obvious I've made a circular import when I get an error like AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'attribute' where I clearly defined 'attribute'. But other times, the code doesn't throw exceptions because of the way it's used. So, to my question: Is it possible to programmatically detect when and where a circular import is occuring? The only solution I can think of so far is to have a module importTracking that contains a dict importingModules, a function importInProgress(file), which increments importingModules[file], and throws an error if it's greater than 1, and a function importComplete(file) which decrements importingModules[file]. All other modules would look like: import importTracking
importTracking.importInProgress(__file__)
#module code goes here.
importTracking.importComplete(__file__)
 But that looks really nasty, there's got to be a better way to do it, right?

@TITLE:Create non-transparent div on top of transparent parent element
@CONTENT:EDIT: Changed title to actually be correct I'm trying to simulate a modal popup in all HTML and CSS and am having a bit of bad luck with one single element of what I'm doing. I want the innermost div, the one with the content, to not be opaque like the border is, but no matter what I try with the CSS I cannot get it to work. Here's the code: The CSS .modalBackground {
    background-color:Gray;
    filter:alpha(opacity=70);
    opacity:0.7;
}
 The HTML   <table style="height: 100%; width: 100%; position: fixed; top: 0; left: 0;"><tr><td class="modalBackground">
    <div style="display: table; height: 40px; width: 150px; position: fixed; overflow: hidden; 
        top: 40%; margin-top: -50px; left: 50%; margin-left: -75px; padding-left: 30px;
        border: solid 1px navy; background-color: White;">

@TITLE:FileHelpers and CSV: what to do when a record can expand unbounded, horizontally
@CONTENT:I'm trying to parse this type of CSV file with FileHelpers: Tom,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
Steve,1,2,3
Bob,1,2,3,4,5,6
Cthulhu,1,2,3,4,5
Greg,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14
 I can't figure out how to parse this with FileHelpers. I would imagine I should be able to do something like this: [DelimitedRecord(",")]
public class MyRecord
{
    public string Name;

    public List<int> Values;
}
 But that doesn't appear to be possible with FileHelpers. The best I can seem to do is this: [DelimitedRecord(",")]
public class MyRecord
{
    public string Name;

    public string Values;

    public string[] ActualValuesInNiceArray
    {
        get { return Values.Split(new[] {','}, StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries); }
    }
}
 I then would need to split Values on commas to get the set of values for each record. Doesn't seem to be much of a point in using FileHelpers if I have to manually parse a portion of each record. Am I missing something? I've gone over docs/examples, but can't seem to find a solution for my format. Excel has no trouble with my format, so I would imagine there is a way to do it with an existing free library (FileHelpers or some other library). Any ideas?

@TITLE:$.each([collection]) vs $([collection]).each()
@CONTENT:Both methods appear to produce the same results, but I've been hard-pressed to actually convince people that the second method works, since it's apparently not commonly known. // Create some data
var foo = { 'vals':[ {'id':'foo'}, {'id':'bar'} ] }?????????????????;

// Common Method    
$.each(foo.vals, function(i,o){
    alert(this.id);
});

// Alternative (lesser-known?) Method
$(foo.vals).each(function(i,o){
   alert(this.id); 
});
 Upon checking the source, these two appear to be one-in-the-same. The second method follows: each: function( callback, args ) {
  return jQuery.each( this, callback, args );
}
 This method demonstrably calls the more commonly-known method, meaning it's just as legitimate. Is this understanding correct, or am I missing something here? I have typically trusted this method since it didn't cause me to deviate from standard practices with regards to selectors. Let's face it, we're trained to do: $("p").each();
 So it seems only natural to do: $(obj).each();
 Am I mistaken?

@TITLE:Using PHP Gettext Extension vs PHP Arrays in Multilingual Websites?
@CONTENT:So far the only 2 good things that I've seen about using gettext instead of arrays is that I don't have to create the "greeting" "sub-array" (or whatever its called). And I don't have to create a folder for the "default language". Are there other pros and cos of using gettext and php arrays for multilingual websites? USING GETTEXT: spanish/messages.po: #: test.php:3
msgid "Hello World!"
msgstr "Hola Mundo"
 index.php: <?php echo _("Hello World!"); ?>
 index.php?lang=spanish: <?php echo _("Hello World!"); ?> turns to Hola Mundo
 USING PHP ARRAYS: lang.en.php <?php
$lang = array(
    "greeting" => "Hello World",
);
?>
 lang.es.php <?php
$lang = array(
    "greeting" => "Hola Mundo",
);
?>
 index.php: <?php echo $lang['greeting']; ?> greeting turns to Hello World
 index.php?lang=spanish <?php echo $lang['greeting']; ?> greeting turns to Hola Mundo
 (I first started with gettext, but it wasn't supported in my shared free hosting Zymic. I didn't want to use Zend_translate, I found it too complicated to my simple task, so I finally ended up using php define, but later on someone told me I should use arrays)
@CODE:#: test.php:3
msgid "Hello World!"
msgstr "Hola Mundo" <?php echo _("Hello World!"); ?> <?php echo _("Hello World!"); ?> turns to Hola Mundo <?php
$lang = array(
    "greeting" => "Hello World",

$lang = array(

 What's the best way to do this? The only thing I know to do is pull the whole field in a query then do something like $foo = [query_results];

echo "... see more"

@CONTENT:I'm following this tutorial about building a multilingual web sites using PHP gettext http://onlamp.com/pub/a/php/2002/06/13/php.html I understand the tutorial until this part: After you have the directories all prepared, it's time to create the actual "pot" file, as it is usually referred to: the messages.po file. To do this, you will need to have PHP files that use the gettext() function to "mark" strings to be translated and use the xgettext command. $ xgettext -n *.php
 Do I have to write that in the command line? In which folder do I have to be when I execute that command? Is that the Linux version of the command or for Windows? (I enabled the gettext extension in my wamp ini file) Do I have to download gettext utilites from the GNU web page in order to create .po files?

@TITLE:Why does ASP.NET web site reference assembly from GAC, when adding local reference?
@CONTENT:When you use ASP.NET web site (instead of web application model) and add reference to an assembly from local folder, Visual Studio, it seems, understands that this local assembly is also in GAC and so does NOT copy this assembly to bin folder (as it does with non-GAC assemblies), but simply adds new record in web.config file. Why such a behaviour? Is it possible to force copy to bin folder (I need this since .dll is not on target environment)? I can add assembly to bin folder as file and it will work, but in this case bin folder contents will be in source control, which is not good.

@CONTENT:I'm trying to use jQuery, and everything has been great, until now, when I'm trying to render a partial and append it to a div. Here is how I have it set up: I have an action that responds to js: def index
  @objects = Object.find(:all)

  respond_to do |format|
    format.js
  end
end
 And a template called index.js.erb with some javascript in it: alert("hello world");
 Firebug returns a "text/javascript" response containing: alert("hello world");
 But the alert window does not appear, nor does any other JavaScript work. I checked out http://railscasts.com/episodes/136-jquery And am more or less following along. I tried several other things, like using .rjs instead of .erb and putting this in my template: page.alert("hello world"); 
 but I get the same exact result, and the browser never executes the JS. Anyone know why the JavaScript isn't being executed? I'm running Rails 2.3.4.

@CONTENT:So I know how to replace newlines in my C# code. But replacing a newline for a <br /> tag isn't always very correct. So I was wondering what kind of strategy do others use? The correct way I guess would be to use <p> tags and <br /> tags. Here are some examples of the results I would like to get. If there is no newline I want the text to wrapped in a <p> tags. This text contains no newlines <p>This text contains no newlines</p>   
 If the text contains a newline I want it to be replaced by a <br /> tag and be wrapped in <p> tags. This text contains 1 newline <p>This text contains<br /> 1 newline.</p>
 If there are 'double newlines' I want that block to be wrapped in <p> tags. This is a text with 'double newlines' at the end. This is a text with no newline at the end. <p>This a text with 'double newlines at the end.</p>
<p>This is a text with no newline at the end.</p>
 I could write more examples/combination but I guess it's somewhat clear what I mean. Thanks in advance.

@CONTENT:I'm convinced that I'm just having a bad day and missing something obvious. I'm trying to create a new Grails project in IntelliJ IDEA 9.0 and I am unable to associate it with an SDK. I've tried creating a project from scratch and creating a project from existing sources. In either case, I get to the "Please select project JDK" screen and my only options are: JSDK IntelliJ IDEA Plugin SDK Mobile SDK Flex SDK AIR SDK Flexmojos SDK When I used IntelliJ IDEA 8.1.3, it would ask me the same thing and I would simply navigate to C:\Grails and everything worked fine. I've even tried adding the SDK in the following locations, but to no avail. File -> Project Structure -> Project Settings -> Project SDK -> New File -> Project Structure -> Platform Settings -> SDKs -> Add New SDK I'm missing something really obvious, right?

@TITLE:How to force page not to be cached in PHP?
@CONTENT:I have a page, index.php, that shows information based on a mysql db. There are forms on it, and the action for the forms is set to a separate page called process.php. Process.php does all the database CRUD stuff, then uses header("Location: /webadmin/email/index.php");
 to send the user back to the original page. This seems to be working fine, except for the fact that the original index page doesn't always reflect the changes made by process.php. I assume that the page is being cached, because if I do a refresh (Ctrl + F5), the page will show the latest data. How can I prevent this page from being cached? I have tried what the PHP page for header() says, but it doesn't seem to work. The Cache-Control and Expires options seem to have no effect at all - the page is still being cached. Update Ok, I was partially wrong. Apparently, the following does work in IE: <?php header("Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate");
 However, it is definitely NOT working in FF, which is still showing a cached version. Any ideas on why this is, and how I can make it stop caching?

@TITLE:C# Resized images have black borders
@CONTENT:I have a problem with image scaling in .NET. I use the standard Graphics type to resize images like in this example: public static Image Scale(Image sourceImage, int destWidth, int destHeight)
{
        Bitmap toReturn = new Bitmap(sourceImage, destWidth, destHeight);

        toReturn.SetResolution(sourceImage.HorizontalResolution, sourceImage.VerticalResolution);

        using (Graphics graphics = Graphics.FromImage(toReturn))
        {
            graphics.CompositingQuality = System.Drawing.Drawing2D.CompositingQuality.HighQuality;
            graphics.SmoothingMode = System.Drawing.Drawing2D.SmoothingMode.HighQuality;
            graphics.InterpolationMode = InterpolationMode.HighQualityBicubic;
            graphics.DrawImage(sourceImage, 0, 0, destWidth, destHeight);
        }
        return toReturn;
    }
 But I have a big problem with resized images: they have gray and black borders and it's extremely important to make have images without them. Why do they appear and what I can to do make them disappear? Sample Output:
@CODE:public static Image Scale(Image sourceImage, int destWidth, int destHeight)
{
        Bitmap toReturn = new Bitmap(sourceImage, destWidth, destHeight);

        toReturn.SetResolution(sourceImage.HorizontalResolution, sourceImage.VerticalResolution);

@TITLE:Why is filter_input() incomplete?
@CONTENT:I am working a lot on a PHP-based CMS at the moment, and while I'm at it I would like to move all the handling and sanitation of user input to one central place. (At the moment, it's a $_REQUEST here, a $_GET there, and so on). I like filter_input() very much and would like to use it for basic sanitation, but I'm unclear as to whether this function is really production ready. For example, the documentation names the following parameters for $type INPUT_GET, INPUT_POST, INPUT_COOKIE, INPUT_SERVER, INPUT_ENV, INPUT_SESSION (not implemented yet) and INPUT_REQUEST (not implemented yet). the function exists since 5.2.0, why are two crucial elements not implemented yet? If I want to fetch data from $_REQUEST, you have to use a workaround from the user contributed notes. Is there a special reason for this? Is this function still in some kind of beta? Is it trustworthy as the first call to handle incoming data? Maybe somebody familiar with the PHP development process can shed some light on this.

@TITLE:Why is NHibernate AutoFlush check so expensive?
@CONTENT:In practice we are finding the default NHibernate (v2.0 & 2.1) FlushMode=Auto to be extremely expensive. Reviewing the NHibernate source suggests that the algorithms for determining what needs to be flushed rely on brute-force of looping through all entities in session, and this occurs for every query run in a transaction. In some production scenario with updates on many items, with multiple queries we have seen the process 100 times longer with FlushMode=Auto compared to FlushMode=Commit. Any thoughts/advice/best practices for usage of FlushMode when performing 'complex' session logic involving multiple updates, multiple queries etc. Any ideas on optimizing the AutoFlush algorithms in nHibernate?

 Are there any guarantees about when stack space is allocated/deallocated for i2 and j2 or does it depend on the compiler? I would expect the stack pointer to be adjusted down when i2 and j2 come into scope and adjusted back up when they go out of scope, but then thought some compilers may just "optimize" the whole thing and account for variables in a nested scope when the function is first entered. I know I can look at the assembly code generated by my compiler, but was wondering if the implementation can be left up to the compiler. Thanks!

@TITLE:Spring: Getting FactoryBean object instead of FactoryBean.getObject()
@CONTENT:Short question: If I have class that impelemnts FactoryBean interface, how can I get from FactoryBean object itself instead of FactoryBean.getObject()? Long question: I have to use 3-rd party Spring based library which is hardly use FactoryBean interface. Right now I always must configure 2 beans: <!-- Case 1-->
<bean id="XYZ" class="FactoryBean1" scope="prototype">
	<property name="steps">
		<bean class="FactoryBean2">
			<property name="itemReader" ref="aName"/>
		</bean>
	</property>
</bean>

<bean id="aName" class="com.package.ClassName1" scope="prototype">
	<property name="objectContext">
		<bean class="com.package.ABC"/>
	</property>
</bean>

<!-- Case 2-->
<bean id="XYZ2" class="FactoryBean1" scope="prototype">
	<property name="steps">
		<bean class="FactoryBean2">
			<property name="itemReader" ref="aName2"/>
		</bean>
	</property>
</bean>

<bean id="aName2" class="com.package.ClassName1" scope="prototype">
	<property name="objectContext">
		<bean class="com.package.QWE"/>
	</property>
</bean>
 Actyually defintion of a bean with name "XYZ" (compare with "XYZ2") never will be changed, but because of factory nature I must copy the code for each configuration. Definition of a bean with name "aName" always will be new (i.e. each configuration will have own objectContext value). I would like to simplify the configuration have a single factory bean (remove "XYZ2" and rid of link to "aName"): <bean id="XYZ" class="FactoryBean1" scope="prototype">
	<property name="steps">
		<bean class="FactoryBean2"/>
	</property>
</bean>

<bean id="aName" class="com.package.ClassName1" scope="prototype">
	<property name="objectContext">

</bean>


<bean id="aName2" class="com.package.ClassName1" scope="prototype">
	<property name="objectContext">
		<bean class="com.package.QWE"/>
	</property>
</bean>
 Unfortunately, it's not as simple as I expect. I suppose to glue factory (i.e. XYZ bean from the example) with necessary objects (i.e. "aName", "aName2") at runtime. The approach doesn't work because when I ask Spring for FactoryBean object it returns to me FactoryBean.getObject() which impossible to instanciate at that time because of missing itemReader value. I hope that SpringSource foresee my case I can somehome "hook" FactoryBean.getObject() call to provide all necessary properties at runtime. Another complexity that disturb me a bit it's chains of Factories (Factory1 get an object from Factory2 that I have to "hook" at runtime). Any ideas will be appreciated.

@CONTENT:I've been Googling and Overflowing for a bit and couldn't find anything usable. I need a script that monitors a public folder and triggers on new file creation and then moves the files to a private location. I have a samba shared folder /exam/ple/ on unix mapped to X:\ on windows. On certain actions, txt files are written to the share. I want to kidnap any txt file that appears in the folder and place it into a private folder /pri/vate on unix. After that file is moved, I want to trigger a separate perl script.

@CONTENT:The scenario is the following. I have two machines A and B: A: Client (behind NAT) B: Server (behind NAT) I want B to be able to listen on any given port, so that A can send packets to B through that specific TCP port and receive any response. If both machines are not behind a NAT it is pretty straight foward process. However how do I make it work so that it works even when B is behind a router, without him having to go change the router configuration enable some port forwarding etc... For example, how do p2p program like torrent clients work without the user having anything to configure? Thanks and I hope my question is clear enough.

@TITLE:Strip text from HTML document using Ruby
@CONTENT:There are lots of examples of how to strip HTML tags from a document using Ruby, Hpricot and Nokogiri have inner_text methods that remove all HTML for you easily and quickly. What I am trying to do is the opposite, remove all the text from an HTML document, leaving just the tags and their attributes. I considered looping through the document setting inner_html to nil but then really you'd have to do this in reverse as the first element (root) has an inner_html of the entire rest of the document, so ideally I'd have to start at the inner most element and set inner_html to nil whilst moving up through the ancestors. Does anyone know a neat little trick for doing this efficiently? I was thinking perhaps regex's might do it but probably not as efficiently as an HTML tokenizer/parser might.

So, if I add a new entry, it will be 48, and then another it will be 49 etc. I want to change what the current Auto Increment counter is at. I.e.

@CONTENT:Currently every time I add an entry to my database, the auto increment value increments by 1, as it should. However, it is only at a count of 47. So, if I add a new entry, it will be 48, and then another it will be 49 etc. I want to change what the current Auto Increment counter is at. I.e. I want to change it from 47 to say, 10000, so that the next value entered, will be 10001. How do I do that?

 The source1.o source2.o source3.o files take a really long time to build, and since they are common to all the executables, I want each of them to be built only once. The current behavior for cmake, however, is to rebuild them for each exec target separately, which is an unnecessary duplication of effort. Is there a way to tell cmake to build object files only once?

@CONTENT:So I have a div in my body that's a percentage width, and inside that a div with inline style as follows: text-align: center; margin-left: -15px; margin-right: -15px; overflow: hidden;
 As you can see, I have text-align: center; on, which would, if the image was small enough for the div, center the image. But the percentage width div is definitely not going to be big enough on my 1280x800 screen. The negative margins are to overcome some padding on it's parent div. The overflow:hidden makes things look like I want, not messy. So, it's kind of working like I want it, like the header image at onenaught.com. It will become more visible on the right as you make the browser wider, but not expand from both sides, because it's not centered. So, I wonder if there's any way to center the image. Know of any?

@CONTENT:I've been looking around and came across the WT toolkit, Is it stable? Any good? I was stumped on how to go about this in C++, given the lack of libraries and resources concerning web developement. (CGI/Apache) The purpose of my application is to populate some data from a Sybase ASE15 database running GNU/Linux & Apache Hence allow some user interactions. I am going to use Sybase open client library (libct) to retrieve columns from the Server, feed this data back to wt model/view. My requests: Is there any more practical solution rather than using other scripting languages? I mean by practical, an interface with ODBC retrieving, and MVC mechanism? If not available in C++, any alternative in Java?

@TITLE:In a Zend_Form, how to avoid Zend_Validate_Email from generating multiple errors?
@CONTENT:I am building a ZendFramework application which as a login form asking for an email address and password - it seemed to make sense to validate the email address before hitting the database with the login attempt, as an invalid email would never lead to a valid hit. Zend_Validate_EmailAddress seemed like the right way to go, but I am having an issue with it generating multiple errors (question at the bottom, after the code). My form currently has the following //WPMail_Form_Login::init()
$email = $this->addElement('text', 'email', array(
    'label'=>'Email',
    'required'=>true,
    'filters'=>array('stringtrim'),
    'validators'=>array(array('emailaddress', true, array(
        'messages'=>array(
            'emailAddressInvalidHostname'=>'Your email address is invalid',
            'emailAddressInvalidFormat'=>'Your email address is invalid',
            '...'=>'(repeat for all message templates)'
        )
    ))),
));
 In the controller I directly pass the form into the view: // WPMail_AuthController::loginAction()
$this->view->form = $form;
 And in the view, it's directly echo'd: // views/scripts/auth/login.phtml
<?php echo $this->form ?>
 The result is currently something like this: - Your email address is invalid
- 'asda!!!' does not match the expected structure for a DNS hostname
- 'asda!!!' does not appear to be a valid local network name
 What I want want to know is: Is it possible to configure Zend_Validate_EmailAddress in such a way that it only produces a single email-invalid error? By 'configure' I mean, without extending the class and overriding the logic with my own. TIA.
@CODE://WPMail_Form_Login::init()
$email = $this->addElement('text', 'email', array(

 For mysql, the value of global 'wait_timeout' and 'interactive_timeout' is set to 3600 seconds and 'connect_timeout' is set to 60 secs. the wait timeout value is much higher than the 26 secs(25899 msecs). mentioned in the exception trace.

@TITLE:Non-member non-friend functions vs private functions
@CONTENT:Herb Sutter has said that the most object oriented way to write methods in C++ is using non-member non-friend functions. Should that mean that I should take private methods and turn them into non-member non-friend functions? Any member variables that these methods may need can be passed in as parameters. Example (before): class Number {
 public:
  Number( int nNumber ) : m_nNumber( nNumber ) {}
  int CalculateDifference( int nNumber ) { return minus( nNumber ); }
 private:
  int minus( int nNumber ) { return m_nNumber - nNumber; }
  int m_nNumber;
};
 Example (after): int minus( int nLhsNumber, int nRhsNumber ) { return nLhsNumber - nRhsNumber; }
class Number {
 public:
  Number( int nNumber ) : m_nNumber( nNumber ) {}
  int CalculateDifference( int nNumber ) { return minus( m_nNumber, nNumber ); }
 private:
  int m_nNumber;
};
 Am I on the right track? Should all private methods be moved to non-member non-friend functions? What should be rules that would tell you otherwise?

@TITLE:Using an associative array as php function's input
@CONTENT:Occasionally I'll write a PHP function with a single input, an associative array containing all of that function's inputs. This has benefits such as not having to remember the correct order of inputs, but I've also noticed it makes implementing changes to large codebases much easier; when I need to add another variable, and that variable has to pass through 4 or 5 pre-existing functions, it's much easier when I can just stick it in the array and pass it along. My question is, is there a downside to doing this? I rarely see functions written this way in examples, or in open source I use, which leads me to believe there is probably a downside. If there isn't a reason not to do it then why not write all functions this way? UPDATE Thanks for all your answers. It looks like two major problems stand out: Code readability - impossible to tell what variables are going into a function and what they're for Variable creep - Could wind up with massive arrays bouncing from one function to the next; one should not pass parameters to functions that don't require them Which are both great points I did not think about. It seems the general gist as well is that code where this is an issue, should probably be converted to a class. Unfortunately in this specific project such a refactoring is beyond the scope, but I also think Bill Karwin's solution is good - pass an array of optional variables

 I am using Eclipse CDT, and it marks the line with an orange squiggly line as 'syntax error'. I think it is marked as such by the CDT indexer. However, compilation (manually in a terminal) is no problem. This is a bit inconvenient however, since the elements on the line don't get indexed (so the call hierarchy tree isn't always correct, or the highlighting of elements, etc.) Why does Ecipse not like the line as it is?

I get this error when creating my Data Model: The table/view '...' does not have a primary key defined and no valid primary key could be inferred. This table/view has been excluded.

@TITLE:Differentiating between events raised by user interaction and my own code
@CONTENT:The SelectedIndexChanged event gets fired in my application from a combo box when: the user chooses a different item in the combo box, or when: my own code updates the combo box's SelectedItem to reflect that the combo box is now displaying properties for a different object. I am interested in the SelectedIndexChanged event for case 1, so that I can update the current object's properties. But in case 2, I do not want the event to fire, because the object's properties have not changed. An example may help. Let's consider that I have a list box containing a list of people and I have a combo box representing the nationality of the currently selected person in the list. Case 1 could happen if Fred is currently selected in the list, and I use the combo box to change his nationality from English to Welsh. Case 2 could happen if I then select Bob, who is Scottish, in the list. Here, my list update event-handler code sees that Bob is now selected, and updates the combo box so that Scottish is now the selected item. This causes the combo box's SelectedIndexChanged event to be fired to set Bob's nationality to Scottish, even though it already is Scottish. How can I update my combo box's SelectedItem property without causing the SelectedIndexChanged event to fire? One way would be to unregister the event handler, set SelectedItem, then re-register the event handler, but this seems tedious and error prone. There must be a better way.

I'm most in favour of z-base-32 (over the RFC4648 implementation) because of some of the design goals (e.g. handwriting) and choice of alphabet (lower-case, permuted to favour characters that are easier to read, write, speak, and remember). However, I can't find a C# implementation and I'm concerned about porting from the existing Python implementation. Does anyone have a C# implementation? Alternatively, does anyone have a set of test cases (other than the examples in the spec) that I can use to validate a port? I'm open to suggestions about alternative encoding schemes.

@TITLE:Using Core Graphics/ Cocoa, can you draw to a bitmap context from a background thread?
@CONTENT:I'm drawing offscreen to a CGContext created using CGBitmapContextCreate, then later generating a CGImage from it with CGBitmapContextCreateImage and drawing that onto my view in drawRect (I'm also drawing some other stuff on top of that - this is an exercise in isolating different levels of variability and complexity). This all works fine when it's all running on the main thread. However one of the motivations for splitting this out this way was so that the offscreen part could be run on a background thread (which I had thought should be ok since it's not rendering to an onscreen context). However, when I do this the resulting image is empty! I've checked over the code, and placed judicious NSLog's to verify that everything is happening in the right order. My next step is to boil this down to the simplest code that reproduces the issue (or find some silly thing I'm missing and fix it) - at which point I'd have some code to post here if necessary. But I first wanted to check here that I'm not going down the wrong path with this. I couldn't find anything in my travels around the googlesphere that sheds light either way - but a friend did mention that he ran into a similar issue while trying to resize images in a background thread - suggesting there may be some general limitation here. [edit] Thanks for the responses so far. If nothing else they have told me that at least I'm not alone in not having an answer for this - which was part of what I wanted to find out. At this point I'm going to put the extra work into getting the simplest possible example and may come back with some code or more information. In the meantime keep any ideas coming :-) One point to bring up: A couple of people have used the term thread safety with respect to APIs. It should be noted that there are two types of thread safety in this context: Threadability of the API itself - ie can it be used at all from more than one thread (global state and other re-entrancy issues such as C's strtok are common reasons that an API might not be thread safe too). Atomicity of individual operations - can multiple threads interact with the same objects and resources through API without application level locking? I suspect that mention so far has been of the first type, but would appreciate if you could clarify. [edit2 - solved!] Ok, I got it all working. Executive summary is that the problem was with me, rather than bitmap contexts themselves. In my background thread, just before I drew into the bitmap context, I was doing some preparation on some other objects. It turns out that, indirectly, the calls to those other objects where leading to setNeedsDisplay being called on some views! By separating the part that did that out to the main thread it now all works perfectly. So for anyone who hits this question wondering if they can draw to a bitmap context on a background thread, the answer is you can (with the caveats that have been presented here and in the answers). Thanks all

@TITLE:Why does catch(TException) handling block behaviour differ under the debugger after installing Visual Studio 2008?
@CONTENT:Consider the console application below, featuring a method with a generic catch handler that catches exceptions of type TException. When this console application is built with the 'Debug' configuration and executed under the Visual Studio debugger (i.e. through the *.vshost.exe) this fails, in both Visual Studio 2005 and Visual Studio 2008. I believe this problem only came about after I installed Visual Stuido 2008. using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(Environment.Version);
        CatchAnException<TestException>();

        Console.ReadKey();
    }

    private static void CatchAnException<TException>()
        where TException : Exception
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Trying to catch a <{0}>...", typeof(TException).Name);
        try
        {
            throw new TestException();
        }
        catch (TException ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("*** PASS! ***");
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Caught <{0}> in 'catch (Exception ex)' handler.", ex.GetType().Name);
            Console.WriteLine("*** FAIL! ***");
        }
        Console.WriteLine();
    }
}

internal class TestException : Exception
{
}
 Under the following circumstances the code behaves as expected: If built with 'Release' configuration, it succeeds. If executed via the *.exe directly, rather than through Visual Studio (F5), it succeeds. If attaching a debugger by putting System.Diagnostics.Debugger.Launch(); on line 1 of Main() it still succeeds. When the console application is launched from within Visual Studio (2005 or 2008), and therefore executed under ConsoleApplication.vshost.exe, it fails. Here is my output for the failure case 2.0.50727.3068
Trying to catch a <TestException>...
*** FAIL! ***

Caught <TestException> in 'catch (Exception ex)' handler.
  Expected: <TestException>
    Actual: <TestException>
  Result of typeof(TException) == ex.GetType() is True
 What is causing this peculiar failure?

@TITLE:Is it possible to set a style in XAML that selectively affects controls?
@CONTENT:In <Window.Resources> I have defined following style:     <Style x:Key="textBlockStyle" TargetType="TextBlock">
        <Setter Property="Margin" Value="5,0,5,0"/>
    </Style>
 I have defined some grid where I have four TextBlocks:     <WrapPanel>
        <TextBlock Style="{StaticResource textBlockStyle}">Server</TextBlock>
        <TextBlock Style="{StaticResource textBlockStyle}">IP</TextBlock>
        <TextBlock Style="{StaticResource textBlockStyle}">Port</TextBlock>
        <TextBlock Style="{StaticResource textBlockStyle}">Status</TextBlock>

 Problem: I need to reference the textBlockStyle four times. Question: Is it possible to set that style just once at in WrapPanel or somewhere else without repeating the reference to the style? Maybe something like:     <WrapPanel Style="{StaticResource textBlockStyle}">
        <TextBlock>Server</TextBlock>
        <TextBlock>IP</TextBlock>
        <TextBlock>Port</TextBlock>

 I am not searching for a global solution! I could delete that x:Key="textBlockStyle" property, but that would affect all TextBlocks in the Window. I need a more selective mechanism, but without that ugly code duplication.

The problem that I am having is that the superclass's methods are being bound, when I do not want them to be bound, and cannot update the class.

 I would expect that only the methods annotated @XmlElement on Person would be bound and marshalled, but the superclass's methods are all being bound, as well. The resulting XML then has too much information. How do I prevent the superclass's methods from being bound without having to annotate the superclass, itself?

@TITLE:How to set processor affinity on an executable in Windows XP?
@CONTENT:I have a quad core system with third party application that once in a while spins several processes (always the same executable but several instances of it) and takes 100% of CPU time. I also have a couple of web services running on the same box (IIS and third party). The problem with the all cores being busy is that it makes this third party web server to timeout (IIS works fine though, just slower than usual). I have no control over third party web server, it's a part of the bigger product and has to be operational. So, I tried to play with processor affinity (via SysInternals Process Explorer) and limit those pesky processes to 3 cores out of 4 and dedicate the 4th core to the third party web server, and it seems to work quite well. The problem is that it only sets affinity on the running process and not on executable level, so after those processes finish and later respawn as a new processes it's all the same again - they take all 4 cores. So, I've googled about this ImageCfg.exe utility from Microsoft but I can't find it on Microsoft webside for download and I see that some people tried it and now complain that it doesn't really work. Is there a way to stick the affinity to the executable?

Objects are stored as key/value Object/Object pairs, so the interface would be a bit like Hashtable get/put A call to 'get' would mark that object as the most recently used. At any time, the least recently used object can be purged from the cache. Lookups and purges must be fast (As in Hashtable fast) The number of Objects may be large, so list lookups are not good enough. The implementation must be made using JavaME, so there is little scope for using third-party code or neat library classes from the standard Java libraries.

Behind the splash screen, licensing information is being check, and if it fails I show a MessageBox. According to this Feedback, it is because the MessageBox.Owner is the splash screen and as soon as another window is open even if it is a MessageBox the splash screen window is closed which then in turn closes the MessageBox, so the user never sees the MessageBox. So the workaround would be to set the MessageBox.Owner to another window, but that would mean that I have to instantiate another window which might not even be needed. Would it be possible to set the MessageBox.Owner to the desktop window? And how, because the only other function that comes to mind is the GetDesktopWindow() api function, but that returns a window handle and MessageBox.Owner is a WPF Window.

@CONTENT:I'm running a memory intensive app on a machine with 16Gb of RAM, and an 8-core processor, and Java 1.6 all running on CentOS release 5.2 (Final). Exact JVM details are: java version "1.6.0_10"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_10-b33)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 11.0-b15, mixed mode)
 I'm launching the app with the following command line options: java -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -verbose:gc -server -Xmx10g -Xms10g ...
 My application exposes a JSON-RPC API, and my goal is to respond to requests within 25ms. Unfortunately, I'm seeing delays up to and exceeding 1 second and it appears to be caused by garbage collection. Here are some of the longer examples: [GC 4592788K->4462162K(10468736K), 1.3606660 secs]
[GC 5881547K->5768559K(10468736K), 1.2559860 secs]
[GC 6045823K->5914115K(10468736K), 1.3250050 secs]
 Each of these garbage collection events was accompanied by a delayed API response of very similar duration to the length of the garbage collection shown (to within a few ms). Here are some typical examples (these were all produced within a few seconds): [GC 3373764K->3336654K(10468736K), 0.6677560 secs]
[GC 3472974K->3427592K(10468736K), 0.5059650 secs]
[GC 3563912K->3517273K(10468736K), 0.6844440 secs]
[GC 3622292K->3589011K(10468736K), 0.4528480 secs]
 The thing is that I thought the UseConcMarkSweepGC would avoid this, or at least make it extremely rare. On the contrary, delays exceeding 100ms are occurring almost once a minute or more (although delays of over 1 second are considerably rarer, perhaps once every 10 or 15 minutes). The other thing is that I thought only a FULL GC would cause threads to be paused, yet these don't appear to be full GCs. It may be relevant to note that most of the memory is occupied by a LRU memory cache that makes use of soft references. Any assistance or advice would be greatly appreciated.

I don't think my client will be requesting any upgrade like this, so this is just theoretical.

@TITLE:best approach to member variables in object-oriented javascript?
@CONTENT:This is a follow up to a question I just posted. I'm wondering how you all handle member variables in javascript clases when using MyClass.prototype to define methods. If you define all of the methods in the constructor function: function MyClass(){
 this.myMethod = function(){}
}
 You can very nicely declare member variables and access them from inside your methods: function MyClass(){
 var myVar = "hello";
 this.myMethod = function(){
  alert(myVar);
 }
}
 When using the Object.prototype technique, you lose this nicety, and have to do it like this; function MyClass(){}
MyClass.prototype.myVar = "hello";
MyClass.prototype.myMethod = function(){alert(this.hello)};
 I'm not crazy about having to write "this" every time I access a member variable. I want to use the Object.prototype approach for memory and flexibility reasons, but it seems a lot clumsier syntax-wise. Is this how you folks generally work? thanks, -Morgan
@CODE:function MyClass(){
 this.myMethod = function(){}
} function MyClass(){
 var myVar = "hello";
 this.myMethod = function(){
  alert(myVar);
 }
} function MyClass(){}
MyClass.prototype.myVar = "hello";
MyClass.prototype.myMethod = function(){alert(this.hello)};

@LINK:/questions/300786/duplicate-returned-by-guid-newguid
@TITLE:Duplicate returned by Guid.NewGuid()?
@CONTENT:We have an application that generates simulated data for one of our services for testing purposes. Each data item has a unique Guid. However, when we ran a test after some minor code changes to the simulator all of the objects generated by it had the same Guid. There was a single data object created, then a for loop where the properties of the object were modified, including a new unique Guid, and it was sent to the service via remoting (serializable, not marshal-by-ref, if that's what you're thinking), loop and do it again, etc. If we put a small Thread.Sleep( ...) inside of the loop, it generated unique id's. I think that is a red-herring though. I created a test app that just created one guid after another and didn't get a single duplicate. My theory is that the IL was optimized in a way that caused this behavior. But enough about my theories. What do YOU think? I'm open to suggestions and ways to test it. UPDATE: There seems to be a lot of confusion about my question, so let me clarify. I DON'T think that NewGuid() is broken. Clearly it works. Its FINE! There is a bug somewhere though, that causes NewGuid() to either: 1) be called only once in my loop 2) be called everytime in my loop but assigned only once 3) something else I haven't thought of This bug can be in my code (MOST likely) or in optimization somewhere. So to reiterate my question, how should I debug this scenario? (and thank you for the great discussion, this is really helping me clarify the problem in my mind) UPDATE # 2: I'd love to post an example that shows the problem, but that's part of my problem. I can't duplicate it outside of the whole suite of applications (client and servers). Here's a relevant snippet though: OrderTicket ticket = new OrderTicket(... );

for( int i = 0; i < _numOrders; i++ )
{
	ticket.CacheId = Guid.NewGuid();
	Submit( ticket );  // note that this simply makes a remoting call

@TITLE:What are the best Open Source tools for developing Flash applications? What are the best places to start learning? [closed]
@CONTENT:As far as tools go, I am aware of haXe, MTASC, and swfmill. Can you offer any success or horror stories related to any of them? Are there any others that I should be investigating? With respect to learning, the Adobe Developer Connection seems to contain decent reference materials, but the tutorials all assume that the reader is using the "Adobe Flash" product. Are there any tutorials out there targeted at Open Source users? What are the advantages of Flash 9/ActionScript 3 versus Flash 8/ActionScript 2? Am I correct in thinking that Flash 8 is still more widely deployed than Flash 9, and better supported by the Open Source flash players?

Do you typically roll your own generator? If so, what type of generator do you write (asp templates, coddom etc.). If not, what 3rd party tools do you use?

@CONTENT:Suppose that a group wants to encrypt some information, then share the encryption key among the group members in a way that requires the consensus of the group to decrypt the information. I'm interested in a variety of scenarios where the breadth of consensus ranges from unanimity to an absolute majority. A useful technique can apply to symmetric keys, private keys, or both. I could take a crack at rolling my own method, as I'm sure many SO members could. But for the purposes of this question, I am interested only in methods that have been widely published and have withstood scrutiny by expert cryptanalysts.

@LINK:/questions/18077/the-best-way-of-checking-for-moz-border-radius-support
@TITLE:The best way of checking for -moz-border-radius support
@CONTENT:I wanted some of those spiffy rounded corners for a web project that I'm currently working on. I thought I'd try to accomplish it using javascript and not CSS in an effort to keep the requests for image files to a minimum (yes, I know that it's possible to combine all required rounded corner shapes into one image) and I also wanted to be able to change the background color pretty much on the fly. I already utilize jQuery so I looked at the excellent rounded corners plugin and it worked like a charm in every browser I tried. Being a developer however I noticed the opportunity to make it a bit more efficient. The script already includes code for detecting if the current browser supports webkit rounded corners (safari based browsers). If so it uses raw CSS instead of creating layers of divs. I thought that it would be awesome if the same kind of check could be performed to see if the browser supports the Gecko-specific -moz-border-radius-* properties and if so utilize them. The check for webkit support looks like this: var webkitAvailable = false;  
try {  
    webkitAvailable = (document.defaultView.getComputedStyle(this[0], null)['-webkit-border-radius'] != undefined);
} 
catch(err) {}
 That, however, did not work for -moz-border-radius so I started checking for alternatives. My fallback solution is of course to use browser detection but that's far from recommended practice ofcourse. My best solution yet is as follows. var mozborderAvailable = false;
try {
    var o = jQuery('<div>').css('-moz-border-radius', '1px');
    mozborderAvailable = $(o).css('-moz-border-radius-topleft') == '1px';
    o = null;
} catch(err) {}
 It's based on the theory that Gecko "expands" the composite -moz-border-radius to the four "subproperties" -moz-border-radius-{topleft,topright,bottomleft,bottomright} Is there any javascript/CSS guru out there that have a better solution? (The feature request for this page is at http://plugins.jquery.com/node/3619)

try {  
    webkitAvailable = (document.defaultView.getComputedStyle(this[0], null)['-webkit-border-radius'] != undefined);

@CONTENT:Imagine that I have an order list of tuples: s = [(0,-1), (1,0), (2,-1), (3,0), (4,0), (5,-1), (6,0), (7,-1)]
 Given a parameter X, I want to select all the tuples that have a first element equal or greater than X up to but not including the first tuple that has -1 as the second element. For example, if X = 3, I want to select the list [(3,0), (4,0)] One idea I had is: Get the cut-off key with E = min (x [0] for x in s if (x [0] >= X) and (x [1] == -1) )
 Then select elements with keys between the X and E: R = [x for x in s if X <= x [0] < E]
 That gives me what I want in R, but it seems really inefficient, involving two table scans. I could do it in a for loop, discarding tuples with keys too small, and break when I hit the first blocking tuple. But for runs like a dog compared to list selection. Is there a super-efficient, python-esque (2.7) way of doing this?

So, I want to know when the Snackbar is no longer visible, so it's safe to delete the items. I can call getView() on the Snackbar, but I'm not sure what listener I should be using. I tried setOnSystemUiVisibilityChangeListener() but that didn't work, I believe it is only for the system status bar. Additionally, Snackbar can not be extended, as it has a private constructor.

@TITLE:After import from Eclipse to Android Studio cannot run Execution failed for task ':app:dexDebug"
@CONTENT:Have an Android project working in Eclipse (4.4.2) ADT, running on Linux (Ubuntu 14.10). I have imported to Android Studio (1.1.0) and managed to get rid of my initial compilation errors. The next thing I want to d is to run on my phone - I push the green "Run" button and after a little while I get an error (this doesn't show up when I just build module, only when I try to run) The error is this: Error:Execution failed for task ':myapp:dexDebug'. com.android.ide.common.process.ProcessException: org.gradle.process.internal.ExecException: Process 'command '/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/bin/java'' finished with non-zero exit value 2 Been looking through SO for the last 4 hours and not found anything that seems relevant to my project. Is there another place I can look to find a more useful error?

@TITLE:Iterating on a tuple¡K again
@CONTENT:It's been a while that I've been doing C++ but I'm not familiar with templates. Recently, I tried to write a class that wrap a std::vector<std::tuple<Types...>>. This class must have member functions, and I really need to be able to iterate over the tuple. In fact, if I am able to print every element of a tuple (in the order), I would be able to do everything I need. I found a solution using a cast, but I'm not really confident with it since it is based on a cast that I don't really like (plus, when I try to use static_cast, it doesn't compile anymore). My question is, is the following code correct, portable, is it a hack and should I find another way to do this than to use this cast ? Also, this cast is probably a runtime-cast right ? Is there a way to do what I want without this ? std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& out, std::tuple<> const& tuple)
{
    return out; // Nothing to do here
}

template<typename First, typename... Types>
std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& out, std::tuple<First, Types...> const& tuple)
{
    out << std::get<0>(tuple) << " ";

    // The cast that I don't like
    return out << (std::tuple<Types...>&) tuple;
}

int main()
{
    auto tuple = std::make_tuple(1, 2.3, "Hello");
    std::cout << tuple << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
 Thank you in advance for your answers.

I¡¦m used to leveraging retries, poison messages, at least once delivery and so on for normal enterprise messaging solutions, which Azure Service Bus Queues and Topics give me. It seems that Event Hubs is intended to provide a different tool for very high scale where you have to give up a little of the more ¡§enterprise¡¨ features for much higher scale. Am I thinking about this correctly? Are there additional specifics I need to consider as well? I realize there could be some functional overlap with Event Hubs and Topics, but I'm just looking to get some clarity on how to think of using Event Hubs.

@TITLE:AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Dockerrun.aws.json and multiple ports on docker run [duplicate]
@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: Exposing multiple ports from Docker within Elastic Beanstalk 2 answers I wish to run a docker in a EC2 instance with AWS API, and I have a Dockerrun.aws.json like this: {
  "AWSEBDockerrunVersion": "1",
  "Authentication": {

    {

}
 Like you can see, I have multiple ports to expose, but elastic beanstalk expose only the first of they. I found this sentence in the documentation: You can specify multiple container ports, but AWS Elastic Beanstalk uses only the first one to connect your container to the host's reverse proxy and route requests from the public Internet. My question is why ? I have an authentication which use Oauth2 protocol, and I must use HTTPS protocol for obvious security reasons. With this restriction, I can only choose HTTP or HTTPS, because I can only expose port 80 or 443. I tried to tinker ebextensions to make nginx redirections with ports at the level of EC2 instances, but i've failed. How can I do ? This stackoverflow user has the same problem.

@TITLE:How to upload multiple android archives (one for each flavor)
@CONTENT:I am trying to upload multiple artifacts per project w/ the maven gradle plugin: http://www.gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/maven_plugin.html 53.6.4.1. Multiple artifacts per project

Maven can only deal with one artifact per project. This is reflected in the structure of the Maven POM. We think there are many situations where it makes sense to have more than one artifact per project. In such a case you need to generate multiple POMs. In such a case you have to explicitly declare each artifact you want to publish to a Maven repository. The MavenDeployer and the MavenInstaller both provide an API for this:

Example 53.9. Generation of multiple poms

build.gradle
uploadArchives {
    repositories {
        mavenDeployer {
            repository(url: "file://localhost/tmp/myRepo/")
            addFilter('api') {artifact, file ->
                artifact.name == 'api'
            }
            addFilter('service') {artifact, file ->
                artifact.name == 'service'
            }
            pom('api').version = 'mySpecialMavenVersion'
        }
    }
}
You need to declare a filter for each artifact you want to publish. This filter defines a boolean expression for which Gradle artifact it accepts. Each filter has a POM associated with it which you can configure. To learn more about this have a look at PomFilterContainer and its associated classes.
 Really what I am trying to do is to upload different archives for different flavors of my build. Here is my projects build.gradle file: apply plugin: 'com.android.library'
apply plugin: 'maven'

 Is something like this possible? How do I get at the artifactId and flavor in each publish? I used ${artifactId} and ${flavor} as placeholders but I know that is not right. EDIT: Alright I figured out how to get a different artifact for each flavor. One of the keys was to set the: publishNonDefault true
 However when I do that I do not get a pom file for each artifact. I have transitive dependencies that need to be pulled in and I don't think they will get pulled in without a pom. Here is my current gradle script, how do I get a pom generated for each. apply plugin: 'com.android.library'

@CODE:53.6.4.1. Multiple artifacts per project

Maven can only deal with one artifact per project. This is reflected in the structure of the Maven POM. We think there are many situations where it makes sense to have more than one artifact per project. In such a case you need to generate multiple POMs. In such a case you have to explicitly declare each artifact you want to publish to a Maven repository. The MavenDeployer and the MavenInstaller both provide an API for this:

Example 53.9. Generation of multiple poms

build.gradle
uploadArchives {
    repositories {
        mavenDeployer {
            repository(url: "file://localhost/tmp/myRepo/")
            addFilter('api') {artifact, file ->
                artifact.name == 'api'
            }
            addFilter('service') {artifact, file ->
                artifact.name == 'service'
            }
            pom('api').version = 'mySpecialMavenVersion'
        }
    }
}
You need to declare a filter for each artifact you want to publish. This filter defines a boolean expression for which Gradle artifact it accepts. Each filter has a POM associated with it which you can configure. To learn more about this have a look at PomFilterContainer and its associated classes. apply plugin: 'com.android.library'

@TITLE:What is shared_ptr's aliasing constructor for?
@CONTENT:In this page (http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/memory/shared_ptr/), paragraph 5, it says: Additionally, shared_ptr objects can share ownership over a pointer while at the same time pointing to another object. This ability is known as aliasing (see constructors), and is commonly used to point to member objects while owning the object they belong to. Because of this, a shared_ptr may relate to two pointers: A stored pointer, which is the pointer it is said to point to, and the one it dereferences with operator*. An owned pointer (possibly shared), which is the pointer the ownership group is in charge of deleting at some point, and for which it counts as a use. Generally, the stored pointer and the owned pointer refer to the same object, but alias shared_ptr objects (those constructed with the alias constructor and their copies) may refer to different objects. Then I read this page (http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/memory/shared_ptr/shared_ptr/) about the aliasing constructor of shared_ptr. But I still think this "aliasing" behavior confusing. Why is it here? What is it for? In what situation would I want this feature?

@TITLE:How to install mod_perl 2.0.9 in Apache 2.4 on OS X Yosemite?
@CONTENT:With the release of OS X 10.10 Yosemite, Apple upgraded its Apache server to version 2.4. At release time, mod_perl 2.0.8 was incompatible with Apache 2.4, and mod_perl 2.0.9 had not yet been officially released (more info). So, Apache was included without mod_perl. I work locally on a web site using perl and need to install mod_perl. I'm an experienced programmer, but I have never done anything like this before and have only my main machine to work on. I don't mind spending some time to figure this out, but I can't afford to bork my local server. How does one install mod_perl on OS X Yosemite? Sub-questions: which version should I install? do I download it to the install location or elsewhere? where do I install it? are there other dependencies that need to be installed beforehand? do I have to re-create the apache install or is the mod_perl installation self-contained? I'm experienced in bash and very comfortable using Terminal.

@TITLE:UIWebView + Sharepoint + NTLM Auth - I get Stream is sending an event before being opened
@CONTENT:I have been working on an App that has a simple UIWebView in it that displays a Sharepoint site. I originally thought the NTLM authentication would be an issue but as it turns out that is really straight forward. However, ever since iOS8 my app has been spamming "Stream is sending an event before being opened" over and over again in my log to the point that the page really never can load. I originally thought it was something I was doing so I created a small app (below) to remove any weirdness my other app may have had but unfortunately I get the same issue. I guess my main issue is I don't know where to even start to look to find an answer to this one. The Internet has some mention of this but no clear resolution like [webView dontDoThat]. :D I am playing around with adding the connection to the run loop manually, you will see this in the code. I have tried every way I know how to create the connection but this is the most recent try. I start out handing the SSL challenge because my cert is not valid for the domain, then I get the NTLM challenge and send in the hard coded username and pass as a test. It partially loads the site but finally gives up loading all the resources in what I assume is this error. Theories welcome. //

@TITLE:Unexpected output in a multithreaded program
@CONTENT:Following is a program which uses pthreads. #include <pthread.h> // posix threads

}
 Each time when I run the program I am expecting to get different number of execution numbers from the main thread and the child thread (because the main thread might exit before the child). I am getting this expected output sometimes. But I got an output as follows, which I am unable to understand why. Hi I'am main 0 
Hi I'am main 1 
Hi I'am main 2 
Hi I'am main 3 
Hi I'am main 4

Hi I'am sample_thread 2 
Hi I'am sample_thread 3 
Hi I'am sample_thread 4 
Hi I'am sample_thread 4 
Hi I'am sample_thread 5 
 Why did the sample thread 0 and 4 print twice?
@CODE:#include <pthread.h> // posix threads

This is how it is when i press my reset button this is my code <div class="page-header"><center><h2>Give us your Feedback</h2></center></div>

@LINK:/questions/25168593/angularjs-lazy-loading-controllers-and-content
@TITLE:AngularJS: lazy loading controllers and content
@CONTENT:In this simplified scenario, I have two files: index.htm, lazy.htm. index.htm: var myApp = angular.module('myApp', []);
myApp.controller('embed',function($scope){
    $scope.embed = 'Embedded Controller';
});                  
<div ng-controller="embed">{{embed}}</div>    
<div ng-include="'lazy.htm'"></div>
 lazy.htm myApp.controller('lazy',function($scope){
    $scope.lazy = 'Lazy Controller';
});
<div ng-controller="lazy">
    {{lazy}}
</div>
 The result is an error: "Argument 'lazy' is not a function, got undefined" Using a function instead lazy.htm function lazy($scope) {
    $scope.lazy = 'Lazy Controller';
}
<div ng-controller="lazy">
    {{lazy}}
</div>
 This works until version 1.3 beta 14. In beta 15 was removed the global controller functions: https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/8296 So now, what is the better way to get angularized contents of lazy.htm dynamically? UPDATE: In this article (http://ify.io/lazy-loading-in-angularjs) I found another possible solution. The $controllerProvider allow us to register new controllers after angular bootstrap. Works like a charm. Tested in v1.3.0-beta.18 index.htm: var myApp = angular.module('myApp', [])
.controller('embed',function($scope){
    $scope.embed = 'Embedded Controller';
})
.config(function($controllerProvider) {
    myApp.cp = $controllerProvider;
});

<div ng-controller="embed">{{embed}}</div>    
<div ng-include="'lazy.htm'"></div>
 lazy.htm myApp.cp.register('lazy',function($scope){
    $scope.lazy = 'Lazy Controller';
});
<div ng-controller="lazy">
    {{lazy}}
</div>
 UPDATE 2: Two other alternatives that works are: lazy.htm _app = $('[ng-app]').scope();    
_app.lazy = function($scope) {
    $scope.lazy = 'Lazy Controller';
};
 OR var $rootScope = $('[ng-app]').injector().get('$rootScope');        
$rootScope.lazy = function($scope) {
    $scope.lazy = 'Lazy Controller';
}; 
 But I believe these last two examples should not be used in production.
@CODE:var myApp = angular.module('myApp', []);
myApp.controller('embed',function($scope){
    $scope.embed = 'Embedded Controller';
});                  
<div ng-controller="embed">{{embed}}</div>    
<div ng-include="'lazy.htm'"></div> myApp.controller('lazy',function($scope){
    $scope.lazy = 'Lazy Controller';
});
<div ng-controller="lazy">
    {{lazy}}
</div> function lazy($scope) {
    $scope.lazy = 'Lazy Controller';
}
<div ng-controller="lazy">

@TITLE:UITextInputDelegate methods not functioning correctly
@CONTENT:I'm working on iOS 8 custom keyboard extension right now, and there are some issues in using UITextInputDelegate Methods. Does this right: selectionWillChange: and selectionDidChange: methods should be called when user long-presses typing area? And textWillChange: and textDidChange: methods should be called whenever the text is literally changing? Actually, what I observed is that, when I changed selection in text input area, textWillChange: and textDidChange: are called, and I cannot get a clue that the other two methods are called in what condition. If anyone knows about the usage of these delegate methods, please let me know.

@TITLE:Google+ Sign-In - Uncaught SecurityError
@CONTENT:I'm implementing Google+ Sign-In's hybrid / one-time auth code flow and experiencing this error in Chrome's JS console after the sign-in prompts and granting the app permission, presumably when Google's code tries to call back to the button: Uncaught SecurityError: Blocked a frame with origin "https://ww2.fa.org" from accessing a frame with origin "https://accounts.google.com". Protocols, domains, and ports must match. This does not seem to occur in Safari or IE and a similar permission error occurs sometimes in Firefox, but is reproducible more often than not in Chrome. Refreshing the frame with the sign-in button (after following the google-side prompts) will usually result in the refreshed button "knowing" that the sign-in was successful a call to the success handler... it should always work without a refresh, but just doesn't. Any thoughts? The sign-in is at https://ww2.fa.org/gauth/ and it only requests the email scope if you're inclined to take a look!?

 Update #1, 2014-07-29 15:07:51Z Apparently Robert Grant has started to build an R function to produce bar-charts with pictograms, it can be found at Github. Thanks to Andrie for that information. I'm currently working to see if Robert's function can do what I am looking for. Please chime in if you have any advice on how to answer my question using Robert's function. Update #2, 2014-08-02 12:35:19Z Here is a simple illustration of how Grant's R-pictogram-function work # in case you don't alredy have RCurl

 Got this script form this SO answer source_github("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robertgrant/pictogram/master/pictogram.R")

@TITLE:Haproxy route and rewrite based on URI path
@CONTENT:I am trying to setup an Haproxy to load balance requests on a few backends identified by the uri path. For example: https://www.example.com/v1/catalog/foo/bar Should lead to the "catalog-v1" backends. Thing is each app responds on a different path so I must not only identify the app but rewrite the URL path. E.g. https://www.example.com/v1/catalog/product https://www.example.com/v2-2/checkout/cart/123 https://www.example.com/v3.1.2/checkout/cart TO https://www.example.com/catalog-v1/product https://www.example.com/checkout-v2-2/cart/123 https://www.example.com/checkout-v3.1.2/cart I know I shouldn't use Haproxy for rewriting purposes but for now this is inevitable. Tried the following regex which worked on regex101: ([a-z.]*)\/([a-z0-9\-\.]*)\/([a-z\-]*)\/(.*)
 Substitution: \1/\3-\2/\4
 And finally here's the haproxy.config: global

@TITLE:Bootstrap 3 grid with different height in each item - is it solvable using only CSS?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to make a grid of thumbnails, where each thumbnail has an image and a label. It works fine if all the labels have the same length, because then all the thumbnails have the same height: http://www.bootply.com/iSqwWyx5ms However, if I shorten the rightmost thumbnail's text, part of the row below gets pushed into a new row, as shown here: http://www.bootply.com/Wqd021aaeM What I would like is the second row to start from the lowest point in which the first row ended. I know I can solve it with JavaScript - find the longest thumbnail in each row and set the other thumbnails to have that height. Question is, do I have any way of doing it, or something else that can solve my problem, using only with CSS? Update: I don't know beforehand how many items I have in one row. For example, on a small screen I'd have 2 items in a row, while on a bigger screen it'll be 3, so solutions which set when a new row starts aren't good for me.

@LINK:/questions/24586293/cast-closures-blocks
@TITLE:Cast closures/blocks
@CONTENT:In Objective-C, I often pass around blocks. I use them very often to implement patterns that help avoid storing stuff into instance variables, thus avoiding threading/timing issues. For example, I assign them to a CAAnimation via -[CAAnimation setValue:forKey:] so I can execute the block when the animation is finished. (Objective-C can treat blocks as objects; you also can do [someBlock copy] and [someBlock release].) However, trying to use these patterns in Swift together with Objective-C seems to be very difficult. (Edit: and we can see that the language is still in flux: have adapted the code so it works on Xcode6-beta2, previous version worked on Xcode6-beta1.) For example, I can't convert AnyObject back to a block/closure. The following yields an error from the compiler: override func animationDidStop(anim: CAAnimation!, finished flag: Bool)
{
    let completion : AnyObject! = anim.valueForKey("completionClosure")
    (completion as (@objc_block ()->Void))()
    // Cannot convert the expression's type 'Void' to type '@objc_block () -> Void'
}
 I have found a workaround, but it's pretty ugly, IMHO: in my bridging header, I have: static inline id blockToObject(void(^block)())
{
    return block;
}

static inline void callBlockAsObject(id block)
{
    ((void(^)())block)();
}
 And now I can do this in Swift: func someFunc(completion: (@objc_block ()->Void))
{
    let animation = CAKeyframeAnimation(keyPath: "position")
    animation.delegate = self
    animation.setValue(blockToObject(completion), forKey: "completionClosure")
    ¡K
}

override func animationDidStop(anim: CAAnimation!, finished flag: Bool)
{
    let completion : AnyObject! = anim.valueForKey("completionClosure")
    callBlockAsObject(completion)
}
 It works, but I'd need a new function for every block type that I'd like to use and I'm hacking around the compiler which can't be good either. So is there a way to solve this in a pure Swift way?
@CODE:CAAnimation -[CAAnimation setValue:forKey:] [someBlock copy] [someBlock release] AnyObject override func animationDidStop(anim: CAAnimation!, finished flag: Bool)
{
    let completion : AnyObject! = anim.valueForKey("completionClosure")

    // Cannot convert the expression's type 'Void' to type '@objc_block () -> Void'
} static inline id blockToObject(void(^block)())
{
    return block;
}

static inline void callBlockAsObject(id block)
{
    ((void(^)())block)();
} func someFunc(completion: (@objc_block ()->Void))
{
    let animation = CAKeyframeAnimation(keyPath: "position")
    animation.delegate = self
    animation.setValue(blockToObject(completion), forKey: "completionClosure")

}

override func animationDidStop(anim: CAAnimation!, finished flag: Bool)

@LINK:/questions/24447355/best-solution-to-refresh-token-automatically-with-afnetworking
@TITLE:Best solution to refresh token automatically with AFNetworking?
@CONTENT:Once your user is logged in, you get a token (digest or oauth) which you set into your HTTP Authorization header and which gives you the authorization to access your web service. If you store your user's name, password and this token somewhere on the phone (in user defaults, or preferably in the keychain), then your the user is automatically logged in each time the application restarts. But what if your token expires? Then you "simply" need to ask for a new token and if the user did not change his password, then he should be logged in once again automatically. One way to implement this token refreshing operation is to subclass AFHTTPRequestOperation and take care of 401 Unauthorized HTTP Status code in order to ask a new token. When the new token is issued, you can call once again the failed operation which should now succeeds. Then you must register this class so that each AFNetworking request (getPath, postPath, ...) now uses this class. [httpClient registerHTTPOperationClass:[RetryRequestOperation class]]
 Here is an exemple of such a class: static NSInteger const kHTTPStatusCodeUnauthorized = 401;

        // If it succeeds, then the opration is sent again.

 Please, be aware that this code does not work as is, as it relies on external code that depends on your web API, the kind of authorization (digest, oath, ...) and also which kind of framework you use over AFNetworking (RestKit for example). This is quite efficient and has proved to work well with both digest and oauth authorization using RestKit tied to CoreData (in that case RetryRequestOperation is a subclass of RKManagedObjectRequestOperation). My question now is: is this the best way to refresh a token? I am actually wondering if NSURLAuthenticationChallenge could be used to solve this situation in a more elegant manner.

 I've already managed to make it work. But the question is, how can I push the message to certain target users. For example, there are 5 online users namely: user1, user2, user3, user4 and user5. I want the notification to be published to user1 and user2 only. Can you give me any idea on how to achieve this one? I'm thinking of either doing it in the backend or in the frontend. Or there is another way to achieve this using spring. Somebody help me please. Thank you.

@TITLE:docker commit running container
@CONTENT:When committing a running container with docker commit, is this creating a consistent snapshot of the filesystem? I'm considering this approach for backing up containers. You would just have to docker commit <container> <container>:<date> and push it to a local registry. The backup would be incremental, as the commit would just create a new layer. Also would the big amount of layers hurt io performance of the container drastically? Is there a way to remove intermediate layers at a later point in time? Edit By consistent I mean that every application that is designed to survive a power-loss should be able to recover from this snapshots. Basically this means that no file must change after the snapshot is started. Meanwhile I found out that docker supports multiple storage drivers (aufs, devicemapper, btrfs) now. Unfortunately there is hardly any documentation about the differences between them and the options they support.

The first question is that: if a sample satisfied the condition, then it goes to the LEFT branch (if exists), otherwise it goes RIGHT. In my case, if a sample with X[7] > 63521.3984. Then the sample will go to the green box. Correct? The second question is that: when a sample reaches the leaf node, how can I know which category it belongs? In this example, I have three categories to classify. In the red box, there are 91, 212, and 113 samples are satisfied the condition, respectively. But how can I decide the category? I know there is a function clf.predict(sample) to tell the category. Can I do that from the graph??? Many thanks.

{"message":"The requested resource does not support http method 'PUT'."}
 Based on the above response, "PUT" verbs are not accepted. However, I'm unable to figure out where the related handler is configured. The "Put" method of class is declared as follows: [HttpPatch]
[HttpPut]
public HttpResponseMessage Put(Int32 aID, [FromBody] ImpressionModel impressionModel)
{
     bla, bla, bla, bla
}
 I have read and implemented the changes explained in the following threads: - Asp.NET Web API - 405 - HTTP verb used to access this page is not allowed - how to set handler mappings - http://www.asp.net/web-api/overview/testing-and-debugging/troubleshooting-http-405-errors-after-publishing-web-api-applications Nothing has worked as I'm still getting a 405 response when trying to issue a "PUT" command against my Web API project. I even commented out all of the "Handlers" in the ApplicationsHost.config file. Working with VS2012 Premium and IIS Express (I'm assuming it's version 8). I also tried the VS Dev Server but that gave me the same result also. I'm out of ideas. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks Lee

 I am running this in a virtualenv that uses python 2.7. I have had this working off and on today but I can't figure out where the problem is. For one thing, the __init__.py seems to be okay with some imports that come just before: from .database import get_db
from .config import parser
from .views import Endpoints, route
 (I changed the last line to an absolute import. No luck.) Things that I have tried: Rebuilding virtualenv Setting PYTHONPATH Using absolute paths in code Looking for circular imports I am open to further suggestions in how to debug this error. So the mistake I made was to look only at the source tree. The problem was really in the runtime environmment, in my virtualenv. And when I looked there, I found that the desired files were not being installed. The problem, at root, was the setup.py.

@LINK:/questions/23111868/unit-of-work-pattern-implementation
@TITLE:Unit of Work pattern implementation
@CONTENT:I am creating an application with ASP.NET MVC and Entity framework code first. I am using repository and unit of work pattern with influence of from following link. http://www.asp.net/mvc/tutorials/getting-started-with-ef-5-using-mvc-4/implementing-the-repository-and-unit-of-work-patterns-in-an-asp-net-mvc-application Here I have question about the implementation of Unit Of Work in that link unit of work is implemented via directly writing entities in class itself like. public class UnitOfWork : IDisposable
{
    private SchoolContext context = new SchoolContext();
    private GenericRepository<Department> departmentRepository;

    public GenericRepository<Department> DepartmentRepository
    {
        get
        {

            if (this.departmentRepository == null)
            {
                this.departmentRepository = new GenericRepository<Department>(context);
            }
            return departmentRepository;
        }
    }

}
 Do you think that implementation is good enough because every time I add/remove entities I need to change my Unit of work class. I believe that Unit of work should not be dependent on entities. Because in my application based on Client feedback we are going to frequently add/remove entities. I may sound stupid but let me know your views on that.
@CODE:public class UnitOfWork : IDisposable
{
    private SchoolContext context = new SchoolContext();
    private GenericRepository<Department> departmentRepository;

    public GenericRepository<Department> DepartmentRepository
    {
        get
        {

            if (this.departmentRepository == null)
            {

    if ($collection instanceOf PersistentCollection) {
        /** @var PersistentCollection $collection */
        if (false === $collection->isInitialized()) {
            $collection->initialize();

    }

        foreach ($calledMethods as $callMethod => $order) {

            if (true == is_string($first->$callMethod())) {

                // String Compare
                $result = strcasecmp($first->$callMethod(), $second->$callMethod());

            } else {

                // Numeric Compare
                $difference = ($first->$callMethod() - $second->$callMethod());

                $result = (0 != $difference) ? $difference / abs($difference): 0;
            }

            // 'Reverse' result if DESC given
            if ('DESC' == $order) {
                $result *= -1;
            }

            // If we have a result, return it, else continue looping

    foreach ($values as $key => $item) {
        $collection->set($key, $item);

    return $this;
}
 2) Creating a Twig extension, if you need the sorting just in a template (according to Kris http://stackoverflow.com/a/12505347/1148260) use Doctrine\Common\Collections\Collection;

public function sort(Collection $objects, $name, $property = null)
{
    $values = $objects->getValues();
    usort($values, function ($a, $b) use ($name, $property) {
        $name = 'get' . $name;
        if ($property) {
            $property = 'get' . $property;

        } else {
            return strcasecmp($a->$name(), $b->$name());
        }
    });
    return $values;
}
 3) Transforming the collection into an array and then sorting it (according to Benjamin Eberlei https://groups.google.com/d/msg/doctrine-user/zCKG98dPiDY/oOSZBMabebwJ) public function getSortedByFoo()
{
    $arr = $this->arrayCollection->toArray();
    usort($arr, function($a, $b) {
    if ($a->getFoo() > $b->getFoo()) {
        return -1;
    }
    //...
    });
    return $arr;
}
 4) Using ArrayIterator to sort the collection (according to nifr http://stackoverflow.com/a/16707694/1148260) $iterator = $collection->getIterator();
$iterator->uasort(function ($a, $b) {
    return ($a->getPropery() < $b->getProperty()) ? -1 : 1;
});
$collection = new ArrayCollection(iterator_to_array($iterator));
 5) Creating a service to gather the ordered collection and then replace the unordered one (I have not an example but I think it is pretty clear). I think this is the ugliest solution. Which is the best solution according to you experience? Do you have other suggestions to order a collection in a more effective/elegant way? Thank you very much.

@TITLE:Android OkHttp with Basic Authentication
@CONTENT:I'm using the OkHttp library for a new project and am impressed with its ease of use. I now have a need to use Basic Authentication. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of working sample code. I'm seeking an example of how to pass username / password credentials to the OkAuthenticator when an HTTP 401 header is encountered. I viewed this answer: Retrofit POST request w/ Basic HTTP Authentication: "Cannot retry streamed HTTP body" but it didn't get me too far. The samples on the OkHttp github repo didn't feature an authentication-based sample either. Does anyone have a gist or other code sample to get me pointed in the right direction?

@TITLE:On x86, when the OS disables interrupts, do they vanish, or do they queue and 'wait' for interrupts to come back on?
@CONTENT:My platform is x86 and x86-64, on Windows. The point of the interrupt priority system is to have the highest priority interrupt beat out the others. To enforce this, I'm guessing that Windows will disable all interrupts of lower level completely, until the ISR for the higher-level interrupt is complete. But if the CPU isn't listening to interrupts, what happens? Do they just silently disappear? Or are they queued in hardware, waiting for interrupts to become enabled again? If they are stored, where? Are there limitations to how many can queue up? What happens if too many interrupts go unprocessed? What instrumentation exists to detect issues, in case there are rare conditions where interrupt handling gets backlogged?

 Based on the above response, "PUT" verbs are not accepted. However, I'm unable to figure out where the related handler is configured. The "Put" method of class is declared as follows: [HttpPatch]
[HttpPut]
public HttpResponseMessage Put(Int32 aID, [FromBody] ImpressionModel impressionModel)

 I have read and implemented the changes explained in the following threads: - Asp.NET Web API - 405 - HTTP verb used to access this page is not allowed - how to set handler mappings - http://www.asp.net/web-api/overview/testing-and-debugging/troubleshooting-http-405-errors-after-publishing-web-api-applications Nothing has worked as I'm still getting a 405 response when trying to issue a "PUT" command against my Web API project. I even commented out all of the "Handlers" in the ApplicationsHost.config file. Working with VS2012 Premium and IIS Express (I'm assuming it's version 8). I also tried the VS Dev Server but that gave me the same result also. I'm out of ideas. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks Lee

 I am running this in a virtualenv that uses python 2.7. I have had this working off and on today but I can't figure out where the problem is. For one thing, the __init__.py seems to be okay with some imports that come just before: from .database import get_db
from .config import parser
from .views import Endpoints, route
 (I changed the last line to an absolute import. No luck.) Things that I have tried: Rebuilding virtualenv Setting PYTHONPATH Using absolute paths in code Looking for circular imports I am open to further suggestions in how to debug this error. So the mistake I made was to look only at the source tree. The problem was really in the runtime environmment, in my virtualenv. And when I looked there, I found that the desired files were not being installed. The problem, at root, was the setup.py.

@TITLE:Unit of Work pattern implementation
@CONTENT:I am creating an application with ASP.NET MVC and Entity framework code first. I am using repository and unit of work pattern with influence of from following link. http://www.asp.net/mvc/tutorials/getting-started-with-ef-5-using-mvc-4/implementing-the-repository-and-unit-of-work-patterns-in-an-asp-net-mvc-application Here I have question about the implementation of Unit Of Work in that link unit of work is implemented via directly writing entities in class itself like. public class UnitOfWork : IDisposable
{
    private SchoolContext context = new SchoolContext();
    private GenericRepository<Department> departmentRepository;

    public GenericRepository<Department> DepartmentRepository
    {
        get
        {

            if (this.departmentRepository == null)
            {
                this.departmentRepository = new GenericRepository<Department>(context);
            }
            return departmentRepository;
        }
    }

}
 Do you think that implementation is good enough because every time I add/remove entities I need to change my Unit of work class. I believe that Unit of work should not be dependent on entities. Because in my application based on Client feedback we are going to frequently add/remove entities. I may sound stupid but let me know your views on that.

@TITLE:Ordering Doctrine Collection based on associated Entity when it is not possible to use the @orderBy annotation
@CONTENT:I would like to understand the best way to order a Doctrine Collection based on associated Entity. In this case, it is not possible to use the @orderBy annotation. I have found 5 solutions on the Internet. 1) Adding a method to the AbstractEntity (according to Ian Belter http://stackoverflow.com/a/22183527/1148260) /**
 * This method will change the order of elements within a Collection based on the given method.
 * It preserves array keys to avoid any direct access issues but will order the elements
 * within the array so that iteration will be done in the requested order.
 *
 * @param string $property
 * @param array  $calledMethods
 *
 * @return $this
 * @throws \InvalidArgumentException
 */
public function orderCollection($property, $calledMethods = array())
{
    /** @var Collection $collection */
    $collection = $this->$property;

    // If we have a PersistentCollection, make sure it is initialized, then unwrap it so we
    // can edit the underlying ArrayCollection without firing the changed method on the
    // PersistentCollection. We're only going in and changing the order of the underlying ArrayCollection.
    if ($collection instanceOf PersistentCollection) {
        /** @var PersistentCollection $collection */
        if (false === $collection->isInitialized()) {
            $collection->initialize();
        }
        $collection = $collection->unwrap();
    }

    if (!$collection instanceOf ArrayCollection) {
        throw new InvalidArgumentException('First argument of orderCollection must reference a PersistentCollection|ArrayCollection within $this.');
    }

    $uaSortFunction = function($first, $second) use ($calledMethods) {

        // Loop through $calledMethods until we find a orderable difference
        foreach ($calledMethods as $callMethod => $order) {

            // If no order was set, swap k => v values and set ASC as default.
            if (false == in_array($order, array('ASC', 'DESC')) ) {
                $callMethod = $order;
                $order = 'ASC';
            }

            if (true == is_string($first->$callMethod())) {

                // String Compare
                $result = strcasecmp($first->$callMethod(), $second->$callMethod());

            } else {

                // Numeric Compare
                $difference = ($first->$callMethod() - $second->$callMethod());
                // This will convert non-zero $results to 1 or -1 or zero values to 0
                // i.e. -22/22 = -1; 0.4/0.4 = 1;
                $result = (0 != $difference) ? $difference / abs($difference): 0;
            }

            // 'Reverse' result if DESC given
            if ('DESC' == $order) {
                $result *= -1;
            }

            // If we have a result, return it, else continue looping
            if (0 !== (int) $result) {
                return (int) $result;
            }
        }

        // No result, return 0
        return 0;
    };

    // Get the values for the ArrayCollection and sort it using the function
    $values = $collection->getValues();
    uasort($values, $uaSortFunction);

    // Clear the current collection values and reintroduce in new order.
    $collection->clear();
    foreach ($values as $key => $item) {
        $collection->set($key, $item);
    }

    return $this;
}
 2) Creating a Twig extension, if you need the sorting just in a template (according to Kris http://stackoverflow.com/a/12505347/1148260) use Doctrine\Common\Collections\Collection;

public function sort(Collection $objects, $name, $property = null)
{
    $values = $objects->getValues();
    usort($values, function ($a, $b) use ($name, $property) {
        $name = 'get' . $name;
        if ($property) {
            $property = 'get' . $property;
            return strcasecmp($a->$name()->$property(), $b->$name()->$property());
        } else {
            return strcasecmp($a->$name(), $b->$name());
        }
    });
    return $values;
}
 3) Transforming the collection into an array and then sorting it (according to Benjamin Eberlei https://groups.google.com/d/msg/doctrine-user/zCKG98dPiDY/oOSZBMabebwJ) public function getSortedByFoo()
{
    $arr = $this->arrayCollection->toArray();
    usort($arr, function($a, $b) {
    if ($a->getFoo() > $b->getFoo()) {
        return -1;
    }
    //...
    });
    return $arr;
}
 4) Using ArrayIterator to sort the collection (according to nifr http://stackoverflow.com/a/16707694/1148260) $iterator = $collection->getIterator();
$iterator->uasort(function ($a, $b) {
    return ($a->getPropery() < $b->getProperty()) ? -1 : 1;
});
$collection = new ArrayCollection(iterator_to_array($iterator));
 5) Creating a service to gather the ordered collection and then replace the unordered one (I have not an example but I think it is pretty clear). I think this is the ugliest solution. Which is the best solution according to you experience? Do you have other suggestions to order a collection in a more effective/elegant way? Thank you very much.
@CODE:/**
 * This method will change the order of elements within a Collection based on the given method.
 * It preserves array keys to avoid any direct access issues but will order the elements

@TITLE:On x86, when the OS disables interrupts, do they vanish, or do they queue and 'wait' for interrupts to come back on?
@CONTENT:My platform is x86 and x86-64, on Windows. The point of the interrupt priority system is to have the highest priority interrupt beat out the others. To enforce this, I'm guessing that Windows will disable all interrupts of lower level completely, until the ISR for the higher-level interrupt is complete. But if the CPU isn't listening to interrupts, what happens? Do they just silently disappear? Or are they queued in hardware, waiting for interrupts to become enabled again? If they are stored, where? Are there limitations to how many can queue up? What happens if too many interrupts go unprocessed? What instrumentation exists to detect issues, in case there are rare conditions where interrupt handling gets backlogged?

@TITLE:Huge XML file to text files
@CONTENT:I have a huge XML file(15 GB). I want to convert a 'text' tag in XML file to a single page. Sample XML file: <root>
    <page>
        <id> 1 </id>
        <text>
        .... 1000 to 50000 lines of text
        </text>
    </page>
    ... Like wise 2 Million `page` tags
</root>
 I've initially used DOM parser, but it throws JAVA OUT OF MEMORY(Valid). Now, I've written JAVA code using STAX. It works good, but performance is really slow. This is the code I've written:  XMLEventReader xMLEventReader = XMLInputFactory.newInstance().createXMLEventReader(new FileInputStream(filePath));
    while(xMLEventReader.hasNext()){
      xmlEvent = xMLEventReader.nextEvent();

    switch(xmlEvent.getEventType()){
    case XMLStreamConstants.START_ELEMENT:
    if( element == "text")
      isText    = true;
    break;
    case XMLStreamConstants.CHARACTERS:
      chars = (Characters) xmlEvent;
      if(! (chars.isWhiteSpace() || chars.isIgnorableWhiteSpace()))
               if(isText)
              pageContent += chars.getData() + '\n';
      break;
    case XMLStreamConstants.END_ELEMENT:
      String elementEnd = (((EndElement) xmlEvent).getName()).getLocalPart();
      if( elementEnd == "text" )
      {
          createFile(id, pageContent);
          pageContent = "";
          isText = false;
      }
      break;
    }
}
 This code is working good.(Ignore about any minor errors). According to my understanding, XMLStreamConstants.CHARACTERS iterates for each and everyline of text tag. If TEXT tag has 10000 lines in it, XMLStreamConstants.CHARACTERS iterates for next 10000 lines. Is there any better way to improve the performance..?

@LINK:/questions/22173454/jquery-scrolltop-returns-0-for-all-elements
@TITLE:jQuery scrollTop() returns 0 for all elements
@CONTENT:At my job we have a one page site I created with AngularJS. We're using the ui-router plugin (version 0.2.0). Recently I've noticed that when moving from one state to another, the window isn't scrolled to the top. I even tried to scroll it to the top manually using jQuery's scrollTop() function on every state change (using the $stateChangeSuccess event). But it didn't work. So I started investigating, and I've noticed that scrollTop() is returning 0 for every element on the page. Not only that, but when I print the window.scrollY to the console I get 0 (no matter where I'm at on the page). Not only in my code, but even if I just write it in the chrome dev tools console. I've written several apps with AngularJS and ui-router, and it only happens in this particular one. I've checked to see if I have overwritten the scrollTop() function or even the window.scrollY field, but haven't found anything. I've tried using the ui-view with autoscroll="true" and autoscroll="false", but it didn't make a difference. I also tried giving the html and the body elements height:100%, and I also tried it without. But nothing. I really don't know what to do next. I wasn't able to reproduce the problem, but if you think there is any code I should post here that could be of any help, I'll be glad to do that. Thanks! EDIT: I've run this function on the console: var l = $('*').length;
for(var i = 0; i < l; i++) {
    var elem = $('*:eq(' + i + ')');
    if(elem.scrollTop() > 0) {
        console.log(elem, elem.scrollTop());
    }
}
 The function printed out only one element with it's top scroll. The element is a wrapping div that holds the whole content and the main view (I have nested views in my app). If I use scrollTop(0) on this element I get what I wanted, but it only deals with the symptom, and not the real problem.
@CODE:scrollTop() $stateChangeSuccess scrollTop() window.scrollY scrollTop() window.scrollY ui-view autoscroll="true" autoscroll="false" html body height:100% var l = $('*').length;

@CONTENT:I have an app that has a list of UITableViewCells. By default, the cells are set to a certain height (lets say 100) to show only some basic information. When the user clicks on a cell the height changes to 150 to show more actions that were previously not seen. This works without a problem on iOS 7.0.0-7.0.5. I'm testing on an iPhone 5s running iOS 7.1 beta 5 and seeing some drawing issues with the cells. Here's how it looks on iOS 7.0... versions which is what is expected. When the cell is collapsed, the buttons that are positioned past the height of the cell are hidden and when the cell is expanded to a height to show the buttons, they are visible. Cell expanded: The following is the cell when collapsed: Here are the issues I'm seeing with iOS 7.1 beta. Im curious if this is just something that is a problem with the beta or if I'll have to rethink how this is being coded currently. As far as I can tell this has been present since the first beta of 7.1. As you can see, the button which was previously hidden is now still showing even though the cell is collapsed. Is this an issue with the beta that anyone else has seen or is this expected behavior now? Thank you for you help!

@TITLE:Do you really need to check for Google Play services to use AdMob?
@CONTENT:Google's instructions here say that if you want to use AdMob in your Android app via Google Play services you must ensure the user's device has the Google Play services APK installed. However, I'm having terrible trouble trying to get this working; and I've noticed that even if I uninstall the Google Play services updates on my phone (and don't bother checking if the services is available) my app is still perfectly able to retrieve and display ads! This is despite errors in LogCat like the following: W/GooglePlayServicesUtil(26558): Google Play services out of date.  Requires 4132500 but found 3159130
 Presumably my phone still has the original version of Google Play services installed when it came out the factory. I'm just wondering whether I really need to check for Google Play services being available to use AdMob successfully. Right now it appears not. Please can someone tell me why I should bother having to make this check. Is it to handle case 4 at that Google link I gave above...? The Google Play services APK is missing or disabled on the device, which might happen if the user explicitly uninstalls or disables it.

@LINK:/questions/21406973/wrapping-synchronous-code-into-asynchronous-call
@TITLE:Wrapping synchronous code into asynchronous call
@CONTENT:I have a method in ASP.NET application, that consumes quite a lot of time to complete. A call to this method might occur up to 3 times during one user request, depending on the cache state and parameters that user provides. Each call takes about 1-2 seconds to complete. The method itself is synchronous call to the service and there is no possibility to override the implementation. So the synchronous call to the service looks something like the following: public OutputModel Calculate(InputModel input)
{
    // do some stuff
    return Service.LongRunningCall(input);
}
 And the usage of the method is (note, that call of method may happen more than once): private void MakeRequest()
{
    // a lot of other stuff: preparing requests, sending/processing other requests, etc.
    var myOutput = Calculate(myInput);
    // stuff again
}
 I tried to change the implementation from my side to provide simultaneous work of this method, and here is what I came to so far. public async Task<OutputModel> CalculateAsync(InputModel input)
{
    return await Task.Run(() =>
    {
        return Calculate(input);
    });
}
 Usage (part of "do other stuff" code runs simultaneously with the call to service): private async Task MakeRequest()
{
    // do some stuff
    var task = CalculateAsync(myInput);
    // do other stuff
    var myOutput = await task;
    // some more stuff
}
 My question is the following. Do I use the right approach to speed up the execution in ASP.NET application or am I doing unnecessary job trying to run synchronous code asynchronously? Can anyone explain why the second approach is not an option in ASP.NET (if it is really not)? Also, if such approach is applicable, do I need to call such method asynchronously if it is the only call we might perform at the moment (I have such case, when no other stuff there is to do while waiting for completion)? Most of the articles in the net on this topic covers using async-await approach with the code, that already provides awaitable methods, but that's not my case. Here is the nice article describing my case, which doesn't describe the situation of parallel calls, declining the option to wrap sync call, but in my opinion my situation is exactly the occasion to do it. Thanks in advance for help and tips.
@CODE:public OutputModel Calculate(InputModel input)
{
    // do some stuff
    return Service.LongRunningCall(input);
} private void MakeRequest()
{

@TITLE:Huge byte[] in my app after HPROF
@CONTENT:From time to time, especially when implementing new functionalities in my app, I use DDMS + HPROF to analyze memory and heap use. As the App doesn't seem to have any performance-ANR issues and everything works smoothly, initially I didn't care about it - but now, as I see it's approximately always the same size, I'm wondering what the damn can it be. Everytime I run a HPROF, I check the Leak suspects tab. There's always an android.graphics.Bitmap instance that takes approximately 25% of all the used heap. I wanted to know a bit further what's that about, so I opened the dominator tree, and saw this: So esentially there's a huge byte[] instance that is retaining a lot of heap, and never gets released. According to this, I copied the value of that byte[], dumped it into a .data file, opened with Gimp, and there's the result: So basically, it looks like the "alpha(0)" part of a PNG image. Having in consideration the following facts: All my image files are <8K in size Just some of them are PNG - the remaining I was able to convert to JPG, I did No matters if I add further images, the size of that byte[] has been always aproximately the same from the beggining of the app (4 months ago) To debug it, I tried to remove any image file from the drawable and drawable-xxx folders and run the app without any drawable resources, and the byte[] was still there I removed almost all layouts and let just the basic funcionality, and same result In the Dominator tree, the root class is android.graphics.Bitmap Anyone knows what it this byte[] and if I should do anything to free it up? Any help appreciated!

@TITLE:Understanding JVM Memory Allocation and Java Out of Memory: Heap Space
@CONTENT:I'm looking into really understanding how memory allocation works in the JVM. I'm writing an application in which I'm getting Out of Memory: Heap Space exceptions. I understand that I can pass in VM arguments such as Xms and Xmx to up the heap space that the JVM allocates for the running process. This is one possible solution to the problem, or I can inspect my code for memory leaks and fix the issue there. My questions are: 1) How does the JVM actually allocate memory for itself? How does this relate to how the OS communicates available memory to the JVM? Or more generally, how does memory allocation for any process actually work? 2) How does virtual memory come into play? Let's say you have a system with 32GB of physical memory and you allocate all 32GB to your Java process. Let's say that your process actually consumes all 32GB of memory, how can we enforce the process to use virtual memory instead of running into OOM exceptions? Thanks.

 I'm building with the release keystore and testing on a several real devices running 4.4. I've tried: Using the PlusShare.Builder(activity) constructor (without plusClient), no change. Using addCallToAction(label, uri, deeplink) instead of setContentDeepLinkId. There is no call to action button, and clicking the post goes to uri and not the deep link. Triple checking "Deep linking: Enabled" is set correctly in the developers console. Building without proguard, no change. Uninstalling the app then clicking the link (supposed to open the play store entry), does nothing. Signing with a different key. Plus sign in fails (as expected). Using different versions of play services (4.0.30 vs 3.2.+). adb shell setprop log.tag.GooglePlusPlatform VERBOSE does not generate any log messages. Fetching my API access token and verifying it has auth/plus.login, it does. Can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong? Thanks!! Update: This is now working, apparently fixed by a Google Play Services update.
@CODE:Intent shareIntent = new PlusShare.Builder(this, plusClient)
    .setText("Testing deep link")
    .setType("text/plain")
    .setContentDeepLinkId("deeplink",

@LINK:/questions/20474303/using-c-function-from-other-package-in-rcpp
@TITLE:using C function from other package in Rcpp
@CONTENT:I'm trying to call a C routine from the cubature package in a c++ function to perform multidimensional integration. The basic R example I'm trying to reproduce is library(cubature)
integrand <- function(x) sin(x)
adaptIntegrate(integrand, 0, pi)
 I could just call this R function from Rcpp following this recipe from the gallery, but there would be some performance penalty in switching back and forth from c/c++ to R. It seems more sensible to directly call the C function from C++. The C routine adapt_integrate is exported from cubature with  // R_RegisterCCallable("cubature", "adapt_integrate", (DL_FUNC) adapt_integrate);
 I don't understand how to call it from c++, however. Here's my lame attempt, sourceCpp(code = '
#include <Rcpp.h>
using namespace Rcpp;

// [[Rcpp::export]]
double integrand(double x){
 return(sin(x));
}

// [[Rcpp::depends(cubature)]]
// [[Rcpp::export]]
Rcpp::List integratecpp(double llim, double ulim)
{
  Rcpp::Function p_cubature = R_GetCCallable("cubature", "adapt_integrate");

  Rcpp::List result = p_cubature(integrand, llim, ulim);
  return(result);
}
'
)

integratecpp(0, pi)
 This fails to compile; clearly I'm doing something very silly and missing some important steps to convert the output of R_GetCCallable into an Rcpp::Function (or call it directly?). I've read several related posts dealing with function pointers, but haven't seen an example using an external C function.
@CODE:library(cubature)
integrand <- function(x) sin(x)
adaptIntegrate(integrand, 0, pi) adapt_integrate cubature // R_RegisterCCallable("cubature", "adapt_integrate", (DL_FUNC) adapt_integrate); sourceCpp(code = '
#include <Rcpp.h>
using namespace Rcpp;

// [[Rcpp::export]]
double integrand(double x){
 return(sin(x));
}

// [[Rcpp::depends(cubature)]]
// [[Rcpp::export]]

{
  Rcpp::Function p_cubature = R_GetCCallable("cubature", "adapt_integrate");

  Rcpp::List result = p_cubature(integrand, llim, ulim);

 I would like the user to be able to enter the details for the photo then post the model the the controller. My controller action is as follows: [HttpPost]

My problem is that although the model is posted to the controller ok, the Description, Date and IsActive flags are populated ok - the Image data is null.

Confirm that the declaration is correct, that the assembly and all its dependencies are available, and that the task contains a public class that implements Microsoft.Build.Framework.ITask. Is there some way to install this separately? What is this assembly included with by default? UPDATE: This also manifests itself when looking for the EntityClean task. I'm inclined to think that it checks the bin first, since another developer who was running it fine tried a clean / rebuild and then this started showing up.

@CONTENT:Are there other possibilities to style an AngularJS application in a mobile friendly way than CSS? I am planning a mobile app and want to use AngularJS for the logic and data binding but I don't want to style everything on my own with CSS. The AngularJS FAQ says that it uses jQuery: Does Angular use the jQuery library? Yes, Angular can use jQuery if it's present in your app when the application is being bootstrapped. If jQuery is not present in your script path, Angular falls back to its own implementation of the subset of jQuery that we call jQLite. Due to a change to use on()/off() rather than bind()/unbind(), Angular 1.2 only operates with jQuery 1.7.1 or above. but there is no information I have found in the FAQ on which way AngularJS + jQuery can be used. As you can see I have tried to get the information using AngularsJS FAQ, but could not found it. Have you found some example(s) of AngularJS with jQuery Mobile for styling?

 For reference, the content of build.grade file (I use Gradle) is as follows: (following M. Deinum's suggestion, I removed the dependency for org.apache.commons.dbcp.) buildscript {
    repositories {
        maven { url "http://repo.spring.io/libs-snapshot" }
        mavenLocal()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-gradle-plugin:0.5.0.M5")
    }
}

apply plugin: 'java'

apply plugin: 'idea'
apply plugin: 'spring-boot'

    testCompile("junit:junit:4.11")
}

task wrapper(type: Wrapper) {
    gradleVersion = '1.8'

 And this is Application.java file, which is the main source file. package com.sample.server;

@TITLE:How to reload a file via require.js triggered from the browsers js console
@CONTENT:Having a text file (underscore templates) loaded by require.js on initial app start: define(['text!templates/template.html'], function(Template){ ... };
 When i am now making changes to this file and want require to reload that single file without me having to reload the whole page and restart the whole app, is this possible? I'd like to trigger this from the javascript console in the browser. Use case is a scenario with underscore templates loaded via require.js, when making changes to one of those template files i could easily "inject" the new file to the running app, trigger the views render method manually and see the changes without having to start from the very beginning by reloading everything. Thanks for your ideas.

My questions are: What is the best(your favorite) framework to develop native mobile applications with web client side(html\javascript\css)? How easy is to build and maintain those applications in multi-platforms(iOS\Android\BlackBerry) parallel? Does it has many exceptions between different platforms(iOS\Android\BlackBerry) ? What are the requirements to develop my app for iOS ? should I need a special IDE with special SDK ? I must have mac ? Many thanks :]

 Subquery t10 completes immediately, but the entire query (t16) requires 4 minutes to complete. Q1. Why calculation times of identical subqueries on the same data are very different? Q2. It looks like a bug as it runs very fast on Oracle 9 and very slow on Oracle 11. In fact, every select statement with long and complex with-clause would behave the same way. Is it a known bug? (I don't have access to metalink) What workaround is recommended? Q3. I must write code for Oracle 11 and I must do all my calculations in single select statement. I can't split my long statement in two separate statements to speed it up. Does there exist a hint in Oracle (or maybe some trick) to make the whole query (t16) be completed in a reasonable time (e.g., within one second)? I tried to find such one but to no avail. BTW, execution plan is excellent, and cost behaves as a linear function (not exponential) of number of steps.

@TITLE:call async method without await #2
@CONTENT:I have an async method: public async Task<bool> ValidateRequestAsync(string userName, string password)
{
    using (HttpClient client = new HttpClient())
    {
        HttpResponseMessage response = await client.GetAsync(url);
        string stringResponse = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();

 I call this method like this: bool isValid = await ValidateRequestAsync("user1", "pass1");
 Can i call the same method from an synchronous method, without using await keyword? Ex: public bool ValidateRequest(string userName, string password)
{
    return ValidateRequestAsync(userName, password).Result;
}
 I think this will cause a deadlock. EDIT Calling the method like above makes the call never end. (The method doesn't reaches the end anymore)

@CONTENT:In "Almost always auto" article Herb Sutter lists several reasons for declaring variables using auto keyword. He says that actual variable type can be automatically deduced by IDE and shown by hovering over variable name. I would like to know which IDEs and text editors (or plugins) currently support "auto" variable type deduction. Edit: List of IDEs from answers: Visual Studio 201x Eclipse Qt Creator 2.7.0 KDevelop 4.5.1 Text editors What about Vim, Emacs, Sublime Text, etc. - are there plugins which supports type deduction?

@LINK:/questions/19545898/asp-net-web-api-2-attribute-routing-controller-name
@TITLE:ASP.NET Web API 2 Attribute routing controller name
@CONTENT:In WebApiConfig.cs i have the following public static void Register(HttpConfiguration config)
{

   config.MapHttpAttributeRoutes(); 

   config.Services.Replace(typeof(IHttpControllerSelector),
               new MyApiControllerSelector(config));

   //code omitted for brevity
}
 then in the MyApiControllerSelector.cs i want to get the controller public override HttpControllerDescriptor SelectController(HttpRequestMessage request)
        {           
            var routeData = request.GetRouteData();           

            var controllerName = (string)routeData.Values["controller"];

            //code omitted for brevity
        }
 Pretty simple and it worked great but now using attribute routing i think it needs a different approach? - as i can't seem to find a simple way I've tried var controllerName = request.GetActionDescriptor().ControllerDescriptor.ControllerName;
 which doesn't work. Then reading the source with debugging lead me to request.GetRouteData().Values["MS_SubRoutes"] So now I have string subRoutesKey = "MS_SubRoutes";

var attributedRoutesData = routeData.Values[subRoutesKey] as IEnumerable<IHttpRouteData>; 
var subRouteData = attributedRoutesData.FirstOrDefault();

var actions = (ReflectedHttpActionDescriptor[])subRouteData.Route.DataTokens["actions"];
var controllerName = actions[0].ControllerDescriptor.ControllerName;
 which works but it has to be a simpler way? UPDATE @KiranChalla asked what's my use case so i'm posting the remaining code. Basically i'm parsing version media type Accept: application/vnd.app.{resource}.v{version}+json from request and returning a HttpControllerDescriptor depending on the version.             HttpControllerDescriptor oldControllerDescriptor;
            if (controllers.TryGetValue(controllerName, out oldControllerDescriptor))

@TITLE:AFNetworking 500 response body
@CONTENT:I've been using AFNetworking 2.0 in my app. I've noticed that if my web-service returns a 500 status code I do not get the body of the response. Here is an example of my php code try
{
    $conn = new PDO( "sqlsrv:server=$serverName;Database = $database", $uid, $pwd);
    $conn->setAttribute( PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION );
    return $conn;
}

catch( PDOException $e )
{
    $response->status(500);
    echo( "Connection Error: " . $e->getMessage() );
}
 If I use a simple rest client this is an example of a response body. Connection Error: SQLSTATE[08001]: [Microsoft][SQL Server Native Client 11.0]SQL Server Network Interfaces: Error Locating Server/Instance Specified [xFFFFFFFF]. 
 However this seems to be the only response I can get from AFNetworking Error Domain=NSCocoaErrorDomain Code=3840 "The operation couldn¡¦t be completed. (Cocoa error 3840.)" (JSON text did not start with array or object and option to allow fragments not set.) UserInfo=0x15e58fa0 {NSDebugDescription=JSON text did not start with array or object and option to allow fragments not set.}
 This is the part of my objective-c code that does this. ...} failure:^(NSURLSessionDataTask *task, NSError *error) {

        NSLog(@"%@",error.description);

    }];

    + (MSMAMobileAPIClient *)sharedClient {
        static MSMAMobileAPIClient *_sharedClient = nil;

@TITLE:Map versus FlatMap on String
@CONTENT:Listening to the Collections lecture from Functional Programming Principles in Scala, I saw this example: scala> val s = "Hello World"

scala> s.flatMap(c => ("." + c)) // prepend each element with a period
res5: String = .H.e.l.l.o. .W.o.r.l.d
 Then, I was curious why Mr. Odersky didn't use a map here. But, when I tried map, I got a different result than I expected. scala> s.map(c => ("." + c))
res8: scala.collection.immutable.IndexedSeq[String] = Vector(.H, .e, .l, .l, .o, 
                                                          ". ", .W, .o, .r, .l, 
 I expected that above call to return a String, since I'm map-ing, i.e. applying a function to each item in the "sequence," and then returning a new "sequence." However, I could perform a map rather than flatmap for a List[String]: scala> val sList = s.toList
sList: List[Char] = List(H, e, l, l, o,  , W, o, r, l, d)

scala> sList.map(c => "." + c)
res9: List[String] = List(.H, .e, .l, .l, .o, ". ", .W, .o, .r, .l, .d)
 Why was a IndexedSeq[String] the return type of calling map on the String?
@CODE:scala> val s = "Hello World"

scala> s.flatMap(c => ("." + c)) // prepend each element with a period
res5: String = .H.e.l.l.o. .W.o.r.l.d map scala> s.map(c => ("." + c))
res8: scala.collection.immutable.IndexedSeq[String] = Vector(.H, .e, .l, .l, .o, 
                                                          ". ", .W, .o, .r, .l, map map flatmap List[String] scala> val sList = s.toList
sList: List[Char] = List(H, e, l, l, o,  , W, o, r, l, d)

scala> sList.map(c => "." + c)
res9: List[String] = List(.H, .e, .l, .l, .o, ". ", .W, .o, .r, .l, .d) IndexedSeq[String] map

@TITLE:Why does this specialized char_traits<uint8_t> and codecvt<uint8_t> for use with the basic_ifstream template throw std::bad_cast?
@CONTENT:There are already questions here on Stackoverflow asking why basic_fstream<uint8_t> doesn't work. The answers say that char_traits is only specialized for char and wchar_t (plus char16_t, char32_t in C++11) and you should stick with basic_fstream<char> to read binary data and cast it if required. Well darn it, that isn't good enough! :) None of the answers (that I can find) say how to specialize char_traits<uint8_t> and use it with a basic_fstream template, or if it's even possible. So I thought I'd try implement it myself. The following compiles without error when using Visual Studio Express 2013 RC on Windows 7 64bit and with g++-4.7 on Kubuntu GNU/Linux 13.04 64bit. However it throws a std::bad_cast exception at runtime. I don't have access to clang++ with libc++ to test that combination. #include <cinttypes>

@CONTENT:Can i upgrade the PHP version under wampserver instead of whole? Because current latest version of wampserver gives 5.4.3 version, but the latest version of php is 5.5.4. How can i upgrade it? EDIT : Wampserver provides either 5.4.3 or older version. What I'm trying to do is Download latest PHP version from php's official site and than copy that into the wampserver. So that i can select toggle between newer and older version. This is how wampserver control panel will look like after adding a version of php http://i.stack.imgur.com/0pOx3.png http://i.stack.imgur.com/joSf3.png I GOT MY ANSWER : A type of handler is required to handle PHP 5.5, which is not built current handler supports 5.4 < versions. The handler is provided by IONCUBE. This is what i found - "Ioncube for PHP5.5 is not yet released as of 13/09/2013, they say they are waiting for PHP 5.5 to become stable and secure and hosting providers to adopt PHP 5.5 before they release their upgrade. They comment that it can take a year or more for hosting companies to adopt new versions of PHP and this I guess is their schedule." Thanks http://stackoverflow.com/users/2310830/riggsfolly !!

@TITLE:POST body JSON using Retrofit
@CONTENT:I'm trying to POST a JSONObject using the Retrofit library, but when I see the request at the receiving end, the content-length is 0. In the RestService interface: @Headers({
        "Content-type: application/json"
})
@POST("/api/v1/user/controller")
void registerController( 
     @Body JSONObject registrationBundle, 
     @Header("x-company-device-token") String companyDeviceToken,

    mApplication.mSession.getCredentials().getDeviceGuid(),
    new Callback<JSONObject>() {

 And I'm certain that the registrationBundle, which is a JSONObject isn't null or empty (the other fields are certainly fine). At the moment the request is made, it logs out as: {"zip":19312,"useAccountZip":false,"controllerName":"mine","registrationCode":"GLD94Q"}. On the receiving end of the request, I see that the request has Content-type: application/json but has Content-length: 0. Is there any reason why sending JSON in the body like this isn't working? Am I missing something simple in using Retrofit?

@LINK:/questions/19095165/should-superviews-gesture-cancel-subviews-gesture-in-ios-7
@TITLE:Should superview's gesture cancel subview's gesture in iOS 7?
@CONTENT:For several years now I've operated under the assumption that if a superview and its subview both have gesture recognizers, the subview would receive the touches first and cancel out the superview's gesture. Until iOS 7 this assumption never failed me, allowing me to add gestures to subviews confident the superview's gestures wouldn't interfere. But in iOS 7, the superview will randomly receive the touches first and cancel out the subview's gestures. This happens somewhat rarely, which made the problem hard to spot. I first experienced this problem as buttons that couldn't be tapped using UITapGestureRecognizer... again, very rarely. Usually the buttons would work until they didn't. Made you kind of question your sanity. So I rolled my own TapGestureRecognizer and discovered that superview taps were canceling their subview's taps on occasion. It's never done this in any previous version of iOS, but I'm wondering if this behavior was simply never promised. I thought the subview's gesture was supposed to cancel it's superview's gesture (unless otherwise specified by a delegate). Is this wrong or is this a bug? Please Note: I'm not asking how to handle the situation. I'm asking if anyone knows whether my assumption is incorrect. I'm already rearranging views, dynamically adding/removing gestures and creating rather complex implementations of gestureRecognizer:shouldReceiveTouch: to remedy the situation. It's not fun, but I can work around the problem.

@TITLE:Static Vs. Dynamic Binding in Java
@CONTENT:I'm currently doing an assignment for one of my classes, and in it, I have to give examples, using Java syntax, of static and dynamic binding. I understand the basic concept, that static binding happens at compile time and dynamic binding happens at runtime, but I can't figure out how they actually work specifically. I found an example of static binding online that gives this example: public static void callEat(Animal animal) {
    System.out.println("Animal is eating");
}

public static void callEat(Dog dog) {
    System.out.println("Dog is eating");
}

public static void main(String args[])
{
    Animal a = new Dog();
    callEat(a);
}
 And that this would print "animal is eating" because the call to callEat uses static binding, but I'm unsure as to why this is considered static binding. So far none of the sources I've seen have managed to explain this in a way that I can follow.
@CODE:public static void callEat(Animal animal) {
    System.out.println("Animal is eating");
}

public static void callEat(Dog dog) {
    System.out.println("Dog is eating");
}

public static void main(String args[])
{
    Animal a = new Dog();
    callEat(a);
} callEat

 Which calls the GET method. I checked the Apress website but they don't seem to have any forums and the current source code is in VS 2012 which I'm not using. I examined the source files and they seem to think the former approach should work. Is the former approach no longer supported?

@TITLE:Maintain scrollTop while inserting new sections above the current viewed elements (without glitching)
@CONTENT:Here's one for the real JQuery UI geniuses: We have a extremely long form with sections loaded on demand (e.g. when an index/navigation is clicked, or as we scroll near the edges of the current section). When I load sections below the currently viewed section, this does not affect the current scrolling (i.e. scrollTop) position, but when I insert new sections above the current viewed section it of course pushes the viewed content down. We need to maintain the scrollTop position relative to the current section. We also need to avoid the display jumping/glitching while the adjustments are made. Options we are considering: Load the content and adjust the scrollTop position by the height of the loaded item (this will probably glitch badly as the DOM change is potentially much slower than the scrollTop adjustment). Load the new section offscreen, measure the height. Then insert the section and adjust the scrollTop by that amount (probably still glitch because of the DOM update). Set the section to be loaded to a large fixed height (e.g. 100/1000 pixels) and adjust the scrollTop to match so the current view does not move. Load the content into that section, then measure the actual new content height and remove the fixed height while adjusting the scrollTop to match the actual height. Don't use traditional scrolling, but write a custom scroller that maintains its own relative offsets and moves existing sections apart to fit new ones. The problem then becomes writing a custom scrollbar replacement (for something like nicescroll which we are using). Temporarily change the position of the current viewed section(s) to absolute (position calculated from the screen offset) to take it out of the flow. Update the parent scrolling window content behind it and then make the viewed section(s) relative again after recalculating the new scrollTop. Something else we have not thought of? I would like some suggestions from anyone that has actually had to solve this problem. It is important that the screen not glitch, so syncing scrollTop to a slow DOM update should be avoided. Suggestions or comments on the proposed solutions? Is there a scroll replacement that would do this already? If you can't solve it, but think it is worth solving, consider upvoting so I can put a large bounty on it! :)

@LINK:/questions/18426083/how-do-i-force-redraw-with-google-maps-api-v3-0
@TITLE:How do I force redraw with Google Maps API v3.0?
@CONTENT:I have a fairly sophisticated Maps application that handles multiple custom markers and such. I have a function called resizeWindow that I call in a listener to that whenever the screen is changed, the map redraws itself by calculating new bounds and forcing a resize. It looks like this: window.onresize = function(event) { fitmap(); };
 and the function to resize is: function fitmap(id) {
    var coords = [];
    var newlatlng = new google.maps.LatLng(projlat, projlng);
    coords.push(newlatlng);

        for (var i=0; i<markers[id].length; i++) {
            newlatlng = new google.maps.LatLng(markers[id][i].latitude, markers[id][i].longitude);
            coords.push(newlatlng);
        }
    }   

    var bounds = new google.maps.LatLngBounds ();
    for (var i = 0, LtLgLen = coords.length; i < LtLgLen; i++) {
        bounds.extend (coords[i]);
    }
    map.fitBounds(bounds);
 and this works great when I actually resize the window. But... I have a menu going down the right side of the window. I use jquery.animate to move that menu off the screen. I call the fitmap function as a step process (or just once at the end) and it will not redraw the map. $('#rightSide').animate({ right:"-240px" }, { 
    duration:1000, 
    step: function(now,fx) {
        fitmap();
    } 
});
 I have read and read on this and it seems that there is an oddity of Google Maps API v3.0 that redrawing will not happen if nothing actually changes. In this case, my available window does change from screen width - menu to actual full screen. But no redraw happens. I've tried google.maps.event.trigger(map, 'resize'); and that doesn't work either. Is there a way to absolutely force Google Maps to redraw?
@CODE:window.onresize = function(event) { fitmap(); }; function fitmap(id) {
    var coords = [];
    var newlatlng = new google.maps.LatLng(projlat, projlng);
    coords.push(newlatlng);

        for (var i=0; i<markers[id].length; i++) {
            newlatlng = new google.maps.LatLng(markers[id][i].latitude, markers[id][i].longitude);
            coords.push(newlatlng);
        }
    }   

    var bounds = new google.maps.LatLngBounds ();
    for (var i = 0, LtLgLen = coords.length; i < LtLgLen; i++) {
        bounds.extend (coords[i]);
    }
    map.fitBounds(bounds); $('#rightSide').animate({ right:"-240px" }, { 
    duration:1000, 
    step: function(now,fx) {
        fitmap();
    } 
});

@LINK:/questions/18345783/multiple-cameras-in-libgdx-probably-similar-in-other-frameworks
@TITLE:Multiple cameras in libgdx ( probably similar in other frameworks )
@CONTENT:I have been trying to solve this problem for two days and I have given up trying to find an existing solution. I have started learning libgdx and finished a couple of tutorials. And now I have tried to use all that I have learned and create a simple side scrolling game. Now, I know that there are libgdx examples of this, but I haven't found a one that incorporates Box2d with scene2d and actors as well as tiled maps. My main problem is with the cameras. You need a camera for the Stage (which as far as I know is used for the projection matrix of the SpriteBatch passed to the method draw() at actors, if this is wrong please correct me) and you need a camera for the TileMapRender for calling the render() method. Also, in some of the tutorials there is a OrthographicCamera in the GameScreen, which is used where needed. I have tried to pass a OrthographicCamera object to methods, I have tried to use the camera from the Stage and the camera from the TileMapRenderer everywhere. Ex. OrthographicCamera ocam  = new OrthographicCamera(FRUSTUM_WIDTH, FRUSTUM_HEIGHT);
stage.setCamera(ocam); // In the other cases i replace ocam with stage.getCamera() or the one i use for the tileMap Render
tileMapRenderer.render(ocam);
stage.getSpriteBatch().setProjectionMatrix(ocam.combined); // I am not sure if this is needed
 I have also tried to use different cameras everywhere. After trying all of this I haven't noted what happens exactly when but I will list what happens : There is nothing on the screen ( Probably the camera is away from the stuff that is drawn ) I can see the tiled map and the contours from the debugRenderer (I use debugRender too but I don't think that it interferes with the cameras), but the sprite of the actor is not visible ( probably off screen ) I can see everything that I should but when I try to move the Actor and the Camera, which is supposed to follow him, the sprite goes faster than the body ( the green debug square ). So my main questions are : I don't understand what happens when you have multiple cameras. "Through" which one do you actually see on the montior? Should I use multiple cameras and how ? Also, I thought that I should mention that I am using OpenGL ES 2.0. I am sorry for the long question, but I thought that I should describe in detail, since it's a bit complicated for me.
@CODE:OrthographicCamera ocam  = new OrthographicCamera(FRUSTUM_WIDTH, FRUSTUM_HEIGHT);
stage.setCamera(ocam); // In the other cases i replace ocam with stage.getCamera() or the one i use for the tileMap Render
tileMapRenderer.render(ocam);
stage.getSpriteBatch().setProjectionMatrix(ocam.combined); // I am not sure if this is needed

@CONTENT:Hi I am looking for a way to open the native map app of the application from a phonegap wrapped javascript app. So far my reaserch revealed that for Android I will have to use a link in this format: <a href="geo:38.897096,-77.036545">Geolocation Test</a>
 This is problematic because I will have to use an external service to convert the address into longitude and lattitude coordinates , wich is something I would like to avoid if possible. In the case of iOS this is alot simpler.I only have to give it a link in this format: <a href="maps:q=Bacau">Test 2</a>
 And the native map app get's oppened. Is there any way , similar to the one in iOS , for Android to give it a plain link with an address in a specific format and the device will know to open it's native map app?

@LINK:/questions/18138876/how-to-get-form-parameters-in-request-filter
@TITLE:How to get form parameters in request filter
@CONTENT:I'm trying to get the form parameters of a request in a request filter: @Override
public ContainerRequest filter(final ContainerRequest request) {

    final Form formParameters = request.getFormParameters();

    //logic

    return request;
}
 However, the form always seems to be empty. The HttpRequestContext.getFormParameters() documentation says: Get the form parameters of the request entity. This method will ensure that the request entity is buffered such that it may be consumed by the applicaton. Returns: the form parameters, if there is a request entity and the content type is "application/x-www-form-urlencoded", otherwise an instance containing no parameters will be returned. My resource is annotated with @Consumes("application/x-www-form-urlencoded"), although it won't have been matched until after the request filter - is that why this isn't working? I tried doing some research but couldn't find any conclusive evidence of whether this is possible. There was this 4-year old discussion, in which Paul Sandoz says: If you are working in Jersey filters or with the HttpRequestContext you can get the form parameters as follows: [broken link to Jersey 1.1.1 HttpRequestContext.getFormParameters] I also found this 3-year-old discussion about how to get multipart/form-data form fields in a request filter. In it, Paul Sandoz uses the following code: // Buffer
InputStream in = request.getEntityInputStream();
if (in.getClass() != ByteArrayInputStream.class) {
    // Buffer input
    ByteArrayOutputStream baos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
    try {
        ReaderWriter.writeTo(in, baos);
    } catch (IOException ex) {
        throw new ContainerException(ex);
    }
    in = new ByteArrayInputStream(baos.toByteArray());
    request.setEntityInputStream(in);
}

// Read entity
FormDataMultiPart multiPart = request.getEntity(FormDataMultiPart.class);
 I tried emulating that approach for Form instead, but the result of request.getEntityInputStream() is always an empty stream. And looking at the source of getFormParameters, that method is in fact doing the same thing already: @Override
public Form getFormParameters() {
    if (MediaTypes.typeEquals(MediaType.APPLICATION_FORM_URLENCODED_TYPE, getMediaType())) {
        InputStream in = getEntityInputStream();
        if (in.getClass() != ByteArrayInputStream.class) {
            // Buffer input
            ByteArrayOutputStream byteArrayOutputStream = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
            try {
                ReaderWriter.writeTo(in, byteArrayOutputStream);
            } catch (IOException e) {
                throw new IllegalArgumentException(e);
            }

            in = new ByteArrayInputStream(byteArrayOutputStream.toByteArray());
            setEntityInputStream(in);
        }

        ByteArrayInputStream byteArrayInputStream = (ByteArrayInputStream) in;
        Form f = getEntity(Form.class);
        byteArrayInputStream.reset();
        return f;
    } else {
        return new Form();
    }
}
 I can't figure out what's slurping up the entity input stream before I get to it. Something in Jersey must be consuming it because the form params are later passed into the resource method. What am I doing wrong here, or is this impossible (and why)? EDIT: Here's an example of a request being sent: POST /test/post-stuff HTTP/1.1

@TITLE:Is closing the resources always important?
@CONTENT:Many times I met the statement that the application should always explicitly close all the resources that it opened. My approach to programming is rather pragmatic and I don't like to blindly follow any convention that I don't clearly see benefits of. Hence my question. Let's assume that: I have a small application It opens a few resources (e.g. files, database connections, remote streams) and processes it It works a few minutes and then it exits Let's say it's in Java (if the language is relevant) Do I really have to care about closing all the resources that I opened? I guess all the resources I opened will be closed/released when the application/virtual machine exits. Am I right? If that's true, are there any convincing reasons to care about closing resources in such small, short working application? UPDATE: The question is purely hypothetical, but the argument for not caring about that is that I may be just hacking together some quick script and don't want to write any unnecessary code not directly related to the problem at hand: closing resources, doing all this verbose try-catch-finally stuff, handling exceptions that I don't care about etc. The point of the question is whether there are any practical consequences of not doing it.

@LINK:/questions/17991479/insert-values-where-not-exists
@TITLE:INSERT VALUES WHERE NOT EXISTS
@CONTENT:OK so I'm trying to improve my asp data entry page to ensure that the entry going into my data table is unique. So in this table I have SoftwareName and SoftwareType. I'm trying to get it so if the entry page sends an insert query with parameters that match whats in the table (so same title and type) then an error is thrown up and the Data isn't entered. Something like this: INSERT INTO tblSoftwareTitles( 
            SoftwareName,  
            SoftwareSystemType) 
            VALUES(@SoftwareName,@SoftwareType) 
            WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT SoftwareName 
            FROM tblSoftwareTitles 
            WHERE Softwarename = @SoftwareName 
            AND SoftwareType = @Softwaretype)
 So This syntax works great for Selecting columns from one table into another without duplicates being entered but doesn't seem to want to work with a parametrized insert query. can anyone help me out with this? Cheers Dan Edit: Here's the code I'm using in my asp insert method     private void ExecuteInsert(string name, string type)

@TITLE:Progress bar primefaces on backend processing
@CONTENT:I would appreciate it if someone can give me some hints about progress bar and ajax back-end processing. To clarify what I need following are details: I have a command button to do some processing at the back-end. I would like to show a progress bar that reach the 100% when the backing bean finishes processing back-end instructions. I looked over many threads but no luck. Most of them did not show a concrete sample how to do that. Below is a snippet of my code: </h:panelGrid>
<p:commandButton id="btn" value="DoSomeAction"
styleClass="ui-priority-primary" update="panel"
onclick="PF('pbAjax').start();PF('startButton1').disable();"
widgetVar="startButton1"
actionListener="#{actionBean.DoSomeAction}" />

<p:progressBar widgetVar="pbAjax" ajax="true"
value="#{progressBean.progress}" labelTemplate="{value}%"
styleClass="animated">
<p:ajax event="complete" listener="#{progressBean.onComplete}"
update="growl" oncomplete="startButton2.enable()" />
</p:progressBar>
</p:panel>
 This is the code for the Progress Brean: @ManagedBean(name="progressBean")
public class ProgressBean implements Serializable {  

  private Integer progress;  

  public Integer getProgress() {  
    if(progress == null)  
      progress = 0;  
    else {  
      progress = progress + (int)(Math.random() * 35);      
      if(progress > 100)  
      progress = 100;  
    }  

    return progress;  
  }  

  public void setProgress(Integer progress) {  
    this.progress = progress;  
  }  

  public void onComplete() {  
    FacesContext.getCurrentInstance().addMessage(null, new  FacesMessage(FacesMessage.SEVERITY_INFO, "Progress Completed", "Progress Completed"));  
  }  

  public void cancel() {  
    progress = null;  
  }  
}  
 The result of this code is just an empty progress bar and nothing happen when I click on my button. Thanks in advance.

 After searching google and stackexchange it would seem that we have a certificate problem. From there we installed internal CA 'public' cert, as well as the instance specific certifications that our app is using (there are multiple redirects to get through), to   /usr/local/etc/openssl/certs, legacy: /System/Library/Keychains/X509Anchors, /Library/Keychains/System.keychain, as well as in Keychain through the gui to our login and System keychains. However, we're still not getting anywhere. 
 Before installing the certs in these places, we couldn't 'curl' our site without certificate errors on command-line; however, with them installed now we get no errors, but node still explodes. We've tried multiple versions of Node, OpenSSL, as well as varying installation methods including downloading the package vs. using homebrew. Computer Information: Mac OS X 10.8.4 (Also tried with 10.8.3) Node v0.8.18 (Also tried with: Node v0.10.11, v0.10.12) OpenSSL v1.0.1e (Also tried with 0.9.8) Brainstorming Questions: Does Node.js use its own (bundled) version of OpenSSL instead of what's installed on the local machine? If that's the case, where is it looking for certificates? Could the TLS.js be telling Node to look elsewhere for certs? Is there a pragmatic approach to overwriting the the certificates used; it appears there might be options we can use like this: var options = {
    ca: fs.readFileSync("[path to our CA cert file]"),
    requestCert: true,
    rejectUnauthorized: true
};

var req = https.request(options, function(res) {
    ...
});

@TITLE:Periodogram in Octave/Matlab vs Scipy
@CONTENT:I am porting some matlab code to python using scipy and got stuck with the following line: Matlab/Octave code [Pxx, f] = periodogram(x, [], 512, 5)
 Python code f, Pxx = signal.periodogram(x, 5, nfft=512)
 The problem is that I get different output on the same data. More specifically, Pxx vectors are different. I tried different windows for signal.periodogram, yet no luck (and it seems that default scypy's boxcar window is the same as default matlab's rectangular window) Another strange behavior is that in python, first element of Pxx is always 0, no matter what data input is. Am i missing something? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

@LINK:/questions/16964669/weird-issue-refreshing-viewpager-with-new-content
@TITLE:Weird issue refreshing ViewPager with new content:
@CONTENT:I receive data from a web service that is parsed into an object in the Application class, this object which in my case is a Report class contains a list of Tabs that should populate the ViewPager. So this Report is stored in the currentReport parameter in the Application class. Each tab should be a page in the ViewPager. So for the first time when I receive the data and parse it, all works perfectly and the View Pager is populated with the correct data and presents it. My problem starts when I want to get a new Report from the server and refresh the ViewPager with the new data that was parsed into the currentReport parameter. My ViewPager is swipe-able and has tabs navigation, So when I try to re-instantiate the ViewPager with the new Report I see the right amount of tabs added to the tabHost. for some reason the fragments of the new report overlaping the fragment of the previos one. So if the number of tabs in the new report is bigger the tabs in the previous report then I can see the tabs from the previous report in addition to part of the new ones (if for example in the first report I had one tab, and in the new one I have 3 then I see the one fragment from the previous and the last 2 from the next one).

 Answer: Following @Luksprog advice for all people that stumble on the same problem this is the final result that works for me, in the AsyncTask I needed to added this: if (activity.getClass() == TabsViewPagerFragmentActivity.class)
{
                TabsViewPagerFragmentActivity tempActivity = ((TabsViewPagerFragmentActivity)activity);
                application.currentReport = result;
                Log.d(TAG, "Current report parsed is: "+result);
                List<Fragment> frags =  tempActivity.getTabActivityViewPagerAdapter().getFragments(); // getter method in your adapter
                FragmentTransaction ft = tempActivity.getSupportFragmentManager().beginTransaction();
                for (int i = 0; i < frags.size(); i++) 
                {
                    ft.remove(frags.get(i));
                }
                ft.commit(); 
                tempActivity.intialiseViewPager();
                tempActivity.getTabHost().getTabWidget().removeAllViews();
                tempActivity.initialiseTabHost(null);
                tempActivity.NotifyTabActivityViewPagerAdapter();
}
 When the main two point are to remove the previous added fragments from the FragmentManager/SupportFragmentManager using a FragmentTransaction to show the correct set of fragments in the ViewPager and to remove all view from the TabWidget before adding new ones.

var server = httpProxy.createServer(options);
 I tried: server.on('upgrade', function (req, socket, head) {
    server.proxy.proxyWebSocketRequest(req, socket, head);
});
 But it doesn't seem to work. A quick check to see whether websockets work shows I get Unexpected response code: 400 from Chrome (works fine if I go directly) Also doing a couple of checks server.on('upgrade',.. doesn't fire on a websocket request How can I get my proxy server to route websockets correctly? I've also tried this on node 0.8.23 as well as node 0.10.x (the later versions of node have a memory leak issue, but it wont work on 0.8.23 either)

@TITLE:Auto Layout and in-call status bar
@CONTENT:I'd like to ask about Auto Layout and in-call status bar. Here's a simple scenario that demonstrates my problem: Create project with "Use Storyboards" enabled Add "View Controller" and enable its "Is Initial View Controller" Set background color of controller's view to red Add "Table View" into controller's view The table view should have 4 layout constraints (leading, top, trailing, bottom) to Superview with constant and multiplier set to 0. Now when I run this app in Simulator and press ? + T I can see red background while the in-call status bar animates in. Is it possible to get rid of this glitch?

@TITLE:Using cm/mm on the CSS of a web app that replicates paper interaction is a good practice?
@CONTENT:I am building a web application that interact with documents for later printing. In some points is similar to Google Docs. I am considering using cm/mm on the CSS of my documents pages because it will help me on the document generation. Example: // A4 size
.page {
   width: 210mm;
   height: 297mm;
   margin: 2cm 5cm; 
}
 <div class="page">
  ...
</div>
 What are the main issues of following this approach?
@CODE:// A4 size
.page {
   width: 210mm;
   height: 297mm;
   margin: 2cm 5cm; 
} <div class="page">

@TITLE:test for membership in a 2d numpy array
@CONTENT:I have two 2D arrays of the same size a = array([[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]])
b = array([[1,2],[3,4],[7,8]])
 I want to know the rows of b that are in a. So the output should be : array([ True,  True, False], dtype=bool)
 without making : array([any(i == a) for i in b])
 cause a and b are huge. There is a function that does this but only for 1D arrays : in1d
@CODE:a = array([[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]])
b = array([[1,2],[3,4],[7,8]]) array([ True,  True, False], dtype=bool) array([any(i == a) for i in b]) a b

@TITLE:What's the most pythonic way to iterate over all the lines of multiple files?
@CONTENT:I want to treat many files as if they were all one file. What's the proper pythonic way to take [filenames] => [file objects] => [lines] with generators/not reading an entire file into memory? We all know the proper way to open a file: with open("auth.log", "rb") as f:
    print sum(f.readlines())
 And we know the correct way to link several iterators/generators into one long one: >>> list(itertools.chain(range(3), range(3)))
[0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]
 but how do I link multiple files together and preserve the context managers? with open("auth.log", "rb") as f0:
    with open("auth.log.1", "rb") as f1:
        for line in itertools.chain(f0, f1):
            do_stuff_with(line)

    # f1 is now closed
# f0 is now closed
# gross
 I could ignore the context managers and do something like this, but it doesn't feel right: files = itertools.chain(*(open(f, "rb") for f in file_names))
for line in files:
    do_stuff_with(line)
 Or is this kind of what Async IO - PEP 3156 is for and I'll just have to wait for the elegant syntax later?
@CODE:with open("auth.log", "rb") as f:
    print sum(f.readlines()) >>> list(itertools.chain(range(3), range(3)))
[0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2] with open("auth.log", "rb") as f0:
    with open("auth.log.1", "rb") as f1:
        for line in itertools.chain(f0, f1):
            do_stuff_with(line)

    # f1 is now closed
# f0 is now closed
# gross files = itertools.chain(*(open(f, "rb") for f in file_names))
for line in files:
    do_stuff_with(line) files = itertools.chain(*(open(f, "rb") for f in file_names)) chain itertools.chain.from_iterable(open(fname,'r') for fname in filenames)) from_iterable from_iterable from_iterable __del__ contextlib.ExitStack

@TITLE:How to use the blob storage service from ios?
@CONTENT:In my application I need to use the Windows Azure services to store the data for that I am using this:http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/mobile/tutorials/get-started-with-data-ios/ sdk for Windows azure integration from my app. Now I need to upload the images to Azure and for that I was using the same sdk...But later I found that the right place in Windows Azure to upload the larger images is to Blob Storage Client. In .Net they have the different library and I found this link http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/net/how-to-guides/blob-storage/ for uploading the images to blob storage. But how can I do that with Objective C? After some research I found this link http://www.deviantpoint.com/post/2012/02/18/Using-Azure-Storage-Services-from-an-iPhone-App-Part-1-Table-and-Blob-setup-Azure-iOS-toolkit-and-Model-Classes.aspx but its not clear about How to upload an image and getting the image url in response?

@TITLE:What is the reason to use parenthesis-less subroutine calls in Perl? [closed]
@CONTENT:As per perldoc perlsub: The & is optional in modern Perl, as are parentheses if the subroutine has been predeclared. I notice that a lot of times, people use the fact that you can omit parenthesis when calling Perl subroutines (e.g., randomly quoting from a recent SO answer): open my $fin, '<', $file;
 is as equally valid as open(my $fin, '<', $file);
 What are the main (ideally, technical) reasons to use the second (parenthesis-less) version? perldoc perlsyn doesn't say anything on the topic other than again mention optionality. For me, always using the parenthesis are mostly a stylistic choice due to my origins as a C developer; but I'd like to know if I'm missing something out on not using the optional parenthesis-less syntax as a Perl developer. P.S. I know full well the reasons to prefer the version with parenthesis - e.g. the issues with indirect object notation, or requirement to declare non-builtins before they are used without parenthesis, or issues with precedence visavi or vs ||. I'm interested in the opposite. P.P.S. I'm not greatly interested in answers merely stating "it's better style"/"more readable" without any studies backing the opinion up. I'm interested in either technical reasons to prefer parenthesis omission, or backed up stylistic difference preferences (Please don't confuse "backed up" with "appeal to authority" or "argumentum ad populum" fallacies. A study showing improvement in speed or comprehension of code is proof. "Everyone in Perl commmunity agrees" or "Damien Conway suggests this" without explaining how Damien backs this up is not).

@TITLE:Save file/open file dialog box, using Swing & Netbeans GUI editor
@CONTENT:I am a beginner to Java. I am making a simple text editor in netbeans 7(.3) IDE, using its GUI editor. The main problem I face in it is that I can't make it to save/open the file. I have created the "save" button. When I drop the file chooser, it comes as a normal open file dialog box embedded in the java window with no functionality at all. I have also tried creating a new jFileChooser when the save button is clicked (in the Source view), but it doesn't work. In a nutshell, I need a simple open/save dialog box. When the "Save" button is pressed, the save dialog box opens and saves the file wherever the user chooses with whatever name and .rtf or .txt extension. (P.S.: is it possible to save a file in .docx or .doc in Java?) When the "Open" btn is pressed, it opens a file in .rtf or .txt (again, is it possible to open .docx or .doc in Java?) through the file chooser.     private void saveButtonActionPerformed(java.awt.event.ActionEvent evt) {                                           
    JFileChooser saveFile = new JFileChooser();
    if saveFile.showSaveDialog(modalToComponent) == JFileChooser.APPROVE_OPTION {
        File xyz = saveFile.getSelectedFile();
    }
}

@LINK:/questions/15660805/android-extras-about-speech-recognition-does-not-work
@TITLE:Android extras about speech recognition does not work
@CONTENT:I am currently busy with speech recognition, and I want speech recognizer to listen me continously, forever. The purpose of the app is, it is going to wait for speech of a specific keyword: when the user says this keyword, the service becomes ready to receive user voice commands After research I found that we can manupulate the time that the recognizer listens. By these constants: By the way the default recognizer service listens about 10 seconds. (The google api)      String EXTRA_SPEECH_INPUT_COMPLETE_SILENCE_LENGTH_MILLIS   The amount of time that it should take after we stop hearing speech to consider the input complete.
     String EXTRA_SPEECH_INPUT_MINIMUM_LENGTH_MILLIS    The minimum length of an utterance.
     String EXTRA_SPEECH_INPUT_POSSIBLY_COMPLETE_SILENCE_LENGTH_MILLIS  The amount of time that it should take after we stop hearing speech to consider the input possibly complete.
 http://java.llp2.dcc.ufmg.br/apiminer/docs/reference/android/speech/RecognizerIntent.html These are the extras of the bundle class. The problem is, when I use these constants in my code it does not work. Here is my code:    intent.putExtra(RecognizerIntent.EXTRA_SPEECH_INPUT_MINIMUM_LENGTH_MILLIS, 5000);
   intent.putExtra(RecognizerIntent.EXTRA_SPEECH_INPUT_COMPLETE_SILENCE_LENGTH_MILLIS, 5000);
   intent.putExtra(RecognizerIntent.EXTRA_SPEECH_INPUT_POSSIBLY_COMPLETE_SILENCE_LENGTH_MILLIS, 5000);
 The recognizer still listens me about 10 seconds, although I wrote 5000 mseconds, as you see. Can you think of the problem? Maybe I dont know how to use extras or maybe it is about permissions and maybe it skips my code or I should add some other codes. Any help would be appriciated.

 The script iterates over several databases db. The problem is that at some point I get an "Unread result found" error. It seems when I run the script, at some point "use mydb" returns a result (cursor._have_result=True), when I didn't expect one. The weird thing is that if I rerun the full script it runs a little longer with more databases giving the same error later. Can you suggest a way to solve or investigate this problem? Is there something I can do to prevent "unread results"? PS: When I rerun the script the ALTER commands fails for the databases which are already done. Not sure if that causes problems.

@TITLE:.gitignore whitelist on directory and its contents
@CONTENT:I'm trying to whitelist the directory (and its contents) SupplierName in my Zend Framework 2 vendor directory. The original .gitignore file in /vendor looks like this: # Add here the vendor path to be whitelisted
# Ex: for composer directory write here "!composer" (without quotes)
!.gitignore
*
 Now I'd like to whitelist the directory SupplierName which shouldn't be too hard I thought. I have read the docs on gitignore and tried the following configurations: First try, add !SupplierName right after the comment which says that I have to add the whitelisted path here. # Add here the vendor path to be whitelisted
!SupplierName
# Ex: for composer directory write here "!composer" (without quotes)
!.gitignore
*
 Right after that I executed git status which didn't show the vendor/SupplierName directory. git add vendor/SupplierName showed the following message: The following paths are ignored by one of your .gitignore files: vendor/SupplierName Second try # Add here the vendor path to be whitelisted
# Ex: for composer directory write here "!composer" (without quotes)
!SupplierName
!.gitignore
*
 Right after that I executed git status which didn't show the vendor/SupplierName directory. git add vendor/SupplierName showed the following message: The following paths are ignored by one of your .gitignore files: vendor/SupplierName Third try # Add here the vendor path to be whitelisted
# Ex: for composer directory write here "!composer" (without quotes)
!.gitignore
*
!SupplierName
 Right after that I executed git status which didn't show the vendor/SupplierName directory. git add vendor/SupplierName seems to work. But now, when I want to add the Module.php file (and some other files, subdirectories, etc) the following happens. git add vendor/SupplierName/Module.php --> The following paths are ignored by one of your .gitignore files: vendor/SupplierName/Module.php # Add here the vendor path to be whitelisted
# Ex: for composer directory write here "!composer" (without quotes)
*
!.gitignore
!SupplierName
!SupplierName/
!SupplierName/*
 Allows me to add files directly in vendor/SupplierName, but git add vendor/SupplierName/config/module.config.php still results in The following paths are ignored by one of your .gitignore files: vendor/SupplierName/config/module.config.php I've been searching for problems regarding recursive whitelisting, because that seems to be the problem, but nothing came up.

@TITLE:Download ONLY audio from a youtube video
@CONTENT:I know that there are a million ways to download a video from youtube and then convert it to audio or do further processing on it. But recently I was surprised to see an app called YoutubeToMp3 on mac actually showing "Skipping X mb of video" and supposedly only downloading the audio from the video, without the need to use bandwith to download the entire video and then convert it. I was wondering if this is actually correct and possible at all because I cant find any way to do that. Do you have any ideas ? EDIT: After some tests here is some additional information on the topic. The video which I tried to get the audio from is just a sample mp4 file from the internet: http://download.wavetlan.com/SVV/Media/HTTP/MP4/ConvertedFiles/MediaCoder/MediaCoder_test6_1m9s_XVID_VBR_306kbps_320x240_25fps_MPEG1Layer3_CBR_320kbps_Stereo_44100Hz.mp4 I tried ffmpeg -i "input" out.mp3 ffmpeg -i "input" -vn out.mp3 ffmpeg -i ¡§input¡¨ -vn -ac 2 -ar 44100 -ab 320k -f mp3 output.mp3 ffmpeg -i ¡§input¡¨ -vn -acodec copy output.mp3 Unfortunately non of these commands seems to be using less bandwith. They all download the entire video. Now that you have the video can you confirm if there is actually a command that downloads only the audio stream from it and lowers the bandwith usage? Thanks!

@TITLE:Using static methods in python - best practice
@CONTENT:When and how are static methods suppose to be used in python? We have already established using a class method as factory method to create an instance of an object should be avoided when possible. In other words, it is not best practice to use class methods as an alternate constructor (See Factory method for python object - best practice). Lets say I have a class used to represent some entity data in a database. Imagine the data is a dict object containing field names and field values and one of the fields is an ID number that makes the data unique. class Entity(object):
    def __init__(self, data, db_connection):
        self._data = data
        self._db_connection
 Here my __init__ method takes the entity data dict object. Lets say I only have an ID number and I want to create an Entity instance. First I will need to find the rest of the data, then create an instance of my Entity object. From my previous question, we established that using a class method as a factory method should probably be avoided when possible. class Entity(object):

    @classmethod
    def from_id(cls, id_number, db_connection):
        filters = [['id', 'is', id_number]]
        data = db_connection.find(filters)
        return cls(data, db_connection)

    def __init__(self, data, db_connection):
        self._data = data
        self._db_connection


# Create entity
entity = Entity.from_id(id_number, db_connection)
 Above is an example of what not to do or at least what not to do if there is an alternative. Now I am wondering if editing my class method so that it is more of a utility method and less of a factory method is a valid solution. In other words, does the following example comply with the best practice for using static methods. class Entity(object):

    @staticmethod
    def data_from_id(id_number, db_connection):
        filters = [['id', 'is', id_number]]
        data = db_connection.find(filters)
        return data


# Create entity
data = Entity.data_from_id(id_number, db_connection)
entity = Entity(data)
 Or does it make more sense to use a standalone function to find the entity data from an ID number. def find_data_from_id(id_number, db_connection):
    filters = [['id', 'is', id_number]]
    data = db_connection.find(filters)
    return data


# Create entity.
data = find_data_from_id(id_number, db_connection)
entity = Entity(data, db_connection)
 Note: I do not want to change my __init__ method. Previously people have suggested making my __init__ method to look something like this __init__(self, data=None, id_number=None) but there could be 101 different ways to find the entity data so I would prefer to keep that logic separate to some extent. Make sense?
@CODE:dict class Entity(object):
    def __init__(self, data, db_connection):
        self._data = data
        self._db_connection __init__ dict Entity Entity class Entity(object):

    @classmethod
    def from_id(cls, id_number, db_connection):
        filters = [['id', 'is', id_number]]
        data = db_connection.find(filters)
        return cls(data, db_connection)

    def __init__(self, data, db_connection):
        self._data = data
        self._db_connection


# Create entity
entity = Entity.from_id(id_number, db_connection) class Entity(object):

    @staticmethod
    def data_from_id(id_number, db_connection):
        filters = [['id', 'is', id_number]]
        data = db_connection.find(filters)
        return data


# Create entity

    return data

@TITLE:GNU Make ¡§Abort trap: 6¡¨ after gcc call however call is valid when executed alone
@CONTENT:I am using GNU Make to build a C/C++ project that many people will use. The makefile attempts to be general because there are many optional files in this project and each user selects those files through a MATLAB interface which are then provided to the makefile via command line arguments (make target OPTS='XYZ' etc...). When I use the makefile it correctly identifies the correct object dependencies, then proceeds to find the source prerequisites for those objects and build them. However, every time it tries to execute an object rule I get an error saying "Abort trap: 6" right after the gcc call. The Makefile is as follows vpath %.c $(PATH) $(OBJ_DIR)
# Pick compilers
CC1=g++
CC2=gcc
LNK=g++
# Assign variables for c/cpp implicit rules
CXXFLAGS= $(CCFLAGS) $(DEFINES) $(INCLUDES)
CFLAGS = $(CCFLAGS) $(DEFINES) $(INCLUDES)

# Assign various user-defined values
OUTPUT = -o $(USER_LIB)
C_OBJECTS = $(patsubst %.c,$(OBJ_DIR)/%.o,$(C_SOURCES))
CPP_OBJECTS = $(patsubst %.cpp,$(OBJ_DIR)/%.o,$(CPP_SOURCES))
OBJECTS = $(C_OBJECTS) $(CPP_OBJECTS) $(SIM_OBJECTS)

# User Library Dependencies and Compilation Rules
$(USER_LIB): $(OBJECTS)
    $(LNK) $(LINKERFLAGS) $(CCFLAGS) $(DEFINES) $(INCLUDES) $(OUTPUT) $(OBJECTS)

$(OBJ_DIR)/%.o: %.c 
    $(CC2) $(CFLAGS) -c -o $@ $<
 and an example of what I get is: gcc -g -D(the defines)  -I(all the includes) -c -o obj1/xyz.o ../common/xyz.c
make: *** [obj1/xyz.o] Abort trap: 6
 However if I take that EXACT same gcc call and run it on the command line (just copy and paste) the file is correctly compiled and the object file placed in the obj1 folder. I tried to look at 'make -d' to see if I could find anything either. Since that output is crazy long, the gist of it is the following: ... output truncated for brevity ...
gcc -g -D(the defines)  -I(all the includes) -c -o obj1/xyz.o ../common/xyz.c
Putting child 0x104f13cc0 (obj1/xyz.o) PID 24557 on the chain.

make: *** [obj1/xyz.o] Abort trap: 6
Removing child 0x104f13cc0 PID 24557 from chain.
 at which point the output ends. I also tried running make -k to see what happens after the first error. Every single source file produces the same result. Again, each source file is compilable with the exact call that make uses when done independently. I'm completely lost on this one at this point and theres very little information about what "Abort trap: 6" means in this context. I am running Mac OSX 10.7 with gcc-4.2 installed through Xcode. I realize there isn't a rule for .cpp files currently, I do not at present have any .cpp source files to compile, though in the future there likely will be which is why there is support structure for it so far. Thank you in advance for anyone who can help me. EDIT: Added one proceeding line from the "make -d" output. EDIT: Added solution (moved to an answer)

 The result of this is that I am receiving the output of ./script/my_script.rb in ./log/my_log.log. This behavior is desired. What is curious is that I am also receiving the output in my local mail. I am wondering how the output of my script is being captured by mail. Since I am redirecting the output to a log file, I would expect that my cron job would have no output, and thus I would receive no mail when the cron job runs. Can anyone shed some light as to how mail is able to get the output of ./script/my_script.rb?

@CONTENT:I am writing a web service using Java JDK 1.7 and Jersey Web service Framework. One of the things I need to provide is a way to allow authenticated clients to download certain large data files ( 1-3 GB). Ideally I would like this to be a pause and resume type downloadable option. I tried the jersey multi-part API and was able to get it to work on my client machine upto 400 MB but beyond that it ran into out-of memory issues. I am also worried that the server might fail when faced with simultaneous download requests. Any thoughts on how this can be done? Is Netty an option? Any pointers on how Netty can be integrated into a existing Jersey based web service? Are there other frame works available to help accomplish this? I do have to use java for the web service. Any pointers will be helpful.

@TITLE:Can a build server with .NET 4.5 installed successfully deploy a project targeting 4.0 to a server with only .NET 4.0 installed?
@CONTENT:We've recently installed .NET 4.5 onto our continuous integration build server so that it can support new projects that utilize features of .NET 4.5. This build server is also used to build and deploy older projects, as well, some of which target .NET 4.0. Projects that target .NET 4.0 being built on this server, then deployed to a target server that has only .NET 4.0 installed are now failing with the following error: Method not found: 'Int32 System.Environment.get_CurrentManagedThreadId()'.
 Environment.CurrentManagedThreadId is a new property of .NET Framework 4.5, so it makes sense that a server running 4.0 can't find it. However, we are targeting .NET 4.0 at build time, so in theory we shouldn't need to have 4.5 installed on the production server. To sum up: Project targets 4.0 Build server has 4.5 installed The server on which the project is then deployed has only .NET 4.0 Project fails at runtime with error Method not found: 'Int32 System.Environment.get_CurrentManagedThreadId()'. What gives? Is it possible to successfully run .NET 4.0 dlls on a server with only .NET 4.0 installed when the dlls are built by a server with .NET 4.5?

@TITLE:Creating Array using JSTL or EL
@CONTENT:I'm working on a web application using Java and its frameworks(Spring 3.1.1). And I'm trying to avoid using scriptlets as much as possible, however I can't find a way other than this to define an array: <%
    String[] alphabet = {"A", "B", "C", ... , "Z"};
    pageContext.setAttribute("alphabet", alphabet);      
%> 
 After setting pageContext attribute, I can use it with ${alphabet}. But I want to know, is it possible to use plain JSTL/EL to create an array? UPDATE: I'm using this array to create links. For example, if user clicks 'S', a list of employees whose first name starts with 'S' comes. So, instead of creating links one by one I'm iterating ${alphabet}.

@TITLE:Android close dialog after 5 seconds?
@CONTENT:I'm working on an accesibility app. When the user wants to leave the app I show a dialog where he has to confirm he wants to leave, if he doesn't confirm after 5 seconds the dialog should close automatically (since the user probably opened it accidentally). This is similar to what happens on Windows when you change the screen resolution (an alert appears and if you don't confirm it, it reverts to the previous configuration). This is how I show the dialog: AlertDialog.Builder dialog = new AlertDialog.Builder(this).setTitle("Leaving launcher").setMessage("Are you sure you want to leave the launcher?");
            dialog.setPositiveButton("Confirm", new DialogInterface.OnClickListener() {
                @Override

                }
            });
            dialog.create().show();

@LINK:/questions/14367331/how-to-set-up-and-solve-simultaneous-equations-in-python
@TITLE:How to set up and solve simultaneous equations in python
@CONTENT:For a fixed integer n, I have a set of 2(n-1) simultaneous equations as follows. M(p) = 1+((n-p-1)/n)*M(n-1) + (2/n)*N(p-1) + ((p-1)/n)*M(p-1)

N(p) = 1+((n-p-1)/n)*M(n-1) + (p/n)*N(p-1)

M(1) = 1+((n-2)/n)*M(n-1) + (2/n)*N(0)

N(0) = 1+((n-1)/n)*M(n-1)
 M(p) is defined for 1 <= p <= n-1. N(p) is defined for 0 <= p <= n-2. Notice also that p is just a constant integer in every equation so the whole system is linear. I have been using Maple but I would like to set these up and solve them in python now, maybe using numpy.linalg.solve (or any other better method). I actually only want the value of M(n-1). For example, when n=2 the answer should be M(1) = 4, I believe. This is because the equations become M(1) = 1+(2/2)*N(0)
N(0) = 1 + (1/2)*M(1)
 Therefore M(1)/2 = 1+1
 and so M(1) = 4. 
 If I want to plug in n=50, say, how can you set up this system of simultaneous equations in python so that numpy.linalg.solve can solve them? Update The answers are great but they use dense solvers where the system of equations is sparse. Posted follow up to Using scipy sparse matrices to solve system of equations .
@CODE:n 2(n-1) M(p) = 1+((n-p-1)/n)*M(n-1) + (2/n)*N(p-1) + ((p-1)/n)*M(p-1)

N(p) = 1+((n-p-1)/n)*M(n-1) + (p/n)*N(p-1)

M(1) = 1+((n-2)/n)*M(n-1) + (2/n)*N(0)

N(0) = 1+((n-1)/n)*M(n-1) M(p) 1 <= p <= n-1 N(p) 0 <= p <= n-2 p numpy.linalg.solve M(n-1) n=2 M(1) = 4 M(1) = 1+(2/2)*N(0)
N(0) = 1 + (1/2)*M(1) M(1)/2 = 1+1 M(1) = 4. n=50 * M(p) p M(p-1) p M(p-1) M 1

@LINK:/questions/14283703/when-is-it-a-good-idea-to-use-stdpromise-over-the-other-stdthread-mechanisms
@TITLE:When is it a good idea to use std::promise over the other std::thread mechanisms?
@CONTENT:I am trying to establish some heuristics to help me decide the appropriate std::thread class to use. As I understand it, from highest level (simplest to use, but least flexible) to lowest level, we have: std::async with/std::future (std::shared_future) (when you want to execute on a one-time throw-away producer-thread async) std::packaged_task (when you want to assign a producer, but defer the call to the thread) std::promise (???) I think I have a decent grasp of when to use the first two, but am still unclear about std::promise. std::future in conjunction with a std::async call, effectively transforms a producing callback/functor/lambda to an asynchronous call (which returns immediately, by definition). A singular consumer can call std::future::get(), a blocking call, to get its results back. std::shared_future is just a version which allows for multiple consumers. If you want to bind a std::future value with a producer callback, but want to defer the actual invocation to a later time (when you associate the task to a spawning thread), std::packaged_task is the right choice. But now, since the corresponding std::future to the std::package_task could, in the general case, be accessed by multiple-threads, we may have to take care to use a std::mutex. Note that with std::async, in the first case, we don't have to worry about locking. Having read some interesting links on promise, I think I understand its mechanisms and how to set them up, but my question is, when would you choose to use a promise over the other three? I'm looking more for an application-level answer, like a rule-of-thumb (fill the ??? in 3. above), as opposed to the answer in the link (eg use std::promise to implement some library mechanism), so I can more easily explain how to choose the proper class to a beginning user of std::thread. In other words, it would be nice to have an useful example of what I can do with a std::promise that cannot be done with the other mechanisms. ANSWER A std::future is a strange beast: in general, you cannot modify its value directly. Three producers which can modify its value are: std::async through an asynchronous callback, which will return a std::future instance. std::packaged_task, which, when passed to a thread, will invoke its callback thereby updating the std::future instance associated with that std::packaged_task. This mechanism allows for early binding of a producer, but a later invocation. std::promise, which allows one to modify its associated std::future through its set_value() call. With this direct control over mutating a std::future, we must ensure that that the design is thread-safe if there are multiple producers (use std::mutex as necessitated). I think SethCarnegie's answer: An easy way to think of it is that you can either set a future by returning a value or by using a promise. future has no set method; that functionality is provided by promise. helps clarify when to use a promise. But we have to keep in mind that a std::mutex may be necessary, as the promise might be accessible from different threads, depending on usage. Also, David's Rodriguez's answer is also excellent: The consumer end of the communication channel would use a std::future to consume the datum from the shared state, while the producer thread would use a std::promise to write to the shared state. But as an alternative, why not simply just use a std::mutex on a stl container of results, and one thread or a threadpool of producers to act on the container? What does using std::promise, instead, buy me, besides some extra readability vs a stl container of results? The control appears to be better in the std::promise version: wait() will block on a given future until the result is produced if there is only one producer thread, a mutex is not necessary The following google-test passes both helgrind and drd, confirming that with a single producer, and with the use of wait(), a mutex is not needed.

@LINK:/questions/14273917/java-quartz-scheduler-across-timezone
@TITLE:Java Quartz-Scheduler across TimeZone
@CONTENT:My server runs on Europe/Rome timezone -and this one is the default tz on the server-, I need to schedule jobs according the user's timezone, so, if a user, living on Pacific/Honolulu timezone, schedules a CronTrigger that fires every day at 22:00pm for his region of the Earth I have found this solution: CronTrigger trigger = newTrigger()
  .withIdentity("name", "group")
  .withSchedule(
    cronSchedule("0 0 22 ? * *").inTimeZone(TimeZone.getTimeZone("Pacific/Honolulu"))
  )
  .startNow()
  .build();
 On my server this job starts at 09:00am of the "my" next day. There are particular problems to be taken into consideration besides the fact to keep updated the timezone (i.e. Timezone Updater Tool) ? If I want to define the .startAt() and .endAt() for the previous job, is this kind of date ok? A possible daylight saving time is safe using this procedure? Calendar calTZStarts = new GregorianCalendar(TimeZone.getTimeZone("Pacific/Honolulu"));
calTZStarts.set(2013, Calendar.JANUARY, 10);

Calendar calTZEnds = new GregorianCalendar(TimeZone.getTimeZone("Pacific/Honolulu"));
calTZEnds.set(2013, Calendar.JANUARY, 30);

Calendar calStarts = Calendar.getInstance();
calStarts.set(Calendar.YEAR, calTZStarts.get(Calendar.YEAR));
calStarts.set(Calendar.MONTH, calTZStarts.get(Calendar.MONTH));
calStarts.set(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, calTZStarts.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH));
calStarts.set(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY, calTZStarts.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY));
calStarts.set(Calendar.MINUTE, calTZStarts.get(Calendar.MINUTE));
calStarts.set(Calendar.SECOND, calTZStarts.get(Calendar.SECOND));

calEnds.set(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, calTZEnds.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH));
calEnds.set(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY, calTZEnds.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY));
calEnds.set(Calendar.MINUTE, calTZEnds.get(Calendar.MINUTE));
calEnds.set(Calendar.SECOND, calTZEnds.get(Calendar.SECOND));
calEnds.set(Calendar.MILLISECOND, calTZEnds.get(Calendar.MILLISECOND));

CronTrigger trigger = newTrigger()
  .withIdentity("name", "group")
  .withSchedule(
    cronSchedule("0 0 22 ? * *").inTimeZone(TimeZone.getTimeZone("Pacific/Honolulu"))
  )
  .startAt(calStarts.getTime())
  .endAt(calEnds.getTime())
  .build();
 or I have to set simply start and end using: Calendar calTZStarts = new GregorianCalendar();
calTZStarts.set(2013, Calendar.JANUARY, 10, 0, 0, 0);

Calendar calTZEnds = new GregorianCalendar();
calTZEnds.set(2013, Calendar.JANUARY, 30, 0, 0, 0);

CronTrigger trigger = newTrigger()
  .withIdentity("name", "group")
  .withSchedule(
    cronSchedule("0 0 22 ? * *").inTimeZone(TimeZone.getTimeZone("Pacific/Honolulu"))
  )
  .startAt(calTZStarts.getTime())
  .endAt(calTZEnds.getTime())
  .build();
 Then the job starts/ends correctly in "Pacific/Honolulu" defined days? Thanks in advance for every suggestion

Turns out, it's kept alive by it's AutoCompleteTextViews, which in turn are kept alive by android.widget.TextView$IClipboardDataPasteEventImpl. However there are no immediate dominators for IClipboardDataPasteEventImpl (except of course the GC Root). I tried to find that IClipboardDataPasteEventImpl on the internet and I searched grepcode (the android source), but the only thing I could come up with was this blog entry. I can't read whatever language that is, but what I could read are the English words thrown in, which indicates, that it might be a bug on the Samsung Galaxy SII (the phone I am using, running android 2.3.x), related to the ClipboardManager. However I am unsure of this (I want to fix this, hence I am disinclined to simply accept it to be an unfixable bug) and I have no clue, where this Clipboard is spawned and why. I would greatly appreciate any pointers/ideas on the matter.

@TITLE:Xcode 4 and Interface Builder: Editing Vertical Spacing Constraint (Anchor Top, not Bottom)
@CONTENT:I've got a widget that is not laying out correctly on device (its looks OK in IB, but its not quite right). The widget is a label and its located about mid-screen. Interface Builder gave it a Vertical Space Constraint with a 'Bottom Anchor'. Here, bottom means bottom of the screen (rather than a widget below, or anchor to top screen). I'm in the inspector, but I don't see how to change to a top anchor (preferably, to the widget above). I tried reading Apple's docs and Editing Constraints in particular, but it was a confusing and did not explain how to make the change (or I missed the discussion - which was 7 sentences). Below is a screen capture under Interface Builder showing the Vertical Space Constraint anchored to the bottom of the screen. And its attributes leave a lot to be desired - Equal, Constant and Priority don't really help. Does anyone know how to edit constraints? Specifically, I want to (1) change a vertical spacer's anchor from bottom to top; and (2) anchor against the widget above, and not the top of the screen.

@TITLE:Why won't Devise allow unconfirmed users to login even when allow_unconfirmed_access_for is set?
@CONTENT:We have an existing user base and are adding email confirmation. Confirmation is optional, but will allow additional features. Users are not required to confirm. I've added the confirmable module and ran migrations. Confirmation works as advertised. But, users cannot login since they are not confirmed. All current users have nil confirmation values, which is what we want (users can go back and confirm their email at any time). I've followed all the Devise wiki articles and set allow_unconfirmed_access_for in the initializer: config.allow_unconfirmed_access_for = 10.years 
 I've also tried setting it in our user model as well: devise :confirmable, allow_unconfirmed_access_for: 10.years
 I've also tried using other values (1.year, 500.days, etc.) My SessionsController, which does not differ much from Devise's method (here on github) class Users::SessionsController < Devise::SessionsController

@TITLE:How to search an int field in Lucene 4?
@CONTENT:I am trying to implement an index of documents (rougly corresponding to DB rows), where one of the fields is an integer. I'm adding them to index like: Document doc = new Document();
doc.add(new StringField("ticket_number", rs.getString("ticket_number"),
        Field.Store.YES));
doc.add(new IntField("ticket_id", rs.getInt("ticket_id"),

doc.add(new StringField("id_s", rs.getString("ticket_id"),
        Field.Store.YES));
w.addDocument(doc);
 It seems I can't query the ticket_id field at all, while id_s works just fine. One of the documents is (I added whitespace for readability): Document<
    stored,indexed,tokenized,omitNorms,indexOptions=DOCS_ONLY<ticket_number:230114W> 
    stored<ticket_id:152> 
    stored,indexed,tokenized,omitNorms,indexOptions=DOCS_ONLY<id_s:152>>
 So my int field is stored, but not indexed. This query works as expected: id_s:152, while this one never returns anything: ticket_id:152. What am I doing wrong? How can I add such a field to the index and make it searchable?
@CODE:Document doc = new Document();
doc.add(new StringField("ticket_number", rs.getString("ticket_number"),

Of course I can pass a large buffer and read() will try to fill it with all available data.

@CONTENT:According to php.net, StackOverflow and other sources of trust, I can find 4 different ways to set UTF-8 on PDO connection, but can't find wich one is the better to choose. A PDO connection code (and some inits) : $localhost = $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'] == 'localhost';
error_reporting(-1); ini_set('display_errors', $localhost); // Old : error_reporting($localhost ? -1 : 0); see answer above
date_default_timezone_set('Europe/Paris');

 So, what I understood, is that the Method 1 only work with PHP 5.3+ (but it seems that it's a bit buggy), and method 2 is for MySQL only. Differences between method 3 and 4 is MySQL thing, but I still don't know wich one is better. And is there a way to call SET NAMES in PDO attributes, but not for MySQL only? Thanks!

@TITLE:Why does EF 5.x use plural name for table?
@CONTENT:I've had some experiences in ORM framework such as Hibernate, even Entity Framework 3.0. By default, those frameworks use singular name for table. For example, class User will map to table User. But when I migrate to EF 5.x by using Visual Studio 2012, it uses plural name and causes many errors unless I manually map that class by using TableAttribute as: [Table("User")]
public class User {
    // ...
}
 Without TableAttribute, if I have a DbContext as below: public CustomContext : DbContext {
    // ...
    public DbSet<User> Users { get; set; }
}
 Then calling: var list = db.Users.ToList();
 The generated sql looks like: Select [Extent1].[Username] From [Users] as [Extent1]
 Therefore, the error will occur because I don't have any table named Users. Futhermore, I refer to name tables in singular form to plural form. You can see why in this link I wonder why Microsoft implement EF 5.x that way rather than same to EF 3.0? Updated: We can tell EF not use pluralized name by using this code in the context class: protected override void OnModelCreating(DbModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Conventions.Remove<PluralizingTableNameConvention>();

    base.OnModelCreating(modelBuilder);
}
 Even if EF tool generates pluralized name, it should keep the mappings to the original database, shouldn't it? Because some users might want to change a few name of fields on their class. EF 3.0 works well, but EF 5.x does not. Guys, can you give my a reason, please!

public class User {
    // ...

@CONTENT:I have a Basic Authentication setup on a development server. It is setup inside my httpd.conf file for the VirtualHost of the website. I've had to set up it to exclude certain directories, which has caused no problems and all works fine. The issue has been with excluding a URL that has been through my mod_rewrite rules in the .htaccess file. My set up is that I have all URLs going through my index.php file and from there the relevant code is found and ran. I tried adding the URL that I wanted to exclude (/businesses/upload_logo) like I did the others but it still requires authentication. This is what I currently have: ...

....

I'm aware that I could use some more SetEnvIf HOST ... but I'm looking to see if it can be fixed this way or not first. The mod_rewrite rule: ...

@TITLE:Problems Saving Large Number of Attribute Option Labels in Magento
@CONTENT:I'm running into a problem in a Magento system where saving a large number of attributes either doesn't work at all, or only partially works. It appears to be a javascript related issue, and I was hoping someone on Stack Overflow had some "known science" for dealing with this situation, or could point me in the right direction. The basic problem is, the Magento system in question has over 250 color attribute option labels. If an admin user attempts to manage these by doing the following Navigating to Catalog -> Attributes -> Manage Attributes Selecting the color attributes Clicking on the Manage Label/Options tab Editing the last Label Option Clicking "Save and Continue Edit" One of two things happens. In Google Chrome on OS X, the button sticks in the "depressed" state, and after a period of time Google Chrome's "This page is not responsive" kill dialog comes up. In a mozilla based browser on OS X, clicking the button makes the browser "think" for a bit, but it eventually submits the form. However, only a partial list of attribute labels is posted to the admin controller. This means the user can only edit the first 75 - 100 labels, since the other labels are never submitted. I have reports from windows users describing the second behavior as well (browsers are non-specific) The obvious answers are to either investigate the poorly performing javascript, or (Grouch Marx style) "don't do that". Before I spend the time profiling/excavating the javascript on that page, I was hoping there was some known fix for this, or specific knowledge as to what was causing the problem. Magento CE 1.7.x, if it maters. Update: The Javascript performance issues are a red herring. They're caused by the massive number of input fields being iterated through in js/prototype/validation.js
 Specifically in this try catch block     try {
        if(this.options.stopOnFirst) {
            result = Form.getElements(this.form).all(function(elm) {
                if (elm.hasClassName('local-validation') && !this.isElementInForm(elm, this.form)) {
                    return true;
                }
                return Validation.validate(elm,{useTitle : useTitles, onElementValidate : callback});
            }, this);
        } else {
            result = Form.getElements(this.form).collect(function(elm) {
                if (elm.hasClassName('local-validation') && !this.isElementInForm(elm, this.form)) {
                    return true;
                }
                return Validation.validate(elm,{useTitle : useTitles, onElementValidate : callback});
            }, this).all();
        }
    } catch (e) {
    }
 However, even if I short circuit this and have the function return true, the behavior of not saving all the labels persists.
@CODE:js/prototype/validation.js try {
        if(this.options.stopOnFirst) {
            result = Form.getElements(this.form).all(function(elm) {
                if (elm.hasClassName('local-validation') && !this.isElementInForm(elm, this.form)) {
                    return true;
                }
                return Validation.validate(elm,{useTitle : useTitles, onElementValidate : callback});
            }, this);
        } else {

 However now I have a requirement that I have the mp3 byte data in memory instead of an File Object. The reason is the mp3 file is encrypted and then shipped along with the program. Hence I need to decrypt the mp3 file in memory or input stream.

@LINK:/questions/13534030/can-a-scheduled-future-cause-a-memory-leak
@TITLE:Can a scheduled future cause a memory leak?
@CONTENT:I think I have a memory leak in my Android live wallpaper. Whenever I rotate the screen, the amount of memory garbage collected increases by 50kb and doesn't go back down. I think it may be caused by a scheduled future, so I'm going to present a scenario to see if that's the case. Let's say you have a class (let's call it Foo) that has the following members. private ScheduledFuture<?> future;
private final ScheduledExecutorService scheduler = Executors
        .newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor();

private final Runnable runnable = new Runnable() {
    public void run() {
        // Do stuff
    }
};
 And now you set a scheduled future future = scheduler.scheduleAtFixedRate(runnable, delay, speed,
                TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
 The future holds a reference to the runnable, and the runnable holds a reference to the parent Foo object. I'm not sure if this is the case, but could this fact mean that if nothing in the program holds a reference to Foo, the garbage collector still cannot collect it because there is a scheduled future? I'm not too good at multithreading, so I don't know if the code I've shown means the scheduled task will live longer than the object, meaning it won't end up being garbage collected. If this scenario will not result in preventing Foo from being garbage collection, I just need to be told that with a simple explanation. If it does prevent Foo from being garbage collected, then how do I fix it? Do have to do future.cancel(true); future = null;? Is the future = null part unnecessary?
@CODE:private ScheduledFuture<?> future;
private final ScheduledExecutorService scheduler = Executors
        .newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor();

private final Runnable runnable = new Runnable() {
    public void run() {
        // Do stuff
    }
}; future = scheduler.scheduleAtFixedRate(runnable, delay, speed,

For development purposes in many cases you use not only different services (and connections for them), but sometimes you need to Mock them, or create Dummy instances. Yesterday I figured out one solution with Spring annotation:     @Value("#{${env} == "production" ? realService : dummyService}")
    private SomeService service;
 ...which should work, but not nice. I would be very interested for your solutions, or arguments: why is it not a real issue ;-) Guice, Spring, or any other are welcome. The original issue was a part of this thread: Spring @Autowired usage, but I thought it worth a new thread to be created.

@CONTENT:I'm trying to understand sagas, and meanwhile I have a specific way of thinking of them - but I am not sure whether I got the idea right. Hence I'd like to elaborate and have others tell me whether it's right or wrong. In my understanding, sagas are a solution to the question of how to model long-running processes. Long-running means: Involving multiple commands, multiple events and possibly multiple aggregates. The process is not modeled inside one of the participating aggregates to avoid dependencies between them. Basically, a saga is nothing more but a command / event handler that reacts on internal and external commands / events. It does not contain its own logic, it's just a (finite) state machine, and therefor provides tasks such as When event X happens, send command Y. Sagas are persisted to the event store as well as aggregates, are correlated to a specific aggregate instance, and hence are reloaded when this specific aggregate (or set of aggregates) is used. Is this right?

 But the problem I know is Dereferencing a void pointer is undefined behaviour. Sometimes It may give error :Invalid use of void expression. My main funciton is : int main()
{

int i=5;
float f=5.6f;
char c='a';

incr(&i);
incr(&f);
incr(&c);

return 0;
}
 The problem is how to solve this ? Is there a way to solve it in Conly or will I have to define incr() for each datatypes ? if yes, then what's the use of void * Same problem with the swap() and sort() .I want to swap and sort all kinds of data types with same function.

@CONTENT:I'm just getting to understand Ajax and JSON format. I'm building a very simple address book. So assume I have a table with for sake of simplicity has 3 columns: Name, Email and Phone My javascript / jquery is not the best just learning, but I want to put the data returned from my SQL Server into JSON format. Should I create a stored procedure that can create a json file and put it in a folder where I can use it in my javascript? Or is this something like a client C# / VB.net app should be doing where it actually generates the file every say 5 minutes? Basically lets assume I get some data back: George g@yahoo.com 123-3333
Mike m@gmail.com 123-4433
Steve s@gmail.com 144-3333
Jill r@gmail.com 333-3333
 I get this back from a simple select statement: SELECT name, email, phone from myTable How can I then get this as a json file so I can store the data in a .json and then use that file in my javascript code. Can someone explain this as well as how people generate json files?

@TITLE:Did Azure 1.8 (Oct 2012) change the way you configure multiple sites in the ServiceDefinition?
@CONTENT:Before upgrading to 1.8 (Oct 2012) this is how we configured our sites in the ServiceDefinition. <Site name="Admin" physicalDirectory="..\Company.Admin">
  <Bindings>
    <Binding name="AdminBindingHttp" endpointName="HttpEndpoint" hostHeader="admin.company.com" />
  </Bindings>
</Site>
 After we upgraded I was getting the following error when trying to publish. Error 125 Cannot find the physical directory 'C:\Users\Me\Code\Company.Cloud\bin\Company.Admin' for virtual path Admin/.
 We had to update the physicalDirectory value and move up 2 more folders. <Site name="Admin" physicalDirectory="..\..\..\Company.Admin">
  <Bindings>
    <Binding name="AdminBindingHttp" endpointName="HttpEndpoint" hostHeader="admin.company.com" />
  </Bindings>
</Site>
 It seems that previous to 1.8 Azure was executing in context of the original location of the csdef file but now it's executing from the bin\Release\ServiceDefinition.csdef which is 2 folders deeper. I've been unsuccessful at finding a tutorial online that specifically talks about this feature used with the latest SDK version. Was this an official change? I should also mention that we also upgraded to VS 2012 at the same time. I feel like this feature is constantly neglected. (See lack of .config transforms issue). We would love to switch to Azure WebSites but we're unable to do so until SSL/HTTPS is available and it is out of preview.

@TITLE:how to work with spreadsheets using Google Drive API on iOS
@CONTENT:I'm trying to write an iPhone app that stores its database in a Google spreadsheet. I followed the DrEdit example here which uses the Drive API to read/write plain text files to Google Drive. I'm trying to modify the example app to work with spreadsheets instead. I was able to upload a csv file and ask Google to convert it. However, what I really want is to directly work with mimeType: "application/vnd.google-apps.spreadsheet". I'm very new at this and it would be extremely helpful if someone could point me to an example. For starters, I'd like to achieve something like the following - (void)uploadSpreadSheetWithThreeCells {
GTLUploadParameters *uploadParameters = nil;

NSString *data = @"cell1,cell2,cell3";

NSData *spreadSheetContent = nil;

/* 
  How to initialize spreadSheetContent with data? 
*/

[GTLUploadParameters uploadParametersWithData:spreadSheetContent
      MIMEType:@"application/vnd.google-apps.spreadsheet"];

GTLQueryDrive *query = [GTLQueryDrive queryForFilesInsertWithObject:self.driveFile
                                        uploadParameters:uploadParameters];

[self.driveService executeQuery:query completionHandler:nil];
}
 Also, is Google Drive API the right thing to use? Ultimately, I want to have the ability to update selected cells of a spreadsheet instead of uploading an entire document. I found some other options such as the gdata api and spreadsheet api, but it seems that Drive API is the newest and it's supposed to contain the functionalities of the other two? Thanks in advance!
@CODE:- (void)uploadSpreadSheetWithThreeCells {
GTLUploadParameters *uploadParameters = nil;

NSString *data = @"cell1,cell2,cell3";

NSData *spreadSheetContent = nil;

/*

[GTLUploadParameters uploadParametersWithData:spreadSheetContent

                                        uploadParameters:uploadParameters];

@TITLE:Why do I need to use std::move in the initialization list of a move-constructor?
@CONTENT:Let's say I have a (trivial) class, which is move-constructible and move-assignable but not copy-constructable or copy-assignable: class movable
{
  public:
    explicit movable(int) {}
    movable(movable&&) {}
    movable& operator=(movable&&) { return *this; }
    movable(const movable&) = delete;
    movable& operator=(const movable&) = delete;
};
 This works fine: movable m1(movable(17));
 This, of course, does not work, because m1 is not an rvalue: movable m2(m1);
 But, I can wrap m1 in std::move, which casts it to an rvalue-reference, to make it work: movable m2(std::move(m1));
 So far, so good. Now, let's say I have a (equally trivial) container class, which holds a single value: template <typename T>
class container
{
  public:
    explicit container(T&& value) : value_(value) {}
  private:
    T value_;
};
 This, however, does not work: container<movable> c(movable(17));
 The compiler (I've tried clang 4.0 and g++ 4.7.2) complains that I'm trying to use movable's deleted copy-constructor in container's initialization list. Again, wrapping value in std::move makes it work:     explicit container(T&& value) : value_(std::move(value)) {}
 But why is std::move needed in this case? Isn't value already of type movable&&? How is value_(value) different from movable m1(movable(42))?
@CODE:class movable
{
  public:
    explicit movable(int) {}
    movable(movable&&) {}
    movable& operator=(movable&&) { return *this; }
    movable(const movable&) = delete;
    movable& operator=(const movable&) = delete;
}; movable m1(movable(17)); m1 movable m2(m1); m1 std::move movable m2(std::move(m1)); template <typename T>
class container
{
  public:
    explicit container(T&& value) : value_(value) {}
  private:
    T value_;
}; container<movable> c(movable(17)); movable container value std::move explicit container(T&& value) : value_(std::move(value)) {} std::move value movable&& value_(value) movable m1(movable(42)) T&& value

I've configured the dependency compile configuration with the jars that are needed to go into the distribution.

@TITLE:Upload a file MVC 4 Web API .NET 4
@CONTENT:I'm using the version of MVC that shipped with Visual Studio 2012 express. (Microsoft.AspNet.Mvc.4.0.20710.0) I assume this is RTM version. I've found plenty of examples online which all use this code:     public Task<HttpResponseMessage> PostFormData()
    {
        // Check if the request contains multipart/form-data.
        if (!Request.Content.IsMimeMultipartContent())
        {
            throw new HttpResponseException(HttpStatusCode.UnsupportedMediaType);
        }

        string root = HttpContext.Current.Server.MapPath("~/App_Data");
        var provider = new MultipartFormDataStreamProvider(root);

        // Read the form data and return an async task.
        var task = Request.Content.ReadAsMultipartAsync(provider).
            ContinueWith<HttpResponseMessage>(t =>
            {
                if (t.IsFaulted || t.IsCanceled)
                {
                    return Request.CreateErrorResponse(HttpStatusCode.InternalServerError, t.Exception);
                }

                // This illustrates how to get the file names.
                foreach (MultipartFileData file in provider.FileData)
                {
                    Trace.WriteLine(file.Headers.ContentDisposition.FileName);
                    Trace.WriteLine("Server file path: " + file.LocalFileName);
                }
                return Request.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.OK);
            });

        return task;
    }
 But this code always ends up in continueWith where t.IsFaulted == true. The exception reads: Unexpected end of MIME multipart stream. MIME multipart message is not complete. Here is my client form. NOthing fancy, I want to do jquery form pluging for ajax upload, but I can't even get this way to work. <form name="uploadForm" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data" action="api/upload" >
    <input type="file" />
    <input type="submit" value="Upload" />
</form>
 I've read that it is caused by the parser expecting /CR /LF at the end of each message, and that bug has been fixed in June. What I cannot figure out is, if it was really fixed, why isn't it included this version of MVC 4? Why do so many examples on the internet tout that this code works when it does not in this version of MVC 4?
@CODE:public Task<HttpResponseMessage> PostFormData()

@TITLE:How to improve the speed of VBA macro code?
@CONTENT:I do not have much experience with writing macros, and therefore need the help of this community for the following issue encountered: My macro copies a range of values entered in a vertical range in one worksheet and then pastes the values horizontally (transpose) in another worksheet. It would in theory paste the values from the first sheet to first row of the second worksheet which does not have content. Since the first five rows have contents, it thus pastes the values to the sixth row. The problem I have with the running of the macro is that I feel like it is too slow and I would therefore like it to run faster. I have the same macro doing the same thing but that instead pastes the values to another worksheet to the first row, and it runs perfect. My best guess is therefore that the second macro is running slow because it has to start pasting on the sixth row and there may be some contents on the first 5 rows that take a lot of time for the macro to go through (there a lot of cell references to other workbooks) to determine where the next row for pasting should be. That is my best guess though and since I hardly know anything about macros, I cannot say for sure what the problem is. I hereby provide you with the code of my macro and sincerely hope that somebody can tell me what is making my macro slow and provide me with a solution as to how to make it run faster. I am thinking that a solution might potentially be that the macro should not consider the first five rows of data and start pasting immediately on row 6 for the first entry. Then on row 7 the next time, and etc. This might be a solution but I do not know how to write the code in a way that it would do that. Thank you for taking time and helping me to find a solution, here is the code: Sub Macro1()

@TITLE:Entity Framework: Check all relationships of an entity for foreign key use
@CONTENT:I have an entity, let's call it CommonEntity that has a primary key used as a foreign key in many other entities. As the application is developed these links will continue to grow. I'd like a way to see if CommonEntity can be safely deleted (i.e. it's not used by any other entities). I realise I can do if(!ce.EntityA.Any() && !ce.EntityB.Any() ... && !ce.EntityN.Any())
{
   //Delete
}
 but I'm hoping for a way to just check all of the relationships automatically, as I don't love the idea of having to come back and change this code manually every time we add a new relationship. Perhaps there is something in EF4+ that I'm not aware of? I thought it might be possible to use a transaction scope to just try and delete the object and roll it back if it fails, but I wasn't sure if there were any adverse side effects with this approach. Is there a better approach? EDIT: Looks like VS2012 has used EF5 even though the project is .Net 4, so it has created the model with POCOs even though it was generated from a DB.

 to output: Dog: woof

(let-binding [speak (fn [] "meow")] ...)
 Rather, I want the with-animal to make the speak function map to some method of the object I'm calling with. Is there a clean way to do this in Clojure? Thanks!

@TITLE:A `position:fixed` sidebar whose width is set in percentage?
@CONTENT:I've successfully used the beautiful Susy grid system to create a responsive layout similiar to the one of WebDesignerWall.com: What i failed to implement is a position:fixed sidebar. Such a sidebar would not scroll when the page is scrolled and stays on the same place. That's fantastically convenient (anyway, you actually can't put more content into the sidebar, because it would clutter the top of page in a narrow window). My layout goes crazy whenever i apply position:fixed to a column: The colored blocks are declared three-column wide, but stretch further when position:fixed is applied to the sidebar.. I think the problem is that the width of the sidebar is relative, i. e. set in percentage. Due to position:fixed, the width is measured against the width of the browser window, not its container (though i set the container to position:relative). The question is: how do i make a column fixed to the window while measuring its width against its container, not the viewport? Maybe it's possible to fix the position of an element with JS? PS I've tried the width: inherit solution, but it wasn't of any help to my situation.

@TITLE:Trouble installing SciPy on windows
@CONTENT:I have Python 2.7 and NumPy installed. I have downloaded pre-built binaries for SciPy, but the install script fails with this error: Blas (http://www.netlib.org/blas/) libraries not found. Directories to search for the libraries can be specified in the numpy/distutils/site.cfg file (section [blas]) or by setting the BLAS environment variable. I really don't know enough about this to fool with it. I assumed it was a straightforward install process, but doesn't appear to be. I googled for the BLAS environment variable, but couldn't find anything that seemed appropriate. Any help is appreciated. Mike EDIT: Nevermind, I found an unofficial installer exe.

@CONTENT:I need a VCL tag editor component for Delphi or C++Builder, similar to what's available for JavaScript: e.g. this one, or this one or StackOverflow's own tags editor. Is there something like this available or do I need to make it from scratch? Some specific things that I need are: Editor should allow either scrolling or become multi-line if more tags are present than the editor's width allows. If multi-line, there should be an option to define some maximum height however, preventing it from becoming too tall Option to select whether tags are created when pressing space or comma key Prompt text in the editor, when it is not focused (for example "Add new tag") Ideally, you should be able to move between tags (highlighting them) using the keyboard arrows, so you can delete any tag using the keyboard only

@CONTENT:I have a large Pandas DataFrame <class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
DatetimeIndex: 3425100 entries, 2011-12-01 00:00:00 to 2011-12-31 23:59:59
Data columns:

 I select a subset of that DataFrame using .ix[start_datetime:end_datetime] and I pass this to a peakdetect function which returns the index and value of the local maxima and minima in two seperate lists. I extract the index position of the maxima and using DataFrame.index I get a list of pandas TimeStamps. I then attempt to extract the relevant subset of the large DataFrame by passing the list of TimeStamps to .ix[] but it always seems to return an empty DataFrame. I can loop over the list of TimeStamps and get the relevant rows from the DataFrame but this is a lengthy process and I thought that ix[] should accept a list of values according to the docs?

 Update 2: I created a gist, which actually works because when the data is loaded in from csv the index columns of timestamps are stored as numpy array of objects which appear to be strings. Unlike in my own code where the index is of type <class 'pandas.tseries.index.DatetimeIndex'> and each element is of type <class 'pandas.lib.Timestamp'>, I thought passing a list of pandas.lib.Timestamp would work the same as passing individual timestamps, would this be considered a bug? If I create the original DataFrame with the index as a list of strings, querying with a list of strings works fine. It does increase the byte size of the DataFrame significantly though. Update 3: The error only appears to occur with very large DataFrames, I reran the code on varying sizes of DataFrame ( some detail in a comment below ) and it appears to occur on a DataFrame above 2.7 million records. Using strings as opposed to TimeStamps resolves the issue but increases memory usage. Fixed In latest github master (18/09/2012), see comment from Wes at bottom of page.

 Without the OtherClass reference in SpecialOrder I can create objects freely without problems (including SpecialOrder, SuperSpecialOrder etc). Anyone have a clue what's going on? I'm lost here :( Edit I've seen in other questions that people remove the TenantId from tables, this is not an option since primary keys are not unique across tenants and we want to keep the shared data architecture. I know the workaround is having a second TenantId in the SpecialOrder class, but this does not seem logical to me.

@CONTENT:How could I set JSON provider for RestEasy at JBoss 7.1.1? RestEasy documentation says: RESTEasy allows you to marshall JAXB annotated POJOs to and from JSON. This provider wraps the Jettison JSON library to accomplish this. But I found that it seems that on JBoss 7.1.1 Resteasy uses Jackson provider because @XmlTransient on my class field was ignored, but @JsonIgnore was processed. How can I tell to Resteasy to use Jettison instead of Jackson? On Jboss I found both providers.
@CODE:If you have the resteasy-jackson-provider-xxx.jar in your classpath, the Jackson JSON provider will be triggered. This will screw up code that is dependent on the Jettison JAXB/JSon provider. If you had been using the Jettison JAXB/Json providers, you must either remove Jackson from your WEB-INF/lib or classpath, or use the @NoJackson annotation on your JAXB classes.

Essentially the application will run and only be visible as an icon in the system tray, and do stuff when you press certain shortcut keys (eg, Ctrl-Shift-f4 or something). I am under the impression that Qt doesn't provide a way to handle shortcut keys unless the application is in focus, which, in my case it won't be.

This means for every tile_number, there might be several point_id:point_info 2) Line information which is stored as (tile_number, line_id:line_info) , this is again a 1:m key-value pairs and for every tile_number, there might be more than one line_id:line_info As you can see the tile_numbers are the same between the two datasets. now what I really need is to join these two datasets based on each tile_number. In other words for every tile_number, we have n point_id:point_info and m line_id:line_info. What I want to do is to join all pairs of point_id:point_info with all pairs of line_id:line_info for every tile_number In order to clarify, here's an example: For point pairs: (tile0, point0)
(tile0, point1)
(tile1, point1)

 for line pairs: (tile0, line0)

@TITLE:Implementing the visitor pattern using C++ Templates
@CONTENT:I've been trying to reduce the amount of boilerplate in my code, by using C++ Templates to implement the visitor pattern. So far I've come up with this: class BaseVisitor {
public:
    virtual ~BaseVisitor() {}
};

template<typename T>
class Visitor : public BaseVisitor {
public:
    virtual void visit(T& /* visitable */) = 0;
};

template<typename Derived>
class Visitable {
public:
    void accept(Visitor<Derived>& visitor) {
        visitor.visit(static_cast<Derived&>(*this));
    }
};
 And each subclass of Visitable looks like this: class Mesh : public Object, public Visitable<Mesh> {};
class Text : public Object, public Visitable<Text> {};
 And finally the Visitor looks like this: class Renderer : public Visitor<Mesh>, public Visitor<Text> {}
 So far so good... now here's the problem: for(Scene::iterator it = scene.begin(); it != scene.end(); ++it) {
    Object& object = static_cast<Object&>(*it);
    if(pre_visit(object)) {
        object.accept(this); ///Erm, what do I cast to??
        post_visit(object);
    }
}
 I need to somehow cast to Visitable so that I can call accept(), but obviously I don't know what T is. Alternatively I can't add a virtual accept() to the Visitable template, because I don't know what argument it should take. Any C++ Templating guru's out there know how to make this work?
@CODE:class BaseVisitor {
public:
    virtual ~BaseVisitor() {}
};

template<typename T>
class Visitor : public BaseVisitor {

When a word is highlighted by the style ".spellword", it indicates to the user to spell that word. When the user goes to drag a letter into that area he/she can drag the letter anywhere in the 3 letter space, but I need them to be dropped from "left" to "right" to ensure the word is spelt in the correct order. Basically when a letter is dropped onto the word I need it to snap to the left (first letter of the word) and then the next letter dropped snaps onto the next letter of the word etc...so it is spelt in the correct order What can I do to ensure this? The script for the draggable and droppable is... $('.drag').draggable({
helper: 'clone',
snap: '.drop',
grid: [62, 62],
revert: 'invalid',
snapMode: 'corner',
start: function(){
    var validDrop = $('.drop-box.spellword');
    validDrop.addClass('drop');
    makeDroppables();
}
});


function makeDroppables(){   
$('.drop').droppable({
drop: function(event, ui) {
    word = $(this).data('word');
    guesses[word].push($(ui.draggable).attr('data-letter'));

    if ($(this).text() == $(ui.draggable).text().trim()) {

        $(this).addClass('wordglow3');
    } else {
        $(this).addClass('wordglow');
    }


    if (guesses[word].length == 3) {
        if (guesses[word].join('') == word) {
            $('td[data-word=' + word + ']').addClass('wordglow2');

        } else {
            $('td[data-word=' + word + ']').addClass("wordglow4");
            guesses[word].splice(0, guesses[word].length);
        }
    }
},


activate: function(event, ui) {
    word = $(this).data('word');

    // try to remove the class
    $('td[data-word=' + word + ']').removeClass('wordglow').removeClass('wordglow4').removeClass('wordglow3');
}

});

}
 HTML for draggables is.... <div class="squares">

@CONTENT:I just updated my Macbook to Mountain Lion, but now I'm not able to install some gems, because of the below error about headers.

But still no luck. Any suggestions? ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension. (Gem::Installer::ExtensionBuildError)

@CONTENT:I am trying to: Generate a byte array. Convert that byte array to base64 Convert that base64 string back to a byte array. I've tried out a few solutions, for example those in this question. For some reason the initial and final byte arrays do not match. Here is the code used: using (RNGCryptoServiceProvider rng = new RNGCryptoServiceProvider())
    {
         byte[] originalArray = new byte[32];
         rng.GetBytes(key);
         string temp_inBase64 = Convert.ToBase64String(originalArray);
         byte[] temp_backToBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(temp_inBase64);
    }
 My questions are: Why do "originalArray" and "temp_backToBytes" not match? (originalArray has length of 32, temp_backToBytes has a length of 44, but their values are also different) Is it possible to convert back and forth, and if so, how do I accomplish this?

/home/***/public_html/prestashop/img/p/3
/home/***/public_html/prestashop/img/p
/home/***/public_html/prestashop/img
 These are the problem folders. At the first time I think - "May is a problem with the chmod of the files" but when I test with all files chmod permission 755 (after that with 777) - the result was the same.

@TITLE:How does the compiler know to move local variables?
@CONTENT:I'm curious as to exactly how this feature works. Consider something like std::unique_ptr<int> f() { std::unique_ptr<int> lval(nullptr); return lval; }
 This code compiles fine even for a move-only type, as the compiler implicitly moves it. But logically, for any return expression, determining whether or not the result refers to a local variable would be solving the Halting Problem- and if the compiler simply treated all local variables as rvalues in the return expression, then this would be problematic as the variable may be referred to in that one expression multiple times. Even if a local only had one direct reference, you would not be able to prove that it did not have other indirect aliases. So how does the compiler know when to move from the return expression?

@TITLE:How to automatically refresh Cache using Google Guava?
@CONTENT:I am using Google Guava library for caching. For automatic cache refresh we can do as follows: cache = CacheBuilder.newBuilder()               
                    .refreshAfterWrite(15, TimeUnit.MINUTES)
                    .maximumSize(100)

 However, automatic refreshes are performed when the first stale request for an entry occurs. Is there a way to refresh it automatically even though no requests came for cache data? Like for every 15 minutes the cache data should be pulled from Db and load it, no matter whether anybody called cache data or not. Also, Guava's cache expiry time is for entire cache. Is it possible to expire cache values based on key? Like cache data with key "NOT_SO_FREQ_CHANGE_DATA" to expire for every 1 hour and data with key "FREQ_CHANGING_DATA" should expire for every 15 minutes?
@CODE:cache = CacheBuilder.newBuilder()

@CONTENT:I'm curious as to exactly how this feature works. Consider something like std::unique_ptr<int> f() { std::unique_ptr<int> lval(nullptr); return lval; }
 This code compiles fine even for a move-only type, as the compiler implicitly moves it. But logically, for any return expression, determining whether or not the result refers to a local variable would be solving the Halting Problem- and if the compiler simply treated all local variables as rvalues in the return expression, then this would be problematic as the variable may be referred to in that one expression multiple times. Even if a local only had one direct reference, you would not be able to prove that it did not have other indirect aliases. So how does the compiler know when to move from the return expression?

@TITLE:Method pointer and regular procedure incompatible
@CONTENT:I have an app, which has multiple forms. All these forms have a PopupMenu. I build the menu items programatically, all under a common root menu item. I want ALL the menu items to call the same procedure, and the menu item itself is basically acting as an argument.... I had this working when I just had one form doing this functionality. I now have multiple forms needing to do this. I am moving all my code to a common unit. Example.
Form A has PopupMenu 1.  When clicked, call code in Unit CommonUnit.
Form B has PopupMenu 2.  When clicked, call code in unit CommonUnit.
 When I need to call my popup from each form, I call my top level procedure (which is in unit CommonUnit), passing the name of the top menu item from each form to the top level procedure in the common unit. I am adding items to my PopupMenu with with code. M1 := TMenuItem.Create(TopMenuItem);
M1.Caption := FieldByName('NAME').AsString;
M1.Tag := FieldByName('ID').AsInteger;
M1.OnClick := BrowseCategories1Click;
TopMenuItem.Add(M1);
 I am getting an error message when I compile. Specifically, the OnClick line is complaining about Incompatible types: 'method pointer and regular procedure'. I have defined BrowseCategories1Click exactly like it was before when I was doing this on a single form. The only difference is that it is now defined in a common unit, rather than as part of a form. It is defined as procedure BrowseCategories1Click(Sender: TObject);
begin
//
end;
 What is the easiest way to get around this? Thanks GS

@TITLE:How do you configure aspectj maven plugin to use Java 7?
@CONTENT:What are the appropriate configuration/versions/plugin versions for the aspectj plugin to use Java 7? I am trying to upgrade from Java 6 to Java 7, and the aspectj compiler seems to not be compiling Java 7. I'm specifying the java source and target version as 1.7 in the plugin configuration for aspectj plugin and for the maven compiler plugin. I introduced Java7-specific syntax to my code, adding several language features such as string in switch and the diamond operator. During the build, I get errors from aspectj about the Java7 syntax. The first sign that things are going wrong is: [INFO] --- aspectj-maven-plugin:1.4:compile (default) @ site ---
[ERROR] Cannot switch on a value of type String. Only int values or enum constants are permitted
[ERROR] Cannot instantiate the type HashSet<?>
[ERROR] Syntax error on token "<", ? expected after this token
 If I remove the executions section from the aspectj maven plugin so it doesn't run, and use mvn clean install, the new code compiles fine. So I think it's something misconfigured with aspectj. Here is my plugin configuration: <properties>

 This is in DEBUG mode with NO FILTERS applied on the LogCat! What could be causing this behavior? Is there a way to tell what's causing this exception? Update: Thanks to @assylias below, I've been able to implement: final UncaughtExceptionHandler subclass = Thread.currentThread().getUncaughtExceptionHandler();
Thread.setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler(new Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler() {
    @Override
    public void uncaughtException(Thread paramThread, Throwable paramThrowable) {
    Log.getStackTraceString(paramThrowable);

    subclass.uncaughtException(paramThread, paramThrowable);
    }
});

 This is certainly much more useful information, but now I'm struggling with the following: The application doesn't force-close now, despite the call to subclass.uncaughtException(). Why? What is the meaning of all those stack overflows? What could I be doing that's so taxing on my poor Android test device? How can I tell which part in my code causes this? Update: Log.getStackTraceString(paramThrowable); wasn't actually printing anything. The extra print that I received was from the bogus subclass.uncaughtException(paramThread, paramThrowable); The right way of logging the full stack trace is by using Log.e(TAG, "uncaughtException", throwable). The only question remaining now is how do I re-throw the exception? Just do a throw paramThrowable? Answering my last question: Eclipse won't let me throw without surrounding with try/catch, which led me to understand that what I want is not a re-throw but a killProcess(). Problem solved.

@TITLE:python: break or exit out of with statement?
@CONTENT:I'd just like to exit out of a with statement under certain conditions: with open(path) as f:
    print 'before condition'
    if <condition>: break #syntax error!
    print 'after condition'
 Of course, the above doesn't work. Is there a way to do this? (I know that I can invert the condition: if not <condition>: print 'after condition' -- any way that is like above?)

@TITLE:Why is the -ObjC linker flag needed to link categories in static libraries? (LLVM)
@CONTENT:Regarding this technical Q&A from Apple: http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#qa/qa1490/_index.html I think the compiler could mark calls to methods defined in categories at compile-time (it knows that they were defined in a category and not the main class because the prototype was in an @interface Class (Category) section) - so it could build a table in the object files of "external category methods". Then the linker, after doing its normal linking, should be able to concatenate/merge and process the "external category methods" tables from all objects and look for matching symbols in matching class categories from all the linked frameworks/libraries/objects, then it can pull in the ones that weren't already 'in' the target. There must be something I'm missing, but what is it? Why is this not possible?

@LINK:/questions/11067881/android-when-is-opengl-context-destroyed
@TITLE:Android: When is OpenGL context destroyed?
@CONTENT:On android, the GLSurfaceView documentation says this: A GLSurfaceView must be notified when the activity is paused and resumed. GLSurfaceView clients are required to call onPause() when the activity pauses and onResume() when the activity resumes. These calls allow GLSurfaceView to pause and resume the rendering thread, and also allow GLSurfaceView to release and recreate the OpenGL display. So I'm supposed to do something like this in my activity: public void onPause() {
    myGlSurfaceView.onPause();
}

public void onResume() {
    myGlSurfaceView.onResume();
}
 I'm observing in my code that if I don't call onPause() and onResume() then the context is not lost when I press the home button, so I can switch between applications and then go back to my game and everything is working. What I see is that if I close the game using the back button then the screen is black when I open it again, but I can change the back button behaviour to totally close the game and avoid this problem. So my question is: when is the openGL context destroyed? If I don't call onPause() and onResume() can I assume that it will never be destroyed? EDIT: I'm targeting Android 2.2, so setPreserveEGLContextOnPause() is not an option to me.

    myGlSurfaceView.onPause();
}

public void onResume() {

@CONTENT:I am using NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore to sync some preference data to iCloud. I found that if the user disable "Document & Data" item of iCloud in "Setting App", NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore can not synchronize its data to iCloud. So, I want to first check if this setting is switched on.After googling,I found this Code snippet¡G     NSURL *ubiq = [[NSFileManager defaultManager]

        [av show];

    }
 What I want to know is whether this is the only way to detect, even if I just use NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore (not iCloud document storage). Is there a better alternative?

 I have check cd_storage_conf.xml validity state and everything is OK (try to open XML via IE and it is showed correctly). When I republish the page (Finish Editing) everything is correct state after reload the page until the first change on any components is made. This unexpected state gave me such a strong pain and headache, furthermore create me a so nervous... :).

@TITLE:R - Order a factor based on value in one or more other columns
@CONTENT:I've looked through a number of posts about ordering factors, but haven't quite found a match for my problem. Unfortunately, my knowledge of R is still pretty rudimentary. I have a subset of an archaeological artifact catalog that I'm working with. I'm trying to cross-tabulate diagnostic historical artifact types and site testing locations. Easy enough with ddply or tapply. My problem is that I want to sort the artifact types (a factor) by their mean diagnostic date (number/year), and I keep getting them alphabetically. I know I need to make it an ordered factor, but can't figure out how to order it by the year value in the other column. IDENTIFY                                      MIDDATE

 Which needs to be ordered: IDENTIFY                                      MIDDATE

 The factor (IDENTIFY) needs to be ordered by the Date (MIDDATE). I thought I had it with Catalog$IDENTIFY<-factor(Catalog$IDENTIFY,levels=Catalog$MIDDATE,ordered=TRUE)
 but get the warning: In `levels<-`(`*tmp*`, value = if (nl == nL) as.character(labels) 
else paste0(labels,: duplicated levels will not be allowed 
in factors anymore
 IDENTIFY has ~130 factor levels and many have the same value for MIDDATE, so I need to order IDENTIFY by MIDDATE and another column TYPENAME. A little more detail: I have a dataframe Catalog, which breaks down (i.e. str(Catalog)) as: > str(Catalog)

 I need to make IDENTIFY an ordered factor, and reorder by MIDDATE -> TYPENAME -> alpha by IDENTIFY. What I'm not really getting is how to reorder by combined orders from multiple columns. I would just do this in the db, but a lot of what I'm running are weighted means within all sorts of cross-tabulations (e.g. weighted mean depths below ground surface for artifact classes by location)... ...doable in Access, but messy and unpredictable. Far easier and cleaner to manage in R, but I'd rather not to have to manually re-sort the resulting tables. What I'm trying to produce is a number of things along these lines: >xtab.Catalog<-tapply(Catalog$Qty,list(Catalog$IDENTIFY,Catalog$TRENCH),sum)

 ...but I need them to sort in the logical (i.e. chronological/type) order instead of alphabetical. Thanks. The winning solution turned out to be: Catalog$IDENTIFY = factor(Catalog$IDENTIFY, levels =

 In onCreate of activity, I load Fragment_A in frameLayoutA and Fragment_B in frameLayoutB. public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)
{
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.main);

    fmA=(FrameLayout) findViewById(R.id.frameLayoutA);
    fmB=(FrameLayout) findViewById(R.id.frameLayoutB);

    fragA=new FragmentA();
    fragB=new FragmentB();
    fragC=new FragmentC();
    addFragmentsInActivity(R.id.frameLayoutA,fragA);
    addFragmentsInActivity(R.id.frameLayoutB,fragB);
}

{
    FragmentManager fragmentManager = getFragmentManager();
    FragmentTransaction fragmentTransaction = fragmentManager.beginTransaction();
    fragmentTransaction.add(id, fragment);
    fragmentTransaction.commit();
}
 Using a menu operation I want to load Fragment_B in frameLayoutA and Fragment_C in frameLayoutB. The Menu operation is:     removeFragmentsInActivity(R.id.frameLayoutB,fragB);
    addFragmentsInActivity(R.id.frameLayoutB,fragC);
    if(!fragB.isAdded()){
            Log.e("check", "fragB already removed from frameLayoutB");
        removeFragmentsInActivity(R.id.frameLayoutB,fragB);
        addFragmentsInActivity(R.id.frameLayoutA,fragB);
    }
    else{
        Log.e("check", "fragB already added");
    }    

    public void removeFragmentsInActivity(int id, Fragment fragment)
    {
        FragmentManager fragmentManager = getFragmentManager();
        FragmentTransaction fragmentTransaction = fragmentManager.beginTransaction();
        fragmentTransaction.remove(fragment);
        fragmentTransaction.commit();
    }
 Fragment_B is not displayed in frameLayoutA. frameLayoutA shows Fragment_A. When Menu operation is clicked again the Fragment_B is loaded. Debugging I found that after fragB.isAdded() returns true after fragB.remove() operation is done. During 2nd menu operation fragB.isAdded() return false and fragB.add() is executed and FragmentB is shown in frameLayoutA. I understand commit is an async operation. isAdded return true because commit is async and remove operation commit is not done till the time fragB.isAdded() is called. Is it true? Kindly suggest the possible solution or approach to solve the issue. Regards, Vibhor

@TITLE:In JNI, how do I cache the class, methodID, and fieldIDs per IBM's performance recommendations?
@CONTENT:I read on on IBM that To access Java objects' fields and invoke their methods, native code must make calls to FindClass(), GetFieldID(), GetMethodId(), and GetStaticMethodID(). In the case of GetFieldID(), GetMethodID(), and GetStaticMethodID(), the IDs returned for a given class don't change for the lifetime of the JVM process. But the call to get the field or method can require significant work in the JVM, because fields and methods might have been inherited from superclasses, making the JVM walk up the class hierarchy to find them. Because the IDs are the same for a given class, you should look them up once and then reuse them. Similarly, looking up class objects can be expensive, so they should be cached as well. How does one cache the methodID, fieldID, and class objects in JNI? Are there built-in methods or a specific procedure that has to be followed?

@CONTENT:What am I doing wrong here please? I'm trying to shade alternate 24-hr daily rectangles with transparent gray. But only the last rectangle from the for-loop gets drawn(?!?)

@TITLE:Using OpenXmlReader
@CONTENT:I hate to resort to StackOverflow for something so (seemingly) basic, but I've been fighting with Microsoft for the last few hours and seem to be hitting a dead end. I am trying to read (large) Excel 2007+ spreadsheets, and Google has kindly informed me that using the OpenXml SDK is a pretty popular choice. So I gave the thing a shot, read some tutorials, checked Microsoft's own library pages, and got very little out of them all. I am using a small test spreadsheet with just one column of numbers and one of strings - large scale testing will come later. I've tried several implementations similar to the one I am about to post, and none of them read data. The code below was mostly taken from another StackOverflow thread, where it seemed to have worked - not so for me. I figured I'll have you guys check/debug/help with this version, because it'll likely be less broken than anything I have written today. static void ReadExcelFileSAX(string fileName)
    {
        using (SpreadsheetDocument spreadsheetDocument = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(fileName, true))
        {
            WorkbookPart workbookPart = spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart;
            WorksheetPart worksheetPart = workbookPart.WorksheetParts.First();

            OpenXmlPartReader reader = new OpenXmlPartReader(worksheetPart);
            string text;
            string rowNum;
            while (reader.Read())
            {
                if (reader.ElementType == typeof(Row))
                {

                        if (reader.HasAttributes)
                        {
                            rowNum = reader.Attributes.First(a => a.LocalName == "r").Value;
                            Console.Write("rowNum: " + rowNum); //we never even get here, I tested it with a breakpoint
                        }

                    } while (reader.ReadNextSibling()); // Skip to the next row
                    Console.ReadKey();
                    break; // We just looped through all the rows so no need to continue reading the worksheet
                }

            Console.WriteLine();
            Console.ReadKey();

@TITLE:R biglm with categorical variables
@CONTENT:I have a large data set I working with in R using some of the big.___() packages. It's ~ 10 gigs (100mmR x 15C) and looks like this: Price         Var1         Var2
12.45          1             1
33.67          1             2

23.99          1             1
...            ...          ...
 I am trying to predict price based on Var1 and Var2. The problem I've come up with is that Var1 and Var2 are categorical / factor variables. Var1 and Var2 each have 3 levels (1,2 and 3) but there are only 6 combinations in the data set (1,1;  1,2;  1,3;  2,2;  2,3;  3,3)
 To use factor variables in biglm() they must be present in each chunk of data that biglm uses (my understanding is that biglm breaks the data set into 'x' number of chunks and updates the regression parameters after analyzing each chunk in order to get around dealing with data sets that are larger than RAM). I've tried to subset the data but my computer can't handle it or my code is wrong: bm11 <- big.matrix(150000000, 3)
bm11 <- subset(x, x[,2] == 1 & x[,3] == 1)
 The above gives me a bunch of these: Error: cannot allocate vector of size 1.1 Gb
 Does anyone have any suggestions for working around this issue? I'm using R 64-bit on a windows 7 machine w/ 4 gigs of RAM.

@CONTENT:I'm writing an MPI-based application (but MPI doesn't matter in my question, I mention it only to expose the rationale) and in some cases, when there is less work items than processes, I need to create a new communicator excluding the processes that have nothing to do. Finally, the new communicator has to be freed by the processes that have work to do (and only by them). A neat way to do that would be to write: with filter_comm(comm, nworkitems) as newcomm:
    ... do work with communicator newcomm...
 the body being executed only by the processes that have work to do. Is there a way in a context manager to avoid executing the body? I understand that context managers have rightfully been designed to avoid hiding control flows, but I wonder if it is possible to circumvent that, since in my case I think it would be justified for clarity sake.

@CONTENT:I am playing around with new Kinect SDK v1.0.3.190. (other related questions in stackoverflow are on previous sdk of kinect) I get depth and color streams from Kinect. As the depth and RGB streams are captured with different sensors there is a misalignment between two frames as can be seen below. Only RGB Only Depth Depth & RGB I need to align them and there is a function named MapDepthToColorImagePoint exactly for this purpose. However it doesn't seem to work. here is a equally blended (depth and mapped color) result below which is created with the following code             Parallel.For(0, this.depthFrameData.Length, i =>
        {

            int baseIndex = Math.Max(0, Math.Min(this.videoBitmapData.Length - 4, (point.Y * 640 + point.X) * 4));

After reading py2exe fails to generate an executable on StackOverflow, it says I need to download this file. However, it also says all target users must download this file. This will be a huge inconvenience for my users (mostly corporate clients who will not know how to download the file), so is there a way to package the with the program? Thanks!

@TITLE:Packaging a .NET Application So It Will Run On A Computer Without .NET
@CONTENT:I have been recently trying to deploy a C# application on a computer that does not have .NET installed. I know that there have been many questions around the same topic here on StackOverflow. Here are a few of them, of which I read the responses to all: Packaging up the .net framework with a .net application deployment Run a .net application without installing .net client profile? Run C# windows application in windows XP without installing .NET Framework So all of the responses to the above questions state that it is impossible without specific software, etc. One software mentioned was the Salamander .NET Linker. The only problem with that is that I cannot seem to be able to run the application after it has been processed by Salamender. I understand that this in itself is impossible, as it requires the .NET virtual machine to run. However, in the past, I have made Java applications and along with them, I shipped the entire JVM. Surprisingly, they still worked. So the reason why this is not a duplicate of the above questions is because my true question is: What items of the .NET framework would I need to package? If I do manage to package all, would placing them in the same directory as the application I'm running allow the application to run? I found one solution to this, the Microsoft .NET Redist Package. The only problem with this is that it has a GUI of its own. Aside from that, it would be a perfect fit. So, could anyone tell me one of two things: Is there a command-line .NET package, and if so, where do I download it? If there isn't, or it would be impractical to do so, approximately what directories would I need to copy from the .NET installations? I understand that these files and directories are system specific, and that my .NET installation may not work on your computer, but if C# is like Java, then this should be achievable. Is it? Size is not a limitation, it does not matter to me whether or not the application and all its files is 1GB, or if it is only 1MB. If in case there is no other solution, I used Dependency Walker to check all the dependencies of my program. If I were to package most of them, would my application, in theory, work?

 Read P12 file to iOS project NSString *path = [[NSBundle bundleForClass:[self class]]

}
 Thought there was no err(OSStatus value is 0), but the items array didn't get any identity data. I am wondering if i didn't get the correct p12 file format due to wrong OpenSSl usage. Has anyone successfully import p12 file? I've stuck in this problem for a couple of days, please give me advices if you got clues, thanks! Hubert

@TITLE:Is it OK to use DecimalSeparator to force Floattostr/Strtofloat functions to use a decimal point
@CONTENT:Currently, I'm setting DecimalSeparator to a '.' in each procedure which uses these functions. It would be much easier to set this globally at the start of the program but I found Delphi seems to periodically set this back to the current locale. I need to make sure that a decimal point is used for all conversions no matter which country the program is used in as this is the standard for this type of program and all files structure and communication protocols, numeric displays in forms/edits etc are required to be formatted in this way. I've been told in another thread that using decimalseparator is not the correct way to do it but I was not given any alternatives. The other threads concerning this subject that I've read don't seem to offer any formative guidance or are overly complex. Is there a simple 'correct' way to do this ?

@TITLE:Writing Common Lisp code that executes from the command line, but not inside the interpreter
@CONTENT:When writing Common Lisp code, I use SLIME. In particular, I compile the buffer containing definitions of functions by using C-C C-k, and then switch to the REPL to run those functions. Putting executable code to run those functions in the buffer does not appear to work so well. If the code has bugs it can make a mess. It would be handy to have a way to include code that doesn't get compiled in the buffer, but do get run from the command line, e.g. when doing sbcl --script foo.lisp
 If that were the case, I would not have to keep adding and removing code every time I wanted to run code from the command line. Does there exist such a condition? This is analogous to the Python condition. if __name__=='__main__':
 which is false if a Python file is imported as a module, but true if it is run as a script. This blog post entitled "Using SBCL for Common Lisp shell scripting", found by random Googling, has ;; If run from command line, the following if-test will succeed

(if (> (length sb-ext:*posix-argv*) 1)

    ;; Code that is executed from the command line only goes here

)
 The code included indeed does not get run by the compiler inside SLIME, but it doesn't get run by sbcl --script either. UPDATE: Thanks to Vsevolod Dyomkin for his helpful answer and the followups. Some notes about that answer follow, compiled from the comments to that answer. @Vsevolod, if you add these to your answer, I'll delete them. First, I asked for a way to run code from the command line, but not from the interpreter. The supplied solution does more; it also gives a way to run code from the interpreter but not the command line. The first step is to define a reader macro function for the macro character #!. As stated in the link "Upon encountering a macro character, the Lisp reader calls its reader macro function". The reader function is defined by the call to set-dispatch-macro-character. So, when the #! character is seen, the set-dispatch-macro-character causes the lambda function defined in the body to be called. This function then adds the keyword :noscript to the *features* variable. See also a discussion of what reader macros are good for in the SO question Read macros: what do you use them for?. Observe that the keyword :noscript is added to *features* precisely when the #! character is present. Furthermore, the #! character is present when the code is run inside the interpreter e.g. when using slime, but apparently is absent (removed) from program's text by sbcl --script is run. Therefore, :noscript is added to *features* when the code is run in the interpeter, but not when run as a script. We now use the builtin reader macros #-/#+, which as Vsevolod said, behave similarly to the to C's #IFDEF/#IFNDEF. They check for a symbol in *features*. In this case, #-:noscript checks for the absence of :noscript, and #+:noscript checks for the presence of :noscript. If those conditions are satisfied, it runs the corresponding code. To wrap a block of code, one can use progn like this: #-:noscript (progn <your code here>). Finally, one needs to call set-dispatch-macro-character before running code that uses this functionality. In the case of sbcl, one can put it in the initialization file ~/.sbclrc. Observe that this approach does not depend on the Common Lisp implementation being SBCL. A simpler alternative, as mentioned in the sbcl-devel list, is to use the fact that the keyword :SWANK appears when one types *features* in a REPL inside emacs using SLIME. SWANK is the server side of SLIME. SLIME should probably more accurately called SLIME/SWANK, as these two are the client/server components of a client-server architecture. I found this blog post called Understanding SLIME, which was helpful. So, one can use #-:swank and #+:swank just like #-:noscript and #+:noscript, except that one doesn't need to write any code. Of course, this then won't work if one is using the command line interpreter sbcl, for instance, since then :SWANK will not appear in *features*.
@CODE:sbcl --script foo.lisp if __name__=='__main__': ;; If run from command line, the following if-test will succeed

(if (> (length sb-ext:*posix-argv*) 1)

    ;; Code that is executed from the command line only goes here

) sbcl --script #! set-dispatch-macro-character #! set-dispatch-macro-character :noscript *features* :noscript *features* #! #! slime sbcl --script :noscript *features* #-/#+ #IFDEF/#IFNDEF *features* #-:noscript :noscript #+:noscript :noscript progn #-:noscript (progn <your code here>) set-dispatch-macro-character sbcl ~/.sbclrc :SWANK *features* #-:swank #+:swank #-:noscript #+:noscript sbcl :SWANK *features*

@TITLE:Android: Real Time Image Processing
@CONTENT:I have an application which takes a camera preview, performs some basic image processing function on every frame (e.g. edge detection, colour change, image warp etc.) and displays the modified frame to the screen in "real time". Similar to the "Paper Camera" app in Android Market. A summary of my approach: 1: Create two overlapping Views in a framelayout: A SurfaceView to pass to Camera.setPreviewDisplay(). (Passing null would prevent the camera preview starting on some devices - opencv used to do this before Android 4.0?). A class called "LiveView" which extends View and implements Camera.PreviewCallBack. This view receives frames from the camera, and displays the frame after modification (e.g. edge detection). This View is on top of the SurfaceView. 2: I call Camera.setPreviewCallbackWithBuffer(), so that frames are sent to my LiveView 3: In the onPreviewFrame() of the LiveView, I take the captured frame (byte[]), convert from YUV to RGB and perform image processing functions, and call postInvalidate() (The YUV2RGB conversion and image processing are done in native code) 4: In the OnDraw() method of LiveView, I create a bitmap from the modified RGB frame (byte[]), and draw the bitmap to canvas. This works (between 5fps and 10fps on various devices), but I would like to hear how others have approached this problem, and how it could be improved. In particular: Would I gain any performance by extending GLSurfaceView rather than View to create the LiveView Class? It sounds very inefficient to have two surfaces being updated for every frame. Is there an alternative? To do this more efficiently, should I be accessing the camera at native level? - I believe OpenCV takes this approach? Many Thanks

@TITLE:webkit_server hangs periodically when run from Capybara in Ruby
@CONTENT:I am having a problem where an instance of webkit_server with Capybara and capybara-webkit running headless connected to a local Xvfb screen hangs when visiting a URL. It seems to happen after several minutes of repeatedly visiting different URLs and executing finders. (I'm using capybara for a screen scraping application in vanilla Ruby, not for testing.) I've confirmed that when it hangs the site is still accessible (for example, through curl or wget on the command line). I've also tried wrapping the Ruby code that invokes the visit and subsequent finders in a Timeout block so that after 60 seconds of waiting a new URL is visited, but any visit() attempt fails after the first time this occurs. The only way to fix the problem is to kill both the Ruby process invoking Capybara/capybara-webkit and the webkit_server process and restart. When I strace the webkit_server process, I see output like this repeatedly: clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, {5821, 680279627}) = 0
gettimeofday({1330890176, 712033}, {0, 33052112}) = 0

read(7, 0x1fac1b4, 4096)                = -1 EAGAIN (Resource temporarily unavailable)
 And if I strace the Ruby process that invokes it, it is hung on a read(): Process 3331 attached - interrupt to quit
read(5, 
^C <unfinished ...>
Process 3331 detached
 I know that the Ruby code hangs on the Capybara visit() method. Any ideas on what I can do to troubleshoot or correct this is appreciated. I'm assuming the problem has something to do with some resource webkit_server needs to visit the URL but am not sure what to try next. Thanks!

@CONTENT:I am working with an Oracle database and I need to be able to partition the data in a table. I understand that Rracle has an ora_hash function that can partition the data into buckets. Is the ora_hash function deterministic? In my program I will be making several different database queries with each query asking for a different bucket number. For example, in one query I might ask for the first two buckets: SELECT * FROM sales WHERE ORA_HASH(cust_id, 9) in (0,1);
 In a subsequent query I might ask for the 2nd and 3rd bucket: SELECT * FROM sales WHERE ORA_HASH(cust_id, 9) in (1,2);
 In the above example, will ora_hash always divide the table into the exact same 10 buckets? Assume that the data in the tables hasn't changed. Will the second bucket (bucket 1), be identical in both queries? There is documentation that suggests that seed value enables oracle to return different results for the same data set. So I am assuming that if I don't use seed value, then ora_hash will be deterministic. See the documentation.

@TITLE:TCP Socket communication between processes on Heroku worker dyno
@CONTENT:I'd like to know how to communicate between processes on a Heroku worker dyno. We want a Resque worker to read off a queue and send the data to another process running on the same dyno. The "other process" is an off-the-shelf piece of software that usually uses TCP sockets (port xyz) to listen for commands. It is set up to run as a background process before the Resque worker starts. However, when we try to connect locally to that TCP socket, we get nowhere. Our Rake task for setting up the queue does this: task "resque:setup" do
  # First launch our listener process in the background
  `./some_process_that_listens_on_port_12345 &`

  # Now get our queue worker ready, set up Redis backing store
  port = 12345
  ENV['QUEUE'] = '*'  
  ENV['PORT'] = port.to_s
  Resque.redis = ENV['REDISTOGO_URL']

  # Start working from the queue
  WorkerClass.enqueue
end
 And that works -- our listener process runs, and Resque tries to process queued tasks. However, the Resque jobs fail because they can't connect to localhost:12345 (specifically, Errno::ECONNREFUSED). Possibly, Heroku is blocking TCP socket communication on the same dyno. Is there a way around this? I tried to take the "code" out of the situation and just executed on the command line (after the server process claims that it is properly bound to 12345): nc localhost 12345 -w 1 </dev/null
 But this does not connect either. We are currently investigating changing the client/server code to use UNIXSocket on both sides as opposed to TCPSocket, but as it's an off-the-shelf piece of software, we'd rather avoid our own fork if possible.

@TITLE:What are alternatives to NSURLConnection for chunked transfer encoding
@CONTENT:I've checked for other questions relevant to this, but the only answer is "Use ASIHTTPRequest" as this is no longer being developed I wanted to ask what alternatives people are using, whilst working on our SDK I came across a lot of strange behaviour in NSURLConnection when receiving data from the server. We tracked it down to the fact that NSURLConnection doesn't deal well with responses in chunked-encoding. Or at least so we read in this question here NSURLConnection and "chunked" transfer-coding Some developers we were talking to say it gets better in iOS 5, we need to make sure that our SDK is backwards compatible with iOS 4.3 at least. I want to confirm this is infact an issue in NSURLConnection, and how people are dealing with it. All the alternatives I've found so far are based off of NSURLConnection and I'm assuming as such will have the same flaw. ASIHTTPRequest did in fact work because it's based a little lower than NSURLConnection, but were looking for alternatives in the knowledge it's no longer supported. A list of other libraries looked at are: Restkit, ShareKit, LRResty, AFNetworking, TTURLRequest I'm aware there are similar questions here Is RESTKit a good replacement for ASIHTTPRequest? and here ASIHTTPRequest alternative But both of the solutions are based off NSURLConnection. EDIT: I noticed I pointed to the wrong question at the start of my post, so thats updated. It points to a thread from 2008, and i've seen similar ones but none that are recent.

@TITLE:Update SimpleCursorAdapter while maintaining scroll position in ListView
@CONTENT:My problem: My ListView resets its scroll position to the top whenever I update its contents through its (customized) SimpleCursorAdapter. I would like the ListView to maintain its scroll position when updated. I started out by creating a new adapter instance every time and using ListView.setAdapter(), but according to this discussion I should be updating the adapter instead of resetting it. I can't find a way to do this for SimpleCursorAdapter that works correctly. Here are some things I've tried, omitting the method arguments: - SimpleCursorAdapter.changeCursorAndColumns() with a fresh cursor successfully updates the adapter but still resets the scroll position. - SimpleCursorAdapter.changeCursor() acts the same way. - SimpleCursorAdapter.swapCursor() isn't available until api 11, and I am developing for api 8. - SimpleCursorAdapter.notifyDataSetChanged() does not update the ListView. (Maybe there is another step I'm missing.) - ListView.invalidate() does not update the ListView. - SimpleCursorAdapter.requery() makes the ListView blank, and is deprecated. - I'm familiar with the ListView.setSelection() solution, but I don't want my ListView to move at all when it is updated. This snaps it to a position in the list. This seems like it should be a common and simple problem. Has anybody dealt with it?

@LINK:/questions/9246528/opencv-android-background-subtraction
@TITLE:OpenCV Android Background Subtraction
@CONTENT:I am working on a robotics project using an Android phone as the main processor and the camera to detect movement. I got the Android binary package from OpenCV and got it correctly installed. I can capture images using the OpenCV native camera and display them to the screen. I'm having problems using the background subtraction class, though. I can make a new BackgroundSubtractorMOG object in the constructor, but when I attempt to run the code below, it force quits I get the error "Only 1- and 3-channel 8-bit images are supported in BackgroundSubtractorMOG" from the native code. I tried changing Highgui.CV_CAP_ANDROID_COLOR_FRAME_RGBA to Highgui.CV_CAP_ANDROID_COLOR_FRAME_RGB, and then it doesn't force quit, but all I get is a black screen. I'm pretty sure bmp is still null with FRAME_RGB, because the screen stays black, and the fps counter I was drawing right after the bitmap (removed from the code posted below for clarity and as a troubleshooting step) doesn't show up. I took a look at the OpenCV C++ code for this function (line 388 here), and the image type error occurs if the image type isn't CV_8UC1 or CV_8UC3, so I tried using the java CvType.CV_8UC3 instead of Highgui.CV_CAP_ANDROID_COLOR_FRAME_RGBA in capture.retrieve(), but it force closed and I got a "Output frame format is not supported" error. I'm guessing I've just got a type conversion problem, but I can't figure out for the life of me where OpenCV's Android-specific image types fit with their regular image types that are documented. Any help would be appreciated. The variables: private SurfaceHolder mHolder;
private VideoCapture mCamera;
private Mat mRgba;
private Mat mFGMask;
private BackgroundSubtractorMOG mBGSub;
 My SurfaceView's run() function: public void run() {

            break;
        }

@TITLE:How to correctly deal with escaped Unicode Characters in R e.g. the em dash (¡X)
@CONTENT:I'm having trouble handling escaped unicode characters in R, specifically those encountered when grabbing information from the MediaWiki API. I would find a JSON string like {"query":{"categorymembers":[{"ns":0,"title":"Banach\u2013Tarski paradox"}]}}
 Which should be perfectly valid but when read in through fromJSON() I get: snip...
[1] "Banach\023Tarski paradox"
 Initially I thought this was just a problem with RJSONIO, but I encounter similar problems with scan() and readLines(). My guess is that I am missing something very basic. I can't actually give a completely reproducible example using only R because if I send "em\u2013dash" to a file through write() (or some equivalent function) R will automatically convert the em dash. So here goes. Create a text file named test1 with the following: "em\u2013dash" "em¡Vdash" " em \u2013 dash"
 Then load up R (for whatever the file path is): > scan( file = "~/R/test1", what = "character", encoding = "UTF-8")
Read 3 items
[1] "em\\u2013dash"    "em¡Vdash"          " em \\u2013 dash"
> readLines("~/R/test1", warn = FALSE, encoding = "UTF-8")
[1] "\"em\\u2013dash\" \"em¡Vdash\" \" em \\u2013 dash\""
 The added escape character is what causes my problems with fromJSON(). I could just strip them out but I'd probably break something else in the process and I imagine there is an easier solution. Thanks. Here's the session info: R version 2.14.1 (2011-12-22)

When value "1" has been selected in element 1 for example, I want to disable it in element 2. However. after I deselect value "1" in element 1, it's still disabled in element 2. That's not what I want. The other value should be available again after deselecting the value in the 1st element. Does anybody know how to accomplish this?

@TITLE:Guice injecting only some of the constructor
@CONTENT:Suppose I have some Message class like the following. (This is a made-up class for simplicity.) public class Message {
  private String text;

  public Message(String text) {
    this.text = text;

  public void send(Person recipient) {
    // I think I should be Guice-injecting the sender.
    MessageSender sender = new EmailBasedMessageSender();

  }
}
 Since I have different MessageSender implementations, and might want to unit test this sending ability, I think I should be injecting the MessageSender in Message's send() method. But how do I do this? All the Guice examples I've seen and that I understand seem to do the injection in the constructor: public class Message {
  private String text;
  private MessageSender sender;

  // ??? I don't know what to do here, since the `text` argument shouldn't be injected.

  public Message(String text, MessageSender sender) {

  }
}

public class MessageSenderModule extends AbstractModule {
  @Override 
  protected void configure() {
    bind(MessageSender.class).to(EmailBasedMessageSender.class);
  }
}
 But my Message class takes in a text argument in its constructor, which I don't want to inject. So what am I supposed to do instead? (Note: I'm a complete Google Guice noob. I think I understand dependency injection, but I don't understand how to actually implement it with Guice.)

@TITLE:How to set the timeout properly when federating with the ADFS 2.0
@CONTENT:I am using ADFS 2.0 for quite some time and I understand how things work. I've done dozen of custom RPs, custom STSes as well as using the ADFS as the relying STS. However, I have a simple requirement which I still fail to fulfill. I want my users to be forced to relogin after some fixed time. Let's say 1 minute, for test purposes. First, I've made some corrections at the RPs side. It seems that for unknown reason, the RP retains the session even if the token's validTo points back in time. This contradicts what Vittorio Bertocci says in his book (page 123) where he shows how to perform sliding expiration - he says that "The SessionAuthenticationModule will take care of handling the expired session right after". Well, for me it doesn't, however I have found a trick here http://blogs.planbsoftware.co.nz/?p=521 - take a look at the "if" clause:         sam.SessionSecurityTokenReceived +=
            ( s, e ) =>
            {
                SessionAuthenticationModule _sam = s as SessionAuthenticationModule;

                DateTime now = DateTime.UtcNow;

                DateTime validFrom = e.SessionToken.ValidFrom;
                DateTime validTo   = e.SessionToken.ValidTo;

                try
                {
                    double halfSpan = ( validTo - validFrom ).TotalSeconds / 2;
                    if ( validTo < now )
                    {
                        _sam.DeleteSessionTokenCookie();
                        e.Cancel = true;
                    }
                }
                catch ( Exception ex )
                {
                    int v = 0;
                }
            };
 This trick fixes the issue at the RPs side. When the token is invalid the application clears it out and redirects to the login page. Now comes the problem. My login page uses the FederatedPassiveSignIn control. When clicked, it redirects the browser to the ADFS. But ADFS happily creates a new session without any prompt for the user. I have set the token's lifetime for this RP to 1: Set-ADFSRelyingPartyTrust -Targetname "myrpname" -TokenLifetime 1
 and using Get-ADFSRelyingPartyTrust I can see that it's set to 1 (I even print the token validTo on my page to confirm that this is set correctly). Then I set ADFS properties with ADFS-SetProperties: ADFS-SetProperties -SsoLifetime 1
ADFS-SetProperties -ReplyCacheExpirationInterval 1
ADFS-SetProperties -SamlMessageDeliveryWindow 1
 but still no luck. I am stuck now. The scenario works correctly with my custom STS where the validity of the STS session is based on a Forms cookie - if I set the STS's forms cookie timeout to 1, after 1 minute of inactivity within my RP application I am redirected to the login page of my RP which then redirects to the STS which presents its login page. However, this is not the case with ADFS 2.0. After a minute of inactivity, I am redirected to the login page of my RP which redirects to ADFS's login page which in turn redirects back happily just like the session would be still active within ADFS. I would like someone to: (1) take a look at the hack described at the top and explain why an expired token is not automatically rejected and such ugly hack is needed (2) explain how to properly timeout the session at the ADFS 2.0 side so a request to renew the token is guarded with a login page. Thanks in advance. edit I can confirm that setting all above parameters to 1 minute makes the ADFS session invalid after 5 minutes (or more). That's strage and it seems that either I am making a basic mistake or 5 minutes is the minumum acceptable value. My (2) from above is now then just to confirm and explain my observation.

@TITLE:Advice on Unit testing a Windows Forms application
@CONTENT:I have written a Windows Forms application and now I want to write some unit tests for it (not exactly test driven development seeing as I am writing the tests after I have developed but better late then never!) My question is that with such an application how do you go about writing the unit tests, given that nearly all of the methods and events are private? I have heard of NUnit Forms but I hear good and bad things about it, also there has been no real development on that project for a while so it looks abandoned. Also is it generally accepted that the project have have adequate unit testing in place if I wrote unit test cases for all of the events that a user would trigger by clicking/ pressing buttons, or would I have to go and write unit test cases for all methods and figure out a way to test my private methods? EDIT: My business logic is seperated from my presentation logic, there is 1 or 2 public methods my business logic exposes so the form can access them, but what about all the private methods that are in the business logic?

@TITLE:Capturing image from gallery & camera in android
@CONTENT:First thing I know this is repeated question but I don't have problem in capturing image from gallery or camera. I created on dummy project to check my code here it's working fine But when I used same code in my project & here it's not working even I didn't get any error as soon as I start activity for result it get cancelled but still I can see images from gallery & I can capture image from camera. When I checked logcat I found following warning don't know why it's coming & how I can fix this thing  W/NetworkConnectivityListener(2399): onReceived() called with CONNECTED and Intent { act=android.net.conn.CONNECTIVITY_CHANGE flg=0x10000000 (has extras) }

@TITLE:Unwanted RST TCP packet with Scapy
@CONTENT:In order to understand how TCP works, I tried to forge my own TCP SYN/SYN-ACK/ACK (based on the tutorial: http://www.thice.nl/creating-ack-get-packets-with-scapy/ ). The problem is that whenever my computer recieve the SYN-ACK from the server, it generates a RST packet that stops the connection process. I tried on a OS X Lion and on a Linux 10.10, both reset the connection. I found this: http://lkml.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/net/0404.2/0021.html, I don't know if it is the reason. Does anyone could tell me what could be the reason? And how to avoid this problem? Thank you.

 Thanks ?mit for your explanation. I tried the close-reopen version. I have replaced my refresh method with the methods below. Adding is working but removing not. Very strange the whole topic. I'm very suprised that these basic functions are not really supported by GWT. Can somebody give me more help to run a real working example.     public void refresh() {

         closeReopenTreeNodes(cellTree.getRootTreeNode());
    }

    private void closeReopenTreeNodes(TreeNode node) {
        if(node == null) {
            return;
        }
        for(int i = 0; i < node.getChildCount(); i++) {

             if(node.getChildValue(i).equals(this)){

                 if(node.getParent() != null){

                     node.getParent().setChildOpen(i, false);
                     //node.getParent().setChildOpen(i, true);
                 }

                 node.setChildOpen(i, false);
                 node.setChildOpen(i, true);
             }               
             TreeNode child = node.setChildOpen(i, node.isChildOpen(i));
             closeReopenTreeNodes(child);
        }
    }
 Here my third try: This way is recommended by gwt-commiter. Please see following issue: http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/issues/detail?id=7160 Current status: * Adding is possible * Removing is possible if not last child! So, last open point, refresh the tree if last open child! package com.test;

@TITLE:jQuery scrollTop inconsistent across browsers
@CONTENT:In Chrome and Safari, $("body").scrollTop(1000) goes where expected. In IE and FF, nothing happens. In IE and FF, $(window).scrollTop(1000) works, but they go to different places. It also works in Chrome and Safari, but they both go to a different place as well. They seems to be up to 300-500 pixels off. Is there any consistent way to set the scrollTop property that works cross browser, and if not, why doesn't jQuery abstract this? I'd like to animate it as well, which works fine in Chrome and Safari, but not in the other browsers. Is my only option to do browser detection? (bad practice) Or is there some better way?

@TITLE:How to programmatically install a CA Certificate (for EAP WiFi configuration) in Android?
@CONTENT:My objective: Create an EAP WiFi configuration - including the CA Certificate - in Android programmitcally. Problem: How do I install a CA Certificate programmatically (and then reference that certificate in the EAP WiFi configuration)? I found a very useful link already that allows me to create and save EAP WiFi configurations here: How to programatically create and read WEP/EAP WiFi configurations in Android? However this assumes that you have already installed the CA Certificate on the device. I would like to install the certificate within my app - either from the resources in the app, or sent from a server. Is this even possible? (Rooting is not an option in this case.) If so, how? Additional info... I also found a way to add a certificate to a KeyStore: http://stackoverflow.com/a/4490543/1172101 However this is used specifically for creating a secure socket and connecting via HTTPS. I want to use the certificate for WiFi. Unfortunately, I have yet to find a way to install a CA Certificate programmatically - from within the app. However, it is possible to install a certificate via the Web browser in Android. Thus, the solution (for now) is to: Launch an intent to open a URL in the Web browser that goes directly to the CA certificate. This works but there are some challenges: The user must name the certificate. This is a challenge because we are adding the WiFi configuration programmitically. Thus we have to ask the user to give the certificate the same name. The user must enter a password. If they don't have a password set up, the user will create one and enter it twice. If they have set a security password, the user will have to remember that same password and enter it. Assuming the user successfully completes these steps, he is left hanging in the browser. This leads to a few questions: From my app, is there a way to force a name for the certificate that the user installs via the browser? From my app, is there any way to know when the certificate installation has completed and then give focus back to my app? Just let me know if you need any clarification.

@TITLE:Index pdf documents in Solr from C# client
@CONTENT:Basically I'm trying to index word or pdf documents in Solr and found the ExtractingRequestHandler, but can't figure out how to write code in c# that performs the HTTP POST request like in the Solr wiki: http://wiki.apache.org/solr/ExtractingRequestHandler. I've installed Solr 3.4 on Tomcat 7 (7.0.22) using the files from the example/solr directory in the Solr zip and I haven't altered anything. The ExtractingRequestHandler should be configured out of the box in the solrconfig.xml and ready to use, right? Can some of you give an C# (HttpWebRequest) example of how you make the HTTP POST request and upload a PDF file like it is done using curl in the Solr wiki? I've look all over this site and many others trying to find an example or a tutorial on how this is done, but haven't found anything. EDIT: I finally managed to get it to work using SolrNet! In order for it to work you need to copy this to a lib-folder in your Solr installation directory from the Solr zip: apache-solr-cell-3.4.0.jar file from the dist folder content of contrib\extraction\lib directory With SolrNet 0.4.0 beta 2, this code does the job: Startup.Init<IndexDocument>("YOUR-SOLR-SERVICE-PATH");
var solr = ServiceLocator.Current.GetInstance<ISolrOperations<IndexDocument>>();

using (FileStream fileStream = File.OpenRead("FILE-PATH-FOR-THE-FILE-TO-BE-INDEXED"))
{
    var response =
        solr.Extract(

                ExtractFormat = ExtractFormat.Text,
                ExtractOnly = false

}

solr.Commit();
 Sorry for the trouble. I hope however that others will find this useful.

 Does Django pass the request to the form? Is it good practice? How can I use the request? (of course the name request is not defined) Edit: I tried another solution which is to call the form in the view passing it the request: form = BookSubmitForm(request)
 and then in the form I use this: class BookSubmitForm(ModelForm):

        super(BookSubmitForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.fields["library"].queryset = Library.objects.filter(owner=request.user)
 It works and the code is in the form. Now I'm not sure it's the best solution, could it be improved?

    book = forms.ModelChoiceField(queryset=Book.objects.filter(owner=request.user),)

 This works great in firefox but, in chrome even if the typeof equals function it still goes into and creates the empty function. I can't find a work around for chrome, i've tried if(!myfunction), if(typeof window.myfunction != 'function) but nothing seems to work here for chrome when everything seems to work in firefox. Any ideas?

@TITLE:my matplotlib title gets cropped
@CONTENT:SOLVED - see comment below on combining wraptext.wrap and plt.tightlayout. PROBLEM: Here's the code: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.bar([1,2],[5,4])
plt.title('this is a very long title and therefore it gets cropped which is an unthinkable behaviour as it loses the information in the title')
plt.show()
 This creates a figure looking like The title is cropped, how can I get it to display the entire title? UPDATE: I'm looking for a solution that causes the figure size to match the text in the title and axes labels, not for a solution that cuts the title with newlines, as that kind of solution doesn't always help: from textwrap import wrap
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
title = 'this is a very long title and therefore it gets cropped which is an unthinkable behaviour as it loses the information in the title'*5
plt.bar([1,2],[5,4])
plt.title('\n'.join(wrap(title,60)))
plt.show()` 
 See the result:
@CODE:wraptext.wrap plt.tightlayout import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.bar([1,2],[5,4])
plt.title('this is a very long title and therefore it gets cropped which is an unthinkable behaviour as it loses the information in the title')

@CONTENT:How to implement a timeout in Javascript, not the window.timeout but something like session timeout or socket timeout - basically - a "function timeout" A specified period of time that will be allowed to elapse in a system before a specified event is to take place, unless another specified event occurs first; in either case, the period is terminated when either event takes place. Specifically, I want a javascript observing timer that will observe the execution time of a function and if reached or going more than a specified time then the observing timer will stop/notify the executing function.

@TITLE:Protocols and Delegates for Dummies
@CONTENT:I've tried to figure this out I promise! There is a wealth of info out there on this and I'm still awash in a sea of abstract concepts! It's like when I was a kid and nobody could explain to me why a country couldn't just print more money and be really rich. I'm not this retarded with most of this stuff, but for some reason I can't wrap my head around this concept, so would really appreciate if someone could spell it out as patronizingly "talking to a 4 year old" slowly as possible! I think target-action makes complete sense to me. It is a useful way of allowing a view to talk to a controller, without having to do a whole lot. As far as I can make out, a controller object effectively attaches a listener to the view object so that if a particular event occurs on that view (ie button pushed) it fires the controller method. This may not be not technically accurate, but as an abstract explanation it makes sense to me. So the sequence is: A target method is created in the controller object. A view is selected and graphically connected to that method. An event happens on that view which fires the method from the controller. Protocols and delegates have me flummoxed. I know it's something to do with allowing objects to talk to each other, but I tried writing out my (lack of) understanding so far below and just deleted it as I think it's best not to unpick the knots in my current thinking but to just wipe the slate and start afresh. If anybody could kindly spend a little time explaining the purpose of Using delegates/protocols as opposed to target/action The constituents of the code, and where it lives The sequence of events which occur when the process is being used I would be eternally grateful. Judging by some of the comments on other explanations, I feel I'm not the only one a little bit lost so hopefully this will be of general use. Thanks so much! Edit: Okay as I thought maybe if I just lay out my understanding people can correct me, and it might make this easier. My sample is taken from the Apple Docs, with a Window as the view object and WindowDelegate as the delegate, where a click on the close window button triggers a "should I close?" message to the delegate. Constituents of the Code: Window (View) WindowDelegate (View Controller?) Declare the protocol which a delegate can use in the interface section of the Window (View). Make an instance of the delegate in the Window. State that the WindowDelegate implements the Window Protocol, by including : in it's interface. (bit wobbly here?) Write the necessary implementation of the methods in the WindowDelegate (View Controller) implementation section. On a certain event the Window will send a message to the WindowDelegate with certain information. The WindowDelegate will process this and return an answer. Anywhere along right lines?

@TITLE:With ThreadPoolExecutor, how to get the name of the thread running in the thread pool?
@CONTENT:I'm using a ThreadPoolExecutor in Java to manage a lot of running threads. I've created my own simple ThreadFactory so I can give the threads better names. The issue is that the name gets set in the Thread when the thread pool is first created and is not tied to the task that the thread pool is actually running. I understand this... my Runnables and Callables--though they have names--are actually one level of abstraction down from the ThreadPoolExecutor's running threads. There have been some other questions on StackOverflow about creating names for ThreadPoolExecutor thread pools. (See How to give name to a callable Thread? and How to name the threads of a thread pool in Java.) What I want to know is: does anyone have a good solution for keeping the name of the thread pool thread in sync with the Runnable that it is actually running? i.e. If I call Thread.getCurrentThread().getName() I'd like it not to return the name of the top-level thread pool, but rather the name of the Callable/Runnable that the thread is currently running. Since this is mainly for debugging and logging purposes, I'm trying to avoid a solution that involves me putting new code into every Runnable that might be submitted to the ThreadPoolExecutor--I'd rather just put some code into the ThreadFactory or wrap the ThreadPoolExecutor itself so that the change is done in one place. If such a solution doesn't exist I probably won't bother since it's not mission critical. begin edit To clarify, I know I can put a Thread.currentThread().setName( "my runnable name" ); as the first line of every Runnable's run method, but I'm trying to avoid doing that. I'm being a perfectionist here, and I realize it, so I won't be offended if people want to comment on this question and tell me so. end edit My other question, I suppose, is whether people think it's a bad idea to do such a thing. Should I be wary of updating the thread pool name like this? Thanks for any suggestions!

@LINK:/questions/8481397/what-happens-when-a-type-containing-a-lambda-gets-assigned
@TITLE:What happens when a type containing a lambda gets assigned?
@CONTENT:Say I have some sort of type wrapping up a function, maybe a lambda function: template<typename Function>
  struct my_struct
{
  Function f;

  my_struct(const Function &f) : f(f) {}
};
 What happens when an instance of this type is assigned? My understanding is that lambdas are immutable, and have deleted assignment operators. Yet, when I assign to an object this type in the code snippet below, no error is emitted: // a structure which contains a function;
// possibly a lambda function
template<typename Function>
  struct my_struct
{
  Function f;

  my_struct(const Function &f) : f(f) {}

  // XXX adding this assignment operator causes an error
  //my_struct &operator=(const my_struct &other)
  //{
  //  f = other.f;
  //  return *this;
  //}
};

template<typename Function>
my_struct<Function> make_struct(const Function &f)
{
  return my_struct<Function>(f);
}

int main()
{
  // create some lambda
  auto lambda = [](int x){return x;};

  // make a struct containing a copy of the lambda
  auto x = make_struct(lambda);

  // try to assign to the struct, which
  // presumably assigns to the enclosed lambda
  x = make_struct(lambda);

  return 0;
}
 Adding the commented-out assignment operator yields an error, as expected: $ g++-4.6 -std=c++0x test.cpp
test.cpp: In member function ¡¥my_struct<Function>& my_struct<Function>::operator=(const my_struct<Function>&) [with Function = main()::<lambda(int)>, my_struct<Function> = my_struct<main()::<lambda(int)> >]¡¦:

test.cpp:13:5: error: use of deleted function ¡¥main()::<lambda(int)>& main()::<lambda(int)>::operator=(const main()::<lambda(int)>&)¡¦
test.cpp:27:18: error: a lambda closure type has a deleted copy assignment operator
 So, is it possible to create assignable types with lambda member variables? This seems like a reasonable thing to want to try. Consider combining a lambda with boost::transform_iterator, for example.
@CODE:template<typename Function>
  struct my_struct
{
  Function f;

  my_struct(const Function &f) : f(f) {}
}; // a structure which contains a function;
// possibly a lambda function
template<typename Function>
  struct my_struct
{
  Function f;

  my_struct(const Function &f) : f(f) {}

  // XXX adding this assignment operator causes an error
  //my_struct &operator=(const my_struct &other)
  //{
  //  f = other.f;
  //  return *this;
  //}
};

template<typename Function>
my_struct<Function> make_struct(const Function &f)
{
  return my_struct<Function>(f);
}

int main()
{
  // create some lambda
  auto lambda = [](int x){return x;};

  // make a struct containing a copy of the lambda
  auto x = make_struct(lambda);

  // try to assign to the struct, which
  // presumably assigns to the enclosed lambda
  x = make_struct(lambda);

  return 0;

@CONTENT:I am writing an app to mine information from LinkedIn. I've only found one code sample thus far on oAuth. I'm having trouble understanding the workflow of oAuth, for example: The Example asks for the Username/Password combination to log into LinkedIn and return a token, but in my case, I will always use the same LinkedIn Account. Since I'm always going to be using the same user to access the LinkedIn API, is there a way to do it so I don't have to re-enter the user name and password for every access request? The facebook API allows me to set the Token to not expire, thereby allowing me to save this token as an Attribute inside my application). The idea is : Get a token for a certain LinkedIn Account Store it in my app hardcoded, since this is the only account I will be using the retrieve information from LinkedIn. Make API Calls using this token, everytime I need it Parse the JSON/XML file How do I do this in C#?

@CONTENT:I'm currently using Monodroid to develop an android app. I'm rather new to phone apps so am confused over a couple things: What by definition is an android library? I use the Mono template to create android library: Create a Mono for Android Class Library => write the code and build into .dll => run with emulator from Visual Studio and it works fine in the emulator. But is the .dll file a android library? Or it is converted by Mono before working on the emulator and the 'REAL' android library should be JAR? Can I directly use my defined .dll written in C# to make this app? I tried it in Mono by directly referencing it in my android app and it is building, no errors. But when the emulator run this app, it get stucked (still no error) - what is the right way to use c# .dll in Android app project? I realize there are quite a couple topics discussing the link between c# and android and about mono but after reading I still cannot get around with this library referencing problem so if anyone could offer any hint/thoughts would be most appreciated

 This will produce: But how to arrange the DIVs both horizontally and vertically? In this case, how to shift the Red and Purple DIVs upper where there is empty space (under Yellow and Blue DIVs)?

@LINK:/questions/8190480/how-to-pass-multiple-expressions-to-orderby-for-ef
@TITLE:How to pass multiple Expressions to OrderBy for EF?
@CONTENT:I am using EF 4.2, but I expect this would apply to EF 4 and 4.1 as well. I would like to pass an IQueryable<T> and multiple Expression<Func<TSource, TKey>> to a method and have the method apply OrderBy and ThenBy to the IQueryable<T> as appropriate. I found this answer, and wrote the method below based on that: public IQueryable<User> ApplyOrderBy(IQueryable<User> query, IEnumerable<Expression<Func<User, IComparable>>> orderBy)
{
    if (orderBy == null) 
    {
        return query;
    }

    IOrderedQueryable<User> output = null;

    foreach(var expression in orderBy)
    {
        if (output == null)
        {
            output = query.OrderBy(expression);
        }
        else
        {
            output = output.ThenBy(expression);
        }
    }

    return output ?? query;
}
 This works fine as long as the properties I order by are strings, but when I try to order by an int property, I get an exception: Unable to cast the type 'System.Int32' to type 'System.IComparable'. LINQ to Entities only supports casting Entity Data Model primitive types. Any suggestions to work around this, or for a different approach altogether? I considered passing in an IEnumerable<Expression>, but then would need to figure out how to cast back to the specific type (e.g. Expression<Func<User, int>) to call OrderBy.
@CODE:IQueryable<T> Expression<Func<TSource, TKey>> OrderBy ThenBy IQueryable<T> public IQueryable<User> ApplyOrderBy(IQueryable<User> query, IEnumerable<Expression<Func<User, IComparable>>> orderBy)
{
    if (orderBy == null) 
    {
        return query;
    }

    IOrderedQueryable<User> output = null;

@LINK:/questions/8045838/importing-a-very-large-record-set-into-mongodb-using-nodejs
@TITLE:Importing a very large record set into MongoDB using nodejs
@CONTENT:Before I dive into my question, I wanted to point out that I am doing this partially to get familiarized with node and mongo. I realize there are probably better ways to accomplish my final goal, but what I want to get out of this is a general methodology that might apply to other situations. The goal: I have a csv file containing 6+ million geo-ip records. Each record contains 4 fields in total and the file is roughly 180mb. I want to process this file and insert each record into a MongoDB collection called "Blocks". Each "Block" will have the 4 fields from the csv file. My current approach I am using mongoose to create a "Block" model and a ReadStream to process the file line by line. The code I'm using to process the file and extract the records works and I can make it print each record to the console if I want to. For each record in the file, it calls a function that creates a new Blocks object (using mongoose), populates the fields and saves it. This is the code inside of the function that gets called every time a line is read and parsed. The "rec" variable contains an object representing a single record from the file. block = new Block();

block.ipFrom    = rec.startipnum;
block.ipTo      = rec.endipnum;
block.location  = rec.locid;

connections++;

block.save(function(err){

    if(err) throw err;
    //console.log('.');
    records_inserted++;

    if( --connections == 0 ){
        mongoose.disconnect();
        console.log( records_inserted + ' records inserted' );
    }

});
 The problem Since the file is being read asynchronously, more than one line is processed at the same time and reading the file is much faster than MongoDB can write so the whole process stalls at around 282000 records and gets as high up as 5k+ concurrent Mongo connections. It doesn't crash.. it just sits there doing nothing and doesn't seem to recover, nor does the item count in the mongo collection go up any further. What I'm after here is a general approach to solving this problem. How would I cap the number of concurrent Mongo connections? I would like to take advantage of being able to insert multiple records at the same time, but I'm missing a way to regulate the flow. Thank you in advance.
@CODE:block = new Block();

block.ipFrom    = rec.startipnum;
block.ipTo      = rec.endipnum;
block.location  = rec.locid;

connections++;

block.save(function(err){

    if(err) throw err;
    //console.log('.');
    records_inserted++;

    if( --connections == 0 ){
        mongoose.disconnect();
        console.log( records_inserted + ' records inserted' );
    }

 For some reason, the array does not contain any value for unchecked checkboxes. I have seen some solutions where a hidden variable is passed with each checkbox, but can this solution be implemented in my situation (using arrays)?
@CODE:<form name='foo' method='post' action=''>
    <table>
       <tr>
          <td class='bla'>Checkbox: <input type='checkbox' name='cBox[]'/></td>
      </tr>
       <tr>
          <td class='bla'>Checkbox: <input type='checkbox' name='cBox[]'/></td>
      </tr>
       <tr>
          <td class='bla'>Checkbox: <input type='checkbox' name='cBox[]'/></td>
      </tr>
   </table>
</form> Array ( [0] => on [1] => on)

@TITLE:How to avoid 15 second delay/caching in Android Media Player when playing stream
@CONTENT:I am implementing a media player that plays a stream from a remote machine. Via my app I can control the remote machine (e.g. seek to second). Works like charm, but: The Android Media Player buffers some insane 10-15 seconds(!!), which means each click ('seek') takes 10-15 seconds to take effect even though it is less than a second until the new data arrives. My Question: Is there any way to control (limit) that caching? Or am I simply doing something wrong? Am I the only one having this issue? My code is very simple: player = new MediaPlayer()
player.setDataSource(url);
player.setOnPreparedListener(new OnPreparedListener() {

    public void onPrepared(MediaPlayer mp) {
        mp.start();
    }
});
player.prepareAsync();
 UPDATE: I am using a local self built mini HTTP server to connect my byte stream to Androids media player. It seems like Android DRM is delaying / caching in this case. Still not quite clear why (and why not if I connect to my IIS that hosts a file). Also no idea how to workaround this. Input welcome! Thanks! Daniel

@TITLE:How does std::string allocate memory in GCC with -fwhole-program?
@CONTENT:Update: The following problem appears to depend on the -fwhole-program option. I've been playing around a bit with memory allocation, and I encountered a small mystery: In GCC (4.6), how does std::string allocate its memory [edit]when I compile with -fwhole-program[/]? Have this following test program: #include <new>
#include <string>
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>

void * operator new(std::size_t n) throw(std::bad_alloc)
{
  void * const p = std::malloc(n);

  if (p == NULL) throw std::bad_alloc();

  std::cerr << "new() requests " << n << " bytes, allocated at " << p << ".\n";

  return p;
}

void operator delete(void * p) noexcept
{
  std::cerr << "delete() at " << p << ".\n";
  std::free(p);
}

int main()
{
  std::string s = "Hello world.";
}
 When I use any other dynamic container (which uses std::allocator<T>), the allocator uses ::operator new, and so I see the debug messages happily. However, with std::string, I see nothing at all. I'm sure that dynamic allocation happens, though, as I can confirm with valgrind (13 plus string length bytes are allocated). I went through several source files and the standard, and I'm pretty sure that the template is std::basic_string<T, std::char_traits<T>, std::allocator<T>>, so I'm at a loss why I don't see the messages from my replaced allocation functions. Can anyone shed any light on this conundrum? What do I do to track string allocations? Also, could anyone run this through some other compiler and see if it produces any output? (For example: if I add std::map<int, int> m { { 0, 1 } };, I have output new() requests 24 bytes, allocated at 0x8d53028 etc.)
@CODE:-fwhole-program std::string -fwhole-program #include <new>

WILL POST COMPILABLE CODE WHEN IT WORKS. However, I'm still completely confused on how to use getopt_long() in C. The program I'm writing is defined as having the following possible tags (but can include as many as you absolutely need, filling the rest in with empty values): id3tagEd filename -title "title" -artist "artist" -year 1991 -comment "comment" -album "album" -track 1
 Now, from what I read, I need to utilize a struct for the long options, correct? If so, I wrote something along the lines of this: struct fields field =
{
    char *[] title;
    char *[] artist;
    char *[] album;
    int year;
    char *[] comment;
    int track;
}


static struct options long_options[] =
{
    {"title", 0, &field.title, 't'},
    {"artist", 0, &field.artist, 'a'},
    {"album", 0, &field.album, 'b'},
    {"year", 0, &field.year, 'y'},
    {"comment", 0, &field.comment, 'c'},
    {"track", 0, &field.track, 'u'},
    {0, 0, 0, 0}
}
 Now, from what I gathered, I would be calling it via this: int option_index = 0;

int values = getopt_long(argc, argv, "tabycu", long_options, &option_index);
 From here, could I strictly use the field struct and do what I need to within my program? However, if this is the case, can someone explain the whole long_options struct? I read the man pages and such, and I'm just utterly confused. By rereading the man pages, I can see I can set variables to null, and should be setting all my option requirements to "required_argument"? And then setting the structs via a while() loop? However, I see optarg being used. Is this set by getopt_long()? Or is it missing from the example? And one last issue, I will always have an unnamed required option: filename, would I just use argv[0] to gain access to that? (Since I can assume it'll be first). On a side note, this is related to a homework problem, but it has nothing to do with fixing it, its more of a fundamental, have to understand argument passing and parsing in C via command line first.

@TITLE:Using Ajax and jQuery to check if file exists - always returns 200 response
@CONTENT:So I'm need to check whether a file exists before showing specific data to clients...using jQuery I have this: <script>
function fileExists(fileLocation) {
    var response = $.ajax({
        url: fileLocation,
        type: 'HEAD',
        async: false
    }).status;
    alert(response);
}
</script>
 When I attempt to run the function: <script> fileExists('http://www.example.com/123.jpg'); </script>
 (where example.com is my domain), I ALWAYS receive a 200 response code. I was wondering why this might be happening - could it be that I have a custom error page set through .htaccess? Or, is there a better method to do this? Note: jQuery 1.5.1 is being used. Update: It seems it is being directed to our custom error page set through .htaccess: ErrorDocument 404 http://www.example.com/errors/notfound.php
 Not sure if this causes the conflict, or how to get around it. SOLVED I checked the headers for my custom 404 page, it was returning a 200 response code. Had to hard code the header: <?php header('HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found'); ?>
 which would then return the 404 response code - fixing my issue.
@CODE:<script>
function fileExists(fileLocation) {
    var response = $.ajax({
        url: fileLocation,
        type: 'HEAD',
        async: false
    }).status;
    alert(response);
}
</script> <script> fileExists('http://www.example.com/123.jpg'); </script> ErrorDocument 404 http://www.example.com/errors/notfound.php <?php header('HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found'); ?> <script> function fileExists(fileLocation) { $.ajax({ type: 'GET', url: fileLocation, success: function() { alert('Page found.'); }, error: function(jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown){ log(jqXHR); log(errorThrown); } }); } </script>

@LINK:/questions/7425978/catching-timeout-errors-with-ruby-mechanize
@TITLE:Catching timeout errors with ruby mechanize
@CONTENT:I have a mechanize function to log me out of a site but on very rare occasions it times me out. The function involves going to a specific page, and then clicking on a logout button. On the occasional that mechanize suffers a timeout when either going to the logout page or clicking the logout button the code crashes. So I put in a small rescue and it seems to be working as seen below the first piece of code. def logmeout(agent)
  page = agent.get('http://www.example.com/')
  agent.click(page.link_with(:text => /Log Out/i))
end      
 Logmeout with rescue: def logmeout(agent)
  begin
  page = agent.get('http://www.example.com/')
  agent.click(page.link_with(:text => /Log Out/i))
  rescue Timeout::Error 
    puts "Timeout!"
    retry
  end
end
 Assuming I understand rescue correctly, it will do both actions over even if just the clicking timed out, so in the effort to be efficient I am was wondering if I could use a proc in this situation and pass it a code block. Would something like this work: def trythreetimes
  tries = 0
  begin
  yield
  rescue
    tries += 1
    puts "Trying again!"
    retry if tries <= 3
  end
end

def logmeout(agent)
  trythreetimes {page = agent.get('http://www.example.com/')}
  trythreetimes {agent.click(page.link_with(:text => /Log Out/i))}
end
 Note in my trythreetimes function I left it as generic rescue so the function would be more re-usable. Thanks so much for any help anyone can provide, I realize there are a couple different questions in here but they are all things I am trying to learn!
@CODE:def logmeout(agent)
  page = agent.get('http://www.example.com/')
  agent.click(page.link_with(:text => /Log Out/i))
end def logmeout(agent)
  begin
  page = agent.get('http://www.example.com/')
  agent.click(page.link_with(:text => /Log Out/i))
  rescue Timeout::Error 
    puts "Timeout!"
    retry
  end
end def trythreetimes
  tries = 0
  begin
  yield
  rescue
    tries += 1
    puts "Trying again!"
    retry if tries <= 3
  end
end

def logmeout(agent)
  trythreetimes {page = agent.get('http://www.example.com/')}
  trythreetimes {agent.click(page.link_with(:text => /Log Out/i))}

@TITLE:ActiveRecord 3.1.0 multiple databases
@CONTENT:I'm trying to upgrade the ActiveRecord gem to the latest 3.1.0 release and seeing a lot of exceptions being raised, I think it's due to how we handle multiple databases. For each of our databases we specify a separate base class which inherits from ActiveRecord::Base, and call establish_connection in there. There are no cross-database relations. This has worked fine for us up until now. Having upgraded to ActiveRecord 3.1.0 I'm seeing that it fails with an ActiveRecord::ConnectionNotEstablished exception, when traversing relations (i.e. it will successfully pull a single entity or set of them from the DB, but fails when navigating to a related class). The top line of the backtrace is C:/Ruby/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/activerecord-3.1.0/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/abstract/connection_pool.rb:410:in 'retrieve_connection', so I dug into this a little. The method is defined as follows: def retrieve_connection(klass) #:nodoc:
    pool = retrieve_connection_pool(klass)
    (pool && pool.connection) or raise ConnectionNotEstablished
end
 My simple test (puts Customer.first.address) calls retrieve_connection 3 times. Twice with Customer as the klass parameter, and once with ActiveRecord::Base as the parameter - which is when it fails as establish_connection has not been called for ActiveRecord::Base. To the actual question then - is there a new recommended way of handling multiple database connections in ActiveRecord? If so, what is it? If not, what could be causing this problem?

@TITLE:Union iterator for maps?
@CONTENT:[Preface: The associative C++ containers like std::map are a bit like micro-databases with just one key column. Boost's bimap elevates this to a two-column table with lookup in both columns, but that that's as far as the analogy goes -- there's no "polymap" that generalizes the idea.] In any event, I want to keep thinking of maps as databases, and I now wonder if there is an iterator (or some other solution) that allows me to do a UNION of several constituent maps. That is, all maps have the same type (or value type and comparator, at least), and I want a single iterator that treats the entire collection as a big multimap (repeated keys are OK) and lets me traverse it in the correct unioned order. Does such a thing exist, perhaps within Boost? Or is it easy to rig one up? In pseudo code: std::map<K, M> m1, m2;
union_iterator<K, M> u(m1, m2)
for(auto it = u.begin(); it != u.end(); ++it) { /* ... */ }
 For example, if we had: m1 = { { 9:00, "Check in"}, { 12:00, "Break" }, { 16:00, "Check out"} };
m2 = { { 10:30, "coffee" }, { 12:15, "baked beans" }, { 15:00, "lies" } };
 then I want the iterator to produce: 9:00, "Check in"; 10:30, "coffee"; 12:00, "Break"; 12:15, "baked beans"; ...

m2 = { { 10:30, "coffee" }, { 12:15, "baked beans" }, { 15:00, "lies" } }; 9:00, "Check in"; 10:30, "coffee"; 12:00, "Break"; 12:15, "baked beans"; ... std::pair <key, value> ++ O(log n) n O(n log n) n n=2 boost::multi_index

@TITLE:tracking file renaming/deleting with FSEvents on Lion
@CONTENT:I'm trying to use FSEvents to detect when files were added/removed from a specific folder. For the moment, I implemented a simple wrapper around FSEvents, and it works fine : I get all the events. BUT the problem I have now is that when I rename a file in the Finder, I catch 2 distinct events : the first one of type "renamed" with the old file name, and another one with "renamed" and the new filename. The event ids are different between both calls. So, how am I supposed to know which "renamed" event contains the old name, and which event contains the old one ?? I tried looking in the documentation, but unfortunately, kFSEventStreamEventFlagItemRenamed is not documented ... it seems new in Lion. PS: the only way I could think of was : on a renamed event, I check my UI to see if I have an item corresponding to the event path. If so, I flag it for renaming. If not, I check if an item was flagged for renaming, and if so, then I rename it to the new event path. But I really don't like this idea ... Edit: Ok, I imlemented something along the line of my "PS" : I noticed that when renaming something, the ids of the 2 events are consecutives, so that with the id of the event containing the new name, I can get the event containing the old name. I simply use a little dictionnary in my interface to store ids and associated paths in the case of a "renamed" event. Anyway, I can now catch rename events, and even move events : when you move a file, it's a "renamed" event which is caught by the FSEventStream ... But, I still have one last problem : deleting. When I delete something, it's moved to the recycle bin : I receive a "renamed" event. But the problem is that I don't receive the second rename event. Only a "modified" event on the .DS_Store file. I think this file is used by the Finder to know which files are in the bin, etc. So I could check modification to this file, and get the last "renamed" event to detect that a file was sent to the bin. But I'm using TotalFinder which uses Asepsis, which modifies the way the Finder stores .DS_Store files : I no longer receive "modified" on this. To sumarize : I can't detect when a file is sent to the bin ... Any idea how I can do that ? Maybe use something else than FSEvents to catch only this event ?

 Where cardReference is an array of integer to Resources (in my case 20 TextViews arranged in a 4 x 5 Matrix): int[] cardReference = new int[]{R.id.card1_1, R.id.card1_2, R.id.card1_3, R.id.card1_4,
                              R.id.card2_1, R.id.card2_2, R.id.card2_3, R.id.card2_4,
                              R.id.card3_1, R.id.card3_2, R.id.card3_3, R.id.card3_4,
                              R.id.card4_1, R.id.card4_2, R.id.card4_3, R.id.card4_4,
                              R.id.card5_1, R.id.card5_2, R.id.card5_3, R.id.card5_4};
 To speed up performance i would consider to use an array of TextViews then call findViewById() in every Loop.
@CODE:private View findViewByCoord(float x, float y){
    TextView textView = null;
    int[] location = new int[2];
    int width = 0;
    int height = 0;
    for(int reference : cardReference){
        textView = (TextView) findViewById(reference);
        textView.getLocationOnScreen(location);
        width = textView.getWidth();
        height = textView.getHeight();
        if(location[0] <= x && x <= (location[0] + width) && location[1] <= y && y <= (location[1] + height)){
            Log.i("Test", "Card " + textView.getText() + " is pointed");
            return textView;
        }
    }
    return null;
} int[] cardReference = new int[]{R.id.card1_1, R.id.card1_2, R.id.card1_3, R.id.card1_4,
                              R.id.card2_1, R.id.card2_2, R.id.card2_3, R.id.card2_4,
                              R.id.card3_1, R.id.card3_2, R.id.card3_3, R.id.card3_4,
                              R.id.card4_1, R.id.card4_2, R.id.card4_3, R.id.card4_4,
                              R.id.card5_1, R.id.card5_2, R.id.card5_3, R.id.card5_4};

@TITLE:How to create custom text-to-speech engine
@CONTENT:As I know, TTS needs TTS engine to speak one language. In Android emulator 2.2, Pico TTS engine is default. It has only some popular languages. I can see some engines on Market which must be purchased to install. My question: is there any way to create a custom engine which support other languages?(by programming or using software) (I don't know if I should post this question in StackOverflow or SuperUser. If wrong place, please migrate it)

@TITLE:Custom Configuration for app.config - collections of sections?
@CONTENT:My head is absolutely pounding badly! I have done this before but not as "in depth" or complex as this and I have tried different ways to make this happen but all has failed. So, this is the custom XML I want in the app.config: <Profiles> <!--Collection-->
<Profile Name="Live">
   <Components>
    <Component Name="Portal" Type="Web" />
    <Component Name="Comms" Type="Web" />
    <Component Name="Scheduler" Type="WindowsService" ServiceName="LiveScheduler" />
  </Components>
  <Databases>
    <Database Name="Main" Connection="Data Source=.\SQL2008" />
    <Database Name="Staging" Connection="Data Source=SomeSite.co.uk" />
  </Databases>
</Profile>
<Profile Name="Test">
   <Components>
    <Component Name="Portal" Type="Web" />
    <Component Name="Comms" Type="Web" />
    <Component Name="Scheduler" Type="WindowsService" ServiceName="TestScheduler" />
  </Components>
  <Databases>
    <Database Name="Main" Connection="Data Source=.\SQL2008" />
    <Database Name="Staging" Connection="Data Source=Internal" />
  </Databases>
</Profile>
</Profiles>
 So a collection of Profile with each profile having a collection of sub elements (Components is a collection, then Component is an element) However I currently have all that EXCEPT for the multiple profiles.

@TITLE:CSS - Apply Opacity to Element but NOT To Text Within The Element
@CONTENT:I have created a menu block element which I have applied an opacity of 0.4/40 to. The problem I have is that the opacity affects the text within the menu block and I am looking to have the opacity ONLY applied to the menu block, but not the text. Hopefully I have just missed something silly. Here is my code: #menuLeft{
    background-color: #33AAEE;
    float: left;
    width: 20%;
    clear: both;
    opacity:0.4;
    filter: alpha(opacity = 40);
}
 I am looking for a way to keep the text colour the same/set the opacity to exclude the text. Thank you.

@TITLE:Android seekbar set custom style using nine-patch images
@CONTENT:I am trying to create a custom-styled seekbar. I have two nine-patch images one is a gray stretching bar search_progress.9.png (background color) and the other is a green stretching bar search_progress_bar.9.png (foreground color). I use this xml as my seekbar's progressDrawable: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<layer-list xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
    <item android:id="@android:id/background" android:drawable="@drawable/search_progress"></item>
    <item android:id="@android:id/progress" android:drawable="@drawable/search_progress_bar"></item>
</layer-list>
 My problem is that, instead of the bar filling up to my thumb position, the entire bar is green all the time (search_progress_bar image). How can I get the same effect as Android's progress_horizontal.xml with my own images (I do not want to use shapes to draw my bar)?
@CODE:<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

@TITLE:foreach with SqlDataReader?
@CONTENT:I have the following code: SqlDataReader reader = getAddressQuery.sqlReader;
while (reader.Read())
{
    foreach (Object ob in reader)
    {
        someText.InnerText = someText.InnerText + " " + ob.ToString();
    }
}
 The code in the foreach loop does not execute. However, I can do this: SqlDataReader reader = getAddressQuery.sqlReader;
while (reader.Read())
{
    someText.InnerText = reader[0].ToString();
}
 Which works. Obviously I could achieve the same result using a regular for loop rather than a foreach loop, but I think the foreach syntax is clearer, so I use it when possible. What has gone wrong here? Are foreach loops in c# not as flexible as in more high level languages?
@CODE:SqlDataReader reader = getAddressQuery.sqlReader;
while (reader.Read())
{
    foreach (Object ob in reader)
    {
        someText.InnerText = someText.InnerText + " " + ob.ToString();
    }
} SqlDataReader reader = getAddressQuery.sqlReader;
while (reader.Read())
{
    someText.InnerText = reader[0].ToString();

@TITLE:Flash in WebView not working on Android 3.2
@CONTENT:I am having a problem that only happens on my Motorola Xoom which I have updated to 3.2 through OTA. I have a simple application that uses a WebView to load a small html that has flash content in it. Here is the code snippet. mWebView = (WebView) findViewById(R.id.webview);
mWebView.getSettings().setJavaScriptEnabled(true);
mWebView.getSettings().setPluginsEnabled(true);
 I know it is correct because it can run fine on my Samsung Galaxy S running Android 2.2. Anybody else seen this problem? Any idea how I can solve this problem? Many thanks and I am really stuck here.

@TITLE:Tower Of Hanoi - JavaScript - THe Good Parts [duplicate]
@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: problem understanding how recursion applies to Towers of Hanoi 2 answers I have seen the other Questions on SO about the Recursive function and I have read the responses but I still can't get the algorithm to click in my head var hanoi = function (disc, src, aux, dst) {

  if (disc > 0) {
    hanoi(disc - 1, src, dst, aux);
   document.write('Move disc ' + disc + ' from ' + src + ' to ' + dst);
    hanoi(disc - 1, aux, src, dst);
  }
}

hanoi(3, 'Src', 'Aux', 'Dst');
 How does the document.write(...), ever run. My Logic is First time we run the function disc is > 3. then we recursively call the function again skipping everything below so how does the document.write get a chance to run? I understand recursion (done the basic examples) but i still can't see how you get an output. If there is a way i can run it visually and see it in action, that would help alot.
@CODE:var hanoi = function (disc, src, aux, dst) {

  if (disc > 0) {
    hanoi(disc - 1, src, dst, aux);
   document.write('Move disc ' + disc + ' from ' + src + ' to ' + dst);
    hanoi(disc - 1, aux, src, dst);
  }
}

hanoi(3, 'Src', 'Aux', 'Dst');

@TITLE:CakePHP updateAll() issues
@CONTENT:I have an images table with a column called type. I simply want to update all the rows to change the type to gallery where the user_id matches a particular user. I am using this code     $this->Image->updateAll(array('Image.type' => 'gallery'), 
    array('Image.user_id' => $this->Auth->user('id')));
 But I get this error: SQL Error: 1054: Unknown column 'gallery' in 'field list' Why is gallery being added to the field list ? Isn't the syntax supposed to set type to gallery? Thanks!

@LINK:/questions/6981555/how-to-output-binary-data-to-a-file-in-java
@TITLE:How to output binary data to a file in Java?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to write data to a file in binary format for compression. The data consists entirely of floating points so I decided to quantize the data to an intergers between 0 and 65535 so the data can be written as two bit unsigned integers and ultimately save space. However, I need to output that quantized data to a file in binary instead of human-readable Ascii. At the moment this is what I'm doing @param outputFile the file containing the already quantized data as strings in a .txt file public void generateBinaryRioFile(String materialLibrary,
        String outputFile, String group, String mtlAux) {

    try {

        // Create file
        FileWriter fileStream = new FileWriter(outputFile);
        try {

            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(new File(
                    "idx.txt")));

            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
                writer.write(line + "\n");
            }
            try {
                br.close();

            } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
                e.getMessage();
            } catch (IOException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }           BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(fileStream);
 However that writes to the file as a human readable string. I need it to be written as binary data. How does one go about doing this in Java?
@CODE:public void generateBinaryRioFile(String materialLibrary,
        String outputFile, String group, String mtlAux) {

    try {

        // Create file
        FileWriter fileStream = new FileWriter(outputFile);

                    "idx.txt")));

            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
                writer.write(line + "\n");
            }
            try {
                br.close();

            } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {

@TITLE:Calling a Objective C function from C++ Code
@CONTENT:I googled around and I find a million results to this subject. But none of the pages helps me. I think that I have a very common problem. I'm playing around with audio programming especially working with audio queues. The purpose of my program does not matter for explaining the problem. But in a nutshell: I get an error when I try to call an objective-c function from c++ code. So here is my code that contains the error: AudioRecorder.h: #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>


@interface AudioRecorder : NSObject {

}

-(void)setup;
-(void)startRecording;
-(void)endRecording;
-(void)playAlarmSound;

@end
 And this is the implementation: AudioRecorder.mm: #import "AudioRecorder.h"
#include <AudioToolbox/AudioToolbox.h>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

@implementation AudioRecorder

static const int kNumberBuffers = 3;
...
static void HandleInputBuffer (void                                 *aqData,
                           AudioQueueRef                        inAQ,
                           AudioQueueBufferRef                  inBuffer,
                           const AudioTimeStamp                 *inStartTime,
                           UInt32                               inNumPackets,
                           const AudioStreamPacketDescription   *inPacketDesc ) {

    AQRecorderState *pAqData = (AQRecorderState *) aqData;              

    if (inNumPackets == 0 &&                                            
        pAqData->mDataFormat.mBytesPerPacket != 0)
        inNumPackets =
        inBuffer->mAudioDataByteSize / pAqData->mDataFormat.mBytesPerPacket;

    UInt32 size;
    AudioQueueGetPropertySize ( inAQ, kAudioQueueProperty_CurrentLevelMeter, &size );
    char* levelMeterData = new char[size];
    AudioQueueGetProperty ( inAQ, kAudioQueueProperty_CurrentLevelMeter, levelMeterData, &size );
    AudioQueueLevelMeterState* meterState =  reinterpret_cast<AudioQueueLevelMeterState*>(levelMeterData);
    cout << "mAveragePower = " << meterState->mAveragePower << endl;
    cout << "mPeakPower = " << meterState->mPeakPower << endl;
    delete levelMeterData;
    [self playAlarmSound]; //<--- here I get the error: Use of undeclared identifier 'self'   

    if (pAqData->mIsRunning == 0)                                   
        return;

    AudioQueueEnqueueBuffer ( pAqData->mQueue, inBuffer, 0, NULL );
}
...
-(void)playAlarmSound {
    NSLog(@"Alarmsound....");
}
 When I omit "[self playAlarmSound];" then everything works fine. So how do I call this Objective-C function from my C++ code?

@TITLE:OpenCV 2.3 with VS 2008 - Mouse Events
@CONTENT:Obligatory - I'm a newbie. Have a job that involves programming and I'm teaching myself as I go. Needless to say as a teacher I get things wrong frequently and thoroughly. Where I'm at right now: I've created the class "Graph", it (surprisingly enough) makes graphs. But now I want to make it so that on a mouse click I modify the graph. But I can't seem to get a mouse handler to be a member function of the class. cv::setMouseCallback(windowName, onMouse, 0); // Set mouse handler to be onMouse
 Doesn't work with cv::setMouseCallback(windowName, Graph::onMouse, 0);
 It gives me lack of parameter errors. According to this I can't make it a member function. After following the answer given, it compiles but my this pointer is nulled. Ugh. OnMouse looks like this: void onMouse(int event, int x, int y,int, void*)
{
    if (event == CV_EVENT_LBUTTONDOWN)
    {
        cvMoveWindow("Window", 500, 500); //Just to see if stuff happened
    }
    return;
}
 I don't care about moving the window, I want to modify the graph itself - which is stored as a cv::Mat variable in a Graph object. And I can't figure out how to do it. Any help would be appreciated, and I really hope this wasn't just gibberish.
@CODE:cv::setMouseCallback(windowName, onMouse, 0); // Set mouse handler to be onMouse cv::setMouseCallback(windowName, Graph::onMouse, 0); this void onMouse(int event, int x, int y,int, void*)

 Method GetS of class Address translates a number (uint32_t m_address) into a string and returns it. The code (very simple) is the following: std::string
Address::GetS () const
{
  std::ostringstream oss;
  oss << m_address;
  return oss.str ();
}
 Besides, as can be seen in the backtrace, m_address is properly defined. Now, I have tried to run my program using valgrind. The program doesn't crash, likely due to the fact that valgrind replaces malloc () among other functions. The error summary shows no memory leaking: LEAK SUMMARY:

 I don't think this is related to the bug. However, the code in question can be found following this link. I am thinking of a bug in libstdc++. However, how likely would that be? I have also upgraded such library. Here's the versions currently installed on my system. $ dpkg -l | grep libstdc
ii  libstdc++5          1:3.3.6-23  The GNU Standard C++ Library v3

 Now the thing is, I am not sure which version g++ uses, and whether there's some means to enforce the use of a particular version. What I am pondering is to modify GetS. But this is the only method I know. Do you suggest any alternative? Eventually, I am even considering to replace std::string with simpler char*. Maybe a little drastic, but I wouldn't set it aside. Any thought in merit? Thank you all in advance. Best, Jir

@TITLE:How can I replace a factor levels with the top n levels (by some metric), plus [other]?
@CONTENT:For a factor with more than a sensible number of levels to color in a graph, I want to replace any levels that are not in the 'top 10' with 'other'. Alternate Question: How do I reduce my factor levels to the number rcolorbrewer can plot as separate colors? For example, if I want to plot number of homeruns per decade from the baseball data: require(ggplot2)
qplot(data=baseball,10*year%/%10,hr,
  stat="identity",geom="bar")
 Perhaps I'd like to see what teams contributed to this: qplot(data=baseball,10*year%/%10,hr,
  fill=team,
  stat="identity",geom="bar")
 This creates too many color levels! The colors are so similar you can't distinguish them, and there are so many they won't fit on the screen. I'd really like to see the top X (7) teams (by total homerun count) and then the rest all lumped together in a single category/color called 'other'. Let's imagine we have a function called hotfactor which knows how to do this: hotfactor(afactor,orderby,count)={ ??? }

qplot(data=baseball,10*year%/%10,hr,
  fill=hotfactor(factor(team),hr,n=7),
  stat="identity",geom="bar") + 
  scale_fill_brewer("team","Dark2")
 So what can I use for 'hotfactor'?
@CODE:require(ggplot2)
qplot(data=baseball,10*year%/%10,hr,
  stat="identity",geom="bar") qplot(data=baseball,10*year%/%10,hr,
  fill=team,
  stat="identity",geom="bar") hotfactor hotfactor(afactor,orderby,count)={ ??? }

qplot(data=baseball,10*year%/%10,hr,
  fill=hotfactor(factor(team),hr,n=7),
  stat="identity",geom="bar") + 
  scale_fill_brewer("team","Dark2")

@TITLE:Easiest way to inject code to all methods and properties that don't have a custom attribute
@CONTENT:There are a a lot of questions and answers around AOP in .NET here on Stack?Overflow, often mentioning PostSharp and other third-party products. So there seems to be quite a range of AOP optons in the .NET and C# world. But each of those has their restrictions, and after downloading the promising PostSharp I found in their documentation that 'methods have to be virtual' in order to be able to inject code (edit: see ChrisWue's answer and my comment - the virtual constraint must have been on one of the contenders, I suppose). I haven't investigated the accuracy of this statement any further, but it's categoricality made me return back to Stack?Overflow. So I'd like to get an answer to this very specific question: I want to inject simple "if (some-condition) Console.WriteLine" style code to every method and property (static, sealed, internal, virtual, non-virtual, doesn't matter) in my project that does not have a custom annotation, in order to dynamically test my software at run-time. This injected code should not remain in the release build, it is just meant for dynamic testing (thread-related) during development. What's the easiest way to do this? I stumbled upon Mono.Cecil, which looks ideal, except that you seem to have to write the code that you want to inject in IL. This isn't a huge problem, it's easy to use Mono.Cecil to get an IL version of code written in C#. But nevertheless, if there was something simpler, ideally even built into .NET (I'm still on .NET 3.5), I'd like to know. [Update: If the suggested tool is not part of the .NET Framework, it would be nice if it was open-source, like Mono.Cecil, or freely available]

@CONTENT:If I type crontab -l in the command-line I can see the following line: # * * * * * /usr/bin/php /home/user/every_minute_script.php
 To start this cronjob, I need to edit the file using crontab -e command, remove the comment character at the beginning of the line, save the edited file, and exit the editor. To stop this cronjob, the same steps, but adding the comment character at the beginning of the line.

@TITLE:Finding tcp ports used by application
@CONTENT:Alright, so I'm extending my company's flexlm vendor daemon to be a little bit more revealing to client applications. I need to be able to find out what port lmgrd is listening on before clients connect. The API documentation seems to be rather barren, and I believe they keep most of their code in a compiled form so I can't just look at their source. Is it possible to call upon the awesome power of the Windows API to find out what ports a particular process is using? If Process Explorer from sysinternals can do it, I should be able to right? Does anyone have sample code for this? It needs to support Windows XP and higher since many of our clients have yet to upgrade. Edit: I should note that it turns out FLEX has support for pulling the port from the license file. I don't have the code in front of me, but know that this isn't the best way to find out what ports your vendor daemon/lmgrd is running.

@TITLE:Google dashboard with filters from grouped data - how to chart grouped data
@CONTENT:I am looking to create a Google charts API dashboard with filtering but I would like to chart the data based on grouped data. For example, I can create a datatable such as this: salesman  cust_age  cust_sex  quantity
Joe       21        Male      3
Joe       30        Female    10

Dave      15        Female    5
Dave      30        Male      10
 I can appropriately create a dashboard that creates two controls (for cust_age and cust_sex) and any number of output graphs and tables all pulling from an external data source - this is pretty stock stuff, see http://code.google.com/apis/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/controls.html The problem that I am having is how to show all charts by grouped values. Using a pie chart as an example, without any filters there are 5 slices of the pie (Joe, Joe, Suzie, Dave, Dave) - I would like to see only three (Joe, Suzie Dave). Of course, when a control is applied everything should update. In other words, the filters should act on the original datatable, but the charts should be based on a grouped datatable. I would guess that we could use the grouping function: http://code.google.com/apis/ajax/playground/?type=visualization#group however I cannot seem to bind the filters to the larger datatable, update the grouped table, and then draw the charts based on the grouped table. Any thoughts?

 To make my printed_callback get invoked when a print finished. However, now that I'm adding preview support, I'm passing a PrintDocument constructed in exactly the same way into a PrintPreviewDialog. Doing so causes the EndPrint event to be invoked after the initial rendering of the printout needed for the preview. As a result, even if a user clicks "Preview" and then just closes the preview, our logging code gets invoked. Any suggestions for how to differentiate between a real printout and a "preview print" ? Unfortunately, I can't just not hook up to EndPrint for the PrintDocument passed to the PrintPreviewDialog since the user may click the "Print" button in the preview dialog and trigger a printout.

@LINK:/questions/6226546/elasticsearch-mapping-doesnt-work
@TITLE:ElasticSearch mapping doesn't work
@CONTENT:I'm trying to set up an ElasticSearch index with different analyzers for the individual fields. However, I can't seem to find a way to set field-specific analyzers; here's how I create my (test) index: curl -XPOST localhost:9200/twitter
curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/twitter/tweet/_mapping' -d '
{
    "tweet" : {
        "properties" : {
            "message" : {
                "type" : "string",
                "search_analyzer" : "snowball", 
                "index_analyzer" : "snowball"
            }
        }
    }
}'
 If I read the documentation correctly, then this should create the index 'twitter' with the type 'tweet', and content for the 'message' field should be analyzed through the snowball stemming analyzer. To test for this, I tried the following queries: curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/twitter/tweet/1' -d '{
    "message" : "Look, a fighting War-Unicorn!"
}'
curl -XGET localhost:9200/twitter/_search?q=fight
 If I'm not mistaken, then this should return a hit, as fight is the stem for fighting; the problem is, it doesn't, I'm getting zero hits. It appears as if ElasticSearch ignores the mapping entirely (even though ElasticSearch accepts all of these queries, as I get 'ok' back for each of them.) I've already tried replacing the default analyzer with a snowball analyzer, and then it works; thing is, I totally need to have field-specific analyzers, so this isn't going to help me. I also tried different analyzers and things like setting "index" to "no", but to no avail. What am I doing wrong?
@CODE:curl -XPOST localhost:9200/twitter
curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/twitter/tweet/_mapping' -d '
{
    "tweet" : {
        "properties" : {

                "index_analyzer" : "snowball"
            }
        }
    }

@TITLE:Context menu for TreeViewer based on selected node - SWT
@CONTENT:I need to create a context menu for a TreeViewer in an Eclipse plugin project. But, the menu should not contain constant items, they should vary depending on the type of the node that is selected. For example, my treeViewer has the following hierarchy: Node A
 |
 --Node B
  |
   --Node C
 For node A - I want to show a menu with an action, but for nodes B and C I don't want to show anything (no menu). I managed to create the menu for node A, but then I can't get rid of it when some other type of node is selected. My code looks like: treeViewer.addSelectionChangedListener(
            new ISelectionChangedListener(){
                public void selectionChanged(SelectionChangedEvent event) {
                    if(event.getSelection() instanceof IStructuredSelection) {
                        IStructuredSelection selection = (IStructuredSelection)event.getSelection();            
                        Object o = selection.getFirstElement();     

                        MenuManager menuMgr = new MenuManager();

                        if (o instanceof NodeA){

                            Menu menu = menuMgr.createContextMenu(treeViewer.getControl());
                            treeViewer.getControl().setMenu(menu);
                            getSite().registerContextMenu(menuMgr, treeViewer);

                            menuMgr.add(new SomeAction());

                        }else {
                            //what ?
                        }
                    }

                }
            }   
    );
 On the else branch I tried to call dispose(),removeAll() on the MenuManager...nothing works! Any help is appreciated, thanks.

@TITLE:ASP.NET MVC 3 multiple Models to single Form
@CONTENT:I'm learning ASP.NET MVC 3 and trying to create a View with a single form which is made up of multiple Models linked together by a foreign key. The end goal is to have the single form insert into all the database tables. The problem is that I cannot figure out why when I right click to create the View that the form is not auto-generated in the cshtml file. Auto-generated code helps a lot since I have many tables that link together, and many fields which I must validate and insert. If it's not possible to auto-generate the form, what is the most efficient/elegant way to get this done? Here's a simplification of what I have. Model: class Customer
{
    [Key]
    public UInt64 CustomerId { get; set; }

    [Required(ErrorMessage = "Name is required.")]
    [Display(Name = "Customer Name")]
    [MaxLength(50)]
    public string FullName { get; set; }
}

    [Required(ErrorMessage = "This info is required.")]
    [Display(Name = "Customer Information")]
    [MaxLength(50)]
    public string SomeInfo { get; set; }
}

class CustomerAdditionalDetails2

@TITLE:How to recalculate axis-aligned bounding box after translate/rotate?
@CONTENT:When I first load my object I calculate the initial AABB with the max and min (x,y,z) points. But this is in object space and the object moves around the world and more importantly, rotates. How do I recalculate the new AABB every time the object is translated/rotated? This happens basically every frame, is it going to be a very intensive operation to recalculate the new AABB every frame? If so, what would be the alternative? I know AABBs will make my collision detection less accurate but it's easier to implement the collision detection code than OBBs and I want to take this one step at a time. Here's my current code after some insight from the answers below: typedef struct sAxisAlignedBoundingBox {
    Vector3D bounds[8];
    Vector3D max, min;
} AxisAlignedBoundingBox;

void drawAxisAlignedBoundingBox(AxisAlignedBoundingBox box) {

I mean (alike Firefox) if I close all tabs in a particular terminal window, how do I open with same the next day? Its really useful to remember the terminal session for people like me who use multiple tabs a lot, and do not wish to start the next day with remembering what (and whereall) one was working, when one left the desk the day before. In mouse right-click menu of gnome-terminal, one could easily (and I have) mistakenly click close tab instead of 'Copy'and lost track of what and where one was before selecting the text selected. In this case, undo closed-tab will serve a great purpose (available in Firefox already) Thanks! --V

@CONTENT:Lately I've been working on implementing security for my web application, running on a Glassfish v3. I successfully managed to secure some resources by setting a basic authentication up like following: <login-config>
<auth-method>BASIC</auth-method>
<realm-name>vcards-admin</realm-name>
</login-config>
 Now I was wondering how to get the user name introduced on the login prompt to fecth the actual data of the user. I thought there could be a session attribute to get that piece of data, but I don't know which one it is. Am I wrong about the session attribute? Is there any other way to access that login information? Thanks in advance.

How can I get an NSArray containing only one attribute from the NSArray having Person objects? Something like: NSArray *people;

@TITLE:C Macro - Dynamic #include
@CONTENT:I'm trying to figure out how to build a variable string for the #include statement using GCC. The idea is that for each source module I have written, I want to include as a header, a dynamically generated C source, that was created earlier in the build process. Generating this file is not an issue. Including it, unfortunately, is. What I have so far is (identities.h): // identities.h

# define PASTER2(str)  #str
# define PASTER(str)   PASTER2(str ## .iden)
# define EVALUATOR(x)  PASTER(x)

# define IDENTITIES_FILE EVALUATOR(__FILE__)
# include IDENTITIES_FILE
 Ideally, this would be used like so (main.c): //main.c

# include "identities.h"

int main() {return 0;}
 Which would be expanded in a single pass by the preprocessor before compilation to yield: //main.c (preprocessed)

# include "main.c.iden"

int main() {return 0;}
 The two levels of indirection I'm using (PASTER and EVALUATOR) are a result of this post. Unfortunately, this is not working and I am left with the error: obj/win32/dbg/main.o
In file included from main.c:1:0:
identities.h:42:1: error: #include expects "FILENAME" or <FILENAME>
 I think the problem is that the include statement is missing quotes.. Any ideas?

@TITLE:How would you define map and filter using foldr in Haskell?
@CONTENT:I'm doing a bit of self study on functional languages (currently using Haskell). I came across a Haskell based assignment which requires defining map and filter in terms of foldr. For the life of me I'm not fully understanding how to go about this. For example when I define a map function like: map'            :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
map' f []       = []
map' f (x:xs)   = foldr (\x xs -> (f x):xs) [] xs
 I don't know why the first element of the list is always ignored. Meaning that: map' (*2) [1,2,3,4]
 results in [4,6,8] instead of [2,4,6,8] Similarly, my filter' function: filter'             :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
filter' p []        = []
filter' p (x:xs)    = foldr (\x xs -> if p x then x:xs else xs ) [] xs
 when run as: filter' even [2,3,4,5,6]
 results in [4,6] instead of [2,4,6] Why would this be the case? And how SHOULD I have defined these functions to get the expected results? I'm assuming something is wrong with my lambda expressions...
@CODE:map'            :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
map' f []       = []
map' f (x:xs)   = foldr (\x xs -> (f x):xs) [] xs map' (*2) [1,2,3,4] filter'             :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
filter' p []        = []
filter' p (x:xs)    = foldr (\x xs -> if p x then x:xs else xs ) [] xs filter' even [2,3,4,5,6]

@TITLE:Forcing a revalidate on mvc3 unobtrusive remote validation
@CONTENT:It's a classic login flow. The user can choose between 'new user' or 'existing user'. If the user is new, the name in the login box should validate against the server to see if the username is unique, if it's an existing user this check will be skipped since we expect the username to be taken already (ofcourse). I added a [Remote] attribute on the viewmodel and added the radiobutton for new/exiting user as 'additional fields'. This way the remote validation will just return true if it's an existing user, and check the database if it's not, to see if the username is taken. This works great, except when the user decides to change the radiobutton (new/existing) after entered a username (and the remote validation has run). Since remote validation is only automatically run when the username changes (that's the property with [Remote] attribute), changing the radiobutton alone, will not have it run again. So my problem is, how can i force the remote validation to run again? I tried the usual hacks by triggering a change/focus/blur event on the username input field, but the call is not triggered. I considered adding a similar [Remote] on the radiobutton, but that would really complicate things with two equal looking error messages, placed at the same absolute position. Is there any way to trigger a revalidation?

@CONTENT:I am building a file synchronization program (not unlike Dropbox) using node.js on both ends. I need to have potentially thousands of clients requesting data at the same time. Here is my current system: Server pushes notifications to client over a websocket (file has been updated) Client queues downloads and makes an HTTP request when idle I will be serving data in compressed chunks of, say, 50 MB each, so the HTTP request overhead (headers) is negligible. If I were to use websockets for requests and push notifications, would there be: Noticeable overall speed improvements? (reduced latency, authentication, etc.) Additional overhead on the server to keep connections open? Issues with pushing binary data? I think I need to have notifications sent over a dedicated websocket because I don't want them to be queued on the server while a download is taking place (lots of overhead). Note: These websockets will be open long-term, as long as the client's system is on. EDIT: I will be using the websockets on a different http server on different ports in order to move them to different CPU cores. I could potentially have thousands (if not hundreds of thousands) of concurrent websockets open...

Note that I am explicitly not calling save() and restore() around my transformations. If I perform the standard ctx.clearRect(0,0,ctx.canvas.width,ctx.canvas.height) then the entire visible canvas will not be cleared; downscaling or panning may cause this initial rectangle to not exactly cover the drawing area. If I perform the Webkit-friendly clearing method... var w=canvas.width;
canvas.width = 0;
canvas.width = w;
 ...then the cumulative transformation of the context is reset. How can I best clear the entire canvas context without losing my transformation?
@CODE:translate() scale() save() restore() ctx.clearRect(0,0,ctx.canvas.width,ctx.canvas.height) var w=canvas.width;
canvas.width = 0;
canvas.width = w;

@TITLE:emulating partial function application in c
@CONTENT:I'm writing a C program that would, if had been a part of the language, benefit from, partial function application. I need to supply a function pointer with a fixed signature but sometime I need to call already written function that needs arguments. I can write a lot of small functions, calling each other as: // example, not actual code
void (*atJoystickLeft)(void); // fixed signature

.. code ..
atJoystickLeft = &func1;
.. code ..

void func1(void) { func2(10, "a string"); } /
 I vould like instead: atJoystickLeft = &func2(10, "a string");
 so I can dispose of the function func1 that is only to set parameter for the call to func2. That would make the code at least, 20% - 30% smaller. My simple question is: Do someone have a trick for emulating partial function application in C? (C99)
@CODE:// example, not actual code
void (*atJoystickLeft)(void); // fixed signature

.. code ..
atJoystickLeft = &func1;
.. code ..

void func1(void) { func2(10, "a string"); } / atJoystickLeft = &func2(10, "a string"); func2 bind

@TITLE:Why is an embedded google map altering Safari's font rendering?
@CONTENT:If you look at the footer on this page here in Safari, then look at the same footer on any other page, you'll see a difference in font rendering. It looks the the font smoothing is being applied twice to me. If I turn off the Google map, then the font rendering returns to normal, so I'm confident the map is at the root of the problem. I am applying a transparent font shadow to all text to fix some @font-face rendering issues (artefacts mainly), but this problem is present with or without text shadow. It's a Mac only problem. Has anyone else come across this problem? Is there a known cause and/or fix?

  bool errorFound = false;
  foreach (EventLogEntry entry in myEventLog.Entries)

According to MSDN, I need EventLogPermission, but I have been struggling to find any examples of how to use this permission. Does anyone have an example of how to do this? Edit: Response to Comments Thank you all for the comments - here is the additional information requested: The exception is thrown from the foreach statement. Specifically, when stepping through the code it thrown in the step after when in is highlighted. It seems that I was able to create the event log object but I'm not able to access the entries in the event log. My account does not have permission to read the event log on the target system, but I have credentials for an account which does. When connecting manually through the event viewer there is an option to connect as another user. After doing this manually, then my code ran without a problem. However, I cannot rely doing it manually every time this program runs. What I need is a way to connect as another user programmaticly. I thought that the EventLogPermission would be the way to do that, but maybe there is another way. If anyone knows how to connect to a remote log as a different user in C#, that would be exactly what I was looking for.

To avoid duplication when rendering display/editor templates, I want each sub-class template (Cheese.cshtml) to render its unique fields below that of its shared common base class template (Product.cshtml). However, casting from the derived class to the base class (Product)cheese and trying to display its template inside the sub-class template has no effect. DisplayTemplate File structure: .\Views\Shared\DisplayTemplates

    .\Cheese.cshtml -- renders unique class fields and calls Product.cshtml

@TITLE:How to implement a nested comment system?
@CONTENT:What would be the ideal way to implement this sort of thing? The idea I have in my head right now is to have a comments table and have each comment have a thread identifier and parent comment identifier. The thread identifier would indicate to which thread the comment belongs to and would allow for a simple MySQL statement using the WHERE clause. Each comment would have an auto_increment identifier as per usual database design and the parent identifier column would indicate which comment this comment is a child of. This type of design would put most of the stress on the PHP aspect of things because it would only be one SQL call to get all comments from a thread. Another implementation I found was having an SQL query for each nesting level. This solution would place the stress on the SQL sides of things. How would SO implement this? Currently I'm at a loss because I am not sure which solution is the "best" solution and I am still quite new to database design, PHP, and JQuery. Thanks.

@LINK:/questions/5235311/fluent-nhibernate-cascade-issue-trying-to-insert-null-id
@TITLE:Fluent NHibernate Cascade Issue - Trying To Insert NULL ID
@CONTENT:I have the following models & mappings (code snippets further below). One Competition has to have multiple CompetitionAnswers associated with it (multiple choice) from the outset. At present, using the Fluent NHibernate mappings shown below, when I create a brand new Competition object, populate the properties, then create 3 brand new CompetitionAnswer objects and add them to the CompetitionAnswers property (property on Competition), I would expect to call Save on the session which would INSERT the 1 Competition row and 3 CompetitionAnswer rows to the DB. However, as soon as I try to call Save on the session, it complains that CompetitionId is null and it can't insert a null into the CompetitionAnswers table for that field - which is right, it shouldn't, however, I assumed that the NHibernate would first create the Competition, then use the newly generated IDENTITY value (CompetitionId) in the CompetitionAnswers table? Competition (Model) public virtual int CompetitionId { get; private set; }
public virtual string Title { get; set; }
public virtual string Description { get; set; }
public virtual IList<CompetitionAnswer> CompetitionAnswers { get; set; }
 CompetitionAnswer (Model) public virtual int CompetitionAnswerId { get; set; }
public virtual string Answer { get; set; }
public virtual Competition Competition { get; set; }
 CompetitionMap (Fluent NHibernate Mapping) public CompetitionMap()
{
    Id(x => x.CompetitionId)
        .GeneratedBy.Native();
    Map(x => x.Title);
    Map(x => x.Description);
    HasMany(x => x.CompetitionAnswers)
        .Cascade.AllDeleteOrphan()
        .KeyColumn("CompetitionId")
        .Inverse();
    Table("Competitions");
}
 CompetitionAnswerMap (Fluent NHibernate Mapping) public CompetitionAnswerMap()
{
    Id(x => x.CompetitionAnswerId)
        .GeneratedBy.Native();
    Map(x => x.Answer);
    References(x => x.Competition)
        .Column("CompetitionId");
    Table("CompetitionAnswers");
}
 Here is some sample code that I've used to test this scenario, which generates the error: Competition c = new Competition();

c.Description = "Description";
c.Title = "Title";

CompetitionAnswer a1 = new CompetitionAnswer { Answer = "Answer 1" };
CompetitionAnswer a2 = new CompetitionAnswer { Answer = "Answer 2" };
CompetitionAnswer a3 = new CompetitionAnswer { Answer = "Answer 3" };

c.CompetitionAnswers.Add(a1);
c.CompetitionAnswers.Add(a2);
c.CompetitionAnswers.Add(a3);

session.Save(c);
 The exact error that I get as soon as it tries to Save is: Cannot insert the value NULL into column 'CompetitionId', table 'CompetitionAnswers'; column does not allow nulls. INSERT fails. The statement has been terminated. Can anyone please shed any light on why this isn't currently working?
@CODE:public virtual int CompetitionId { get; private set; }

  <id>internal-repository</id>

 My understanding is that this mirror prevents Maven from downloading dependencies from the internet, i.e. it will only look for them in this internal repository. However, whenever I want to add a dependency that isn't in this internal repository, I have to comment out the text above and add the following to the project's pom.xml <repository>
  <id>internal-repository</id>
  <url>http://build.idaho.local/wtp_repository</url>
</repository>
 When I make these changes Maven will check for dependencies in the local repo, and if not found, download them from the internet to the local repo. Once I have the dependencies I need, I then change my configuration back. Is there a way to get the behaviour I want - always check the internal repo, then the public (Internet) repos - without having to add the <repository> to every project's pom.xml? Ideally I would like to specify this repository once in settings.xml, but it seems that you can only configure mirrors there.

@CONTENT:I'm looking for a way to dynamically add in information about the application during the build process of an iOS application. During testing, it would be great to know when the application I have installed on my device was built and possibly who built it would be a good to know as well. I'm envisioning a section in settings.app that would give basic build information for debugging purposes. I don't want to have to manually update a build information file before each build - the data should be generated dynamically.

@LINK:/questions/4852922/how-to-like-facebook-content-externally
@TITLE:How to ¡§Like¡¨ facebook content externally
@CONTENT:So I have been playing around with the facebook like button but I have run into a problem. I have a facebook page about some charity work I'm doing here: http://www.facebook.com/Adam.Holmes.Climbs.Kilimanjaro. I also have a web page that has pretty much the same information on it. Within this web page I have a facebook like button so that users can like the page as seen here: http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/like/. Now my issue is with a seperate button. Within the facebook page I have added images of which some users have "liked" and commented etc. I have now placed those same images on my web page where I would like to add a facebook like button for each image and hence displaying all the likes that the image has on facebook. I have plugged many different links into the like button but none of them seem to work. I have tried a) the url of the page. b) the url of the image. c) random bits and bats manipulating different url's. I attempted to look through the javascript source code but it is much too complicated for my understanding. I know that a function fc_click() is called from the button which further calls another function, and not long after that I get lost, and have not found what url is used. So I guess my question is, what is the url to be placed in the "like" script so that I can use the like button externally to facebook? If anymore info is needed, please say so. Thank you very much :) UPDATE: I have been trying all different combination's or URL's and still having no luck. The object for one of the "Like" buttons is an object in the graph i.e. Here is the object I want to like. but none of these links are working. Maybe facebook are restricting this as it is simple to use the url of the page and it works fine, just not individual items. May I add again that I need the link that is to be placed in the tag and not just to be able to retrieve a count of the likes and comments etc. I also started a topic on the facebook developer forums here but no-one has replied with a solution. Thanks again. UPDATE 2: As pointed out by "Myles Gray" the code is actually rendered in the HTML as: <label onclick="this.form.like.click();"> I'm not sure if there is a way to access the form from an external page since is wouldn't have the correct this reference. Is anybody able to shed some light on whether this can be done, and if so, how? Surely if this can be done, having the correct reference to this would allow me to like content externally.

@TITLE:Python PIL: How to draw an ellipse in the middle of an image?
@CONTENT:I seem to be having some trouble getting this code to work: import Image, ImageDraw

im = Image.open("1.jpg")

draw = ImageDraw.Draw(im)
draw.ellipse((60, 60, 40, 40), fill=128)
del draw 

im.save('output.png')
im.show()
 This should draw an ellipse at (60,60) which is 40 by 40 pixels. The image returns nothing. This code works fine however: draw.ellipse ((0,0,40,40), fill=128)
 It just seems that when i change the first 2 co-ords (for where the ellipse should be placed) it won't work if they are larger than the size of the ellipse to be drawn. For example: draw.ellipse ((5,5,15,15), fill=128)
 Works, but only shows part of the rect. Whereas draw.ellipse ((5,5,3,3), fill=128)
 shows nothing at all. This happens when drawing a rectangle too.
@CODE:import Image, ImageDraw

im = Image.open("1.jpg")

draw = ImageDraw.Draw(im)

@TITLE:Eclipse + Maven: force Execution Environment ¡§JavaSE-1.6¡¨ instead of fixed JDK
@CONTENT:I'm using Eclipse as IDE and Maven outside of it to keep all dependencies up to date and update the Eclipse-project as such. In Eclipse I usually specify the JRE system library as an execution environment for any Java-project, usually "JavaSE-1.6". In the pom.xml I use the following lines:         <plugin>
            <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>2.3.2</version>
            <configuration>

 This seems to let Maven pick a JDK matching 1.6. It assigns its system libraries to the classpath of the project. However, it uses jdk1.6.20 directly rather than JavaSE-1.6. Is there a way to make Maven use JavaSE-1.6 instead? EDIT: Here's the batch file that I use to run Maven: SET JAVA_HOME=C:\Programme\java\jdk1.6.0_20

@LINK:/questions/4683350/blowfish-salt-length-for-the-crypt-function
@TITLE:Blowfish salt length for the Crypt() function?
@CONTENT:According to the crypt() documentation, the salt needs to be 22 base 64 digits from the alphabet "./0-9A-Za-z". This is the code example they give: crypt('rasmuslerdorf', '$2a$07$usesomesillystringforsalt$');
 The first confusing part is that salt has 25 characters, not 22. Question #1: Does that mean the salt is supposed to be longer than 22 characters? Then I tested the function myself and noticed something. If I use a 20 character salt, I get this // using 20 char salt: 00000000001111111111
crypt('rasmuslerdorf', '$2a$07$00000000001111111111$');
// $2a$07$00000000001111111111$.6Th1f3O1SYpWaEUfdz7ieidkQOkGKh2
 So, when I used a 20 character salt, the entire salt is in the output. Which is convenient, because I do not have to store the salt in a separate place then. (I want to use random salts). I would be able to read the salt back out of the generated hash. However, if I use a 22 character salt as the documentation says, or a longer one, the salt is cut off at the end. // using 22 char salt: 0000000000111111111122
crypt('rasmuslerdorf', '$2a$07$0000000000111111111122$');
// $2a$07$000000000011111111112uRTfyYkWmPPMWDRM/cUAlulrBkhVGlui
// 22nd character of the salt is gone

// using 25 char salt: 0000000000111111111122222
crypt('rasmuslerdorf', '$2a$07$0000000000111111111122222$');

// Same hash was generated as before, 21 chars of the salt are in the hash
 Question #2: So, what exactly is the proper length of a salt? 20? 22? Longer? Question #3: Also, is it a good idea to read the salt out of the hash when it is time to check passwords? Instead of storing the salt in a separate field and reading it from there. (Which seems redundant since the salt seems to be included in the hash).

@TITLE:git divergent renaming
@CONTENT:I'd like to know how you handle a situation like this in Git: create branch task001 from master master: modify foo.c and rename it to bar.c task001: modify foo.c and rename it to moo.c merge task001 to master What Git tells me is: CONFLICT (rename/rename): Rename "foo.c"->"bar.c" in branch "HEAD" rename "foo.c"->"moo.c" in "task001"
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
 How should I solve it? I mean, I still want to merge the two files once the name conflict is resolved. Thanks.

@TITLE:How to test if a string contains gibberish in PHP?
@CONTENT:I am making a registering form for a website and because I'm sure everyone is going to enter some gibberish in the Secret Answer's input (I do that myself), I would like to programmatically test that value to see if it's more likely to be a good answer. I have taken a look at a function that generates Markov Chains (see at bottom) in PHP but I don't know how to test a string against that chains' Array to actually detect the % accuracy of the given answer. Has anyone here did something similar ? How you solved it or have you given up ? Thank you function generateCaptchaTextMarkov($length) {

 Edit 2011-02-04: I've came up with a simple solution. I believe the letters in a gibberish string will most likely contains the same letters over and over again, I've came up with that little function: echo contains_gibberish( "heiahihaiaheiah" );

function contains_gibberish( $input )
{
    $result = array();

    for($i = 0; $i < strlen( $input ); $i++)
    {
        if ( isset( $result[ $input[ $i ] ] ) )
        {
            $result[ $input[ $i ] ]++;
        } else {
            $result[ $input[ $i ] ] = 1;
        }
    }

    return ( max( $result ) / strlen( $input ) * 100 >= 33 ) ? true : false;
}
 What do you guys think?

@CONTENT:I've recently run into a problem posting data to a server whose SSL certificate was updated. I did some research and I found that when CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER is set to false, post date goes through successfully. Can somebody explain the relationship between CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER and _VERIFYHOST? Also, if I set VERIFYPEER to false, am I no longer transmitting the data over a secure connection? Thanks a ton for any help anyone can give.

@TITLE:static_cast vs dynamic_cast
@CONTENT:Suppose I'm given a C++ library full of inheritance. I'm given a Base* in a function when I know that it is actually pointing to a Derived object and Derived inherits Base. But I don't know what kind of inheritance it is (public/protected/private). I also don't know if there is any virtual function in the hierarchy. Given this situation, without looking into the source code/documentation of Base and Derived, which cast should I use? Or should I consult the code/documentation first to ensure about polymorphism? Background I am writing changeEvent function of QMainWindow in Qt 4.7. The changeEvent function takes QEvent* which I can cast to other type by knowing QEvent::type(). I was wondering if I should use static_cast or dynamic_cast. Thanks.

 In the existing activity I added some lines to manually update the widget:         AppWidgetManager appWidgetManager = AppWidgetManager.getInstance(getApplicationContext());
        ComponentName componentName = new ComponentName(getApplicationContext(), Widget.class);

        update_widget.setAction(AppWidgetManager.ACTION_APPWIDGET_UPDATE);
        getApplicationContext().sendBroadcast(update_widget);
 But now I have this bug: If the widget is onClicked, it shows the energy-settings-widget for a short period (~0,5sec-1sec) before the desired widget is shown. Here a screenshot of this issue (sequence from left to right): http://i.stack.imgur.com/rHkjw.jpg First there's the widget as in the left picture, then changes to the middle picture and either stays there or changes to the right picture after ~0,5-1sec. Unfortunately I can't see any mistake in the code, do you? Hopefully you can help me to fix this problem ;) Thanks in advance, regards, Oli

@TITLE:How to select all text in JTable cell when editing
@CONTENT:I would like to have the editor in my editable JTables select all text in the cell when starting to edit. I have tried a couple of things that all revolve around calling JTextComponent.selectAll() on the component that is returned from the TableCellEditor.getTableCellEditorComponent method. None of the things I tried worked. In my latest attempt, I altered the SimpleTableDemo class from the Swing tutorial to use a custom TableCellEditor that calls the selectAll method. In the debugger I can see that the selectAll() method is being called, but the table still goes into edit mode without selecting the text in the cell (or perhaps the selection is being cleared before display). That code is below. Can anybody tell me where I'm going wrong?

I'm a novice with git so there is probably an easy explanation, but I'd like to have a workflow where when I was in live and I pulled changes (simple git merge stage), I didn't overwrite the existing .htaccess in the live branch. Is there any way to configure this? Am I missing some big concept in git? Likewise, there is also a chunk of a (but possibly many) .html files where I would like to keep track of changes but not merge them back into live.

@CONTENT:I'm having a bit of a noob issue. I wanted to get devise to redirect to the last page the user visited. So I did the following... def after_sign_in_path_for(resource)
    request.referer
end
 Works great...except if the user is actually logging in through the original form which causes a redirect loop. I tried def after_sign_in_path_for(resource)
   if (request.referer == "/users/sign_in")
  :pages_home
 else
  request.referer
 end

end
 But thats not working, most likely because I have no idea what request.referer is actually returning when it encounters the original user login page (www.example.com/users/sign_in). Any ideas? tldr; Using devise, I want to redirect to the page logged in from (i.e /blog/4) unless the page is /users/sign_in SOLVED: Matchu was right. The request.referer was returning the domain as well... http://example.com/users/sign_in
 (note: no www prefix) I'm still interested in an alternative to request.referer if its an insecure or inefficient way.

@CONTENT:Following up on my earlier question regarding GAE Datastore entity hierarchies, I'm still confused about when to use entity groups. Take this simple example: Every Company has one or more Employee entities An Employee cannot be moved to another Company, and users that deal with one Company can never see the Employees of another Company This looks like a case where I could make Employee a child entity of Company, but what are the practical consequences? Does this improve scalability, hurt scalability, or have no impact? What are other advantages/disadvantages of using or not using an entity hierarchy? (Entity groups enable transactions, but assume for this example that I do not need transactions).

@LINK:/questions/4312092/denormalization-of-two-relations
@TITLE:(De)Normalization of two relations
@CONTENT:People who read C.J.Date's Introduction to Database System or books of similar level should not have problems with definition of normalization and denormalization. However, memory is not what it used to be and I find myself often looking at some design and saying that it is not normalized even though I can not find which of the normal forms it is breaking. The actual example that illustrate it is: If we have relations r1 (A, B, C) and r2 (A, D) with FDs: AB->C and A->D and r1 represent detailed data, while r2 is summary of that data (in another words each instance of D is a function of values in r1. in this example let it be subtotal of values C according to A from r1). Example instance r1 = 
A  B  C  
1  1  10
1  2  20
2  1  10
2  2  25

r2 =
A  D
1  30
2  35
 So, even though I can not say that it breaks for example 2NF or 3NF, I seem to be stuck on the idea that the design is still denormalised in the following sense (from Codd, E.F. "Further Normalization of the Data Base Relational Model", p. 34, commenting on the reasons to normalize beyond 1NF): To free the collection of relations from undesirable insertion, update and deletion dependencies; To reduce the need for restructuring the collection of relations as new types of data are introduced, and thus increase the life span of application programs; To make the relational model more informative to users; To make the collection of relations neutral to the query statistics, where these statistics are liable to change as time goes by. As I can say, that if we define D as a sum of all Cs from r1 where A from r1 is equal to A from r2 then, if we update C in r1 and we don't update D in r2, we can end up with undesirable update dependency and the data ends up in inconsistent state I find this reason to call r1 and r2 denormalized and to think of them as denormalized. (In fact whole r2 is a function of r1 and bring zero new facts into the model; r2 = f(r1)) So the questions are can we call r1 and r2 denormalized? if yes, why? if not, why? (according to which rule? or according to which definition?) NOTE: To those who find the question(s) interesting enough to put in an answer, I kindly ask to provide either something quotable or to put it in a form of specific assumptions and conclusions (or in another words, if you are going to put in your opinion, please follow it with some reasoning). EDIT I accepted dportas answer. I'll try to add a bit to it here: C.J.Date can makes a clear and strict distinction: Much of design theory has to do with reducing redundancy; normalization reduces redundancy within relvars, orthogonality reduces it across relvars. quoted from Database in depth: relational theory for practitioners and on the next page just as a failure to normalize all the way implies redundancy and can lead to certain anomalies, so too can a failure to adhere to orthogonality.
@CODE:r1 (A, B, C) r2 (A, D) r1 r2 r1 = 
A  B  C  
1  1  10
1  2  20
2  1  10

@TITLE:Sharing an object between activities
@CONTENT:I have a Weather app with four Activities. The main/launcher activity is 'invisible' using... android:theme="@android:style/Theme.Translucent.NoTitleBar"` ...and is simply used to do a few checks (whether this is a new install, whether a network connection is available etc) before firing off one of the other Activities. The other Activities are UI-oriented - two simply display weather data pulled from a website and the third to provide a location 'picker' so the user can choose which area to show the weather for. However, all four activities make use of a WeatherHelper object which basically does everything from checking for available SD card storage to maintaining preferences and pulling/formatting website pages. So, my question(s)...what is the best way to have one instance of WeatherHelper which can be used by multiple activities and where/how are best to create it in my case?

@TITLE:App Engine: Is time.sleep() counting towards my quotas?
@CONTENT:Hey. I'm working on an App Engine app that involves queries to the Google Maps API for geocoding. Google Maps doesn't like too much requests so I put a 1 second delay between each request with time.sleep(1). I noticed that my quotas are running low in my GAE dashboard and decided to run a short test: import cProfile
import time

def foo():
    time.sleep(3)

cProfile.run('foo()')
 Which gave me the following output:    4 function calls in 3.003 CPU seconds
   Ordered by: standard name

   ncalls  tottime  percall  cumtime  percall filename:lineno(function)
        1    0.000    0.000    3.003    3.003 <stdin>:1(foo)
        1    0.000    0.000    3.003    3.003 <string>:1(<module>)
        1    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 {method 'disable' of '_lsprof.Profiler' objects}
        1    3.003    3.003    3.003    3.003 {time.sleep}
 So it says that it's consuming 3 CPU seconds for a time.sleep(3). Now I'm wondering if calls like these are counted towards the quota limits that GAE provides. And if it does, what is the other way of making delays between API calls for geocoding? Thanks.

@CONTENT:I have a UIScrollView containing an UIImageView and I have some trouble to get the correct behavior when the iPhone rotates. Goal: I am trying to obtain the following when going from portrait to landscape: _________
|AAAAAAA|
|BBBBBBB|         _________________

|GGGGGGG|
---------
 Here the entire image in the portrait view is scaled to fit in the landscape view when the iPhone rotates. It is also centered. I am also trying to preserve the aspect ratio. User interaction is also on, and the user should be able to use the entire screen to pan/zoom the image. Currently I have the following autoresizingMask on the scrollView:  scrollView.autoresizingMask =(UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleWidth |
                               UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleHeight);       
 But this gives the following _________

|FFFFFFF|         [DDDDDD__________|
|GGGGGGG|
---------
 This setting preserves scale and offset from upper left corner. Question: Is it possible to obtain this behaviour using suitable autoresizingMask? If not, one should probably set  scrollView.autoresizingMask = UIViewAutoresizingNone;
 and manually set zoomScale and contentOffset for the UIScrollView on rotation. But, where should that be done? What about animating that change? Solution: By very slightly modifying the answer below I got the above behaviour using the below code: imageView.autoresizingMask = (UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleWidth |
                                     UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleHeight);

scrollView.autoresizingMask =(UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleWidth 
                                     | UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleHeight);

imageView.contentMode = UIViewContentModeScaleAspectFit;

@TITLE:WPF - selected unfocused color of ListViewItem with a GridView
@CONTENT:I'm trying to change the default light gray highlight on a selected ListViewItem to be the blue highlight that shows up when the ListView is focused. I've been trying to reconcile different StackOverflow answers and sources online, but I haven't figured out what kind of XAML I need yet. I have the following: <ListView ItemContainerStyle="{StaticResource checkableListViewItem}"
          SelectionMode="Multiple"
          View="{StaticResource fieldValueGridView}"/>
 The referenced View resource is: <GridView x:Key="fieldValueGridView" AllowsColumnReorder="False">
    <GridViewColumn Header="Field">
        <GridViewColumn.CellTemplate>
            <DataTemplate>
                <StackPanel Orientation="Horizontal">
                    <TextBlock FontWeight="Bold" Text="{Binding Path=DisplayName}"/>
                    <TextBlock FontWeight="Bold" Text=": "/>
                </StackPanel>
            </DataTemplate>
        </GridViewColumn.CellTemplate>
    </GridViewColumn>
    <GridViewColumn Header="Value" DisplayMemberBinding="{Binding Path=FieldValue}"/>
</GridView>
 And the referenced ItemContainerStyle resource is: <Style TargetType="ListViewItem" BasedOn="{StaticResource {x:Type ListViewItem}}"
       x:Key="checkableListViewItem">
    <Setter Property="IsSelected" Value="{Binding Path=IsChecked}" />
    <Setter Property="HorizontalContentAlignment" Value="Stretch" />
    <Setter Property="VerticalContentAlignment" Value="Top" />
</Style>
 The ListView's IsEnabled property does change, if that matters. I wanted to somehow incorporate <SolidColorBrush x:Key="{x:Static SystemColors.ControlBrushKey}" Color="{x:Static SystemColors.HighlightColor}"/>, or something similar, to highlight selected ListViewItems that are in an unfocused ListView. I have the following style, but this does not seem to affect ListViewItems in my ListView, and I thought the GridView that I'm using might be the reason. When I tried to override the Template property, the View property got ignored so my GridView wasn't being displayed. <Style TargetType="ListViewItem">

@LINK:/questions/4193749/javascript-efficiently-compare-two-integer-arrays
@TITLE:Javascript: efficiently compare two integer arrays
@CONTENT:I have two integer arrays which contain numeric values. I want to look through both lists and check for commonality (or lack of) between the lists. I.e. I want to iterate through the array(s) and find those items which appear in both lists, while in a separate function I want to go through the arrays and find items which are in the first and not in the second. The obvious way of doing this is nested for loops: var containedInFirst = false;
for (var primaryID = 0; primaryID < PrimaryArray.length; primaryID++) {
        containedInFirst = false;
        for (var secondaryID = 0; secondaryID < SecondaryArray.length; secondaryID++) {
            if (PrimaryArray [primaryID] === SecondaryArray[secondaryID]) {
                containedInFirst = true;
                break;
            }
        }

//Do some more stuff based on the value of containedInFirst here
}
 But given the lists could contain hundreds or thousands of records this is quite a bit of itteration and processor intensive. I was therefore wondering if there is a more efficient way of executing the above code? Not just the actual searching, but something more efficient than an Integer array as the container for the values, or just not using nested for loops to traverse and compare the content. Any thoughts on more efficient or elegant solutions?
@CODE:var containedInFirst = false;
for (var primaryID = 0; primaryID < PrimaryArray.length; primaryID++) {
        containedInFirst = false;
        for (var secondaryID = 0; secondaryID < SecondaryArray.length; secondaryID++) {
            if (PrimaryArray [primaryID] === SecondaryArray[secondaryID]) {
                containedInFirst = true;
                break;
            }
        }

@TITLE:How to write parallel code with Haskell vectors?
@CONTENT:One one hand, in Haskell Vector a seems to be the preferred type to use as an array of numbers. There is even an (incomplete) Vector Tutorial. On the other hand, Control.Parallel.Strategies are defined mostly in terms of Traversable. Vector library doesn't provide these instances. The minimal complete definition of Traversable t should also define Foldable and traverse :: Applicative f => (a -> f b) -> t a -> f (t b)
sequenceA :: Applicative f => t (f a) -> f (t a)
 I don't see how sequenceA can be defined for Data.Vector.Unboxed.Vector. So, what is the best approach to writing parallel code with unboxed vectors? Defining some new ad hoc strategies like evalVector or using par and pseq explicitly or using plain Data.Array instead of vectors? P.S. Plain Arrays are parallelizable without problems: https://gist.github.com/701888
@CODE:Vector a Control.Parallel.Strategies Traversable Traversable t Foldable traverse :: Applicative f => (a -> f b) -> t a -> f (t b)
sequenceA :: Applicative f => t (f a) -> f (t a) sequenceA Data.Vector.Unboxed.Vector evalVector par pseq Data.Array Array rseq V.concat vLen - half vLen - 1

 What I'm attempting is to have a listview, that is populated by custom list items, each list item has multiple views and each view has an onclick listener attached. When this onClickListener is pressed it sends a Message to a Handler with a what and arg1 arguments. Clicking one of my elements fires an intent to start a new activity. Clicking the other shows a toast. When these are pressed in a combination I get the error above. Namely clicking the text to fire the intent, ( then press back) then clicking the image to show the toast, then when you click the text to fire the intent again I get the FC. I have created a demo project that reproduces this: http://rapidshare.com/files/429227042/HandlerTest.rar And here is the code below, I tried to remove as much cruft as I could to get to the bones of the error: If you want to skip to whats important look at the onClickListener's in ConversationAdapter.class and how they interact with StartPage.class Android Manifest: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

@TITLE:Why is the pattern to update UI from a different thread not built into the .NET framework?
@CONTENT:I know "why is my this framework like/not like xyz?" questions are a bit dangerous but I want to see what I'm missing. In WinForms, you can't update the UI from another thread. Most people use this pattern: private void EventHandler(object sender, DirtyEventArgs e)
{
    if (myControl.InvokeRequired)
        myControl.Invoke(new MethodInvoker(MethodToUpdateUI), e);
    else
        MethodToUpdateUI(e);
}

private void MethodToUpdateUI(object obj) 
{
    // Update UI
}
 and more clever still is this pattern: public static TResult SafeInvoke(this T isi, Func call) where T : ISynchronizeInvoke
{
    if (isi.InvokeRequired) { 
        IAsyncResult result = isi.BeginInvoke(call, new object[] { isi }); 
        object endResult = isi.EndInvoke(result); return (TResult)endResult; 
    }
    else
        return call(isi);
}

public static void SafeInvoke(this T isi, Action call) where T : ISynchronizeInvoke
{
    if (isi.InvokeRequired)
        isi.BeginInvoke(call, new object[] { isi });
    else
        call(isi);
}
 Regardless of which is used though, everyone has to write boilerplate code to handle this incredibly common problem. Why then, has the .NET Framework not been updated to do this for us? Is it that this area of the codebase is frozen? Is it a concern that it would break backwards compatibility? Is it a concern about the confusion when some code works one way in version N and a different way in version N+1?
@CODE:private void EventHandler(object sender, DirtyEventArgs e)
{
    if (myControl.InvokeRequired)
        myControl.Invoke(new MethodInvoker(MethodToUpdateUI), e);

@LINK:/questions/3981498/selenium-page-object-reuse
@TITLE:Selenium Page Object Reuse
@CONTENT:I really like how selenium 2 by convention pushes you towards using PageObjects as POJOs, and then simply using the PageFactory to instantiate the fields in this class. What I am finding limiting is that we reuse a lot of elements on many different pages. The big problem is that these reused components do not have the same id / name when they appear on different pages; however the tests we would run for each of them is the same. As an example we collect dates in many places. So an example page object for this could be (month, day fields removed): public class DatePageObject {
    private WebDriver driver;

    DatePageObject(WebDriver driver) {
        this.driver = driver;
    }

    @FindBy( id = "someIdForThisInstance")
    private WebElement year;

    public void testYearNumeric() {
        this.year.sendKeys('aa');
        this.year.submit();
        //Logic to determine Error message shows up
    }
}
 Then I could simply test this with the code below: public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
         WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();
         DatePageObject dpo = PageFactory.initElements(driver, DriverPageObject.class);
         driver.get("Some URL");
         dpo.testYearNumeric();
    }
}
 What I'd really like to do is have a setup whereby with Spring I can inject that id/name/xpath, etc... into the application. Is there a way I can do this, without losing the ability to utilize the PageFactory? Edit 1 -- Adding ideal base level classes, working on Custom Locators and Factories. public class PageElement {
    private WebElement element;
    private How how;
    private String using;

    PageElement(How how, String using) {
        this.how = how;
        this.using = using;
    }
    //Getters and Setters
}


public class PageWidget {
    private List<PageElement> widgetElements;
}


public class Screen {
    private List<PageWidget> fullPage;
    private WebDriver driver;

    public Screen(WebDriver driver) {
        this.driver = driver;
        for (PageWidget pw : fullPage) {
            CustomPageFactory.initElements(driver, pw.class);
        }
}
 Edit 2 -- Just as a note, as long as you are running Selenium 2.0.a5 or greater, you can now give the driver an implicit timeout value. So you can replace your code with: private class CustomElementLocator implements ElementLocator {
    private WebDriver driver;
    private int timeOutInSeconds;
    private final By by;


    public CustomElementLocator(WebDriver driver, Field field,
            int timeOutInSeconds) {
        this.driver = driver;
        this.timeOutInSeconds = timeOutInSeconds;
        CustomAnnotations annotations = new CustomAnnotations(field);
        this.by = annotations.buildBy();
        driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(15, TimeUnit.SECONDS); //Set this value in a more realistic place
    }


    public WebElement findElement() {
        return driver.findElement(by);
    }
}
@CODE:public class DatePageObject {
    private WebDriver driver;

    DatePageObject(WebDriver driver) {
        this.driver = driver;
    }

    @FindBy( id = "someIdForThisInstance")
    private WebElement year;

    public void testYearNumeric() {
        this.year.sendKeys('aa');
        this.year.submit();
        //Logic to determine Error message shows up
    }
} public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
         WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();
         DatePageObject dpo = PageFactory.initElements(driver, DriverPageObject.class);
         driver.get("Some URL");
         dpo.testYearNumeric();
    }
} public class PageElement {
    private WebElement element;
    private How how;
    private String using;

    PageElement(How how, String using) {
        this.how = how;
        this.using = using;
    }
    //Getters and Setters
}


public class PageWidget {

public class Screen {

@LINK:/questions/3977508/recurring-event-logic
@TITLE:recurring event logic
@CONTENT:I'm working on a Groovy/Java calendar-type application that allows the user to enter events with a start date and an optional recurrence. If it's a recurring event, it may recurr: monthly on a date of the month that corresponds to the start date weekly on a day of the week of that corresponds to the start date every 2 weeks on a day of the week of that corresponds to the start date etc. I originally planned on using the Google calendar API to do all the recurrence logic, but it proved to be an enormous PITA, for reasons I'll discuss further if anyone cares. So now, I've decided to roll my own solution. Given a date, I want to figure out whether a recurring event occurs on this date. My logic (in pseudocode) will be as follows: public boolean occursOnDate(def date, def event) {

  def firstDate = event.startDate

  if (firstDate > date) {
    return false;

  } else if (event.isWeekly()) {
    return event.dayOfWeek() == date.dayOfWeek()

  } else if (event.isMonthly()) {
    return event.dayOfMonth() == date.dayOfMonth()

  } else {
    // At this point we know the event occurs every X weeks where X > 1
    // Increment firstDate by adding X weeks to it as many times as possible, without
    // going past date
    return firstDate == date
  }  
}
 This logic seems reasonable, but will actually be quite a lot of effort to implement when you consider all the weird edge cases (e.g. how to handle a monthly recurring event in February whose first occurrence is Jan 31). Is there a library that can take help me to implement this? Some specifics would be much appreciated (e.g. no credit will be awarded for "Use Joda Time"). Thanks, Don

@CONTENT:I am making a little library(DLL) to manage users and their roles/privileges. The plan is to be able to add this dll to an MVC project and be able to manipulate users/roles/etc. All the data resides in a SQL db. I am using entity framework for data access. So when I initialize a new RoleManager(this is the name of the main class in the lib I'm making) I supply it with a connectionString like so: RoleManager roleManager = new RoleManager(string connectionString);
 Then inside the constructor I do this: db = new RoleManagerEntities(connectionString); //This is the EntityFramework
 And I am trying to supply this connection string (among many others) "metadata=res://*/RoleManager.csdl|res://*/RoleManager.ssdl|res://*/RoleManager.msl;provider=System.Data.SqlClient;provider connection string='Data Source=localhost;Initial Catalog=Login;Integrated Security=True;Connection Timeout=60; multipleactiveresultsets=true'"
 And I get the following error: The specified named connection is either not found in the configuration, not intended to be used with the EntityClient provider, or not valid.
 This question is a result of having trying to instantiate the EF from my new project without supplying a connection string and without having anything inside my app config for it to default to. Too bad I can't delete it now.

There are also some methods that sort by sounds, but this seems less common. I've tried using: perl -e 'print join(" ", sort qw(¤u µM ¤@ ¤H ¤T ¥j ¤G )), "\n";'
# Prints: ¤@ ¤T ¤G ¤H ¥j ¤u µM which is incorrect
 And I've tried using Unicode::Collate from CPAN, but it says: By default, CJK Unified Ideographs are ordered in Unicode codepoint order... If I could get a database of stroke count per character, I could easily sort all of the characters, but this doesn't seem to come with Perl nor is it encapsulated in any module I could find. If you know how to sort CJK in other languages, it would be helpful to mention it in an answer to this question.
@CODE:perl -e 'print join(" ", sort qw(¤u µM ¤@ ¤H ¤T ¥j ¤G )), "\n";'
# Prints: ¤@ ¤T ¤G ¤H ¥j ¤u µM which is incorrect

@TITLE:Emulating namespaces in Fortran 90
@CONTENT:One of the most troublesome issues with Fortran 90 is the lack of namespacing. In this previous question "How do you use Fortran 90 module data" from Pete, it has been discussed the main issue of USE behaving like a "from module import *" in Python: everything that is declared public in the module is imported as-is within the scope of the importing module. No prefixing. This makes very, very hard to understand, while reading some code, where a given identifier comes from, and if a given module is still used or not. A possible solution, discussed in the question I linked above, is to use the ONLY keyword to both limit the imported identifiers and document where they come from, although this is very, very tedious when the module is very large. Keeping the module small, and always using USE : ONLY is a potentially good strategy to work around the lack of namespacing and qualifying prefixes in Fortran 9X. Are there other (not necessarily better) workaround strategies? Does the Fortran 2k3 standard say anything regarding namespacing support?

}
 When I tried to catch by value or by (const) lvalue ref. the compiler says these cases are already handled by the rvalue ref catch clause, which is understandable, as an exception is an xvalue and perhaps the best way to catch an xvalue is an rvalue ref (correct me if I'm wrong). But can someone explain about the perfect forwarding in the above case of exception creation? Is it correct? Even though it compiles, is it meaningful or useful? Should the C++ library I use have a move constructor implemented for its std::exception for this kind of usage to be truly meaningful? I tried searching for articles and SO questions on rvalue references with respect to exceptions, couldn't find any.

@TITLE:jQuery UI Dialog + Validate
@CONTENT:I'm having trouble in validating a jQuery UI dialog using Jquery Validate upon clicking Save. Here's my code to create Jquery dialog. It loads the dialog from a target a href URL: $(document).ready(dialogForms);

function dialogForms() {
  $('a.dialog-form').click(function() {
    var a = $(this);
    $.get(a.attr('href'),function(resp){
      var dialog = $('<div>').attr('id','formDialog').html($(resp).find('form:first').parent('div').html());
      $('body').append(dialog);
      dialog.find(':submit').hide();
      dialog.find('#return').hide();
      dialog.dialog({
        title: a.attr('title') ? a.attr('title') : '',
        modal: true,
        buttons: {
          'Save': function() {submitFormWithAjax($(this).find('form'));},
          'Cancel': function() {$(this).dialog('close');}
        },
        close: function() {$(this).remove();},
        width: 'auto'
      });
    }, 'html');
    return false;
  });
}

function submitFormWithAjax(form) {
    form = $(form);
    $.ajax({
        beforeSend: function(data) {
            //alert("beforesend");
            form.validate();
        },
        url: form.attr('action'),
        data: form.serialize(),
        type: (form.attr('method')),
        dataType: 'text',
        error: function(data) {

        },
        success: function(data) {

            $('#result').html(data);
            setTimeout("reloadPage()", 500);
        }
    });
  return false;
}
 The beforeSend is called, but it doesn't seem to call the validate method, which is located on the parent page from which Dialog is called.         $(document).ready(function() {
            $("#event_form").validate({
                rules: {
                    Name: {

                },
                submitHandler: function(form) {
                    alert("validated");
                    //                    $('#loading_1').show();
                    //                    $('#proceed_c').hide();
                    //                    $(form).ajaxSubmit();

                    error.appendTo(element.next(".status"));
                }
            });

}

    def main(args: Array[String]) {

    }
}
 This works, but I need to type the Some(42) as Option[Int], else the implicit object OptionBar won't be resolved (because a Bar[Some] is expected instead). Is there a way to avoid the explicit typing, so that I get the implicit OptionBar object in test even if I feed test with a Some or None? [Clarification] I used Option here just as example, it should also work if I have a Bar for an abstract class etc. The solution should also work when other, unrelated Bars are in scope, say implicit object listBar extends Bar[list] [Update] It seems that making Bar's parameter contravariant does the trick: object foo {

  trait Bar[-Q[_]] //<---------------

  implicit object OptionBar extends Bar[Option]
  implicit object ListBar extends Bar[List]

  def test[T, C[_]](c: C[T])(implicit bar: Bar[C]) = ()

 But of course this is a severe limitation of the possibilities in Bar, so I still hope for a better answer.

@CONTENT:I am trying to run a Jar file in the backend of my php code.But I am not getting the desired output to it.There is a jar file which runs in the background and returns the Page Rank of any of the keyword and Domain given to it. I am attaching the code,please suggest me any solution to it,because when I run it on the terminal,it is giving correct output. Here is the Code :     <?php
set_time_limit(0);
function returnJarPath()
{
    $jarPath = $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . "myFolder/tools_new/includes/Rank.jar";
    return $jarPath;
}
$jar = returnJarPath();
$command = "java -jar $jar aspdotnet/microsoft.com";//Passing the Argument to the Jar file.


$shellOutput = shell_exec($command);
    print "The Shell Output is : " ; var_dump($shellOutput);print "<br />";
exec($command,$executeCommmand);
    print "The Exec returns the value : " ; var_dump($executeCommmand);print "<br />";
passthru($command,$passthruCommand);
    print "The Passthru returns the value : " . $passthruCommand. "<br />";
?>
 I just checked apache's error log and the last error I found was : sh: java: command not found But as I have already said,I have been using the same command through SSH to run the Java command.So there's no such possibility of not having JAVA installed on the server.Please help me out of this mess...

 The fields invites and sentinvites are both integers but are set to 0 after the function is run. This makes me presume that CodeIgniter is passing invites-1 and sentinvites+1 as strings, but I thought appending FALSE to the end stopped it doing that? Thanks! Jack

@TITLE:Generating ID unique to a particular computer [duplicate]
@CONTENT:Possible Duplicate: Reliable way of generating unique hardware ID Am trying to generate an ID that will be unique to a particular computer. The ID will not be generated randomly. It will be calculation based, such that the ID generated for computer A will be fixed and unique to computer A. Everytime the program is executed on computer A, it will continue to generate the same ID and when executed on another computer, it will generate another ID unique to that computer. This is to ensure that two computers don't have the same ID. My Challenge: For my program to be able to generate an ID unique to a computer, it needs to perform the calculation based on a seed unique to the computer executing it. My Question: How can i get a value unique to a computer, so that i can use the value as a seed in the ID generation program? Is it possible to get a value from a computer's hardware(eg motherboard) that is unique to that computer? That way, the value is most likely not to change as long as the computer's motherboard is not replaced.

@CONTENT:I'm trying to implement a jQuery slider control for opacity of a certain element on my web page. Kind of like this question but with a slider. I was wondering how I should implement this best, as I'm a little lost as how I should get started... I'm guessing a function wouldn't be the best, would it? Defining a function and then calling it for the slider?

@CONTENT:I'm trying to edit the 'onchange' event of an existent 'select' element. For example purposes I have the following code: <select id="sel_id" onchange="javascript:foo();" >
 and whenever I try to change its 'onchange' attribute I was using the following: $("#sel_id").attr("onchange", "foo_2()");
 FYI, this code which should be fine doesn't work, the 'onchange' attribute remains unchanged. So how should you edit it? AMMENDMENT: You can remove the attribute and then bind a different function like: $("#sel_id").removeAttr("onchange").bind("change", function(){ foo_2(); });   
 but the issue remains, is it possible to change the 'onchange' attribute without removing it in the first place?

 Is this possible? Also if the arguments are not defined how do i handle that? For example if one call to the function has several callbacks defined and another only has one is there a way of handling the lack of presence of callbacks. Cheers, :)

@CONTENT:I thought I was familiar with the applications custom schemes used with iOS to trigger applications from my app but I'm unable to use the ones that seems to be provided by the official twitter app (aka tweetie). I'm trying to open the twitter application directly to a predefined user profile. From the documentation found here http://handleopenurl.com/scheme/twitter this should be feasible, but this code doesn't work :/ : [[UIApplication sharedApplication] openURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"twitter://user?id=41553213"]]; I also tried with tweetie:// but the same happens : the application launches, but does not "jump" to the given user profile. Actually, if I try any of the other examples, I don't get anything working :( 
twitter://messages
twitter://mentions
 none of them are working :( Any idea why none of those invocations are working ? Thanks. N.B:I'm using the last version of the twitter application under iOS 3.1.3 (iphone 3G)

@CONTENT:i have an HTML, that should be transformed, having some tags replaced with another tags. I don't know about these tags, because they will come from db. So, "set_attribute" or "name" methods of Nokogiri are not suiteable for me I need to do it, in a way, like in this pseudo-code: def preprocess_content
  doc = Nokogiri::HTML( self.content )
  doc.css("div.to-replace").each do |div|
    # "get_html_text" will obtain HTML from db. It can be anything, even another tags, tag groups etc.
    div.replace self.get_html_text
  end
  self.content = doc.css("body").first.inner_html
end
 I found "Nokogiri::XML::Node::replace" method. I think, it is a right direction. This method expects some "node_or_tags" parameter. Which method should i use to create a new Node from text and replace the current one with it ?
@CODE:def preprocess_content
  doc = Nokogiri::HTML( self.content )
  doc.css("div.to-replace").each do |div|
    # "get_html_text" will obtain HTML from db. It can be anything, even another tags, tag groups etc.

@TITLE:How do I call a method of a Java instance from JavaScript?
@CONTENT:I'm using the Mozilla Rhino JavaScript emulator. It allows me to add Java methods to a context and then call them as if they were JavaScript functions. But I can't get it to work except when I use a static method. The problem is this part of the documentation: If the method is not static, the Java 'this' value will correspond to the JavaScript 'this' value. Any attempt to call the function with a 'this' value that is not of the right Java type will result in an error. Apparently, my Java "this" value doesn't correspond with the one in JavaScript and I have no idea how to make them correspond. In the end, I'd like to create an instance in Java, and install a couple of methods from it in the global scope, so I can initialize the instance from Java but use it in my scripts. Does anyone have some example code for this?

@TITLE:How do I add an extra field using ASP.Net membership provider?
@CONTENT:I have a basic app using the ASP.NET membership provider. By default, you can use a few fields such as username, password, remember me. How do I add to the asp.net membership provider so I can add an additional field "address" in the register section and have it save to the database? I currently see the following when creating a user in the account model: public MembershipCreateStatus CreateUser(string userName, string password,
   string email)
{
   if (String.IsNullOrEmpty(userName))
   { throw new ArgumentException("Value cannot be null or empty.", "userName"); }
   if (String.IsNullOrEmpty(password))
   { throw new ArgumentException("Value cannot be null or empty.", "password"); }
   if (String.IsNullOrEmpty(email))
   { throw new ArgumentException("Value cannot be null or empty.", "email"); }

   MembershipCreateStatus status;
   _provider.CreateUser(userName, password, email, null, null, true,
       null, out status);

   return status;
}
 In the create user function, I also want to save the user's "address". In the register.aspx I added a the following: <div class="editor-label">
    <%: Html.LabelFor(m => m.Address) %>
</div>
<div class="editor-field">
    <%: Html.TextAreaFor(m => m.Address) %>
</div>
 Any ideas?
@CODE:public MembershipCreateStatus CreateUser(string userName, string password,
   string email)

   if (String.IsNullOrEmpty(userName))
   { throw new ArgumentException("Value cannot be null or empty.", "userName"); }

However, when I'm writing my test now (way too late, but better late than never right?!), I get this error thrown: "The application relative virtual path '~/Images/SortingArrowUp.png' cannot be made absolute, because the path to the application is not known."  var imgPath = VirtualPathUtility.ToAbsolute("~/Images/SortingArrowUp.png");

@TITLE:Floating point or fixed-point for Android NDK OpenGL apps?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to decide on whether to primarily use floats or ints for all 3D-related elements in my app (which is C++ for the most part). I understand that most ARM-based devices have no hardware floating point support, so I figure that any heavy lifting with floats would be noticeably slower. However, I'm planning to prep all data for the most part (i.e. have vertex buffers where applicable and transform using matrices that don't change a lot), so I'm just stuffing data down OpenGL's throat. Can I assume that this goes more or less straight to the GPU and will as such be reasonably fast? (Btw, the minimum requirement is OpenGL ES 2.0, so that presumably excludes older 1.x-based phones.) Also - how is the penalty when I mix and match ints and floats? Assuming that all my geometry is just pre-built float buffers, but I use ints for matrices since those do require expensive operations like matrix multiplications, how much wrath will I incur here? By the way, I know that I should keep my expectations low (sounds like even asking for floats on the CPU is asking for too much), but is there anything remotely like 128-bit VMX registers? (And I'm secretly hoping that fadden is reading this question and has an awesome answer.)

But I have some questions regarding calling notify() on this object by another thread: (when) will the waiting thread wake up, if another (a 3rd) thread owns the object monitor in the meanwhile? will the waiting thread wake up, if a 3rd thread called wait() on this object? is it possible to determine if a thread is waiting for notifying a particular object (java 1.4/java 5) What's happening if wait() will be called in the finalize() method?

@LINK:/questions/3170857/app-hangs-on-restart-with-latest-flurry-sdk-and-ios4
@TITLE:App hangs on restart with latest Flurry SDK and ios4
@CONTENT:I have a frustrating problem with the latest version of Flurry (Flurry iPhone SDK v2.5). When I start my app, quickly exit, then restart the App, the app briefly loads, flickers a black screen, then stays on the black screen. The black screen stays there until I press the home button, at which point I can restart the app normally. I looked into this further, and it turns out that app state delegates are getting called in the wrong order: applicationDidBecomeActive //app finishes loading the first time applicationWillResignActive //app begins to resign applicationWillEnterForeground //At this point, I have quickly restarted the app, and this is called applicationDidEnterBackground //When this delegate is called, the screen goes black applicationDidEnterBackground //This gets called when I hit the home button again, after the screen has been hanging for a while. So what I think this means is some processes take a bit longer to wrap up once I hit the home button, and if I try to start the app again too quickly there is some very odd behavior. If I wait a few seconds to restart the app, the app behaves normally. To demonstrate this problem, I created the simplest app I could think of, which I will post here. I built this with XCode 3.2.3, in the 4.0 build directly onto my iphone device (iphone 4). This is important, because I couldn't reproduce this problem on the simulator. You can reproduce this app by creating a new navigation based project named simpleApp, and dropping this code in, with your own Flurry API key of course. Here is simpleAppAppDelegate.m: #import "simpleAppAppDelegate.h"
#import "RootViewController.h"
#import "FlurryAPI.h"


@implementation simpleAppAppDelegate

@synthesize window;
@synthesize navigationController;


- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {    
    [FlurryAPI startSession:@"<your api key here>"];    

    [window addSubview:navigationController.view];
    [window makeKeyAndVisible];

    return YES;
}


- (void)applicationWillResignActive:(UIApplication *)application {
    printf("applicationWillResignActive\n");
}


- (void)applicationDidEnterBackground:(UIApplication *)application {
    printf("applicationDidEnterBackground\n");
}


- (void)applicationWillEnterForeground:(UIApplication *)application {
    printf("applicationWillEnterForeground\n");
}


- (void)applicationDidBecomeActive:(UIApplication *)application {
    printf("applicationDidBecomeActive\n");
}


- (void)applicationWillTerminate:(UIApplication *)application {
    printf("applicationWillTerminate\n");
}

- (void)applicationDidReceiveMemoryWarning:(UIApplication *)application {
}

- (void)dealloc {
    [navigationController release];
    [window release];
    [super dealloc];
}

@end
 And here is simpleAppAppDelegate.h: #import <UIKit/UIKit.h>

@interface simpleAppAppDelegate : NSObject <UIApplicationDelegate> {

    UIWindow *window;
    UINavigationController *navigationController;
}

@property (nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet UIWindow *window;
@property (nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet UINavigationController *navigationController;

@end
 So anyway, because so many apps are using Flurry I feel like I must be missing something very basic. What really boggles my mind is that I haven't found anyone at all complaining about this particular problem. Also, this is different from the problem in previous versions where the app would appear to start immediately, go black for a few seconds, then resume normally. That problem was solved by calling [FlurryAPI setSessionReportsOnCloseEnabled:false]; after I set the session, but that doesn't help in this case. Anyway, has anyone else had this problem? I really hope it's just a stupid error on my part. I'm really excited to use Flurry but something like this would cause my app to get rejected.
@CODE:#import "simpleAppAppDelegate.h"
#import "RootViewController.h"
#import "FlurryAPI.h"


@implementation simpleAppAppDelegate

@synthesize window;
@synthesize navigationController;


- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {    
    [FlurryAPI startSession:@"<your api key here>"];    

    [window addSubview:navigationController.view];
    [window makeKeyAndVisible];

    return YES;
}


- (void)applicationWillResignActive:(UIApplication *)application {
    printf("applicationWillResignActive\n");
}


- (void)applicationDidEnterBackground:(UIApplication *)application {
    printf("applicationDidEnterBackground\n");
}


- (void)applicationWillEnterForeground:(UIApplication *)application {
    printf("applicationWillEnterForeground\n");
}


- (void)applicationDidBecomeActive:(UIApplication *)application {
    printf("applicationDidBecomeActive\n");
}


- (void)applicationWillTerminate:(UIApplication *)application {
    printf("applicationWillTerminate\n");
}

- (void)applicationDidReceiveMemoryWarning:(UIApplication *)application {
}

- (void)dealloc {
    [navigationController release];
    [window release];
    [super dealloc];
}

@CONTENT:We are considering switching our VCS to either git or subversion. I'd prefer switching to git, but subversion has a nice feature that I don't see in git : per directory access control. We currently have project1, project2 repositories in cvs, with different permissions. We'd like to have one single repository, with two directories project1 & project2 with different permissions. Is it doable with git as it is with svn ? I'm aware of submodules, which could probably achieve that, but the goal for us is to be able to do one single commit with changes in project1 & project2. We mainly have IP issues, and want to be sure that some people can't read (not just push) some directories. So, is git up for the challenge or will I have to use git-svn ? Thanks

 The application has permissions android.permission.READ_CONTACTS and android.permission.WRITE_CONTACTS. The phone shows a contact with the name but no phone (incidentally, adding the phone to that contact using the normal UI results in a new contact being added, with name and phone, and the old contact with name only staying). Any idea why the third insert (the second in the Data table) fails, while the 2 previous ones (1 in RawContacts and 1 in Data) succeed?

 Update I received the following answer: foo is Nothing simply checks if foo is not assigned to any reference. foo = Nothing checks if the reference held by foo is equal to nothing. After running the three statements, Dim foo as Object
Dim bar as Integer
foo = bar
 foo is Nothing evaluates to false and foo = Nothing evaluates to true. However, if bar is declared as an Object and not initialized, then foo is Nothing and foo = Nothing both evaluate to true! I think this is because Integer is a value type and Object is a reference type.
@CODE:if foo is Nothing Then
      doStuff()
End If if foo=Nothing Then
    doStuff()
End If foo is Nothing foo foo = Nothing foo nothing Dim foo as Object

@TITLE:In C/C++, are volatile variables guaranteed to have eventually consistent semantics betwen threads?
@CONTENT:Is there any guarantee by any commonly followed standard (ISO C or C++, or any of the POSIX/SUS specifications) that a variable (perhaps marked volatile), not guarded by a mutex, that is being accessed by multiple threads will become eventually consistent if it is assigned to? To provide a specific example, consider two threads sharing a variable v, with initial value zero. Thread 1: v = 1 Thread 2: while(v == 0) yield(); Is thread 2 guaranteed to terminate eventually? Or can it conceivably spin forever because the cache coherency never kicks in and makes the assignment visible in thread 2's cache? I'm aware the C and C++ standards (before C++0x) do not speak at all about threads or concurrency. But I'm curious if the C++0x memory model, or pthreads, or anything else, guarantees this. (Apparently this does actually work on Windows on 32-bit x86; I'm wondering if it's something that can be relied on generally or if it just happens to work there).

@TITLE:Authentication/Session cookie deleting after browser close
@CONTENT:What are the exact steps required for a cookie to persist after a browser is closed? At the moment I have: createPersistentCookie set to true on LoggedIn event. MachineKey specified. Forms sliding expiration set to true. As long as the browser is open, the user will stay logged in, but as soon as it's closed, and it doesn't matter for how long, the user will need to log in again. What am I missing? EDIT: I went through the article pointed out by marapet (see comments below) and it made me interested in whether the ticket does indeed have IsPersistent flag, which it does. The decrypted ticket looks like this: System.Web.Security.FormsAuthentication.Decrypt(Request.Cookies[System.Web.Security.FormsAuthentication.FormsCookieName].Value) {System.Web.Security.FormsAuthenticationTicket} CookiePath: "/" Expiration: {19/08/2010 17:27:14} Expired: false IsPersistent: true IssueDate: {19/07/2010 17:27:14} Name: "alex" UserData: "" Version: 2 All the details are correct, and correspond to those I set in LoggedIn event. More over the cookie value I can retrieve from the cookie directly, is identical to this one. Yet as soon as I close the browser, the cookie is lost. What I have noticed, however, is that the cookie carrying the ticket has it's date reset for some reason. Firstly I can't override settings in web.config, so at the end of LoggedIn event it's Expires property is 4000 minutes after issue date, not a month which I am setting programmatically. Then after page load the cookie I retrieve with FormsAuthentication.FormsCookieName has Expires property of 01/01/0001. I think perhaps this is where the problem lies? Any thoughts would be appreciated. EDIT#2: I am changing both title and tags to include session, as it turned out to be relevant for the problem/solution
@CODE:createPersistentCookie true LoggedIn true System.Web.Security.FormsAuthentication.Decrypt(Request.Cookies[System.Web.Security.FormsAuthentication.FormsCookieName].Value) {System.Web.Security.FormsAuthenticationTicket} CookiePath: "/" Expiration: {19/08/2010 17:27:14} Expired: false IsPersistent: true IssueDate: {19/07/2010 17:27:14} Name: "alex" UserData: "" Version: 2

@TITLE:How to refresh a UITableViewController or NSFetchedResultsController?
@CONTENT:I have a little problem with my UITableViewController or NSFetchedResultsController. I am not sure which is the problem soure but I guess its the UITableViewController. As I said I use a NSFetchedResultsController to fill my data into a UITableViewController. The data is sorted by date and is also displayed in sections by date-year, e.g. May 2010/June 2010/ and so on. This is displayed as the section header. Now when I add new data, it automatically uses the current date as default, but if I want to use a date, that is currently not in the section list, e.g. April 2010 (currently May and June in the list), then this is not displayed correctly. Only when I quit the app and start it again it will show the new section headers and everything is fine. So I somehow need to be able to refresh my list or update it. By just adding it to the context and changing it does not seem to update it. Again, I am not sure what I need to update, if it is my NSFetchedResultsController object or the UITableViewController. UPDATE #1: I just figured that there is an exception in this method : - (void)controllerDidChangeContent:(NSFetchedResultsController *)controller 
{
    // The fetch controller has sent all current change notifications, so tell the table view to process all updates.
    [self.tableView endUpdates];

}
 This is where I move the data : - (void)controller:(NSFetchedResultsController *)controller didChangeObject:(id)anObject atIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath forChangeType:(NSFetchedResultsChangeType)type newIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)newIndexPath 
{

    UITableView *tableView = self.tableView;

    switch(type) 
    {

        case NSFetchedResultsChangeInsert:
            [tableView insertRowsAtIndexPaths:[NSArray arrayWithObject:newIndexPath] withRowAnimation:UITableViewRowAnimationFade];
            break;

        case NSFetchedResultsChangeDelete:
            [tableView deleteRowsAtIndexPaths:[NSArray arrayWithObject:indexPath] withRowAnimation:UITableViewRowAnimationFade];
            break;

        case NSFetchedResultsChangeUpdate:
        //  [self configureCell:[tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:indexPath] atIndexPath:indexPath];

            break;

        case NSFetchedResultsChangeMove:
            [tableView deleteRowsAtIndexPaths:[NSArray arrayWithObject:indexPath] withRowAnimation:UITableViewRowAnimationFade];
            // Reloading the section inserts a new row and ensures that titles are updated appropriately.
            [tableView reloadSections:[NSIndexSet indexSetWithIndex:newIndexPath.section] withRowAnimation:UITableViewRowAnimationFade];
            break;
    }

}
 This method is pretty much taken from the CoreDataBooks example from Apple. And this is the error : Serious application error. An exception was caught from the delegate of NSFetchedResultsController during a call to -controllerDidChangeContent:. * -[NSMutableArray removeObjectAtIndex:]: index 1 beyond bounds [0 .. 0] with userInfo (null) And after that, the edit mode (where the delete button appears) does not work anymore. Thanks.

@CONTENT:I am adding <script type="text/javascript" src="http://somedomain/somescript.js"> to the document head via jQuery. This is the code I use: $(document).ready(function () {
    var s = document.createElement("script");
    s.type = "text/javascript";
    s.src = (document.location.protocol == "https:" ? "https://ssl" : "http://www") + ".google-analytics.com/ga.js";
    $("head").append(s);
});
 While the script seems to be working perfectly, I do not see the scripts in the head when I use FireBug to inspect document head. This snippet does not show the added script(s) either: $('script[src]').each(function(){
    console.log(this.src);
});
 Is this normal or am I doing something wrong here? What bothers me is the fact that I see other scripts in the head section that were lazy/dynamically loaded but not those that I added. Also wondering if it is OK to load scripts that manipulate DOM in the document ready function. UPDATE Replacing the code from: $("head").append(s);
 to document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(s);
 fixes the problem. The resulting DOM appears correctly in FireBug and jQuery correctly returns the script tags that were added static/dynamically.
@CODE:<script type="text/javascript" src="http://somedomain/somescript.js"> $(document).ready(function () {
    var s = document.createElement("script");
    s.type = "text/javascript";
    s.src = (document.location.protocol == "https:" ? "https://ssl" : "http://www") + ".google-analytics.com/ga.js";
    $("head").append(s);
}); $('script[src]').each(function(){
    console.log(this.src);
}); $("head").append(s); document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(s); <script> $.append eval $.getScript $(document.head).append(s);

I am having problem ie:-- when user is clicking on questions pagination page 2. answers page are also updating. The reason is both is sending a post variable ie   params[:page]
 How to change this variable so that only one should be updated. and how to maintain that user should not lose the other page. ie he is on 3rd page of questions and 1st page of answers and now he click on 5th page of the questions the result should be 3rd page of questions and 5th page of answers.

@TITLE:Do cryptographic hashes provide really unique results?
@CONTENT:I was wondering whether md5, sha1 and anothers return unique values. For example, sha1() for test returns a94a8fe5ccb19ba61c4c0873d391e987982fbbd3, which is 40 characters long. So, sha1 for strings larger than 40 chars must be the same (of course it's scrambled, because the given input may contain whitespaces and special chars etc.). Due to this, when we are storing users' passwords, they can enter either their original password or some super-long one, which nobody knows. Is this right, or do these hash algorithms provide really unique results - I'm quite sure it's hardly possible.

@LINK:/questions/3036563/how-to-assign-wpf-resources-to-other-resource-tags
@TITLE:How to assign WPF resources to other resource tags
@CONTENT:This is quite obscure, I may just be missing something extremely simple. Scenario 1 Lets say I create a gradient brush, like this in my <Window.Resources> section: <LinearGradientBrush x:Key="GridRowSelectedBackBrushGradient" StartPoint="0,0" EndPoint="0,1">
    <GradientStop Color="#404040" Offset="0.0" />
    <GradientStop Color="#404040" Offset="0.5" />
    <GradientStop Color="#000000" Offset="0.6" />
    <GradientStop Color="#000000" Offset="1.0" />
</LinearGradientBrush>
 Then much later on, I want to override the HighlightBrushKey for a DataGrid. I have basically done it like this (horrible); <LinearGradientBrush x:Key="{x:Static SystemColors.HighlightBrushKey}"
                     GradientStops="{Binding Source={StaticResource GridRowSelectedBackBrushGradient}, Path=GradientStops}"
                     StartPoint="{Binding Source={StaticResource GridRowSelectedBackBrushGradient}, Path=StartPoint}"
                     EndPoint="{Binding Source={StaticResource GridRowSelectedBackBrushGradient}, Path=EndPoint}" />
 This is obviously not the most slick way of referencing a resource. I also came up with the following problem, which is almost identical. Scenario 2 Say I created two colors in my <Window.Resources> markup, like so: <SolidColorBrush x:Key="DataGridRowBackgroundBrush" Color="#EAF2FB" />
<SolidColorBrush x:Key="DataGridRowBackgroundAltBrush" Color="#FFFFFF" />
 Then later on, I want to supply them in an Array, which feeds the ConverterParameter on a Binding so I can supply the custom Converter with my static resource instances: <Setter Property="Background">
    <Setter.Value>
        <Binding RelativeSource="{RelativeSource Mode=Self}" 
                 Converter="{StaticResource BackgroundBrushConverter}">
            <Binding.ConverterParameter>
                <x:Array Type="{x:Type Brush}">
                    <SolidColorBrush Color="{Binding Source={StaticResource DataGridRowBackgroundBrush}, Path=Color}" />
                    <SolidColorBrush Color="{Binding Source={StaticResource DataGridRowBackgroundAltBrush}, Path=Color}" />
                </x:Array>
            </Binding.ConverterParameter>
        </Binding>
    </Setter.Value>
</Setter>
 What I've done is attempt to rereference an existing resource, but in my efforts I've actually recreated the resource, and bound the properties so they match. Again, this is not ideal. Because I've now hit this problem at least twice, is there a better way? Thanks, Tom

@LINK:/questions/3034474/storing-script-files-outside-web-root
@TITLE:Storing script files outside web root
@CONTENT:I've seen recommendations to store some or all php include files some place other than in the web document root directory (username/public_html in my case) for the specific reason of protecting php files with sensitive information (like database connection and login info) in the event that the web server hiccups and stops protecting php files and they become 'visible' to outsiders who know where to look. It seems somewhat paranoid to me, but I'm guessing people have gotten burned badly on this before so I'm willing to go along. The suggestion usually takes the form of having the include files in something like '../include_files/' so its not directly in the document root and not directly accessible to outsiders through the web server. My question is this: is there a significant difference in security between that way and just putting your 'include_files' directory under the document root and sticking an .htaccess file in there (with the appropriate entries)? Would putting an .htaccess file in '../include_files/' make any significant improvement there? TIA, Monte

@TITLE:How to use GWT when downloading Files with a Servlet?
@CONTENT:I am creating a simple project that will allow me to upload and download files using gwt. i am having trouble with the downloading of files that are on my server. For the file upload i used http://code.google.com/p/gwtupload/ and followed the instructions there. My file is stored on the server outside of the website container(on the hard drive), Now when it comes to the downloading of a file, i want a user to press a download button and whatever item is currently selected will download. i dont really know how this will be done i know i need a download servlet public class DownloadAttachmentServlet extends HttpServlet {

@Override
protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp)
        throws ServletException, IOException {
    // TODO Auto-generated method stub
    super.doGet(req, resp);
}

@Override
protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp)
        throws ServletException, IOException {

    String fileName = (String) req.getSession().getAttribute("fileName");

    YFUser user = (YFUser) req.getSession().getAttribute(TestServiceImpl.SESSION_USER);
    if (user == null)
        throw new ServletException("Invalid Session");

    InputStream in = null;
    OutputStream out = resp.getOutputStream();

    FileInputStream fIn = new FileInputStream(fileName);
    byte[] buffer = new byte[4096];
    int length;
    while ((length = in.read(buffer)) > 0){
        out.write(buffer, 0, length);
    }
    in.close();
    out.flush();

}
}
 for the moment i will just pass a fileName string to retrieve the file for testing now i am lost at what to do on the client side, i have a simple public class DownloadFilePanel extends Composite {


public DownloadFilePanel(final YFUser user , final String fileName){

    final Element downloadIframe = RootPanel.get("__download").getElement();

    VerticalPanel content = new VerticalPanel();
    content.add(new Label("Download For this File : " + fileName));

    Button button = new Button("Download");
    button.addClickHandler(new ClickHandler(){
        @Override
        public void onClick(ClickEvent event) {
            // i do not know what to do here
    });
            content.add(button);
    initWidget(content);


}


}
 above is a simple widget that will supply a panel that will allow for the download of a file based on a fileName as you can see above, i do not know what to do to be able to download the file is there any one that can point me in the right direction?

@TITLE:Fastest way to compute point to triangle distance in 3D?
@CONTENT:One obvious method for computing the minimum distance from a point to a 3D triangle is to project the point onto the plane of the triangle, determine the barycentric coordinates of the resulting point, and use them to determine whether the projected point lies within the triangle. If not, clamp its the barycentric coordinates to be in the range [0,1], and that gives you the closest point that lies inside the triangle. Is there a way to speed this up or simplify it somehow?

@TITLE:Why strings behave like ValueType
@CONTENT:I was perplexed after executing this piece of code, where strings seems to behave as if they are value types. I am wondering whether the assignment operator is operating on values like equality operator for strings. Here is the piece of code I did to test this behavior. using System;

namespace RefTypeDelimma
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            string a1, a2;

            a1 = "ABC";
            a2 = a1; //This should assign a1 reference to a2
            a2 = "XYZ";  //I expect this should change the a1 value to "XYZ"

            Console.WriteLine("a1:" + a1 + ", a2:" + a2);//Outputs a1:ABC, a2:XYZ
            //Expected: a1:XYZ, a2:XYZ (as string being a ref type)

            Proc(a2); //Altering values of ref types inside a procedure 
                      //should reflect in the variable thats being passed into

            Console.WriteLine("a1: " + a1 + ", a2: " + a2); //Outputs a1:ABC, a2:XYZ
            //Expected: a1:NEW_VAL, a2:NEW_VAL (as string being a ref type)
        }

        static void Proc(string Val)
        {
            Val = "NEW_VAL";
        }
    }
}
 In the above code if I use a custom classes instead of strings, I am getting the expected behavior. I doubt is this something to do with the string immutability? welcoming expert views on this.

            a2 = a1; //This should assign a1 reference to a2
            a2 = "XYZ";  //I expect this should change the a1 value to "XYZ"

            Console.WriteLine("a1:" + a1 + ", a2:" + a2);//Outputs a1:ABC, a2:XYZ

@TITLE:performSelector:withObject:afterDelay: not working from scrollViewDidZoom
@CONTENT:I feel like I should know this but I've been stumped for hours now and I've run out of ideas. The theory is simple, the user manipulates the zoom and positioning in a scrollview using a pinch. If they hold that pinch for a short period of time then the scrollview records the zoom level and content offsets. So I thought I'd start a performSelector:withObject:withDelay on the scrollViewDidZoom delegate method. If it expires then I record the settings. I delete the scheduled call every time scrollViewDidZoom is called and when the pinch gesture finishes. This is what I have: - (void)scrollViewDidZoom:(UIScrollView *)scrollView{
    NSLog(@"resetting timer");
    [NSObject cancelPreviousPerformRequestsWithTarget:self selector:@selector(positionLock) object:nil];

    [self performSelector:@selector(positionLock) withObject:nil afterDelay:0.4];               
}

-(void)positionLock{
    NSLog(@"position locked ");
}

- (void)scrollViewDidEndZooming:(UIScrollView *)scrollView withView:(UIView *)view atScale:(float)scale{

    NSLog(@"deleting timer");
    [NSObject cancelPreviousPerformRequestsWithTarget:self selector:@selector(positionLock) object:nil];
}
 This is the output: 2010-05-19 22:43:01.931 resetting timer 2010-05-19 22:43:01.964 resetting timer 2010-05-19 22:43:02.231 resetting timer 2010-05-19 22:43:02.253 resetting timer 2010-05-19 22:43:02.269 resetting timer 2010-05-19 22:43:02.298 resetting timer 2010-05-19 22:43:05.399 deleting timer As you can see the delay between the last and second last events should have been more than enough for the delayed selector call to execute. If I replace performSelector:withObject:withDelay with plain old performSelector: I get this: 2010-05-19 23:08:30.333 resetting timer 2010-05-19 23:08:30.333 position locked 2010-05-19 23:08:30.366 resetting timer 2010-05-19 23:08:30.367 position locked 2010-05-19 23:08:30.688 deleting timer Which isn't what I want but serves to show that it's only the delay that's causing it to not function, not something to do with the selector not being declared in the header, being misspelt or any other reason. Any ideas as to why it's not working?
@CODE:- (void)scrollViewDidZoom:(UIScrollView *)scrollView{
    NSLog(@"resetting timer");
    [NSObject cancelPreviousPerformRequestsWithTarget:self selector:@selector(positionLock) object:nil];

As in if a certain amount of requests are made per a certain amount of time then block the IP address or something. I thought there maybe a htaccess solution if not, I will write a PHP one. Any ideas or links to existing methods or scripts is much appreciated.

@TITLE:What's the difference between logical SSE intrinsics?
@CONTENT:Is there any difference between logical SSE intrinsics for different types? For example if we take OR operation, there are three intrinsics: _mm_or_ps, _mm_or_pd and _mm_or_si128 all of which do the same thing: compute bitwise OR of their operands. My questions: Is there any difference between using one or another intrinsic (with appropriate type casting). Won't there be any hidden costs like longer execution in some specific situation? These intrinsics maps to three different x86 instructions (por, orps, orpd). Does anyone have any ideas why Intel is wasting precious opcode space for several instructions which do the same thing?

@TITLE:Loading Properties with Spring (via System Properties)
@CONTENT:My problem is as follows: I have server.properties for different environments. The path to those properties is provided trough a system property called propertyPath. How can I instruct my applicationContext.xml to load the properties with the given propertyPath system property without some ugly MethodInvokingBean which calls System.getProperty(''); My applicationContext.xml <bean id="systemPropertyConfigurer" class="org.springframework.beans.factory.config.PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer">

 with this configuration the propertyResource alsways complains about java.io.FileNotFoundException: sys{propertyPath} (The system cannot find the file specified)
 Any suggestions? ;-) Thanks gabe EDIT: Now I debugged the loading process of the beans and it seems the setLocation Method of the propertyConfigurer is called before the systemPropertyConfigurer is created so the propertyResource is initialized with "sys{propertyPath}". I played around with depends-on but no luck.

@CONTENT:For a web service I'm developing I would like my embedded code (on the client's site) to fetch an xml file from my sever script which resides on my domain. As this is a cross-domain request I figured to use jsonp as it seems the de facto standard for such apis. However, for my application it would be easier for me to use xml instead of json. Now, I could of course convert my xml to json on the server and then back again to xml in the client's site javascript, but that seems unnecessarily cumbersome. What I really need is and xmlp solution, xml with padding. I tired googling but couldn't find a jquery plug-in that does that. Anyone knows a simple solution?

Now that Apple won't allow Flash on the iPad, I'm looking for a 100% javascript solution and was led to consider GWT.

@CONTENT:Background I am developing an application (with Spring MVC) with its base path as: http://localhost:8080/myapplication/
 I have a stylesheet /css/style.css that I am trying to refer with absolute path in a JSP as: <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/style.css" type="text/css" media="screen, projection">
 Problem The stylesheet never loads in the browser. When I follow the stylesheet link through browser's view source feature, the link appears to be: http://localhost:8080/css/style.css

@TITLE:MFC Combo-Box Control is not showing the full list of items when I click the drop-down menu
@CONTENT:I'm coding an app in MSVS 2008, which has a ComboBox control which I initialize thru the code as below: static char*                    OptionString[4] = {"Opt1",
                                                   "Opt2",
                                                   "Opt3",
                                                   "Opt4"};


BOOL CMyAppDlg::OnInitDialog()
{
    CDialog::OnInitDialog();

 // Set the icon for this dialog.  The framework does this automatically
 //  when the application's main window is not a dialog
 SetIcon(m_hIcon, TRUE);   // Set big icon
 SetIcon(m_hIcon, FALSE);  // Set small icon

    // TODO: Add extra initialization here

    m_Option.AddString(OptionString[0]);
    m_Option.AddString(OptionString[1]);
    m_Option.AddString(OptionString[2]);
    m_Option.AddString(OptionString[3]);
    m_Option.SetCurSel(0);

    return TRUE;  // return TRUE  unless you set the focus to a control
}
 In the above code, m_Option is the Control variable for the ComboBox Control. Now, when I build the app and click the down-arrow, the drop-down box shows the first option ONLY(since I've selected that thru my code). But, if i press down-arrow key on keyboard, it cycles thru the options in the order I've inserted, but never does it show more than 1 option in the box. So, In case an user wants to select option3, he has to cycle through options 1 and 2 !! Though once I select any option using the keyboard, the appropriate event handlers are fired, I'm miffed by this behaviour , as is understandable. I'm listing the properties of the combo-box control as well - only the properties that are true(rest are set to false): Type - Dropdown Vertical Scrollbar Visible Tabstop This has bugged me for weeks now. Can anyone pls enlighten me ?
@CODE:static char*                    OptionString[4] = {"Opt1",

@TITLE:For each <item> in CheckedListBox. <item> returns as Object and not as Control
@CONTENT:I have a CheckedListBox previously populated. I want to loop with a "for each / next" through all items in the CheckedListBox and do a lot of "stuff" with each iteration element of the checkedlistbox. example code:     For Each item In CheckedListBox1.Items

 the problem is that is an 'Object' type and not a 'Control' type. If I force the iteration var As CheckBox, it throws an InvalidCastException saying that type 'System.String' can't be associated with type 'System.Windows.Forms.CheckBox' I know I can easily work around this but I want to use a for each /next loop since I have a lot of code in that loop (and With can't be used) and always poiting directly to the object is something I wish to avoid and I really need the code to be as simple as possible. I actually spent one afternoon looking for this but couldn't find any answer.

@TITLE:Deserializing a class containing a List<T>: Why is List initially filled with Nulls?
@CONTENT:I have a class Bar which contains a List<Foo>, with both Foo and Bar implementing ISerializable. When deserializing a Bar, the List<Foo> is initially filled with (the correct number of) nulls; then on exiting the Bar deserialization ctor, each Foo's deserialization ctor is called, filling the List<Foo> with the (correctly deserialized) Foos. Why is this happening? I can't replicate it in a test project: whatever I have tried has resulted in the Foo deserialization ctors being called before the Bar ctor. This is actually the behaviour I would like, as I need the list to be filled in order to do some initialization for the deserialized Bar! Anyone have an idea as to what could be causing the Foos to be deserialized so late? Thanks!
