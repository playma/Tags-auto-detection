@TITLE:How can I further specialize this template idea?
@CONTENT:I can do this with a template specialization I think, for nestedness of 1,2,3 (most common cases) by respectively nesting 1,2,3 for loops and referring to the types by their typenames in stl...but for arbitrary depth, without use of the preprocessor, is there a way to do this? Maybe with mpl? Or would I need a preprocessor tool as well? Right now I am doing something like this: template<typename T, int>
struct MapDump {};

template<typename T >
struct MapDump<T,1>
{
  static void dump(const T& map, string file, string header="")
  {
    if (!header.empty())
      cout << header << endl;

    for (typename T::const_iterator cIt = map.begin();
         cIt != map.end();
         ++cIt)
      cout << cIt->first << "," << cIt->second << endl;
  }
};

template<typename T >
struct MapDump<T,2>
{
  static void dump(const T& map, string file, string header="")
  {
    if (!header.empty())
      cout << header << endl;

    for (typename T::const_iterator it1 = map.begin();
         it1 != map.end();
         ++it1)
      for (typename T::mapped_type::const_iterator it2 = it1->second.begin();
           it2 != it1->second.end();
           ++it2)
        cout << it1->first << "," << it2->first << "," << it2->second << endl;
  }
};
 which I can call with, for example:   map<int, map<int, double> > m;
  m[1][1] = 1.0;
  m[1][2] = 1.0;
  m[2][1] = 2.0;
  m[2][2] = 2.0;

  MapDump< map<int, map<int, double> >, 2 >::dump(m, "test.csv");
 (I stripped out the fstream stuff and left std::cout to simplify the sample code here) My question is, how can I go about specializing when, say, the last level mapped_type is a container type? For example map > is technically a 2-depth construct and not a one level construct...but my nest of 2 specialization wouldn't compile for that type...any other suggestions on how to, perhaps abstract thsi further (figure out the depth of the construct at compile time as well) are welcome..thanks!

@LINK:/questions/10558035/performance-issues-when-cropping-uiimage-coregraphics-ios
@TITLE:Performance issues when cropping UIImage (CoreGraphics, iOS)
@CONTENT:The basic idea of what we are trying to do is that we have a large UIImage, and we want to slice it into several pieces. The user of the function can pass in a number of rows and number of columns, and the image will be cropped accordingly (ie. 3 rows and 3 columns slices the image into 9 pieces). The problem is, we're having performance issues when trying to accomplish this with CoreGraphics. The largest grid we require is 5x5, and it takes several seconds for the operation to complete (which registeres as lagtime to the user.) This is of course far from optimal. My colleague and I have spent quite a while on this, and have searched the web for answers unsuccessfully. Neither of us are extremely experienced with Core Graphics, so I'm hoping there's some silly mistake in the code that will fix our problems. It's left to you, SO users, to please help us figure it out! We used the tutorial at http://www.hive05.com/2008/11/crop-an-image-using-the-iphone-sdk/ to base revisions of our code on. The function below: -(void) getImagesFromImage:(UIImage*)image withRow:(NSInteger)rows withColumn:(NSInteger)columns
{
    CGSize imageSize = image.size;
    CGFloat xPos = 0.0;
    CGFloat yPos = 0.0;
    CGFloat width = imageSize.width / columns;
    CGFloat height = imageSize.height / rows;

    int imageCounter = 0;

    //create a context to do our clipping in
    UIGraphicsBeginImageContext(CGSizeMake(width, height));
    CGContextRef currentContext = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext();

    CGRect clippedRect = CGRectMake(0, 0, width, height);
    CGContextClipToRect(currentContext, clippedRect);

    for(int i = 0; i < rows; i++)
    {
        xPos = 0.0;
        for(int j = 0; j < columns; j++)
        {
            //create a rect with the size we want to crop the image to
            //the X and Y here are zero so we start at the beginning of our
            //newly created context
            CGRect rect = CGRectMake(xPos, yPos, width, height);

            //create a rect equivalent to the full size of the image
            //offset the rect by the X and Y we want to start the crop
            //from in order to cut off anything before them
            CGRect drawRect = CGRectMake(rect.origin.x * -1,
                                     rect.origin.y * -1,
                                     image.size.width,

            //draw the image to our clipped context using our offset rect
            CGContextDrawImage(currentContext, drawRect, image.CGImage);

            xPos += (width);
        }
        yPos += (height);
    }
    //pop the context to get back to the default

from table2 t2 with (nolock) join table1 t1
on table2.id=t1.id

 This query works fine, it updates the 3rd table column, however if i supply IN operators like this:   update table3 set column3=
    (
    select t2.column3+t1.column3
    from table2 t2 with (nolock) join table1 t1
    on table2.id=t1.id

    )
    where id IN (100,101);
 this fails and i get this message Subquery returned more than 1 value. This is not permitted when the subquery follows =, !=, <, <= , >, >= or when the subquery is used as an expression. The statement has been terminated. & i know this is because subquery is returning more than 1 row, how can i handle this scenario? Any hint/thought will be helpful. How do i update for multiple ids? ie. the select query value returned by ID 100 should be updated against ID 100 in 3rd table & similarly for ID 101. Also, I need to do a sum like this sum(t2.column3)- (t1.column3 + t1.column2)  update table3 set column3=

@TITLE:How to run opencv on on a microcontroller?
@CONTENT:I don't know lots of things about the electronics field and controllers. But I want to know how to combine an opencv program with a red traffic light? I know that the answer is something that is micro controller but I only know that there is a compiler AVR which can compile C to hex and then working with micro controllers. But OpenCV (which I think I won't run on C) is high level and probably won't work with AVR. So what should I do to combine a machine vision program (by OpenCV & C++) and the timer of a traffic red light? Changing my programming language and library is so difficult for me, according to some reasons. My program must be real-time. If there is another system(not controllers and ...) which it costs doesn't much and can run opencv programs, it can be used by me. If you need anymore details just tell me.

@TITLE:R - ggplot2, several questions, multiple correlated plots
@CONTENT:First question I've asked on stack and I'm pretty new to R, so please pardon any etiquette offenses. I'm plotting 2 stacked area charts using ggplot2. The data is wait events from an Oracle database. It's a performance tuning chart. I have several questions. The two plots below do not line-up correctly, most likely due to the width of text in the legend. Is there an easy solution to this? The two plots are really correlated, where the top plot shows wait classes like "CPU" and "User I/O" and the bottom plot shows the details of the specific wait events in those classes. I'd like the colors in the bottom to be based on the wait class, the same as the top, just different shades of that color for the specific events. I'm also open to other options if you don't like the concept. It's a lot of information to convey. I've limited the number of events to 12 to fit in the color scheme, but there are more if it can work. I'd like to either show more granular time ticks on the X, or perhaps even shade the off-business hours (6pm-8am) gray just to convey a better sense of time of day. Are there any color schemes with more than 12 colors people commonly use? Looked through brewer and this is the max. I know I could create my own, just curious. Here's my code: library(ggplot2)

@CONTENT:I have a search form: <form class="searchForm" id="topSearchForm" action="/search.ds">
 that has an onsubmit-event attached to it, triggering a javascript. The purpose of this javascript is to empty certain form-fields before submission of the form based on certain criteria. To be clear, what needs to happend is: User input -> User clicks search button (or presses "enter") -> Javascript runs -> fields are cleared -> form is submitted This works exactly as intended in all browsers except in IE7 and IE8. The javascript runs but for some reason the form submission is done before the fields are being cleared by the javascript. This causes the submitted page to include the data from fields that were supposed to be cleared. I only have control of (certain parts of) the UI and cannot handle anything after the submission of the form. For usability purpose it is important that these fields (that should be cleared) are filled out up until the user submits the form. Why is the internal logic different in IE7 & IE8 (it works fine in IE9 and "all other browsers)? Is there a way for me to circumvent this issue? Here are some more code to clarify: I attach the event to the form: var formElement = document.getElementById("topSearchForm");
[...]
formElement.attachEvent('onsubmit', function() {clearForSubmit()});
 and clearForSubmit is defined and is triggered.
@CODE:<form class="searchForm" id="topSearchForm" action="/search.ds"> var formElement = document.getElementById("topSearchForm");
[...]
formElement.attachEvent('onsubmit', function() {clearForSubmit()});

@TITLE:@XmlTransient for serialization but not for deserialisation?
@CONTENT:Is there a way to configure the @XmlTransient JPA2.0 annotation that it will only block the JAXB mechanism when a Java-Object is serialized to xml and not when the incoming XML is transformed to a java object? Background: I have a REST api which speaks XML. There is an endpoint to create a new Attachment object. As we speak of attachment there is a byte[] field in this class. In further listings of attachments i don't want to deliver the byte[] content of each attachment. @Entity
@XmlRootElement
public class Attachment {

private String name;

private String mimeType;

private byte[] dataPart;

public String getName() {
    return name;
}

public void setName( String name ) {
    this.name = name;
}

public String getMimeType() {
    return mimeType;
}

public void setMimeType( String mimeType ) {
    this.mimeType = mimeType;
}

public byte[] getDataPart() {

    return dataPart.clone();
}

public void setDataPart( byte[] dataPart ) {
    this.dataPart = dataPart.clone();
}
}
 So, when i mark the getDataPart() with XmlTransient, the data of the incoming byte[] is ignored and set to null -> it's lost. Anyone an idea how to specifify the direction of the XmlTransient?
@CODE:@Entity
@XmlRootElement
public class Attachment {

private String name;

private byte[] dataPart;

public String getName() {
    return name;
}

    this.name = name;
}

public String getMimeType() {
    return mimeType;
}

public void setMimeType( String mimeType ) {
    this.mimeType = mimeType;
}

public byte[] getDataPart() {

    return dataPart.clone();
}

public void setDataPart( byte[] dataPart ) {
    this.dataPart = dataPart.clone();

@TITLE:Revoking Oracle Permissions to multiple users at once
@CONTENT:We're rationalising our database user permissions and to that end we'd like to revoke all select permissions across all tables in a schema granted to all users (but not a specific role). With some regular expressions I've tried creating a universal revoke for each table giving something like: revoke select on TABLE1 from USER1,USER2,USER3...; revoke select on TABLE2 from USER1,USER2,USER3...; However as not all users were granted permissions to all tables, this results in the oracle error: 01927. 00000 - "cannot REVOKE privileges you did not grant" Which makes sense but isn't helpful. I also tried using All_Tab_Privs to get a list of all tables with the requisite grants to be revoked, and this works, but I can't see how to easily get from this to actually revoking the permissions. SELECT * From All_Tab_Privs where grantor = 'GRANTING_USER' and grantee != 'READROLE' and grantee != 'PUBLIC' and grantee != 'SYS'; Any suggestions for how to do this without spending hours in a spreadsheet? I'm guessing some PL/SQL? Thanks.

I want to create some software to integrate with it, but I just need to manipulate the date in the database (As i do not have access to the source). Is there a SQL Management Studio equalivelent to Visual FoxPro, and can I see the tables and data by looking at the Database files? or is it all integrated some how into the programming and I would need the source to manipulate it?

@TITLE:How to perform multiple Linq to Entities orderings dynamically
@CONTENT:So my problem is like this; in C# code, I need to perform multiple orderings of an entity set with the help of Linq to Entities, dependent on input parameters. There are three columns to order on, and the order of the ordering columns is itself variable (meaning that for each ordering, I need to look up which column to order on). How can I achieve this? I have some code that should work, but I repeat myself way too much since I haven't been able to parameterize my operations (Linq to Entities is very restrictive wrt. what I'm allowed to do in my lambdas). Please suggest how I can rewrite my code in accordance with the DRY principle, perhaps with the help of T4 code generation? The following code should illustrate my problem. It's an excerpt of the real code, for brevity, let me know if I should include more. The orderSpecs variable is an array of "order specifications", each of which specifying a column to order on and whether to order in a descending manner. The orderSpecs array has at least one element, so at least one ordering is performed. using (var db = new MyContainer())
{
    var orderSpec = orderSpecs[0];
    IQueryable<DbVersion> dVersions = null;
    if (orderSpec.Column == 0)
    {

@TITLE:In Akka, how do I know when an actor is ready to use after having been registered with actorOf()?
@CONTENT:If I create an actor using context().actorOf() in Akka, I get back a valid ActorRef. However, if I do the same but create an ActorRef using actorFor and the path I know that the actor will appear at, I do not reliably get a valid ActorRef back. How can I tell that an actor has been registered successfully? In the description above, I could simply use the ActorRef returned from actorOf(). However, in my actual case I create an actor that itself registers a child actor and I need to resolve that, so the problem in general is "how can I wait / register to be informed of an actor having been registered at a known path?".

@LINK:/questions/10547255/decoding-a-base64-file-in-javascript-jquery-for-download
@TITLE:Decoding a base64 file in Javascript/jQuery for download
@CONTENT:Today I have been experimenting with SQL binary objects. I started by storing an image in a table, making an AJAX request for a base64 encoding of the image, and displaying it with. <img src="data:image/jpeg;base64,' + base64imageReturnedWithAjax + '">')
 The image displays fine. The web project I'm working on also requires file downloads (PDF, mainly) - great, I thought, I'll store the PDF as a SQL binary object too, collect it from the server in the same way and then somehow magically decode it for download at the other end. Help! I first tried to decode it using a jQuery base64 decoder (https://github.com/carlo/jquery-base64) with: $.base64.decode(base64fileReturnedWithAjax)
 This generates the following error in the console: Uncaught Cannot decode base64
_getbyte64
_decode
$.ajax.success
f.Callbacks.o
f.Callbacks.p.fireWith
w
f.support.ajax.f.ajaxTransport.send.d
 My question is, therefore: Is this a feasible way to handle file downloads? if so, how! and if not, is there an advised way to allow a file to be downloaded from a SQL table? Kind regards, ATfPT EDIT: If it helps, this is the webmethod that retrieves and sends the file from the db/server (in VB.NET). Fileblob is the binary object within the database.

@TITLE:Rails ActionMailer encoding
@CONTENT:Setup: Ruby 1.9.2
Rails 3.2.2
 I'm having some trouble with the encoding of my emails. Note: I'm not that familiar with encoding and stuff like that. When sending an email with ActionMailer, something weird is going on with the html in the email. All equal(=) signs are getting changed to =3D. Example: <table border=3D"0" cellpadding=3D"0" cellspacing=3D"0" width=3D"=440">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td height=3D"10">   </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
 Special characters looks like this: ? -> ??. It looks great in local development, but when using SendGrid on production server, special characters don't work. I'm sure this is because my lack of understanding. Here's the mail Header: Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/html;
 charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable
X-SMTPAPI: {"filters": {}}
 Does it have anything to do with Content-Transfer-Encoding? Or should it be like that? Maybe it's a problem with SendGrid and not my setup? An employee at SendGrid told me this: you need to make sure your equals signs are URI-encoded, what does that mean? Thanks in advance!

@TITLE:How to use both Google Drive API and the chrome web payments licensing API
@CONTENT:UPDATE to clarify the question... In attempting google drive example app Dr edit for php working in our test app which had already successfully implemented the licensing API, https://developers.google.com/chrome/web-store/docs/samples#php, we got an 'error saving' message and a syntax error from dredit.js trying to log error to console. We realized that we needed to update the existing apps manifest.json with some needed info, setting the CONTAINER to GOOGLE_DRIVE and the id from API console. However, that brought a warning from developer dashboard that made us sad because it seems our task is not possible: Apps that specify a container other than CHROME in the manifest may not use Chrome Web Store payments. Catch22: Use CHROME (apparently the default) or GOOGLE_DRIVE for container? So that's our question: We want to incorporate the drive AND chrome web store payments in php and I am not sure how the tutorials for drive and licensing API can be reconciled regarding container. Did we fail to read that GDrive enabled apps must be free? NOTE: Making it more complicated is the fact that it seems lots of solutions to access docs via the documents-list-API are deprecated now, for instance authsub and oauth 1.0 solutions. Ideally, we wouldn't want to write a web app that stops working in 2015.

@TITLE:Autofac SingleInstance not working
@CONTENT:I am trying to get a Singleton instance working with Autofac. I'm kind of doing a quasi-mvvm type thing with Winforms, just an experiment so don't get to hung up on that. But I am trying you have my model be a single instance with a reference in a command (ICommand here is not the WPF variety): I have the following setup of a container: var cb = new ContainerBuilder();
cb.RegisterType<CalculateCommissionCommand>().As<ICommand<TradeEntry>>().SingleInstance();
cb.RegisterType<CalculationsModel>().As<ICalculationsModel>().SingleInstance();
cb.Register(c => new CalculationsView() { Model = c.Resolve<ICalculationsModel>() }).SingleInstance();
cb.Build();
 Now the Command takes an ICalculationsModel as a constructor parameter. However, when I set a value in the Model being passed to the Command, that value does not appear within the model that has already been set withing the CalculationsView. It seems that the command and the view are being passed different instances of the CalculationsModel despite the "singleInstance" method being called. Am I missing something? Why is this happening?
@CODE:var cb = new ContainerBuilder();
cb.RegisterType<CalculateCommissionCommand>().As<ICommand<TradeEntry>>().SingleInstance();
cb.RegisterType<CalculationsModel>().As<ICalculationsModel>().SingleInstance();

 When I turn off AdBlock the ad is displayed correctly without issues. When I turn it on, AdBlock completely makes the #ad-wrapper invisible. I thought it would only remove the ad, leaving my background-image message there for my users to see. How can I accomplish this behavior?

@CONTENT:I know this subject has been run into the ground, however I have tried every solution I've found on StackOverflow to fix this issue, and its just not working for some reason. I am creating a UILabel programmatically, then using this font. The UILabel is rendering but not in the font I want it to (looks like its defaulting to something) First I imported two .ttf fonts into the xcode project under a folder called "Resources". The two fonts are Gotham Book and Gotham Book Italic (GothaBoo.ttf, GothaBooIta.ttf) Then, I added a line to the [my app]-Info.plist file called "UIAppFont", added two rows to the array, Item 0 | String | GothaBoo, Item 1 | String | GothaBooIta. I checked the Target Build Phases, under Copy Bundle Resources, and made sure the two fonts were in there. Then, I simply added this code to the viewDidLoad routine: UILabel *myLabel1 = [[UILabel alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(50, 100, 200, 100)];
myLabel1.text = @"Hello";
myLabel1.backgroundColor = [UIColor clearColor];
myLabel1.font = [UIFont fontWithName: @"GothaBoo" size: 48.0];
myLabel1.textColor = [UIColor blackColor];

[self.view addSubview:myLabel1]; 
 No dice. What on earth am I doing wrong? The project is in Xcode 4.3.2, for the iPad, running 5+ of iOS

    <li><a class="$400" href="#d3">Dress</a></li>
    <li class="amount"></li>
    **<span>$200</span>**
</ul>
 this is the jQuery code:-  $(document).ready(function() {
      ("ul.stag li").click(function(){
        var activePd = $(this).find("a").attr("class");    //the clicked list
        $(".stag span").html(activePd.html());

@TITLE:how to Hide XNA 4.0?
@CONTENT:I'm Trying to hide my XNA game window but i don't seem to be able to here's what I've tried so far from what i could get off google.         Form frmXNA = (Form)Form.FromHandle(this.Window.Handle);
        frmXNA.Hide();
 I have also tried         Form frmXNA = (Form)Form.FromHandle(this.Window.Handle);
        frmXNA.Visible = false;
 I figure I'm doing something very simple wrong and once it's pointed out I'll probably laugh at how i didn't see it. Thanks for the help
@CODE:Form frmXNA = (Form)Form.FromHandle(this.Window.Handle);

@TITLE:Count the number of rows that contain a letter/number
@CONTENT:What I am trying to achieve is straightforward, however it is a little difficult to explain and I don't know if it is actually even possible in postgres. I am at a fairly basic level. SELECT, FROM, WHERE, LEFT JOIN ON, HAVING, e.t.c the basic stuff. I am trying to count the number of rows that contain a particular letter/number and display that count against the letter/number. i.e How many rows have entries that contain an "a/A" (Case insensitive) The table I'm querying is a list of film names. All I want to do is group and count 'a-z' and '0-9' and output the totals. I could run 36 queries sequentially: SELECT filmname FROM films WHERE filmname ilike '%a%'
SELECT filmname FROM films WHERE filmname ilike '%b%'
SELECT filmname FROM films WHERE filmname ilike '%c%'
 And then run pg_num_rows on the result to find the number I require, and so on. I know how intensive like is and ilike even more so I would prefer to avoid that. Although the data (below) has upper and lower case in the data, I want the result sets to be case insensitive. i.e "The Men Who Stare At Goats" the a/A,t/T and s/S wouldn't count twice for the resultset. I can duplicate the table to a secondary working table with the data all being strtolower and working on that set of data for the query if it makes the query simpler or easier to construct. An alternative could be something like SELECT sum(length(regexp_replace(filmname, '[^X|^x]', '', 'g'))) FROM films; for each letter combination but again 36 queries, 36 datasets, I would prefer if I could get the data in a single query. Here is a short data set of 14 films from my set (which actually contains 275 rows) District 9

 If I manually lay out each letter and number in a column and then register if that letter appears in the film title by giving it an x in that column and then count them up to produce a total I would have something like this below. Each vertical column of x's is a list of the letters in that filmname regardless of how many times that letter appears or its case. The result for the short set above is: A  x x  xxxx xxx  9 
B       x  x      2 
C x     xxx   xx  6

 In the example above, each column is a "filmname" As you can see, column 5 marks only a "u" and a "p" and column 11 marks only a "9". The final column is the tally for each letter. I want to build a query somehow that gives me the result rows: A 9, B 2, C 6, D 6, E 8 e.t.c taking into account every row entry extracted from my films column. If that letter doesn't appear in any row I would like a zero. I don't know if this is even possible or whether to do it systematically in php with 36 queries is the only possibility. In the current dataset there are 275 entries and it grows by around 8.33 a month (100 a year). I predict it will reach around 1000 rows by 2019 by which time I will be no doubt using a completely different system so I don't need to worry about working with a huge dataset to trawl through. The current longest title is "Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief" at 50 chars (yes, poor film I know ;-) and the shortest is 1, "9". I am running version 9.0.0 of Postgres. Apologies if I've said the same thing multiple times in multiple ways, I am trying to get as much information out so you know what I am trying to achieve. If you need any clarification or larger datasets to test with please just ask and I'll edit as needs be. Suggestion are VERY welcome. Edit 1 Erwin Thanks for the edits/tags/suggestions. Agree with them all. Fixed the missing "9" typo as suggested by Erwin. Manual transcribe error on my part. kgrittn, Thanks for the suggestion but I am not able to update the version from 9.0.0. I have asked my provider if they will try to update. Response Thanks for the excellent reply Erwin Apologies for the delay in responding but I have been trying to get your query to work and learning the new keywords to understand the query you created. I adjusted the query to adapt into my table structure but the result set was not as expected (all zeros) so I copied your lines directly and had the same result. Whilst the result set in both cases lists all 36 rows with the appropriate letters/numbers however all the rows shows zero as the count (ct). I have tried to deconstruct the query to see where it may be falling over. The result of SELECT DISTINCT id, unnest(string_to_array(lower(film), NULL)) AS letter
FROM  films
 is "No rows found". Perhaps it ought to when extracted from the wider query, I'm not sure. When I removed the unnest function the result was 14 rows all with "NULL" If I adjust the function COALESCE(y.ct, 0) to COALESCE(y.ct, 4)<br />
 then my dataset responds all with 4's for every letter instead of zeros as explained previously. Having briefly read up on COALESCE the "4" being the substitute value I am guessing that y.ct is NULL and being substituted with this second value (this is to cover rows where the letter in the sequence is not matched, i.e if no films contain a 'q' then the 'q' column will have a zero value rather than NULL?) The database I tried this on was SQL_ASCII and I wondered if that was somehow a problem but I had the same result on one running version 8.4.0 with UTF-8. Apologies if I've made an obvious mistake but I am unable to return the dataset I require. Any thoughts? Again, thanks for the detailed response and your explanations.

@CONTENT:I am trying to migrate parts of a system that handles word templates. Until now, common functionality has been spread out on several .dots (with vba) on a fileserver. We are now aiming at putting this functionality into a vb.net application which we interact with as a reference from word. I would like to call vb.net functionality from vba, passing a userform as an argument. From a form test class in vb.net it works fine with TestFunction(inForm:=Me).

@TITLE:exit a nested loop in excel
@CONTENT:i have a loop in a macro i'm writing of the following structure: there are two worksheets in this book. raw data (hence the endpointData variable) and a G/L (General ledger) sheet (hence the endpointGL variable) there are three for loops in this function: (1) the first loop iterates through each record in the raw data file. (2) the second loop iterates through the verified matches from REGEXP (a regular expression search) and (3) the third loop goes through the G/L and finds a corresponding match and puts (using: PUT_DATA_RANGE) that data into the appropriate spot. Here's sort of what i'm getting at: psuedocode: For i = 2 To endpointData

    If SOME_TEST = True Then
        Set MATCHES = REGEXP.EXECUTE()
        For Each myMatch In MATCHES
            For j = 1 To endpointGL
                If myMatch.value = SOME_CONDITION Then
                    PUT_DATA_RANGE
                    Exit For
                ElseIf myMatch.value <> SOME_CONDITION Then
                    MsgBox ("there might be a problem")
                    ' EXIT BOTH LOOPS HERE

            Next
            End If
        Next
    End If
Next i
 now you'll notice that i have a few comments to myself. if the third loops finds no match in the G/L the code currently interrupts to notify the user. but that message box MsgBox("there might be a problem") is looped through along with the third loop. how do i get excel to exit BOTH loops and bring the FIRST for loop to the next availabe record in the raw data? by the way, i've tried exiting it with an Exit For but that doesn't seem to work exactly.

@TITLE:How to show a progress bar while generating a PDF file for download, without IE download warnings
@CONTENT:I've got a communication between client and server. The process is simple: I'm making an AJAX POST request to a controller which generates a pdf in the file system On success of the above request a form GET request is made to get the pdf back and the standard browser "save or open" dialog box opens up The reason I'm having a two step process is because I need to have a progress bar while the pdf is being generated. The reason of the second request being a form submit rather than part of the AJAX request is because I can't get the standard browser "save or open" dialog box. The problem with this approach is that IE7 & IE8 pop up a their annoying notification bar notifying the user that the it is dangerous to download the content and I don't want that. So: I need the progress bar. If I go for an AJAX request only I need a way to pop up the "save or open" dialog box. If I go for the a form GET submit I need a way of knowing when the file has been generated in order to stop the progress bar, something like a shared flag between server and client. Any help appreciated.

@TITLE:Unable to determine the identity of domain using System.IO.Packaging
@CONTENT:I am getting "Unable to determine the identity of domain" when using System.IO.Packaging through COM Interop, there are a few articles describing why this is happening and the solution is to run the offending function in its own AppDomain. So I took the sample code, which looks like the below but I still get the error, I am wondering what i am doing wrong and also, with VS 2010 it says AddAssembly and AddHost are obsolete - I wonder if that means they are no longer implemented, but if thats the case I dont really understand how to use the new methods (AddAssemblyEvidence and AddHostEvidence)??  AppDomainSetup setup = new AppDomainSetup();
 setup.ApplicationBase = AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory;

 Evidence evidence = new Evidence(AppDomain.CurrentDomain.Evidence);
 evidence.AddAssembly(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().FullName);
 evidence.AddHost(new Zone(SecurityZone.MyComputer));

 AppDomain domain = AppDomain.CreateDomain("BlobPackage", evidence, setup);

@TITLE:Why does a project run faster in NetBeans internal terminal than in windows command prompt?
@CONTENT:I am new in this forum, so excuse me if I am not asking the question right the first time. I think it is not necessary to provide code here since I think it has nothing to do with the code and the question might be more general. I have written and built a C++ project in NetBeans 7.1.2 using MinGW (g++) in Windows XP. Both, the Debug version and the Release version work fine and deliver the desired output of the computations. However, if I "run" the project (either project) in NetBeans' internal terminal, I can measure computation times of between 115 and 130 microseconds. If I execute the exe file in a Windows command prompt, I measure computation times of between 500 and 3000 microseconds. (On a 2.2 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo with 2 GB Ram. I measure the time by reading the number of cpu clock ticks since reset and dividing by the cpu frequency.) I tried the same on another computer (incl. building the project), also 2.2 GHz and 16 GB Ram and Windows7. The program runs a bit faster, but the pattern is the same. The same is true, when I run the project from NetBeans but in an external terminal (also windows terminal). And it applies to both versions, the debug and the release version. One of the computations (not the most time critical) is a Fast Fourier Transform and depends on the fftw (http://www.fftw.org/) "libfftw3-3.dll" library. Within NetBeans its location is known, in the windows command prompt, the dll has to be in the same directory as the executable. Why is it, that a program runs so much faster in NetBeans' internal terminal window than in a windows command prompt window? Could it have something to do with the dynamic linking of the library at load time? However, the computation step that actually takes longer in windows command prompt than in NetBeans' terminal does not depend on the functions in the dll (the multiplication of two comlex numbers). The most time consuming and crucial computation in the program is the multiplication of two arrays of complex number of type fftw_complex which is double[2]: for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {  

    double k1 = x[i][0] * (y[i][0] - y[i][1]);  
    double k2 = (y[i][1] * -1) * (x[i][0] + x[i][1]);  
    double k3 = y[i][0] * (x[i][1] - x[i][0]);  


    result[i][0] = k1 - k2;  
    result[i][1] = k1 + k3;  
}  
 x and y are two arrays of complex numbers where [i][0] holds the real part and [i][1] holds the imaginary part. result is a preallocated array of the same type. This loop takes about 5 microseconds for arrays of length 513 when the program is executed in NetBeans' internal terminal, but rather 100 microseconds when I run the program in a Windows command prompt. I could not find an explanation in all the really helpful advice in the answer by sehe. Please let me know, if you think it has something to do with the actual code, then I would provide some. I have looked for similar questions, but could not find any. Any hints or points to other questions and answers that I might have missed are appreciated. Cheers.

    double k3 = y[i][0] * (x[i][1] - x[i][0]);

 As I click the three link (Harry, Tom, Peter), the converter work great. It converter the id and bind the player back to my managed bean. I then type something in the text box, then click Switch, the first time it work fine, what I typed appear next to the button, but then I change what I type, and click Switch again, then error message appear Bad Request. Please use a link from within the system, which is the error message for required for f:viewParam. If I took the f:viewParam out then everything work fine. Surprisingly, if I switch from f:viewParam to o:viewParam (OmniFaces), then it work great.

 The issue is that "alpha_numeric" requires that the password only contain letters or numbers, it doesn't require both. Going for the stronger password option here.

@CONTENT:I've got a bunch of files that have sentences ending like this: \@.Next sentence. I'd like to insert a space after the period. Not all occurrences of \@. do not have a space, however, so my regex checks if the next character after the period is a capital letter. Because I'm checking one character after the period, I can't just do a replace on \@. to \@., and because I don't know what character is following the period, I'm stuck. My command currently: sed -i .bak -E 's/\\@\.[A-Z]/<SOMETHING IN HERE>/g' *.tex
 How can I grab the last letter of the matching string to use in the replacement regex? EDIT: For the record, I'm using a BSD version of sed (I'm using OS X) - from my previous question regarding sed, apparently BSD sed (or at least, the Apple version) doesn't always play nice with GNU sed regular expressions.

@CONTENT:I'm trying to wrap my head around why a histogram using qplot is changing when I add a facet_wrap. You can find the data I used for this example here The factors in my facet_grid come from using cut: library(ggplot2)

data$cuts <- cut(data$y, c(0, 50, 100, 500, Inf))
 So now I have this: > summary(data)

 Max.   :1526.00   Max.   :1.000                  
 If I look at only the section where cuts=="(0,50]", it looks fine.: qplot(x, data=subset(data, cuts=="(0,50]"))
 But when I add a facet grid, the y-axes are all wrong: qplot(x, data=data) + facet_grid(cuts~., scales="free_y")
 Notice that the y-axis on the top facet is now only 40ish instead of over 450. The only facet that seems to be right is (500,Inf]. edit: I'm using ggplot 0.9.0 in R 2.14.2

@TITLE:Problems hosting multiple ASP.Net MVC3 applications in an IIS7.5 website
@CONTENT:Some specs: IIS 7.5 ASP.Net MVC3 I have three MVC3 applications I would like to host: Project A Project B Project C I want to get the URLs to be like this, respectively: http://domain/ http://domain/ProjectB http://domain/ProjectC So in IIS, I have the default website, which points to the folder for ProjectA. I then added two Applications to it, one pointing to ProjectB, and one to ProjectC, and their respective folders on the hard drive. I am storing the sites in C:\sites. Each project has a folder in C:\sites where the application's files reside. As you can see, the sites are not nested at all on the server. When I load http://domain/ProjectB, it is trying to load configuration values from the ProjectA web.config. Obviously this is not what I want, and I'm not that awesome at server configuration. I got it working by wrapping most of the ProjectA web.config in a location tag like so: <location path="." inheritInChildApplications="false" >
    <!-- Lots of web.config stuff for ProjectA -->
</location>
 I'm not really a fan of this, it feels wrong. To me, it seems like a nested Application in my site in IIS should not even know about the parent site. What am I doing wrong? I'm sure it is something really small. I would have made ProjectA an Application, but I don't want the alias on it, as I want http://domain/ to pull it up for the users. Again, I am not that knowledgeable about server stuff, it just isn't fun to me, hence why I'm asking y'all! Thanks!

               return View("Details", umtoupdate.UserName);

     }
 And in this class, i have defined one constructor that creates a list to do another things(i put because it tell me something about a parameterless constructor)..     public AdminController()
    {

    foreach (MembershipUser member in iduser) {


            UserEntity entity2 = new UserEntity();
            entity2.Username = member.UserName;

            }
            _entities.Add(entity2);

       }
 And then, i go to edit a user, i can go to the first view (where can edit the info) but when i try to save the updated info and go to the second view to update the user, it tell me "[MissingMethodException no parameterless constructor defined for this object." Can someone tell me how can i fix it? If i change the Edit(string) and delete the string parameter, but in this case I cant get the info user, and if i add another view without parameter, it dont work for ambiguity.. Thanks. Ok thanks i didnt know that it havent a public constructor! But if i do another inherit class from MembershipUser (ex, MyUser as you said, with a public constructor) and i do public ActionResult Edit(MyUser umtoupdate) {...}
 When i try to get the user info tell me that im using a MembershipUser dictionary instead of MyUser dictionary because with the another view [Authorize(Roles = "Admins")]
public ActionResult Edit(string username)
{
    var usu = Membership.GetUser(username);
    return View(usu);
}
 Use the membeship class and return a membership user and i cant use in this case MyUser.GetUser because is a method from Membership! What can i do to fix it? Thanks a lot.

@TITLE:convert json to array via javascript [duplicate]
@CONTENT:Possible Duplicate: JSON to javaScript array Can anybody point me out how i can convert a json data to an array using java script in order to draw a chart from de data. The JSON is structured as follows: {
"d":{
  "results":[
     {
       "_metadata":{

 Does anyone have any advice on how to achieve this?

@TITLE:IE 9 has opacity on a child element and I cant stop it using captify
@CONTENT:Ok I am using a piece of javascript called Captify. It adds a small pop up to images for you with text in. Works great in all browsers accept IE9. IE9 fades everything within the popup div. I have read its a child element issue but I can not fix it. As captify can not be found anywhere online any more I will include all the code for that along with the css below then the code on my page. If anyone could help me stop the fade I would be very grateful as it has coursed me major problems. Java jQuery.fn.extend({

 Now the CSS for captify /* caption styling */

.caption {

display: none;
cursor: default;
/* remove these 4 lines below if you want 
the caption to span the whole width of the 
image
width: 82%;
/*border-top: 1px solid #303030;

/* background / transparency */
background: #000000;
opacity: 0.7;
filter: alpha(opacity=70);
-moz-opacity: 0.7;
-khtml-opacity: 0.7;
margin-bottom: 5px;
}

.caption a {
border: 0 none;
text-decoration: none;
background: #000000;
padding: 0.3em;
color:#FFFF00;
}

.caption a:hover {

text-decoration:underline;
}

.caption-wrapper {
float: left;
}

br.c { clear: both; }

@LINK:/questions/10516561/how-do-i-bind-a-google-maps-geocoder-geocode-callback-function
@TITLE:How do I bind a google maps geocoder.geocode() callback function
@CONTENT:I have a view that contains a google map accessible via this.map within the view scope. All is well in the world. Next I want to update the map position via events in my view. To do this I take text input, use google.maps.Geocoder.geocode(), then update the position via: setMapLocation: function (location) {     _.bind(this.setMapLocationCallback, this);

    console.log(this);

    var geocoder = new google.maps.Geocoder();
    geocoder.geocode({'address': location}, this.setMapLocationCallback);

},
 The console.log(this) here shows me the scope of the view, with this.map properly accessible. Notice that I explicitly bind the callback to this here. Here's the callback: setMapLocationCallback: function (results, status) {

    console.log('this in the callback');
    console.log(this);

    if (status == google.maps.GeocoderStatus.OK) {
        this.map.setCenter(results[0].geometry.location);
        var marker = new google.maps.Marker({
            map: this.map,
            position: results[0].geometry.location
        });
        this.mapCanvas.css({visibility: 'visibile'});
    } else {
        this.mapCanvas.css({visibility: 'hidden'});
    }
},
 The problems is that inside the callback console.log(this) shows that this is scoped to the Window object even though I bound it explicitly to the view object's this scope. I need to access this.map in the callback because I may have more than one map on a page and need to distinguish which one I'm talking about. How do I bind this callback to the proper scope? or, is there a better way to do this? I'm using backbonejs and underscorejs, but this should be a fairly generic problem. Thanks in advance, David

@CONTENT:I have two classes in this example - DeliveryMethod and Country. They have a many-to-many relationship with each other. What I want to do is select all DeliveryMethods that do not have any Countries mapped to them. I can do the opposite, that is select all delivery methods that have at least one country - SELECT m FROM DeliveryMethod m JOIN m.countries
 But I can't figure out how to do select where the countries field is empty. In plain SQL I would do the following (deliverymethod_country is the linking table): SELECT m.* FROM deliverymethods m
LEFT JOIN deliverymethod_country dc ON dc.deliverymethod_id = m.id
WHERE dc.deliverymethod_id IS NULL
 However any DQL equivalent of this doesn't work, for example: SELECT m FROM DeliveryMethod m LEFT JOIN m.countries WHERE m.countries IS NULL
 Which gives me this error: [Syntax Error] line 0, col 75: Error: Expected end of string, got 'm'

I found very little on the internet regarding this issue. Does it have to do with the fact that the connection pool of my operating system simply overloads and thus is not able to perform any more requests as well as accept any new connections? Or is it simply a windows issue that will not appear on any other unix like system? (I'm using Win 7 x64) If it has to do with connections, does this issue exist on any operating system whatever technology (node.js, python, php etc.) is used? Update: It appears that indeed some kind of connection pool is filling up, when I got that error from node at the same time accessing any other webpage is not possible anymore. Is there anything that can be done here?

@TITLE:Multiple (left, cross?) JOINs in MS Access
@CONTENT:I've got a following MS access (2010) database: Employee, Period and Operation tables are populated, and UnitOfWork table is blank. Basically I am having some items being produced by multiple workers (employees). Each item requires multiple operations (each worker can do any operations of any item any amount of times). All operations have some cost, and I will need to generate reports of how much every employee have earned "this month", have he fulfilled the plan, etc. I want to do a SELECT to see following: UnitOfWorks, for every available combination of Employee, Period and Operation. In other words, I want to SELECT all possible combinations of Employee, Period and Operation and LEFT JOIN UnitOfWork to the result, so I can input OperationsDone for every UnitOfWork. I'll add WHERE clauses and ORDER and later I thought CROSS JOIN would help (In MS Access it is just enumeration with commas), something like this: SELECT * FROM (Employee, Period, Operation)
LEFT JOIN UnitOfWork on UnitOfWork.OperationId=Operation.OperationId
 But when I execute this query, I get a "Syntax error in JOIN operation" error. I've also tried like this: SELECT * FROM Employee AS e LEFT JOIN
(Period AS p LEFT JOIN UnitOfWork AS uow ON p.PeriodId=uow.PeriodId)
on e.EmployeeId=uow.EmployeeId
 These are only 2 joins out of 3 I need, but already with this I get "JOIN Expression not supported" error. Any database design suggestions are also appreciated - this is a new database I'm designing and I'm a SQL newbie. Thanks in advance! Update: I am also thinking, maybe I should try a subquery? Like doing a CROSS join (of Operation, Employee and Period) in one query, and then LEFT joining the UnitOfWork to the query result... but how do I do a JOIN "by multiple fields"? And how do I implement a subquery in access?
@CODE:SELECT * FROM (Employee, Period, Operation)
LEFT JOIN UnitOfWork on UnitOfWork.OperationId=Operation.OperationId SELECT * FROM Employee AS e LEFT JOIN

@TITLE:How to solve Need imported data reference while building with runtime packages
@CONTENT:To help us modularize a monolithic application, we are in the process of setting up packages for use in debug builds, while still compiling to a single exe for release builds. One of our packages (EAUtils) contains a unit that is now producing [DCC Error] E2201 Need imported data reference ($G) to access 'SMsgDlgWarning' from unit 'SystemUtils'. This happens when building the EAUtils package itself. I am not into building packages that depend on EAUtils yet. EAUtils only depends on rtl/vcl packages and a package I created for the Jedi WinApi units. This is a result of the lines: // This is a TaskDialog override, with the same args as the old MessageDlg.
function TaskDialog(const aContent: string; const Icon: HICON = 0; 
  const Buttons: TTaskDialogCommonButtonFlags = TDCBF_OK_BUTTON): Integer;
const
  Captions: array[TMsgDlgType] of Pointer = (@SMsgDlgWarning, @SMsgDlgError, @SMsgDlgInformation, @SMsgDlgConfirm, nil);
var
  aMsgDlgType: TMsgDlgType;
  aTitle: string;
begin
  aMsgDlgType := TaskDialogIconToMsgDlgType(Icon);
  if aMsgDlgType <> mtCustom then
    aTitle := LoadResString(Captions[aMsgDlgType])
  else
    aTitle := Application.Title;
 More specifically this is a result of referencing SMsgDlgWarning, SMsgDlgError, SMsgDlgInformation and SMsgDlgConfirm, which are all declared in Vcl.Const. Please note that this code compiles without error when we are building a single executable. As a means of optimization, our include file does contain {$IMPORTEDDATA OFF} as this allows for faster access to (global) variables and constants. See http://hallvards.blogspot.com/2006/09/hack13-access-globals-faster.html. According to the documentation on the error ( http://docs.embarcadero.com/products/rad_studio/delphiAndcpp2009/HelpUpdate2/EN/html/devcommon/cm_package_varref_xml.html ) this is the cause and it says "To alleviate the problem, it is generally easiest to turn on the $IMPORTEDDATA switch and recompile the unit that produces the error." So, I have set {$IMPORTEDDATA ON} in our include file and made doubly sure by setting the Use imported data references to true in the Delphi Compiler | Compiling | Debugging section of the project options. Unfortunately, contrary to the documentation, this did not alleviate the problem. Even setting this compiler directive directly above the offending code and rebuilding the package did not remove the errors. What else do I need to do to solve this E2201 error? Not sure, but it may be significant that SMsgDlgWarning and its friends are resource strings?

@TITLE:Mixing Knockout with jQuery
@CONTENT:I'm creating a commenting system with knockout.js and I'm having some issues with getting the templating working with our existing jQuery functions. One example is with the dates comments are created. I wrote a jQuery function that causes the data to turn from 5-5-2012 to 2 Days ago. For example:     <ul data-bind="foreach: Comments">
        <li data-bind="attr: { id: Id }" class="Comment">
           <div data-bind="text: DateCreated" class="prettyDate"></div>

              $(".prettyDate").prettify();
          });
    </script>
 With this code, when I add a new comment dynamically, the date stays in the 5-5-2012 format. There are several other custom jQuery functions that act on repeating data that is now dynamically created by knockout (usually by selecting based on classes). How can I apply these custom jQuery functions on dynamic data generated by knockout.js?

@TITLE:MVC 2 DropDownList not selecting value in case of List
@CONTENT:I am using ASP.Net MVC 2 and have trouble getting a DropDownList to bind properly. I am using a strongly typed ViewModel and the HTML.DropDownListFor statement to create the dropdown in my View. The statement works fine in the 'normal' scenario where I just bind the DropDown to a simple field in my ViewModel. I am having trouble using this scenario when my ViewModel contain a List (array) of multiple objects where I want a field in each of these objects to bind to a (seperate) DropDown. In that case the DropDown's do not get the correct initial value. For example the case where we have a person that can have multiple addresses. Each address consists of a Street, a City and a State. I want the state to be displayed as a DropDown. My model is: public class PersonModel : CommonViewModel
{
    public IList<SelectListItem> AvailableStates { get; set; }

    public string Name { get; set; }

    public IList<AddressModel> Addresses { get; set; }

    public PersonModel()
    {
        AvailableStates = GenerateStates();
    }

    private IList<SelectListItem> GenerateStates()
    {
        List<SelectListItem> items = new List<SelectListItem>();
        items.Add(new SelectListItem() { Text = "WA", Value = "WA" });
        items.Add(new SelectListItem() { Text = "NY", Value = "NY" });
        items.Add(new SelectListItem() { Text = "IH", Value = "IH" });
        items.Add(new SelectListItem() { Text = "FL", Value = "FL" });
        items.Add(new SelectListItem() { Text = "CA", Value = "CA" });

        return items;
    }
}

public class AddressModel
{
    public string Street { get; set; }
    public string City { get; set; }
    public string State { get; set; }
}
 Now in my View I want to use something like: <% using (Html.BeginForm("SubmitPersonDetails", "Home", new { actionMode = "Person"}, FormMethod.Post, new { id = "SubmitPersonForm" }))
   {%>
    <div class="formrow longinput">
    <%= Html.LabelFor(person => person.Name)%>
    <%= Html.TextBoxFor(person => person.Name)%>
</div>
<h4>Addresses</h4>
<% for (int i = 0; i < Model.Addresses.Count; i++) { %>
<div class="formrow">
<%= Html.TextBoxFor(person => person.Addresses[i].Street)%>
<%= Html.TextBoxFor(person => person.Addresses[i].City)%>
<%--<%= Html.TextBoxFor(person => person.Addresses[i].State)%>--%>
<%= Html.DropDownListFor(person => person.Addresses[i].State, Model.AvailableStates) %>
</div>
<% } %>
 <input class="button primary" type="submit" value="Submit" name="Submit" />
<% } %>
 For the Textboxes this works fine (also if I just use a textbox for State, see the commented out bit). The DropDown's are generated correctly but not set to the correct value. If I select a value in the DropDowns and submit the form the correct values are put back into my model. I also tried putting the Address part in a UserControl, which is then rendered several time. If I render the UserControl using Html.RenderPartial the correct values are set in the DropDOwn's but on Postback my model isn't populated correctly. If I render the UserControl using EditorFor I get the same problem as with the code above: the DropDown's don't get the correct initial value but on Postback I do get the selected values set in my model. Another thing I tried is making the Addresses not a List but instead hardcoding several addresses in my View Model (properties: Address1, Address2, Address3) and then using: <%= Html.DropDownListFor(person => person.Address1.State, Model.AvailableStates) %> In this case the DropDown does get the correct value. Obviously I don't want to use this workaround for lack of flexibility. What am I doing wrong? I am new to MVC so maybe it is my whole approach that is wrong?
@CODE:public class PersonModel : CommonViewModel
{
    public IList<SelectListItem> AvailableStates { get; set; }

    public string Name { get; set; }

    public IList<AddressModel> Addresses { get; set; }

    public PersonModel()
    {
        AvailableStates = GenerateStates();
    }

    private IList<SelectListItem> GenerateStates()
    {
        List<SelectListItem> items = new List<SelectListItem>();
        items.Add(new SelectListItem() { Text = "WA", Value = "WA" });
        items.Add(new SelectListItem() { Text = "NY", Value = "NY" });
        items.Add(new SelectListItem() { Text = "IH", Value = "IH" });
        items.Add(new SelectListItem() { Text = "FL", Value = "FL" });
        items.Add(new SelectListItem() { Text = "CA", Value = "CA" });

        return items;
    }
}

public class AddressModel
{
    public string Street { get; set; }
    public string City { get; set; }
    public string State { get; set; }

@CONTENT:Use case : one Java process with one or two C++ processes, always on the same machine. Bidirectional, binary, non-persistent communication is required. One of the C++ process is responsible for instantiating the other processes. I have given a look around, seeing things like XML/JSON-RPC, Protocol Buffers, Thrift, zeromq, etc. If possible, portability would be nice, but Windows XP/7 is required.

The postorder traversal in the following image Sorted_binary_tree returns A, C, E, D, B, H, I, G, F (left, right, root). The Prolog code for PREORDER traversal is preorder(tree(X,L,R),Xs) :-
    preorder(L,Ls),
    preorder(R,Rs),
    append([X|Ls],Rs,Xs).

preorder(void,[]).

@CONTENT:I have a simple search field on a form that is set as multiline (which I understand is the only way to change a text box's height) and has the flag AcceptsReturn set to false. However, when I press enter within that control, instead of it activating the default button as it should, it puts in a return character. Now, I've also attempted using the KeyPress event to check if the Enter key has been pressed to activate the search-button click function in the hope that it would override this return behaviour - but it hasn't. Now it just runs the search AND inserts a return character. I'm running Visual Studio 2010 (although this problem seemed to be present in 2008 too before I converted it) and C# .NET 2.0.

At the moment I have a custom routine that uses application:get_key(Application,applications) to extract the dependencies and start them separately before starting the given application. I was wondering if there isn't a better way of doing this.

@CONTENT:I wonder whether someone may be able to help me please. I've put together this page which allows users to view their uploaded images in a gallery format. I'm now wanting to add the delete functionality to each image. I've created the button and the Javascript behind it, but I'm really not sure how to link the 'button click' with the actual physical deletion of the file. The images aren't stored in a database but are in two folder locations on my server, in the following structure: UploadedFiles/username/locationid/imagename and UploadedFiles/username/locationid/Thumbnails/imagename I'm relatively new to PHP and I'm now reaching the limits of my knowledge, but certainly willing to learn. From the documentation I've read I think I'm correct in saying that the unlink method is the correct command to use? But what I'm finding really difficult is telling the code to find the folders with the username and locationid folders which match the current username and locationid and then delete the files which match the $source name variable. I just wondered whether someone could perhaps provide some guidance please on how I may go about this. Many thanks and kind regards

 The remote lexer is matching the rule {symbol}: for A instead of {gpreg}|{xreg}. Could this be because I have a wildcard * in my definition of symbol up top? Why does this work for my flex and not the remote one? The --debug output from my local (good) build: --accepting rule at line 52 ("            ")

 One of the strings that it is having problems on is: /\s+/; The reg ex is not supposed to be matching the ending ;. In Python the RegEx works correctly (and does not match the ending ;, but in Java it does include the ;. The Question(s): What can I do to get this RegEx working in Java? Based on what I read here there should be no difference for this RegEx. Is there somewhere a list of differences between the RegEx implementations in Python vs Java?

-keepnames class * implements java.io.Serializable
-keep public class com.google.**
 And I notice that what is not obfuscated is the class names. So running jdgui i see com/test/abcd/ActualClass.java public class ActualClassName extends Activity etc moreover I see methods returning real classnames. like  ActualClassname aa();
 and imports statements like  import com.abcd.ActualClassName
 How do I get Proguard to obfuscate the classname itself. Its not just for Activities that I see this my Adapters are not being obfuscated. Well there is obfuscation going on but not class names. Is the rules above what prevents the class names from being obfuscated? Update: i have since removed the rules above and a Utility class that does not extend anything from Android is not being obfuscated. I'm now wondering if there is some implicit rule about keeping class names of classes that are referenced from classes that are being kept like Activity derivied classes? The classes whose names are not being obfuscated have a few things in common: 1) Static methods 2) Import of other types which are kept like those deriving from activity or serializable. 3) They have methods with parameters of other classes (Some of which might need to be kept). However there is no where that I am specifically requesting that these utility classes should be kept.

@TITLE:Why isn't the list monad method for `>>` defined as `flip const`?
@CONTENT:Is there some reason why the Prelude doesn't define the list monad like this? (Note the non-standard implementation of >>.) instance  Monad []  where
    m >>= k          = concat (map k m)
    m >> k           = k                 -- a.k.a. flip const
    return x         = [x]
    fail s           = []
 I tried checking this against the monad laws, but they don't mention >>. The Monad class definition is this: m >> k = m >>= \_ -> k
 which in the [] instance would translate to this: concat (map (\_ -> k) m)
 which is of course not equivalent to flip constXthey produce an obviously different results for, say, [1..5] >> return 1. But it's not clear to me whether this default definition is a law that instances of Monad must respect, or just a default implementation that satisfies some other law that the flip const implementation would also satisfy. Intuitively, given the intent of the list monad ("nondeterministic computations"), it seems like the alternative definition of >> would be just as good, if not better thanks to pruning branches that are guaranteed to be equal down to just one. Or another way of saying this is that if we were dealing with sets instead of lists, the two candidate definitions would be equivalent. But am I missing some subtlety here that makes the flip const definition wrong for lists? EDIT: ehird's answer catches a very obvious flaw with the above, which is that it gets the wrong intended result for [] >> k, which should be [], not k. Still, I think the question can be amended to this definition: [] >> k = []
_ >> k = k
@CODE:>> instance  Monad []  where
    m >>= k          = concat (map k m)
    m >> k           = k                 -- a.k.a. flip const

We'd like to have the following rules: If an interface has been implemented only once, then add it automatically using the builder.RegisterAssemblyTypes (see below). Otherwise, we need to make sure to manually write the rule that will decide which implementation is the 'default' implementation. I have the following code: var builder = new ContainerBuilder();
builder.RegisterAssemblyTypes(Assembly
    .Load("Lunch.Service")).As(t => t.GetInterfaces()[0]);
builder.RegisterType<ConsoleLoggerService>()
    .As<ILoggerService>().SingleInstance();
builder.RegisterModule(new DestinationModule());
builder.RegisterType<TransportationService>()
    .As<ITransportationService>().PropertiesAutowired();
 Right now, it's working, but it decides which the first implementation is and will automatically create that. We'd like to make that a manual process and have an error thrown if we don't manually create the 'rule'. Is this possible?

 Where bg_tran == #A0000000. However I'd rather have it in XML as I use this for several different custom dialog classes. Using just android:background does not work. Nor setting the theme to @android:style/Theme.Translucent worked. I found several articles talking about using the attribute android:windowBackground. However the android:windowBackground attribute does not exist. Meaning eclipse doesn't show me it as an option for auto complete. I've checked within my style sheet and my actual layout.xml. Since I'm compiling for 2.2 I thought that the issue and changed build target to 4.0.3. No fix. I've even tried explicitly using it anyway but it doesn't work. I searched the Android Dev website and can't even find the page which describes this attribute. Aside from occasionally mentioning in passing, there's nothing. Also looking up setBackgroundDrawableResource doesn't tell me what the equivalent XML attribute tag is. I'm incredibly confused. What am I missing? Stack overflow references I used to learn above: Transparent Dialog Theme Android Dialog Transparent How to make a custom dialog transparent Update: In case it wasn't clear, yes I've tried setting this up within a theme.

EDIT/UPDATE: I'm still pulling my hair out on this one, so I decided to look into Url.Content code-base and I noticed that it checks if the URL has been re-written (true) and if so it makes the path relevant, which in turn does not give me the absolute URL:     if (!PathHelpers._urlRewriterHelper.WasRequestRewritten(httpContext))

It does not work in these cases: When I read from the deployed file If I copy the deployed file to another location and read from there It does work in these cases: If I write a file from scratch and read from that one. If I create my own file and then copy the content from the deployed file into my created file. I find this very strange. Is there someone out there recognizing this? /Ludwig

I've tried to do this by checking the number of processes that have the same name (Process.GetProcessesByName), but then I can't differ the two.

@CONTENT:I need to upload some DATA inside and FTP server. Following stackoverflow posts on how to upload a FILE inside and FTP everything works. Now i am trying to improve my upload. Instead collecting the DATA, writing them to a FILE and then upload the file inside the FTP i want to collect the DATA and upload them without creating a local file. To achieve this i do the following: string uri = "ftp://" + ftpServerIp + "/" + fileToUpload.Name;
System.Net.FtpWebRequest reqFTP;
// Create FtpWebRequest object from the Uri provided
reqFTP = (FtpWebRequest)FtpWebRequest.Create(new Uri("ftp://" + ftpServerIp + "/" + fileToUpload.Name));
// Provide the WebPermission Credintials
reqFTP.Credentials = new NetworkCredential(ftpUserID, ftpPassword);
// By default KeepAlive is true, where the control connection is not closed after a command is executed.
reqFTP.KeepAlive = false;
// Specify the command to be executed.
reqFTP.Method = WebRequestMethods.Ftp.UploadFile;
// Specify the data transfer type.
reqFTP.UseBinary = true;
byte[] messageContent = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(message);
// Notify the server about the size of the uploaded file
reqFTP.ContentLength = messageContent.Length;
int buffLength = 2048;
// Stream to which the file to be upload is written
Stream strm = reqFTP.GetRequestStream();
// Write Content from the file stream to the FTP Upload Stream
int total_bytes = (int)messageContent.Length;
while (total_bytes > 0)
{
    strm.Write(messageContent, 0, buffLength);
    total_bytes = total_bytes - buffLength;
}
strm.Close();
 Now what happen is the following: i see the client connecting to the server the file is created no data are transferred at some point the thread is terminated the connection is closed if i inspect the uploaded file is empty. the DATA i want to to transfer is a STRING TYPE, that is why i do byte[] messageContent = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(message); what am i doing wrong? moreover: if i encode date with ASCII.GetBytes, on the remote server will i have a TEXT file or a file with some Bytes? thank you for any suggestion

@TITLE:Pure high-bit multiplication in assembly?
@CONTENT:To implement real numbers between 0 and 1, one usually uses ANSI floats or doubles. But fixed precision numbers between 0 and 1 (decimals modulo 1) can be efficiently implemented as 32 bit integers or 16 bit words, which add like normal integers/words, but which multiply the "wrong way", meaning that when you multiply X times Y, you keep the high order bits of the product. This is equivalent to multiplying 0.X and 0.Y, where all the bits of X are behind the decimal point. Likewise, signed numbers between -1 and 1 are also implementable this way with one extra bit and a shift. How would one implement fixed-precision mod 1 or mod 2 in C (especially using MMX or SSE)? I think this representation could be useful for efficient representation of unitary matrices, for numerically intensive physics simulations. It makes for more MMX/SSE to have integer quantities, but you need higher level access to PMULHW.

I've accomplished this, but the problem I'm encountering is that the list items below the clicked one are shifting. This code is provided in the fiddle (commented out). The solution I'm attempting to implement will set each list item's position to absolute and left and right to it's current position within the ordered list once the page is loaded. I don't know if I'm having trouble because I misunderstand what .each() does, or just how to implement it. Thanks. EDIT: The problem is that each list item's left and top values are being set to 0, so they're all just overlapping on at the top left. If you uncomment the jQuery, you'll see the problem. EDIT 2: I discovered that if I don't set the position to absolute at the same time that I set the left and top properties, it works properly.

If we substitute in listValue="#this[0].class" we see what we would expect: class java.util.Date Creating a new Date behaves as expected, and calling the deprecated properties of Date such as listValue="#this[0].day" produces the expected output. Why must I use the redundant expression new java.util.Date(#this[0].time) instead of #this[0] in this select statement? Using Struts 2.3.1.2

@TITLE:CLLocationmanager: Save battery
@CONTENT:My new "app in progress" uses an instance of CLLocationManager for several purposes. To make the app as battery-friendly as possible, the location services should be activated only if needed, and deactivated immediately when the data refresh is done. For my purpose it's perfectly enough to fetch the location data only once in 10 seconds. (Haven't yet decided the exact interval length). My question is, which is the most battery-efficient method of "turning off the Location services"? Is it sufficient to just use the "stopUpdatingLocation" method and keep the CLLocationManager himself in memory, or am I required to release the entire instance, and allocate a new one before the next refresh?

@CONTENT:I'm coding a countdown with jQuery countdown plugin. I only want it to show active ('non-zero') periods, e.g. instead of time left: 0 Days, 0 Hours, 13 Minutes, 20 Seconds it should only show 13 Minutes, 20 Seconds. My code is: $('#countdown').countdown({

    layout:'{d<}{dn} {dl} and {d>}{h<}{hn} {hl}, {h>}{m<}{mnn} {ml}, {m>}{s<}{snn}{sl}{s>}'
});
 But the problem is that with this code it hides the 'Days' period, but NOT the 'Hours/Minutes' So currently I get this: time left: 0 Hours, 10 Minutes, 27 Seconds What do I have to do to hide ALL zero periods? Thank you!

20
Play again?
Yes
Enter your name
Bill
...
 However, there is an issue with reading the Play again line, this is the actual output: Enter your name
John
Enter your age
20
Play again?
Enter your name
 As you can see "Enter your name" is being displayed again before "Play again?" is able to accept input. When debugging the playing variable is set to "", so there is no input that I can see and I cannot figure out what is being consumed. Any help would be appreciated, thanks!

@TITLE:Netbeans: How do I add a valueChanged listener to a JTable from the design GUI builder?
@CONTENT:I right clicked the JTable and inserted some code into "post listeners code" in an awful kludge. I don't see an option to add table.getSelectionModel().addListSelectionListener(new ListSelectionListener() {
  public void valueChanged(ListSelectionEvent evt) {
 to "events" in the "design" view for the JTable. I'm sure there's a way to add a valueChanged(ListSelectionEvent evt) from design view, but how? maybe it's a bug? Row selection change events are produced by ListSelectionModel of JTable, not by JTable itself - so the event cannot be presented in Component Inspector (as event of JTable). Handling this event must be done manually, e.g. like: jTable1.getSelectionModel().addListSelectionListener(
    new javax.swing.event.ListSelectionListener() {
        public void valueChanged(ListSelectionEvent evt) {
            customRowSelectionEventHandler(evt);
        }
    }
);
 Although maybe there's a way to get the ListSelectionModel for a JTable outside of the "blue", "managed," code?
@CODE:table.getSelectionModel().addListSelectionListener(new ListSelectionListener() {
  public void valueChanged(ListSelectionEvent evt) { jTable1.getSelectionModel().addListSelectionListener(
    new javax.swing.event.ListSelectionListener() {

        if(patternForm != null && 
            patternForm.get().windowTreatments != null &&
            patternForm.get().windowTreatments.size() >= sequence + 1)
            sequence+""
        else 
            "" 
    }
}

<input type = "text" value = @getMystring(1)></input>
...
 I was quite sure it was going to work but instead I got a "not found: value getMyString Error occurred" . Did I do something obviously wrong?
@CODE:@{
    def getMystring(sequence:Int) = {
        if(patternForm != null && 
            patternForm.get().windowTreatments != null &&
            patternForm.get().windowTreatments.size() >= sequence + 1)
            sequence+""
        else 
            "" 
    }
}

<input type = "text" value = @getMystring(1)></input>

@TITLE:Pygame display module init and quit
@CONTENT:Having a pygame.display window open, I call pygame.display.quit() upon it in order to destroy the window. Because I need to open the window again, I call pygame.display.init() and pygame.display.set_mode(), but after these two functions are called, nothing happens. Can anyone point me to the root of this problem?

 Question: Why am I not able to create view and alter view from sqlcmd, while I'm able to alter table? When I comment out the CREATE VIEW and ALTER VIEW statement, the script executed fine. Thanks!

@LINK:/questions/10464824/writing-binary-mangles-data
@TITLE:Writing binary mangles data
@CONTENT:In my application, I record audio data from an ASIO driver: void newData(void *buffer, int length)
 where buffer is the buffer pointer and length is the number of samples in that buffer. In my case, I know that the samples are 4-byte integers and the buffer contains 1024 samples every run. Now, I save these samples in two ways: little-endian binary (to be later used as a WAV file) and a text file. The text file saving words good, I get the numbers and they correspond to the samples form the waveform. But the binary file will always contain a little good data and the rest is just mangled. Original data (original sound and text saving): Mangled data (binary saving): The code (I use std::ofstream): //binary saving
tempOut.write((char *)buffer, length * 4);

//text saving
int *intBuf = (int *)buffer;
for(int i = 0; i < length; i++){
    textOut << intBuf[i];
    textOut << '\n';
}
 Note that the problem is not with synchronization, as I save the binary data first and the text data second. How the data are mangled: Original    binary (LE) binary (BE) binary to dec

@TITLE:Custom Transparent Dialog (windowBackground non-existant?)
@CONTENT:I'm attempting to create a custom dialog with a semi transparent background. I managed to get it to work through code with: getWindow().setBackgroundDrawableResource(R.color.bg_tran);
 Where bg_tran == #A0000000. However I'd rather have it in XML as I use this for several different custom dialog classes. Using just android:background does not work. Nor setting the theme to @android:style/Theme.Translucent worked. I found several articles talking about using the attribute android:windowBackground. However the android:windowBackground attribute does not exist. Meaning eclipse doesn't show me it as an option for auto complete. I've checked within my style sheet and my actual layout.xml. Since I'm compiling for 2.2 I thought that the issue and changed build target to 4.0.3. No fix. I've even tried explicitly using it anyway but it doesn't work. I searched the Android Dev website and can't even find the page which describes this attribute. Aside from occasionally mentioning in passing, there's nothing. Also looking up setBackgroundDrawableResource doesn't tell me what the equivalent XML attribute tag is. I'm incredibly confused. What am I missing? Stack overflow references I used to learn above: Transparent Dialog Theme Android Dialog Transparent How to make a custom dialog transparent Update: In case it wasn't clear, yes I've tried setting this up within a theme. Does not work. Here's my defined theme: <style name="my_dialog_theme" parent="@android:style/Theme.Dialog">

 Which seems to work fine, however in my ASP.Net MVC 3 app I have several @Url.Content("~/") entries which are resolving to /store/ as the root as opposed to /. A typical url would be http://mysite.com/store/99/coats-with-hoods for example. EDIT/UPDATE: I'm still pulling my hair out on this one, so I decided to look into Url.Content code-base and I noticed that it checks if the URL has been re-written (true) and if so it makes the path relevant, which in turn does not give me the absolute URL:     if (!PathHelpers._urlRewriterHelper.WasRequestRewritten(httpContext))
      return contentPath;
    string relativePath = PathHelpers.MakeRelative(httpContext.Request.Path, contentPath);
    return PathHelpers.MakeAbsolute(httpContext.Request.RawUrl, relativePath);
 Anyone know why this would be? I'm a bit confused as to why this is happening and how I can account for it in my application?

@TITLE:Bash: Concatenating strings fails when read from certain files

version=[version number]
build=[buildnumber]
//other content
 I want to create a variable that looks like this: version-buildnumber Here is my script for it: VERSION_FILE=myfile

BUILDNUMBER_LINE=$(grep "build=" $VERSION_FILE)
BUILDNUMBER=${BUILDNUMBER_LINE#$"build="}

 The strange thing is that this works in some cases but not in others. The problem I get is when I am trying to concatenate the strings (i.e. the last line above). In some cases it works perfectly, but in others characters from one string replace the characters from the other instead of being placed afterwards. It does not work in these cases: When I read from the deployed file If I copy the deployed file to another location and read from there It does work in these cases: If I write a file from scratch and read from that one. If I create my own file and then copy the content from the deployed file into my created file. I find this very strange. Is there someone out there recognizing this? /Ludwig

@CONTENT:I am using .NET with C#. I want to prevent two instances of the same executable to run at the same time, but I don't want to prevent the same process that is run from another folder. For example, I have an executable that is in two different locations: C:\MyProject\Master\Program.exe C:\MyProject\Slave\Program.exe These are the same .exe files, but in two different locations. I want to allow one instance of Program.exe that is run from Master folder and one instance from the Slave folder, but no two of any. I've tried to do this by checking the number of processes that have the same name (Process.GetProcessesByName), but then I can't differ the two. The closest I have found is to get the Modules from the Process. The first one in the list is ProcessModule of the exe. But I am not sure if this will always be the first one on the list. Is there any guarantee for that, or is there a better solution to the explained problem?

@TITLE:c# upload a byte[] inside an FTP server
@CONTENT:I need to upload some DATA inside and FTP server. Following stackoverflow posts on how to upload a FILE inside and FTP everything works. Now i am trying to improve my upload. Instead collecting the DATA, writing them to a FILE and then upload the file inside the FTP i want to collect the DATA and upload them without creating a local file. To achieve this i do the following: string uri = "ftp://" + ftpServerIp + "/" + fileToUpload.Name;
System.Net.FtpWebRequest reqFTP;
// Create FtpWebRequest object from the Uri provided
reqFTP = (FtpWebRequest)FtpWebRequest.Create(new Uri("ftp://" + ftpServerIp + "/" + fileToUpload.Name));
// Provide the WebPermission Credintials
reqFTP.Credentials = new NetworkCredential(ftpUserID, ftpPassword);
// By default KeepAlive is true, where the control connection is not closed after a command is executed.
reqFTP.KeepAlive = false;
// Specify the command to be executed.
reqFTP.Method = WebRequestMethods.Ftp.UploadFile;
// Specify the data transfer type.
reqFTP.UseBinary = true;
byte[] messageContent = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(message);
// Notify the server about the size of the uploaded file
reqFTP.ContentLength = messageContent.Length;
int buffLength = 2048;
// Stream to which the file to be upload is written
Stream strm = reqFTP.GetRequestStream();
// Write Content from the file stream to the FTP Upload Stream
int total_bytes = (int)messageContent.Length;
while (total_bytes > 0)
{
    strm.Write(messageContent, 0, buffLength);
    total_bytes = total_bytes - buffLength;
}
strm.Close();
 Now what happen is the following: i see the client connecting to the server the file is created no data are transferred at some point the thread is terminated the connection is closed if i inspect the uploaded file is empty. the DATA i want to to transfer is a STRING TYPE, that is why i do byte[] messageContent = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(message); what am i doing wrong? moreover: if i encode date with ASCII.GetBytes, on the remote server will i have a TEXT file or a file with some Bytes? thank you for any suggestion
@CODE:string uri = "ftp://" + ftpServerIp + "/" + fileToUpload.Name;
System.Net.FtpWebRequest reqFTP;
// Create FtpWebRequest object from the Uri provided
reqFTP = (FtpWebRequest)FtpWebRequest.Create(new Uri("ftp://" + ftpServerIp + "/" + fileToUpload.Name));
// Provide the WebPermission Credintials
reqFTP.Credentials = new NetworkCredential(ftpUserID, ftpPassword);
// By default KeepAlive is true, where the control connection is not closed after a command is executed.
reqFTP.KeepAlive = false;
// Specify the command to be executed.
reqFTP.Method = WebRequestMethods.Ftp.UploadFile;
// Specify the data transfer type.
reqFTP.UseBinary = true;
byte[] messageContent = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(message);
// Notify the server about the size of the uploaded file
reqFTP.ContentLength = messageContent.Length;
int buffLength = 2048;
// Stream to which the file to be upload is written
Stream strm = reqFTP.GetRequestStream();
// Write Content from the file stream to the FTP Upload Stream
int total_bytes = (int)messageContent.Length;
while (total_bytes > 0)
{
    strm.Write(messageContent, 0, buffLength);
    total_bytes = total_bytes - buffLength;
}
strm.Close();

@TITLE:Pure high-bit multiplication in assembly?
@CONTENT:To implement real numbers between 0 and 1, one usually uses ANSI floats or doubles. But fixed precision numbers between 0 and 1 (decimals modulo 1) can be efficiently implemented as 32 bit integers or 16 bit words, which add like normal integers/words, but which multiply the "wrong way", meaning that when you multiply X times Y, you keep the high order bits of the product. This is equivalent to multiplying 0.X and 0.Y, where all the bits of X are behind the decimal point. Likewise, signed numbers between -1 and 1 are also implementable this way with one extra bit and a shift. How would one implement fixed-precision mod 1 or mod 2 in C (especially using MMX or SSE)? I think this representation could be useful for efficient representation of unitary matrices, for numerically intensive physics simulations. It makes for more MMX/SSE to have integer quantities, but you need higher level access to PMULHW.

@TITLE:I'm having difficulty with jQuery's $(selector).each()
@CONTENT:Example here: http://jsfiddle.net/KyW6c/2/ I have an ordered list. Each list item is a project in my portfolio. I'm writing some jQuery that will move a clicked list item up to the top left of the ordered list. I've accomplished this, but the problem I'm encountering is that the list items below the clicked one are shifting. This code is provided in the fiddle (commented out). The solution I'm attempting to implement will set each list item's position to absolute and left and right to it's current position within the ordered list once the page is loaded. I don't know if I'm having trouble because I misunderstand what .each() does, or just how to implement it. Thanks. EDIT: The problem is that each list item's left and top values are being set to 0, so they're all just overlapping on at the top left. If you uncomment the jQuery, you'll see the problem. EDIT 2: I discovered that if I don't set the position to absolute at the same time that I set the left and top properties, it works properly.

@TITLE:Strange OGNL behaviour when using #this in s:select
@CONTENT:Consider the following where availableExclusions is an array of Date objects. <s:select listValue="(new java.text.SimpleDateFormat('MM/dd/yyyy')).format(new java.util.Date(#this[0].time))" size="25" id="inputExclusionDates" name="available" list="availableExclusions" multiple="true" cssClass="multi-select" />
 I created the above in response to this question How would I format a list of dates within a struts 2 select tag? (and I also recommended that the other solution may be the better way to go). Regardless if using such long OGNL expression is a good idea or not, I can't see the need for: new java.util.Date(#this[0].time) despite creating that fragment out of frustration and to my surprise found it worked where the seemingly equivalent #this[0] did not (produced no output). If we substitute in listValue="#this[0].class" we see what we would expect: class java.util.Date Creating a new Date behaves as expected, and calling the deprecated properties of Date such as listValue="#this[0].day" produces the expected output. Why must I use the redundant expression new java.util.Date(#this[0].time) instead of #this[0] in this select statement? Using Struts 2.3.1.2
@CODE:<s:select listValue="(new java.text.SimpleDateFormat('MM/dd/yyyy')).format(new java.util.Date(#this[0].time))" size="25" id="inputExclusionDates" name="available" list="availableExclusions" multiple="true" cssClass="multi-select" /> new java.util.Date(#this[0].time) #this[0] listValue="#this[0].class" class java.util.Date listValue="#this[0].day" new java.util.Date(#this[0].time) #this[0]

@TITLE:GetTotalMemory allocation in C
@CONTENT:I would like to get the total memory allocated before and after I call a function in order to determine if I have freed everything correctly or not. I'm doing this in C and I'm very rusty so forgive me if this is a naive question. I'm looking for something similar to the C# GC.GetTotalMemory(true) and this is in Windows for now. Right now I am using PROCESS_MEMORY_COUNTERS_EX and GetProcessMemoryInfo(...), before and after calling the function but I can't make heads or tails of the output because if I go into the function and comment out a call to free(...) then it will give me the same results (after is always larger). Here is what I have right now... GetProcessMemoryInfo(hProc, &before, sizeof(before));
r = c->function();
GetProcessMemoryInfo(hProc, &after, sizeof(after));

if(r->result != 0) {
    printf("error: %s\r\n", c->name);
    printf("  %s\r\n", r->message);
    printf("  %s (%d)\r\n", r->file, r->line);
    failed++;
}
else if(after.PrivateUsage > before.PrivateUsage) {
    printf("memory leak: %s\r\n", c->name);
    printf("  %d kb\r\n", after.PrivateUsage - before.PrivateUsage);
    failed++;
}
else succeeded++;
 With a result like this: after.PrivateUsage - before.PrivateUsage = 12288
 If I go and comment out some calls to free I get the same result. How can I actually determine the current total size of memory that I have allocated using malloc?
@CODE:PROCESS_MEMORY_COUNTERS_EX GetProcessMemoryInfo(...) free(...) GetProcessMemoryInfo(hProc, &before, sizeof(before));
r = c->function();
GetProcessMemoryInfo(hProc, &after, sizeof(after));

if(r->result != 0) {
    printf("error: %s\r\n", c->name);
    printf("  %s\r\n", r->message);

My question is, which is the most battery-efficient method of "turning off the Location services"?

    expiryUrl:'index.php?show=main', 
    expiryText: 'EXPIRED', 
    until: timeleft, 
    layout:'{d<}{dn} {dl} and {d>}{h<}{hn} {hl}, {h>}{m<}{mnn} {ml}, {m>}{s<}{snn}{sl}{s>}'
});

@TITLE:Filter items that only occurs once in a very large list
@CONTENT:I have a large list(over 1,000,000 items), which contains english words: tokens = ["today", "good", "computer", "people", "good", ... ]
 I'd like to get all the items that occurs only once in the list now I'm using: tokens_once = set(word for word in set(tokens) if tokens.count(word) == 1)
 but it's really slow. how could I make this faster?

@TITLE:Simple Java Scanner code not working [duplicate]
@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: Scanner issue when using nextLine after nextXXX [duplicate] Here is the skeleton of some basic code I am writing to make a simple game:     Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);

    String name;
    String playing;
    int age;

    do {

        System.out.println("Enter your name");
        name = in.nextLine();

        System.out.println("Enter your age");
        age = in.nextInt();

        System.out.println("Play again?");
        playing = in.nextLine();

    } while (true);
 The code does not work as expected, for example, here is the expected functioning of the code: Enter your name
John
Enter your age
20
Play again?
Yes
Enter your name
Bill
...
 However, there is an issue with reading the Play again line, this is the actual output: Enter your name
John
Enter your age
20
Play again?
Enter your name
 As you can see "Enter your name" is being displayed again before "Play again?" is able to accept input. When debugging the playing variable is set to "", so there is no input that I can see and I cannot figure out what is being consumed. Any help would be appreciated, thanks!

  Console.WriteLine(new_doc.DocNumber + " vs " + doc.DocNumber);
 the output message is : -1 vs 0.i can't believe this result(the correct result is 0 vs 0),so i change the doc.DocNumber = 0 to doc.DocNumber = 1, the output is correct: 1 vs 1. this problem means i can't assign the zero to the DocNumber property,in the constructure method of the Document i must be declare the DocNumber property is -1. someone can help me? this problem is my cause or the protobuf-net cause? thanks.

@TITLE:Netbeans: How do I add a valueChanged listener to a JTable from the design GUI builder?
@CONTENT:I right clicked the JTable and inserted some code into "post listeners code" in an awful kludge. I don't see an option to add table.getSelectionModel().addListSelectionListener(new ListSelectionListener() {
  public void valueChanged(ListSelectionEvent evt) {
 to "events" in the "design" view for the JTable. I'm sure there's a way to add a valueChanged(ListSelectionEvent evt) from design view, but how? maybe it's a bug? Row selection change events are produced by ListSelectionModel of JTable, not by JTable itself - so the event cannot be presented in Component Inspector (as event of JTable). Handling this event must be done manually, e.g. like: jTable1.getSelectionModel().addListSelectionListener(
    new javax.swing.event.ListSelectionListener() {
        public void valueChanged(ListSelectionEvent evt) {
            customRowSelectionEventHandler(evt);
        }
    }
);
 Although maybe there's a way to get the ListSelectionModel for a JTable outside of the "blue", "managed," code?
@CODE:table.getSelectionModel().addListSelectionListener(new ListSelectionListener() {
  public void valueChanged(ListSelectionEvent evt) { jTable1.getSelectionModel().addListSelectionListener(
    new javax.swing.event.ListSelectionListener() {
        public void valueChanged(ListSelectionEvent evt) {
            customRowSelectionEventHandler(evt);
        }
    }
); .form GroupLayout

@TITLE:Playframework 2.0 define function in View Template
@CONTENT:I am working on a project using PlayFramework 2.0. After reading a bit of scala I would like to embed some dynamic code in the View template. So, I did the following: @{
    def getMystring(sequence:Int) = {
        if(patternForm != null && 
            patternForm.get().windowTreatments != null &&

    }
}

<input type = "text" value = @getMystring(1)></input>

 I was quite sure it was going to work but instead I got a "not found: value getMyString Error occurred" . Did I do something obviously wrong?

@TITLE:Writing binary mangles data
@CONTENT:In my application, I record audio data from an ASIO driver: void newData(void *buffer, int length)
 where buffer is the buffer pointer and length is the number of samples in that buffer. In my case, I know that the samples are 4-byte integers and the buffer contains 1024 samples every run. Now, I save these samples in two ways: little-endian binary (to be later used as a WAV file) and a text file. The text file saving words good, I get the numbers and they correspond to the samples form the waveform. But the binary file will always contain a little good data and the rest is just mangled. Original data (original sound and text saving): Mangled data (binary saving): The code (I use std::ofstream): //binary saving
tempOut.write((char *)buffer, length * 4);

//text saving
int *intBuf = (int *)buffer;
for(int i = 0; i < length; i++){
    textOut << intBuf[i];
    textOut << '\n';
}
 Note that the problem is not with synchronization, as I save the binary data first and the text data second. How the data are mangled: Original    binary (LE) binary (BE) binary to dec

 The FormMain has a backgroundWorker object. This backgroundworker is the one who does most part of the app and if there is an exception in doWork method, it is not propogated as I expect it to .. Here is code for the backgroundworker that I use in my MainForm.  private void button_startSync_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
 {            
     backgroundWorker1.RunWorkerAsync(getSettings());\          
 }

  private void backgroundWorker1_DoWork(object sender, DoWorkEventArgs e)
  {        

     // ... processing code
     // Unhandled Exception will generated in this method...           
  }
 Please advise what am I doing wrong here, I want exceptions generated anywhere in my program being caught into those global handlers above, so that the erro/exceptions be reported back for fixing.. Thanks,

 why did they create a new Type aka GroupedEnumerable ?

@TITLE:Finding an increasing sequence a[] which minimizes sigma(abs(a[i]+c[i]))
@CONTENT:Problem statement c is a given array of n integers; the problem is to find an increasing array of n integers a (a[i] <= a[i+1]) such that this sum is minimized: abs(a[0]+c[0]) + abs(a[1]+c[1]) + ... + abs(a[n-1]+c[n-1])
// abs(x) = absolute value of x  
 An optimal a exists only made by integers appeared in c so we can solve it using DP in O(n^2): dp[i][j]: a[i] >= j'th integer  
 But there should be a faster solution, probably O(n lg n).

@TITLE:Java: use Enumeration multiple times
@CONTENT:I work with DefaultMutableTreeNode, and it has methods depthFirstEnumeration(), breadthFirstEnumeration() and children() that return Enumeration of tree nodes. I need to use the returned Enumeration multiple times, but I can't find any method like reset() in Enumeration. It seems like I only can get all the elements just once, and then call depthFirstEnumeration() again to get new Enumeration, it seems not to be a good solution. Of course, I can get all the elements from Enumeration and convert it to any another reusable representation, but is there really a way to use Enumeration multiple times?

@LINK:/questions/10459258/multithreading-why-one-thread-is-doing-all-of-the-work
@TITLE:Multithreading--Why one thread is doing all of the work?
@CONTENT:I am multiplying two matrices using two threads (however, the program is written to scale up as well, so I could possibly use three, four, etc threads instead). Each thread calculates/does the work for one row (or column) of the final matrix. If one thread is doing work on a row, the other one(s) should not work on that row. It/they should move on to the next available row. First of all, I am not certain if the way I implemented the problem is correct. If you can see a better way, please let me know. Secondly, the way I have done it, every time I test it (with different size matrices--even huge ones), only one thread does the work. That is, each time, the same thread is getting access to the synchronized block of the run() method. The other threads are entering the run() method, but why is only one thread always gaining the lock and doing all of the work? This is my run method:  public void run() {
    System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName());
    while (i < number of columns in final matrix) {
        synchronized (this) {
            if (i < number of columns in final matrix) {
                for (int j = 0; j < Main.B[0].length; j++) { 
                    for (int k = 0; k < Main.A[0].length; k++) { 
                        Main.C[i][j] += Main.A[i][k] * Main.B[k][j];
                    }
                }
                i++;
            }
        }
    }
} 
 This is the code in my driver class that creates the threads and starts the program: MyRunnable r = new MyRunnable();
Thread thread1 = new Thread(r);
Thread thread2 = new Thread(r);
thread1.start();
thread2.start();

try {
    thread1.join();
    thread2.join();
    } catch (InterruptedException ie) {
        System.out.println("\nThe following error occurred: " + ie);
        }
    }
 I guess my question is two-fold--is my approach correct for the problem at hand? If so, (and if not), why is one thread always grabbing the lock and doing all of the work? I have checked the program with up to 6 threads on 20x20 matrices and always only one thread is doing the work.
@CODE:public void run() {
    System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName());
    while (i < number of columns in final matrix) {
        synchronized (this) {
            if (i < number of columns in final matrix) {
                for (int j = 0; j < Main.B[0].length; j++) { 
                    for (int k = 0; k < Main.A[0].length; k++) { 
                        Main.C[i][j] += Main.A[i][k] * Main.B[k][j];
                    }
                }
                i++;
            }
        }
    }
} MyRunnable r = new MyRunnable();
Thread thread1 = new Thread(r);
Thread thread2 = new Thread(r);
thread1.start();

try {
    thread1.join();
    thread2.join();

@CONTENT:I want to be able to input java commands/code to execute during run-time (during the execution of a "persistent" program) in the same way, or as close as possible, to the same code would be executed if it was present on the source-code for the program (programmed as part of the software), using a GUI element, like jTextArea. The following StackOverflow questions seem to be related, but, along with they'r answers, don't seem to be what i'm looking for. How To Get Input From Console Class In Java? Using GUI for console input and outputin java I don't want to "be able to trigger actions from specific console inputs, and print the feedback into the console", as seems to be the case of console applications described in those question and answers. What i want is to "be able to execute actual java code, that i cannot predict nor control, from console (or GUI) input". NOTE: The "i cannot predict nor control" here refers to the "developer"...But of course i can predict and "control" it if i'm the one inputting the code, as the "user" would do. Since java uses a virtual-machine environment, i think it might be possible for it to execute "run-time inputted code"...But i'm not sure such thing is even possible. For example, i'd like the run-time input of for(int i=0; i<3; i++){System.out.println(i);} in the "GUI console" (jTextArea, for example) to, upon pressing the enter key or clicking a "Send" button, be ("compiled and "?) executed, and give the same output as if it was part of the original source-code, thus: 0

@LINK:/questions/10425173/make-a-list-of-lm-objects-retain-their-class
@TITLE:make a list of lm objects, retain their class
@CONTENT:Apologies for such a rudimentary question--I must be missing something obvious. I want to build a list of lm objects, which I'm then going to use in an llply call to perform mediation analysis on this list. But this is immaterial--I just first want to make a list of length m (where m is the set of models) and each element within m will itself contain n lm objects. So in this simple example d1 <- data.frame(x1 = runif(100, 0, 1),
             x2 = runif(100, 0, 1),
             x3 = runif(100, 0, 1),
             y1 = runif(100, 0, 1),
             y2 = runif(100, 0, 1),
             y3 = runif(100, 0, 1))

m1 <- lm(y1 ~ x1 + x2 + x3, data = d1)
m2 <- lm(x1 ~ x2 + x3, data = d1)
m3 <- lm(y2 ~ x1 + x2 + x3, data = d1)
m4 <- lm(x2 ~ x1 + x3, data = d1)
m5 <- lm(y3 ~ y1 + y2 + x3, data = d1)
m6 <- lm(x3 ~ x1 + x2, data = d1)
 I want a list containing 3 elements, and the first element will contain m1 and m2, the second will contain m3 and m4, etc. My initial attempt is sort of right, but the lmm objects don't retain their class. mlist <- list(c(m1,m2),
              c(m3,m4),
              c(m5,m6))
 It has the right length (ie length(mlist) equals 3), but I thought I could access the lm object itself with class(mlist[1][[1]])
 but this element is apparently a list. Am I screwing up how I build the list in the first step, or is this something more fundamental regarding lm objects?
@CODE:lm llply lm d1 <- data.frame(x1 = runif(100, 0, 1),
             x2 = runif(100, 0, 1),
             x3 = runif(100, 0, 1),
             y1 = runif(100, 0, 1),
             y2 = runif(100, 0, 1),
             y3 = runif(100, 0, 1))

m1 <- lm(y1 ~ x1 + x2 + x3, data = d1)
m2 <- lm(x1 ~ x2 + x3, data = d1)
m3 <- lm(y2 ~ x1 + x2 + x3, data = d1)
m4 <- lm(x2 ~ x1 + x3, data = d1)
m5 <- lm(y3 ~ y1 + y2 + x3, data = d1)
m6 <- lm(x3 ~ x1 + x2, data = d1) m1 m2 m3 m4 mlist <- list(c(m1,m2),
              c(m3,m4),
              c(m5,m6)) length(mlist) lm class(mlist[1][[1]])

@TITLE:Interpreting base 64 in C# from an image based via JSON/PHP (base64_encode)
@CONTENT:So I'm able to read an image file successfully, and pass it back to my C# application but I'm unable to decode it properly. I'm returning the JSON data as such (the json_encode function isn't shown) via PHP:         $imgbinary = fread(fopen($filename, "r"), filesize($filename));

        if ( strlen($imgbinary) > 0 ){
            return array("success"=>true, "map"=>base64_encode($imgbinary));
        }
 Then in C# I use Newtonsoft.Json to decode the string (I can read success and the map properties successfully), but I'm unable to then use base64 decode to properly write the image to a file (or to display). I'm doing it as such: File.WriteAllText(System.Windows.Forms.Application.StartupPath + "\\MyDir\\" + FileName, Base64Decode(FileData));

    {
        byte[] binary = Convert.FromBase64String(data);
        return Encoding.Default.GetString(binary);
    }
 Am I missing something crazy simple here? What is really strange is after I decode the data, the file size is LARGER than the original file. (I realize once you encode, data increases by about 33%, just strange that after I then decode, it is still larger). Any help/pointers would be greatly appreciated!

@TITLE:Fastest possible byte array concatenation method
@CONTENT:I got a map containing n parts of a message as a byte array. After the last piece has found his way into the map, the message has to be concatenated. I found two solutions which should meet the requirements. First one is using System.arraycopy: public byte[] getMessageBytes() throws IOException {
    byte[] bytes = new byte[0];
    for (final Map.Entry<Short,byte[]> entry : myMap.entrySet()) {
        byte[] entryBytes = entry.getValue();

        System.arraycopy(bytes, 0, temp, 0, bytes.length);
        System.arraycopy(entryBytes, 0, temp, bytes.length, entryBytes.length);
        bytes = temp;
    }
    return bytes;
}
 And second one is using ByteArrayOutputStream: public byte[] getMessageBytes() throws IOException {
    final ByteArrayOutputStream baos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
    for (final Map.Entry<Short,byte[]> entry : myMap.entrySet()) {
        baos.write(entry.getValue());
    }
    baos.flush();
    return baos.toByteArray();
}
 What is the better method seen from the angle of performance and memory usage? Is there an alternative way of doing the concatenation which is even better?
@CODE:public byte[] getMessageBytes() throws IOException {
    byte[] bytes = new byte[0];
    for (final Map.Entry<Short,byte[]> entry : myMap.entrySet()) {

The first query is in my posts collection and looks like this: $query = array('rating' => array('$gte' => 6, '$lt' => 9), 'comments.upVotes' => array('$gt' => 2, '$lt' => 20));
 I selects the author.$id field which is the reference to the authors collection. I then put all the $ids in a array as such: while ($cursor->hasNext()): $document = $cursor->getNext();
    $authorID[] = $document['_id'];
endwhile;
 and then I try to find the correct number with this query in the authors collection $query2 = array('age' => array('$gte' => 19, '$lt' =>100), '_id' => array('$in' => $authorID));
$cursor = q('author')->find($query2);
 I try to get the total number with this code: $count = $cursor->count(); but no matter what query I try to run I always get the result 0. What am I doing wrong and can is it possible at all to create this kind of query or do I have to make it on application level instead of database level? And Im well aware of embedded documents, but I want to have these two collections separated and not embed it. Hope anyone can help me with this. Sincere - Mestika

I have tried adding onclick java to the link, but in each case it simply submits the form in a non-ajax way (page refresh). The ajax form currently works fine with using a submit button, so it's got to be something small... Thanks!

@CONTENT:I'm sorry the TITLE is not so specific. I'll try to explain: I'm new to SQL. I'm at work and wrote a query which has 9 columns that takes information out of many tables. on the 9th column are names of types of machines, on the 3rd are value representing the time a machine worked in a month. I need to add a 10th column which will have for each type of machine, the maximum of 3rd columns for this type. lets say there are 5 machines of type XR (5 rows in the table) with times (3rd column) of 1,2,3,4,5 (in hours). I need that on the 10th column, all rows where type of machine is XR will have the value 5, as it is the maximum for this type of machine. How do i do that? Any help would be very appreciated!!

The app install will fail if it is not enabled. SO everytime before reinstall i want to enable this component. I am talking about the reinstall before publishing in market.

@TITLE:Core Plot - How to convert touch point to plot point in a plot space with log axis
@CONTENT:I have a scatter plot with a linear y axis and logarithmic x axis, all of which works great. But when I try to convert a touch point into the plot space coordinates, I'm having problems. I have seen something like the following suggested various places: - (BOOL)plotSpace:(CPTPlotSpace *)space shouldHandlePointingDeviceUpEvent:(id)event atPoint:(CGPoint)point
{
CPTXYPlotSpace *plotSpace = (CPTXYPlotSpace *)space;

CPTScatterPlot *scatterPlot = [[[plotSpace graph] allPlots] objectAtIndex:0]; 
CGPoint plotAreaPoint = [[plotSpace graph] convertPoint:point toLayer:scatterPlot];

NSLog(@"PlotAreaPoint : %.1f, %.1f", plotAreaPoint.x, plotAreaPoint.y);

NSDecimal dataPoint[2];
NSDecimalNumber *xCoordinate, *yCoordinate;

[plotSpace plotPoint:dataPoint forPlotAreaViewPoint:plotAreaPoint];

xCoordinate = [NSDecimalNumber decimalNumberWithDecimal:dataPoint[0]];
yCoordinate = [NSDecimalNumber decimalNumberWithDecimal:dataPoint[1]];

NSLog(@"DataPoint : %.1f, %.1f", [xCoordinate floatValue], [yCoordinate floatValue]);

return YES;
}
 When I run this, plotAreaPoint seems correct, and yCoordinate is correct. xCoordinate is correct if I tap at the left edge (5.0) or right edge (500.0), but behaves like a linear axis if I tap in the middle. If I tap in the very middle, I get 250.0 or so, instead of 50.0. Am I missing something, or is there another way to do this? Thanks, Tim

@TITLE:How to get the language name in native language?
@CONTENT:This is my first time using ICU API, and I'm having a very hard time trying to find out something that I assumed to be very simple: to get a given locale/language name in the native language (instead of in English) Examples: fr    -> Fran?ais
en    -> English
pt_BR -> Portugu?s Brasileiro, or "Portugu?s (Brasil)"
es_ES -> Espa?ol Iberico, or "Espa?ol (Espa?a)"
 As a reference, in babel I can get a given locale name in any language, native being the default: >>> import babel
>>> locale = babel.Locale.parse('pt_BR')
>>> locale.get_display_name()
portugu?s (Brasil)
>>> locale.get_display_name('fr')
portugais (Br?sil)
>>> locale.get_display_name('en')
Portuguese (Brazil)
 So, how to do the same in ICU? Examples in python are most welcome, since I'm using PyICU, but Java/C/C++ is fine too, since my problem is with the API, and not the language. Thanks!
@CODE:fr    -> Fran?ais

@TITLE:Skipping Blank Excel Cells in Apache POI
@CONTENT:I'm new to the Apache POI, but what I want to do is read though an Excel file (.xls) and put that into a ArrayList to store so that I can later manipulate. I can get the whole sheet, but my problem is just that: I get the whole dang sheet (~54183 rows). I want to skip over the cells that are blank, which is of type 3. For some reason, when I system.out.print the ArrayList, it has all the blank cells in there. Is there a way to skip over those and not add them to the ArrayList I'm trying to create? I have the following bit of code: public ArrayList readExcelFile(String filePath) throws IOException {
    ArrayList cellVectorHolder = new ArrayList();
    try {
        FileInputStream inputFile = new FileInputStream(filePath);
        POIFSFileSystem myFileSystem = new POIFSFileSystem(inputFile);
        HSSFWorkbook wkbk = new HSSFWorkbook(myFileSystem);
        wb = wkbk;
        for (int i = 0; i < wb.getNumberOfSheets(); i++) {
            HSSFSheet wkSheet = wkbk.getSheetAt(i);
            for (Row row : wkSheet) {
                ArrayList cellVector = new ArrayList();
                for (Cell cell : row) {
                    if(cell.getCellType() != 3){
                        cellVector.add(cell);
                    }
                }
                cellVectorHolder.add(cellVector);
            }
        }
    } catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    return cellVectorHolder;
}
 Don't mind the ArrayList names...I was using Vectors until I finally discovered they were depreciated since 1.2 or something like that.

    ArrayList cellVectorHolder = new ArrayList();

@TITLE:HAML -> Backbone Template, Unescaping HTML Parameters
@CONTENT:I'm using HAML to generate templates for a Backbone.js app. I need to be able to insert <%= blah %> as an html attribute a la: %a{:href => "myresources/<% id %>"} My Resource
 and have it output <a href='myresources/<%= id %>' >My Resource</a>
 in the html template. Unfortunately, HAML escapes the html parameters leaving me with <a href='#myresources/&lt;%= id %&gt;'>My Resource</a>
 According to the HAML Reference the '!' operator can be used for unescaping strings, but not within the HTML attributes. Also, I'd use plaintext to render the anchor tag, but since the anchor tag is the root for this particular view, I lose all of the benefits of using HAML. Any help? Update I didn't mention, but I'm using LiveReload to actually watch my file system and run the haml compiler, and there was a setting in LiveReload to disable HTML escapes in tag attributes. < head slap > If anyone else runs into this issue outside of LiveReload, you can also set the :escape_attrs option to false when configuring your HAML setup.

@TITLE:Control different DataContext
@CONTENT:Control different DataContext in WPF As I can deploy multiple DataContext in different tabs and control which is the current DataContext I'm using Mvvm Light WPF4 i have the different ViewModels, View but i dont know how to handle multiples DataContext and control the current DataContext for change on tab switch Edit: I've got an approach to the solution as follows: Create a ViewModel for the MainView The tabcontrol source is a ObservableCollection Each TabItem has its own DataContext The menu has the DataContext like this: DataContext="{Binding Path=CurrentTab.DataContext}" where CurrentTab change when add new TabItem in the ViewModel i have the following problems: how do I connect the ViewModel from the TabControl when you change the tab? Solution: the problem is that Mvvm Light uses a ViewModelLocator for Binding ViewModel in static way, this is the problem when i add tab in C# the ViewModelLocator dont works, in other way i need load manually the ViewModel for each tab like this: // in MainModelView.cs

public RelayCommand MyCommand { get; set; }

private void RegisterCommand()
{
  MyCommand = new RelayCommand(() =>
  {
    AddTab("Tab Header", new TabViewModel(), new TabContentControl());
  });
}

private void AddTab(string header, object context, ContentControl content)
{
  TabItem = null;

  foreach(TabItem tab in TabItemList)
  {
    if(tab.Header.Equals(header);
    {
      tabItem = tab;
    }
  }

    if(null == tabItem)
    {
      tabItem = new TabItem();
      tabItem.Header = header;
      tabItem.Content = content;
      tabItem.DataContext = context;
      TabItemList.Add(tabItem);
    }

    CurrentTabIndex = TabItemList.IndexOf(tabItem);    
}
 2.the DataContext dont update in the menu, my code is wrong? Solution: the previous point solve this too and only with the follow code solved: // in RegisterCommands()
ChangeTabCommand = new RelayCommand<TabItem>(tab =>
{
  if (null == tab) return;
  CurrentTabContext = tab.DataContext;
}
 in MainWindow.xml:   <!-- MainWindow.xaml -->

  <Button Content="NewTab" Command="{Binding Path=MyCommand }" />

@TITLE:Serialising XForm instances as SOAPAttach attachments
@CONTENT:I wish to submit an XForms instance to a web service as a SOAPAttach attachment. However, from the XForms 1.1 specification: 11.11.3 SOAP HTTP Binding The method attribute of the submission must be set to get or post in order to access the SOAP HTTP binding. I understand this to mean that the multipart-post method (required for SOAPAttach) cannot be used with the SOAP HTTP binding? 11.9.6 Serialization as multipart/related Subsequent part requirements One part for each node with a datatype of xsd:anyURI populated by upload with: Since it explicitly states "populated by upload", I take this to mean that XML instance data or other generated content can only appear in the first body part (contrary to the requirements of SOAPAttach). Am I correct in understanding that each of these restrictions make it impossible to (natively) submit an XForms instance as such an attachment; and, therefore, that one must generate such a serialization oneself (e.g. by handling the xforms-submit-serialize event)? Is there a standard way to do so, or a library that could help?

@CONTENT:I'm using d3 to build a scatter plot and the set of values I have for the x and y axes both have positive and negative values. This is my first attempt at using d3 and I've gathered from introductory tutorials such as On the tenth day of Xmas, get dirty with data using d3.js, that the key is setting up the x and y scales correctly. Next, I found this tutorial: Bar Chart with Negative Values, which has almost helped me get it right (I think). My data set is too hefty to place here, but here is the code I have a sample of my data to work with: <div id="compareAll"></div>
<script>
window.onload = function() {

var dataSet = [ [4,4], [-4,4], [-4,-4], [4,-4], ];
var x0 = Math.max(-d3.min(dataSet[0]), d3.max(dataSet[0]));
var xScale = d3.scale.ordinal()
             .domain([-x0,x0])
             .range([0,10]);
var yScale = d3.scale.ordinal()
             .domain(d3.range(dataSet[1])
             .rangeRoundBands([0,10]);

var svg = d3.select("#compareAll")
.append("svg")
.attr("width", 10)
.attr("height",10)

svg.selectAll("circle")
.data(dataSet)
.enter()
.append("circle")
.attr("cx", function(d) {
      return xScale(d[0]); 
})
.attr("cy", function(d) {
      return yScale(d[1]); 
})
.attr("r",4); 

var xAxis = d3.svg.axis()
.scale(xScale)
.tickSize(1);

var yAxis = d3.svg.axis()
.scale(yScale)
.tickSize(1);

svg.append("svg:g")
.attr("class", "x axis")
.attr("transform", "translate(0,10)")
.call(xAxis);

svg.append("svg:g")
.attr("class", "y axis")
.attr("transform", "translate(10,0)")
.call(yAxis);

}

</script>
 Frankly, I don't understand the use of the ordinal scale in the Bar Chart example, however I got seemly worse results when I took it out and made the yScale with the same syntax as the xScale. Any explanation of the best way to go about working with positive and negative values for both axes would be appreciated. Let me know if I'm missing something obvious. I through together this example from a much larger project as to make it as specific and easy to read as possible. Thanks!

@CONTENT:I am converting several modules based on OCaml to F# and ran into the OCaml print formatting functions open_box and close_box from the OCaml format module. After reading about the concept of a printing box, it makes sense but seems like it needs a lot of work behind the scenes to implement. Is there an F# module that is functionally equivalent? If not, without having to convert portions of the OCaml format module, what are quick and simple replacement functions?

@TITLE:Redrawing UITableViewCell when entering/exiting edit mode
@CONTENT:I have a table view in which the cells are built differently depending on whether the table is editing or not. Specifically, the selection style is none when in edit mode and blue when not in edit mode. When I transition from one to the other, I noticed that some of the cells are not updated. A quick bit of logging tells me that even though the cells' appearance changes quite drastically (accessory views are added/removed correctly for example) the table view does not refresh the selection style (nor for that matter the text). What is going on here? Are only some attributes of the cell updated when setEditing is called? Presumably only those with a specific method allowing allocation of a separate view style (for example the EditingAccessoryType)? I guess I would benefit from a EditingSelectionStyle. How should I resolve it? By customizing setEditing to change the selectionStyle for each cell? I'm not even sure how I would iterate through the table view to do this. reloadData isn't an option because of some animation that I am using.

@CONTENT:I have a basic schema Post {
    Labels: [
        { Text: "Mine" }
        { Text: "Incomplete" }
    ]
}
 And I am querying raven, to ask for all posts with BOTH "Mine" and "Incomplete" labels. queryable.Where(candidate => candidate.Labels.Any(label => label.Text == "Mine"))
    .Where(candidate => candidate.Labels.Any(label => label.Text == "Incomplete"));
 This results in a raven query (from Raven server console) Query: (Labels,Text:Incomplete) AND (Labels,Text:Mine)
Time: 3 ms
Index: Temp/XWrlnFBeq8ENRd2SCCVqUQ==
Results: 0 returned out of 0 total.
 Why is this? If I query for JUST containing "Incomplete", I get 1 result. If I query for JUST containing "Mine", I get the same result - so WHY where I query for them both, I get 0 results? EDIT: Ok - so I got a little further. The 'automatically generated index' looks like this from doc in docs.FeedAnnouncements
from docLabelsItem in ((IEnumerable<dynamic>)doc.Labels).DefaultIfEmpty()
select new { CreationDate = doc.CreationDate, Labels_Text = docLabelsItem.Text }
 So, I THINK the query was basically testing the SAME label for 2 different values. Bad. I changed it to this: from doc in docs.FeedAnnouncements
from docLabelsItem1 in ((IEnumerable<dynamic>)doc.Labels).DefaultIfEmpty()
from docLabelsItem2 in ((IEnumerable<dynamic>)doc.Labels).DefaultIfEmpty()
select new { CreationDate = doc.CreationDate, Labels1_Text = docLabelsItem1.Text, Labels2_Text = docLabelsItem2.Text }
 Now my query (in Raven Studio) Labels1_Text:Mine AND Labels2_Text:Incomplete WORKS! But, how do I address these phantom fields (Labels1_Text and Labels2_Text) when querying from Linq?

@CONTENT:I've been working on a project at work and have come to the realization that I must invoke a function in several of the queries' WHERE clauses. The performance isn't terrible exactly, but I would love to improve it. So I looked at the docs for indexes which mentioned that: An index field can be an expression computed from the values of one or more columns of the table row. Awesome. So I tried creating an index: CREATE INDEX idx_foo ON foo_table (stable_function(foo_column)); And received an error: ERROR: functions in index expression must be marked IMMUTABLE So then I read about Function Volatility Categories which had this to say about stable volatility: In particular, it is safe to use an expression containing such a function in an index scan condition. Based on the phrasing "index scan condition" I'm guessing it doesn't mean an actual index. So what does it mean? Is it possible to utilize a stable function in an index? Or do we have to go all the way and ensure this would work as an immutable function? We're using Postgres v9.0.1.

@CONTENT:I'm using FMOD library to extract PCM from an MP3. I get the whole 2 channel - 16 bit thing, and I also get that a sample rate of 44100hz is 44,100 samples of "sound" in 1 second. What I don't get is, what exactly does the 16 bit value represent. I know how to plot coordinates on an xy axis, but what am I plotting? The y axis represents time, the x axis represents what? Sound level? Is that the same as amplitude? How do I determine the different sounds that compose this value. I mean, how do I get a spectrum from a 16 bit number. This may be a separate question, but it's actually what I really need answered: How do I get the amplitude at every 25 milliseconds? Do I take 44,100 values, divide by 40 (40 * 0.025 seconds = 1 sec) ? That gives 1102.5 samples; so would I feed 1102 values into a blackbox that gives me the amplitude for that moment in time?

@TITLE:CSS z-index issue when inside of table cell
@CONTENT:I have a calendar/table that when you hover over each day we have a small popup that is absolutely position below each cell. To make this work I have added a <div style="relative" /> inside each cell. Works fine in FF although when you hover over it in IE the z-index is being ignored. I have tried all of the hacks I can think of to get it to work in IE 7 + 8.

@TITLE:Publish unmanaged DLL from referenced project
@CONTENT:I have a C# project (let's call it Driver) that uses an unmanaged DLL to interact with some hardware. I have another project that references Driver. When I build the project, the unmanaged DLL gets copied to the output directory as I want. However, when I publish the project as a ClickOnce application, the DLL does not get included in the application's files. In the Application Files in project properties under Publish, I can see Driver's managed DLL, but the unmanaged DLL is not listed. I'm certain there's an easy fix for this, but searches mostly lead to questions about including unmanaged DLLs in projects. Thanks in advance, Bj?rn

I'm using random to generate a list of numbers given a range and number of items to create. That works. I then check to see if a list (generated above) has duplicates. That works. I then try to generate a given (n) of lists. Here is where I run into trouble. It generates one list then returns "NoneType" is not iterable.

If I had to make a more comprehensive use of the IPs this wouldn't be the proper way to do it I guess, but if it's only to make sure that the same IP didn't do something twice would be okay to use the md5 encryption to simplify things (unifying IPv4 and IPv6 addresses into one)?

But again, it's empty. If I set it to a local page, though, the content is loaded. Is this because of the same origin policy? I'm not so informed about it. I did some googling and I'm confused because some sites say that it's okay to include an iframe with src that doesn't belong to your own domain, and some say it's not possible. By the way, since I'm still testing on localhost, would this work if I uploaded this to a server somewhere? (but src of iframe will still be in a different domain) Help?

@TITLE:What is the root cause of the USB Host support is unavailable message?
@CONTENT:I am trying to send data over a USB to serial cable using the jUSB library. I'm coding in the NetBeans IDE on Windows. What is the problem behind the message: "USB Host support is unavailable" in the following code: package usb.core;

@TITLE:Code for Ant not Running in Maven
@CONTENT:This is probably the most strange thing I have ever seen in Java: The following code (that uses no external libraries) runs flawlessly using Ant (on Netbeans, on a Windows-7 Machine) : public static void main( String[] args ) throws IOException, InterruptedException
{
  String prog = "\"C:\\Program Files\\R\\R-2.14.2\\bin\\Rscript.exe\"";
  String[] progParams = new String[]{"C:\\Users\\pantelis\\Desktop\\SB\\MC_Sarfraz_ver5.R"};
  Process p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(prog+" "+progParams[0]);
  p.waitFor();
  System.out.println(p.exitValue()==0);
  System.out.println("Done!!!"); 
}
 and it returns the output message: true
Done!!!
 meaning that it completed smoothly. When I'm trying to run the very same code using Maven, I get no exceptions but the code finishes with: false
Done!
 and the process is never executed. This is my POM file: <project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"

 Update 1: I used the following code to print any error messages generated by the process: String line;
BufferedReader input = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(p.getErrorStream()));
while ((line = input.readLine()) != null) {
  System.out.println(line);
}
 Here is the output: Error in library(RDCOMClient) : there is no package called 'RDCOMClient'
Execution halted
 This error message appears only when I run using Maven. Update 2: When I run using Maven, I use JDK7. Here is the corresponding command: cd C:\Users\pantelis\Documents\NetBeansProjects\MVNTest;

We did achieved this using following script: fixed div on bottom of page that stops in given place But there is an issue on some page where the footer toolbar just disappears from the page, and then appear again when page is scrolled down further. We found that this particular issue appears only on few page, when the page has some contents like Images, Video, or Ajax load other content where the content is filled in (or space is being filled) after page has loaded.

( I want to be able to simply go something like loadImage("images/imageToLoad.png"); ) I have tried to just drag and drop.

@TITLE:Show logo/ad while content loads at the back end
@CONTENT:I want to place a Logo/ad in front of content, there are ways to do it but the problem with them is that they use JS show/hide method. What happens is that the content doesn't load while user is watching the logo/ad, which results as double waiting for the user first for the logo/ad and then the actual flash content loading. So I was thinking if there is a way that a logo/ad could be displayed and at the same time flash content continues to load at the back end. I didn't ask for a loader that continues to appear until at the back end flash content is done loading, because I found only one script that was able to do so using Jquery but it was designed to work with fixed pixels while my flash content is based on %ages Live Demo: http://bloghutsbeta.blogspot.com/2012/04/testing-game-content-issue.html Note: Sorry for providing blogspot link but JsFiddle is not an option for a person living in Afghanistan with 5KBps but still if you feel that I am missing something please let me know I will edit it and try my best to provide as relevant question as possible ^^ Relevant Markup: Button for lightbox or Modal Window <a class="poplight" href="#?w=100%" rel="popup_name"><img alt="play game" class="happybutton" onmouseout="this.style.opacity=0.8;this.filters.alpha.opacity=80" onmouseover="this.style.opacity=1;this.filters.alpha.opacity=100" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4084/4998558471_27e3985c16_m.jpg" style="opacity: 0.8;" /></a>

 I've researched a bunch, including the below, and thought I had an answer. However, it's not working. This is what i'm doing: foreach ($attributes as $key => $value) {
            $obj = array('AttributeID' => $key, 'Value' => $value);
            $attrs[] = $obj;
    }
    $final_attrs = array('ContactProfileAttribute' => $attrs);

    $params = array(
                    'WSContact' => array(
                                    'EmailAddress' => $email,
                                    'ListID' => $listId,
                                    array('ContactProfileAttribute' => $attrs)
                                    ),
                                    'ProfileUpdateType' => 'Overwrite',
                                    'ExternalEventIDs' => "",
                                    'OverrideUnsubscribe' => TRUE,

    );

    try {

            $rest = $soapClient->SetContact($params);
...
 when I print out the array, I get this: Array

    [WSContact] => Array
        (
        [EmailAddress] => xxx@example.com
        [ListID] => 26444

                            )

            )

    )

[ProfileUpdateType] => Overwrite

@CONTENT:I have a calendar/table that when you hover over each day we have a small popup that is absolutely position below each cell. To make this work I have added a <div style="relative" /> inside each cell. Works fine in FF although when you hover over it in IE the z-index is being ignored. I have tried all of the hacks I can think of to get it to work in IE 7 + 8.

@TITLE:Publish unmanaged DLL from referenced project
@CONTENT:I have a C# project (let's call it Driver) that uses an unmanaged DLL to interact with some hardware. I have another project that references Driver. When I build the project, the unmanaged DLL gets copied to the output directory as I want. However, when I publish the project as a ClickOnce application, the DLL does not get included in the application's files. In the Application Files in project properties under Publish, I can see Driver's managed DLL, but the unmanaged DLL is not listed. I'm certain there's an easy fix for this, but searches mostly lead to questions about including unmanaged DLLs in projects. Thanks in advance, Bj?rn

@TITLE:R: Using the bigmemory library for classification with randomForest
@CONTENT:has anyone been able to set up a classification (not a regressions) using randomForest AND the bigmemory library. I am aware that the 'formula approach" cannot be used and we have to resort to the "x=predictors, y=response approach". It appears that the big memory library is unable to deal with a response vector that has categorical values (its a matrix, after all). In my case, I have two levels, both represented as characters. According to the bigmemory documentation..."A data frame will have character vectors converted to factors, and then all factors converted to numeric factor levels" Any suggested workarounds to get randomForest classification to work with bigmemory? #EXAMPLE to problem

@TITLE:Code for Ant not Running in Maven
@CONTENT:This is probably the most strange thing I have ever seen in Java: The following code (that uses no external libraries) runs flawlessly using Ant (on Netbeans, on a Windows-7 Machine) : public static void main( String[] args ) throws IOException, InterruptedException
{
  String prog = "\"C:\\Program Files\\R\\R-2.14.2\\bin\\Rscript.exe\"";
  String[] progParams = new String[]{"C:\\Users\\pantelis\\Desktop\\SB\\MC_Sarfraz_ver5.R"};
  Process p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(prog+" "+progParams[0]);
  p.waitFor();
  System.out.println(p.exitValue()==0);
  System.out.println("Done!!!"); 
}
 and it returns the output message: true
Done!!!
 meaning that it completed smoothly. When I'm trying to run the very same code using Maven, I get no exceptions but the code finishes with: false
Done!
 and the process is never executed. This is my POM file: <project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"

 Update 1: I used the following code to print any error messages generated by the process: String line;
BufferedReader input = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(p.getErrorStream()));
while ((line = input.readLine()) != null) {
  System.out.println(line);
}
 Here is the output: Error in library(RDCOMClient) : there is no package called 'RDCOMClient'
Execution halted
 This error message appears only when I run using Maven. Update 2: When I run using Maven, I use JDK7. Here is the corresponding command: cd C:\Users\pantelis\Documents\NetBeansProjects\MVNTest; 
"JAVA_HOME=C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.7.0_04" 
"\"C:\\Program Files\\NetBeans 7.1.2\\java\\maven\\bin\\mvn.bat\""

"-Dexec.executable=C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.7.0_04\\bin\\java.exe" 
-Dexec.classpathScope=runtime process-classes 
org.codehaus.mojo:exec-maven-plugin:1.2:exec

@CONTENT:We needed a footer toolbar that stays at the bottom of the page, and sticks to some area when page is scrolled below that area. We did achieved this using following script: fixed div on bottom of page that stops in given place But there is an issue on some page where the footer toolbar just disappears from the page, and then appear again when page is scrolled down further. We found that this particular issue appears only on few page, when the page has some contents like Images, Video, or Ajax load other content where the content is filled in (or space is being filled) after page has loaded. I have no clue how to fix this.

So far so good but try as I might I can't seem to find a way to load or import image files into that images folder. ( I want to be able to simply go something like loadImage("images/imageToLoad.png"); ) I have tried to just drag and drop. I know that I could of course leave the program and use the linux filesystem to transfer the images but that's a pain and defeats the purpose of an IDE. Thanks for the help!

@TITLE:Show logo/ad while content loads at the back end
@CONTENT:I want to place a Logo/ad in front of content, there are ways to do it but the problem with them is that they use JS show/hide method. What happens is that the content doesn't load while user is watching the logo/ad, which results as double waiting for the user first for the logo/ad and then the actual flash content loading. So I was thinking if there is a way that a logo/ad could be displayed and at the same time flash content continues to load at the back end. I didn't ask for a loader that continues to appear until at the back end flash content is done loading, because I found only one script that was able to do so using Jquery but it was designed to work with fixed pixels while my flash content is based on %ages Live Demo: http://bloghutsbeta.blogspot.com/2012/04/testing-game-content-issue.html Note: Sorry for providing blogspot link but JsFiddle is not an option for a person living in Afghanistan with 5KBps but still if you feel that I am missing something please let me know I will edit it and try my best to provide as relevant question as possible ^^ Relevant Markup: Button for lightbox or Modal Window <a class="poplight" href="#?w=100%" rel="popup_name"><img alt="play game" class="happybutton" onmouseout="this.style.opacity=0.8;this.filters.alpha.opacity=80" onmouseover="this.style.opacity=1;this.filters.alpha.opacity=100" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4084/4998558471_27e3985c16_m.jpg" style="opacity: 0.8;" /></a>

 I've researched a bunch, including the below, and thought I had an answer. However, it's not working. This is what i'm doing: foreach ($attributes as $key => $value) {
            $obj = array('AttributeID' => $key, 'Value' => $value);
            $attrs[] = $obj;
    }
    $final_attrs = array('ContactProfileAttribute' => $attrs);

    $params = array(
                    'WSContact' => array(
                                    'EmailAddress' => $email,
                                    'ListID' => $listId,
                                    array('ContactProfileAttribute' => $attrs)
                                    ),
                                    'ProfileUpdateType' => 'Overwrite',
                                    'ExternalEventIDs' => "",
                                    'OverrideUnsubscribe' => TRUE,

    );

    try {

            $rest = $soapClient->SetContact($params);
...
 when I print out the array, I get this: Array

@TITLE:How to edit a serialized hash column in form textarea
@CONTENT:I have a serialized column in Company model: class Company < ActiveRecord::Base
  serialize :names
 Ideally I want it to store different names like this in the database: ---
short: bestbuy
long: bestbuy ltd.
 Currently in my company#edit page, I have a text area for it: <%= f.text_area :names %>
 If I have that YAML in the database, it will be displayed in the browser as: {"short"=>"bestbuy", "long"=>"bestbuy ltd."}
 However when I submit it, in the database it became: --- ! '{"short"=>"bestbuy", "long"=>"bestbuy ltd."}'
 Question How can I make it so that textarea displays YAML for editors to edit? How to make the database save the proper YAML, not a mash of YAML and ruby hash? update If I force the column to be of type Hash like this: serialize :names, Hash
 it will give error when I try to save: ActiveRecord::SerializationTypeMismatch in Admin::CompaniesController#update Attribute was supposed to be a Hash, but was a String
@CODE:class Company < ActiveRecord::Base

@TITLE:HowTo deal with cryptic hidden values for ASP Net (__VIEWSTATE)
@CONTENT:Hey Guys, I was trying to figure out how to deal with the cryptic "__VIEWSTATE" & Cie when you are trying to request (POST) a page with Python ! It's the main source of a lot of problems in my scripts ... and I realize, when I was looking for answers / solutions, that you don't have that much of solutions (almost 0 !). In this topic: Unable to load ASP.NET page using Python urllib2 You can see that I am giving my solution with consist in parsing the value of the cryptic fields every time you load the page ... That works, but that's quite stupid actually :-)     for result in the_page.findAll('input', attrs={'name' : '__VIEWSTATE'}):
        view_state =  result['value']

    for result_1 in the_page.findAll('input', attrs={'name' : '__EVENTVALIDATION'}):
        event_validation =  result_1['value']

    for result_2 in the_page.findAll('input', attrs={'name' : '__PREVIOUSPAGE'}):
        previous_page =  result_2['value']

    for result in the_page.findAll('input', attrs={'name' : '__EVENTTARGET'}):
        event_target =  result['value']
 And after :     url = 'http://bandscore.ielts.org/search.aspx'
    values = {
                            '__EVENTTARGET' : 'gdvSearchResults',
                            '__EVENTARGUMENT' : page,
                        '__VIEWSTATE' : view_state,
                        '__PREVIOUSPAGE' : previous_page,
                        '__EVENTVALIDATION' : event_validation,
                        'DropDownList1'  : Country,
                        #'txtSearchInstitution'  : '',
                        #'hdnSearchText'  : '',

    req = urllib2.Request(url, data, headers)
    response = urllib2.urlopen(req)
    thePage = response.read()
    the_page = soup(thePage)
 So here few more links with good explanations / some are proposing solutions: What does the __VIEWSTATE hold? http://aspalliance.com/articleViewer.aspx?aId=135&pId= http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.ui.losformatter.aspx http://weblogs.asp.net/infinitiesloop/archive/2006/08/03/Truly-Understanding-Viewstate.aspx http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms972976.aspx Mechanize does not see some hidden form inputs? Unable to load ASP.NET page using Python urllib2 I realize that a lot of people are trying to find a good way to deal with that, so let's try to find a good solution, all together ;-) EDIT1: Found that too, might be interesting http://code.google.com/p/peekviewstate/source/browse/trunk/src/peekviewstate_example.py (Sorry is this post in not perfect / full of good info ...

 Note that I'm using a legacy database hence the strange column names etc. The view contains the following: <% @animals.includes(:client).each do |animal| %>

    <td><%= animal.AnimalName %></td>
    <td><%= link_to animal.client.Surname, animal.client %></td>

    <td><%= animal.Breed %></td>
    <td><%= animal.Dead %></td>    
    <td><%= link_to 'Show', animal %></td>
  </tr>
<% end %>
 So, should I be adding the other recommended columns to the view 'finder'? Or somewhere else? Any help would be appreciated!

@TITLE:Backbone.js: compare model attributes in a collection
@CONTENT:I have a collection of unlimited scope (can be 0, can be 1000, can be a million). I need to search the attributes of every model in the collection and return the attributes (and their values) that are the same. For example, if I have the following three models in the collection: modelOne:
  color: "red"
  age: 10
  size: "large"

modelTwo:
  color: "red"
  age: 11
  size: "medium"

modelThree:
  color: "red"
  age: 9
  size: "large"
 I need the app to return color: "red" (or some other derivation that can be parsed), since it is the only attribute that is equal across all three models. Edit John Munsch's solution worked very well, but now the requirements have changed in that some attributes can now be arrays. Is there a way to compare regular attributes, and attributes that are arrays? New code example: modelOne:
  color: "red"
  age: 10
  sizes: ["small", "large"]

modelTwo:
  color: "red"
  age: 9
  sizes: ["small", "large"]
@CODE:modelOne:
  color: "red"
  age: 10
  size: "large"

modelTwo:
  color: "red"

modelThree:
  color: "red"

@TITLE:Why does Chrome not show a selected <option> element after using the back button?
@CONTENT:I have a <select> tag that contains a single <option> element: <select id="someselect">
  <option value="2">B</option>
</select>
 The single <option> is later replaced using jQuery. The new list of options always contains the old option: selected = $('#someselect').val();
$('#someselect').html('<option value="1">A</option><option value="2">B</option>').val(selected);
 This works as expected. However, when navigating away from the webpage in Google Chrome and then clicking the back button, something weird happens. The select tag is back to its initial state (makes sense), but the single <option> element is not selected! What is the cause of this behavior in Chrome? I've created a minimal working example: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/27566470/backdemo.html Initially there is only a single <option>. First click on "click" to replace the options (but keep the 'B' option selected), then click on "Google" to navigate away, and then use the back button of Chrome to see the <select> tag with only a single option that is not selected. Edit: to clarify, I'm not interested in how to fix this. I'm curious why Chrome works like this. Serving the original (unmodified) DOM after using the back button makes sense, but why is the only select option not selected?
@CODE:<select> <option> <select id="someselect">
  <option value="2">B</option>
</select> <option> selected = $('#someselect').val();
$('#someselect').html('<option value="1">A</option><option value="2">B</option>').val(selected); <option> <option> <select> refreshed GET URL sessions

@TITLE:Can't insert a Web Forms For Marketers form because there are no Placeholders
@CONTENT:We are trying to fix an old issue with our Web Forms for Marketers module (I think it is 2.2, but I don't know how to tell) in Sitecore 6.4.1 running .NET Framework 2.0. I am having trouble even adding a form to an item. I am making an assumption that I should be using the "Insert Form" button in the presentation tab of my item. When I click that button I get a wizard that goes fine until it tells me the following: "There are no allowed placeholders in order to insert a new form." Ignorning the error's grammar issue for a moment, I assume it is telling me that there are prequisites for an item to allow it to work with a form. I looked around and thought that maybe the problem in this issue was related: Cannot get a Sitecore form to display in a placeholder (Web Forms for Marketers module) So I made sure a Form was in my template. It is there now, but throws a "value cannot be null" exception in the logs when I click "edit" on the Form item in the Device Editor. I have a Placeholder Setting as well since I have read that I need that for some reason. It is named "form" and the Settings Item is /content. Am I missing a perquisite? Do I need to reinstall the module?

@CONTENT:I need to resize my image proportionately without changing aspect ratio.I have the code to resize with fixed hight and width but I need to resize image proportionately with max height(say 600 pixels). How can I modify the code to suit my requirement? public static void Main()
{
  var image = Image.FromFile(@"c:\logo.png");
  var newImage = ScaleImage(image, 300, 400);
  newImage.Save(@"c:\test.png", ImageFormat.Png);
}

public static Image ScaleImage(Image image, int maxWidth, int maxHeight)
 {
  var ratioX = (double)maxWidth / image.Width;
  var ratioY = (double)maxHeight / image.Height;
  var ratio = Math.Min(ratioX, ratioY);

  var newWidth = (int)(image.Width * ratio);
  var newHeight = (int)(image.Height * ratio);

  var newImage = new Bitmap(newWidth, newHeight);
  Graphics.FromImage(newImage).DrawImage(image, 0, 0, newWidth, newHeight);
  return newImage;
}
 Please provide your valuable thoughts.

@TITLE:Why does recursive submodule update from github fail for DoctrineMongoORMModule?
@CONTENT:Is this something I am doing wrong, or a wider bug? If I execute the following git commands in an empty directory: git init
git submodule add https://github.com/doctrine/DoctrineMongoODMModule \vendor\DoctrineMongoODMModule
git submodule update --init --recursive
 The all goes well, multiple submodules are pulled, and then it fails with the following output: fatal: not a git repository: ../../../../../../../../../../.git/modules/vendor/DoctrineMongoODMModule/modules/vendor/mongodb-odm/modules/lib/vendor/doctrine-mongodb/modules/lib/vendor/doctrine-common
Unable to find current revision in submodule pat 'lib/vendor/doctrine-common'
 I've done a bit more digging. The .git file in the submodule that is causing the problem has the following contents: gitdir: ../../../../../../../../../../.git/modules/vendor/DoctrineMongoODMModule/modules/vendor/mongodb-odm/modules/lib/vendor/doctrine-mongodb/modules/lib/vendor/doctrine-common
 I have checked that gitdir path, and it does exist. However, I am using a Windows XP machine and if I attempt this from the cmd prompt I have problems: C:\xds\sds\vendor\DoctrineMongoODMModule\vendor\mongodb-odm\lib\vendor\doctrine-
mongodb\lib\vendor\doctrine-common>cd ../../../../../../../../../../.git/modules
/vendor/DoctrineMongoODMModule/modules/vendor/mongodb-odm/modules/lib/vendor/doc
trine-mongodb/modules/lib/vendor/doctrine-common
The system cannot find the path specified.
 It appears that the directory change string is too long, because if I split it into two parts it works: C:\xds\sds\vendor\DoctrineMongoODMModule\vendor\mongodb-odm\lib\vendor\doctrine-
mongodb\lib\vendor\doctrine-common>cd ../../../../../../../../../../.git/modules

 Any advice or help would be appreciated. Cheers.

@TITLE:Leaflet Map elements sit in DOM but don't render?
@CONTENT:Leaflet is rendering because I can see all of its elements in the DOM, but nothing else comes to life. All I see is gray. The only way I can get map tiles to appear is if I delete the position:absolute on the map container, but that creates a bunch of jumbled map tiles. I checked the GIT history to see if I accidentally changed a style, but no luck. Here's the code initializing the map: // init everything on page show
$("#map").live('pageshow',function() {
    if(window.localStorage.getItem("lat")!=undefined) { var lat = window.localStorage.getItem("lat")} else { var lat = '49.264'; }
    if(window.localStorage.getItem("lng")!=undefined) { var lng = window.localStorage.getItem("lng")} else { var lng = '-123.123'; }
    try {         
        var map = window.map
        map = new L.Map('map-container');
        var cloudmadeUrl = 'http://{s}.tile.cloudmade.com/006282296d334e66a593e55aca6b5ce0/54803/256/{z}/{x}/{y}.png';
        var cloudmadeAttribution = 'Map Data &copy; 2011 OpenStreetMap';
        var cloudmade = new L.TileLayer(cloudmadeUrl, {maxZoom: 18, attribution: cloudmadeAttribution});
        map.setView(new L.LatLng(lat, lng), 12).addLayer(cloudmade);
        map.invalidateSize();
    } catch(e) {console.log(e)}
    userMarkers[1] = new L.Marker( new L.LatLng( lat,lng ) , {icon: new iconUser, clickable: true} );
    map.addLayer( userMarkers[1] );
});
 The environment includes jQuery mobile. Unfortunately, the console does not log any errors and the localStorage above indeed holds valid LatLng values when I inspect it. A screenshot: Any guesses?

@TITLE:are casts overridable operations? if so, how?
@CONTENT:Is it possible to override (C-style) casts in C++? Suppose I have the code double x = 42;
int k = (int)x;
 Can I make the cast in the second line execute some code I wrote? Something like // I don't know C++
// I have no idea if this has more syntax errors than words
operator (int)(double) {
    std::cout << "casting from double to int" << std::endl;
}
 The reason I ask is because of the question "Is there any way to get gcc or clang to warn on explicit casts?" and my suggestion there.

int k = (int)x; // I don't know C++

@TITLE:jQuery $.ajax failing silently, no error messages, and server responded with 200 OK
@CONTENT:I am about to do my head in over this problem. I am using very simple jQuery ajax calls to get values from a database and populate a few select elements with the values, all returned as JSON. It works seamlessly for me on most browsers, however the client is reporting that neither them nor their clients are seeing the result. I added some Console.log() commands along the way to make sure the code was executing, and it was. Sometimes the ajax GET to the URL in question works, other times is STILL returns 200 OK but the code simply does not execute further, and NO ajax error messages are shown in the error callback. Here is the code I am using, can someone spot something obvious that may result in some browsers choking? If so, I'd be grateful if you could point it out:         var $j = jQuery.noConflict(true);

@TITLE:mouse wheel listener not working in jscrollbar
@CONTENT:I am developing a desktop application in netbeans platform (netbeans module) in which i have a desktoppane and a jscrollbar. i have implemented MouseWheelListener and added scrollBar.addMouseWheelListener(this);
 in the constructor of the class. now when i am scrolling the wheel of mouse it do not scroll the scroll bar though i am getting values in the  private void scrollBarMouseWheelMoved(java.awt.event.MouseWheelEvent evt) { 


 System.out.println("mouse value is------------ " + evt.paramString());
}
 ouput of above sout is mouse value is------------ MOUSE_WHEEL,(8,49),absolute(0,0),button=0,clickCount=0,scrollType=WHEEL_UNIT_SCROLL,scrollAmount=3,wheelRotation=1
 what should i do now to enable mosue wheel event on jscrollbar? I have searched but i found events for scrollpane but i am looking for scrollbar explicitly.. i have removed extra code and shown what i am looking for in the following sample code     public final class ScrollableWindow1TopComponent extends TopComponent implements ComponentListener, MouseWheelListener {

    private javax.swing.JScrollBar scrollBar;
    private javax.swing.JDesktopPane scrollableGraphnewContainer;

    public ScrollableWindow1TopComponent() {
      this.addComponentListener(this);
      scrollBar.addMouseWheelListener(this);

    }
     private void scrollBarMouseWheelMoved(java.awt.event.MouseWheelEvent evt) {                                          
       System.out.println("mouse value is------------ " + evt.paramString());
    }
     private void scrollBarAdjustmentValueChanged(java.awt.event.AdjustmentEvent evt) { 
      //code that works fine 
    }
  }
@CODE:scrollBar.addMouseWheelListener(this); private void scrollBarMouseWheelMoved(java.awt.event.MouseWheelEvent evt) { 


 System.out.println("mouse value is------------ " + evt.paramString());

@TITLE:NLTM auth using HttpUrlConnection failing
@CONTENT:I am trying to authenticate against a server supporting NTLM authentication in my Java application using java.net's HttpUrlConnection. The problem is that the application fails to send the Authenticate response. I have attached proxy to the http connection so that the traffic is routed via fiddler. In fiddler i can see Negotiate message being sent, and server Challenge is received. But after this, the application just stops saying it got a 401, without sending the type3 authenticate message. Any ideas? Here is the code - Authenticator.setDefault(new Authenticator() {
    public PasswordAuthentication getPasswordAuthentication() {
        return new PasswordAuthentication("username",
                                          "password".toCharArray());
    }
});
URL url = new URL("https://service_url.svc");

// Proxy for fiddler
Proxy proxy = new Proxy(Proxy.Type.HTTP,
                  new InetSocketAddress("localhost", 8888));

// Create a connection
HttpURLConnection conn = (HttpURLConnection)url.openConnection(proxy);
conn.setRequestMethod("GET");
conn.setDoInput(true);
conn.setDoOutput(true);
conn.setUseCaches(false);

InputStream is = conn.getInputStream();
BufferedReader rd = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(is));
String line;
while ((line = rd.readLine()) != null)
    System.out.println(line);

rd.close();
 Appreciate any help. Thanks.

@TITLE:Receiving data from UDP server on iOS app is not working from Linux server, but works from macbook pro [closed]
@CONTENT:BACKGROUND: I made an IPhone socket application based on UDP. It works as a client and server while it communicates with a Linux [Ubuntu] server. Im using a GCDAsyncUdpSocket to send and receive data. I also have a back-up server/client application on my Macbook to test/verify the socket communication application. It simply acts like the Linux [Ubuntu] server. It works perfect. PROBLEM: I cant receive any data from the Linux [Ubuntu] server. DETAILS: I can successfully send data to the Linux server and it reacts/processes upon that data. But when the server sends replies or echoes, my iPhone app can't see/read it. A similar application I developed with a colleague for Android does read/see data from the server. Please see the code below. Cheers! This is the code for it: .m file: -(void)viewDidLoad

At any point during evaluation, the interpreter should be able to detect when it receives as arguments a pair of expression and environment that it has previously seen. Plain memoization of eval and apply is inefficient. It would require looking up the arguments in a hash table on every call of eval/apply, which would require walking the entire (possibly big) arguments on hash table matches. For example, assume that the interpreter evaluates the program (car (list A))
 where A evaluates to a big object. When the interpreter evaluates the application (list A), it first evaluates list and A individually. Before it applies list to A, it looks up in its hash table whether it has seen this application before, walking the entire A object to compute a hash. Later on, when the memoizing interpreter applies car to the list containing A, it computes a hash for this list which again involves walking the entire A object. Instead, I want to build an interpreter that incrementally builds up approximately unique hashes, avoiding recomputation where possible and providing a guarantee that collisions are unlikely. For example, one could recursively extend each object that the interpreter operates on with the MD5 of its value, or, if it is a compound object, with the MD5 of its component hashes. An environment might store the hash for each of its variable/value entries, and the hash of the environment might be computed as a function of the individual hashes. Then, if an entry in the environment changes, it is not necessary to rewalk the entire environment to compute the new hash of the environment. Instead, only the hash of the changed variable/value pair needs to be recomputed and the global hash of the set of entry hashes needs to be updated. Does there exist related work on incrementally building up approximately unique hashes, in particular in the context of recursive memoization and/or program evaluation?
@CODE:eval apply eval apply (car (list A)) (list A) list A list A A car (eq? (list) (list)) eq? true (eq? (list 'A) (list 'A)) (list ...) '(A) (car (list <a> <b> <c>)) <a> list list

@CONTENT:Hello I am using MuPdf library in my project to view documents. The problem is that when you open 3-7 documents in a activity 11 inches on the tablet, i get memory overflow. When you load a new document, all references to the previous document are destroyed, but the image of the document from memory are not removed. objects are created in the memory image of 10-12 megabytes. on tablet the size of 7 inches this problem does not arise. Maybe someone encountered this problem?

@TITLE:How to call overriden methods in all derived classes [duplicate]
@CONTENT:Possible Duplicate: How to force child same virtual function call its parent virtual function first I have a class hierarchy where each derived class overrides a given virtual function and starts its implementation by calling the one in its parent class. The goal is to have each of the derived implementation to be executed, but I do not like the way I do it. For example, I have this class: class base
{
public:
  void do_stuff() { do_something(); }
  virtual void do_something() { }
};
 Then I derive this class on several levels: class derived_10:
  public derived_9 // which inherit from derived_8 and so on until derived_0
                   // which inherit from base
{
public:
  virtual void do_something()
  {
    // this will also call derived_8::do_something() and so on
    // until base::do_something()
    derived_9::do_something();

    // then, some stuff
  }
};
 I'm looking for a solution that will make sure that all derived_x::do_something() will be called in sequence when base::do_stuff() is called, without having to expect the derived classes to do this themselves. Do you have an idea of the best way to get this behavior??
@CODE:class base
{
public:
  void do_stuff() { do_something(); }
  virtual void do_something() { }

@TITLE:Differences between BitmapFactory.decodeResource and BitmapFactory.decodeStream
@CONTENT:I've got an if-else scenario where the if-path uses this code: BitmapFactory.Options options = new BitmapFactory.Options();
options.inScaled = false;
options.inPurgeable = true;
options.inInputShareable = true;
bitmap = BitmapFactory.decodeResource(getResources(), resourceId, options);
 And the else-path uses this code: InputStream is = getContentResolver().openInputStream(Uri.fromFile(file));
BitmapFactory.Options options = new BitmapFactory.Options();
options.inScaled = false;
options.inPurgeable = true;
options.inInputShareable = true;
bitmap = BitmapFactory.decodeStream(is, null, options);
 Now to me, reading the short description from the API, testing and Googling I can't quite figure out the difference, but there seems to be a suble one. The first piece of code scales to fit the width of the screen when applied to a ImageView (within a RelativeLayout, within a ScrollView). The second piece of code does not, which is my problem. It seems to loose it's aspect ratio somehow as well, because if I apply: imageView.setAdjustViewBounds(true);
imageView.setScaleType(ImageView.ScaleType.FIT_XY);
 It manages to fit it to the width, but messes up the height (making it shorter than it should be). Any input would be greatly appreciated! (I've already tried to change the first piece of code to see if I had messed something else up, but this rewrite of the if-path gave the same error:) BitmapFactory.Options options = new BitmapFactory.Options();
options.inScaled = false;
options.inPurgeable = true;
options.inInputShareable = true;

 The in-text-position of character names and locations are saved in the corresponding tables. I'm writing a Pythonscript using psycopg2, finding all occurences of given character names and locations in books. I only want the occurences in books, where both the character name AND the location are found. Here I already got a solution for searching one location and one character: WITH b AS (

    )  
SELECT bookid, position, 'char' AS what  
FROM   b  
JOIN   characternames USING (bookid)  
WHERE  name = 'XXX'  
UNION  ALL  
SELECT bookid, position, 'loc' AS what  
FROM   b  
JOIN   locations USING (bookid)  
WHERE  locname = 'YYY'  
ORDER  BY bookid, position;  
 The CTE 'b' contains all bookid's, where the character name 'XXX' and the location 'YYY' appear. Now I'm additionally wondering about searching for 2 places and a name (or 2 names and a place respectively). It's simple if all searched entities must occur in one book, but what about this: Searching for: Tim, Al, Toolshop Results: books including (Tim, Al, Toolshop) or (Tim, Al) or (Tim, Toolshop) or (Al, Toolshop) The problem could be repeated for 4, 5, 6...conditions. I thougt about INTERSECTing more subqueries, but that wouldn't work. Instead I would UNION the found bookIDs, GROUP them and select bookid's occurring more then once: WITH b AS (  
    SELECT bookid, count(bookid) AS occurrences  
    FROM  
        (SELECT DISTINCT bookid  
        FROM characterNames  
        WHERE name='XXX'

        FROM locations  
        WHERE locname='ZZZ'  
        GROUP BY bookid)

My problem is that for some wierd reason it doesnt work in Chrome. a screenshot of the problem in chrome http://img576.imageshack.us/img576/8976/chromem.png And this is how its supposed to look like ( There is a 14px padding else it would be at the very top) http://img62.imageshack.us/img62/140/firefoxi.png it looks the same in IE as in firefox. Im not using a table to my images and texts (Just pointing out) I hope that someone can help me because this has been giving me headaches for 2 days now almost :(

@TITLE:iTextSharp - acroform field encoding
@CONTENT:I'm trying to fill out a AcroForm's textfield with iTextSharp. The Acroform textfield was created also by iTextSharp by this piece of code: TextField Field = new TextField(OutputWriter, FieldPos, "MyField");
OutputWriter.AddAnnotation(Field.GetTextField()); // OutputWriter is writing to form.pdf
 I fill the form using this code: PdfReader reader = new PdfReader("form.pdf");
PdfStamper filledOutForm = new PdfStamper(reader, new FileStream("filled_form.pdf", FileMode.Create));

AcroFields form = filledOutForm.AcroFields;
form.SetField("MyField", "some unicode data");
 However, when I open filled_form.pdf in Acrobat Reader, unicode characters are not visible unless I edit manually the field (e.g. I append a character by hand to the field). I also tried to set field's font by: BaseFont fieldFontRoman = BaseFont.CreateFont(@"C:\Windows\Fonts\times.ttf",
                                BaseFont.IDENTITY_H,
                                BaseFont.EMBEDDED);
form.SetFieldProperty("MyField", "textfont", fieldFontRoman, null);
 Then, when I open filled_form.pdf in Acrobat Reader, everything looks fine unless I edit manually the field. After that, non unicode characters disappear (they change into blank spaces). They are here in the field because if I copy whole content of the field by CTRL + C and paste it to notepad, I can see all characters. Please advise. I would like to see all characters in the field without the need of editing the field manually and of course after editing it manually I would like no characters to disappear. Thank you

@LINK:/questions/10269975/cant-pull-data-out-of-viewbag-in-mvc
@TITLE:Can't pull data out of ViewBag in MVC
@CONTENT:I'm trying to pull data out of ViewBag and to insert it into a form hidden field via JS, before submit. It doesn't work. While debug, I find that part of the JS expression is kind of ignored, and as a result, a 'var' is evaluated to an empty string. Here's the JS part, which supposed to do the assignment: function setid() {
   var id = '@(ViewBag.id)';
   $('#idField').val(id);
};
 in debug I get the below expression, which of course leads to a null 'id': function setid() {
    var id = '';
    $('#idField').val(id);
  };
 (I'm not sure it's the only obstacle) This JS function is being called by a 'OnBegin' argument of 'Ajax.BeginForm' on the same page. This's the html hidden field that resides within the form, which into I'm trying to assign the 'id' value: input type  ="hidden" name ="id" id ="idField" value ="" 
 and the following is the Controller, which returns a Partial, that is rendered as a jquery dialog: public ActionResult openDialog()
    {
        ViewBag.id = TempData["id"];
        return PartialView("EndLoadDetailsDialog");
    }
 Updated: As I think of it, I might have found the problem. Please let me know if I'm right: The controller in which I define the viewbag value, returns a partial view, which is the last view that is beinng returned. This partial view is rendered to a JQuery dialog. After I close it, I return to the one before, which contains a form. In the form view (the one before the last one) I'm trying to access the viewbag value via JS function, and assign it to a hidden field in the form. So actually, I'm trying to get the viewbag value, not from the view to which I've sent the viewbag. Is it a problem? Are viewbag values available only from the last view that has rendered?
@CODE:function setid() {
   var id = '@(ViewBag.id)';
   $('#idField').val(id);
}; function setid() {
    var id = '';
    $('#idField').val(id);
  }; input type  ="hidden" name ="id" id ="idField" value ="" public ActionResult openDialog()
    {
        ViewBag.id = TempData["id"];
        return PartialView("EndLoadDetailsDialog");
    } TempData["id"] openDialog setid EndLoadDetailsDialog

@LINK:/questions/10267388/how-to-serialize-a-delegate
@TITLE:How to serialize a delegate
@CONTENT:Lets look at an example of grid filling. We have Column class. It has a delegate FormatCell, which take some Data and convert it to a string. FormatCell delegate is unknown at design time - it might be set by a plugin. public class ColumnFormatter
{
    public Func<Data, string> FormatCell {get; set;}
    //...
}
 Here is an example of how such Columns are used. public class Table
{
    public List<Column> Columns;

    public List<List<string>> BuildTable(List<Data> dataRows)
    {
        var table = new List<List<string>>();

        foreach (var data in dataRows)
        {
            var line = new List<string>();                    
            foreach (var column in Columns)
            {
                line.Add(column.FormatCell(data));
            }

            table.Add(line);
        }

        return table;
    }
}
 Now each column should save its state. And the question is how to serialize this FormatCell delegate? P.S. I'm aware of this question but my question is much more case specific. And maybe one has a specific reliable run-in solution for the such case?
@CODE:public class ColumnFormatter
{
    public Func<Data, string> FormatCell {get; set;}
    //...
} public class Table
{
    public List<Column> Columns;

    public List<List<string>> BuildTable(List<Data> dataRows)
    {
        var table = new List<List<string>>();

        foreach (var data in dataRows)
        {
            var line = new List<string>();                    
            foreach (var column in Columns)
            {
                line.Add(column.FormatCell(data));
            }

            table.Add(line);

@TITLE:How can I write a complex fraction using HTML/CSS/jQuery?
@CONTENT:I'd like to be able to write a fraction using HTML/CSS/jQuery (rather than using a TeX renderer or even MathML). At the moment there's a great workaround for writing simple fractions that works if you just have one term for both the numerator and the denominator, but once you start using more than one term it looks rather horrible. As an example, using: <sup><font size=-2>x<sup>2</sup> + 3x + 5</font></sup>/<sub><font size=-2>2x</font></sub> produces... x2 + 3x + 5/2x What I'd like is a beautiful horizontal line to define the fraction rather than a backslash. I've tried using div tags with border-bottom as such, but the output is still quite awful:   <div style="float:left;">Substitute 4 for 'x' in the equation: &nbsp;</div>
  <div style="float:left">
    <div style="border-bottom:1px solid;font-size:small;text-align:center;">x<sup>2</sup> + 3x + 5</div>
    <div style="font-size:small;text-align:center;">2x</div>
  </div>
 produces... What I'm looking for is a HTML/CSS/jQuery fraction that... has an easily discernable horizontal line spanning the width of the longest numerator or denominator; appears inline with the current text (it can slightly exceed the line height of the text, but I don't want it bursting out of it's seams); and (not really necessary, but a nice cherry on top) italicised letters (not numbers or brackets). Can this be done? How? Thanks!

@CONTENT:I have a small db, nothing fancy just 5 tables. I would like to use forms authentication but it creates its own db to do its stuff. I don't need anything fancy, and I certainly don't need the added infrastructure, but I'd like the security forms authentication provides. I have a person table, with a login and password field. how can I make it so forms uses these fields and returns my users id? is this even possible with forms? if not, how can I make it so forms creates it's infrastructure on my db so I can merge my tables with the ones forms needs to work? I know this is probably quite simple but I haven't found anything on the net after hours of research.

@LINK:/questions/10257354/access-application-localization-resources-resx-from-library
@TITLE:Access Application Localization resources (resx) from Library
@CONTENT:I've seen the solution suggested here: Access resx in application from Silverlight class library and it works for the resources itself. My problem is slightly different: I have 2 apps that use the same library. They are localized so I have a resource folder and in the folder of the apps the files AppResource.resx, AppResource.it-IT.resx I have a library that includes XAML files and code as well. It is localized so I have a resource folder and in the folder of the apps the files LibResource.resx, LibResource.it-IT.resx The app is using the MvvmLight libraries. As suggested I've extended the class ViewModelBase in a ViewModelBaseExtended adding the fields: public class ViewModelBaseExtended : ViewModelBase
{
    private static LibResources resources = new LibResources();
    public LibResources Resources { get { return resources; } }
}
 The XAML in the library is able to access correctly the localized resources: <phone:PhoneApplicationPage x:Class="PhoneClassLibrary1.MainPage"
           DataContext="{Binding Main, Source={StaticResource Locator}}">

<StackPanel x:Name="TitlePanel"
Grid.Row="0"
Margin="24,24,0,12">
           <TextBlock x:Name="ApplicationTitle"
                Text="{Binding Resources.AppName}"
                Style="{StaticResource PhoneTextNormalStyle}" />
           <TextBlock x:Name="PageTitle"
                Text="{Binding Resources.LocalLib}"
                Margin="-3,-8,0,0"
                Style="{StaticResource PhoneTextTitle1Style}" />
</StackPanel>
 My problem is: how can I access from the library the AppResources in the application? I cannot refer to them directly Namespace.AppResources as the library is shared between applications and Namespace is not defined at design time and changes at run time. I have a full project ready to test with the exact configruation, files etxc.. all working apart from the access from library to application level. Applying the solution I mentioned in the beginning: private static AppResources _gResources;
public AppResources gResources { set {_gResources = value;}  get { return _gResources; } }

public ViewModelBaseExtended()
{
    var assembly = Application.Current.GetType().Assembly;
    var ast = assembly.FullName;
    char[] delimit = new char[] { ',' };
    string[] parts = ast.Split(delimit);

    gResources = new System.Resources.ResourceManager(parts[0]+ ".AppResources", assembly);
}
 I correctly does not compile with an error as gResources is an AppResource (or LibResource) class while ResourceManager returns a different object.
@CODE:public class ViewModelBaseExtended : ViewModelBase
{
    private static LibResources resources = new LibResources();
    public LibResources Resources { get { return resources; } }
} <phone:PhoneApplicationPage x:Class="PhoneClassLibrary1.MainPage"

@LINK:/questions/10257289/scala-instance-value-scoping
@TITLE:Scala instance value scoping
@CONTENT:Note that this question and similar ones have been asked before, such as in Scala: forward references - why does this code compile?, but I found the answers to still leave some questions open, so I'm having another go at this issue. Within methods and functions, the effect of the val keyword appears to be lexical, i.e. def foo {
  println(bar)
  val bar = 42
}
 yielding error: forward reference extends over definition of value bar
 However, within classes, the scoping rules of val seem to change: object Foo {
  def foo = bar
  println(bar)
  val bar = 42
}
 Not only does this compile, but also the println in the constructor will yield 0 as its output, while calling foo after the instance is fully constructed will result in the expected value 42. So it appears to be possible for methods to forward-reference instance values, which will, eventually, be initialised before the method can be called (unless, of course, you're calling it from the constructor), and for statements within the constructor to forward-reference values in the same way, accessing them before they've been initialised, resulting in a silly arbitrary value. From this, a couple of questions arise: Why does val use its lexical compile-time effect within constructors? Given that a constructor is really just a method, this seems rather inconsistent to entirely drop val's compile-time effect, giving it its usual run-time effect only. Why does val, effectively, lose its effect of declaring an immutable value? Accessing the value at different times may result in different results. To me, it very much seems like a compiler implementation detail leaking out. What might legitimate usecases for this look like? I'm having a hard time coming up with an example that absolutely requires the current semantics of val within constructors and wouldn't easily be implementable with a proper, lexical val, possibly in combination with lazy. How would one work around this behaviour of val, getting back all the guarantees one is used to from using it within other methods? One could, presumably, declare all instance vals to be lazy in order to get back to a val being immutable and yielding the same result no matter how they are accessed and to make the compile-time effect as observed within regular methods less relevant, but that seems like quite an awful hack to me for this sort of thing. Given that this behaviour unlikely to ever change within the actual language, would a compiler plugin be the right place to fix this issue, or is it possible to implement a val-alike keyword with, for someone who just spent an hour debugging an issue caused by this oddity, more sensible semantics within the language?
@CODE:val def foo {
  println(bar)
  val bar = 42
} error: forward reference extends over definition of value bar val object Foo {
  def foo = bar
  println(bar)
  val bar = 42
} println 0 foo 42 val val val val val lazy val val lazy val val

@TITLE:Returning an event from a function
@CONTENT:What is the syntax to return an event from a function? (Not to call the event, to return it so that it can be bound to functions). I have a container class that contains a dictionary where each members has an event. The aim is to be able to write something like this: Container c = new Container();
c.CreateEventForKey("a");             // Create the member in the dictionary
c.EventForKey("a") += some_function;  // Bind some_function to the event in the "a" member
c.OnEventForKey("a","b");             // Calls some_function with argument "b"
 The Container class looks like this: public class Container {

  public class Member {
     public event Action<string> AnEvent;
     public void OnEvent( string v ) { if(AnEvent!=null) { AnEvent(v); } }
  }

  protected Dictionary<string,Member> members;

  // This seems to work OK.
  public void OnEventForKey(string k, string v) {
    if ( members.ContainsKey(k) ) { members[k].OnEvent(v); }
    else { /* report error */ }
  }

  // Can't get this to compile.
  public event Action<string> EventForKey(string k ) {
    if ( members.ContainsKey(k) ) { return members[k].AnEvent; }
    else { /* report error */ }
  }
}
 How can I define EventForKey so that this does what I expect?
@CODE:Container c = new Container();
c.CreateEventForKey("a");             // Create the member in the dictionary
c.EventForKey("a") += some_function;  // Bind some_function to the event in the "a" member
c.OnEventForKey("a","b");             // Calls some_function with argument "b" public class Container {

  public event Action<string> EventForKey(string k ) {
    if ( members.ContainsKey(k) ) { return members[k].AnEvent; }

@CONTENT:I made an application that I put onto the hard disk of Win CE (the Compact Flash card). My problem is that the application is using the SQL Server CE 3.5 database but it looks like that the image is created with the SQL Server CE 3.0. I couldn't select the 3.5 version when I started to build the image. The 3.5 version dlls are deployed every time I debug the application so the problem never shows up in the development phase. Now when the application starts (it is started automatically when OS boots) the message window with exceptions pops up and don't let the application to start. My question is how to install the SQL Server CE 3.5 into the image or how to install it using CAB files later or on every boot up time. When I run the correct CAB files (three CAB) on running OS system it installs the 3.5 version and my application starts but when I reboot the OS again the changes are not saved and commit. There must be a solution to add the 3.5 version in the catalog before building the image or to install it on every boot up time or the last option to install it permanently once after the first boot. If you can provide me the solution to install the CABs every time the system boots up It will work for me but then take into the consideration that I have to run the application that will use the SQL Server CE 3.5 database on system start so the installation of the CABs must precede the application autostart.

@TITLE:PUT + DELETE Http Verbs returning 401/405 from API on shared hosting webserver
@CONTENT:I have created an MVC Web Api for some university coursework, that works as expected on my development machine (Running VS11). However when I deploy the application to the webserver on 123reg HttpVerbs other than GET and POST appear to not reach my application at all, initially a 401 Not Authorised response was returned; however after turning off the "WebDAV" module as suggested here these 401s became 405 Method not allowed. In this case I only disabled the handlers as disabling both the handlers and the module meant that my application did not start at all (Error 500 without a stacktrace [custom errors are off]). I am planning to utilise the forms membership provider to add authentication capabilities to my API, however I removed any [Authorise] attributes from my code when 401s began appearing. Applications on 123Reg's shared hosting are run under Medium trust. I have been in contact with 123Reg support, and they have been semi helpful, but have since decided that they cannot help me further (They suggested adding HttpHandlers as detailed below) (Apparently, I should consult a web designer...) Things I have tried: I have added [AllowAnonymous] Attributes to my controllers and/or actions with no effect. I have added the authorization web.config attribute allowing all verbs and paths to all users both authenticated and not: <authorization>
  <allow users="*" />
  <allow users="?" />
  <allow verbs="*" users="*" />
  <allow verbs="*" users="?" />
</authorization>
 I have added (As suggested by 123Reg):  <system.webServer>
    <handlers>
      <remove name="WebDAV" />
      <add name="PUTVerbHandler" path="*" verb="PUT" modules="ProtocolSupportModule" resourceType="Unspecified" />
      <add name="DELETEVerbHandler" path="*" verb="DELETE" modules="ProtocolSupportModule" resourceType="Unspecified" />
    </handlers>
  </system.webServer>
 This appeared to be a step forward, as we now receive 405 responses rather then 401 respones, however I am now unable to make any further progress. Additionally I have also added: <httpHandlers>
    <add verb="*" path="*" type="System.Web.Mvc.MvcHttpHandler"/>
</httpHandlers>
 This also made no difference. Any help you can give would be much appreciated (I dont really want to have to move host for this application!)
@CODE:[Authorise] [AllowAnonymous] authorization <authorization>
  <allow users="*" />
  <allow users="?" />
  <allow verbs="*" users="*" />

@TITLE:using forms authentication with my own tables
@CONTENT:I have a small db, nothing fancy just 5 tables. I would like to use forms authentication but it creates its own db to do its stuff. I don't need anything fancy, and I certainly don't need the added infrastructure, but I'd like the security forms authentication provides. I have a person table, with a login and password field. how can I make it so forms uses these fields and returns my users id? is this even possible with forms? if not, how can I make it so forms creates it's infrastructure on my db so I can merge my tables with the ones forms needs to work? I know this is probably quite simple but I haven't found anything on the net after hours of research.

@CONTENT:Basically I have something like this: UPDATE
    Table
SET
    Table.col1 = other_table.col1,
FROM
    Table
INNER JOIN
    other_table
ON
    Table.id = other_table.id
 The problem is that I would like to update col1 with the select being like: SELECT SUM(col1) FROM other_table WHERE Table.id = other_table.id AND period > 2011
 Edit Correct Answer: UPDATE bestall  
INNER JOIN (SELECT bestid,SUM(view) as v,SUM(rawView) as rv 
                           FROM beststat 
                           WHERE period > 2011 GROUP BY bestid) as t1 
ON bestall.bestid = t1.bestid
SET view = t1.v, rawview = t1.rv
@CODE:UPDATE

@LINK:/questions/10257354/access-application-localization-resources-resx-from-library
@TITLE:Access Application Localization resources (resx) from Library
@CONTENT:I've seen the solution suggested here: Access resx in application from Silverlight class library and it works for the resources itself. My problem is slightly different: I have 2 apps that use the same library. They are localized so I have a resource folder and in the folder of the apps the files AppResource.resx, AppResource.it-IT.resx I have a library that includes XAML files and code as well. It is localized so I have a resource folder and in the folder of the apps the files LibResource.resx, LibResource.it-IT.resx The app is using the MvvmLight libraries. As suggested I've extended the class ViewModelBase in a ViewModelBaseExtended adding the fields: public class ViewModelBaseExtended : ViewModelBase
{
    private static LibResources resources = new LibResources();
    public LibResources Resources { get { return resources; } }
}
 The XAML in the library is able to access correctly the localized resources: <phone:PhoneApplicationPage x:Class="PhoneClassLibrary1.MainPage"
           DataContext="{Binding Main, Source={StaticResource Locator}}">

<StackPanel x:Name="TitlePanel"
Grid.Row="0"
Margin="24,24,0,12">
           <TextBlock x:Name="ApplicationTitle"
                Text="{Binding Resources.AppName}"
                Style="{StaticResource PhoneTextNormalStyle}" />
           <TextBlock x:Name="PageTitle"
                Text="{Binding Resources.LocalLib}"
                Margin="-3,-8,0,0"
                Style="{StaticResource PhoneTextTitle1Style}" />
</StackPanel>
 My problem is: how can I access from the library the AppResources in the application? I cannot refer to them directly Namespace.AppResources as the library is shared between applications and Namespace is not defined at design time and changes at run time. I have a full project ready to test with the exact configruation, files etxc.. all working apart from the access from library to application level. Applying the solution I mentioned in the beginning: private static AppResources _gResources;
public AppResources gResources { set {_gResources = value;}  get { return _gResources; } }

public ViewModelBaseExtended()
{
    var assembly = Application.Current.GetType().Assembly;
    var ast = assembly.FullName;
    char[] delimit = new char[] { ',' };
    string[] parts = ast.Split(delimit);

    gResources = new System.Resources.ResourceManager(parts[0]+ ".AppResources", assembly);
}
 I correctly does not compile with an error as gResources is an AppResource (or LibResource) class while ResourceManager returns a different object.
@CODE:public class ViewModelBaseExtended : ViewModelBase
{
    private static LibResources resources = new LibResources();
    public LibResources Resources { get { return resources; } }
} <phone:PhoneApplicationPage x:Class="PhoneClassLibrary1.MainPage"

@LINK:/questions/10257289/scala-instance-value-scoping
@TITLE:Scala instance value scoping
@CONTENT:Note that this question and similar ones have been asked before, such as in Scala: forward references - why does this code compile?, but I found the answers to still leave some questions open, so I'm having another go at this issue. Within methods and functions, the effect of the val keyword appears to be lexical, i.e. def foo {
  println(bar)
  val bar = 42
}
 yielding error: forward reference extends over definition of value bar
 However, within classes, the scoping rules of val seem to change: object Foo {
  def foo = bar
  println(bar)
  val bar = 42
}
 Not only does this compile, but also the println in the constructor will yield 0 as its output, while calling foo after the instance is fully constructed will result in the expected value 42. So it appears to be possible for methods to forward-reference instance values, which will, eventually, be initialised before the method can be called (unless, of course, you're calling it from the constructor), and for statements within the constructor to forward-reference values in the same way, accessing them before they've been initialised, resulting in a silly arbitrary value. From this, a couple of questions arise: Why does val use its lexical compile-time effect within constructors? Given that a constructor is really just a method, this seems rather inconsistent to entirely drop val's compile-time effect, giving it its usual run-time effect only. Why does val, effectively, lose its effect of declaring an immutable value? Accessing the value at different times may result in different results. To me, it very much seems like a compiler implementation detail leaking out. What might legitimate usecases for this look like? I'm having a hard time coming up with an example that absolutely requires the current semantics of val within constructors and wouldn't easily be implementable with a proper, lexical val, possibly in combination with lazy. How would one work around this behaviour of val, getting back all the guarantees one is used to from using it within other methods? One could, presumably, declare all instance vals to be lazy in order to get back to a val being immutable and yielding the same result no matter how they are accessed and to make the compile-time effect as observed within regular methods less relevant, but that seems like quite an awful hack to me for this sort of thing. Given that this behaviour unlikely to ever change within the actual language, would a compiler plugin be the right place to fix this issue, or is it possible to implement a val-alike keyword with, for someone who just spent an hour debugging an issue caused by this oddity, more sensible semantics within the language?
@CODE:val def foo {
  println(bar)
  val bar = 42
} error: forward reference extends over definition of value bar val object Foo {
  def foo = bar
  println(bar)
  val bar = 42
} println 0 foo 42 val val val val val lazy val val lazy val val

@TITLE:Returning an event from a function
@CONTENT:What is the syntax to return an event from a function? (Not to call the event, to return it so that it can be bound to functions). I have a container class that contains a dictionary where each members has an event. The aim is to be able to write something like this: Container c = new Container();
c.CreateEventForKey("a");             // Create the member in the dictionary
c.EventForKey("a") += some_function;  // Bind some_function to the event in the "a" member
c.OnEventForKey("a","b");             // Calls some_function with argument "b"
 The Container class looks like this: public class Container {

  public class Member {
     public event Action<string> AnEvent;
     public void OnEvent( string v ) { if(AnEvent!=null) { AnEvent(v); } }
  }

  protected Dictionary<string,Member> members;

  // This seems to work OK.
  public void OnEventForKey(string k, string v) {
    if ( members.ContainsKey(k) ) { members[k].OnEvent(v); }
    else { /* report error */ }
  }

  // Can't get this to compile.
  public event Action<string> EventForKey(string k ) {
    if ( members.ContainsKey(k) ) { return members[k].AnEvent; }
    else { /* report error */ }
  }
}

@CODE:Container c = new Container();
c.CreateEventForKey("a");             // Create the member in the dictionary
c.EventForKey("a") += some_function;  // Bind some_function to the event in the "a" member
c.OnEventForKey("a","b");             // Calls some_function with argument "b" public class Container {

  // This seems to work OK.
  public void OnEventForKey(string k, string v) {

  // Can't get this to compile.
  public event Action<string> EventForKey(string k ) {
    if ( members.ContainsKey(k) ) { return members[k].AnEvent; }

  }
} EventForKey c.EventForKey("a") += some_function; c.members["a"].AnEvent += some_function event Operator '+' cannot be used with a left hand side of type 'function(string): void' and a right hand side of type 'function(string): void'. c.EventForKey("a") += some_function;

My Main activity creates and alarm in the alarm manager which supposed to fire in specific time, my main Activity also create Broadcast receiver which suppose to receive the Intent that the alarm fired, everything is working good until Task manager killing my App. I've check the PendingIntent list in the AlarmManager and verify that my alarm is getting erased from the Alarm Manager, I try to add service and register alarm from the service, I've red that maybe because my IntentFilter of the Broadcast receiver is defined in code and not in manifest it get killed after app process is killed, and I'm stuck on this issue for two weeks :-(, with big confuse, my design is wrong ? Here is my needs: That the alarm will be very reliable, even if app is killed or even if phone is restart. Same goes to the broadcast receiver. Thank you in advance,

@TITLE:XML input/output with Fitnesse
@CONTENT:I want to create automated tests which accept XML and verify that the XML returned is what was expected. Also, the end user needs to be able to add new data (XML input + expected XML output) without having to get into the code. It seems like Fitnesse should be able to do this, but I haven't figured out a good way to do it yet. Any recommendations? Tools other than Fitnesse that will work better? The code which needs tested is in .NET. Eventually I would like to integrate these test results into a continuous integration server. Thanks

@TITLE:Windows CE 6.0 - Installing SQL Server CE 3.5 into the run-time image
@CONTENT:I made an application that I put onto the hard disk of Win CE (the Compact Flash card). My problem is that the application is using the SQL Server CE 3.5 database but it looks like that the image is created with the SQL Server CE 3.0. I couldn't select the 3.5 version when I started to build the image. The 3.5 version dlls are deployed every time I debug the application so the problem never shows up in the development phase. Now when the application starts (it is started automatically when OS boots) the message window with exceptions pops up and don't let the application to start. My question is how to install the SQL Server CE 3.5 into the image or how to install it using CAB files later or on every boot up time. When I run the correct CAB files (three CAB) on running OS system it installs the 3.5 version and my application starts but when I reboot the OS again the changes are not saved and commit. There must be a solution to add the 3.5 version in the catalog before building the image or to install it on every boot up time or the last option to install it permanently once after the first boot. If you can provide me the solution to install the CABs every time the system boots up It will work for me but then take into the consideration that I have to run the application that will use the SQL Server CE 3.5 database on system start so the installation of the CABs must precede the application autostart. Thanks in advance.

@TITLE:ADO.Net best practice - Single vs multiple Connections when making asynchronous db calls
@CONTENT:I am using ADO.Net for connecting to some Sql Server and Oracle databases, and I want to run some of my queries concurrently. I use classes from SqlClient namespace for Sql Server and ODP.Net for Oracle. For Sql Server I added MARS option to the connection string, and call asynchronous APIs on SqlCommand. ODP.Net does not provide asynchronous API, so I have to give my concurrent Oracle commands separate threads. My question is, how should I handle connection objects? Should I create one DbConnection per each database instance and execute commands asynchronously against a single connection, or should I give a separate connection object to each of my concurrent commands? Does a shared connection object become a contention point for multiple commands executing through it simultaneously? I will write some comparison tests but would love to hear from somebody who has experience with asynchronous database commands. Thank you in advance!

@CONTENT:I've been experimenting with connecting an audio element to the web audio api using createMediaElementSource and got it to work but one thing I need to do is change the playback rate of the audio tag and I couldn't get that to work.

@TITLE:PUT + DELETE Http Verbs returning 401/405 from API on shared hosting webserver
@CONTENT:I have created an MVC Web Api for some university coursework, that works as expected on my development machine (Running VS11). However when I deploy the application to the webserver on 123reg HttpVerbs other than GET and POST appear to not reach my application at all, initially a 401 Not Authorised response was returned; however after turning off the "WebDAV" module as suggested here these 401s became 405 Method not allowed. In this case I only disabled the handlers as disabling both the handlers and the module meant that my application did not start at all (Error 500 without a stacktrace [custom errors are off]). I am planning to utilise the forms membership provider to add authentication capabilities to my API, however I removed any [Authorise] attributes from my code when 401s began appearing. Applications on 123Reg's shared hosting are run under Medium trust. I have been in contact with 123Reg support, and they have been semi helpful, but have since decided that they cannot help me further (They suggested adding HttpHandlers as detailed below) (Apparently, I should consult a web designer...) Things I have tried: I have added [AllowAnonymous] Attributes to my controllers and/or actions with no effect. I have added the authorization web.config attribute allowing all verbs and paths to all users both authenticated and not: <authorization>
  <allow users="*" />
  <allow users="?" />
  <allow verbs="*" users="*" />
  <allow verbs="*" users="?" />
</authorization>
 I have added (As suggested by 123Reg):  <system.webServer>
    <handlers>
      <remove name="WebDAV" />
      <add name="PUTVerbHandler" path="*" verb="PUT" modules="ProtocolSupportModule" resourceType="Unspecified" />
      <add name="DELETEVerbHandler" path="*" verb="DELETE" modules="ProtocolSupportModule" resourceType="Unspecified" />
    </handlers>
  </system.webServer>
 This appeared to be a step forward, as we now receive 405 responses rather then 401 respones, however I am now unable to make any further progress. Additionally I have also added: <httpHandlers>
    <add verb="*" path="*" type="System.Web.Mvc.MvcHttpHandler"/>
</httpHandlers>
 This also made no difference. Any help you can give would be much appreciated (I dont really want to have to move host for this application!)

 I'm linking with 3 modules: opencv_core opencv_calib3d opencv_imgproc. What am I missing ? Edit. I've added opencv_flann library and reduced the error count. But where are cv::line or for example cv::rectangle are defined ?

@LINK:/questions/10234757/cakephp-2-1-auth-login-not-working-but-adding-user-does
@TITLE:CakePHP 2.1 Auth->login() not working, but adding user does
@CONTENT:I've searched through many posts on stackoverflow for an answer, and prehaps I'm just overlooking something, but I can't seem to get $this->Auth->login() to work. I've tried many different suggestions from other posts. I will try to be as thorough as possible when describing other methods I've tried. I do have adding a user working. The MD5 hashing is working correctly. I hashed a password and then checked it using miracle salad md5 http://www.miraclesalad.com/webtools/md5.php I do not use a salt for hashing. I use MD5 without a salt. The database I'm using is Postgresql 9.0. I know some of the CakePhp magic doesn't work for all databases (or so I've been told). app/Config/core.php Configure::write('Security.level', 'medium');

/**
* A random string used in security hashing methods.
*/

    Configure::write('Security.salt', '');
 I was using Auth->fields to map password to user_password and username to user_name in the DB. user_password and user_name are the columns in the core_users table. I also had in the beforeFilter() method. $this->Auth->fields = array('username' => 'user_name', 'password' => 'user_password');
 app/Controller/AppController.php class AppController extends Controller {
public $components = array(
    'Session',
    'Auth' => array(

        'logoutRedirect' => array('controller' => 'pages', 'action' => 'display', 'home'),
        'loginAction' => array('admin' => false, 'controller' => 'CoreUsers', 'action' => 'login'),
        /*'fields' => array('password' => 'user_password', 'username' => 'user_name'),*/

            debug($this->Auth->request->data['CoreUser']['user_password']);
            $this->redirect($this->Auth->redirect());

        } else {

 Version of CakePHP '2.1.0'
 Password before login() is called 'test'
 Username before login() is called  'testy5'
 Password after login() is called  'test'
 Here is a quick list of things that I've read in other stackoverflow post that I've tried. Let me know if you need to me to elaborate. 1) I mapped username and password to the fields in the DB. It's where the comments are for fields. I also tried doing it in the beforeFilter() method. Using: $this->Auth->fields = array('username' => 'user_name', 'password' => 'user_password');
 In the login view the form was created as such: $this->Form->input('username');
$this->Form->input('password');
 2) I tried hashing the password manually before login like so:  $this->Auth->request->data['CoreUser']['password'] = Security::hash($this->Auth->request->data['CoreUser']['password'])
   if ($this->Auth->login()) {
            $this->redirect($this->Auth->redirect());
   }
 EDIT0 3) I just tried doing this as recommended by CakePHP 2.0 Auth Login not working My AuthComponent now looks like this:      public $components = array(
    'Session',
    'Auth' => array(
        'authenticate' => array(
            'Form' => array(
                'userModel' => 'CoreUser',
                'fields' => array(
                    'username' => 'user_name',
                    'password' => 'user_password'
                )
            )
        ),
        'loginRedirect' => array('controller' => 'pages', 'action' => 'index'),
        'logoutRedirect' => array('controller' => 'pages', 'action' => 'display', 'home'),
        'loginAction' => array('admin' => false, 'controller' => 'CoreUsers', 'action' => 'login')
    )
);
 I apologize if I didn't elaborate enough, or I made a mistake. I've been working on this for a couple of days and it has really drained me. I appreciate any help I may receive. Thanks!

@LINK:/questions/10234219/how-to-implement-a-security-token-in-a-wcf-soap-response
@TITLE:How to implement a Security token in a WCF soap response?
@CONTENT:I am implementing an API from a bank and they require a security token to be provided. In the header of every soap message there is something which looks as follows: <soapenv:Header>
  <tpw:BinarySecurityToken ValueType="MAC" Id="DesMacToken" EncodingType="Base64" Value="**xvz**"/>
</soapenv:Header>
 According to their documentation I need to generate an 8 byte MAC value on the body of each message. The MAC is generated by the CBC-MAC algorithm and DES as the block cipher. The contents of the soapenv:Body tag of each message is used as the data for the MAC calculation. So my question is how do I get WCF to do this? I have put the following code together to create the MAC value, but am unsure how to get this into the header of every message. private string GenerateMAC(string SoapXML)
        {
            ASCIIEncoding encoding = new ASCIIEncoding();

            //Convert from Hex to Bin
            byte[] Key = StringToByteArray(HexKey);
            //Convert String to Bytes
            byte[] XML = encoding.GetBytes(SoapXML);

            //Perform the Mac goodies
            MACTripleDES DesMac = new MACTripleDES(Key);
            byte[] Mac = DesMac.ComputeHash(XML);

            //Base64 the Mac
            string Base64Mac = Convert.ToBase64String(Mac);

            return Base64Mac;
        }

        public static byte[] StringToByteArray(string Hex)
        {
            if (Hex.Length % 2 != 0)
            {
                throw new ArgumentException();
            }

            byte[] HexAsBin = new byte[Hex.Length / 2];
            for (int index = 0; index < HexAsBin.Length; index++)
            {
                string bytevalue = Hex.Substring(index * 2, 2);
                HexAsBin[index] = Convert.ToByte(bytevalue, 16);
            }

@LINK:/questions/10233686/i18n-markdown-files-in-rails-3-views
@TITLE:i18n markdown files in Rails 3 views
@CONTENT:I am currently working through Michael Hartl's Rails Tutorial while experimenting with some other things not covered in the book. After completing Chapter 5, where the static pages are created, I decided change the view code to HAML, internationalize the pages, and put the static content into separate (non-partial) Markdown files, using the RDiscount gem to render them. For example: app/views/static_pages/about.html.haml - provide(:title, t('.about_us'))
:markdown
  #{render file: "static_pages/about.#{params[:locale]}.md"}
 Under the static_pages directory, I have Markdown files like about.en.md, about.it.md, about.ja.md etc, so interpolating in the :locale parameter is what determines which language Markdown file gets rendered. My questions are: The static_pages directory is a bit crowded with Markdown files, so are there any sensible default/best practice locations (perhaps outside of the app directory) to keep these Markdown files, where they could be presumably be edited by people who don't need to know about the inner workings of the app? What better ways are there to implement rendering multi-lingual Markdown files in views? My use of :locale and the double string-interpolation seems inelegant. Is there a way to change this code so that I can pass Ruby variables into the Markdown file? I know I can, for example, use a #{language} variable in the Markdown by just changing about.en.md into a HAML partial (_about.en.html.haml) and change the code to look something like: app/views/static_pages/about.html.haml - provide(:title, t('.about_us'))
:markdown
  #{render "about.#{params[:locale]}", language: 'Markdown!'}
 But, is there a way to do this without changing the Markdown file into another type of file? If such a way exists, is it recommended/feasible?
@CODE:- provide(:title, t('.about_us'))
:markdown
  #{render file: "static_pages/about.#{params[:locale]}.md"} :locale :locale #{language} - provide(:title, t('.about_us'))
:markdown
  #{render "about.#{params[:locale]}", language: 'Markdown!'}

@CONTENT:The ONLY argument I can see for SOAP WCF over REST (json) wcf is the fact that once my service is created I can add a a reference in visual studio and I get a load of strongly typed classes ready for me and a client class that I can call all my webmethod through.

@CONTENT:I have a dynamic form for creating chapters and sub-chapters that creates an array: var_dump($_POST); array{["textfield"] => array {
                       [0] => "title one"
                       [1] => "title two"
                       [2] => "title three"
                       [4] => "title four"
                       }
      ["textarea"] => array {
                       [0] => "title text"
                       [1] => "title summary"
                       [2] => "title description"
                       [4] => "title details"
                       }
      ["hidden"] => array {
                       [0] => "1"
                       [1] => "2"
                       [2] => "3"
                       [4] => "1"
                       }
      }
 I'm very weak with arrays. Ive read several articles on multidimentional arrays and sorting but havent had any luck or seen any examples closely enough resembling mine for me to understand how I need to adjust this. I would like to for each: <div class="row<? echo $hidden ?>">
    <h2><? echo $textfield ?></h2>
    <h3><? echo $textarea ?></h3>
</div>
 that matches key 0 (or corresponding key number) and value through several arrays. Similar to: <div class="row<? echo $_POST['hidden'][0] ?>">
    <h2><? echo $_POST['textfield'][0] ?></h2>
    <h3><? echo $_POST['textarea'][0] ?></h3>
</div>
<div class="row<? echo $_POST['hidden'][1] ?>">
    <h2><? echo $_POST['textfield'][1] ?></h2>
    <h3><? echo $_POST['textarea'][1] ?></h3>
</div>
<div class="row<? echo $_POST['hidden'][2] ?>">
    <h2><? echo $_POST['textfield'][2] ?></h2>
    <h3><? echo $_POST['textarea'][2] ?></h3>
</div>
<div class="row<? echo $_POST['hidden'][3] ?>">
    <h2><? echo $_POST['textfield'][3] ?></h2>
    <h3><? echo $_POST['textarea'][3] ?></h3>
</div>
 This form could dynamically be created hundreds deep and I've only been able to print the entire array or all $values for each $key. Ive not had any success matching through various arrays. I hope you follow. If you have any suggestions, I'd be very grateful.
@CODE:array{["textfield"] => array {

                       [4] => "title four"
                       }
      ["textarea"] => array {

@TITLE:Encoding issue while generating pdf file from HTML using ITextRenderer
@CONTENT:I am trying to generate a pdf document using ITextRenderer that contains non-latin characters. In my case here is Bulgarian. Before calling ITextRenderer, I have a String content that after some processes (like parsing with tidy) looks like that (I am able to see this value through debugging) Sting content: td class="description">??? ?? ??????</td>
td class="description">?????? ?? ??????</td>
 The above is just a part of my String. This content contains a valid html syntax. I just put here a small part of it to clarify that until this part, my encoding is right since I am able to read Bulgarian characters. After that, the following code takes place which creates a document, put it in itextrenderer and generate the pdf file. This code is already tested and working for contents of lating characters since I was able to successfully generate a pdf file for english language. The problem appears when I switch in another language (Bulgarian) with non latin characters. The generated PDF ignores all the bulgarian characters and the final result is a pdf with a lot of empty lines. This is the part of the code that generates the pdf         DocumentBuilderFactory dbf = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();

        dbf.setValidating(false);
        dbf.setNamespaceAware(false);
        dbf.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/namespaces", false);
        dbf.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/validation", false);

        dbf.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/nonvalidating/load-external-dtd", false);

        DocumentBuilder builder = dbf.newDocumentBuilder();

        Document doc = builder.parse(new ByteArrayInputStream(content.getBytes("UTF-8")));

        ByteArrayOutputStream outputStream = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
        InputStream is = null;

        ITextRenderer renderer = new ITextRenderer();

        renderer.getFontResolver().addFont("fonts/TIMES.TTF", BaseFont.IDENTITY_H, BaseFont.EMBEDDED);
        renderer.getFontResolver().addFont("fonts/TIMESBD.TTF", BaseFont.IDENTITY_H, BaseFont.EMBEDDED);

        renderer.getFontResolver().addFont("fonts/TIMESI.TTF", BaseFont.IDENTITY_H, BaseFont.EMBEDDED);


        renderer.setDocument(doc, null);
        renderer.layout();
        renderer.createPDF(outputStream);
        outputStream.close();


        byte[] outputBytes = outputStream.toByteArray();
        is = new ByteArrayInputStream(outputBytes);
        response.setContentType("application");
        response.addHeader("Content-Disposition", "attachment; filename=\"" + "exported.pdf" + "\"");
        response.setContentLength(outputBytes.length);
        response.getOutputStream().write(inputStreamToBytes(is));
 I have tried several things (mainly related to encoding) but unfortunately I haven't found a solution yet. Probably I am missing something obvious here :) I am not sure if this adds any value, but I am using spring and this code runs inside a Controller Any help will be appreciated. Thanx

@TITLE:Unhandled Exception using glGenBuffer on Release mode only - QT
@CONTENT:I'm having some trouble while compiling my project on Windows 7 using Qt 4.8 on Release mode. Everything works fine on Debug, but on Release I get an Unhandled Exception: 0xC0000005: Access violation. I narrowed it down to the line where this happens, which is when I generate my Pixel Buffers. My first guess would be wrong DLLs loading, but I checked the executable with Dependency Walker and every DLL loaded is correct. Here goes some of my code: class CameraView : public QGLWidget, protected QGLFunctions;
void CameraView::initializeGL()
{

    initializeGLFunctions(this->context());

    glGenBuffers(1, &pbo_); //<<<<<  This is where I get the unhandled exception on Release mode
        glBindBuffer(QGLBuffer::PixelUnpackBuffer, pbo_);
        glBufferData(QGLBuffer::PixelUnpackBuffer, 3 * sizeof(BYTE) * image_width_ * image_height_, NULL, GL_STREAM_DRAW);
        ...
}
 Again, this works great on debug. Why would this only happen on Release?
@CODE:class CameraView : public QGLWidget, protected QGLFunctions;
void CameraView::initializeGL()
{

    initializeGLFunctions(this->context());

    glGenBuffers(1, &pbo_); //<<<<<  This is where I get the unhandled exception on Release mode
        glBindBuffer(QGLBuffer::PixelUnpackBuffer, pbo_);
        glBufferData(QGLBuffer::PixelUnpackBuffer, 3 * sizeof(BYTE) * image_width_ * image_height_, NULL, GL_STREAM_DRAW);

@TITLE:Printing while reading characters in C
@CONTENT:I'm trying to write a simple little snippet of code to respond to an arrow key press. I know that up is represented by ^[[A, and I have the following code that checks for that sequence:      while( 1 )
     {
         input_char = fgetc( stdin );

         if( input_char == EOF || input_char == '\n' )
         {
             break;
         }

         /* Escape sequence */
         if( input_char == 27 )
         {
             input_char = getc( stdin );

             if( input_char == '[' )
             {
                 switch( getc( stdin ) )
                 {
                     case 'A':
                     printf("Move up\n");
                     break;
                 }
             }
         }
     }
 Whenever I hit "up", the escape sequence (^[[A) shows up on the screen, but "Move up" doesn't appear until I hit enter. The end goal is to replace the text on the current line with some other data, and so I tried to do printf("\r%s", "New Text");
 in place of "Move up", but it still doesn't show up until after enter is pressed. Is there something wrong with the way I'm reading in characters? Thanks! EDIT Quick note, it's for *nix systems. SOLUTION Thanks for the pointers everyone. I went with stepanbujnak's solution because it was rather straightforward. The one thing I noticed is that a lot of the behavior of keys that modify the string ( backspace, etc ) is different than you would expect. It will backspace through ANYTHING on the line (including printf'd stuff), and I had to account for that. After that it wasn't too bad getting the rest to fall in line :)

@TITLE:Share unfinished work (uncommited and new files) via Git
@CONTENT:I do my work from three different workstations. I would like to be able to leave a workstation in the middle of a coding sessions and resume this work later on another workstation. Given that the code is shared via a remote git repo, I would like to use git to share this unfinished work. In practical terms, unfinished work means there are changed files, there are new untracked files, there are deleted files. Most of the times these changes are temporary: not all the changes and most of the untracked files will finish in the final commit. An example of untracked file is a test file duplicated with 20 slightly different modifications for test purposes; I care about all these files only while I'm working on a certain problem and I do not want to lose time regenerating them when switching to another workstation. I have seen other questions and solutions that use a branch to push these changes: while I am OK with this, there is the problem that these branches will be rewritten every time, requiring a git push --force (I do not like --force much) or allowing them to become very messy over the time. What I would like to have is a simple command or git alias that allow me to store the current state of the work directory without "messing too much" with the git history. There must be a companion simple command or git alias that allow me to download these temporary changes from the other workstations.

 It gave me an "500 Internal Server Error". I checked using firebug console. Did i do something wrong in the ajax call? Thanks.

@TITLE:Escaping $ when executing a remote bash command from python fabric
@CONTENT:So I am trying to automate the set up of an arch linux instance via a python fabric script like this: from fabric.api import run, sudo

def server_setup_communityrepo():
    run('echo \'echo "[archlinuxfr]" >> /etc/pacman.conf\' | sudo -s')
    run('echo \'echo "Server = http://repo.archlinux.fr/$arch" >> /etc/pacman.conf\' | sudo -s')
    run('echo \'echo " " >> /etc/pacman.conf\' | sudo -s')
    sudo('pacman -Syy yaourt --noconfirm')
 The problem occurs on the second run() call because of the $ sign in the $arch. This fabric function fails in line 2 because $ followed by a string is recognized by fabric as a config variable. But I actually want $arch to be understood as a literal in the echo 'echo "Server = http://repo.archlinux.fr/$arch" >> /etc/pacman.conf' call in bash shell. How do I "escape" from this fabric quirk and designate the $arch as a literal to be written into my pacman.conf file?
@CODE:from fabric.api import run, sudo

def server_setup_communityrepo():
    run('echo \'echo "[archlinuxfr]" >> /etc/pacman.conf\' | sudo -s')
    run('echo \'echo "Server = http://repo.archlinux.fr/$arch" >> /etc/pacman.conf\' | sudo -s')

    sudo('pacman -Syy yaourt --noconfirm') run() $arch echo 'echo "Server = http://repo.archlinux.fr/$arch" >> /etc/pacman.conf' \$

@TITLE:How to generate the password in PHP as it did by Devise Gem in Ruby on Rails
@CONTENT:I'm renewing a website from Ruby on Rails to PHP. I need to generate the passwords which are generated by Devise Gem in Ruby on Rails. I have to know what is the hashing method for password to create same method with PHP. but it's not easy to find that codes inside the Ruby on Rails as a beginner. If somebody know where should I check to find it, please help me. These two are all what I found: 1) The configuration of encryptor is disabled in devise.rb like below:
  # config.encryptor = :sha1
2) I read the comments very carefully then I found that they using sha512 and bcrypt as default encryptor.
  # (default), :sha512 and :bcrypt. Devise also supports encryptors from others
 I tried to make the same encrypted password in different ways with PHP: 1) sha1('--'.$password_salt.'--'.$encrypted_password);
2) sha1($password_salt.'-----'.$encrypted_password);
3) sha1('--'.$password_salt.'--'.$encrypted_password.'--');
4) sha1($password_salt.$encrypted_password);
5) sha1($encrypted_password.$password_salt);
6) substr(hash('sha512', $password_salt.$encrypted_password, false), 20);
7) substr(hash('sha512', $encrypted_password.$password_salt, false), 0, 40);
8) hash('sha512', $encrypted_password.$password_salt, false);
9) hash('sha512', $password_salt.$encrypted_password, false);
10) substr(hash('sha512', '--'.$password_salt.'--'.$encrypted_password.'--', false), 0, 40);
 I couldn't get the same result from any of above. Is there anybody whom could tell me the encryption method of Devise Gem?? HELP ME!!! ps. I'm not good at English. Even if my English is not correct, please don't be angry. I'm answering myself: The Encryptor is Sha1 I was looking only "devise.rb" in the folder "\config\initializers" The encryptor was commanted as "# config.encryptor = :sha1" But there is one more "devise.rb" inside the Ruby lib folder, "\Ruby191\lib\ruby\gems\1.9.1\gems\devise-1.0.8\lib\devise.rb" There is one more configuration as "@@encryptor = :sha1" Encryption Method using Sha1 When you go to the file below you will see the codes for algorithm: \Ruby191\lib\ruby\gems\1.9.1\gems\devise-1.0.8\lib\devise\encryptors\sha1.rb require "digest/sha1" module Devise module Encryptors # = Sha1 # Uses the Sha1 hash algorithm to encrypt passwords. class Sha1 < Base         # Gererates a default password digest based on stretches, salt, pepper and the
        # incoming password.
        def self.digest(password, stretches, salt, pepper)
            digest = pepper
            stretches.times { digest = self.secure_digest(salt, digest, password, pepper) }
            digest
        end

        private

        # Generate a SHA1 digest joining args. Generated token is something like
        #     --arg1--arg2--arg3--argN--
        def self.secure_digest(*tokens)
            ::Digest::SHA1.hexdigest('--' << tokens.flatten.join('--') << '--')
        end

    end
end
 end So I translated to PHP function encrypt_password($salt, $password) {
    $pepper = '';
    $digest = $pepper;
    $stretches = 10;

    for ($i=0; $i<$stretches; $i++) {
        $join = '--'.$salt.'--'.$digest.'--'.$password.'--'.$pepper.'--';
        $digest = Sha1($join);
    }
    $result = substr($digest, 0, 40);
    return $result;
}
 it's working very well :-)

                 @"Car.",
                 @"Keys.", nil];
 Now when I press 'EDIT' in the navigation bar, and delete a row, I get following Error Message Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInternalInconsistencyException', reason: 'Invalid update: invalid number of rows in section 0. The number of rows contained in an existing section after the update (3) must be equal to the number of rows contained in that section before the update (3), plus or minus the number of rows inserted or deleted from that section (0 inserted, 1 deleted) and plus or minus the number of rows moved into or out of that section (0 moved in, 0 moved out).' I use this code for the 'delete' command: - (void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView commitEditingStyle:(UITableViewCellEditingStyle)editingStyle forRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath

}
 Any insights on how to make the delete row function work? EDIT: Found it: Placing the following line of code in the worked: [self.itemTable removeObjectAtIndex:indexPath.row];
 Which makes the delete code: - (void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView commitEditingStyle:(UITableViewCellEditingStyle)editingStyle forRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath

@TITLE:JMeter NTLM/Windows Authentication Load Testing
@CONTENT:What is to be done? We have an application deployed on the Sharepoint (corporate) Server which uses the windows credentials to log into the application. App URL format: http://testmachine:1000/sites/test/ Windows Credentials Format: user_id@domain.co.in The objective is to perform the load/performance testing on the application (especially the log in functionality) for such n number of users. Normally when I hit the app URL in the Firefox/IE, it pops up a window asking for credentials. I enter the credentials, browse the app and then log out. I intend to capture this in JMeter and simulate this for large number of users. Where Im stuck? Now I start the JMeter proxy server, and then try the same steps as above. But when the pop up window appears, JMeter simply doesnt record the it nor it does record anything else after the login. What Ive tried? If I try the same steps after enabling Automatically detect intranet network in IE, then it simply auto detects my windows credentials (No credentials pop-up), logs me into the app (this is not recorded in JMeter either) and takes me to the home page. And any page thereafter I hit gets recorded in JMeter. Ive also tried to use the HTTP Authorization Manager using following parameters: BaseURL : http://testmachine:1000/sites/test/ Username: DOMAIN\USER_ID Password: i_wont_tell_you Domain: \ Realm: It didn't help. I am quite confused about how-to-use the above element. And not even sure whether its a right approach to get the solution to my problem. Any help/suggestions? P.S. I know about a tool called Badboy, but have to go for it as a last resource. Also not even sure if it records the pop windows. And sorry if the post is verbose. UPDATE: I have also tried - Username: USER_ID and Domain: my_company_domain
 But this is not the actual problem. Problem is, when I try to hit the pages (automation) which I've recorded previously return success response even if I haven't used the HTTP Authorization Manager. I'm not sure what I'm missing.

@TITLE:DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding decryption in PHP
@CONTENT:I'm in the need of decrypting with PHP (or Javascript) some service calls. I've spent all the day trying to accomplish, this, but I've been unable to decrypt it properly. As a reference, the service provider sent me the following decryption sample code in Java: DESKeySpec dks = new DESKeySpec("keyword".getBytes()); 
SecretKeyFactory keyFactory = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance("DES");
SecretKey key = keyFactory.generateSecret(dks);

Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding");
SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();  
cipher.init( Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, key ,sr); 

byte b[] = response.toByteArray();      
byte decryptedData[] = cipher.doFinal( b );
 I think I'm in the correct path by using: $td = mcrypt_module_open(MCRYPT_DES, '', 'ecb', '');
$iv_size = mcrypt_enc_get_iv_size($td);
$iv = mcrypt_create_iv($iv_size, MCRYPT_RAND);
$key = substr($keyword, 0, mcrypt_enc_get_key_size($td));
mcrypt_generic_init($td, $key, $iv);
$decrypted = mdecrypt_generic($td, $data);
$decrypted = pkcs5_unpad($decrypted);
 But, frankly, I'm sure I'm messing everything with the $iv creationg and $keyword setup (or maybe with $data or $decrypted types?). The pkcs5_unpad function is as follows: function pkcs5_unpad($text)
{
   $pad = ord($text{strlen($text)-1});
   if ($pad > strlen($text)) return false;
   return substr($text, 0, -1 * $pad);
}
 I'm not only a noob on php, but also on cryptography techniques... could you please help me to solve this issue?

@TITLE:bash, zsh : declare [*] (oh my)
@CONTENT:I'm working with a bash script that has the following syntax $ declare -a THIS[*]
 This seems to be illegal in zsh (I get a "no matches found: THIS[*]" error). Can anyone help me translate this to zsh? Also - what does the [*] syntax mean? (I know we're declaring an array, but why the [*]?) update To provide an example of where the code is used, and explain how it is valid - I've copied a few lines from Eric Engstrom's post on password free ssh declare -a SSSHA_KEYS[*]

# --- PARSE ARGS --- #

  while getopts "xe:k:t:" OPT; do
    #echo "$OPT $OPTARG $OPTIND"

 I believe the [*] is being used as some kind of dynamic iterator (as we don't know how many items it will have later). I'd just like to know of the equivalent declaration in zsh!

@TITLE:Splitting a string into multiple variables in C++
@CONTENT:I'm writing a program that reads a string from the user and uses it to process a request. After issuing a prompt, I can expect one of three possible responses in the form of either: string string string integer string Depending on which type of command the user gives, the program is to do a different task. I'm having a difficult time trying to process the users input. To be clear, the user will type the command as a single string, so an example of a user exercising option two might input "age 8" after the prompt. In this example I would like the program to store "age" as a string and '8' as an integer. What would be a good way of going about this? From what I've gathered on here, using strtok() or boost might be a solution. I've tried both without success however and it would be very helpful if someone could help make things clearer.

@LINK:/questions/10191815/limit-results-on-an-group-concat-or-inner-join
@TITLE:Limit results on an GROUP_CONCAT() or INNER JOIN
@CONTENT:I've perused extensively the other threads talking about limits on group_concat() and inner joins but haven't found my answer, so I guess I'll go ahead and ask it: I'm developing an existing photo community site. I want to retrieve members who have their birthday on a given day (today) and then retrieve each member's 5 most highly rated photos. But I also only want the 10 "most favorite" birthday members (ie with the highest favorite count). Here's what I have: SELECT users.user_id, users.user_name, 
       GROUP_CONCAT(CONVERT(photos.photo_id,char(32)) 
                    ORDER BY photos.average_rate) as photo_ids
FROM users 
INNER JOIN photos ON photos.user_id=users.user_id
WHERE users.day_of_birth = DATE_FORMAT('2012-04-17', '%m-%d') 
  AND users.photo_count>0 
GROUP BY users.user_id
ORDER BY users.favorite_count DESC, users.photo_count DESC LIMIT 0,10
 This does what I want, EXCEPT that I cannot limit the amount of photo_ids to 5. This is a problem since the output will be sent as JSON to the app, and some members have uploaded upwards of 20,000 photos already, leading to an unacceptably long output string. The only "solution" that seems to work for me is setting the sever variable group_concat_max_len to something reasonable that will hold at least 5 ids, but this is very hacky and unreliable. Is there any way to return exactly 5 photo_ids per user with a single query? Or will I need to do a loop in my PHP? I don't necessarily need the photo_ids in a comma-separated value, I can also ditch the group_concat() approach entirely and do an inner join if that is more feasible. But even there I'm not aware of a way to limit the results to 5.
@CODE:SELECT users.user_id, users.user_name, 
       GROUP_CONCAT(CONVERT(photos.photo_id,char(32)) 
                    ORDER BY photos.average_rate) as photo_ids
FROM users 
INNER JOIN photos ON photos.user_id=users.user_id
WHERE users.day_of_birth = DATE_FORMAT('2012-04-17', '%m-%d') 
  AND users.photo_count>0 
GROUP BY users.user_id

@TITLE:Display two divs in a single line filling space - CSS
@CONTENT:I have two divs diva and divb. They have a fixed height of 30px. I want to display them in a single line, one after the other. This can be done by giving them widths of 10% and 90% respectively and by float: left. This works fine. But I gave them a border of 1 px and this disturbs the calculation. I gave the second div a width of 88% and is working. But there is an empty space after that div. I want both the divs to display in a single line. The page re sizes and I want divs to fill space and so that I can't give them fixed width. The first div may be given a fixed width, because I just want it 150 px wide. But the second div must be wider to fill space. What I am getting is this; and I want this: Here is the fiddle.

In the tab order designer I can only access the component itself which cannot have focus because it is a panel. What happens at runtime is that I can access the edits using the tab key, but only after the two buttons below the component got focused. How can I change the tab order in this situation?

 Not sure what I am doing wrong. I am a bit new to this. UPDATE: Ok so.. What I mean is.. I want to change the Activity using tabs. Heres is how I did it. The answer was to set the content by Intent instead using tabHost.addTab(tabHost.newTabSpec("tab2") .setIndicator("Something") .setContent(new Intent(this, myActivity.class))); Thankyou all those who helped. It made me consider more options. Cheers, Joe.
@CODE:tab activity public class TabViews extends TabActivity {

@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.tabviews);
    TabHost tabHost = getTabHost();

    LayoutInflater.from(this).inflate(R.layout.tabviews, tabHost.getTabContentView(), true);

    tabHost.addTab(tabHost.newTabSpec("apples")
            .setIndicator("Apples")
            .setContent(R.id.apples));
    tabHost.addTab(tabHost.newTabSpec("events")
            .setIndicator("Events")
            .setContent(R.id.events));
    tabHost.addTab(tabHost.newTabSpec("attend")
            .setIndicator("Attending")
            .setContent(R.id.attend));

@TITLE:SSLException during handshake while resuming cached session [duplicate]
@CONTENT:Possible Duplicate: SSL handshake alert: unrecognized_name error since upgrade to Java 1.7.0 My J2SE app uses HttpsUrlConnection to access a secure location. It used to work just fine until I updated my JRE to 1.7. Now I get the "Remote host closed connection during handshake" SSLException. After running the app using -Djavax.net.debug=ssl:handshake, both under JRE 1.6 and JRE 1.7, my impression is that under 1.7 the cached client session fails to resume. UPDATE: I have come to understand that under JRE 1.6 my client app uses SSLv2Hello encapsulation. However it does not do that under JRE 1.7, which is most probably what causes the exception. My question is now this: how do I enable SSLv2Hello encapsulation for clients running on JRE 1.7? UPDATE #2: SSLv2Hello accomplished on JRE 7 via System.setProperty("https.protocols", "TLSv1,SSLv2Hello"). However this didn't make the handshake exception go away. Turns out that the true reason for the exception is the cipher suite. On JRE 6 the server picks SSL_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5 out of the client's options, while on JRE 7 it always goes with TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA. For some reason the server can't resume cached sessions using TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA. Problem patched using System.setProperty("https.cipherSuites", suggestedCipherSuites) where suggestedCipherSuites always starts with SSL_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5. Any downsides with this approach? UPDATE #3: The SNI extension of the client is what bothers the server. See "Server Name Indication (SNI) for JSSE client" at http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/security/enhancements7.html

@TITLE:Retrieving a json array from a cakePHP controller
@CONTENT:I want to return a JSON array from a cakePHP controller. I effectively have a jquery click event which should send either a post, ajax or get call to the controller (specified with URL) and that controller should just return the array. This makes sense to me because I will not create a view file, I literally send the response to the controller and I can set the header, echo the json array and possibly just exit. My output only says "Array" on console, and does not echo out any parameters in the array. Any ideas? // jQuery code:
$("selector").click(function() {
      $.post("/controller/view/param1/param2/",function(data) {
         console.log(data);
      } 
}

// code in my controller:
public function view($param1 = false, $param2 = false) {
       $array = array("Name" => "John");
       header("Content-type: application/json");
       echo $array;
      exit;
}
 EDIT: Found the solution - the echo $array must be echo json_encode($array)
@CODE:// jQuery code:
$("selector").click(function() {
      $.post("/controller/view/param1/param2/",function(data) {
         console.log(data);
      } 
}

 This makes the opening and closing brackets optional. But as you can see they are independently optional. Is there a way with regexes to require either both opening and closing brackets, or neither?

@TITLE:Shared memory - need for synchronization
@CONTENT:I've seen a project where communication between processes was made using shared memory (e.g. using ::CreateFileMapping under Windows) and every time one of the processes wanted to notify that some data is available in shared memory, a synchronization mechanism using named events notified the interested party that the content of the shared memory changed. I am concerned on the fact that the appropriate memory fences are not present for the process that reads the new information to know that it has to invalidate it's copy of the data and read it from main memory once it is "published" by the producer process. Do you know how can this be accomplished on Windows using shared memory? EDIT Just wanted to add that after creating the file mapping the processes uses MapViewOfFile() API only once and every new modification to the shared data uses the pointer obtained by the initial call to MapViewOfFile() to read the new data sent over the shared memory. Does correct synchronization require that every time data changes in shared memory the process that reads data must create MapViewOfFile() every time ?

@CONTENT:Let's say I have two tables of books and two tables of their corresponding editions. I have a query as follows: SELECT TOP 10 * FROM
(SELECT hbID, hbTitle, hbPublisherID, hbPublishDate, hbedID, hbedDate
 FROM hardback
 LEFT JOIN hardbackEdition on hbID = hbedID

 Left JOIN paperbackEdition on pbID = pbedID
) books
WHERE hbPublisherID = 7
ORDER BY hbPublishDate DESC
 If there are 5 editions of the first two hardback and/or paperback books, this query only returns two books. However, I want the TOP 10 to apply only to the number of actual book records returned. Is there a way I can select 10 actual books, and still get all of their associated edition records? In case it's relevant, I do not have database permissions to CREATE and DROP temporary tables. Thanks for reading! Update To clarify: The paperback table has an associated table of paperback editions. The hardback table has an associated table of hardback editions. The hardback and paperback tables are not related to each other except to the user who will (hopefully!) see them displayed together.

@TITLE:403 Forbidden when Deploying asp.net 4.0 MVC 3 site to IIS 7
@CONTENT:So I have an EC2 instance running, the URL NoWeatherSurprises.com I have the DNS pointing there, and I set up a new site in IIS 7 and pointed it to a folder. I used Visual Studios Web Developer 2010 express to publish to this folder. It now has the binaries and such. However if I go to NoWeatherSurprises.com I get the welcome to IIS 7 screen. I'd expect to go to my application If I navigate to http://noweathersurprises.com/weather/ [weather was the folder I published to under wwwroot] I get a 403 forbidden. I have no idea why, I am guessing that it is trying to do a directory listing or something instead of launching my MVC Application. So 2 problems in summary. It is not pointing the domain to the folder directly and I need to add /weather I am getting a 403 forbidden instead of the results of my home controller with the index action. I am new to IIS 7, I had been using IIS 6 and had a lot less trouble setting it up, but I suspect that's my own fault and i am just missing something. Thanks in advance for any help

@TITLE:How to join/merge xml files into a single file and return it?
@CONTENT:I'm using the Last.fm API and I'm trying to get a lot of info about a certain user and returning it in xml. So, here's the call in my view: <%= form_tag fetch_user_path, :remote => true, :'data-type' => 'xml', :id => 'search' do %>
  <%= text_field_tag :q %>
<% end %>
 So, as you can see, it's expecting XML, and I'm correctly handling the callback using jQuery. Then, in my controller: # fetch_controller.rb
def user
  username = params[:q].gsub(' ','+')
  get_info_url = "http://ws.audioscrobbler.com/2.0/?method=user.getinfo&user=#{username}&api_key=#{API_KEY}"
  get_friends_url = "http://ws.audioscrobbler.com/2.0/?method=user.getfriends&user=#{username}&api_key=#{API_KEY}"

  respond_to do |format|
    format.xml {
      begin
        @info = Nokogiri::XML(open(get_info_url))
        @friends = Nokogiri::XML(open(get_friends_url))
      rescue Exception => e
        if e.message == '400 Bad Request'
          render xml: { :error => 'User not found.' }, :status => 400
        else
          render xml: { :error => 'Connection to Last.fm failed.' }, :status => 500
        end
      else
        # Here, I want to render @info + @friends!
        render xml: @info
      end
    }
end
 This way, I'm correctly returning the xml returned by get_info_url. However, I want to join that xml to the xml returned by get_friends_url. How would I go about that? Following Ben Miller's answer, I'm getting a parserror on my callback. I think it's got to to do with both xml files containing xml version. And maybe the combined file does not? I'm seeing that the xml files are being concatenated, here's how they look using console.log: Error: Invalid XML: <?xml version="1.0"?>

@TITLE:Android: passing data back and forth using intent setResults
@CONTENT:I am creating a GPS based app for Android and there are 2 activities Main and LocNames. Main shows my map and LocNames is to get source and destination that user wants. I want to start LocNames when user selected it from menu, user enters names in boxes and I want result to be send back to Main. But I am getting exceptions in doing so. Here is how my Main calls LocNames:     public boolean onOptionsItemSelected(MenuItem item) 
{
    switch (item.getItemId()) 
    {
        case R.id.showMyLocation:
            showCurrentLocation();
            break;
        case R.id.showRoute:
            Intent getLocationsIntent = new Intent(Main.this, LocNames.class);
            startActivityForResult(getLocationsIntent, 1);
            break;
    }
 Here is how I am trying to set results in onClick of LocNames: public void onClick(View v) 
{
    // TODO Auto-generated method stub
    source = sourceText.getText().toString();
    destination = destinationText.getText().toString();     
    Intent result = new Intent(LocNames.this, Main.class);
    result.putExtra("src", source);
    result.putExtra("dest", destination);
    setResult(RESULT_OK, result);
}
 But my application crashed when I try to use result returned by LocNames protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) 
{
 if(requestCode == 1 && resultCode == RESULT_OK)
    {
        source = data.getStringExtra("src");
        destination = data.getStringExtra("destination");           
    }
}
 I have no prior experience in using setResults but documentation says it takes an int and an intent as argument so I am creating intent for that but I get NullPointerException in OnClick of LocNames. Regards

@CONTENT:I would like to make this query in JPA: SELECT * FROM `happyDB`.`users` U WHERE U.party_as_user =1 AND U.party_party_id =2
 This is working fine, but my problem is that I have Party only as an object, not as an id and I can't make it work. In the Users-entity where I am trying to do the named query I have the following: @JoinColumn(name = "pary_party_id", referencedColumnName = "party_id")
@ManyToOne
private Party partyId;

@Column(name = "party_as_user")

 I tried to implement it like an object with dot notation, but that's not working: @NamedQuery(name = "Users.findByPartyAsUser", query = "SELECT u FROM Users u WHERE u.partyAsUser = :partyAsUser AND u.partyId.partyId = :partyId")
 There is a property called partyId inside the Party-object, but it's not working. Is there any solution for that or do I have to add one property to the Users-bean like private int partyID and populate it every time when a new Party is inserted into Users? Thanks for helping! Sami Nurmi

@CONTENT:I have this web application which I have made with MVC pattern, however I am trying to adapt the MVP pattern. I am using the GWTPlatform library which I have migrated some of the codes already, mainly to the Presenter and the View. However I have not seen any comprehensive material to explain how to actually deal with the Model part. In my MVC pattern I have the model in the controller (in MVC) and the Views listen to changes in the Model to update the views. The model is updated by the controller, e.g fireUpdateUser() function is fired as a result of opening the "user page" for example which then updates the model. How to I actually deal with the model in MVP if I already have remote services RPC (e.g UserService, UserServiceImpl); With Gwtplatform, I can just put a RPC call in the onReset() function of a presenter then essentially do a getView().getSomething().setValue(something) to update the View associated. In this case I did not have to use any model at all? Also, what are the purposes of EventHandler and Activities?
@CODE:Presenter View Model fireUpdateUser() getView().getSomething().setValue(something)

@LINK:/questions/10152002/building-ranking-with-genetic-algorithm
@TITLE:Building ranking with genetic algorithm,
@CONTENT:Question after BIG edition : I need to built a ranking using genetic algorithm, I have data like this : P(a>b)=0.9
P(b>c)=0.7
P(c>d)=0.8
P(b>d)=0.3
 now, lets interpret a,b,c,d as names of football teams, and P(x>y) is probability that x wins with y. We want to build ranking of teams, we lack some observations P(a>d),P(a>c) are missing due to lack of matches between a vs d and a vs c. Goal is to find ordering of team names, which the best describes current situation in that four team league. If we have only 4 teams than solution is straightforward, first we compute probabilities for all 4!=24 orderings of four teams, while ignoring missing values we have : P(abcd)=P(a>b)P(b>c)P(c>d)P(b>d) P(abdc)=P(a>b)P(b>c)(1-P(c>d))P(b>d) ... P(dcba)=(1-P(a>b))(1-P(b>c))(1-P(c>d))(1-P(b>d)) and we choose the ranking with highest probability. I don't want to use any other fitness function. My question : As numbers of permutations of n elements is n! calculation of probabilities for all orderings is impossible for large n (my n is about 40). I want to use genetic algorithm for that problem. Mutation operator is simple switching of places of two (or more) elements of ranking. But how to make crossover of two orderings ? Could P(abcd) be interpreted as cost function of path 'abcd' in assymetric TSP problem but cost of travelling from x to y is different than cost of travelling from y to x, P(x>y)=1-P(y<x) ? There are so many crossover operators for TSP problem, but I think I have to design my own crossover operator, because my problem is slightly different from TSP. Do you have any ideas for solution or frame for conceptual analysis ? The easiest way, on conceptual and implementation level, is to use crossover operator which make exchange of suborderings between two solutions : CrossOver(ABcD,AcDB) = AcBD for random subset of elements (in this case 'a,b,d' in capital letters) we copy and paste first subordering - sequence of elements 'a,b,d' to second ordering. Edition : asymetric TSP could be turned into symmetric TSP, but with forbidden suborderings, which make GA approach unsuitable.
@CODE:P(a>b)=0.9
P(b>c)=0.7
P(c>d)=0.8
P(b>d)=0.3 a,b,c,d P(x>y) x y P(a>d) P(a>c) 4!=24 P(abcd)=P(a>b)P(b>c)P(c>d)P(b>d) P(abdc)=P(a>b)P(b>c)(1-P(c>d))P(b>d) P(dcba)=(1-P(a>b))(1-P(b>c))(1-P(c>d))(1-P(b>d)) n! P(abcd) P(x>y)=1-P(y<x) CrossOver(ABcD,AcDB) = AcBD b,c,d,a f(b,c,d,a) = p(b>c) * p(c>d) * p(d>a) p(d>a) a>b, 0.9 b>c, 0.7 f(abc)=p(a>b)*p(b>c) f(acb)=p(a>b)*(1-p(b>c)) p(a>c) a c p(a>b) p(c>b) p(a>c) a b c b a c

@TITLE:How can I set the SVN password with Emacs 23.1 built-in integration?
@CONTENT:I am doing a project on CentOS 6.2 with the distribution supplied Emacs 23.1.1 and subversion using svnserver. I cannot find anywhere how to set the password for repository access. [There is another question here about this (SVN for Emacs: how do you set author name and save password?) but no usable answer for my circumstances.] BACKGROUND: Due to client delivery requirements I need to add as little extra to the installation as possible - using yum install wherever possible, finding non-yum RPMs if necessary, and manually installing as a last resort.

Once I do that it appears that at the start of the transition it sets the size down to the original zoom size before transitioning to the correct outcome size. The result is that I see the font-size flick smaller for a split second before growing larger. With the default zoom the transition looks smooth. Other browsers don't seem to have this issue.

@TITLE:Finding objects which contains at least one element from subset using RavenDB and LINQ
@CONTENT:I have simple type Question: public class Question
{
    public Question(string id)
    {
        Id = id;
        Tags = new List<string>();
    }

    public string Id { get; private set; }
    public IList<string> Tags { get; set; }            
}
 I have defined sample collection of such questions: var q1 = new Question("q1") { Tags = new List<string>() {"a"} };
var q2 = new Question("q2") { Tags = new List<string>() {"b"} };
var q3 = new Question("q3") { Tags = new List<string>() {"a", "b", "c"} };
var q4 = new Question("q4") { Tags = new List<string>() {"a", "b"} };
var q5 = new Question("q5") { Tags = new List<string>() {"z"} };
var q6 = new Question("q6");
var questions = new List<Question>() {q1, q2, q3, q4, q5, q6};
 Now I need to find all questions, which contains at least one tag, from given subset. Subset is defined below: string[] tags = new[] {"a", "b"};
 I expect q1, q2, q3 and q4 to be returned. The query which I use to get desired result is: var questions = DocumentSession.Query<Question>().AsQueryable();
questions = GetQuestionsToContainingAtLeastOneTagFromSubset(questions, tags)
// some other query restrictions
var result = questions.ToList(); // (**)
 The function which suppose to impose restrictions on my collection is following: private IQueryable<Question> GetQuestionsToContainingAtLeastOneTagFromSubset(IQueryable<Question> questions, IEnumerable<string> tags)
{
    var result = new List<Question>();
    foreach (var tag in tags)
    {
        var currentTag = tag;
        var resultForTag = questions.Where(x => x.Tags.Any(xTag => xTag == currentTag));
        result = result.Concat(resultForTag).ToList();
     }
     return result.GroupBy(x => x.Id).Select(grp => grp.First()).AsQueryable();
}
 I think this is highly inefficient. I'd like to avoid using .ToList() inside the provided function. As I understand this .ToList() expressions queries the RavenDB and returns me partial results (BTW: am I right ?). This is not efficient. I only want to impose restrictions in the provided function, and execute the query after all of the restrictions are imposed. The (**) place is good for me to sent the batch to RavenDB retrieve query result. How to improve that ?

@TITLE:Design pattern for mouse interaction
@CONTENT:I need some opinions on what is the "ideal" design pattern for a general mouse interaction. Here the simplified problem. I have a small 3d program (QT and openGL) and I use the mouse for interaction. Every interaction is normally not only a single function call, it is mostly performed by up to 3 function calls (initiate, perform, finalize). For example, camera rotation: here the initial function call will deliver the current first mouse position, whereas the performing function calls will update the camera etc. However, for only a couple of interactions, hardcoding these (inside MousePressEvent, MouseReleaseEvent MouseMoveEvent or MouseWheelEvent etc) is not a big deal, but if I think about a more advanced program (e.g 20 or more interactions) then a proper design is needed. Therefore, how would you design such a interactions inside QT. I hope I made my problem clear enough, otherwise don't bother complain :-) Thanks

 I do have a question though, should I create a second table to maintain the Parent-Child relationships like in this article, or will it be fine if I just used a self-referencing table. Going with the former seems to require a bit more maintenance and probably a little more complex queries. Is it worth it? I'm not sure what problems the article is addressing.

I have multiple java(Eclipse) projects but I am adding these projects to just one component within a single stream. These projects are packaged into one deployment file. Should each java project be added to its own component within the stream, so the stream will contain multiple components - one component for each java project. Are there advantages/disadvantages to using one method over the other ?

@TITLE:If I could extend Java enums I would do X [closed]
@CONTENT:I have a class that is intended to be used for a future internal authentication library ( I know there are already such existing libs ). So to make things as simple as possible to the developers using it in many coming future projects to make use of this library I had in mind them defining an enum with roles, simple example, the role sysadmin: // Not a project specific class, but Auth is intended to be part of the library
class Auth {

        public static enum AUTH_ROLE {
            sysadmin( new Rule(AdminController.class, "*") );

            private String name;

            AUTH_ROLE() {
                name = this.name();
                Roles.add( name );
            }
            AUTH_ROLE(String name) {
                this.name = name;
                Roles.add( name );
            }

            AUTH_ROLE(Rule rule) {
                name = this.name();
                Roles.add( name, rule );
            }
            AUTH_ROLE(String name, Rule rule) {
                this.name = name;
                Roles.add( name, rule );
            }
            public String getName() {
                return name;
            }
        }

        public boolean hasRole(AUTH_ROLE role) {

            String[] usersRoles = getLoggedInUsersRoles();

            for ( String userRole : usersRoles ) {
                if ( role.getName().equals(userRole) )
                    return true;
            }

            return false;
        }

    }
 Now, as you can see, the enum AUTH_ROLE is currently *defined* in what is supposed to be a non project specific class, but the Auth class is supposed to be part of the library that is to be used by many projects. The problem is that with the current design, I am forced to also define the roles and their rules in that same class, Auth, in order to define the method hasRole ( AUTH_ROLE ...) ... What I would like to do, is to have this enum with all the current logic in it defined ONCE for ALL PROJECTS and allow for the developers in new projects to be able to simply just define the roles and their rules. The problem I believe exists, is that you cannot extend an enum in Java, so all that in the enum logic ( although simple, not the point! ) actually has to be repeated for each new project and possibly implement and interface provided in the library. If it were possible to extend, then a new enum would have been able to simply define those roles, that is : public enum AUTH_ROLE extends authlibrary.Auth.AUTH_ROLE {
    sysadmin( new Rule(AdminController.class, "*") );
} 
 The other option, as I just mentioned, is to define an interface for the enum to implement, although as you can understand we end up with an implementation for each new project, be it as simple as copy and paste. I am not interested in converting stuff to string or number back and forth before calling the method and what not... This question is not so much about how you can circumvent *the limitations* of the language, but merely to agree/accept that his is a limitation that would otherwise have resulted in cleaner code. So, does anyone agree with that in this particular case, extending/including another enum would have been benefitial that would have resulted in less code? Ps. I might be an idiot, so I want to reserve the right call myself an idiot :)

Ideally, I would want to avoid having to create 30 separate Jenkins jobs, due to maintenance effort and risk of human error. This is what "multi-configuration project" in Jenkins was designed for, but unfortunately Jenkins doesn't support using the configuration matrix axis in the SVN URL. I also cannot build using parameterized build, because Jenkins will not allow the variables to be used in the local checkout paths (variables in URLs work fine, but they always end up going to a directory called ${BRANCH} (literal). At the end of the day, I would like to be able to check out https://domain.ext/something/${BRANCH}/ and save it to /some/path/${BRANCH}. Even better if this is done in a way that leaves me able to take advantage of Jenkin's built-in SCM features (e.g. polling). How can I make Jenkins understand what I'm trying to achieve?

@LINK:/questions/10120145/first-aggregate-function-which-i-can-use-with-having-clause
@TITLE:FIRST aggregate function which I can use with HAVING clause
@CONTENT:I have a weird requirement which I need to use inside my Stored Procedure in SQL Server 2008 R2. I need a FIRST aggregate function which returns the first element of a sequence and I will use that with HAVING clause. Let me give you an example: DECLARE @fooTable AS TABLE(
    ID INT,
    CategoryName NVARCHAR(100),
    Name NVARCHAR(100),
    MinAllow INT,
    Price DECIMAL(18,2)
);

INSERT INTO @fooTable  VALUES(1, 'Cat1', 'Product1', 2, 112.2);
INSERT INTO @fooTable  VALUES(2, 'Cat2', 'Product2', 4, 12.34);
INSERT INTO @fooTable  VALUES(3, 'Cat1', 'Product3', 5, 233.32);
INSERT INTO @fooTable  VALUES(4, 'Cat3', 'Product4', 4, 12.43);
INSERT INTO @fooTable  VALUES(5, 'Cat3', 'Product5', 1, 13.00);

DECLARE @minAllowParam AS INT = 3;

SELECT ft.CategoryName, SUM(ft.Price) FROM @fooTable ft
GROUP BY ft.CategoryName;
 As you see, we have a table and some dummy values. Inside the SELECT query, we group the categories together and sum the price of the products up. This query returns the following result: CategoryName     TotalPrice
---------------- ----------------
Cat1              345.52
Cat2              12.34
Cat3              25.43
 What I need here is something like this: SELECT ft.CategoryName, SUM(ft.Price) FROM @fooTable ft
GROUP BY ft.CategoryName
HAVING GetFIRST(MinAllow) >= @minAllowParam;
 In that our case with a query something like this, we should be able to select following results: INSERT INTO @fooTable  VALUES(2, 'Cat2', 'Product2', 4, 12.34);
INSERT INTO @fooTable  VALUES(4, 'Cat3', 'Product4', 4, 12.43);
INSERT INTO @fooTable  VALUES(5, 'Cat3', 'Product5', 1, 13.00);
 As the INSERT INTO @fooTable VALUES(1, 'Cat1', 'Product1', 2, 112.2); record is the first element of a sequence and has the value of 2 for MinAllow column, Cat1 should be out of scope here. On the other hand, INSERT INTO @fooTable VALUES(5, 'Cat3', 'Product5', 1, 13.00); record has the value of 1 for MinAllow column but is the second element of the sequence. So, Cat3 is safe and can be selected. Note: MIN or MAX is not what I am looking for! I know that this example logically does not make sense but I have a situation which it totally does and hard to explain here on the other hand. Any thoughts? Edit: I am assuming that I can achieve what I want here by creating a CLR User-Defined Aggregate Function but I do not want to do this if there is any other choice
@CODE:HAVING DECLARE @fooTable AS TABLE(
    ID INT,
    CategoryName NVARCHAR(100),

                }
            ]
        },
 How can I search for items and return only id 99993 based on the attribute "id" 1 with a value of 150 ? I've just started playing with MongoDB today so this is probably a very basic question. To add to the challenge, how can I group the results for every item of type 5 by the attributes/id/value, and get a result like:  "id" : 1, "value" : 150, "count" : 1
 "id" : 1, "value" : 120: "count" : 2
 This is just example data, the schema is pretty complex but for the purpose of this exercise it should be sufficient.

            "type" : 15,

@LINK:/questions/10115151/deserializing-json-string-into-an-object-silverlight
@TITLE:Deserializing json string into an object - Silverlight
@CONTENT:I've spent a good while this afternoon trying to implement the deserialization of JSON within a string, at first I was using DataContractJsonSerializer as my environment is Silverlight however it does not appear to support using a Dictionary out of the box (Raised in many other SO questions). As an alternative I decided to use JSON.NET for the time being (Based on the answers to the aforementioned SO questions) and i've hit the following problem. I want to deserialize the JSON below: {
    "disclaimer": "This data is collected from various providers and provided free of charge for informational purposes only, with no guarantee whatsoever of accuracy, validity, availability or fitness for any purpose; use at your own risk. Other than that - have fun, and please share/watch/fork if you think data like this should be free!",
    "license": "Data collected from various providers with public-facing APIs; copyright may apply; not for resale; no warranties given.",
    "timestamp": 1334183999,
    "base": "USD",
    "rates": {
                "AED": 3.6732,
                "AFN": 48.400002,
                "ALL": 106.669998,
             }
}
 and place it within the following object (the double within the dictionary is required): public class ExchangeData
{
    public string disclaimer { get; set; }
    public string license { get; set; }
    public string timestamp { get; set; }
    public string @base { get; set; }
    public Dictionary<string, double> rates { get; set; }
}
 My latest attempt at actually getting this to work is below: StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(args.Result);
ExchangeData data = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<ExchangeData>(reader.ReadToEnd());
 But this results in the following exception: Could not load type 'System.Dynamic.IDynamicMetaObjectProvider' from assembly 'System.Core, Version=3.7.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=969DB8053D3322AC'. Based on what you can see is my approach completely wrong or am I just making a schoolboy error (or both!) Thanks for your time!

@LINK:/questions/10114212/chrome-extension-to-replace-text-dom-nodes-doesnt
@TITLE:Chrome extension to replace text DOM nodesK doesn't
@CONTENT:Update: With guidance from "am no I am", I've solved this; working code at the end. I'm working on my first Chrome extension at the moment, which is intended to perform text replacement on viewed webpages. I've been going all over trying to get my head around DOM manipulation, and I've eventually come up with the following. In theory this should go through the whole DOM table, find text nodes, clone them, replace the text (where applicable), and replace the original node with the clone. Here's my manifest.json... {
    "name": "My app",
    "version": "1.0",
    "manifest_version": 2,
    "description": "Do thing.",
    "permissions": [
        "tabs", "http://*/"
    ],
    "content_scripts": [
        {
            "matches": ["http://*/*"],
            "js": ["myapp.js"],
            "run_at": "document_end"
        }
    ]
}
 And the myapp.js; function myapp() {
    var nodes = document.getElementsByTagName("*");
        for(var i = 0; i < nodes.length; i++) {
             if(nodes[i].type == "text") {
                  var parent = nodes[i].parentnode;
                  var newnode = nodes[i].cloneNode(true);
                  newnode.data.replace("test text","replacement test text");
                  parent.replaceChild(newnode, nodes[i]);
             };
        };
};
myapp();
 I have the extension imported and activated. Chrome's javascript console has shown errors with it previously, which implies it's running, but has none now, which implies no basic typo-style errors. I assume either I'm wrong about how to alter or swap the text nodes, or have a basic misunderstanding of how to set up the manifest file or the js file, but I've hit a wall trying to figure out which. Any help would be gratefully received! Update: Here's the working version. function myapp() {
    var nodes = document.getElementsByTagName("*");
    for(var i = 0; i < nodes.length; i++) {
         var subNodes = nodes[i].childNodes;
         for (var j = 0; j < subNodes.length; j++) {
            var node = subNodes[j];
            if (node.nodeType === 3) {
                if (node.data) {
                    node.data = node.data.replace(/test text/g,"replacement test text");
                }
            }
        }
    }
};
myapp();

I tried going through the Polymorphic Association RailsCasts http://railscasts.com/episodes/154-polymorphic-association?view=asciicast, but it seems dated. I have two questions: How do I rewrite my comment_form partial so that it would work for anything commentable? The way I have it right now, it would only work for traveldeals since (:commentable_id => @traveldeal.id). When I create the comment, the commentable_type is empty.

@TITLE:Culture specific DateTime string is inconsistent between platforms
@CONTENT:I have a test application that allows the user to select a culture from a ComboBox and displays the culture specific date in a multiline TextBox. The code is below: public partial class Form1 : Form
{
    public Form1()
    {
        InitializeComponent();
        comboBox1.Items.AddRange(
            CultureInfo.GetCultures(CultureTypes.SpecificCultures));
    }

    private void comboBox1_SelectedValueChanged(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        CultureInfo selectedCulture = comboBox1.SelectedItem as CultureInfo;
        DateTime currentDate = DateTime.Now;

        textBox1.Text =
            "My Date : " + currentDate.ToString() + Environment.NewLine +
            "Culture Specific Date: " + currentDate.ToString(selectedCulture);
    }
}
 I notice that if "ar-SA", Arabic (Saudi Arabia), is selected, then I see different results when I run the application on different machines. On a Windows 7 machine, the text box displays: 
My Date : 4/11/2012 4:07:09 PM
Culture Specific Date: 19/05/33 04:07:09 ?
 On a Windows XP machine, the text box displays: 
My Date : 4/11/2012 4:07:09 PM
Culture Specific Date: 20/05/33 04:07:09 ?
 As you can see, the culture specific date is off by a day. What could be causing this discrepancy?

@TITLE:How to choose the test DB cakePHP testing
@CONTENT:I am using the cake bake command to create my fixture and Test models. I have done it successfully with one of my models but i am having troubles with another one. I dont know why, it tries to work with the default DB instead with the test one that i have already defined and that is the one used by the first model i tested. Both Test models, the one which works well and this 2nd one which doesn't, have been created with cake bake and they look exactly the same. Both of them have this in their fixture class: public $import = array('records' => true, 'connection' => 'test');
 Test defines the connection to my test database. What can be the problem? I have experiment something weird. In my test model if i use the singluar instead of the plural, it works with the default DB BUT if i change it to plural it works with the test DataBase. (but it can not call any method from the model, just defined methods such as find()). For example: public function setUp() {
    parent::setUp();

    //uses the default DB (i dont know why)
    $this->Post = ClassRegistry::init('Post');          
    print_r($this->User->find('all'));

    $this->Post->updatePostsStatus(1); //works well

    //uses the default Test Database (i dont know why either)
    $this->Post = ClassRegistry::init('Posts');         
    print_r($this->User->find('all'));   

    $this->Post->updatePostsStatus(1); //doesn't work. No function found.
    /*SQLSTATE[42000]: Syntax error or access violation: 1064 You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'updatePostsStatus' at line 1*/

}
 Thanks. I HAVE UPDATED IT. LAST UPDATE AND SOLUTION The problem was the bad initialization of the Post Model constructor. Using the plural was not relevant. It is like using any non existent model. It will always get the test database. The answer for the good initialization of the constructor is here: How to overriding a constructor correctly at CakePHP 2.0
@CODE:public $import = array('records' => true, 'connection' => 'test'); public function setUp() {

    $this->Post = ClassRegistry::init('Post');

@TITLE:GetActiveObject() vs. GetObject() X MK_E_UNAVAILABLE Error
@CONTENT:All: I am having some problems translating some VBA code to C#. We have a 3rd party app which acts as a local COM server. In the VBA code we use GetObject() to get a reference to the existing object e.g. Set appHandle = GetObject("", ProgId)
 this works fine. I added a reference to the 3rd party app in our c# code, and used Marshal.GetActiveObject() to try and get a reference to a running instance. e.g. var appModel = (IAppCoModel)Marshal.GetActiveObject(ProgId);
 but I keep getting a MK_E_UNAVAILABLE error. Creating a new object works fine in the C# code e.g. var appModel = new AppCoModel()
 this launches the 3rd party app and allows me to communicate with it. It is only grabbing a reference to a running instance that fails. What I've tried Different security contexts VS is running in admin mode, the 3rd party app isn't. I tried running our c# app from the command line (non-admin). Still failing. Check the ROT contents (suggested by Marshal.GetActiveObject() throws MK_E_UNAVAILABLE exception in C#) The 3rd party app doesn't appear in it. Don't know enough COM to be sure that it needs to. Checked all the Registry entries Look good (as far as I can see) and they are good enough to create and instance of the 3rd party app and for the VBA to find it. Anything specific that I should check here? Any suggestions that people can make would be appreciated.

@TITLE:Selecting programmatically a cell on a tableview doesn't perform associated segue
@CONTENT:Well, as I say in the subject, my problem is that I'm selecting programmatically a cell on a tableview with the intention of perform, automatically, the associated segue. I have the code to do this on the viewWillAppear of the associated tableviewcontroller. The result is that the cell is selected, but the segue is not performed. Do you know why? By the moment I'm performing the segue programmatically on the viewWillAppear to solve the problem, but I'm curious about why the segue is not automatically performed if the cell is selected... By the way. The segue must be ok because when I select the cell tapping it works properly. More info: i'm working on a splitviewcontroller. Left side has the tableviewcontroller and the segue presents a viewcontroller on the right side Thanks a lot! Carlos Related code: - (void) viewWillAppear:(BOOL)animated

  , ' ', $data->Description);
 The problem here is that I'am not quite sure that this is valid RegEx, because I receive Internal Server Error because of enabled mod security in our apache. I've tried to save my file in UTF-8 with BOM, but that was desperate trying I've tried to use iconv with 'UTF-8//IGNORE' but and this didn't help I've tried to use character by character replacement, but this didn't work well with my file because i have 230k lines.. even if i replace the specific tag in which i have that problem i've trigger max_execution_time directive in php and my script is killed. For now my solution is to clear database records of this invalid characters manually, but this is now proper and correct solution to my problem because in future this script will be used to automate this export and manual editing isn't option or subject of speech.

 Let's further assume that i selected some of them in an array of DOM elements: var allElements = jQuery('div,p').get();
// result: [div#content, div#sidebar, div#main, p.foo, p.bar]
 Now i want to efficiently remove all elements from the result set which have a child in the result. In other words, only the deepest level should remain. So, the desired result would be: var deepestElements = doSomethingWith(allElements);
// desired result: [div#sidebar, p.foo, p.bar]
 How can i do this? By the way: "Deepest elements" seems to be the wrong term for what i am trying to do. Is there any better name?

@TITLE:Why does this JS-created SVG <animate> not work in Chrome?
@CONTENT:Consider this simple SVG SMIL animation: <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="-50 -50 100 100">
  <circle r="40" fill="red">
    <animate
      attributeType="CSS" begin="click"
      attributeName="fill" to="blue" dur="0.3s" fill="freeze"/>
  </circle>
</svg>
 This works correctly in Chrome v18 on Windows (modulo a bug with holding the color): http://phrogz.net/svg/change-color-on-click-simple.svg When I generate the <animate> element using JavaScript, all works well in Firefox, Safari, and Opera, but not Chrome. In Chrome, nothing happens when I click on the circle. <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="-50 -50 100 100">
  <circle r="40" fill="red"/>
  <script>
    var c = document.querySelector('circle');
    createOn(c,'animate',{
      attributeType:'CSS', begin:'click',
      attributeName:'fill', to:'blue',
      dur:'0.3s', fill:'freeze'
    });
    function createOn(el,name,attrs){
      var e = el.appendChild(document.createElementNS(el.namespaceURI,name));
      for (var name in attrs) e.setAttribute(name,attrs[name]);
      return e;
    }
  </script>
 See this JavaScript version here: http://phrogz.net/svg/change-color-on-click-simple-js.svg There are no script errors in the console. The content of the first example was actually generated by choosing Copy As HTML from the Chrome Developer Tools after loading the second example, so I know that it is producing the correct attribute names and values. The namespaceURI of the <animate> element is the same between both (the SVG namespace), as is the namespaceURI of all attributes (null). Is there a way to get JS-generated <animate> elements to work in Chrome?
@CODE:<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="-50 -50 100 100">

As loading the plugin loads Clojure's classes through a custom classloader, and throwing away the (AOT-compiled) object instance which acts as the plugin's entry point does not discard the vars placed by Clojure in thread-local space, a classloader leak results with PermGen space being eventually exhausted by multiple instances of the Clojure interpreter. How can this be resolved? I can make reasonable non-Clojure-specific changes to BaseX's module load/unload mechanism if necessary.

@TITLE:Listbox horizontal scrollbar not updating properly
@CONTENT:I have a form which contains a listbox control with many other controls which determine the listbox contents. Adding items to the listbox correctly sets the scrollbar's range, but updating items on the listbox (via this.lstResources.Items[index] = myUri) causes the scrollbar's range to decrease past the largest item's width, cutting off the last few characters. The scrollbar still works, but updating the listbox in this fashion causes an unexpected, and unacceptable, scroll range for the item(s) in the list. Here is how I am implementing my listbox: public System.Windows.Forms.ListBox lstResources;
this.lstResources = new System.Windows.Forms.ListBox();

this.lstResources.FormattingEnabled = true;
this.lstResources.HorizontalScrollbar = true;
this.lstResources.Location = new System.Drawing.Point(331, 122);
this.lstResources.Name = "lstResources";
this.lstResources.Size = new System.Drawing.Size(307, 316);
this.lstResources.TabIndex = 8;
this.lstResources.Click += new System.EventHandler(this.ResourcesPage.LstResources_Click);
 The altering operations that I perform on this listbox are as follows: this.parentClassReference.lstResources.Items.Add(myUri);
this.parentClassReference.lstResources.Items[index] = myUri;
this.parentClassReference.lstResources.Items.RemoveAt(index);
 I have tried Refresh() and Update() on both the form and the listbox control, but neither have any effect. I've looked all over for listbox scrollbar issues, but none seem to have this peculiar redrawing issue. This is what it should look like: This is what is actually happening: I have a feeling I'm missing something obvious or perhaps changing the items incorrectly, but I'm fresh out of ideas for this one. I'm not entirely new to C# and UI design, but I can't say I know all the nitty gritty control operations either. Any assistance would be much appreciated. EDIT 1: This is a sample form which should reproduce the problem. I'm starting to have a suspicion that StringBuilder might have something to do with the update part, but it is also used in the btnAdd_Click code as well... public partial class SampleListBoxForm : Form
{
    public Dictionary<string, string> CurrentUriQuery { get; set; }

 i have 3 questions: 1: why when i add the second book and then i print all the book i see is the same book for exemple in this input the output will be 2012-04-10 15:26:45.476 MyBookstore[43574:403]       Title: gingi

 EDIT #1 After some inspection, here's more detail: Launching is a 2-Step-Process, the Launcher launches an intermediate window using Process.WaitForExit() From the intermediate window, further processes can be started in the same way (Process.WaitForExit). With only the intermediate window open and no user interaction, the launcher process's number of handles increases over time. The maximum increase we've seen here is 400 --> 6000 handles. The facts added in the Edit really make me wonder whether there might be a handle leak in the framework somewhere. I'm trying to isolate the problem and check whether I can reproduce it from scratch. In the meantime, any kind of hint, idea, support or even chocolate is gladly accepted! EDIT #2 : In an attempt to make the process responsive to PostMessage(), we removed the Thread.WaitForExit. Instead, we added a Handler for the Process's Exited event and sent the Launcher into a loop like the following:        while (foo == true)
        {
            System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(1000);
        }
 The Exited-Handler sets foo to false and does nothing else. Still, the number of Handles rises (400 to 800 in half an hour). EDIT #3 Here comes something interesting, at last.        while (foo == true)
        {
            System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(1000);
            GC.Collect();
        }
 This keeps it the way it's supposed to be, few handles, all nifty. Now that makes me wonder what's wrong here...I'll talk to the developer in charge again to check back what else the launcher does. So far, I've heard that it reads a few config values using XmlDocument.Load(), which is not an IDisposable - makes it kind of hard to produce any leakage here...

This application should be running on Android and iPhone, so the algorithm should be efficient. For my customer it is perfectly fine if we deliver some patterns along with the software that are attached to the objects to be tracked to have a well-recognizable target. This means that I can make up a pattern on my own. As I am not that much into image processing yet, I don't know which objects are easiest to recognize in a picture even if they are rather small. Color is also possible, although processing several planes separately is not desired because of the generated overhead. Thank you for any advice!! Best, guitarflow

@TITLE:MySQL error on CREATE TABLE for many-to-many relationship
@CONTENT:I have an issue with a simple CREATE TABLE query. I have two tables" 'resort' (with resortID and resortName) and 'season' (with resortID and resortName) in a many to many relationship. I am trying to create the joining table resort_season with either of the two queries below: CREATE TABLE resort_season (
resortID MEDIUMINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
seasonID MEDIUMINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
FOREIGN KEY (resortID) REFERENCES resort (resortID),
FOREIGN KEY (seasonID) REFERENCES season (seasonID),
PRIMARY KEY (resortID, seasonID) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE resort_season (
resortID MEDIUMINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES resort (resortID),
seasonID MEDIUMINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES season (seasonID),
PRIMARY KEY (resortID, seasonID) NOT NULL
);
 Both queries give me an error that reads (in the case of the second query in this case): "You have an error in your syntax; check manual....for right syntax to use near'FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES resort (resortID), seasonID MEDIUMINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL F' at line 2". What am I doing wrong? This is giving me a headache because I just can not see why the error. If I do simply CREATE TABLE resort_season (
resortID MEDIUMINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
seasonID MEDIUMINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
PRIMARY KEY (resortID, seasonID) NOT NULL
);
 then it works fine and the table is created. I am not sure though if this table will validly reference the tables resort and season.
@CODE:CREATE TABLE resort_season (
resortID MEDIUMINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
seasonID MEDIUMINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
FOREIGN KEY (resortID) REFERENCES resort (resortID),

@TITLE:Is Oracle's CURRENT_TIMESTAMP function really a function?
@CONTENT:I was under the impression that argument-less functions can be called with empty parentheses after the function name, i.e. what some other databases allow to do: current_timestamp()
 Whereas in Oracle, I have to write current_timestamp
 With user-defined functions, this rule doesn't apply (in 11g). I can write both my_function
my_function()
 My question is: Is CURRENT_TIMESTAMP really a true function or should I consider it to be a language construct / pseudo-column of the Oracle SQL dialect (compatible with the SQL standard)? Is there any formal definition about when I can (optionally, mandatorily) add the () and when I have to omit them? Background-info: SQL 1992 defines: <current timestamp value function> ::=
  CURRENT_TIMESTAMP [ <left paren> <timestamp precision> <right paren> ]
 Derby, HSQLDB, Ingres, Postgres, SQLite, SQL Server behave like Oracle, where there are no parentheses allowed for CURRENT_TIMESTAMP Sybase SQL Anywhere knows a CURRENT TIMESTAMP function (without parentheses, without underscore) CUBRID, MySQL, Sybase ASE allow for using CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()

@TITLE:Close a form from an external thread using the Invoke method
@CONTENT:I have to close a Form from a thread and I am using the Invoke method of the Form for calling the Close() method. The problem is that when closing, the form is disposed and I get an InvalidOperationExecption wit the message "Invoke or BeginInvoke cannot be called on a control until the window handle has been created.". I have got this exception only when debugging with a "Step Into" in the Close method but I don't want to risk with a possible error on normal running. This is an example code to reproduce it:  private void Form1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
 {
     Thread thread = new Thread(CloseForm);
     thread.Start();
 }

 private void CloseForm()
 {
     this.Invoke(new EventHandler(
         delegate
         {
             Close(); // Entering with a "Step Into" here it crashes.
         } 
     ));
 }
 The form is disposed in the automatic generated code for the form (which I would like not to modify):     protected override void Dispose(bool disposing)
    {
        if (disposing && (components != null))
        {
            components.Dispose();

    }
 I would appreciate it if someone could give me a solution for this or another way to close a form from another thread.
@CODE:private void Form1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)

     Thread thread = new Thread(CloseForm);
     thread.Start();

 The ".java" file which are unmapped were also not generated. The whole "/src-gen/...../foobar/foo" folder is missing. I guess this is the reason and what should be fixed. I really don't know, where the problem is. I already had a discussion in an eclipse forum http://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/m/839974/#msg_839974 there you can find the build.xml but for another project, also an Activator class to activate the plugin and do the copy stuff and execute the ant script, also you find the mwe2 file i use. its similar to this example I hope somebody here has an idea.

@TITLE:play recorded sound during voice call using NDK or Third Party APIs
@CONTENT:I have explored a lot to find out how to play a pre-recorded audio during voice call in android , but everywhere i noticed that its impossible with the currently supported APIs and there isn't any work around too. so what i want to know is does anyone know how to do it using NDK or any other external APIs ? i tried to even re-communicate with members who had asked the question , but most of them were seen 1 year back , so i got to ask it again. my main point is , if anyone has explored how to implement this using NDK then please do share the road map to do the same ? UPDATE I tried playing a recorded file on a speaker phone at the time when other person picks up a call but the audio file play at my end only not on the other person's end even though i have played on my speaker phone. so this solution doesnt work.

 I thought I had a fast way to convert Unique Identifier values to a Big Int, and back. But there is a problem in my second convert. Can anyone comment on the right way to fully convert a GUID to a number and back? I am only getting part of the GUID and not the whole thing when I try to convert it back from the numeric representation to its original GUID. I want to pass an integer (I think it would be classified as a "Large BigInt" in MSSQL?) to a remote system and just use characters 0-9, and still get the random uniqueness of NewId(). Thanks.

@LINK:/questions/10077937/using-atomicinteger-as-a-static-shared-counter
@TITLE:Using AtomicInteger as a static shared counter
@CONTENT:In an effort to learn about synchronization via Java, I'm just messing around with some simple things like creating a counter shared between threads. The problem I've run into is that I can't figure out how to print the counter sequentially 100% of the time. int counterValue = this.counter.incrementAndGet();
System.out.println(this.threadName + ": " + counterValue);
 The above increments the AtomicInteger counter, gets the new value, and prints it to the console identified by the thread name that is responsible for that update. The problem occurs when it appears that the incrementAndGet() method is causing the JVM to context switch to another thread for its updates before printing the current thread's updated value. This means that the value gets incremented but not printed until the thread returns to the executing state. This is obvious when looking at this example output: Thread 3: 4034

Thread 2: 3863
Thread 1: 4041
Thread 1: 4043
 You can see that when execution returns to Thread 1, it prints its value and continues updating. The same is evident with Thread 2. I have a feeling that I'm missing something very obvious.

@TITLE:C++ program works on XP SP2 only after installing Visual Studio
@CONTENT:I have a C++ program. It's quite simple - shows an image (splash screen) and launches another application, then closes when that other application is started. Actually, this one: http://www.olsonsoft.com/blogs/stefanolson/post/A-better-WPF-splash-screen.aspx with very minor changes (my splash screen image and my program is launched instead of the sample one). It works good on my Windows 7 developer machine. Also it works on another (virtual) machine with Windows XP SP2 and Visual Studio 2008 installed. But it doesn't work on just the same virtual Windows XP SP2 machine without Visual Studio. It shows an error: "Entry point memmove_s could not be located in the dynamic link library msvcrt.dll". I have found that a problem possible is in WindowsCodec DLL (no such DLL in clear XP SP2 installation, but it is in Windows/system32 folder of XP SP2 with Visual Studio) so I copied it to the application folder on the clear system. After that the program partially works (launches another application after start) but didn't show the splash screen image. Installation of Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package (both 2008 and 2010) didn't help. I've found a recommendation to use static linking in Visual Studio (Multi Threaded (/MT) option in project properties -> C/C++ -> Code Generation), but it also didn't help. Also I have tried DependencyWalker but cannot find any differences in dependencies for both test systems. Anyone have any ideas why this could happen? I'm completely new in C++, hope this is something obvious that I just don't know...

@CONTENT:I'm trying to understand on a deeper level if I'm missing something as to understanding when Java needs an initialization of a variable vs a simply declaration. In the following code, the variable 'row' doesn't need to be assigned a value to compile and run, however, the variable 'column' does. Note: This program does nothing of use - it's been trimmed to display only whats necessary for this question as to not waste peoples valuable time.

for (row=0; row<2; row++){
    for (column=0; column<2; column++){
    }
}
System.out.print("Col:" + column + " row:" + row);
 Why does row compile w/o initialization at the top, but Java thinks column "might not have been initialized."?

int column=0; //column does need initialization

@TITLE:Why is Process.MainWindowTitle always empty for all but one window?
@CONTENT:When accessing Process.MainWindowTitle as follows... Process[] processes = Process.GetProcessesByName( "iexplore" );
 ...and then loop over the resulting array, I always end up with the MainWindowTitle being empty for all but one item in the array. In my case I've got two Internet Explorer windows open, one with a single tab and one with two tabs in it. Running my code I always get the MainWindowTitle for the window and tab that I had last active - all the others remain empty. The strange thing is that the process ID in which the MainWindowTitle is filled is always the same - if I activate the other IE window or tab before running my code, the process ID is always the same:   if ( !processes.Any() )
  {
    MessageBox.Show( "TODO - No matching process found" );
    return;
  }

  if ( processes.Count() > 1 )
  {
    foreach ( Process currentProcess in processes )
    {
      // More than one matching process found
      checkedListBox1.Items.Add( currentProcess.Id + " - " + currentProcess.MainWindowTitle + " - " + currentProcess.ProcessName );
    }

    return;
  }
 Output could therefore be for the first run like: 4824 - - iexplore 3208 - - iexplore 4864 - Google - Windows Internet Explorer - iexplore Next run (with the other IE window selected beforehand): 4824 - - iexplore 3208 - - iexplore 4864 - id Software - Windows Internet Explorer - iexplore I've read about this post, but I didn't get any further with my problem (and it seems to go into a somewhat different direction anyway). Why do I always only get one non-empty MainWindowTitle?
@CODE:Process[] processes = Process.GetProcessesByName( "iexplore" ); MainWindowTitle if ( !processes.Any() )
  {
    MessageBox.Show( "TODO - No matching process found" );
    return;

@LINK:/questions/10062156/scope-of-evaluation-of-array-bound-of-static-data-member
@TITLE:Scope of evaluation of array bound of static data member
@CONTENT:I was going to file a bug against GCC, but then realized that if my interpretation of the Standard is correct, it's a core language defect, not a compiler bug. When a static data member of array type is defined outside class scope, identifiers in the array bound are looked up in class scope. 9.4.2 [class.static.data] says "The initializer expression in the definition of a static data member is in the scope of its class (3.3.7)," but doesn't say anything about the declarator itself. It seems that this is the only name lookup context within a declarator. 8.4.2 [dcl.array] doesn't mention the scope of the array bound, so by default the expression is evaluated in the enclosing scope, which is the namespace. class X {
  static int const size = some_complicated_metafunction<>::value;
  static int arr[ size ];
};

// "size" should be qualified as "X::size", which is an access violation.
int X::arr[ size ] = {};
 The problem is that if the array bound is not evaluated in class scope, there is no way to access private class members, and some_complicated_metafunction<> would have to be respecified. The array bound needs the same scope as the initializer, for essentially the same reason as the initializer. (Although not quite as strong, since constant expressions can always be recomputed, unlike the address of a private object.) Am I missing something or is a DR in order?
@CODE:class X {
  static int const size = some_complicated_metafunction<>::value;
  static int arr[ size ];
};

// "size" should be qualified as "X::size", which is an access violation.
int X::arr[ size ] = {}; some_complicated_metafunction<> size X::size X::size private X::size

@TITLE:Backbone.js - Using new() in Model defaults - circular reference
@CONTENT:Taking the following Model: MyModel= Backbone.Model.extend({
  defaults : {
    myNestedModel:undefined,
  },
  initialize: function() {
    this.set({myNestedModel: new MyNestedModel());
  }
});
 It has a single property named 'myNestedModel' which has the following definition: MyNestedModel= Backbone.Model.extend({
  defaults : {
    myModel:undefined,
  }
});
 It too has a single Property name 'myModel'. Now if I create an instance of MyModel: aModel = new MyModel(); The nested model will have been set in MyModel's initialize method. I then use JSON.stringify in a two step process: // Use Backbone.js framework to get an object that we can use JSON.stringfy on
var modelAsJson = aModel.toJSON();

// Now actually do stringify 
var modelAsJsonString = JSON.stringify(modelAsJson);
 This works fine and I get the JSON representation of MyModel and it's property of MyNestedModel. The problem occurs when I use defaults, for example: MyModel= Backbone.Model.extend({
      defaults : {
        new MyNestedModel(),
      }
    });
 This causes a problem with JSON.stringify since it doesn't support circular references. I assume the circular reference is being created because all instances of MyModel share the same instance of MyNestedModel. Whereas the initialize method creates a new nested model for each instance. Questions: Is my understanding of defaults:{} being the 'cause' of the problem correct? From a question I posted recently I got the impression I should be using defaults for all properties. If that is the case, how should I be using defaults in the scenario presented in this post/question? Can someone clarify the use of defaults:{} with regards to when the value applies, when it's overridden and whether instances share the same default 'instances'?
@CODE:MyModel= Backbone.Model.extend({
  defaults : {
    myNestedModel:undefined,
  },
  initialize: function() {
    this.set({myNestedModel: new MyNestedModel());
  }
}); MyNestedModel= Backbone.Model.extend({
  defaults : {
    myModel:undefined,
  }
}); // Use Backbone.js framework to get an object that we can use JSON.stringfy on
var modelAsJson = aModel.toJSON();

// Now actually do stringify 
var modelAsJsonString = JSON.stringify(modelAsJson); MyModel= Backbone.Model.extend({

@TITLE:How to get access to underlying POJO from GWT Editor class
@CONTENT:I have a HashMap inside my POJO that I am using the Editor framework in GWT to edit. While I have access to the standard member variables bound through thier getters/setters, I don't know how to access the values inside the HashMap. How do I get access to the underlying POJO that is being edited through my editor that is using the SimpleBeanEditorDriver? My POJO: @Entity(noClassnameStored=true)
public class ProfileConfig extends BaseEntity {
     @Indexed(unique=true)
     private String name;
     private boolean isDefault;
     private HashMap<ProfileID, ProfileInfo> profiles= new HashMap<ProfileID, ProfileInfo>();

     public ProfileInfo getProfile(ProfileID id) {
          return profiles.get(id);
     }

     public void setProfile(ProfileID id, ProfileInfo p) {
         profiles.put(id, p);
     }
 My Editor: public class ProfileConfigEditor extends Composite implements ManagedObjectEditor<ProfileConfig> {

     private static ProfileConfigEditorUiBinder uiBinder = GWT.create(ProfileConfigEditorUiBinder.class);
     interface ProfileConfigEditorUiBinder extends UiBinder<Widget, ProfileConfigEditor> {

@TITLE:Should a calendar by represented using a table? Why does Google Calendar only use a table for the columns?
@CONTENT:This is not another general 'tables versus div elements for general layout' type question, like the "why not use tables for layout" question. I'm working on a timetable/calendar project and I have always assumed that a calendar would be an example of when to use to a use a table. Although, after a quick look at Google Calendar's structure, it seems it consists of a table, containing a <td> for each column and within each column, an event is a <div> with definition list inside. Why is this beneficial? My own ideas: Tables may be more troublesome to style, nicely & compactly, when there are multiple varying length events beginning at the same time (beginning in the same <td>). Possibility of unwanted whitespace. Harder to update tables when user adds event after the page is loaded, e.g. with JavaScript (because the row/colspan of the table headers might have to change) If tables were used, the width of x-axis/top headers & cells, and the height of y-axis/left headers and cells, would be matched automatically. Could be tough to manage this without tables. Does any of this matter? Should tabular data always be stored in actual tables? The following is a simplified example of a Google Calendar column: <td> <!-- column -->
        <div> <!-- start event -->
            <dl>
                <dt>START TIME V END TIME </dt>
                <dd>EVENT TITLE</dd>
            </dl>
        </div> <!-- end event -->
</td> <!-- end column -->
 The following is a full example: <td class="tg-col"> <!-- column td -->
    <div id="tgCol0" class="tg-col-eventwrapper" style="height:1008px;margin-bottom:-1008px;"> <!-- column div -->
        <div class="tg-gutter">
            <div class="ca-evp130 chip " style="top:588px;left:-1px;width:100%;"> <!-- start event div -->
                <dl class="cbrd" style="height:35px;border-color:#9FC6E7;background-color:#E4EFF8;color:#777777;">
                    <dt style="background-color:;">START TIME V END TIME <i class="cic cic-dm  cic-rcr" title="Recurring event">&nbsp;</i></dt>
                    <dd><span class="evt-lk ca-elp130">EVENT TITLE</span></dd>
                    <div><!-- start masks -->
                        <div class="mask mask-top" style="border-color:#9FC6E7;background-color:#E4EFF8;">&nbsp;</div>
                        <div class="mask mask-bottom" style="border-color:#9FC6E7;background-color:#E4EFF8;">&nbsp;</div>
                        <div class="mask mask-left" style="height:38px;border-color:#9FC6E7;background-color:#E4EFF8;">&nbsp;</div>
                        <div class="mask mask-right" style="height:38px;border-color:#9FC6E7;background-color:#E4EFF8;">&nbsp;</div>
                    </div><!-- end masks -->
                    <div class="resizer"> <!-- start resizer -->
                        <div class="rszr-icon">&nbsp;</div>
                    </div> <!-- end resizer -->
                </dl>
            </div> <!-- end event div -->
        </div> 
    </div> <!-- end column td -->
    <div id="tgOver0" class="tg-col-overlaywrapper"></div> <!-- column overlay div -->
</td> <!-- end column td -->

I'm considering writing my own set of extensions, but it's a little daunting, partly because of the COM complexities for IE, but more generally because it seems like such extensions would break easily with browser updates, and since I want it to work across multiple browsers it seems like it could quickly become a maintenance nightmare.

The audio stream, shown by ffprobe is AAC, which is obviously not my intention. So I must be doing something wrong in adding the audio stream. Any idea how I can correct this? This is my code for adding an audio stream: void add_audio_stream()
{

    CodecID codec_id = CODEC_ID_PCM_S16LE;

    AVStream *p_ast = av_new_stream(fc, 1);

    if (!p_ast) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Could not alloc audio stream\n");
        exit(1);
    }

    ai = p_ast->index;

    AVCodecContext *pcc = p_ast->codec;
    avcodec_get_context_defaults2( pcc, AVMEDIA_TYPE_AUDIO );

    pcc->codec_type = AVMEDIA_TYPE_AUDIO;
    pcc->codec_id = codec_id;
    pcc->sample_fmt = AV_SAMPLE_FMT_S16;
    //pcc->bit_rate = 44100*16*2;
    pcc->bit_rate = 0;
    pcc->sample_rate = 44100;
    pcc->channels = 2;
    pcc->time_base = (AVRational){1, 44100};


    // some formats want stream headers to be separate
    if (fc->oformat->flags & AVFMT_GLOBALHEADER)
    {
        printf(" **** 1 ****\n");
        pcc->flags |= CODEC_FLAG_GLOBAL_HEADER;
    }
    else
        printf(" **** 2 ****\n");


    AVCodec *codec;

    /* find the audio encoder */
    codec = avcodec_find_encoder(pcc->codec_id);
    if (!codec) {
        fprintf(stderr, "codec not found\n");
        exit(1);
    }


    /* open it */
    if (avcodec_open(pcc, codec) < 0) 
    {
        fprintf(stderr, "could not open codec\n");
        exit(1);
    }
}

@TITLE:Adding and sorting a linked list in C
@CONTENT:In my assignment, I have to write a function that takes as arguments a pointer to a "LNode" structure and an integer argument. Then, I have to not only add that integer into the linked list, but also put place it so that the list is in proper ascending order. I've tried several various attempts at this, and this is my code as of posting. LNode*  AddItem(LNode  *headPtr, int  newItem)
{
    auto    LNode   *ptr = headPtr;

    ptr = malloc(sizeof(LNode));

    if (headPtr == NULL)
    {
        ptr->value = newItem;
        ptr->next = headPtr;
        return ptr;
    }
    else
    {

        while (headPtr->value > newItem || ptr->next != NULL)
        {
            printf("While\n"); // This is simply to let me know how many times the loop runs
            headPtr = headPtr->next;
        }
        ptr->value = newItem;
        ptr->next = headPtr;
        return ptr;
    }

}  // end of "AddItem"
 When I run it, and try to insert say a 5 and then a 3, the 5 gets inserted, but then the while loop runs once and I get a segmentation fault. Also I cannot change the arguments as it's part of a skeletal code for this project. Thanks to anyone who can help. If it helps this is what the structure looks like typedef struct  LNode
{
    int                 value;
    struct  LNode      *next;

} LNode;
@CODE:LNode*  AddItem(LNode  *headPtr, int  newItem)
{
    auto    LNode   *ptr = headPtr;

    ptr = malloc(sizeof(LNode));

    if (headPtr == NULL)
    {
        ptr->value = newItem;

        ptr->value = newItem;
        ptr->next = headPtr;
        return ptr;
    }

}  // end of "AddItem" typedef struct  LNode
{
    int                 value;
    struct  LNode      *next;

@LINK:/questions/10048403/option-izing-java-getters
@TITLE:Option-izing Java getters
@CONTENT:When working with Java from Scala, we have to account for null. HttpServletRequest getters (getAttribute, getHeader, etc.) for example, all potentially return null. I know I can manually do a case/match or map operation on each call to an HttpServletRequest method, but that's a bit tedious. Also, method calls like request.getHeader("Accept-Encoding") are a mouthful. I came up with an enrichment to handle both issues: class Servlet_Request_Provides_NullSafe_Getters (r: HttpServletRequest) {

  def header(s: String) = Option( r.getHeader(s) )
  def attrib(s: String) = Option( r.getAttribute(s) )
  def remoteHost        = Option( r.getRemoteHost )
  def accepts = header("Accept-Encoding")
}
implicit def request2Option(r: HttpServletRequest) = 
  new Servlet_Request_Provides_NullSafe_Getters(r)
 1) Is there another/better way than enrich-my-library to achieve the same/similar affect? 2) If this is "the" way to go, what are the performance impacts/risks? In other words, can one get burned by the apparent utility/conveniences of this pattern? Sorry if this stuff is obvious, only just started enriching the other day, and it really seems quite useful. Just want to make sure I'm applying the pattern in the proper scenarios... EDIT @dhg pointed out that Option.apply() and: def safe[T](v: T) = v match {
  case null => None
  case x => Some(x)
}
 are equivalent, so the getter methods now use Option(f()) instead of my extraneous safe(f()) wrapper Thanks
@CODE:class Servlet_Request_Provides_NullSafe_Getters (r: HttpServletRequest) {

  def header(s: String) = Option( r.getHeader(s) )
  def attrib(s: String) = Option( r.getAttribute(s) )
  def remoteHost        = Option( r.getRemoteHost )

@TITLE:SqlConnection and the Pool, is keeping an open connection kung-foo or foo-bar?
@CONTENT:I had thought I was clever. But in light of recent discoveries, I'm not so sure any more. During the page life cycle, there could by any number of database interactions. Some back to back, others spread out. So I invented an object that keeps an instance of an SQL connection alive in the HttpContext.Items dictionary. Every db request then uses this connection and when the http request has ended, I properly dispose of the connection. We're looking at a couple hundred milliseconds the connection would be open, and with some heavy http caching, running out of available connections isn't a concern. The point was to prevent additional round trips due to the establishing of new connections. But when I stumbled upon the knowledge of connection pooling, I think it pretty invalidates the usefulness of preserving the SqlConnection. Or does it? Is scenario A the same as Scenario B, performance wise? Which would you recommend? Does scenario B provide no performance gains, and even possibly hinders it because of some edge cases where the connection might not disposed of properly? Forgive the pseudo-ness in the examples, I don't want to clutter them with barf. A using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
   using (var command = new SqlCommand("...", connection))
   {
      ... doing database stuff ...

@TITLE:Synchronizing multiple OpenGL windows to vsync
@CONTENT:In a Windows application, I have multiple OpenGL windows open at the same time. Ideally I would like each of these to draw at 60 fps, synchronized to the screen refresh. For each render context, I'm calling wglSwapIntervalEXT(1) to turn on vsync. Each window has its own display thread, which draws the frame and then calls SwapBuffers to update. It turns out that the windows are 'fighting' each other: it looks like the SwapBuffers calls are synchronized and wait for each other, even though they are in separate threads. I'm measuring the frame-to-frame time of each window and with two windows, this drops to 30 fps, with three to 20 fps, etc. If I turn vsync off with wglSwapIntervalEXT(0), they happily refresh at 60 fps no matter how many windows I open. But with one window open, this is not nearly as smooth as with vsync turned on. Is there any way to accomplish what I want with OpenGL?

@LINK:/questions/10043327/using-single-versus-double-pointers-in-linked-lists-implemented-in-c
@TITLE:Using single versus double pointers in Linked lists implemented in C
@CONTENT:I was writing this code for adding element at the end of linked list: struct node{
    int info;
    struct node* link;
};

void append ( struct node **q, int num )  
{

struct node *temp, *r ;

if ( *q == NULL )       // if the list is empty, create first node
{
    temp = (struct node*) malloc ( sizeof ( struct node ) ) ;
    temp -> info = num ;
    temp -> link = NULL ;
    *q = temp ;        
}
else{
    temp = *q ;         

    /* go to last node */
    while ( temp -> link != NULL )
        temp = temp -> link ;

    /* add node at the end */
    r = (struct node *)malloc ( sizeof ( struct node ) ) ;
    r -> info = num ;
    r -> link = NULL ;
    temp -> link = r ;
}
}
 and I call append function like this: append(&list, 10); where list is the pointer to the linked list This code works, but if I use single pointer in append function(using *q instead of **q) and make changes accordingly (as done below and also when I call it), it doesn't work. What is wrong with the code below?: void append ( struct node *q, int num )  
{

struct node *temp, *r ;

if ( q == NULL )       // if the list is empty, create first node
{
    temp = (struct node*) malloc ( sizeof ( struct node ) ) ;
    temp -> info = num ;
    temp -> link = NULL ;
    q = temp ;        
}
else{
    temp = q ;         

    /* go to last node */
    while ( temp -> link != NULL )
        temp = temp -> link ;

    /* add node at the end */
    r = (struct node *)malloc ( sizeof ( struct node ) ) ;
    r -> info = num ;
    r -> link = NULL ;
    temp -> link = r ;

STATICFILES_DIRS = (

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{{ STATIC_URL }}/css/style.css" />
 And the error in the log: [06/Apr/2012 13:36:09] "GET /css/reset.css HTTP/1.1" 404 2193
[06/Apr/2012 13:36:09] "GET /css/style.css HTTP/1.1" 404 2193
 How I thought I fixed it: <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{{ STATIC_URL }}static/css/reset.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{{ STATIC_URL }}static/css/style.css" />    
 And it worked until I made another view-: from django.shortcuts import render_to_response
from django.template import RequestContext

def test(request):
    return render_to_response('test.html')
 And in the template I added the {% extends 'base/base.html' %} and what do I get in the logs? this: [06/Apr/2012 13:46:55] "GET /test/ HTTP/1.1" 200 964

[06/Apr/2012 13:46:55] "GET /test/static/css/reset.css HTTP/1.1" 404 2229
 Notice the /test/? It doesn't load the css. Any idea why?(I never had this problem with django1.3) Thanks in advance :)

@TITLE:Transparent UIImageView in front of all the UI
@CONTENT:After the first launch of my app i want to show the user a little tutorial, to explain the functionality of my app. So i need to set a transpalent UIImageView with some arrow and labels, where the main UI(more specificly,tableviewcontroller in navigationviewcontroller in a tabbarcontroler) is stil visible behind the tutorial image. And,because tutorial consists of several images,I want to add a tap gesture that will switch to another image. I tried just to add an UIImageView to my tabbarcontroller,and andd a gesturerecogniser to that, but it doesn't react to my tap's,it just works,like if there were no ImageView - selects's the roe in table,pushes the buttons.    -(void)nextTap:(UIGestureRecognizer*)nextTap
{
    //Show another image
}
-(void)showTutorial

    NSLog(@"Show tutorial");
    UIImageView *tutorialImage = [[UIImageView alloc]initWithImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"BG"]];

    UITapGestureRecognizer *nextTap = [[UITapGestureRecognizer alloc]initWithTarget:self action:@selector(nextTap:)];
    [tutorialImage addGestureRecognizer:nextTap];

@TITLE:Is there a framework that allows me to define a model only once?
@CONTENT:I just finished creating several models and a had to separately write all of their attributes in 1) a Rails ActiveRecord 2) a Rails database migration, and 3) a Backbone.js model. I'm not feeling very DRY. I assume the first step in DRYing up this problem would be to switch to node.js where I can use CoffeeScript on the back and front end (ideally reusing that same Backbone.js model), but what about the database schema? I realize I can create a framework that generates SQL from model attributes, but before I embark on that endeavor I was wondering if something like this already exists or is in development. It would also be awesome if this framework could unify views and controllers so that I don't have app/views, app/controllers, app/assets/javascripts/views, app/assets/javascripts/routers, and the like all defining similar things in different places.

I read that it's better practice to load this one image instead of loading 6 images. I've found this to be true as well, when I used tables and CSS. However, when I set this image as the source of an image element and then set the size of the image element to 1024*768, the image is squished. Ack! How can I get this image to be not-squished by using only Javascript? Also, how could I move the background of the image? [example: Imagine a really long strip of paper. Then, place a small cut-out rectangle of paper over that somewhere on the strip of paper, so that you can only see the part of the strip that is inside the rectangle. This is what I want to do]

@LINK:/questions/10037168/recursive-replace-from-a-table-of-characters
@TITLE:Recursive replace from a table of characters
@CONTENT:In short, I am looking for a single recursive query that can perform multiple replaces over one string. I have a notion it can be done, but am failing to wrap my head around it. Granted, I'd prefer the biz-layer of the application, or even the CLR, to do the replacing, but these are not options in this case. More specifically, I want to replace the below mess - which is C&P in 8 different stored procedures - with a TVF. SET @temp = REPLACE(RTRIM(@target), '~', '-')
SET @temp = REPLACE(@temp, '''', '-')
SET @temp = REPLACE(@temp, '!', '-')
SET @temp = REPLACE(@temp, '@', '-')
SET @temp = REPLACE(@temp, '#', '-')
-- 23 additional lines reducted
SET @target = @temp
 Here is where I've started: -- I have a split string TVF called tvf_SplitString that takes a string 
-- and a splitter, and returns a table with one row for each element.
-- EDIT: tvf_SplitString returns a two-column table: pos, element, of which
--       pos is simply the row_number of the element.
SELECT REPLACE('A~B!C@D@C!B~A', MM.ELEMENT, '-') TGT
FROM   dbo.tvf_SplitString('~-''-!-@-#', '-') MM
 Notice I've joined all the offending characters into a single string separated by '-' (knowing that '-' will never be one of the offending characters), which is then split. The result from this query looks like: TGT
------------
A-B!C@D@C!B-A
A~B!C@D@C!B~A
A~B-C@D@C-B~A
A~B!C-D-C!B~A
A~B!C@D@C!B~A
 So, the replace clearly works, but now I want it to be recursive so I can pull the top 1 and eventually come out with: TGT
------------
A-B-C-D-C-B-A
 Any ideas on how to accomplish this with one query? EDIT: Well, actual recursion isn't necessary if there's another way. I'm pondering the use of a table of numbers here, too.
@CODE:SET @temp = REPLACE(RTRIM(@target), '~', '-')
SET @temp = REPLACE(@temp, '''', '-')
SET @temp = REPLACE(@temp, '!', '-')
SET @temp = REPLACE(@temp, '@', '-')
SET @temp = REPLACE(@temp, '#', '-')
-- 23 additional lines reducted
SET @target = @temp -- I have a split string TVF called tvf_SplitString that takes a string

@TITLE:How to declare a Class<?> object such that is is an Enum AND an Interface in Java
@CONTENT:I have a utility class that needs to work on a generic Class but must be restricted to those that are an enum and implement a particular interface. // These two work
Class<? extends Enum<?>> enumClass;
Class<? extends MyInterface> interfaceClass;

// This is what I want but does not work
Class<? extends MyInterface & Enum<?>> enumAndInterfaceClass;
 For generics I can successfully use this public class MyClass<T extends Enum<T> & MyInterface> {
    public MyClass(Class<T> theClass) {
        ...
    }
}
 However I can't use the Generics everywhere and need to declare it separately. I am not sure if this is even possible. So my question boils down to how can I declare a member variable with those constraints? So Currently MyClass is a singleton then as needed the enum/interface can be updated. The return values of its operations will change depending on which enum it is given. I would like to not have the generics on it since that would require creating a new instance for every change to the enum. There is a lot of code using it already so deviating from the singleton is not going to be approved. So a reference must be kept. I suppose I could only enforce the Interface requirement then check in the setter method that it is an enum throwing an exception otherwise but that is not ideal. Edit (Updated question and added more detail)
@CODE:// These two work
Class<? extends Enum<?>> enumClass;
Class<? extends MyInterface> interfaceClass;

// This is what I want but does not work
Class<? extends MyInterface & Enum<?>> enumAndInterfaceClass; public class MyClass<T extends Enum<T> & MyInterface> {

 In this case, the com.example.hs.model.Division class does have two @Transient annotations for methods that calculate a return value from a HashMap. The HashMap is retrieved via Hibernate as follows: @OneToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL, fetch = FetchType.EAGER)
@JoinColumn(name = "division_id", referencedColumnName = "id")
@MapKey(name = "language")
@Field(name="name")
@FieldBridge(impl = com.example.hs.search.LanguageDivisionTextBridge.class)
protected Map<Language, DivisionText> getDivisionTextMap() {
    return divisionTextMap;
}
 As you can see, I am using a custom FieldBridge to help in the mapping. The DivisionText class is also marked with the @Indexed annotation and is successfully being indexed. The full set of source can be found at: https://github.com/jsvazic/hibernate-search-example Any help would be greatly appreciated.

The catch is that the thread increases the retain count of the owner, in my case the class that instantiated it. So, even if I am done using that class, that instance is still going to hang around unless whoever is managing my class also has the smarts to know to shut down the thread. That is one solution, but this is what I found in code. - (oneway void)release
{
    // This override allows allows this object to be dealloced 
    // by shutting down the thread when the thread holds the last reference.
    // Otherwise, the object will never be dealloc'd
    if (self.retainCount == 2)
    {
        [self quitDispatchThread];
    }

    [super release];
}
 This is a clever solution, but I'm not sure what to think of it. It overrides release on the class and checks to see if the retain count is 2. In other words, it checks to see if the thread is the only thing keeping my object alive (since the retain count is about to be decremented from 2 to 1) and if it is, it terminates the thread (quitDispatchThread will block until the thread is terminated). So... Can you rely on retainCount to see if it is one? Usually people say to stay clear of retainCount because you don't know if there are some autoreleases in there. However, if the retainCount is one then I know for a fact that only the thread is keeping it alive and I don't have to be concerned that the retainCount might be off due to some autoreleases, etc... What's wrong with this code? I was about to remove it, but it actually seems to make sense. Other objects don't have to have an awareness that my class is running a thread. Other objects can safely retain and release or even autorelease the object owning the thread without having to worry about shutting the thread down because it takes care of itself. This code actually feels clean, which surprises me. Edit :: NSThread is Retaining my Object The retain count of my object is increased by the fact I'm using NSThread. My object is the target and the selector is the method the thread runs on. initWithTarget:selector:object: Returns an NSThread object initialized with the given arguments. (id)initWithTarget:(id)target selector:(SEL)selector object:(id)argument Parameters target The object to which the message specified by selector is sent. selector The selector for the message to send to target. This selector must take only one argument and must not have a return value. argument The single argument passed to the target. May be nil. Return Value An NSThread object initialized with the given arguments. Discussion For non garbage-collected applications, the method selector is responsible for setting up an autorelease pool for the newly detached thread and freeing that pool before it exits. Garbage-collected applications do not need to create an autorelease pool. The objects target and argument are retained during the execution of the detached thread. They are released when the thread finally exits.

@TITLE:Replacing a line in a file without rewriting the entire file (in PHP)
@CONTENT:Lets say I have a modestly sized text file (~850kb, 10,000+ lines) And I want to replace a particular line (or several) spread out amongst the file. Current methods for doing this include re-writing the whole file. The current method I use is read through the entire file line by line, writing to a .tmp file, and once I am done, I rename() the tmp file to the original source file. It works, but it is slow. And of course, as the file grows, so will execution times. Is there another way (using PHP) to get the job done without having to rewrite the entire file every time a line or two need to be replaced or removed? Thanks! I looked around and could not find an answer to this on stackoverflow.

@TITLE:How to call overloading functions from the base class (not abstract)?
@CONTENT:Class DVD inherits class Media, has one more variable than the base class does. I declare a pointer: Media* ptr = new DVD(...);
 I want to print out the content of the DVD, so the following code works as expected: ptr->print(cout);
 But using the overloaded << operator only invokes the base class print() function: cout << *ptr << endl;
 So it prints out only the ID, not with the name of the director. One way to solve this problem is to modify the overload << operator a bit to make it accept pointers, so: cout << ptr << endl;
 should work, but somehow I must find the way to make cout << *ptr << endl; work as expected. Any advice? The thing is I can't make the base class (Media) abstract because I need to call an instance of it in the overloading ostream operator, so a pointer of the base class can not invoke the overloading function of the derived class, which it's pointing to. Code: #include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Media{
    private:
        int id;
    public:
        Media(int _id) : id(_id) {}

        virtual void print(ostream &out);
        friend ostream& operator << (ostream& out, Media aMedia);
};
Media::~Media(){}

class DVD : public Media {
    private:
        string director;
    public:
        DVD(int _id, string _director = "unknown") : Media(_id), director(_director) {}
        ~DVD();
        void print(ostream &out);
};
DVD::~DVD(){}

void Media::print(ostream& out){
    out << "ID " << id;
}
void DVD::print(ostream& out){
    out << "DVD: ";
    Media::print(out);
    out << " Directed by " << director;
}
ostream& operator << (ostream& out, Media aMedia){
    aMedia.print(out);
    return out;
}

int main() { 
    Media *ptr = new DVD(352, "Stephen Spielberg"); 
    ptr->print(cout); // Prints out: "DVD: ID 352 Directed by Stephen Spielberg". Correct!
    cout << endl; 
    cout << *ptr << endl; //Prints out: "ID 352" Incorrect!
}
@CODE:Media* ptr = new DVD(...); ptr->print(cout); cout << *ptr << endl; cout << ptr << endl; cout << *ptr << endl; #include <iostream>

@TITLE:How to extract FlateDecoded Images from PDF with PDFSharp
@CONTENT:how do I extract Images, which are FlateDecoded (such like PNG) out of a PDF-Document with PDFSharp? I found that comment in a Sample of PDFSharp: // TODO: You can put the code here that converts vom PDF internal image format to a
// Windows bitmap
// and use GDI+ to save it in PNG format.
// [...]
// Take a look at the file
// PdfSharp.Pdf.Advanced/PdfImage.cs to see how we create the PDF image formats.
 Does anyone have a solution for this problem? Thanks for your replies. EDIT: Because I'm not able to answer on my own Question within 8 hours, I do it on that way: Thanks for your very fast reply. I added some Code to the Method "ExportAsPngImage", but I didn't get the wanted results. It is just extracting a few more Images (png) and they don't have the right colors and are distorted. Here's my actual Code: PdfSharp.Pdf.Filters.FlateDecode flate = new PdfSharp.Pdf.Filters.FlateDecode();
        byte[] decodedBytes = flate.Decode(bytes);

        System.Drawing.Imaging.PixelFormat pixelFormat;

        switch (bitsPerComponent)
        {
            case 1:
                pixelFormat = PixelFormat.Format1bppIndexed;
                break;
            case 8:
                pixelFormat = PixelFormat.Format8bppIndexed;
                break;
            case 24:
                pixelFormat = PixelFormat.Format24bppRgb;
                break;
            default:
                throw new Exception("Unknown pixel format " + bitsPerComponent);
        }

        Bitmap bmp = new Bitmap(width, height, pixelFormat);
        var bmpData = bmp.LockBits(new Rectangle(0, 0, width, height), ImageLockMode.WriteOnly, pixelFormat);
        int length = (int)Math.Ceiling(width * bitsPerComponent / 8.0);
        for (int i = 0; i < height; i++)
        {
            int offset = i * length;
            int scanOffset = i * bmpData.Stride;
            Marshal.Copy(decodedBytes, offset, new IntPtr(bmpData.Scan0.ToInt32() + scanOffset), length);
        }
        bmp.UnlockBits(bmpData);
        using (FileStream fs = new FileStream(@"C:\Export\PdfSharp\" + String.Format("Image{0}.png", count), FileMode.Create, FileAccess.Write))
        {
            bmp.Save(fs, System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageFormat.Png);
        }
 Is that the right way? Or should I choose another way? Thanks a lot!

@CONTENT:java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentLinkedQueue comes to mind, but is it really optimum for this two-thread scenario? I am looking for the minimum latency possible on both sides (producer and consumer). If the queue is empty you can immediately return null AND if the queue is full you can immediately discard the entry you are offering. Does ConcurrentLinkedQueue use super fast and light locks (AtomicBoolean) ? Has anyone benchmarked ConcurrentLinkedQueue or knows about the ultimate fastest way of doing that? Additional Details: I imagine the queue should be a fair one, meaning the consumer should not make the consumer wait any longer than it needs (by front-running it) and vice-versa.

@TITLE:Insert space after semi-colon, unless it's part of an HTML entity
@CONTENT:I'm trying to insert a space after each semi-colon, unless the semi-colon is part of an HTML entity. The examples here are short, but my strings can be quite long, with several semi-colons (or none). Coca&#8209;Cola =>     Coca&#8209;Cola  (&#8209; is a non-breaking hyphen)
Beverage;Food;Music => Beverage; Food; Music
 I found the following regular expression that does the trick for short strings: <?php
$a[] = 'Coca&#8209;Cola';
$a[] = 'Beverage;Food;Music';
$regexp = '/(?:&#?\w+;|[^;])+/';
foreach ($a as $str) {
    echo ltrim(preg_replace($regexp, ' $0', $str)).'<br>';
}
?>
 However, if the string is somewhat large, the preg_replace above actually crashes my Apache server (The connection to the server was reset while the page was loading.) Add the following to the sample code above: $a[] = 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. '.
   'In blandit metus arcu. Fusce eu orci nulla, in interdum risus. '.
   'Maecenas ut velit turpis, eu pretium libero. Integer molestie '.
   'faucibus magna sagittis posuere. Morbi volutpat luctus turpis, '.
   'in pretium augue pellentesque quis. Cras tempor, sem suscipit '.
   'dapibus lacinia, dolor sapien ultrices est, eget laoreet nibh '.
   'ligula at massa. Cum sociis natoque penatibus et magnis dis '.
   'parturient montes, nascetur ridiculus mus. Phasellus nulla '.
   'dolor, placerat non sem. Proin tempor tempus erat, facilisis '.
   'euismod lectus pharetra vel. Etiam faucibus, lectus a '.
   'scelerisque dignissim, odio turpis commodo massa, vitae '.
   'tincidunt ante sapien non neque. Proin eleifend, lacus et '.
   'luctus pellentesque;odio felis.';
 The code above (with the large string) crashes Apache but works if I run PHP on the command line. Elsewhere in my program I use preg_replace on much larger strings without problem, so I'm guessing something it the regular expression overwhelms PHP/Apache. So, is there a way to 'fix' the regex so it works on Apache with large strings or is there another, safer, way to do this? I'm using PHP 5.2.17 with Apache 2.0.64 on Windows XP SP3, if it's any help. (Unfortunately, upgrading either PHP or Apache is not an option for now.)
@CODE:Coca&#8209;Cola =>     Coca&#8209;Cola  (&#8209; is a non-breaking hyphen)
Beverage;Food;Music => Beverage; Food; Music <?php
$a[] = 'Coca&#8209;Cola';
$a[] = 'Beverage;Food;Music';
$regexp = '/(?:&#?\w+;|[^;])+/';
foreach ($a as $str) {
    echo ltrim(preg_replace($regexp, ' $0', $str)).'<br>';
}
?> preg_replace $a[] = 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. '.
   'In blandit metus arcu. Fusce eu orci nulla, in interdum risus. '.

@TITLE:Autofac Module Scanning for Various Applications
@CONTENT:Let's say you're working on an ASP.NET MVC project and it is layers split up into different projects in a single solution. Each project has autofac modules created to wire up the dependencies. Now, I would like to scan the assemblies and register all of the modules into the container. I adapted an extension method similar to what was shared here http://goo.gl/VJEct public static void RegisterAssemblyModules(this ContainerBuilder builder, Assembly 
assembly)
{
  var scanningBuilder = new ContainerBuilder();

  scanningBuilder.RegisterAssemblyTypes(assembly)
    .Where(t => typeof(IModule).IsAssignableFrom(t))
    .As<IModule>();

  using (var scanningContainer = scanningBuilder.Build())
  {
    foreach (var m in scanningContainer.Resolve<IEnumerable<IModule>>())
      builder.RegisterModule(module);
  }
}
 My first question, considering that this sample was provided a few years ago, is this still an feasible construct to use with current versions of autofac? Secondly, the MVC app is dependent on functionality in the other layers which means at times I would need to register types with .InstancePerHttpRequest(). However, I would also like to have the option of referencing them from non web applications and not take a dependency on System.Web. What is the best approach for to register modules that can be used in these different contexts?
@CODE:public static void RegisterAssemblyModules(this ContainerBuilder builder, Assembly 
assembly)
{
  var scanningBuilder = new ContainerBuilder();

  scanningBuilder.RegisterAssemblyTypes(assembly)
    .Where(t => typeof(IModule).IsAssignableFrom(t))
    .As<IModule>();

  using (var scanningContainer = scanningBuilder.Build())
  {
    foreach (var m in scanningContainer.Resolve<IEnumerable<IModule>>())
      builder.RegisterModule(module);
  }

@TITLE:ORACLE/ASP.NET: ORA-2020 - Too many database linksK what's causing this?
@CONTENT:Here's the scenario... We have an internal website that is running the latest version of the ODAC (Oracle Client). It opens database connections, runs a stored procedure or packaged method, then disconnects. Connection pooling is turned on, and we are currently under version 11g in both our development and test environments, but under 10gR2 in our production environment. This happens on Production. A few days ago, a process began firing off a ORA-2020 error. The process is called from a webpage on our internal website. The user simply sets a date, hits a button, and a job is started on another system that is separate from the website. The call itself, however, uses a database link to run a function. We've scoured the SQL to find that it only uses that one database link. And since these links are on a per session basis and the user isn't exceeding the default limit of 4, how is it possible that we are getting a ORA-2020 error. We have ran a number of tests to try to push over the default limit of 4. ODAC, from what I recall, runs a commit after each connection, and I can't seem to run 4 DB links, then run a piece of SQL with 1 DB link directly after with any errors. The only way I can bring up this error is if I run a query with 4 DB links, then a function or piece of dynamic SQL with a database link within it. We don't have that problem as this issue is sporadic. It isn't ALWAYS happening. Questions Is it possible that connection pooling is allowing User B to use User A's connection after the initial process was run, thus adding to the open links number if User B runs a SQL statement with more database links? Is this a scenario where we should up our limit past 4? What are the disadvantages of increasing the number? Do I need to explicitly close open database links before disconnecting from the database? Oracle documentation seems to suggest it should automatically happen, but "on occasion"... doesn't.

 It works for me....... Hotspot turns on...... But there are also advanced settings by clicking 'menu' button.... And here is a problem... DHCP becomes disabled in LanSettings and Power Mode is only 5 minutes working on.... I want DHCP tto be ENABLED and PowerMode - "always on"...How can I resolve it?

@CONTENT:I'm working on a picture select/crop program and using this code below: http://www.androidworks.com/crop_large_photos_with_android/comment-page-1#comment-969 As far as I could understand we set properties with putting extras to our intent like the code below. In order to change selection area we need to touch the border and then arrows became visible but what I want to do is make them always visible because it is hard to make user understand that way. Instagram's Android application do it that way so I guess there is a way to do that. Thanks. Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_GET_CONTENT, null);
                intent.setType("image/*");
                intent.putExtra("crop", "true");

                intent.putExtra("return-data", return_data);
                intent.putExtra(MediaStore.EXTRA_OUTPUT, getTempUri());
 Edit / solution: Thanks to @Renard I found solution like this: I used this gallery source code: http://gitorious.org/0xdroid/packages_apps_gallery3d/trees/3c02f2877dc2f8f0b5c01d03fa2b487c040e4000 I tried some other gallery resource code too but this one is the easiest one to maintain. You just need to delete below if check in Highlightview.java class' draw() function: if (mMode == ModifyMode.Grow)  
 When you do that it works but the arrows are repating itself while moving and in order to avoid that you need to change moveBy() method's last line which is: mContext.invalidate(invalRect);
 with this: mContext.invalidate();
@CODE:Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_GET_CONTENT, null);
                intent.setType("image/*");
                intent.putExtra("crop", "true");
                intent.putExtra("aspectX", aspectX);

@CONTENT:I'm having trouble fitting a loess smooth plus confidence limits to a scatterplot of residuals. My model is height ~ weight + chest circumference. To check linearity of chest circumference, I've fitted a model without chest circumference (i.e. height ~ weight), and plotted the residuals of this model against chest circumference. So far so good. I then tried to use loess() and predict() to plot a loess line, plus confidence limits. The result looks like this (in the picture I've only plotted the central line, but the CI lines look the same): Loess problem in scatterplot The points are correct (when I plot the loess fit as points it looks right), but for some reason the line is not being drawn how I expect. My code is below: # bf.red = data set; mod.nch = model; chestc = chest circumference;
# loess = loess model; lo.pred = predict loess

plot(bf.red$chestc           #Chest circumference
 ,residuals(mod.nch))    #Residuals from height ~ weight model

loess <- loess(mod.nch$residuals ~ bf.red$chestc)

@CONTENT:I use postgres 8.4 and currently trying to import a trivial CSV: Here is a table: CREATE TABLE public.sample (
  a VARCHAR, 
  b VARCHAR
) WITHOUT OIDS;
 and here is a csv file sample: "foo","bar, baz"
 The query COPY sample FROM '/tmp/sample.csv' USING DELIMITERS ',';
 expected throws ERROR:  extra data after last expected column
CONTEXT:  COPY sample, line 1: ""foo","bar, baz""
 But, well, CSV parsing is not a rocket science and I would wonder if it is not possible to solve without reformatting the source csv. Any ideas? PS: the csv comes from 3rd party, I cannot change the format. PPS: yes, I understand I could pre-process it (change the delimiter manually) before I import it Final solution: COPY sample FROM '/tmp/sample.csv' WITH DELIMITER ',' CSV;

@TITLE:Facebook PHP: After user logs out of facebook, they can't login to my app with another user
@CONTENT:Sorry for the confusing title, here's the situation... A user logs into my app with Facebook The user logs out of facebook....someone else comes to the computer... The second user tries to access my app (different facebook account, same computer) They can't...instead the script gets the access token for the previous user. I'm using the facebook PHP SDK. When the user tries to login for the first time I do the following; unset($_REQUEST);
unset($_COOKIE); //don't know if both are necessary
session_destroy();
 Yet SOMEHOW the new fb account is still recognized as the last one (I get the previously logged in users access token which throws an exception when I try to use it since that user isn't logged in anymore). Do I need to use the logout function? I assume that logs the user out of facebook, which isn't want I want to do, just start fresh with a new user in my app. Any ideas? I'm really at loss on where this data is persisting from since I'm clearing everything. Hopefully its something stupid I'm missing but I thought I'd ask in case anyone knew anything.

@CONTENT:WPF is great in that I should be able to use {StaticResource MyBackground} instead of "White" throughout my app, and then by changing resource definitions redefine the look of my entire application. Problem is Expression Blend just won't work if you have references to global resources in a subcontrol. Is there any other way of theme-ing your app? I am not willing to lose Blend designer support, or replicate a piece of code/xaml in every single control. I find it astounding that they have not fixed a bug of this magnitude. Any ideas? Cheers

In Rails you can check if a model is valid by writing like this: my_model.valid? I have only seen examples where I can validate the models in the controller but that's not what I want to do right now when I'm writing unit tests. It would be nice to have myModel.isValid(); or something similar.

@TITLE:Jquery DataTable auto scroll to bottom on load
@CONTENT:I am using the jQuery DataTable plug-in and can not see to find a way to make it scroll to the bottom of the table when the data loads via AJAX. So the basic layout of my page has two 3 jQuery DataTables on it. From what I see by inspecting the rendered code is that the plug-in will create a div wrapper with an id of "myTableid_wrapper" with two children a header and the table. Now if the table is triggers the scrolling ability then the table will again be wrapped in another div with overflow:hidden so the table can be scrolled. This div has a class name of "dataTables_scrollBody". Here is an example of a table that has not triggered the scroll feature. <div id="myTable1_wrapper" class="dataTables_wrapper" >
  <div id="case_activity_table_filter">no worried about this guy</div>
    <table id="myTable1" >does not matter whats in here</table>
</div>
 Here is the general layout of a table that has triggered the scroll feature of the plugin. As you can see the div with the class "dataTables_scrollBody" is auto-generated by the plugin. <div id="myTable2_wrapper" class="dataTables_wrapper" >
  <div id="case_activity_table_filter">no worried about this guy</div>
  <div class="dataTables_scrollBody" style="overflow:hidden" >
    <table id="myTable2" >does not matter whats in here</table>
  </div>
</div>
 Both of these tables reside on the same page. Both of these tables may or may not have the scroll div. Is there way to target class "dataTables_scrollBody" and have it scroll bottom when the table is created via AJAX?
@CODE:<div id="myTable1_wrapper" class="dataTables_wrapper" >
  <div id="case_activity_table_filter">no worried about this guy</div>
    <table id="myTable1" >does not matter whats in here</table>
</div> <div id="myTable2_wrapper" class="dataTables_wrapper" >
  <div id="case_activity_table_filter">no worried about this guy</div>

@TITLE:How to tell if a program uses dynamic dispatch by looking at the assembly
@CONTENT:I read a post on Reddit on Herb Stutter: JIT will never be as fast as native and somebody made a comment that it was incredible somebody called Herb "misinformed" that C# uses virtual methods instead of non-virtual (you can read the article here). It got me to thinking and I made a quick little program and noticed that C# does in fact generate virtual methods for CIL (callvirt vs call). But then I was told it wasn't that easy and that the JIT may inline the code instead of using vtables and dynamic dispatch. I fired up my debugger and tried to see. Here is my simple program: namespace ConsoleApplication1
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Test t = new Test();
            t.TestIt();
            t.TestOut();

        }
    }

    class Test
    {
        public Test() { }
        public void TestIt()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("TESTIT");
        }
        public void TestOut()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("TESTOUT");
        }
    }
}
 And then here is the assembly: namespace ConsoleApplication1
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Test t = new Test();
00000000  push        ebp  
00000001  mov         ebp,esp 
00000003  push        esi  
00000004  mov         ecx,439E68h 
00000009  call        FFCE0AD4 
0000000e  mov         esi,eax 
            t.TestIt();
00000010  call        704BBEB8 // Call to Console.WriteLine()
00000015  mov         ecx,eax 
00000017  mov         edx,dword ptr ds:[02A02088h] 
0000001d  mov         eax,dword ptr [ecx] 
0000001f  call        dword ptr [eax+000000D8h] 
            t.TestOut();
00000025  call        704BBEB8  // Call to Console.WriteLine()
0000002a  mov         ecx,eax

00000034  call        dword ptr [eax+000000D8h] 
0000003a  pop         esi  

    }
0000003b  pop         ebp  
0000003c  ret     
 My question is this: by looking at the assembly how does one tell if it is using dynamic dispatch? My hunch is that it is because of these 4 instructions which resemble what I remember from my programming language class: 0000002a  mov         ecx,eax 
0000002c  mov         edx,dword ptr ds:[02A0208Ch] 
00000032  mov         eax,dword ptr [ecx] 
00000034  call        dword ptr [eax+000000D8h]
 Am I correct in assuming this is dynamic dispatch? If so, are there any other tell-tale signs? If I'm wrong, how would I be able to tell if it is dynamic dispatch or not?

In order to have all of WPF's Changenotification mechanisms working for my implementation, all I have to do now is exchange my Collections with ObservableCollections, which unfortunately brings along a performance issue (change notification for every record added / removed, so not fit for bulk usage because UI gets way too busy trying to keep up with the list of changes). Thus, In my models, collections of other models (HasMany relationships, that is) are not held within a list, but within a ObservableCollection-derivate that has two Methods SuspendCollectionChangeNotification and ResumeCollectionChangeNotification (A bit like the implementation shown here). The infrastructure is all there, now I'm looking for an Interceptor hook that enables me to call Suspend() before NHibernate Loads Child data and Resume() after it's done. I'm a bit afraid I will end up adding this to the proxy I mentioned above, which has a good grasp of the properties that are being requested, but it would be just lovely to keep this in an NHibernate Interceptor...

On the downside, however, code cannot assume that the standard C types have any specific size. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that an int is the same size as a long Question is, i thought int is the same as the word size, not long, and i couldn't find any official standard which defines this saying. any thoughts?

@TITLE:Client-side Validation fails for DropDownList on int field, IE browser
@CONTENT:Win 7 Ult, IE9. The following list is passed to a DropDownList in the view through a view bag. List<int> test1ddl = new List<int> { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 };
 It was working fine for a few days and then suddenly started failing Client-side Validation with a The field Test1 must be a number when posted (it never reaches the POST Action). It fails when I pass a List or List . If I replace the DropDownList with an EditorFor the POST works and the filed is updated. The only thing I had done on the computer was to re-install IIS, this is occurring in debug using IIS Express. When I restored a backup to the computer the problem went away. I subsequently deployed an App to the internet using this DropDownList setup and it fails with the must be a number error with IE 8 on XP. Chrome and FireFox work fine. It also works fine with IE9 on Win7. I also found that I dont even have to click on Save, just clicking out of the browser window to take it out of focus, after selecting the DropDownList, brings up the validation error. This happens with both the string and int List. This also occurs with IE8 on XP with the deployed Web App. I restored a backup of the failing Win7 configuration and it then failed again in debug using IE9 on IIS Express. If I open up the deployed site with IE9 in this configuration it works fine. (I cant test Chrome with IIS Express because in the failing configuration VS2010 will not use the default browser, only IE. That is a separate question if anyone has an idea on why that is happening). At this point I dont think there is anything wrong with the actual code but it seems to be a browser problem. Since XP and IE8 is still a very common desktop setup I need to get this to work. My question is why do some browsers generate the Validation error?

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="all" href="http://www.mywebserver.com/wp-    content/themes/twentyeleven/style.css" />
<link rel="pingback" href="http://www.mywebserver.com/xmlrpc.php" />
 Is there a way to tell Wordpress to strip out the domain name in the generated URLs? For example, I would prefer: <link rel="profile" href="http://gmpg.org/xfn/11" />
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="all" href="/wp-content/themes/twentyeleven/style.css" />
<link rel="pingback" href="/xmlrpc.php" />
@CODE:<link rel="profile" href="http://gmpg.org/xfn/11" />
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="all" href="http://www.mywebserver.com/wp-    content/themes/twentyeleven/style.css" />
<link rel="pingback" href="http://www.mywebserver.com/xmlrpc.php" /> <link rel="profile" href="http://gmpg.org/xfn/11" />
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="all" href="/wp-content/themes/twentyeleven/style.css" />

@TITLE:calculating 'timeIntervalSinceNow' with a negative value (CLLocation example)?
@CONTENT:i don't understand this example from the doc : the timeIntervalSinceNow method should show a positive value, but how can we reach "5" as mentioned in the code? (i think it's either 0 more or less, or -10 , -20, -30 etc... but how can we get a positive value such as 5?) : - (void)locationManager:(CLLocationManager *)manager didUpdateToLocation:(CLLocation *)newLocation fromLocation:(CLLocation *)oldLocation {
    // test the age of the location measurement to determine if the measurement is cached
    // in most cases you will not want to rely on cached measurements
    NSTimeInterval locationAge = -[newLocation.timestamp timeIntervalSinceNow];
    if (locationAge > 5.0) return;
 Thanks for your help

@TITLE:How do I handle a string array returned from a C# Method in VBA
@CONTENT:I have written an assembly in C# which returns a string array, the C# code is below: [ComVisible(true)]
public class PostcodeFinder
{
    public string[] SearchPostcodes(string postCode)
    {
        var searchService = new QuickAddress("http://x.x.x.x:xxxx/")
                                {Engine = QuickAddress.EngineTypes.Singleline, Flatten = true};

        var mPicklist = searchService.Search("GBR", postCode, PromptSet.Types.OneLine);
        var x = mPicklist.Picklist.Items.Count();

        var resultsToReturn = new string[x];

        for (var i = 0; i < x; i++)
        {
            resultsToReturn[i] = mPicklist.Picklist.Items[i].PartialAddress;
        }

        return resultsToReturn;
    }
}
 I have then built this assembly, being sure to tick the Register for COM interop box in properties. Then in Microsoft Access, I have added the .tlb file to the references and created a form with a couple of controls (one of which is a Listbox control named lstResults). Under the main button control, I have the following VBA code: Private Sub btnSearch_Click()

    Dim postcodeToSearch As String
    postcodeToSearch = Me.txtPostcode

    Dim c As New PostcodeFinder
    Dim results

    results = c.SearchPostcodes(postcodeToSearch)

End Sub
 Edit: This runs without error, however when I query the Immediate window with ?results after putting some dummy code below to allow me to place a breakpoint, I get the following error: Run-time error '13' - Type mismatch Effectively I want to rewrite the following C# code in VBA: var results = c.SearchPostcodes(postcodeToSearch);

foreach(var x in results)
{
    lstResults.Items.Add(x);
}
 Thanks in advance

@TITLE:Magento - Add Custom Mass Action PDF
@CONTENT:Quick Question (Keep this in mind when reading): Why is this error being produced (in explanation) and how can I edit the pdfRmaAction() to work correctly (Mass Action Printing)??? **Working in Magento v.1.10.1.0 which is the same as v.1.5.1.0 Long-winded explanation: I've downloaded this extension (http://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/admin-order-printing-extension.html) to add a button to each order so that when you go into the order, you have an extra button to print an RMA (Customized from this extensions Model pdf - turned into a custom RMA form based on invoice) It works great. However, I want to add Mass Action printing to it so that you can check a few orders and choose Print RMA from the dropdown and print the forms for those orders. In the extensions config.xml file (app/code/local/Nastnet/OrderPrint/etc/), inside the <config> tags is this: <modules>
    <Nastnet_OrderPrint>
        <version>0.1.3</version>

 In (app/code/local/Nastnet/OrderPrint/Block/Sales/Order/) in Grid.php is this: class Nastnet_OrderPrint_Block_Sales_Order_Grid extends Mage_Adminhtml_Block_Sales_Order_Grid
{
    protected function _prepareMassaction()
    {
        parent::_prepareMassaction();

        // Append new mass action option
        $this->getMassactionBlock()->addItem('rmaprint',
        array('label' => $this->__('Print RMA'),
              'url'   => $this->getUrl('orderprint/order/pdfRma')));
    }
}
 This leads to the desired result of inserting "Print RMA" into the dropdown menu on the Sales > Orders grid view screen. In the OrderController.php file (app/code/local/Nastnet/OrderPrint/controllers/) I've added this [copied and edited from the pdfinvoicesAction() in app/code/core/Mage/Adminhtml/controllers/Sales/OrderController.php: public function pdfRmaAction(){
    $orderIds = $this->getRequest()->getPost('order_ids');
    //print_r($orderIds);
    $flag = false;
    if (!empty($orderIds)) {
        foreach ($orderIds as $orderId) {
            $invoices = Mage::getResourceModel('sales/order_invoice_collection')
                ->setOrderFilter($orderId)
                ->load();
                //print get_class($invoices);
                //print_r($invoices->getSize());
            if ($invoices->getSize() > 0) {
                $flag = true;
                if (!isset($pdf)){
                    $pdf = Mage::getModel('Nastnet_OrderPrint/order_pdf_order')->getPdf(array($order));
                } else {
                    $pages = Mage::getModel('Nastnet_OrderPrint/order_pdf_order')->getPdf(array($order));
                    $pdf->pages = array_merge ($pdf->pages, $pages->pages);
                }
            }
        }
        if ($flag) {
            return $this->_prepareDownloadResponse(
                'rma'.Mage::getSingleton('core/date')->date('Y-m-d_H-i-s').'.pdf', $pdf->render(),
                'application/pdf'
            );
        } else {
            $this->_getSession()->addError($this->__('There are no printable documents related to selected orders.'));
            $this->_redirect('*/*/');
        }
    }
    $this->_redirect('*/*/');
}
 This leads to an error in the actual pdf... Fatal error: Call to a member function getStore() on a non-object in /chroot/home/artizara/dev.artizara.com/html/app/code/local/Nastnet/OrderPrint/Model/Order/Pdf/Order.php on line 60
 However, if you go into the order and press the Print RMA button (instead of trying to Mass Action print it) then it works Just Fine! My long winded explanation leads to this: Why is this error being produced and how can I edit the pdfRmaAction() to work correctly (Mass Action Printing)???

  info={title:'2^' + power + ' ' + diffpiter};
  tableView.appendRow(Ti.UI.createTableViewRow(info),{animated:true});
}
 The PhoneGap version is the same except for the last two lines which get replaced document.write('2^' + power + ' ' + diffpiter + '<br />');
 Both are executed on an iPhone 4S. I've run the test numerous times, to eliminate errors. How in the name of all that is holy can the Titanium version measure ~0.0009 milliseconds per iteration while the PhoneGap version measures ~0.0002 milliseconds per iteration? Titanium is supposed to compile my javascript code so I expect it to be faster. In this case however it's at least 4 times slower! I'm not an expert on performance testing, but the test I designed should be at least remotely accurate... Thank you for any tips you can give me.
@CODE:var looplength;
var start1;
var start2;
var end1;
var end2;
var duration1;
var duration2;
var diff;
var diffpiter;
var power;
var info;

for (power = 0; power < 24; power++) {
  looplength = Math.pow(2, power);

  start1 = new Date().getTime();
  for (iterator = 0; iterator < looplength; iterator++) {a=iterator;b=iterator;}
  end1 = new Date().getTime();

  start2 = new Date().getTime();
  for (iterator = 0; iterator < looplength; iterator++) {a=iterator;}

@CONTENT:Ive a small problem with model validation. I have a hidden field called theID and a textbox called theDesc. The field theDesc is an autocomplete, and when I select it, theID get the id stored. theID is the field that is stored in database, and is the one that is Requiered, so I use: @Html.ValidationMessage("theID") The problem is that the CSS class input-validation-error is assigned to the hidden field. I now this behavior its normal and expected, but there is a way to change this? what I want to accomplish is that the theDesc field shows the input error class. This way the user can notice that is missing. Is not a big deal, but my OCD is driving me crazy about not get all the errors with the same style.

But when I reach the bottom of the DIV's scrolling area, whole page begin to scroll instead. I've tried to set event handlers on that div, but preventDefault() method also prevents scrolling of the DIV itself. Here comes the wrong code: $('.folderlist').on('DOMMouseScroll mousewheel', function(ev){

 preventDefault() prevents page scroll, but also disallows the scrolling of the DIV. stopPropagation() does nothing in this case, I suppose Did I miss something?..

@TITLE:system() and CreateProcess() / CreateProcessW()
@CONTENT:I want to execute a TEST.exe in a C program. While I use system( "TEST.exe <input-file> output-file" );
 I can get what I expected. But CreateProcessW() didn't work properly when I use the following code (see How do I run an external program?): if (CreateProcessW(const_cast<LPCWSTR>(FullPathToExe.c_str()), 
    pwszParam, 0, 0, false, 
    CREATE_DEFAULT_ERROR_MODE, 0, 0, 
    &siStartupInfo, &piProcessInfo) != false)

    /* Watch the process. */ 
    dwExitCode = WaitForSingleObject(piProcessInfo.hProcess,  (SecondsToWait * 1000)); 
    iReturnVal = GetLastError(); 
} 
else 
{ 
    /* CreateProcess failed */ 
    iReturnVal = GetLastError(); 
} 
 where FullPathToExe="TEST.exe", pwszParam="TEST.exe <input-file> output-file".
 And WaitForSingleObject() returns 258, GetLastError() returns 1813 ("The specified resource type cannot be found in the image file."). Also, The above CreateProcessW() code works fine when I run my own HelloProcess.exe (print hello, and sleep some seconds determined by the following number, then exit.) with FullPathToExe="HelloProcess.exe", pwszParam="HelloProcess.exe 10".
 Any ideas? Thanks for any hints!

              }
          } 
      });
  }
}
 I thought the MouseAdapter has access to the variable edit because the newly declared MouseAdapter is an inner class of the class foo. However, it can't find the variable edit. If I explicitly declare an inner class and implements, say, the MouseAdapter interface or whatever, it can detect the variable edit from within it.So my question is what the scope the new MouseAdpater() has? Besides, does anyone know a good read on this? Thank you very much. By the way, the error I got was the local variable was accessed from an inner class, needs to declare it final

@TITLE:SQLSTATE[HY093]: Invalid parameter number: parameter was not defined (PDO)
@CONTENT:I know: this has been done to death. But, believe me, I've been researching for quite a while on how to fix this one. What I'm trying to achieve is a PDO MySQL Database wrapper for use with PDO that I can just incorporate into my code. My main problem stems from two functions in particular, as well as the actual binding of the parameters I'm trying to reach. The reason why I state two functions as opposed to one is, despite my efforts, I haven't been able to spot which one is attempting the problem. The variable's I've var_dumped have confirmed that it's not the variable, it's something else. Still, the fact that I'm getting this error in first place means that something has to be wrong with the code. Exhibit A: fetch( $table, $columns, $whereArgs ) The purpose of this function is to simply fetch a row. This is achieved by accepting the table of the row to fetch, along with whatever columns and where-clauses are needed in order to accomplish the task specifically. Once the parameters have been submitted one or two loops are invoked which dynamically form the query. public function fetch( $table, $columns, $whereArgs )
    {
        if ( $whereArgs === NULL && $columns === NULL ) return false;

        $select = "SELECT ";
        $where  = " WHERE ";

        $iQuery = 0;

        $sqlParams = array();

        $columnCount = count( $columns ) - 1;

        foreach( $whereArgs as $key => $value )
        {
            $paramKey = sprintf( ':%s', $key );

            $where .= sprintf( "`%s`= %s", $key, $paramKey );

            $sqlParams[ "{$paramKey}" ] = sprintf( "%s", $value );

            if ( $iQuery <= $columnCount )
            {
                $select .= sprintf( '`%s`', $columns[ $iQuery ] );  
                $select .= ', ';
            }
            else 
            {
                $select .= ' '; 
            }

            ++$iQuery;
        }

        if ( $iQuery <= $columnCount )
        {
            for( ; $iQuery < $columnCount; ++$iQuery )
            {
                if ( $iQuery < $columnCount )
                {
                    $select .= sprintf( '`%s`', $columns[ $iQuery ] );  
                    $select .= ', ';
                }
                else 
                {

                }
            }
        }

        $select .= sprintf( "FROM `%s`", $table );

        $query = $select . $where;

        return $this->doQuery( $query, $sqlParams, TRUE, QueryType::Row );
    }
 Exhibit B: doQuery( $query, $sqlParams, $return = FALSE, $queryType = QueryType::None ) This function is relatively simple: all it does is bind values and execute the statement, while promptly checking for which type to return (the return types, which are either 'row', 'column', or 'all', are specified by the class QueryType, a class which outside the scope of this issue), and then returning whatever is asked for. protected function doQuery( $query, $sqlParams, $return = FALSE, $queryType = QueryType::None )
    {
        $statement = $this->mConnection->prepare( $query );

        foreach( $sqlParams as $param => $value )
        {
            $statement->bindValue( $param, $value );
        }

        $statement->execute( );

        if ( $return )
        {
            switch( $queryType )
            {
                case QueryType::Row:
                    return $statement->fetch( );
                case QueryType::Column:
                    return $statement->fetchColumn( );
                case QueryType::All:
                    return $statement->fetchAll( );
                case QueryType::None:
                    return $statement;
                default:
                    return false;   
            }
        }

    }
 Exhibit C: test.php This is simply a little test script I wrote to test the database. $database = new Database( 'evolve_admin' );

$res = $database->fetch(
    'evol_users', 
    array( 'user.id', 'user.email', 'user.firstname' ),

);

 Other Comments I've learned that there is something wrong with my code, I'm just lost as to what exactly it could be. As far as my debugging skills go, I have researched this issue quite a bit, and it seems that this error is very common. My main goal is to get this wrapper working, and if anyone sees any faults within the code itself (including ones which outside the scope of this issue in particular), please let me know. To anyone who offers a hand in this one: thank you very much.

@CONTENT:How would you go about doing a bit shift in NASM on a register? I read the manual and it only seems to mention these operators >>, <<. When I try to use them NASM complains about the shift operator working on scalar values. Can you explain what a scalar value is and give an example of how to use >> and <<. Also, I thought there were a shr or shl operators. If they do exist can you give an example of how to use them? Thank you for your time.

@TITLE:Links and text in listview item
@CONTENT:I like to recreate the behaviour of the textview containing the message of a user in the g+-app in my android project. To be exact: - on click on a link the link is visually selected (blue selector) and will open up in the browser - on click on normal text the whole list item is selected The main problem I have, is, that every approach I tried to make links clickable (via xml and autolink=web, or in code) ends up, that the link opens up in a browser on click, but when I touch normal text in this textview the item is not selected (no selector is visible). I read many threads about this issue, but all the solutions, like add setFocusable(false), etc. doesn't work for me. So I want to ask, if there is any tutorial, how to or example, where I can see how this things work, or do you have any idea how I can get it to work? Thanks! :)

@TITLE:Django formset cleaned_data empty when submitted form unchanged
@CONTENT:I 've been experiencing a weird problem, regarding django 1.4 and formsets: when the submitted data is unchanged, the cleaned_data field of the formset is empty, even if the formset itself passes the validation. Here is an example: forms.py: class NameForm(forms.Form):
    name = forms.CharField(required=False, initial='Foo')
 views.py: def welcome(request):

    Formset = formset_factory(NameForm, extra=1)

    else:
        formset = Formset()
    return render_to_response('template.html', locals())
 Although formset is valid, and it actually contains data, line 3 prints a list of an empty dictionary, unless I 've actually changed the initial value in the field. This seems weird to me, but I 'm probably doing something wrong? Any help?

@LINK:/questions/9952688/unwanted-control-characters-displaying-in-vimscript-function-output
@TITLE:Unwanted control characters displaying in vimscript function output
@CONTENT:[using MacVim 7.3 on OS X Lion] I have a vimscript function which runs an external command. It's executing correctly, but the output displays (unwanted) control characters, such as [0m, [33m, [36m, and -1H. The relevant line in the vimscript function is: exec ":!bundle exec rspec --color " . a:filename
 Which produces: :!bundle exec rspec --color spec/acceptance/user_logs_in.feature
[33m*[0m

Pending:
[33m  User logs in [0m
[36m    # the step 'the user "foo@test.host" exists' is not implemented[0m
[36m    # [0m

Finished in 0.07121 seconds
[33m1 example, 0 failures, 1 pending[0m
 Here's what the same command and output look like from the terminal, which is how I want it to display in vim: $ bundle exec rspec --color spec/acceptance/user_logs_in.feature
*

Pending:
  User logs in
    # the step 'the user "foo@test.host" exists' is not implemented
    #

Finished in 0.1161 seconds
1 example, 0 failures, 1 pending
 Also, any time I execute and external command, vim displays -1H immediately after it. For example, if I type: :ls<return>
 I see: :ls-1H
<rest of the output is as expected>
 Any ideas on hiding those control characters and -1H. (disclaimer: I'm very new to vim so please don't assume too much background knowledge on my part.) Thanks. Update 3/31/2012 @ 17:32 PM Sam Goldman's correct: MacVim doesn't know how to display colors, so it outputs the color codes. I've switched to terminal vim (which supports colors, at least with iTerm), but using the version of vim that comes with MacVim, which is more up-to-date and is compiled with ruby support (among other things). The easiest way to do that is: brew install macvim --override-system-vim

@TITLE:How to avoid circular dependencies when setting Properties?
@CONTENT:This is a design principle question for classes dealing with mathematical/physical equations where the user is allowed to set any parameter upon which the remaining are being calculated. In this example I would like to be able to let the frequency be set as well while avoiding circular dependencies. For example: from traits.api import HasTraits, Float, Property
from scipy.constants import c, h
class Photon(HasTraits):
    wavelength = Float # would like to do Property, but that would be circular?
    frequency = Property(depends_on = 'wavelength')
    energy = Property(depends_on = ['wavelength, frequency'])
    def _get_frequency(self):
        return c/self.wavelength
    def _get_energy(self):
        return h*self.frequency
 I'm also aware of an update trigger timing problem here, because I don't know the sequence the updates will be triggered: Wavelength is being changed That triggers an updated of both dependent entities: frequency and energy But energy needs frequency to be updated so that energy has the value fitting to the new wavelength! (The answer to be accepted should also address this potential timing problem.) So, what' the best design pattern to get around these inter-dependent problems? At the end I want the user to be able to update either wavelength or frequency and frequency/wavelength and energy shall be updated accordingly. This kind of problems of course do arise in basically all classes that try to deal with equations. Let the competition begin! ;)
@CODE:from traits.api import HasTraits, Float, Property
from scipy.constants import c, h
class Photon(HasTraits):
    wavelength = Float # would like to do Property, but that would be circular?
    frequency = Property(depends_on = 'wavelength')
    energy = Property(depends_on = ['wavelength, frequency'])
    def _get_frequency(self):

@TITLE:ExpandableListView with RadioButtons. Select Value For One RadioGroup, Several More Get Selected When Group Expands
@CONTENT:I am replicating an inspection form for a piece of equipment in an android app. There is an ExpandableListView where group data consists of the different systems of the machine and child data contains the checklist of items with a RadioGroup for the technician to indicate the pass/fail status of the item. All works great except when selecting a value for a RadioButton in one child, it selects a value for the same RadioButton in other groups. So if I had: Group 1
  Question 1
    Passed
    Failed
    Corrected
    NA
  Question 2
    Passed
    Failed
    Corrected
    NA
Group 2
  Question 1
    Passed
    Failed
    Corrected
    NA
  Question 2
    Passed
    Failed
    Corrected
    NA
 If I select Passed in both questions in Group 1, without ever having gone into group 2, when expanded, 1 or both of the RadioGroups there will have Passed selected also. The layout I am using to create the child group with the RadioGroup looks like <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

I have about 12 views and it will only do it on the first one, but then I delete that file completely and it then adds them to the next view. I've tried recreating the views and but the first one with the generated file still fails. I then set the build option to none, cleaned, rebuilt, and back to page, and it still happens! I've tried deleting the actual generated files in the obj folder but they just get created again and the first view in my list then screws up again. Any way around this? I think I've exhausted my options other then recreating the project but I'd prefer not to do this. Any other way to fix the generated files? Cheers.

@TITLE:Chrome is eating my first inner <form> X why?
@CONTENT:Thanks to ASP.NET I get to learn the intracacies of getting away with <form> tags inside <form> tags. I set up what I thought was a simple DOM that isn't working: <form id="Superform" action="javascript: return false;">
<form id="Subform1" action="javascript: return false;">
    form1
</form>
<form id="Subform2" action="javascript: return false;">
    form2
</form>
</form>
 In this example, IE8 seems to work normally, but Chrome (18.0.1025.142 beta-m) seems to make Subform1 disappear. Does anyone know why? Is this a Chrome/webkit bug? I made a jsFiddle to test it - if you have other browsers handy, I'm curious of those results too. Try the example at http://jsfiddle.net/weQmk/9/. In IE8 I get: Forms my browser sees: 
Superform
Subform1
Subform2
 But in Chrome: Forms my browser sees:
Superform
Subform2
@CODE:<form id="Superform" action="javascript: return false;">
<form id="Subform1" action="javascript: return false;">
    form1
</form>
<form id="Subform2" action="javascript: return false;">

@CONTENT:In a Django view I am generating a data set something like this: data = [22, 23, 18, 19, 21, None, 22, 20]
 I am passing this data to a JavaScript variable using: data_json = simplejson.dumps(data)
 For use in a High Charts script. Unfortunately JavaScript is stumbling when it encounters the None value because actually what I need is null. How can I best replace None with null, and where should I handle this - in the Django View or in the JavaScript?

@TITLE:Android: App Widget Configuration Activity does not behave like Activity (Edited from: Android: AppWidget not embedding into home screen)
@CONTENT:(Edit here - Original post below) I have narrowed the original problem to this: the home key simply doesn't behave the same for a regular activity and an appwidget configuration activity. I made a test with the following minimal activity: public class TestActivity extends Activity {    
  Logger logger = Logger.getLogger("logger");   
  @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { 
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
  }
  @Override
  protected void onUserLeaveHint() {
    logger.info("userleave");
    super.onUserLeaveHint();
  }
}
 Creating a simple app with this simple activity works as intended. Creating the simplest possible widget with no functionality at all, using this activity as an App Widget Configuration Activity, the LogCat doesn't get our logger.info(). Any clues? Best regards (Original post here) I have a working widget consisting of buttons launching activities. One of these is a configuration activity, and it would be fitting to double as an "App Widget Configuration Activity" - i.e. call it when the user embeds the widget into their home screen. Following the Android dev guide, I added this code to the settings activity: Intent intent = getIntent();
    Bundle extras = intent.getExtras();
    if (extras != null) {
        int appWidgetId = extras.getInt(AppWidgetManager.EXTRA_APPWIDGET_ID, AppWidgetManager.INVALID_APPWIDGET_ID);
        if (appWidgetId != AppWidgetManager.INVALID_APPWIDGET_ID) {
            AppWidgetManager appWidgetManager = AppWidgetManager.getInstance(this);
            RemoteViews views = new RemoteViews(this.getPackageName(), R.layout.widgetlayout);
            appWidgetManager.updateAppWidget(appWidgetId, views);
            Intent resultValue = new Intent();
            resultValue.putExtra(AppWidgetManager.EXTRA_APPWIDGET_ID, appWidgetId);
            setResult(RESULT_OK, resultValue);
            finish();
        }
    }
 Added in onCreate(), the activity doesn't appear - quite logical, since it calls finish(), and everything else works as intended. What I want to do, is add it in onPause(), because it's pleasing to quit a configuration activity by using the back or home button, as the absence of a "save & exit" button implies automatic saving. Added in onPause(), the widget doesn't get embedded to the home screen. LogCat doesn't show anything more grievous than info. EDIT: Narrowed to an issue involving onPause() and the hardware home button. The hardware back button, lets the widget gets embed in the Home Screen. If anyone has a hint, I'd be most pleased, thank you in advance.
@CODE:public class TestActivity extends Activity {    
  Logger logger = Logger.getLogger("logger");

    logger.info("userleave");
    super.onUserLeaveHint();

    Bundle extras = intent.getExtras();
    if (extras != null) {
        int appWidgetId = extras.getInt(AppWidgetManager.EXTRA_APPWIDGET_ID, AppWidgetManager.INVALID_APPWIDGET_ID);

@CONTENT:I'm using this CSS:     #main{  
        border-radius: 50px;
        border-bottom-right-radius: 4px;
        border-bottom-left-radius: 4px;

            -moz-border-radius-bottomright: 4px;
            -moz-border-radius-bottomleft: 4px;
    }
 It works perfectly in FF, Chrome, IE9(i think) and Safari... But its soooo ugly in IE8 , There are users using IE8, i have tried the .htc file but that dont support border-bottom-right-radius and border-bottom-left-radius... I'm looking for a JS or HTC file that does support that (or an other solution for this) I only need it for IE8, but its great if it support IE6 and IE7 aswell! Thank you!

@TITLE:IIS Background thread and SignalR
@CONTENT:I need to have a background thread that does some work and sends data to the users connected to the service through SignalR. I thought of hosting this thread inside IIS, and to spawn it when Application_Start is first hit, or in a separate worker process. If I host it in IIS and create it at the start of the application - The thread starts only when the app is first hit. I need it running as soon as I start the service. - I do not have control over this thread via a desktop GUI, I can't stop or pause it in a simple way. If I host it in a separate process, such as a Windows Service - I don't have access to the SignalR service instance - I don't want to connect to the SignalR service as a user to send data to other users. I wanr a different approach to this, one that doesn't imply the worker being a client to SignalR itself. What is your opinnion on this ? Do you see any other solution ?

@TITLE:If Objective C is a strict superset of C, then why doesn't this compile?
@CONTENT:Consider the following source file, which is (at least should be) valid C. void id() {
}
 I am trying to compile it with gcc -c test.m, but I get the following error: test.m:1: error: id redeclared as different kind of symbol
<built-in>:0: error: previous declaration of id was here 
 If Obj-C were a strict superset, wouldn't it mean that all valid C programs also valid Obj-C programs? Note that I am not #importing anything, nor am I linking. Granted, maybe LLVM(1) is doing something magical by default, or maybe this is a bug in it. (1): i686-apple-darwin11-llvm-gcc-4.2 (GCC) 4.2.1 (Based on Apple Inc. build 5658) (LLVM build 2336.1.00) EDIT: Let me clarify this question - the question is not about the id part, I know it has special meaning. My point is that it is commonly said that Obj-C is a strict superset of C. However, this can't be the case if it has keywords that conflict with valid C programs. So either id is not reserved by the compiler, or Obj-C is not a strict superset. The point of this question is to ask which is the case, or is there something obvious I am missing.

@LINK:/questions/9940643/benefit-of-passing-an-int-by-reference-vs-by-value
@TITLE:Benefit of passing an int by reference vs by value?
@CONTENT:Is there a performance benefit by passing ints by reference rather than by value ? I say this because if you pass by reference you are creating a 4-byte pointer but if you pass by value you are creating a 4-byte copy of the value anyway. So they both occupy an extra 4-bytes, right ? Is it possible to pass an int literal by reference using a cast: (int *) ? Or do you have to pass a pointer to an int ? See example code below: int func1(int *a){
    (*a)++; // edited from comment by Joachim Pileborg
    printf("%i\n", *a);
    return 0;
}

int func2(int a){
    a++;
    printf("%i\n", a);
    return 0;
}

int main(void){
    func1(&(int *)5); // an int literal passed by reference using a cast ?
    func2(5);
    return 0;
}
@CODE:int func1(int *a){
    (*a)++; // edited from comment by Joachim Pileborg
    printf("%i\n", *a);
    return 0;
}

int func2(int a){
    a++;
    printf("%i\n", a);
    return 0;

@CONTENT:I am building a website that shows recommend pages for users. Users only click next button to look at different recommend web pages. I wanna check every single activities that users can make. So, I will check page views that users actually see. 1. there is a 'user_pageview' column for each users.
2. the numbers will increase every time if users click next button.
 I can send a query to update data every single time. However, I believe this step will be annoying to my server. So, I am thinking to save the data into session for a while and save it later. What do you think?

LEFT JOIN table3 ON (...) 
WHERE table1.column = something...
 (I dont know if the syntax is 100% correct, but i guess that you understand it anyway) Is there any risk that not all rows that should be deleted doesnt get deleted? Thanks!

@CONTENT:I am new to Android and just started working with Android 4.0.3. which enables USB Host connection. I'm trying to send some signal via USB to a camera, let's say it is supposed to be some characters that the camera has to receive and e.g. start recording. I wanted to do it via controlTransfer(), but I am unable to understand what each part of the logic of this method means. I've checked many fora, but everywhere I see it people keep refering to it as if it was obvious. What is the request ID, value and index? Or maybe there is some other approach to the problem that I don't know. I know for sure that you can send a signal via USB from Linux terminal to that camera and as android has a linux kernel so maybe the way to go would be to start a terminal and do it the Linux way? Thanks for any tips :)

@TITLE:MySQL Query performance help, many of the same table being joined
@CONTENT:I am writing a PHP script that creates an SQL query. This script and database is for the Joomla CMS, and specifically it's querying the SOBIPro component's tables (to use the data entered there in this component). However, due to the way that the SOBI Pro tables are handled, with each instance of a field being its own row in a table, this means including a separate instance of the table for every field I want to pull back. This doesn't seem very efficient, and in fact in this one search it times out.

    contact_fn.baseData AS contact_fn_data ,contact_ln.baseData AS contact_ln_data ,position.baseData AS position_data,

 It seems to work decently fast as long as the municip.baseData search isn't involved, in which case it flops even at 15 entries in the directory. There has to be a better way to get this SQL code designed, while still bringing back all of the fields needed. This query is called via AJAX, and eventually there will be 2000+ entries in the directory.

@TITLE:Extended BackusVNaur Form order of operations
@CONTENT:I am creating a formal spec for a very simple rule language, very simple. I want to use EBNF as this is a standard but I can't figure out how to specify order of operations. Here is the specification so far. rule = statement, { (AND|OR), statement};

variable = $,alphabetic character, {alphabetic character | digit};

statement = variable, [ count,[white space ],>,[white space],number ];

alphabetic character = "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F" | "G"
                     | "H" | "I" | "J" | "K" | "L" | "M" | "N"
                     | "O" | "P" | "Q" | "R" | "S" | "T" | "U"
                     | "V" | "W" | "X" | "Y" | "Z" ;

number = [ "-" ] , digit , { digit } ;

digit = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9" ;

white space = ? white space characters ? ; 
 The question I have is how do I show that things in brackets should be evaluated first. So something like this $strap AND ($greenSticker count > 5 OR ($greenSticker AND $redSticker))
 It seems like a common feature to most languages, but my Google skills are failing me and I can't seem to find an example.
@CODE:rule = statement, { (AND|OR), statement};

variable = $,alphabetic character, {alphabetic character | digit};

statement = variable, [ count,[white space ],>,[white space],number ];

alphabetic character = "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F" | "G"
                     | "H" | "I" | "J" | "K" | "L" | "M" | "N"
                     | "O" | "P" | "Q" | "R" | "S" | "T" | "U"
                     | "V" | "W" | "X" | "Y" | "Z" ;

number = [ "-" ] , digit , { digit } ;

digit = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9" ;

white space = ? white space characters ? ; $strap AND ($greenSticker count > 5 OR ($greenSticker AND $redSticker))

@TITLE:Outlook strips URL hash from email
@CONTENT:Our app generates an email that includes a link with a hash fragment. When an Outlook 2010 user clicks the HTML link (within the <a> tag), the URL is opened but mysteriously excludes the hash fragment. If the user clicks the plain URL (that Outlook converts to a clickable link), the full URL opens correctly. Here is the relevant code from our Rails app, if that helps: mail(from: @message.from, to: @message.to, cc: @message.cc, bcc: @message.bcc, subject: @message.subject) do |format|
  format.html { render text: @message.body_text }
end
 Email message (truncated; using Twitter URLs in place of our app URLs, which follow a similar pattern): Subject: Hello

 It keeps saying: No enclosing instance of type AddBoardTestCommand.BoardTestBean is accessible.

It is meant to just hold the values for several subclasses (SAT is not the only subclass. I just omitted the others for simplicity). Can anyone tell me what's wrong? Thanks.

@TITLE:Fast Pythonic way to turn many lists of strings into lists of floats while catching ValueErrors
@CONTENT:I have about 50 million lists of strings in Python like this one: ["1", "1.0", "", "foobar", "3.0", ...]
 And I need to turn these into a list of floats and Nones like this one: [1.0, 1.0, None, None, 3.0, ...]
 Currently I use some code like: def to_float_or_None(x):
    try:
        return float(x)
    except ValueError:
        return None

result = []
for record in database:
    result.append(map(to_float_or_None, record))
 The to_float_or_None function is taking in total about 750 seconds (according to cProfile)... Is there a faster way to perform this conversion from a list of strings to a list of floats/Nones? Update I had identified the to_float_or_None function as the main bottleneck. I can not find a significant difference in speed between using map and using list comprehensions. I applied Paulo Scardine's tip to check the input, and it already saves 1/4 of the time. def to_float_or_None(x):
    if not(x and x[0] in "0123456789."):
        return None
    try:
        return float(x)
    except:
        return None
 The use of generators was new to me, so thank you for the tip Cpfohl and Lattyware! This indeed speeds up the reading of the file even more, but I was hoping to save some memory by converting the strings to floats/Nones.

@CONTENT:I have this very unpeculiar exception.The thing is have i have this app that has a button to start  InputMethodService
 that starts like this public class MyGroovyIme extends InputMethodService {
 and this is how it looks in manifest.   <service

            android:name="android.view.im"

 the whole setup works like a charm when i do it on Tablet(Moto XOOM ,its 3.2) but when I do it on Devices that run on 2.2 and 2.1(i havent tried it on 2.3 and cant use emulator either) this is what i get  java.lang.SecurityException: Not allowed to start service Intent { cmp=com.spp.ime.demo/.MyGroovyIme } without permission android.permission.BIND_INPUT_METHOD

@CONTENT:I have a huge Excel spreadsheet that contains records of Customers where each column is a field. There's a field called Demographics which contains survey results of Customers and it's entirely in XML format. That is each Customer has a survey result on their demographic info like Gender, Marital Status, Income, Age, etc. which is given in XML format. It is notable that the whole XML is like a big chunk of text in a cell of the spreadsheet which I can't use to analyze the data. The problem is now I want to extract the demographic data of each Customer and present it as fields in the same spreadsheet, i.e., each Customer has an Age, Gender, etc. How can I do this?

@LINK:/questions/6162484/why-does-modern-perl-avoid-utf-8-by-default
@TITLE:Why does modern Perl avoid UTF-8 by default?
@CONTENT:I wonder why most modern solutions built using Perl don't enable UTF-8 by default. I understand there are many legacy problems for core Perl scripts, where it may break things. But, from my point of view, in the 21st century, big new projects (or projects with a big perspective) should make their software UTF-8 proof from scratch. Still I don't see it happening. For example, Moose enables strict and warnings, but not Unicode. Modern::Perl reduces boilerplate too, but no UTF-8 handling. Why? Are there some reasons to avoid UTF-8 in modern Perl projects in the year 2011? Commenting @tchrist got too long, so I'm adding it here. It seems that I did not make myself clear. Let me try to add some things. tchrist and I see situation pretty similarly, but our conclusions are completely in opposite ends. I agree, the situation with Unicode is complicated, but this is why we (Perl users and coders) need some layer (or pragma) which makes UTF-8 handling as easy as it must be nowadays. tchrist pointed so many aspects to cover, I will read and think about them for days or even weeks. Still, this is not my point. tchrist tries to prove that there is not one single way "to enable UTF-8". I have not so much knowledge to argue with that. So, I stick to live examples. I played around with Rakudo and UTF-8 was just there as I needed. I didn't have any problems, it just worked. Maybe there are some limitation somewhere deeper, but at start, all I tested worked as I expected. Shouldn't that be a goal in modern Perl?5 too? I stress it more: I'm not suggesting UTF-8 as the default character set for core Perl, I suggest the possibility to trigger it with a snap for those who develop new projects. Another example, but with a more negative tone. Frameworks should make development easier. Some years ago, I tried web frameworks, but just threw them away because "enabling UTF-8" was so obscure. I did not find how and where to hook Unicode support. It was so time-consuming that I found it easier to go the old way. Now I saw here there was a bounty to deal with the same problem with Mason 2: How to make Mason2 UTF-8 clean?. So, it is pretty new framework, but using it with UTF-8 needs deep knowledge of its internals. It is like a big red sign: STOP, don't use me! I really like Perl. But dealing with Unicode is painful. I still find myself running against walls. Some way tchrist is right and answers my questions: new projects don't attract UTF-8 because it is too complicated in Perl?5.

The error is introduced when I add the (p+=param) syntax required for list processing in the StringTemplate library.

@TITLE:Can I achieve a 'copy constructor' in C# that copies from a derived class?
@CONTENT:An application specific example to illustrate my immediate problem: I have a metadata provider class with the following (abridged) interface: public class CtsDataAnnotationsModelMetadataProvider : DataAnnotationsModelMetadataProvider

    protected override ModelMetadata CreateMetadata(IEnumerable<Attribute> attributes, Type containerType, Func<object> modelAccessor, Type modelType, string propertyName)

        return metadata;

}
 Now I would like to extend ModelMetadata with additional properties, populate these and return and instance of ExtendedModelMetadata. How can I nicely convey properties assigned to the metadata instance by base.CreateMetadata in my extended instance? What I would like but don't have is; var metadata = (ExtendedModelMetadata)base.CreateMetadata(attributes, containerType, modelAccessor, modelType, propertyName);
 I can create a constructor for ExtendedModelMetadata that takes a ModelMetadata parameter and explicitly assigns all of it's properties to the instance being constructed, but I would like a more generic and less hard-coded approach for this. What can I do?

@CONTENT:I want my program to do something when it finds the end of a file (EOF) at the end of the last line of text, and something else when the EOF is at the empty line AFTER that last line of text. Unfortunately, BufferedReader seems to consider both cases equal. For example, this is my code to read the lines to the end of the file: FileReader fr = new FileReader("file.txt");
BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);
String line;

while((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
    if (line.equals("")) {

 If file.txt contained this, it wouldn't print: line of text 1
another line 2//cursor
 This wouldn't print either: line of text 1
another line 2
//cursor
 However, this will: line of text 1
another line 2

 I am having a difficulty in creating the SQL query for this. Assuming, the date today is 2012-05-16 and the time is 07:00:00. I want to get all the accounts which is today and less than the current time. For instance, the only valid account (based on the current date and time I indicated) I need is account 1-69010235. Also, any tips if on what interval should I set my cron to run?

@TITLE:How do we call a virtual method from another method in the base class even when the current instance is of a derived-class?
@CONTENT:How do we call a virtual method from another method in the base class even when the current instance is of a derived-class? I know we can call Method2 in the Base class from a method in the Derived class by using base.Method2() but what I want to do is calling it from the other virtual method in the Base class. Is it possible? using System;

namespace ConsoleApplication1
{
  class Program
  {
    static void Main( string[] args )
    {
      Base b = new Derived(  );
      b.Method1(  );
    }
  }


  public class Base
  {
    public virtual void Method1()
    {
      Console.WriteLine("Method1 in Base class.");
      this.Method2( );   // I want this line to always call Method2 in Base class, even if the current instance is a Derived object.
      // I want 'this' here to always refer to the Base class. Is it possible?
    }

    public virtual void Method2()
    {
      Console.WriteLine( "Method2 in Base class." );
    }
  }

  public class Derived : Base
  {
    public override void Method1()
    {
      Console.WriteLine( "Method1 in Derived class." );
      base.Method1();
    }

    public override void Method2()
    {
      Console.WriteLine( "Method2 in Derived class." );
    }
  }

}
 With the above codes, it will output: Method1 in Derived class.
Method1 in Base class.
Method2 in Derived class.
 while what I would expect is: Method1 in Derived class.
Method1 in Base class.
Method2 in Base class.
@CODE:using System;

namespace ConsoleApplication1
{
  class Program
  {
    static void Main( string[] args )
    {
      Base b = new Derived(  );
      b.Method1(  );
    }
  }


  public class Base
  {
    public virtual void Method1()
    {
      Console.WriteLine("Method1 in Base class.");
      this.Method2( );   // I want this line to always call Method2 in Base class, even if the current instance is a Derived object.
      // I want 'this' here to always refer to the Base class. Is it possible?
    }

    public virtual void Method2()
    {
      Console.WriteLine( "Method2 in Base class." );
    }
  }

  public class Derived : Base
  {
    public override void Method1()
    {

      base.Method1();
    }

    public override void Method2()
    {
      Console.WriteLine( "Method2 in Derived class." );
    }
  }

} Method1 in Derived class.
Method1 in Base class.
Method2 in Derived class. Method1 in Derived class.
Method1 in Base class.
Method2 in Base class.

@TITLE:How to force removing of an app from an iDevice
@CONTENT:I distribute my apps for beta testing using TestFlight. A customer has an iPhone 4 running iOS5.1, and cannot delete an app from the home screen. The app was installed OTA via TestFlight. The app icon has an empty progress bar on it, and when tapped the app does not run. Solutions tried: Press and hold app icon. When it is jiggling, press x. Press delete in alert view. App does not delete. The app is still jiggling, but now with no x. Tried installing the app by USB using build and debug from XCode - the app runs, but once the app is stopped the app still cannot be deleted. Open organizer, select app and press delete - nothing happens. In iOS settings, General > Usage, find app and press Delete. Still does not delete. Restarted device. Did not help. Note that TestFlight lists the app as installed for that user. Short of jailbreaking the device are there any other ways to force the removal of an app? Has anyone had this problem before?

@LINK:/questions/9919146/database-best-practices-status
@TITLE:Database best practices - Status
@CONTENT:I'm creating an application in which objects have a status lookup. To give some context, let's use the following example. A helpdesk application where jobs are created and move through the following workflow: New - Job created but unassigned In Progress - Job assigned to a worker and in progress Complete - Job complete ready for invoicing Closed - Job invoiced So, i create a status table with the following details: int ID string Name and a lookup column on the jobs table int ID string Name int CustomerID int StatusID -> looks up the status So in the real world, let's say we have the following requirements. Users need to get a report to show all incomplete jobs (jobs which are either New or InProgress) Down the line, someone will want to add a new status that sits in the middle of completed and closed for example. So with this in mind, my initial thoughts are to create a new column on the Status table called SortOrder or similar and assign numbers to it such as New - 10 In Progress - 20 Completed - 30 Closed - 40 This would mean that for Case #1 above, I could simply query the database for all jobs whose status is greater than or equal to 30. This would also be great for case #2 because it means that if i introduced a new status in between completed and closed it would not break this report. I can see that it would come up often in different applications. Has anyone implemented a solution like this or come across this problem before?

}
 As well as checking if hs contains an odd number, I want to know what odd number if contains. Obviously I want a method that scales reasonably and does not simply iterate-and-search over the entire collection. Another way to rephrase the question is, I want to replace the line below THIS LINE HERE with something efficient (say O(1), instead of O(n)). Towards what end? I'm trying to intern a laaaaaaaarge number of immutable reference objects similar in size to a Point3D. Seems like using a HashSet<Foo> instead of a Dictionary<Foo,Foo> saves about 10% in memory. No, obviously this isn't a game changer but I figured it would not hurt to try it for a quick win. Apologies if this has offended anybody.

 I have specific properties that I want to be able to extend on a case by case basis. I guess I could have a method called "HairColorUpdate", but seems that HairColor.Update() should be possible. I don't want to use "set" because I don't always want to update the DB this way. The reason I am doing this is because I may only want to call the database to update one column instead of calling my save method which updates every column hopefully improving efficiency.

 i get an error stating that there are multiple version 1 migrations and it fails the migration process. Is there another way to go about this in CI?

@TITLE:asp.net mvc4 won't properly deserialize and bind Dictionary<string,List<CustomType>> from json
@CONTENT:JSON.NET deserializes it fine, but whatever mvc uses for controller parameter binding barfs hard. Can I do anything else to make this work? The bits:   public partial class Question
  {
    public Dictionary<string, List<QuestionExtendedProp>> TemporaryExtendedProperties { get; set; }
  }
 And the controller method [HttpPost]
public JsonResult SaveQuestions(Question[] questions)
{
  var z =
    JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(
      "{'Options':[{'PropKey':'asdfasd','PropVal':'asdfalkj'},{'PropKey':'fdsafdsafasdfas','PropVal':'fdsafdas'}]}",
      typeof (Dictionary<string, List<QuestionExtendedProp>>)) as Dictionary<string, List<QuestionExtendedProp>>;
  //this deserializes perfectly. z is exactly what I want it to be
  //BUT, questions is all wrong. See pic below

  //lots of code snipped for clarity, I only care about the incoming questions object
  return Utility.Save(questions);
}
 Here's what MVC gives me for this exact string (Pulled from fiddler, extras snipped for your reading pleasure)     "TemporaryExtendedProperties":{"Options": 
        [{"PropKey":"NE","PropVal":"NEBRASKA"}, 
         {"PropKey":"CORN","PropVal":"CHILDREN OF"}, 
         {"PropKey":"COW","PropVal":"MOO"}]}
 Why does MVC mangle the binding from this perfectly fine json string and how can I get it to not do so? I have complete control over the json structure and creation. Edit I tried changing the type of Question.TemporaryExtendedProperties to List<KeyValuePair<string, List<QuestionExtendedProp>>>, but that didn't work either. Here's the new json (which matches exactly what System.Web.Script.Serialization.JavaScriptSerializer serializes an object to!) {
   TemporaryExtendedProperties: [
      {
         Key: 'Options',
         Value: [
            {
               PropKey: 'NEBRASKA',
               PropVal: 'NE'
            },
            {
               PropKey: 'DOG',
               PropVal: 'CORN'
            },
            {
               PropKey: 'MEOW???',
               PropVal: 'COW'
            }
         ]
      }
   ]
}
 That didn't work either. It's deserialized by the controller to a List<blah,blah> properly, with a count of 1 (as expected), but the Key and Value are both null. Json.NET again handles it perfectly. Ugh.

@CONTENT:I have a list of a bunch of summaries of dataframes, and I would like to write them all to one file, so I can have a single text file containing the output of calling summary() on each data frame. I tried this:  dflist = lapply(1:4, function(x){df = data.frame(SID=paste("S",1:10,sep=""),matrix(runif(100),nrow=10,ncol=10))})
 sumlist  = lapply(dflist, function(df){summary(df)})

@TITLE:How to add a single colobar that will show the data from 2 different subplot
@CONTENT:What i wanna do is adding a single colorbar (at the right side of the figure shown below), that will show the colorbar for both subplots (they are at the same scale). Another thing doesn't really make sense for me is why the lines I try to draw on the end of the code are not drawn (they are supposed to be horizontal lines on the center of both plots) Thanks for the help. Here are the code:  idx=0
b=plt.psd(dOD[:,idx],Fs=self.fs,NFFT=512)
B=np.zeros((2*len(self.Chan),len(b[0])))
B[idx,:]=20*log10(b[0])

C=np.zeros((2*len(self.Chan),len(b[0])))
C[idx,:]=20*log10(c[0])

    b=plt.psd(dOD[:,idx],Fs=self.fs,NFFT=512)

## Calculate the color scaling for the imshow()    
aux1 = max(max(B[i,:]) for i in range(size(B,0)))
aux2 = min(min(B[i,:]) for i in range(size(B,0)))
bux1 = max(max(C[i,:]) for i in range(size(C,0)))
bux2 = min(min(C[i,:]) for i in range(size(C,0)))
scale1 = 0.75*max(aux1,bux1)
scale2 = 0.75*min(aux2,bux2)


fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=2, ncols=1,figsize=(7,7))#,sharey='True')
fig.subplots_adjust(wspace=0.24, hspace=0.35)

## Set up the xlim to aprox frange Hz
axes[0].set_xlim(left=0,right=ii)

@TITLE:Loading Resources with the Context Loader fails with a NullPointerException
@CONTENT:I'm just wondering why I cannot load a resource with the Thread context loader in Felix OSGi? Am I not supposed to touch the context loader, am I doing something wrong or is it a bug? I've a super simple bundle with a simple Activator: public class Activator implements BundleActivator {
    public void start(BundleContext context) throws Exception {
        System.out.println("Hello World!!");
        String resourcePath = "META-INF/mySuperDuperResource.txt";

        // works
        System.out.println(Activator.class.getClassLoader().getResource(resourcePath));
        // null-pointer exception
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader().getResource(resourcePath));

    }
    public void stop(BundleContext context) throws Exception {
        System.out.println("Goodbye World!!");
    }
}
 Now loading the resource with with the class loader with the Activator.class.getClassLoader works. But not with the Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader(). There I get: ERROR: Bundle info.gamlor.osgi [26] Unable to get module class path. (java.lang.NullPointerException)

@CONTENT:I have a question regarding building GUI applications. I feel like the title of this question is not really accurate but I could not think of a better one. What is the proper way of building the application? Should I just create one JFrame, then change the panels in that JFrame as needed? Or should I always create new JFrame and get rid of the old one when moving from one thing to another? For example, I have the JFrame containing a JPanel that has few text fields and JLabels. User enters username and password, clicks a login button to continue. Should a completely new JFrame appear, or should a new JPanel be created instead, using the old JFrame?

@TITLE:Create a dictionary of non-contradicting items from a list of dictionaries
@CONTENT:This question is inspired by this question. I'd like to get a dictionary from a list of dictionaries that should contain all key/value pairs from all dictionaries that are either only contained once, or where all dictionaries agree on the associated value. Example (taken from the aforementioned posting): dicts = [dict(a=3, b=89, d=2), dict(a=3, b=89, c=99), dict(a=3, b=42, c=33)]
print dict_itersection(dicts)
 should yield {'a': 3, 'd': 2}
 My current implementation looks like this: import collections

def dict_intersection(dicts):
        c=collections.defaultdict(set)
        for d in dicts:
                for a, b in d.iteritems():
                        c[a].add(b)
        return {a: next(iter(b)) for a, b in c.iteritems() if len(b) == 1}
 So my question: Can this be done more elegantly? Sidequestion: can next(iter(b)) be done better without modification of the underlying dictionary (i.e. not b.pop())?
@CODE:dicts = [dict(a=3, b=89, d=2), dict(a=3, b=89, c=99), dict(a=3, b=42, c=33)]
print dict_itersection(dicts) {'a': 3, 'd': 2} import collections

def dict_intersection(dicts):
        c=collections.defaultdict(set)
        for d in dicts:
                for a, b in d.iteritems():
                        c[a].add(b)
        return {a: next(iter(b)) for a, b in c.iteritems() if len(b) == 1} next(iter(b)) b.pop() b.pop() myset[0]

Usually when I add some code I run it for testing and then tab to something else because I not going to watch it being compiled for 2 minuts everytime. Sometimes I get a compile error. I would like to get notified when that happen (the build was interrupted and no website was opened) to safe time. Is it possible to tell VS10 that it can play a little "beep"-sound or focus VS10 window or something, so I can carry on right away? I'm guessing there ain't and maybe I just have to get used to not have the other window in fullscreen.

@TITLE:Return data from jQuery.post AJAX call?
@CONTENT:Hi I'm calling this function: function getCoordenadas()
{
    var coordenadas = new Array();
    $.post(
        '<?=$this->baseUrl('user/parse-kml')?>', 
        { kmlName: "esta_chica.kml"},
        function(jsonCoord) {
            jQuery.each(jsonCoord, function(i, val) {
                var latlng = val.split(',');
                coordenadas.push(new google.maps.LatLng(latlng[0], latlng[1]));
            });
        },
        'json'
    );  
    return coordenadas;
}
 like this: $(document).ready(function(){
    $('.caller').click(function() {
        console.log(getCoordenadas());
    });
});
 So when you click .caller it calls the function gets the data correctly populates the array, but console.log(getCoordenadas()); outputs []. If I move the array declaration (var coordenadas = new Array();) from the function scope to make it global, when I click .caller for the first time console.log(getCoordenadas()); outputs [], but the second time it outputs the array correctly. Any ideas? Thanks in advance
@CODE:function getCoordenadas()
{
    var coordenadas = new Array();

 I'm using Mockito to mock an EventListener and want to do an equality on the event object (e.g. event.getTime()..event.getMessage() etc). The event object doesnt have an equals method so I cant easily create another object and do an assert. Whats the normal way of doing this with Mockito?

 What is a correct way of binding target object to aspect? The only way I've found is binding JoinPoint, but it suggests following: Unless you specifically need this reflective access, you should use the target pointcut designator to get at this object for better static typing and performance Does anyone one how to do this?

@TITLE:Prevent `mouseMovedEvent` callback from processing the movement? Or globally hide cursor momentarily?
@CONTENT:I have a global app that prevents the mouse from moving into areas of the screen. Must work with all apps, while my app in the background, etc. I have set up a CGEventTap hook that has a callback for mouse movements. The user's mouse movement continues to pass through the hook, no matter how I attempt to modify/kill the movement. That mirrors the experiences of others: http://stackoverflow.com/a/5831573/106761 - (CGEventRef) mouseMovedEvent:(CGEventRef) newUserMouseMovement
{ 
    //Attempt to modify the mouse movement
    CGEventSetDoubleValueField(newUserMouseMovement, kCGMouseEventDeltaX, 0);
    CGEventSetDoubleValueField(newUserMouseMovement, kCGMouseEventDeltaY, 0);
    CGEventSetDoubleValueField(newUserMouseMovement, kCGMouseEventDeltaX, 0.0);

    //Attempt to kill the event
    return NULL;
}
//Mouse movement still works normally.
 I am able to use CGDisplayMoveCursorToPoint or CGWarpMouseCursorPosition to reposition the cursor back to the original position. This works fine, although I would rather just kill the event altogether. The problem is that the original user mouse movement shows the cursor visual at that point for a split second, before I am able to move the cursor. I'm using: CGSetLocalEventsSuppressionInterval(0.0);
 to increase the frequency at which the Mouse movement fires. But that also makes the "real" cursor, before I move it, flash in the "forbidden area" if the user holds the mouse against the area in which I don't want the mouse to go. I will potentially use: Globally hiding cursor (from background app) but I doubt that would be Mac App Store legal. Any ideas? EDIT: How I create the event tap: eventTap = CGEventTapCreate(kCGHIDEventTap, kCGHeadInsertEventTap, kCGEventTapOptionDefault, kCGEventMaskForAllEvents, myCGEventCallback, NULL);
 ...     CGEventRef myCGEventCallback(CGEventTapProxy proxy, CGEventType type, CGEventRef event, void *refcon)

    if (type == kCGEventMouseMoved) {
        event = [refToSelf mouseMovedEvent:event];

@TITLE:PyCrypto: Decrypt only with public key in file (no private+public key)
@CONTENT:Hello everyone. I am trying to play a bit with RSA public and private keys and encryption/decryption with PyCrypto and I have encountered and issue that seems kind of strange to me (it probably makes a lot of sense the way it's working now, but I don't know much about RSA asymmetric encryption and that's why it's puzzling me). It is the inability I have encountered to decrypt something having only the public key. Here's the thing: I have a server and a client. I want the server to "recognize" and register the client and show it in a list of "known devices". The client will have the public key of the server and the server will have the public key of the client, so when the client communicates with the server, it will encrypt its data with his client's private key and with the server's public key. By doing this, only the proper server will be able to open the data (with its private key) and will be able to verify that the sender is actually the client that claims to be... well... or at least, that's what I think, because I'm pretty newbie in this asymmetric encryption. The idea is that when one of those clients wakes up, it will send its public key (encrypted with the server's public key, of course, but that's probably not relevant at this point... yet) saying "Hey, I'm a new client and this is my public key. Register that key with my UUID" and the server will obey, associating that public key with the client's UUID and use that key to decrypt data coming from that client. I just want to transmit the client's public key, keeping its private key secret, secret, secret (it's private, right?) I am doing some tests with openssl and very simple Python scripts that use PyCrypto (actually, not even in a server/client architecture or anything... just trying to encrypt something with a private key and decrypt it with the public key) First of all, I have created a public/private key set with: openssl genrsa -out ~/myTestKey.pem -passout pass:"f00bar" -des3 2048
 Ok, first thing that puzzles me a bit... It generates only one file, with both the private and the public keys... Well... O'right... whatever. I can extract the public key with: openssl rsa -pubout -in ~/myTestKey.pem -passin pass:"f00bar" -out ~/myTestKey.pub
 So I thought I had my couple of private (private+public, actually) and public keys in ~/myTestKey.pem and ~/myTestKey.pub respectively. Well... apparently I'm doing something wrong, because PyCrypto doesn't like this assembly. And I don't know why. I have two very simple test scripts, "encryptor.py" and "decryptor.py". The "encryptor.py" should encrypt something with the private key, and "decryptor.py", decrypt it with the public key. I know... I'm a parangon of originality... So, I encrypt the string "Loren ipsum" with my "encryptor.py" (with private key): ----------- encryptor.py ---------------- #!/usr/bin/python

from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA

def encrypt(message):
    externKey="/home/borrajax/myTestKey.pem"
    privatekey = open(externKey, "r")
    encryptor = RSA.importKey(privatekey, passphrase="f00bar")
    encriptedData=encryptor.encrypt(message, 0)
    file = open("/tmp/cryptThingy.txt", "wb")
    file.write(encriptedData[0])
    file.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    encryptedThingy=encrypt("Loren ipsum")
 And it works fine. Well... I suppose so, because in the file "/tmp/cryptThingy.txt" I get a lot of gibberish. It looks really, really encrypted to me. But when I try to decrypt it using just the file that contains just the public key... ----------- decryptor.py --------------- #!/usr/bin/python

from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA

def decrypt():
    externKey="/home/borrajax/myTestKey.pub"
    publickey = open(externKey, "r")
    decryptor = RSA.importKey(publickey, passphrase="f00bar")
    retval=None

    file = open("/tmp/cryptThingy.txt", "rb")
    retval = decryptor.decrypt(file.read())
    file.close()
    return retval


if __name__ == "__main__":
    decryptedThingy=decrypt()   
    print "Decrypted: %s" % decryptedThingy
 ... PyCrypto yells at me with a:   File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pycrypto-2.5-py2.7-linux-i686.egg/Crypto/PublicKey/RSA.py", line 107, in _decrypt
    mp = self.key._decrypt(cp)
TypeError: Private key not available in this object
 Yeah, of course it's not available! I extracted the public key! It took me 2 hours finding how to do it properly!! What am I missing? As I said, I'm pretty newbie in this public/private asymmetric key encryption so I might have a core "conceptual error"... Any hint will be appreciated. ?Thank you in advance!

@CONTENT:I am trying to host this service below which runs fine yet when I open a new project in a a different visual studio runtime and try to add a web service it cant find anything? Not at the address specified or anything on the local machine? The code below only seems to work when I run it in the same solution? namespace Students

}
 The error I get when I try to add it from a new project (seperate to the current solution) is this: The HTML document does not contain Web service discovery information.
Metadata contains a reference that cannot be resolved: 'http://localhost:8001/'.
There was no endpoint listening at http://localhost:8001/ that could accept the message. This is often caused by an incorrect address or SOAP action. See InnerException, if present, for more details.
The remote server returned an error: (404) Not Found.
If the service is defined in the current solution, try building the solution and adding the service reference again.
 Which when I downloaded this case study (starter project) it had no web or app config files anywhere it just hosted from the console apps. Also note I have the service running when I try to add the web service.

@TITLE:Import SSJS script library using DXL in a database

 The file C:\tempssjslib.xml contains a SSJS library which I created in Domino Designer and then exported using "Tools > DXL Utilities > Exporter" (for testing purpose). But when I run this agent library does not get imported in the database. There is no error in DxlImporter.getLog() also. I tried similar procedure with XPages, Form, LotusScript script library and was successfully able to import them. But the same agent is not able to import SSJS library. Is there something that I have missed in the code? Can we import SSJS library in database using DXL?

Then navigate to the page I need to parse. Since I don't have a 'browser' to parse for controls, I am trying to use various C# .NET classes to get to the page, set the username and password, and click submit, but nothing seems to work. Any examples I can look at, or .NET classes I should be reviewing that were designed for this sort of project? Thanks!

@CONTENT:The goal: run some functions on .ajaxStart() but only if fired by a certain event. The code: $('#loading_indicator').ajaxStart(function() {

The question: How do I make the global event object accessible within this function?

@TITLE:Grails throws a 404 error when canceling a page request with a filter
@CONTENT:I have a filter: class MyFilters {
    def filters = {
        before = {
            render(view: "/test")
            return false
        }
    }
}
 This works great on pages where I'm using a controller to handle the request, showing the contents of test.gsp instead of the page I requested. However, when I try to access a page that maps directly to a GSP file, I get a 404 error. Changing the render to simply render "test" produces the same results, as does commenting it out and just leaving the return false.
@CODE:class MyFilters {
    def filters = {
        before = {
            render(view: "/test")
            return false

@TITLE:Parse Args that aren't declared
@CONTENT:I'm writing a utility for running bash commands that essentially takes as input a string and a list optional argument and uses the optional arguments to interpolate string. I'd like it to work like this: interpolate.py Hello {user_arg} my name is {computer_arg} %% --user_arg=john --computer_arg=hal
 The %% is a separator, it separates the string to be interpolated from the arguments. What follows is the arguments used to interpolate the string. In this case the user has chosen user_arg and computer_arg as arguments. The program can't know in advance which argument names the user will choose. My problem is how to parse the arguments? I can trivially split the input arguments on the separator but I can't figure out how to get optparse to just give the list of optional args as a dictionary, without specifying them in advance. Does anyone know how to do this without writing a lot of regex?

@CONTENT:In my app, I am upgrading from Cocos2D version 1.10->2.0-rc0a. So I did everything the right way as far as I know, the problem I think just has to do with the user header search path. So my Cocos2D files are within a folder within a folder within a folder within a folder, which is on my Desktop. So the actual cocos2D files are 4 folders within until it gets to the desktop. And my user header search path looks like this: "/Users/myname19/Desktop/NewMyAppBeta/MyApp3/MyApp3"
 So the full error is: Lexical or Preprocessor Issue, 'kazmath/kazmath.h' file not found in CCNode.h. There are actually 4 of these issues but they are identical. Does anyone know how to fix this issue? Thanks!

 Using Intellij IDEA 11 Ultimate Edition: I've added the tomcat6 server in the settings -> application servers menu of Intellij IDEA by adding the directory where tomcat is installed, then I went to edit configurations in the run drop-down box, and added the tomcat server local defaults.

Now, when I ran it the first time, it gave me some error like no conf folder found in /home/anthony/.IntelliJIdea11/system/tomcat/Unnamed_guestbook-spring/
 In a moment of desperation I just made a directory called conf there and the error message, sure enough, changed to: Cannot load /home/anthony/.IntelliJIdea11/system/tomcat/Unnamed_guestbook-spring/conf/server.xml

@TITLE:C# UTC DateTime query in WCF/.NET
@CONTENT:This is a very simple, (hopefully) question. I am new to working with DateTime conversion in .NET. I have a WCF service which has a DateTime property - call it BookingDate. Someone passes that to my WCF service in the format: <a:BookingDate>2012-03-26T17:03:00-04:00</a:BookingDate>
 The server that it is sitting on is set to a timezone of UTC (Lisbon, London, Dublin). When I store the corresponding value in the database, it sets the value to be: 2012-03-26 22:03
 I assumed, I think incorrectly that the .NET framework (as part of the WCF serialize/deserialize process) would pop this into a .Net Datetime of UTC for me (as there is the minus offset of 4 hours as above) I was expecting: 2012-03-26 21:03 My question is thus: would I need to call: var date = fromClientWCFService.BookingDate.ToUniversalTime();
 in order to get the 21:03 time that I am expecting? If not, is there a WCF setting to tell my service to convert DateTimes to UTC, rather than the server timezone? Thanks in advance Mark EDIT: From 1 answer, I can see that DateTimeOffset can be used. Following on from this, would the following work: var offset = DateTimeOffset.Parse("2012-03-26T17:03:00-0400"); to return the result: 2012-03-26 21:03
@CODE:<a:BookingDate>2012-03-26T17:03:00-04:00</a:BookingDate> 2012-03-26 22:03 2012-03-26 21:03 var date = fromClientWCFService.BookingDate.ToUniversalTime(); var offset = DateTimeOffset.Parse("2012-03-26T17:03:00-0400"); 2012-03-26 21:03

@TITLE:Call fortran function from Python with ctypes
@CONTENT:I am looking to use ctypes to call some old fortran libraries which were written by my boss a few years ago. I followed the example given in this previous question, and I get the results as expected. However, when I modify the code, to get slightly closer to the situation I face, so that integer function addtwo(a, b)
  integer, intent(in) :: a, b
  addtwo = a + b
end function
 becomes real function addtwo(a, b)
  integer, intent(in) :: a, b
  addtwo = a + b

 i.e., the function is now real, not integer, the value returned is always 0. Can anyone explain what's going on and how I should get around this? (PS. I'm using a 64-bit gfortran compiler on mac os snow leopard) EDIT: The function I'm struggling with looks like: real function ykr(seed)

  integer, intent(in) :: seed
  real ykr0
  ykr= real(seed)
end function
 Really, ykr calls another function, ykr0, recursively, but since I'm struggling even with this basic aspect I'm ignoring that for now. I can't see what's different between this code and the above, but calling ykr_(byref(c_int(4))) returns 0, not 4 as expected...

@TITLE:Remove Unused Resources before shipping
@CONTENT:Question: Does anyone have a quick way for removing all the extra resources in an Android application that are not being used(referenced) in my code? Explanation: I've noticed that once I finally get one of my Android applications ready to ship, there are usually a lot of unwanted resources within my application. I usually have some extra drawables that aren't being used because I switched them out with new ones. I also have extra String resources and even some extra layouts that aren't used anywhere in my application (there is no reference to them in the java code). I want my applications to take up the least amount of space possible on the user's phone.

 There's a very subtle difference between the two. Currently, I am explicitly mentioning both these types in my regex \"*\*
 I am afraid though that in future data I may get a different 'type' of quote on which my regex may fail. How many different types of quotes exist? Is there way to normalize these to just one type so that my regex won't break for unseen data? Edit - My input data consists of HTML files and I am escaping HTML entities and URLs to ASCII escaped_line = HTMLParser.HTMLParser().unescape(urllib.unquote(line.decode('ascii','ignore')))
 where line specifies each line in the HTML file. I need to 'ignore' the ASCII as all files in my database don't have the same encoding and I don't know the encoding prior to reading the file. Edit2 I am unable to do so using replace function. I tried replace('"','') but it doesn't replace the other type of quote ''. If I add it in another replace function it throws me NON-ASCII character error. Condition No external libraries allowed, only native python libraries could be used.

 But I tested it on my iPad(5.1) and the message was different.(The movie is played, too.) Unbalanced calls to begin/end appearance transitions for <MPMoviePlayerViewController: 0xf6a0c40>.
 What's the problem? Here is my code that should play a movie when my button is pressed: -(void)playMovie:(NSString *)fileName   
{
NSString *movieFile = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:fileName ofType:@"mov"];
NSURL *fileURL = [[NSURL alloc] initFileURLWithPath:movieFile];
MPMoviePlayerViewController *tempMoviePlayer = [[MPMoviePlayerViewController alloc] initWithContentURL:fileURL];
MPMoviePlayerController *moviePlayer = [tempMoviePlayer moviePlayer];

[tempMoviePlayer.view setFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, 1024, 768)];
[_zoomImageView addSubview: tempMoviePlayer.view];
[self presentMoviePlayerViewControllerAnimated:tempMoviePlayer]; 
[self setWantsFullScreenLayout:YES]; 
[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(playMovieFinished:) name:MPMoviePlayerPlaybackDidFinishNotification object:moviePlayer];
[moviePlayer play];

[fileURL release];
[tempMoviePlayer release];
}
 plz, help me. thanks a lot.

@TITLE:How to save the selected MKAnnotation?
@CONTENT:I have an app that has a mapview, and it shows 20 pins (from an Array) on the map. When the user clicks on it, it can show a bubble with a right accessory button. Here come my problem: How do I know which pin was pressed? I heard something about the mapView:didSelectAnnotationView method, but I don't really understand how do you get the pin/callout index, so that I can get the information of the object at the same index of my Array? Thanks for any help!

@TITLE:Array of derived type: select entry
@CONTENT:Currently in my code I have a 2D array integer, allocatable :: elements(:,:)
 and define some constants integer, parameter :: TYP = 1
integer, parameter :: WIDTH = 2
integer, parameter :: HEIGHT = 3
! ...
integer, parameter :: NUM_ENTRIES = 10
 and allocate something like allocate(elements(NUM_ENTRIES,10000))
 so I can access elements like write(*,*) elements(WIDTH,100) ! gives the width of the 100th element
 Now I would like to have not only integer but a mixture of types for every element. So I define a derived type type Element
    logical active
    integer type
    real width
    ! etc
end type
 and use an array of Elements type(Element), allocatable :: elements(:)
 With the 2d array version I could call a subroutine telling it which entry to use. E.g. subroutine find_average(entry, avg)
    integer, intent(in) :: entry   
    real, intent(out) :: avg
    integer i, 
    real s

    s = 0
    do i = lbound(elements,1), ubound(elements,1)
        if (elements(TYP,i) .gt. 0) s = s + elements(entry,i)
    end do
    avg = s/(ubound(elements,1)-lbound(elements,1))
end subroutine       
 So I could call find_average(HEIGHT) to find the average height or pass WIDTH to get the average width. (And my subroutines do more advanced things than finding the average height or width, this is just an example.) Question: How can I use different types (as with the derived type) but also reuse my functions to work with different entries (as in the example subroutine)?
@CODE:integer, allocatable :: elements(:,:) integer, parameter :: TYP = 1
integer, parameter :: WIDTH = 2
integer, parameter :: HEIGHT = 3
! ...
integer, parameter :: NUM_ENTRIES = 10 allocate(elements(NUM_ENTRIES,10000)) write(*,*) elements(WIDTH,100) ! gives the width of the 100th element type Element
    logical active
    integer type
    real width
    ! etc
end type type(Element), allocatable :: elements(:) subroutine find_average(entry, avg)
    integer, intent(in) :: entry   
    real, intent(out) :: avg
    integer i, 
    real s

    s = 0
    do i = lbound(elements,1), ubound(elements,1)
        if (elements(TYP,i) .gt. 0) s = s + elements(entry,i)
    end do
    avg = s/(ubound(elements,1)-lbound(elements,1))
end subroutine call find_average(HEIGHT) WIDTH

@TITLE:Migrate data from DB2 to SQL Server - What's needed on DB2 side? [closed]
@CONTENT:I need to move a lot of data from an OLD DB2 server to SQL Server. I'd like to create a linked server using the OLE DB Provider for DB2 on my SQL Server. What I don't know is what is required on the DB2 side. The DB2 server belongs to another organization and most of the people that worked with it have retired. The version is "DB2 for VSE 6.1". Can I connect to that from SQL Server by default? If not, is there optional software that can be installed that will provide connectivity? I believe I need DRDA application server support, but that is all I have been able to find so far. Because of the volume of data, I would prefer not to use intermediate text files if possible. Are there other options that will work with V6.1?

@TITLE:A way to make keyboard event queue both responsive and not take whole CPU power
@CONTENT:I am making an Sdl game, it's 2d shooter. I am using SDL to import surfaces and OpenGL to draw them on the screen (doing so because it works way faster than just SDL). I've got two threads running, one for processing stuff and rendering, and another one for input. Basically, the processing one is taking 1-2% of my CPU, while the input loop takes 25% (on quad-core, so it's 1 full core). I tried doing SDL_Delay(1) before each while (SDL_PollEvent(&keyevent)) and it works! Reduces CPU load to 3% for whole process. However, there's a nasty side effect. The whole program input is handicapped: it doesn't detect all of the key pressed, and for example, to make the character move, it sometimes takes up to 3 seconds of bashing keyboard for it to react. I've also tried solving it by using SDL_PeepEvent() and SDL_WaitEvent(), however, it's causing the same (very long!) delay. Event loop code: void GameWorld::Movement()
{
    SDL_Event keyevent;
    bool x1, x2, y1, y2, z1, z2, z3, m;         // Booleans to determine the
    x1 = x2 = y1 = y2 = z1 = z2 = z3 = m = 0;   // movement direction

Is there a way to know in outlook addin ItemSend event that the mail item has the value set for regarding field? I can get the subject of the email including CRM:xxxxx but since the email is not yet created in CRM I don't know how to pull the regarding data.

@CONTENT:I got this message when doing some javascript programming, and after some google searches, I have no idea what it means, or how i cause this error. I'm including the code below, can someone explain it to me or point me to a resource on how to fix it or what is happening at all? The weird thing is that I have other code just like this part in my program, and it never gives me errors about them, so i'm really confused. Also, I only get this error to display with firebug running, else wise it just doesn't work and no error message is displayed. I also tried it in Chrome, and had the same issues, no error message but the code doesn't work. foundTextFn = function(){
console.log('fire');

 } Here is another of my methods, it is basically the same thing, but it works fine. And if it matters, all of these variables are global variables declared at the start of my file as var foundTextArrayPosition = 0; for example. awayFn = function(){

        if (changeAwayState){

@TITLE:What is better? Querying file system or querying database?
@CONTENT:We have about half a million images residing in the file system. Multiple images belong to a product and named after ProductID. For example, Product ID 10010 has 3 images; 10010_1.jpg, 10010_2.jpg and 10010_3.jpg. To display these 3 images in photo gallery, current code in classic ASP is querying the file system. The code looks something like this: Dim objFSO, i
Set objFSO = Server.CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject") 
i=1
While objFSO.FileExists(Server.MapPath(productid & "_" & i & ".jpg")
    ' draw the image
    i = i + 1
WEnd
 Isn't it better idea to keep the image names in a database table and run a query to get the list of images available for a given product? I am pretty sure that reading it from the database is better. Just reluctant because I need a big table with half million records. Which way is more efficient? My table will look something like this: ID      ProductID   ImageURL
-------------------------------------------
1       10010       10010_1.jpg

@LINK:/questions/9834354/c-design-pattern-multiple-ways-to-load-file
@TITLE:C++ design pattern: multiple ways to load file
@CONTENT:Summary: In search of the standard C++ design pattern for loading different files via constructor I have a Base class with some functionality that will be used by all derived classes (e.g. Derived_A, Derived_B). The principal difference is that Derived_A and Derived_B override the load function, which is used by the constructor to load a data file (load may also be called explicitly outside the constructor). I ran into an unexpected problem from this: the load function called by the constructor treats the class as the Base type, but when I use a default constructor and call the load function explicitly, then the virtual function table permits the intended load function to be called. This smells like a classic problem, but I can't figure out a way to do it (and I was most recently programming in Python, which I believe, due to weak typing, would always call the intended function). In the same vein, I'd really like Base::load to be pure virtual / abstract (only derived classes will be instantiated); however, that won't compile (I believe, because the compiler sees that the pure virtual function will be called). Can you help? Output: Loading w/ constructor: Base::load file_A Base::load file_B Loading w/ function post construction: Derived_A::load file_A Derived_B::load file_B Code: #include <iostream>

I know there is a lot of posts on this topic here but didn't find complete solution 'for dumbs' so I write here what I figured out and please tell me - is this the correct way ?

My main form of the app (frmMain): namespace myNamespace {

public partial class frmMain : Form {

private frmDebug debug;  // frmDebug is declared in other class
                         // we will hold reference to frmDebug form in 'debug'

public frmMain() {         // constructor of the main form 'frmMain'

@TITLE:Localizable assets in Android
@CONTENT:I just found a nice tutorial that will help me implement an easy user guide system in my application, as I will be able to draw it with any plain old HTML editor. My question is simple: since all resources are localizable, I can easily translate my application into new languages. What about assets? Is there an automatic localization mechanism? I don't think so. How do I retrieve system locale in order to construct a localized URL when loading the help page's HTML file? Is there some call to retrieve display size/density the same as coded in the resources world (ie. public String getDensity() returns "xhdpi", "ldpi"...)? Danke ;-)

 Of course kunagi.jar is signed, otherwise it wouldn't even start. It seams Java WebStart enables Java Security globally, which somehow embedded Tomcat "inherits" and fails to initialize. Here is the JNLP file: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

 Is there a way to disable security checks for Tomcat inside of Java WebStart? Or how can I configure embedded Tomcat to permit access to org.apache.catalina...?

@CONTENT:I have a big sparse matrix. I want to take log4 for all element in that sparse matrix. I try to use numpy.log() but it doesn't work with matrices. I can also take logarithm row by row. Then I crush old row with a new one. # Assume A is a sparse matrix (Linked List Format) with float values as data
# It is only for one row

import numpy as np
c = np.log(A.getrow(0)) / numpy.log(4)
A[0, :] = c

@TITLE:How to left join or inner join a table itself
@CONTENT:I have this data in a table, for instance, id      name        parent      parent_id
1       add         self        100
2       manage      null        100

5       add         20          300
6       manage      null        300
 How can I left join or inner join this table itself so I get this result below? id      name        parent
2       manage      self
4       manage      10
6       manage      20
 As you can I that I just want to query the row with the keyword of 'manage' but I want the column parent's data in add's row as the as in manage's row in the result. Is it possible? EDIT: the simplified version of my actual table - system, system_id   parent_id   type    function_name       name        main_parent         make_accessible     sort
31          30          left    main                Main        NULL                0                   1

 my actual query and it is quite messy already... SELECT

@TITLE:Javascript Function to add/remove fields
@CONTENT:I'm not very experienced with JavaScript, but this code was similar to what I was looking for , especially where it includes the 'Remove Field' link. Here is the Javscript function: //Add more fields dynamically.
function addField(field,area,limit) {
    if(!document.getElementById) return; //Prevent older browsers from getting any further.
    var field_area = document.getElementById(area);
    var all_inputs = field_area.getElementsByTagName("input"); //Get all the input fields in the given area.
    //Find the count of the last element of the list. It will be in the format '<field><number>'. If the 
    //      field given in the argument is 'friend_' the last id will be 'friend_4'.
    var last_item = all_inputs.length - 1;
    var last = all_inputs[last_item].id;
    var count = Number(last.split("_")[1]) + 1;

    //If the maximum number of elements have been reached, exit the function.
    //      If the given limit is lower than 0, infinite number of fields can be created.
    if(count > limit && limit > 0) return;

    if(document.createElement) { //W3C Dom method.
        var li = document.createElement("li");
        var input = document.createElement("input");
        input.id = field+count;
        input.name = field+count;
        input.type = "text"; //Type of field - can be any valid input type like text,file,checkbox etc.
        li.appendChild(input);
        field_area.appendChild(li);
    } else { //Older Method
        field_area.innerHTML += "<li><input name='"+(field+count)+"' id='"+(field+count)+"' type='text' /></li>";
    }
}
 Here is the HTML for the form: <form name="frm" method="POST">
<strong>Neutral List</strong><br />
<ol id="neutrals_area">
<li><input type="text" name="neutral_1" id="neutral_1" /> <a style="cursor:pointer;color:blue;" onclick="this.parentNode.parentNode.removeChild(this.parentNode);">Remove Field</a></li>
<li><input type="text" name="neutral_2" id="neutral_2" /> <a style="cursor:pointer;color:blue;" onclick="this.parentNode.parentNode.removeChild(this.parentNode);">Remove Field</a></li>
<li><input type="text" name="neutral_3" id="neutral_3" /> <a style="cursor:pointer;color:blue;" onclick="this.parentNode.parentNode.removeChild(this.parentNode);">Remove Field</a></li>
<li><input type="text" name="neutral_4" id="neutral_4" /> <a style="cursor:pointer;color:blue;" onclick="this.parentNode.parentNode.removeChild(this.parentNode);">Remove Field</a></li>
<li><input type="text" name="neutral_5" id="neutral_5" /> <a style="cursor:pointer;color:blue;" onclick="this.parentNode.parentNode.removeChild(this.parentNode);">Remove Field</a></li>
</ol>
<input type="button" value="Add Neutral Field" onclick="addField('neutrals_area','neutral_',0);" />
</form>
 However, I would like the additional fields to generate with the 'Remove Link' code, not just the ones with code in the script. I understand that the custom functions have to be adjusted to include that behavior, but am having all kinds of trouble trying to get that function to work. It seems straightforward to do it in the older method following the "} else {" at the bottom of the addField function by editing the code to read: } else { //Older Method
    field_area.innerHTML += "<li><input name='"+(field+count)+"' id='"+(field+count)+"' type='text' /><a style="cursor:pointer;color:blue;" onclick="this.parentNode.parentNode.removeChild(this.parentNode);">Remove Field</a></li>";
}
 However, I'm stumped as to how to include it in the W3C DOM method?
@CODE://Add more fields dynamically.
function addField(field,area,limit) {
    if(!document.getElementById) return; //Prevent older browsers from getting any further.
    var field_area = document.getElementById(area);
    var all_inputs = field_area.getElementsByTagName("input"); //Get all the input fields in the given area.
    //Find the count of the last element of the list. It will be in the format '<field><number>'. If the 
    //      field given in the argument is 'friend_' the last id will be 'friend_4'.
    var last_item = all_inputs.length - 1;
    var last = all_inputs[last_item].id;
    var count = Number(last.split("_")[1]) + 1;

    //If the maximum number of elements have been reached, exit the function.
    //      If the given limit is lower than 0, infinite number of fields can be created.
    if(count > limit && limit > 0) return;

    if(document.createElement) { //W3C Dom method.
        var li = document.createElement("li");
        var input = document.createElement("input");
        input.id = field+count;
        input.name = field+count;
        input.type = "text"; //Type of field - can be any valid input type like text,file,checkbox etc.
        li.appendChild(input);
        field_area.appendChild(li);
    } else { //Older Method
        field_area.innerHTML += "<li><input name='"+(field+count)+"' id='"+(field+count)+"' type='text' /></li>";
    }

@TITLE:EWS - how do I find all incomplete tasks?
@CONTENT:I am using Exchange Web Services to try to get a list of all Outlook tasks which are not complete. I have an instance of ExchangeService, and attempt to find all incomplete tasks like this: SearchFilter searchFilter = new SearchFilter.IsNotEqualTo(TaskSchema.Status, TaskStatus.NotStarted);
FindItemsResults<Item> tasks = service.FindItems(WellKnownFolderName.Tasks, searchFilter, view);
 However, on the last line, I get a "ServiceResponseException: The specified value is invalid for property." This seems weird to me because the EWS documentation explicitly states that the Task.Status is supposed to be one of the TaskStatus enumeration values. Creating a SearchFilter which compares against a string value does not cause an exception, but I haven't tried any of the other enumeration options to see whether they give the same behavior.
@CODE:SearchFilter searchFilter = new SearchFilter.IsNotEqualTo(TaskSchema.Status, TaskStatus.NotStarted);
FindItemsResults<Item> tasks = service.FindItems(WellKnownFolderName.Tasks, searchFilter, view);
