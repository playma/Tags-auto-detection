 I believe it says: Find a less-than, then Find (and capture) a-z one or more times, then Find zero or more spaces, then Find any character zero or more times, greedy, except /, then Find a greater-than Do I have that right? And more importantly, what do you think?

@TITLE:How can I prevent SQL-injection in PHP?
@CONTENT:If user input is inserted without modification into an SQL query, then the application becomes vulnerable to SQL injection, like in the following example: $unsafe_variable = $_POST['user_input']; 

mysql_query("INSERT INTO `table` (`column`) VALUES ('$unsafe_variable')");
 That's because the user can input something like value'); DROP TABLE table;--, and the query becomes: INSERT INTO `table` (`column`) VALUES('value'); DROP TABLE table;--')
 What can be done to prevent this from happening?
@CODE:$unsafe_variable = $_POST['user_input']; 

mysql_query("INSERT INTO `table` (`column`) VALUES ('$unsafe_variable')"); value'); DROP TABLE table;-- INSERT INTO `table` (`column`) VALUES('value'); DROP TABLE table;--')

@CONTENT:This question attempts to collect the few pearls among the dozens of bad C++ books that are published every year. Unlike many other programming languages, which are often picked up on the go from tutorials found on the Internet, few are able to quickly pick up C++ without studying a well-written C++ book. It is way too big and complex for doing this. In fact, it is so big and complex, that there are very many very bad C++ books out there. And we are not talking about bad style, but things like sporting glaringly obvious factual errors and promoting abysmally bad programming styles. Please edit the accepted answer to provide quality books and an approximate skill level ¡X preferably after discussing your addition in the C++ chat room. (The regulars might mercilessly undo your work if they disagree with a recommendation.) Add a short blurb/description about each book that you have personally read/benefited from. Feel free to debate quality, headings, etc. Books that meet the criteria will be added to the list. Books that have reviews by the Association of C and C++ Users (ACCU) have links to the review. Note: FAQs and other resources can be found in the C++ tag info and under c++-faq. There is also a similar post for C: The Definitive C Book Guide and List

This is also a Community Wiki, so everyone is invited to participate in adding to and maintaining this list. Why is this? Questions like "Headers already sent" or "Calling a member of a non-object" pop up frequently on Stack?Overflow. The root cause of those questions is always the same. So the answers to those questions typically repeat them and then show the OP which line to change in his/her particular case. These answers do not add any value to the site because they only apply to the OP's particular code. Other users having the same error can not easily read the solution out of it because they are too localized. That is sad, because once you understood the root cause, fixing the error is trivial. Hence, this list tries to explain the solution in a general way to apply. What should I do here? If your question has been marked as a duplicate of this, please find your error message below and apply the fix to your code. The answers usually contain further links to investigate in case it shouldn't be clear from the general answer alone. If you want to contribute, please add your "favorite" error message, warning or notice, one per answer, a short description what it means (even if it is only highlighting terms to their manual page), a possible solution or debugging approach and a listing of existing Q&A that are of value.

@CONTENT:Everyone runs into syntax errors. Even experienced programmers make typos. For newcomers it's just part of the learning process. However, it's often easy to interpret error messages such as:  PHP Parse error: syntax error, unexpected '{' in index.php on line 20
 The unexpected symbol isn't always the real culprit. But the line number gives a rough idea where to start looking. Always look at the code context. The syntax mistake often hides in the mentioned or in previous code lines. Compare your code against syntax examples from the manual. NWhile not every case matches the other. Yet there are some general steps to solve syntax mistakes.

And lastly our php tag-wiki of course. While Stackoverflow is also welcoming rookie coders, it's mostly targetted at professional programming questions. Answering everyones coding mistakes and narrow typos is considered mostly off-topic. So please take the time to follow the basic steps, before posting syntax fixing requests. If you still have to, please show your own solving initiative, attempted fixes, and your thought process on what looks or might be wrong. If your browser displays error messages such as "SyntaxError: illegal character", then it's not actually php-related, but a javascript-syntax error.

@TITLE:Should I avoid the use of set(Preferred|Maximum|Minimum)Size methods in Java Swing?
@CONTENT:Several times I've been criticized for having suggested the use of the following methods: setPreferredSize setMinimumSize setMaximumSize on Swing components. I don't see any alternative to their use when I want to define proportions between displayed components. I have been told this: With layouts the answer is always the same: use a suitable LayoutManager I have searched the web a little bit, but I haven't found any comprehensive analysis of the subject. So I have the following questions: Should I completely avoid the use of those methods? The methods have been defined for a reason. So when should I use them? In which context? For what purposes? What exactly are the negative consequences of using those methods? (I can only think adding portability between systems with different screen resolution). I don't think any LayoutManager can exactly satisfy all desired layout needs. Do I really need to implement a new LayoutManager for every little variation on my layout ? If the answer to 4 is "yes", won't this lead to a proliferation of LayoutManager classes which will become difficult to maintain? In a situation where I need to define proportions between children of a Component (eg, child1 should use 10% of space, child2 40% ,child3 50%), is it possible to achieve that without implementing a custom LayoutManager?

@CONTENT:In templates, where and why do I have to put typename and template on dependent names? What exactly are dependent names anyway? I have the following code: template <typename T, typename Tail> // Tail will be a UnionNode too.
struct UnionNode : public Tail {
    // ...
    template<typename U> struct inUnion {

};
 The problem I have is in the typedef Tail::inUnion<U> dummy line. I'm fairly certain that inUnion is a dependent name, and VC++ is quite right in choking on it. I also know that I should be able to add template somewhere to tell the compiler that inUnion is a template-id. But where exactly? And should it then assume that inUnion is a class template, i.e. inUnion<U> names a type and not a function?

@TITLE:¡§Least Astonishment¡¨ in Python: The Mutable Default Argument
@CONTENT:Anyone tinkering with Python long enough has been bitten (or torn to pieces) by the following issue: def foo(a=[]):
    a.append(5)
    return a
 Python novices would expect this function to always return a list with only one element: [5]. The result is instead very different, and very astonishing (for a novice): >>> foo()
[5]
>>> foo()
[5, 5]
>>> foo()
[5, 5, 5]
>>> foo()
[5, 5, 5, 5]
>>> foo()
 A manager of mine once had his first encountered with this feature, and called it "a dramatic design flaw" of the language. I replied that the behavior had an underlying explanation, and it is indeed very puzzling and unexpected if you don't understand the internals. However, I was not able to answer (to myself) the following question: what is the reason for binding the default argument at function definition, and not at function execution? I doubt the experienced behavior has a practical use (who really used static variables in C, without breeding bugs ?) Edit: Baczek made an interesting example. Together with most of your comments and Utaal's in particular, I elaborated further: >>> def a():
...     print "a executed"
...     return []
... 
>>>            
>>> def b(x=a()):
...     x.append(5)
...     print x
... 
a executed
>>> b()
[5]
>>> b()
[5, 5]
 To me, it seems that the design decision was relative to where to put the scope of parameters: inside the function or "together" with it? Doing the binding inside the function would mean that x is effectively bound to the specified default when the function is called, not defined, something that would present a deep flaw: the def line would be "hybrid" in the sense that part of the binding (of the function object) would happen at definition, and part (assignment of default parameters) at function invocation time. The actual behavior is more consistent: everything of that line gets evaluated when that line is executed, meaning at function definition.
@CODE:def foo(a=[]):
    a.append(5)
    return a [5] >>> foo()
[5]
>>> foo()
[5, 5]
>>> foo()
[5, 5, 5]

@TITLE:Passing Data between View Controllers
@CONTENT:I'm new to iOS and Objective-C and the whole MVC paradigm and I'm stuck with the following. I have a view that acts as a data entry form and I want to give the user the option to select multiple products. The products are listed on another view with a tableview controller and I have enabled multiple selections. My question is, how do I transfer the data from one view to another? I will be holding the selections on the tableview in an array, but how do I then pass that back to the previous data entry form view so it can be saved along with the other data to core data on submission of the form? I have surfed around and seen some people declare an array in the app delegate. I read something about Singletons but don't understand what these are and I read something about creating a data model. What would be the correct way of performing this and how would I go about it?

@TITLE:Prototypical inheritance - writing up [duplicate]
@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: Javascript object members that are prototyped as arrays become shared by all class instances 2 answers So I have these 2 examples, from javascript.info: Example 1: var animal = {
  eat: function() {
    alert( "I'm full" )
    this.full = true
  }
}

var rabbit = {
  jump: function() { /* something */ }
}

rabbit.__proto__ = animal 

rabbit.eat() 
 Example 2: function Hamster() {  }
Hamster.prototype = {
  food: [],
  found: function(something) {
    this.food.push(something)
  }
}

// Create two speedy and lazy hamsters, then feed the first one
speedy = new Hamster()
lazy = new Hamster()

speedy.found("apple")
speedy.found("orange")

alert(speedy.food.length) // 2
alert(lazy.food.length) // 2 (!??)
 Start from Example 2: when the code reaches speedy.found, it finds no found property in speedy, and so it climbs up to the prototype and changes it there. That's why food.length is equal for both hamsters, in other words they have the same stomach. From this I understand, that when writing up and adding a new property which doesn't exist, the interpreter will go up the prototype chain until it finds the property, and THEN change it. BUT in Example 1 something else happens: we run rabbit.eat, which changes rabbit.full. full property is nowhere to be found, so it should go up the prototype chain to (to object??), and well, I'm not sure what happens here. In this example the property full of rabbit is created and changed, while in the first example it goes up the prototype chain because it cannot find the property. I'm confused and cannot see why this happens.
@CODE:var animal = {
  eat: function() {
    alert( "I'm full" )
    this.full = true
  }
}

var rabbit = {
  jump: function() { /* something */ }
}

rabbit.__proto__ = animal 

rabbit.eat() function Hamster() {  }
Hamster.prototype = {
  food: [],
  found: function(something) {
    this.food.push(something)
  }
}

// Create two speedy and lazy hamsters, then feed the first one
speedy = new Hamster()
lazy = new Hamster()

(Also, how could you write a method that takes in a object that implements an interface? Is that possible?) Sorry if I completely missed the point. Additional questions: does using an Interface hit performance? if so how much? how can you avoid it without having to maintain two bits of code?
@CODE:IInterface classRef = new ObjectWhatever() IInterface IInterface

@TITLE:How to upload files to server using JSP/Servlet?
@CONTENT:How can I upload files to server using JSP/Servlet? I tried this: <form action="upload" method="post">
    <input type="text" name="description" />
    <input type="file" name="file" />
    <input type="submit" />
</form>
 However, I only get the file name, not the file content. When I add enctype="multipart/form-data" to the <form>, then request.getParameter() returns null. During research I stumbled upon Apache Common FileUpload. I tried this: FileItemFactory factory = new DiskFileItemFactory();
ServletFileUpload upload = new ServletFileUpload(factory);
List items = upload.parseRequest(request); // This line is where it died.
 Unfortunately, the servlet threw an exception without a clear message and cause. Here is the stacktrace: SEVERE: Servlet.service() for servlet UploadServlet threw exception
javax.servlet.ServletException: Servlet execution threw an exception

@TITLE:Strange out of memory issue while loading an image to a Bitmap object
@CONTENT:I have a list view with a couple of image buttons on each row. When you click the list row, it launches a new activity. I have had to build my own tabs because of an issue with the camera layout. The activity that gets launched for result is a map. If I click on my button to launch the image preview (load an image off the SD card) the application returns from the activity back to the listview activity to the result handler to relaunch my new activity which is nothing more than an image widget. The image preview on the list view is being done with the cursor and ListAdapter. This makes it pretty simple, but I am not sure how I can put a resized image (I.e. Smaller bit size not pixel as the src for the image button on the fly. So I just resized the image that came off the phone camera. The issue is that I get an out of memory error when it tries to go back and re-launch the 2nd activity. ** Is there a way I can build the list adapter easily row by row, where I can resize on the fly (bit wise)? This would be preferable as I also need to make some changes to the properties of the widgets/elements in each row as I am unable to select a row with touch screen because of focus issue. (I can use roller ball.) ** I know I can do an out of band resize and save of my image, but that is not really what I want to do, but some sample code for that would be nice. As soon as I disabled the image on the list view it worked fine again. FYI: This is how I was doing it: String[] from = new String[] { DBHelper.KEY_BUSINESSNAME,
                               DBHelper.KEY_ADDRESS,
                               DBHelper.KEY_CITY,
                               DBHelper.KEY_GPSLONG,
                               DBHelper.KEY_GPSLAT,
                               DBHelper.KEY_IMAGEFILENAME  + ""};
int[] to = new int[] { R.id.businessname,
                       R.id.address,
                       R.id.city,
                       R.id.gpslong,
                       R.id.gpslat,
                       R.id.imagefilename };
notes = new SimpleCursorAdapter(this, R.layout.notes_row, c, from, to);
setListAdapter(notes);
 Where R.id.imagefilename is a ButtonImage. Here is my LogCat: 01-25 05:05:49.877: ERROR/dalvikvm-heap(3896): 6291456-byte external allocation too large for this process.

This question, Is ¡§double hashing¡¨ a password less secure than just hashing it once? suggests that hashing multiple times may be a good idea, whereas How to implement password protection for individual files? suggests using salt. I'm using PHP. I want a safe and fast password encryption system. Hashing a password a million times may be safer, but also slower. How to achieve a good balance between speed and safety? Also, I'd prefer the result to have a constant number of characters. The hashing mechanism must be available in PHP It must be safe It can use salt (in this case, are all salts equally good? Is there any way to generate good salts?) Also, should I store two fields in the database (one using MD5 and another one using SHA, for example)? Would it make it safer or unsafer? In case I wasn't clear enough, I want to know which hashing function(s) to use and how to pick a good salt in order to have a safe and fast password protection mechanism.

@TITLE:Simulating group_concat MySQL function in SQL Server?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to migrate a MySQL-based app over to Microsoft SQL Server 2005 (not by choice, but that's life). In the original app, we used almost entirely ANSI-SQL compliant statements, with one significant exception -- we used MySQL's group_concat function fairly frequently. group_concat, by the way, does this: given a table of, say, employee names and projects... SELECT empName, projID FROM project_members;
 returns: ANDY   |  A100
ANDY   |  B391
ANDY   |  X010
TOM    |  A100
TOM    |  A510
 ... and here's what you get with group_concat: SELECT 
    empName, group_concat(projID SEPARATOR ' / ') 
FROM 
    project_members 
GROUP BY 
    empName;
 returns: ANDY   |  A100 / B391 / X010
TOM    |  A100 / A510
 ...So what I'd like to know is: Is it possible to write, say, a user-defined function in SQL Server which emulates the functionality of group_concat? I have almost no experience using UDFs, stored procedures, or anything like that -- just straight-up SQL -- so please err on the side of too much explanation :)

    <span> Foo </span><span> Bar </span>
</p>
 However, I was hoping for a CSS solution that doesn't require the HTML source code to be tampered with. I know how to solve this with JavaScript - by removing the Text nodes from the container element (the paragraph), like so: // jQuery
$('p').contents().filter(function() { return this.nodeType === 3; }).remove();

@TITLE:Where can I find documentation on formatting a date in JavaScript?
@CONTENT:I noticed that JavaScript's new Date() function is very smart in accepting dates in several formats. Xmas95 = new Date("25 Dec, 1995 23:15:00")
Xmas95 = new Date("2009 06 12,12:52:39")
Xmas95 = new Date("20 09 2006,12:52:39")
 I could not find documentation anywhere showing all the valid string formats while calling new Date() function. This is for converting a string to a date. If we look at the opposite side, that is, converting a date object to a string, until now I was under the impression that JavaScript doesn't have a built-in API to format a date object into a string. Editor's note: The following approach is the asker's attempt that worked on a particular browser but does not work in general; see the answers on this page to see some actual solutions. Today, I played with the toString() method on the date object and surprisingly it serves the purpose of formatting date to strings. var d1 = new Date();
d1.toString('yyyy-MM-dd');       //Returns "2009-06-29" in Internet Explorer, but not Firefox or Chrome
d1.toString('dddd, MMMM ,yyyy')  //Returns "Monday, June 29,2009" in Internet Explorer, but not Firefox or Chrome
 Also here I couldn't find any documentation on all the ways we can format the date object into a string. Where is the documentation which lists the format specifiers supported by the Date() object?

For example, my range is 5-10, meaning that 5 is the smallest possible value the random number can take, and 10 is the biggest. Any other number in between these numbers is possible to be a value, too. In Java, there is a method random() in the Math class, which returns a double value between 0.0 and 1.0. In the class Random there is a method nextInt(int n), which returns a random integer value in the range of 0 (inclusive) and n (exclusive). I couldn't find a method, which returns a random integer value between two numbers. I have tried the following things, but I still have problems: (minimum and maximum are the smallest and biggest numbers). Solution 1: randomNum = minimum + (int)(Math.random()*maximum);

@CONTENT:C++ inherited arrays from C where they are used virtually everywhere. C++ provides abstractions that are easier to use and less error-prone (std::vector<T> since C++98 and std::array<T, n> since C++11), so the need for arrays does not arise quite as often as it does in C. However, when you read legacy code or interact with a library written in C, you should have a firm grasp on how arrays work. This FAQ is split into five parts: arrays on the type level and accessing elements array creation and initialization assignment and parameter passing multidimensional arrays and arrays of pointers common pitfalls when using arrays If you feel something important is missing in this FAQ, write an answer and link it here as an additional part. In the following text, "array" means "C array", not the class template std::array. Basic knowledge of the C declarator syntax is assumed. Note that the manual usage of new and delete as demonstrated below is extremely dangerous in the face of exceptions, but that is the topic of another FAQ.

@TITLE:Saving Activity state on Android
@CONTENT:I've been playing around with the Android SDK, and I am a little unclear on saving an application's state. So given this minor re-tooling of the 'Hello, Android' example: package com.android.hello;

import android.app.Activity;
import android.os.Bundle;
import android.widget.TextView;

public class HelloAndroid extends Activity {
    /** Called when the activity is first created. */
    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

        mTextView = new TextView(this);

        if (savedInstanceState == null) {
            mTextView.setText("Welcome to HelloAndroid!");
        } else {
            mTextView.setText("Welcome back.");
        }

        setContentView(mTextView);
    }

    private TextView mTextView = null;
}
 I thought that might be all one needed to do for the simplest case, but it always gives me the first message, no matter how I navigate away from the app. I'm sure it's probably something simple like overriding onPause or something like that, but I've been poking away in the documentation for 30 minutes or so and haven't found anything obvious, so I would appreciate any help.

@LINK:/questions/1357118/event-preventdefault-vs-return-false
@TITLE:event.preventDefault() vs. return false
@CONTENT:When I want to prevent other event handlers from executing after a certain event is fired, I can use one of two techniques. I'll use jQuery in the examples, but this applies to plain-JS as well: 1. event.preventDefault() $('a').click(function (e) {
    // custom handling here
    e.preventDefault();
});
 2. return false $('a').click(function () {
    // custom handling here
    return false;
});
 Is there any significant difference between those two methods of stopping event propagation? For me, return false; is simpler, shorter and probably less error prone than executing a method. With the method, you have to remember about correct casing, parenthesis, etc. Also, I have to define the first parameter in callback to be able to call the method. Perhaps, there are some reasons why I should avoid doing it like this and use preventDefault instead? What's the better way?
@CODE:event.preventDefault() $('a').click(function (e) {
    // custom handling here
    e.preventDefault();
}); return false $('a').click(function () {
    // custom handling here
    return false;
}); return false; preventDefault preventDefault stopImmediatePropagation

@TITLE:What are the differences between a pointer variable and a reference variable in C++?
@CONTENT:I know references are syntactic sugar, so code is easier to read and write. But what are the differences? Summary from answers and links below: A pointer can be re-assigned any number of times while a reference can not be re-seated after binding. Pointers can point nowhere (NULL), whereas reference always refer to an object. You can't take the address of a reference like you can with pointers. There's no "reference arithmetics" (but you can take the address of an object pointed by a reference and do pointer arithmetics on it as in &obj + 5). To clarify a misconception: The C++ standard is very careful to avoid dictating how a compiler must implement references, but every C++ compiler implements references as pointers. That is, a declaration such as: int &ri = i;
 if it's not optimized away entirely, allocates the same amount of storage as a pointer, and places the address of i into that storage. So, a pointer and a reference both occupy the same amount of memory. As a general rule, Use references in function parameters and return types to define useful and self-documenting interfaces. Use pointers to implement algorithms and data structures. Interesting read: My alltime favorite C++ FQA lite. References vs. Pointers. An Introduction to References. References and const.

@TITLE:Is List<Dog> a subclass of List<Animal>? Why aren't Java's generics implicitly polymorphic?
@CONTENT:I'm a bit confused about how Java generics handle inheritance / polymorphism. Assume the following hierarchy - Animal (Parent) Dog - Cat (Children) So suppose I have a method doSomething(List<Animal> animals). By all the rules of inheritance and polymorphism, I would assume that a List<Dog> is a List<Animal> and a List<Cat> is a List<Animal> - and so either one could be passed to this method. Not so. If I want to achieve this behavior, I have to explicitly tell the method to accept a list of any subset of Animal by saying doSomething(List<? extends Animal> animals). I understand that this is Java's behavior. My question is why? Why is polymorphism generally implicit, but when it comes to generics it must be specified?

@CONTENT:In Java, arrays don't override toString(), so if you try to print one directly, you get weird output including the memory location: int[] intArray = new int[] {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
System.out.println(intArray);     // prints something like '[I@3343c8b3'
 But usually we'd actually want something more like [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. What's the simplest way of doing that? Here are some example inputs and outputs: // array of primitives:
int[] intArray = new int[] {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
//output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

// array of object references:
String[] strArray = new String[] {"John", "Mary", "Bob"};
//output: [John, Mary, Bob]
@CODE:toString() int[] intArray = new int[] {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
System.out.println(intArray);     // prints something like '[I@3343c8b3' [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] // array of primitives:
int[] intArray = new int[] {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
//output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

// array of object references:
String[] strArray = new String[] {"John", "Mary", "Bob"};
//output: [John, Mary, Bob]

@TITLE:Why use getters and setters?
@CONTENT:What's the advantage of using getters and setters - that only get and set - instead of simply using public fields for those variables? If getters and setters are ever doing more than just the simple get/set, I can figure this one out very quickly, but I'm not 100% clear on how: public String foo;
 is any worse than: private String foo;
public void setFoo(String foo) { this.foo = foo; }
public String getFoo() { return foo; }
 Whereas the former takes a lot less boilerplate code. Compiling the list up here at the top of what seemed winners to me, from the viewpoint of a Java web dev: When you realize you need to do more than just set and get the value, you don't have to change every file in the codebase. You can perform validation here. You can change the value being set. You can hide the internal representation. getAddress() could actually be getting several fields for you. You've insulated your public interface from changes under the sheets. Some libraries expect this. Reflection, serialization, mock objects. Inheriting this class, you can override default functionality. You can have different access levels for getter and setter. Lazy loading. People can easily tell you didn't use Python.

@TITLE:Why is processing a sorted array faster than an unsorted array?
@CONTENT:Here is a piece of C++ code that seems very peculiar. For some strange reason, sorting the data miraculously makes the code almost six times faster. #include <algorithm>
#include <ctime>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    // Generate data
    const unsigned arraySize = 32768;
    int data[arraySize];

    for (unsigned c = 0; c < arraySize; ++c)
        data[c] = std::rand() % 256;

    // !!! With this, the next loop runs faster
    std::sort(data, data + arraySize);

    // Test
    clock_t start = clock();
    long long sum = 0;

    for (unsigned i = 0; i < 100000; ++i)
    {
        // Primary loop
        for (unsigned c = 0; c < arraySize; ++c)
        {
            if (data[c] >= 128)
                sum += data[c];
        }
    }

    double elapsedTime = static_cast<double>(clock() - start) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;

    std::cout << elapsedTime << std::endl;
    std::cout << "sum = " << sum << std::endl;
}
 Without std::sort(data, data + arraySize);, the code runs in 11.54 seconds. With the sorted data, the code runs in 1.93 seconds. Initially, I thought this might be just a language or compiler anomaly. So I tried it in Java. import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Random;

public class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // Generate data
        int arraySize = 32768;
        int data[] = new int[arraySize];

        Random rnd = new Random(0);
        for (int c = 0; c < arraySize; ++c)
            data[c] = rnd.nextInt() % 256;

        // !!! With this, the next loop runs faster
        Arrays.sort(data);

        // Test
        long start = System.nanoTime();
        long sum = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < 100000; ++i)
        {
            // Primary loop
            for (int c = 0; c < arraySize; ++c)
            {
                if (data[c] >= 128)
                    sum += data[c];
            }
        }

        System.out.println((System.nanoTime() - start) / 1000000000.0);
        System.out.println("sum = " + sum);
    }
}
 With a somewhat similar, but less extreme result. My first thought was that sorting brings the data into the cache, but my next thought was how silly that is, because the array was just generated. What is going on? Why is a sorted array faster than an unsorted array? The code is summing up some independent terms, and the order should not matter.
@CODE:#include <algorithm>
#include <ctime>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    // Generate data
    const unsigned arraySize = 32768;
    int data[arraySize];

    for (unsigned c = 0; c < arraySize; ++c)
        data[c] = std::rand() % 256;

    // !!! With this, the next loop runs faster
    std::sort(data, data + arraySize);

    // Test
    clock_t start = clock();
    long long sum = 0;

    for (unsigned i = 0; i < 100000; ++i)
    {
        // Primary loop
        for (unsigned c = 0; c < arraySize; ++c)
        {
            if (data[c] >= 128)
                sum += data[c];
        }
    }

    double elapsedTime = static_cast<double>(clock() - start) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;

    std::cout << elapsedTime << std::endl;
    std::cout << "sum = " << sum << std::endl;
} std::sort(data, data + arraySize); import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Random;

public class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // Generate data
        int arraySize = 32768;
        int data[] = new int[arraySize];

        Random rnd = new Random(0);

            data[c] = rnd.nextInt() % 256;

@TITLE:jQuery Ajax POST example with PHP
@CONTENT:I am trying to send data from a form to a database. Here is the form I am using: <form name="foo" action="form.php" method="POST" id="foo">
    <label for="bar">A bar</label>
    <input id="bar" name="bar" type="text" value="" />
    <input type="submit" value="Send" />
</form>
 The typical approach would be to submit the form, but this causes the browser to redirect. Using jQuery and Ajax, is it possible to capture all of the form's data and submit it to a PHP script (in example, form.php)?
@CODE:<form name="foo" action="form.php" method="POST" id="foo">
    <label for="bar">A bar</label>
    <input id="bar" name="bar" type="text" value="" />
    <input type="submit" value="Send" />
</form>

@TITLE:jQuery Ajax File Upload
@CONTENT:Can I use the following jQuery code to perform file upload using post method of an Ajax request ? $.ajax({
    type: "POST",
    timeout: 50000,
    url: url,
    data: dataString,
    success: function (data) {
        alert('success');
        return false;
    }
});
 If it is possible, do I need to fill "data" part? Is it the correct way? I only post the file to the server side. I have been Googling around, but what I found was a plugin while in my plan I do not want to use it. At least for the moment.

@TITLE:Performance optimization strategies of last resort [closed]
@CONTENT:There are plenty of performance questions on this site already, but it occurs to me that almost all are very problem-specific and fairly narrow. And almost all repeat the advice to avoid premature optimization. Let's assume: the code already is working correctly the algorithms chosen are already optimal for the circumstances of the problem the code has been measured, and the offending routines have been isolated all attempts to optimize will also be measured to ensure they do not make matters worse What I am looking for here is strategies and tricks to squeeze out up to the last few percent in a critical algorithm when there is nothing else left to do but whatever it takes. Ideally, try to make answers language agnostic, and indicate any down-sides to the suggested strategies where applicable. I'll add a reply with my own initial suggestions, and look forward to whatever else the Stack Overflow community can think of.

@CONTENT:I am relatively new to Java, and often find that I need to sort a Map<Key, Value> on the values. Since the values are not unique, I find myself converting the keySet into an array, and sorting that array through array sort with a custom comparator that sorts on the value associated with the key. Is there an easier way?

@TITLE:Cross-thread operation not valid: Control accessed from a thread other than the thread it was created on
@CONTENT:I have a scenario. (Windows Forms, C#, .NET) There is a main form which hosts some user control. The user control does some heavy data operation, such that if I directly call the UserControl_Load method the UI become nonresponsive for the duration for load method execution. To overcome this I load data on different thread (trying to change existing code as little as I can) I used a background worker thread which will be loading the data and when done will notify the application that it has done its work. Now came a real problem. All the UI (main form and its child usercontrols) was created on the primary main thread. In the LOAD method of the usercontrol I'm fetching data based on the values of some control (like textbox) on userControl. The pseudocode would look like this: CODE 1 UserContrl1_LoadDataMethod()
{
    if (textbox1.text == "MyName") // This gives exception
    {
        //Load data corresponding to "MyName".
        //Populate a globale variable List<string> which will be binded to grid at some later stage.
    }
}
 The Exception it gave was Cross-thread operation not valid: Control accessed from a thread other than the thread it was created on. To know more about this I did some googling and a suggestion came up like using the following code CODE 2 UserContrl1_LoadDataMethod()
{
    if (InvokeRequired) // Line #1
    {
        this.Invoke(new MethodInvoker(UserContrl1_LoadDataMethod));
        return;
    }

    if (textbox1.text == "MyName") // Now it wont give an exception
    {
    //Load data correspondin to "MyName"
        //Populate a globale variable List<string> which will be binded to grid at some later stage
    }
}
 BUT BUT BUT... it seems I'm back to square one. The Application again become nonresponsive. It seems to be due to the execution of line #1 if condition. The loading task is again done by the parent thread and not the third that I spawned. I don't know whether I perceived this right or wrong. I'm new to threading. How do I resolve this and also what is the effect of execution of Line#1 if block? The situation is this: I want to load data into a global variable based on the value of a control. I don't want to change the value of a control from the child thread. I'm not going to do it ever from a child thread. So only accessing the value so that the corresponding data can be fetched from the database.
@CODE:UserControl_Load UserContrl1_LoadDataMethod()
{
    if (textbox1.text == "MyName") // This gives exception
    {
        //Load data corresponding to "MyName".
        //Populate a globale variable List<string> which will be binded to grid at some later stage.
    }
} UserContrl1_LoadDataMethod()
{
    if (InvokeRequired) // Line #1
    {
        this.Invoke(new MethodInvoker(UserContrl1_LoadDataMethod));
        return;
    }

    if (textbox1.text == "MyName") // Now it wont give an exception
    {
    //Load data correspondin to "MyName"
        //Populate a globale variable List<string> which will be binded to grid at some later stage

@TITLE:Is storing a delimited list in a database column really that bad?
@CONTENT:Imagine a web form with a set of check boxes (any or all of them can be selected). I chose to save them in a comma separated list of values stored in one column of the database table. Now, I know that the correct solution would be to create a second table and properly normalize the database. It was quicker to implement the easy solution, and I wanted to have a proof-of-concept of that application quickly and without having to spend too much time on it. I thought the saved time and simpler code was worth it in my situation, is this a defensible design choice, or should I have normalized it from the start? Some more context, this is a small internal application that essentially replaces an Excel file that was stored on a shared folder. I'm also asking because I'm thinking about cleaning up the program and make it more maintainable. There are some things in there I'm not entirely happy with, one of them is the topic of this question.

JSON is a data format. There's no call. The 2nd search result is from some guy named Remy, who writes this about JSONP: JSONP is script tag injection, passing the response from the server in to a user specified function. I can sort of understand that, but it's still not making any sense. So what is JSONP? Why was it created (what problem does it solve)? And why would I use it?

@TITLE:How to round a number to n decimal places in Java
@CONTENT:What I'd like is a method to convert a double to a string which rounds using the half-up method. I.e. if the decimal to be rounded is a 5, it always rounds up the previous number. This is the standard method of rounding most people expect in most situations. I also would like only significant digits to be displayed. That is there should not be any trailing zeroes. I know one method of doing this is to use the String.format method: String.format("%.5g%n", 0.912385);
 returns: 0.91239
 which is great, however it always displays numbers with 5 decimal places even if they are not significant: String.format("%.5g%n", 0.912300);
 returns: 0.91230
 Another method is to use the DecimalFormatter: DecimalFormat df = new DecimalFormat("#.#####");
df.format(0.912385);
 returns: 0.91238
 However as you can see this uses half-even rounding. That is it will round down if the previous digit is even. What I'd like is this: 0.912385 -> 0.91239
0.912300 -> 0.9123
 What is the best way to achieve this in Java?
@CODE:String.format("%.5g%n", 0.912385); 0.91239 String.format("%.5g%n", 0.912300); 0.91230 DecimalFormat df = new DecimalFormat("#.#####");
df.format(0.912385); 0.91238 0.912385 -> 0.91239

@CONTENT:It is my first post here. I started learning Java and here is my first problem I cannot sort out on my own. I am using Scanner methods nextInt() and nextLine() for reading input. Basically it looks like that System.out.println("enter numerical value");    
int option;
option = input.nextInt ();//read numerical value from input
System.out.println("enter 1st string"); 
String string1 = input.nextLine ();//read first string which is skipped
System.out.println("enter 2nd string");
String string2 = input.nextLine ();//read 2nd string which appeared straight after reading numerical value
 and the problem is that after entering numerical value first input.nextLine() is skipped and the second input.nextLine() is executed, so my output looks Enter numerical value
3//this is my input
enter 1st string//here suppose to be stopped and wait for my input but is skipped
enter 2nd string//and this line is executed and wait for my input
 I tested my "application" and it looks like the problem lies in using input.nextInt(). If I delete it then nextLine() works fine, I mean both string1 = input.nextLine() and string1 = input.nextLine() are executed.

@CONTENT:Here's the information according to the official documentation: There are four different pairs of opening and closing tags which can be used in PHP. Two of those, <?php ?> and <script language="php"> </script>, are always available. The other two are short tags and ASP style tags, and can be turned on and off from the php.ini configuration file. As such, while some people find short tags and ASP style tags convenient, they are less portable, and generally not recommended. In my experience most servers do have short tags enabled. Typing <?=
 is far more convenient than typing <?php echo 
 The programmers convenience is an important factor, so why are they not recommended?

@CONTENT:Let's say I specify an outputText component like this: <h:outputText value="#{ManagedBean.someProperty}"/>
 If I print a log message when the getter for someProperty is called and load the page, it is trivial to notice that the getter is being called more than once per request (twice or three times is what happened in my case): DEBUG 2010-01-18 23:31:40,104 (ManagedBean.java:13) - Getting some property
DEBUG 2010-01-18 23:31:40,104 (ManagedBean.java:13) - Getting some property
 If the value of someProperty is expensive to calculate, this can potentially be a problem. I googled a bit and figured this is a known issue. One workaround was to include a check and see if it had already been calculated: private String someProperty;

public String getSomeProperty() {
    if (this.someProperty == null) {
        this.someProperty = this.calculatePropertyValue();
    }
    return this.someProperty;
}
 The main problem with this is that you get loads of boilerplate code, not to mention private variables that you might not need. What are the alternatives to this approach? Is there a way to achieve this without so much unnecessary code? Is there a way to stop JSF from behaving in this way? Thanks for your input!

 This is sample form data: <input type="hidden" name="SaveRequired" value="False" /><input type="hidden" name="__VIEWSTATE1" value="1H4sIAAtzrkX7QfL5VEGj6nGi+nP" /><input type="hidden" name="__VIEWSTATE2" value="0351118MK" /><input type="hidden" name="__VIEWSTATE3" value="ZVVV91yjY" /><input type="hidden" name="__VIEWSTATE0" value="3" /><input type="hidden" name="__VIEWSTATE" value="" /><input type="hidden" name="__VIEWSTATE" value="" />
 But I am not sure that the type, name, and value attributes will always appear in the same order. If the type attribute comes last, the match will fail because in my pattern it¡¦s at the start. Question: How can I change my pattern so it will match regardless of the positions of the attributes in the <input> tag? P.S.: By the way I am using the Adobe Air based RegEx Desktop Tool for testing regular expressions.
@CODE:<input> /<input type="hidden" name="([^"]*?)" value="([^"]*?)" />/ <input type="hidden" name="SaveRequired" value="False" /><input type="hidden" name="__VIEWSTATE1" value="1H4sIAAtzrkX7QfL5VEGj6nGi+nP" /><input type="hidden" name="__VIEWSTATE2" value="0351118MK" /><input type="hidden" name="__VIEWSTATE3" value="ZVVV91yjY" /><input type="hidden" name="__VIEWSTATE0" value="3" /><input type="hidden" name="__VIEWSTATE" value="" /><input type="hidden" name="__VIEWSTATE" value="" /> type name value type <input>

@TITLE:Quitting an application - is that frowned upon?
@CONTENT:Moving on in my attempt to learn Android, I just read the following: Question: Does the user have a choice to kill the application unless we put a menu option in to kill it? If no such option exists, how does the user terminate the application? Answer: (Romain Guy): The user doesn't, the system handles this automatically. That's what the activity lifecycle (especially onPause/onStop/onDestroy) is for. No matter what you do, do not put a "quit" or "exit" application button. It is useless with Android's application model. This is also contrary to how core applications work. Hehe, for every step I take in the Android world I run into some sort of problem =( Apparently, you cannot quit an application in Android (but the Android system can very well totally destroy your app whenever it feels like it). What's up with that? I am starting to think that it's impossible to write an app that functions as a "normal app" - that the user can quit the app when he/she decides to do so. That is not something that should be relied upon the OS to do. The application I am trying to create is not an application for the Android Market. It is not an application for "wide use" by the general public, it is a business app that is going to be used in a very narrow business field. I was actually really looking forward to developing for the Android platform, since it addresses a lot of issues that exist in Windows Mobile and .NET. However, the last week has been somewhat of a turnoff for me... I hope I don't have to abandon Android, but it doesn't look very good right now =( Is there a way for me to really quit the application?

I am most familiar with C/C++, Java, and Ruby, so I prefer resources that involve one of those three, but any good resource is acceptable.

@TITLE:Daylight saving time and time zone best practices
@CONTENT:I am hoping to make this question and the answers to it the definitive guide to dealing with daylight saving time, in particular for dealing with the actual change overs. If you have anything to add, please do Many systems are dependent on keeping accurate time, the problem is with changes to time due to daylight savings - moving the clock forward or backwards. For instance, one has business rules in an order taking system that depend on the time of the order - if the clock changes, the rules might not be as clear. How should the time of the order be persisted? There is of course an endless number of scenarios - this one is simply an illustrative one. How have you dealt with the daylight saving issue? What assumptions are part of your solution? (looking for context here) As important, if not more so: What did you try that did not work? Why did it not work? I would be interested in programming, OS, data persistence and other pertinent aspects of the issue. General answers are great, but I would also like to see details especially if they are only available on one platform.

@CONTENT:I'm not that into dynamic programming languages, but I've written my fair share of JavaScript code. I never really got my head around this prototype-based programming, does any one know how this works? var obj = new Object(); // not a functional object
obj.prototype.test = function() { alert('Hello?'); }; // this is wrong!

function MyObject() {} // a first class functional object
MyObject.prototype.test = function() { alert('OK'); } // OK
 I remember a lot discussion I had with people a while back (I'm not exactly sure what I'm doing) but as I understand it, there's no concept of a class. It's just an object, and instances of those objects are clones of the original, right? But what is the exact purpose of this .prototype property in JavaScript? How does it relate to instantiating objects? Edit These slides really helped a lot to understand this topic.
@CODE:var obj = new Object(); // not a functional object
obj.prototype.test = function() { alert('Hello?'); }; // this is wrong!

function MyObject() {} // a first class functional object
MyObject.prototype.test = function() { alert('OK'); } // OK .prototype

@CONTENT:I find programming in PHP quite frustrating. Quite often I will try and run the script and just get a blank screen back. No error message, just empty screen. The cause might have been a simple syntax error (wrong bracket, missing semicolon), or a failed function call, or something else entirely. It is very difficult to figure out what went wrong. I end up commenting out code, entering "echo" statements everywhere, etc. trying to narrow down the problem. But there surely must be a better way, right?.

@TITLE:In jQuery, how to attach events to dynamic html elements? [duplicate]
@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: Event binding on dynamically created elements? 10 answers Suppose I have some jQuery code that attaches an event handler to all elements with class "myclass". For example: $(function(){
    $(".myclass").click( function() {
        // do something
    });
});
 And my html might be as follows: <a class="myclass" href="#">test1</a>
<a class="myclass" href="#">test2</a>
<a class="myclass" href="#">test3</a>
 That works with no problem. However, consider if the "myclass" elements were written to the page at some future time. For example: <a id="anchor1" href="#">create link dynamically</a>
<script type="text/javascript">
$(function(){
    $("#anchor1").click( function() {
        $("#anchor1").append('<a class="myclass" href="#">test4</a>');
    });
});
</script>
 In this case, the "test4" link is created when a user clicks on a#anchor1. The "test4" link does not have the click() handler associated with it, even though it has class="myclass". Any idea how I can fix this? Basically, I would like to write the click() handler once and have it apply to both content present at page load, and content brought in later via Ajax/DHTML.
@CODE:$(function(){
    $(".myclass").click( function() {
        // do something
    });
}); <a class="myclass" href="#">test1</a>
<a class="myclass" href="#">test2</a>
<a class="myclass" href="#">test3</a> <a id="anchor1" href="#">create link dynamically</a>
<script type="text/javascript">
$(function(){
    $("#anchor1").click( function() {
        $("#anchor1").append('<a class="myclass" href="#">test4</a>');
    });
});

@TITLE:Can you provide some examples of why it is hard to parse XML and HTML with a regex?
@CONTENT:One mistake I see people making over and over again is trying to parse XML or HTML with a regex. Here are a few of the reasons parsing XML and HTML is hard: People want to treat a file as a sequence of lines, but this is valid: <tag
attr="5"
/>
 People want to treat < or <tag as the start of a tag, but stuff like this exists in the wild: <img src="imgtag.gif" alt="<img>" />
 People often want to match starting tags to ending tags, but XML and HTML allow tags to contain themselves (which traditional regexes cannot handle at all): <span id="outer"><span id="inner">foo</span></span>
 People often want to match against the content of a document (such as the famous "find all phone numbers on a given page" problem), but the data may be marked up (even if it appears to be normal when viewed): <span class="phonenum">(<span class="area code">703</span>)
<span class="prefix">348</span>-<span class="linenum">3020</span></span>
 Comments may contain poorly formatted or incomplete tags: <a href="foo">foo</a>

@CONTENT:I have had recently two telephone interviews where I've been asked about the differences between an Interface and an Abstract class. I have explained every aspect of them I could think of, but it seems they are waiting for me to mention something specific, and I don't know what it is. From my experience I think the following is true. If I am missing a major point please let me know. Interface: Every single Method declared in an Interface will have to be implemented in the subclass. Only Events, Delegates, Properties (C#) and Methods can exist in a Interface. A class can implement multiple Interfaces. Abstract Class: Only Abstract methods have to be implemented by the subclass. An Abstract class can have normal methods with implementations. Abstract class can also have class variables beside Events, Delegates, Properties and Methods. A class can only implement one abstract class only due non-existence of Multi-inheritance in C#. After all that, the interviewer came up with the question "What if you had an Abstract class with only abstract methods? How would that be different from an interface?" I didn't know the answer but I think it's the inheritance as mentioned above right? An another interviewer asked me what if you had a Public variable inside the interface, how would that be different than in Abstract Class? I insisted you can't have a public variable inside an interface. I didn't know what he wanted to hear but he wasn't satisfied either. See Also: When to use an interface instead of an abstract class and vice versa Interfaces vs. Abstract Classes How do you decide between using an Abstract Class and an Interface?

@TITLE:Calling awt Frame methods from subclass
@CONTENT:This question is about Frames, Java and Processing. This questions sounds pretty convoluted but its really not. I'll try keep this to a simple minimum. I'm creating a small ball in a maze game to get my head around physics and rendering. It's been a good experience so far but I've hit a bit of a brick wall. The general layout I decided on was to contain PApplets within a AWT Frame and have the Frame close. The reason for this is because I was told that you should only have on instance of a Papplet at a time. PApplet is the Applet class in Processing, a rendering library. I have 3 classes here including the main public class Menu extends PApplet
{
//images and buttons 
PImage background, playbtn1, playbtn2, hsbtn1, hsbtn2, abbtn1, abbtn2, exbtn1,     exbtn2;

    pBtn.setDrawable(false);
    hBtn = new FBox(120, 150);
    hBtn.setPosition(295, 215);
    hBtn.setDrawable(false);
    eBtn = new FBox(120, 150);

 the main public class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
        ExampleFrame x = new ExampleFrame(new Menu());

}
 What needs to happen when mousePressed == ebtn is all the stuff in the Frame will be removed and a Highscores Screen will be loaded. highscores is almost the same as menu. There is no need to post code as there is enough here. The second class is the one which acts as a frame and holds the PApplet Bottom line, has anyone have any idea how to call the Frame methods from the PApplet or another way to remove all PApplets contents and load another PApplet in?

@TITLE:Can I bind an array to an IN() condition?
@CONTENT:I'm curious to know if it's possible to bind an array of values to a placeholder using PDO. The use case here is attempting to pass an array of values for use with an IN() condition. I'm not very good at explaining, so here's some psuedocode to demonstrate. I'd like to be able to do something like this: <?php
$ids=array(1,2,3,7,8,9);
$db = new PDO(...);
$stmt = $db->prepare(
    'SELECT *
     FROM table
     WHERE id IN(:an_array)'
);
$stmt->bindParam('an_array',$ids);
$stmt->execute();
?>
 And have PDO bind and quote all the values in the array. At the moment I'm doing: <?php
$ids = array(1,2,3,7,8,9);
$db = new PDO(...);
foreach($ids as &$val)
    $val=$db->quote($val); //iterate through array and quote
$in = implode(',',$ids); //create comma separated list
$stmt = $db->prepare(
    'SELECT *
     FROM table
     WHERE id IN('.$in.')'
);
$stmt->execute();
?>
 Which certainly does the job, but just wondering if there's a built in solution I'm missing?
@CODE:IN() <?php
$ids=array(1,2,3,7,8,9);
$db = new PDO(...);
$stmt = $db->prepare(
    'SELECT *
     FROM table

?> <?php

$db = new PDO(...);

@TITLE:Android - basic gesture detection
@CONTENT:I want to get fling gesture detection working in my Android application. What I have is a GridLayout that contains 9 ImageViews. The source can be found here: Romain Guys's Grid Layout. That file is take from Romain Guy's Photostream application and has only been slightly adapted. For the simple click situation I need only set the onClickListener for each ImageView I add to be the main activity which implements View.OnClickListener. It seems infinitely more complicated to implement something that recognizes a fling. I presume this is because it may span views? If my activity implements OnGestureListener I don't know how to set that as the gesture listener for the Grid or the Image views that I add. public class SelectFilterActivity extends Activity implements
   View.OnClickListener, OnGestureListener { ...
 If my activity implements OnTouchListener then I have no onFling method to override (it has two events as parameters allowing me to determine if the fling was noteworthy). public class SelectFilterActivity extends Activity implements
    View.OnClickListener, OnTouchListener { ...
 If I make a custom View, like GestureImageView that extends ImageView I don't know how to tell the activity that a fling has occurred from the view. In any case, I tried this and the methods weren't called when I touched the screen. I really just need a concrete example of this working across views. What, when and how should I attach this listener? I need to be able to detect single clicks also. // Gesture detection
mGestureDetector = new GestureDetector(this, new GestureDetector.SimpleOnGestureListener() {

    public boolean onFling(MotionEvent e1, MotionEvent e2, float velocityX, float velocityY) {

        // as it may conflict with a button push

 Is it possible to lay a transparent view over the top of my screen to capture flings? If I choose not to inflate my child image views from XML can I pass the GestureDetector as a constructor parameter to a new subclass of ImageView that I create? This is the very simple activity that I'm trying to get the fling detection to work for: SelectFilterActivity (Adapted from photostream). I've been looking at these sources: Detect Gestures - Tutorial SDK docs Calculator Code Nothing has worked for me so far and I was hoping for some pointers.

   View.OnClickListener, OnGestureListener { ... OnTouchListener onFling override public class SelectFilterActivity extends Activity implements
    View.OnClickListener, OnTouchListener { ... View GestureImageView ImageView fling listener // Gesture detection
mGestureDetector = new GestureDetector(this, new GestureDetector.SimpleOnGestureListener() {

    public boolean onFling(MotionEvent e1, MotionEvent e2, float velocityX, float velocityY) {
        int dx = (int) (e2.getX() - e1.getX());
        // don't accept the fling if it's too short
        // as it may conflict with a button push
        if (Math.abs(dx) > MAJOR_MOVE && Math.abs(velocityX) > Math.absvelocityY)) {
            if (velocityX > 0) {
                moveRight();
            } else {
                moveLeft();

@TITLE:Storing Objects in HTML5 localStorage
@CONTENT:I'd like to store a JavaScript object in HTML5 localStorage, but my object is apparently being converted to a string. I can store and retrieve primitive JavaScript types and arrays using localStorage, but objects don't seem to work. Should they? Here's my code: var testObject = { 'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3 };
console.log('typeof testObject: ' + typeof testObject);
console.log('testObject properties:');
for (var prop in testObject) {
    console.log('  ' + prop + ': ' + testObject[prop]);
}

// Put the object into storage
localStorage.setItem('testObject', testObject);

// Retrieve the object from storage
var retrievedObject = localStorage.getItem('testObject');

console.log('typeof retrievedObject: ' + typeof retrievedObject);
console.log('Value of retrievedObject: ' + retrievedObject);
 The console output is typeof testObject: object
testObject properties:
  one: 1
  two: 2
  three: 3
typeof retrievedObject: string
Value of retrievedObject: [object Object]
 It looks to me like the setItem method is converting the input to a string before storing it. I see this behavior in Safari, Chrome, and Firefox, so I assume it's my misunderstanding of the HTML5 Web Storage spec, not a browser-specific bug or limitation. I've tried to make sense of the structured clone algorithm described in http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html. I don't fully understand what it's saying, but maybe my problem has to do with my object's properties not being enumerable (???) Is there an easy workaround?
@CODE:localStorage localStorage var testObject = { 'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3 };
console.log('typeof testObject: ' + typeof testObject);

@CONTENT:Ok, I'm now banging my head against a brick wall with this one. I have an HTML (not XHTML) document that renders fine in Firefox 3 and IE 7. It uses fairly basic CSS to style it and renders fine in HTML. I'm now after a way of converting it to PDF. I have tried: DOMPDF: it had huge problems with tables. I factored out my large nested tables and it helped (before it was just consuming up to 128M of memory then dying--thats my limit on memory in php.ini) but it makes a complete mess of tables and doesn't seem to get images. The tables were just basic stuff with some border styles to add some lines at various points; HTML2PDF and HTML2PS: I actually had better luck with this. It rendered some of the images (all the images are Google Chart URLs) and the table formatting was much better but it seemed to have some complexity problem I haven't figured out yet and kept dying with unknown node_type() errors. Not sure where to go from here; and Htmldoc: this seems to work fine on basic HTML but has almost no support for CSS whatsoever so you have to do everything in HTML (I didn't realize it was still 2001 in Htmldoc-land...) so it's useless to me. I tried a Windows app called Html2Pdf Pilot that actually did a pretty decent job but I need something that at a minimum runs on Linux and ideally runs on-demand via PHP on the Webserver. I really can't believe I'm this stuck. Am I missing something?

@TITLE:What is the simplest and most robust way to get the user's current location in Android?
@CONTENT:The LocationManager API in android seems like it's a bit of a pain to use for an application that only needs an occasional and rough approximation of the user's location. The app I'm working on isn't really a location app per se, but it does need to get the user's location in order to display a list of nearby businesses. It doesn't need to worry about if the user is moving around or anything like that. Here's what I'd like to do: Show the user a list of nearby locations. Preload the user's location so that by the time I need it in Activity X, it will be available. Don't particularly care about accuracy or frequency of update. Just grabbing one location is sufficient as long as it's not way off. Maybe if I want to be fancy I'll update the location once every few mins or so, but it's not a huge priority. Work for any device as long as it has either a GPS or a Network Location provider. It seems like it shouldn't be that hard, but it appears to me that I have to spin up two different location providers (GPS and NETWORK) and manage each's lifecycle. Not only that, but I have to duplicate the same code in multiple activities to satisfy #2. I've tried using getBestProvider() in the past to cut the solution down to just using one location provider, but that seems to only give you the best "theoretical" provider rather than the provider that's actually going to give you the best results. Is there a simpler way to accomplish this?

@TITLE:How to make a UITextField move up when keyboard is present
@CONTENT:With the iPhone SDK: I have a UIView with UITextFields that brings up a keyboard. I need it to be able to: Allow scrolling of the contents of the UIScrollView to see the other text fields once the keyboard is brought up Automatically "jump" (by scrolling up) or shortening I know that I need a UIScrollView. I've tried changing the class of my UIView to a UIScrollView but I'm still unable to scroll the textboxes up or down. Do I need both a UIView and a UIScrollView? Does one go inside the other? [EDIT: I now know that you want a UIView inside of a UIScrollView, and the trick is to programatically set the content size of the UIScrollView to the frame size of the UIView.] Then what needs to be implemented in order to automatically scroll to the active text field? Ideally as much of the setup of the components as possible will be done in Interface Builder. I'd like to only write code for what needs it. Note: the UIView (or UIScrollView) that I'm working with is brought up by a tabbar (UITabBar), which needs to function as normal. Edit: I am adding the scroll bar just for when the keyboard comes up. Even though it's not needed, I feel like it provides a better interface because then the user can scroll and change textboxes, for example. I've got it working where I change the frame size of the UIScrollView when the keyboard goes up and down. I'm simply using: -(void)textFieldDidBeginEditing:(UITextField *)textField { 
    //Keyboard becomes visible
    scrollView.frame = CGRectMake(scrollView.frame.origin.x, 
                     scrollView.frame.origin.y, 
scrollView.frame.size.width,
scrollView.frame.size.height - 215 + 50);   //resize
}

-(void)textFieldDidEndEditing:(UITextField *)textField {
   //keyboard will hide
    scrollView.frame = CGRectMake(scrollView.frame.origin.x, 
       scrollView.frame.origin.y, 
     scrollView.frame.size.width,
      scrollView.frame.size.height + 215 - 50); //resize
}
 However this doesn't automatically "move up" or center the lower text fields in the visible area, which is what I would really like.
@CODE:UIView UITextFields UIScrollView UIScrollView UIView UIScrollView UIScrollView UIView UIScrollView UIScrollView UIView UIView UIScrollView UITabBar UIScrollView -(void)textFieldDidBeginEditing:(UITextField *)textField { 
    //Keyboard becomes visible
    scrollView.frame = CGRectMake(scrollView.frame.origin.x, 
                     scrollView.frame.origin.y, 
scrollView.frame.size.width,
scrollView.frame.size.height - 215 + 50);   //resize
}

-(void)textFieldDidEndEditing:(UITextField *)textField {
   //keyboard will hide
    scrollView.frame = CGRectMake(scrollView.frame.origin.x, 
       scrollView.frame.origin.y, 
     scrollView.frame.size.width,
      scrollView.frame.size.height + 215 - 50); //resize
}

@LINK:/questions/406121/flattening-a-shallow-list-in-python
@TITLE:Flattening a shallow list in Python
@CONTENT:Is there a simple way to flatten a list of iterables with a list comprehension, or failing that, what would you all consider to be the best way to flatten a shallow list like this, balancing performance and readability? I tried to flatten such a list with a nested list comprehension, like this: [image for image in menuitem for menuitem in list_of_menuitems]
 But I get in trouble of the NameError variety there, because the name 'menuitem' is not defined. After googling and looking around on Stack Overflow, I got the desired results with a reduce statement: reduce(list.__add__, map(lambda x: list(x), list_of_menuitems))
 But this method is fairly unreadable because I need that list(x) call there because x is a Django QuerySet object. Conclusion: Thanks to everyone who contributed to this question. Here is a summary of what I learned. I'm also making this a community wiki in case others want to add to or correct these observations. My original reduce statement is redundant and is better written this way: >>> reduce(list.__add__, (list(mi) for mi in list_of_menuitems))
 This is the correct syntax for a nested list comprehension (Brilliant summary dF!): >>> [image for mi in list_of_menuitems for image in mi]
 But neither of these methods are as efficient as using itertools.chain: >>> from itertools import chain
>>> list(chain(*list_of_menuitems))
 And as @cdleary notes, it's probably better style to avoid * operator magic by using chain.from_iterable like so: >>> chain = itertools.chain.from_iterable([[1,2],[3],[5,89],[],[6]])
>>> print(list(chain))
>>> [1, 2, 3, 5, 89, 6]
@CODE:[image for image in menuitem for menuitem in list_of_menuitems] NameError name 'menuitem' is not defined reduce reduce(list.__add__, map(lambda x: list(x), list_of_menuitems)) list(x) QuerySet >>> reduce(list.__add__, (list(mi) for mi in list_of_menuitems)) >>> [image for mi in list_of_menuitems for image in mi] itertools.chain >>> from itertools import chain
>>> list(chain(*list_of_menuitems)) chain.from_iterable >>> chain = itertools.chain.from_iterable([[1,2],[3],[5,89],[],[6]])

@LINK:/questions/4750806/how-to-install-pip-on-windows
@TITLE:How to install pip on Windows?
@CONTENT:How should pip be installed on Windows? Summary of the answers: Depending on your Python version and whether you want to use it inside a virtual environment or not: Starting from Python versions 2.7.9 and 3.4.0, pip is already included in the regular install, see matth's answer below. Check if the path to the Scripts directory inside your Python installation directory is contained in your system's PATH environment variable, so pip can be found. A very straightforward approach (as of March 2014) for many other setups is to follow these instructions from pip.pypa.io, namely download get-pip.py and run python get-pip.py (may require admin access). Note that pip.exe will be placed inside your Python installation's Scripts folder, which is likely not on your path (fix that by running C:\PythonNN\Tools\Scripts\win_add2path.py, replacing C:\PythonNN\ with your python install directory). You can install and use pip inside a virtual environment. And again, if you install a recent Python 3.4 VENV or later, pip will most likely already be included. If it is not available there, you can run python get-pip.py inside the virtual environment, see above. See also thegauraw's answer below. Alternative ways: There are also windows installers available for pip and distribute, built by David Fraser, see his answer below: http://stackoverflow.com/a/11311788/362951 If you are an ActivePython user, see Rafe Kettler's answer below. If you are a chocolatey user, which is an apt-get like packaging system on windows, you can try Martin Redola's answer here .

@TITLE:How ListView's recycling mechanism works
@CONTENT:So I have this problem I had before, and naturally I asked for help on here. Luksprog's answer was great because I had no idea about how ListView and GridView optimized itself with recycling Views. So with his advice I was able to change how I added Views to my GridView. Problem is now I have something that does not make sense. This is my getView from my BaseAdapter: public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent) {
        if(convertView == null) {
            LayoutInflater inflater = LayoutInflater.from(parent.getContext());
            convertView = inflater.inflate(R.layout.day_view_item, parent, false);
        }
        Log.d("DayViewActivity", "Position is: "+position);
        ((TextView)convertView.findViewById(R.id.day_hour_side)).setText(array[position]);
        LinearLayout layout = (LinearLayout)convertView.findViewById(R.id.day_event_layout);

        //layout.addView(new EventFrame(parent.getContext()));

        TextView create = new TextView(DayViewActivity.this);
        LinearLayout.LayoutParams params = new LinearLayout.LayoutParams(0, (int)TypedValue.applyDimension(TypedValue.COMPLEX_UNIT_DIP, 62, getResources().getDisplayMetrics()), 1.0f);
        params.topMargin = (int)TypedValue.applyDimension(TypedValue.COMPLEX_UNIT_DIP, 1, getResources().getDisplayMetrics());
        params.bottomMargin = (int)TypedValue.applyDimension(TypedValue.COMPLEX_UNIT_DIP, 1, getResources().getDisplayMetrics());
        create.setLayoutParams(params);
        create.setBackgroundColor(Color.BLUE);
        create.setText("Test"); 
        //the following is my original LinearLayout.LayoutParams for correctly setting the TextView Height
        //new LinearLayout.LayoutParams(0, (int)TypedValue.applyDimension(TypedValue.COMPLEX_UNIT_DIP, 60, getResources().getDisplayMetrics()), 1.0f)   
        if(position == 0) {
            Log.d("DayViewActivity", "This should only be running when position is 0. The position is: "+position);
            layout.addView(create);
        }

        return convertView;
    }

}
 Problem is when I scroll, this happens, and not on position 0... Looks like position 6 and position 8, plus it puts two in position 8. Now I am still trying to get the hang of using ListView and GridView so I do not understand why this is happening. One of the main reasons I am making this question is to help others who probably don't know about ListView and GridView's recycling View, or the way this article puts it, ScrapView mechanism. Later Edit Adding link to a google IO talk that is basically all you need to understand how ListView works. Link was dead in on of the comments. So user3427079 was nice enough to update that link. Here it is for easy access.

        Log.d("DayViewActivity", "Position is: "+position);
        ((TextView)convertView.findViewById(R.id.day_hour_side)).setText(array[position]);

@TITLE:Can I use multiple versions of jQuery on the same page?
@CONTENT:A project I'm working on requires the use of jQuery on customers' Web pages. Customers will insert a chunk of code that we'll supply which includes a few <script> elements that build a widget in a <script>-created <iframe>. If they aren't already using the latest version of jQuery, this will also include (most likely) a <script> for Google's hosted version of jQuery. The problem is that some customers may already have an older version of jQuery installed. While this may work if it's at least a fairly recent version, our code does rely on some recently introduced functionality in the jQuery library, so there are bound to be instances when a customer's jQuery version is just too old. We can't require that they upgrade to the latest version of jQuery. Is there any way to load a newer version of jQuery to use only within the context of our code, that will not interfere with, or affect, any code on the customer's page? Ideally, maybe we could check for the presence of jQuery, detect the version, and if it's too old, then somehow load the most recent version just to use for our code. I had the idea of loading jQuery in an <iframe> in the customer's domain that also includes our <script>, which seems like it might be feasible, but I'm hoping there's a more elegant way to do it (not to mention without the performance and complexity penalties of extra <iframe>s).

 1   'Node 1'            0      10
 2   'Node 1.1'          1      10

 5   'Node 2.1'          3      10
 6   'Node 1.2'          1      20
 Here's a diagram, where we have [id] Name. Root node 0 is fictional. 
                       [0] ROOT
                          /    \ 
              [1] Node 1          [3] Node 2

          /          
 [4] Node 1.1.1
 What minimalistic approach would you use to output that to HTML (or text, for that matter) as a correctly ordered, correctly indented tree? Assume further you only have basic data structures (arrays and hashmaps), no fancy objects with parent/children references, no ORM, no framework, just your two hands. The table is represented as a result set, which can be accessed randomly. Pseudo code or plain English is okay, this is purely a conceptional question. Bonus question: Is there a fundamentally better way to store a tree structure like this in a RDBMS? EDITS AND ADDITIONS To answer one commenter's (Mark Bessey's) question: A root node is not necessary, because it is never going to be displayed anyway. ParentId = 0 is the convention to express "these are top level". The Order column defines how nodes with the same parent are going to be sorted. The "result set" I spoke of can be pictured as an array of hashmaps (to stay in that terminology). For my example was meant to be already there. Some answers go the extra mile and construct it first, but thats okay. The tree can be arbitrarily deep. Each node can have N children. I did not exactly have a "millions of entries" tree in mind, though. Don't mistake my choice of node naming ('Node 1.1.1') for something to rely on. The nodes could equally well be called 'Frank' or 'Bob', no naming structure is implied, this was merely to make it readable. I have posted my own solution so you guys can pull it to pieces.
@CODE:Id   Name         ParentId   Order
 1   'Node 1'            0      10
 2   'Node 1.1'          1      10

This is happening for the double called price and the Price called priceObject. Do you know why I get this problem. I do not understand why I need to have a final declaration. Also if you can see what it is I am trying to do, what do I have to do to get around this problem. public static void main(String args[]) {

    int period = 2000;
    int delay = 2000;

    double lastPrice = 0;
    Price priceObject = new Price();
    double price = 0;

    timer.scheduleAtFixedRate(new TimerTask() {

@CONTENT:I want to manipulate a Microsoft Access database (.accdb or .mdb file) from my Java project. I don't want to use the JDBC-ODBC Bridge and the Access ODBC driver from Microsoft because: the JDBC-ODBC Bridge has been removed from Java SE 8 and is not supported (ref: here), the JDBC-ODBC Bridge does not work properly with the Access ODBC driver when text includes Unicode characters with code points above U+00FF (ref: here), so such a setup would not be able to handle characters such as Greek, Russian, Chinese, Arabic, etc., the Access ODBC driver from Microsoft only works in Windows, and there are separate 32-bit and 64-bit versions of the Access Database Engine (and ODBC driver) which can be a nuisance for deployment. I have seen other answers mentioning a JDBC driver for Access databases named UCanAccess. How can I set up my Java project to use this approach?

@TITLE:In Java, what is the best way to determine the size of an object?
@CONTENT:For example, let's say I have an application that can read in a CSV file with piles of data rows. I give the user a summary of the number of rows based on types of data, but I want to make sure that I don't read in too many rows of data and cause OutOfMemoryErrors. Each row translates into an object. Is there an easy way to find out the size of that object programmatically? Is there a reference that defines how large primitive types and object references are for a VM? Right now, I have code that says read up to 32,000 rows, but I'd also like to have code that says read as many rows as possible until I've used 32MB of memory. Maybe that is a different question, but I'd still like to know.

@TITLE:Most vexing parse: why doesn't A a(()); work?
@CONTENT:Among the many things Stack Overflow has taught me is what is known as the "most vexing parse", which is classically demonstrated with a line such as A a(B()); //declares a function
 While this, for most, intuitively appears to be the declaration of an object a of type A, taking a temporary B object as a constructor parameter, it's actually a declaration of a function a returning an A, taking a pointer to a function which returns B and itself takes no parameters. Similarly the line A a(); //declares a function
 also falls under the same category, since instead of an object, it declares a function. Now, in the first case, the usual workaround for this issue is to add an extra set of brackets/parenthesis around the B(), as the compiler will then interpret it as the declaration of an object A a((B())); //declares an object
 However, in the second case, doing the same leads to a compile error A a(()); //compile error
 My question is, why? Yes I'm very well aware that the correct 'workaround' is to change it to A a;, but I'm curious to know what it is that the extra () does for the compiler in the first example which then doesn't work when reapplying it in the second example. Is the A a((B())); workaround a specific exception written into the standard?
@CODE:A a(B()); //declares a function a A B a A B A a(); //declares a function B() A a((B())); //declares an object A a(()); //compile error A a; () A a((B())); (B()) () B() A a(((((((((B()))))))))); A a(); A a();

I give a specific example to show my meaning but prefer a general answer I can 100% understand so I can reuse it in other situations. Example I want to match five digits using \b\d{5}\b but not in three situations s1 s2 s3: s1: Not on a line that ends with a period like this sentence. s2: Not anywhere inside parens. s3: Not inside a block that starts with if( and ends with //endif I know how to solve any one of s1 s2 s3 with a lookahead and lookbehind, especially in C# lookbehind or \K in PHP. For instance s1 (?m)(?!\d+.*?\.$)\d+ s3 with C# lookbehind (?<!if\(\D*(?=\d+.*?//endif))\b\d+\b s3 with PHP \K (?:(?:if\(.*?//endif)\D*)*\K\d+ But the mix of conditions together makes my head explode. Even more bad news is that I may need to add other conditions s4 s5 at another time. The good news is, I don't care if I process the files using most common languages like PHP, C#, Python or my neighbor's washing machine. :) I'm pretty much a beginner in Python & Java but interested to learn if it has a solution. So I came here to see if someone think of a flexible recipe. Hints are okay: you don't need to give me full code. :) Thank you.

@TITLE:Why is setTimeout(fn, 0) sometimes useful?
@CONTENT:I've recently run into a rather nasty bug, wherein the code was loading a <select> dynamically via JavaScript. This dynamically loaded <select> had a pre-selected value. In IE6, we already had code to fix the selected <option>, because sometimes the <select>'s selectedIndex value would be out of sync with the selected <option>'s index attribute, as below: field.selectedIndex = element.index;
 However, this code wasn't working. Even though the field's selectedIndex was being set correctly, the wrong index would end up being selected. However, if I stuck an alert() statement in at the right time, the correct option would be selected. Thinking this might be some sort of timing issue, I tried something random that I'd seen in code before: var wrapFn = (function() {
    var myField = field;
    var myElement = element;

    return function() {
        myField.selectedIndex = myElement.index;
    }
})();
setTimeout(wrapFn, 0);
 And this worked! I've got a solution for my problem, but I'm uneasy that I don't know exactly why this fixes my problem. Does anyone have an official explanation? What browser issue am I avoiding by calling my function "later" using setTimeout()?
@CODE:<select> <select> <option> <select> selectedIndex <option> index field.selectedIndex = element.index; selectedIndex alert() var wrapFn = (function() {

@TITLE:Are self-closing tags valid in HTML5?
@CONTENT:The W3C validator doesn't like self-closing tags (those that end with "/>") on non void elements (those that may not ever contain any content). Are they still valid in HTML5? Some examples of accepted void elements would be: <br />
<img src="" />
<input type="text" name="username" />
 Some examples of rejected non-void elements would be: <div id="myDiv" />
<span id="mySpan" />
<textarea id="someTextMessage" />
 Note: the W3C validator actually accepts void self-closing tags: the author originally had a problem because of a simple typo (\> instead of />). However, self-closing tags are not 100% valid in HTML5 in general, and the answers elaborate on the issue of self-closing tags across various HTML flavors.

Please discuss the technical differences as well as reasons for choosing one or the other in OO design. I'll start with an obvious difference: If you don't specify public: or private:, members of a struct are public by default; members of a class are private by default. I'm sure there are other differences to be found in the obscure corners of the C++ specification.

@TITLE:Python's ¡§is¡¨ operator behaves unexpectedly with integers
@CONTENT:Why does the following behave unexpectedly in Python? >>> a = 256
>>> b = 256
>>> a is b
True           # This is an expected result
>>> a = 257

>>> a is b
False          # What happened here? Why is this False?
>>> 257 is 257
True           # Yet the literal numbers compare properly
 I am using Python 2.5.2. Trying some different versions of Python, it appears that Python 2.3.3 shows the above behaviour between 99 and 100. Based on the above, I can hypothesise that Python is internally implemented such that "small" integers are stored in a different way than larger integers, and the is operator can tell the difference. Why the leaky abstraction? What is a better way of comparing two arbitrary objects to see whether they are the same, and I don't know in advance whether they are numbers or not?
@CODE:>>> a = 256
>>> b = 256
>>> a is b
True           # This is an expected result
>>> a = 257
>>> b = 257
>>> a is b
False          # What happened here? Why is this False?
>>> 257 is 257
True           # Yet the literal numbers compare properly is a = 256; b = 256 a = 257; b = a a = b = 257 === '1' == 1 False

Many of our existing apps are tightly dependent on this property for uniquely identifying a particular device. Can anyone suggest any ideas how we might handle this problem going forward? The suggestion from the documentation is... Special Considerations Do not use the uniqueIdentifier property. To create a unique identifier specific to your app, you can call the CFUUIDCreate function to create a UUID, and write it to the defaults database using the NSUserDefaults class. However this value won't be the same if a user uninstalls and re-installs the app.

I've tried multiple examples: RenderPartial to String in ASP.NET MVC Beta If I use this example, I receive the "Cannot redirect after HTTP headers have been sent.". MVC Framework: Capturing the output of a view If I use this, I seem to be unable to do a redirectToAction, as it tries to render a view that may not exist. If I do return the view, it is completely messed up and doesn't look right at all. Does anyone have any ideas/solutions to these issues i have, or have any suggestions for better ones? Many thanks! Below is an example. What I'm trying to do is create the GetViewForEmail method: public ActionResult OrderResult(string ref)
{
  //Get the order
  Order order = OrderService.GetOrder(ref);

  //The email helper would do the meat and veg by getting the view as a string
  //Pass the control name (OrderResultEmail) and the model (order)
  string emailView = GetViewForEmail("OrderResultEmail", order);

  //Email the order out
  EmailHelper(order, emailView);
  return View("OrderResult", order);
}
 Accepted answer from Tim Scott (changed and formatted a little by me): public virtual string RenderViewToString(
  ControllerContext controllerContext,
  string viewPath,
  string masterPath,
  ViewDataDictionary viewData,
  TempDataDictionary tempData)
{
  Stream filter = null;
  ViewPage viewPage = new ViewPage();

  //Right, create our view
  viewPage.ViewContext = new ViewContext(controllerContext, new WebFormView(viewPath, masterPath), viewData, tempData);

  //Get the response context, flush it and get the response filter.
  var response = viewPage.ViewContext.HttpContext.Response;
  response.Flush();
  var oldFilter = response.Filter;

  try
  {
      //Put a new filter into the response
      filter = new MemoryStream();
      response.Filter = filter;

      //Now render the view into the memorystream and flush the response
      viewPage.ViewContext.View.Render(viewPage.ViewContext, viewPage.ViewContext.HttpContext.Response.Output);
      response.Flush();

      //Now read the rendered view.
      filter.Position = 0;
      var reader = new StreamReader(filter, response.ContentEncoding);
      return reader.ReadToEnd();
  }
  finally
  {
      //Clean up.
      if (filter != null)
      {
        filter.Dispose();
      }

      //Now replace the response filter
      response.Filter = oldFilter;
  }
}

@TITLE:How can I read and parse CSV files in C++?
@CONTENT:I need to load and use CSV file data in C++. At this point it can really just be a comma-delimited parser (ie don't worry about escaping new lines and commas). The main need is a line-by-line parser that will return a vector for the next line each time the method is called. I found this article which looks quite promising: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_35_0/libs/spirit/example/fundamental/list_parser.cpp I've never used Boost's Spirit, but am willing to try it. But only if there isn't a more straightforward solution I'm overlooking.

@TITLE:Events triggered by dynamically generated element are not captured by event handler
@CONTENT:I have a <div> with id="modal" generated dynamically with the jQuery load() method: $('#modal').load('handlers/word.edit.php');
 word.edit.php contains a few input element, which are loaded into a modal <div>. Using jQuery's keyup method I can capture the input values after an event fires, but when the elements are added dynamically to the modal div, the event no llonger fires when the user enters their text. Which jQuery method supports handling events triggered by dynamically created elements? The code for creating the new input elements is: $('#add').click(function() {
    $('<input id="'+i+'" type="text" name="translations' + i + '"  />')
      .appendTo('#modal');
 The code for capturing the user's values is: $('input').keyup(function() {
    handler = $(this).val();
    name = $(this).attr('name');
 This second code block seems to work for the original elements, but it is not fired by the new dynamically generated elements.
@CODE:<div> id="modal" load() $('#modal').load('handlers/word.edit.php'); word.edit.php <div> keyup $('#add').click(function() {

@TITLE:GOTO still considered harmful? [closed]
@CONTENT:Everyone is aware of Dijkstra's Letters to the editor: go to statement considered harmful (also here .html transcript and here .pdf) and there has been a formidable push since that time to eschew the goto statement whenever possible. While it's possible to use goto to produce unmaintainable, sprawling code, it nevertheless remains in modern programming languages. Even the advanced continuation control structure in Scheme can be described as a sophisticated goto. What circumstances warrant the use of goto? When is it best to avoid? As a followup question: C provides a pair of functions, setjmp and longjmp, that provide the ability to goto not just within the current stack frame but within any of the calling frames. Should these be considered as dangerous as goto? More dangerous? Dijkstra himself regretted that title, for which he was not responsible. At the end of EWD1308 (also here .pdf) he wrote: Finally a short story for the record. In 1968, the Communications of the ACM published a text of mine under the title "The goto statement considered harmful", which in later years would be most frequently referenced, regrettably, however, often by authors who had seen no more of it than its title, which became a cornerstone of my fame by becoming a template: we would see all sorts of articles under the title "X considered harmful" for almost any X, including one titled "Dijkstra considered harmful". But what had happened? I had submitted a paper under the title "A case against the goto statement", which, in order to speed up its publication, the editor had changed into a "letter to the Editor", and in the process he had given it a new title of his own invention! The editor was Niklaus Wirth. A well thought out classic paper about this topic, to be matched to that of Dijkstra, is Structured Programming with go to Statements, by Donald E. Knuth. Reading both helps to reestablish context and a non-dogmatic understanding of the subject. In this paper, Dijkstra's opinion on this case is reported and is even more strong: Donald E. Knuth: I believe that by presenting such a view I am not in fact disagreeing sharply with Dijkstra's ideas, since he recently wrote the following: "Please don't fall into the trap of believing that I am terribly dogmatical about [the go to statement]. I have the uncomfortable feeling that others are making a religion out of it, as if the conceptual problems of programming could be solved by a single trick, by a simple form of coding discipline!"

@CONTENT:I am trying to use std::regex in a C++11 piece of code, but it appears that the support is a bit buggy. An example: #include <regex>
#include <iostream>

int main (int argc, const char * argv[]) {

    std::cerr << "st|mt|tr" << " matches tr? " << std::regex_match("tr", r) << std::endl;
}
 outputs: st|mt|tr matches st? 1
st|mt|tr matches mt? 1
st|mt|tr matches tr? 0
 when compiled with gcc (MacPorts gcc47 4.7.1_2) 4.7.1, either with g++ *.cc -o test -std=c++11
g++ *.cc -o test -std=c++0x
 or g++ *.cc -o test -std=gnu++0x
 Besides, the regex works well if I only have two alternative patterns, e.g. st|mt, so it looks like the last one is not matched for some reasons. The code works well with the Apple LLVM compiler. Any ideas about how to solve the issue? Update one possible solution is to use groups to implement multiple alternatives, e.g. (st|mt)|tr.
@CODE:#include <regex>
#include <iostream>

int main (int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    std::regex r("st|mt|tr");

Note: I am writing this as I would like to be able to link to a well written guide on the numerous questions that I constantly come across in the PHP queue, so I can link to this for further detail when I post an answer.

@TITLE:Converting timestamp to time ago in PHP e.g 1 day ago, 2 days ago¡K
@CONTENT:I am trying to convert a timestamp of the format 2009-09-12 20:57:19 and turn it into something like 3 minutes ago with PHP. I found a useful script to do this, but I think it's looking for a different format to be used as the time variable. The script I'm wanting to modify to work with this format is: function _ago($tm,$rcs = 0) {
    $cur_tm = time(); 
    $dif = $cur_tm-$tm;
    $pds = array('second','minute','hour','day','week','month','year','decade');
    $lngh = array(1,60,3600,86400,604800,2630880,31570560,315705600);

    for($v = sizeof($lngh)-1; ($v >= 0)&&(($no = $dif/$lngh[$v])<=1); $v--); if($v < 0) $v = 0; $_tm = $cur_tm-($dif%$lngh[$v]);
        $no = floor($no);
        if($no <> 1)
            $pds[$v] .='s';
        $x = sprintf("%d %s ",$no,$pds[$v]);
        if(($rcs == 1)&&($v >= 1)&&(($cur_tm-$_tm) > 0))
            $x .= time_ago($_tm);
        return $x;
    }
 I think on those first few lines the script is trying to do something that looks like this (different date format math): $dif = 1252809479 - 2009-09-12 20:57:19;
 How would I go about converting my timestamp into that (unix?) format?
@CODE:2009-09-12 20:57:19 3 minutes ago function _ago($tm,$rcs = 0) {
    $cur_tm = time(); 
    $dif = $cur_tm-$tm;
    $pds = array('second','minute','hour','day','week','month','year','decade');
    $lngh = array(1,60,3600,86400,604800,2630880,31570560,315705600);

@CONTENT:I have very large tables (30 million rows) that I would like to load as a dataframes in R. read.table() has a lot of convenient features, but it seems like there is a lot of logic in the implementation that would slow things down. In my case, I am assuming I know the types of the columns ahead of time, the table does not contain any column headers or row names, and does not have any pathological characters that I have to worry about. I know that reading in a table as a list using scan() can be quite fast, e.g.: datalist <- scan('myfile',sep='\t',list(url='',popularity=0,mintime=0,maxtime=0)))

@CONTENT:I have a Python script which takes as input a list of integers, which I need to work with four integers at a time. Unfortunately, I don't have control of the input, or I'd have it passed in as a list of four-element tuples. Currently, I'm iterating over it this way: for i in xrange(0, len(ints), 4):
    # dummy op for example code
    foo += ints[i] * ints[i + 1] + ints[i + 2] * ints[i + 3]
 It looks a lot like "C-think", though, which makes me suspect there's a more pythonic way of dealing with this situation. The list is discarded after iterating, so it needn't be preserved. Perhaps something like this would be better? while ints:
    foo += ints[0] * ints[1] + ints[2] * ints[3]
    ints[0:4] = []

Ideally: when a post back occurs containing HTML restricted characters, that posted value in the Form collection will be automatically HTML encoded. So the .Text property of my text-box will be something & lt; html & gt; Any way I can do this from a handler?
@CODE:< or > An error has occured please go back and re-type your entire form again, but this time please do not use < validateRequest="false" .Text something & lt; html & gt; <script type="text/javascript">alert("Attack!");</script>

@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: Is floating point math broken? 22 answers I need to do some floating point arithmetic in Java as shown in the code below: public class TestMain {

    Double increment(Double i, boolean up) {

 This is to simulate the range of values given as output by the Betfair spinner widget. Floating point arithmetic in Java seems to introduce some unexpected errors. For example, I get 2.180000000000001 instead of 2.18. What use are floating point numbers is you can't trust the results of arithmetic performed on them? How can I get around this issue?

@CONTENT:Well, first I should probably ask if this is browser dependent. I've read that if an invalid token is found, but the section of code is valid until that invalid token, a semicolon is inserted before the token if it is preceded by a line break. However, the common example cited for bugs caused by semicolon insertion is: return
  _a+b;
 which doesn't seem to follow this rule, since _a would be a valid token. On the other hand, breaking up call chains works as expected: $('#myButton')

Having parsed the formula I could convert it into JavaScript and run eval() on it to yield the result. However, I've always shied away from using eval() if I can avoid it because it's evil (and, rightly or wrongly, I've always thought it is even more evil in JavaScript because the code to be evaluated might be changed by the user). Obviously one has to use eval() to parse JSON (I presume that JS libraries use eval() for this somewhere, even if they run the JSON through a regex check first), but when else, other than when manipulating JSON, it is OK to use eval()? As several people have now pointed-out, it's not even necessary to use eval() to parse JSON. So, when is it OK to use it?

Just to note, yes I do have K&R, I have read it too many times to count, and I am aware of C syntax. It has been a while, but I do remember large amounts of it. :) I did see this question, but I did not see any particular resources mentioned, simply some general statements about learning. Thanks!

@TITLE:How to call Objective C code from Swift
@CONTENT:In the new Swift language from Apple, how does one call Objective-C code? Apple mentioned that they could co-exist in one application, but does this mean that one could technically re-use old classes made in Objective-C whilst building new classes in swift? The Reasoning Objective-C is a platform-independent language, whereas Swift is platform-dependent. Writing non-platform-dependent code (business logic libraries) in swift would thus not be wise. However writing platform-dependent code in it (interface related for example) would be perfectly fine. Not to say it would be a good idea, however it is definitely an interest

@TITLE:Trusting all certificates using HttpClient over HTTPS
@CONTENT:Recently posted a question regarding the HttpClient over Https (found here). I've made some headway, but I've run into new issues. As with my last problem, I can't seem to find an example anywhere that works for me. Basically, I want my client to accept any certificate (because I'm only ever pointing to one server) but I keep getting a javax.net.ssl.SSLException: Not trusted server certificate exception. So this is what I have: public void connect() throws A_WHOLE_BUNCH_OF_EXCEPTIONS {

    HttpPost post = new HttpPost(new URI(PROD_URL));
    post.setEntity(new StringEntity(BODY));

    KeyStore trusted = KeyStore.getInstance("BKS");
    trusted.load(null, "".toCharArray());
    SSLSocketFactory sslf = new SSLSocketFactory(trusted);
    sslf.setHostnameVerifier(SSLSocketFactory.ALLOW_ALL_HOSTNAME_VERIFIER);

    SchemeRegistry schemeRegistry = new SchemeRegistry();
    schemeRegistry.register(new Scheme ("https", sslf, 443));
    SingleClientConnManager cm = new SingleClientConnManager(post.getParams(),
            schemeRegistry);

    HttpClient client = new DefaultHttpClient(cm, post.getParams());
    HttpResponse result = client.execute(post);
}
 And here's the error I'm getting: W/System.err(  901): javax.net.ssl.SSLException: Not trusted server certificate

@LINK:/questions/4595964/is-there-a-use-case-for-singletons-with-database-access-in-php
@TITLE:Is there a use-case for singletons with database access in PHP?
@CONTENT:I access my MySQL database via PDO. I'm setting up access to the database, and my first attempt was to use the following: The first thing I thought of is global: $db = new PDO('mysql:host=127.0.0.1;dbname=toto', 'root', 'pwd');

function some_function() {
    global $db;
    $db->query('...');
}
 This is considered a bad practice. After a little search, I ended up with the Singleton pattern, which "applies to situations in which there needs to be a single instance of a class." According to the example in the manual, we should do this: class Database {
    private static $instance, $db;

    private function __construct(){}

    static function singleton() {
        if(!isset(self::$instance))
            self::$instance = new __CLASS__;

        return self:$instance;
    }

    function get() {
        if(!isset(self::$db))
            self::$db = new PDO('mysql:host=127.0.0.1;dbname=toto', 'user', 'pwd')

        return self::$db;
    }
}

function some_function() {
    $db = Database::singleton();
    $db->get()->query('...');
}

some_function();
 Why do I need that relatively large class when I can do this? class Database {
    private static $db;

    private function __construct(){}

    static function get() {
        if(!isset(self::$rand))
            self::$db = new PDO('mysql:host=127.0.0.1;dbname=toto', 'user', 'pwd');

        return self::$db;
    }
}

function some_function() {
    Database::get()->query('...');
}

some_function();
 This last one works perfectly and I don't need to worry about $db anymore. How can I create a smaller singleton class, or is there a use-case for singletons that I'm missing in PHP?
@CODE:global $db = new PDO('mysql:host=127.0.0.1;dbname=toto', 'root', 'pwd');

function some_function() {
    global $db;
    $db->query('...');
} class Database {
    private static $instance, $db;

    private function __construct(){}

    static function singleton() {
        if(!isset(self::$instance))
            self::$instance = new __CLASS__;

        return self:$instance;
    }

    function get() {
        if(!isset(self::$db))
            self::$db = new PDO('mysql:host=127.0.0.1;dbname=toto', 'user', 'pwd')

        return self::$db;
    }
}

function some_function() {
    $db = Database::singleton();
    $db->get()->query('...');
}

some_function(); class Database {
    private static $db;

    private function __construct(){}

    static function get() {
        if(!isset(self::$rand))
            self::$db = new PDO('mysql:host=127.0.0.1;dbname=toto', 'user', 'pwd');

        return self::$db;
    }
}

function some_function() {
    Database::get()->query('...');
}

some_function(); $db

@LINK:/questions/1089018/why-cant-decimal-numbers-be-represented-exactly-in-binary
@TITLE:Why can't decimal numbers be represented exactly in binary?
@CONTENT:There have been several questions posted to SO about floating-point representation. For example, the decimal number 0.1 doesn't have an exact binary representation, so it's dangerous to use the == operator to compare it to another floating-point number. I understand the principles behind floating-point representation. What I don't understand is why, from a mathematical perspective, are the numbers to the right of the decimal point any more "special" that the ones to the left? For example, the number 61.0 has an exact binary representation because the integral portion of any number is always exact. But the number 6.10 is not exact. All I did was move the decimal one place and suddenly I've gone from Exactopia to Inexactville. Mathematically, there should be no intrinsic difference between the two numbers -- they're just numbers. By contrast, if I move the decimal one place in the other direction to produce the number 610, I'm still in Exactopia. I can keep going in that direction (6100, 610000000, 610000000000000) and they're still exact, exact, exact. But as soon as the decimal crosses some threshold, the numbers are no longer exact. What's going on? Edit: to clarify, I want to stay away from discussion about industry-standard representations, such as IEEE, and stick with what I believe is the mathematically "pure" way. In base 10, the positional values are: ... 1000  100   10    1   1/10  1/100 ...
 In binary, they would be: ... 8    4    2    1    1/2  1/4  1/8 ...
 There are also no arbitrary limits placed on these numbers. The positions increase indefinitely to the left and to the right.
@CODE:... 1000  100   10    1   1/10  1/100 ... ... 8    4    2    1    1/2  1/4  1/8 ...

@TITLE:Why is the order in Python dictionaries and sets arbitrary?
@CONTENT:I don't understand how looping over a dictionary or set in python is done by 'arbitrary' order. I mean, it's a programming language so everything in the language must be 100% determined, correct? Python must have some kind of algorithm that decides which part of the dictionary or set is chosen, 1st, second and so on. What am I missing?

 I know there are various ways of doing this in SQL Server 2000 / 2005 / 2008. I am particularly interested in this sort of method that uses the aggregating-set-statement trick: INSERT INTO @AnotherTbl(id, somedate, somevalue, runningtotal) 
   SELECT id, somedate, somevalue, null
   FROM TestTable
   ORDER BY somedate

DECLARE @RunningTotal int
SET @RunningTotal = 0

UPDATE @AnotherTbl
SET @RunningTotal = runningtotal = @RunningTotal + somevalue
FROM @AnotherTbl
 ... this is very efficient but I have heard there are issues around this because you can't necessarily guarantee that the UPDATE statement will process the rows in the correct order. Maybe we can get some definitive answers about that issue. But maybe there are other ways that people can suggest? edit: Now with a SqlFiddle with the setup and the 'update trick' example above

@TITLE:Format a Microsoft JSON date?
@CONTENT:I'm taking my first crack at Ajax with jQuery. I'm getting my data onto my page, but I'm having some trouble with the JSON data that is returned for Date data types. Basically, I'm getting a string back that looks like this: /Date(1224043200000)/
 From someone totally new to JSON - How do I format this to a short date format? Should this be handled somewhere in the jQuery code? I've tried the jQuery.UI.datepicker plugin using $.datepicker.formatDate() without any success. FYI: Here's the solution I came up with using a combination of the answers here: function getMismatch(id) {
  $.getJSON("Main.aspx?Callback=GetMismatch", 
    { MismatchId: id },

    function (result) {
      $("#AuthMerchId").text(result.AuthorizationMerchantId);
      $("#SttlMerchId").text(result.SettlementMerchantId);
      $("#CreateDate").text(formatJSONDate(Date(result.AppendDts)));
      $("#ExpireDate").text(formatJSONDate(Date(result.ExpiresDts)));
      $("#LastUpdate").text(formatJSONDate(Date(result.LastUpdateDts)));
      $("#LastUpdatedBy").text(result.LastUpdateNt);
      $("#ProcessIn").text(result.ProcessIn);
    }
  );

  return false;
}

function formatJSONDate(jsonDate) {
  var newDate = dateFormat(jsonDate, "mm/dd/yyyy");
  return newDate;
}
 This solution got my object from the callback method and displayed the dates on the page properly using the date format library.
@CODE:/Date(1224043200000)/ jQuery.UI.datepicker $.datepicker.formatDate() function getMismatch(id) {
  $.getJSON("Main.aspx?Callback=GetMismatch",

      $("#SttlMerchId").text(result.SettlementMerchantId);
      $("#CreateDate").text(formatJSONDate(Date(result.AppendDts)));
      $("#ExpireDate").text(formatJSONDate(Date(result.ExpiresDts)));
      $("#LastUpdate").text(formatJSONDate(Date(result.LastUpdateDts)));
      $("#LastUpdatedBy").text(result.LastUpdateNt);

@LINK:/questions/538060/proper-use-of-the-idisposable-interface
@TITLE:Proper use of the IDisposable interface
@CONTENT:I know from reading the MSDN documentation that the "primary" use of the IDisposable interface is to clean up unmanaged resources. To me, "unmanaged" means things like database connections, sockets, window handles, etc. But, I've seen code where the Dispose method is implemented to free managed resources, which seems redundant to me, since the garbage collector should take care of that for you. For example: public class MyCollection : IDisposable
{
    private List<String> _theList = new List<String>();
    private Dictionary<String, Point> _theDict = new Dictionary<String, Point>();

    // Die, clear it up! (free unmanaged resources)
    public void Dispose()
    {
        _theList.clear();
        _theDict.clear();
        _theList = null;
        _theDict = null;
    }
 My question is, does this make the garbage collector free memory used by MyCollection any faster than it normally would? edit: So far people have posted some good examples of using IDisposable to clean up unmanaged resources such as database connections and bitmaps. But suppose that _theList in the above code contained a million strings, and you wanted to free that memory now, rather than waiting for the garbage collector. Would the above code accomplish that?
@CODE:public class MyCollection : IDisposable
{
    private List<String> _theList = new List<String>();
    private Dictionary<String, Point> _theDict = new Dictionary<String, Point>();

    // Die, clear it up! (free unmanaged resources)
    public void Dispose()
    {
        _theList.clear();
        _theDict.clear();
        _theList = null;
        _theDict = null;

@TITLE:What are the Options for Storing Hierarchical Data in a Relational Database?
@CONTENT:Good Overviews Generally speaking you're making a decision between fast read times (e.g. nested set) or fast write times (adjacency list). Usually you end up with a combination of the options below that best fit your needs. The following provides some in depth reading: One more Nested Intervals vs. Adjacency List comparison: the best comparison of Adjacency List, Materialized Path, Nested Set and Nested Interval I've found. Models for hierarchical data: slides with good explanations of tradeoffs and example usage Representing hierarchies in MySQL: very good overview of Nested Set in particular Hierarchical data in RDBMSs: most comprehensive and well organized set of links I've seen, but not much in the way on explanation Options Ones I am aware of and general features: Adjacency List: Columns: ID, ParentID Easy to implement. Cheap node moves, inserts, and deletes. Expensive to find level (can store as a computed column), ancestry & descendants (Bridge Table combined with level column can solve), path (Lineage Column can solve). Use Common Table Expressions in those databases that support them to traverse. Nested Set (a.k.a Modified Preorder Tree Traversal) Popularized by Joe Celko in numerous articles and his book Trees and Hierarchies in SQL for Smarties Columns: Left, Right Cheap level, ancestry, descendants Compared to Adjacency List, moves, inserts, deletes more expensive. Requires a specific sort order (e.g. created). So sorting all descendants in a different order requires additional work. Nested Intervals Combination of Nested Sets and Materialized Path where left/right columns are floating point decimals instead of integers and encode the path information. In the later development of this idea nested intervals gave rise to matrix encoding. Bridge Table (a.k.a. Closure Table: some good ideas about how to use triggers for maintaining this approach) Columns: ancestor, descendant Stands apart from table it describes. Can include some nodes in more than one hierarchy. Cheap ancestry and descendants (albeit not in what order) For complete knowledge of a hierarchy needs to be combined with another option. Flat Table A modification of the Adjacency List that adds a Level and Rank (e.g. ordering) column to each record. Expensive move and delete Cheap ancestry and descendants Good Use: threaded discussion - forums / blog comments Lineage Column (a.k.a. Materialized Path, Path Enumeration) Column: lineage (e.g. /parent/child/grandchild/etc...) Limit to how deep the hierarchy can be. Descendants cheap (e.g. LEFT(lineage, #) = '/enumerated/path') Ancestry tricky (database specific queries) Multiple lineage columns Columns: one for each lineage level, refers to all the parents up to the root, levels down from the items level are set to NULL Limit to how deep the hierarchy can be Cheap ancestors, descendants, level Cheap insert, delete, move of the leaves Expensive insert, delete, move of the internal nodes Database Specific Notes MySQL Use session variables for Adjacency List Oracle Use CONNECT BY to traverse Adjacency Lists PostgreSQL ltree datatype for Materialized Path SQL Server General summary 2008 offers HierarchyId data type appears to help with Lineage Column approach and expand the depth that can be represented.

@TITLE:Can I embed a custom font in an iPhone application?
@CONTENT:This question relates to iOS pre-3.2. As of 3.2 this functionality is easily achievable using samvermette's answer below, and I have changed the Accepted Answer (from commanda to samvermette) to reflect this. I can't give credit to both answers (besides uproots) but they are both good. I would like to have an app include a custom font for rendering text, load it, and then use it with standard UIKit elements like UILabel. Is this possible? I found these links: http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=8304744 http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=569311 but these would require me to render each glyph myself, which is a bit too much like hard work, especially for multi-line text. I've also found posts that say straight out that it's not possible, but without justification, so I'm looking for a definitive answer. EDIT - failed -[UIFont fontWithName:size:] experiment I downloaded Harrowprint.tff (downloaded from here) and added it to my Resources directory and to the project. I then tried this code: UIFont* font = [UIFont fontWithName:@"Harrowprint" size:20];
 which resulted in an exception being thrown. Looking at the TTF file in Finder confirmed that the font name was Harrowprint. EDIT - there have been a number of replies so far which tell me to read the documentation on X or Y. I've experimented extensively with all of these, and got nowhere. In one case, X turned out to be relevant only on OS X, not on iPhone. Consequently I am setting a bounty for this question, and I will award the bounty to the first person who provides an answer (using only documented APIs) who responds with sufficient information to get this working on the device. Working on the simulator too would be a bonus. EDIT - it appears that the bounty auto-awards to the answer with the highest number of votes. Interesting. No one actually provided an answer that solved the question as asked - the solution that involves coding your own UILabel subclass doesn't support word-wrap, which is an essential feature for me - though I guess I could extend it to do so.

int varc = vara / varb;
int vard = 7;
 I would expect that VS breaks and shows an unhandled exception message at the second line. However, what happens is that the third line is just skipped without any message and the application keeps running. I don't have this problem with my existing C# projects. So I guess that my new projects are created with some strange default settings. Does anyone have an idea what's wrong with my project??? I tried checking the boxes in Debug->Exceptions. But then executions breaks even if I handle the exception in a try-catch block; which is also not what I want. If I remember correctly, there was a column called "unhandled exceptions" or something like this in this dialog box, which would do excatly what I want. But in my projects there is only one column ("Thrown").

@CONTENT:On the subject of associating your iPhone app with file types. In this informative question I learned that apps could be associated with custom URL protocols. That was almost one year ago and since then Apple introduced 'Document Support' which goes a step further and allows apps to associate with file types. There is a lot of talk in the documentation about how to set up your app to launch other appropriate apps when it encounters an unknown file type. This means the association doesn't work out of the box for any app, like the URL protocol registering did. This leads me to the question: have system apps like Safari or Mail implemented this system for choosing associated applications, or will they do nothing, as before?

I'm sure I just have the wrong terminology. Basically, I want to take two quantities - completed, and total - and divide them to come up with a percentage (of how much has been completed). The quantities are longs. Here's the setup: long completed = 25000;
long total = 50000;

System.out.println(completed/total);  // Prints 0
 I've tried reassigning the result to a double - it prints 0.0. Where am I going wrong? Incidentally, the next step is to multiply this result by 100, which I assume should be easy once this small hurdle is stepped over. BTW not homework here just plain old numskull-ness (and maybe too much coding today).

@CONTENT:Whenever I want to do something "map"py in R, I usually try to use a function in the apply family. (Side question: I still haven't learned plyr or reshape -- would plyr or reshape replace all of these entirely?) However, I've never quite understood the differences between them [how {sapply, lapply, etc.} apply the function to the input/grouped input, what the output will look like, or even what the input can be], so I often just go through them all until I get what I want. Can someone explain how to use which one when? [My current (probably incorrect/incomplete) understanding is... sapply(vec, f): input is a vector. output is a vector/matrix, where element i is f(vec[i]) [giving you a matrix if f has a multi-element output] lapply(vec, f): same as sapply, but output is a list? apply(matrix, 1/2, f): input is a matrix. output is a vector, where element i is f(row/col i of the matrix) tapply(vector, grouping, f): output is a matrix/array, where an element in the matrix/array is the value of f at a grouping g of the vector, and g gets pushed to the row/col names by(dataframe, grouping, f): let g be a grouping. apply f to each column of the group/dataframe. pretty print the grouping and the value of f at each column. aggregate(matrix, grouping, f): similar to by, but instead of pretty printing the output, aggregate sticks everything into a dataframe.]

@CONTENT:There has been a lot of posting about what these two contexts are.. But I'm still not getting it quite right As I understand it so far: Each is an instance of its class which means that some programmers recommend you to use this.getApplicationContext() as often as possible in order to not "leak" out any memory. This is because the other this (getting the Activity instance context) points to an Activity that is being destroyed each time the user tilts the phone or leave the app etc.. Which apparently the Garbage Collector (GC) doesn't catch and therefore uses too much memory.. But can anyone please come up with some really good coding examples where it would be the right thing to use this (getting the context of the current Activity instance) and the application context will be useless/wrong?

@TITLE:Make a div fill the height of the remaining screen space
@CONTENT:I am currently working on a web application, where I want the content to fill the height of the entire screen. The page has a header, which contains a logo, and account information. This could be an arbitrary height. I want the content div to fill the rest of the page to the bottom. I have a header div and a content div. At the moment I am using a table for the layout like so: CSS and HTML #page {
    height: 100%; width: 100%
}

#tdcontent {
    height: 100%;
}

#content {
    overflow: auto; /* or overflow: hidden; */
} <table id="page">
    <tr>
        <td id="tdheader">
            <div id="header">...</div>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td id="tdcontent">
            <div id="content">...</div>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table> The entire height of the page is filled, and no scrolling is required. For anything inside the content div, setting top: 0; will put it right underneath the header. Sometimes the content will be a real table, with it's height set to 100%. Putting header inside content will not allow this to work. Is there a way to achieve the same effect without using the table? Update: Elements inside the content div will have heights set to percentages as well. So something at 100% inside the div will fill it to the bottom. As will two elements at 50%. Update 2: For instance, if the header takes up 20% of the screen's height, a table specified at 50% inside #content would take up 40% of the screen space. So far, wrapping the entire thing in a table is the only thing that works.
@CODE:div div #page {
    height: 100%; width: 100%
}

#tdcontent {

I couldn't have phrased it better than the person that posted the same question here: http://www.experts-exchange.com/Programming/Programming_Languages/Java/Q_21062554.html But to keep it original, I'll phrase it my own way: suppose I have a string "00A0BF" that I would like interpreted as the byte[] {0x00,0xA0,0xBf} what should I do? I am a Java novice and ended up using BigInteger and watching out for leading hex zeros. But I think it is ugly and I am sure I am missing something simple...

@CONTENT:I'm looking for an optimal way to resize wrapping text in a TextView so that it will fit within its getHeight and getWidth bounds. I'm not simply looking for a way to wrap the text- I want to make sure it both wraps and is small enough to fit entirely on the screen. I've seen a few cases on StackOverflow where auto resizing was needed, but they are either very special cases with hack solutions, have no solution, or involve re-drawing the TextView recursively until it is small enough (which is memory intense and forces the user to watch the text shrink step-by-step with every recursion). But I'm sure somebody out there has found a good solution that doesn't involve what I'm doing: writing several heavy routines that parse and measure the text, resize the text, and repeat until a suitably small size has been found. What routines does TextView use to wrap the text? Couldn't those be somehow used to predict whether text will be small enough? tl;dr: is there a best-practice way to auto-resize a TextView to fit, wrapped, in its getHeight and getWidth bounds?

Earlier I was using one Servlet per options like Servlet1 for add entity1, Servlet2 for edit entity1 and so on and in this way we ended up having a large number of servlets. Now we are changing our design. My question is how you exactly choose how you choose the responsibility of a servlet. Should we have one Servlet per entity which will process all it's options and forward request to service layer.Or should we have one servlet for the whole page which will process the whole page request and then forward it to corresponding service layer.Also should the request object forwarded to service layer or not. Please you guide us in choosing the best design.Also any pointer to a good design pattern material will be welcome.

@TITLE:What is the JSF resource library for and how should it be used?
@CONTENT:The JSF <h:outputStylesheet>, <h:outputScript> and <h:graphicImage> components have a library attribute. What is this and how should this be used? There are a lot of examples on the web which use it as follows with the common content/file type css, js and img (or image) as library name depending on the tag used: <h:outputStylesheet library="css" name="style.css" />
<h:outputScript library="js" name="script.js" />
<h:graphicImage library="img" name="logo.png" />
 How is it useful? The library value in those examples seems to be just repeating whatever is already been represented by the tag name. For a <h:outputStylesheet> it's based on the tag name already obvious that it represents a "CSS library". What's the difference with the following which also just works the same way? <h:outputStylesheet name="css/style.css" />
<h:outputScript name="js/script.js" />
<h:graphicImage name="img/logo.png" />
 Also, the generated HTML output is a bit different. Given a context path of /contextname and FacesServlet mapping on an URL pattern of *.xhtml, the former generates the following HTML with the library name as request parameter: <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/contextname/javax.faces.resource/style.css.xhtml?ln=css" />
<script type="text/javascript" src="/contextname/javax.faces.resource/script.js.xhtml?ln=js"></script>
<img src="/contextname/javax.faces.resource/logo.png.xhtml?ln=img" alt="" />
 While the latter generates the following HTML with the library name just in the path of the URI: <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/contextname/javax.faces.resource/css/style.css.xhtml" />
<script type="text/javascript" src="/contextname/javax.faces.resource/js/script.js.xhtml"></script>
<img src="/contextname/javax.faces.resource/img/logo.png.xhtml" alt="" />
 The latter approach makes in hindsight also more sense than the former approach. How exactly is the library attribute then useful?
@CODE:<h:outputStylesheet> <h:outputScript> <h:graphicImage> library css js img image <h:outputStylesheet library="css" name="style.css" />

The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers to an already existing resource, the enclosed entity SHOULD be considered as a modified version of the one residing on the origin server. If the Request-URI does not point to an existing resource, and that URI is capable of being defined as a new resource by the requesting user agent, the origin server can create the resource with that URI." That is, PUT is used to create or update. So, which one should be used to create a resource? Or one needs to support both?

@LINK:/questions/6115896/java-checked-vs-unchecked-exception-explanation
@TITLE:Java: checked vs unchecked exception explanation
@CONTENT:I have read multiple posts on StackOverFlow about checked vs unchecked exceptions. I'm honestly still not quite sure how to use them properly. Joshua Bloch in "Effective Java" said that Use checked exceptions for recoverable conditions and runtime exceptions for programming errors (Item 58 in 2nd edition) Let see if I understand this correctly Here is my understanding of a checked exception: try{
    String userInput = //read in user input
    Long id = Long.parseLong(userInput);
}catch(NumberFormatException e){
    id = 0; //recover the situation by set the id to 0
}
 1. Is the above consider a checked exception? 2. Is RuntimeException an unchecked exception? Here is my understanding of a unchecked exception try{
    File file = new File("my/file/path");
    FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(file);   
}catch(FileNotFoundException e){

//3. What should I do here?
    //Should I "throw new FileNotFoundException("File not found");"?
    //Should I log?
    //Or should I System.exit(0);?
}
 4. Now, couldnt the above code also be a checked exception? I can try to recover the situation like this? Can I? (Note: my 3rd question is inside the catch above) try{
    String filePath = //read in from user input file path
    File file = new File(filePath);
    FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(file);   
}catch(FileNotFoundException e){
    //Kindly prompt the user an error message
    //Somehow ask the user to re-enter the file path.
}
 5. Why do people do this? public void someMethod throws Exception{

}
 Why do they let the exception bubble up? Isn't handling the error sooner better? Why bubble up? EDIT: Should I bubble up the exact exception or mask it using Exception? Below are my readings In Java, when should I create a checked exception, and when should it be a runtime exception? When to choose checked and unchecked exceptions
@CODE:try{
    String userInput = //read in user input
    Long id = Long.parseLong(userInput);
}catch(NumberFormatException e){
    id = 0; //recover the situation by set the id to 0
} try{
    File file = new File("my/file/path");
    FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(file);   
}catch(FileNotFoundException e){

//3. What should I do here?
    //Should I "throw new FileNotFoundException("File not found");"?
    //Should I log?
    //Or should I System.exit(0);?
} catch try{
    String filePath = //read in from user input file path
    File file = new File(filePath);
    FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(file);   
}catch(FileNotFoundException e){
    //Kindly prompt the user an error message
    //Somehow ask the user to re-enter the file path.

 In this case I will avoid a NullPointerException, and I don't know exactly if the object is null or not. So my code get splattered with these tests.

@TITLE:Creating a system overlay window (always on top)
@CONTENT:I'm trying to create an always-op-top button/clickable-image which stays on top of all the windows all the time. The proof of concept is here - Smart Taskbar (on AppBrain) and here V1.4.0 Sidebar style SWKey - Button savior (on xda-developers) I was following this sample code from the Android source code LoadAverageService.java I have been successful and have a running service now. The service displays some text on top left corner of screen all the time while user can freely interact with rest of apps in normal manner. What I'm doing is subclass ViewGroup and add it to root window manager with flag TYPE_SYSTEM_OVERLAY. Now I want to add a button/clickable-image in place of this text which can receive touch events on itself. I tried overriding "onTouchEvent" for the whole ViewGroup but it does not receive any event. How can I receive events only on certain parts of my always-on-top view group? Kindly suggest. public class HUD extends Service {

@TITLE:How do I create a parameterized SQL query? Why Should I?
@CONTENT:I've heard that "everyone" is using parameterized SQL queries to protect against SQL injection attacks without having to vailidate every piece of user input. How do you do this? Do you get this automatically when using stored procedures? So my understanding this is non-parameterized: cmdText = String.Format("SELECT foo FROM bar WHERE baz = '{0}'", fuz)
 Would this be parameterized? cmdText = String.Format("EXEC foo_from_baz '{0}'", fuz)
 Or do I need to do somethng more extensive like this in order to protect myself from SQL injection? With command
    .Parameters.Count = 1
    .Parameters.Item(0).ParameterName = "@baz"
    .Parameters.Item(0).Value = fuz
End With
 Are there other advantages to using parameterized queries besides the security considerations? Update: This great article was linked in one of the questions references by Grotok. http://www.sommarskog.se/dynamic_sql.html
@CODE:cmdText = String.Format("SELECT foo FROM bar WHERE baz = '{0}'", fuz) cmdText = String.Format("EXEC foo_from_baz '{0}'", fuz) With command

@LINK:/questions/13418669/javascript-do-i-need-to-put-this-var-for-every-variable-in-an-object
@TITLE:Javascript: Do I need to put this.var for every variable in an object?
@CONTENT:In C++, the language I'm most comfortable with, usually one declares an object like this: class foo
{
public:
    int bar;
    int getBar() { return bar; }
}
 Calling getBar() works fine (ignoring the fact that bar might be uninitialized). The variable bar within getBar() is in the scope of class foo, so I don't need to say this->bar unless I really need to make it clear that I'm referring to the class' bar instead of, say, a parameter. Now, I'm trying to get started with OOP in Javascript. So, I look up how to define classes and try the same sort of thing: function foo()
{
     this.bar = 0;
     this.getBar = function() { return bar; }
}
 And it gives me bar is undefined. Changing the bar to this.bar fixes the issue, but doing that for every variable clutters up my code quite a bit. Is this necessary for every variable? Since I can't find any questions relating to this, it makes me feel like I'm doing something fundamentally wrong. EDIT: Right, so, from the comments what I'm getting is that this.bar, a property of an object, references something different than bar, a local variable. Can someone say why exactly this is, in terms of scoping and objects, and if there's another way to define an object where this isn't necessary?
@CODE:class foo
{
public:
    int bar;
    int getBar() { return bar; }
} getBar() bar bar getBar() foo this->bar bar function foo()
{
     this.bar = 0;
     this.getBar = function() { return bar; }
} bar is undefined bar this.bar this.bar bar .bar this this.bar this.bar bar var bar = this.bar bar this.bar this.bar

I seem to recall that you are not supposed to place these in the <head> section, but placing at the beginning of the <body> section is bad, too, since the JavaScript will have to be parsed before the page is rendered completely (or something like that). This seems to leave the end of the <body> section as a logical place for <script> tags. So, where is the best place to put the <script> tags?

I listen for a "load" event on the iframe, in the hope that it will fire when the download is complete. I return a "Content-Disposition: attachment" header with the file, which causes the browser to show the "Save" dialog. But the browser doesn't fire a "load" event in the iframe. One approach I tried is using a multi-part response. So it would send an empty HTML file, as well as the attached downloadable file. For example: Content-type: multipart/x-mixed-replace;boundary="abcde"

--abcde
Content-type: text/html

--abcde
Content-type: application/vnd.fdf
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=foo.fdf

file-content
--abcde
 This works in Firefox; it receives the empty HTML file, fires the "load" event, then shows the "Save" dialog for the downloadable file. But it fails on IE and Safari; IE fires the "load" event but doesn't download the file, and Safari downloads the file (with the wrong name and content-type), and doesn't fire the "load" event. A different approach might be to make a call to start the file creation, then poll the server until it's ready, then download the already-created file. But I'd rather avoid creating temporary files on the server. Does anyone have a better idea?
@CODE:Content-type: multipart/x-mixed-replace;boundary="abcde"

--abcde
Content-type: text/html

--abcde
Content-type: application/vnd.fdf
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=foo.fdf

file-content

@TITLE:Converting ISO 8601-compliant String to java.util.Date
@CONTENT:I am trying to convert an ISO 8601 formatted String to a java.util.Date. I found the pattern "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZ" to be ISO8601-compliant if used with a Locale (compare sample). However, using the java.text.SimpleDateFormat, I cannot convert the correctly formatted String "2010-01-01T12:00:00+01:00". I have to convert it first to "2010-01-01T12:00:00+0100", without the colon. So, the current solution is SimpleDateFormat ISO8601DATEFORMAT = new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZ", Locale.GERMANY);
String date = "2010-01-01T12:00:00+01:00".replaceAll("\\+0([0-9]){1}\\:00", "+0$100");
System.out.println(ISO8601DATEFORMAT.parse(date));
 which obviously isn't that nice. Am I missing something or is there a better solution? answer Thanks to JuanZe's comment, I found the Joda-Time magic, it is also described here. So, the solution is DateTimeFormatter parser2 = ISODateTimeFormat.dateTimeNoMillis();
String jtdate = "2010-01-01T12:00:00+01:00";
System.out.println(parser2.parseDateTime(jtdate));
 Or more simply, use the default parser via the constructor: DateTime dt = new DateTime( "2010-01-01T12:00:00+01:00" ) ;
 To me, this is nice.
@CODE:SimpleDateFormat ISO8601DATEFORMAT = new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZ", Locale.GERMANY);
String date = "2010-01-01T12:00:00+01:00".replaceAll("\\+0([0-9]){1}\\:00", "+0$100");
System.out.println(ISO8601DATEFORMAT.parse(date)); DateTimeFormatter parser2 = ISODateTimeFormat.dateTimeNoMillis();
String jtdate = "2010-01-01T12:00:00+01:00";
System.out.println(parser2.parseDateTime(jtdate)); DateTime dt = new DateTime( "2010-01-01T12:00:00+01:00" ) ; new DateTime( "2010-01-01T12:00:00+01:00" )

@TITLE:How to properly set up a PDO connection
@CONTENT:From time to time I see questions regarding connecting to database. Most answers is not the way I do it, or I might just not get the answers correctly. Anyway; I've never thought about it because the way I do it works for me. But here's a crazy thought; Maybe I'm doing this all wrong, and if that's the case; I would really like to know how to properly connect to a MySQL database using PHP and PDO and make it easy accesable. Here's how I'm doing it: First off, here's my filestructure (stripped down): public_html/ index.php initialize/ -- load.initialize.php -- configure.php -- sessions.php index.php At the very top, I have require('initialize/load.initialize.php');. load.initialize.php #   site configurations
    require('configure.php');
#   connect to database
    require('root/somewhere/connect.php');  //  this file is placed outside of public_html for better security.
#   include classes
    foreach (glob('assets/classes/*.class.php') as $class_filename){
        include($class_filename);
    }
#   include functions
    foreach (glob('assets/functions/*.func.php') as $func_filename){
        include($func_filename);
    }
#   handle sessions
    require('sessions.php');
 I know there's a better, or more correct, way to include classes, but can't remember what it was. Haven't gotten the time to look into it yet, but I think it was something with autoload. something like that... configure.php Here I basically just override some php.ini-properties and do some other global configuration for the site connect.php I've put the connection onto a class so other classes can extends this one... class connect_pdo
{
    protected $dbh;

    public function __construct()
    {
        try {
            $db_host = '  ';  //  hostname
            $db_name = '  ';  //  databasename
            $db_user = '  ';  //  username
            $user_pw = '  ';  //  password

            $con = new PDO('mysql:host='.$db_host.'; dbname='.$db_name, $db_user, $user_pw);  
            $con->setAttribute( PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION );
            $con->exec("SET CHARACTER SET utf8");  //  return all sql requests as UTF-8  
        }
        catch (PDOException $err) {  
            echo "harmless error message if the connection fails";
            $err->getMessage() . "<br/>";
            file_put_contents('PDOErrors.txt',$err, FILE_APPEND);  // write some details to an error-log outside public_html  
            die();  //  terminate connection
        }
    }

    public function dbh()
    {
        return $this->dbh;
    }
}
#   put database handler into a var for easier access
    $con = new connect_pdo();
    $con = $con->dbh();
//
 Here I do believe there's room for massive improvement since I recently started learning OOP, and using PDO instead of mysql. So I've just followed a couple of beginners tutoraials and tried out different stuff... sessions.php Beside handeling regular sessions, I also initialize some classes into a session like this: if (!isset($_SESSION['sqlQuery'])){
    session_start();
    $_SESSION['sqlQuery'] = new sqlQuery();
}
 This way this class is avalible all over the place. This might not be good practice(?)... Anyway, this is what this approch allows me to do from everywhere: echo $_SESSION['sqlQuery']->getAreaName('county',9);  // outputs: Aust-Agder (the county name with that id in the database)
 Inside my sqlQuery-class, which extends my connect_pdo-class, I have a public function called getAreaName which handles the request to my database. Pretty neat I think. Works like a charm So that's basically how I'm doing it. Also, whenever I need to fetch something from my DB from not whitin a class, I just do something similar to this: $id = 123;

$sql = 'SELECT whatever FROM MyTable WHERE id = :id';
$qry = $con->prepare($sql);
$qry -> bindParam(':id', $id, PDO::PARAM_INT);
$qry -> execute();
$get = $qry->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
 Sience I put the connection into a variable inside *connect_pdo.php*, I just have refering to it and I'm good to go. It works. I get my expected results... But regardless of that; I would really appreciate if you guys could tell me if I'm way off here. What I should do instad, areas I could or should change for improvement etc... I'm eager to learn...

@TITLE:What is the best way to deal with the NSDateFormatter locale ¡§feature¡¨?
@CONTENT:It seems that NSDateFormatter has a "feature" that bites you unexpectedly: If you do a simple "fixed" format operation such as: NSDateFormatter* fmt = [[NSDateFormatter alloc] init];
[fmt setDateFormat:@"yyyyMMddHHmmss"];
NSString* dateStr = [fmt stringFromDate:someDate];
[fmt release];
 Then it works fine in the US and most locales UNTIL ... someone with their phone set to a 24-hour region sets the 12/24 hour switch in settings to 12. Then the above starts tacking "AM" or "PM" onto the end of the resulting string. (See, eg, NSDateFormatter, am I doing something wrong or is this a bug?) (And see https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/qa/qa1480/_index.html) Apparently Apple has declared this to be "BAD" -- Broken As Designed, and they aren't going to fix it. The circumvention is apparently to set the locale of the date formatter for a specific region, generally the US, but this is a bit messy: NSLocale *loc = [[NSLocale alloc] initWithLocaleIdentifier:@"en_US"];
[df setLocale: loc];
[loc release];
 Not too bad in onsies-twosies, but I'm dealing with about ten different apps, and the first one I look at has 43 instances of this scenario. So any clever ideas for a macro/overridden class/whatever to minimize the effort to change everything, without making the code to obscure? (My first instinct is to override NSDateFormatter with a version that would set the locale in the init method. Requires changing two lines -- the alloc/init line and the added import.) Added This is what I've come up with so far -- seems to work in all scenarios: @implementation BNSDateFormatter

-(id)init {
static NSLocale* en_US_POSIX = nil;
NSDateFormatter* me = [super init];
if (en_US_POSIX == nil) {
    en_US_POSIX = [[NSLocale alloc] initWithLocaleIdentifier:@"en_US_POSIX"];
}
[me setLocale:en_US_POSIX];
return me;
}

 The phone [make that an iPod Touch] is set to Great Britain, with the 12/24 switch set to 12. There's a clear difference in the two results, and I judge the category version to be wrong. Note that the log in the category version IS getting executed (and stops placed in the code are hit), so it's not simply a case of the code somehow not getting used. Bounty update: Since I haven't gotten any applicable replies yet I'll extend the bounty deadline for another day or two. Bounty ends in 21 hours -- it'll go to whoever makes the most effort to help, even if the answer isn't really useful in my case. A curious observation Modified the category implementation slightly: #import "NSDateFormatter+Locale.h"

@implementation NSDateFormatter (Locale)

- (id)initWithSafeLocale {
static NSLocale* en_US_POSIX2 = nil;
self = [super init];
if (en_US_POSIX2 == nil) {
    en_US_POSIX2 = [[NSLocale alloc] initWithLocaleIdentifier:@"en_US_POSIX"];
}
NSLog(@"Category's locale: %@ %@", en_US_POSIX2.description, [en_US_POSIX2 localeIdentifier]);
[self setLocale:en_US_POSIX2];
NSLog(@"Category's object: %@ and object's locale: %@ %@", self.description, self.locale.description, [self.locale localeIdentifier]);
return self;    
}

@end
 Basically just changed the name of the static locale variable (in case there was some conflict with the static declared in the subclass) and added the extra NSLog. But look what that NSLog prints: 2011-07-15 16:35:24.322 DemoApp[214:307] Category's locale: <__NSCFLocale: 0x160550> en_US_POSIX

 As you can see, the setLocale simply didn't. The locale of the formatter is still en_GB. It appears that there is something "strange" about an init method in a category. Final answer See the accepted answer below.

@CONTENT:I was writing a program in C++ to find all solutions of ab = c, where a, b and c together use all the digits 0-9 exactly once. The program looped over values of a and b, and ran a digit-counting routine each time on a, b and ab to check if the digits condition was satisfied. However, spurious solutions can be generated when ab overflows the integer limit. I ended up checking for this using code like: unsigned long b, c, c_test;

c_test=c*b;         // Possible overflow
if (c_test/b != c) {/* There has been an overflow*/}

@TITLE:How do you remove duplicates from a list in Python whilst preserving order?
@CONTENT:Is there a built-in that removes duplicates from list in Python, whilst preserving order? I know that I can use a set to remove duplicates, but that destroys the original order. I also know that I can roll my own like this: def uniq(input):
  output = []
  for x in input:
    if x not in output:
      output.append(x)
  return output
 (Thanks to unwind for that code sample.) But I'd like to avail myself of a built-in or a more Pythonic idiom if possible. Related question: In Python, what is the fastest algorithm for removing duplicates from a list so that all elements are unique while preserving order?
@CODE:def uniq(input):
  output = []
  for x in input:
    if x not in output:

@TITLE:Ignoring timezones altogether in Rails and PostgreSQL
@CONTENT:I'm dealing with dates and times in Rails and Postgres and running into this issue: The database is in UTC. The user sets a time-zone of choice in the Rails app, but it's only to be used when getting the users local time for comparing times. User stores a time, say March 17, 2012, 7pm. I don't want timezone conversions or the timezone to be stored. I just want that date and time saved. That way if the user changed their time zone, It would still show March 17, 2012, 7pm. I only use the users specified time zone to get records 'before' or 'after' the current time in the users local time zone. I'm currently using 'timestamp without time zone' but when I retrieve the records, rails (?) converts them to the time zone in the app, which I don't want. Appointment.first.time
 => Fri, 02 Mar 2012 19:00:00 UTC +00:00 
 Because the records in the database seem to come out as UTC, my hack is to take the current time, remove the time zone with 'Date.strptime(str, "%m/%d/%Y")' and then do my query with that: .where("time >= ?", date_start)
 It seems like there must be an easier way to just ignore time zones all around. Any ideas?

I also use SQL queries and I read a paper about EF (Entity Framework), can MVVM and EF coexist together in the same project?

@TITLE:How to make an Android Spinner with initial text ¡§Select One¡¨
@CONTENT:In Android, I want to use a Spinner that initially (when the user has not made a selection yet) displays the text "Select One". When the user clicks the spinner, the list of items is displayed and the user selects one of the options. After the user has made a selection, the selected item is displayed in the Spinner instead of "Select One". I have the following code to create a Spinner: String[] items = new String[] {"One", "Two", "Three"};
Spinner spinner = (Spinner) findViewById(R.id.mySpinner);
ArrayAdapter<String> adapter = new ArrayAdapter<String>(this,
            android.R.layout.simple_spinner_item, items);
adapter.setDropDownViewResource(android.R.layout.simple_spinner_dropdown_item);
spinner.setAdapter(adapter);
 With this code, initially the item "One" is displayed. I could just add a new item "Select One" to the items, but then "Select One" would also be displayed in the dropdown list as first item, which is not what I want. How can I fix this problem?

 We expect (b) to crash, because there is no corresponding member x for the null pointer. In practice, (a) doesn't crash because the this pointer is never used. Because (b) dereferences the this pointer ((*this).x = 5;), and this is null, the program enters undefined behavior, as dereferencing null is always said to be undefined behavior. Does (a) result in undefined behavior? What about if both functions (and x) are static?

@TITLE:Facing an error ¡§*** glibc detected *** free(): invalid next size (fast)¡¨
@CONTENT:Please see MSO question A long list of possible duplicates ¡X?C memory allocation and overrunning bounds for information about closely related questions. Developer environment: CentOS 4.7, Kdevelop 3.1.1, gcc 3.4.6 I run a Java test client that loads a C++ shared library using JNI. There are three components in my application, Java client C++ shared library which acts as a JNI wrapper. (I will call it "wrapperlibrary") C++ shared library containing business objects. (I will call it "businesslibrary") When I run the client I face an error very frequently which is, *** glibc detected *** free(): invalid next size (fast): 0x080eeef8 ***. This error comes for around 10 - 11 times and then the application runs. In my Java client, I first load the required C++ libraries in a static ctor as follows, static
{
System.Load("/root/Desktop/libs/businesslibrary");
System.out.println("business library loaded");
System.Load("/root/Desktop/libs/wrapperlibrary");
System.out.println("wrapper library loaded");
}
 The statement "business library loaded" gets printed on the console but after it the error *** glibc... comes. In the project settings of wrapperlibrary, the businesslibrary is specified as a dependant library. So, even if I omit the call to load businesslibrary and just write, static
{
System.Load("/root/Desktop/libs/wrapperlibrary");
System.out.println("wrapper library loaded");
}
 then firstly the businesslibrary gets loaded(seen through global variable creation logging) and then the wrapperlibrary gets loaded. The control returns back to java client and the statement "wrapper library loaded" is printed on console. After this there is a call to native method. But the control never reaches this native method's implementation. Rather before that the error *** glibc... again comes. Also if I insert a call to static method of another java class before native method call such as, static
{
 System.Load("/root/Desktop/libs/wrapperlibrary");
 System.out.println("wrapper library loaded");
 System.out.println(Try.temp()); //where temp is a static method of Try class which returns a string.

 native method call;

 --
 --
}
 then output of Try.temp() never gets printed. What could be the possible reasons for the problem in both these approaches and how should I proceed?
@CODE:*** glibc detected *** free(): invalid next size (fast): 0x080eeef8 *** static
{
System.Load("/root/Desktop/libs/businesslibrary");
System.out.println("business library loaded");
System.Load("/root/Desktop/libs/wrapperlibrary");
System.out.println("wrapper library loaded");
} *** glibc... static
{
System.Load("/root/Desktop/libs/wrapperlibrary");
System.out.println("wrapper library loaded");
} *** glibc... static
{
 System.Load("/root/Desktop/libs/wrapperlibrary");
 System.out.println("wrapper library loaded");
 System.out.println(Try.temp()); //where temp is a static method of Try class which returns a string.

I've obviously used regular casts i.e. MyClass *m = (MyClass *)ptr;
 all over the place, but there seem to be two other types of casts, and I don't know the difference. What's the difference between the following lines of code? MyClass *m = (MyClass *)ptr;

@TITLE:Why is 24.0000 not equal to 24.0000 in MATLAB?
@CONTENT:I've written a program in which it is necessary to delete some points from a matrix if they exist. sometimes, there are more than one copy of them in the matrix. But the problem is that when it comes to check whether those points are in the matrix, MATLAB can't recognize them in the matrix although thery are exist. Let's begin from these commands and their echos. In the following, "intersections" function gets the intersection points. [points(:,1) points(:,2)] = intersections(obj.modifiedVGVertices(1,:), obj.modifiedVGVertices(2,:), ...
[vertex1(1) vertex2(1)],[vertex1(2) vertex2(2)]);
points
vertex1
vertex2
 Their echo: points =

   12.0000   15.0000
   33.0000   24.0000
   33.0000   24.0000


vertex1 =

    12
    15


vertex2 =

    33
    24
 Two points(that are vertex1 and vertex2) should be eliminated from the result. it should be done by the below commands: points = points((points(:,1) ~= vertex1(1)) | (points(:,2) ~= vertex1(2)),:);

points = points((points(:,1) ~= vertex2(1)) | (points(:,2) ~= vertex2(2)),:);
 After doing that, we have this unexpected outcome: points =

   33.0000   24.0000
 The outcome should be an empty matrix. As you can see, the first(or second?) pair of [33.0000 24.0000] has been eliminated, but not the second one. Then I checked these two expressions: points(1) ~= vertex2(1)

ans =

     0


points(2) ~= vertex2(2)

ans =

     1   <-----It means 24.0000 is not equal to 24.0000?
 What is the problem? To become more and more surprised, I made a new script that has only these commands: points = [12.0000   15.0000
          33.0000   24.0000
          33.0000   24.0000];


 vertex1=[12 ;  15];
 vertex2=[33 ;  24];

  points = points((points(:,1) ~= vertex1(1)) | (points(:,2) ~= vertex1(2)),:);

  points = points((points(:,1) ~= vertex2(1)) | (points(:,2) ~= vertex2(2)),:);

 The result: points = Empty matrix: 0-by-2

@TITLE:Direct vs. Delegated - jQuery .on()
@CONTENT:I am trying to understand this particular difference between the direct and delegated event handlers using the jQuery .on() method. Specifically, the last sentence in this paragraph: When a selector is provided, the event handler is referred to as delegated. The handler is not called when the event occurs directly on the bound element, but only for descendants (inner elements) that match the selector. jQuery bubbles the event from the event target up to the element where the handler is attached (i.e., innermost to outermost element) and runs the handler for any elements along that path matching the selector. What does it mean by "runs the handler for any elements"? I made a test page to experiment with the concept. But both following constructs lead to the same behavior: $("div#target span.green").on("click", function() {
   alert($(this).attr("class") + " is clicked");
});
 or, $("div#target").on("click", "span.green", function() {
   alert($(this).attr("class") + " is clicked");
});
 Maybe someone could refer to a different example to clarify this point? Thanks.

   alert($(this).attr("class") + " is clicked");

@TITLE:What is an elegant way to force browsers to reload cached CSS/JS files?
@CONTENT:I have noticed that some browsers (in particular, Firefox and Opera) are very zealous in using cached copies of .css and .js files, even between browser sessions. This leads to a problem when you update one of these files but the user's browser keeps on using the cached copy. The question is: what is the most elegant way of forcing the user's browser to reload the file when it has changed? Ideally the solution would not force the browser to reload the file on every visit to the page. I will post my own solution as an answer, but I am curious if anyone has a better solution and I'll let your votes decide. Update: After allowing discussion here for a while, I have found John Millikin and da5id's suggestion to be useful. It turns out there is a term for this: auto-versioning. I have posted a new answer below which is a combination of my original solution and John's suggestion. Another idea which was suggested by SCdF would be to append a bogus query string to the file. (Some Python code to automatically use the timestamp as a bogus query string was submitted by pi.) However, there is some discussion as to whether or not the browser would cache a file with a query string. (Remember, we want the browser to cache the file and use it on future visits. We only want it to fetch the file again when it has changed.) Since it is not clear what happens with a bogus query string, I am not accepting that answer.

@TITLE:Improve INSERT-per-second performance of SQLite?
@CONTENT:Optimizing SQLite is tricky. Bulk-insert performance of a C application can vary from 85 inserts-per-second to over 96000 inserts-per-second! Background: We are using SQLite as part of a desktop application. We have large amounts of configuration data stored in XML files that are parsed and loaded into an SQLite database for further processing when the application is initialized. SQLite is ideal for this situation because it's fast, it requires no specialized configuration and the database is stored on disk as a single file. Rationale: Initially I was disappointed with the performance I was seeing. It turns-out that the performance of SQLite can vary significantly (both for bulk-inserts and selects) depending on how the database is configured and how you're using the API. It was not a trivial matter to figure-out what all of the options and techniques were, so I though it prudent to create this community wiki entry to share the results with SO readers in order to save others the trouble of the same investigations. The Experiment: Rather than simply talking about performance tips in the general sense (i.e. "Use a transaction!"), I thought it best to write some C code and actually measure the impact of various options. We're going to start with some simple data: A 28 meg TAB-delimited text file (approx 865000 records) of the complete transit schedule for the city of Toronto My test machine is a 3.60 GHz P4 running Windows XP. The code is compiled with MSVC 2005 as "Release" with "Full Optimization" (/Ox) and Favor Fast Code (/Ot). I'm using the SQLite "Amalgamation", compiled directly into my test application. The SQLite version I happen to have is a bit older (3.6.7), but I suspect these results will be comparable to the latest release (please leave a comment if you think otherwise). Let's write some code! The Code: A simple C program that reads the text file line-by-line, splits the string into values and then will inserts the data into an SQLite database. In this "baseline" version of the code, the database is created but we won't actually insert data: /*************************************************************

 The "Control" Running the code as-is doesn't actually perform any database operations, but it will give us an idea of how fast the raw C file IO and string processing operations are. Imported 864913 records in 0.94 seconds Great! We can do 920 000 inserts-per-second, provided we don't actually do any inserts :-) The "Worst-Case-Scenario" We're going to generate the SQL string using the values read from the file and invoke that SQL operation using sqlite3_exec: sprintf(sSQL, "INSERT INTO TTC VALUES (NULL, '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s')", sRT, sBR, sVR, sST, sVI, sDT, sTM);
sqlite3_exec(db, sSQL, NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);
 This is going to be slow because the SQL will be compiled into VDBE code for every insert and every insert will happen in it's own transaction. How slow? Imported 864913 records in 9933.61 seconds Yikes! 1 hour and 45 minutes! That's only 85 inserts-per-second. Using a Transaction By default SQLite will evaluate every INSERT / UPDATE statement within a unique transaction. If performing a large number of inserts, it's advisable to wrap your operation in a transaction: sqlite3_exec(db, "BEGIN TRANSACTION", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);

pFile = fopen (INPUTDATA,"r");
while (!feof(pFile)) {

    ...

}
fclose (pFile);

sqlite3_exec(db, "END TRANSACTION", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);
 Imported 864913 records in 38.03 seconds That's better. Simply wrapping all of our inserts in a single transaction improved our performance to 23 000 inserts-per-second. Using a Prepared Statement Using a transaction was a huge improvement, but recompiling the SQL statement for every insert doesn't make sense if we using the same SQL over-and-over. Let's use sqlite3_prepare_v2 to compile our SQL statement once and then bind our parameters to that statement using sqlite3_bind_text: /* Open input file and import into Database*/
cStartClock = clock();

sprintf(sSQL, "INSERT INTO TTC VALUES (NULL, @RT, @BR, @VR, @ST, @VI, @DT, @TM)");
sqlite3_prepare_v2(db,  sSQL, BUFFER_SIZE, &stmt, &tail);

sqlite3_exec(db, "BEGIN TRANSACTION", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);

pFile = fopen (INPUTDATA,"r");
while (!feof(pFile)) {

    fgets (sInputBuf, BUFFER_SIZE, pFile);

    sRT = strtok (sInputBuf, "\t");     /* Get Route */
    sBR = strtok (NULL, "\t");      /* Get Branch */    
    sVR = strtok (NULL, "\t");      /* Get Version */
    sST = strtok (NULL, "\t");      /* Get Stop Number */
    sVI = strtok (NULL, "\t");      /* Get Vehicle */
    sDT = strtok (NULL, "\t");      /* Get Date */
    sTM = strtok (NULL, "\t");      /* Get Time */

    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 1, sRT, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 2, sBR, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 3, sVR, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);

    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 6, sDT, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 7, sTM, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);

    sqlite3_step(stmt);

    sqlite3_clear_bindings(stmt);
    sqlite3_reset(stmt);

    n++;

}
fclose (pFile);

sqlite3_exec(db, "END TRANSACTION", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);

sqlite3_finalize(stmt);

return 0;
 Imported 864913 records in 16.27 seconds Nice! There's a little bit more code (don't forget to call sqlite3_clear_bindings and sqlite3_reset) but we've more than doubled our performance to 53 000 inserts-per-second. PRAGMA synchronous = OFF By default SQLite will pause after issuing a OS-level write command. This guarantees that the data is written to the disk. By setting synchronous = OFF, we are instructing SQLite to simply hand-off the data to the OS for writing and then continue. There's a chance that the database file may become corrupted if the computer suffers a catastrophic crash (or power failure) before the data is written to the platter: /* Open the Database and create the Schema */
sqlite3_open(DATABASE, &db);
sqlite3_exec(db, TABLE, NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, "PRAGMA synchronous = OFF", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);
 Imported 864913 records in 12.41 seconds The improvements are now smaller, but we're up to 69 600 inserts-per-second. PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY Consider storing the rollback journal in memory by evaluating PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY. Your transaction will be faster, but if you lose power or your program crashes during a transaction you database could be left in a corrupt state with a partially-completed transaction: /* Open the Database and create the Schema */
sqlite3_open(DATABASE, &db);
sqlite3_exec(db, TABLE, NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, "PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);
 Imported 864913 records in 13.50 seconds A little slower than the previous optimization at 64 000 inserts-per-second. PRAGMA synchronous = OFF and PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY Let's combine the previous two optimizations. It's a little more risky (in case of a crash), but we're just importing data (not running a bank): /* Open the Database and create the Schema */
sqlite3_open(DATABASE, &db);
sqlite3_exec(db, TABLE, NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, "PRAGMA synchronous = OFF", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, "PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);
 Imported 864913 records in 12.00 seconds Fantastic! We're able to do 72 000 inserts-per-second. Using an In-Memory Database Just for kicks, let's build upon all of the previous optimizations and redefine the database filename so we're working entirely in RAM: #define DATABASE ":memory:"
 Imported 864913 records in 10.94 seconds It's not super-practical to store our database in RAM, but it's impressive that we can perform 79 000 inserts-per-second. Refactoring C Code Although not specifically an SQLite improvement, I don't like the extra char* assignment operations in the while loop. Let's quickly refactor that code to pass the output of strtok() directly into sqlite3_bind_text() and let the compiler try to speed things up for us: pFile = fopen (INPUTDATA,"r");
while (!feof(pFile)) {

    fgets (sInputBuf, BUFFER_SIZE, pFile);

    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 1, strtok (sInputBuf, "\t"), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT); /* Get Route */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 2, strtok (NULL, "\t"), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);  /* Get Branch */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 3, strtok (NULL, "\t"), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);  /* Get Version */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 4, strtok (NULL, "\t"), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);  /* Get Stop Number */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 5, strtok (NULL, "\t"), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);  /* Get Vehicle */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 6, strtok (NULL, "\t"), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);  /* Get Date */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 7, strtok (NULL, "\t"), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);  /* Get Time */

    sqlite3_step(stmt);     /* Execute the SQL Statement */
    sqlite3_clear_bindings(stmt);   /* Clear bindings */
    sqlite3_reset(stmt);        /* Reset VDBE */

    n++;
}
fclose (pFile);
 Note: We are back to using a real database file. In-memory databases as fast but not necessarily practical Imported 864913 records in 8.94 seconds A slight refactoring to the string processing code used in our parameter binding has allowed us to perform 96 700 inserts-per-second. I think it's safe to say that this is plenty fast. As we start to tweak other variables (i.e. page size, index creation, etc.) this will be our benchmark. Summary (so far) I hope you're still with me! The reason we started down this road is that bulk-insert performance varies so wildly with SQLite and it's not always obvious what changes need to be made to speed-up our operation. Using the same compiler (and compiler options), the same version of SQLite and the same data we've optimized our code and our usage of SQLite to go from a worst-case scenario of 85 inserts-per-second to over 96000 inserts-per-second! CREATE INDEX then INSERT vs. INSERT then CREATE INDEX Before we start measuring SELECT performance, we know that we'll be creating indexes. It's been suggested in one of the answers below that when doing bulk inserts, it is faster to create the index after the data has been inserted (as opposed to creating the index first then inserting the data). Let's try: Create Index then Insert Data sqlite3_exec(db, "CREATE  INDEX 'TTC_Stop_Index' ON 'TTC' ('Stop')", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, "BEGIN TRANSACTION", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);
...
 Imported 864913 records in 18.13 seconds Insert Data then Create Index ...
sqlite3_exec(db, "END TRANSACTION", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, "CREATE  INDEX 'TTC_Stop_Index' ON 'TTC' ('Stop')", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);
 Imported 864913 records in 13.66 seconds As expected, bulk-inserts are slower if one column is indexed, but it does make a difference if the index is created after the data is inserted. Our no-index baseline is 96 000 insert-per-second. Creating the index first then inserting data gives us 47 700 inserts-per-second, whereas inserting the data first then creating the index gives us 63 300 inserts-per-second. I'd gladly take suggestions for other scenarios to try... And will be compiling similar data for SELECT queries soon.

@TITLE:How can I properly handle 404 in ASP.NET MVC?
@CONTENT:I am just getting started on ASP.NET MVC so bear with me. I've searched around this site and various others and have seen a few implementations of this. EDIT: I forgot to mention I am using RC2 Using URL Routing: routes.MapRoute(
    "Error",
     "{*url}",
     new { controller = "Errors", action = "NotFound" }  // 404s
);
 The above seems to take care of requests like this (assuming default route tables setup by initial MVC project): "/blah/blah/blah/blah" Overriding HandleUnknownAction() in the controller itself: // 404s - handle here (bad action requested
protected override void HandleUnknownAction(string actionName) {
    ViewData["actionName"] = actionName;
    View("NotFound").ExecuteResult(this.ControllerContext);
}  
 However the previous strategies do not handle a request to a Bad/Unknown controller. For example, I do not have a "/IDoNotExist", if I request this I get the generic 404 page from the web server and not my 404 if I use routing + override. So finally, my question is: Is there any way to catch this type of request using a route or something else in the MVC framework itself? OR should I just default to using Web.Config customErrors as my 404 handler and forget all this? I assume if I go with customErrors I'll have to store the generic 404 page outside of /Views due to the Web.Config restrictions on direct access. Anyway any best practices or guidance is appreciated.
@CODE:routes.MapRoute(
    "Error",
     "{*url}",
     new { controller = "Errors", action = "NotFound" }  // 404s
); // 404s - handle here (bad action requested
protected override void HandleUnknownAction(string actionName) {
    ViewData["actionName"] = actionName;
    View("NotFound").ExecuteResult(this.ControllerContext);

 There doesn't seem to be an overload that allows me to set the case sensitivity.. Currently I UPPERCASE them both, but that's just silly. UPDATE The sillyness I refer to is the i18n issues that come with up- and down casing. UPDATE This question is ancient and since then I have realized I asked for a simple answer for a really vast and difficult topic if you care to investigate it fully. For most cases, in mono-lingual, English code bases this answer will suffice. I'm suspecting because most people coming here fall in this category this is the most popular answer. This answer however brings up the inherent problem that we can't compare text case insensitive until we know both texts are the same culture and we know what that culture is. This is maybe a less popular answer, but I think it is more correct and that's why I marked it as such.

 Isn't CGFloat vulnerable to false positives when comparing with ==, <=, >=, <, >? It is a floating point and they have unprecision problems: 0.0000000000041 for example.

sub2 = "an arg"

a = "i am a %s" % sub1
b = "i am a {0}".format(sub1)

@CONTENT:I haven't used C very much in the last few years. When I read this question today I came across some C syntax which I wasn't familiar with. Apparently in C99 the following syntax is valid: void foo(int n) {
    int values[n]; //Declare a variable length array
}
 This seems like a pretty useful feature. Does anyone know if there was ever a discussion about adding it to the C++ standard, and if so, why it was omitted? Some potential reasons: Hairy for compiler vendors to implement Incompatible with some other part of the standard Functionality can be emulated with other C++ constructs ??? The C++ standard states that array size must be a constant expression (8.3.4.1) Yes, of course I realize that in the toy example one could use std::vector<int> values(m); but this allocates memory from the heap and not the stack. And if I want a multidimensional array like: void foo(int x, int y, int z) {
    int values[x][y][z]; //Declare a variable length array
}
 the vector version becomes pretty clumsy void foo(int x, int y, int z) {
    vector< vector< vector<int> > > values(/*really painful expression here*/);
}
 The slices, rows and columns will also potentially be spread all over memory. EDIT: Looking at the discussion at comp.std.c++ it's clear that this question is pretty controversial with some very heavyweight names on both sides of the argument. It's certainly not obvious that a std::vector is always a better solution.
@CODE:void foo(int n) {
    int values[n]; //Declare a variable length array
} std::vector<int> values(m); void foo(int x, int y, int z) {
    int values[x][y][z]; //Declare a variable length array
} vector void foo(int x, int y, int z) {
    vector< vector< vector<int> > > values(/*really painful expression here*/);
} comp.std.c++ std::vector

@TITLE:Use dynamic variable names in JavaScript
@CONTENT:In PHP you can do amazing/horrendous things like this: $a = 1;
$b = 2;
$c = 3;
$name = 'a';
echo $$name;
// prints 1
 Is there any way of doing something like this with Javascript? E.g. if I have a var name = 'the name of the variable'; can I get a reference to the variable with name name?
@CODE:$a = 1;
$b = 2;
$c = 3;
$name = 'a';

@CONTENT:I have a web application on a Linux server which starts with <? I needed to copy this application to a windows environment and everything is working fine except that an SQL statement is being rendered differently. I don't know if this has to do with the script beginning with <?php instead of <? because I don't know from where to enable the <? from the PHP.ini so I changed it to <?php I know that these 2 statements are supposed to mean the same but I need to test it with <? in order to ensure that the application is exactly the same.

@TITLE:Creating a custom button in Java with JButton
@CONTENT:I am trying to create a button that has a custom shape (hexagon), but otherwise acts like a normal JButton would (that is, works with an ActionListener). I have created a class that extends AbstractButton, but it doesn't seem to be sending events to the ActionListener when I click it. If I change the class to extend JButton it works perfectly, but it screws up the way the button is displayed. I'm assuming that there is a method that I need to override to get it to fire events, but I can't figure out what it is.

@TITLE:Can a progress bar be used in a class outside main?
@CONTENT:Right now, my main just calls a gui with 10 rows. Based on how many of those rows have text, 1 of 9 classes is called (two rows must have text). The called class performs calculations that I'd like to have the progress bar tied to. Here is an example of one of the called classes (each class is similar, but different enough to warrant a new class.) I believe the problem is a violation of EDT rules, but all the examples I've seen on them involve a main argument. The frame appears when the code is run, but the progress bar doesn't update until all calculations are completed. import java.awt.*;

 Now I've seen plenty of template magic here on SO that I never thought possible, so I'm wondering if anyone can suggest something that would match all containers C. Maybe something trait-ish that can figure out if something has the necessary iterator? Many thanks! Update (and solution) After raising this problem again on Channel 9, I got a fantastic answer from Sven Groot, which, combined with a bit of SFINAE type traiting, appears to solve the problem in a completely general and nestable fashion. The delimiters may be individually specialised, an example specialization for std::set is included, as well as an example of using custom delimiters. The helper "wrap_array()" can be used to print raw C arrays. Update: Pairs and tuples are available for printing; default delimiters are round brackets. The enable-if type trait requires C++0x, but with some modifications it should be possible to make a C++98 version of this. Tuples require variadic templates, hence C++0x. I have asked Sven to post the solution here so that I can accept it, but in the meantime I'd like to post the code myself for reference. (Update: Sven has now posted his code below, which I made the accepted answer. My own code uses container type traits, which work for me but may cause unexpected behaviour with non-container classes that provide iterators.) Header (prettyprint.h): #ifndef H_PRETTY_PRINT

 Further ideas for improvements: Implement output for std::tuple<...> in the same way is we have it for std::pair<S,T>. Update: This is now a separate question on SO! Upupdate: This has now been implemented, thanks to Xeo! Add namespaces so that the helper classes don't bleed into the global namespace. Done Add template aliases (or something similar) to facilitate making custom delimiter classes, or maybe preprocessor macros? Recent updates: I removed the custom output iterator in favour of a simple for loop in the print function. All implementation details are now in the pretty_print namespace. Only the global stream operators and the pretty_print_array wrapper are in the global namespace. Fixed the namespacing so that operator<< is now correctly in std. Notes: Removing the output iterator means that there is no way to use std::copy() to get pretty-printing. I might reinstate the pretty iterator if this is a desired feature, but Sven's code below has the implementation. It was a conscious design decision to make the delimiters compile-time constants rather than object constants. That means that you cannot supply delimiters dynamically at runtime, but it also means that there's no unneeded overhead. An object-based delimiter configuration has been proposed by Dennis Zickefoose in a comment to Sven's code below. If desired, this could be implemented as an alternative feature. It is currently not obvious how to customize nested container delimiters. Bear in mind that the purpose of this library is to allow quick container printing facilities that require zero coding on your part. It is not an all-purpose formatting library, but rather a developing tool to alleviate the need to write boiler-plate code for container inspection. Thank you to everyone who contributed! Note: If you are looking for a quick way to deploy custom delimiters, here is one way using type erasure. We assume that you have already constructed a delimiter class, say MyDel, like so: struct MyDel { static const pretty_print::delimiters_values<char> values; };
const pretty_print::delimiters_values<char> MyDel::values = { "<", "; ", ">" };
 Now we want to be able to write std::cout << MyPrinter(v) << std::endl; for some container v using those delimiters. MyPrinter will be a type-erasing class, like so: struct wrapper_base
{
  virtual ~wrapper_base() { }
  virtual std::ostream & stream(std::ostream & o) = 0;
};

@TITLE:Java generics - type erasure - when and what happens
@CONTENT:I read about Java's type erasure on Sun's website. When does type erasure occur? At compile time / runtime? When the class is loaded / runtime? When the class is instantiated? A lot of sites (including the Sun tutorial mentioned above) say type erasure occurs at compile time. If the type information is completely removed at compile time, how does the JDK check type compatibility when a method using generics is invoked with no type information or wrong type information. Consider the following example: Say class A has a method, empty(Box<? extends Number> b). We compile A.java and get the class file A.class. Now we create another class B which invokes the method empty with a non-parameterized argument (raw type)- empty(new Box()). If we compile B.java with A.class in the classpath, javac is smart enough to raise a warning. So A.class has some type information stored in it. My guess would be that type erasure occurs when the class is loaded, but it is just a guess. So when does it happen?

 But what about if you style the outer anchor as display:block in the stylesheet? Is it still wrong? The HTML 4.01 spec on block-level and inline elements seems to think so: Style sheets provide the means to specify the rendering of arbitrary elements, including whether an element is rendered as block or inline. In some cases, such as an inline style for list elements, this may be appropriate, but generally speaking, authors are discouraged from overriding the conventional interpretation of HTML elements in this way. Does anyone have any further tips about this issue?
@CODE:<a href="http://www.mydomain.com"><div>
What we have here is a problem. 
You see, an anchor element is an inline element,
and the div element is a block level element.

 I expect it to output 0, 2, 4, 6, 8. However, it actually outputs five 10s. It seems that it is due to all actions referring to one captured variable. As a result, when they get invoked, they all have same output. Is there a way to work round this limit to have each action instance have its own captured variable?

@TITLE:How to navigate in JSF? How to make URL reflect current page (and not previous one)
@CONTENT:I am currently learning JSF and was rather amazed and puzzled when I realized that whenever we use <h:form>, the standard behavior of JSF is to always show me the URL of the previous page in the browser, as opposed to the URL of the current page. I understand that this has to do with the way JSF always posts a form to the same page and then just renders whatever page the controller gives it back to the browser which doesn't know the page location has changed. It seems like JSF has been around for long enough that there must be a clean, solid way to deal with this. If so, would you mind sharing? I have found various workarounds, but sadly nothing that seems like a real solid solution. Simply accept that the URL is misleading. Append "?faces-redirect=true" to the return value of every bean's action and then figure out how to replace @RequestScoped with something else (Flash Scopes, CDI conversation, @SessionScoped, ...). accept to have two HTTP round trips for every user action. Use some method (e.g. 3rd party library or custom code) to hide the page name in the URL, always using the same generic URL for every page. If "?faces-redirect=true" is as good as it gets, is there a way do configure an entire application to treat all requests this way?

@TITLE:How to test whether stringstream operator>> has parsed a bad type and skip it
@CONTENT:I am interested in discussing methods for using stringstream to parse a line with multiple types. I would begin by looking at the following line: "2.832 1.3067 nana 1.678"
 Now lets assume I have a long line that has multiple strings and doubles. The obvious way to solve this is to tokenize the string and then check converting each one. I am interested in skipping this second step and using stringstream directly to only find the numbers. I figured a good way to approach this would be to read through the string and check if the failbit has been set, which it will if I try to parse a string into a double. Say I have the following code: string a("2.832 1.3067 nana 1.678");

 stringstream parser;
 parser.str(a);

 for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i)
 {
     double b;
     parser >> b;
     if (parser.fail())
     {
         std::cout << "Failed!" << std::endl;
         parser.clear();
     }
     std::cout << b << std::endl;
 }
 It will print out the following: 2.832
1.3067
Failed!
0
Failed!
0
 I am not surprised that it fails to parse a string, but what is happening internally such that it fails to clear its failbit and parse the next number?
@CODE:stringstream "2.832 1.3067 nana 1.678" strings doubles stringstream failbit string a("2.832 1.3067 nana 1.678");

 stringstream parser;
 parser.str(a);

 {
     double b;
     parser >> b;
     if (parser.fail())
     {
         std::cout << "Failed!" << std::endl;

@CONTENT:I'd like to use Javascript to calculate the width of a string, is this possible without having to use a monospace typeface? If it's not built-in, my only idea is to create a table of widths for each character, but this is pretty unreasonable especially supporting unicode and different type sizes (and all browsers for that matter).

@TITLE:How to apply !important using .css()?
@CONTENT:I am having trouble applying a style that is !important. I¡¦ve tried: $("#elem").css("width", "100px !important");
 This does nothing; no width style whatsoever is applied. Is there a jQuery-ish way of applying such a style without having to overwrite cssText (which would mean I¡¦d need to parse it first, etc.)? Edit: I should add that I have a stylesheet with an !important style that I am trying to override with an !important style inline, so using .width() and the like does not work since it gets overridden by my external !important style. Also, the value that will override the previous value is computed, so I cannot simply create another external style.

@TITLE:javax.faces.application.ViewExpiredException: View could not be restored
@CONTENT:I have written simple application with container-managed security. The problem is when I log in and open another page on which I logout, then I come back to first page and I click on any link etc or refresh page I get this exception. I guess it's normal (or maybe not:)) because I logged out and session is destroyed. What should I do to redirect user to for example index.xhtml or login.xhtml and save him from seeing that error page/message? In other words how can I automatically redirect other pages to index/login page after I log out? Here it is: javax.faces.application.ViewExpiredException: viewId:/index.xhtml - View /index.xhtml could not be restored.

There are cases where the Google copy is blocked (apparently in Iran, for instance). Would I set up a timer and check for the jQuery object? What would be the danger of both copies coming through? Not really looking for answers like "just use the Google one" or "just use your own." I understand those arguments. I also understand that the user is likely to have the Google version cached. I'm thinking about fallbacks for the cloud in general. Edit: This part added... Since Google suggests using google.load to load the ajax libraries, and it performs a callback when done, I'm wondering if that's the key to serializing this problem. I know it sounds a bit crazy. I'm just trying to figure out if it can be done in a reliable way or not. Update: jQuery now hosted on Microsoft's CDN. http://www.asp.net/ajax/cdn/

@TITLE:Max parallel http connections in a browser?
@CONTENT:I am creating some suspended connections to an http server (comet, reverse ajax, etc). It works ok, but I see the browser only allows two suspended connections to a given domain simultaneously. So if a user is looking at my web app in Tab1 of their browser, then also tries loading it in Tab2, they've used up the two allowed connections to my site. I think I can do some wildcard domain thing, where I have my http server resolve any address to my site like: *.mysite.com/webapp  -> 123.456.789.1 (the actual ip of my server)
 so: a.mysite.com/webapp
b.mysite.com/webapp
c.mysite.com/webapp
 all still point to (www.mysite.com/webapp) but the browser considers them different domains, so I don't run into the 2 connection limit. Is this true? Even if that is true - is there any limit to the number of active connections per browser, across all domains? Say I use the scheme above - does firefox for example only allow 24 parallel connections at any given time? Something like: 1) a.mysite.com/webapp
2) www.download.com/hugefile.zip
3) b.mysite.com/webapp
4) c.mysite.com/webapp
...
24) x.mysite.com/webapp
25) // Error - all 24 possible connections currently in use!

@LINK:/questions/9153262/tips-for-debugging-htaccess-rewrite-rules
@TITLE:Tips for debugging .htaccess rewrite rules
@CONTENT:Many posters have problems debugging their RewriteRule and RewriteCond statements within their .htaccess files. Most of these are using a shared hosting service and therefore don't have access to the root server configuration. They cannot avoid using .htaccess files for rewriting and cannot enable a RewriteLogLevel" as many respondents suggest. Also there are many .htaccess-specific pitfalls and constraints are aren't covered well. Setting up a local test LAMP stack involves too much of a learning curve for most. So my Q here is how would we recommend that they debug their rules themselves. I provide a few suggestions below. Other suggestions would be appreciated. Understand that the mod_rewrite engine cycles through .htaccess files. The engine runs this loop: do
  execute server and vhost rewrites (in the Apache Virtual Host Config)
  find the lowest "Per Dir" .htaccess file on the file path with rewrites enabled
  if found(.htaccess)
     execute .htaccess rewrites (in the user's directory)
while rewrite occurred
 So your rules will get executed repeatedly and if you change the URI path then it may end up executing other .htaccessfiles if they exist. So make sure that you terminate this loop, if necessary by adding extra RewriteCond to stop rules firing. Also delete any lower level .htaccess rewrite rulesets unless explicitly intent to use multi-level rulesets. Make sure that the syntax of each Regexp is correct by testing against a set of test patterns to make sure that is a valid syntax and does what you intend with a fully range of test URIs. See answer below for more details. Build up your rules incrementally in a test directory. You can make use of the "execute the deepest .htaccess file on the path feature" to set up a separate test directory (tree) and debug rulesets here without screwing up your main rules and stopping your site working. You have to add them one at a time because this is the only way to localise failures to individual rules. Use a dummy script stub to dump out server and environment variables. (See Listing 2)If your app uses, say, blog/index.php then you can copy this into test/blog/index.php and use it to test out your blog rules in the test subdirectory. You can also use environment variables to make sure that the rewrite engine in interpreting substitution strings correctly, e.g. RewriteRule ^(.*) - [E=TEST0:%{DOCUMENT_ROOT}/blog/html_cache/$1.html]
 and look for these REDIRECT_* variables in the phpinfo dump. BTW, I used this one and discovered on my site that I had to use %{ENV:DOCUMENT_ROOT_REAL} instead. In the case of redirector looping REDIRECT_REDIRECT_* variables list the previous pass. Etc.. Make sure that you don't get bitten by your browser caching incorrect 301 redirects. See answer below. My thanks to Ulrich Palha for this. The rewrite engine seems sensitive to cascaded rules within an .htaccess context, (that is where a RewriteRule results in a substitution and this falls though to further rules), as I found bugs with internal sub-requests (1), and incorrect PATH_INFO processing which can often be prevents by use of the [NS], [L] and [PT] flags. Any more comment or suggestions? Listing 1 -- phpinfo <?php phpinfo(INFO_ENVIRONMENT|INFO_VARIABLES);

  execute server and vhost rewrites (in the Apache Virtual Host Config)

@TITLE:Frame Buster Buster ¡K buster code needed
@CONTENT:Let's say you don't want other sites to "frame" your site in an <iframe>: <iframe src="http://example.org"></iframe>
 So you insert anti-framing, frame busting JavaScript into all your pages: /* break us out of any containing iframes */
if (top != self) { top.location.replace(self.location.href); }
 Excellent! Now you "bust" or break out of any containing iframe automatically. Except for one small problem. As it turns out, your frame-busting code can be busted, as shown here: <script type="text/javascript">
    var prevent_bust = 0  
    window.onbeforeunload = function() { prevent_bust++ }  
    setInterval(function() {  
      if (prevent_bust > 0) {  
        prevent_bust -= 2  
        window.top.location = 'http://example.org/page-which-responds-with-204'  
      }  
    }, 1)  
</script>
 This code does the following: increments a counter every time the browser attempts to navigate away from the current page, via the window.onbeforeunload event handler sets up a timer that fires every millisecond via setInterval(), and if it sees the counter incremented, changes the current location to a server of the attacker's control that server serves up a page with HTTP status code 204, which does not cause the browser to navigate anywhere My question is -- and this is more of a JavaScript puzzle than an actual problem -- how can you defeat the frame-busting buster? I had a few thoughts, but nothing worked in my testing: attempting to clear the onbeforeunload event via onbeforeunload = null had no effect adding an alert() stopped the process let the user know it was happening, but did not interfere with the code in any way; clicking OK lets the busting continue as normal I can't think of any way to clear the setInterval() timer I'm not much of a JavaScript programmer, so here's my challenge to you: hey buster, can you bust the frame-busting buster?
@CODE:<iframe> <iframe src="http://example.org"></iframe> /* break us out of any containing iframes */
if (top != self) { top.location.replace(self.location.href); } <script type="text/javascript">
    var prevent_bust = 0  
    window.onbeforeunload = function() { prevent_bust++ }  
    setInterval(function() {

        prevent_bust -= 2  
        window.top.location = 'http://example.org/page-which-responds-with-204'  
      }  
    }, 1)

@LINK:/questions/1634268/explain-javascripts-encapsulated-anonymous-function-syntax
@TITLE:Explain JavaScript's encapsulated anonymous function syntax
@CONTENT:Summary Can you explain the reasoning behind the syntax for encapsulated anonymous functions in JavaScript? Why does this work: (function(){})(); but this doesn't: function(){}();? What I know In JavaScript, one creates a named function like this: function twoPlusTwo(){
    alert(2 + 2);
}
twoPlusTwo();
 You can also create an anonymous function and assign it to a variable: var twoPlusTwo = function(){
    alert(2 + 2);
};
twoPlusTwo();
 You can encapsulate a block of code by creating an anonymous function, then wrapping it in brackets and executing it immediately: (function(){
    alert(2 + 2);
})();
 This is useful when creating modularised scripts, to avoid cluttering up the current scope, or global scope, with potentially conflicting variables - as in the case of Greasemonkey scripts, jQuery plugins, etc. Now, I understand why this works. The brackets enclose the contents and expose only the outcome (I'm sure there's a better way to describe that), such as with (2 + 2) === 4. What I don't understand But I don't understand why this does not work equally as well: function(){
    alert(2 + 2);
}();
 Can you explain that to me?
@CODE:(function(){})(); function(){}(); function twoPlusTwo(){
    alert(2 + 2);
}
twoPlusTwo(); var twoPlusTwo = function(){
    alert(2 + 2);
};
twoPlusTwo(); (function(){
    alert(2 + 2);
})(); (2 + 2) === 4 function(){
    alert(2 + 2);
}();

@LINK:/questions/10636611/how-does-access-control-allow-origin-header-work
@TITLE:How does Access-Control-Allow-Origin header work?
@CONTENT:Apparently, I have completely misunderstood its semantics. I thought of something like this: A client downloads javascript code MyCode.js from http://siteA - the origin. The response header of MyCode.js contains Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://siteB, which I thought meant that MyCode.js was allowed to make cross-origin references to the site B. The client triggers some functionality of MyCode.js, which in turn make requests to http://siteB, which should be fine, despite being cross-origin requests. Well, I am wrong. It does not work like this at all. So, I have read http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing and attempted to read http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/. One thing is sure - I still do not understand how am I supposed to use this header. I have full control of both site A and site B. How do I enable the javascript code downloaded from the site A to access resources on the site B using this header? P.S. I do not want to utilize JSONP.
@CODE:http://siteA/MyCode.js

@TITLE:How to encode the filename parameter of Content-Disposition header in HTTP?
@CONTENT:Web applications that want to force a resource to be downloaded rather than directly rendered in a Web browser issue a Content-Disposition header in the HTTP response of the form: Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=FILENAME The filename parameter can be used to suggest a name for the file into which the resource is downloaded by the browser. RFC 2183 (Content-Disposition), however, states in section 2.3 (The Filename Parameter) that the file name can only use US-ASCII characters: Current [RFC 2045] grammar restricts parameter values (and hence Content-Disposition filenames) to US-ASCII. We recognize the great desirability of allowing arbitrary character sets in filenames, but it is beyond the scope of this document to define the necessary mechanisms. There is empirical evidence, nevertheless, that most popular Web browsers today seem to permit non-US-ASCII characters yet (for the lack of a standard) disagree on the encoding scheme and character set specification of the file name. Question is then, what are the various schemes and encodings employed by the popular browsers if the file name ¡§na?vefile¡¨ (without quotes and where the third letter is U+00EF) needed to be encoded into the Content-Disposition header? For the purpose of this question, popular browsers being: Firefox Internet Explorer Safari Google Chrome Opera
