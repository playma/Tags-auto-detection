@CONTENT:I've an application with some modal dialogs. When I click on overlay, those dialogs automatically close. I want to prevent this behaviour and let them close only if I click on a specific button, which works properly. How can I manage this? The overlay is automatically created in the following div: <div class="ui-widget-overlay"

 My next task is to take all references in head section AUTOMATICALLY and replace them by one single line, as seen in the example. I should only replace those that falls with in these rules: Href starts with '/Files/', to avoid trying to load externals externals Only the ones with attribute media or with a media="all" should be included, as the resulting css-file will only have one setting. I have acces to the raw html of the page, but is stuck on sucsfully locating the references, not knowing if I should parse to xml or use regex or such.. can anyone point me in the right direction?

@TITLE:Panning problems with Cocoa NSScrollView
@CONTENT:Im using Xcode to make an application that has a NSImageView that I have made into an NSScrollView (I think) by means of selecting it in my .xib, going to the editor menu in Xcode then embedded in > scrollView. I have an image in my NSScrollView that is larger than the window it is opened in, I can scroll using the scroll bars fine and have even turned on the autoscroll: function in my mouseDragged: method. I would like to be able to simply pan around the image without touching the edges of the screen using mouseDragged:. So far my code for mouseDragged: in my panning.m(subclass of NSImageView) is such: -(void)mouseDragged:(NSEvent *)theEvent{
   NSPoint p = [theEvent locationInWindow];
   [self scrollRectToVisible:NSMakeRect(p.x - self.visibleRect.origin.x, p.y - self.visibleRect.origin.y, self.visibleRect.size.width, self.visibleRect.size.height)];
   [self autoscroll:theEvent];
}
 This works to some degree, however there is a lot of jittering. Maybe because I am not restricting the bounds? I was wondering if I am on the right track or is there a better/more efficient way. Any help is appreciated. Cheers.

@TITLE:Error using session RamSession with cherrypy behind nginx
@CONTENT:I am running a cherrypy application using my own session based of RamSession behind nginx. The problem is the session id changes on every request. I believe the problem is every time a request is made it goes to a different worker and thus the session is saved, but it is not recognized in the next request by the next available worker (limited knowledge on how things work unfortunately). When I set the number of workers to 1 then everything works as expected. I know I can probably use FileSession or any type of DB based session handler, but just wanted to know if there is a solution for this.

@CONTENT:I'm trying to find a way to snap or quantize numbers to specific values after a math operation and don't really know the best way to approach the problem. A specific example: I have a list of numbers that I want to be my master numbers - 5, 10, 30, 60, 120, 180 I have a list of numbers that are currently inputted - 10, 20, 60, 120 Now I want to multiply all the inputted numbers by 2, and have them snap (or quantize/get rounded to) the nearest of my master numbers. So a number like 10, once multiplied by two, I'd like to have it snap to 30. I dont think it's a big problem for the top or bottom because I think I can use math.ceil and math.floor to contain the ends. Similarly I'd like 20 to be rounded to 30 as well (20*2=40, rounded down as 30 is closer than 60). I saw a similar question in regards to rounding to 10s, 100s, etc, but can't really figure out how to apply the answer there, as I'm still relatively new! : )

"insert into table (column1, column2, column3, column4, column5, column6, column7) values('O'Reilley','state, postcode','',1,2,'O'Riordon')". 
 So far I've came up with this working vbscript regular expression ([,=(]\s*'[^']*)'([^']*'\s*[,)\s])
 Is it possible to write a vbscript regular expression without using the header [(|=|\s|,] and trailer [,|)|\s]? Thanks. EDIT: Fix the posted regex to remove | from header and trailer. The regexp is used as follows regexp.replace("string","$1''$2")
@CODE:"update table set column2 = 'O'Connell', column3 = 'O'Riordon' where column1 = 1"

@LINK:/questions/12700563/string-producer-consumer-in-c-stddequechar-or-stdstringstream
@TITLE:string producer/consumer in C++: std::deque<char> or std::stringstream?
@CONTENT:In our application we have a class that produces characters, and another that consumes them. The current implementation dynamically allocates characters as they are produced (using new) and delete them (with delete) as they are consumed. This is all terribly slow, and I am looking at ways to replace that implementation to improve its performance. The semantic I need is that of the standard class queue: push at the front, pop at the back. The default implementation uses a deque IIRC. deque is typically implemented using "blocks" or "chunks" of memory, so I expect far less calls to the OS memory allocator, and a significant speed-up, with little additional memory usage. However, since the data queued is characters (possibly wide characters), an alternative would be to use the standard input/output stream class, namely the character stream stringstream. AFAIK, their behaviour is queue-like too. Is their a better choice a priori? Would both classes have similar allocation patterns? I can try and measure performance of both, but perhaps it doesn't really matter and either would be good enough. In that case, which would be easiest/safest to use? a secondary matter is concurrency between the producer and the consumer. I can restrict access to be sequential (on the same thread), but a thread-safe implementation is likely to be beneficial performance-wise with current multi-core hardware. Thanks for your wisdom before I dive in and start coding.

First I draw some thing on the main canvas (destination), then instantiate another canvas using TBitmap, draw onto that, and then blend the two together (following an answer here on SO). However, I am finding that it always returns false, at first I thought it had something to do with passing the wrong handles for source and destination, but I cannot figure it out. what could it be? unit MainWnd;

@TITLE:Grails data binding - Cannot make an immutable entity modifiable
@CONTENT:On a Grails 2.1.0 I am trying to dynamically updating a field on a domain class. The object gets binded and it looks fine, until the save method is called, which throws the following exception: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Cannot make an immutable entity modifiable.     try {
        def bindParams = [:]
        bindParams."$paramsFieldName" = "$paramsValue"
        def domainClass = grailsApplication.domainClasses.find { it.clazz.simpleName == paramsDomain }.clazz
        def objectInstance = domainClass.findById(paramsId)
        objectInstance."$paramsFieldName" = "$paramsValue"
        bindData(objectInstance, bindParams)
        objectInstance.save(flush:true ,failOnError:false)
        return objectInstance
    }
    catch (Exception ex) {
        log.error ex
        return null
    }
 I tried to bind the field using direct assigment and worked well. objectInstance."$paramsFieldName" = convertToType( fieldType.name,paramsValue)
 but then I need to handle the type conversion for each case (I assume). What I need is the BindDynamicMethod handles the binding for me. What happens to the object when binding it using the BindDynamicMethod that makes is immutable?. Or what am I doing wrong that is causing it? ========================================================= PARTIALLY SOLVED It turned out that this was happening on some of the domains, but some that were using cache on their mapping was throwing this exception. class UploadSettings {
    String profile = "default"
    String displayName
    String name 
    String value 
    String defaultValue 

    static mapping = {
        //cache usage:'read-only'

    }
}
 So I guess now my question is if a domain is using cache , why cant we update its value? Or how can we do that? Is there a way to capture if the domain is immutable? Thanks
@CODE:try {
        def bindParams = [:]
        bindParams."$paramsFieldName" = "$paramsValue"

@TITLE:Efficiency when inserting into mongodb (pymongo)
@CONTENT:Updated for clarity: I need advice for performance when inserting/appending to a capped collection. I have two python scripts running: (1) Tailing the cursor. while WSHandler.cursor.alive:
        try:
            doc = WSHandler.cursor.next()
            self.render(doc)
 (2) Inserting like so: def on_data(self, data):                      #Tweepy
    if (len(data) > 5):
        data = json.loads(data)

        #print(coll.count())
        #print(data)
 and it's running fine for a while (at 50 inserts/second). Then, after 20-60secs, it stumbles, hits the cpu roof (though it was running at 20% before), and never recovers. My mongostats take a dive (the dive is shown below). Mongostat output: The CPU is now choked, by the processes doing the insertion (at least according to htop). When I run the Tweepy lines above with print(data) instead of adding it to db (coll.insert(data)), everything's running along fine at 15% cpu use. What I see in mongostats: res keeps climbing. (Though clogs may happen at 40m as well as run fine on 100m.) flushes do not seem to interfere. locked % is stable at 0.1%. Would this lead to clogging eventually? (I'm running AWS microinstance; pymongo.)

 I need to implement a UNIQUE constraint (key) on the value field. I know that is not yet possible to define a unique index on the entire value for a blob or text field, but there is a ticket(?) open to implement such feature (see this page) where it has been suggested to create a unique key using a hash like it is already implemented for other fields. Now I would like to use a similar approach adding to the table another field that will contain the hash and creating a unique key on this field. I gave a look to possible ways to create this hash and, since I would like to avoid collisions (I need to insert several millions of entries), it seems that the RIPEMD-160 algorithm is the best one, even if a quick search gave me several similar solutions that use SHA256 or even SHA1 and MD5. I totally lack of knowledge in cryptography, so what are the down sides of choosing this approach? Another question I have is: which algorithm is currently used by MySQL to create the hash?

@CONTENT:To mimic an auto-increment value in XQuery Update, the following works fine, assuming <root count="0"/> when running this for the first time: let $count := /root/@count

  insert node <node id='{ $count }'/> into /root,
  replace value of node $count with $count + 1

 ...nicely yielding: <root count="1">
  <node id="0">
</root>
 However, I'd like to define the node in my Java code, and then bind that as an org.w3c.dom.Node or Document, or even String. Like: String expr =
     " declare variable $n external; "
   + " let $count := /root/@count; "
   + " return ( "

// org.w3c.dom.Node node is <node id='{ $count }'/>
xqp.bindNode(new QName("n"), node, null);
xqp.executeQuery();
 However, this just leaves me the text { $count } in the attribute. Binding the node as an xs:string value has the same effect. Of course, this is a nice protection against "XQuery injection". Still then: is there any way to make XQuery Update process an enclosed expression I have in the variables themselves? (Any other smart ideas to use auto-increment values in XQuery are very welcome too, but then see Auto increment with XQuery Update?)

Is there any service that can do this? UPDATE: geopy is just what I was looking for. I am wondering what the best way to deal with multiple results is. Here is my attempt:         try:
             place, (lat, lng) = g.geocode(title+", North Carolina")
        except ValueError:
             geocodespot = g.geocode(title+", North Carolina", exactly_one=False)
             place, (lat, lng) = geocodespot[0]
 It works just fine but I am wondering if there are any better ideas.
@CODE:try:
             place, (lat, lng) = g.geocode(title+", North Carolina")
        except ValueError:
             geocodespot = g.geocode(title+", North Carolina", exactly_one=False)
             place, (lat, lng) = geocodespot[0]

@TITLE:PHP Object : Loop on product list
@CONTENT:I have a quick one: I'm a beginner with PHP Object, and I have a product table with all my products. I also have a class for my product (with a constructor that fills my instance with all the parameters of my product). Say I want a list of all my product, shall I create a separate class for my list of products, or create a function that creates a new instance of my product class ? I don't really get the benefits of it right now, because if I have to execute the exact same query as my class query, it's useless ? Thank's for your tips ! UPDATE Thank's folks ! It's still quite complicated for me, but here's what I did (talking about books) trying to follow your advices. I created a DAO. Inside this DAO, I have two static functions that return me either a list of books or a single book, and one static that creates the book object. With this method, I still have 2 queries (one for the list, one for the single book). I have a feeling this is wrong but any help is appreciated :) class bookDAO {

    public static function getBooks() {
        $books = array();
        $db = databaseConnection::getInstance();
        $query = $db->query("SELECT * FROM books");

@LINK:/questions/12694295/statistical-inefficiency-block-averages
@TITLE:Statistical inefficiency (block-averages)
@CONTENT:I have a series of data, these are obtained through a molecular dynamics simulation, and therefore are sequential in time and correlated to some extent. I can calculate the mean as the average of the data, I want to estimate the the error associated to mean calculated in this way. According to this book I need to calculate the "statistical inefficiency", or roughly the correlation time for the data in the series. For this I have to divide the series in blocks of varying length and, for each block length (t_b), the variance of the block averages (v_b). Then, if the variance of the whole series is v_a (that is, v_b when t_b=1), I have to obtain the limit, as t_b tends to infinity, of (t_b*v_b/v_a), and that is the inefficiency s. Then the error in the mean is sqrt(v_a*s/N), where N is the total number of points. So, this means that only one every s points is uncorrelated. I assume this can be done with R, and maybe there's some package that does it already, but I'm new to R. Can anyone tell me how to do it? I have already found out how to read the data series and calculate the mean and variance. A data sample, as requested: # t(ps) dH/dl(kJ/mol)

@LINK:/questions/12691172/suspicious-io-behavior-system-out-does-not-flush
@TITLE:Suspicious IO behavior: System.out does not flush
@CONTENT:I am working on a GA which used to work fine up until last week. In my efforts of optimizing the code I somehow broke the output sequence where the program dumps information about each generation of individuals. In all my debug efforts I came to understand that it's probably a flushing problem, but I can't really put my finger on the crux. The odd thing is that I actually did not touch any part of the IO since the last working version of the code. The GA is part of a much larger software where there is a progress console which is essentially a way to "mirror" System.out and System.err to the GUI. From my debugging efforts I realized that the buffer does not flush even if I specifically call ps.flush(). What could be the reason of this problem?? Edit: To answer the questions in the comments, as well as further information on the problem: The rest of the software does it's output to the GUI and Eclipse console as normal, it's only the calls to the outputGenInfo() method (see below) that have disappeared If I add a notification line such as System.out.println("Fitness calculation is complete!"); in my evaluateGeneration() method which is called just before the outputGenInfo() the information for each generation gets printed exactly as expected... [That particular line was one of things I had trimmed during my optimization efforts] For mirroring/redirecting System.out I used the MessageConsole class written by Rob Camick which can be found here The suspicious code is as follows: /**
 * Convenience method for getting debug/info 
 * on this generation
 * @param ps - a <code>PrintStream</code> to output to
 * */
public void outputGenInfo(PrintStream ps){ // <-- ps = System.out by default

    double stdev_fitness = stats.getStandardDeviation();
    double mean_fitness = stats.getMean();
    double cv = stdev_fitness / mean_fitness;

    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    String new_line = System.getProperty("line.separator");
    sb.append(new_line);
    sb.append("+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++");

    sb.append(new_line);

@TITLE:Replacement framework for web based Java Swing UI [closed]
@CONTENT:I'm re-architecting an decade old Java web application (basicaly a product with very small user base). UI developed in Swing rendered in desktop web browsers using Java Applets. I had shortlisted similar 2 event driven technologies 1) GWT/Vaadin 2) JSF2/AJAX/Primafaces On further analysis we decided to go with 1) Even before we start work, further requirement from customer forced us to look into complete different web framework of Spring MVC + JS framework like JQuery or ExtJS. The reason was better support for mobile web application development using same server side architecture. Now, I'm little confused. So, inviting views and experiences of others on: If event driven frameworks are less suited for supporting HTML5 mobile devices clients If JavaScripts frameworks are less suited for replicating Swing like UI

@LINK:/questions/12689103/why-does-my-query-with-named-parameters-return-a-blank-result
@TITLE:Why does my query with named parameters return a blank result?
@CONTENT:I am converting my MySQL code over to PDO to take advantage of prepared statements. I was originally getting a fatal error as described in this question. I had solved that issue, but it brought up more problems when trying to add parameters. The code I am trying to get working is: include ("foo/bar.php");

try {
     $DBH = new PDO("mysql:host=$hostname;dbname=$database", $username, $password);
    }  
catch(PDOException $e) {  
    echo $e->getMessage();  
    }

    $mydate=date("Y-m-d",strtotime("-3 months"));

    $foo_query=$DBH->prepare("SELECT id, postdate, title, SUBSTRING_INDEX(body,' ',20) as preview_text, body FROM BarTable WHERE postdate = :postdate AND postdate > '$mydate' ORDER BY postdate DESC");
    $foo_query->execute( array('postdate' => $_REQUEST['postdate']) );

    $DBH=null;
 In English, this is meant to read "*take the current date and set it back 3 months calling it $mydate, then select all of those fields (also taking the first 20 words of the body and calling it 'preview_text') from my table where the postdate is equal to the parameter postdate and where postdate is greater than $mydate*". I am then displaying the results in the following (note this is now abridged): $foo_query->setFetchMode(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
    while($r=$foo_query->fetch()) {
    echo $r["id"];
    echo $r["title"];
    echo date("d-M-Y",strtotime($r["postdate"]));
    echo nl2br ($r["preview_text"]); }
 Now, while the SELECT query is written as: ("SELECT id, postdate, title, SUBSTRING_INDEX(body,' ',20) as preview_text, body FROM BarTable WHERE postdate > '$mydate' ORDER BY postdate DESC")
 ...it displays exactly what I need it to, but of course while this is prepared, it contains no parameters so only achieves 50% of the goal. I was under the impression the way of preparing the statement that I outlined initially would be fine as per the tutorials and advice I have already been given. I have tried to print my error and it brings up no error. I manually sent the query as follows and get no returns. Note I have tried the date strings in all manner of permutations: ("SELECT id, postdate, title, SUBSTRING_INDEX(body,' ',20) as preview_text, body FROM BarTable WHERE postdate = 20121001 AND postdate > 20120701 ORDER BY postdate DESC")
 EDIT: The above was pointed out as incorrect but I will keep it here for reference as this section is explained in the comments below. EDIT: Manually sending the query now displays correctly when typing: ("SELECT id, postdate, title, SUBSTRING_INDEX(body,' ',20) as preview_text, body FROM BarTable WHERE postdate = '2012-09-30 08:38:23' ORDER BY postdate DESC")
 The query does not display at all when typing any of the following: ("SELECT id, postdate, title, SUBSTRING_INDEX(body,' ',20) as preview_text, body FROM BarTable WHERE postdate = :postdate ORDER BY postdate DESC")
("SELECT id, postdate, title, SUBSTRING_INDEX(body,' ',20) as preview_text, body FROM BarTable WHERE postdate = :postdate AND postdate > '$mydate' ORDER BY postdate DESC")
("SELECT id, postdate, title, SUBSTRING_INDEX(body,' ',20) as preview_text, body FROM BarTable WHERE postdate = '2012-09-30 08:38:23' AND postdate > '2012-07-01 00:01' ORDER BY postdate DESC")
 I am thinking that I should bind the parameter in some way, but the tutorials I've read do not specifically say that I should always bind them - I'm unsure of how to proceed. EDIT : I have looked to bind the statement as follows with no success. The query seemingly ignores the bind so the state of the query acts as all of the above permutations without binding: $foo_query->bindParam (
   ":postdate", strtotime ( $_REQUEST['postdate']), PDO::PARAM_INT);
$foo_query->execute();
 What am I doing wrong, that isn't happening when I don't add parameters? Should I be declaring the :postdate parameter somewhere other than in the SELECT query? For the purposes of preventing SQL injection I would like to use named parameters as well as preparing the statement, but if I can't figure it out then I will just have to not used named parameters.
@CODE:include ("foo/bar.php");

try {
     $DBH = new PDO("mysql:host=$hostname;dbname=$database", $username, $password);
    }

    }

 The problem I am having is with the last class listed goBackListener, which effectively just closes the current window so the main menu screen is displayed again. I need a static reference to addItemFrame created in the addItemListener class. But changing it to static is an invalid modifier? How can I fix it?

@TITLE:Haskell Cardguess Game
@CONTENT:I am writing a Cardguess Game, where user sets the answer and lets the PC guess. For my project, the input card number is 2. Then, I need to write the cardguess algorithm. I have created the card module. data Suit = Club | Diamond | Heart | Spade
      deriving (Eq, Ord, Bounded, Enum)

suitchars = "CDHS"

data Rank =
    R2 | R3 | R4 | R5 | R6 | R7 | R8 | R9 | R10 |
    Jack | Queen | King | Ace
         deriving (Eq, Ord, Bounded, Enum)

rankchars = "23456789TJQKA"

data Card = Card {suit::Suit, rank::Rank}
      deriving (Eq, Bounded)

instance Ord Card where
    compare (Card s1 r1) (Card s2 r2) =
        let suitorder = compare s1 s2
            in  if suitorder == EQ then compare r1 r2 else suitorder

instance Enum Card where
    fromEnum (Card s r) = (fromEnum s)*13 + (fromEnum r)
    toEnum n = (Card s r)
     where s = toEnum (n `div` 13)
           r = toEnum (n `mod` 13)
 and my strategy is to separate both Suit and Rank into two parts. initial guess could be Card Club R5 , Card Heart Jack Then I will be given the feedback, and, according to it, I will try nextGuess, so on so far, till getting the right answer. I have written the initialGuess function. i put the remaining cards in the GameState. initialGuess :: Int -> ([Card], GameState)
initialGuess card_number 
     | card_number == 2   = ((Card Club R5):(Card Heart J),cardDeck)
 and now, I need to write the nextGuess code. nextGuess :: ([Card],GameState) -> (Int,Int,Int,Int,Int) ->([Card],GameState)
 (Int,Int,Int,Int,Int) is the feedback value. How can i represent the first parameter ([Card],GameState), which means the previous guess cards and previous GameState.

@TITLE:Where to listen for broadcast action with MVVMCross
@CONTENT:Making my Bluetooth application I need access to some broadcast actions on the Android side of my code. All this is run in my Core, so I have a ViewModel that will call through my interface public interface IConnectionService

 But I cant put the [Android.Runtime.Register("ACTION_FOUND")] and [Android.Runtime.Register("ACTION_STATE_CHANGED")] on my class, this only works if I try to put it on my View, but if I do that I need logic in my view?

@TITLE:Draw multiple objects with textures
@CONTENT:I want to draw cubes using textures. void OperateWithMainMatrix(ESContext* esContext, GLfloat offsetX, GLfloat offsetY, GLfloat offsetZ) {

UserData *userData = (UserData*) esContext->userData;
ESMatrix modelview;
ESMatrix perspective;
    //Manipulation with matrix 
    ...
    glVertexAttribPointer(userData->positionLoc, 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 0, cubeFaces);
    //in cubeFaces coordinates verticles cube
    glVertexAttribPointer(userData->normalLoc, 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 0, cubeFaces);
    //for normals (use in fragment shaider for textures)

    glEnableVertexAttribArray(userData->positionLoc);
    glEnableVertexAttribArray(userData->normalLoc);

    // Load the MVP matrix
    glUniformMatrix4fv(userData->mvpLoc, 1, GL_FALSE, 
                       (GLfloat*)&userData->mvpMatrix.m[0][0]);

    //Bind base map
    glActiveTexture(GL_TEXTURE0);
    glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP, userData->baseMapTexId);

    //Set the base map sampler to texture unit to 0
    glUniform1i(userData->baseMapLoc, 0);

   // Draw the cube
    glDrawArrays(GL_TRIANGLES, 0, 36);
   }
 (coordinates transformation is in OperateWithMainMatrix() ) Then Draw() function is called: void Draw(ESContext *esContext)
{
   UserData *userData = esContext->userData;
   // Set the viewport
   glViewport(0, 0, esContext->width, esContext->height);

   // Clear the color buffer
   glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);

   // Use the program object
   glUseProgram(userData->programObject);

  OperateWithMainMatrix(esContext, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);

  eglSwapBuffers(esContext->eglDisplay, esContext->eglSurface);
}
 This work fine, but if I try to draw multiple cubes (next code for example): void Draw(ESContext *esContext)
{ ...

    // Use the program object
    glUseProgram(userData->programObject);

    OperateWithMainMatrix(esContext, 2.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);
    OperateWithMainMatrix(esContext, 1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);
    OperateWithMainMatrix(esContext, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);
    OperateWithMainMatrix(esContext, -1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);
    OperateWithMainMatrix(esContext, -2.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);
    eglSwapBuffers(esContext->eglDisplay, esContext->eglSurface);
}
 A side faces overlapes frontal face. This process is illustrated on image: Alternate picture (with colours and clean image): The side face of the right cube overlaps frontal face of the center cube. How can i remove this effect and display miltiple cubes without it?
@CODE:void OperateWithMainMatrix(ESContext* esContext, GLfloat offsetX, GLfloat offsetY, GLfloat offsetZ) {

UserData *userData = (UserData*) esContext->userData;
ESMatrix modelview;
ESMatrix perspective;
    //Manipulation with matrix 
    ...
    glVertexAttribPointer(userData->positionLoc, 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 0, cubeFaces);
    //in cubeFaces coordinates verticles cube
    glVertexAttribPointer(userData->normalLoc, 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 0, cubeFaces);
    //for normals (use in fragment shaider for textures)

    glEnableVertexAttribArray(userData->positionLoc);
    glEnableVertexAttribArray(userData->normalLoc);

    // Load the MVP matrix
    glUniformMatrix4fv(userData->mvpLoc, 1, GL_FALSE,

   // Draw the cube
    glDrawArrays(GL_TRIANGLES, 0, 36);

@TITLE:Displaying List of AutoHotkey Hotkeys
@CONTENT:I¡¦ve written script that contains numerous hotkeys (general structure is as below). I would like to create another one that when pressed displays a list of all of the hotkeys and their corresponding descriptions that the script contains in a nice, formatted table. The formatting and display are tenuous since AutoHotkey¡¦s output is limited to message-boxes, but possible. More problematic is getting the hotkeys and corresponding descriptions. The hotkeys all call the same function with different arguments. I considered adding a variable to the function so that depending on the value, the function either performs the normal function when triggered by the normal hotkeys, or builds a string or something when triggered from the special display hotkey. I cannot figure out a way to programmatically access the script¡¦s hotkeys at all. I checked the docs and there don¡¦t seem to be any A_ variables that can be used for this purpose, nor does the Hotkey command lend itself well (it can be used to test if a hotkey exists, but looping through the innumerable combinations is, at best, tedious). Failed attempts: I tried using Elliot¡¦s suggestion of parsing the script itself (replacing the path with %A_ScriptFullPath%, and while it does work for a raw script, it does not when the script is compiled I tried assigning the entire hotkey section of the script to a variable as a continuation section and then parsing the variable and creating hotkeys using the Hotkey command. This worked well right up until the last part because the Hotkey command cannot take arbitrary commands as the destination and requires existing labels. The ListHotkeys command is not applicable because it only displays the hotkeys as plain text in the control window. Does anyone know how I can display a list of the hotkeys and either their corresponding arguments or comments? Example script: SomeFunc(foobar)
{
  MsgBox %foobar%
}

         !^#A::SomeFunc("a") ; blah
 ^+NumpadMult::SomeFunc("c") ; blivet
        ^+!#`::SomeFunc("b") ; baz

@TITLE:Optional Capture Group Not Capturing
@CONTENT:<tr><td align=right>Name:</td><td align=left><b><font color=black>Nathan</font></b></td></tr>
<tr><td align=right>Extension:</td><td align=left><b>222</b></td></tr>
 I have the above HTML glob of text (can't be changed) and I'd like a regular expression that returns 3 capturing groups, the label (Name|Extension) the font color (black|red) and the data (\w+). I'm having some trouble returning capture group 2, the font color. As you can see, it's not present on the "Extension" row of the table, so I've made the capture group optional. When I do that, it's not matching at all on the first row. I've tried fiddling a lot with trial and error of a bunch of different combinations of quantifiers, but I still can't get the result I'm looking for. Here's the pattern I have so far: (Name|Extension):.*?(?:<font color=(black|red)>)?.*?>(\w+) I believe the .*? is consuming what would be the optional capture group and only matching the 1st and 3rd group. If someone could explain to me where I've gone wrong, that would be great. Edit: As someone who is trying to learn more about regular expressions, I would appreciate it if people could interpret the data I have above as immutable text rather than HTML.
@CODE:<tr><td align=right>Name:</td><td align=left><b><font color=black>Nathan</font></b></td></tr>
<tr><td align=right>Extension:</td><td align=left><b>222</b></td></tr> (Name|Extension) (black|red) (\w+) (Name|Extension):.*?(?:<font color=(black|red)>)?.*?>(\w+) .*?

@CONTENT:I am coding a custom lockscreen app for android. I have managed to disable the back button. But the home button and the recent apps button on ICS proved not to be as easy. I searched around and came up with: @Override

    this.getWindow().setType(WindowManager.LayoutParams.TYPE_KEYGUARD);
    super.onAttachedToWindow();
}
 However, this throws IllegalArgumentException window type can not be changed after it is added. I then tried to set it in onCreate() but the home key still functions. I am willing to use root methods to achieve this. Is there any way to get it done? Any help would be appreciated!

@CONTENT:I am looking for a way to search across all IMAP folders on my mail server. I recently discovered the IMAP ESEARCH command, which extends the usual SEARCH command to search across folders. I cannot, however, seem to make it work. I have checked that the mail server supports ESEARCH. After telnet-ing in, I executed the following: * OK JAMES IMAP4rev1 Server Server server-address is ready.

 Note the presence of ESEARCH. I then tried the following ESEARCH, which fails. A4 ESEARCH IN (mailboxes "INBOX") unseen

 An ordinary search works fine: A5 SELECT INBOX

 From what I can read of the spec and the formal syntax this should work. Any help or pointers would be much appreciated.

@TITLE:How do I avoid NullPointerException with OneToOne mapping against a parent entity class?
@CONTENT:I have searched and found similar issues, but they don't quite seem to be the same problem as Why am I getting this NullPointer exception? OneToOne Mapping with hibernate/JBoss/Seam ANN-613 - NPE when mappedBy property is wrong on a @OneToOne ANN-558 - @OneToMany(mappedBy="") can not recognize properties in parent classes Hibernate Users - NPE with @Id on @OneToOne I have a few entities mapped like this: Person

 I want to add a new entity PersonPartDeux with a OneToOne mapping to Person. The resulting mapping should look something like this: Person + PersonPartDeux

  +--User
 When I do so, a NullPointerException is thrown while trying to load the mapping: java.lang.NullPointerException
    at org.hibernate.cfg.OneToOneSecondPass.doSecondPass(OneToOneSecondPass.java:135)
 How do I specify the mapping so I can avoid this exception? Here's my code: @Entity
@Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.JOINED)
public abstract class Person implements Serializable
{
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    public Long id;

    @Version
    public int version = 0;

    public String someText;
}

@Entity

 As for why I'm bothering, I need both the inheritance and the OneToOne mapping to solve different known issues in my application.

@TITLE:XAML - ListViewItem - IsEnabled Binding
@CONTENT:Please put me out of my misery: <ListView.ItemContainerStyle>
    <Style TargetType="ListViewItem">
        <Setter Property="IsEnabled" Value="{Binding MyBoolField}" />
    </Style>
</ListView.ItemContainerStyle>
 Where MyBoolField is a property available on each item in the ListView's assigned ItemsSource, and is of course of type bool. The desired behaviour is that the IsEnabled property of each ListViewItem is bound to the MyBoolField property of the object it contains (an element from the ListView's ItemsSource). The example above however pays no attention to this binding and is always true. If I set the value to false statically, the item becomes disabled as expected. I can only assume this is an issue of scoping, or a restriction on the use of bindings in this particular scenario, however I am unable to find any documentation to support this. Perhaps it is useful to know that bindings set up in the DataTemplate assigned to this ListView's ItemTemplate all work okay, so the problem is hopefully not that fundamental/stupid. Points from the Comments There is no relevant output in the debug 'Output' window. Binding the MyBoolField property elsewhere works fine, as such the underlying data source is providing a Boolean value correctly and this seems to be solely an issue of binding it in this context.

@TITLE:jquery plugin history.js not working properly in html4 browsers
@CONTENT:From my homepage, let's call it mysite.com, I click a link which has this href value: /home/home.php?doc=gym. So, the entire url is mysite.com/home/home.php?doc=gym# (The browser adds the # at the end of the url, but I need that to be before the parameters in order the plugin works fine). From that page, home.php, I clicked a link that I caught its event, load some Ajax data and want to change the url mysite.com/home/home.php?doc=gym to mysite.com/home/home.php?doc=pilates. So, what I do is: as soon as the content is loaded, I execute History.pushState(null, null, url); where url = ?doc=pilates. Here is when the problem comes, in Internet Explorer 8, for example, the new url is: mysite.com/home/home.php?doc=gym#home.php?doc=pilates instead of mysite.com/home/home.php?doc=pilates. And this happens, I suppose, because of the last thing I said in step 1. If I click another link and execute the pushState method, it replaces the ?doc=pilates with the parameters I wrote as a third parameter of the function, because it's after the # symbol.
@CODE:mysite.com href /home/home.php?doc=gym mysite.com/home/home.php?doc=gym# # home.php mysite.com/home/home.php?doc=gym mysite.com/home/home.php?doc=pilates History.pushState(null, null, url); ?doc=pilates mysite.com/home/home.php?doc=gym#home.php?doc=pilates mysite.com/home/home.php?doc=pilates 1. pushState ?doc=pilates #

@TITLE:Bounds and Frame size in viewDidLoad
@CONTENT:I push a view controller (mainVC) and add some subviews to it. Most of these views are built on-demand, as the user takes some action. When I build each view, I refer to mainVC.view.bounds to size the view. The ones that are built on demand size just fine, but the first one (which I add in viewDidLoad) does not seem to account for either the hidden navigation bar or the unhidden toolbar - I'm not sure which. Other questions seem to assure me that viewDidLoad is the correct place to refer to the bounds and to add these subviews. Am I misinformed? Logging yields the following: In viewDidLoad the bounds height is 548. In viewWillAppear the bounds height is 460 (-44 x 2). In viewWillAppear I hide the navigation bar, but the height is the same before and after. At all later times, the bounds height is 504 (-44 x 1). Why is the bounds height not updated by the time I attempt to read it in viewDidLoad?

 Something like this JSON.parse returns [Object] object back with no data at all (I can see the data is being successfully returned because it returns all the data as a string if I have JSON.parse turned off). {"AppName":"TheName","AppUrl":"https:\/\/app\/icons\/unknown.png","aGUID":"45c055d2-2edc-d4444"."DateCreated":"8\/23\/2012 11:04AM", {"ID":"yser123",Name":"User"}}
 What is the best way to go about parsing this data in javascript(I am not able to use jquery)? Note: I had wrote the JSON assume its valid Here is the code I am using to retreive the data.. var xhReq = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhReq.open("POST", "ClientService.svc/REST/GetDetail", false);
xhReq.send(null);
var serverResponse = xhReq.responseText;

@TITLE:Potential downfalls from changing character set in MySQL?
@CONTENT:In troubleshooting a problem with "?" marks that appear in a web application generated PDF, I've discovered that the database has a mismash of character encodings. Most are latin, some are utf, and a few are something else. While referring to this excellent question and array of responses ( change mysql default character set to UTF8 in my.cnf? ), I now have a fairly clear idea of what needs to happen next. What I'm not entirely clear on is whether changing the character set in my.cnf and on the tables themselves via ALTER TABLE would potentially destroy data or create other "gotchas". I'm working with hundreds of tables and about 10gb of data. Is this generally a "safe" procedure to undertake?

 Then the functions: onFirstButtoncheckchange: function(menucheckitem, checked, options) {

    var t = Ext.getCmp('f_type');
               if (t.checked)
                   goToFunction(???);

    },
 onSecondButtoncheckchange: function(menucheckitem, checked, options) {

    var t = Ext.getCmp('s_type');

                   goToFunction(???);
                 .
                 .
    },
 1- Is there anyway to use one listener and gather all different functions in it ? 2- How can I send the current item to goToFunction() as you see in the code ?

@TITLE:User.Identity.Name sometimes blank with Windows authentication
@CONTENT:My web app uses Windows authentication. All other authentication methods are disabled. It works at first; User.Identity.Name returns "MYDOMAIN\myuser." However, if I wait 131 seconds (yes, I timed it, though I'm not sure it always takes exactly that long) and reload the page, User.Identity.IsAuthenticated = false and User.Identity.Name = "". At this point I can just reload the page and it works again, for another 131 seconds of inactivity. Relevant parts of web.config: <authentication mode="Windows" />

<identity impersonate="false" />

 More information, possibly relevant: My solution is deployed to two different IIS applications. The first one is for internal users; it just uses Windows authentication. The second one is for external users; it uses anonymous authentication (in the root folder only) and forms authentication. I'm only having problems with the internal site.

            }
          ...rest of the columns
 when I click the icon, I get the "test approve" message, so it works as expected! If I add the render method bellow to disable the action column for rows that are already approved:             renderer: function (value, metadata, record) {
                if (record.get('Approved') = 1) {

                }
            }
 the handler stops working on the enabled itens. It seems like the renderer function is preventing the handler to be called. I even tried to add the handler code inside the renderer, but also no success. Any idea why this would happen?

@TITLE:Generate CREATE INDEX statements in SQL Server
@CONTENT:Does anyone have a script to list of CREATE INDEX statements for all existing indexes in a SQL Server database? This thread List of all index & index columns in SQL Server DB has great tips on how to find them. But a script to generate the CREATE INDEX statements would be great. Sometimes we come into a situation without adequate data, or indexes have been added in an ad-hoc manner over time without documentation, so the create statements are missing. Like in a situation I find myself in right now. Thanks.

What I want to achieve is: 1) When user log out from home page, he/she should not be "logged in" by clicking the back or forward button in the browser. 2) It is sure that the browser will store a history of the home page. But when the user click on the history link in the home page available in the browser, it should be redirected to the login page instead of the home page. I have tried clearing the cache by using the following code in page_load event in the home page: HttpContext.Current.Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.NoCache);
Response.Cache.SetNoStore();
Response.Cache.SetExpires(DateTime.UtcNow.AddMinutes(-1));
 But it is still not working. Any kind of help is highly appreciated.

@TITLE:Grails message.properties changes not taking effect in deployed application
@CONTENT:I have a really annoying problem with a deployed Grails application on tomcat 7 I created a tool in my website that basically allows the site admin to edit message.properties files so that he can change the messages for a certain language as he desire. All the changes are saved successfully to the file he edited. In development, while running the website from STS (Soring Source Tools Suite; somethng like eclips) I just refresh the website in the browser and I see the changes instantly, all the changes that made to the message.properties file for the selected language is taking effect correctly. But in the deployed application (same code same config no errors) the admin do the same thing, edit the resources in the same way as before, the message.properties file is saved with the new values correctly, but, I dont see the changes in the browser, unless I restarted tomcat, or after number of hours! I've disabled the tomcat 7 caching, and I still face the same problem. I've spent more than 4 days googling, but all the results are not related to my problem, and most of them are related to hibernate caching. So, my question simply is as follows: I want to go to a message.properties file in my deployed grails application, lets say message_en.properties, change lets say default.welcome.message=Welcome to default.welcome.message=Hello, World! And then open any browser, and see Hello, World! instead of Welcome Thanks in advance for any help =')

@LINK:/questions/12671053/why-does-binding-fail-when-binding-a-child-element-to-another-element-when-the-p
@TITLE:Why does binding fail when binding a child element to another element when the parent succeeds?
@CONTENT:Say I have two classes that can reference a third UI object (in this example a button). In addition, the parent class can contain an element of the child class. If they both are bound to the same control, the same way, the child will fail but the parent succeed. Is this a bug in WPF? The parent : class MyFrameworkElement : FrameworkElement
{
    // A depenedency property that will contain a child element sub-element
    private static readonly DependencyProperty ChildElementProperty =
                    DependencyProperty.Register("ChildElement",
                    typeof(MyChildElement),
                    typeof(MyFrameworkElement),
                    new PropertyMetadata());

    [Category("ChildProperties")]
    public MyChildElement ChildElement
    {
        set { SetValue(ChildElementProperty, value); }
        get { return (MyChildElement)GetValue(ChildElementProperty); }
    }


    // Now, a reference to some other control, in this case we will bind a button to it!
    public UIElement ButtonReferenceInParent
    {
        get { return (UIElement)GetValue(ButtonReferenceInParentProperty); }
        set { SetValue(ButtonReferenceInParentProperty, value); }
    }

    // Using a DependencyProperty as the backing store for ButtonReferenceInParent.  This enables animation, styling, binding, etc...
    public static readonly DependencyProperty ButtonReferenceInParentProperty =
        DependencyProperty.Register("ButtonReferenceInParent", typeof(UIElement), typeof(MyFrameworkElement), new UIPropertyMetadata(null));
 And then the child : public class MyChildElement : FrameworkElement
{
    public UIElement ButtonReferenceInChild
    {
        get { return (UIElement)GetValue(ButtonReferenceInChildProperty); }
        set { SetValue(ButtonReferenceInChildProperty, value); }
    }

    public static readonly DependencyProperty ButtonReferenceInChildProperty =
        DependencyProperty.Register("ButtonReferenceInChild", typeof(UIElement), typeof(MyChildElement), new UIPropertyMetadata(null));
}
 OK - Now say I Add them to my XAML like this : <Grid>
    <my:MyFrameworkElement x:Name="ParentName" HorizontalAlignment="Stretch" VerticalAlignment="Stretch" ButtonReferenceInParent="{Binding ElementName=buttonisme}">
        <my:MyFrameworkElement.ChildElement>
            <my:MyChildElement x:Name="ChildName" ButtonReferenceInChild="{Binding ElementName=buttonisme}"/>
        </my:MyFrameworkElement.ChildElement>
    </my:MyFrameworkElement>

    <Button x:Name="buttonisme" Click="buttonisme_Click" />
</Grid>
 Why does the binding work on the parent but then fail on the child, when I am using the EXACT same notation? Here is my test code...      Console.WriteLine("Parent button reference is {0}", ParentName.ButtonReferenceInParent);

        if (ChildName.ButtonReferenceInChild == null)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Child button reference is null!");
        } 
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Child button is {0}", ChildName.ButtonReferenceInChild);
        }
 And here is the test result... Parent button reference is System.Windows.Controls.Button Child button reference is null!
@CODE:class MyFrameworkElement : FrameworkElement
{
    // A depenedency property that will contain a child element sub-element
    private static readonly DependencyProperty ChildElementProperty =

@TITLE:Objective c - Iad WARNING: More than 10 instances of ADBannerView
@CONTENT:i have developed a tab bar application. Like title i have an iad banner positioned at bottom of screen. I have implemented this method to create/destroy banner and test iad works correctly: Create: -(void)viewWillAppear:(BOOL)animated {
     if(!adView) {
        adView = [[ADBannerView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 315, 310, 45)];
        adView.requiredContentSizeIdentifiers = [NSSet setWithObject:ADBannerContentSizeIdentifierPortrait];
        adView.currentContentSizeIdentifier = ADBannerContentSizeIdentifierPortrait;
        adView.delegate = self;
        [self.view addSubview:adView];
    }
 Destroy:     - (void)viewWillDisappear:(BOOL)animated {
    [super viewWillDisappear:animated];

    // iAd
    if (adView != nil) {
        adView.delegate = nil;
        adView.hidden = YES;
        adView = nil;
       [adView release];
    }  
}
 But if i try to rapid change view from tab bar i receive this error: WARNING: More than 10 instances of ADBannerView or ADInterstitialView currently exist. This is a misuse of the iAd API, and ad performance will suffer as a result. This message is printed only once. But the method create and destroy are always called. What i can do to debug this warning problem? Thanks so much.

 While it works, I'm sure there's a better way to do this, so I would be asking for refactoring help I guess. Many Thanks in advance Ed1. I have realized this is a Jquery Question and need it to check that if "input[id='rb']" is checked (from db) then $j("#asset_list").show(); without needing a change listener

@TITLE:Improve MMO game performance
@CONTENT:we are all aware of the popular trend of MMO games. where players face each other live. My area of concern, is storage of player moves and game results. Using Csharp and PostgreSql v9.0 via NPGSQL adapter The game client is browser based ASP.NET and calls Csharp functions for all database related processing To understand my query, please consider the following scenario we store game progress in a postgres table. For Example a tournament starts with four players and following activity Each player starts with 100hitpoints player 1 makes a strike (we refer to a chart to convert blows to hitpoints with random-range %) player 2 has 92HP, and returns a light blow, so player1 has 98hp The above two round will now be in Game Progress Table, as ROW Player1HP Player2HP Strikefrom StrikeTo ReturnStrikeHP Round TimeStamp StrikeMethod
1      100       100         0        0            0          0
2       98        92        P1        P2           2          1
 To find if tournament has ended we check 3 players have zero hitpoints Or gametime has elapsed a stipulated timeout value from last progress our table has a primarykey as tournamentid a random 32 character code on basis of playerids (8 for each player) There are other columns such as armor , mana, spells , which all get carried forward for each player , in total there are 48 columns - 12 for each player and their attributes Finally there is a gameResult table that has result of a tournament , with tournamentid, tournament_timestamp, gameresult (complete, PlayerSurrender, InvalidSession , SecurityHack, TimeOut), winnerPlayer , playerMetrics , rowIDfrom, rowIDto QUERY My questions are focussed on reducing load on Game database or Sql queries a) How to detect if a player has not logged in simutaneously and opened two game sessions but without having to refer to a Database or using Sql b) How to control the surge of records into the GameProgress table. so that players get response quicker. The Server starts to lag at peak hours or when 1000 players are online There is a tremendous flow of sql queries, for ex. even in the current game version
There are average/minimum 100 tournaments online per 12 minutes or 500 players / hour
In Game Progress table, We are storing each player move 
    a 12 round tourament of 4 player there can be 48 records
    plus around same number for spells or special items
    a total of 96 per tourament or 48000 record inserts per hour (500 players/hour)
 I am also considering using a background process in Csharp, that keeps moving expired tournament records from GameProgresstable to another Database where we have a server free of gameplay load. c) How often should we run vaccum full of postgres . I am open to new applications opensource or toPay, that can improve performance. For ex. we used FastCsvReader http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/9258/A-Fast-CSV-Reader to improve enumeration of server log files. regards Arvind

@TITLE:Setting commit author in SharpSvn .NET library throws SvnRepisitoryIOException exception
@CONTENT:If you have experience with using the SharpSvn .NET library, I could use your expertise in setting the commit author during an SVN commit. I've tried a few things, but they all throw an SvnRepisitoryIOException unless the user is saved in TortoiseSVN. However, I want to use different user credentials depending on the situation. If I've saved a user's default credentials, TortoiseSVN remembers them in Settings > Saved Data > Authenticated Data, and is able to commit a file using that authenticated user as the commit author. If you click "Clear" here, SharpSVN won't know who to authenticate during a commit. Assume you have these directives in your class: using SharpSvn; using SharpSvn.Security; I'm using the free version of VisualSVN server for Windows. And I have two users, one being named "user1" and password of "pass1" to keep things simple in the examples below that failed. How can I prevent this exception from being thrown and commit using different users for the author (in my log of the commit)? Attempt #1:     using (SvnClient client = new SvnClient())

@TITLE:ASP.NET Inconsistent PDF file download results
@CONTENT:I'm working on a ASP.NET (3.5) website that contains a treeview; the nodes' values are set to a filepath (on the server) of a PDF file. When the user clicks a treenode, the server-side code gets the node value (file path), creates a FileInfo object, and (after setting all the header Content-type, Cache-Control, etc. correctly) calls Response.TransmitFile(xxxxpath) to send to the user's browser. This works fine on the major browsers, on major devices (PCs, Macs, iOS devices). The file downloads correctly and opens on the user's machine. But on certain devices and certain browsers, the PDF file does not open. On Android devices, it appears that Firefox downloads and opens the PDFs correctly, but the stock Android browser does not. On a Kindle Fire, it appears the Silk browser downloads the file successfully, but when trying to open it, I see an error: "PDF trailer not found"....or it says the PDF is DRM-protected (which it is not). I haven't tried another browser (if there is one) on the Fire. I've experimented using anchor links in static HTML markup, and the problem browsers appear to download and display the PDFs correctly when accessed this way. There seems to be an issue (inconsistency?) with the way ASP.NET sends the response to the browser when done via code. I've used Response.Flush, Response.WriteFile, Response.BinaryWrite, Response.Close, Response.End, etc., and they all produce the same result: MOST browsers handle the file, but SOME cannot handle the PDF. So, is there some issue with the way ASP.NET constructs the Response object (especially when sending back PDFs) that some browsers don't like? TIA.

@TITLE:How do i assosiate my PICO class with a specific table in my database with Entity Framework 5
@CONTENT:I have a table in my db (a many to many table) that two classes A and B have created like this.     this.HasMany(t => t.TrafficImageQuestions)
       .WithMany(t => t.TrafficImages)
        .Map(m =>
            {
                m.ToTable("TrafficImage_Answers");
                m.MapLeftKey("TrafficImagesGuid");
                m.MapRightKey("TrafficImageQuestionsId");


            });
 Now i would like to assosiate my custom class to this same table "TrafficImage_Answers", the class offcause have the left and right key and then also a 3. custom property. (i did add the column to the database "Answer")     public class TrafficImageAnswer
    {
        public System.Guid TrafficImageGuid { get; set; }
        public int TrafficImageQuestionId { get; set; }
        public byte Answer { get; set; }
    }
 I am doing this as i want entity model to keep track of my many to many relationship of A and B and still be able to look up the 3. property Answer that is in the database. What i have tried I tried to do the following:     this.Property(t => t.TrafficImageQuestionId)
        .HasDatabaseGeneratedOption(DatabaseGeneratedOption.None);
    this.Property(t => t.TrafficImageGuid)
        .HasDatabaseGeneratedOption(DatabaseGeneratedOption.None);

    // Table & Column Mappings
    this.ToTable("TrafficImage_Answers");
 But i get that the table already exists, logic. I need to tell it that it just should use that table and not try to create it. (im doing this with DB mitigrations in EF 5 and Package manager).
@CODE:this.HasMany(t => t.TrafficImageQuestions)
       .WithMany(t => t.TrafficImages)
        .Map(m =>

@CONTENT:In strict mode, indirect calls to eval should have this bound to the global object in eval code. 10.4.2: In Edition 5, indirect calls to the eval function use the global environment as both the variable environment and lexical environment for the eval code.

@TITLE:Dynamic range compression at audio volume normalization
@CONTENT:I already asked about audio volume normalization. On most methods (e.g. ReplayGain, which I am most interested in), I might get peaks that exceed the PCM limit (as can also be read here). Simple clipping would probably be the worst thing I can do. As Wikipedia suggests, I should do some form of dynamic range compression. I am speaking about the function which I'm applying on each individual PCM sample value. On another similar question, one answer suggests that doing this is not enough or not the thing I should do. However, I don't really understand that as I still have to handle the clipping case. Does the answer suggest to do the range compression on multiple samples at once and do to simple hard clipping in addition on every sample? Leaving that aside, the functions discussed in the Wikipedia article seem to be somewhat not what I want (in many cases, I would still have the clipping case in the end). I am thinking about using something like tanh. Is that a bad idea? It would reduce the volume slightly but guarantee that I don't get any clipping. My application is a generic music player. I am searching for a solution which mostly works best for everyone so that I can always turn it on and the user very likely does not want to turn this off.

@TITLE:ASP.NET Inconsistent PDF file download results
@CONTENT:I'm working on a ASP.NET (3.5) website that contains a treeview; the nodes' values are set to a filepath (on the server) of a PDF file. When the user clicks a treenode, the server-side code gets the node value (file path), creates a FileInfo object, and (after setting all the header Content-type, Cache-Control, etc. correctly) calls Response.TransmitFile(xxxxpath) to send to the user's browser. This works fine on the major browsers, on major devices (PCs, Macs, iOS devices). The file downloads correctly and opens on the user's machine. But on certain devices and certain browsers, the PDF file does not open. On Android devices, it appears that Firefox downloads and opens the PDFs correctly, but the stock Android browser does not. On a Kindle Fire, it appears the Silk browser downloads the file successfully, but when trying to open it, I see an error: "PDF trailer not found"....or it says the PDF is DRM-protected (which it is not). I haven't tried another browser (if there is one) on the Fire. I've experimented using anchor links in static HTML markup, and the problem browsers appear to download and display the PDFs correctly when accessed this way. There seems to be an issue (inconsistency?) with the way ASP.NET sends the response to the browser when done via code. I've used Response.Flush, Response.WriteFile, Response.BinaryWrite, Response.Close, Response.End, etc., and they all produce the same result: MOST browsers handle the file, but SOME cannot handle the PDF. So, is there some issue with the way ASP.NET constructs the Response object (especially when sending back PDFs) that some browsers don't like? TIA.

@CONTENT:I'm trying to detect when one of my notifications is cleared (either by swiping it away individually, or through the "delete all" notifications button).

NotificationManager nm = (NotificationManager) getSystemService(NOTIFICATION_SERVICE);
Notification notif = new Notification(R.drawable.flag_red_large, reminderName, System.currentTimeMillis());

notif.deleteIntent = PendingIntent.getService(this, notifID, new Intent(this, CleanUpIntent.class), 0);

    //Destroy the activity/notification.
    finish();

}

class CleanUpIntent extends IntentService {
    public CleanUpIntent() {
        super("CleanUpIntent");
    }

    @Override

        Intent i = new Intent("com.utilityapps.YouForgotWhat.DisplayReminderNotification");

}
 As you can see, I threw in a System.out.println() into my sub-class to check to see if my code is even reaching that class. I can't see that line in my LogCat output, so I'm assuming that for some reason, my PendingIntent.getService() line isn't working. How do I fix this issue? Thanks! :D

@TITLE:Will pooled SQL Connections be scavenged if there is still a reference to them?
@CONTENT:@usr and I are having a disagreement in another question about whether or not .NET will scavenge open connections that have been idle, but still maintain a held reference. I maintain, based on documentation, that if the physical connection is idle for a period of time, it will be reclaimed after a period of time even if a SQLConnection object reference remains held. usr claims that this won't happen, and it only reclaims connections that no longer have references. His assertion as this would make connection pooling unreliable and would cause havoc with transactions. I will admit, the documentation is vague about the issue of held references. I'm looking for an authoritative answer on this, not just guessing. Either someone has experimented and proven either case, or someone with knowledge of the internal workings. So which one is it? EDIT: I think the confusion here is with the terminology of "Closed". What appears to be the case is that the documentation refers to closing the physical connection as "Removing" the connection from the pool. While "Closing" refers to releasing the open physical connection back into the pool for re-use. Open connections can still be aborted, but it's unclear if the pooler marks this as invalid if it's still held as open by the client app (ie client app has not yet called close on the aborted connection) Not sure it really matters though, other than as part of the pool count.

@TITLE:Export large database to file without mysqldump, low memory footprint [duplicate]
@CONTENT:Possible Duplicate: memory usage export from database to csv in php I am exporting a large database and wanted to know the best way to make it have a low memory footprint. I realize that I must do this in cycles that have a time limit and use low memory, fetching say 100 rows at a time and saving the information to the file then redirect to start a new cycle starting from where it finished on the previous cycle. I am wondering whats the best way buffer the data to file and not run out of memory, at present the script gets all data as a string then saves to file when it has finished getting all rows from the database. Some times it runs out of memory, hence the need to fix. Do I use fwrite() on the data fetched from the database instead of putting into a var or use a temp file? If I use a temp file when do I merge/rename into the backup file? Basically what is the best way for the script to export the database data into a file without getting the error "Fatal Error: PHP Allowed Memory Size Exhausted"?     function backup_tables($host, $user, $pass, $db, $tables = '*')

I am having a website, where I show post's related to category, say category=php, so I pass this as a get request $_GET['category'] == 'php';
 Now currently what am doing is something like this : $pocategory = $_GET['category'];

if($pocategory == 'php' || $pocategory == 'javascript') {
//Then show related posts
} else {
header('Location:404.php');
exit;
}
 I mean I just want php and javascript as valid request's value, rest I want to redirect to 404 but am not understanding how to do it so I did this way, what if am having more than 50 categories? I cant list them all in this if condition, Inshort how to detect whether the given get request value is invalid or not.. Any help will be much appreciated.

@TITLE:Generating Truly Random Numbers [duplicate]
@CONTENT:Possible Duplicate: Generating random numbers effectively I need to generate random numbers in my C++ application. I know from reading these two articles -- http://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/random.html write a c function that generates one random number, or a pair of random numbers, or a triplet of random numbers given the particular ranges -- that random numbers can be generated using srand() and rand() but in both cases the current time according to the system clock is used as a seed. But I read in the first article that rand() will create the same random numbers if the seed is the same. So if two different users ran my application at the same time then they would have the same random numbers. Which would be pointless because I need the random numbers to be unique for the most part. (I know they cant be truly 100% unique if they are generated randomly) So my question is can I create a random seed not based on system time and if so how, why does rand() produce the same numbers with the same seed and is there a way to make rand() produce different numbers with the same seed, or is there any other way to generate random numbers?

Is it advisable in the given scenario to keep the connection pooling off,(given all the connections are disposed properly after use)since: It is a nightly job and there wont be much load on the Oracle server. Connection Pooling might return stale connections, for which validate settings/exception handing needs to be done.

@CONTENT:I used the RC version of Visual Studio 2012 to create an ASP.NET Webforms project and I intentionally took the 4.0 version of .Net and of the project template to avoid complications after the release of VS2012.

 As I noticed in the references, following assembly references are broken: Microsoft.ScriptManager.jQuery Microsoft.ScriptManager.jQuery.UI.Component System.Web.Providers I tried to re-install jQuery using NuGet but did not find these assemblies. If I now create a new .Net 4.0 ASP.NET Webforms project in Visual Studio 2012 I get a lot of new references which are not present in my current (originally created in the RC-version, now opened in VS2012 RTM), like: AspNet.ScriptManager.jQuery AspNet.ScriptManager.jQuery.UI.Combined but I can't find them among reference sources if I try to add a new reference to my original project.

@TITLE:Evenly spaced fixed-width columns - in a responsive setting
@CONTENT:I'm trying to create some evenly spaced columns (an ol), with the columns themselves being fixed width. So far, I've managed to achieve the desired effect by using table layout, and nesting an additional element inside the list item. HTML: <ol>
    <li><div></div></li>
    <li><div></div></li>
    <li><div></div></li>
    <li><div></div></li>
    <li><div></div></li>
</ol>?
 CSS: ol {
    display: table;
    width: 100%;
}

li {
    display: table-cell;
}

div {
    margin: 0 auto;
    width: 100px;
    height: 250px;
}
 This works great, but has the following 2 shortcomings: As you can see in the demo, the first & last columns don't line up flush with the parent's outer edges. This can't really be used responsively. The only thing you can do at smaller widths is stack them, but I'd like to split them (2 or 3 per row). Is what I'm after even possible in CSS alone? I know there are a plethora of ways to accomplish this in JS, but I'm after a CSS-only solution. P.S. I don't care about IE7-, but I do need to support IE8. CSS3 selectors are OK though, since I'm anyhow using selectivizr in the project (I know that's JS ;-)).

glBindBuffer(GL_SHADER_STORAGE_BUFFER, bufferID);
glBufferData(GL_SHADER_STORAGE_BUFFER, numParticles*sizeof(Particle), NULL ,GL_STATIC_DRAW);


struct Particle* particles = (struct Particle*) glMapBufferRange(GL_SHADER_STORAGE_BUFFER, 0, numParticles*sizeof(Particle), GL_MAP_WRITE_BIT | GL_MAP_INVALIDATE_BUFFER_BIT);

for(int i = 0; i < numParticles; ++i){
    //.. Do something with particles..//
}

glUnmapBuffer(GL_SHADER_STORAGE_BUFFER);

@CONTENT:I have an app with two targets just about ready to ship but I still see the default app icon with the paper, pencil, etc. on the dock and in the main window when I select the app under Products. I have an icon.iconset folder with 16, 32, 128, 256, 512, and 1024, all following the icon_XxX and icon_XxX@2x naming; under Products in XCode I see my 16x16 icon.

All appears to be well, yet I'm still seeing the default icon in the doc. I'm using 4.5 but I had the same problem in 4.4.1. Icons are pngs. Any ideas? Thanks in advance.

 Is it right to assume that validation is only done whenever attributes are changed or set?

@LINK:/questions/12658197/what-is-the-operator-precedence-when-writing-a-double-inequality-in-python-expl
@TITLE:What is the operator precedence when writing a double inequality in Python (explicitly in the code, and how can this be overridden for arrays?)
@CONTENT:What is the specific code, in order, being executed when I ask for something like >>> 1 <= 3 >= 2
True
 If both have equal precedence and it's just the order of their evaluation, why does the second inequality function as (3 >= 2) instead of (True >= 2) Consider for example the difference between these >>> (1 < 3) < 2
True

>>> 1 < 3 < 2
False
 Is it just a pure syntactical short-cut hard-coded into Python to expand the second as the and of the two statements? Could I change this behavior for a class, such that a <= b <= c gets expanded to something different? It's looking like the following is the case a (logical operator) b (logical operator) c 
    --> (a logical operator b) and (b logical operator c)
 but the real question is how this gets implemented in code. I'm curious so that I can replicate this kind of __lt__ and __gt__ behavior in some of my own classes, but I am confused about how this is accomplished holding the middle argument constant. Here's a specific example: >>> import numpy as np

>>> tst = np.asarray([1,2,3,4,5,6])

>>> 3 <= tst
array([False, False,  True,  True,  True,  True], dtype=bool)

>>> 3 <= tst <= 5
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
/home/ely/<ipython-input-135-ac909818f2b1> in <module>()
----> 1 3 <= tst <= 5

ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
 It would be nice to override this so that it "just works" with arrays too, like this: >>> np.logical_and(3 <= tst, tst <= 5)
array([False, False,  True,  True,  True,  False], dtype=bool)
 Added for clarification In the comments it is indicated that I did a poor job of explaining the question. Here's some clarifying remarks: 1) I am not looking for a simple explanation of the fact that the interpreter pops an and in between the two chained inequalities. I already knew that and said so above. 2) For an analogy to what I want to do, consider the with statement (link). The following: with MyClass(some_obj) as foo:
    do_stuff()
 unpacks into foo = MyClass(some_obj)
foo.__enter__()
try:
    do_stuff()
finally:
    foo.__exit__()
 So by writing MyClass appropriately, I can do many special things inside of the with statement. I am asking whether there is a similar code unpacking of the chained inequality by which I can intercept what it's doing and redirect it to use array-style logical operators instead just for the classes I care about. I feel this is very clear from my question, especially the example, but hopefully this makes it more clear.
@CODE:>>> 1 <= 3 >= 2
True (3 >= 2) (True >= 2) >>> (1 < 3) < 2
True

>>> 1 < 3 < 2
False and a <= b <= c a (logical operator) b (logical operator) c 
    --> (a logical operator b) and (b logical operator c) __lt__ __gt__ >>> import numpy as np

>>> tst = np.asarray([1,2,3,4,5,6])

@TITLE:Unusual select / sock stream behavior behavior
@CONTENT:I'm writing a small program to request a chunk of a file, and then have another program return that specific chunk of the file. I can get this to work using files up to about 555000 bytes, but on anything lager than that, I get unusual behavior. In my loop, I check a progress buffer, which is an array of integers, to see whether or not I have a specific chunk of the file. If I do, then I don't send a request for that chunk, but if I don't, then I request the chunk from a peer. I have a linked list that I move over, where each peer in the list has a sockfd associated with that. So, in a sense, I "round robin" the requests out. Once I send them out, I wait for messages to come in. I don't know if this is the best approach, but it seemed to be the most natural. However, for files that are larger, it hangs at the select call. I'm not entirely sure why. If anyone can shed some light on this, or suggest a better approach, I'd love to hear it. Here is my code. I didn't include the code for the functions that I call, but I don't think its necessary in this instance (they are modified versions of Beej's sendall and recvall functions). It is also worth mentioning that this is in a multithread application (using pthreads), but I'm not using any shared variables.

@TITLE:Generate entities from tables in Glassfish 3.1 for Eclipse 3.7
@CONTENT:I am trying to go through this tutorial to learn more on Glassfish. I am at the stage of creating Java entities from DB tables and the tutorial instructs to " In the context menu of the EJB project (and only there) you¡¦ll find JPA Tools / Generate Entities from Tables". However, I can't find that option in the EJB project menu. I suppose the tutorial is a bit stale and based off of a previous version of GF for Eclipse. Can anybody tell what the updated functionality of this is, i.e. how to generate Java entity classes from DB so I can carry on with my tutorial? Thanks

@TITLE:ASP.NET: The breakpoint will not currently be hit. No symbols have been loaded for this document
@CONTENT:I was having this issue for several days. I finally figured out a fix for ASP.NET programmers, and I figured I would share. Problem After setting a breakpoint, and then debugging my breakpoint would turn yellow with an exclamation point. When hovering over the breakpoint it would say "The breakpoint will not currently be hit. No symbols have been loaded for this document.¡¨. I tried cleaning, rebuilding, changing various settings through my project and visual studio. Nothing worked.

@TITLE:What Python Web Framework should I use with GWT to stream KML from Python Back-end?
@CONTENT:I have a long-running process written in Python 2.7 that I would like to send KML files to my GWT application asynchronously as the KML files are generated. I have been trying to determine what Python web framework I could use as the back-end with the Python process that could possibly allow the webapp to be hosted on Google AppEngine. I was able to write a simple python webserver using Cherrypy that sent the kml using JSON from the back-end to GWT using an http request; however, I would like the files to be sent to GWT as they are generated since it may be several minutes between each one. What would be a relatively simple but effective way to achieve this? (Comet? Long-polling? Websockets?) After researching more python web frameworks, I started experimenting with Tornado because it is non-blocking and seems like it could return data as it is generated possibly using long-polling as mentioned in this answer. However, it looks like GAE requires WSGI which would not allow a Tornado webserver to be non-blocking. I have read answers to similar questions such as this one. However, I am not sure if updates in web frameworks, GWT, or GAE has changed what is the best option today, or whether some of these answers apply to my case. What Python web framework would you recommend I use to send data to my asynchronous GWT app using long-polling or another method relatively simply? Could I use this web framework with GAE, or would I need to use something else?

 Are there tools to debug whether a schema is used at all..? Also looking at the importers in /System/Library/Spotlight/ many of them do not include a schema.xml at all (nor does the default Xcode 4.x Spotlight Importer project but that could be a bug) so starting to wonder..

@TITLE:Getting WinRT concurrency exception in Windows 8 app in VS Express but not Professional
@CONTENT:I have been working on a version of my XNA tutorials using DirectX 11 and XAML and have been having a pretty good go at things in general. Today, the trial version of VS 2012 Professional expired so I threw an install of the Express Edition on to make sure everything I had done up to this point would build/run ok. Turns out it doesn't though. In the section of my code where I am loading in vertex/pixel shaders I am using concurrency Tasks. Using Visual Studio 2012 Professional, this was all working great, but when I try to run the same project using Express Edition, I get the following exception: First-chance exception at 0x76BA4B32 (KernelBase.dll) in Demo.exe: 0x40080201: WinRT originate error (parameters: 0x800700A1, 0x00000075, 0x0299DA88). Here is the offending code block: auto loadVSTask = DX::ReadDataAsync(m_vertex).then([=](const Platform::Array<byte>^ bytecode) {
    DX::ThrowIfFailed(
        device->CreateVertexShader(
            bytecode->Data,
            bytecode->Length,
            nullptr,
            &m_vertexShader
        )
    );

    DX::ThrowIfFailed(
        device->CreateInputLayout(m_layout, m_layoutElements, bytecode->Data, bytecode->Length, &m_inputLayout)
    );
});

// Function that reads from a binary file asynchronously.
inline Concurrency::task<Platform::Array<byte>^> ReadDataAsync(Platform::String^ filename)
{
    using namespace Windows::Storage;
    using namespace Concurrency;

    auto folder = Windows::ApplicationModel::Package::Current->InstalledLocation;

    return create_task(folder->GetFileAsync(filename)).then([] (StorageFile^ file) 
    {
        return FileIO::ReadBufferAsync(file);
    }).then([] (Streams::IBuffer^ fileBuffer) -> Platform::Array<byte>^ 
    {
        auto fileData = ref new Platform::Array<byte>(fileBuffer->Length);
        Streams::DataReader::FromBuffer(fileBuffer)->ReadBytes(fileData);
        return fileData;
    });
}
 Using a non Async verison of the file loading works fine and everything runs perfectly. To reiterate this only happens in Visual Studio 2012 Express and does not occur in the Professional Edition. Any ideas?
@CODE:auto loadVSTask = DX::ReadDataAsync(m_vertex).then([=](const Platform::Array<byte>^ bytecode) {

        )
    );

    DX::ThrowIfFailed(

    );
});

        Streams::DataReader::FromBuffer(fileBuffer)->ReadBytes(fileData);
        return fileData;

 Where is this FaceletViewHandler used? Here's the updated code: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/11776689/2012_09_29_primefaces_app2.zip Solution: 1) Backup the projet. 2) Re-create it in Maven as explained at http://myfaces.apache.org/build-tools/archetypes/myfaces-archetype-helloworld20/index.html by running the command mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeCatalog=http://myfaces.apache.org and selecting myfaces-archetype-helloworld20 from the list of available options. 3) Add PrimeFaces repository and dependency to pom.xml.

@CONTENT:When I enable Zombie Objects in the "Run" scheme the App works fine on the iPad, if I uncheck this option it crashes. In the search of these zombies I ran the "Profile" together with the "Zombies" template in Instruments. It doesn't crash in the Simulation mode and therefore doesn't give a message. What other ways are there to find zombies?

@TITLE:How to commit with Ruby bindings for libgit2
@CONTENT:Does anyone know how to create a commit using the ruby bindings (the 'rugged' gem) for libgit2? I've tried all the examples I can find, on the libgit2 usage guide and on the rugged gem github page, and none of the exampes for creating or editing a commit are working. This has been helpful in trying to figure out how to commit so far, except it's for libgit2 itself and not the ruby bindings. http://librelist.com/browser//libgit2/2011/2/19/initing-a-repository-adding-files-to-the-index-and-committing/#d94ce8df18ff0202ce904180286a4a85 When I try and make a commit, following the steps on the Rugged Github page, I get this; pry(main)> Rugged::Commit.create( repo, :author=>author, :message=>"Hello world\n\n", :committer=>author, :parents=>parents, :tree=>tree )
TypeError: wrong argument type nil (expected String)
 And when I try to follow the libgit2 usage guide, which basically says to get the commit and then just edit it using commit.message= like commands, but then I get noMethodErrors because there is no 'message=' method. libgit2 usage guide: http://libgit2.github.com/api.html Rugged documentation 0: http://rubydoc.info/gems/rugged/0.16.0/frames Rugged Github page: https://github.com/libgit2/rugged Edit: How I reproduce this; http://pastebin.com/wnta8FWm Edit_n+1: I also tried using the sha of the tree instead of a Rugged::Tree object, by trying x=Rugged::Commit.create( repo, :author=>author, :message=>"Hello world\n\n", :committer=>author, :parents=>parents, :tree=>tree.oid )
 But that just produced the exact same error output as before.

@TITLE:How to set Java.util.calendar to a specific time period in the future
@CONTENT:I'm using Java's calendar to set an alarm at a specific date and time. I know how to make this work when the user selects a specific date and time. For example, if the user wants to set an alarm on July 17th, 2013 at 10:45AM, I'm using the following code: //Get the calendar instance.
Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();       

//Set the time for the notification to occur.
calendar.set(Calendar.YEAR, 2013);
calendar.set(Calendar.MONTH, 6);
calendar.set(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, 17);                 
calendar.set(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY, 10);
calendar.set(Calendar.MINUTE, 45);
calendar.set(Calendar.SECOND, 0);
 All of the above code works really well when I want to set an alarm at a specific date and time. My question is, how can I set a calendar instance where the user user wants an alarm to go off 20 minutes from the current date and time? So if the current time is 6:50PM, I need the alarm to go off at 7:10PM. How can I set this programmatically? I tried to get the current date and time via the Java.util.calendar's built-in methods and tried adding 20 minutes to the Calendar.MINUTE variable. However, I don't think this will do the trick if the current time is less than 20mins away from midnight (the date will change), or 20mins away from another hour (the hour will change). How can I get around this problem? Thanks for all your help!

@TITLE:How to redirect to new page(along with model) on JQuery ajax call in MVC3
@CONTENT:I have forgot password page, where the user enters the username and clicks the 'Validate' button to check which group he is in. Based on the group we need to display the different partial views (for now let's say it is phone number) in the page. After filling the valid details, on success I will redirect to a new page where he will update his password, on Failure, I need to show the error message. Now I have a hard time in writing the code for highlighted. Here is the code for Jquery ajax function which trigger on submit button click person = {UserName: $("#UserName").val(), Phone: $("#Phone").val() }
$.ajax({
            type: 'POST',
            url: '@Url.Action("ForgotPassword", "Customer")',
            data: person,
            dataType: 'json',
            success: function (data) {
                //This is the place I need help
                if(data.IsDataValid){
                  // redirect to new page passing the model object
                }
                else{
                    //Show an error message without hiding the div
                }
            },
            failure: function () {                   
            }
        });
 Here is the code Controller Action     [HttpPost]
    [ValidateInput(true)]
    public ActionResult ForgotPassword(RegisterModel model)
    {            
        if (Request.IsAjaxRequest())
        {
            Here is the logic which validates the user

@TITLE:asp.net/MVC 3/razor/jquery/cascading dropdown list not working
@CONTENT:I'm new to stackoverflow as well as to jquery/javascript. I've been searching all day for different ways to add cascading drop down lists to my current project and have yet to find a way that has worked for me. Most of my finding have been from out of date and based upon MVC 2 to webforms to older technologies. I did find a few tutorials and posts based upon MVC 3/4 that have helped but I'm still about to chunk my mouse at my computer screen. Some links that I've looked at for help are: Radu Enuca's Tutorial on cascading dropdown lists and Rick_Anderson's Tutorial Some background on the project: I'm creating a work ticket system for employees to submit their daily time to the office. I have a controller, view, and jquery script listed below. Controller public class WorkTicketController : Controller
{
    private Context db = new Context();

    public ActionResult GetClientReps(int id)
    {
        var Reps = from c in db.ClientReps
                   where c.ClientID == id
                   select c;

        List<SelectListItem> clientReps = new List<SelectListItem>();

        foreach (var item in Reps)
        {
            string clientRepId = item.ClientRepID.ToString();

            string clientRepName = item.FirstName + " " + item.LastName;

            clientReps.Add(new SelectListItem(){ Value = clientRepId, Text = clientRepName });
        }

        var List = new SelectList(clientReps, "Value", "Text");

        return Json(List, JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet);

 When I choose a Client from the Client drop down list, nothing happens for the Client Rep drop down list. I know it must be something obvious that I'm missing but at this point I don't mind looking like an idiot to solve this frustrating problem. I have verified that that other jquery works in my project so I don't have anything disabled as far as I can tell. Thank you in advance for the help! T Update So I have made one step forward it appears. I started moving my script placement around on the view. I tried the top and the bottom of the page. I also reviewed the layout page to make sure I was link to the right jquery libraries. That all checked out but it got me thinking so I moved my script into it's own custom.js file and linked to it on the layout page and the cascading drop down lists started working. My next question is why? and should I leave it the way it is now? Thanks! T

@CONTENT:Suppose I have two tables: TABLE1: Has a list of IDs I need to process. TABLE2: Has key-value pairs of ID's and values. I need to retrieve the values from TABLE2 for all the IDs in TABLE1, as a single string. In order to achieve this, I made the next query: DECLARE @id INT, @value VARCHAR(10);

SELECT @id=0, @value='';

SELECT
    @value = @value + (SELECT TOP 1 value FROM TABLE2 WHERE id=@id) + '-',
    @id = @id+1
FROM TABLE1
 But when I run this query, the subquery always returns null (and, therefore, @value=NULL at the end). My question is: Why does the subquery SELECT TOP 1 value FROM TABLE2 WHERE id=@id always returns NULL, even if the ID is found in TABLE2?
@CODE:DECLARE @id INT, @value VARCHAR(10);

@TITLE:Performance Issues when accessing HttpRequestMessage Properties collection in WebAPI
@CONTENT:Using ASP.NET MVC4 I have created a DelegatingHandler in a WebAPI project. I use the Handler to insert some data into the HttpRequestMessage Properties collection so that later portions of the Http pipeline (e.g. other handlers, controllers) can access that data. Example: var httpRequest = (HttpRequestMessageProperty) request.Properties["httpRequest"];
httpRequest.Headers["MY_DATA"] = "some data";
 I wanted to test the impact of this on the throughput of WebAPI request processing so I created a console app that, within an Action delegate, instantiates an HttpClient, sends a request, and waits for the response before sending the next one. I count the number of successful executions of this Action delegate within a 5 second window using the performance measurement strategy described here: http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/61964/Performance-Tests-Precise-Run-Time-Measurements-wi What I have observed is that there is over a magnitude loss in performance in executing the single line that retrieves the httpRequest from the Properties collection. Without this line of code I see >700 completions within 5 seconds. When I add that line in, it drops to <20 completions within 5 seconds. Has anyone else experienced this? Is there a different method I should use to cache data for the length of a single request that will be available throughout the Http pipeline?

httpRequest.Headers["MY_DATA"] = "some data";

@TITLE:Exclude directories that contain sub directories?
@CONTENT:I have the following code: var directories =  Directory.GetDirectories(
        environmentSettings.SourcePath, 
        "*",
        SearchOption.AllDirectories)
    .Where(dir => !environmentSettings.FolderExclusions
                                      .Contains(Path.GetFileName(dir)));
 I want to create a directory in the target path except for ones that show up in the exclusion list. This works, but only if the directory is directly under the root and does not contain sub-directories. As an example, if the exclusion list contains a directory called Custom and the root directory is C:\App, it will exclude C:\App\Custom and not create it in the target path, but as soon as it encounters something like C:\App\Custom\Sub, it will end up creating this on the target path. Can't get it to work for File: //Copy all the files var files = Directory.GetFiles(environmentSettings.SourcePath, "*", SearchOption.AllDirectories)
      .Select(file => new FileInfo(file))
      .Where(file => !environmentSettings.FolderExclusions
                                         .Contains(file.Name) && 
                     !environmentSettings.FolderExclusions
                                         .Contains(file.Directory.Name));
 The problem above, is that I don't know how to tell how nested the file is, for example, if it is under c:\App\Custom\thumbs.db, it works fine, I think, but if it is under c:\App\Custom\sub1\sub2\thumbs.db, it still copies the file and the Custom directory which is what I don't want. I basically need to get the directory right below c:\App and if that is Custom, then I exclude the file. var files = Directory.GetFiles(environmentSettings.SourcePath, "*", SearchOption.AllDirectories)
            .Select(file => new FileInfo(file))
            .Where(file => !environmentSettings.FolderExclusions.Contains(file.Directory.Name) && (file.Directory.Parent == null || !environmentSettings.FolderExclusions.Contains(file.Directory.Parent.Name)));
 When I run the following code to loop through all my files and put them in a target directory, I run into a Directory not found exception: //Copy all the files
foreach (var file in files)
{
File.Copy(file.Name, file.FullName.Replace(environmentSettings.SourcePath, environmentSettings.TargetPath));
}
 The problem is that the source file maybe something like \network\app1\one.mp3 and my target directory might be c:\programdata\myapp. It is saying it can't find one.mp3 when copying the files from the source. Not sure how to handle this.
@CODE:var directories =  Directory.GetDirectories(

@TITLE:Custom UIView covering UITabBar on iPhone but not iPad
@CONTENT:I'm creating a custom uiView that covers the window. It acts kinda like a decoy uiview in a navigation controller. So I had to do it this way to cover the navigation bar.... long story... Here is how it gets setup. self.searchPopDown.frame = CGRectMake(0, 20, self.navigationController.view.frame.size.width, self.navigationController.view.frame.size.height-20);

    self.searchPopDown.autoresizingMask = UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleWidth | UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleHeight;
 The 20 is to compensate for the status bar. Then I simply add the view as a subview to the app window. //this will add the view ontop of a modalViewController and support rotation!
UIWindow* window = [UIApplication sharedApplication].keyWindow;
if (!window) {
    window = [[UIApplication sharedApplication].windows objectAtIndex:0];
}

if ([[[window subviews] objectAtIndex:0] isKindOfClass:[SVProgressHUD class]]){
    //There is a chance that the window will be the SVProgressHUD in this case we need to get the main window.

    window = [[UIApplication sharedApplication].windows objectAtIndex:0];
}
    [[[window subviews] objectAtIndex:0] addSubview:self.searchPopDown];
 All of this works great and dandy. However I've noticed something strange. On the iPhone this view will end up being resized to cover the UITabBar at the bottom of my app. But on an iPad it gets resized correctly to compensate for the UITabBar. Any ideas why? Thanks ================= Here are some screenshots describing the issue. This is what it looks like when the view loads with the fake view onto of everything. The view shows up (as far as the user is concerned just the view and the buttons on the navbar have changed slightly. When you have searched this fake view disappears revealing the real view below with the search results. ON the ipad the fake view doesn't cover the tab bar. Why doesn't it do this on the iphone also? ========== edit 2 Another weird thing. I'm generating log messages to get what the height of the navigation controller is. It changing by 49 depending on if I display normally or present as a modal view and there is no tab bar. So the log says 431 should be the correct height. I go into interface builder and setup a simple pink view that's measured at 431 and it looks great :) However when I manually set the size to 431 it doesn't work. I have to set the size to 298 to get this to work correctly ... weird... See the pink bar? It is literally 431 tall... and the log says that's what my view is.. but it's not :/ ============ edit:3 I have traced this to the imagebackground with the bubble logo resizing incorrectly...
@CODE:self.searchPopDown.frame = CGRectMake(0, 20, self.navigationController.view.frame.size.width, self.navigationController.view.frame.size.height-20);

    self.searchPopDown.autoresizingMask = UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleWidth | UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleHeight; //this will add the view ontop of a modalViewController and support rotation!

Basicly I want something like this: http://www.transfercar.co.nz/ - if you click on the table row more data appears below (in new row). My code looks like this: while ($row = mysqli_fetch_array($r, MYSQLI_ASSOC)) {
$display1=$display1+1;
    echo '
    <tr class="tablerow">
        <td>' . $row['id'] . '</td>

        <td>' . $row['city'] . '</td>
        <td>' . $row['category'] . '</td>

$(".tablerow").click(function()
{
  $(".subtable").show();
}); 

$(".subtable").click(function()
{
  $(".subtable").hide();
}); 
 Point is that once clicked all subtables show, naturally I only want the one below the clicked table row..

@TITLE:Javascript - Regular expressions, what to do now that its all true
@CONTENT:Hello I am working on a javascript that is supposed to test the password field. Now I was able to get the the password field to work out and display a alert if none of the requirements are not being met. However the next problem lies in what to do now that the requirements are true. I wrote a true statement to check to see if it it would click the button on the form to enter in the password but so far I can't seem to get it click the button. Any advice would be very welcomed and appreciated. Here is the code I have as of right now. var str= passwordFieldForm; 
var patt=/[a-z]/g; 
var patt2 = /[A-Z]/g;  
var patt3 = /[0-9]/g;

var result=patt.test(str); 
var result2=patt2.test(str); 
var result3=patt3.test(str); 
var result4=patt4.test(str);

@TITLE:What is The Correct View Matrix For The HUD Camera?
@CONTENT:I'm using OpenSceneGraph in Android with GLES2. I have two cameras: one for the scene and the other for the HUD. The scene camera is the main camera in my osgViewer. My trouble is with the HUD's camera. I am trying to add an OSG geometry to the 2D scene (HUD camera) but can't seem to get it to show up. I'm using custom shaders to manipulate the geometry's position. To my understanding the projection matrix is correct but I think the problem may be with the view matrix since I'm using two cameras. I've tried setting the HUD's view to be the scene's initial view but to no avail. Please correct me if I am wrong in this.    // New camera for the HUD
   hud_camera = new osg::Camera;

   // Set the camera's view properties
   hud_camera->setProjectionMatrix(
      osg::Matrix::ortho2D(0, 1280, 0, 696));
   hud_camera->setReferenceFrame(osg::Transform::ABSOLUTE_RF);
   hud_camera->setViewMatrix(osg::Matrix::identity());
   hud_camera->setViewport(0, 0, 1280, 696);

   // Clear the depth buffer
   hud_camera->setClearMask(GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);

   // Draw the subgraph after the main camera view and don't allow this camera
   // to grab evente focurs from the main camera
   hud_camera->setRenderOrder(osg::Camera::POST_RENDER);
   hud_camera->setAllowEventFocus(false);


   osg::Geode *       geode;
   osg::Geometry *    geom;
   osg::Vec3Array *   vertices;
   osg::Program *     program;

   // Create the geode and geometry to hold the crosshair image
   geode = new osg::Geode;
   geom = new osg::Geometry;
   geode->addDrawable(geom);
   hud_camera->addChild(geode);

   // Set the vertices
   vertices = new osg::Vec3Array;
   vertices->push_back(osg::Vec3(0.0, 0.0, 0.0));
   vertices->push_back(osg::Vec3(1.0, 0.0, 0.0));
   vertices->push_back(osg::Vec3(1.0, 0.0, 1.0));
   vertices->push_back(osg::Vec3(0.0, 0.0, 1.0));
   geom->setVertexArray(vertices);

   // set colors
   osg::Vec4Array* colors = new osg::Vec4Array;
   colors->push_back(osg::Vec4(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0));
   colors->push_back(osg::Vec4(0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0));
   colors->push_back(osg::Vec4(0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0));
   colors->push_back(osg::Vec4(1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0));
   geom->setVertexAttribArray(7, colors);
   geom->setVertexAttribBinding(7, osg::Geometry::BIND_PER_VERTEX);

   // Set primitive set
   geom->addPrimitiveSet(new osg::DrawArrays(GL_QUADS, 0, 4));
   geom->setUseVertexBufferObjects(true);

   // Vertex Shader
   char vertSource[] =
   "attribute vec4 osg_Vertex;\n"
   "attribute vec4 a_col;"
   "uniform mat4 osg_ModelViewProjectionMatrix;\n"

   "varying vec4 v_col;"
   "void main(void)\n"
   "{\n"
   "gl_Position = view_matrix * proj_matrix * osg_Vertex;\n"
   "v_col = a_col;\n"
   "}\n";

   // Fragment shader
   char fragSource[] =
   "precision mediump float;\n"
   "varying vec4 v_col;"
   "void main(void)\n"
   "{\n"
   "gl_FragColor = v_col;\n"
   "}\n";

   // Set the shaders
   program = new osg::Program;
   program->setName("Crosshair Shader");
   program->addShader(new osg::Shader(osg::Shader::VERTEX, vertSource));
   program->addShader(new osg::Shader(osg::Shader::FRAGMENT, fragSource));
   program->addBindAttribLocation("a_col", 7);

   osg::StateSet* state = geode->getOrCreateStateSet();
   state->addUniform(
      new osg::Uniform("proj_matrix", hud_camera->getProjectionMatrix()));
   state->addUniform(
      new osg::Uniform("view_matrix", hud_camera->getViewMatrix());

   // Add the program shaders
   geode->getOrCreateStateSet()->setAttributeAndModes(
      program, osg::StateAttribute::ON );

   // Needs no lighting or any depth for a 2D image
   geode->getOrCreateStateSet()->setMode(GL_LIGHTING, osg::StateAttribute::OFF);
   state->setMode(GL_DEPTH_TEST, osg::StateAttribute::OFF);
 Afterwards I attach the hud_camera as a child to the scene data. Also the scene camera is doing nothing special other than looking at a particular point in the scene. I do know for a fact that the geometry is being created. By using this in the vertex shader: gl_Position = osg_ModelViewProjectionMatrx * osg_Vertex I can see it off to the left in the scene.

This is hurting the server a lot when I'm trying on X thousand clients, eventually creating a timeout. I was wondering if there is a way to apply a tag to an ActiveRecord collection or something. If this is documented I'm deeply sorry, but I can't find somebody doing it anywhere. I can see how to hack it by doing a custom SQL query all by myself, but I prefer to avoid hacking the gem like this, ofc. Right now I'm doing something like this Something like this # Client.selection returns a clients collection
Client.selection.each do |client|
  tags_to_add.each{|a| client.tag_list << a}
  tags_to_remove.each{|a| client.tag_list.remove(a)}
  client.save
end
 Thanks a lot for your time. Extra: well, I need to be able to remove 1..n tag(s) to a collection too!
@CODE:# Client.selection returns a clients collection
Client.selection.each do |client|
  tags_to_add.each{|a| client.tag_list << a}

  client.save
end INSERT INTO foo (field1, field2) VALUES (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)

@TITLE:Auto-advance in form fields
@CONTENT:I have a simple script that auto-advances the cursor to the next field in my html form after one character is entered...and it works great for that. This is the simple code: function autotab(current,to)
{
if (current.getAttribute && current.value.length==current.getAttribute("maxlength")) 
{   
        to.focus()

 Then of course I use the onkeyup to advance it, like this: <input onkeyup="autotab(this, document.jumble.w1b)" type="text">
 Again, that works great. However, when I do Shift+Tab to go one box back, it auto-advances before I can type anything. Does anyone have a code example of how to make Shift+Tab work? I have tried different variations of trying to use the keycodes to detect shift and tab, but it doesn't seem to work. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

If there are 4 or more numbers to the left of decimal I want everything right of the decimal to be dropped (including the decimal itself). It seems like something that should be a pretty standard practice. But I'm not having much luck finding an answer that works.

@TITLE:How to set a default preferred size (redefining UI) in a *ComponentUI class (Swing app)?
@CONTENT:I extended the system look and feel to draw custom JButton. UIManager.setLookAndFeel(UIManager.getSystemLookAndFeelClassName());
UIManager.put("ButtonUI", "com.my.package.MyButtonUI");
 With com.my.package.MyButtonUI: public class MyButtonUI extends BasicButtonUI {

    public static final int BTN_HEIGHT = 24;
    private static final MyButtonUI INSTANCE = new MyButtonUI ();

    public static ComponentUI createUI(JComponent b) {
        return INSTANCE;
    }

    @Override
    public void paint(Graphics g, JComponent c) {
        AbstractButton b = (AbstractButton) c;
        Graphics2D g2d = (Graphics2D) g;
        GradientPaint gp;
        if (b.isEnabled()) {
            gp = new GradientPaint(0, 0, Color.red, 0, BTN_HEIGHT * 0.6f, Color.gray, true);
        } else {
            gp = new GradientPaint(0, 0, Color.black, 0, BTN_HEIGHT * 0.6f, Color.blue, true);
        }
        g2d.setPaint(gp);
        g2d.fillRect(0, 0, b.getWidth(), BTN_HEIGHT);
        super.paint(g, b);
    }

    @Override
    public void update(Graphics g, JComponent c) {
        AbstractButton b = (AbstractButton) c;
        b.setForeground(Color.white);
        paint(g, b);
    }
}
 Now I would like to add that constraint on these buttons: I want the buttons to have size of 70x24 except if a setPreferredSize() has been called in the client code. How can I do that? Note: If I put a setPreferredSize() in the MyButtonUI.update() method, it overrides the client setPreferredSize(), then all my buttons get the same size. Thank you. EDIT: Thanks to Guillaume, I overrided getPreferredSize() (in MyButtonUI) like this: @Override
public Dimension getPreferredSize(JComponent c) {
    AbstractButton button = (AbstractButton) c;
    int width = Math.max(button.getWidth(), BUTTON_WIDTH);
    int height = Math.max(button.getHeight(), BUTTON_HEIGHT);
    return new Dimension(width, height);
}
 and it works fine.
@CODE:JButton UIManager.setLookAndFeel(UIManager.getSystemLookAndFeelClassName());
UIManager.put("ButtonUI", "com.my.package.MyButtonUI"); com.my.package.MyButtonUI public class MyButtonUI extends BasicButtonUI {

    public static final int BTN_HEIGHT = 24;

        GradientPaint gp;
        if (b.isEnabled()) {
            gp = new GradientPaint(0, 0, Color.red, 0, BTN_HEIGHT * 0.6f, Color.gray, true);
        } else {
            gp = new GradientPaint(0, 0, Color.black, 0, BTN_HEIGHT * 0.6f, Color.blue, true);
        }
        g2d.setPaint(gp);
        g2d.fillRect(0, 0, b.getWidth(), BTN_HEIGHT);

    }

@LINK:/questions/12642243/django-modelforms-display-manytomany-field-as-single-select
@TITLE:Django ModelForms: Display ManyToMany field as single-select
@CONTENT:In a Django app, I'm having a model Bet which contains a ManyToMany relation with the User model of Django: class Bet(models.Model):
    ...
    participants = models.ManyToManyField(User)
 User should be able to start new bets using a form. Until now, bets have exactly two participants, one of which is the user who creates the bet himself. That means in the form for the new bet you have to chose exactly one participant. The bet creator is added as participant upon saving of the form data. I'm using a ModelForm for my NewBetForm: class NewBetForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Bet
        widgets = {
            'participants': forms.Select()
        }

    def save(self, user):
        ... # save user as participant
 Notice the redefined widget for the participants field which makes sure you can only choose one participant. However, this gives me a validation error: Enter a list of values.
 I'm not really sure where this comes from. If I look at the POST data in the developer tools, it seems to be exactly the same as if I use the default widget and choose only one participant. However, it seems like the to_python() method of the ManyToManyField has its problems with this data. At least there is no User object created if I enable the Select widget. I know I could work around this problem by excluding the participants field from the form and define it myself but it would be a lot nicer if the ModelForm's capacities could still be used (after all, it's only a widget change). Maybe I could manipulate the passed data in some way if I knew how. Can anyone tell me what the problem is exactly and if there is a good way to solve it? Thanks in advance! Edit As suggested in the comments: the (relevant) code of the view. def new_bet(request):

@TITLE:Applescript to run Detect Displays
@CONTENT:When I plug an external monitor into my Macbook and wake it, the display is often the wrong resolution. Prior to Mountain Lion, I was able to run the following applescript to detect displays: tell application "System Preferences" to activate
tell application "System Events"
    tell process "System Preferences"
        click menu item "Displays" of menu "View" of menu bar 1
        tell button "Detect Displays" of window 1 to click
    end tell
end tell
tell application "System Preferences" to quit
 But, with 10.8, the "Detect Displays" button requires that you press the Option key to display it, and so the script gives the following error: error "System Events got an error: Can¡¦t get button \"Detect Displays\" of window 1 of process \"System Preferences\"." number -1728 from button "Detect Displays" of window 1 of process "System Preferences" My applescript skills are less than rudimentary and my google-fu has not enabled me to stumble across an answer. How can I modify the script to click the now hidden detect displays button?
@CODE:tell application "System Preferences" to activate
tell application "System Events"
    tell process "System Preferences"
        click menu item "Displays" of menu "View" of menu bar 1
        tell button "Detect Displays" of window 1 to click
    end tell
end tell
tell application "System Preferences" to quit

 rlt is the id of RelativeLayout rlt. Now the flinging in the onFling() does not work with the attribute android:autoLink="email" in the text view with id description. But when I remove that attribute, the fling works. I have no idea why this is happening. How can that attribute affect the fling gesture? EDIT The onTouch() of the GestureListener itself is not called. The logs are never recorded in the logcat. When the attribute android:autoLink="email" is present.

 If I logged out from my preinstalled Facebook app, my application prompts me to login, asking the credentials. That time also, the empty screen appears.But in the preinstalled Facebook app, I can see my updates.( I get Logged in). Update: Right now I'm checking the app only. I have not published it to market. I got the key by referring this site http://sean.lyn.ch/2011/07/android-the-facebook-sdk-sso-and-you/. And I added it to the app, like this. Update 2: Now I got these lines in logcat: 09-29 12:00:12.552: I/ActivityManager(73): Starting activity: Intent { cmp=com.facebook.katana/.ProxyAuth (has extras) }

@TITLE:Performance Issues when accessing HttpRequestMessage Properties collection in WebAPI
@CONTENT:Using ASP.NET MVC4 I have created a DelegatingHandler in a WebAPI project. I use the Handler to insert some data into the HttpRequestMessage Properties collection so that later portions of the Http pipeline (e.g. other handlers, controllers) can access that data. Example: var httpRequest = (HttpRequestMessageProperty) request.Properties["httpRequest"];
httpRequest.Headers["MY_DATA"] = "some data";
 I wanted to test the impact of this on the throughput of WebAPI request processing so I created a console app that, within an Action delegate, instantiates an HttpClient, sends a request, and waits for the response before sending the next one. I count the number of successful executions of this Action delegate within a 5 second window using the performance measurement strategy described here: http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/61964/Performance-Tests-Precise-Run-Time-Measurements-wi What I have observed is that there is over a magnitude loss in performance in executing the single line that retrieves the httpRequest from the Properties collection. Without this line of code I see >700 completions within 5 seconds. When I add that line in, it drops to <20 completions within 5 seconds. Has anyone else experienced this? Is there a different method I should use to cache data for the length of a single request that will be available throughout the Http pipeline?

@TITLE:Exclude directories that contain sub directories?
@CONTENT:I have the following code: var directories =  Directory.GetDirectories(
        environmentSettings.SourcePath, 
        "*",
        SearchOption.AllDirectories)
    .Where(dir => !environmentSettings.FolderExclusions
                                      .Contains(Path.GetFileName(dir)));
 I want to create a directory in the target path except for ones that show up in the exclusion list. This works, but only if the directory is directly under the root and does not contain sub-directories. As an example, if the exclusion list contains a directory called Custom and the root directory is C:\App, it will exclude C:\App\Custom and not create it in the target path, but as soon as it encounters something like C:\App\Custom\Sub, it will end up creating this on the target path. Can't get it to work for File: //Copy all the files var files = Directory.GetFiles(environmentSettings.SourcePath, "*", SearchOption.AllDirectories)
      .Select(file => new FileInfo(file))
      .Where(file => !environmentSettings.FolderExclusions
                                         .Contains(file.Name) &&

                                         .Contains(file.Directory.Name));
 The problem above, is that I don't know how to tell how nested the file is, for example, if it is under c:\App\Custom\thumbs.db, it works fine, I think, but if it is under c:\App\Custom\sub1\sub2\thumbs.db, it still copies the file and the Custom directory which is what I don't want. I basically need to get the directory right below c:\App and if that is Custom, then I exclude the file. var files = Directory.GetFiles(environmentSettings.SourcePath, "*", SearchOption.AllDirectories)
            .Select(file => new FileInfo(file))
            .Where(file => !environmentSettings.FolderExclusions.Contains(file.Directory.Name) && (file.Directory.Parent == null || !environmentSettings.FolderExclusions.Contains(file.Directory.Parent.Name)));
 When I run the following code to loop through all my files and put them in a target directory, I run into a Directory not found exception: //Copy all the files
foreach (var file in files)
{
File.Copy(file.Name, file.FullName.Replace(environmentSettings.SourcePath, environmentSettings.TargetPath));
}
 The problem is that the source file maybe something like \network\app1\one.mp3 and my target directory might be c:\programdata\myapp. It is saying it can't find one.mp3 when copying the files from the source. Not sure how to handle this.

@TITLE:Custom UIView covering UITabBar on iPhone but not iPad
@CONTENT:I'm creating a custom uiView that covers the window. It acts kinda like a decoy uiview in a navigation controller. So I had to do it this way to cover the navigation bar.... long story... Here is how it gets setup. self.searchPopDown.frame = CGRectMake(0, 20, self.navigationController.view.frame.size.width, self.navigationController.view.frame.size.height-20);

    self.searchPopDown.autoresizingMask = UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleWidth | UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleHeight;
 The 20 is to compensate for the status bar. Then I simply add the view as a subview to the app window. //this will add the view ontop of a modalViewController and support rotation!
UIWindow* window = [UIApplication sharedApplication].keyWindow;
if (!window) {
    window = [[UIApplication sharedApplication].windows objectAtIndex:0];
}

if ([[[window subviews] objectAtIndex:0] isKindOfClass:[SVProgressHUD class]]){
    //There is a chance that the window will be the SVProgressHUD in this case we need to get the main window.

    window = [[UIApplication sharedApplication].windows objectAtIndex:0];
}
    [[[window subviews] objectAtIndex:0] addSubview:self.searchPopDown];
 All of this works great and dandy. However I've noticed something strange. On the iPhone this view will end up being resized to cover the UITabBar at the bottom of my app. But on an iPad it gets resized correctly to compensate for the UITabBar. Any ideas why? Thanks ================= Here are some screenshots describing the issue. This is what it looks like when the view loads with the fake view onto of everything. The view shows up (as far as the user is concerned just the view and the buttons on the navbar have changed slightly. When you have searched this fake view disappears revealing the real view below with the search results. ON the ipad the fake view doesn't cover the tab bar. Why doesn't it do this on the iphone also? ========== edit 2 Another weird thing. I'm generating log messages to get what the height of the navigation controller is. It changing by 49 depending on if I display normally or present as a modal view and there is no tab bar. So the log says 431 should be the correct height. I go into interface builder and setup a simple pink view that's measured at 431 and it looks great :) However when I manually set the size to 431 it doesn't work. I have to set the size to 298 to get this to work correctly ... weird... See the pink bar? It is literally 431 tall... and the log says that's what my view is.. but it's not :/ ============ edit:3 I have traced this to the imagebackground with the bubble logo resizing incorrectly...
@CODE:self.searchPopDown.frame = CGRectMake(0, 20, self.navigationController.view.frame.size.width, self.navigationController.view.frame.size.height-20);

    self.searchPopDown.autoresizingMask = UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleWidth | UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleHeight; //this will add the view ontop of a modalViewController and support rotation!

@CONTENT:So I have a table generated from database with while loop. Data is displayed in rows. Point is that there are "hidden" rows with data available only on click (like show details). Basicly I want something like this: http://www.transfercar.co.nz/ - if you click on the table row more data appears below (in new row). My code looks like this: while ($row = mysqli_fetch_array($r, MYSQLI_ASSOC)) {
$display1=$display1+1;
    echo '
    <tr class="tablerow">
        <td>' . $row['id'] . '</td>

        <td><p class="state">' . $row['surname'] . '</p></td>
        <td>' . $row['country'] . '</td>
        <td>' . $row['city'] . '</td>
        <td>' . $row['category'] . '</td>
    </tr>';
if($row['id']==$_GET['showrow'])
{

        <td align="left" colspan="3" class="detalji"></td>
        </tr>';}} // End of WHILE loop.
echo '</table>';
 My jQuery looks like this: /* Table row click */
$(".tablerow").click(function()
{
  $(".subtable").show();
}); 

$(".subtable").click(function()
{
  $(".subtable").hide();
}); 
 Point is that once clicked all subtables show, naturally I only want the one below the clicked table row..

@TITLE:Javascript - Regular expressions, what to do now that its all true
@CONTENT:Hello I am working on a javascript that is supposed to test the password field. Now I was able to get the the password field to work out and display a alert if none of the requirements are not being met. However the next problem lies in what to do now that the requirements are true. I wrote a true statement to check to see if it it would click the button on the form to enter in the password but so far I can't seem to get it click the button. Any advice would be very welcomed and appreciated. Here is the code I have as of right now. var str= passwordFieldForm;

var result=patt.test(str); 
var result2=patt2.test(str); 
var result3=patt3.test(str);

@TITLE:What is The Correct View Matrix For The HUD Camera?
@CONTENT:I'm using OpenSceneGraph in Android with GLES2. I have two cameras: one for the scene and the other for the HUD. The scene camera is the main camera in my osgViewer. My trouble is with the HUD's camera. I am trying to add an OSG geometry to the 2D scene (HUD camera) but can't seem to get it to show up. I'm using custom shaders to manipulate the geometry's position. To my understanding the projection matrix is correct but I think the problem may be with the view matrix since I'm using two cameras. I've tried setting the HUD's view to be the scene's initial view but to no avail. Please correct me if I am wrong in this.    // New camera for the HUD
   hud_camera = new osg::Camera;

   // Set the camera's view properties
   hud_camera->setProjectionMatrix(
      osg::Matrix::ortho2D(0, 1280, 0, 696));
   hud_camera->setReferenceFrame(osg::Transform::ABSOLUTE_RF);
   hud_camera->setViewMatrix(osg::Matrix::identity());
   hud_camera->setViewport(0, 0, 1280, 696);

   // Clear the depth buffer
   hud_camera->setClearMask(GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);

   // Draw the subgraph after the main camera view and don't allow this camera
   // to grab evente focurs from the main camera
   hud_camera->setRenderOrder(osg::Camera::POST_RENDER);
   hud_camera->setAllowEventFocus(false);


   osg::Geode *       geode;
   osg::Geometry *    geom;
   osg::Vec3Array *   vertices;
   osg::Program *     program;

   // Create the geode and geometry to hold the crosshair image
   geode = new osg::Geode;
   geom = new osg::Geometry;
   geode->addDrawable(geom);
   hud_camera->addChild(geode);

   // Set the vertices
   vertices = new osg::Vec3Array;
   vertices->push_back(osg::Vec3(0.0, 0.0, 0.0));
   vertices->push_back(osg::Vec3(1.0, 0.0, 0.0));
   vertices->push_back(osg::Vec3(1.0, 0.0, 1.0));
   vertices->push_back(osg::Vec3(0.0, 0.0, 1.0));
   geom->setVertexArray(vertices);

   // set colors
   osg::Vec4Array* colors = new osg::Vec4Array;
   colors->push_back(osg::Vec4(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0));
   colors->push_back(osg::Vec4(0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0));
   colors->push_back(osg::Vec4(0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0));
   colors->push_back(osg::Vec4(1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0));
   geom->setVertexAttribArray(7, colors);
   geom->setVertexAttribBinding(7, osg::Geometry::BIND_PER_VERTEX);

   // Set primitive set
   geom->addPrimitiveSet(new osg::DrawArrays(GL_QUADS, 0, 4));
   geom->setUseVertexBufferObjects(true);

   // Vertex Shader
   char vertSource[] =
   "attribute vec4 osg_Vertex;\n"
   "attribute vec4 a_col;"
   "uniform mat4 osg_ModelViewProjectionMatrix;\n"

   "varying vec4 v_col;"

   "{\n"
   "gl_Position = view_matrix * proj_matrix * osg_Vertex;\n"
   "v_col = a_col;\n"
   "}\n";

   // Fragment shader
   char fragSource[] =
   "precision mediump float;\n"
   "varying vec4 v_col;"
   "void main(void)\n"
   "{\n"
   "gl_FragColor = v_col;\n"
   "}\n";

   // Set the shaders
   program = new osg::Program;
   program->setName("Crosshair Shader");
   program->addShader(new osg::Shader(osg::Shader::VERTEX, vertSource));
   program->addShader(new osg::Shader(osg::Shader::FRAGMENT, fragSource));
   program->addBindAttribLocation("a_col", 7);

   osg::StateSet* state = geode->getOrCreateStateSet();
   state->addUniform(
      new osg::Uniform("proj_matrix", hud_camera->getProjectionMatrix()));
   state->addUniform(
      new osg::Uniform("view_matrix", hud_camera->getViewMatrix());

   // Add the program shaders
   geode->getOrCreateStateSet()->setAttributeAndModes(
      program, osg::StateAttribute::ON );

   // Needs no lighting or any depth for a 2D image
   geode->getOrCreateStateSet()->setMode(GL_LIGHTING, osg::StateAttribute::OFF);
   state->setMode(GL_DEPTH_TEST, osg::StateAttribute::OFF);
 Afterwards I attach the hud_camera as a child to the scene data. Also the scene camera is doing nothing special other than looking at a particular point in the scene. I do know for a fact that the geometry is being created. By using this in the vertex shader: gl_Position = osg_ModelViewProjectionMatrx * osg_Vertex I can see it off to the left in the scene.

@CONTENT:I'm using the acts_as_taggable_on gem on a Rails (Ruby 1.9.3) project. I provide a form to my admins to add 1..n tag(s) to list of resources (let's say clients). I didin't find a way to do this in bulk. Right now I'm looping on every client and add one tag then save the object. This is hurting the server a lot when I'm trying on X thousand clients, eventually creating a timeout. I was wondering if there is a way to apply a tag to an ActiveRecord collection or something. If this is documented I'm deeply sorry, but I can't find somebody doing it anywhere. I can see how to hack it by doing a custom SQL query all by myself, but I prefer to avoid hacking the gem like this, ofc. Right now I'm doing something like this Something like this # Client.selection returns a clients collection
Client.selection.each do |client|
  tags_to_add.each{|a| client.tag_list << a}
  tags_to_remove.each{|a| client.tag_list.remove(a)}
  client.save
end
 Thanks a lot for your time. Extra: well, I need to be able to remove 1..n tag(s) to a collection too!
@CODE:# Client.selection returns a clients collection
Client.selection.each do |client|
  tags_to_add.each{|a| client.tag_list << a}

  client.save
end INSERT INTO foo (field1, field2) VALUES (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)

@TITLE:Auto-advance in form fields
@CONTENT:I have a simple script that auto-advances the cursor to the next field in my html form after one character is entered...and it works great for that. This is the simple code: function autotab(current,to)
{
if (current.getAttribute && current.value.length==current.getAttribute("maxlength")) 
{   
        to.focus()          
    }

 Then of course I use the onkeyup to advance it, like this: <input onkeyup="autotab(this, document.jumble.w1b)" type="text">
 Again, that works great. However, when I do Shift+Tab to go one box back, it auto-advances before I can type anything. Does anyone have a code example of how to make Shift+Tab work? I have tried different variations of trying to use the keycodes to detect shift and tab, but it doesn't seem to work. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

If there are 4 or more numbers to the left of decimal I want everything right of the decimal to be dropped (including the decimal itself). It seems like something that should be a pretty standard practice. But I'm not having much luck finding an answer that works. A couple of corrections were made to the display string above, I do want rounding. Thanks!

@TITLE:How to set a default preferred size (redefining UI) in a *ComponentUI class (Swing app)?
@CONTENT:I extended the system look and feel to draw custom JButton. UIManager.setLookAndFeel(UIManager.getSystemLookAndFeelClassName());
UIManager.put("ButtonUI", "com.my.package.MyButtonUI");
 With com.my.package.MyButtonUI: public class MyButtonUI extends BasicButtonUI {

    public static final int BTN_HEIGHT = 24;
    private static final MyButtonUI INSTANCE = new MyButtonUI ();

    public static ComponentUI createUI(JComponent b) {
        return INSTANCE;
    }

    @Override
    public void paint(Graphics g, JComponent c) {
        AbstractButton b = (AbstractButton) c;
        Graphics2D g2d = (Graphics2D) g;
        GradientPaint gp;
        if (b.isEnabled()) {
            gp = new GradientPaint(0, 0, Color.red, 0, BTN_HEIGHT * 0.6f, Color.gray, true);
        } else {
            gp = new GradientPaint(0, 0, Color.black, 0, BTN_HEIGHT * 0.6f, Color.blue, true);
        }
        g2d.setPaint(gp);
        g2d.fillRect(0, 0, b.getWidth(), BTN_HEIGHT);
        super.paint(g, b);
    }

    @Override
    public void update(Graphics g, JComponent c) {
        AbstractButton b = (AbstractButton) c;
        b.setForeground(Color.white);
        paint(g, b);
    }
}
 Now I would like to add that constraint on these buttons: I want the buttons to have size of 70x24 except if a setPreferredSize() has been called in the client code. How can I do that? Note: If I put a setPreferredSize() in the MyButtonUI.update() method, it overrides the client setPreferredSize(), then all my buttons get the same size. Thank you. EDIT: Thanks to Guillaume, I overrided getPreferredSize() (in MyButtonUI) like this: @Override
public Dimension getPreferredSize(JComponent c) {
    AbstractButton button = (AbstractButton) c;
    int width = Math.max(button.getWidth(), BUTTON_WIDTH);
    int height = Math.max(button.getHeight(), BUTTON_HEIGHT);
    return new Dimension(width, height);
}
 and it works fine.
@CODE:JButton UIManager.setLookAndFeel(UIManager.getSystemLookAndFeelClassName());
UIManager.put("ButtonUI", "com.my.package.MyButtonUI"); com.my.package.MyButtonUI public class MyButtonUI extends BasicButtonUI {

    public static final int BTN_HEIGHT = 24;

        GradientPaint gp;
        if (b.isEnabled()) {
            gp = new GradientPaint(0, 0, Color.red, 0, BTN_HEIGHT * 0.6f, Color.gray, true);
        } else {
            gp = new GradientPaint(0, 0, Color.black, 0, BTN_HEIGHT * 0.6f, Color.blue, true);
        }
        g2d.setPaint(gp);
        g2d.fillRect(0, 0, b.getWidth(), BTN_HEIGHT);

    }

@LINK:/questions/12642243/django-modelforms-display-manytomany-field-as-single-select
@TITLE:Django ModelForms: Display ManyToMany field as single-select
@CONTENT:In a Django app, I'm having a model Bet which contains a ManyToMany relation with the User model of Django: class Bet(models.Model):
    ...
    participants = models.ManyToManyField(User)
 User should be able to start new bets using a form. Until now, bets have exactly two participants, one of which is the user who creates the bet himself. That means in the form for the new bet you have to chose exactly one participant. The bet creator is added as participant upon saving of the form data. I'm using a ModelForm for my NewBetForm: class NewBetForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Bet
        widgets = {
            'participants': forms.Select()
        }

    def save(self, user):
        ... # save user as participant
 Notice the redefined widget for the participants field which makes sure you can only choose one participant. However, this gives me a validation error: Enter a list of values.
 I'm not really sure where this comes from. If I look at the POST data in the developer tools, it seems to be exactly the same as if I use the default widget and choose only one participant. However, it seems like the to_python() method of the ManyToManyField has its problems with this data. At least there is no User object created if I enable the Select widget. I know I could work around this problem by excluding the participants field from the form and define it myself but it would be a lot nicer if the ModelForm's capacities could still be used (after all, it's only a widget change). Maybe I could manipulate the passed data in some way if I knew how. Can anyone tell me what the problem is exactly and if there is a good way to solve it? Thanks in advance! Edit As suggested in the comments: the (relevant) code of the view. def new_bet(request):

@TITLE:Applescript to run Detect Displays
@CONTENT:When I plug an external monitor into my Macbook and wake it, the display is often the wrong resolution. Prior to Mountain Lion, I was able to run the following applescript to detect displays: tell application "System Preferences" to activate
tell application "System Events"
    tell process "System Preferences"
        click menu item "Displays" of menu "View" of menu bar 1
        tell button "Detect Displays" of window 1 to click
    end tell
end tell
tell application "System Preferences" to quit
 But, with 10.8, the "Detect Displays" button requires that you press the Option key to display it, and so the script gives the following error: error "System Events got an error: Can¡¦t get button \"Detect Displays\" of window 1 of process \"System Preferences\"." number -1728 from button "Detect Displays" of window 1 of process "System Preferences" My applescript skills are less than rudimentary and my google-fu has not enabled me to stumble across an answer. How can I modify the script to click the now hidden detect displays button?
@CODE:tell application "System Preferences" to activate
tell application "System Events"
    tell process "System Preferences"
        click menu item "Displays" of menu "View" of menu bar 1
        tell button "Detect Displays" of window 1 to click
    end tell
end tell
tell application "System Preferences" to quit

 rlt is the id of RelativeLayout rlt. Now the flinging in the onFling() does not work with the attribute android:autoLink="email" in the text view with id description. But when I remove that attribute, the fling works. I have no idea why this is happening. How can that attribute affect the fling gesture? EDIT The onTouch() of the GestureListener itself is not called. The logs are never recorded in the logcat. When the attribute android:autoLink="email" is present.

 If I logged out from my preinstalled Facebook app, my application prompts me to login, asking the credentials. That time also, the empty screen appears.But in the preinstalled Facebook app, I can see my updates.( I get Logged in). Update: Right now I'm checking the app only. I have not published it to market. I got the key by referring this site http://sean.lyn.ch/2011/07/android-the-facebook-sdk-sso-and-you/. And I added it to the app, like this. Update 2: Now I got these lines in logcat: 09-29 12:00:12.552: I/ActivityManager(73): Starting activity: Intent { cmp=com.facebook.katana/.ProxyAuth (has extras) }

@TITLE:Functions in critical sections produce data races in OpenMP
@CONTENT:I seem to have a serious lack of understanding of OpenMP concerning the use of critical inside a parallel region. My question is simple: Why does the code below produce warnings with valgrind drd? #include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

void A(int* a)
{
   printf("a++\n");
   (*a)++;
}

void B(int* a)
{
   printf("a--\n");
   (*a)--;
}

void f(int* a)

#pragma omp critical
   A(a);

   sleep(1); /* work done here */

#pragma omp critical
   B(a);
}

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
   int i;
   int a = 0;

#pragma omp parallel for
   for(i = 0; i < 4; ++i)
   {
      f(&a);
   }

   return 0;
}
 It is compiled it with: gcc -fopenmp -g -o omptest omptest.c
 And the valgrind call is valgrind --tool=drd  --check-stack-var=yes ./omptest
 My understanding was that critical sections should protect me from exactly the warning I get. I spend 2 days now trying to figure out the error but I don't find it. It would be very nice if someone could give me a hint on what exactly I didn't understand. Any help is appreciated. EDIT: The (repeating) warning on my 2 CPU machine is: Thread 2:

@LINK:/questions/12623691/session-variable-value-changes-between-page-processing-somehow
@TITLE:Session variable value changes between page processing somehow
@CONTENT:I have a script that processes a search query. The results are returned with a sortable header, so clicking on the Lot # column title would sort the results by the lot # ASC. However, if you had already sorted it ASC (which this is stored in a session variable), it will change it to sort it by the lot # DESC (and update that session variable). All of this works perfectly, so long as thumbnails are not included in the search results. When I do include them (which all that does is change the search query to include the image path, then output an image for the image column), it all breaks. Here is what happens: When the page loads, I response.write(Session["sort"]) to see how I am sorting (ASC or DESC). If a column header is clicked, I check to see if the new "order by" column was already the "order by" column (also stored in a session variable, Session["orderby"]). If it was not previously set as the order by variable, it sets the sort session variable to ASC and sets the order by session variable to the column name. If it was previously set as the order by variable, it checks to see what the current sort session variable equals. If it equals ASC, then it sets the sort session variable to DESC and the order by session variable stays the same. If it equals DESC, it sets the sort session variable to ASC and the order by variable remains the same. This part actually still works to. The problem is that at the end of processing the page, I again response.write(Session["sort"]) to see what the variable has been set to. This is the very last thing that happens before the page loads to the screen. So remember, the very first thing that happens when the page is hit is it prints out the sort session variable, and the very last thing it does is prints out the variable again. So, when images are included in the page, clicking one column will cause it to sort either ASC or DESC (depending on which column I click on, as it seems to alternate with every-other column). So lets say the column I clicked caused the first response.write(Session["sorty"]) to be blank (since it's not set yet), and the second to print ASC. When I click the column again, the first will print DESC (which should be ASC since absolutely nothing is changed between the last one printed and the first one printed), and the second again prints ASC. So somehow, the session variable is being changed between page loads when there is absolutely no page processing between the last print and the first print. (And on every-other column, it's reversed, showing up ASC at the top, and DESC at the bottom every single time.) Again, this works perfectly without the images. Here's the only code with the thumbnail include script in it:     if (Session["incThumb"] != null)
    {
        resultText += "<table style=\"width:100%;\">\n<tr style=\"font-weight:bold;text-align:left;\">\n<th style=\"border-bottom:1px solid #000;\">Thumb</th>\n<th style=\"border-bottom:1px solid #000;\"><a style=\"font-weight:bold; font-color:#000000;\" href=\"searchResults.aspx?page=" + page + "&orderBy=tblItem.item_id\">Item ID</a></th>\n<th style=\"border-bottom:1px solid #000;\"><a style=\"font-weight:bold; font-color:#000000;\" href=\"searchResults.aspx?page=" + page + "&orderBy=item_title\">Title</a></th>\n<th style=\"border-bottom:1px solid #000;\"><a style=\"font-weight:bold; font-color:#000000;\" href=\"searchResults.aspx?page=" + page + "&orderBy=tblItem.item_lot\">Lot</a></th>\n<th style=\"border-bottom:1px solid #000;\"><a style=\"font-weight:bold; font-color:#000000;\" href=\"searchResults.aspx?page=" + page + "&orderBy=tblItem.item_cs_txt_id\">Consignor ID</a></th>\n<th style=\"border-bottom:1px solid #000;\"><a style=\"font-weight:bold; font-color:#000000;\" href=\"searchResults.aspx?page=" + page + "&orderBy=tblMcat.mcat_name\">Master Category</a></th>\n<th style=\"border-bottom:1px solid #000;\"><a style=\"font-weight:bold; font-color:#000000;\" href=\"searchResults.aspx?page=" + page + "&orderBy=tblCat.cat_name\">Category</a></th>\n<th style=\"border-bottom:1px solid #000;\"><a style=\"font-weight:bold; font-color:#000000;\" href=\"searchResults.aspx?page=" + page + "&orderBy=tblItem.item_est_lo\">Low Est.</a></th>\n<th style=\"border-bottom:1px solid #000;\"><a style=\"font-weight:bold; font-color:#000000;\" href=\"searchResults.aspx?page=" + page + "&orderBy=tblItem.item_est_hi\">High Est.</a></th>\n<th style=\"border-bottom:1px solid #000;\"><a style=\"font-weight:bold; font-color:#000000;\" href=\"searchResults.aspx?page=" + page + "&orderBy=tblItem.item_reserve\">Reserve</a></th>\n<th style=\"border-bottom:1px solid #000;\"><a style=\"font-weight:bold; font-color:#000000;\" href=\"searchResults.aspx?page=" + page + "&orderBy=tblItem.item_status\">Status</a></th>\n<th style=\"border-bottom:1px solid #000;\"><a style=\"font-weight:bold; font-color:#000000;\" href=\"searchResults.aspx?page=" + page + "&orderBy=tblItem.item_pr\">Hammer Price</a></th>\n<th style=\"border-bottom:1px solid #000;\"><a style=\"font-weight:bold; font-color:#000000;\" href=\"searchResults.aspx?page=" + page + "&orderBy=tblMailList.mail_ID\">Bidder ID</a></th>\n</tr>\n";

    else

    }
 Then just below this, I also account for it when printing out the SQL results, which is (in English), if the session variable for including thumbnails is not null, include the extra table cell for thumbnails and add in the image. Needless to say, this one has me stumped. I would appreciate any and all responses/comments. Let me know if you want to see anymore code. EDIT Here's the response.write code: protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    Response.Write(Session["sort"] + " 1<br/>");
    string orderBy = "";

    base.SubNavItems.Add("Search Home", "searchHome.aspx");

    if (!IsPostBack)
    {
    }

    if (!String.IsNullOrEmpty(Request.QueryString["page"]))
    {
        if (!String.IsNullOrEmpty(Request.QueryString["orderBy"])){
            orderBy = Request.QueryString["orderBy"].ToString();
        }
        get_page(Int32.Parse(Request.QueryString["page"].ToString()), orderBy);
    }

    if (!String.IsNullOrEmpty(Request.Form["ctl00$ContentPlaceHolder1$save"]))
    {
        click_search();
    }

    Response.Write(Session["sort"] + " 1<br/>");
}
 So because page is always set in the column headers, the get_page() method is called when I sort a column. orderBy is set through the query string and passed along to the method protected void get_page(Int32 page, String orderBy) which is what contains the below code. At the end of that method is also a Response.Write(Session["sort"] + " 2<br/>"); line which is the last thing that method does. No other method runs at this point. Also, I just printed out the sort variable from the .aspx page and got the same result as the last print out of the variable that the .aspx.cs page prints (which is then different from the first one printed the next time). I figure I'll go ahead and add the logic to the whole order by/sort:     if (Session["orderBy"] != null)
    {
        if (Session["orderBy"].ToString() == orderBy)
        {
            if (Session["sort"].ToString() == "ASC")
            {
                Session["sort"] = "DESC";
            }
            else
            {
                Session["sort"] = "ASC";
            }
        }
        else if (!String.IsNullOrEmpty(orderBy))
        {
            Session["sort"] = "ASC";
            Session["orderBy"] = orderBy;
        }
    }
    else if (!String.IsNullOrEmpty(orderBy))
    {
        Session["sort"] = "ASC";
        Session["orderBy"] = orderBy;
    }
    else
    {
        Session["sort"] = "ASC";
        Session["orderBy"] = "tblItem.item_id";
    }
@CODE:response.write(Session["sort"]) Session["orderby"] response.write(Session["sort"]) response.write(Session["sorty"]) if (Session["incThumb"] != null)

@TITLE:Polynomial fitting with log log plot
@CONTENT:I have a simple problem to fit a straight line on log-log scale. My code is, data=loadtxt(filename)
xdata=data[:,0]
ydata=data[:,1]
polycoeffs = scipy.polyfit(xdata, ydata, 1)
yfit = scipy.polyval(polycoeffs, xdata)
pylab.plot(xdata, ydata, 'k.')
pylab.plot(xdata, yfit, 'r-')
 Now I need to plot fit line on log scale so I just change x and y axis, ax.set_yscale('log')
ax.set_xscale('log')
 then its not plotting correct fit line. So how can I change fit function (in log scale) so that it can plot fit line on log-log scale?
@CODE:data=loadtxt(filename)
xdata=data[:,0]
ydata=data[:,1]

@TITLE:C# UTF8 Decoding, returning bytes/numbers instead of string
@CONTENT:I've having an issue decoding a file using an UTF8Encoder. I am reading text from a file which I have encoded with UTF8 (String > Byte) See the following method. public static void Encode(string Path)
    {
        string text;
        Byte[] bytes;
        using (StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(Path))
        {
            text = sr.ReadToEnd();
            UTF8Encoding Encoding = new UTF8Encoding();
            bytes = Encoding.GetBytes(text);
            sr.Close();
        }
        using (StreamWriter sw = new StreamWriter(Path))
        {
            foreach (byte b in bytes)
                sw.Write(b.ToString());
            sw.Close();
        }
    }
 I then decode it using the method     public static String Decode(string Path)
    {
        String text;
        Byte[] bytes;
        using (StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(Path))
        {
            text = sr.ReadToEnd();
            UTF8Encoding Encoding = new UTF8Encoding();
            bytes = Encoding.GetBytes(text);
            text = Encoding.GetString(bytes);
            return text;
        }
    }
 But instead of decoding the byte to have it come back to text, it just returns it as a string of numbers. I can't see what I am doing wrong as I don't really have much experience with this. EDIT: To clarify what I'm trying to achieve. I'm trying to have a text file save the text as bytes, rather than chars/numbers. This is to provide a very simple encryption to the files, that so you can't modify them, unless you know what you're doing. The Decode function is then used to read the text (bytes) from the file and make them in to readable text. I hope this clarified what I'm trying to achieve. PS: Sry for no comments, but I think it's short enough to be understandable
@CODE:public static void Encode(string Path)
    {
        string text;
        Byte[] bytes;
        using (StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(Path))
        {
            text = sr.ReadToEnd();
            UTF8Encoding Encoding = new UTF8Encoding();
            bytes = Encoding.GetBytes(text);
            sr.Close();
        }
        using (StreamWriter sw = new StreamWriter(Path))
        {
            foreach (byte b in bytes)
                sw.Write(b.ToString());
            sw.Close();
        }
    } public static String Decode(string Path)
    {
        String text;
        Byte[] bytes;
        using (StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(Path))
        {
            text = sr.ReadToEnd();

            bytes = Encoding.GetBytes(text);
            text = Encoding.GetString(bytes);
            return text;

 The request_permissions_callback (make a request to paypal and the user is redirected to paypal permissions page.) The response_permissions_callback received response from paypal and call to get_access_token for update the data on my mongodb database.

 Why I get this error in this method if the others 3 methods is working fine and api credentials are correct?, Where is the error? Thank you very much!

@TITLE:How to search a Dictionary with the contents of a list
@CONTENT:Suppose I have a todo file (todo.txt) which looks like this : Call Tom about the Foo project Complete the summary of the Bar project and send it to Thomas Have Susan send me and Tom her forecasts for the Foo project I would like to be able to write these tasks and have Vim append to each line the corresponding categories (@ for persons, & for projects) : Tom (or Thomas) should generate @Tom, Susan should generate @Susan, Foo should generate &Foo and Bar &Bar The outcome thus should be : Call Tom about the Foo project @Tom &Foo Complete the summary of the Bar project and send it to Thomas @Tom &Bar Have Susan send me and Tom her forecasts for the Foo project @Susan @Tom & Foo I have created a Dictionary : let dictodo = {'Tom': "@Tom", 'Thomas': "@Tom", 'Susan': "@Susan", 'Foo': "&Foo", 'Bar': "&Bar",}
 How can I each time I create a new task and leave Insert mode in this specific file have an autocommand launch a function (:autocmd InsertLeave todo.txt :call Filltodo() ?) 1) which will create a list with the different words of the line : I suppose let words = split(getline('.'), '\W\+')
 2) browse the dictodo Dictionary with this list 3) and append the words that have a correspondance in the Dictionary (the result of 2) to the end of the line ? I suppose call setline(line('.'), getline('.') . ' ' . result)
 If I am not mistaken with my solutions for 1) and 3), then 2) is the missing part (I tried keyvar but failed)
@CODE:let dictodo = {'Tom': "@Tom", 'Thomas': "@Tom", 'Susan': "@Susan", 'Foo': "&Foo", 'Bar': "&Bar",} let words = split(getline('.'), '\W\+') call setline(line('.'), getline('.') . ' ' . result)

@TITLE:JSON response: Spring with JAXB
@CONTENT:Tech Stack: Java 1.6, JAXB, Spring 3, JAX-RS (RESTEasy), XSD Hello, I am using Spring with JAX-RS to create RestFul Webservice. Everything is working fine except that the generated responses contain the setters info e.g.   {
    ...

    "setName": true,
    "setId": true,
    "setAddress": true,

}
 I don't know what might be causing this? How can I turn this off? Adi UPDATE 1: The PersonRequest class is generated by the JAXB and contains all the javax.xml.bind.annotation.* annotations. @XmlAccessorType(XmlAccessType.FIELD)
@XmlType(name = "", propOrder = { "personResponse " })
@XmlRootElement(name = "PersonResponse ")
public class PersonResponse {

    @XmlElement(name = "Name", required = true)

    @XmlElement(name = "Id", required = true)
    protected String id;

    // and the setters and getters

 ** UPDATE 2 ** This happens only when Content-Type is json, in case of Content Type as 'xml', the setters are not returned. If that helps.

@TITLE:Fetching irregular data from CRM Dynamics
@CONTENT:I've created a fetch XML that gives me all the contacts in a marketing list. I also would like to get the name of the list baked into the output. I've found two ways to achieve that, none of which is satisfactory to the pedantic me. Go to the DB and fetch the name as a separate request. Have an extra column containing the name of the marketing list for each contact. I'll be getting multiple (maybe even all) marketing lists from CRM so the second version seems most suitable as I'll make one call and get it all into a data structure that I'll play with (DataSet and such are fun). The problem is there that we're getting a lot of redundancy. How can I resolve that?

Looked through many libraries(Jackson , Gson), but found none solving this particular problem. Most of them are annotations based, which I can't use given I don't have source code. One way to solve this problems is, use reflection and recursively go through object until you find a property name of which should be replaced or object is excluded in serialized JSON.

 as you can see, there are two maps declared. Im my website, i'm using horizontal tabs to alternate between showing maps. The problem is one i found in other topics here, but the solutions gave there doesn't seem to work. as you can see in the lines i commented: //google.maps.event.trigger(map1, 'resize');
 //map1.setCenter(myLatlng1); this code is not working to center the second map. The map does not fit on the div correctly, and the center icon is on the left the corner, the usual problem. I guess you already know what the problems are, however if you need pictures i will provide them without a problem. How the tabs code looks on wordpress:     [wptabs type="accordion" mode="horizontal"]

But on iOS 6 on iPad 3, after playing the video, the status bar disappears and is replaced by a white space.

 they are exactly the same, only one takes a double array and one takes an int array, i see some example use Iconvertible but i cant get the syntax right. can someone post some workable snippet for the method pls? can how do i call it? EDIT: thanks very much for the answer, i have another somewhat more complicated case i need to refactor, and the suggestion in here dont work on that 2 methods. Please click this link for more detail how do i refactor these 2 method? part 2
@CODE:public static void outputDetail(DateTime previousTime, ref double[] array, StreamWriter streamWriter)  //the parameter in here is not necessary, but want to maintain a similiarity in the TimeOfDay class

        for (int i = 1; i < array.Length - 1; i++)

@TITLE:How to deal with inherited entity in EF and MVC app?
@CONTENT:I am developing MVC application and using razor syntax. I have used model first method. I have two entities, Customer and Lead. Lead is inherited from Customer. When IsActive property is true then Customer treated as a Lead, otherwise it will be a customer. Please check edmx file image. When I genrated DB from model , I get the two tables Customer Table and Customer_Lead table. This is Customer table. and This is Customer_Lead Table. Now the problem is when I run index view of lead entity , Its give the error. The model item passed into the dictionary is of type PagedList.PagedList1[CRMEntities.Customer], but this dictionary requires a model item of type PagedList.IPagedList1[CRMEntities.Lead]. I am getting confused abt how to write a view for the entity which is inherited from other entity and how to access the data from these two tables while working with inherited entity. Index View code is as below... @model PagedList.IPagedList<CRMEntities.Lead>

@TITLE:time elapsed with pause logic mysql TIMEDIFF() and PHP
@CONTENT:I got this query that takes my elapsed_time and that works fine but then I realized I'm getting the value of actual_elapsed wrong. actual_elapsed is the running time of my timer that I take by using TIMEDIFF(). log_time is a datetime, it is the datetime when the action (play, pause) was inserted/made. sequence is int, it tells me which happened first for each user. status, also int, tells me if the action made was play(1), pause(2) or stop(3). Like I said my problem is getting the right value for actual_elapsed by using TIMEDIFF(now(), log_time). It would've been just fine if I didn't have a pause action.

 My query gives me 09 minutes and 57 seconds, when I should only be getting 49 seconds. My SAMPLE Query.  (" select sequence_num, elapsed_time, status, TIMEDIFF(now(), log_time) as actual_elapsed from tbl");
 I'm trying to get the duration of the actual_elapsed. To do that I'd have to somehow take the total duration of the break time (pause) and then get the difference of elapsed_time and the break time. But I'm having trouble on that part also since the user can pause the timer multiple times. This seemed simple enough when I designed my DB. How do I go about this without so much mess?

@TITLE:option followed by a option in getopt [where the earlier option was expecting a value]
@CONTENT:I have a doubt if we have two option -a and -c and option -a needs to have a value and no value for -c now if i give ->testopt -a -c [testopt is program] then my program takes -c as a value for -a . is there a way where i can make sure that a option with value does not have other options as its values ? the thing is that the system accepts - one keyword's value as another keyword which i need to prevent . e.g. - testopt -a -c. in this case there was a mandatory argument (value ) for -a and no value for -c.. but i my getopt interprets this as "-c" is the value for "-a" how can i throw a error on this using getopt.

The method CGContextMoveToPoint(context, x, y); moves to the point x,y and the method CGContextAddLineToPoint(context, p, q); will draw the line from point A to B. My question is, can I find the all points that the line cover? Actually I need to know the exact point which is x points before the end point B. Refer this image.. The line above is just for reference. This line may have in any angle. I needed the 5th point which is in the line before the point B. Thank you

@TITLE:cant get data from json list
@CONTENT:so far i made a list of airlines and their prices for each flight, and now i want to get all the information about these flights from json list, any way here are the functions: first function works fine: function show_airlines() {
    $.getJSON("http://api.anywayanyday.com/api/NewRequest/?Route=2406MOWLON&AD=1&CN=0&CS=E&Partner=testapic&_Serialize=JSON&callback=?", function(data) {
        var id=data.Id;
        $('#search_id').attr('rel',id);
        $.getJSON("http://api.anywayanyday.com/api/Fares/?R="+id+"&V=Matrix&VB=true&L=ru&_Serialize=JSON&callback=?", function(data) {
            var pricesForEachAirline = [];
            $.each(data.Airlines, function() { 
                var item = { name : this.Name, prices : [], code: this.Code, airid: []};            
                for(var y in this.FaresFull)
                {
                    item.prices.push(this.FaresFull[y].TotalAmount);
                    item.airid.push(this.FaresFull[y].FareId);
                }
                pricesForEachAirline.push(item);
            });
            $.each(pricesForEachAirline , function(){
                $('#airlines').append('<a href="javascript://" onclick="show_flights('+ this.airid +');">'+ this.name +'</a>').append('</br>');
                $('#prices').append(this.prices.join(',')).append('</br>');
            }); 
        });
    });
}
 The Second one doesnt work properly... function show_flights() {
    var id=$('#search_id').attr('rel');
    var list = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 0);
    $.getJSON("http://api.anywayanyday.com/api/Fares/?R="+id+"&V=Matrix&VB=true&L=ru&_Serialize=JSON&callback=?", function(data) {
        var dataForEachFlight = [];
        $.each(data.Airlines, function() { 
            for(var x in this.FaresFull)
            {
                if(this.FaresFull[x].FareId in list) 
                { 
                    var flight = { from : [], to : []}
                    for(var y in this.FaresFull.Directions.Segments.Trips) 
                    {
                        flight.from.push(this.FaresFull.Directions.Segments.Trips.Departure[y].AirportCode);
                        flight.to.push(this.FaresFull.Directions.Segments.Trips.Arrival[y].AirportCode);
                    }
                    dataForEachFlight.push(flight);
                }
            }
        });
        $.each(dataForEachFlight , function(){
            $('#flights').append(this.from.join(',')).append('</br>');
        });
    });
}
 so when i click on the airline link i want to get the information about it's flights only, but it gives out the mistake like: this.FaresFull.Directions is undefined and as an example of json from which i want to get all the information: http://vteem.net/json.json (this is just example, the original u can get from link function) thank you all for the help, i really appreciate it! FUNCTION 2 UPDATE function show_flights() {
var id=$('#search_id').attr('rel');
var list = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 0);
$.getJSON('http://api.anywayanyday.com/api/Fares/?R='+id+'&V=Matrix&VB=true&L=ru&_Serialize=JSON&callback=?', function(data) {
    var dataForEachFlight = [];
    $.each(data.Airlines, function() {
        for(var a in this.FaresFull)
        {
            for(var b in this.FaresFull[a].FareId)
            {    
                if(this.FaresFull[a].FareId[b] in list) 
                { 
                    var flight = { from : [], to : []};
                    for(var c in this.FaresFull[a].Directions[0].Segments[0].Trips) 
                    {                
                        flight.from.push(this.FaresFull[a].Directions[0].Segments[0].Trips[c].Departure.AirportCode);
                        flight.to.push(this.FaresFull[a].Directions[0].Segments[0].Trips[c].Arrival.AirportCode);
                    }
                    dataForEachFlight.push(flight);
                }
            }
        }
    });
    $.each(dataForEachFlight , function(){
        $('#flights').append(this.from.join(',')).append('</br>');
    });
});
 } try #12 Now it gets the data, but it repeats too much :) some mistake in for() clauses.

 When users click on a button, so this method is called & it shows a list of available options to perform this action.So for sending MMS user will have to select "Messaging" option. Although this works fine for Android version 2.3 but when I run the app on version 4.0.3 then in the list of available options it does not show "Messaging" option.Which is must for sending MMS. And when I remove the lines intentEmail.setType("image/jpeg");
intentEmail.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_STREAM, Uri.parse("file://" + file.getAbsolutePath()));
 then the list shows the "Messaging" option but I can not remove it. I am really not getting what is the problem with it or may I will have to add something more for version 4.0.3 . Please help.

@TITLE:OpenCV HighGui fullscreen under linux
@CONTENT:I'm trying to make a simple fullscreen app to display the output of a camera using Open CV. I've got most of the code developed already, I'm just trying to make it fullscreen the window appropriately. I've pared back to the most basic of basic code as follows (taken from the OpenCV website): #include <opencv2/opencv.hpp>
#include <opencv2/highgui/highgui.hpp>

int main ( int argc, char **argv )
{
  cvNamedWindow( "My Window", 1 );
  IplImage *img = cvCreateImage( cvSize( 1920, 1200 ), IPL_DEPTH_8U, 1 );
  CvFont font;
  double hScale = 1.0;
  double vScale = 1.0;
  int lineWidth = 3;
  cvInitFont( &font, CV_FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX | CV_FONT_ITALIC, hScale, vScale, 0, lineWidth );
  cvPutText( img, "Hello World!", cvPoint( 200, 400 ), &font, cvScalar( 255, 255, 0 ) );
  cvSetWindowProperty( "My Window", CV_WND_PROP_FULLSCREEN, CV_WINDOW_FULLSCREEN );
  cvShowImage( "My Window", img );
  cvWaitKey();
  return 0;
}
 When I run this, the window gets created at the 1920x1200 resolution requested, but it's not fullscreened, it's just a normal HighGUI window. I could swear I had this working earlier, but have since trashed and re-installed Ubuntu, and have a feeling I may have forgotten something along the way.

@TITLE:Setting different default values in rails migrations?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to write a migration and it looks something like this: class AddStatusToWorks < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def self.up
    change_table :works do |t|
        t.string :status
    end
  end

  def self.down
    change_table :works do |t|
        t.remove :status
    end
  end
end
 Thing is, I want to set different default values for "status" based on a boolean value that's already in the table, "complete." If complete = true, status = "complete." If not, status = "work in progress." (The reason I want a string instead of keeping complete as the boolean is because I want there to be able to be more than two possibilites for status.) Any idea how to do that? Do I just stick an if statement in there like this change_table :works do |t|
        t.string :status
           if (:complete == true)
               :value => "complete"
           else
               :value => "wip"
end
 Er, so that doesn't look quite right. I googled a bit and found that you can set :default values, but that's not quite what I'm going for. Any ideas/help would be lovely. Thanks!

@TITLE:AS3 - Get font Class object for a TextField
@CONTENT:In a mixed Flash IDE/Flex project, I have a TextField and I want to retrieve the Font class object that's associated with that TextField. The TextField lives in a SWF that was created in the CS4 IDE and is loaded into a Flex SWF. Currently, I have code that works if the following criteria are met: The font is exported in the child SWF's library. The TextField is linked to the exported font. The name of the exported font is hard-coded in the parent SWF. Code as follows: fontClass = childSwf.loaderInfo.applicationDomain.getDefinition("CustomFont") as Class;
 What I really want to do is not have to know the name of the exported font. Instead, I want to grab either the font's Class or the Class name dynamically from the TextField. Even better would be the ability to get the Class for built-in fonts without requiring the export. FWIW, the end goal is to grab any arbitrary TextField and check if it contains characters that its embedded font can't show using Font::hasGlyphs(). However, fonts in child SWFs aren't registered to show up in Font::enumerateFonts().
@CODE:fontClass = childSwf.loaderInfo.applicationDomain.getDefinition("CustomFont") as Class;

@TITLE:Undefined symbols and duplicate symbols errors. Can build for debug, or release, but not both
@CONTENT:I have an issue with a project that includes another project. The second project is an SDK which is required for the main project. At the moment, I have the SDK included in the main project as a static library. Both the SDK and the main project include the FBConnect and Unofficial Twitter SDK frameworks. I believe my problems are a result of these frameworks being included in both projects, but I have been unable to find a way to have them coexist without errors. When the project builds for debug, it will not build for archive, and vice versa. I am able to resolve the issues each time by performing the same steps, but I would like to find a way to resolve it with no steps required between debug and archive builds. When the project builds for debug without any errors, I get the following when trying an archive build: Undefined symbols for architecture armv7:

 Removing the implementation files for the OAUTH library used by the Unofficial Twitter SDK framework from the Compile Sources in Build Phases of the target removes these errors and the project archive build is successful. When I attempt to build the project for debug, I get the opposite of these errors, firstly the OAUTH library symbols are undefined. Adding them to compile sources resolves the issue, then the SBJSON symbols are duplicated. Removing them from compile sources allows the debug build to complete successfully. Does anyone know of a way to have these coexist in harmony so that I can do both debug and archive builds of the project without this file juggling every time?

@LINK:/questions/12611347/is-this-a-formview-bug
@TITLE:Is this a FormView bug?
@CONTENT:I have a FormView (with paging enabled) that is bound to a LinqDataSource on an ASP.NET page. I'm experiencing some very weird behavior and can't figure out why it's happening. For simplicity sake on this question I have removed some unneeded code (other FormView templates, etc) to demonstrate this behavior. My FormView has 3 fields, two textboxes and one DropDownList. The DropDownList is bound to another LinqDataSource on the page and contains foreign key values. When the FormView's LinqDataSource only contains one record and I try to update it, the update fails because the selected value of the DropDownList is always empty, no matter which value I pick for it. When the FormView's LinqDataSource contains 2 or more records, it works as it should. Now here's the really weird thing. The update is actually failing because of the FormView's PagerSettings! When I use just the default Pager settings, all is well. When I change the PagerMode to NextPreviousFirstLast, the update fails. Here's my FormView with it's data sources: <asp:FormView ID="fvData" runat="server" AllowPaging="True" 
    DataKeyNames="ID" DataSourceID="ldsData" DefaultMode="Edit">
    <EditItemTemplate>
        <table class="pad5">
            <tr>
                <td class="field-name">AREA:</td>
                <td>
                    <asp:DropDownList ID="cboAREA" runat="server" DataTextField="AREA_NAME" 
                        DataValueField="AREA1" SelectedValue='<%# Bind("AREA") %>' DataSourceID="ldsAreas" />
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="field-name">LOOP:</td>
                <td><asp:TextBox ID="txtLOOP" runat="server" Text='<%# Bind("LOOP") %>' /></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="field-name">LOOP DESCRIPTION:</td>
                <td><asp:TextBox ID="txtLOOP_DESCRIPTION" runat="server" 
            Text='<%# Bind("LOOP_DESCRIPTION") %>' style="width: 600px" /></td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <asp:Button ID="btnUpdate" runat="server" Text="Update" CommandName="Update" CausesValidation="True" />
        <asp:Button ID="btnCancel" runat="server" Text="Cancel" CommandName="Cancel" CausesValidation="False" />

        Position="TopAndBottom" />
    <PagerStyle CssClass="pager" />
</asp:FormView>

<asp:LinqDataSource ID="ldsData" runat="server" 
    ContextTypeName="E_and_I.EAndIDataDataContext" EnableDelete="True" 
    EnableInsert="True" EnableUpdate="True" EntityTypeName="" 
    TableName="INSTRUMENT_LOOP_DESCRIPTIONs" onselecting="ldsData_Selecting" OrderBy="ID ASC" >
</asp:LinqDataSource>

<asp:LinqDataSource ID="ldsAreas" runat="server" 
    ContextTypeName="E_and_I.EAndIDataDataContext" EntityTypeName="" 
    TableName="AREAs" onselecting="ldsAreas_Selecting">
</asp:LinqDataSource>
 And here's both of my LinqDataSource's Selecting events: EAndIDataDataContext db = new EAndIDataDataContext();

protected void ldsData_Selecting(object sender, LinqDataSourceSelectEventArgs e)
{
    e.Result = db.INSTRUMENT_LOOP_DESCRIPTIONs.Take(1); // we only want one record for testing
}

protected void ldsAreas_Selecting(object sender, LinqDataSourceSelectEventArgs e)
{
    e.Result = db.AREAs.OrderBy(a => a.AREA1).Select(a => new { AREA1 = a.AREA1, AREA_NAME = "(" + a.AREA1 + ") " + a.AREA_NAME });
}
 I've traced the problem to these lines: <PagerSettings Mode="NextPreviousFirstLast" 
    FirstPageText="&amp;lt;&amp;lt; First" LastPageText="Last &amp;gt;&amp;gt;" 
    NextPageText="Next &amp;gt;" PreviousPageText="&amp;lt; Prev" 
    Position="TopAndBottom" />
 As soon as I remove the above PagerSettings element, the FormView updates the record just fine! Does anybody know why the hell the pager settings would have anything to do with this? I'm using the .NET Framework 4.0.

@TITLE:JQuery Mobile in combination with Knockout
@CONTENT:I'm running into some problems with JQuery Mobile in combination with Knockout. Actually both frameworks are completely new to me so I'm a bit lost here in what's actually going wrong. As both frameworks are new to me I decided to pick one of the tutorials (todo list) from the Knockout website and combine it with JQuery Mobile. So far I didn't add much custom code to the original tutorial code, except for a bit of simple HTML. Check out this example on jsFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/nHhHV/2/ If you watch closely, you can clearly see Knockout adding the new item to the list. A split second later however, JQuery Mobile seems to completely re-render that bit of HTML and messes up the form. Without JQuery Mobile it works fine. Anyone knows a solution for this? I would like the form to work with Knockout but keep the JQM look. As I'm new to both frameworks a bit of detail on what's going wrong would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance...

@TITLE:Updating a 2d table of counts
@CONTENT:Suppose I want a Scala data structure that implements a 2-dimensional table of counts that can change over time (i.e., individual cells in the table can be incremented or decremented). What should I be using to do this? I could use a 2-dimensional array: val x = Array.fill[Int](1, 2) = 0
x(1)(2) += 1
 But Arrays are mutable, and I guess I should slightly prefer immutable data structures. So I thought about using a 2-dimensional Vector: val x = Vector.fill[Int](1, 2) = 0
// how do I update this? I want to write something like val newX : Vector[Vector[Int]] = x.add((1, 2), 1)
// but I'm not sure how
 But I'm not sure how to get a new vector with only a single element changed. What's the best approach?
@CODE:val x = Array.fill[Int](1, 2) = 0
x(1)(2) += 1 val x = Vector.fill[Int](1, 2) = 0
// how do I update this? I want to write something like val newX : Vector[Vector[Int]] = x.add((1, 2), 1)

 anything that is printed afterwards is also logged. But for many obvious reasons this is not safe/good. For example multiple logger objects can be nasty. In addition I am inspired by from __future__ import print_function

@TITLE:Buttons on a UICollectionViewCell
@CONTENT:One of the new ios6 classes is uicollectionview which allows one to display items in a grid format similar to the Homescreen / iBooks / Pages layout. Is there was a way to receive a touch event on a button that is on the UICollectionViewCell? Currently, my cell is created through an XIB file and added to the UICollectionView programatically. I'm looking for something similar to the Detail Diclosure Indicator on a UITableView. After looking through Apple's documentation here, I don't see any methods that allow for something like that, but I am positive there's a way to do it. How can one add a button to a UICollectionViewCell and get the indexPath of the cell when the button is tapped? Are there any tutorials or links out there that could be helpful? iOS 6 is fairly new so I haven't found much. Thanks in advance.

@TITLE:implementing a bignum library for rsa encryption
@CONTENT:So of course I know there are simple solutions to this such as using the GMP library or numerous other arbitrary-precision libraries. This is for class work so I am not allowed to take any of these routes. After we build up all our operations we are leading up to be able to do a RSA encryption scheme. I am using vectors to store n-bit numbers represented in binary. I have conversions to decimal later but I must operate on the binary and only convert for display. I have successfully implemented addition, subtraction, and multiplication. I am stuck on division and modular operations... specifically modular exponentiation. I understand the algorithms at least at a basic level but cant seem to translate it into code that will work on arbitrary length numbers. I cant seem to find any examples of this type of work done in c++ without external libraries. Some specific questions: is there a better way to do modulus on a n-bit number besides just calling the division function I am writing and using the remainder returned? I really would love to see some good c++ examples as I cant follow the GMP source code well at all. Any good resources to study or some help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks

I don't see any way to assign a unique name to "Ask" or "Fill-In" fields when adding them to the template via the QuickParts ribbon-menu option. When I iterate the document.Fields collection in the C# program, I must know which field I'm referencing, so it can be assigned the correct value. It seems things have changed between previous versions of Word and Word 2010. So, if you answer please make sure your answer applies to 2010. Don't assume that what used to work in previous versions works in 2010. Much appreciated, since I rarely work with Word and feel like a dolt when trying to figure out the ribbon menuing in 2010.

@TITLE:Loop that creates doubles and insert them into sorted array, in C
@CONTENT:Suppose I have a set of sorted doubles. { 0.124, 4.567, 12.3 }
 A positive, non-zero double is created by another part of the code, and needs to be inserted into this set while keeping it sorted. For example, if the created double is 7.56, the final result is, { 0.124, 4.567, 7.56, 12.3 }
 In my code, this "create double and insert in sorted set" process is then repeated a great number of times. Possibly 500k to 1 million times. I don't know how many doubles will be created in total exactly, but I know the upper bound. Attempt My naive first approach was to create an array with length = upper bound and fill it with zeros, then adding the initial set of doubles to it ("add" = replace a 0 valued entry with the double). Whenever a double is created, I add it to the array and do an insertion sort, which I read is good for sorting ordered arrays. Question I have a feeling running 500k to 1 million insertion slots will be a serious performance issue. (or am I wrong?) Is there a more efficient data structure and/or algorithm for doing this in C? Edit: The reason why I want to keep the set sorted is because after every "create double and insert in sorted set" process, I need to be able to look up the smallest element in that set (and possibly remove it by replacing it with a 0). I thought the best way to do this would be to keep the set sorted. But if that is not the case, perhaps there is an alternative?

@TITLE:GUI calculate button coding error in java
@CONTENT:Okay, first of all the project I am working on has two packages, first is murach.business which contains invoiceCalculations.java Second is murach.forms which contain InvoiceForm.java(JFrame) and SwingValidator.java I need to add an event handler for the actionPerformed event of the Calculate button. Add code to this event handler that gets the customer type and subtotal from the form, uses the calculateDiscountPct method in the InvoiceCalculations class to calculate the the discount percent based on those values, calculates the discount amount and total, and formats and displays the values on the form. The form has 5 rows for instance first customer type, subtotal, discount percent, discount amount and total and below that is calculate and exit button. Here is the stack trace: run:

@CONTENT:I use standard remember_me symfony feature, but it expires every period of time, set in config. E.g. I have lifetime set to 1800. Disregarding of what I do, it logs me off after 0.5 hours after last login. And I want it logs me off only after 0.5 hours of inactivity. Every request should prolong remember me cookie. Could this be done with just config or should I mess with kernel events and hack that manually?

@TITLE:Using Integer in Switch Statement
@CONTENT:For various business reasons I want to hold some static IDs in one of my classes. They were originally int but I wanted to change them to Integer so I could do an equals on them (ie MY_ID.equals(..) which avoids NPEs) When I change them to Integer I get errors in my switch statement. The docs say that Integer should be ok within Switches. To quote [Switch] also works with enumerated types (discussed in Enum Types), the String class, and a few special classes that wrap certain primitive types: Character, Byte, Short, and Integer (discussed in Numbers and Strings). In my code below if i is a int then it compiles. When it is an Integer it doesnt saying that a constant expression is required. I have tried doing .intValue() but this doesnt work either. Am I being really stupid? Or completely misreading the docs? private static final Integer i = 1;

@Test
public void test() {
    switch(mObj.getId()){
        case i: //do something
        default: //do something default
    }

}
 Thanks for any pointers here. For the time being I am keeping them as int and doing new Integer(myint).equals(...)
@CODE:int Integer MY_ID.equals(..) int Integer constant expression is required .intValue() private static final Integer i = 1;

@Test
public void test() {
    switch(mObj.getId()){
        case i: //do something
        default: //do something default

@CONTENT:As part of my automated tests, I need to type a string with special characters ("(PT books)") into a text box on a web application. When I run the test, "(" is always skipped. There is no issue with ")". I started investigating it and tried all special characters that require a shift key to be pressed ("~!@#$%^&*()_+{}|:<>?") and found that it always skipped "(" and "&". I also tried the same test on the Google search box and in this case all characters were displayed. I am using Selenium Web driver(2.25.0) + Java + Firefox(15.0.1). I also have setEnableNativeEvents to false in my firefox profile. I also tried this using Internet Explorer and it works fine. I would like to stick to firefox as most of my tests run on firefox. Any ideas as to why "(" and "&" are not displayed on the web application I am testing? Here is the code that I am using FirefoxProfile profile = new FirefoxProfile();
profile.setEnableNativeEvents( false);
WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(profile);

String searchTerm = "~!@#$%^&*()_+{}|:<>?" ;

String Link = "http://" ;

driver.get( "http://www.google.com");
driver.findElement(By. id("gbqfq")).sendKeys(searchTerm);

driver.get(Link);
driver.findElement(By. id("ctl00_ctl00_FindField_FindField_ctl00_findFieldLinks_basic")).click();
driver.findElement(By. id(UIMapping.SearchBoxId)).sendKeys(searchTerm);
@CODE:"(" ")" shift key ("~!@#$%^&*()_+{}|:<>?") "(" "&" setEnableNativeEvents "(" "&" FirefoxProfile profile = new FirefoxProfile();

@TITLE:Chosen Jquery, retrieving multiple select values in vbscript/classic asp and ASPupload
@CONTENT:this morning I posted a question regarding the Chosen jQuery script which was how im i able to retrieve the values from a chosen jquery multiple select box with classic asp, someone asked me for demo code so when building it, everything seems to work all of the sudden fine, and thought you know i'm getting to old, however after trying to implement the code i ran into the same issues, but I think i might have found the problem that i'm running against. Below you will find the code involved: This includes 2 forms of the chosen jquery (http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/), the top one is a plain form, the second one is a form with upload function, i have included the code below of both pages: Code for 'example.jquery.html' <!doctype html>

@TITLE:NSUserDefaults returns before it has been set
@CONTENT:Im making an app that takes two strings and an int. I want these to be displayed on another view. I have put them into an array and Im trying to store them in the NSUserDefaults. I have managed to get this data stored. The problem that im having is that when I change the data and save it again The function that gets the array is called before the one that sets it . So the application always displays the previous data. I thought It would be easy to fix by changing when the functions are called. but from the code it looks to me lie they are in the right order. 2012-09-26 13:55:02.764 BeerDivider[4377:907] array returnd = (

 I can see from logging the array that they are called in the wrong order. Please can anyone see where im going wrong. This is my first objective-c/xcode post so not sure what code you want to see. I will put in all of it. http://pastebin.com/BX5gqp17 Sorry if this is a lot of code. Thanks for the help.

@LINK:/questions/12602326/accessing-connection-string-from-base-form-causes-designer-error
@TITLE:Accessing connection string from base form causes designer error
@CONTENT:I have a vb.net windows forms application in which I'm using inheritance for the windows forms. I have a base form that provides some of the basic layout and methods that will be used with all inheriting forms. This includes the initialization of an entity framework context in the base form constructor. Dim dataContext As New CCEntities()
 The child form can then make use of this context. The application compiles and runs without error, but when I try to view the child form in the designer, an error is displayed stating, "The specified named connection is either not found in the configuration, not intended to be used with the EntitlyClient provider, or not valid." If I move that initialization line into the child form constructor, the designer displays without error. In an attempt to troubleshoot this, I specified the connection string at initialization time in the base form constructor as: Dim dataContext As New CCEntities(System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings.Item("CCEntities").ConnectionString)
 After adding that reference to the connection string, the child form now displays "Object reference not set to an instance of an object." However, if I hard-code the entity connection string into that initialization line, the designer works fine. It appears that the base form is unable to access the app.config file. How can I get the base form to properly access the app.config file and make the designer work appropriately?

@LINK:/questions/12601302/creating-shared-object-from-static-library-whose-object-files-were-linked-with
@TITLE:Creating shared object from static library whose object files were linked with -fPIC
@CONTENT:For a project we are trying to create a shared object file that exports a set of functions specified in libname.exports. Of course we know that the object files from which the .so file gets linked have to be created using -fPIC, so that has been taken care of. We then combined the object files into an archive named libname.a. This should now be the basis for the .so file to be created - or so was the idea. We're passing libname.exports to --retain-symbols-file, so the expected behavior was that the linker would pull in any of the .a members relevant to those symbols. However, the output of nm libname.so is empty. On the other hand grepping in nm libname.a shows that the relevant symbols named in libname.exports exist in the .a members. Now I stumbled over --whole-archive and thus adjusted the command line from: gcc -o libname.so -shared -Wl,-z,defs,--retain-symbols-file,libname.exports,-L. libname.a -lc
 to: gcc -o libname.so -shared -Wl,-z,defs,--retain-symbols-file,libname.exports,-L.,--whole-archive,libname.a,--no-whole-archive -lc
 which appears to have the intended effect of including all the object files from the .a (although the size difference is strange). However, nm libname.so still gives me no output. How can I use the archive file to create a shared object with only the symbols named in libname.exports visible? Unfortunately How to create a shared object file from static library doesn't quite answer my question. Note: before you ask. The idea behind using the .a file as input is because it makes it easy to use a pattern rule in GNUmakefile and because the .a file with -fPIC is needed regardless. There shouldn't be any difference between linking the individual object files versus the archive file.
@CODE:libname.exports .so -fPIC libname.a .so libname.exports --retain-symbols-file .a nm libname.so nm libname.a libname.exports .a --whole-archive gcc -o libname.so -shared -Wl,-z,defs,--retain-symbols-file,libname.exports,-L. libname.a -lc gcc -o libname.so -shared -Wl,-z,defs,--retain-symbols-file,libname.exports,-L.,--whole-archive,libname.a,--no-whole-archive -lc .a nm libname.so libname.exports .a GNUmakefile .a -fPIC libname.exports libname.a ar x libname.a armembers armembers/*.o libname.a

       OverlayItem overlayitem = new OverlayItem(MainPoint, "Hi!", "You touched this location!");


}
 I want to draw the touched point on my mapview, which is in this activity: public class MyMapLocationActivity extends MapActivity {

@Override
public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);


    setContentView(R.layout.main); 


    mapView = (MapView) findViewById(R.id.mapview);
    mapView.setBuiltInZoomControls(true);

    drawable = this.getResources().getDrawable(R.drawable.androidmarker);           
            MapOverlay myOverlay = new MapOverlay(this, mapView);

    mapView.getOverlays().add(myOverlay);
    mapView.postInvalidate();

}
 I want to mark the touched point, after confirming the dialog box from MapOverlay class. I think I'm missing to pass something - what more should I do?
@CODE:public class MapOverlay extends Overlay {

private Context context;
private ProgressDialog dDialog;  
Drawable drawable;
GeoPoint MainPoint;
MapView mapView;

public MapOverlay(Context context, MapView mapView)
{
    this.context = context;
    this.mapView = mapView;
}

@Override
public boolean onTap(GeoPoint p, MapView mapView) 
{   
      this.MainPoint = p;
      AlertDialog.Builder dialog = new AlertDialog.Builder(context);
      dialog.setMessage("Do you want to set point here?")
             .setCancelable(false)
   .setPositiveButton("Yes", new DialogInterface.OnClickListener() {
       public void onClick(DialogInterface dialog, int id) {
         setPoint();

       }
   })
   .setNegativeButton("No", new DialogInterface.OnClickListener() {
       public void onClick(DialogInterface dialog, int id) {
            dialog.cancel();
       }
   });

      dialog.show();

    return true;
}    

public void setPoint()
{

       OverlayItem overlayitem = new OverlayItem(MainPoint, "Hi!", "You touched this location!");


} public class MyMapLocationActivity extends MapActivity {

@Override
public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);


    setContentView(R.layout.main); 


    mapView = (MapView) findViewById(R.id.mapview);
    mapView.setBuiltInZoomControls(true);

    drawable = this.getResources().getDrawable(R.drawable.androidmarker);           
            MapOverlay myOverlay = new MapOverlay(this, mapView);

@TITLE:How to create a XSD which differs in validation on attribute value?
@CONTENT:I have been searching for a while now, and came to the conclusion it may not be possible to change the validation per value of an attribute. For example I have two "action" nodes, both with a "type" attribute and two elements ("name" and "description") Only when the value of the "type" attribute is "1" it has an "a" element with "abc" child elements and when the "type" attibute is "2" it has a "bla" element with "yet" child elements. Example of type 1 <action type="1">
  <name>yup</name>
  <description>yyy</description>
  <a>
    <abc>false</abc>
  </a>
</action>
 Example of type 2 <action type="2">
  <name>yup2</name>
  <description>RRR</description>
  <bla>
    <yet />
  </bla>
</action>
 I want to create one XSD* who whould check both types, is this possible? And if so, how? It has to be one XSD because I want to put the XSD on a XML column of a table of a MSSQL database.
@CODE:<action type="1">
  <name>yup</name>
  <description>yyy</description>
  <a>
    <abc>false</abc>
  </a>
</action> <action type="2">
  <name>yup2</name>
  <description>RRR</description>
  <bla>
    <yet />
  </bla>
</action>

@TITLE:How to access the controls on UIView which is added to a UIScrollView
@CONTENT:I have a UIViewController in storyboard that includes a scrollView. I want to put two UIImageViews and some UILabels on it. the idea that I am thinking is : create a .xib file. Put a UIView on it, an then set my UIImageview and labels on this UIView. Finally add my UIView which is a .xib file to my UIScrollView like this:  NSArray *views = [[NSBundle mainBundle] loadNibNamed:@"OfferView" owner:self options:nil];
UIView *newPageView = [views lastObject];
self.newPageView.contentMode = UIViewContentModeScaleAspectFill;
newPageView.frame = frame;
[self.scrollView addSubview:newPageView];
[self.pageViews replaceObjectAtIndex:page withObject:newPageView];
 Now I want to set Text and image for the controls on the UIView programatically in my UIViewController. I try this but it did not work: OfferUIView *offer2 = [[OfferUIView alloc] init];;
offer2.labelCompany.text = @"some text";
 I also defined OfferUIView in the interface of ViewController and then synchronize, but it did not help also: @property (nonatomic, assign) OfferUIView *offerView;
 Can you help me?
@CODE:NSArray *views = [[NSBundle mainBundle] loadNibNamed:@"OfferView" owner:self options:nil];
UIView *newPageView = [views lastObject];
self.newPageView.contentMode = UIViewContentModeScaleAspectFill;
newPageView.frame = frame;
[self.scrollView addSubview:newPageView];
[self.pageViews replaceObjectAtIndex:page withObject:newPageView]; OfferUIView *offer2 = [[OfferUIView alloc] init];;
offer2.labelCompany.text = @"some text"; OfferUIView @property (nonatomic, assign) OfferUIView *offerView;

@TITLE:How to hide and show p:panel on commandbutton click
@CONTENT:i have the following problem: I'm new to JSF2 and primefaces. I have a table in a page that will be populated with information, after the user enters a string and clicks a CommandButton. After clicking the button, I want it to be disabled until processing is over. To disable the CommandButton I'm doing the following; <p:commandButton update=":outPanel" widgetVar="btnSend" id="btnsend"
     value="Calcular" actionListener="#{calcBean.getTrfs}" 
     onclick="btnSend.disable()" oncomplete="btnSend.enable()" />  
 And then I have a panel where I want to show its contents: <p:panel id="outPanel" widgetVar="outpanel">
         #{calcBean.result}
</p:panel>
 How can I hide this outpanel when the page loads the first time? How can I hide it when I click the CommandButton, and only show it again if the processing in my bean is successful? Thanks.
@CODE:<p:commandButton update=":outPanel" widgetVar="btnSend" id="btnsend"

@CONTENT:I would like to log an apps-script that is meant to be run as a service, and requires user-interaction. The log journal (in google script editor) logs indeed the "doGet start" entry but not the "handler" one... as clicking on the "execute" button in the google editor does not show the UiApp. The only way I found to effectively see the Ui is to publish the script and execute its public url... but then I don't know where to find the logs. Any hint is welcome, thanks. function doGet() {

 What I would like to do is put an NAduring the periods when a TTR is not significant. For example if the RSI2 TTR turns out not to be significant during the first quarter I would like to replace the numerical values by NAs , but if the RSI2 is significant during the 5th quarter I would like to keep the numerical values. At the end, I should get a data frame which dimensions are the same as the intial data frame. Any idea? Thanks!

@TITLE:Finding consecutively increasing subsequence stored in a haphazard manner
@CONTENT:The problem is this, given an array of length say N, we have to find all subsequences of length W such that those W elements, when sorted, forms an arithmetic progression with interval 1. So for an array like [1,4,6,3,5,2,7,9], and W as 5, the slice [4,6,3,5,2] can be regarded as one such subsequence, since, when sorted, it yields [2,3,4,5,6], an A.P with common difference 1. The immediate solution which comes to the mind is to have a sliding window, for each new element, pop the old one, push the new one, sort the window, and if for that window, window[w-1] - window[0] + 1 = w, then it is such a subsequence. However, it takes O(NlogN) time, whereas the solution at Codechef proposes a O(N) time algorithm that uses double-ended queue. I am having difficulty in understanding the algorithm, what is being pushed and popped, and why so, and how it maintains the window in sorted order without the need to resort with each new element. Can anybody explain it?
@CODE:N W W [1,4,6,3,5,2,7,9] W [4,6,3,5,2] [2,3,4,5,6] window[w-1] - window[0] + 1 = w O(NlogN) O(N) N 1..N-1 N 1..N-1 {1,2} 1..N

@TITLE:ObjectOutputStream.readInt() throws EOFException even if there is still data in file
@CONTENT:We have a problem in our application which can be reduced to this code: public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
        File tempFile = File.createTempFile("teststream", "");
        FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(tempFile);
        ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(fos);
        oos.writeInt(1);
        oos.writeObject("foo");
        oos.writeInt(2);
        oos.flush();
        oos.close();
        FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(tempFile);
        ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(fis);
        int n1 = ois.readInt();
        Object o1 = ois.readObject();
        int n2 = ois.readInt();
    }
 This code works, although if you comment the following line: Object o1 = ois.readObject();
 The following line int n2 = ois.readInt();
 will throw an EOFException although there is data in my file since I wrote an object and an integer in it. The javadoc of readInt does not indicate this behavior. I'm a little bit worried about this EOFException, since we would like to distinguish in our code between a real there is nothing more to read in your file exception and a wrong type of content one. The stack trace for the exception is Exception in thread "main" java.io.EOFException
    at java.io.DataInputStream.readInt(DataInputStream.java:392)
    at java.io.ObjectInputStream$BlockDataInputStream.readInt(ObjectInputStream.java:2793)
    at java.io.ObjectInputStream.readInt(ObjectInputStream.java:968)
 Which means the following code in DataInputStream throws the exception:  public final int readInt() throws IOException {
        int ch1 = in.read();
        int ch2 = in.read();
        int ch3 = in.read();
        int ch4 = in.read();
        if ((ch1 | ch2 | ch3 | ch4) < 0)
            throw new EOFException();
 But in.read() is not supposed to return a negative number when there is data in the input stream so I'm really intrigued. Is there something that can be done in my code to prevent this from happening (knowing that we might at some point call readInd where writeObject was used)?

@TITLE:how do I prevent spring mvc overwriting sessionattributes from request
@CONTENT:I have an MVC spring application where the user logs on, this stores a User @SessionAttribute , which I refer to subsequently e.g. when updating a Customer object in a POST request I want the session User info to add to this object. My problem is when I access the @ModelAttribute("user") User object in the customer POST, spring has bound request parameters into it i.e. the User.name has the value of the Customer.name from the submitted form. NB I've kind of hacked this in that all controllers are subclasses of my AppController, which is where the @SessionAttributes are declared. But the principle would be the same if it was a single controller. So can I prevent spring binding form:customer name value to User.name? (I suspect webflow would be a more suitable framework for this, but don't have the time available right now to rewrite using this)

This iframe loads the page from some other domain (cross domain scripting is in action). Now when I click a button in this iframe, it makes an AJAX request through jQuery and creates a text file on the PHP server. Now I want that a normal 'Save as' dialog box should appear so that I user can download that file from the server. I have tried all the Content-Disposition and header() function in PHP side but the 'Save as' dialog does not appear although the file is created successfully on the server. I think, the problem is that I want to trigger the file download from the iframe which is loading content from some other domain. Is there any workaround for this? Thanks.

public class Die {

@CONTENT:I'm trying to update a local Access 2010 table by pulling data from a remote PostgreSQL database using an ODBC connection. When I manually specify WHERE conditions in the Access update query, I can see on the database server that a limited number of rows are being passed to Access. However, when I make the WHERE condition dynamic---based on the last row in the local Access table---the entire table appears to be pulled into Access and the condition applied in memory (I presume, since it never completes). For example, this query only fetches the 2012 rows from from the remote database, and I can see the WHERE clause on the remove server: INSERT INTO local (dt, latitude, longitude)
SELECT dt, latitude, longitude
FROM remote_odbc
WHERE remote_odbc.dt > #2011-12-31 23:59:59#;
 But what I really want is for access to look at the last datetime (dt) in the local table and only retrieve those rows from the remote database. This is what I tried: INSERT INTO local (dt, latitude, longitude)
SELECT dt, latitude, longitude
FROM remote_odbc, (SELECT max(dt) AS max_dt FROM local) AS sub
WHERE remote_odbc.dt > max_dt;
 When I do this, the query being run on the server has no WHERE clause in it at all, which makes me think that Access is retrieving the entire remote table, and then applying the WHERE clause locally. The table is too large and the Internet is too slow for this to be practical. How can I re-write my update query so it will only retrieve the rows I want over the ODBC link?
@CODE:WHERE WHERE WHERE INSERT INTO local (dt, latitude, longitude)
SELECT dt, latitude, longitude
FROM remote_odbc
WHERE remote_odbc.dt > #2011-12-31 23:59:59#; dt INSERT INTO local (dt, latitude, longitude)
SELECT dt, latitude, longitude

@TITLE:how to build game playing neural network in Python?
@CONTENT:I am a neural-network beginner. I'd like to learn the basics of neural networks by teaching computers to play checkers. Actually, the games I want to learn are Domineering and Hex. These games are pretty easy to store and the rules are much simpler than chess, but there aren't too many people who play. If I can get this idea off the ground it would be great for experimenting Combinatorial Game Theory. PyBrain seems to be the clear winner for Python neural networks, but who can walk me through how to set up a neural net for my game-playing task? A google search turned up Blondie24 in 2001 but it uses some genetic algorithms - I don't want to complicate things.

@TITLE:Entity Framework 5 complex type and unknown column in field list error
@CONTENT:Bear with me as I'm new to C# and programming in general. I'm trying to define a complex type that is in the same table as the principle class. Basically, it's the good old User and Address example. public class Customer
{
    [Key]
    public int customerId { get; set; }

    //some attributes

    public string street { get; set; }
    public string city { get; set; }
    public string province { get; set; }
    public string country { get; set; }
    public string postal { get; set; }
}
 So I try to slice off the address information into its own class: public class Customer
{
    [Key]
    public int customerId { get; set; }

    //some attributes
    public Address address { get; set; }
}

[ComplexType]
public class Address
{
    public string street { get; set; }
    public string city { get; set; }
    public string province { get; set; }
    public string country { get; set; }
    public string postal { get; set; }
}
 I get no compile error and when I load a view that access the Customer model, I get an unknown column in field set error. Unknown column 'Extent1.address_street' in 'field list' I basically followed this example: http://weblogs.asp.net/manavi/archive/2010/12/11/entity-association-mapping-with-code-first-part-1-one-to-one-associations.aspx Is there something I"m missing or something different with EF5?
@CODE:public class Customer
{
    [Key]
    public int customerId { get; set; }

    //some attributes

    public string street { get; set; }
    public string city { get; set; }
    public string province { get; set; }
    public string country { get; set; }
    public string postal { get; set; }
} public class Customer
{
    [Key]
    public int customerId { get; set; }

    //some attributes
    public Address address { get; set; }
}

[ComplexType]
public class Address
{
    public string street { get; set; }
    public string city { get; set; }
    public string province { get; set; }
    public string country { get; set; }

@TITLE:Android socket inputstream read (followed by an EPIPE)
@CONTENT:I am creating some client-side socket software to read events from a server. (For example, streaming stock quotes). PROBLEM: .read(b); is returning immediately with a value of -1. This causes an infinte loop and the phone becomes very hot. Additionally, all checks to s.isConnected(), isOpen(), isBound() return true. Essentially the socket looks connected. (This is an error scenario, so any value of .setSoTimeout(x) has no effect. 12 minutes, or leave empty. The .read(b) always returns -1 immediately). When I write to it later, via the getOutputStream(), I receive an exception EPIPE (broken pipe). Here's the core code (log statements/value checks omitted for brevity). s.connect(new InetSocketAddress(host, port), CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MILLIS);

byte[] b = new byte[1024];
while (s.isConnected()) {
    int bytesToRead = s.getInputStream().read(b);
    if (bytesToRead <= 0) {
        LOGGER.debug("no bytes read? trying again.");
        continue;
    }
    processFrame(b);
}
 If I cycle the 3g on the phone, it works fine. Sometimes it gets into this weird state. Question Am I doing something wrong? Is this the expected behavior? Is there existing code I could look at to show the right way to do socket programming on Android?
@CODE:s.connect(new InetSocketAddress(host, port), CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MILLIS);

@CONTENT:I'm continuing exploring Cassandra and I would like to create Student <=> Course relation which is similar to Many-to-Many on RDBMS. In term of Queries I will use the following query; Retrieve all courses in which student enrolled. Retrieve all students enrolled in specific course. Let's say that I create to Column Families. one for Course and another for Student. CREATE COLUMN FAMILY student with comparator = UTF8Type AND key_validation_class=UTF8Type and column_metadata=[

 Now how should I move on? Should I create third Column Family with courseID:studentId CompisiteKey? if yes, Can I use Hector to query by only one (left or right) Composite key component? Please help. Update: Following the suggestion I created the following Schema: For Student: CREATE COLUMN FAMILY student with comparator = UTF8Type and key_validation_class=UTF8Type and default_validation_class=UTF8Type;
 and then we will add some data: set student['student.1']['firstName']='Danny'
set student['student.1']['lastName']='Lesnik'
set student['student.1']['course.1']=''
set student['student.1']['course.2']='';
 Create column Family for Course: CREATE COLUMN FAMILY course with comparator = UTF8Type and key_validation_class=UTF8Type and default_validation_class=UTF8Type;
 add some data: set course['course.1']['name'] ='History'
set course['course.1']['description'] ='History Course'

 and Finally Student In Course: CREATE COLUMN FAMILY StudentInCourse with comparator = UTF8Type and key_validation_class=UTF8Type and default_validation_class=UTF8Type;

@CONTENT:I have a weird problem in my game. I'm using 2 joysticks, one for shooting/aiming and one for moving my character. For some reason my multitouch method only registers one movement at a time. The second pointer gets registered when I press down, but my ACTION_MOVE only works for the first pointer. This is weird cus this means it does take more then one pointer, but it cant move more then one pointer at the same time. Ive asked this on gamedev.stackexchange and its been active for about a week, gotten a couple of answer but nothing that makes it work 100%. And I've tried for hours on my own.

                actionString = "MOVE";
                break;

    }
 If I print actionString and pid it shows that when moving, it only checks pid=0, but when i press down ( ACTION_POINTER_DOWN ) I can see that it does register another pid, this is whats really confusing me. Just to make it more clear, when I press the second pointer down on for example my shooting-stick, it takes the position of where I pressed, even if I'm moving the other joystick at the same time, but it stays there until I let go of the other joystick. Furhter proof that it does register more then 1 touch and more then 1 pid. Please let me know if you need any further explenation.

@TITLE:Crystal Reports & VBScript - Could Not Locate Automation Class
@CONTENT:First off, I have very little Crystal Reports experience, so apologies in advance if this is a stupid question. I had this "fantastic" work project dumped on me when a co-worker left, so I'm hoping someone can help as most of the Business Objects links I find that might have solutions just redirect to a generic SAP splash page. So I have a few hundred Crystal Reports (mostly File Schema 10.2, although some are 8.5 or 12.0) that are stored on a server. All of them have an associated VBScript file that calls them in the following way: Set AppCrystal = WScript.CreateObject("CrystalRuntime.Application.10")


Set CrystalReport = AppCrystal.OpenReport("<file path to report>")
Set CrystalOptions = CrystalReport.exportOptions
CrystalOptions.DestinationType = 1
CrystalOptions.FormatType = 36
CrystalOptions.DiskFileName = "<file path to output excel file>"
CrystalReport.Export False
 According to BO, this should be correct. See the following links about the CR API: http://devlibrary.businessobjects.com/businessobjectsxi/en/en/RDC_SDK/rdc_com_dg_doc/doc/rdcsdk_com_doc/RDC_ObjectModel62.html http://devlibrary.businessobjects.com/businessobjectsxi/en/en/RDC_SDK/rdc_com_dg_doc/doc/rdcsdk_com_doc/RDC_ObjectModel151.html#1387900 http://devlibrary.businessobjects.com/businessobjectsxi/en/en/RDC_SDK/rdc_com_dg_doc/doc/rdcsdk_com_doc/RDC_ObjectModel8.html#1646326 So basically the script just executes the report and outputs it to an Excel file. This works great on the old server, but when I try to execute this script on the new server I get the following error: I assume this is because there's some kind of runtime components I need to install, but I can't for the life of me figure out what. I found this page: https://wiki.sdn.sap.com/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=56787567 But none of the files I've tried to download have worked, and, frankly, I've found SAPs documentation to be sub-par in this area. I do have Crystal Reports 2008 available, so if I need to update the vbscript to use CrystalRuntime.Application.12 or something and then install the newest runtime files for Crystal Reports 2008 on the server, that'd be fine. But I still need to know what runtime files to use? Nothing I can find has worked. Help?
@CODE:Set AppCrystal = WScript.CreateObject("CrystalRuntime.Application.10")


Set CrystalReport = AppCrystal.OpenReport("<file path to report>")
Set CrystalOptions = CrystalReport.exportOptions
CrystalOptions.DestinationType = 1
CrystalOptions.FormatType = 36

@TITLE:Address range of a dynamically loaded library under Linux
@CONTENT:I have a working program that loads plugins with dlopen. New requirement: at some point in the code, I'm given a pointer, and I need to test whether this pointer points into the code or static data of a plugin. bool is_pointer_into_plugin(void *p, void *handle);
 Equivalently, I need to retrieve the plugin into which a pointer points, if any. I also need to know if the pointer points into the main program's code or static data (and ideally, distinguish between read-only and read-write areas). void *handle plugin_containing_pointer(void *p);
 Equivalently, I need to be able to retrieve the extent (address and size) at which a plugin is mapped. I also need this information for the main program. How can I implement is_pointer_into_plugin, or plugin_containing_pointer, or something equivalent? I can change the call to dlopen if necessary. The lookup should be reasonably fast as possible, the load-time code doesn't need to be fast. Running the plugins in separate processes and communicating through shared memory is not an option. My program runs under Linux (and Windows, but that's another question). Future portability to other unix systems (at least to OSX) would be a plus.

@TITLE:During Silverlight ChildWindow closing animation user can click any button
@CONTENT:I am developing a rich user interface using Silverlight 5. I have lots of ChildWindows. Child Window has sort of buttons which are bound with Commands. I realized that if Child Window Close method is called, closing animation begins. However during animation user can click any button, which causes unexpected situations. To prevent this I need to unbind all buttons immediately on close request. I don't like to put this logic everywhere. Do you have any better solutions? <Grid x:Name="LayoutRoot" DataContext="{StaticResource ResourceKey=viewModel}">
    <StackPanel>
        <TextBlock Text="{Binding ConfirmMessage}" HorizontalAlignment="Center" Margin="5"/>
        <StackPanel Orientation="Horizontal" HorizontalAlignment="Center">
            <Button Width="120" Height="30" Content="Yes" Margin="5" Command="{Binding ConfirmedCommand}"/>
            <Button Width="120" Height="30" Content="No" Margin="5" Command="{Binding RejectedCommand}"/>
        </StackPanel>
    </StackPanel>
</Grid>
 To clarify, use a simple child window with above content. And bind ConfirmedCommand and RejectedCommand to simple commands which executes informative message boxes. Try close child window with close button on top right. During animation fastly click one of the buttons. You will see the message. Edit: I have removed closing animation and it solved the problem in another way. For those who wants animation original problem remains same.
@CODE:<Grid x:Name="LayoutRoot" DataContext="{StaticResource ResourceKey=viewModel}">

@CONTENT:Hi I have about six months experience in web development. I have the following observation, I use <div> tags a lot, it gives me the ability to position the elements, to archive the elements, and it seems I can use <div> tags to do everything, simply playing with its display property. I've never had to use <ul> or <li> elements in combination, except for horizontal menu navigation, and I am not sure why you can't do it with <div> elements, but it seems to be the 'convention' for achieving a horizontal menu. Did I miss something? Are there some properties that <li> elements have that are better or more useful than <div> elements? Please don't restrict this question to only horizontal menu list; I want to know any scenario where you would use a <li> over something else.

 I think NSPredicate looks for the first layer of objects in NSSet.[Highlighted above]. To overcome this issue I traverse through all the sets and get the MyObject instances. Is there any better approach than this? It's too time consuming to get values for obj1,obj2,obj3,obj4.

@LINK:/questions/12585868/add-jar-with-dependencies-artifact-from-other-maven-module
@TITLE:Add jar-with-dependencies artifact from other Maven module
@CONTENT:I have a multi-module Maven project. One of the modules is responsible for packaging up the outputs of all the other modules into one deliverable. I'm currently hitting a problem where my assembly is unable to gather the output from the other modules, failing with the message: [WARNING] The following patterns were never triggered in this artifact 
  inclusion filter:
o  '*:a'
 A simplified version of my project layout is show below, where moduleA is a project that builds a standard jar-with-dependencies output and moduleB is my module responsible for packaging. The root-level pom.xml lists moduleA and moduleB as modules. parent
|- moduleA (foo:a)
   |- pom.xml
   |-src
     |- ...   
|- moduleB (foo:b)
   |- pom.xml
   |- src
      |- main
         |- assembly
            |- assembly.xml
|- pom.xml
 I have created an assembly descriptor for moduleB that currently looks like this: <assembly>
  <id>dist</id>
  <formats>
    <format>tar.gz</format>
  </formats>

  <moduleSets>
    <moduleSet>
      <includes>

          </dependencySet>
        </dependencySets>
      </binaries>
    </moduleSet>
  </moduleSets>
</assembly>
 I have also listed moduleA as a dependency of moduleB in moduleB's pom.xml file (compile scope). I have done this because I believe it will force moduleB to be built after moduleA; it appears to work. Can anyone suggest why my moduleB assembly is not gathering up the jar-with-dependencies output from moduleA and complaining about the pattern never being triggered? I have tried specifying the groupId of moduleA (rather than using a wildcard) but it has not helped. I have also attempted to simplify the assembly descriptor for moduleB as follows, without any change in result: <assembly>
  <id>dist</id>
  <formats>
    <format>tar.gz</format>

@TITLE:Memory Leak in a list of pointers to objects
@CONTENT:I have a list of pointers to objects.  std::list<X*> xList;
 All I need is the size of the list so my method, populates this list and calls size() on it and then returns the size. NOTE: I know this is not the best solution, but I am using an API that provides a list with dynamically allocated objects and this is the only way I can do it. Now valgrind is saying that there's memory leaks here. I am assuming that this is because I never delete the objects that are in the list. I thought I'll do this: std::list<X*>::iterator iter;
for (iter = xList.begin(); iter != xList.end(); ++iter)
{
    delete (*iter);
}
 but is this the best solution to this?

 I would like to know for each working quarter what are the most significant technical rules. I've decided to use the Random Forest-RI algorithm which have been coded in the randomForestpackage, compute the Breiman importance measure (thanks to the importancefunction) and selection the technical rules that have a variable importance measure greater that the mean of the quarterly sample. Eventually, I would like to get the reduced dataset of technical rules during the whole period to compute statistics and so on. Given that the number of significant technical rules can vary over time, the dimensions of the array which contains the most significant technical rules are not the same from a quarter to antoher. As a consequence, I can't put all my values in a single object. Is there a convenient way to store all my quarter dataset? thanks.

 It always hit no match but parentID = 1 and there's one record with ID = 1.. Anyone has an idea of what is wrong? Thank you The record source is this table: CREATE TABLE [dbo].[ProposalFollowUp](

 here's a screenshot of the form properties Finaly, if I show the navigation bar, I can see there's a filter. Probably because I open the form like this DoCmd.OpenForm "ProposalsFollowUp", , , "[ID] = " & txtID, acFormEdit, acDialog
 If I remove the filter, it works. Alright Here's the final code Private Sub btnShowPrevious_Click()
    Dim parent As Integer
    parent = ParentID
    Me.Filter = ""
    Dim rs As DAO.Recordset
    Set rs = Me.RecordsetClone
    rs.FindFirst "[ID]=" & parent

@TITLE:how do I pause the SpriteAnimation in libGDX with a button to be able to view the current frame when pause button is pressed?
@CONTENT:I was trying to pause the animation with a pause/resume button, by doing this : public static int gameStatus = 1;
public int gamePaused = 0;
public int gameRunning = 0;
public void create(){
  gameRunning = 1;
  //.. code
}
public void render(){
   if(gameStatus == gameRunning){

            pause.setClickListener( new ClickListener() {

                @Override
                public void click(Actor actor, float x, float y) {
                    System.out.println("pause is pressed");
                    //to stop the animation at a particular frame
                    spriteBatch.begin();
                    spriteBatch.draw(currentFrame, 100, 100);                        
                    spriteBatch.end();
                    if(gameStatus!=gamePaused)
                    {
                        gameStatus = gamePaused;
                    }
                    else
                    {
                        gameStatus = 1;
                    }

                }
            });
//rest of my render animation code .. 
   }
}
 But on the desktop it shows 3/4th of the current frame and 1/4th of the next frame. Any idea why? And in android it behaves like the entire image is shivering.I'm wondering maybe its because its calling render() again and again. I dont understand why there is a difference in the ouput in android and the desktop version. Aren't they supposed to be the same? I think there is some indexing issue between the two. Any body else experienced the same issue? Any suggestions or a proper way to pause the animation or a tutorial link would be really helpful. Thankyou.

@TITLE:Set columns of JTable in specified order after creation
@CONTENT:There is a JTable with columns in predifined order. Like +----------------------+ |id | name |age | I want to move columns in the order (for example name=0, age=1, id=2). +----------------------+ |name | age | id | How can i achive that? JTable has method moveColumns, but unfortunately this is not enough. Assume order is strored in map:. Map<String, Integer> columnOrder = getOrder();
for(Map.Entry<String, Integer> e : columnOrder.entrySet()) {
    int columnIndex = jtable.convertColumnIndexToView(jtable.getColumn(e.getKey()).getModelIndex());
    jtable.getColumnModel().moveColumn(columnIndex, e.getValue());
}
 This does not work, because moveColumn also moves other columns, so from docu: void moveColumn(int columnIndex,
          int newIndex)
 Moves the column and its header at columnIndex to newIndex. The old column at columnIndex will now be found at newIndex. The column that used to be at newIndex is shifted left or right to make room. Can i (dynamically) somehow put the columns in the exactly same order as in my map?
@CODE:Map<String, Integer> columnOrder = getOrder();
for(Map.Entry<String, Integer> e : columnOrder.entrySet()) {
    int columnIndex = jtable.convertColumnIndexToView(jtable.getColumn(e.getKey()).getModelIndex());
    jtable.getColumnModel().moveColumn(columnIndex, e.getValue());

 I'm very new to this new module concept in JBoss 7. Any idea what is the issue here? Thank you! Details on what I tried to do: I want to be able to make this dependency jar available globally. So what I did was created a folder structure modules/common_libs/test/main and placed the required jar in it. Then created the module descriptor module.xml: <module xmlns="urn:jboss:module:1.1" name="common_libs.test">
    <resources>
        <resource-root path="test.jar"/>
    </resources>
</module>
 Then in the application from which I need to access this jar, I added in the MANIFEST.MF: Dependencies: common_libs.test
 The application is a war file and I deployed it under the deployment folder, and created a .war.dodeploy file. I get this exception when I start the JBoss server. Any idea, anyone? Thanks!

@LINK:/questions/12580464/how-to-properly-secure-form-with-captcha
@TITLE:How to properly secure form with CAPTCHA
@CONTENT:I am working on maintaining some page developed by someone other. I have noticed, that forms are secured by some kind of image CAPTCHA, which is generated every time user enters page. CAPTCHA is stored in hidden input named check, and value entered by user is compared with value from hidden input after submitting form. I have tried to use cURL to read page and parse CAPTHA from that hidden input. $curl = curl_init();
curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_URL, "http://example.com/form/");
curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);

$result = curl_exec($curl);

$html = str_get_html($result);
$captcha = $html->find('input[name=check]');
var_dump($captcha[0]->value);

curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_POST, true);
curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, array(
    "name"      => "Joe",
    "telephone" => "1423456789",
    "message"   => "Lorem ipsum",
    "auth"      => $captcha[0]->value,
    "check"     => $captcha[0]->value,
    "submit_f1" => "Send"
));

$result = curl_exec($curl);
curl_close ($curl);
 Running above script causes correct form submit. What is more, I have noticed, that I can simply overwrite auth and check values in post array:     "auth"      => 123,
    "check"     => 123,
 and form is being submitted correctly as well. I realize that there is not 100% safe method to secure forms, but how can I protect my form a little more and make automated submitting a little harder.
@CODE:check $curl = curl_init();
curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_URL, "http://example.com/form/");
curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);

$result = curl_exec($curl);

$html = str_get_html($result);
$captcha = $html->find('input[name=check]');
var_dump($captcha[0]->value);

    "submit_f1" => "Send"
));

$result = curl_exec($curl);
curl_close ($curl); auth check "auth"      => 123,
    "check"     => 123, google recaptcha

@TITLE:Sending files over MSMQ
@CONTENT:In a retail scenario where each stores report their daily transaction to the backend system at the end of the day. Today a file consisting of the daily transactions and some other meta information is transferred from the stores to the backend using FTP. I¡¦m currently investigating replacing FTP with something else. MSMQ has been suggested as an alternative transport mechanism. So my question is, do we need to write a custom windows service that sticks the daily transactions file into a message object and sends it on its way or is there any out the box mechanism in MSMQ to handle this? Also, since the files we want to transfer can reach 5-6 Mb for large stores should we rule out MSMQ? In that case is there any other suggested technologies we should investigate? Cheers!

@TITLE:Load Ektron widget by ID?
@CONTENT:I am looking for some help with an Ektron problem. The scenario is that we have a number of widgets which sit on a number of pages. These widgets all take user input. As the user moves through the pages filling out the form we save their field responses into a session state object, these get written to a database later. When the user gets to the end of the form we want to display all the widgets that they have filled out in a read-only mode. This will act as a summary page. We can easily set each input control on a widget to be read-only by way of a query string parameter or CMS editable field. We can also load the user responses back into the widget from session state. What we are having an issue with is loading the CMS edited content back into the widget. Is there a way that we can reload a previously viewed widget? Maybe by an id using the Ektron API? We have played around with the WidgetBase.Host object but haven¡¦t been able to make it work. We have also tried saving a whole widget object in to session state and reloading it onto another page but this hasn¡¦t worked also.

@CONTENT:Using UIAccessibilityPostNotification(UIAccessibilityAnnouncementNotification, string); to announce things with VoiceOver. This works great for summaries etc. The problem is in announcing entered/deleted text, VoiceOver uses a deeper tone when echoing the text you enter, and deeper still when you delete text. The documentation mentions no way to control the tone of Voice, is there some unicode character you can put in the string or any argument you can pass to do this?

@TITLE:how to read/assign the elements of a pointer that points to an array of structures in C++
@CONTENT:In iOS core audio there is the API AudioFileWritePackets that has a inPacketDescriptions parameter defined as 'A pointer to an array of packet descriptions for the audio data.' and it looks like this in the method signature: const AudioStreamPacketDescription *inPacketDescriptions, now the struct AudioStreamPacketDescription is defined as follows: struct  AudioStreamPacketDescription
{
    SInt64  mStartOffset;
    UInt32  mVariableFramesInPacket;
    UInt32  mDataByteSize;
};
typedef struct AudioStreamPacketDescription AudioStreamPacketDescription;
 I would like to know how to create and populate such a 'pointer to an array of structs', or even once given the variable, how to read it. Using the speakHere example from apple I put a breakpoint where I receive the variable and tried to dump all its contents to the log.. this is an example of an attempt: void AQRecorder::printPacketDescriptionContents(const AudioStreamPacketDescription * inPacketDescriptions, UInt32 inNumberPackets)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < inNumberPackets; ++i)
    {
        NSLog(@"\n----------------\n");
        NSLog(@"this is packetDescriptionArray[%d].mStartOffset: %lld", i, (*inPacketDescriptions).mStartOffset);
        NSLog(@"this is packetDescriptionArray[%d].mVariableFramesInPacket: %lu", i, (*inPacketDescriptions).mVariableFramesInPacket);
        NSLog(@"this is packetDescriptionArray[%d].mDataByteSize: %lu", i, (*inPacketDescriptions).mDataByteSize);
        NSLog(@"\n----------------\n");   

    }        
}
 any ideas? Update: here is a sample log of me trying to mess around with it.. maybe it can help in the answer (notice at the bottom it keeps on appearing null.. it doesn't make sense that the whole thing is just a pack of zeroes since it's a variable returned by a callback that should be properly populated, also notice that it informs me about the number of packets I got back..).. also if i run the code with ((const AudioStreamPacketDescription *)(inPacketDescriptions +i))->mDataByteSize) i get a EXC_BAD_ACCESS error (lldb) po **(inPacketDescriptions)

        this.hasValue = false;

 Settings.cs (where the ObservableCollection is initialized) public static Setting<ObservableCollection<BrowserItem>> BrowserList = new Setting<ObservableCollection<BrowserItem>>("Browsers", new ObservableCollection<BrowserItem>());
    public static Setting<string> InitialUri = new Setting<string>("InitialUri", "http://www.bing.com");
 In the above class, InitialUri works fine when new values are saved and then used later, but I believe the issue with the ObservableCollection is its type being BrowserItem. I do not know how to make it so BrowserItem will be able to be used in the ObservableCollection to save and retrieve items that are added to the ObservableCollection. An example of adding an item is below TabsPage.xaml.cs void addNew_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        BitmapImage newTileImage = new BitmapImage();

        var newItem = new BrowserItem() { Browser = new FullWebBrowser(), Url = "http://www.bing.com", ImageUri = newTileImage, Title = "new", /*Notification = "",*/ Message = "new browser", GroupTag = "TileGroup", TileName = "new" };

        newItem.Browser.InitialUri = Settings.InitialUri.Value;
        Settings.BrowserList.Value.Add(newItem);
    }
 Items in the ObservableCollection can be used while the application is active, but not once the application is activated once closed?

@TITLE:Setting and canceling alarms with AlarmManager (Android)
@CONTENT:This is a post requesting confirmation (or rebuttal) of what I believe to be happening with alarms in Android. This subject occurs with some frequency in blogs and StackOverflow posts, but I have not found a clear explanation of these two points (below). The code below is intended to set and alarm and then to unset it. It does not work.     Intent intent = new Intent(context, AlarmReceiver.class);
    intent.setAction(AlarmReceiver.ALERT_GUARD_CHECKIN);
    PendingIntent sender = PendingIntent.getBroadcast(context, _id, intent,
            PendingIntent.FLAG_ONE_SHOT);

    AlarmManager am = (AlarmManager) context
            .getSystemService(Context.ALARM_SERVICE);
    am.set(AlarmManager.RTC_WAKEUP, now.getTime().getTime(), sender);

    Intent toCancel = new Intent(context, AlarmReceiver.class);
    toCancel.setAction(AlarmReceiver.ALERT_GUARD_CHECKIN);
    PendingIntent pendingToCancel = PendingIntent.getBroadcast(context,
            _id, toCancel, PendingIntent.FLAG_CANCEL_CURRENT);
    am.cancel(pendingToCancel);
 It does work if, instead of passing PendingIntent.FLAG_ONE_SHOT to the first call of PendingIntent.getBroadast(), I pass zero instead. I do not believe this behavior is documented. The code also does not work if second argument of PendingIntent.getBroadast() (above, _id) are not identical. I do not believe this is documented. In the Android docs the second argument is documented as, "Private request code for the sender (currently not used)." The question is whether I've properly described this behavior, or if these generalizations are of ephiphenomena.
@CODE:Intent intent = new Intent(context, AlarmReceiver.class);
    intent.setAction(AlarmReceiver.ALERT_GUARD_CHECKIN);
    PendingIntent sender = PendingIntent.getBroadcast(context, _id, intent,
            PendingIntent.FLAG_ONE_SHOT);

    AlarmManager am = (AlarmManager) context
            .getSystemService(Context.ALARM_SERVICE);
    am.set(AlarmManager.RTC_WAKEUP, now.getTime().getTime(), sender);

    Intent toCancel = new Intent(context, AlarmReceiver.class);
    toCancel.setAction(AlarmReceiver.ALERT_GUARD_CHECKIN);
    PendingIntent pendingToCancel = PendingIntent.getBroadcast(context,
            _id, toCancel, PendingIntent.FLAG_CANCEL_CURRENT);
    am.cancel(pendingToCancel);

@TITLE:Class Cast Exception When Same Jar is Included in WEB-INF/lib and CLASSPATH
@CONTENT:I have a .jar file added to the CLASSPATH of the JBoss 5 startup (run.bat/run.sh) file. This is a dependency jar which is referred to from the servlet based application. If I use this setup, the servlet loads fine and works as expected. However, I noted that if I have the same jar in the servlet's WEB-INF/lib directory, I get a class cast exception as follows: ERROR [STDERR] ERROR: com.idoox.wasp.ProtocolRepositoryImpl - Exception in protocolHandler soap, protocolHandler com.server.saaj.soap.SOAP11ProtocolHandler, class space root.wasp-impl.SOAP :

ERROR [STDERR] java.lang.ClassCastException: com.server.saaj.soap.SOAP11ProtocolHandler cannot be cast to org.idoox.wasp.ProtocolHandler 
 This is not an issue since I won't have the jar in both places, but I'm just wondering why it is happening this way. Is this a class loading issue? Thank You.

@TITLE:PyQt4 Selected Item Text in QTableView delayed by one click
@CONTENT:I'm using a QTableView to display contents of a QSqlTableModel along with using a QSortFilterProxyModel to filter the records. In the following code I've managed to get the selected text to be displayed when a user clicks the cell (regardless if a filter is applied or not). However, it is always 1 click behind, the first click after start causes an IndexError: pop from empty list and when a new column is selected within the same row nothing happens.

@CONTENT:Does anyone know of an automated way to deploy a web role to Azure with the "Enable Web Deploy" option enabled? We have an automated acceptance test process that deploys to Azure using Web Deploy to save time. But we would also like to automate the full deployment of the web role so that it could run off-hours on a less frequent basis. We are currently using the WAPPSCmdlets module to automate full Azure deployments. However, neither this nor the newer official Azure Powershell cmdlets seem to expose a way to enable Web Deploy in new deployments.

 There might be some kind of timing issue; I captured the partially-enhanced item by writing it to the console, but wrote it BEFORE the call to refresh (which, if I leave the call to refresh out, logs the original unenhanced item). If it matters, the item gets added from a dialog through the onclick property of a button that links back to the page with the list (thus closing the dialog). Thanks in advance for any insights.

@TITLE:Custom Product Option - modify percent-based pricing logic : Magento
@CONTENT:I'm having an real issue with Custom Options that incorporate the "percent" price-type. On Simple products, percent-based custom options work as expected, but on Configurable or Bundled, the final price is determined from the base price, and not the base price + additional options (which is what biz requirements dictate): Config/Bundle Product

base price = $1000
option 1 + $100 
option 2 + 5%
_____________________________
= $1150 (instead of $1155);
 I haven't been able to find much of anything dealing with this otherwise big problem. I did find and implement this Answer, but the $finalPrice returned in Mage_Catalog_Model_Product_Type_Price -> _applyOptionsPrice is not correctly evaluating the baseprice + upcharge of custom options. Additionally, on the front end, in Products.Options the solution is not incorporating the base price in the calculation either. I'm assuming the fix is for prior versions of magento (I'm on v1.11). I suspect the strategy for the fix is correct, but its a highly complex interchange, and I'm not entirely clear what needs to be altered to deal with this issue. Any thoughts would be most welcome. Cheers update I've had a bit of success on the front end (getting the javascript to update option values and pricing correctly).These changes, however are not getting written in to the price model. When the shopping cart goes to render, for example, the final price is incorporating not the fully loaded price, but a percentage of the parent product: Here's what I have on the back end (which is not changing any behavior. I'll note that I've just got them copied into the app/local directory atm, but I'll override them properly once I get this logic worked out. Mage_Catalog_Model_Product_Type_Price     public function getFinalPrice($qty=null, $product)
    {
        //... aggregate tier and special pricing, then apply custom options

        $finalPrice = $product->getData('final_price');
        $finalPrice = $this->_applyOptionsPrice($product, $qty, $finalPrice);

        return max(0, $finalPrice);

The question remains - how do i modify the pricing models to accommodate a percentage based custom option ?? 50 points to someone who can help me work this out. ... Anyone?

@TITLE:3 player card game [duplicate]
@CONTENT:Possible Duplicate: 3 player card game turn system I'm making a GUI 3 player card game (1 human and 2 computers). Each player has 3 cards in hand. In each round there is a dealer and the first player to play a card is the player at the right of the dealer. Each player can only play after the left player has played. (It's the basis of a card game) After each player had put the 3 cards on the table. The dealer button passes to the player at the right and a new round begin. I need help to do a function to control the turns, which can see whose turn it is to play. I it is human turn, it waits for input. If it is computer turn, it calls the action function of the calss. What I have now is a Card class with a Suit and a Value. A Deck class that is a list of Cards ( this class has a suffle function and a draw card function) I have a Table class that had a list of cards ( that is where the cards go when a player plays them) I have a Player class ( the same class is for human and computer player - is this good? ) The Player class have a Hand class ( thats where the 3 cards of the player are ) The Game class has one deck, one table and 3 players. I have the function that the human is the first to play and moves one card to the table, then the 2 computer players move one card each. This only works if the human player is the first to play. Once the 3 cards of each player are played, begins another round, in this round is not the player but the computer to first play. I don't have the idea how to make one system to control this. I don't want code, but the idea itself. Thanks

 Basically, we are creating a Zend\Mvc\Application environment. My PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase is enclosed in a custom class, which goes like this: abstract class ControllerTestCase extends TestCase

    protected $controllerFQDN;

    /**
     * The route to the controller, as defined in the configuration files
     *
     * @var string
     */
    protected $controllerRoute;

    public function setup()
    {
        parent::setup();

        $di = \Bootstrap::getDi();

        // Create a Controller and set some properties
        $this->controller = $di->newInstance($this->controllerFQDN);

        $this->request    = new Request();
        $this->routeMatch = new RouteMatch(array('controller' => $this->controllerRoute));
        $this->event      = new MvcEvent();

        $this->event->setRouteMatch($this->routeMatch);

        $this->controller->setEvent($this->event);
        $this->controller->setServiceLocator(\Bootstrap::getServiceManager());
    }

    public function tearDown()
    {

        unset($this->request);
        unset($this->routeMatch);
        unset($this->event);
    }
}
 And we create a Controller instance and a Request with a RouteMatch. The code for the test: public function testEditActionWithGetRequest()
{
    // Dispatch the edit action
    $this->routeMatch->setParam('action', 'edit');
    $this->routeMatch->setParam('id', $album->id);
    $result = $this->controller->dispatch($this->request, $this->response);

    // rest of the code isn't executed
}
 I'm not sure what I'm missing here. Can it be any configuration for the testing bootstrap? Or should I pass the parameters in some other way? Or am I forgetting to instantiate something?

@TITLE:Core Data: why I can't fetch anything with my predicate
@CONTENT:Is there something wrong with the code? I can fetch nothing using this predicate. Comment out the predicate then I can fetch all objects from entity "BankDetail". So I think problem resides in these two lines. // self.bankInfo.name is set in prepareForSegue in first view controller
NSPredicate *predicate = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@"info.name = %@",self.bankInfo.name];
[request setPredicate:predicate];
 My model includes two entities, which are in one-to-one relationship BankInfo.h @class BankDetail;

@property (nonatomic, retain) NSString * name;

@property (nonatomic, retain) NSString * updateDate;
@property (nonatomic, retain) NSString * zip;
@property (nonatomic, retain) NSString * acquiringInstitution;
@property (nonatomic, retain) BankInfo * info;

@end
 EDIT: To provide more detail: self.bankInfo.name is definitely set, I NSLog it right before the line of predicate And I do this in viewDidLoad: NSEntityDescription *entity = [NSEntityDescription entityForName:@"BankDetail" inManagedObjectContext:context];
NSLog(@"[entity description] is %@",[entity description]);
 Get this in console: info = "(<NSRelationshipDescription: 0x6d3eb30>), name info, isOptional 1, isTransient 0, entity BankDetail, renamingIdentifier info, validation predicates (\n), warnings (\n), versionHashModifier (null)\n userInfo {\n}, destination entity BankInfo, inverseRelationship detail, minCount 1, maxCount 1, isOrdered 0, deleteRule 2";
 EDIT2: Turn out there's nothing wrong with the predicate. The bug is caused by a careless mistake elsewhere (see the accepted answer, it's about renaming). Please IGNORE this post if you have question about predicate.

@TITLE:Most efficient matrix multiplication in C using fork() and IPC
@CONTENT:I need to implement concurrent matrix multiplication in C using multiple processes. I understand that because each process has its own private address space, I will have to use some form of interprocess communication (IPC). I did some looking around and couldn't find many implementations that didn't use threads. I was wondering if anyone knew the most best way to go about this, either using shared memory, message passing, or pipes? I am not asking for a solution, but rather, if anyone knows, which of these methods will be more efficient with matrix multiplication. Or if there is a common standard way to do this with multiple processes?

@CONTENT:I have an application that is wired with Spring 3.1 authentication. I have some pages which makes AJAX requests to show some information on the dialog. Now, if the user's session has timed out, the Spring redirects to the login page. I don't want an AJAX based login page. I would like the user to be navigated to the login page entirely, by canceling current operation. Once user logs in, navigate user back to the last page where he was (from where the AJAX request was made). The redirection stuff works fine if the request is made from a page.

@CONTENT:I've got a postgresql-query that returns 120 rows {integer, boolean, integer, varchar(255), varchar(255), bigint, text} in about 70ms when done in the database running psql. Using python/django with django.db.connection.cursor.execute() it takes 10s to run, on the same machine. I've tried putting all the rows into an array, and a single string (18k characters, but returning only the first 500 takes the same time) so there is only one row returned but with no gain. Any ideas as to why there is such a dramatic slowdown in running a query from within python and in the db? EDIT I had to increase the work_mem to get the function running timely in psql. Other functions/queries don't show the same pattern, the difference between psql and python is only a few milliseconds. EDIT Cutting down the work_mem to 1MB shows similar numbers in psql and the django shell. Could it be that django is not going by the memory set in work_mem? EDIT Ugh. The problem was that the work_mem set in psql is not valid globally, if I set the memory in the function, the call is timely. I suppose setting this in the configuration file would work globally.

@CONTENT:I was debating a few methods for emulating a "Price is Right" type wheel or style UIPicker functionality. That said I do not need the whole dialog and color schemes from a UIPicker plugin. I just need to be able to animate through a couple images to replicate the spinning of a wheel. As an example lets say this is my list: 1984 1985 1987 1990 1994 and Lets say that these numbers are on screen: 1985 1987 1990 and when the user clicks 1990 the list slides up taking 1985 off screen while 1994 comes on screen. Leaving us with: 1987 1990 1994 Then when the user clicks 1994 the list slides up again and 1987 leaves the screen and 1984 comes on to the screen. Alternatively the list could slide down as well... So what would be the preferred way to accomplish this? I've debated an infinite scroller and a set of oversized images (that would be inside a smaller div to limit it's onscreen section) for each combination that could slide up/down and then swap out for the new combination and to be ready for the next selection.

@TITLE:Cache password for SQL Server connection as a hash
@CONTENT:I'm writing a .NET 4.0 application that requires access to a SQL Server (v10.50.1600) database on the intranet. The database does not support integrated security/SSPI logins, only user/password logins. The best I've managed so far is: SqlConnectionStringBuilder builder = new SqlConnectionStringBuilder()
{
   DataSource = Settings.SQLHostName,
   Encrypt = true,
   TrustServerCertificate = true,
   UserID = Settings.SQLUser,
   Password = "xxx",
   InitialCatalog = "xxx"
};
 However, this requires that I store and manipulate a plain-text password locally, something that I want to avoid. Is there a way to give ADO, LINQ, or the Entity Framework, etc. a password hash instead of a password to connect to a SQL Server? Whereas encrypted storage for connection strings is better than nothing, it eventually needs to be decrypted before use. Since the rationale behind not having a bindable content property on WPF password boxes is apparently that keeping plaintext passwords in memory is a bad idea, any sort of connection string decryption before use sounds ill-advised. The ideal alternative would be understanding how SQL server stores and transmits its password digests; applying the same digest algorithm locally; and then sending the digest instead of the plaintext password. Unfortunately, it seems that the TDS7 password encoding described in part here: http://dbaspot.com/ms-sqlserver/210567-tds7-8-login-packets.html seems to not use any digest algorithm at all. So I'm probably stuck with podiluska's answer below.

When I look at the MySQL process monitor, I see that three of them will always have a time of 0, then 2 of them that I use to actually insert data into the database will have values that are always counting up, and never get reset to 0 meaning that eventually they encounter the dreaded 'MySQL has gone away'. I am using MySQLdb. Can someone please explain why this happens? Is there a way to make sure that they reset this value to 0? Thanks

@TITLE:PHP parent & subclass DB operations
@CONTENT:New to PHP & OOP so bear with me... I'm in the optimistic early stages of designing and writing my first PHP & OOP website after a lifetime of writing crappy M$ VBA rubbish. I have a class "User" which has a save method with the relevant database calls etc... (actually I have DB and DBUtils classes that handles the connection and CRUD - my business classes just call select, update, delete methods on DB Utils and pass associative arrays of data) Anywho... My "User" class is extended by an "Admin" class which has some additional properties over and above "User" yada yada... What is the best way to deal with the save method on "Admin"? I understand that if I add a save method to the Admin class it will supercede the one on User but I don't want it to. I want to write the save method on Admin to only deal with the properties etc that are specific to the Admin objects and for the properties inherited from "User" to be dealt with in the User save method. Does that make sense? Is it a specific OOP pattern I'm looking for? Any help or guidance with how I should design and structure this code would be appreciated. EDIT: Whoa! Thanks for all the answers below. Not sure which is my preferred yet. I will have to do some playing around...

@LINK:/questions/12572531/custom-product-option-modify-percent-based-pricing-logic-magento
@TITLE:Custom Product Option - modify percent-based pricing logic : Magento
@CONTENT:I'm having an real issue with Custom Options that incorporate the "percent" price-type. On Simple products, percent-based custom options work as expected, but on Configurable or Bundled, the final price is determined from the base price, and not the base price + additional options (which is what biz requirements dictate): Config/Bundle Product

base price = $1000
option 1 + $100 
option 2 + 5%
_____________________________
= $1150 (instead of $1155);
 I haven't been able to find much of anything dealing with this otherwise big problem. I did find and implement this Answer, but the $finalPrice returned in Mage_Catalog_Model_Product_Type_Price -> _applyOptionsPrice is not correctly evaluating the baseprice + upcharge of custom options. Additionally, on the front end, in Products.Options the solution is not incorporating the base price in the calculation either. I'm assuming the fix is for prior versions of magento (I'm on v1.11). I suspect the strategy for the fix is correct, but its a highly complex interchange, and I'm not entirely clear what needs to be altered to deal with this issue. Any thoughts would be most welcome. Cheers update I've had a bit of success on the front end (getting the javascript to update option values and pricing correctly).These changes, however are not getting written in to the price model. When the shopping cart goes to render, for example, the final price is incorporating not the fully loaded price, but a percentage of the parent product: Here's what I have on the back end (which is not changing any behavior. I'll note that I've just got them copied into the app/local directory atm, but I'll override them properly once I get this logic worked out. Mage_Catalog_Model_Product_Type_Price     public function getFinalPrice($qty=null, $product)
    {
        //... aggregate tier and special pricing, then apply custom options

        $finalPrice = $product->getData('final_price');
        $finalPrice = $this->_applyOptionsPrice($product, $qty, $finalPrice);

        return max(0, $finalPrice);
    }

    protected function _applyOptionsPrice($product, $qty, $finalPrice)
    {
        if ($optionIds = $product->getCustomOption('option_ids')) {
            $basePrice = $finalPrice;
            foreach (explode(',', $optionIds->getValue()) as $optionId) {
                if ($option = $product->getOptionById($optionId)) {

                    $confItemOption = $product->getCustomOption('option_'.$option->getId());
                    $group = $option->groupFactory($option->getType())
                        ->setOption($option)
                        ->setConfigurationItemOption($confItemOption);
                    // grab option value based on finalprice 
                    $finalPrice += $group->getOptionPrice($confItemOption->getValue(), $finalPrice);
                }
            };
        }

        Mage::log('base price :'.$basePrice.'  final price :'.$finalPrice); 

        return $finalPrice;
    }
 As far as I can tell, in Mage_Catalog_Model_Product_Type_Configurable_Price, and Mage_Catalog_Model_Product_Type_Grouped_Price, there is nothing to override, because they each call on the Parent::getFinalPrice to determine values at each step... The question remains - how do i modify the pricing models to accommodate a percentage based custom option ?? 50 points to someone who can help me work this out. ... Anyone?

@TITLE:onbeforeunload and onunload getting one to work after the other
@CONTENT:I am having some trouble with the on before unload and the unload method. I thought i set the code right in terms of the onload method only firing up after the confirm method for onbeforeunload was set a true. but sadly that isn't the case, what is happening is the unload method is starting even if the onbeforeunload method is set to false and the person wants to stay at the website. Here is the code I am working on it has changed a lot since I started hope its okay. I am sure it isn't since its not working the way I want it to.  var validNavigation = false;

 function wireUpEvents() {

     var leave_message = 'Leaving the page ?';

        jQuery(function goodbye() {
jQuery(window).bind('onbeforeunload', function() {
    setTimeout(function() {

        }, 10000);

@TITLE:3 player card game [duplicate]
@CONTENT:Possible Duplicate: 3 player card game turn system I'm making a GUI 3 player card game (1 human and 2 computers). Each player has 3 cards in hand. In each round there is a dealer and the first player to play a card is the player at the right of the dealer. Each player can only play after the left player has played. (It's the basis of a card game) After each player had put the 3 cards on the table. The dealer button passes to the player at the right and a new round begin. I need help to do a function to control the turns, which can see whose turn it is to play. I it is human turn, it waits for input. If it is computer turn, it calls the action function of the calss. What I have now is a Card class with a Suit and a Value. A Deck class that is a list of Cards ( this class has a suffle function and a draw card function) I have a Table class that had a list of cards ( that is where the cards go when a player plays them) I have a Player class ( the same class is for human and computer player - is this good? ) The Player class have a Hand class ( thats where the 3 cards of the player are ) The Game class has one deck, one table and 3 players. I have the function that the human is the first to play and moves one card to the table, then the 2 computer players move one card each. This only works if the human player is the first to play. Once the 3 cards of each player are played, begins another round, in this round is not the player but the computer to first play. I don't have the idea how to make one system to control this. I don't want code, but the idea itself. Thanks

     *
     * @var string
     */
    protected $controllerRoute;

    public function setup()
    {
        parent::setup();

        $di = \Bootstrap::getDi();

        // Create a Controller and set some properties

        $this->routeMatch = new RouteMatch(array('controller' => $this->controllerRoute));
        $this->event      = new MvcEvent();

        $this->event->setRouteMatch($this->routeMatch);

        $this->controller->setEvent($this->event);
        $this->controller->setServiceLocator(\Bootstrap::getServiceManager());
    }

    public function tearDown()
    {

        unset($this->request);
        unset($this->routeMatch);
        unset($this->event);
    }
}
 And we create a Controller instance and a Request with a RouteMatch. The code for the test: public function testEditActionWithGetRequest()
{
    // Dispatch the edit action
    $this->routeMatch->setParam('action', 'edit');
    $this->routeMatch->setParam('id', $album->id);
    $result = $this->controller->dispatch($this->request, $this->response);

    // rest of the code isn't executed
}
 I'm not sure what I'm missing here. Can it be any configuration for the testing bootstrap? Or should I pass the parameters in some other way? Or am I forgetting to instantiate something?

@TITLE:Core Data: why I can't fetch anything with my predicate
@CONTENT:Is there something wrong with the code? I can fetch nothing using this predicate. Comment out the predicate then I can fetch all objects from entity "BankDetail". So I think problem resides in these two lines. // self.bankInfo.name is set in prepareForSegue in first view controller
NSPredicate *predicate = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@"info.name = %@",self.bankInfo.name];
[request setPredicate:predicate];
 My model includes two entities, which are in one-to-one relationship BankInfo.h @class BankDetail;

@interface BankInfo : NSManagedObject

@property (nonatomic, retain) NSString * city;
@property (nonatomic, retain) NSString * name;
@property (nonatomic, retain) NSString * state;

@property (nonatomic, retain) NSString * updateDate;
@property (nonatomic, retain) NSString * zip;
@property (nonatomic, retain) NSString * acquiringInstitution;
@property (nonatomic, retain) BankInfo * info;

@end
 EDIT: To provide more detail: self.bankInfo.name is definitely set, I NSLog it right before the line of predicate And I do this in viewDidLoad: NSEntityDescription *entity = [NSEntityDescription entityForName:@"BankDetail" inManagedObjectContext:context];
NSLog(@"[entity description] is %@",[entity description]);
 Get this in console: info = "(<NSRelationshipDescription: 0x6d3eb30>), name info, isOptional 1, isTransient 0, entity BankDetail, renamingIdentifier info, validation predicates (\n), warnings (\n), versionHashModifier (null)\n userInfo {\n}, destination entity BankInfo, inverseRelationship detail, minCount 1, maxCount 1, isOrdered 0, deleteRule 2";
 EDIT2: Turn out there's nothing wrong with the predicate. The bug is caused by a careless mistake elsewhere (see the accepted answer, it's about renaming). Please IGNORE this post if you have question about predicate.

I was wondering if anyone knew the most best way to go about this, either using shared memory, message passing, or pipes? I am not asking for a solution, but rather, if anyone knows, which of these methods will be more efficient with matrix multiplication.

@TITLE:Django cursor.execute(QUERY) much slower than running the query in the postgres database
@CONTENT:I've got a postgresql-query that returns 120 rows {integer, boolean, integer, varchar(255), varchar(255), bigint, text} in about 70ms when done in the database running psql. Using python/django with django.db.connection.cursor.execute() it takes 10s to run, on the same machine. I've tried putting all the rows into an array, and a single string (18k characters, but returning only the first 500 takes the same time) so there is only one row returned but with no gain. Any ideas as to why there is such a dramatic slowdown in running a query from within python and in the db? EDIT I had to increase the work_mem to get the function running timely in psql. Other functions/queries don't show the same pattern, the difference between psql and python is only a few milliseconds. EDIT Cutting down the work_mem to 1MB shows similar numbers in psql and the django shell. Could it be that django is not going by the memory set in work_mem? EDIT Ugh. The problem was that the work_mem set in psql is not valid globally, if I set the memory in the function, the call is timely. I suppose setting this in the configuration file would work globally.

@TITLE:JavaScript - Emulating A Wheel/UIPicker
@CONTENT:I was debating a few methods for emulating a "Price is Right" type wheel or style UIPicker functionality. That said I do not need the whole dialog and color schemes from a UIPicker plugin. I just need to be able to animate through a couple images to replicate the spinning of a wheel. As an example lets say this is my list: 1984 1985 1987 1990 1994 and Lets say that these numbers are on screen: 1985 1987 1990 and when the user clicks 1990 the list slides up taking 1985 off screen while 1994 comes on screen. Leaving us with: 1987 1990 1994 Then when the user clicks 1994 the list slides up again and 1987 leaves the screen and 1984 comes on to the screen. Alternatively the list could slide down as well... So what would be the preferred way to accomplish this? I've debated an infinite scroller and a set of oversized images (that would be inside a smaller div to limit it's onscreen section) for each combination that could slide up/down and then swap out for the new combination and to be ready for the next selection.

@LINK:/questions/12567519/cache-password-for-sql-server-connection-as-a-hash
@TITLE:Cache password for SQL Server connection as a hash
@CONTENT:I'm writing a .NET 4.0 application that requires access to a SQL Server (v10.50.1600) database on the intranet. The database does not support integrated security/SSPI logins, only user/password logins. The best I've managed so far is: SqlConnectionStringBuilder builder = new SqlConnectionStringBuilder()
{
   DataSource = Settings.SQLHostName,
   Encrypt = true,
   TrustServerCertificate = true,
   UserID = Settings.SQLUser,
   Password = "xxx",
   InitialCatalog = "xxx"
};
 However, this requires that I store and manipulate a plain-text password locally, something that I want to avoid. Is there a way to give ADO, LINQ, or the Entity Framework, etc. a password hash instead of a password to connect to a SQL Server? Whereas encrypted storage for connection strings is better than nothing, it eventually needs to be decrypted before use. Since the rationale behind not having a bindable content property on WPF password boxes is apparently that keeping plaintext passwords in memory is a bad idea, any sort of connection string decryption before use sounds ill-advised. The ideal alternative would be understanding how SQL server stores and transmits its password digests; applying the same digest algorithm locally; and then sending the digest instead of the plaintext password. Unfortunately, it seems that the TDS7 password encoding described in part here: http://dbaspot.com/ms-sqlserver/210567-tds7-8-login-packets.html seems to not use any digest algorithm at all. So I'm probably stuck with podiluska's answer below.

 That almost worked in Firefox but Chrome didn't even want to display it, instead it showed some weird font with completely random size that had nothing to do with the css entered. Then I tried this: @media screen and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio:0) {

It returned something like this GDataEntryYouTubePlaylistLink 0x888ea20: {v:2.1 title:Playlist Title summary: contentSrc:https://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/playlists/PL5......92D127 etag:W/"D04N.....WhJVEU8." authors:1 categories:1 links:related,alternate,self id:tag:youtube.com,2008:user:MyYoutubeUser:playlist:PL5......92D127 countHint:7 unparsed:<media:group>} I've learned that countHint is the number of videos on that playlist. Now, I want to get those videos. I tried creating a function that would do so, but I don't know what FeedID I'll use:     GDataServiceGoogleYouTube *service = [self youTubeService];

NSString *feedID = kGDataYouTubeUserFeedIDPlaylists; //this was the feedID i used to get the list of playlist of a user
NSURL *feedURL = [GDataServiceGoogleYouTube youTubeURLForUserID:@"MyYoutubeUser"
                                                        userFeedID:feedID];

[service fetchFeedWithURL:feedURL
                 delegate:self
        didFinishSelector:@selector(request:finishedLoading:error:)];

@TITLE:How to set library dependencies on CMake library OBJECTs?
@CONTENT:I currently have a setup of CMake and GTest that works on Windows and MSVC++ just fine. I am bypassing GTest's own build system in favour of, # compile Google Test as an object library
add_library(gtest OBJECT "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/gtest-1.6.0/src/gtest-all.cc")
set_property(TARGET gtest PROPERTY INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
    "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/gtest-1.6.0"
    "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/gtest-1.6.0/include")
 The problem is that on Linux (Ubuntu 12.04 x64 if that is relevant) this gives me linker errors due to missing pthread_*. I want any target that links to gtest or gtest_main to automatically link to pthread as well. Is there a way to do this? I was looking for a relevant property but cannot seem to find it.

@LINK:/questions/12549152/using-sed-to-transform-a-c-struct-and-typedef
@TITLE:Using sed to transform a C struct and typedef
@CONTENT:I have a couple structure definitions in my input code. For example: struct node {
   int val;
   struct node *next;
};
 or typedef struct {
   int numer;
   int denom;
} Rational;
 I used the following line to convert them into one line and copy it twice. sed '/struct[^(){]*{/{:l N;s/\n//;/}[^}]*;/!t l;s/  */ /g;p;p}'
 the result is this: struct node { int val; struct node *next;};
struct node { int val; struct node *next;};
struct node { int val; struct node *next;};

typedef struct { int numer; int denom;} Rational;
typedef struct { int numer; int denom;} Rational;
typedef struct { int numer; int denom;} Rational;
 This is what I want: I would like the first line to be restored to the original structure block I would like the second line to turn into to a function heading that looks like this... void init_structName( structName *var, int data1, int data2 ) 
 -structName is basically the name of the structure. -var is any name you like. -data1, data2.... are values that are in the struct. 3.I would like the third line to turn into to the function body. Where I initialize the the data parameters. It would look like this.     {
        var->data1 = data1;
        var->data2 = data2;
    }
 Keep in mind that ALL my struct definitions in the input file are placed in one line and copied three times. So when the code finds a structure defintion it can assume that there will be two more copies below. For example, this is the output I want if the input file had the repeating lines shown above. struct node {
   int val;
   struct node *next;
};
void init_node(struct node *var, int val, struct node *next)
{
var->val = val;
var->next =  next;
}

typedef struct {
   int numer;
   int denom;
} Rational;
void init_Rational( Rational *var, int numer, int denom ) 
{
   var->numer = numer;
   var->denom = denom;
}
 In case someone was curious. These functions will be called from the main function to initialize the struct variables. Can someone help? I realize this is kind of tough. Thanks so much!!

 This only happens in my production Appengine instance, (ie. not on dev server), and it only happens for the email address that I use for testing on both dev and production. My working hypothesis is that it is something to do with the user being granted a refresh-token on the dev server which is somehow interfering with the stored refresh-token on the prod server. Can anybody confirm this explanation, and is there a best practice on how to deal with this exception?

@LINK:/questions/12547823/preventing-subclasses-overriding-methods
@TITLE:Preventing subclasses overriding methods
@CONTENT:Assume there is an object that initialises like so - (void)doInit
{
    NSLog(@"In BaseClass init");
}

- (id)init
{
    self = [super init];
    [self doInit];

    return self;
}
 and it has a subclass which is inited in a similar way - (void)doInit
{
    NSLog (@"In SubClass init");
}

- (id)init
{
    self = [super init];
    [self doInit];

    return self;
}
 Now if I create an instance of child class then I receive the following output: In SubClass init
In SubClass init
 when really, what I meant to happen is In BaseClass init
In SubClass init
 Is there a way to mark doInit to say that it shouldn't be overridden or do I need to create a unique name for all methods in a subclass? I'm not entirely sure how I haven't come across this issue before, but there you go. Edit: I understand why this is happening, I hadn't expected that the base class would be able to call the overridden function. I also can't just call [super doInit]; from the Subclass method because the BaseClass still needs to call doInit so that creating an instance of BaseClass will still work. If I called [super doInit], I'd still end up getting SubClass's doInit called twice. It appears the answer is no and I'll just have to uniquely name each doInit like doBaseClassInit and doSubClassInit.
@CODE:- (void)doInit
{
    NSLog(@"In BaseClass init");
}

- (id)init
{
    self = [super init];
    [self doInit];

    return self;
} - (void)doInit
{
    NSLog (@"In SubClass init");
}

- (id)init

    self = [super init];
    [self doInit];

    return self;
} In SubClass init

@TITLE:How to draw a simple ruler with JavaScript?
@CONTENT:I'm starting with PhoneGap, and I'm trying a simple application, a Ruler. I'm a begginer in JavaScript, most of my mobile work was in native Android code, but I'm cracking my head on this and I can't figure out what's wrong. Due to different sizes of screens my idea is to calculate how many pixels I have in one millimeter(pixelsInMm) get the height of the screen and using a HTML5 canvas draw a line every N pixels. The body of my HTML is simple enough, a canvas filling the whole screen   <body onload="init();" id="stage" class="theme">     
  <canvas id="myCanvas" style="width: 100%;height: 100%;"></canvas>
  </body>
 I've already figured out how to get the density in pixels per inch of the device(dpi) and using simple math we can get how many pixels we have in one cm var mmInInch = 25.399999999972568;
function getPixelsPerMillimeter(dpi){
    return dpi/mmInInch;        
}
 And the rest of my js file is also straightforward var heightInPixels;
var heightDensity;
 Get the height density in pixels per inch function getDeviceResolution(){
    heightDensity = window.MyConnectorClass.getYdpi();
    heightInPixels = window.outerHeight;
    console.log("Y density = " + heightDensity);
    console.log("Y pixels = " + heightInPixels);
    return heightDensity;
}
 Draw a horizontal line in the given canvas and y coordinate function drawOnCanvas(ctx2d,y){
    console.log("Drawing on :" + y)     
    ctx2d.moveTo(0,y);
    ctx2d.lineTo(20,y);
    ctx2d.stroke();
}
 My main loop, where at every ppm it draw one horizontal line. function drawRuler(){
    console.log("append Ruler")         
    var YDpi = getDeviceResolution();
    var ppm = getPixelsPerMillimeter(YDpi);
    var c=document.getElementById("myCanvas");
    var ctx=c.getContext("2d");
    ctx.lineWidth = 1;
    for(var i=0; i<90; i++){         
      var topPos = (5+ i*ppm);
      console.log("topPos" + topPos);
      drawOnCanvas(ctx,topPos);     
    };
}
 But instead of getting the expected ruler, as you can see in the image below what I'm getting are lines very spaced, far from the 1mm I expected. Why? Also the lines it draws have different sizes, and they are definetelly not 1px wide. Here is the logcat showing that the calculations are right, I'm testing this in a galaxy S2 with 800px Height, with 93mm screen height, So every 8.6 pixels I have one mm. 09-22 \n:16.530: D/test(12353): ppm:8.602150744349842

@TITLE:Inserting a (g) node in the middle of a tree (SVG) using jQuery
@CONTENT:What is the most recommended/efficient way to insert a node in the middle of a tree. How to transpose this <svg id="root" ... >
  <g id="child1">...</g>
  <text id="child2">...</text>
  <rect id="child3">...</rect>
  ...
</svg>
 to this <svg id="root" ... >
  <g id="parent">
    <g id="child1">...</g>
    <text id="child2">...</text>
    <rect id="child3">...</rect>
    ...
  </g>
</svg>
 @jsFiddle I have tried var $parent = $("g").attr("id","parent");
var $root = $("#root");
$root.contents().each(function(){
   $child=$(this);
   $child.remove();
   $parent.append($child);
});
$root.append($parent);
 I have also tried using the moveTo method in this answer (function($){
    $.fn.moveTo = function(selector){
        return this.each(function(){
            var cl = $(this).clone();
            $(cl).appendTo(selector);
            $(this).remove();
        });
    };
})(jQuery);

$root.contents().each(function() {
    $(this).moveTo($parent);
});
 All of these methods work in simple scenarios but when the tree is really massive, the browser simply hangs, is there a more efficient way to perform this? I am looking for a jQuery or pure javascript solution.
@CODE:<svg id="root" ... >
  <g id="child1">...</g>
  <text id="child2">...</text>
  <rect id="child3">...</rect>
  ...
</svg> <svg id="root" ... >
  <g id="parent">
    <g id="child1">...</g>
    <text id="child2">...</text>
    <rect id="child3">...</rect>
    ...
  </g>
</svg> var $parent = $("g").attr("id","parent");
var $root = $("#root");
$root.contents().each(function(){
   $child=$(this);
   $child.remove();
   $parent.append($child);
});
$root.append($parent); (function($){
    $.fn.moveTo = function(selector){
        return this.each(function(){
            var cl = $(this).clone();
            $(cl).appendTo(selector);
            $(this).remove();
        });
    };
})(jQuery);

$root.contents().each(function() {
    $(this).moveTo($parent);
});

@LINK:/questions/12546174/why-is-context-different-in-these-two-event-handlers
@TITLE:Why is context different in these two event handlers
@CONTENT:This is a basics question but I cannot figure out why the context ( the 'this' pointer ) is correct in the second event handler and incorrect in the first one. I have this simple constructor function to create the object myNotifier: function Notifier ( message ) {
  this.message = message;
  this.saySomething = function () {
    alert( "I say:" + this.message);
  }
}

myNotifier = new Notifier(" HELLO!");  
 Then I use the myNotifier.saySomething() method as an event handler for CLICK on two buttons: $(".button1").click( myNotifier.saySomething );
$(".button2").click( function () { myNotifier.saySomething()});
 The first one shows: "I say: undefined" The second one shows: "I say: HELLO" I understand that the context (this )is not the original object when calling the method, but why is it correct when calling inside a function for the second button? A jsfiddle to test
@CODE:function Notifier ( message ) {
  this.message = message;
  this.saySomething = function () {
    alert( "I say:" + this.message);
  }
}

myNotifier = new Notifier(" HELLO!"); myNotifier.saySomething() $(".button1").click( myNotifier.saySomething );
$(".button2").click( function () { myNotifier.saySomething()});

@TITLE:How to debug a WCF service?
@CONTENT:I have a WCF Restful service hosted in my windows application. The clients to the service are mobile applications. The clients call the service and messages are passed to the application and work is executed. The issue that i am facing is that the application works fine in most of the cases. But it doesnt work on some machines and network settings. To give a better idea : The app is not working on machine 1 connected to router A. Now as i change and connect it to router B, the same app starts working on the same machine. Similarly, the app is not working on machine1 connected to router A. Now as i change the machine and remain connected to the same router, the app works fine. I am not able to figure out the problem. Any idea on how to debug this issue? Any help appreciated.

@TITLE:Select Word under mouse pointer in Qt
@CONTENT:I need to highlight and get the word under the mouse pointer when i press the right click in a QTextBrowser. I already implemented the showContextMenu function for the QTextBrowser for the right mouse click thing. However i can't highlight the word under the mouse pointer and extract it. I found the following solution online: QTextCursor tc = txtBrwsr->textCursor();
tc.select(QTextCursor::WordUnderCursor);
QString word = tc.selectedText();
 However, it is not working and the word is empty, my aim behind this is to get the word and highlight it even if the user didn't highlight the word before pressing the right mouse click. Any help is appreciated.
@CODE:QTextCursor tc = txtBrwsr->textCursor();
tc.select(QTextCursor::WordUnderCursor);
QString word = tc.selectedText(); txtBrwsr->setTextCursor(tc); tc.select(...)

@TITLE:Why ThreadPoolExecutor finalize invokes shutdown and not shutdownNow
@CONTENT:Finalize method in class ThreadPoolExecutor Looks like below. protected void finalize()  {
    shutdown();
}
 Consider below program in which thread never terminates ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
    executorService.submit(new Runnable() {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            try {
                new SynchronousQueue<String>()
                        .put("will never get removed");
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    });
    executorService = null;
    System.gc();

}
 In such case shutdownNow would have been better choice than shutdown at least JVM could have exited in that case. Update: Only possible explanation of why finalize calls shutdown method is if programmer does not call it explicitly it will get called while GC as a defensive mechanism. I see flaw in this mechanism since in above case JVM will not be terminated.
@CODE:ThreadPoolExecutor protected void finalize()  {
    shutdown();
} ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
    executorService.submit(new Runnable() {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            try {
                new SynchronousQueue<String>()
                        .put("will never get removed");
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    });
    executorService = null;

@CONTENT:I am facing some problem with POST method in form . I have a page A with a form with POST method and when i submit form it goes to page b . Now problem is that when i do a refresh it pop ups a alert which i don't want to come . I am using HTML and Javascript. Is there any way to handle this refresh? One way that i can think of is to dynamically create a hidden form on page b with the values populated in fields and for every refresh it just submits that hidden form . Please suggest and let me know if there is some other neat work around. Thanks in advance! Basically i am using CGIDEV2 on AS400 platform . So when input form on page a is submitted it call abc.pgm which writes page b. Cgidev2 writes html in sections . It will write /TOP section then /REFRESHFORM. and these values will be populated in abc.pgm . PAGE a

 I have two menu types, one that changes report type and the other that changes the report data (based on entity Id). My include pages have preRenderEvent to take care of updates based on changes to entityId using the top selectOneMenu. Here is the code for one of my include xhtml <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"

 <div>
 <p:panel header="Send a New Note  for #{mainBean.selectedEntity.name}" id="notePanel" toggleable="TRUE" collapsed="FALSE" >    
...
</p:panel>
</div>
 </h:body>
 My problem is that the preRenderView event in the include files is not fired. They are not fired even for the first time when the page is displayed. I am not sure if this is because ui:include is happening thru ajax request. I presume page load kind of events are not fired when ajax updates happen. I am not able to use actionEvent against menu items as the page needs to be updating itself based on entity selection. Hence the only way is to fire the event preRenderView event. Please let me know If there is something wrong with the way I am trying to get the preRenderView event to fire from a ui:include file. Is there any other way to make the report update to work?

 As you see, there are a lot of tests here. What I need to do is to handle any error in each test and to get the information about the error without modifying the body of a test method. So in JUnit there is an interface called TestListener which allows to handle any test error, see the error message, see the name of the test, etc. I didn't find something similar in NUnit. Does it exist? Or is there is a way to do it?

@TITLE:Python3: How can I find out what version of GTK+ I am using?
@CONTENT:I need to find out what version of GTK+ I am using. The problem is there seem to be so many different version numbers involved I am not sure which ones are most relevant. My system is Ubuntu 12.04 and comes as standard with libgtk2.0-0, but when I installed my Python 3.2 development environment I also installed a number of other packages to bind to GTK3. Most of the time this all 'just works', but I want to implement something that (in devhelp) is only available in Version 3.2 of GTK. Needless to say, my reason for asking is that Python cannot find the method in the API. So, now I am wondering what (if anything) I can do about it, but first I need to find out exactly what I have got on my system. This question seems to point in the right direction, but it is four years out of date. Does anyone have any more recent information that could help? EDIT: Thanks to @ptomato and @Pablo for their helpful answers. My problem now is how to make sense of the different hieroglyphics that come out. The dpkg output gives (among other things) the following bob@bobStudio:~$ dpkg -l libgtk* | grep ^i
ii  libgtk-3-0                             3.4.2-0ubuntu0.4                        GTK+     graphical user interface library
ii  libgtk-3-bin                           3.4.2-0ubuntu0.4                           programs for the GTK+ graphical user interface library

[etc....]
 while in the Python3 shell I get the following >>> from gi.repository import Gtk
>>> Gtk.MAJOR_VERSION, Gtk.MINOR_VERSION, Gtk.MICRO_VERSION
(3, 4, 2)
 If I read this correctly (I am not sure I am) this means I am using GTK+ version 3.4.2, but there is some doubt because of the number on the libraries, viz, libgtk-3-0. Also, if I am using 3.4.2, why is a method labelled as being available in 3.2 not present? Can someone explain what the different numbers mean? EDIT2: To be more specific, the method I am investigating is Gtk.Grid().get_child_at(). From the DevHelp GTK+ manual, gtk_grid_get_child_at ()

GtkWidget *         gtk_grid_get_child_at               (GtkGrid *grid,
                                                         gint left,
                                                         gint top);
Gets the child of grid whose area covers the grid cell whose upper left corner is at left, top.

grid :    a GtkGrid
left :    the left edge of the cell
top :     the top edge of the cell
Returns : the child at the given position, or NULL
Since 3.2
 I tried using this method in my current project and I get the following message in the stack trace;     neighbour = self.parent.grid.get_child_at(x, y)
AttributeError: 'Grid' object has no attribute 'get_child_at'
 But if I am using Gtk 3.4.2, and the method was available 'since 3.2' that does not seem to make much sense. Maybe I made a mistake elsewhere? Here is a short test program that illustrates the error (see the line marked <--------) from gi.repository import Gtk

grid = Gtk.Grid()
window.add(grid)

 When the west navigation panel is minimised, then the tabWidgetPanel is also moving towards left leaving the right side of the empty screen. What I want is when the west navigation panel is collapsed, I want the tabWidgetPanel to increase in size and occupy the entire screen.

@TITLE:Android Camera API, HDR Photo Setting? (Samsung Galaxy)
@CONTENT:Does anyone know how if the HDR logic is in the camera application or in the camera driver for android phones? For example on the samsung galaxy you can enable HDR mode on the default camera app to get greater dynamic range captured on your photos. Is that done by the camera app, or done by the camera driver/API? For example can I write a camera app that can capture in HDR mode as well? I noticed in the camera settings (if you flatten the settings) that there is a hidden setting called "hdr-mode". I tried to set this but when i took a picture it reported an error. Alternatively, is there a way to capture a burst of photos very rapidly each with a different exposure value so HDR can be post-processed? I also saw a hidden setting something like pictures-per-shutter that appears to allow burst capture. But it dooesn't seem to have a way to do exposure bracketing as would be necessary to process HDR. Let's say for this example if this is dependent on specific phone-- that we are working with a Galaxy S3.

@TITLE:Creating a Java Program that outputs a table of contents [duplicate]
@CONTENT:Possible Duplicate: Need help creating a java program that prints a table of contents from a book I'm supposed to create a program that outputs a table of contents. Let me give you guys a background of my assignment. The user is supposed to enter a chapter title and a starting page number in a loop, until the user enters 4 asterisks for the chapter title. After the user enters the 4 asterisks, I'm supposed to print out the output, something like King Arthur's Court.............................3 Knights of the Table Round... ............8 Sir Dinadan the Humorist..................12 I think I have most of my coding right. In my test program, I created a while loop that allows the user to enter a chapter title and a starting page number. This loop will terminate when the user enters 4 asterisks for the chapter title. But, where I'm stuck is after my while loop, to generate the output after the user enters the asterisks. Instead of having the table of contents displayed, I'm getting an output. I tried a for loop to print out the title, dots, and page number, but it only displays asterisks. I think that the loop is wrong. Here's my code so far: // My Table of Contents class
public class TocEntry
{

public TocEntry(String title, int page) // 2 Argument Constructor
{
           chapterTitle = title;
           startPage = page;
}


public String toString() // toString method to print out chapter title,
                         // given dots, and start page
{
    String temp = "" + startPage;
    int numDots = 60 - (temp.length()+ chapterTitle.length());

    String toc_out = chapterTitle;
    for(int i = 0; i < numDots; i++)
       toc_out=toc_out +".";
       toc_out= toc_out + startPage;
    return toc_out;
}


private String chapterTitle; 
private int startPage;


    }// End of class TocEntry

// My Test program
import java.util.Scanner;
public class useToEntry {

public static void main(String[] args)
{
    Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

    final int TOCSIZE = 100;// Max size of TOC
    TocEntry toc[] = new TocEntry[TOCSIZE];
    int toc_curlen = 0;// The toc_curlen is intended to keep track of the number 
                       // of chapters entered by the user

    System.out.print("Enter chapter title: ");
    String chapterTitle = input.next();

    while(!"****".equals(chapterTitle))
    {
       System.out.print("Enter starting page number: ");
       int page = input.nextInt();

       System.out.print("Enter chapter title: ");
       chapterTitle= input.next();

       toc [toc_curlen] = new TocEntry(chapterTitle,page);
       toc_curlen = toc_curlen++;

    }// End of while loop

       for (int line = 0; line < toc_curlen; line++)
       {
         System.out.println(chapterTitle.toString());
       }// End of for loop
  }// End of main method

}// End of class useToEntry

@TITLE:Interval between asynchronous data loading and reloading UITableView
@CONTENT:I am asynchronously loading data to an array in a getter method of data. First of all it produces an empty array, so naturally my table loads 0 rows. When the data is finished loading, I call reloadData to update my table, however, there seems to be ~6 second gap between the data being downloaded and the UITableView showing the data. Does anyone know any reasons this might happen? I use the dispatch_async method with a priority of high. I've even logged each point in the process of loading the data and inserting the data, and it shows this. Also, if I keep scrolling the table up and down as it's data is being loaded, the table shows its data as soon as it should, rather than have this gap between insertion. Code: - (NSMutableDictionary *)tableDictionary {
    if (!_tableDictionary) {
        _tableDictionary = [NSMutableDictionary dictionary];

        dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_HIGH, 0), ^{

@LINK:/questions/12538287/destroy-directx-device-and-swap-chain
@TITLE:destroy directx device and swap chain
@CONTENT:I am encountering a strange issue I think involves D3D11CreateDeviceAndSwapChain I can create the device and swap chain however when the application exits and ->destroy gets called on the swap chain, device, and device context a thread is still running. Commenting out this line the application terminates as expected. featureLevel = D3D_FEATURE_LEVEL_11_0;
result = D3D11CreateDeviceAndSwapChain(NULL, D3D_DRIVER_TYPE_HARDWARE, NULL, 0, &featureLevel, 1, D3D11_SDK_VERSION, &swapChainDesc, &m_swapChain, &m_device, NULL, &m_deviceContext);

if(FAILED(result))
{
#ifdef _DEBUG
    log(logDEBUG) << "Error at D3D11CreateDeviceAndSwapChain";
#endif
    return false;
}
return true;
 and the destruction: if(m_swapChain)
{
    m_swapChain->SetFullscreenState(false, NULL);
}

if(m_device)
{
    m_device->Release();
}

if(m_deviceContext)
{
    m_deviceContext->Release();
}

if(m_swapChain)
{
    m_swapChain->Release();
}
 I am fairly confident that the issue is coming from this, but I am not 100% sure. stepping through the code i see that each Release gets called correctly. (the application will close properly if the first block is commented out.) Thanks for any insight regarding this issue.

@TITLE:Play! framework: can I reschedule the job?
@CONTENT:I'm using Play! framwork of version 1.2.4 In my application, I have implemented a number of scheduled jobs (descendants of play.jobs.Job). Question Can I change the schedule of these jobs at runtime? My own findings At first glance, the job scheduling in Play! is done via play.jobs.JobsPlugin, which in turn uses JDK's java.util.concurrent.ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor instance which is publicly exposed. So far I came up with following approach: when it's the moment to change schedule, I simply iterate over executor' scheduled jobs, cancel one which I need to reschedule and schedule the same job (more precisely, the job of the same class) with new settings. Something like this: for (final Object o: JobsPlugin.executor.getQueue())
{
    ScheduledFuture task = (ScheduledFuture) o;
    Job job = (Job) Java.extractUnderlyingCallable((FutureTask)task);
    if (MyJob.class == job.getClass())
    {
        task.cancel(true);
        new MyJob().every("2h");
        break;
    }
}
 Are there any better solutions? Thanks!

@TITLE:Standalone/Replicated Ehcache for cluster
@CONTENT:In our project, we decided to use Ehcache in our application as a second level cache for Hibernate and query caching. It seems to be working well. Then suddenly we realized that our production environment is clustered. Looking at the ehcache documentation, I see that the best thing would be to go for distributed caching but then that involves Terracotta Server, something the client won't be prepared to pay for at this stage. According to the documentation, for the Standalone topology: If standalone caching is being used where there are multiple application nodes running the same application, then there is Weak Consistency between them. My two questions are: Using ehcache in a "Read-only" mode and continuing to use it standalone in a clustered environment, what is the hit that we would be taking? Because if it only that say, for the cases it would hit the other nodes, it would fetch the data off the DB as cache won't be replicated/configured there, I guess we'll take it. Only thing is, it should not result in an anomaly. I would want to know the consequences of using standalone topology for my scenario. Can we look at the third topology, Replicated Caching, as a solution? I am new to ehcache and hence these basic questions. Replies much appreciated! thanks!

@TITLE:Adding multiple records to a relations table with symfony
@CONTENT:I have setup 3 tables in symfony: A flipbook table, A Skills table, and a relations table, to connect each skill id with each flipbook id. WHen I built the model, symfony constructed everything correctly, and by default gave a drop-down menu for the skills, which had all skills from the skills table as options. You can select an option and it creates the appropriate relationships. This is working (sort of). When you submit the form, it does not add the skill_id to the record. It just adds the auto-increment id to the skills relations table and neither the flipbook_id or skill_id. Aaaaaand, if you click more than one checkbox, you get this nice message: invalid parameter number number of bound variables does not match number of tokens
 Whaaaat does that mean? This has got to be a schema issue eh? How about some code? yes.please. Schema: Flipbook:

$useFields = array(
  'flipbook_id',
  'skill_id',
);

$this->useFields($useFields);
 Let me know if I should provide further code or explanation. Here is the FlipbookSkillsTable.class generated in the model: <?php

/**
 * FlipbookSkillsTable
 * 
 * This class has been auto-generated by the Doctrine ORM Framework
 */
class FlipbookSkillsTable extends Doctrine_Table
{
    /**
     * Returns an instance of this class.
     *
     * @return object FlipbookSkillsTable
     */
    public static function getInstance()
    {
        return Doctrine_Core::getTable('FlipbookSkills');
    }

    public function retrieveForFilter()
    {
      $res = $this->createQuery('s')
        ->select('s.id, s.name')
        ->orderBy('s.name ASC')
        ->execute(array(), Doctrine_Core::HYDRATE_NONE);

      // if you want an empty line
      $rets = array('' => '');
      foreach ($res as $ret)
      {
        $rets[$ret[0]] = $ret[1];
      }

      return $rets;
    }

    public function getAllFlipbookSkills() {
        $allSkills = Doctrine_Query::create()
            ->from('FlipbookSkills')
            ->orderBy('title ASC')
            ->execute();
    return $allSkills;
    }
}
 UPDATE I believe the issue is it is trying to bind the multiple values in the same record. It should make a new record for each skill chosen, like this: id    flipbook_id    skill_id
1          2            1
2          2            2
3          2            3
 SO I still don't have the schema nailed down correctly, otherwise Doctrine would know how to handle the data correct? Should I explicitly put one to many relationship? Also, when submitted, it is only adding the flipbook_id value to the record. The skill_id record is 0 FLipbookRelationsForm: class FlipbookSkillRelationsForm extends BaseFlipbookSkillRelationsForm
{
  public function configure()
  {

    $this->widgetSchema['skill_id'] = 
       new sfWidgetFormDoctrineChoice(array('model' =>

@TITLE:Multiple receipt count for restoreCompletedTransaction inapp purchasing
@CONTENT:I have an autorenewable subscription. When the app is installed on a new device, Apple returns ALL previous purchase receipts, in this case since it is sandbox I get 6 receipts every time I install. The observer then sends the queue for restoredCompleted transactions. I have a method to send the transaction to my server for Apple verification, but it runs 6 times because of the 6 receipts. I really only want to deal with the LAST receipt sent. So I am trying to count the transactions in the queue and ONLY verify the receipt when the count reaches 1. Here is what I have so far:     - (void)paymentQueue: (SKPaymentQueue *)queue updatedTransactions:(NSArray *)transactions {
if (myQueue == nil) {
    myQueue = [SKPaymentQueue defaultQueue];
}

NSLog(@"Transactions in Array  in My Store %@", [queue transactions]); 
tCount =myQueue.transactions.count;
NSString *transCount =  [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%d",tCount];

for (SKPaymentTransaction *transaction in transactions)       

{ switch (transaction.transactionState)     

    { case SKPaymentTransactionStatePurchased:
            [self completeTransaction: transaction];
            break;

        case SKPaymentTransactionStateFailed:

            break;

                [self restoreTransaction: transaction];
            }

            else {
               tCount--;

                    [[SKPaymentQueue defaultQueue] finishTransaction: transaction];

          }
      }

 The restore cycles through, but the count does not decrement. This is probably something simple and dumb. Can someone show me how to decrement this count? Thanks!

@TITLE:How do I insert a mysql spatial point with a yii model?
@CONTENT:I have a model type that was generated from a mysql table that has address data and also a spatial POINT field named "coordinates". When a model is created or updated I want to geocode the address and store the latitude and longitude coordinates in the POINT field. My understanding is the way to do this is to geocode the address in the model's beforeSave method. I have done this and have the coordinates in an associative array. Now my question is how can I insert this data into my coordinates field? This is what I'm trying: public function beforeSave()
{
    $singleLineAddress = $this->getSingleLineAddress();
    $coords = Geocoder::getCoordinates($singleLineAddress);

    // WORKS: using the following line works to insert POINT(0 0)
    //$this->coordinates = new CDbExpression("GeomFromText('POINT(0 0)')");

    // DOESN'T WORK: using the following line gives an error
    $this->coordinates = new CDbExpression("GeomFromText('POINT(:lat :lng)')",
        array(':lat' => $coords['lat'], ':lng' => $coords['lng'] ));

    return parent::beforeSave();
}
 When I do this I get the following error: CDbCommand failed to execute the SQL statement: SQLSTATE[HY093]: Invalid parameter number: number of bound variables does not match number of tokens. The SQL statement executed was: INSERT INTO place (city, state, name, street, postal_code, phone, created, coordinates) VALUES (:yp0, :yp1, :yp2, :yp3, :yp4, :yp5, UTC_TIMESTAMP(), GeomFromText('POINT(:lat :lng)'))

 Aside from setting the style in the the XAML file that makes use of my control, how can this be accomplished? I'd like to be able to set the style from within the UserControl so that I can see the effects of the style in the designer for the UserControl.

@TITLE:Handling dynamic nested views with Ember + Handlebars
@CONTENT:I'm using Ember.js 1.0 pre release and Handlebars 1.0.0 and want to represent a list of comments to a post. My comment object is this: // COMMENT ITEM
HaBlog.Comment = Em.Object.extend({
 user:null,
 text:null,
 created: moment().subtract('years', 100),
 createdAgo: function(){
     return (this.get('created').fromNow());
 }.property('created'),
 rating:null,
 replies:[]
 }); And this is my template for the view:  <div id="postComments" class="span10">
        <h1>Comments</h1>
        {{#each comments}}
        <div class="comment">
            <small>
                <span class="commentDate">
                    {{createdAgo}}
                </span>
            </small>
                <span class="commentText">
                    {{text}}
                </span>
        </div>
        {{#each comments.replies}}
        <div class="comment">
            <small>
                <span class="commentDate">
                    {{createdAgo}}

            </small>
                <span class="commentText">

                </span>
        </div>
        {{/each}}
    </div>
 My problem is that each comment can have a number of replies, which are comments on their own, so they can have more replies. I have check the nested views in Ember.js and Handlebars, but don't seem to find any way to make it loop through all the replies in a recursive way displaying all the comments in a "tree" way...

serversocket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
serversocket.bind(('localhost', 8089)) 
serversocket.listen(5)

    buf = connection.recv(64)
    if len(buf)> 0:

 This is the client code import socket

clientsocket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
clientsocket.connect(('localhost', 8089)) 
data = 'lorem ipsum'
clientsocket.send(data.encode())
input('press enter')
 and this is the function def addme(x,y):
    return x + y

print (addme(6,4))
 Supposing i have the function addme() on the server,would it be possible to call it from the client and the response displayed to the client?.

@TITLE:R, plot , font size changes in multiple plot figures
@CONTENT:I am creating graphs for a publication and would like them to have the same font size. When I create a figure with multiple plots, the font size decreases even though I haven't changed the tiff() resolution or pointsize parameter. I increased the figure size according to ultimately fit the number of plots, and made sure the margins are equivalent for single and multiple plot figures. Following is an example code (The font size is consistent between 1x1 and 2x1 figure, but decreases for 3x2 figure): tiff("1x1.tif", width=3,height=2.5,units="in",res=600,pointsize=8,
compression="lzw",restoreConsole=T)
par(mfrow=c(1,1),mar=c(4,4,.5,.5)+0.1)

 Why is this happening? P.S.: I'm not using ggplot2 or lattice because I'm using my own error bar function on the "actual" figures (I can't remember why right now but I tried working with the ggplot2 error bars and didn't get what I wanted).

 This works perfectly, it creates a zipped folder that is then downloaded to the users machine. What I need to do is add header information so the user is given the 'save as' dialog box. I have tried several different things (trying to use request.setRequestHeader, including header information in the data portion) but I am having no luck. Can someone please send me in the correct direction on this? Thanks. Or is there a way to add the header information right before window.location.href = obj['url']
 I need to figure this out, Thanks again for any help.

@TITLE:Do we have to explicitly recycle the bitmap if we don't need it?
@CONTENT:Bitmap has a recycle method, but do we have to invoke it explicitly if we don't need it any more? For example, an ImageView has a bitmap now. When user click a button, it will set a new bitmap to the ImageView. Do we have to recycle the original bitmap before assign the new one?

@LINK:/questions/12532918/android-andengine-simple-sprite-collision
@TITLE:Android AndEngine: Simple sprite collision
@CONTENT:I am new to AndEngine game development (or game development in general) and I am working on a very simple game. The setting is that I have 4 main sprites in the game: a.) Fighter Plane b.) Tank c.) Foot soldiers d.) Bomb The game is in a current infinite loop. The fighter plane comes out from the left, zooms across the screen and comes out the right again continuously every second. The Tank comes out from the left side of the screen, makes its way to the middle of the screen, drops off some foot soldiers who make their way to the right side of the screen. The tank will then face left and go back to where it came from. The player can tap the screen to launch a bomb that goes straight downwards. When it hits either the tank or the soldiers, the bomb explodes (leaving an explosion sprite) and the bomb, as well as the object it collides with (tank or soldier) detaches from the scene. My dilemma is that, I can't seem to solve the logic involving the collision. I mean sure, I get the functions, but I'm stumped logic wise. Here is a snapshot of the game itself: Here is my snippet (this function is called from the onCreateScene update handler:     protected void checkTankCollision() {
    // TODO Auto-generated method stub

    int numCompares = bombGroup.getChildCount();
    for (int i = 0; i < numCompares; i++) {
        Sprite s = (Sprite) bombGroup.getChildByIndex(i);
        for (int j = 0; j < numCompares; j++) {
            Sprite s2 = (Sprite) tankGroup.getChildByIndex(j);
            if (s.collidesWith(s2)) {
                // boom
                AnimatedSprite boom = createExplosion();
                boom.setPosition(s.getX(), s.getY());
                getEngine().getScene().attachChild(boom);

                // WARNING: cannot detach from the list
                // while looping through the list
                final Sprite a = s;
                final Sprite b = s2;

                // this will do the action after the scene is done updating
                getEngine().getScene().postRunnable(new Runnable() {

                    @Override
                    public void run() {
                        a.detachSelf();
                        b.detachSelf();
                    }
                });
            }
        }
    }

}
 The game force closes after some bomb launches. It gives an indexOutOfBoundsException error. Here's the logCat:     09-22 00:12:14.565: E/AndroidRuntime(924): FATAL EXCEPTION: UpdateThread

@LINK:/questions/12531976/concatenate-string-literals-with-directoryinfo-enumeration-and-adding-quotation
@TITLE:Concatenate string literals with DirectoryInfo enumeration and adding quotation marks.
@CONTENT:This seems like such an obscure question, but here it goes: Is there a way to concatenate String Literals with a DirectoryInfo enumeration (which contains a file path) while adding quotations around the file path? Further, how can I prevent backslashes from being doubled when converting a DirectoryInfo enumeration to a string? My situation is as follows: DirectoryInfo filePathDirectory = new DirectoryInfo(filePath);
Process a = new Process();

a.StartInfo.FileName = "C:\\Windows\\system32\\lpr.exe";
a.StartInfo.Arguments = "-SServername.Domain.net -Plp " + "\"" + filePathDirectory + "\"";
a.StartInfo.UseShellExecute = false;
a.Start();
a.WaitForExit();
 filePathDirectory starts with a value of: {\\ServerName\Share\Folder\Folder\FileName.xls}
 Which I think is converted into a string once concatenated into a.StartInfo.Arguments which is assigned the value of: -SServername.Domain.net -Plp \"\\\\ServerName\\Share\\Folder\\Folder\\FileName.xls\"
 This is bad because, the number of backslashes in the path doubled. How can I ensure no backslashes are added to the path? On top of that, to add a quotation marks, I've used the backslash escape sequence; But the backslash from this escape sequence is inadvertently added to my string. How can I add quotation marks around the file path which is contained in a.StartInfo.Arguments? P.S. I hope this makes sense, please ask questions if you need clarification.
@CODE:DirectoryInfo filePathDirectory = new DirectoryInfo(filePath);
Process a = new Process();

a.StartInfo.FileName = "C:\\Windows\\system32\\lpr.exe";
a.StartInfo.Arguments = "-SServername.Domain.net -Plp " + "\"" + filePathDirectory + "\"";
a.StartInfo.UseShellExecute = false;
a.Start();
a.WaitForExit(); filePathDirectory {\\ServerName\Share\Folder\Folder\FileName.xls} a.StartInfo.Arguments -SServername.Domain.net -Plp \"\\\\ServerName\\Share\\Folder\\Folder\\FileName.xls\" a.StartInfo.Arguments

@TITLE:C# > UPnP - COMException: The owner of the PerUser subscription is not logged on to the system specified (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80040210)
@CONTENT:I'm trying to communicate with dlna compliant devices using a C#.net application, using the UPnP protocol. I'm using the default Visual studio UPnP library("UPnP 1.0 type library (control point)"). I list all rendering devices using UPNPDeviceFinder.FindByType. All works fine... Now I get the AVTransport service using the function:     public UPnPService GetAVTransport(UPnPDevice mediaDevice)
    {
        foreach (UPnPService service in mediaDevice.Services)
        {
            Debug.Print(service.ServiceTypeIdentifier);
            if (service.ServiceTypeIdentifier == "urn:schemas-upnp-org:service:AVTransport:1")
            {
                return service;
            }
        }

        return null;
    }
 I try to send a play command to a device like so:     Service = GetAVTransport(Device);

    object[] input = new object[2]
    {
        "0", // Object Id
        "1" //  Speed
    };

    object output = new object();

    Service.InvokeAction("Play", input, ref output);
 On the last line, i get the following error: COMException: The owner of the PerUser subscription is not logged on to the system specified (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80040210) What does this mean. It's totally unclear as to why this exception occurs. Thanks, Thomas

But I need copying based on some property (e.g. id in my case) as per following example: obj1 = [{id:"id1", name:"name1"},{id:"id2", name:"name2"}]
obj2 = [{id:"id3", name:"name3"}{id:"id1", name:"name1_modified"}]
 jQuery.extend will return: [{id:"id3", name:"name3"}{id:"id1", name:"name1_modified"}]
 But I need output as: [{id:"id1", name:"name1_modified"},{id:"id2", name:"name2"}{id:"id3", name:"name3"}]
 is there any method/library to accomplish this?
@CODE:jQuery.extend(true, obj1, obj2) obj1 = [{id:"id1", name:"name1"},{id:"id2", name:"name2"}]
obj2 = [{id:"id3", name:"name3"}{id:"id1", name:"name1_modified"}] jQuery.extend [{id:"id3", name:"name3"}{id:"id1", name:"name1_modified"}] [{id:"id1", name:"name1_modified"},{id:"id2", name:"name2"}{id:"id3", name:"name3"}]

@CONTENT:Project: I have a MySQL database of alumni home address locations stored as lng/lat. I want to be able to identify groups of 15 members or more of alumni that live within a 15 mile radius of each other. Given a lng/lat, how do I select the other lng/lat locations that are within a 15 mile radius? I've installed on Linux the PHP geonames package from PEAR. It isn't clear to me if I can use this package for aid in this function. It contains radius routines, but they appear to be for returning information such as postal codes within a lng/lat radius.

@TITLE:Task<WebResponse>.Wait lasts forever
@CONTENT:C#, .Net 4.5. I have a queue that contains objects which are to be processed. Processing includes obtaining data with the URL which specified in one of the fields of the object. In the course of operation the new objects can be added to the queue. When I tried to do the work with the network asynchronous, I faced with a problem. Here is a minimum code. public partial class Form1 : Form
{
    private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        string[] urls = { "http://www.stackoverflow.com/", 
                            "http://www.google.com/", 
                            "http://www.microsoft.com/" };
        int i = 0;
        Queue<MyClass1> queue = new Queue<MyClass1>();

        HttpWebRequest webRequest = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(urls[i]);
        webRequest.Proxy.Credentials = CredentialCache.DefaultCredentials;
        queue.Enqueue(new MyClass1(urls[i], webRequest.GetResponseAsync()));

        while (queue.Count > 0)
        {
            MyClass1 o = queue.Dequeue();
            o.RespTask.Wait();
            Debug.Print("Url: {0}, bytes: {1}", o.Url, 
                o.RespTask.Result.ContentLength);

            i++;
            if (i < urls.Length)
            {
                webRequest = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(urls[i]);
                webRequest.Proxy.Credentials = CredentialCache.DefaultCredentials;
                queue.Enqueue(new MyClass1(urls[i], webRequest.GetResponseAsync()));
            }
        } 
    }
}

public class MyClass1
{
    public MyClass1() { }
    public MyClass1(string url, Task<WebResponse> respTask)
    {
        Url = url;
        RespTask = respTask;
    }

    public string Url;
    public Task<WebResponse> RespTask;
}
 That code hangs on o.RespTask.Wait(); on third iteration of cycle. Before this call o.RespTask.Status has value WaitingForActivation and waiting lasts forever. What am I doing wrong? UPDATE. I checked the code on 3 boxes. On two of them (Win7 32-bit and Win7 64-bit) the program hangs. On the third (Win7 64-bit) everything is working fine. It seems to me very strange.

@TITLE:Populating and sorting a List<? extends T & S>
@CONTENT:I'm making a set of custom swing components that implement various properties like a required flag or tabIndex. I'm having problems when trying to populate a List of the various custom components, and then sorting the list based on the tabIndex of each component. How I'm trying to do this is by having my components implement an interface called Indexed which implements a single method getIndex(). Then sorting using my IndexedComparator. My classes: Indexed: public interface Indexed {
      public int getIndex();
}
 IndexedComparator: public class IndexedComparator implements Comparator<Indexed> {

    @Override
    public int compare(Indexed o1, Indexed o2) {
        return o1.getIndex() - o2.getIndex();
    }

}
 WWTextField: public class WWTextField extends JTextField implements Indexed, FocusListener {
    private boolean required;
    private int tabIndex;

   ...

    @Override
    public int getIndex() {
        return tabIndex;
    }
}
 NewJFrame: public class NewJFrame extends JFrame {
    List<? extends Component & Indexed> list = new ArrayList<>();
    IndexedFocusTraversalPolicy policy = new IndexedFocusTraversalPolicy();

    public NewJFrame() {
        initComponents();

        list.add(wWTextField1);
        list.add(wWTextField2);
        list.add(wWTextField3);
        list.add(wWTextField4);
        list.add(wWTextField5);
        list.add(wWFormatedTextField1);
        list.add(wWFormatedTextField2);

        Collections.sort(list);
        policy.populateComponents(list);
        this.setFocusTraversalPolicy(policy);
    }
}
 Edit: I forgot to post an actual question. Why doesn't my implementation of List<? extends Component & Indexed> list = new ArrayList<>();
 Work? When I try to compile I get these errors: NewJFrame.java:22: error: > expected

@TITLE:Partial View not working propely in index view.
@CONTENT:I am developing MVC application and using razor syntax. In this application I am giving comment facility. I have added a partial view, which loads the comment/Records from DB. In below image, we can see the comment box which is called run-time for employee index view. Now as we can see comment box, I called at run-time, which is partial view, but problem is I can add comment for only on first record...after first record that button wont work at all... anything is missing ? Is there separate process when we call any partial view run-time and make in action on it ? See the pic... Here is the code.... @model PagedList.IPagedList<CRMEntities.Customer>

@TITLE:Clicking Past a Transparent Frame (Java)
@CONTENT:I am trying to develop an application in Java (Swing) that lets me overlay a grid on the screen, and be able to click things behind the grid -- say, an icon the desktop for example. Would I approach this problem with a Transparent JFrame or a Transparent JWindow? Whatever I use, the transparent window/frame needs to always be on top. occupy the entire screen. register every click with a mouse listener. record the coordinates of the clicks on the screen. allow me to use the Graphics class to draw a grid on the screen, and other elements, like numbers or images, that should also be click through. Any direction would be appreciated. Apologize if I haven't been specific enough, but I haven't found a demo window or frame that can do all these things. There's an example here and another here -- but I don't know how to use WindowUtils in Eclipse. This is my first time in GUI development and I've never used external libraries aside from the base Java classes.

@TITLE:php imagepng() generating black image only on server
@CONTENT:I am dynamically generating a waveform image from a user-uploaded sound file, using a script I've based on: http://andrewfreiday.com/2010/04/29/generating-mp3-waveforms-with-php/ The script works fine on my dev environment Windows 7, Apache2, PHP 5. But when I put it on my server Ubuntu Linux, Apache2 PHP 5, imagepng() outputs a black box. I've looked into similar problems, such as Why is this creating a black image? and have made sure that my imagealphablending() and imagesavealpha() are being used the way described. But still no luck. I've checked folder permissions and confirmed that LAME can write into the proper folder without throwing an error. I've also tried to simply set the background color to the same color as my pages backgground, as the transparency is a "nice to have," not a necessity. Anyway, here is the PHP that outputs my image: // want it resized?
if ($width) {
  // resample the image to the proportions defined in the form
  $rimg = imagecreatetruecolor($width, $height);
  // save alpha from original image
  imagealphablending($rimg, false);
  imagesavealpha($rimg, true);
  // copy to resized
  imagecopyresampled($rimg, $img, 0, 0, 0, 0, $width, $height, imagesx($img), imagesy($img));
  imagepng($rimg, "../img/" . $genFileName .".png");
  imagedestroy($rimg);
} else {
  imagealphablending($img, false);
  imagesavealpha($img, true);
  imagepng($img, "../img/" . $genFileName .".png");
}

imagedestroy($img);

echo "img/" . $genFileName . ".png";


} else {

echo "An error.";


}
 And this is the Javascript that calls it: //pass the audio data to the server to have the wave drawn
_generateWaveForm = function(_file){

//create the form data
_form.append('file',_file);                      //mp3 to be sent to the server
_form.append('height',300);                      //height of image to be returned
_form.append('width',window.innerWidth - 20);    //width of image to be returned
_form.append('foreground','#FFFF51');            //color of image to be returned
_form.append('background','');                   //background (left empty for transparent BG)
_form.append('flat',true);                       //setting flat to true

    //pass it on

    data: _form,

@TITLE:How secure is PowerShell's ConvertFrom-SecureString -key
@CONTENT:I have a module that includes some strings with some private data that should be hard to attain, but changes frequently. I need to put this script on a variety of machines where it might be accessed and the code read by someone who should not have the information used to derive the output. I'm really concerned about strings that change from time to time so I'm considering creating a script which prompts for those values as secure strings and encrypts them using a key and dumps them into an xml file. The XML file then is used to provide the strings. Anyone running a command from this module that needs that data would have to provide the key so the strings could be decrypted. Here is basically what I expect to do, but I'll be dealing with objects $secure = Read-Host -AsSecureString
$encrypted =  ConvertFrom-SecureString -securestring $secure -key somekey
$encrypted | Export-Clixml testing.xml
$imported = Import-Clixml testing.xml
$value = ConvertTo-SecureString -string $imported -key somekey
 I understand that the string will be encrypted using the Rijndael encryption algorithm, which is also known as AES I believe. How much effort is needed to break that encrypted key where it rests in the xml file, given access to the script?
@CODE:$secure = Read-Host -AsSecureString
$encrypted =  ConvertFrom-SecureString -securestring $secure -key somekey
$encrypted | Export-Clixml testing.xml
$imported = Import-Clixml testing.xml

@TITLE:What type/types of threading should I use in WPF and c# for my scenario¡K regular threads, background worker, or thread pool?
@CONTENT:I have an order manager application created in C# and WPF. The order manager application needs to communicate back and forth with a shipping application that is written in a completely different shipping language. The method of communication between the programs is an XML file whose EnableShipping attribute is either a 0 or a 1 and a SQL database. In my order manager application I have button that "Begins shipping" and changes the EnableShipping attribute from a 0 to a 1. The shipping application is looping and reads this value, begins shipping all of the orders whose certain attribute matches a string, changes this attribute to a different string, and marks a different attribute (Status Changed) to 1. In my order manager application, as of now I have a thread that continually loops and checks the database for orders with a Status Changed attribute of 1, makes the changes to the UI and writes back to the database, Status Changed = 0. Here is some code to show what my order manager application is doing in the thread. while(true)
        {
            string enabled = null;
            currentInstance = OrderManager.getCurrentInstance();
            SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand("Select OrderNumber, BatchStatus from dbo.Orders where StatusChanged='1'", connection1);
            SqlDataReader reader = command.ExecuteReader();
            if (reader.HasRows)
            {
                while (reader.Read())
                {
                    Int64 orderNum = (Int64)reader[0];
                    int index = linqForOrderIndex(orderNum);
                    string batchStatus = (string)reader["BatchStatus"];
                    SqlCommand statusChangedFalse = new SqlCommand("Update dbo.orders Set StatusChanged = '0' where OrderNumber = '" + orderNum + "'", connection2);
                    switch (batchStatus)
                    {
                        case "Untouched":
                            currentInstance.Orders[index].batchStatus = "Untouched";
                            break;
                        case "Batch Ready":
                            currentInstance.Orders[index].batchStatus = "Batch Ready";
                            break;
                        case "Shipped":
                            currentInstance.Orders[index].batchStatus = "Shipped";
                            break;
                        case "Error":
                            currentInstance.Orders[index].batchStatus = "Error";
                            break;
                    }
                    statusChangedFalse.ExecuteNonQuery();

                    Thread.Sleep(1000);

                    reader.Close();
                    reader = command.ExecuteReader();
                }

                currentInstance.Dispatcher.BeginInvoke(System.Windows.Threading.DispatcherPriority.Normal,
                    new Action(
                        delegate()
                        {
                            currentInstance.refreshTreeFilters();
                            currentInstance.refreshOrderCounts();
                            currentInstance.batchReadyView();
                        }
                    )); 
            }
      }
 So Even if you don't know exactly what is going on in the code, you know that I have to continuously check the database for status changed items, do work on those items in my collection as well as in the database, update the UI, and keep repeating the process. At first I thought a good old thread would work like my code is doing now, but the UI becomes unresponsive when I am "doing work". I looked at some background worker code online seeing if maybe that would be a good choice for better UI responsiveness, but didn't know if this is a good solution as I need to continuously keep doing work and updating the UI. Any thoughts or suggestions? appreciate it...

@TITLE:wsContext.getMessageContext().get(MessageContext.SERVLET_REQUEST) returns null on Jetty?
@CONTENT:I have an extension of this question. I have that exact code running on a Jetty Server, and other SOAP web services work perfectly. However, on this line: HttpServletRequest req = (HttpServletRequest)mc.get(MessageContext.SERVLET_REQUEST); 
System.out.println("Client IP = " + req.getRemoteAddr()); 
 The server crashes with a null pointer exception. mc.get(MessageContext.SERVLET_REQUEST) is returning null. By comparison, mc.get(MessageContext.HTTP_REQUEST_METHOD) returns "POST", so I assume that's working. What can I do to fix this? EDIT: I've tried this fix to no avail. I've also tried using the @Context annotation instead and got the same issue. A System.out.println(mc) yields this: {javax.xml.ws.wsdl.port={http://my.test.namespace.com/}testWSDLPort,
 javax.xml.ws.soap.http.soapaction.uri="", 
 com.sun.xml.internal.ws.server.OneWayOperation=null, 
 javax.xml.ws.http.request.pathinfo=null, 
 ...
 ...
 and so on, and the list of values does NOT include javax.xml.ws.servlet.request, which is the value of MessageContext.SERVLET_REQUEST. What do I need to do to make sure the MessageContext has this value?
@CODE:HttpServletRequest req = (HttpServletRequest)mc.get(MessageContext.SERVLET_REQUEST); 
System.out.println("Client IP = " + req.getRemoteAddr()); mc.get(MessageContext.SERVLET_REQUEST) mc.get(MessageContext.HTTP_REQUEST_METHOD {javax.xml.ws.wsdl.port={http://my.test.namespace.com/}testWSDLPort,

@CONTENT:We have setup a simple form using Web Forms For Marketers on our Sitecore 6.4.0 site. The form is logging information just fine, and we have written a page to allow end-users to view the results, using the code from http://r-coding-sitecoreblog.blogspot.com/2011/11/extracting-data-from-sitecore-wffm.html mainly. The next step in the progression is to allow a user to approve/reject a submission, and to either pass that form submission's information to a method, or to delete that form submission all together. Is there a way to delete a form submission from the WFFM database using c#? I have tried the Sitecore.Forms.Data.DataManager.DeleteForms() method with no luck, and I suspect it deletes the entire form, not just the individual form submission. EDIT: Additionally, I could handle even setting a flag on the individual form submission, marking it as approved/rejected, and just handling the show/hide logic in my code. So setting a value on a particular form submission would also work.

@TITLE:Fragment Orientation Change - Better Test than for Landscape
@CONTENT:In 'Landscape' mode I have two FrameLayouts controlled by One Activity and utilizing two Fragments. In 'Portrait' mode I have one FrameLayout controlled by One Activity, on Selecting a Line I call another activity to display the detail using a detail fragment In the 'Portrait' detail activity I have the following check for orientation in the onCreate() method. if (getResources().getConfiguration().orientation == Configuration.ORIENTATION_LANDSCAPE) { finish(); return; } The above works well but, A problem arises though when I have a 'small' device. In this case in 'Landscape' mode I don't want the two fragment view, rather I want to behave like the 'portrait' view. However since the device is in fact in 'Landscape' when the detail activity launches it automatically finishes. So the questions is what is the best way of handling this?

@CONTENT:I have a folder with several .pl files that run through main.pl. I have successfully had these working by using require 'file.pl'; at the beginning of the main file. I have used some modules, too, without issue. I am now trying to use a 'home-made' module, but when I add use Add::Location::CSearch qw(c_search); to the top of the file that it is being used in (or the top of the main file) and run the main file, it produces the Can't locate file.pl in @INC... error with file.pl being the first file in the require list in the main file. From how I understand it, after adding the use line it now tries to find all the require in that same directory. The (@INC contains: ...) at the end of the error message lists some library/module folders. It also has . at the end for the current directory. I hope I have explained this well; it is confusing! I don't know why this happens and how to solve it, so I would be grateful for any ideas. Edit: Sample Code main.pl

@TITLE:Enable buffered I/O to stdout with Intel ifort compiler
@CONTENT:I've read the Intel docs about enabling buffered I/O with ifort (using -assume buffered_io or FORT_BUFFERED=true), and this works for output directly to files. However, we have large applications that are writing to stdout (e.g. write(*,*) or write(stdout,*)), which is redirected to a file. Neither of the buffering techniques work in this case. Other than refactoring the code to write directly to files, is there a method to enable buffered I/O on stdout with ifort? This is enabled by default on, for example, gfortran. We're using ifort 12.0 on SLES 11. Update: Thanks for the comments. I'm investigating stdbuf and/or piping through a buffering program (like tee) as a workaround. As yet, I haven't been able to make a measurable difference. Update 2: I've tried some experiments with Douglas's suggestion, piping through another program. tee and cat both buffer, in face the buffering seems to done by the pipe itself at about 8K. However, the overhead of the original write() calls, plus the pipe, plus the system calls of the piping program (tee, cat etc.) are too high to make this a workable solution.

 This all works fine. This problem is doing this....     .Add<StoreDto>("/merchantGroups/{merchantGroupId}/merchants/{merchantId}/stores/{id}
 The problem here is that the StoreDto object only contains a MerchantId, it does not contain a MerchantGroupId so this wouldn't work. One solution would be to add the MerchantGroupId to the DTO but the problem is that I am sharing the DTO with some other WCF services and it might be confusing if I were have a MerchantGroupId property in the StoreDto which is never populated during a retrieval operation. Plus I see this as cropping up at different places so I was hoping there was a better way to do it. Any suggestions?

@TITLE:Is lockless hashing without std::atomics guaranteed to be thread-safe in C++11?
@CONTENT:Consider the following attempt at a lockless hashtable for multithreaded search algorithms (inspired by this paper) struct Data
{
    uint64_t key;
    uint64_t value;
};

struct HashEntry
{
    uint64_t key_xor_value;
    uint64_t value;
};

void insert_data(Data const& e, HashEntry* h, std::size_t tableOffset)
{
    h[tableOffset].key_xor_value = e.key ^ e.value;
    h[tableOffset].value = e.value;
}

bool data_is_present(Data const& e, HashEntry const* h, std::size_t tableOffset)
{
    auto const tmp_key_xor_value = h[tableOFfset].key_xor_value;
    auto const tmp_value = h[tableOffset].value;

    return e.key == (tmp_key_xor_value ^ tmp_value);
}
 The idea is that a HashEntry struct stores the XOR-ed combination of the two 64-bit words of a Data struct. If two threads have interleaved reads/writes to the two 64-bit words of a HashEntry struct, the idea is that this can be detected by the reading thread by XOR-ing again and comparing against the original key. So one might have a loss of efficiency by corrupted hash entries, but still have guaranteed correctness in case the decoded retrieved key matches the original. The paper mentions that it is based on the following assumption: For the remainder of this discussion, assume that 64 bit memory read/write operations are atomic, that is the entire 64 bit value is read/written in one cycle. My questions are: is the above code without explicit use of std::atomic<uint64_t> guaranteed to be thread-safe in C++11? Or can the individual 64-bit words be corrupted by simultaneous reads/writes? Even on 64-bit platforms? And how is this different from the old C++98 Standard? Quotes from the Standard would be much appreciated. UPDATE: based on this amazing paper by Hans Boehm on "benign" data races, a simple way to get bitten is for the compiler to cancel both XORs from insert_data() and data_is_present() to alway return true, e.g. if it finds a local code fragment like insert_data(e, h, t);
if (data_is_present(e, h, t)) // optimized to true as if in single-threaded code
   read_and_process(e, h, t); // data race if other thread has written
@CODE:struct Data
{
    uint64_t key;
    uint64_t value;
};

struct HashEntry
{
    uint64_t key_xor_value;
    uint64_t value;
};

void insert_data(Data const& e, HashEntry* h, std::size_t tableOffset)
{
    h[tableOffset].key_xor_value = e.key ^ e.value;
    h[tableOffset].value = e.value;
}

bool data_is_present(Data const& e, HashEntry const* h, std::size_t tableOffset)
{
    auto const tmp_key_xor_value = h[tableOFfset].key_xor_value;
    auto const tmp_value = h[tableOffset].value;

    return e.key == (tmp_key_xor_value ^ tmp_value);
} HashEntry Data HashEntry key std::atomic<uint64_t> insert_data() data_is_present() true insert_data(e, h, t);

@CONTENT:I can't workout how to solve this problem so wordpress would let me upload themes. I have a fresh copy of Fedora 17 installed on my dev machine. I then installed mysql using: yum install mysql mysql-server. Next I installed WordPress which also installs apache and php: yum install wordpress I can go to http://localhost/wordpress and see WordPress working. But when I try tried to install my theme it asked for ftp credentials. I then updated the wp-config.php file and set the FS_METHOD constant to direct. Now it doesn't ask for ftp credentials but it gives me this error: Could not create directory. /usr/share/wordpress/wp-content/themes/my-theme-name/
 httpd service is running under 'apache' user and 'apache' group. The /usr/share/wordpress/ directory is recursively own by 'apache' user and 'apache' group too. I've even set the permissions to 777 (also recursively) and even then I keep getting the same error as above. How can I solve this problem?

@LINK:/questions/12505563/best-way-to-return-a-class-in-c
@TITLE:Best Way to Return a Class in C++
@CONTENT:I'm writing a C++ vector class for a project and I'm having a hard time making a decision about how best to write some of the methods. Before I start I will say that the class has a good copy constructor and assignment operator (this will be relevant in a sec). The class has a set of static methods that return vectors when I want to make sure that neither parameter is altered, they have signatures like: Vector* Vector::subtract(const Vector* v, const Vector* u)
{
    double outX = v->myX - u->myX;
    double outY = v->myY - u->myY;
    double outZ = v->myZ - u->myZ;

    return new Vector(outX, outY, outZ);
}
 The problem I am having is that I don't want to return pointers if I can help it. So instead I did some testing and realized that if I just say return Vector(outX, outY, outZ)
 and then assign the result like Vector foo = Vector::subtract(bar, temp)
 it will create a copy and work fine. Here's where my question lies: I just called the constructor twice (essentially) is there a way to get around that? Secondly, if I use this method as a argument to another method like foo.multiply(&Vector::subtract(foo, bar), 5)
 will it still create a copy or did I just pass the pointer that has gone out of scope in the Vector::subtract method? More generally, what is the best (or at least is there a better) way to do this?
@CODE:Vector* Vector::subtract(const Vector* v, const Vector* u)
{
    double outX = v->myX - u->myX;
    double outY = v->myY - u->myY;
    double outZ = v->myZ - u->myZ;

    return new Vector(outX, outY, outZ);
} return Vector(outX, outY, outZ) Vector foo = Vector::subtract(bar, temp) foo.multiply(&Vector::subtract(foo, bar), 5)

@TITLE:Using MPICH with Boost.MPI on Ubuntu
@CONTENT:I was trying to use boost.mpi under Ubuntu 12.04. apt-get will install openmpi, but some other software (involving torque) I run expect mpich2/mpich, and complain that "mpdstartup: Command not found" I certainly don't want to mess with changing the software to use openmpi and worry about migration issues when the software is upgraded. My question is, is there a user-friendly way to install boost.mpi + mpich2 in Ubuntu (12.04 LTS)? (e.g. an unofficial repository). In the worst-case, if I have to build boost from source, is there a user-friendly way to uninstall a boost installation when I upgrade to a new boost version? I liked the fact that apt-get will install files and links to well-known locations and do a clean remove when asked to. BTW, I have tried apt-get installing mpich2 first and then libboost-mpi-dev, but apt-get still installs openmpi even though there is a working mpi implementation. This seems to be somewhat constraining. Thanks,

@TITLE:How to narrow down a stack overflow exception?
@CONTENT:I have a deadline. I am googling, I am code reading, I neeed help ... My Application is throwing an EStackOverFlow. It requires an overnight test to hit the error, so I need some good ideas or it will take a long time to track down. I tried last night with MAD Except, but that didn't catch it, presumably because there was no stack for it to do so. I was running from the IDE so I broke execution and looked at the Call Stack, but it was filled with MAD except details (I have contacted the author, but there is a big time difference between us). There are no (deliberately) recursive recursive routines. No OnChange handlers (which might accidentaly change the component which they monitor, thus calling themselves recursively). No large data structures (which might be passed on the stack as parameters). My first thought is to turn off MAD Except, but I can't wait another 12 or 16 hours for a crash. Unattended, the program is doing some database access when timers expire every 30 seconds or every hour, so I have set those to 1 second, hoping to hasten the crash. Hmm, can I reduce the stack size in order to hasten the crash? If so, how? What else can I do? I have wrapped my applications main file, where forms are created and the application is run, in Try ... Except. Is there some point, such as the message handling loop, where I can check the stack size and see if it is growing "too large"? (if so, can you give details?) Any other suggestion? Thanks in advance (p.s the code is far too large to post)

@TITLE:Implicit Interface casts of Nullables
@CONTENT:With VB's Option Strict On, why does a Nullable(Of T) not require an explicit cast to an interface of T when it does require one to T? I.e. Dim x As Integer? = 5
Dim y As Integer
Dim z As IComparable

y = x ' Fails to compile with error
      ' "Option Strict On disallows implicit conversions from 'Integer?' to 'Integer'."
z = x ' Succeeds
 EDIT: As (sort of) shown by @SSS, part of the answer is that Nullable values are, well, nullable, and can be Nothing, which is fine for a reference like an interface. So this conversion will always succeed, unlike the conversion to T case (which fails when the Nullable has no value), and so it can be seen as an implicit conversion. My question now becomes "how?". How is the conversion from a Nullable(Of T) (which has no interfaces of its own) to an interface of T theoretically negotiated? I know the implementation is box Nullable<T>, which effectively strips the Nullable wrapper, but I'm confirming the concept here... (So I'll review the documentation and see if they explain this.)
@CODE:Option Strict On Nullable(Of T) T Dim x As Integer? = 5

@TITLE:Whats the Correct Way to Prompt a User for their Password?
@CONTENT:This is a follow up to this question. If I'm going to store a user's username and password with Keychain Services, should I simply create my own prompt view with an NSSecureTextField for the password, and then once the user enters their info pass it to a Keychain Services API (I found this one)? I'm concerned Apple won't like me interacting with a users sensitive data directly like that.

@LINK:/questions/12503207/issues-with-button-press-states-in-each-listview-row
@TITLE:Issues with Button press states in each ListView row
@CONTENT:I'm having problems with button presses in ListView rows. The background attribute for each Button refers to a XML selector file; in order to select a different image on button presses. I'm able to get press events from OnClickListener, but the state selector breaks and does not register presses with android:state_pressed="true" and android:state_focused="false". If I remove android:descendantFocusability="blocksDescendants" from the parent/root Layout XML for the button; then the press state will work, but will fire no matter where you touch on the ListView row, which is annoying. My problem: cannot manage the press/default states of rows separate from the buttons inside. They interfere with each other. Code: <RelativeLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
   android:id="@+id/mainListLayout"
   android:layout_width="fill_parent"
   android:layout_height="wrap_content" 
   android:descendantFocusability="blocksDescendants">
..........
 Row item button further down: <Button
        android:id="@+id/deleteButton"
        android:background="@drawable/del_button_selector"
        .....
        .....
        />
..........
 And the drawable/del_button_selector: <selector xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
    <item android:drawable="@drawable/deleteico" android:state_focused="true" android:state_pressed="false"/>
    <item android:drawable="@drawable/deletepressed" android:state_focused="true" android:state_pressed="true"/>
    <item android:drawable="@drawable/deleteico" android:state_focused="false" android:state_pressed="true" />
 Changing the drawable background in the last selector line there does not work. It will show the pressed image but it does not matter where you click on the row, away from the button. I can change the background on button click events but I need to switch back to default background upon button release, which is hard to capture(?). If I can capture press/release events in listeners then that would be great for buttons only. Any help appreciated! Thanks!

@TITLE:Set sub-features to not install by default
@CONTENT:I have an WIX installation with a feature and two subfeatures. I would like the feature to be required and the two subfeatures optional but not to install by default. Here is my feature tree: <Feature Id="A" Level="3" AllowAdvertise="no" TypicalDefault="install"

  <Feature Id="A1" Level="1" AllowAdvertise="no" />
  <Feature Id="A2" Level="1" AllowAdvertise="no" />

 I thought that adding: <Property Id="INSTALLLEVEL" Value=3 />
 would set the main feature to install and the subfeatures to not install. That isn't the case; all features are installed by default. I'm using the WixUI_FeatureTree. I wonder if that might be messing up the INSTALLLEVEL property. So is what I am attempting even possible? How can I disable the two subfeatures by default? Edit: Interesting. I set INSTALLLEVEL=1000 and tried it again and all features were still set to install. Could WixUI_FeatureTree be clobbering INSTALLLEVEL?

@CONTENT:I have some CSS I am applying to a view header and view column. Here is a sample .viewHeaderName {

color:rgb(0,0,0);

.viewColumnName {

}
 Basically I am trying to set the width of the column to what I want. I don't want the text in the header or in the column to wrap. This works perfectly for categorized views for all the columns. But for simple sorted views, the header is being offset to the right from the text in the column several characters. If I remove the width parameter in the CSS then everything lines up fine but I don't get the width I want.

@TITLE:submit not working inside <ui:repeat>
@CONTENT:I am trying to comment on status that is retrieved from the database. Whenever I am submitting the comment for specific status I am getting the exception.I have used <ui:repeat> to repeat the commandButtons. I don't know if the commandButton can be put inside <ui:repeat> or not. It would be really helpful if somebody could point out my mistake. I am having the exact same problem when I am using dataTable instead of ui:repeat. The problem is that multiple commandButton are possibly getting fired. If I am using dataTable ,suppose there is an inputText and a commandButton inside the datatable and it is repeated four times. So whenever I click the first commandButton associated with the inputText , I get exception four times,comment cannot be null. So I am assuming the commandButton is fired four times. But if I click on the fourth commandButton everything is working fine, the comment field is getting inserted in the database. 1) Here is my xhtml <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"

@TITLE:SELECT statement not returning MAX number
@CONTENT:I'm having an issue with the SELECT statement in the following code (this is in my database helper class): public Cursor selectMaxAreaNumber (long inspectionId) { 
String inspectionIdString = String.valueOf(inspectionId); 
String[] tableColumns = new String[] {  
        AREA_NUMBER,  
        "(SELECT max(" + AREA_NUMBER + ") FROM " + AREAS_TABLE + ") AS max"  
    };  
String whereClause = INSPECTION_LINK + " = ?"; 
String[] whereArgs = new String[] { 
        inspectionIdString           
    }; 
Cursor c = rmDb.query(AREAS_TABLE, tableColumns, whereClause, whereArgs,  
        null, null, null); 


if (c != null) { 
    c.moveToFirst(); 
} 
c.close(); 
return c; 
 } I then call this in my activity as follows: Cursor c = rmDbHelper.selectMaxAreaNumber(inspectionId); 
    startManagingCursor(c); 
    c.moveToFirst(); 
    nextAreaNumber = c.getInt(c.getColumnIndex("max")) + 1;
 It is pulling the maximum number from the table, so it seems the WHERE statement is failing. However, I can't see what the issue is. As part of this question, can anyone confirm if I am doing the right thing by converting the ID into a String before it is used in the query and do I need to write c.moveToFirst() in both bits? Many thanks in advance!

@LINK:/questions/12501430/multiplicities-in-ternary-relations
@TITLE:Multiplicities in ternary relations
@CONTENT:The semantics of the lower-bound multiplicities some and one in ternary relations are hard to grasp. According to Software Abstractions (Rev. ed.) pp.79-80 the relation addr: Book -> (Name -> some Addr) should be equivalent to all b: Book | b.addr in Name -> some Addr (see also p.97). But what does the latter formula exactly mean? My imagination fails here. That's why I did some experiments in the Alloy Analyser 4.1.0. The implication in this model: sig Name, Addr {}
sig Book { addr: Name -> some Addr }
assert implication {
 #Book = 0 or all n: Name | some b: Book, a: Addr | n in b.addr.a
}
check implication
 holds (no counterexample found). So if there is any Book, each Name should be registered in at least one of those Books. Undocumented Addrs are allowed, and without Books, undocumented Names suddenly appear to be allowed too. The implication in the following model: sig Name, Addr {}
sig Book { addr: Name some -> Addr }
assert implication {
  #Book = 0 or all a: Addr | some b: Book | #b.addr.a > 0
}
check implication
 holds again. It's the mirror image of the previous model: undocumented Addrs are forbidden, unless there is no Book at all. And there are no constraints with respect to the documentation of Names. Both models can be combined and formulated more concise: sig Name, Addr {}
sig Book { addr1: Name -> some Addr, addr2: Name some -> Addr }
assert implications {
  some Book implies Name in Book.addr1.Addr and Addr in Book.addr2[Name]
}
check implications
 So if there is any Book, all Names should participate in the relation addr1 and all Addrs should participate in addr2. The multiplicity one behaves alike. It seems Software Abstractions and the Analyser don't tell the same story about constructs like R: A -> (B m -> n C) as far as lower-bound constraints are concerned, but I may have missed something. The implications I found were not what I had expected, and there may be other weird implications that I haven't discovered yet.

assert implication {
 #Book = 0 or all n: Name | some b: Book, a: Addr | n in b.addr.a
}
check implication sig Name, Addr {}
sig Book { addr: Name some -> Addr }
assert implication {
  #Book = 0 or all a: Addr | some b: Book | #b.addr.a > 0
}
check implication sig Name, Addr {}

@TITLE:java - memory usage
@CONTENT:I'm developing an application which loads lots of data (like from csv). I'm creating List<List<SimpleCell>> and loading into it the readed cells. SimpleCell class contains 5 * String, every String have on average 10 characters. So I'm thinking that if I read 1000 rows - each containing 160 columns - that gives 1000*160=160 000 SimpleCell's instances - it'll be something about 160 000 * sizeof(SimpleCell.class) =~ 160 000 * 10 * 5 = 8 000 000 bytes =~ 7.63 MB. But when I'm looking at jconsole (and after clicking Perform GC) memory usage is something about 790MB. How could this be? Note that I don't store any references to any "temporary" objects. Here is the code when the memory usage rises:         for(int i = r.getFromIndex(); i <= r.getToIndex(); ++i) {
            System.out.println("Processing: 'ZZ " + i + "'");
            List<SimpleCell> values = saxRead("ZT/ZZ " + i + "");
            rows.add(values);
        }
 saxRead just creates inputStream parses it with SAX, closes stream, and returns cells (created by SAXHandler) - so there are only local variables (that I think will be garbaged in the near 'future'). I'm getting out of heap error when reading 1000 rows but I must read approximately 7k. Obviously - there's something that I don't know about jvm memory. So why memory usage is so huge when loading this relatively small amount of data?
@CODE:List<List<SimpleCell>> String String SimpleCell sizeof(SimpleCell.class) Perform GC for(int i = r.getFromIndex(); i <= r.getToIndex(); ++i) {
            System.out.println("Processing: 'ZZ " + i + "'");
            List<SimpleCell> values = saxRead("ZT/ZZ " + i + "");
            rows.add(values);
        } saxRead out of heap error values.size() 160 SAXHandler saxRead

@TITLE:String is being shown as equal to a number
@CONTENT:I'm having a strange problem in some of my php. What seems to be happening is that 0 is being shown as equal to the string "done". Here's what's happening: if(!isset($pointer)){
    $pointer = 0;   
}
error_log($pointer); //in this instance, I haven't set a pointer, returns 0
if($pointer == "done"){
    die();
}
 For some reason, the second if statement is triggering and killing the script. I can't figure out why, when $pointer is equal to 0, it is apparently also equal to "done". Is this something super easy that I'm just overlooking? I've worked around the situation, using === on the second if statement gives me the desired result, I would just like to understand why it wasn't working in the first place. Thank you for your time.
@CODE:if(!isset($pointer)){
    $pointer = 0;

@LINK:/questions/12500788/jquery-is-included-twice-in-rails-application-on-heroku
@TITLE:jQuery is included twice in Rails application on Heroku
@CONTENT:My question is similar to some other questions here which still didn't provide an answer for my situation I am including jQuery gem in my app in Gemfile: gem 'jquery-rails'
 And in application.js: //= require jquery
//= require jquery-ui
//= require jquery_ujs
...
//= require_tree .
 My development.rb has # Do not compress assets
config.assets.compress = false
# Expands the lines which load the assets
config.assets.debug = true
 My assets are not precompiled, there is no public/assets. Everything is running great locally. But when I push to heroku I get different application.js file included on the page. Instead of being a manifest file it has minified version of jQuery. Therefore I get jQuery included twice. Here is how source of my page looks like: <script src="/assets/jquery.js?body=1" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script src="/assets/jquery-ui.js?body=1" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script src="/assets/jquery_ujs.js?body=1" type="text/javascript"></script>
...
<script src="/assets/application.js?body=1" type="text/javascript"></script>
 And when I click on /assets/application.js?body=1 I see minified jQuery. When I run my app locally and click on /assets/application.js?body=1 I just see the manifest. I tried to add to development.rb  config.serve_static_assets = false
 It didn't help. I also cleared assets and cache multiple times. The only thing that works for me is setting config.assets.debug = false
 But I would like to know if there is any other option that won't affect debugging.
@CODE:gem 'jquery-rails' //= require jquery
//= require jquery-ui
//= require jquery_ujs

(d.source as RemoteCursorArray)[ind].children = data;
(d.source as RemoteCursorArray).dispatchEvent(new CollectionEvent(CollectionEvent.COLLECTION_CHANGE));

@TITLE:calculate (and validate) ethernet FCS (crc32) in vhdl
@CONTENT:I'm using the Spartan 3E Starter Kit and I'm trying to receive Ethernet frames on it via a 100?MBit link. For those who don't know, the board features a PHY chip, exposing the receiving clock with 25?MHz. I have (pretty much) verified that receiving works fine by buffering the received frames and resending them via a serial link. Furthermore, I'm using a CRC32 generator from outputlogic.com. I aggregate the received nybbles to bytes and forward them to the CRC. At the end of the frame, I latch the generated CRC and display it on the LCD, together with the CRC I found in the ethernet frame. However, (as you might have guessed) the two numbers do not match. 527edb0d  -- FCS extracted from the frame
43a4d833  -- calculated using the CRC32 generator
 The first one can also be verified by running the package through pythons crc32 function, both with the frame captured by wireshark and the frame captured and retrieved via serial port from the FPGA. I guess it must be something more or less trivial. I pasted the receiving process over here. I stripped off everything which was not neccessary. When capturing the output via serial, I added a fifo (readily made unit from Xilinx) which latched at the same time as the CRC generator to get exactly the same bytes. Does anyone have an idea what's wrong with that?

My issue is that I want to serialize with different property names. No matter what attributes I use, the object is serialized with the pre-defined property names. I've tried the following with no results: [DataMember(Name = "iTotalRecords")]
[JsonProperty(PropertyName = "iTotalRecords")]
public int TotalRecords { get; set; }
 I know "iTotalRecords" seems silly, but this action is for supporting a jQuery plugin that expects "iTotalRecords" and not "TotalRecords".

Is there anything I can do or do I have to re-think returning JsonResult as an action result?

@TITLE:Use LINQ to populate a single list from two other lists
@CONTENT:Right now, I have 2 lists(_pumpOneSpm and _pumpTwoSpm) that are the result of a database query. Now, I've been using LINQ to populate lists for me to work with for calculations. Something similar to this: var spmOne = _pumpOneSpm.Where((t, i) => _date[i].Equals(date) &&
            DateTime.Compare(_time[i], DateTime.Parse(start)) > 0 && 
            DateTime.Compare(_time[i], DateTime.Parse(end)) < 0).ToList();
 This has been fine, because I've been pulling data from one list to add specific data into another list. But now, I need pull data from two lists to add to one list. I'm curious if there is a way to do this with LINQ, or if I should just iterate through with a for loop? Here's what I've got with the for loop:         for (var i = 0; i < _pumpOneSpm.Count; i++)
        {
            if (_date[i].Equals(date))
            {
                if (DateTime.Compare(_time[i], DateTime.Parse(start)) > 0)
                {
                    if (DateTime.Compare(_time[i], DateTime.Parse(end)) < 0)
                    {
                        spmOne.Add(_pumpOneSpm[i]);
                        spmOne.Add(_pumpTwoSpm[i]);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
 This works, and does what I want. But I'm just trying to make it a bit more efficient and faster. I could use two lines similar to the first code block for each list, but that means I'm iterating through twice. So, to reiterate my question, is it possible to use a LINQ command to pull data from two lists at the same time to populate another list, or should I stick with my for loop? Thanks for any and all help. EDIT I failed to mention, that the purpose of the function utilizing these steps is to fine the MAX of _pumpOneSpm & _pumpTwoSpm. Not the max of each, but the max between them. Thus initially I was adding them into a single list and just calling spmOne.Max(). But with two LINQ queries like above, I'm running an if statement to compare the two maxes, and then return the greater of the two. So, technically they don't NEED to be in one list, I just thought it'd be easier to handle if they were.
@CODE:var spmOne = _pumpOneSpm.Where((t, i) => _date[i].Equals(date) &&
            DateTime.Compare(_time[i], DateTime.Parse(start)) > 0 && 
            DateTime.Compare(_time[i], DateTime.Parse(end)) < 0).ToList(); for (var i = 0; i < _pumpOneSpm.Count; i++)
        {
            if (_date[i].Equals(date))
            {
                if (DateTime.Compare(_time[i], DateTime.Parse(start)) > 0)
                {
                    if (DateTime.Compare(_time[i], DateTime.Parse(end)) < 0)
                    {
                        spmOne.Add(_pumpOneSpm[i]);
                        spmOne.Add(_pumpTwoSpm[i]);
                    }
                }
            }
        }

@TITLE:MVC - Rewrite URL to display domain only
@CONTENT:I am using MVC 1.0 in .NET 3.5 Framework. I have a client who would like the URL to be displayed as www.example.com instead of www.example.com/{controller}/{action}/{id}. The server that the site is hosted on is utilizing IIS 6. I do not have direct access to this server. With that in mind, can this be done? Someone suggested using ISAPI_REWRITE. I've found a few examples but none that actually explain correctly what needs to be done. Alternatively, if this cannot be done throughout the site. Can it just be done on the Home page? Below is my routing at the moment: public static void RegisterRoutes(RouteCollection routes)
{
     routes.IgnoreRoute("{resource}.axd/{*pathInfo}");
     // Catch all route
     routes.MapRoute(
     "Default", // Name

 }

Only one image is shown, and scrolling is only inside the viewpager area. Searching, I have found two solutions: setClipChildren(false);
setLayerType(View.LAYER_TYPE_SOFTWARE, null);
 set to the container of the ViewPager, and on the pager, but setLayerType works only on API 11 and up. and: android:hardwareAccelerated="false"

@TITLE:Sending NServiceBus message inside TransactionScope
@CONTENT:I am trying to use NHibernate to save to a database in the same transaction as sending a message on the bus from inside an MVC application: public void DoSomethingToEntity(Guid id)
{
    var session = _sessionFactory.OpenSession();
    CurrentSessionContext.Bind(session);

    using (var transactionScope = new TransactionScope())

    }

    session.Dispose();
}
 In the configuration, .MsmqTransport() is set with .IsTransactional(true). If I do this inside a message handler (which is wrapped in its own transaction so does not need the TransactionScope) Then it all works as expected, and if I include an exception, both fail. However, if I do it inside my own transaction in an MVC application, I get the following error after transactionScope.Complete() when leaving the using block.: 'The operation is not valid for the current state of the enlistment.'

@TITLE:jQuery pause delay timer on mouseover
@CONTENT:I am currently learning MVC3 and have been adding several jQuery scripts to my projects during my learning process, trying to learn that at the same time. Things have been going well, but in this case I can't seem to figure out exactly what I have to do to achieve the functionality I want. I have created a sample of the relevant code in this Fiddle, rather than write the code out here in several code blocks. What happens in my code is that when the button is pressed, the message div is slide out from the left, after 3 seconds it will slide away again. If the user puts their mouse over the message div while it is slid out, a message will be added. This is pretty much what I want apart from one small addition; when the user puts their mouse over the message div, I want it to stay open until they move the mouse away, then it will slide back, currently it will still slide away after the 3 seconds have been elapsed. I have tried moving .delay, adding code into the mouseout() event, but my lack of knowledge in jQuery has pretty much stopped my progression here. Could anyone explain how to do this and/or point me to some examples. Thanks very much.

@CONTENT:This is a new thread started from post (link). I have used the suggested curl library (link) for building libcurl into my dll. I link in libcurl_imp.lib and have created library routines for calling the curl methods. This all works a treat - BUT ONLY ON A 64BIT MACHINE? - if I try to run the same dll/binary app on a 32bit XP machine it just dumps out immediately. In fact all my applications abort - and they make no reference to my new library routines, they just use the dll. It seems that because I build in the cURL calls into my dll it immediately aborts the spawned process¡V I just get ¡V 1 + Done(134) testapp 5656 Abort testapp I have a printf statement immediately after main but I get no output on the command line. I then removed all my new library functions from the dll apart from one, and in this all I do is ¡V CURLcode res = curl_global_init(CURL_GLOBAL_DEFAULT); This one line causes all my apps to fail on 32bit when built into my dll ¡V comment it out and they all work. As stated, the same dll/binary works fine on my 64bit machine. The 64bit machine has the same curllib.dll runtime as the one on my 32bit machine. For info, my build machine is 32bit, we have productions machines that are both 32 and 64 bit.

 That error is thrown at the line with conn.execute(sqlusr). Of course, it worked fine in previous environment. What have I tried? connect to MS Access accdb file on Windows Server 2008 - I learned that Windows Server 2008 has MSJet preinstalled, so this question is of no use (reminder: mdb is for Access 97) http://support.microsoft.com/kb/168336 - this is actually how the connection is made but I thought that sth may be wrong, misspelled, ... I copied ODBC data sources form previous server to the new one (I kept the names) - problem still exists I installed the latest updates on Windows Server 2008 machine Additional info mdb will open only in Access 97 (why? don't ask me : / I wasn't the only one who tried to open it in Access 2000/2003/2007/2010 - it worked nowhere) application pool for this web page on IIS 7.5 has Enable 32-bit Applications option set to true.

UIManager.put("ProgressBar.selectionForeground", Color.white);
UIManager.put("ProgressBar.background", Color.white);

m_progressBar.setForeground(Color.red);
 But none of the commands seemed to have any effect!!! Unless I set m_progressBar.stringPainted(true) and then the foreground does change. Anyhows I know that the problem arises from the following command: UIManager.setLookAndFeel("com.sun.java.swing.plaf.windows.WindowsLookAndFeel"); which is invoked before the UI is initialized. So my questions are: 1) Out of curiosity: why does the the stringPainted(true) invocation manages to override foreground UI settings? 2) How do I keep UIManager.setLookAndFeel in the beginning of the code and still override UI settings? Thank you!!

@CONTENT:I'm (trying) to write a "PDF to plain text parser" and I'm using pdfKitten as an example. My PDF includes a type1 font included into the "standard 14 fonts". Subsequently the PDF font dictionary does not include keys for "Widths" "FirstChar" "LastChar". I assume, since it is one of the "standard 14 fonts" (actually 2, Courier and Courier-bold), that the iOS framework contains these metrics somewhere. How can I access these metrics?

@TITLE:Custom Methods for an Array of Custom Objects in Java
@CONTENT:I am trying to create an array of type Library, where I can store many objects of type Library that I'll manage later. Before I get too deep, I am trying to make a print() method on the array so that I can simply call myLibrary.print() to print the array. public class Library {
    // Constructor

    public Library() {
    }

    public void print() {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Library myLibrary[] = new Library[100];
        myLibrary.print();
    }
}
 I am getting an error saying that there is no print() on Library[]. How would I go about printing this array? Would I just loop through the array in the main file and call a separate print on each object? If this is the case, where would I write custom methods to sort the array? UPDATE Requirements from my assignment: "Your program will use one array of type Library to store all information read from the input file." "At the top level you will have a class called Library. Library will have three subclasses: Music, Book, and Movie. Music will have two subclasses: Song and Album. Book will have two subclasses: Fiction and Nonfiction. Movie, Fiction, Nonfiction, Song, and Album will not have any subclasses." UPDATE 2 This is for a CS-101 course. I don't feel I should need to use Comparable.

@TITLE:Overriding jQuery functions - best practice
@CONTENT:My web application is using a number of JQuery plugins such as the Datatables, and it's corresponding Row Reordering and Sorting plugins. The problem is that we need to add some fixes to account for annoying IE8 inconsistencies. So, for example, in one of the plugins _mouseDrag() method we need to add some extra logic at the start. Is there a way to override this function without modifying the plugin's source code? In an OO language you would typically override a class method, add some logic and then call the super() method to avoid modifying an API's source code. Therefore, I am wondering how we can best support this in JavaScript without modifying the library itself. Thanks Updated Question Based on the example below, how do I override my _mouseDrag function which exists as the following in the 3rd party library: (function( $, undefined ) {

$.widget("ui.sortable", $.ui.mouse, {

_mouseDrag: function (event){

...

}
 How do I override this exactly?
@CODE:(function( $, undefined ) {

$.widget("ui.sortable", $.ui.mouse, {

_mouseDrag: function (event){

@TITLE:Generating unique slug in Django
@CONTENT:I have seen a variety of different methods for generating unique slugs: Ex. 1, Ex.2, Ex. 3, Ex. 4, etc. etc. I want to create unique slugs upon saving a ModelForm. If my models are like: class Phone(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User)
    slug = models.SlugField(max_length=70, unique=True)
    year = models.IntegerField()
    model = models.ForeignKey('Model')
    series = models.ForeignKey('Series')
 Say that the Phone object has the following values (via submitted ModelForm): Phone.user = dude
Phone.year = 2008
Phone.model = iphone
Phone.series = 4S
 I want the url for this object to appear like: http://www.mysite.com/phones/dude-2008-iphone-4S 
 I understand that I should use slugify via either signals or over-riding the save method to make this happen. But if user dude creates a second 2008 iphone 4S object, what the best way to create a unique slug for this object? I want the additional objects's url to look like: http://www.mysite.com/phones/dude-2008-iphone-4S-2
 and http://www.mysite.com/phones/dude-2008-iphone-4S-3
http://www.mysite.com/phones/dude-2008-iphone-4S-4
#...etc ...
 After googling, it seems like there are a variety of different methods for creating slugs in django, which has been confusing when trying to figure out best practices. Thanks a lot for any advice and clarification on this issue!

    user = models.ForeignKey(User)

@TITLE:mvc3 dropdownlist to render partial view and persist data
@CONTENT:I am trying to have a page that renders an mvc dropdownlist and renders a partial view whenever the value in the dropdownlist changes. It is working alright until I click the button in the partial view to persist changes made in the partial view. I have the following code for my partial view - <script type="text/javascript">
    $(function () {
        $("#sortable, #sortable2").sortable({
            connectWith:  ".connectedSortable"
        }).disableSelection();        
    });

    $(function () {
        $("button").button();
        $(".submit").click(function () {
            var list = "somedata";
            var companyid = $("#myid").text();            
            $.ajax({
                url: "/Controller/Action",
                data: {
                    'values': list,
                    'id': myid
                }
            });
        });
    });

</script>

......

<div class="submit">
    <button>Submit</button>
</div>
 Here is the code for my main view - <script type="text/javascript">
    function processList() {
        var myid = $("#ddList").val();
        $.ajax({
            url: 'Controller/Action/',
            data: {
                'id': myid 
            },
            datatype: 'html',
            success: function (result) { success(result); }            
        });
    }

    function success(result) {
        $("#partial").html(result);
    }
</script>

@using (Html.BeginForm("Action", "Controller"))
{      
    @Html.DropDownListFor(x => x.SelectedValue, Model.MyEntity, new { @id = "ddList", onchange = "processList();" })


<div id="partial" style="height:  90%">

        @Html.Partial("_MyPartialView")

</div>
}
 The code from my controller is below - public ActionResult Action(int? id)
        {                        
            id = id ?? 1;    

            var vm = new MyViewModel
            {
                .....
            };
            return PartialView("_MyPartialView", vm);
        }

        public ActionResult PersistActivities(int myid, string values)
        {
            int result = _service.UpdateActivityOrderByCompany(companyid, values);                         
            return new EmptyResult();            
        }
 I want the page to re-render just the partial view when I click the persist button. Even if it just didn't do anything, that would be fine. What is actually happening is that the controller is entering the "Action" action again and then throws a rendering error. If I continue through the jquery error, just the partial view data renders in the whole window. Can anyone point out where my issues are with rendering/controller calls? I hope that is enough info. I had to trim down the code, but can provide more if necessary. Thanks for any thoughts. EDTI - the error I'm getting is in the partial view on the first function for rendering the sortable lists - Microsoft JScript runtime error: Object expected Hope that helps

@TITLE:Increasing the thickness of box lines in an R boxplot?
@CONTENT:How can I increase the thickness of the lines that outline "box" part of a boxplot using either the base R plot or boxplot function? That is, how do I thicken the lines of the box that defines the quantiles. For a plot like this: boxplot(rnorm(100,50,10), horizontal = TRUE, notch = TRUE)
 I'm guessing I need to include a pars = statement like boxplot(rnorm(100,50,10), horizontal = TRUE, notch = TRUE, pars = ...)
 EDIT: My guess regarding the use of pars = comes from a first glance at the documentation for boxplot which indicates that pars = can call "a list of (potentially many) more graphical parameters, e.g., boxwex or outpch; these are passed to bxp (if plot is true)..."
@CODE:boxplot(rnorm(100,50,10), horizontal = TRUE, notch = TRUE) pars = boxplot(rnorm(100,50,10), horizontal = TRUE, notch = TRUE, pars = ...) pars = boxplot pars = boxplot(rnorm(100,50,10), horizontal = TRUE, notch = TRUE, pars=list( boxlwd = 4)) plot boxplot

 THe latter path and value is one that I've manually created in the registry. I've checked the permissions between the two and they are the exact same. I've also tried running the app as administrator. I get a runtime error on the val= line, it says: Use the "new" keyword to create an object instance. Any ideas? All the various online examples have failed and for the life of me, I can't figure out why... Cheers, J

@TITLE:Catching (and keeping) all comments with ANTLR
@CONTENT:I'm writing a grammar in ANTLR that parses Java source files into ASTs for later analysis. Unlike other parsers (like JavaDoc) I'm trying to keep all of the comments. This is difficult comments can be used literally anywhere in the code. If a comment is somewhere in the source code that doesn't match the grammar, ANTLR can't finish parsing the file. Is there a way to make ANTLR automatically add any comments it finds to the AST? I know the lexer can simply ignore all of the comments using either {skip();} or by sending the text to the hidden channel. With either of those options set, ANTLR parses the file without any problems at all. Any ideas are welcome.

@TITLE:Given a file, how to find out which revision in a mercurial repository this is?
@CONTENT:Assume that there is a file under hg version control. I have a particular version of that file, and I would like to find out in which revision this file was in this version. I suspect that there are two possible ways to do this. Do hg update in a loop and diff the file against subsequent versions (sloooow, but should work). Make Mercurial put the rev number in a, say, comment in the second line of the file right before committing. From what I have read, a precommit hook might be of use. Then I don't have to compare anything, just look at the file itself (I'm assuming no-one will change this, of course, but this is rather safe assumption in my case). My use case is a joint paper, written in LaTeX, with two coauthors who have no idea about version control at all, but I prefer to use it (for obvious reasons). We communicate by email, and there's effectively a human-based lock system ("I will not work on this file until you send me the next version, ok?"). The only problem that arises is that I'm sending version X to author B to proofread, then author C sends me a corrected version Y and I commit it into my repo, then author B sends his corrections Z (to version X) and I'm starting to get lost-but I can check the attachment in the email sent to B, and I only need to find out which revision it is. So, my question is: which of the two ideas above would be better, or maybe there's yet another one to help me deal with this mess?

 The jenkins is installed on a debian squeeze. When i log remotely on the server and verify the target/ directory the jar created from maven is there but there is no "staging" directory. In my honest opinion i think the problem is that jenkins is unable to create the stagging repository. As usual thank you for your time. How I proceed: I am building some other jar (other jenkins job), then launch the installer to package everything. I don't know if this is enough information. If you need more information or if something is not clear enough please let me know.

@CONTENT:I have a similar issue as in this question: linq question: querying nested collections I have a Product with a ICollection<Category> and I want to get a Category by id. I everything through an IProductsRepository. I have tried both products.SelectMany(p => p.Categories).Where(c => c.CategoryID == categoryId) and products.SelectMany(p => p.Categories).First(c => c.CategoryID == categoryId) and many other variations I've tried myself. However I'm not getting it to work. At runtime I'm getting InvalidCastException. Both Category.CategoryID and categoryId are int. Would it be better to create an ICategoriesRepository?

@TITLE:Migrate WiX UI to Burn
@CONTENT:I have a working WiX installer with a custom UI using a WixUI_Mondo_MyApp.wxs file. I have to extend my installer to also run another exe installer. I understand Burn is the way to do this. I created a Burn project that chains my original MSI with the custom UI (using DisplayInternalUI="yes"), and that works fine. But I don't want two UIs popping up (the Burn default UI, and my MSI UI), and I need to get some info from the MSI UI to determine if I should install the other exe (it will listed as one of the features). I suppose the proper solution would be to migrate my UI code from my MSI to my Burn project, but I can find no docs on describing how to do this. Thanks in advance.

@TITLE:Is it possible to run js-test-driver tests that uses requirejs modules?
@CONTENT:I've been trying to use requirejs and js-test-driver along side, and I can't seen to get it working. I have a minimal configuration like this at the root : server: http://localhost:9876

load:

test:
 - src/test/js/*.js
 A "src/main/js/greeter.js" file defines a silly module : define(function(require) {

  myapp = {};

  myapp.Greeter = function() {
  };

  myapp.Greeter.prototype.greet = function(name) {
    return "Hello " + name + "!";
  };

  return myapp;
});
 And I'm trying to let require load the greeter module in a "src/test/js/greeterTest.js" : GreeterTest = TestCase("GreeterTest");

require.configure({ ???? });
require([ "src/main/js/greeter" ], function(myapp) {

  GreeterTest.prototype.testGreet = function() {
    var greeter = new myapp.Greeter();
     assertEquals("Hello World!", greeter.greet("World"));
    };

});
 Whenever I run this, I get an error because myapp is not defined when creating the Greeter. So is there a way I can configure require in this case ? I tried : setting the baseUrl property to something like file:///.... to give the location of the file using the gateway configuration to proxy the requests that requirejs might do (although I have no server running to serve the js files, so again I had to use file:///) Is there something else I should try ? Thanks

@TITLE:Deploying Node Apps via Gitolite and post-receive hook
@CONTENT:I'm trying to get a fairly simple deploy process going for a Node app using Gitolite. I have Gitolite setup and working on my server, and I'm able to push to it fine. Gitolite is running under a user called git, and I've setup a node user that I'm hoping to use to run the Node app. My plan is to push the Node app to Gitolite, and then use a post-receive hook script to move the app files to the directory where the app lives, in this case /var/local/node-apps/my-node-app/. I created the Node app folder like this: sudo mkdir -p /var/local/node-apps/my-node-app
sudo chown node /var/local/node-apps/my-node-app
 The problem is that I'm a Unix noob and I haven't got my head round file/folder permissions and wotnot. /var/local/node-apps (and also /var/local/node-apps/my-node-app) is owned by the node user, so when the git user tries to checkout to this location I get a bunch of permission denied errors. The command I'm using in the post-receive is: GIT_WORK_TREE=/var/local/node-apps/my-node-app git checkout -f
 And I get errors like this: remote: error: git checkout-index: unable to create file XXXX (Permission denied)
remote: fatal: cannot create directory at 'XXXX': Permission denied
 What's the best way to resolve this? Do I need to grant the git user password-less sudo rights to su as the node user? Or can this be somehow fixed by changing groups and folder permissions? Or a different approach entirely? I'm lost! Thanks!
@CODE:git node /var/local/node-apps/my-node-app/ sudo mkdir -p /var/local/node-apps/my-node-app

@TITLE:Custom Methods for an Array of Custom Objects in Java
@CONTENT:I am trying to create an array of type Library, where I can store many objects of type Library that I'll manage later. Before I get too deep, I am trying to make a print() method on the array so that I can simply call myLibrary.print() to print the array. public class Library {
    // Constructor

    public Library() {
    }

    public void print() {

        Library myLibrary[] = new Library[100];
        myLibrary.print();
    }
}
 I am getting an error saying that there is no print() on Library[]. How would I go about printing this array? Would I just loop through the array in the main file and call a separate print on each object? If this is the case, where would I write custom methods to sort the array? UPDATE Requirements from my assignment: "Your program will use one array of type Library to store all information read from the input file." "At the top level you will have a class called Library. Library will have three subclasses: Music, Book, and Movie. Music will have two subclasses: Song and Album. Book will have two subclasses: Fiction and Nonfiction. Movie, Fiction, Nonfiction, Song, and Album will not have any subclasses." UPDATE 2 This is for a CS-101 course. I don't feel I should need to use Comparable.

@TITLE:Overriding jQuery functions - best practice
@CONTENT:My web application is using a number of JQuery plugins such as the Datatables, and it's corresponding Row Reordering and Sorting plugins. The problem is that we need to add some fixes to account for annoying IE8 inconsistencies. So, for example, in one of the plugins _mouseDrag() method we need to add some extra logic at the start. Is there a way to override this function without modifying the plugin's source code? In an OO language you would typically override a class method, add some logic and then call the super() method to avoid modifying an API's source code. Therefore, I am wondering how we can best support this in JavaScript without modifying the library itself. Thanks Updated Question Based on the example below, how do I override my _mouseDrag function which exists as the following in the 3rd party library: (function( $, undefined ) {

$.widget("ui.sortable", $.ui.mouse, {

_mouseDrag: function (event){

...

}
 How do I override this exactly?
@CODE:(function( $, undefined ) {

$.widget("ui.sortable", $.ui.mouse, {

_mouseDrag: function (event){

@TITLE:Generating unique slug in Django
@CONTENT:I have seen a variety of different methods for generating unique slugs: Ex. 1, Ex.2, Ex. 3, Ex. 4, etc. etc. I want to create unique slugs upon saving a ModelForm. If my models are like: class Phone(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User)
    slug = models.SlugField(max_length=70, unique=True)
    year = models.IntegerField()
    model = models.ForeignKey('Model')
    series = models.ForeignKey('Series')
 Say that the Phone object has the following values (via submitted ModelForm): Phone.user = dude
Phone.year = 2008
Phone.model = iphone
Phone.series = 4S
 I want the url for this object to appear like: http://www.mysite.com/phones/dude-2008-iphone-4S 
 I understand that I should use slugify via either signals or over-riding the save method to make this happen. But if user dude creates a second 2008 iphone 4S object, what the best way to create a unique slug for this object? I want the additional objects's url to look like: http://www.mysite.com/phones/dude-2008-iphone-4S-2
 and http://www.mysite.com/phones/dude-2008-iphone-4S-3
http://www.mysite.com/phones/dude-2008-iphone-4S-4
#...etc ...
 After googling, it seems like there are a variety of different methods for creating slugs in django, which has been confusing when trying to figure out best practices. Thanks a lot for any advice and clarification on this issue!

@TITLE:mvc3 dropdownlist to render partial view and persist data
@CONTENT:I am trying to have a page that renders an mvc dropdownlist and renders a partial view whenever the value in the dropdownlist changes. It is working alright until I click the button in the partial view to persist changes made in the partial view. I have the following code for my partial view - <script type="text/javascript">
    $(function () {
        $("#sortable, #sortable2").sortable({
            connectWith:  ".connectedSortable"
        }).disableSelection();        
    });

    $(function () {
        $("button").button();
        $(".submit").click(function () {
            var list = "somedata";
            var companyid = $("#myid").text();            
            $.ajax({
                url: "/Controller/Action",
                data: {
                    'values': list,
                    'id': myid
                }
            });
        });
    });

</script>

......

<div class="submit">
    <button>Submit</button>
</div>
 Here is the code for my main view - <script type="text/javascript">
    function processList() {
        var myid = $("#ddList").val();
        $.ajax({
            url: 'Controller/Action/',
            data: {
                'id': myid 
            },
            datatype: 'html',
            success: function (result) { success(result); }            
        });
    }

    function success(result) {
        $("#partial").html(result);
    }
</script>

@using (Html.BeginForm("Action", "Controller"))
{      
    @Html.DropDownListFor(x => x.SelectedValue, Model.MyEntity, new { @id = "ddList", onchange = "processList();" })


<div id="partial" style="height:  90%">

        @Html.Partial("_MyPartialView")

</div>
}
 The code from my controller is below - public ActionResult Action(int? id)
        {                        
            id = id ?? 1;    

            var vm = new MyViewModel
            {
                .....
            };
            return PartialView("_MyPartialView", vm);
        }

        public ActionResult PersistActivities(int myid, string values)
        {
            int result = _service.UpdateActivityOrderByCompany(companyid, values);                         
            return new EmptyResult();            
        }
 I want the page to re-render just the partial view when I click the persist button. Even if it just didn't do anything, that would be fine. What is actually happening is that the controller is entering the "Action" action again and then throws a rendering error. If I continue through the jquery error, just the partial view data renders in the whole window. Can anyone point out where my issues are with rendering/controller calls? I hope that is enough info. I had to trim down the code, but can provide more if necessary. Thanks for any thoughts. EDTI - the error I'm getting is in the partial view on the first function for rendering the sortable lists - Microsoft JScript runtime error: Object expected Hope that helps

@CONTENT:How can I increase the thickness of the lines that outline "box" part of a boxplot using either the base R plot or boxplot function? That is, how do I thicken the lines of the box that defines the quantiles. For a plot like this: boxplot(rnorm(100,50,10), horizontal = TRUE, notch = TRUE)
 I'm guessing I need to include a pars = statement like boxplot(rnorm(100,50,10), horizontal = TRUE, notch = TRUE, pars = ...)
 EDIT: My guess regarding the use of pars = comes from a first glance at the documentation for boxplot which indicates that pars = can call "a list of (potentially many) more graphical parameters, e.g., boxwex or outpch; these are passed to bxp (if plot is true)..."
@CODE:boxplot(rnorm(100,50,10), horizontal = TRUE, notch = TRUE) pars = boxplot(rnorm(100,50,10), horizontal = TRUE, notch = TRUE, pars = ...) pars = boxplot pars = boxplot(rnorm(100,50,10), horizontal = TRUE, notch = TRUE, pars=list( boxlwd = 4)) plot boxplot

It also needs to take the amount of sprees and display it before. Currently it displays total sprees as 0 and only displays 20 sprees which is not random. You have won a total of 3 shopping sprees On spree #1 you may spend R100 On spree #2 you may spend R341 On spree #3 you may spend R451 TotalCost := 0; Sum := 0; ListHead := 'Max per spree is R500.00 Max number of sprees 20';
lstNumber.Items.Add(ListHead);

  SpreeWon := 'You have won  ' + inttostr(Sum) + ' shopping sprees';
  lstNumber.Items.Add(SpreeWon);

for Count := 0 to 20 do
begin
    Sum := Random(Count);
    Prize := Random(500) + 1;
    ListItems := 'On spree # ' + inttostr(Sum) + ' you may spend R' + inttostr(Prize);
    lstNumber.Items.Add(ListItems);
    TotalCost := TotalCost + Prize;
end;
begin
    Cost := 'Total prize value : R' + inttostr(TotalCost);
    lstNumber.Items.Add(Cost);
end;
@CODE:ListHead := 'Max per spree is R500.00 Max number of sprees 20';

@TITLE:vb.net 2010 - reading from registry doesn't work - win 7
@CONTENT:I thought this would be dead simple however.... Right, so all I'm simply trying to do is read a value from my registry. I have been through several examples but can't get any of them to work. I've also tried running my application in Admin mode and still nothing. Can someone please help? From all my examples that I've tried, I'll use the simplest one. This works: Dim val As String
val = Registry.LocalMachine.OpenSubKey("Hardware\Description\System\CentralProcessor\0").GetValue("Identifier").ToString()
MsgBox(val)
 This (the one I want) doesn't: Dim val As String
val = Registry.LocalMachine.OpenSubKey("SOFTWARE\PTSClient").GetValue("ConfigDB").ToString()
MsgBox(val)
 THe latter path and value is one that I've manually created in the registry. I've checked the permissions between the two and they are the exact same. I've also tried running the app as administrator. I get a runtime error on the val= line, it says: Use the "new" keyword to create an object instance. Any ideas? All the various online examples have failed and for the life of me, I can't figure out why... Cheers, J

@TITLE:Catching (and keeping) all comments with ANTLR
@CONTENT:I'm writing a grammar in ANTLR that parses Java source files into ASTs for later analysis. Unlike other parsers (like JavaDoc) I'm trying to keep all of the comments. This is difficult comments can be used literally anywhere in the code. If a comment is somewhere in the source code that doesn't match the grammar, ANTLR can't finish parsing the file. Is there a way to make ANTLR automatically add any comments it finds to the AST? I know the lexer can simply ignore all of the comments using either {skip();} or by sending the text to the hidden channel. With either of those options set, ANTLR parses the file without any problems at all. Any ideas are welcome.

Worker1 only releases the next fileName after Worker2 has finished Any ideas on how to do this? WORKING CODE AFTER COMMENTS FROM @user1666788 Code below is for the scenario stated above of two background workers where one has to wait for the other to finish before proceeding.

@TITLE:Given a file, how to find out which revision in a mercurial repository this is?
@CONTENT:Assume that there is a file under hg version control. I have a particular version of that file, and I would like to find out in which revision this file was in this version. I suspect that there are two possible ways to do this. Do hg update in a loop and diff the file against subsequent versions (sloooow, but should work). Make Mercurial put the rev number in a, say, comment in the second line of the file right before committing. From what I have read, a precommit hook might be of use. Then I don't have to compare anything, just look at the file itself (I'm assuming no-one will change this, of course, but this is rather safe assumption in my case). My use case is a joint paper, written in LaTeX, with two coauthors who have no idea about version control at all, but I prefer to use it (for obvious reasons). We communicate by email, and there's effectively a human-based lock system ("I will not work on this file until you send me the next version, ok?"). The only problem that arises is that I'm sending version X to author B to proofread, then author C sends me a corrected version Y and I commit it into my repo, then author B sends his corrections Z (to version X) and I'm starting to get lost-but I can check the attachment in the email sent to B, and I only need to find out which revision it is. So, my question is: which of the two ideas above would be better, or maybe there's yet another one to help me deal with this mess?

 The jenkins is installed on a debian squeeze. When i log remotely on the server and verify the target/ directory the jar created from maven is there but there is no "staging" directory. In my honest opinion i think the problem is that jenkins is unable to create the stagging repository. As usual thank you for your time. How I proceed: I am building some other jar (other jenkins job), then launch the installer to package everything. I don't know if this is enough information. If you need more information or if something is not clear enough please let me know.

@TITLE:InvalidCastException when querying nested collection with LINQ
@CONTENT:I have a similar issue as in this question: linq question: querying nested collections I have a Product with a ICollection<Category> and I want to get a Category by id. I everything through an IProductsRepository. I have tried both products.SelectMany(p => p.Categories).Where(c => c.CategoryID == categoryId) and products.SelectMany(p => p.Categories).First(c => c.CategoryID == categoryId) and many other variations I've tried myself. However I'm not getting it to work. At runtime I'm getting InvalidCastException. Both Category.CategoryID and categoryId are int. Would it be better to create an ICategoriesRepository? Perhaps it also has performance benefits? I'm obviously new to LINQ so not sure how to do things properly. EDIT (code samples): public interface IProductsRepository

@TITLE:Migrate WiX UI to Burn
@CONTENT:I have a working WiX installer with a custom UI using a WixUI_Mondo_MyApp.wxs file. I have to extend my installer to also run another exe installer. I understand Burn is the way to do this. I created a Burn project that chains my original MSI with the custom UI (using DisplayInternalUI="yes"), and that works fine. But I don't want two UIs popping up (the Burn default UI, and my MSI UI), and I need to get some info from the MSI UI to determine if I should install the other exe (it will listed as one of the features). I suppose the proper solution would be to migrate my UI code from my MSI to my Burn project, but I can find no docs on describing how to do this. Thanks in advance.

@TITLE:Is it possible to run js-test-driver tests that uses requirejs modules?
@CONTENT:I've been trying to use requirejs and js-test-driver along side, and I can't seen to get it working. I have a minimal configuration like this at the root : server: http://localhost:9876

load:

test:
 - src/test/js/*.js
 A "src/main/js/greeter.js" file defines a silly module : define(function(require) {

  myapp = {};

  myapp.Greeter = function() {
  };

  myapp.Greeter.prototype.greet = function(name) {
    return "Hello " + name + "!";
  };

  return myapp;
});
 And I'm trying to let require load the greeter module in a "src/test/js/greeterTest.js" : GreeterTest = TestCase("GreeterTest");

require.configure({ ???? });
require([ "src/main/js/greeter" ], function(myapp) {

  GreeterTest.prototype.testGreet = function() {
    var greeter = new myapp.Greeter();
     assertEquals("Hello World!", greeter.greet("World"));
    };

});
 Whenever I run this, I get an error because myapp is not defined when creating the Greeter. So is there a way I can configure require in this case ? I tried : setting the baseUrl property to something like file:///.... to give the location of the file using the gateway configuration to proxy the requests that requirejs might do (although I have no server running to serve the js files, so again I had to use file:///) Is there something else I should try ? Thanks

@CONTENT:I'm trying to get a fairly simple deploy process going for a Node app using Gitolite. I have Gitolite setup and working on my server, and I'm able to push to it fine. Gitolite is running under a user called git, and I've setup a node user that I'm hoping to use to run the Node app. My plan is to push the Node app to Gitolite, and then use a post-receive hook script to move the app files to the directory where the app lives, in this case /var/local/node-apps/my-node-app/. I created the Node app folder like this: sudo mkdir -p /var/local/node-apps/my-node-app
sudo chown node /var/local/node-apps/my-node-app
 The problem is that I'm a Unix noob and I haven't got my head round file/folder permissions and wotnot. /var/local/node-apps (and also /var/local/node-apps/my-node-app) is owned by the node user, so when the git user tries to checkout to this location I get a bunch of permission denied errors. The command I'm using in the post-receive is: GIT_WORK_TREE=/var/local/node-apps/my-node-app git checkout -f
 And I get errors like this: remote: error: git checkout-index: unable to create file XXXX (Permission denied)
remote: fatal: cannot create directory at 'XXXX': Permission denied
 What's the best way to resolve this? Do I need to grant the git user password-less sudo rights to su as the node user? Or can this be somehow fixed by changing groups and folder permissions? Or a different approach entirely? I'm lost! Thanks!

I had all events in XML file for now, everything works fine. Now I'm connecting my calendar app with my OWN google calendar account to fetch (read only) all events from my own Google Calendar account because I dont want to use the XML file anymore. It's not a good idea when I want to update events later on. I dont want users have to enter username/pass to connect with Google Calendar. I would like to HARDCODED it. Problems: I'm done something like this for iphone by using G-Data Google Api, it works exactly what I want to. However, G-Data Google Api is not compatible with Android. Then I searched and found ppl recommend use Google_api_java_client instead. This is link where it can connect with a google Calendar account by letting user enter username& password. However, this is not I want. I want to hard coded username and password inside my code, but they are using OAuth then I can't hard coded my username/pass. I also tried ClientLogin from this link, but it doesn't work too. It keeps throw me error "GoogleTransport cannot be resolved". I searched solution for this error, ppl recommend me back to OAuth. This is really make me confusing now. I hope someone experienced this and have solution, please help me/ guide me how to implement this on android. I just want to read data from my own google calendar account only, PLEASE not from native calendar app. Last information that I found is by sending an authenticated GET request to the allcalendars feed URL. However, I never done this, if you think it should work, please assist me with that. I really appreciated any helps. Thank you very much.

@TITLE:All UIElements become inaccessible after animation completes
@CONTENT:I am trying to implement city lights animations by having an array of CGRect's with the coordinates of each light. Then creating UIViews around these CGRects. This logic (Thanks to Darren for helping with this logic) is working fine however after the animation is complete, all other elements (UIButtons, Sliders, Other UIImageViews etc) on screen become inaccessible. Even my Swipe gestures are not responding. Before and during the animation, all elements respond well BUT once the animation is complete, they all become inaccessible. I also tried [UIView bringSubviewToFront:] to bring some of the elements in front to see if that helps to make them accessible but it didn't help. I think that's not the issue because even if I try to create the lights view by sending them to background [self.view sendSubviewToBack:light]; everything becomes inaccessible after the animation is complete. I would appreciate if someone can help/suggest me what am I missing. Here is my code logic and corresponding scene for city lights animation. rects & lits are ivars. - (void)viewDidLoad {
    pageCount=5;

@LINK:/questions/12467295/c-sharp-creating-a-base-form-with-custom-properties
@TITLE:C# Creating a Base Form with Custom Properties
@CONTENT:I am having a small issue where the defined custom property value is not sticking in the inherited form. The code in my base form is: namespace ContractManagement.Forms
{
    public partial class BaseForm : Form
    {
        public BaseForm()
        {
            InitializeComponent();
        }

        public Boolean DialogForm
        {
            get
            {
                return TitleLabel.Visible;
            }
            set
            {
                TitleLabel.Visible = value;
                CommandPanel.Visible = value;
            }
        }

        protected override void OnTextChanged(EventArgs e)
        {
            base.OnTextChanged(e);
            TitleLabel.Text = Text;
        }
    }
}
 Then in the form that inherits this I have: namespace ContractManagement.Forms
{
    public partial class MainForm : Forms.BaseForm
    {
        public MainForm()
        {
            InitializeComponent();
        }
    }
}
 For some reason, despite what I set in MainForm for DialogForm, on runtime it reverts back to True. There is another post on this site which mentions this, but I don't get what it explains. I also want to create a property which allows me to hide the ControlBox, so how do I add this in?
@CODE:namespace ContractManagement.Forms
{
    public partial class BaseForm : Form
    {
        public BaseForm()
        {
            InitializeComponent();
        }

        public Boolean DialogForm
        {
            get
            {
                return TitleLabel.Visible;
            }
            set
            {
                TitleLabel.Visible = value;
                CommandPanel.Visible = value;
            }
        }

        protected override void OnTextChanged(EventArgs e)
        {
            base.OnTextChanged(e);
            TitleLabel.Text = Text;
        }
    }
} namespace ContractManagement.Forms
{
    public partial class MainForm : Forms.BaseForm
    {
        public MainForm()
        {
            InitializeComponent();
        }

@LINK:/questions/12467241/rest-and-links-middle-ground
@TITLE:REST and links: middle ground?
@CONTENT:I've been wondering about how far to go with links in REST. Consider books which have authors, but there is obviously a many-to-many relationship between books an authors (a book can be written by multiple authors, and authors can write multiple books). So let's say we have a rest call http://server/book/21, which will return a book XML, containing information about an author. Now since the book is a resource, and the author is a resource, the XML should not straight up include all the author information. It should contain a link to the author information. But which of the below two examples is more widely accepted? (Excuse my crappy formatted XML, I am not that experienced with hand writing XML) <book>
  <title>Some Book</title>
  <authors>
    <author link="http://server/author/82">Some Guy</author>
    <author link="http://server/author/51">Some Other Guy</author>
  </authors>
</book>
 Then, an author link would return more information: <author>
  <name>Some Guy</name>
  <dateOfBirth>some time</dateOfBirth>
</author>
 Or: <book>
  <title>Some Book</title>
  <authors>http://server/book/21/authors</authors>
</book>
 Where http://server/book/21/authors returns: <authors>
  <author link="http://server/author/82">Some Guy</author>
  <author link="http://server/author/51">Some Other Guy</author>
</authors>
 And then each of those returns the former <author> example again. The reason I'm asking is basically because at my job they went with the second approach, and it seems to me that clients have to take many more steps to reach where they want to go. Also, for basic information which "you're always going to need" (author's name), you do have to take one additional step. On the other hand, that way the book resource only returns information about the book (nothing else), and to get anything else, you have to access other resources.
@CODE:http://server/book/21 <book>
  <title>Some Book</title>
  <authors>
    <author link="http://server/author/82">Some Guy</author>
    <author link="http://server/author/51">Some Other Guy</author>

@TITLE:Embed a Cakephp form into Wordpress
@CONTENT:I have a Wordpress blog and I'm developing a backend application using Cakephp. I want to develop the blog's contact form using cake (since the entered information will be available from the backend app). Right now, I tried including the cake view into wp using ajax. The problem with this approach is that I either use a Js->submit, which makes attaching files to the form quite complicated, or I use a Form->submit, which makes displaying validation errors problematic. Also, it creates problems with the recaptcha plugin not showing up. Is there a way of integrating the form using php? I don't need authentication (it is a public form), but I need to be able to show validation errors on the form and upload files on the form.

@TITLE:Getting Formtastic in ActiveAdmin to use custom form input builder
@CONTENT:UPDATE: So, I've found this, and apparently that's why this old way of doing things isn't working, ActiveAdmin must use Formtastic 2.x. As directed, I've now created a file in app/inputs/date_picker_input.rb that looks like this: class DatePickerInput
  include Formtastic::Inputs::Base

  def to_html
    puts "this is my datepickerinput"
  end
end
 And my controller now looks like this:   f.input :open_date, :as => :date_picker
  f.input :close_date, :as => :date_picker
 But now I'm running into this error: ActionView::Template::Error (undefined method 'html_safe' for nil:NilClass): 1: render renderer_for(:edit) Any thoughts? I've ran into a problem with Formtastic automatically formatting dates into a format I'm not wanting (Y-m-d h:i:s Z) when I try to render :as => string so I can use a datepicker on the field. In trying to solve this, I came across this solution. It seems to make sense and is the exact same problem I am dealing with. However, I don't seem to be able to implement the fix, and I'm wondering if it's because Formtastic is being used through ActiveAdmin. So, here's what I've tried to do: In the controller, I've changed the method as such: f.input :open_date, :as => :date I also tried this, though my problem is not even being able to get to this point: f.input :open_date, :as => :date_input I created a file at lib/datebuilder.rb with the following code: class DateBuilder < Formtastic::SemanticFormBuilder 
  def date_input(method, options) 
    current_value = @object.send(method) 
    html_options ||= {:value =>  current_value ? I18n.l (current_value) : @object.send("#{method}_before_type_cast")} 
    self.label(method, options.delete(:label), options.slice (:required)) + 
    self.send(:text_field, method, html_options) 
  end 
end 
 I'm not sure that will even fix the format as I want, but I assume if I can just get Formtastic to use this method I can alter it as needed (currently took this from the solution mentioned in link above). This article mentions you need to add a line to your formtastic intializer to use this custom input: Formtastic::SemanticFormHelper.builder = Formtastic::DateBuilder I did not have this initializer file in config/initializers so I added it (config/initializers/formtastic.rb) with the line above. The problem I am now running into is this error when trying to startup the Rails app: ../config/initializers/formtastic.rb:1:in '<top (required)>': uninitialized constant Formtastic::SemanticFormHelper (NameError) I have also tried this syntax in that file instead: module Formtastic
  module SemanticFormHelper
    self.builder = DateBuilder
  end
end
 which gives me this error instead: ../config/initializers/formtastic.rb:3:in '<module:SemanticFormHelper>': uninitialized constant Formtastic::SemanticFormHelper::DateBuilder (NameError) If I'm going about this in completely the wrong way please let me know, otherwise any help on getting Formtastic to use this custom input type would be amazing!

@TITLE:Android in-app billing cancel payment, application not active
@CONTENT:I'm having trouble figuring out how the in-app billing process is supposed to work for broadcast events when the application isn't running. I have a managed product setup and as far as I can see, is working well. With a test account I'm able to purchase my published component and my test application handles it, retaining its state. I then cancel this order via my merchant account and the application again receives the event and removes the item. The problem occurs when instead of cancelling the order while the application is active. I exit out of it (not with home, with multiple back buttons). If I cancel the item now, my 'device' gets a notification 'purchase failed', but when I start my application nothing seems to happen and thus the state of the item is still purchased. I'm not sure if billing service is still running or not. Given the documentation says my application must send back a CONFIRM_NOTIFICATIONS or it keeps sending it I can only assume it is. However why is it unable to interact with my database and remove the item like it does correctly if the application is active? I hope tihs is clear, and I apologize if it has been discussed before, I couldn't find anything in my searches.

I tested out my code in pure JavaScript and it works perfectly. But when using jQuery it fails. Here is my test code: function speak(words, callback){
  for(var i=0;i<10000;i++){
      console.log(words);
  }
  if(callback)
    callback.call();
}

console.log(window['speak']);?
 Here is a link to the pure JavaScript version which works. Here is a link to the jQuery version which doesn't work. What do I need to do to make this work in jQuery?
@CODE:function speak(words, callback){
  for(var i=0;i<10000;i++){
      console.log(words);
  }
  if(callback)
    callback.call();
}

console.log(window['speak']);?

I want to ignore all other dates that aren't the max(date) with respect to each id. Here's what I'd like the table to look like: ID       Date       Value

@TITLE:how to create dynamic listview and set visibility of Textview
@CONTENT:I'm new to Android development. I successfully created a demo project with a dynamic listview but now my problem is that I have two textviews in my list_row xml file. Textview2 is default hide(Visibility=Gone). Now I set the visibility of that textview visible only in fifth position in listview. I wrote code for that but the textview shows up randomly, not just in the fifth position. I have 100 records in the listview. What am I doing wrong? EDIT : public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent) 
{
    // TODO Auto-generated method stub
    ViewHolder holder;

    if (convertView == null) 
    {
        convertView = mLayoutInflater.inflate(R.layout.list_row, null);
        holder = new ViewHolder();
        holder.text1 = (TextView) convertView.findViewById(R.id.mytext);
        holder.text2 = (TextView) convertView.findViewById(R.id.invisibletext);
        convertView.setTag(holder);

@TITLE:64-bit G++ 4.6.3 doesn't treat longs as long longs in specialised function templates, even though they're the same size. Is this a bug?
@CONTENT:Consider the following code: #include <iostream>
#include <cinttypes>  

template<class T>
void f();

template<>
inline void f<long long>() {
  std::cout<<"f<long long>()"<<std::endl;
}

int main(int , char** ) {
  std::cout<<"sizeof(long)="<<sizeof(long)<<std::endl;
  std::cout<<"sizeof(long long)="<<sizeof(long long)<<std::endl;
  f<int64_t>();
  return 0;
}
 32-bit G++ 4.6.3 compiles this successfully and produces the output: sizeof(long)=4
sizeof(long long)=8
f<long long>()
 Compiling under 64-bit G++ 4.6.3 however produces the linker error: undefined reference to `void f<long>()'
ld returned 1 exit status
 even though compiling and running with the f<int64_t>() line commented out produces: sizeof(long)=8
sizeof(long long)=8
 Is there a good reason why 64-bit G++ treats f<long> and f<long long> as different functions, even though long and long long are the same size, or is this a bug that I should report?
@CODE:#include <iostream>
#include <cinttypes>

@TITLE:Aligning thumbnails along columns using twitter-bootstrap
@CONTENT:I have been playing with twitter-bootstrap to create my photography page. I am using the default thumbnail class within li tags to create the border and align them. I have a whole bunch of thumbnails with images which are both horizontal and vertical. The default settings really does not create a pretty layout of the thumbnails. By adding fixed height in the thumbnail's CSS, at least a neat grid gets formed now. However, within the thumbnail block, the images always align to the top. This leads to odd shaped grids when there is a vertical image in the stack. I tried adding "vertical-align: middle;" within the thumbnail class, but does not seem to be working. I am pretty new to CSS, so kindly pardon me if I am missing something really obvious.

I checked in developer tool and find that those text have inherit the correct font size, but still rendered 5px bigger in the computed style. I find this post Fix font size issue on Mobile Safari (iPhone) where text is rendered inconsistently and some fonts are larger than others? but -webkit-text-size-adjust doesn't work for me here. I have checked in different mobile browsers including Dolphin, Opera Mobile and Safari, all rendered the text correctly except Chrome mobile.

@CONTENT:I'm trying to check and see if a specific user has permissions on a specific Service Application, but I'm not having much luck. So far, I have managed to check if the current user has permissions with code similar to the following: SPCentralAdministrationSecurity security = serviceApp.GetAdministrationAccessControl();
var acl = security.ToAcl();
bool hasAccess = acl.DoesUserHavePermissions(SPCentralAdminRights.FullControl);
 However, like I said, I need to check the permission of a specific user, not necessarily the current user. Does anyone know of a way to accomplish this? Edit: I somehow didn't realize that acl was actually a list. I looped through it to find the administrators for the service application, which is half the battle! But I still need to find the accounts listed under Permissions to see which accounts have access to invoke the service app. Any help is appreciated.

@TITLE:AVPlayer doesn't resume playback on endinterruption on iPhone but does so on iPad
@CONTENT:I'm writing a radio app for both iPhone and iPad and am running into some weird behaviour when handling pausing and playing the audio with interruptions. I'm using the AVAudioSessionDelegate methods beginInterruption and endInterruption to respectively pause and play the AVPlayer. Below is the relevant play code. Now, the following situations seem to happen consistently: On iPad: If I force an interruption (Facetime call), beginInterruption is called as expected and playback stops. If the interruption stops, endInterruption is called as expected, and the playback resumes as expected. On iPhone: Pressing the play and pause button, triggers pause and play exactly the same as beginInterruption and endInterruption would. Playback behaves as expected. On iPhone: Forcing an interruption (by calling the phone), calls endInterruption as expected and playback pauses as expected. However, when the interruption is finished, beginInterruption is called as expected, play is called as expected, it actually reaches and executes the [self.player play] line, but playback does not resume! I hear nothing. Situation 3 above is extremely weird, so I'm wondering if I may have overlooked something. Any ideas? Play code - (void)play { 
NSError* error = nil;
AVKeyValueStatus keyStatus = [currentAsset statusOfValueForKey:@"tracks" error:&error];
if(error){
    DLog(@"Error %@", [error localizedDescription]);
}
else {

@CONTENT:In my application I need to delete an element from an array. However I am new to JS. I searched the web and every blog post was talking about splice() method. So I considered to used it, but it has a very strange behavior. Here the post I found : http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_splice.asp http://viralpatel.net/blogs/javascript-array-remove-element-js-array-delete-element/ Here is my Test: it("should delete all elements in array", function () {
    var ary = new Array();

    for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        ary[i] = Math.random();
    }

    expect(ary.length).toBe(10);

    for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        ary.splice(i, 1);
    }

    expect(ary.length).toBe(0);

});
 And here is the result of the test:   Firefox 15.0.1 Linux: Run 7 tests (Passed: 6; Fails: 1; Errors 0) (44.00 ms)

 I use angular JS. Thanks very much for replies. Here is another test that just don't pass: var ary = new Array();

        ary = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'];

        ary.splice(0, 1);

        ary.splice(1, 1);

        ary.splice(2, 1);

        ary.splice(3, 1);

        expect(ary.length).toBe(0);

@TITLE:iPhone Application Support Folder Include Files BEFORE Building
@CONTENT:I have an iPhone app that programmatically gets a path to the Application Support Folder, tests for a file in the application support folder, and then either loads the file or creates a new one depending on the result. This is easy and there are a ton of tutorials on how to do this. But I can't for the life of me find anything in the ios documentation or online about how to put a file in the Application Support Folder before ever building the app. I tried creating a Library/Application Support in my apps Xcode folder to no avail. Specifically, I am making a game, and I want to include level packs in the game's Library/Application Support folder BEFORE I build and run the application. Preferably by dragging and dropping the files in Finder. Is this possible? @Vimal Venugopalan EDIT: As Vimal mentioned, I could use [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:ofType:inDirectory:] method, but this gives a path similar to "~/MyApp.app/MyFolder/MyFile.plist". That is if "~" was the path to the app's home directory. Or more specifically "~" is the path returned by calling the NSHomeDirectory(); function. Where I want to put my files is in "~/Library/Application Support/MyFolder/MyFile.plist" I want the files in this spot because I want to incorporate level-packs into my game. I want to include some level packs with the app download, and I would eventually like to have additional downloadable level-packs. Now the downloaded level packs definitely have to go in the "~/Library/Application Support/" folder (which I know how to do programmatically), so I would like to include the original level-packs in the same place before building and running the app. It would be so much simpler to have all my level-packs in one place!

 There's couple of problems with this example: It puts scrollbars into the wrong place #content instead of body. The body, #wrapper nor #content get a proper height calculated. Expected is 522px instead of 227px. (screenshot below). So the actual problem is I need the page to get the height of the content of the #info-block element. Tried may different setting, all fail. The one solution that works - is using jQuery and comparing the height of the #info-block against the height of the body, and apply it recursively to the body, #wrapper and #content. But this is just wrong. Looking for CSS only solution. And, I can't get rid of position:absolute property of #info-block element, because it's a part of interactive horizontal accordion. Thanks in advance.

 :After this it doesn't quit, it just seems to hang... Zeus is like Spork only more so. It lets you load your application in the background so things like tests run really fast. https://github.com/burke/zeus My colleagues and I are struggling to get it to work. Here is the list of commands you would type on a brand new mac to get to where I am now, though perhaps I missed something? THE MIGHTY LIST #The github links below contain guides, this assumes they are followed, with the exception that variables go in .zshrc rather than .zshenv
#Install ZSH | https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh | This means I ditch paths into .zshrc rather than .bash_profile etc
#Install RBENV | https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv | Colleague using RVM is also having problemos
#Install ruby-build | https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build | handy for installing ruby versions
#Continue setting up RBENV and install Bundler | https://gist.github.com/1384279 | Bundler manages the gems, no need for rbenv bundler
# Install patched ruby version using Rbenv and ruby-build | https://gist.github.com/1688857 | "rbenv versions" should show something like:
> rbenv versions
  1.9.3-p194
* 1.9.3-p194-perf (set by /Users/joe/.rbenv/version)
# Rehash
rbenv rehash
# Reload .zshrc, as have added parameters to it following the gist guide for installing 194-perf
exec $SHELL
# Zeus expects a few things, rails should install to ~/.rbenv/versions/1.9.3-p194-perf/bin i think
gem install rails
# The init file Zeus.json mentions cucmber and rspec, so they need to be install globally in rbenv rather than just locally bundled in your projects
gem install cucumber
gem install rspec
rbenv rehash
zeus init
zeus start
# Later, when I get zeus to work globally, I will:
##git pull project_stuff to ~/my_project
cd my_project
rbenv local 1.9.3-p194-perf
bundle install
rbenv rehash
zeus init
zeus start
 Also tried rebooting SOLUTION SUMMARY This problem was because i was trying to start zeus in the home folder rather than my_project folder. Doing it in there gives a different error though, it hangs. Moved to Ruby Rails 1.9.4 Zeus server hangs after ZEUS START

Will it be possible to use cookies only for refreshing the page and not after navigating to other page? If yes, how?

@TITLE:Force Closed with Null Pointer Exception in Android
@CONTENT:I have this below code which I am trying to test out on the Emulator firstly just to make sure, it is working fine, then I can start testing it on real device. Below code creates a Google Map on the top half of the Android screen and in the Bottom Half the TextView. As far as I know whenever you start your application having Google Map, you need to pass the latitude and longitude co-ordinates from the DDMS perspective. But in my case, I am not passing any location co-ordinates and this below program is throwing NULL POINTER EXCEPTION at this line- mScreenPoints = mapView.getProjection().toPixels(pointToDraw, mScreenPoints);
 I am not sure why is it happening, As far as I know, Google Map should get loaded firstly, and then it should wait to pass the location coordinates from the DDMS perspective, but as soon as I launch my application, I get force closed with the NPE. Any thoughts why is it happening? Below is the full code- private MapView mapView;
private ListView listView;

@Override
public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

    mapView = (MapView) findViewById(R.id.mapView);
    listView = (ListView) findViewById(R.id.mylist);

    locationManager = (LocationManager) getSystemService(Context.LOCATION_SERVICE);    

    locationListener = new GPSLocationListener(mapView);

    locationManager.requestLocationUpdates(
            LocationManager.GPS_PROVIDER, 
            35000, 
            0, 
            locationListener);


    mapView.setStreetView(true);
    mapView.setBuiltInZoomControls(true);
    mapController = mapView.getController();
    mapController.setZoom(15);
}
 Location Update class-     private class GPSLocationListener implements LocationListener {

    MapOverlay mapOverlay;

    public GPSLocationListener(MapView mapView) {
        mapOverlay = new MapOverlay(this,android.R.drawable.star_on);
        List<Overlay> listOfOverlays = mapView.getOverlays();
        listOfOverlays.add(mapOverlay);
    }

    @Override
    public void onLocationChanged(Location location) {
        if (location != null) {
            GeoPoint point = new GeoPoint(
                    (int) (location.getLatitude() * 1E6), 
                    (int) (location.getLongitude() * 1E6));

            mapController.animateTo(point);
            mapController.setZoom(15);

            mapOverlay.setPointToDraw(point);

 Below is the class which draws a Circle on the Map at the Current Location and NPE happening in this class only-     class MapOverlay extends Overlay {
    private GeoPoint pointToDraw;
    int[] imageNames=new int[6];
    private Point mScreenPoints;
    private Bitmap mBitmap;

        mCirclePaint = new Paint(Paint.ANTI_ALIAS_FLAG);
        mCirclePaint.setColor(0x30000000);
        mCirclePaint.setStyle(Style.FILL_AND_STROKE);
        mBitmap = BitmapFactory.decodeResource(getResources(),imageNames[0]);
        mScreenPoints = new Point();
    }

    public void setPointToDraw(GeoPoint point) {
        pointToDraw = point;
    }

    public GeoPoint getPointToDraw() {
        return pointToDraw;
    }

    public boolean draw(Canvas canvas, MapView mapView, boolean shadow, long when) {
        super.draw(canvas, mapView, shadow);

                   // NPE happening here
        mScreenPoints = mapView.getProjection().toPixels(pointToDraw, mScreenPoints);

        int totalCircle=4;
        int radius=40;
        int centerimagesize=35;

        for (int i = 1; i <= totalCircle; i ++) { 
            canvas.drawCircle(mScreenPoints.x,mScreenPoints.y, i*radius, mCirclePaint); 
        } 

        canvas.drawBitmap(mBitmap, (mScreenPoints.x-(centerimagesize/2)),(mScreenPoints.y-(centerimagesize/2)), null);
        super.draw(canvas,mapView,shadow);

        return true;
    }
}
 Update:- I found the problem, I guess when I add the overlay to the list, it will always start drawing immediately. It doesn't matter whether or not I get a location. How can I have a safe and efficient way to add the to not add the overlay until there is a location to set.?

@LINK:/questions/12451641/how-to-change-the-css-after-image-lazy-loading-jquery
@TITLE:How to change the CSS after image lazy loading (jQuery)? [closed]
@CONTENT:I've got the following problem: after the user clicks on a thumbnail image, a bigger image is loaded with lazy loading and opens up. The code to load the bigger image is: <img width="663" height="845" class="big" data-original="real/path/to/image" src="path/to/empty/small/picture">
 When the user clicks on a thumbnail image, the following code is executed: $("img.thumb").click(function() 
 {      
    var $cont = $(this).siblings('.item-content').children('.big'); 
    $cont.attr('src', $cont.attr("data-original"));
    setTimeout(function(){
        $cont.css({'height': 'auto', 'width': '100%'});
    }, 600);
 });
 Each big image has to have the CSS "height" set to "auto", and the "width" set to "100%" because I am making a responsive/fluid layout. The above code gets its "src" attribute value from the "data-original" attribute. But "height: auto" and "width:100%" are set in this example to 600ms after the attributes do their replacing. This doesn't work, because I am using Isotope jQuery plugin (http://isotope.metafizzy.co/) for this and this plugin needs the real width and height of the element to position the grid properly. When "height: auto" and "width:100%" are set during the loading of an image, the plugin gets lost and makes positions the elements incorrectly. So how do code this to set those 2 CSS properties after the image has loaded?
@CODE:<img width="663" height="845" class="big" data-original="real/path/to/image" src="path/to/empty/small/picture"> $("img.thumb").click(function() 
 {      
    var $cont = $(this).siblings('.item-content').children('.big'); 
    $cont.attr('src', $cont.attr("data-original"));
    setTimeout(function(){
        $cont.css({'height': 'auto', 'width': '100%'});
    }, 600);
 }); "height" "auto" "width" "100%" "src" "data-original" "height: auto" "width:100%" 600ms "height: auto" "width:100%" $container.isotope('reLayout');

@TITLE:A distributed algorithm to assign a shared resource to one node out of many
@CONTENT:I try to implement a multicast communication to distribute some resources. I¡¦m using jGroups for that, so I have reliable multicast and FIFO-Ordering. By doing that I wanna realise that with a distributed solution, that means without an master node that acts as a coordinator. Every node is able to start a distribution, so it is possible that two or more nodes are starting the distribution at the same time. When a node receives a distribution-message it will answer this. There are no differences between an answer-message and a message from a starter. It only contains information about the resource-name (e.g. resourceA) and if that node is able to handle it. When Member1 starting the distribution it will send a message like: Member1, resourceA, OK
 Member2 has no space for that resource and send a answer-message like: Member2, resourceA, NOT_OK
 In this case it is easy, because now Member1 knows that he can takes resourceA. When more than one node are able to handle the resource other properties will decide who takes the resource (e.g. the member with the highest ID). My problem is: How ta handle it when two or more nodes are starting the distribution about the same topic (resourceA) at the same time? Does anybody see some problems doing it this way: Member1 and Member2 are starting the distribution at the same time. At this point both are expecting a response from each other. Because of the fact that there are no differences in a response-message or in a starter-message both are thinking the message they just received is an answerer. So Member1 sends a starter-message into the multicast-group and Member2 sends a starter-message into the mutlicast-group (before receiving the message from Member1). Now Member1 is receiving the starter-message from Member2 and thinks that this is the response. By guarantee that every node sends only one message per topic (as a starter or with a response) I would say that there are no problems doing it this way even when there are more than two nodes.

@CONTENT:I am building an Apple developer analytics app, which displays info stored in itunesconnect Daily Sales Reports. Thus I would like to automatically download these Daily Sales Reports (which I achieved by using this script). This app will be released on the Mac App Store and is sandboxed. Am I allowed to ask for and store a user's itunesconnect password? If so, what is the correct way to do it? EDIT: Thank you James and Michael, Keychain Services is definitely the way to go. I do have one follow up question.

 Say that I want to grab the contents of $wife{"Jacob"} in a list. How can I do that? If I try: $key = "Jacob";
say $wife{$key};
 I get: ARRAY (0x56d5df8)

@CONTENT:In the TListView control, you can edit an item by clicking on it twice. A box appears around the item for user to type in a new value. How can I enable edit mode programmatically? I would like to protect the list from accidental editing, and disable editing (by enabling the ReadOnly property). Then, when the user presses an Edit button, the item will become active to edit. How can I do this? Also, if suppose the user selects an item, then scrolls out of that item's view, then presses Edit, the list needs to first scroll to make that item visible.

@TITLE:Plot multiple figures in background
@CONTENT:I have a MATLAB code that plots multiple figures at the same time. The general trick to achieve the same is to call figure(figHandle) and then make a call to plot, for e.g. figure(h1);
plot(...args...);
figure(h2);
plot(...args...);
 However, I want to do this plotting without bringing figures into foreground everytime I make a call to figure(figHandle). All I want to do is to plot multiple figures simultaneously without bringing them into visibility and export them to an excel sheet (I have figured out exporting to excel sheet part) in the end. The problem is there are too many figures (around 100) and I have to manually close them down. All I want in the end is an excel sheet with figures exported. Thanks.

 And the provider and the modification to User class (as in the Readme). But the problem is that the service not seemed to be called.

The method is called and of course I get this error : LogicException: The controller must return a response (null given). Did you forget to add a return statement somewhere in your controller?

@CONTENT:I have an applet that was originally built with JBuilder long time ago. I believe it worked fine until fairly recently. It has stopped working. I have imported it to Eclipse to debug, and found that public static void main() is not called. This can explain the applet's crash. My hunch is that the newer JVM does not call public static void main() for applets. Could anyone shed some light on this?

@TITLE:Working on two unrelated files in separate git branches
@CONTENT:I recently started working on a project which uses Git for version control. I have to fix two defects, Defect1 and Defect2. Fixes for Defect1 and Defect2 need changes to File1 and File2 respectively. These two files are unrelated to each other. I want to work on each defect in a separate Git branch. I created two branches, fix_Defect1 and fix_Defect2, and want to work on them independently. The fixes are complex, so I cannot complete one fix and commit it before switching to the other. I observe that when I switch from fix_Defect1 to fix_Defect2, any changes made to File1 also appear (and vice versa). Is there some way to avoid this from happening? From the Git help, I could not figure out any way. I also searched on SO for git work with multiple branches, and found Git & Working on multiple branches and Using git with multiple branches at once, which are close but somewhat different from my question. I can clone multiple copies of the repository per branch in a separate directory, but it seems like I would be missing the full power of Git branching by doing so, besides wasting disk space. Could you please suggest a good approach to handle this scenario?

@LINK:/questions/12446407/prolog-find-n-prime-numbers
@TITLE:Prolog Find N prime numbers
@CONTENT:I have a problem with the recursive function of Prolog. I believe I am not implementing it right and need help. I need to generate the first N prime numbers and return it in a list. Generating the prime number is not an issue, but rather, generating it in a list is the issue I have. This is the part of the relevant code: genList(_, 0, _).

genList(X, N, PrimeList, PrimeList):-
    N > 0,
    isprime(X),
    X1 is X +1,
    N1 is N -1,
    genList(X1,N1,[X|PrimeList], [X|PrimeList]),!.

genList(X, N, PrimeList, PrimeList):-
    N>0,
    \+isprime(X),
    X1 is X + 1,
    genList(X1,N,PrimeList, PrimeList).
 This is what I type into the Prolog intepreter: genList(1,N, [],L).
 For the 1st line, how do I make the base case such that when N=0, I stop recursing? Is this correct? As for the next 2 clauses, I am having difficulty in thinking in terms of logic programming. I definitely feel that this is not logic programming style. I want to say that when isPrime(X) fails, we continue to the next number without saving anything, but when isPrime(X) is true, then we recurse and continue to the next number, saving X. How do I do that in Prolog?
@CODE:genList(_, 0, _).

genList(X, N, PrimeList, PrimeList):-
    N > 0,
    isprime(X),

    X1 is X + 1,

@TITLE:matplotlib: Qt4Agg toolbar's irritating bug
@CONTENT:I am using the Qt4Agg (PyQt4) as the backend for rendering plots in matplotlib. This has a very useful toolbar with a very useful button 'Edit curve lines and axes parameters'. However, whenever I press it, it gives an error. (I know that it is useful as it works for bar graphs, but not for line plots :P). The cause and traceback can be seen clearly in the picture below. I thought this might be a bug the current version of matplotlib so I tried this on the latest version of the same but it still gives the same error. This is simplest script which gives the same error (plot will be different from above) - import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(range(10))
plt.show()
 (I have configured the backend through the configuration file /etc/matplotlibrc) Please help me fix this problem.

@TITLE:How can I prevent a wpf ribbon group from fully collapsing without specifying all combinations of size definitions?
@CONTENT:How can I prevent a wpf ribbon group from fully collapsing? I realise there is a RibbonGroup.GroupSizeDefinitions property (it's discussed here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff701790.aspx) and if I define a bunch of RibbonGroupSizeDefinition and none with isCollapsed=true it does close to what I want. Unfortunately I don't want to have to define the size definitions because the buttons shown will vary depending on the users license. eg. one client may get six buttons in a group and one might have four. So I want it to auto setup the groups but never go into fully collapsed - is this possible?

@TITLE:Is ECB a safe option if you don't expect duplicate results?
@CONTENT:I want to encrypt long paragraphs of text using Rijndael-256 (the text has been compressed and converted to base64 before this). It is very unlikely for the two to be the same. But if they happen to be, would adding a random key to the start or end of the text secure it (regardless of whether they're the same), just in case users write the same text? If I make sure that no results are 100% the same, is ECB safe if you won't get duplicate results? Or is it like this: (using base64... not accurate, just an example) _Hello world_ = ahjkIOn25o

_To echo "Hello world,"_ = qw90klnN2_ahjkIOn25o_kL3

_Hello world is the_ = _ahjkIOn25o_hjAB27
 So if someone has a phrase hidden inside their text, it would always output the same ECB for that piece, no matter what else is in the text, or the phrase's position in the text?

 By replacing email and firstname, they are able to add multiple users to the database and potentially with a script thousands. Is there any way to prevent this without using a captcha? We are trying to be very minimal and open with the site's design so would love some input if this is possible.

@TITLE:Permission denied while binding socket
@CONTENT:It's me again from Running Python server forever. I did upload my file to the server, but I get this: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./application", line 42, in <module>
    s.bind((TCP_IP, TCP_PORT))
  File "<string>", line 1, in bind

 For your reference, the code is here: ...

TCP_IP = ''
TCP_PORT = 9090
BUFFER_SIZE = 256

s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.bind((TCP_IP, TCP_PORT))
s.listen(1)
while True:
    conn, addr = s.accept()
    ClientThread(conn, addr).start()
 When the socket binds to port 9090, (or any other port for that matter), it just returns this exception. I don't need to be root, because port > 1024. What should I change? Is the problem in TCP_IP or TCP_PORT? ~Chance

@LINK:/questions/12443312/listview-not-populating-or-webview-taking-up-entire-screen
@TITLE:ListView not populating, or WebView taking up entire screen?
@CONTENT:I have code that should populate my ListView in my UrlListFragment, but when I run it I see no effect. I put the problem aside to work on my WebView, and found that once I load a URL it uses the entire screen. I'm not sure if this means my ListView isn't being populated, so it doesn't take up space, so the WebView takes up the entire screen, or if the WebView is taking up the entire screen regardless of whether the ListView is being populated or not. I populate my ListView like this:     View returnView = inflator.inflate(R.layout.url_fragment, container, false);

    ListView listView1 = (ListView) returnView.findViewById(R.id.mylist);        
    String[] items = { "http://mobile.cs.fsu.edu/android", "http://www.google.com", "http://my-favoriate-website.com" };        
    ArrayAdapter<String> adapter = new ArrayAdapter<String>(getActivity(), android.R.layout.simple_list_item_1, items);        
    listView1.setAdapter(adapter);

    return returnView;
 And my main XML is this: <LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
android:orientation="horizontal"
android:layout_width="fill_parent"
android:layout_height="fill_parent">
<FrameLayout
    android:id="@+id/fragment_container"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent" >
</FrameLayout>
 I place the Fragments in the main layout programattically like this:     FragmentManager manager = getFragmentManager();
    FragmentTransaction trans = manager.beginTransaction();
    UrlListFragment urlfragment = new UrlListFragment();
    MyWebFragment webfragment = new MyWebFragment();
    trans.add(R.id.fragment_container, urlfragment, "my_url_fragment");
    trans.add(R.id.fragment_container, webfragment, "my_web_fragment");
    trans.commit();
 What could the problem be such that my ListView just doesn't appear and my WebView takes up the entire screen?
@CODE:View returnView = inflator.inflate(R.layout.url_fragment, container, false);

    ListView listView1 = (ListView) returnView.findViewById(R.id.mylist);        
    String[] items = { "http://mobile.cs.fsu.edu/android", "http://www.google.com", "http://my-favoriate-website.com" };        
    ArrayAdapter<String> adapter = new ArrayAdapter<String>(getActivity(), android.R.layout.simple_list_item_1, items);        
    listView1.setAdapter(adapter);

    return returnView; <LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"

    UrlListFragment urlfragment = new UrlListFragment();
    MyWebFragment webfragment = new MyWebFragment();
    trans.add(R.id.fragment_container, urlfragment, "my_url_fragment");
    trans.add(R.id.fragment_container, webfragment, "my_web_fragment");

@TITLE:Membership System for Website and Mobile Apps
@CONTENT:I am currently working on a project that will have a website and apps for mobile devices. I am going to need a way to let users login to my site to view certain areas. I know I will need to build a WCF RESTful service but I am stuck on how to proceed with creating the users. I was originally going to use the built in .NET Membership but the more I read about it the worst it sounded if I had a lot of users. I then was thinking of building a new provider which would give me all the functionality of the built in .NET Membership but I would have more control over everything. The last idea was to build a whole membership system, but I was worried I would loose the functionality of the built in .NET Membership system. I am basically just looking for someone to point me in the right direction and explain why. Right now I am thinking the best way to handle this is going to be to build a whole membership system. I am thinking I am going to have my data access all through a WCF in the backend that my website would call and the RESTful service would call. I am not aware of a way right now that I can authenticate a users username and password through a WCF. Thanks for all your input.

@TITLE:How do I implemente ¡§sign in with Twitter¡¨ from Javascript now that Anywhere will be deprecated soon?
@CONTENT:I did in the past an Implementation with Twitter Anywhere. It worked and it's working very well but I now see that Twitter is sunsetting Anywhere and this fantastic javascript API won't be available anymore. I read the new documentation and I see there is no friendly Javascript API and the only information I found is "do it yourself". The problem is I don't have any idea on how to develop all that functionality and I also can't understand how a brilliant API as Twitter Anywhere will be deprecated while the is no similar new API that really replace it. Do you know what would be the way to do it now that Anywhere will be deprecated? There are suggestion about using Twitter for website where the login is done automatically when doing a tweet or dooing some actions, but none of them are useful for me as I just use the login to get some information from the user and that's all. Thanks a lot in advance!

@TITLE:How to submit a form with Spring MVC when one of the field is not a String but another object?
@CONTENT:My application is basically a dictionary. When I click on "submit" a new Word object is saved to the DB with its several fields. One of the field is called Category and it shows to which group the Word belongs. Currently this value is a String field of the Word object. here is the simplified code for the jsp.file     <form:form method="post" action="addNewWord.html" commandName="word" >

    <table>


    //many other fields;    


        <tr>
            <td>Category:</td>
            <td><form:select path="category" items="${CATEGORIES}"
                    var="cat">
                </form:select></td>
            <td><form:errors path="category" cssClass="error" /></td>
        </tr>


        <tr>
            <td colspan="2"><input type="submit" value="Add new word" /></td>
        </tr>
    </table>

</form:form>
 Here is the Word object. @Entity
@Table(name = "word")
public class Word {

    //other instance variables either primitives or Strings;

    @Column(name = "category", nullable = false, length = 80)
    private String  category;
        //getters-setters 
 in this case everything is fine and works very well and the Word object gets saved to the database. But what if I decided to create a standalone Category object and the category field in the Word object is not a String but an instance of the Category?     @ManyToOne
@JoinColumn(name = "category_id")
private Category category;
 How should I modify the form on the .jsp file to submit the word object that has a field that is not a String but a category? Just for the whole picture let me show the method in the Controller that gets called by the submit: @RequestMapping(value = "/addNewWord", method = RequestMethod.POST)
public String addNewWord(@ModelAttribute Word word, BindingResult result, Model model) {
    WordValidator validator = new WordValidator();
    validator.validateWord(word, result, wordService.getAllWord(), categoryService.getAllCategories());
    if (!result.hasErrors()) {
        wordService.save(word);
        word.clearValues();
    }
    fillCategoryNames(model);
    return "addNew";
}
 I have a feeling that I should use @InitBinder method but I do not know how, and it is more like a feeling than rock solid fact. Any advice is welcome.
@CODE:<form:form method="post" action="addNewWord.html" commandName="word" >

    <table>


    //many other fields;    


        <tr>
            <td>Category:</td>
            <td><form:select path="category" items="${CATEGORIES}"
                    var="cat">
                </form:select></td>
            <td><form:errors path="category" cssClass="error" /></td>
        </tr>


        <tr>
            <td colspan="2"><input type="submit" value="Add new word" /></td>
        </tr>
    </table>

</form:form> @Entity
@Table(name = "word")
public class Word {

    //other instance variables either primitives or Strings;

    @Column(name = "category", nullable = false, length = 80)
    private String  category;
        //getters-setters @ManyToOne
@JoinColumn(name = "category_id")
private Category category; @RequestMapping(value = "/addNewWord", method = RequestMethod.POST)
public String addNewWord(@ModelAttribute Word word, BindingResult result, Model model) {
    WordValidator validator = new WordValidator();
    validator.validateWord(word, result, wordService.getAllWord(), categoryService.getAllCategories());
    if (!result.hasErrors()) {
        wordService.save(word);

@CONTENT:I have a quaternion which holds the rotation of an object. During the frame I modify it and obtain a new quaternion. I can calculate a quaternion that rotates from 'previous frame' to 'current frame'. I cannot figure out, however, how to 'divide by t' this quaternion to get the rotation-per-second that I need. I.e, based on the timestep, I need to know what the quaternion would look like had it been applied to itself an X amount of times (meaning, 28.5 times at 28.5 fps, etcetera). Would anybody know how to do this? Or would you advise me to do something akin converting to Euler, multiplying, and then converting back?

@CONTENT:I'd like to embed an external SVG image file within an <svg> tag. To do this, i'm using SVG's <image> tag as follows: <svg width="1000" height="1000"

 As you can see, I'm trying to scale the nested SVG by 5.0 by adding a transform attribute. Unfortunately, in both Firefox and Chrome, I'm sometimes getting a blury image because it's rasterizing the nested SVG before scaling it up. Note: It sometimes works as expected (The nested SVG stays crisp) in Firefox and Chrome, but not always (For example, if I open the attached JSFiddle in Chrome, it's blury/broken. If I press F5, it's crisp/working) Is there any way to ensure that the nested SVG is never rasterized before scaling ? Thanks :) JSFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/a9NRY/17/

@TITLE:play framework 2 On application startup, Akka Scheduler doesn't run function repeatedly - it runs just once
@CONTENT:At application startup, I want to schedule a task to run every 2 minutes (for example, it may be every 1 minute). I've tried in 2 ways: 1. using Akka schedule method with Runnable abstract def schedule(initialDelay: Duration, frequency: Duration, runnable: Runnable): Cancellable (similar to how to integrate SMS & EMAIL Reminders in my play2.0 framework web application., except that I want it to be repetead, so I use schedule instead of scheduleOnce) 2. using Akka schedule method with an Actor abstract def schedule(initialDelay: Duration, frequency: Duration, receiver: ActorRef, message: Any): Cancellable (similar to Java Play2- Akka for jobs) Here is Akka scheduler API: http://doc.akka.io/api/akka/2.0.3/#akka.actor.Scheduler In both cases I'm overriding the onStart method of Global. My Global is in the root package: /path/TestApp/app/Global.java In both cases, when I run the app in production mode (in dev mode it doesn't work at all... there was a question on stack about this) it runs the function or it sends the message only once. How can I make it to run repeteadly with a certain frequency? If you have already done this or have any idea on how to do it... please respond. LATER EDIT 1: First of all, many thanks to nico_ekito. This is the version that works: Class MyUntypedActor.java import akka.actor.UntypedActor;
import akka.event.Logging;
import akka.event.LoggingAdapter;

public class MyUntypedActor extends UntypedActor {
    LoggingAdapter log = Logging.getLogger(getContext().system(), this);

    public void onReceive(Object message) throws Exception {
        if (message instanceof String) {
            log.info("Received String message: {}", message);       
        }
        else {
            unhandled(message);     
        }
    }
}
 Class Global.java import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

import play.Application;
import play.GlobalSettings;
import play.libs.Akka;
import akka.actor.ActorRef;
import akka.actor.Props;
import akka.util.Duration;
public class Global extends GlobalSettings {

      @Override
      public void onStart(Application app) {
        ActorRef instance = Akka.system().actorOf(new Props(MyUntypedActor.class));
        Akka.system().scheduler().schedule(
            Duration.Zero(),
            Duration.create(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS),
            instance, "VALIDATE"
        );
      } 
}
 br /> This version works with akka actors. But I also have the need to make a WS call with Akka Scheduler, something like this: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!searchin/play-framework/Akka$20Scheduler/play-framework/-WAr7xk3H-o/oLg9ZrwwFDgJ but in Java version. So... how do I schedule a function to be run with a certain frequency without using actors? For my other cases, actors work, but for a WS call it seems like it should be simpler... LATER EDIT 2: I've found out that case 1 (using Akka schedule method with Runnable) didn't worked because in the same onStart method I had defined an actor... it seems that Runnable doesn't "like" actor instances... Case 2, which is in essence like the case from nico_ekito still doesn't work... So I would avoid the syntax with new Props().withCreator(new UntypedActorFactory() because it clearly has issues.

@TITLE:DEBUG PDO Connection & PHP Output
@CONTENT:I am trying to connect to mySQL using PDO. Please forgive me if I have made a glaring error - I am just learining...  <?php

try {
    $db_conn = new PDO('mysql:host=localhost;dbname=testdatabase','test', 'testpass');  
} 
catch (PDOException $e) {
    echo 'Could not connect to database';
}

$stmt = $db_conn->query('SELECT * FROM PRODUCTS');

while ($row = $stmt->fetch() ) {

}

?>
 the output from the browser is as follows: query('SELECT * FROM PRODUCTS'); while ($row = $stmt->fetch() ) { echo '
'; print_r($row); echo '
';
}

?>
 What have I done wrong??? why is PHP not parsing the PHP script? UPDATE: If I create a new php file, and run phpinfo(); it works. If I paste phpinfo() into the top of the above code as follows: <?php

phpinfo();

echo '<h1>PDO TEST</h1>';

try {
    $db_conn = new PDO('mysql:host=localhost;dbname=testdatabase','test', 'testpass');  
} 
catch (PDOException $e) {
    echo 'Could not connect to database';
}

$stmt = $db_conn->query('SELECT * FROM Products');

while ($row = $stmt->fetch() ) {
    echo '<pre>'; print_r($row); echo '<pre>';
}

?>
 I get the following output: PDO TEST'; try { $db_conn = new PDO('mysql:host=localhost;dbname=testdatabase','test', 'testpass');  } catch (PDOException $e) { echo 'Could not connect to database'; } $stmt = $db_conn->query('SELECT * FROM Products'); while ($row = $stmt->fetch() ) { echo '

 UPDATE: Problem solved... It was some kind of file encoding issue. It works perfectly when I copy and paste the code into a new file. Very strange.

 The catch is under IE only the input#file is disabled before the .submit() starts on the second upload onwards. Is there a way to prevent the disabled from occuring until the .submit() has started? Is there another way to achieve this? something else I could disable? Could I unbind the .change()? Note: the disable is enabled later (after ajax return successfully). thankyou

@TITLE:Finding the number of integer partitions given a total, a number of parts, and a maximum summand
@CONTENT:I'm looking for the number of integer partitions for a total N, with a number of parts S, having a maximum part that is exactly X, without enumerating all of them. For example: all partitions of 100 that have 10 parts and 42 as the largest part. I've found no theorems or partitioning identities that address this question and I suspect that is a non-trivial problem that is not easily derived from known theorems (e.g. Nijenhuis and Wilf 1978, Andrews et al. 2004, Bona 2006): For example: The number of partitions of N with exactly S parts equals the number of partitions of N with exactly S as the largest part. This question is related to my research, which is far-outside pure math. Update: This question is answered below but I wanted to post the Python script I used to implement it. I'll probably push it through Cython to get some speed. n = 100 # the total
s = 10  # number of parts
x = 20  # largest part
print Partitions(n,length=s,max_part=x).cardinality() # Sage is very slow at this

def parts_nsx(n,s,x):
    if n==0 and s==0:return 1
    if n<=0 or s<=0 or x<=0:return 0
    if n>0 and s>0 and x>0:
        _sum = 0
        for i in range(0,s+1):
            _sum += parts_nsx(n-i*x, s-i, x-1)
        return _sum    
print parts_nsx(n,s,x)

@LINK:/questions/12433788/unique-values-in-a-column-but-only-unique-for-each-associated-foreign-key
@TITLE:unique values in a column but only unique for each associated foreign key
@CONTENT:I apologise for the confusing title but I'm really not sure how to describe this problem in one sentence. I have an SQLite database for a generalised tipping competition. For those unfamiliar with the concept, people "tip" who they think will win in each match of each round of a sporting competition, and the person with the most correct tips at the end of the competition wins (the prize may be money, pride, etc). It's very popular in Australia with the AFL. The basic structure is that users register as an owner, and they can then create as many competitions as they want, and each competition is linked to them with a foreign key. This is the relevant part of the database schema: create table owner (
    owner_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    owner_name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    owner_nick VARCHAR UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    owner_email VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    owner_password VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT owner_pk PRIMARY KEY (owner_id)
);

create table comp (
    comp_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    comp_owner_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    comp_name VARCHAR UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT comp_pk PRIMARY KEY (comp_id),
    CONSTRAINT comp_owner_fk FOREIGN KEY (comp_owner_id) REFERENCES owner (owner_id) NOT DEFERRABLE
);
 The gist of the problem is this: I want to enforce a unique constraint on the comp_name field of the comp table (as shown above) because a single owner shouldn't have two or more competitions with the same name. However, it is entirely possible that two different owners would want two different competitions with the same name (for example, two offices running tipping competitions for the same sporting league). Is it possible to enforce this using SQL, or do I need to do the enforcement manually elsewhere? A few notes: I'm using SQLite 3.6.20, which has proper foreign key constraint enforcement The database will never be used in a production level application. It's a private project. The database is being used in a web-based PHP application. If this cannot be achieved with SQLite, can it be achieved with MySQL? EDIT: I feel I should point out that I'm aware SQLite has very limited alter table support, and deleting the database and starting over is very much an option.

    owner_id INTEGER NOT NULL,

@LINK:/questions/12433729/powershell-how-do-i-increment-variable-names
@TITLE:Powershell, how do I increment variable names?
@CONTENT:This is a long question, I apologize in advance. I am currently writing a powershell script that parses an XML, and saves some parsed values as variables for use later. For example, say my XML looks like this, <head>
  <foo>
   <bar id="1" status="dead">
      <baz>
        <qux>Hello World 001</qux>
      </baz>
    </bar>
   <bar>
      <baz>
        <qux>Hello World 002</qux>
       </baz>
   </bar>
  </foo>

  <foo>
   <bar id="2" status="dead">
      <baz>
        <qux>Goodbye World 001</qux>
      </baz>
    </bar>
   <bar>
      <baz>
        <qux>Goodbye World 002</qux>
       </baz>
   </bar>
  </foo>
</head>
 Currently, my script looks like this, [xml]$report = Get-Content ./helloworld.xml
$foo_sub_length = $report.head.foo.length - 1
$bar_sub_length = $report.head.foo[$foo_sub_length].bar.length - 1
$foo_looper = 0
$bar_looper = 0
 As of right now, this part works, however, because I would like to pull the id number, or the qux string from each individual foo, I would like to do something similar to the following. (Psuedocode) do {
    do {
      $foo($foo_looper)_id = $report.head.foo[$foo_looper].bar[$bar_looper].baz.id
        $foo($foo_looper)_bar($bar_looper)_qux = $report.head.foo[$foo_looper].bar[$bar_looper].baz.qux
      $bar_looper = $bar_looper + 1
    while $bar_looper <= $bar_sub_length
     }
  $foo_looper = $foo_looper + 1
while $foo_looper <= $foo_sub_length
}
 I realize this may not have made any sense, or that I may not have been clear, but I would like some assistance. Essentially, is there a way to increment a variable so that it's name could be, for example, $foo1, $foo2, $foo3, etc, without changing it's value? Essentially, > $bar = 1  
> $foo($bar) = hello  
> $bar + 1  
> $foo($bar) = world  
> $foo(1)  
hello
> $foo(2)
world

@TITLE:Prevent Horizontal Scrollbar from Appearing in Overflowing Div
@CONTENT:I am trying to prevent the scroll bar from appearing when the div .boxB overflows and I am unsure why my code is not working. In other words, I am trying to remove the horizontal scroll bar only when the browser width is less then the width of boxB. This way, the scroll bar will only appear when the browser width is less then .boxA. http://imgur.com/yQDFG The light blue represents the screen. The yellow is a background div, and the aqua is the foreground div where its width exceeds the screen width. In this case, I do not want the scroll bar to appear. I have used overflow-x:hidden but that did not do the trick. HTML: <div class="boxA">boxA  
  <div class="boxB">boxB</div>
</div>
 CSS: .boxA {
    background: yellow;

@TITLE:boost::bind return a function object which is the argument for a function that requires pointer
@CONTENT:I am doing C++ coding on Linux about boost::bind. The return data type of boost::bind is a function object, which is an input argument to another function bridge_set_pound_var_func. But, bridge_set_pound_var_func's input argument must be a function pointer. bridge_set_pound_var_func's interface cannot be changed. The code is as follows: #include <boost/bind.hpp>
#include <iostream>
using namespace boost;

class myA
{
 public:

     int bridge_set_pound_var_func( int (*pound_var_func)(const char *, char *, void *), void *arg ) { std::cout << "bridge_set_pound_func is called " << std::endl ; return 0; }
 };

 class myC
 {
  public:
        myA *myOA;
        int func(const char * poundVar , char * t1, void * t2);

        int myCCall() { myOA->bridge_set_pound_func( (boost::bind(&myC::func, this)), (void *)this ); return 0;}

 };

 int myC::func(const char * poundVar , char * t1, void * t2)
 {
     std::cout << "myC::func is called " << std::endl;
     return 1;

  }

 int main()
 {
      myC myCO ;
      myC *m1p = &myCO ;
      m1p->myCCall() ;

      return 0 ;
 }

 // EOF
 I got compile error:  error: no matching function for call to 

 'myA::bridge_set_pound_func(boost::_bi::bind_t<int (&)(const char*, char*, void*), boost::_mfi::dm<int ()(const char*, char*, void*), myC>, boost::_bi::list1<boost::_bi::value<myC*> > >, void*)'


  note: candidates are: int myA::bridge_set_pound_func(int (*)(const char*, char*, void*), void*)
 Any help will be appreciated. And, the interface of bridge_set_pound_var_func cannot be changed because it needs to be called by many other functions. This is the new code that work. But, "myC::func is called" is not printed, why ? #include <boost/bind.hpp>
#include <boost/function.hpp>

#include <iostream>
using namespace boost;

class myA
{
 public:

 int bridge_set_pound_var_func( const boost::function3<int, const char *, char *, void *> f, void *arg )  { std::cout << "bridge_set_pound_var_func is called " << std::endl ; return 0; }

};

 typedef  int (*funcPtr)(const char *, char *, void *) ;

 typedef boost::function0<int&> boostBindFuncType;

 class myC
 {
  public:
   myA *myOA;
   int func(const char * poundVar , char * t1, void * t2);

   int myCCall()
   {

     std::cout << "myCCall is called " << std::endl;
     myOA->bridge_set_pound_var_func( (boost::bind(&myC::func, this, _1, _2, _3)), (void *)this );

     return 0;

   }

 };

 int myC::func(const char * poundVar , char * t1, void * t2)

  return 1;

 }

 int main()
 {
    myC myCO ;
    myC *m1p = &myCO ;
    m1p->myCCall() ;

   return 0 ;
 }
 I cannot change the interface of bridge_set_pound_var_func, which is called by many other functions. Is is possible to transform boost::bind returned function object to a function pointer?

@CONTENT:Something I've seen "hammered in" repeatedly is that one should not ever git push --force, though surely there are times when it is appropriate? When is --force intended to be used? My current example: Create branch and make some changes. Push branch "live" to show code. Rebase on origin, make changes/re-write history in the process. My code has now diverged from my own remote code. Is push --force the appropriate solution to this?

@TITLE:Outer element margin not equal to inner element margin
@CONTENT:I am using an Android WebView to display my app's HTML content. I need to dynamically find the full height of an element (usually a div) including padding, margin, and border. I am using JavaScript, and cannot use jQuery. I have been using scrollHeight on my div to get the height. I got the computed style of the div using var style = window.getComputedStyle(DIV, null); and got the top and bottom margin by calling style.marginTop and style.marginBottom. They were both 0px. The problem is that scrollHeight still does not account for the height of the margins belonging to div's. I got the child elements of my div (usually a P or H* tag) and obtained the same fields the same way: scrollHeight, marginTop, and marginBottom. The scrollHeights are the exact same (as I usually only have one child per div), but there is usually a top or bottom margin value in the child that is not reflected in the parent element. I don't really understand why this is so. It appears as through the child's margin is rendered outside of parent, but the parent has no knowledge of it, and cannot directly access it. I am looking for a way to access the margin defined by the child through the parent element. Is that possible? This Question was very helpful, but I did not find an underlying reason for why it is rendered this way and the thread seems to have grown cold. Thanks!

@TITLE:Core Data - Why isn't inverse relationship set automatically?
@CONTENT:I have a a one-to-many relationship as an NSOrderedSet on an NSManagedObject. When the addObject: method is called on the ordered set (which I'm calling from a property on an NSManagedObjectModel subclass object), however, the inverse relationship is not being set automatically. What can cause this? As a related note, I am using Magical Record to make it easier to map data to the NSManagedObject objects. Further, I've also referred to this post, but I'm not overriding these methods on my subclass: Core Data Inverse Relationship Not Being Set

Strava Wiki Please see the code I am using below. If it is not possible to perform the request with jQuery, can you give me an example of another way to do it? (ex. AJAX) I've done my research but I admit that I do not know enough to understand why the request is not working. Do I need to insert an argument that waits for the response before displaying the alert, or is that implied? Thanks in advance!  <html lang="en">

@LINK:/questions/12429312/entity-framework-code-first-shared-and-instance-context
@TITLE:Entity Framework: Code First. Shared and Instance context
@CONTENT:I'm building a layered application using Entity Framework code first approach with an mvc4 web application, separated mainly in Data, Services, and Web. From my web I do this: public void Foo() {
    EntityService _svc = new EntityService();
    Entity = _svc.FindById(1);
}
 The service method looks like this: private readonly MyContext _ctx = new MyContext();

public Entity FindById(long id) {
    return _ctx.Entities.SingleOrDefault(q => q.EntityId == id);
}
 The problem is when I need to use more than one service because each service will create it's own context. Trying to solve this I did something like this: public class MyContext : DbContext {
    private static MyContext _ctx;

    public MyContext() : base("name=myConnectionString") { }

    public static MyContext GetSharedInstance() {
        return GetSharedInstance(false);
    }

    public static MyContext GetSharedInstance(bool renew) {
        if(_ctx == null || renew)
            _ctx = new MyContext();

        return _ctx;
    }
}
 Changed my services as follows: public class EntityService
{
    private readonly MyContext _ctx;

    public bool SharedContext { get; private set; }

    public EntityService()
        : this(false) { }

    public EntityService(bool sharedContext)
        : this(sharedContext, false) { }

    public EntityService(bool sharedContext, bool renew)
    {
        SharedContext = sharedContext;

        if (SharedContext)
            _ctx = MyContext.GetInstance(renew);
        else
            _ctx = new MyContext();
    }
}
 Now if I want to share an instance of my context, I'd do something like this: EntityService _entitySvc = new EntityService(true, true);
AnotherEntityService _anotherEntitySvc = new AnotherEntityService(true);
 Is this, at least, a decent way to overcome this? I'll appreciate any help provided. Thanks.

@CONTENT:I am writing unit tests for my application and I was wondering if it is possible for the Mockito framework to affect an object that is passed into a method that returns void of a mocked class. For instance, calling a mocked validation class that contains a method that returns void but tracks various changes and metadata via an object passed in as an argument. . public GetCartItemsOutput getCartItems(GetCartItemsInput getCartItemsInput) {
    CartItemsFilter cartItemsFilter = new CartItemsFilter();
    validator.validateCartItemsInput(getCartItemsInput, cartItemsFilter); ...
 I mocked the validator class for my other tests but for this one I need mock the changes to the cartItemsFilter object which I do not know how to do.

@TITLE:In the stock OpenGL ES app on iOS 5.1, are they really using the vertex arrays they declare?
@CONTENT:In the stock OpenGL ES app you get (when you create a new "OpenGL game" in XCode), in the setupGL function, there is: glEnable(GL_DEPTH_TEST);

//glGenVertexArraysOES( 1, &_vertexArray ) ; // va's are not being used!
//glBindVertexArrayOES( _vertexArray ) ;     // we comment these out
// to no ill effect -- are these calls extraneous?

glGenBuffers( 1, &_vertexBuffer ) ;
glBindBuffer( GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, _vertexBuffer ) ;
glBufferData( GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(gCubeVertexData), gCubeVertexData, GL_STATIC_DRAW ) ;

glEnableVertexAttribArray(GLKVertexAttribPosition);
glVertexAttribPointer(GLKVertexAttribPosition, 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 24, BUFFER_OFFSET(0));
glEnableVertexAttribArray(GLKVertexAttribNormal);
glVertexAttribPointer(GLKVertexAttribNormal, 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 24, BUFFER_OFFSET(12));

//glBindVertexArrayOES(0);
 However, it doesn't seem that vertex arrays are being used, (far as I know, vertex arrays stay in client memory while vertex buffers are parked on OpenGL server memory). If you comment out the glBindVertexArrayOES commands, the code seems to work exactly the same. Are the glBindVertexArrayOES calls extraneous in this xCode sample?
@CODE:setupGL glEnable(GL_DEPTH_TEST);

//glGenVertexArraysOES( 1, &_vertexArray ) ; // va's are not being used!
//glBindVertexArrayOES( _vertexArray ) ;     // we comment these out
// to no ill effect -- are these calls extraneous?

glGenBuffers( 1, &_vertexBuffer ) ;
glBindBuffer( GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, _vertexBuffer ) ;
glBufferData( GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(gCubeVertexData), gCubeVertexData, GL_STATIC_DRAW ) ;

glEnableVertexAttribArray(GLKVertexAttribPosition);
glVertexAttribPointer(GLKVertexAttribPosition, 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 24, BUFFER_OFFSET(0));
glEnableVertexAttribArray(GLKVertexAttribNormal);

@TITLE:stay active on clicking list with href
@CONTENT:I had a question about letting clicked buttons/lists/anchors stay in a different colour... This one is answered by FAngel, for which I thank again. Now, I have a different problem regarding the same issue. http://jsfiddle.net/fxTQL/7/ In this fiddle, the effect is the exact effect as I want, but, on my website, it won't work. I guess I know what the problem is, but I don't know how to solve it. My site has a frame in which topics/posts are fetched if I click on the buttons which you can see on the jsfiddle. So the page "refreshes" and shows the links. This however, makes it impossible to let the clicked links in a different colour. It goes automatically back to the first list item, which has already a background-color How could I solve this problem? This is something I considered. <ul id="quick-index-list">

@TITLE:Rescale axis in grouped scatter plots with use of axes breaks
@CONTENT:The data for some of these types graphs that I'm graphing in R, http://graphpad.com/faq/images/1352-1(1).gif has outliers that are way out of range and I can't just exclude them. I attempted to use the axis.break() function from plotrix but the function doesn't rescale the y axis. It just places a break mark on the axis. The purpose of doing this is to be able to show the medians for both groups, as well as the data points, and the outliers all in one plot frame. Essentially, the data points that are far apart from the majority is taking up a chunk of space and the majority of points are being squished, not displaying much differences. Here is the code: https://gist.github.com/9bfb05dcecac3ecb7491 Any suggestions would be helpful. Thanks

@TITLE:Tridion Installation [closed]
@CONTENT:I am currently upgrading an installation of Tridion from 5.3 to 2011 starting almost from scratch (aside from migrating the database), brand new virtual servers. I just want to ask for some advice on my current server setup... a sanity check. All servers are running Windows Server 2008. The pages on our website are all classic ASP. Database SQL Server cluster. The 5.3 database has been migrated using the DatabaseManager. This is pretty standard and works well (in test anyway). Content Manager A single server to run the Content Manager and the Publisher. There are around 10 people using it at any one time so not under a particularly heavy load. Content Data Store Filesystem located somewhere on the network. One directory for live and one for staging. Content Delivery Two servers (cd1 and cd2) each with the the following server roles installed. cd1 writes to a filesystem content data store for the live website, cd2 writes to the content data store for the staging website. Presentation Two public facing web servers (web1 and web2) serving both the live and staging websites. The web servers read directly from the content data store as its a filesystem. Each of the web servers have the Content Delivery Server installed so that I can use dynamic linking (and other features?). I've so far set up everything but the web servers. Any thoughts? edit Thanks to Ram S who linked me to a decent walkthrough, upvoted. I suppose I should have posed some questions as I didn't really ask a question. I guess I'm a little confused over the content deliver aspect. I have the Content Delivery split in two separate parts. cd1 and cd2 do the work of shifting information from the Content Manager to the Staging/Live web directories. web1 and web2 should do the work of serving the web pages to the outside world and will interact with the content data store (file system). Is this a correct setup? I need some parts of the Content Delivery on my web servers right? Theoretically I could get rid of the cd1 and cd2 servers and use web1 and web2 to do the deployment right? But I suspect this will put the web servers under unnecessary strain should there ever be a big publish. I've been reading the 2011 Installation Manual, Content Delivery section, and I'm finding it quite hard to get my head around!

 P.S I'm using command prompt in windows. EDIT I am trying to store the package name in a variable. As of now, I have this code @echo off

 I am able to retrieve each line of the output. Now I have to extract the package name from the string. For instance the first line is package: name='com.timeplusq.noob' versionCode='15' versionName='1.5' which is retrieved in the first iteration of the for loop. How do I extract the package name from it. I thought string manipulation would be straight forward, it is not. So how do I extract the package name from the string?

@TITLE:Split a text to add a new line every n characters taking care of spaces
@CONTENT:Common problem when writing text for alert and confirm dialogs: number of characters to type before adding a newline character. Some browsers auto-break at one point, others at others. So you are left guessing. Useful snippet is a Javascript function that takes as input the alert or confirm dialog's intended text and a char length, then returns the same input string only with new line chars added at the positions with spaces closest to the char length passed in. That way, words are not broken up mid-way. Example: 1. Assign a var to a string of text you want to use for the alert or confirm dialog box, eg.: var a = "My dog has fleas the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog etc"; 2. Run the text through the function, for example: a = breakLines(a); // Default, break every 50 chars or a = breakLines(a, 20); // Break every 20 chars Display the value of 'a' after running it through the function and you will see line breaks have been added at every place you specified at the space character closest to the character place you specified. For example if you specified 20, 'a' would be converted to the following: 'My dog has fleas\nthe quick brown fox\njumps over the lazy\ndog etc' For each line in the string (a line is a portion of the string ending in a new line character), the line is trimmed of whitespace on both sides. The code snippet below uses the jQuery $.trim() function to do this but there are other ways to do so without using the jQuery library, such as with regexp. Just modify the code as you want to to use alternate means. This leads to my question: Aside from doing what I want to do the way I have done it as shown below, is there an easier more compact way of doing it, something that for example can leverage regexp? Any takers? function breakLines(text, linelength)

@TITLE:Two tables almost identical [closed]
@CONTENT:I'm developing an Android application and JSON web services. Both sides will have a database, and both of them will have the same database schema. On client side, Order, QAP and Defect are a copy from server side database. I can't add more rows to those tables. User will have a form with defect name and four columns: CRS, CRF, MA and MI. On these four columns user will insert some values. Defect's name is Defect.description, and CRS, CRF, MA and MI values will be part of current E-Report. To store these values (CRS, CRF, MA and MI) I use eReportDefect. My problem is that user can add more defects. If I could add more rows on Defect table, I won't have a problem, but I can't. To solve it I have added UserDefect table but I'm not sure if this is a good approach because I have two tables, eReportDefect and UserDefect, almost identical. And I have "another problem" for every Defect filled in an EReport, I could have zero, one or more images (tables eReportDefImg and UserDefImg). Is this design "OK" or it could be improved?

@CONTENT:I made a form with a few fields (name, title, etc) including an image upload thats stores the fields in my mysql database. When I submit the form for the first time I receive all my post data and am able to use the post data to build my database query. The post data looks like this: ["option"]=>

  ["controller"]=>
  string(5) "image"
  ["244dd7871d511949f4cf87df21403258"]=>
  string(1) "1"
 When I post the exact same form again, imediatly after the previous one. A lot of Post data is missing and I only receive this (all the post variables after jform['featured'] are missing): ["option"]=>
  string(9) "com_jimmo"
  ["jform"]=>
  array(6) {
    ["id"]=>
    string(0) ""

    ["path"]=>
    string(0) ""
    ["featured"]=>
    string(1) "0"
  }
 If I keep reposting the same form over and over again that data stays missing. But when I wait for a minute and try again all the post data is back. This seems like a memory problem to me but i'm unable to pinpoint it. The image i'm posting is only 700KB large and the the other variables and image combined should not be to large for the following php settings on the webserver: max_execution_time 60 max_file_uploads 20 max_input_time 60 max_input_vars 1000 memory_limit 128MB post_max_size 8MB upload_max_filesize 8MB Does anyone have an idea to what might cause post data to be missing when posted in succesive order? as per request my html:     <form action="/administrator/index.php?option=com_jimmo" method="post" name="adminForm" id="jimmo-form" enctype="multipart/form-data">

@TITLE:Service works from wcfTestClient but fails in Console Application
@CONTENT:I have a service. The service is working fine when I tested using wcfTestClient. When I am calling from console app client it is throwing following error: Could not find default endpoint element that references contract 'ICalculationService' in the ServiceModel client configuration section. This might be because no configuration file was found for your application, or because no endpoint element matching this contract could be found in the client element. Service Trace: Description: Failed to lookup a channel to receive an incoming message. Either the endpoint or the SOAP action was not found.

@TITLE:ArrayAdapter, ListView, creating and updating contents
@CONTENT:I posting this again, trying to make the question/problem clearer: ListView lv;
List<Item> items;
Localstorage ls;
RemoteStorage rs;
ItemArrayAdapter adapter;

...

getShoppingList();  // <--- this method populates the items ArrayList
adapter = new ItemArrayAdapter(getApplicationContext(), R.layout.item_listitem, 
                               items);  // <--- Create an ArrayAdapter and insert the 
                                        //      ArrayList...
lv.setAdapter(adapter);
 The code so far populates the ArrayList items, creates an adapter and adds items to this, and then shows it in the ListView lv. So far, so good. However, the getShoppingList() method is run several times, updating the ArrayList items. And instead of recreating the adapter every time this happens, I'd like to just update it and display the updated contents in the ListView lv. What I'm trying is this: OnClick method for the "Update" button: public void onClick(View v) {
    if (((Button)v).getText().equals("Update")) {
        try {
            tmpitems = rs.getNewEntries(cdate, latestitem);
            if (tmpitems.size() > 0) {
                updateFooter(tmpitems.size() + " new items found on server!");
                ls.UpdateLocalList(tmpitems);
                getShoppingList();               
                updateLatestItem(); 
                adapter.setNotifyOnChange(true);    //
                adapter.notifyDataSetChanged();     // THIS IS WHAT ISN'T WORKING
                lv.setAdapter(adapter);             //
            } else {
                updateFooter("No new items found on server.");
            }
        } catch (NullPointerException npe) {
            Log.e(DEBUG_TAG, "NPException i onClick(): " + npe.toString());
            updateFooter("No new items found on server.");
        }
 However, the lines for updating the adapter (after items have been updated) does absolutely nothing. I know that items is updated, because it's also written to a file, so the problem is not there. Besides, if I replace the lines for updating the adapter with lines for recreating it, it works nicely. Update (sept. 16, 2012): private void getShoppingList () {
    items = ls.getShoppingList(SHOPPINGLIST_FILE, cdate);
}
 The ls.getShoppingList() method: public List<Item> getShoppingList (String filename, String date) {
    String next[] = {};
    List<Item> nlist = new ArrayList<Item>();

    try {
        InputStream in = ctx.openFileInput("shoppinglists.csv");
        InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(in);
        CSVReader reader = new CSVReader(isr);

        for(;;) {
            next = reader.readNext();
            if(next != null) {
                if (next[0].equals(date)) {
                    nlist.add(new Item(next[0], next[1], next[2], 
                    next[3], next[4], next[5]));
                }
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
        Log.e(DEBUG_TAG, "IOException in List(): " + e.toString());
    }

    return nlist;
}
 ---------- Original post ------------------ I have a ListView lv with an ArrayAdapter for displaying rows of items. List<Item> items;
ItemArrayAdapter adapter;
adapter = new ItemArrayAdapter(getApplicationContext(), R.layout.item_listitem, 
                               items);

lv.setAdapter(adapter);
 This works nicely. The items arraylist is populated, and the adapter shows the contents in the ListView. However, then I do some stuff that updates the ArrayList items. And then I want to update the adapter and the ListView. But this code, adapter.setNotifyOnChange(true);
adapter.notifyDataSetChanged();
 obviously doesn't do it. So, how do I update the adapter and hence the ListView with the updated items ArrayList? Without reinitializing the adapter, that is? EDIT: The items ArrayList is updated thusly: if (((Button)v).getText().equals("Update")) {
    try {
        tmpitems = rs.getNewEntries(cdate, latestitem);
            if (tmpitems.size() > 0) {
                ls.UpdateLocalList(tmpitems);
                getShoppingList();
                refreshList();
           } else {
           updateFooter("No new items found on server.");
       }
    } catch (NullPointerException npe) {
        Log.e(DEBUG_TAG, "NPException i onClick(): " + npe.toString());
        updateFooter("No new items found on server.");
    }
}

refreshList() {
    adapter.setNotifyOnChange(true);
    adapter.notifyDataSetChanged();
}
 - New items are read into the tmpitems ArrayList. - If the number of new items are >0, a local file is updated with the tmpitems. - Then the items ArrayList is updated from the local file (with the getShoppingList() method, which adds the new entries) - Then I try running the refreshList() method, which is supposed to update the adapter, as mentioened above. The items ArrayList IS updated, and the local files are updated. It's just the update method on the adapter I can't get to work. When initializing the adapter, the items are shown in the ListView - when updating it, the new contents are not.
@CODE:ListView lv;
List<Item> items;
Localstorage ls;
RemoteStorage rs;

@CONTENT:I've a problem in converting byte to .mp3 sound file. In my case I do it using FileOutputStream using its write(bytes) method but it just creates a data file with mp3 extension but I cannot play it in any player on my PC. Note: I'm recording it from Flex Michrophone and send ByteArray to java. Which libraries should I use to add mp3 sound file headers etc. in java? UPDATE: I couldn't even convert my raw data to Wave format that is supported by java sound api.. It creates for me sound with recorded sound but with a noise - where's the problem? Here's my code for wave: AudioFormat format = new AudioFormat(Encoding.PCM_SIGNED, 44100, 16, 2, 2, 44100, true);

ByteArrayInputStream bais = new ByteArrayInputStream(bytes);
AudioInputStream stream = new AudioInputStream(bais, format, bytes.length/format.getFrameSize());


AudioSystem.write(stream, AudioFileFormat.Type.WAVE, new File(path+"zzz.wav")); 
 What's wrong with my AudioFormat??? And which one do I have to use in MP3 case ?! Urgent help! Any help will be highly appreciated!

@TITLE:Facebook PHP SDK works in Firefox but not in Chrome
@CONTENT:The question might sound a bit dull at first and I'm baffled myself.. I'm developing a PHP application that relies heavily on the Facebook API, thus is using the PHP SDK to connect and getting the currently logged in user via $fb->getUser();
 I have also included the Javascript SDK but its currently only fetching the logged in user and prints their data object to the console. Today I began to implement a local dev-version of the app, set up a second dev-app on Facebook, connected them and voila.. it doesn't work. getUser() always returns 0 for me locally. What I just found out though is that it works in Firefox. I var_dump the getUser() value, and recieve a full user id (mine) in Firefox, but 0 in Chrome (and yes, I'm logged in to Facebook on both browsers). I cleared the cache, cookies, destroyed the session.. I just cant imagine what difference the browser makes for a PHP request to Facebook? Has anybody ever experienced anything like this? Obviously the app_key and secret must be correct because it works on Firefox. Edit: just for reference, the live version of the application (hosted) works well in Chrome, it's only this very local app that I can't get to work. Edit#2: This is the Javascript that I run on the app   <div id="fb-root"></div>

@TITLE:how to open an attachment with my applicacion from within the email app? (mime type, intent filter ¡K)
@CONTENT:this may look as a duplicate, but I think I have tried most of the solutions posted with no success. I am writing an application that at some point sends files by email with a custom extension (.xyz) I then need to open this files from the email app, and I cannot make it work. After reading a lot of posts in this site and others, I came up with an intent filter that allows me to open this files from a File Explorer ( but not from the email app). <intent-filter> 
                <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" /> 
                <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" /> 
                <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" /> 
                <data android:scheme="file" android:host="*" 
                    android:pathPattern=".*\\.xyz"/> 
 </intent-filter> 
 I then tried to open the email and the attachment from within a web browser, and it didn't work. (the file got downloaded, but then I couldn't open it). I got this error in the LogCat     09-14 12:30:50.516: D/DownloadManager(2341): android.content.ActivityNotFoundException:
    No Activity found to handle Intent 
{ act=android.intent.action.VIEW 
dat=file:///mnt/sdcard/download/samplefile.xyz 
typ=message/rfc822 flg=0x10000000 }
 Though I find it strange to use the rfc822 mime type for the file, I changed the intent filter and added android:mimeType="message/rfc822"
 to the data section. Then I could open the file, just after being downloaded from the browser, but I can no longer open the file from a File Explorer (which makes kind of sense). Even adding android:mimeType="/" has the same effect. (The mime type of the file seen from within ASTRO File Explorer is empty). But what I really need is to open the file from the email applicaion, and none of these approaches helped there. I cannot even click on the attachment when opening the email. I may need to create a custom mime type, but I have not been able to find how to do it. So, the question is, what do I need to do to open the email attachments (from the builtin email app)with my applicacion ? create a mime type ? (if so, how?) create a content provider ? both? (again, how?) thanks in advance.

I know I can do all this manually, but I often set indentation automatically (ctrl+a, ctrl+i). That way I don't have to worry about indentation directly, I can make Eclipse manage it for me. However, that also nullifies any "custom" changes I made myself. Adding {} does the trick, but it also influences on the way java reads the code, so that doesn't really work. Maybe there are some plug-ins available for this? Something that would detect lines like e.g. //{

Also, I have other graphs plotted on that pane. But i want that whenever user clicks on the zedGraph area, we get the co-ordinates where user have clicked and i draw a straigth line on that clicked co-ordinate. I have used the MouseCLick event alogn with the FindNearestObject method like the following way: private void zedGraph_RenderedTrack_MouseClick(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        MouseEventArgs xx = (MouseEventArgs)e;
        object nearestObject;
        int index;
        this.zedGraph_RenderedTrack.GraphPane.FindNearestObject(new PointF(xx.X, xx.Y), this.CreateGraphics(), out nearestObject, out index);
        if (nearestObject != null)
        {
            DrawALine(xx.X, Color.Red, true);
        }
    } 
 But using this, ZedGraph search for some curve and find the nearest points and then plot the line but i want that the line be drawn where ever the user clicks. Is there any method to do so?
@CODE:private void zedGraph_RenderedTrack_MouseClick(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        MouseEventArgs xx = (MouseEventArgs)e;
        object nearestObject;
        int index;
        this.zedGraph_RenderedTrack.GraphPane.FindNearestObject(new PointF(xx.X, xx.Y), this.CreateGraphics(), out nearestObject, out index);
        if (nearestObject != null)
        {
            DrawALine(xx.X, Color.Red, true);
        }
    }

@TITLE:Problems detecting key combinations in WinForms app under Mono on Mac
@CONTENT:I'm trying to get a .net 2 Windows.Forms application running on the Mac using Mono. The application has key combination short cuts for all functions, which have pre-defined defaults and can be reconfigured by the user. The Form KeyDown event handler looks up the action to be performed. My problem is relating the Modifiers and KeyCode to the actual keys pressed. I don't mind if some mapping needs to be added for the Mac, but I need at least 3 modifier keys. However of the 4 modifiers on the Mac, few seem to produce obvious results. I get: Shift - works as expected Ctrl - reports a different KeyCode, but with correct modifier (eg Ctrl+N has Modifiers = Control and KeyCode 14 = "RButton, Clear"). Alt - reports some other key, unmodified (eg Alt+R gives KeyCode = 168 = "BrowserRefresh") Cmd - reports as Alt with expected KeyCode (eg Cmd+N appears as Alt-N) I presume that the Cmd key would normally be used where Ctrl is used on Windows. Can anyone advise which of the three Mac keys I should be trying to use? And most importantly how to parse the KeyEventArgs to consistently report a base key plus three optional modifiers? Mono is the latest version (as of a week or two ago), and it's a MacBook Air, OS X 10.8.1 if that makes any difference.

@CONTENT:I want to create the following behavior in IE9: Clicking on the textbox will select the text from the textbox. Clicking on it again will unselect the text. I tried the following from this linK: http://www.codingforums.com/showthread.php?t=105530 var x = 2;

 I also used this: http://jsfiddle.net/HmQxZ/1/ But the above solutions have weird behaviors when applied to several textboxes. What is the best way to approach this kind of problem. Is it possible to do this without using a global variable? UPDATE: The fiddle works in Chrome. But it does not work in IE9. In IE9, the text is selected but when you click on the textbox again, the text is not unselected/unhighlighted. In Chrome, the second click unselects/unhighlights the text. Thank you.

Those that select manifest_version 2, have a default content security policy of: script-src 'self'; object-src 'self' This policy adds security by limiting extensions and applications in two ways..." And I did get an email from Google about the need to update from manifest version 1 to 2, though assume that may have been a general email to all extension developers that have published to their store. I could update my extension, unfortunately, I use inline javascript and it would be a bit of a hassle to modify the code for the new design change. Since I don't specify a manifest version to begin with, would rather not update if I didn't have to. On a side note, would be nice if Google had a way to determine if app broke in compatibility when you change manifest versions. My app w/o code update, adding manifest version 2 and loading in Chrome would install fine but would fail to load/popup because of the content security policy, which I figured from reading the docs. Would have been better if it failed to install because it didn't meet policy, easier to debug that way.

@CONTENT:We have composite baseline for our components. Whenever we release the product after recommend the baseline, I would change the property of baseline to change the promotion level. By default the promotion level is "INITIAL". While we release the product i would change the Promotion property as "EXTERNAL RELEASE". But to do this, I have to go and edit each any every member baseline property. Is there any way to make changes in composite baseline properties to replicate in it's member?

@TITLE:architecting a django app that has a lot of common features between apps
@CONTENT:I have a high level question about how to architect this app in django. I have a few models that will undergo similar operation that will be performed on them by a view (like create, edit, save etc). You will also have some operations that are unique. Many of these operations are the same and I do not want to repeat the code. These models will have a few fields that are common among all of them, and they will also have field that are unique. What is the best way to design this? The different models will be different apps. For example, the model can be school, church or restaurant. Therfore, you will have three apps. I suppose these models are subclassed from an abstract class. The views will also have some operations that are the same for all these three apps. Not sure how to write a common set of code, and have these three apps inherit something and then customize if needed. I just need some pointers/direction. Edit: These models have a few common fields, but that is where the similarity ends. You could have models for schools , events or news articles (as you can see they can be completely different from a human point of view). I am going to add or remove these models as necessary, therefore, I must have separate apps. It almost seems like you need to create something that is common that you'd call in all these apps, but this common set exists for the model and views (almost need a framework that does all this I think).

One is that there are apostrophes in the result and the other is that the result is not URL decoded.
