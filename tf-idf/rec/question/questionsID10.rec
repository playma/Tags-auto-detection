@TITLE:How to avoid ¡§RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration¡¨ error?
@CONTENT:I have checked all of the other questions with the same error yet found no helpful solution =/ I have a dictionary of lists: d = {'a': [1], 'b': [1, 2], 'c': [], 'd':[]}
 in which some of the values are empty. At the end of creating these lists, I want to remove these empty lists before returning my dictionary. Current I am attempting to do this as follows: for i in d:
    if not d[i]:
        d.pop(i)
 however, this is giving me the runtime error. I am aware that you cannot add/remove elements in a dictionary while iterating through it...what would be a way around this then? Thanks!
@CODE:d = {'a': [1], 'b': [1, 2], 'c': [], 'd':[]} for i in d:

@TITLE:Set-Cookie Header With Multiple Cookies
@CONTENT:I faced a problem. When you add multiple Set-Cookie headers to the response headers.Add("Set-Cookie", "a=b;Path=/;");
headers.Add("Set-Cookie", "c=d;Path=/;");
 actually they are combined and only one header is sent with comma-separated cookies Set-Cookie: a=b;Path=/;,c=d;Path=/;
 According to RFC2109 it is a valid syntax. But it is not according to RFC6265, which deprecates RFC2109 Moreover latest browsers does not support this comma-separated syntax as well. Tested on IE9, Firefox 13 and Google Chrome 20. All of these browsers took first cookie only. Please see the sample project below https://github.com/mnaoumov/cookie-bug/ I want to find some workaround. I expect to have two different Set-Cookie headers. I tried to write some MessageInspector to rewrite HTTP headers. I could not find how to access that headers. Any ideas? P.S. Used technology: Web API

@TITLE:¡¥ant¡¦ is not recognized as an internal or external command
@CONTENT:I have the same issue as this user: ant - not recognized as an internal however unfortunately none of the solutions have worked for me in that post or any other. I've also looked at other commands not recognized and specifically adding a path variable. The procedure I am using is as follows: Extract to a desired installation directory, e.g. C:\apache-ant
Create an ANT_HOME environment variable`

Open System Properties -> Advanced -> Environment Variables
Create a new system variable
    Variable name: ANT_HOME
    Variable value: C:\apache-ant 

Add %ANT_HOME%\bin directory to the PATH system variable

Open System Properties -> Advanced -> Environment Variables
Under system variables, select PATH and append ;%ANT_HOME%\bin
    e.g. %SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%;%JAVA_HOME%\bin;%ANT_HOME%\bin

Verify that ANT is installed.

Open a new command window and type:
C:\>ant -v`
 In my case the Variable value is C:\apache-ant\apache-ant-1.8.2. My exact path variable is %SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%;%JAVA_HOME%\bin;%SystemRoot%\System32\Wbem;%SYSTEMROOT%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\;%JAVA_HOME%\bin;%ANT_HOME%\bin which doesn't have any spaces between semicolons.

@CONTENT:This is probably a stupid question, but I've searched for quite a while now here and on the web and couldn't come up with a clear answer (did my due diligence googling). So I'm new to programming... My question is, how does the main function know about function definitions (implementations) in a different file? ex. Say I have 3 files main.cpp myfunction.cpp myfunction.hpp //main.cpp

#include "myfunction.hpp"
int main() {
  int A = myfunction( 12 );
  ...
}
 - //myfunction.cpp

#include "myfunction.hpp"
int myfunction( int x ) {
  return x * x;
}
 - //myfunction.hpp

int myfunction( int x );
 - I get how the preprocessor includes the header code, but how do the header and main function even know the function definition exists, much less utilize it? I apologize if this isn't clear or I'm vastly mistaken about something, new here
@CODE://main.cpp

#include "myfunction.hpp"
int main() {
  int A = myfunction( 12 );
  ...
} //myfunction.cpp

#include "myfunction.hpp"
int myfunction( int x ) {

@TITLE:MySQL Views and index use
@CONTENT:I was thinking of starting to utilize views to reduce the complexity of code and queries in our project -- some of them have a few joins, and from what I understand, MySQL views would allow us to reference that data a little easier in multiple places. There's a lot of stuff being thrown around, where "MySQL doesn't use indexes for views", "You can't have an indexed view", "Only if you use MERGE"... There is no clear-cut answer. So, to cut to the chase: Do MySQL views use indexes on the tables they are built from? Is it a bad idea to use views at all because performance will be abysmal, or will it use the indexes on the underlying tables when doing its joins? If I sort a view by a column that is indexed in the table, does it still sort as fast as it normally would? Doing my research seems to indicate that views don't use indexes, but if that was the case nobody would ever use them; obviously people do, so...? Sorry if this seems kind of absurd.

@CONTENT:Long story short : i would like to know how to use the key/keyref from XSD to let elements have references to each other. it has to have a form of an example, using a simple xsd and an XML. Long story : I am familiar with usage of ID/IDREF. I use those to connect elements for JAXB. I have been told repeatedly that the key/keyref construct in XSD offers enhanced flexibility for inter-element referencing. I have consulted the OReilly XML Schema book, that seems to teach everything about correct definition of key/keyref and how it is similar to the ID/IDREF (but better) and doesn't give a simple example of its use. It doesn't seem to be similar, because you define the ID as an attribute in one element and the IDREF in another element and voila. But key/keyref have to be defined in a common ancestor of the referencing and the referenced element (AFAIK)... I use the XSD files to generate JAXB-bound Java classes with XJC I have searched for how-tos, tutorials and examples, but google gives me scraps. same for searches on SO (also with google and inclusive search with '+' ). In order to make everyone's lives easier i have prepared an XSD with already defined key/keyref pair as i have understood it. <xs:schema elementFormDefault="qualified" xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">

@TITLE:Adding a drop shadow to NSString text in a drawRect: method without using UILabel
@CONTENT:I'd like to add a drop shadow to text drawn using the iOS supplied NSString (UIStringDrawing) category method: - (CGSize)drawAtPoint:(CGPoint)point forWidth:(CGFloat)width 
             withFont:(UIFont *)font minFontSize:(CGFloat)minFontSize 
       actualFontSize:(CGFloat *)actualFontSize 
        lineBreakMode:(UILineBreakMode)lineBreakMode
   baselineAdjustment:(UIBaselineAdjustment)baselineAdjustment; 
 Clearly, there's no drop shadow option. Yes, one could use a UILabel here and get drop shadow properties to set, but that wouldn't be as performant, since any UIView subclass (such as UILabel) wraps a CALayer object and is going to be heavier (performance wise). Here's the context: I'm doing custom drawing for a UITableViewCell subclass, implementing drawRect: on the table cell view instead of creating the table cell from a Nib file of composited UIView subclasses. Compositing a bunch of UIView subclasses would defeat the purpose of trying to keep this lean and stay within 50-60 frames per second in table view scrolling performance. I have tried drawing the string twice at a slight offset. This may turn out acceptable once I tweak the drop shadow color on the background color of the cell that I have going, but it seems rather kludgey. Certainly there's no drop shadow blur property like one gets with UILabel. I searched for solutions and they either recommend UILabel usage (which I've dismissed per above, since I have about a dozen distinct textual elements getting composited on to the table cell view) or CGContextSetShadow(). The latter always seems to be suggested in the context of rectangular shapes, and not necessarily for attaching a shadow to the path of text drawn directly with the NSString drawAtPoint... method mentioned above. (I did try it, but it didn't seem to work (i.e. nothing changed); I'm new to Core Graphics drawing). Suggestions?
@CODE:NSString (UIStringDrawing) - (CGSize)drawAtPoint:(CGPoint)point forWidth:(CGFloat)width

EOU Hi, I've been looking around and seen a few things similar but not quite fully got the grasp on what I need to do to achieve the task fully. At the moment I have a form that a user supplies some details. On submit it is posted back to itself and the POST variables processed. I have a premade HTML web template for the information to be placed into which works fine and dandy just doing a str_replace. What I am trying to do now is export that as a download to the user in a plain text document. So the end result being the user clicks submit on the form and they then have a download popup open with the modified webpage as a .txt file. As far as I understand I need to do something using HTTPs headers functionality. What exactly though to achieve what I want I'm not sure. I only want the file to be available once, but I assume it has to be stored somewhere initally for the user to download which will then need cleaing up after manually? Any help or points would be great! Thanks.

@CONTENT:I've come up with several manual ways of doing this, but i keep wondering if there is something built-in .NET that does this. Basically, i want to reverse the bit order in a byte, so that the least significant bit becomes the most significant bit. For example: 1001 1101 = 9D would become 1011 1001 = B9 On of the ways to do this is to use bitwise operations if following this pseudo code: for (i = 0;i'8;i++)
{
  Y>>1
  x= byte & 1
  byte >>1
  y = x|y;
}
 I wonder if there is a function somewhere that will allow me to do all this in one single line. Also, do you know the term for such an operation, i'm sure there is one, but i can't remember it at the moment. Thanks

@TITLE:Does C# have a ¡§ThreadLocal¡¨ analog (for data members) to the ¡§ThreadStatic¡¨ attribute?
@CONTENT:I've found the "ThreadStatic" attribute to be extremely useful recently, but makes me now want a "ThreadLocal" type attribute that lets me have non-static data members on a per-thread basis. Now I'm aware that this would have some non-trivial implications, but: Does such a thing exist already built into C#/.net? or since it appears so far that the answer to this is no (for .net < 4.0), is there a commonly used implementation out there? I can think of a reasonable way to implement it myself, but would just use something that already existed if it were available. Straw Man example that would implement what I'm looking for if it doesn't already exist: class Foo
{
    [ThreadStatic] 
    static Dictionary<Object,int> threadLocalValues = new Dictionary<Object,int>();
    int defaultValue = 0;

    int ThreadLocalMember
    {
         get 
         { 
              int value = defaultValue;
              if( ! threadLocalValues.TryGetValue(this, out value) )
              {
                 threadLocalValues[this] = value;
              }
              return value; 
         }
         set { threadLocalValues[this] = value; }
    }
}

Reading the C# Programming Guide on MSDN: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/twcad0zb(VS.80).aspx I see their examples all pass the parameters by reference. However, I can't see how to pass by reference in my particular case, since the generic type is just for specifying the generic type of Table. Any pointers would be much appreciated.

I'm trying to write a wrapper for someone else's (somewhat clunky) function. The function in question can be applied to lots of different data types but requires different flags and options for each. But 99% of the time, a default for each type would suffice. It would be nice if this could be done with inheritance, without having to write new functions each time. For example: class Foo {
    public static $default = 'DEFAULT';

    public static function doSomething ($param = FALSE ) {
        $param = ($param === FALSE) ? self::$default : $param;
        return $param;
    }
}

class Bar extends Foo {
    public static $default = 'NEW DEFAULT FOR CHILD CLASS';
}

echo Foo::doSomething() . "\n"; 
// echoes 'DEFAULT'

echo Bar::doSomething() . "\n"; 
// echoes 'DEFAULT' not 'NEW DEFAULT FOR CHILD CLASS' 
// because it references $default in the parent class :(
@CODE:class Foo {
    public static $default = 'DEFAULT';

    public static function doSomething ($param = FALSE ) {
        $param = ($param === FALSE) ? self::$default : $param;
        return $param;
    }
}

class Bar extends Foo {
    public static $default = 'NEW DEFAULT FOR CHILD CLASS';
}

echo Foo::doSomething() . "\n"; 
// echoes 'DEFAULT'

echo Bar::doSomething() . "\n"; 
// echoes 'DEFAULT' not 'NEW DEFAULT FOR CHILD CLASS' 
// because it references $default in the parent class :(

@CONTENT:I want to create a WCF-service hosted in IIS6 and disable anonymous authentication in IIS. And don't use SSL.

 You can see that I even haven't included MEX-enpoint for metadata exchange. Just one endpoint and one binding for it with TransportCredentialOnly security. But when I tries to start service (invoking a method throught client proxy) I got such exception in the EventLog: Exception: System.ServiceModel.ServiceActivationException: The service '/wcftest/ServiceFacadeService.svc' cannot be activated due to an exception during compilation. The exception message is: Security settings for this service require 'Anonymous' Authentication but it is not enabled for the IIS application that hosts this service.. ---> System.NotSupportedException: Security settings for this service require 'Anonymous' Authentication but it is not enabled for the IIS application that hosts this service. I have no idea why my service require Anonymous auth? Why?

@TITLE:Why do I get ¡§error: ¡K must be a reference type¡¨ in my C# generic method?
@CONTENT:In various database tables I have both a property and a value column. I'm using Linq to SQL to access the database. I'm writing a method which returns a dictionary containing the properties/values retrieved from the given database table: private static Dictionary<string, string> GetProperties<T>(Table<T> table)
{
    Dictionary<string, string> properties = new Dictionary<string, string>();

    foreach (var row in table)
    {
        properties[row.Property]=row.Value;
    }

    return properties;
}
 Upon compiling, I get: Error 1 The type 'T' must be a reference type in order to use it as parameter 'TEntity' in the generic type or method 'System.Data.Linq.Table<TEntity>' I've tried searching for this error message without luck. Searching StackOverflow, this question seems similar, though regarding a parameter List: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1633690/generic-listt-as-parameter-on-method - though the parameter still isn't a reference type in the answers to that question, either. Reading the C# Programming Guide on MSDN: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/twcad0zb(VS.80).aspx I see their examples all pass the parameters by reference. However, I can't see how to pass by reference in my particular case, since the generic type is just for specifying the generic type of Table. Any pointers would be much appreciated. PS: Appologies if it takes time for me to accept an answer, as this feature is currently not accessible (I'm blind and use a screen reader).

I've heard people say that, as a general rule, an interface must only define behavior and not state. Does this mean that an interface shouldn't contain getters and setters? My opinion: Maybe not so for setters, but sometimes I think that getters are valid to be placed in an interface. This is merely to enforce the implementation classes to implement those getters and so to indicate that the clients are able to call those getters to check on something, for example.

@CONTENT:When writing unit tests for a Java API there may be circumstances where you want to perform more detailed validation of an exception. I.e. more than is offered by the @test annotation offered by JUnit. For example, consider an class that should catch an exception from some other Interface, wrap that exception and throw the wrapped exception. You may want to verify: The exact method call that throws the wrapped exception. That the wrapper exception has the original exception as its cause. The message of the wrapper exception. The main point here is that you want to be perf additional validation of an exception in a unit test (not a debate about whether you should verify things like the exception message). What's a good approach for this?

Has anyone put the iPhone SDL port through its paces? How well does it work? What kinds of issues can I expect taking this project, which is already cross platform code to iPhone? If SDL isn't an option can anyone reccomend an alternative framework to look at that will bridge the gap between SDL and the native libraries like OpenGL ES and Core Audio? Or is coding to those frameworks the best option? Edit to add: Here's a link to a forum thread on the UQM forum about doing an iPhone port.

@TITLE:Inheritance of static members in PHP
@CONTENT:In PHP, if a static attribute is defined in the parent class, it cannot be overridden in a child class. But I'm wondering if there's any way around this. I'm trying to write a wrapper for someone else's (somewhat clunky) function. The function in question can be applied to lots of different data types but requires different flags and options for each. But 99% of the time, a default for each type would suffice. It would be nice if this could be done with inheritance, without having to write new functions each time. For example: class Foo {
    public static $default = 'DEFAULT';

    public static function doSomething ($param = FALSE ) {

class Bar extends Foo {

echo Bar::doSomething() . "\n";

@CONTENT:I have trouble with UI-Router in many ways. I don't understand how it interacts with other frameworks. Namely, I am trying to implement Bootstrap 3's navbar collapse module, seen below: <div class="navbar navbar-inverse navbar-fixed-top" role="navigation">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="navbar-header">
      <button type="button" class="navbar-toggle" data-toggle="collapse" data-target=".navbar-collapse">
        <span class="sr-only">Toggle navigation</span>
        <span class="icon-bar"></span>
        <span class="icon-bar"></span>
        <span class="icon-bar"></span>
      </button>
      <a class="navbar-brand" href="#">Project name test</a>
    </div>
    <div class="collapse navbar-collapse">
      <ul class="nav navbar-nav">
        <li class="active"><a href="#">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
        <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
      </ul>
    </div><!--/.nav-collapse -->
  </div>
</div>
 This is straight from the Bootstrap website and it works fine when inside its own .html page. The issue is when I insert it into a UI-Router view. The collapsing action no longer works -- I'm guessing because the "data-target" function is somehow unable to find its target. How does one use Bootstrap 3 with Angular UI? The Angular UI Bootstrap package does not have a navbar module. The answer below is good. Here is a reference URL Twitter Boostrap Navbar with Angular JS - Collapse not functioning.
@CODE:<div class="navbar navbar-inverse navbar-fixed-top" role="navigation">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="navbar-header">
      <button type="button" class="navbar-toggle" data-toggle="collapse" data-target=".navbar-collapse">
        <span class="sr-only">Toggle navigation</span>
        <span class="icon-bar"></span>
        <span class="icon-bar"></span>
        <span class="icon-bar"></span>
      </button>
      <a class="navbar-brand" href="#">Project name test</a>
    </div>
    <div class="collapse navbar-collapse">
      <ul class="nav navbar-nav">
        <li class="active"><a href="#">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
        <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
      </ul>
    </div><!--/.nav-collapse -->

@CONTENT:I am trying to connect a Moto G Mobile to Eclipse in My Windows 7 32-bit machine but It doesn't show on the devices List. For this, First I connected the device to machine via USB cable and then I chose the PTP mode and then I checked the "USB debugging" option in devices settings. After a few seconds it says "Drivers was installed Unsuccessfully". At that time, I had uninstalled the device drivers in the device manager of my machine and then disconnected and connected again. It said "Drivers was installed successfully" and then I updated the drivers in the device manager and then set the drivers(google-drivers from SDK).But it doesn't show in the devices List. what did I do wrong here?

@TITLE:How do I save and restore a File object in local storage
@CONTENT:I have an HTML5/javscript app which uses <input type="file" accept="image/*;capture=camera" onchange="gotPhoto(this)">
 to capture a camera image. Because my app wants to be runnable offline, how do I save the File (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File) object in local storage, such that it can be retrieved later for an ajax upload? I'm grabbing the file object from the using ... function gotPhoto(element) { 
     var file = element.files[0];
     //I want to save 'file' to local storage here :-(
}
 I can Stringify the object and save it, but when I restore it, it is no longer recognised as a File object, and thus can't be used to grab the file content. I have a feeling it can't be done, but am open to suggestions. fwiw My work around is to read the file contents at store time and save the full contents to local storage. This works, but quickly consumes local storage since each file is a 1MB plus photograph.

Whenever I try to link a Storyboard item to my code, I get the error "Could not find any information for class named ViewController." This happens with custom classes as well. I've tried deleting the delegate data, I've tried removing and re-adding the classes, I've tried restarting Xcode, I've tried reinstalling Xcode. I can't ctrl-drag to create connections in any of my projects no matter what the class. The same problem happens with a brand-new template application. If I type in the code manually and then ctrl-drag, I can make a working connection, but I can't add it automatically. Nothing I've been able to find so far on the Internet has helped. Any pointers?

@TITLE:How to exclude certain requireJS files from uglifying/optimizing
@CONTENT:I have a working requirejs project that is using grunt for building and deployment. If using no optimization at all, the build is working without problems and I get one big js file to deploy it on production. The problem I have is, that I have some external frameworks (like angularJS) where I already have a minimized/optimized version of it and don't want to optimize it again. Currently without optimization I include the minified version of this framework via a seperate path config in my gruntfile. Whereas in my normal main.js I have the non-minified version for development. Now I want to use the optimizer to optimize my own code, but to NOT optimize the external frameworks. But the external frameworks should be included in the resulting big javascript file. Basically I want to tell the optimizer that he should use the original file in some cases. Can I do it something like this? I only have found a global exclude option, so that some modules are not included in the resulting optimized js at all. This is my grunt configuration: requirejs: {
            compile: {
                options: {
                    baseUrl: "<%= pkg.folders.jsSource %>",
                    name: "../external-libs/almond-0.1.1",

                    out: "<%= pkg.folders.build + pkg.name + '-' + pkg.version %>/js/main.js",
                    //logLevel: 0,
                    optimize: "uglify2",
                    //optimize: "none",
                    paths: {
                        'angular':'../external-libs/min/angular-1.0.4',
                        'jquery':'../external-libs/min/jquery-1.7.2',

@TITLE:Confirm Password with jQuery Validate
@CONTENT:I'm trying to use jQuery validate plugin to confirm my password entry. However, I don't want it to be a required field. Just IF a user wants to change the password, they would need to confirm it. If not, both fields shouldn't be validated. jQuery('.validatedForm').validate({

    rules: {


        password: {
                        required: true,
                        minlength: 5

 This is working perfectly, but again, both fields are required. I would like to have this optional, in case someone just wants to change for instance their email or username and leave the password alone.

 I would like the change in margin to apply with animation. Any clues ? What I tried : ObjectAnimator objectAnimator = ObjectAnimator.ofFloat ( image , "x" , VALUE);
objectAnimator.start();
 This works perfectly, as the image is moved to the specified X value with animation, HOWEVER the value of layoutParams.leftMargin remains unchanged !! So I cannot use this method, because if I try to change the value of layoutParams.leftMargin to 100 after using the objectAnimator with the value 100, the value applied is not correct ( 200 is applied instead of 100, the effect if the objectAnimator remains eventhough I am setting the left margin in the following manner : layoutParams.leftMargin = 100;
@CODE:ViewGroup.MarginLayoutParams layoutParams = (MarginLayoutParams) image.getLayoutParams ();
layoutParams.leftMargin = VALUE;
image.setLayoutParams ( layoutParams ); ObjectAnimator objectAnimator = ObjectAnimator.ofFloat ( image , "x" , VALUE);

 If seen this error if you are testing locally and have set the web project as the startup project rather than the cloud project, but as I say, this works fine locally against the emulator, but deploying into Azure causes this to fail. Any ideas what I'm missing here? Thanks

@TITLE:How to effectively deal with uncompressed saves during package check?
@CONTENT:In recent efforts to develop a package, I'm including datasets in the data/ folder of my package. In my specific case I have 5 datasets all of which are in data.table format (although the issues I describe below persist if I keep them as data.frame). I've saved each one as individual .rda files and documented them appropriately. When I run check() from package devtools, I get the following warnings:  checking data for ASCII and uncompressed saves ... WARNING
  Warning: large data file(s) saved inefficiently:
          size ASCII compress
  data1.rda 129Kb  TRUE     gzip
  data2.rda 101Kb  TRUE     gzip
  data3.rda 1.6Mb  TRUE     gzip

  Note: significantly better compression could be obtained
        by using R CMD build --resave-data

 I've tried saving the data with resaveRdaFiles (package tools) with the recommended xz compression. Even after doing that, the warning persists. OK, so I run R CMD build --resave-data and the warning continues to persist. What am I missing here and how do I overcome this issue (now and in the future)?

@CONTENT:Are there any projects that used node.js and closure-compiler (CC for short) together? The official CC recommendation is to compile all code for an application together, but when I compile some simple node.js code which contains a require("./MyLib.js"), that line is put directly into the output, but it doesn't make any sense in that context. I see a few options: Code the entire application as a single file. This solves the problem by avoiding it, but is bad for maintenance. Assume that all files will be concatenated before execution. Again this avoids the problem, but makes it harder to implement a un-compiled debug mode. I'd like to get CC to "understand" the node.js require() function, but that probably can't be done without editing the compiler itself, can it?

It is typical in C++, particularly when dealing with templates, to employ techniques that prevent some particular piece of code from being compiled. As these can get convoluted, what is the best way to ensure that particular pieces of code do indeed generate compiler errors? As the test shouldn't even get compiled, you can't rely on things such as boost-test, so I guess it should be integrated in the build system? How are these issues usually approached?

@LINK:/questions/7027022/how-to-efficiently-predict-if-data-is-compressible
@TITLE:How to efficiently predict if data is compressible
@CONTENT:I want to write a storage backend to store larger chunks of data. The data can be anything, but it is mainly binary files (images, pdfs, jar files) or text files (xml, jsp, js, html, java...). I found most of the data is already compressed. If everything is compressed, about 15% disk space can be saved. I am looking for the most efficient algorithm that can predict with high probability that a chunk of data (let's say 128 KB) can be compressed or not (lossless compression), without having to look at all the data if possible. The compression algorithm will be either LZF, Deflate, or something similar (maybe Google Snappy). So predicting if data is compressible should be much faster than compressing the data itself, and use less memory. Algorithms I already know about: Try to compress a subset of the data, let's say 128 bytes (this is a bit slow) Calculate the sum of 128 bytes, and if it's within a certain range then it's likely not compressible (within 10% of 128 * 127) (this is fast, and relatively good, but I'm looking for something more reliable, because the algorithm really only looks at the topmost bits for each byte) Look at the file headers (relatively reliable, but feels like cheating) I guess the general idea is that I need an algorithm that can quickly calculate if the probability of each bit in a list of bytes is roughly 0.5. Update I have implemented 'ASCII checking', 'entropy calculation', and 'simplified compression', and all give good results. I want to refine the algorithms, and now my idea is to not only predict if data can be compressed, but also how much it can be compressed. Possibly using a combination of algorithms. Now if I could only accept multiple answers... I will accept the answer that gave the best results. Additional answers (new ideas) are still welcome! If possible, with source code or links :-)

Then I thought about having XML files, but parsing them for each HTTP request is overwhelming. So, I thought about INI files, but then I figured that INI files are restricted to int/string values. In the end, I have come to the conclusion that JSON encoded file is the best: $config['database']['host'] = ...;
$config['another']['something'] = ...;
...
json_encode($config);
 Since JSON can store arrays, I can create quite complex configurations with it, and it parses faster than INI files. My question: did I miss something or is there a better way to do this?

@TITLE:How do I MOQ the System.IO.FileInfo class¡K or any other class without an interface?
@CONTENT:I am writing a number of unit tests for a logger class I created and I want to simulate the file class. I can't find the interface that I need to use to create the MOQ... so how do you successfully MOQ a class without an interface? It also isn't clear to me how I can use dependency injection without having an interface available: private FileInfo _logFile;

public LogEventProcessorTextFile(FileInfo logFile) {
    _logFile = logFile;
}
 When I really want to do something like this (note IFileInfo instead of FileInfo): private IFileInfo _logFile;

public LogEventProcessorTextFile(IFileInfo logFile) {
    _logFile = logFile;
}
@CODE:private FileInfo _logFile;

public LogEventProcessorTextFile(FileInfo logFile) {
    _logFile = logFile;
} private IFileInfo _logFile;

public LogEventProcessorTextFile(IFileInfo logFile) {
    _logFile = logFile;

@LINK:/questions/1545263/utf-8-in-python-logging-how
@TITLE:UTF-8 In Python logging, how?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to log a UTF-8 encoded string to a file using Python's logging package. As a toy example: import logging

def logging_test():
    handler = logging.FileHandler("/home/ted/logfile.txt", "w",
                                  encoding = "UTF-8")
    formatter = logging.Formatter("%(message)s")
    handler.setFormatter(formatter)
    root_logger = logging.getLogger()
    root_logger.addHandler(handler)
    root_logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)

    # This is an o with a hat on it.
    byte_string = '\xc3\xb4'
    unicode_string = unicode("\xc3\xb4", "utf-8")

    print "printed unicode object: %s" % unicode_string

    # Explode
    root_logger.info(unicode_string)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    logging_test()
 This explodes with UnicodeDecodeError on the logging.info() call. At a lower level, Python's logging package is using the codecs package to open the log file, passing in the "UTF-8" argument as the encoding. That's all well and good, but it's trying to write byte strings to the file instead of unicode objects, which explodes. Essentially, Python is doing this: file_handler.write(unicode_string.encode("UTF-8"))
 When it should be doing this: file_handler.write(unicode_string)
 Is this a bug in Python, or am I taking crazy pills? FWIW, this is a stock Python 2.6 installation.
@CODE:import logging

def logging_test():
    handler = logging.FileHandler("/home/ted/logfile.txt", "w",
                                  encoding = "UTF-8")
    formatter = logging.Formatter("%(message)s")
    handler.setFormatter(formatter)
    root_logger = logging.getLogger()

 A 1600 error is: NSValidationRelationshipDeniedDeleteError Error code to denote some relationship with delete rule NSDeleteRuleDeny is non-empty. Available in Mac OS X v10.4 and later. Declared in CoreDataErrors.h. But I can't see for the life of me which relationship would be preventing the delete. If some Core Data wizard can see the error of my ways, I would be humbled. But seriously, thank you! Picture of my model: FINAL UPDATE: I can't mark this solved, because I didn't really solve it, but I do have a working work-around. In the .m for each of my managedObjects I added a method that looks like: -(void) deleteFromManangedObjectContext{ 
   self.outfit = nil; 
   self.article = nil; 
   [[self managedObjectContext] deleteObject:self]; 
}
 So you can see, first I manually nil out the relationships, and then I have the object delete itself. In other objects, instead of nil-ing, my delete method is called on some of the objects relationships, to get a cascade. I'm still interested in the "right" answer. But this is the best solution I have, and it does allow for some fine-grained control over how my relationships are deleted.

@CONTENT:This works: class MyClass

{
    public MyClass()
    {
        int a;
        int b = a;

}
 As far as I can tell this happens because in the first example, technically, the compiler doesn't know that 'a' is not assigned. In the latter example, 'a' is defined locally, and therefore is easy to track. But why does the latter example not work? Don't integers default to 0? Is this something the compiler enforces for "best practices". Or is there another reason?

    int a;

@TITLE:How can I get around a 'die' call in a Perl library I can't modify?
@CONTENT:Yes, the problem is with a library I'm using, and no, I cannot modify it. I need a workaround. Basically, I'm dealing with a badly written Perl library, that exits with 'die' when a certain error condition is encountered reading a file. I call this routine from a program which is looping through thousands of files, a handful of which are bad. Bad files happen; I just want my routine to log an error and move on. IF I COULD modify the library, I would simply change the die "error";
 to a print "error";return;
 , but I cannot. Is there any way I can couch the routine so that the bad files won't crash the entire process? FOLLOWUP QUESTION: Using an "eval" to couch the crash-prone call works nicely, but how do I set up handling for catch-able errors within that framework? To describe: I have a subroutine that calls the library-which-crashes-sometimes many times. Rather than couch each call within this subroutine with an eval{}, I just allow it to die, and use an eval{} on the level that calls my subroutine: my $status=eval{function($param);};
unless($status){print $@; next;}; # print error and go to next file if function() fails
 However, there are error conditions that I can and do catch in function(). What is the most proper/elegant way to design the error-catching in the subroutine and the calling routine so that I get the correct behavior for both caught and uncaught errors?
@CODE:die "error"; print "error";return; my $status=eval{function($param);};

@TITLE:Mongo = get size of single document
@CONTENT:I encountered a strange behavior of mongo and I would like to clarify it a bit... My request is simple as that: I would like to get a size of single document in collection. I found two possible solutions: Object.bsonsize - some javascript method that should return a size in bytes db.collection.stats() - where there is a line 'avgObjSize' that produce some "aggregated"(average) size view on the data. It simply represents average size of single document. When I create test collection with only one document, both functions returns different values. How is it possible? Does it exist some other method to get a size of a mongo document? Here, I provide some code I perform testing on: I created new database 'test' and input simple document with only one attribute: type:"auto" db.test.insert({type:"auto"})
 output from stats() function call: db.test.stats(): { 
  "ns" : "test.test",

@TITLE:How to create a sleep/delay in nodejs that is Blocking?
@CONTENT:I'm currently trying to learn nodejs and a small project I'm working is writing an API to control some networked LED lights. The microprocessor controlling the LEDs has a processing delay, and I need to space commands sent to the micro at least 100ms apart. In C# I'm used to just calling Thread.Sleep(time), but I have not found a similar feature in node. I have found several solutions using the setTimeout(...) function in node, however, this is asynchronous and does not block the thread ( which is what I need in this scenario). Is anyone aware of a blocking sleep or delay function? Preferably something that does not just spin the CPU, and has an accuracy of +-10 ms?

@CONTENT:So I've been slowly replacing a lot of my normal jQuery code with native javascript, and I happened upon the document.createTextNode() and related MDN documentation. After reading I'm somewhat confused what a text node is. I understand it can be used to put text inside div's, but I'm sure there's a bit more to it than just "use it to put words inside elements". Looking at this, it appears a text node can also refer to the text of attributes as well. Can anyone provide a bit more of a definition of what a text node is and what it's used for? Are there practical uses for this other than basic stuff like this? var div = document.createElement('div');
var text = document.createTextNode('Y HALO THAR');
div.appendChild(text);

 The console should bring up every object in the array, right? But in fact it only displays the first object. if I console log the array outside of the loop, all the objects appear so there's definitely more in there. Anyway, here's the next problem. How do I access, for example Object1.x in the array, using the loop? for (var j = 0; j < myArray.length; j++){

console.log(myArray[j.x]);

}
 This returns "undefined." Again the console log outside the loop tells me that the objects all have values for "x". How do I access these properties in the loop? I was recommended elsewhere to use separate arrays for each of the properties, but I want to make sure I've exhausted this avenue first. Thank you!

@TITLE:Using checkboxes and required with AngularJS
@CONTENT:I've tried to use the html5 required attribute for my group of checkboxes but I don't find a nice way to implement it with ng-form. When a checkbox is checked I want the value of that input-element to be pushed to an array of values. The angular required validator seems to watch the ng-model associated with the input element, but how can I link several checkboxes to the same model and update it's value with the value of the input field? Right now the implementation is like this fiddle. <div ng-controller="myCtrl">
  <ng-form name="myForm">
    <span ng-repeat="choice in choices">
      <label class="checkbox" for="{{choice.id}}">
        <input type="checkbox" required="required" value="{{choice.id}}" ng-click="updateQuestionValue(choice)" ng-model="choice.checked" name="group-one" id="{{choice.id}}" />
        {{choice.label}}
      </label>
    </span>
    <input type="submit" value="Send" ng-click="submitSurvey(survey)" ng-disabled="myForm.$invalid" />
  </ng-form>
</div>?
 The updateQuestionValue-function handles the adding or removing from the array of values but each checkbox has it's own model and that is why each checkbox needs to be checked in order for the form to be valid. I've got it to work on a group of radio buttons, but they all work on the same model as only one can be selected.
@CODE:required <div ng-controller="myCtrl">
  <ng-form name="myForm">
    <span ng-repeat="choice in choices">
      <label class="checkbox" for="{{choice.id}}">
        <input type="checkbox" required="required" value="{{choice.id}}" ng-click="updateQuestionValue(choice)" ng-model="choice.checked" name="group-one" id="{{choice.id}}" />

@TITLE:What¡¦s an example of a Monad which is an Alternative but not a MonadPlus?
@CONTENT:In his answer to the question ¡§Distinction between typeclasses MonadPlus, Alternative, and Monoid?¡¨, Edward Kmett says that Moreover, even if Applicative was a superclass of Monad, you¡¦d wind up needing the MonadPlus class anyways, because obeying empty <*> m = empty
 isn¡¦t strictly enough to prove that empty >>= f = empty
 So claiming that something is a MonadPlus is stronger than claiming it is Alternative. It¡¦s clear that any applicative functor which is not a monad is automatically an example of an Alternative which is not a MonadPlus, but Edward Kmett¡¦s answer implies that there exists a monad which is an Alternative but not a MonadPlus: its empty and <|> would satisfy the Alternative laws,1 but not the MonadPlus laws.2 I can¡¦t come up with an example of this by myself; does anybody know of one? 1 I wasn¡¦t able to find a canonical reference for a set of Alternative laws, but I lay out what I believe them to be roughly halfway through my answer to the question ¡§Confused by the meaning of the Alternative type class and its relationship to other type classes¡¨ (search for the phrase ¡§right distributivity¡¨). The four laws I believe ought to hold are: Right distributivity (of <*>):??(f <|> g) <*> a = (f <*> a) <|> (g <*> a) Right absorption (for <*>):??empty <*> a = empty Left distributivity (of fmap):??f <$> (a <|> b) = (f <$> a) <|> (f <$> b) Left absorption (for fmap):??f <$> empty = empty I¡¦d also happily accept being given a more useful set of Alternative laws. 2 I know that there¡¦s some ambiguity about what the MonadPlus laws are; I¡¦m happy with an answer that uses left distribution or left catch, although I would weakly prefer the former.

@CONTENT:every one. I was wondering the difference between stdout and STDOUT_FILENO in LINUX C. After some searching work, I draw the following conclusion. Could you help me review it and correct any mistake in it? Thanks stdout belongs to standard I/O stream of C language; whose type is FILE* and defined in stdio.h STDOUT_FILENO, possessing an int type, is defined at unistd.h. It's a file descriptor of LINUX system. In unistd.h, it's explained as below: The following symbolic constants shall be defined for file streams:

STDERR_FILENO
    File number of stderr; 2.
STDIN_FILENO
    File number of stdin; 0.
STDOUT_FILENO
    File number of stdout; 1.
 So, in my opinion, the STDOUT_FILENO belongs system-level calling and, to some extent, like a system API. STDOUT_FILENO can be used to describe any device in system. The stdout locates in a higher level (user level?) and actually encapsulate the details of STDOUT_FILENO. Stdout has I/O buffer. That's my understand about their difference. Any comment or correction is appreciated, thanks.

@TITLE:What Is A Text Node, Its Uses? //document.createTextNode()
@CONTENT:So I've been slowly replacing a lot of my normal jQuery code with native javascript, and I happened upon the document.createTextNode() and related MDN documentation. After reading I'm somewhat confused what a text node is. I understand it can be used to put text inside div's, but I'm sure there's a bit more to it than just "use it to put words inside elements". Looking at this, it appears a text node can also refer to the text of attributes as well. Can anyone provide a bit more of a definition of what a text node is and what it's used for? Are there practical uses for this other than basic stuff like this? var div = document.createElement('div');
var text = document.createTextNode('Y HALO THAR');
div.appendChild(text);

@TITLE:How to loop through an array containing objects and access their properties
@CONTENT:I want to cycle through the objects contained in an array and change the properties of each one. If I do this: for (var j = 0; j < myArray.length; j++){

console.log(myArray[j]);

}
 The console should bring up every object in the array, right? But in fact it only displays the first object. if I console log the array outside of the loop, all the objects appear so there's definitely more in there. Anyway, here's the next problem. How do I access, for example Object1.x in the array, using the loop? for (var j = 0; j < myArray.length; j++){

console.log(myArray[j.x]);

}
 This returns "undefined." Again the console log outside the loop tells me that the objects all have values for "x". How do I access these properties in the loop? I was recommended elsewhere to use separate arrays for each of the properties, but I want to make sure I've exhausted this avenue first. Thank you!
@CODE:for (var j = 0; j < myArray.length; j++){

console.log(myArray[j]);

} for (var j = 0; j < myArray.length; j++){

@CONTENT:I have a following problem with entity mapping in JPA. I have two entities, first one is Lookup and the second is Text which represents translations for entities. Now I need to bound Lookup to the Text but I don't want Text to have reference to Lookup. To make this more complicated, Text does not use its primary key in this relationship but a metacode defined in a TXTHEAD_CODE column. Lookup.java @Entity

public class Lookup implements PersistableEntity {

    @Id
    @Column(name = "DATREG_META_CODE")
    private String metaCode;

    @OneToMany

@TITLE:resolving corruption in SQL Server Compact Edition database files
@CONTENT:This is not a query. Its a summary of our solution to get around the problem of corruption in SQL Compact Database files with (almost) definite success. SQLCE Corruption is a very common problem. We've received tremendous help from earlier posts in StackOverflow, and hence this post. Our product is a 3-tier architecture with the server running as a Windows Service connected to Rich Clients through .Net Remoting. Our product uses SQLCE since 2006. We have moved from v3.1, to v3.5 and now v4.0. We've a custom OR-Mapping tool for some very specific requirements. We've faced limited problems with v3.1, we've faced more with v3.5 and v4.0. Initially with v3.5, we implemented SqlCeEngine.Repair. But it only drops the corrupted data, and tries to recreate a stable db. We found that Foreign Keys of affected tables went missing. We had to do away with this immediately. We started notifying users about db corruption, and restore the last backup. This only provided a temporary relief; the problem of corruptions still stood. This year, we adopted v4.0. However, our application also introduced several new features which tremendously increased the number of database calls. v4.0 began well, but started giving problems when the software usage increased. Corruptions happening while the application was running caused neither by Windows crashing, abnormal shutdowns or disk issues. The database just corrupted. The next post covers the solution that we devised for this problem:

@TITLE:(Re)named std::pair members
@CONTENT:Instead of writing town->first I would like to write town->name. Inline named accessors (Renaming first and second of a map iterator and Named std::pair members) are the best solutions I have found so far. My problem with named accessors is the loss of type safety: pair<int,double> may refer to struct { int index; double value; } or to struct { int population; double avg_temp; }. Can anyone propose a simple approach, perhaps something similar to traits? I often want to return a pair or a tuple from a function and it is quite tiring to introduce a new type like struct city { string name; int zipcode; } and its ctor every time. I am thrilled to learn about boost and C++0x but I need a pure C++03 solution without boost. Update Re andrewdski's question: yes, a (hypothetical) syntax like pair<int=index, double=value> which would create a distinct type from pair<int=population, double=avg_temp> would meet your requirement. I do not even mind having to implement a custom pair/tuple template class ONCE and just passing a 'name traits' template argument to it approprietly when I need a new type. I have no idea how that 'name traits' would look like. Maybe it's impossible.
@CODE:town->first town->name pair<int,double> struct { int index; double value; } struct { int population; double avg_temp; } struct city { string name; int zipcode; } pair<int=index, double=value> pair<int=population, double=avg_temp> struct { int index; double value; } struct { int population; double avg_temp; } pair<int=index, double=value> pair<int=population, double=avg_temp>

@CODE:[['1','2'],['a','b'],['x','y']] ['1ax', '1ay', '1bx', '1by', '2ax', '2ay', '2bx', '2by']

Each object in myarr has a size, and each time "somecond(a)" is true and a new object is appended to the list, the new object will have a size smaller than a. "somecond()" has an epsilon for how small objects can be and if they are too small it will return "false"

@TITLE:When zeroing a struct such as sockaddr_in, sockaddr_in6 and addrinfo before use, which is correct: memset, an initializer or either?
@CONTENT:Whenever I look at real code or example socket code in books, man pages and websites, I almost always see something like: struct sockaddr_in foo;
memset(&foo, 0, sizeof foo); 
/* or bzero(), which POSIX marks as LEGACY, and is not in standard C */
foo.sin_port = htons(42);
 instead of: struct sockaddr_in foo = { 0 }; 
/* if at least one member is initialized, all others are set to
   zero (as though they had static storage duration) as per 
   ISO/IEC 9899:1999 6.7.8 Initialization */ 
foo.sin_port = htons(42);
 or: struct sockaddr_in foo = { .sin_port = htons(42) }; /* New in C99 */
 or: static struct sockaddr_in foo; 
/* static storage duration will also behave as if 
   all members are explicitly assigned 0 */
foo.sin_port = htons(42);
 The same can also be found for setting struct addrinfo hints to zero before passing it to getaddrinfo, for example. Why is this? As far as I understand, the examples that do not use memset are likely to be the equivalent to the one that does, if not better. I realize that there are differences: memset will set all bits to zero, which is not necessarily the correct bit representation for setting each member to 0. memset will also set padding bits to zero. Are either of these differences relevant or required behavior when setting these structs to zero and therefore using an initializer instead is wrong? If so, why, and which standard or other source verifies this? If both are correct, why does memset/bzero tend to appear instead of an initializer? Is it just a matter of style? If so, that's fine, I don't think we need a subjective answer on which is better style. The usual practice is to use an initializer in preference to memset precisely because all bits zero is not usually desired and instead we want the correct representation of zero for the type(s). Is the opposite true for these socket related structs? In my research I found that POSIX only seems to require sockaddr_in6 (and not sockaddr_in) to be zeroed at http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/000095399/basedefs/netinet/in.h.html but makes no mention of how it should be zeroed (memset or initializer?). I realise BSD sockets predate POSIX and it is not the only standard, so are their compatibility considerations for legacy systems or modern non-POSIX systems? Personally, I prefer from a style (and perhaps good practice) point of view to use an initializer and avoid memset entirely, but I am reluctant because: Other source code and semi-canonical texts like UNIX Network Programming use bzero (eg. page 101 on 2nd ed. and page 124 in 3rd ed. (I own both)). I am well aware that they are not identical, for reasons stated above.
@CODE:struct sockaddr_in foo;
memset(&foo, 0, sizeof foo); 
/* or bzero(), which POSIX marks as LEGACY, and is not in standard C */
foo.sin_port = htons(42); struct sockaddr_in foo = { 0 }; 
/* if at least one member is initialized, all others are set to

@TITLE:How do I determine if a WPF window is modal?
@CONTENT:What's the easiest way to figure out if a window is opened modally or not? CLARIFIACTION: I open a window calling myWindow.ShowDialog();
 I have a footer with an "OK" & "Cancel" button that I only want to show if the window is opened modally. Now I realize I can set a property by doing this: myWindow.IsModal = true;
myWindow.ShowDialog();
 But I want the window it's self to make that determination. I want to check in the "Loaded" event of the window whether or not it is modal. UPDATE The "IsModal" property doesn't actually exist in a WPF window. It's a property that I have created. ShowDialog() blocks the current thread. I'm guessing I can determine if the Window is opened via ShowDialog() by checking if the current thread is blocked. How would I go about doing that?

Whilst deciding what should be the default value to show on load, I realised that the following properties showed exactly the same values: innerText innerHtml label text textContent outerText My own research shows bench marking tests or comparisons between a few of them, but not all. I can use my own common sense and choose 1 or the other as they provide the same result, but, I'm concerned this is not going to be a good idea if the data were to change. My findings are: innerText will show the value as is and ignores any HTML formatting which may be included innerHTML will show the value and apply any HTML formatting label appears to the same as innerText, I can't see the difference text appears to be the same as innerText but the jQuery shorthand version textContent appears to the same as innerText but keeps formatting (such as \n) outerText appears to be the same as innerText My research can only take me so far as I can only test what I can think of or read what is published, can any one confirm though if my research is correct and if there is anything special about label and outerText?

@TITLE:Integration Test with Spring Boot and Spock
@CONTENT:I'd like to ask what is the best way to run the Integration test (annotation @IntegrationTest) with Spock. I would like to bootstrap the whole Spring Boot application and executes some HTTP calls to test the whole functionality. I can do it with JUnit (it runs first the app and then executes the tests). @RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class)
@SpringApplicationConfiguration(classes = MyServer.class)
@WebAppConfiguration
@IntegrationTest
class MyTest {
   RestTemplate template = new TestRestTemplate();

   @Test
   public void testDataRoutingWebSocketToHttp() {
      def a = template.getForEntity("http://localhost:8080", String.class)
      println a
   }
}
 But with Spock it doesn't start the application: @SpringApplicationConfiguration(classes = MyServer.class)
@WebAppConfiguration
@IntegrationTest
class MyTestSpec extends Specification {

   RestTemplate template = new TestRestTemplate();

   def "Do my test"() {
      setup:
      def a = template.getForEntity("http://localhost:8080", String.class)

      expect:
      println a
   }
}
 For the Spock, of course, I have proper dependency specified in my Gradle: ...
dependencies {
   testCompile 'org.spockframework:spock-core:0.7-groovy-2.0'
   testCompile 'org.spockframework:spock-spring:0.7-groovy-2.0'

@TITLE:How do I parse an array inside parsed JSON in Swift?
@CONTENT:I'm using an API that returns JSON that looks like this {
   "boards":[
      {
         "attribute":"value1"
      },
      {
         "attribute":"value2"

         "attribute":"value5",
      },
      {
         "attribute":"value6",
      }
   ]
}
 In Swift I use two functions to get and then parse the JSON func getJSON(urlToRequest: String) -> NSData{
    return NSData(contentsOfURL: NSURL(string: urlToRequest))
}

func parseJSON(inputData: NSData) -> NSDictionary{
    var error: NSError?
    var boardsDictionary: NSDictionary = NSJSONSerialization.JSONObjectWithData(inputData, options: NSJSONReadingOptions.MutableContainers, error: &error) as NSDictionary
    return boardsDictionary
}
 and then I call it using var parsedJSON = parseJSON(getJSON("link-to-API"))
 The JSON is parsed fine. When I print out println(parsedJSON["boards"])
 I get all the contents of the array. However I am unable to access each individual index. I'm positive it IS an Array, because ween I do parsedJSON["boards"].count
 the correct length is returned. However if I attempt to access the individual indices by using parsedJSON["boards"][0]
 XCode turns off syntax highlighting and gives me this: and the code won't compile. Is this a bug with XCode 6, or am I doing something wrong?
@CODE:{
   "boards":[
      {
         "attribute":"value1"
      },
      {
         "attribute":"value2"

      {
         "attribute":"value5",

      {

@TITLE:contentSize is not updated after reloadData is called on UICollectionView
@CONTENT:Does anyone know why contentSize is not updated immediately after reloadData is called on UICollectionView? If you need to know the contentSize the best work around I've found is the following: [_collectionView reloadData];

double delayInSeconds = 0.0001;
dispatch_time_t popTime = dispatch_time(DISPATCH_TIME_NOW, (int64_t)(delayInSeconds * NSEC_PER_SEC));
dispatch_after(DISPATCH_TIME_NOW, dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^(void)
    {
        // TODO: Whatever it is you want to do now that you know the contentSize.
    });
 Obviously this is a fairly brittle hack that makes assumptions on Apple's implementation but so far it has proven to work quite reliably. Does anyone have any other workarounds or knowledge on why this happens? I'm debating submitting a radar because this I can't understand why they cannot calculate the contentSize in the same run loop. That is how UITableView has worked for its entire implementation. EDIT: This question use to reference the setContentOffset method inside the block because I want to scroll the collection view in my app. I've removed the method call because peoples' answers focused on why wasn't I using scrollToItemAtIndexPath inside of why contentSize is not being updated.

@TITLE:Fetching UTF-8 text from MySQL in R returns ¡§????¡¨
@CONTENT:I'm stuck trying to fetch UTF-8 text in a MySQL database from R. I'm running R on OS X (tried both via the GUI and command line), where the default locale is en_US.UTF-8, and no matter what I try, the query result shows "?" for all non-ASCII characters. I've tried setting options(encoding='UTF-8'), DBMSencoding='UTF-8' when connecting via ODBC, setting Encoding(res$str) <- 'UTF-8' after fetching the results, as well as 'utf8' variants of each of those, all to no avail. Running the query from the command line mysql client shows the results correctly. I'm totally stumped. Any ideas why it's not working, or other things I should try? Here's a fairly minimal test case: $ mysql -u root
mysql> CREATE DATABASE test;
mysql> USE test;
mysql> CREATE TABLE test (str VARCHAR(10)) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)

mysql> INSERT INTO test (str) VALUES ('?????');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> select * from test;
+-----------------+
| str             |
+-----------------+
| ?????      |
+-----------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
 Querying the table in R using both RODBC and RMySQL shows "?????" for the str column: > con <- odbcDriverConnect('DRIVER=mysql;user=root', DBMSencoding='UTF-8')
> sqlQuery(con, 'SELECT * FROM rtest.test')
    str
1 ?????
> library(RMySQL)
Loading required package: DBI
> con <- dbConnect(MySQL(), user='root')
> dbGetQuery(con, 'SELECT * FROM rtest.test')

@TITLE:Using the ampersand (SASS parent selector) inside nested selectors [duplicate]
@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: Modifying the middle of a selector in Sass (adding/removing classes, etc.) 1 answer Okay so this has bothered me since I've been using Sass/Scss for the last year or so. I understand the parent selector in its general sense. This is where I struggle (whether it's not documented or just not possible): #parent {
  #child {
    width: 75%;

    .additional_parent_class & {
      width: 50%;
    }
  }
}
 This will basically turn into: .additional_parent_class #parent #child {
  width: 50%;
}
 While this makes sense because of the implementation of the ampersand and how it's used. What if I'm trying to get it to achieve this: #parent.additional_parent_class #child {
  width: 50%;
}
 The only way I have been able to achieve this is by writing another rule outside of the child declarations: #parent{
  #child {
    width: 75%;
  }

  &.additional_parent_class #child {
    width: 50%;
  }
}
 While this isn't necessarily a 'pain in the butt' in this implementation, it seems counter productive if #child has children of its own that will now need to be duplicated in both rules. Anyway, maybe I'm just being picky, but it would be great if there were more ways to traverse through the selectors. Anyone know something I don't? Thanks!
@CODE:#parent {
  #child {
    width: 75%;

    .additional_parent_class & {
      width: 50%;
    }

  width: 50%;

{ "timeStamp" : 1341834988676, "label" : "paul", "responseCode" : "200", "value" : 60, "success" : "true"},

{ "timeStamp" : 1341834988266, "label" : "paul", "responseCode" : "404", "value" : 99, "success" : "false"}]
 My query looks like this: resultsCollection.aggregate(
    { $match : { testid : testid} },
    { $skip : alreadyRead },
    { $project : {
            timeStamp : 1 ,
            label : 1,
            responseCode : 1 ,
            value : 1,
            success : 1
        }},
    { $group : {
            _id : "$label",
            max_timeStamp : { $timeStamp : 1 },
            count_responseCode : { $sum : 1 },
            avg_value : { $sum : "$value" },

        }},
    { $group : {

);
 My instinct was to try to pipe the results through to a second group, I know you can do this but it won't work because the first group already reduces the dataset too much and the required level of detail is lost.

sharon  | 200  |  false  |      35       |   1

paul    | 404  |  false  |      99       |   1

How will you find out whether these triangles intersect or not? One obvious solution to this problem is to find the equation of the plane formed by each triangle. If the planes are parallel, then they don't intersect. Else, find out the equation of line formed by the intersection of these planes using the normal vectors of these planes. Now, if this line lies in both of the triangular regions, then these two triangles intersect, otherwise not. trianglesIntersect(Triangle T1, Triangle T2)

@TITLE:Using the ampersand (SASS parent selector) inside nested selectors [duplicate]
@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: Modifying the middle of a selector in Sass (adding/removing classes, etc.) 1 answer Okay so this has bothered me since I've been using Sass/Scss for the last year or so. I understand the parent selector in its general sense. This is where I struggle (whether it's not documented or just not possible): #parent {
  #child {
    width: 75%;

    .additional_parent_class & {
      width: 50%;
    }
  }
}
 This will basically turn into: .additional_parent_class #parent #child {
  width: 50%;
}
 While this makes sense because of the implementation of the ampersand and how it's used. What if I'm trying to get it to achieve this: #parent.additional_parent_class #child {
  width: 50%;
}
 The only way I have been able to achieve this is by writing another rule outside of the child declarations: #parent{
  #child {
    width: 75%;
  }

  &.additional_parent_class #child {
    width: 50%;
  }
}
 While this isn't necessarily a 'pain in the butt' in this implementation, it seems counter productive if #child has children of its own that will now need to be duplicated in both rules. Anyway, maybe I'm just being picky, but it would be great if there were more ways to traverse through the selectors. Anyone know something I don't? Thanks!
@CODE:#parent {
  #child {
    width: 75%;

    .additional_parent_class & {
      width: 50%;
    }
  }
} .additional_parent_class #parent #child {
  width: 50%;
} #parent.additional_parent_class #child {

 My instinct was to try to pipe the results through to a second group, I know you can do this but it won't work because the first group already reduces the dataset too much and the required level of detail is lost. What I want to do is group using label, responseCode and success and get the sum of value from the result. It should look a bit like: label   | code | success | sum_of_values | count

How will you find out whether these triangles intersect or not? One obvious solution to this problem is to find the equation of the plane formed by each triangle. If the planes are parallel, then they don't intersect. Else, find out the equation of line formed by the intersection of these planes using the normal vectors of these planes. Now, if this line lies in both of the triangular regions, then these two triangles intersect, otherwise not. trianglesIntersect(Triangle T1, Triangle T2)

@TITLE:F# seems slower than other languages¡K what can I do to speed it up? [closed]
@CONTENT:I like F# ; I really, really do. Having been bitten by the "functional programming"-bug, I force myself to use it when I have the opportunity to. In fact, I recently used it (during a one week vacation) to code a nice AI algorithm. However, my attempts so far (see a SO question related to my first attempt here) seem to indicate that, though undoubtedly beautiful... F# has the slowest execution speed of all the languages I've used. Am I doing something wrong in my code? I verbosely explain what I did in my blog post, and in my experiments, I see OCaml and the rest of the group running anywhere from 5x to 35x faster than F#. Am I the only one with such experiences? I find it disheartening that the language I like the most, is also the slowest one - sometimes by far... EDIT: Direct GitHub link, where the code lives in various language forms... EDIT2: Thanks to Thomas and Daniel, speed improved considerably: Greatest speed boost: moving from "ref" to "mutable" gave a whopping 30%. Removing exceptions and using while/flagChecks gave another 16%. Switching from discriminated unions to enums gave another 5%. "inline" gave 0.5-1% EDIT3: Dr Jon Harrop joined the fight: 60% speedup, by making ScoreBoard operate directly on the "enumerated" version of the data. The imperative version of F# now runs 3-4 times slower than C++, which is a good result for a VM-based runtime. I consider the problem solved - thanks guys! EDIT4: After merging all optimizations, these are the results (F# reached C# in imperative style - now if only I could do something about functional style, too!) real 0m0.221s: That was C++ real 0m0.676s: That was C# (imperative, C++ mirror) real 0m0.704s: That was F# (imperative, C++ mirror) real 0m0.753s: That was OCaml (imperative, C++ mirror) real 0m0.989s: That was OCaml (functional) real 0m1.064s: That was Java (imperative) real 0m1.955s: That was F# (functional)

I've recently discovered to my annoyance that third party sites are hotlinking to my Cloudfront server to display images on their own pages, without authorization. I've configured .htaccessto prevent hotlinking on my own server, but haven't found a way of doing this on Cloudfront, which doesn't seem to support the feature natively. And, annoyingly, Amazon's Bucket Policies, which could be used to prevent hotlinking, have effect only on S3, they have no effect on CloudFront distributions [link]. If you want to take advantage of the policies you have to serve your content from S3 directly. Scouring my server logs for hotlinkers and manually changing the file names isn't really a realistic option, although I've been doing this to end the most blatant offenses. Any suggestions would be welcome.

@TITLE:jQuery Mobile rendering problems with content being added after the page is initialized
@CONTENT:I'm using jQuery Mobile and Backbone JS for a project. It's mostly working, using jQuery Mobile's event 'pagebeforeshow' to trigger the correct Backbone View. In the Backbone View for that particular jQuery Mobile page, that's where it's doing all the dynamic things needed. Some of the things the views do is pull in certain bits using Underscore's templating system. This is all great until where I pulling in form bits using the templating system. For example, a set of dynamic radio buttons (which are generated from a Backbone Collection). These radio buttons I want to style up using what jQuery Mobile has to offer. At the moment, jQuery Mobile is not picking up these dynamically injected radio buttons. I solved this issue previously when doing sliders by just calling the jQuery Mobile widget "slider()" method again and it seemed to refresh them... This doesn't seem to be the case with these radio buttons. In the Backbone View, I tried calling the widget methods again: $(this.el).find("input[type='radio']").checkboxradio();
$(this.el).find(":jqmData(role='controlgroup')").controlgroup();
 I tried them the other way around too, but it seemed I need to do it this way for the grouping styling to work etc. But this just doesn't seem right! ...doing this also caused errors when I clicked on the radio buttons, saying: "cannot call methods on checkboxradio prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'refresh'"? It seems there should be a way in jQuery Mobile to re-initialize the page or something?! I noticed there is a 'page' widget in the source code. How does jQuery Mobile handle forms/elements being injected into the DOM after the page is made? Is there a clean way of handling how it makes up the forms? There must be a clean way of calling on the forms to render 'the jQuery Mobile way' without it just relying on data attribute tags in the base HTML? Any help or insight into this problem would be greatly appreciated... I'm very much on this quest of trying to get Backbone JS and jQuery Mobile to work nicely together. Many thanks, James

@TITLE:Topological sort in OCaml
@CONTENT:I'm trying to write topological sorting in ocaml, but I'm a beginner (in OCaml & graphs algorithms) and I can't do this by myself. It's easier for me to think about topological sorting in, for example, C++ (and there is a lot examples of topological sorting in C++ on the Internet), but I want to learn something new. Moreover, I've found some examples of topological sorting written in OCaml, but I don't understand them, to be frankly. Let's say I have a list (int * int list) list, for example: myList = [(1, [2]); (5, [6; 7]); (3, [2]); (6, [3; 7]); (8, [7]); (4, [3; 1])];; and that means, that I need to "do" task 1 before task 2, task 4 before tasks 3 and 1 etc. I think, that output for this list should be: [8; 5; 6; 7; 4; 3; 1; 2] (however I'm not sure, because I just made this example, so if I'm wrong, correct me please) Also, I've read, that topological sort doesn't work for cycles in graphs, so there must be some kind of condition for cycles - when given graph has cycle(s) we raise exception (I think that is a good idea). AFAIK, I need to use DFS in algorithm for topological sort, which (DFS) I don't know how to implement in OCaml (I understand main idea, but I don't feel, how that works in OCaml/functional programming). I would really appreciate Your help to understand me this concepts (I mean topological sort, DFS in OCaml/functional programming). If You can, it would be great, if You show me example codes, because reading code is (for me) the best method to understand algorithm's concept. I know, that for most of You this is a simple question, but I hope, that it won't keep You from helping me. PS: I'm learning OCaml by myself (I'm in a high school), so I don't have solid theory background (either in OCaml or algorithms). I had started learning OCaml, because I wanted to understand recursion concept, and now this language seems to be interesting, because is really different from C++, so I'm still trying to learn something new in OCaml.

@TITLE:Visual Studio 2010 build file lock issues
@CONTENT:I have a Visual Studio 2008 project that I "upgraded" to Visual Studio 2010. Since the upgrade I have been having a lot of problems with the project (a project that was and still is trooper in 2008 I might add). The first problem is that building the main executable locks the executable, causing further rebuilds to fail. This is described in a related question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2002273/visual-studio-locks-output-file-on-build where I picked up the workaround: if exist "$(TargetPath).locked" del "$(TargetPath).locked"
if exist "$(TargetPath)" if not exist "$(TargetPath).locked" move "$(TargetPath)" "$(TargetPath).locked"
 Except this workaround works exactly once. The .locked file then is locked by devenv.exe as well and must be moved. I have been working around this by adding .1.locked, .2.locked, etc. The only time that the locks are removed so the files can be deleted is on shutdown of devenv.exe (it takes a few seconds after the UI vanishes, then the files can be removed). The fact that the debugger does not have to be used to cause this problem points to a pretty serious issue with the 2010 build system. Some theories I think I can discount: Antivirus or other background tasks: if this was a problem it would seem 2008 would fail. However, being a completest I removed the avast! system entirely with no luck. UPDATE: This project has the same symptoms on a machine with no antivirus and no backup utility. The machines in the office are running XP SP3 32bit, my local machine is Windows 7 64 bit. This appears to be OS independent. The debugger is locking the file: all that is required to reproduce this is repeating the build process without debugging. ProcessExplorer shows devenv.exe is the holder of the locks, not the vshost and killing the vshost.exe doesn't remove the locks anyway. I have a secondary problem that starts to occur once the files get locked: the form designers stop loading with a "can't find assembly" error. I suspect these are related to the earlier locking issue as the designers fire right up prior to a build, but making any changes and rebuilding will cause all the designers to collapse with that error (even ones I have open and as the current view). It is pitiful to watch a form close to the white error screen just because you changed "dummy=1" to "dummy=2" where "dummy" does absolutely nothing but force a recompile in a completely unrelated assembly. Update: I have tried a few more remedies: Enable .NET source stepping is not checked, so that isn't the issue. Removing the .SUO (solution user options) simply works for as long as a restart would normally remove the problem (two builds: the first because there is no locked file and the second because there is one, but it can be renamed by the script). Error   28  Unable to copy file "obj\Debug\PolicyTracker3.exe" to "bin\Debug\PolicyTracker3.exe". 
The process cannot access the file 'bin\Debug\PolicyTracker3.exe' because it is being used by another process.

I am interested in knowing can we completely replace relation db like mysql/ oracle with cassandra? does cassandra support rollback/ commit? does cassandra clients (thrift/ hector) support fetching associated object (objects where we save one super columns' key in another super column family)? This will help me a lot to proceed further. thank you in advance.

@TITLE:One big executable or many small DLL's?
@CONTENT:Over the years my application has grown from 1MB to 25MB and I expect it to grow further to 40, 50 MB. I don't use DLL's, but put everything in this one big executable. Having one big executable has certain advantages: Installing my application at the customer is really: copy and run. Upgrades can be easily zipped and sent to the customer There is no risk of having conflicting DLL's (where the customer has version X of the EXE, but version Y of the DLL) The big disadvantage of the big EXE is that linking times seem to grow exponentially. Additional problem is that a part of the code (let's say about 40%) is shared with another application. Again, the advantages are that: There is no risk on having a mix of incorrect DLL versions Every developer can make changes on the common code which speeds up developments. But again, this has a serious impact on compilation times (everyone compiles the common code again on his PC) and on linking times. The question http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2387908/grouping-dlls-for-use-in-executable mentions the possibility of mixing DLL's in one executable, but it looks like this still requires you to link all functions manually in your application (using LoadLibrary, GetProcAddress, ...). What is your opinion on executable sizes, the use of DLL's and the best 'balance' between easy deployment and easy/fast development?

@CONTENT:I have a page that I want to redirect to that requires parameters in the URL: http://www.example.com/myController/myAction/param1:val1/param2:val2 I know that there is a CakePHP redirect function for redirecting that works as follows:  $this->redirect(array("controller" => "myController",

@TITLE:Mapping <C-Tab> in my vimrc fails in Ubuntu
@CONTENT:I want to map ctrl-tab to :tabn, and ctrl-shift-tab to :tabp. I had it working for gVim in Windows XP, but moved it to my .vimrc in Ubuntu 9.10 and it doesn't work (vim 7.2). Here's the relevant section of my .vimrc: nmap <C-Tab> :tabn<CR>
nmap <C-S-Tab> :tabp<CR>
nmap <C-t> :tabnew<CR>
 <C-t> works fine, so mapping the ctrl key doesn't seem to be a problem. I really have no idea where to start! What could be going wrong here, considering it worked fine under Windows? More info: I'm running Ubuntu 9.10 server, with xorg and fluxbox installed on top. I'm using xterm as my terminal. Ctrl-tab mapping works in fluxbox: I can map ctrl-tab and ctrl-shift-tab successfully in my window manager; if I start tabbing my xterms, I can cycle through those tabs as expected. I'm not sure what this means, but I think the issue is not a window manager/xorg issue. The keys don't seem to be mapped to something else, and can be recognised together successfully. Answer: It's an xterm issue - it doesn't intercept and send a unique keycode for ctrl-tab. See my full answer below for details.

@TITLE:ASP.NET session state and multiple worker processes
@CONTENT:I need to understand something about ASP.NET session state, as it applies to IIS 7 and ASP.net 3.5. If an application is configured to use in-process session state, will that work OK if there are multiple worker processes? In other words, do worker processes share session state? The default configuration for IIS 7 is to use in-process session state and to allocate a maximum of 10 worker processes. It would seem likely then, that this default configuration should work. I'm dealing with a company that has produced an ASP.NET MVC web app that is having some problems, they're blaming the server environment. The claim is that because I'm using the default settings of 10 worker processes, that is breaking their session state. I need to know whether this is in fact an accurate claim. I've never known an ASP.NET app to not work with the default configuration, so I'm a bit confused and need to have this clarified.

now = DateTime.Now;
 But the resulting type is a non-nullable object and hence still giving me the above exception. Any suggestions?!

@CONTENT:I want to have SupportMapFragment in one of my Activity. I add this fragment directly to layout xml and this layout set as content view. But when Activity is launched for the first time, it takes too long (over 1 second). Next launches are ok and take few milliseconds. I tried: remove any initialization use MapFragment instead of SupportMapFragment add MapFragment programatically but nothing helped. Map is shown without any problem or suspicious log. Do you have any suggestion, what it causes and how to improve it? edit: I have a ListView and when user clicks on Item, it launches DetailActivity with MapFragment. After click on item there is a noticeable delay before DetailActivity shows up. Only method onCreate, where I call setContentView, runs over 1 second. And while activity is in onCreate method, there is no visible content from this activity. This delay between click and showing content is not very user friendly. Thank you

Basically, if you setViewsControllers programmatically with animation set to yes and scroll animation. If you're touching any part of the screen before the scroll animation starts there will be the following crash * Assertion failure in -[_UIQueuingScrollView _didScrollWithAnimation:force:], /SourceCache/UIKit/UIKit-2372/_UIQueuingScrollView.m:778 as described here . I also downloaded Apple's PhotoScroller sample app and edited it with programmatic page change and they have the same bug. My solution was not to trigger the page change if the user is currently touching the screen, you can also change the animation to curl or remove the animation.

  geom_point(aes(fill=id, size=id), colour="black", shape=21)
 However, I can't figure out how to control the thickness of the shape borders, either setting them absolutely or as an aesthetic mapping. I note that if I set an lwd value, it overrides the size aesthetic: ggplot(df, aes(x=x, y=y)) + 
  geom_point(aes(fill=id, size=id), colour="black", shape=21, lwd=2)
 How do I control the border thickness?
@CODE:shape fill col df <- data.frame(id=runif(12), x=1:12, y=runif(12))
ggplot(df, aes(x=x, y=y)) + 
  geom_point(aes(fill=id, size=id), colour="black", shape=21) lwd size ggplot(df, aes(x=x, y=y)) +

@TITLE:Working with AutoLayout in Portrait and Landscape
@CONTENT:Auto Layout, as good as it is, driving me crazy with constraints. I have the portrait mode designed in IB but I can't get the desired landscape orientation to work. Notice that when the orientation changes to landscape, the spacing between the UIImageView blocks decreases and the text alignment of SAMPLE TEXT changes to right aligned. Currently, I have added a few constraints for it to work. However, I need to keep the space between UIImageView blocks fixed, as a result of which it looks cramped up in portrait and fine in landscape. I need it to be spread out evenly in portrait and compress in landscape (like in image above). Similarly, currently my constraints bring up the text but it doesnot keep it at the center of screen and right aligned. Is this possible at all with Auto Layout? If so, how? Help greatly appreciated.

@TITLE:MVC4 Bundles - No Twitter Bootstrap icons
@CONTENT:Running my MVC4 app in debug mode (so no minification of css/scripts) works fine. As soon as I run without debug (css/scripts minified), my Twitter Bootstrap icons do not get displayed. Another thread on here suggested using bundles.IgnoreList.Clear(). But that does not seem to work for me. My BundleConfig.RegisterBundles(...) looks like this: public static void RegisterBundles(BundleCollection bundles)
{
    bundles.IgnoreList.Clear();

    // Some JavaScript bundles only
    // ...

    bundles.Add(new StyleBundle("~/bundles/maincss").Include(
        "~/Content/bootstrap.css",
        "~/Content/bootstrap-responsive.css",
       "~/Content/my.css"));
    }
}
 All packages were installed using Nuget (as I say, it works fine in debug mode). My Content folder also contains the minified versions of both the bootstrap...css files, but not a minified version of my.css. The glyph icons are in the images sub-folder. My _Layout.cshtml looks like this: <head>
    ...
    @Styles.Render("~/bundles/maincss")
</head>
 I should add, that by "non-debug" mode, I mean setting the debug="false" option in the Web.config file: <compilation debug="false" targetFramework="4.5" />
 Does anyone have any idea why the twitter bootstrap icons do not show in "non-debug" mode? Thanks Rob

@LINK:/questions/8752627/how-can-i-split-a-javascript-application-into-multiple-files
@TITLE:How can I split a javascript application into multiple files?
@CONTENT:I created a javascript application with all of the code in one file. The application has grown quite a bit and I think it's time to split it up into multiple files, but I'm having a hard time figuring out how to do this. I think the problem lies with how I have decided to build the app, which uses the following template: var myApp = function(){

    //there are several global variables that all of the modules use;
    var global1, global2, module1, module2;

    global1 = {
        prop1:1
    };

    //There are also several functions that are shared between modules
    function globalFunction(){

    }

    var ModuleOne = function(){

        function doSomething(){
            //using the global function
            globalFunction();
        }

        return{
            doSomething:doSomething
        }
    };

    var ModuleTwo = function(){

        function doSomething(){
            //module 2 also needs the global function
            globalFunction();

            //Use the functionality in module 1
            //I can refactor this part to be loosely coupled/event driven
            module1.doSomething();
        }
    };

    module1 = new ModuleOne();
    module2 = new ModuleTwo();
};
 Even if all of the modules were loosely coupled and event driven, I still don't know how I would go about splitting this into multiple files given each module's reliance on the shared functions/variables. Does anyone have suggestions?
@CODE:var myApp = function(){

    //there are several global variables that all of the modules use;
    var global1, global2, module1, module2;

    global1 = {

    }

    var ModuleOne = function(){

        function doSomething(){
            //using the global function
            globalFunction();
        }

        return{
            doSomething:doSomething
        }
    };

    var ModuleTwo = function(){

        function doSomething(){

        }
    };

    module1 = new ModuleOne();
    module2 = new ModuleTwo();

@CONTENT:Just wanted to start by saying I have read a LOT of the questions on this site about this exact problem, but I'm still struggling to apply it to my scenario. If someone could help me out, that'd be great! :) I am trying to extract data from the following XML: $myXML = '<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<products><product uri="https://192.168.110.201:9630/api/products/1807/" id="1807"    resource_type="current"><code>DEMO - MC700X/A</code><flags><inventoried>true</inventoried><editable_sell>false</editable_sell><master_model>false</master_model></flags><sell_price>0.00</sell_price><description>Apple MC700X/A Demo</description><inventory><available>7</available><reserved>0</reserved><coming_for_stock>2.0</coming_for_stock><coming_for_customer>0.0</coming_for_customer><warehouses>0</warehouses><total>7</total></inventory><product_photos/></product></products>';
 I am using SimpleXML to put it into a PHP variable (object?) like this: $xml = new SimpleXMLElement($myXML);
 If I do a: echo '<pre>';
print_r($xml);
echo '</pre>';
 I get the following returned: SimpleXMLElement Object
(
    [product] => SimpleXMLElement Object

echo '<pre>';
echo($xml->product->code);
echo '<br>';
echo($xml->product->sell_price);
echo '<br>';
echo($xml->product->inventory->available);
echo '<br>';
echo '</pre>';
 This returns: DEMO - MC700X/A
0.00

 But I need to be able to access the "id" tag in the base "product" element (i.e. the @attributes bit), but can't work it out. I've been reading a lot, and figured that I should be able to use the attributes() method, but I can't work it out exactly. Trying this didn't work: echo '<pre>';
echo($xml->attributes());
echo '<br>';
echo '</pre>';
 It just returns nothing. Can someone please help me? I want to be able to display the "id" tag.. i.e. what I would expect to be: echo $xml['product']['@attributes']['id'];
 obviously doesn't work either. Thanks!! John

@TITLE:Buffer Overflow Attack
@CONTENT:I'm trying to execute a very simple buffer overflow attack. I'm pretty much a newbie to this. So, if this question is stupid, please excuse me :-) The code: #include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>

int i, n;

void confused(int i) 
{
 printf("**Who called me? Why am I here?? *** %x\n ", i);
}

void shell_call(char *c) 
{
 printf(" ***Now calling \"%s\" shell command *** \n", c);
 system(c);
}

void victim_func()
{
 int a[4];
 printf("Enter n:  ");  scanf("%d",&n);
 printf("~~~~~~~~~~~~~ values and address of n locations ~~~~~~~~~~");
 for (i = 0;i <n ;i++) 
  printf ("\n a[%d] = %x, address = %x", i, a[i], &a[i]);
 printf("\nEnter %d HEX Values \n", n);

 // Buffer Overflow vulnerability HERE!

 for (i=0;i<n;i++)  scanf("%x",&a[i]);
   printf("Done reading junk numbers\n");
}

int main() 
{
 victim_func();
 printf(¡§\n done¡¨);
 return 0; 
}
 When I use objdump to get the function addresses, I have the following: main(): 0x804854d
Address of main() where printf() is called: 0x8048563
victim_func(): 0x8048455
confused(): 0x8048414
 Now, what I want is to jump to the function 'confused()' from victim_func() by overflowing the buffer there, and overwriting the return address to the address of confused(). And I want to return back from confused() to the printf() statement in main, and exit normally. So, I provide the following input Enter n: 7
Enter 7 HEX values:
1
2
3
4
5
8048414 (This is to jump to confused)
8048563 (this is to jump to printf() in main)
 Although, the program prints "Done" from that printf statement, it is jumping back to victim_func() and prints "Enter n:" What am I doing wrong? Any help would be greatly appreciated! PS: I'm not sure if I have put the question right. Please let me know, if any more information is needed.

@TITLE:How it is possible Service run indefinitely and also allow binding in android?
@CONTENT:I want a service which can run in the background until I stop, even if the component that started it is destroyed and also allows binding to the activities. How it is possible ? As per android bound services document - there are three ways of creating bound service Extending Binder class. Using Messenger. Using AIDL. I have created a bound service using messenger (2nd method). Activity is bind to service in its onStart() method and unbind in its onStop() method. Two way messaging (between activity and service) works properly. But problem is that when activity unbinds service, service is destroyed. But I want a service which can run indefinitely. It is possible as android Services Dev Guide - "Although this documentation generally discusses these two types of services separately, your service can work both ways¡Xit can be started (to run indefinitely) and also allow binding. It's simply a matter of whether you implement a couple callback methods: onStartCommand() to allow components to start it and onBind() to allow binding." I also implement onStartCommand() method in service and return START_STICKY, but it is never called. Looking at the lifecycle callbacks of bounded service in dev guide, there is no onStartCommand() callback method. Then how it is possible to run service until we stop and also allow binding? I am using eclipse platform in fedora 15 OS. Any Help.....

@TITLE:What is the difference between pthread_self() and gettid()? Which one should I use?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to set the CPU affinity of threads on Linux. I'd like to know which one of the following approaches is recommended: Get thread id using pthread_self() Set CPU affinity using pthread_setaffinity_np(....) by passing the thread id as an argument Get thread id using the gettid() call Set CPU affinity using sched_setaffinity(....) by passing the thread id in the place of the process id P.S: After setting the CPU affinity, I intend to increase the scheduling priority of the thread.

@LINK:/questions/6014674/gson-custom-deseralizer-for-one-variable-in-an-object
@TITLE:Gson custom deseralizer for one variable in an object
@CONTENT:My probelm example: We have an object type of Apple. Apple has some member variables: String appleName; // The apples name
String appleBrand; // The apples brand
List<Seed> seeds; // A list of seeds the apple has
 And the seed object looks as follows. String seedName; // The seeds name
long seedSize; // The size of the seed
 Now When I get an apple object, an apple could have more than one seed, or it could have one seed, or maybe no seeds! Example JSON apple with one seed: {
"apple" : {
   "apple_name" : "Jimmy", 
   "apple_brand" : "Awesome Brand" , 
   "seeds" : {"seed_name":"Loopy" , "seed_size":"14" }
  }
}
 Example JSON apple with two seeds: {
"apple" : {
   "apple_name" : "Jimmy" , 
   "apple_brand" : "Awesome Brand" , 
   "seeds" : [ 
      { 
         "seed_name" : "Loopy",
         "seed_size" : "14"
      },
      {
         "seed_name" : "Quake",
         "seed_size" : "26"
      } 
  ]}
}
 Now the issue here is the first example is a JSONObject for seeds, the second example is a JSONArray for seeds. Now I know its inconsistent JSON and the easiest way to fix it would be fix the JSON itself, but unfortunately I'm getting the JSON from some one else, so I cant fix it. What would be the easiest way to fix this issue?
@CODE:String appleName; // The apples name
String appleBrand; // The apples brand
List<Seed> seeds; // A list of seeds the apple has String seedName; // The seeds name
long seedSize; // The size of the seed {
"apple" : {
   "apple_name" : "Jimmy", 
   "apple_brand" : "Awesome Brand" , 
   "seeds" : {"seed_name":"Loopy" , "seed_size":"14" }
  }
} {
"apple" : {
   "apple_name" : "Jimmy" , 
   "apple_brand" : "Awesome Brand" , 
   "seeds" : [ 
      { 
         "seed_name" : "Loopy",
         "seed_size" : "14"
      },
      {
         "seed_name" : "Quake",
         "seed_size" : "26"
      } 
  ]}

@TITLE:Setting outer variable from anonymous inner class
@CONTENT:Is there any way to access caller-scoped variables from an anonymous inner class in Java? Here's the sample code to understand what I need: public Long getNumber(final String type, final String refNumber, final Long year) throws ServiceException {
    Long result = null;
    try {
        Session session = PersistenceHelper.getSession();
        session.doWork(new Work() {

                    CallableStatement st = conn.prepareCall("{ CALL PACKAGE.procedure(?, ?, ?, ?) }");
                    st.setString(1, type);
                    st.setString(2, refNumber);
                    st.setLong(3, year);

            });
    } catch (Exception e) {
        log.error(e);
    }
    return result;
}
 The code is in a DAO service class. Obviously it doesn't compile, because it asks that result be final, if it is -- it doesn't compile because I try to modify a final var. I'm bound to JDK5. Other than dropping the doWork() altogether, is there a way to set the result value from within doWork()?

    Long result = null;
    try {

If someone could help me out, that'd be great! :) I am trying to extract data from the following XML: $myXML = '<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<products><product uri="https://192.168.110.201:9630/api/products/1807/" id="1807"    resource_type="current"><code>DEMO - MC700X/A</code><flags><inventoried>true</inventoried><editable_sell>false</editable_sell><master_model>false</master_model></flags><sell_price>0.00</sell_price><description>Apple MC700X/A Demo</description><inventory><available>7</available><reserved>0</reserved><coming_for_stock>2.0</coming_for_stock><coming_for_customer>0.0</coming_for_customer><warehouses>0</warehouses><total>7</total></inventory><product_photos/></product></products>';
 I am using SimpleXML to put it into a PHP variable (object?) like this: $xml = new SimpleXMLElement($myXML);
 If I do a: echo '<pre>';
print_r($xml);
echo '</pre>';

echo($xml->attributes());

 It just returns nothing. Can someone please help me? I want to be able to display the "id" tag.. i.e. what I would expect to be: echo $xml['product']['@attributes']['id'];

@TITLE:Buffer Overflow Attack
@CONTENT:I'm trying to execute a very simple buffer overflow attack. I'm pretty much a newbie to this. So, if this question is stupid, please excuse me :-) The code: #include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>

int i, n;

void confused(int i) 
{
 printf("**Who called me? Why am I here?? *** %x\n ", i);
}

void shell_call(char *c) 
{
 printf(" ***Now calling \"%s\" shell command *** \n", c);
 system(c);
}

void victim_func()
{
 int a[4];
 printf("Enter n:  ");  scanf("%d",&n);
 printf("~~~~~~~~~~~~~ values and address of n locations ~~~~~~~~~~");
 for (i = 0;i <n ;i++) 
  printf ("\n a[%d] = %x, address = %x", i, a[i], &a[i]);
 printf("\nEnter %d HEX Values \n", n);

 // Buffer Overflow vulnerability HERE!

 for (i=0;i<n;i++)  scanf("%x",&a[i]);
   printf("Done reading junk numbers\n");
}

int main() 
{
 victim_func();
 printf(¡§\n done¡¨);
 return 0; 
}
 When I use objdump to get the function addresses, I have the following: main(): 0x804854d
Address of main() where printf() is called: 0x8048563
victim_func(): 0x8048455
confused(): 0x8048414
 Now, what I want is to jump to the function 'confused()' from victim_func() by overflowing the buffer there, and overwriting the return address to the address of confused(). And I want to return back from confused() to the printf() statement in main, and exit normally. So, I provide the following input Enter n: 7
Enter 7 HEX values:
1
2
3
4
5
8048414 (This is to jump to confused)
8048563 (this is to jump to printf() in main)
 Although, the program prints "Done" from that printf statement, it is jumping back to victim_func() and prints "Enter n:" What am I doing wrong? Any help would be greatly appreciated! PS: I'm not sure if I have put the question right. Please let me know, if any more information is needed.

@TITLE:How it is possible Service run indefinitely and also allow binding in android?
@CONTENT:I want a service which can run in the background until I stop, even if the component that started it is destroyed and also allows binding to the activities. How it is possible ? As per android bound services document - there are three ways of creating bound service Extending Binder class. Using Messenger. Using AIDL. I have created a bound service using messenger (2nd method). Activity is bind to service in its onStart() method and unbind in its onStop() method. Two way messaging (between activity and service) works properly. But problem is that when activity unbinds service, service is destroyed. But I want a service which can run indefinitely. It is possible as android Services Dev Guide - "Although this documentation generally discusses these two types of services separately, your service can work both ways¡Xit can be started (to run indefinitely) and also allow binding. It's simply a matter of whether you implement a couple callback methods: onStartCommand() to allow components to start it and onBind() to allow binding." I also implement onStartCommand() method in service and return START_STICKY, but it is never called. Looking at the lifecycle callbacks of bounded service in dev guide, there is no onStartCommand() callback method. Then how it is possible to run service until we stop and also allow binding? I am using eclipse platform in fedora 15 OS. Any Help.....

@LINK:/questions/6014674/gson-custom-deseralizer-for-one-variable-in-an-object
@TITLE:Gson custom deseralizer for one variable in an object
@CONTENT:My probelm example: We have an object type of Apple. Apple has some member variables: String appleName; // The apples name
String appleBrand; // The apples brand
List<Seed> seeds; // A list of seeds the apple has
 And the seed object looks as follows. String seedName; // The seeds name
long seedSize; // The size of the seed
 Now When I get an apple object, an apple could have more than one seed, or it could have one seed, or maybe no seeds! Example JSON apple with one seed: {
"apple" : {
   "apple_name" : "Jimmy", 
   "apple_brand" : "Awesome Brand" , 
   "seeds" : {"seed_name":"Loopy" , "seed_size":"14" }
  }
}
 Example JSON apple with two seeds: {
"apple" : {
   "apple_name" : "Jimmy" , 
   "apple_brand" : "Awesome Brand" , 
   "seeds" : [ 
      { 
         "seed_name" : "Loopy",
         "seed_size" : "14"
      },
      {
         "seed_name" : "Quake",
         "seed_size" : "26"
      } 
  ]}
}
 Now the issue here is the first example is a JSONObject for seeds, the second example is a JSONArray for seeds. Now I know its inconsistent JSON and the easiest way to fix it would be fix the JSON itself, but unfortunately I'm getting the JSON from some one else, so I cant fix it. What would be the easiest way to fix this issue?
@CODE:String appleName; // The apples name
String appleBrand; // The apples brand
List<Seed> seeds; // A list of seeds the apple has String seedName; // The seeds name
long seedSize; // The size of the seed {
"apple" : {
   "apple_name" : "Jimmy", 
   "apple_brand" : "Awesome Brand" , 
   "seeds" : {"seed_name":"Loopy" , "seed_size":"14" }

@TITLE:Referencing figures with numbers in Sphinx and reStructuredText
@CONTENT:When writing RST that will be processed with Sphinx, I can't get Sphinx LaTeX output to use figure numbers when referencing figures. For instance, this code: The lemmings are attacking, as can be seen in :ref:`figlem`.

.. _figlem:

.. figure:: _static/lemming_invasion.* 

   They're coming!
 Will be converted into this: The lemmings are attacking, as can be seen in They're coming! /image goes here/ Figure 1.1: They're coming! But what I want is the "standard" LaTeX way of referencing figures, like this: The lemmings are attacking, as can be seen in Figure 1.1 How do I achieve this? The code I'm currently using is what the Sphinx manual recommends, but it doesn't produce the output I want.

@TITLE:Can standard Sun javac do incremental compiling?
@CONTENT:Recently I started to use Eclipse's java compiler, because it is significantly faster than standard javac. I was told that it's faster because it performs incremental compiling. But I'm still a bit unsure about this since I can't find any authoritative documentation about both - eclispse's and sun's - compilers "incremental feature". Is it true that Sun's compiler always compiles every source file and Eclipse's compiler compile only changed files and those that are affected by such a change? Edit: I'm not using Eclipse autobuild feature but instead I'm setting -Dbuild.compiler=org.eclipse.jdt.core.JDTCompilerAdapter

@TITLE:Delegate for an Action< ref T1, T2>
@CONTENT:I'm trying to create a delegate of a static method which takes a ref argument. Please don't ask why I'm doing such a cockamamie thing. It's all part of learning how .Net, C#, and reflection work and how to optimize it. My code is:     public struct DataRow
    {

        private double t;
        static public void Cram_T(ref DataRow dr, double a_t)
        {
            dr.t = a_t;
        }
    }
 ''''
  Type myType = typeof(DataRow);
  MethodInfo my_Cram_T_Method = myType.GetMethod("Cram_T");
  var myCram_T_Delegate = 
         Delegate.CreateDelegate(typeof(Action<DataRow, Double>),      
                                 my_Cram_T_Method) 
                                 as Action<DataRow, Double>;
 This gives me a binding error because (I think) the generic action doesn't match the method. Inspecting the value of Cram_T_Method in the watch window gives {Void Cram_T(DataRow ByRef, Double)}
 I then tried using the ref keyword in the Action:   var myCram_T_Delegate = 
         Delegate.CreateDelegate(typeof(Action<ref DataRow, Double>),         
                                 my_Cram_T_Method) 
                                 as Action<ref DataRow, Double>;
 But this won't compile. The C# compiler chokes at the token "ref". What is the right way to create this delegate?
@CODE:public struct DataRow
    {

        private double t;
        static public void Cram_T(ref DataRow dr, double a_t)

@TITLE:CollapsingToolbar not working with not-so-tall content
@CONTENT:I'm pretty sure this is a bug, so I'm asking for a workaround. My layout is like: <CoordinatorLayout>

    <AppBarLayout>
        <CollapsingToolbarLayout>
            <ImageView/>
            <Toolbar/>
        </CollapsingToolbarLayout>
    </AppBarLayout>

    <android.support.v4.widget.NestedScrollView/> <!-- content here -->

</CoordinatorLayout>
 I'm retrieving content from the web, and I don't know how tall it'll be - might be few lines, might be very long. However, I discovered that CollapsingToolbar doesn't work well when content is not big enough to cover the entire screen. Cases: content.height > screen.height : works; swiping top/bottom expands and collapses the toolbar, as well as scrolling content; content.height < screen.height : doesn't. That's not good, because most of the times (content.height + expandedToolbar.height) > screen.height! In other words, when content is not tall enough, even if content+expandedToolbar is much taller than the whole screen, it doesn't react to scroll gestures and shows some bugs - it might take ten gestures to collapse the toolbar a little bit. So you can hardly reach the bottom part of the content, which is hidden at the bottom because the toolbar is expanded. Any workaround? If you want to try, just take the cheesesquare sample project and delete (or reduce) the content inside NestedScrollView in activity_detail.xml [API17 here]
@CODE:<CoordinatorLayout>

    <AppBarLayout>
        <CollapsingToolbarLayout>
            <ImageView/>
            <Toolbar/>
        </CollapsingToolbarLayout>
    </AppBarLayout>

    <android.support.v4.widget.NestedScrollView/> <!-- content here -->

@TITLE:Convert from String to a Java enum with large amount of values [duplicate]
@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: Convert a String to an enum in Java 15 answers Let's say I have an enum with 100 values. For simplicity's sake, take the following example: public enum code
{
    CODE_1("string1"),
    CODE_2("string2"),
    CODE_3("string3"),
    CODE_4("string4"),
    ...
}
 I want to create a public method to convert strings with a known format (like "string1", "string2"...) to the appropiate enum value CODE_1, CODE_2... Typically this is done by iterating over all values, and if a match is found, return that enum value. (Details can be found in this question.) However, I'm concerned with reguraly looping over all values. Could this potentially be a huge bottleneck? What if instead of 100 element, there were 1000? As an exercise for myself, I tried to optimize this lookup with a static map, which can assure O(1) lookup time given any string. I like this extra gimmick, but I only want to include it in my code if it is actually necessary. What are your thoughts and findings on using the iterating method vs the map method? public enum Code
{
    ...
    //enum values
    ...

@TITLE:Run a controller function whenever a view is opened/shown
@CONTENT:I'm building an app with angular+ionic that uses a classic three-button menu at the bottom with three ion-tabs in it. When a user clicks a tab, that template opens through ui-router. I have states like this: $stateProvider
  .state('other', {
    url: "/other",
    abstract: true,
    templateUrl: "templates/other/other.html"
})
 In the template I do something like: <ion-nav-view name="other" ng-init="doSomething()"></ion-nav-view>
 I'm aware that I can write the doSomething() function in my controller and just call it manually there. That gives me the same problem though. I can't seem to figure out how to call the doSomething() function more than once, whenever somebody opens that view. Right now, the doSomething() function gets called just fine, but only the first time that view/tab gets opened by the user. I'd like to call a function (to update geolocation) whenever a user opens that view or tab. What would be a correct way to implement that? Thanks for helping out !

The problem It seems that the Dolphin web browser app (and "everything me launcher") somehow managed to bypass it, and now it shows a webpage (on the default web browser) each time the app is being uninstalled. This happens even if I uninstall using ADB. As a user, I really hate it, but it's still interesting since as far as I know, apps can't get intents for the uninstallation of themselves.

The commands I need to apply to each file (phylogenetic trees) within the directory are (which uses R's ape library): testtree <- read.tree("tree123.txt")
unrooted_tr <- unroot(testtree)
write.tree(unrooted_tr, file="unrootedtree123.txt")
 How do I apply a loop which will apply these commands to each individual .txt file (either using R or in the Unix command line)? The output (e.g. unrootedtree123.txt) will need to have a different name for each individual file. Thanks in advance, Dani.
@CODE:.txt testtree <- read.tree("tree123.txt")
unrooted_tr <- unroot(testtree)
write.tree(unrooted_tr, file="unrootedtree123.txt")

@TITLE:EF5 Code First - Changing A Column Type With Migrations
@CONTENT:I am new to EF5 Code First and I'm tinkering with a proof-of-concept before embarking on a project at work. I have initially created a model that looked something like public class Person {
  public int Id { get; set; }
  public string FirstName { get; set;}
  public string Surname {get;set;}
  public string Location {get;set;}
}
 And I added a few records using a little MVC application I stuck on the top. Now I want to change the Location column to an enum, something like: public class Person {
  public int Id { get; set; }
  public string FirstName { get; set;}
  public string Surname {get;set;}
  public Locations Location {get;set;}
}

public enum Locations {
  London = 1,
  Edinburgh = 2,
  Cardiff = 3
}
 When I add the new migration I get: AlterColumn("dbo.People", "Location", c => c.Int(nullable: false));
 but when I run update-database I get an error Conversion failed when converting the nvarchar value 'London' to data type int.
 Is there a way in the migration to truncate the table before it runs the alter statement? I know I can open the database and manually do it, but is there a smarter way?
@CODE:public class Person {
  public int Id { get; set; }
  public string FirstName { get; set;}
  public string Surname {get;set;}
  public string Location {get;set;}
} public class Person {
  public int Id { get; set; }
  public string FirstName { get; set;}
  public string Surname {get;set;}
  public Locations Location {get;set;}
}

public enum Locations {
  London = 1,
  Edinburgh = 2,
  Cardiff = 3
} AlterColumn("dbo.People", "Location", c => c.Int(nullable: false)); Conversion failed when converting the nvarchar value 'London' to data type int.

@TITLE:Send HTTP request from PHP without waiting for response?
@CONTENT:I want to have an HTTP GET request sent from PHP. Example: http://tracker.example.com?product_number=5230&price=123.52
 The idea is to do server-side web-analytics: Instead of sending tracking information from JavaScript to a server, the server sends tracking information directly to another server. Requirements: The request should take as little time as possible, in order to not noticeably delay processing of the PHP page. The response from the tracker.example.com does not need to be checked. As examples, some possible responses from tracker.example.com: 200: That's fine, but no need to check that. 404: Bad luck, but - again - no need to check that. 301: Although a redirect would be appropriate, it would delay processing of the PHP page, so don't do that. In short: All responses can be discarded. Ideas for solutions: In a now deleted answer, someone suggested calling command line curl from PHP in a shell process. This seems like a good idea, only that I don't know if forking a lot of shell processes under heavy load is a wise thing to do. I found php-ga, a package for doing server-side Google Analytics from PHP. On the project's page, it is mentioned: "Can be configured to [...] use non-blocking requests." So far I haven't found the time to investigate what method php-ga uses internally, but this method could be it! In a nutshell: What is the best solution to do generic server-side tracking/analytics from PHP.

@TITLE:Algorithm to split an array into P subarrays of balanced sum
@CONTENT:I have an big array of length N, let's say something like: 2 4 6 7 6 3 3 3 4 3 4 4 4 3 3 1
 I need to split this array into P subarrays (in this example, P=4 would be reasonable), such that the sum of the elements in each subarray is as close as possible to sigma, being: sigma=(sum of all elements in original array)/P
 In this example, sigma=15. For the sake of clarity, one possible result would be: 2 4 6    7 6 3 3   3 4 3 4    4 4 3 3 1
(sums: 12,19,14,15)
 I have written a very naive algorithm based in how I would do the divisions by hand, but I don't know how to impose the condition that a division whose sums are (14,14,14,14,19) is worse than one that is (15,14,16,14,16). Thank you in advance.

@TITLE:What does the `new` keyword do
@CONTENT:I'm following a Java tutorial online, trying to learn the language, and it's bouncing between two semantics for using arrays. long results[] = new long[3];
results[0] = 1;
results[1] = 2;
results[2] = 3;
 and: long results[] = {1, 2, 3};
 The tutorial never really mentioned why it switched back and forth between the two so I searched a little on the topic. My current understanding is that the new operator is creating an object of "array of longs" type. What I do not understand is why do I want that, and what are the ramifications of that? Are there certain "array" specific methods that won't work on an array unless it's an "array object"? Is there anything that I can't do with an "array object" that I can do with a normal array? Does the Java VM have to do clean up on objects initialized with the new operator that it wouldn't normally have to do? I'm coming from C, so my Java terminology, may not be correct here, so please ask for clarification if something's not understandable.

 I have also been into php.ini and set session.gc_maxlifetime = 86400 but this still hasn't fixed the problem. Currently, Im absolutely at a loss as to what else could be causing it to timeout and log the user out after roughly 15-30 minutes of inactivity. Ideally users should remain logged in for at least a day of inactivity (and beyond closing the browser window, browser preferences allowing). I've trawled google, Yii and stack overflow and just can't find anything that I'm overlooking... but clearly I am overlooking something. If anyone can help me out I'd be very grateful.

I am asking this question because i have a inline function for which i am facing compilation issues during linking(relocation error:... symbol has been discarded with discarded section ...).I made it a normal function and it worked.

{
   wizuiNotifier* notifier = ::wizNtrKit.getNotifier (nn_name);
   notifier->notify (arg, aspect);
}
 and this not inside a class.this is inside a header file! I guess the call to a static function should be done only in the particular TU where it is defined. since my function is in a hearder file and if i make it static, will it be the case that where ever i include that header file the static function can used used in that translation unit?

@TITLE:How to retain EditText data on orientation change?
@CONTENT:I have a Login screen which consists of 2 EditTexts for Username and Password. My requirement is that on orientation change , input data(if any) in EditText should remain as it is and a new layout should also be drawn. I have 2 layout xml files- one in layout folder and other in layout-land folder. I am trying to implement following 2 approaches but none of them is perfect: (1) configChanges:keyboardHidden - In this approach, I don't provide "orientaion" in configChanges in manifest file. So I call setContentView() method in both onCreate() and onConfigurationChanged() methods. It fulfills both my requirements. Layout is changed and input data in EditTexts also remains as it is. But it has a big problem : When user clicks on Login button, a ProgressDialog shows until server-response is received. Now if user rotates the device while ProgressDialog is running, app crashes. It shows an Exception saying "View cannot be attached to Window." I have tried to handle it using onSaveInstanceState (which DOES get called on orientation change) but app still crashes. (2) configChanges:orientation|keyboardHidden - In this approach, I provide "orientation" in manifest. So now I have 2 scenarios: (a) If I call setContentView() method in both onCreate() and onConfigurationChanged(), Layout is changed accordingly but EditText data is lost. (b) If I call setContentView() method in onCreate() , but not in onConfigurationChanged(), then EditText data is not lost but layout also not changes accordingly. And in this approach, onSaveInstanceState() is not even called. So I am in a really intimidating situation. Is there any solution to this problem? Please help. Thanx in advance.

@TITLE:Are there any other iOS system sounds available other than 'tock'?
@CONTENT:I have implemented an alternative keyboard on my first iPhone app. I would like to play a sound when a button is pressed. The default click sound when the standard keyboard is pressed would be fine, but I don't know how to get that sound. In this answer I found how to play a 'tock' sound: Playing system sound without importing your own I got this to work easily enough but it is a very loud sound. I've searched Stack Overflow and the Xcode help for available iOS system sounds other than 'tock' and I can't find them. Are there other built-in sounds, maybe even the default keyboard sound, that I can use?

 in the view controller that responsible for playing the function called but only if I i'm going to background in the current view controller. if i'm going to background from other view controller the function never called. that's why i want to put it in the app delegate.

@CONTENT:It's taken me some time to wrap my head around fragments, but this should be my last question on fragments, since I think I just about have them down. I know this is a huge mess of code to go through. But I'd appreciate the help, to make sure I'm not breaking any fundamental rules with fragments. I am going to post all of my code just to see if someone can "look over it" to see if I'm making any major mistakes or if I should go a simpler route.

 The application should show two buttons. The two buttons exist in a single fragment, and then if you hit a button, the fragment gets replaced with a new fragment that shows the proper text. As of right now, it should replace, but it only seems to add it on top.

@LINK:/questions/11142702/aspnet-webapi-post-parameter-is-null-when-sending-xml
@TITLE:AspNet WebApi POST parameter is null when sending XML
@CONTENT:I have a web api service originally using beta bits which I've rebuilt using the release candidate bits and I'm now having this problem. I have a POST action that takes a complex option as the only parameter. When I send the request with the body in json format the object is deserialised as expected, but if I send XML instead the parameter is null. In the beta I worked around this by disabling model binding as described in Carlos Figueira's blog post Disabling model binding on ASP.NET Web APIs Beta In the RC however they have removed the IRequestContentReadPolicy that this method was implementing. My action: public List<Models.Payload> Post([FromBody]Models.AimiRequest requestValues)
{
  try
  {
    if (requestValues == null)
    {
      var errorResponse = new HttpResponseMessage();
      errorResponse.StatusCode = HttpStatusCode.NotFound;
      errorResponse.Content = new StringContent("parameter 'request' is null");
      throw new HttpResponseException(errorResponse);
    }
    var metadataParams = new List<KeyValuePair<string, string>>();
    foreach (Models.MetadataQueryParameter param in requestValues.Metadata)
    {
      metadataParams.Add(new KeyValuePair<string, string>(param.Name, param.Value));
    }
    List<Core.Data.Payload> data = _payloadService.FindPayloads(metadataParams, requestValues.ContentType, requestValues.RuleTypes);
    var retVal = AutoMapper.Mapper.Map<List<Core.Data.Payload>, List<Models.Payload>>(data);
    return retVal; // new HttpResponseMessage<List<Models.Payload>>(retVal);
  }
  catch (System.Exception ex)
  {
    _logger.RaiseError(ex);
    throw;
  }
}
 My model: public class AimiRequest

  public MetadataQueryParameter[] Metadata { get; set; }

  public string RuleTypes { get; set; }
}

public class MetadataQueryParameter
{
  public string Name { get; set; }
  public string Value { get; set; }
}
 I'm testing using Fiddler to send requests to the service. This works and returns me the expected results. POST http://localhost:51657/api/search HTTP/1.1

@LINK:/questions/10428271/nsfetchedresultscontroller-doesnt-show-updates-from-a-different-context
@TITLE:NSFetchedResultsController doesn't show updates from a different context
@CONTENT:I have an NSFetchedResultsController and a few operations updates managed objects on separate threads via NSOperationQueue. The FRC (with its predicate) looks like this: - (NSFetchedResultsController*)fetchedResultsController
{
    if(fetchedResultsController) return fetchedResultsController;

    NSManagedObjectContext* mainContext = [self managedObjectContext];

    NSFetchRequest *fetchRequest = [[NSFetchRequest alloc] init];
    [fetchRequest setEntity:[NSEntityDescription entityForName:@"Check" inManagedObjectContext:mainContext]];
    [fetchRequest setPredicate:[NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@"isSync == %@", [NSNumber numberWithBool:NO]]];
    [fetchRequest setFetchBatchSize:10];

    fetchedResultsController = [[NSFetchedResultsController alloc] initWithFetchRequest:fetchRequest managedObjectContext:mainContext sectionNameKeyPath:nil cacheName:nil];
    fetchedResultsController.delegate = self;

    [fetchRequest release], fetchRequest = nil;

    return fetchedResultsController;
}
 The main thread and the threaded operation have their own managed object contexts. They only share the same coordinator. Within the threaded operation I change the isSync property from NO to YES. To know what is Check entity to update, the main context passes to the threaded one a NSManagedObjectID. The threaded operation retrieves the managed object like the following: -(void)main
{
    NSAutoreleasePool *pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];

    NSManagedObjectContext *exportContext = [[NSManagedObjectContext alloc] init];
    [exportContext setPersistentStoreCoordinator:[self persistentStoreCoordinator]];

    //...

    Check* check = (Check*)[exportContext existingObjectWithID:objID error:&error];
    check.isSync = [NSNumber numberWithBool:YES];

    //...

    [exportContext save:&error];

    [pool release], pool = nil;
}
 When the thread operation calls a save the mergeChangesFromContextDidSaveNotification notification is called and the main context merges the changes. - (void)contextChanged:(NSNotification*)notification
{
    if ([notification object] == [self managedObjectContext]) return;

    if (![NSThread isMainThread]) {
        [self performSelectorOnMainThread:@selector(contextChanged:) withObject:notification waitUntilDone:YES];
        return;
    }

    [[self managedObjectContext] mergeChangesFromContextDidSaveNotification:notification];
}
 Logging the description of the notification leads to verify that changes are performed correctly. My problem Delegates methods of NSFetchedResultsControllerDelegate are not called. This is quite strange since dealing with the same context, the main one, allows to listen for changes and delegates methods are called, e.g. deleting a row object in the UITableView. I've found some topics on SO with the same problem. I've tried all the workarounds but I cannot find a valuable solution: NSFetchedResultsController not showing updates from other contexts NSFetchedResultsController not firing delegate method after merging update from background thread NSFetchedResultsController with predicate ignores changes merged from different NSManagedObjectContext Thank you in advance. Edit The code above was working in a previous model. Then I created a new model copying (and pasting) entities from the previous one and now it doesn't work anymore. Suggestions? Edit 2 This is the predicate I'm using in NSFetchedResultsController getter. It's my fault, but when I wrote the post I didn't copy it. NSSortDescriptor *sortDescriptor = [[NSSortDescriptor alloc] initWithKey:@"insertionDate" ascending:NO];
NSArray *sortDescriptors = [[NSArray alloc] initWithObjects:sortDescriptor, nil];

// previous code here
[fetchRequest setSortDescriptors:sortDescriptors];
 Now, about Jody last comment In the main() of your NSOperation, you are loading new objects, and in there it looks like you are setting isSync to YES for each new object. The predicate you use for the fetchedResultsController is looking only for objects that have isSync == NO. I expecting that when the property isSync is set to YES, the NSFetchedResultsController observes that changes and removes rows that not match the predicate. Am I wrong? Remember that when merging changes from the background to the main thread, I'm able to see that few objects have updated their isSync property.

@TITLE:How can I copy files bigger than 5 GB in Amazon S3?
@CONTENT:Amazon S3 REST API documentation says there's a size limit of 5gb for upload in a PUT operation. Files bigger than that have to be uploaded using multipart. Fine. However, what I need in essence is to rename files that might be bigger than that. As far as I know there's no rename or move operation, therefore I have to copy the file to the new location and delete the old one. How exactly that is done with files bigger than 5gb? I have to do a multipart upload from the bucket to itself? In that case, how splitting the file in parts work? From reading boto's source it doesn't seem like it does anything like this automatically for files bigger than 5gb. Is there any built-in support that I missed?

@TITLE:How to replace string in all documents in Mongo
@CONTENT:I need to replace a string in certain documents. I have googled this code, but it unfortunately does not change anything. I am not sure about the syntax on the line bellow: pulpdb = db.getSisterDB("pulp_database");
var cursor = pulpdb.repos.find();
while (cursor.hasNext()) {
  var x = cursor.next();
  x['source']['url'].replace('aaa', 'bbb'); // is this correct?
  db.foo.update({_id : x._id}, x);
}
 I would like to add some debug prints to see what the value is, but I have no experiences with MongoDB Shell. I just need to replace this: { "source": { "url": "http://aaa/xxx/yyy" } }
 with { "source": { "url": "http://bbb/xxx/yyy" } }

@CONTENT:Given the following path (for example) which describes a SVG cubic bezier curve: "M300,140C300,40,500,40,500,140", and assuming a straight line connecting the end points 300,140 to 500,140 (closing the area under the curve), is it possible to calculate the area so enclosed? Can anyone suggest a formula (or javascript) to accomplish this? I've been researching this for a while but apparently I'm just not using the right search terms...

 When the capistrano attempts to run assets:precompile I think this variable is throwing the error because it is the first variable in the first scss file that is attempted to be precompiled.

@TITLE:How does jquery mobile hide mobile safari's addressbar?
@CONTENT:How does jQuery mobile hide mobile safari's addressbar? I think I need a similar solution, but i don't want to use jQuery mobile ... I tried: http://davidwalsh.name/hide-address-bar but that doesn't work in my case. My first child of the body is an absolute positioned div with -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch; The -webkit-overflow-scrolling property seems to cause this problem, without that property it works fine. Part of this problem is the address bar always stays in foreground, even if I scroll the page down per hand. this is caused by the absolute positioning. But, without absolute positioning, "-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;" doesn't work ... After a big fight with thousends of lines jquery-mobile code, i ended up with this ;) Solution <!DOCTYPE html>

@TITLE:Header div stays at top, vertical scrolling div below with scrollbar only attached to that div
@CONTENT:I have 2 main divs, the header and a scrolling list contained in a div. I want the header to always remain at the top of the page, and the scrolling list below. The scrollbar should be attached to the scrolling div and not to the whole page, i.e. the scrollbar does not appear on the right of the header, just the scrolling div. This is what i'm trying to achieve: ______________________

|                  |*|
----------------------

* = scrollbar
 The layout should be fluid and if the window is stretched vertically, only the container div and it's scrollbar should get longer. I don't want to position the header position: fixed; as then the scrollbar will be on the right of it instead of underneath it. Here's what i have so far, in chrome on OSX you can see the scrollbar i want to use under the header but it's not being used and the whole window is scrolling. http://cosmicduck.net/viewr/

@TITLE:How to do the exact same functionality as the Publish inside visual studio from powershell
@CONTENT:I want to know how to publish from PowerShell the same way I can from Visual Studio. When you launch Visual Studio with MVC project for example; then right-click on the project and select "Publish"; a dialog box comes up that you fill out a few settings in the click Publish again. It magically pushes your website out as expected. It also creates a file to hold those settings. projectName.Publish.xml. That file is the reason I want to be able to use this in exactly the same manner. There are a couple of settings that could manipulated in powershell to push the application to multiple sites with differing configurations. I have looked at "msbuild target:publish" which only produces (run from the directory containing the .csproj): MSBUILD : error MSB1009: Project file does not exist.
Switch: target:publish 
 I have tried "msbuild projectfile target:publish" which produces: MSBUILD : error MSB1008: Only one project can be specified.
Switch: target:build
 I've also looked at several msdeploy variations. It can't be this difficult!? If you can right-click in studio there has be something that performs that task. I'm starting to wonder if this requires a full moon and cutting the head off a chicken. (I've spent to much time on this!) **EDIT: I tried Lee's suggestion: msbuild target:publish Mvc.csproj
 Which produces this error: MSBUILD : error MSB1008: Only one project can be specified.
Switch: Mvc.csproj

For switch syntax, type "MSBuild /help"
 **EDIT: From DaveE's suggestion, I tried: msbuild target:publish Mvc.csproj
 Which produces this error: MSBUILD : error MSB1009: Project file does not exist.
Switch: target:publish=PassportHealth.PatientSimple.Mvc.csproj
 I also went back to the documentation for the "Publish" target (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms165431.aspx) which seems pretty clear that the syntax is: msbuild target:publish
 So after rereading this several times my conclusion is this: the publish target is for one-click deployments of .exe files not MVC web sites. I have found http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/09/13/automating-deployment-with-microsoft-web-deploy.aspx which speaks to this matter fairly clearly. I don't see how to utilized the "publish.xml" file in this via the msdeploy command yet though.

How can I extract the unique rows, without converting back to data frames? Here is an example: library(data.table)

a <- as.data.frame(a)

dim(b) # 40  3

# Unique rows using all columns
dim(unique(a))  # 8 3
dim(unique(b))  # 34 3

# Unique rows using only a subset of columns
dim(unique(a[,c("V1","V2")]))   # 4 2
dim(unique(b[,list(V1,V2)]))    # 29 2
 Related question: Is this behavior a result of the data being unsorted, as with the Unix uniq function?

@CONTENT:What are the conceptual differences between rdf:resource, rdf:about, and rdf:ID. I did some investigation but the difference between them are not clear for me yet. For example, whether rdf:ID is used when declaring a resource for the first time, rdf:resource is used for referencing an already existing resource,?etc. I would be glad if you provide some little examples.

@TITLE:Fastest 2D convolution or image filter in Python
@CONTENT:Several users have asked about the speed or memory consumption of image convolutions in numpy or scipy [1, 2, 3, 4]. From the responses and my experience using Numpy, I believe this may be a major shortcoming of numpy compared to Matlab or IDL. None of the answers so far have addressed the overall question, so here it is: "What is the fastest method for computing a 2D convolution in Python?" Common python modules are fair game: numpy, scipy, and PIL (others?). For the sake of a challenging comparison, I'd like to propose the following rules: Input matrices are 2048x2048 and 32x32, respectively. Single or double precision floating point are both acceptable. Time spent converting your input matrix to the appropriate format doesn't count -- just the convolution step. Replacing the input matrix with your output is acceptable (does any python library support that?) Direct DLL calls to common C libraries are alright -- lapack or scalapack PyCUDA is right out. It's not fair to use your custom GPU hardware.

@LINK:/questions/5325554/javascript-functions-and-arguments-object-is-there-a-cost-involved
@TITLE:javascript functions and arguments object, is there a cost involved
@CONTENT:It is common place to see code like that around the web and in frameworks: var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);
 In doing so, you convert the arguments Object into a real Array (as much as JS has real arrays anyway) and it allows for whatever array methods you have in your Array prototypes to be applied to it, etc etc. I remember reading somewhere that accessing the arguments Object directly can be significantly slower than an Array clone or than the obvious choice of named arguments. Is there any truth to that and under what circumstances / browsers does it incur a performance penalty to do so? Any articles on the subject you know of? update interesting find from http://bonsaiden.github.com/JavaScript-Garden/#function.arguments that invalidates what I read previously... Hoping the question gets some more answers from the likes of @Ivo Wetzel who wrote this. At the bottom of that section it says: Performance myths and truths The arguments object is always created with the only two exceptions being the cases where it is declared as a name inside of a function or one of its formal parameters. It does not matter whether it is used or not. this goes in conflict with http://www.jspatterns.com/arguments-considered-harmful/, which states: However, it's not a good idea to use arguments for the reasons of : performance security The arguments object is not automatically created every time the function is called, the JavaScript engine will only create it on-demand, if it's used. And that creation is not free in terms of performance. The difference between using arguments vs. not using it could be anywhere between 1.5 times to 4 times slower, depending on the browser clearly, can't both be correct, so which one is it? ECMA die-hard Dmitrty Soshnikov said: Which exactly ¡§JavaScript engine¡¨ is meant? Where did you get this exact info? Although, it can be true in some implementations (yep, it¡¦s the good optimization as all needed info about the context is available on parsing the code, so there¡¦s no need to create arguments object if it was not found on parsing), but as you know ECMA-262-3 statements, that arguments object is created each time on entering the execution context.

@CONTENT:I am a bit confused about this. I have an R package that has a small function (not a mayor part of the package) in which the principal function of the psych package is called. How do I correctly specify this in DESCRIPTION and NAMESPACE? Setting Depends: psych in DESCRIPTION makes sure the psych package is loaded every time my package is loaded. This works, but it seems redundant for such a small part of my package. Setting Suggests: psych and entering a require("psych") in the function is what I do now, however this does not work if psych is not installed, and seems to be the wrong way of doing this (writing R extensions says that suggest is meant mainly for examples). I think I need to import the function. I tried setting Imports: psych in DESCRIPTION and importFrom(psych,"principal") in NAMESPACE. This works, but on a computer that does not has psych installed it gives an error when loading my package.
@CODE:principal psych Depends: psych Suggests: psych require("psych") psych Imports: psych importFrom(psych,"principal") psych

For people that confuse XML with SGML: Please read this: http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-sgml-xml-971215#null (in short, there are enough subtle differences to at least make it unusable in it's vanilla form) For people who are fond of asking posters to Google it: I already did and the closest I could come up with was the widely popular SAXParser: http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/javax/xml/parsers/SAXParser.html But that of course is meant to be an XML parser. I'm looking around to see if anyone has implemented a modification of the SAX Parser to accommodate SGML. Lastly, I cannot use SX as I'm looking for a Java solution. Thanks! :)

@TITLE:Jquery hide() and show() runs too slow in google chrome
@CONTENT:I have a web application that doesn't run correctly in chrome. Works perfectly in Firefox. I have a page with a large numbered of list items, 316 to be exact. Each list item contains a large amount of HTML. My problem is when I want to hide or show these list items. I have a test page on jsFiddle to show the problem I'm having. I stripped down the HTML page to one unordered list to hold all 316 list items. I have two buttons that simply call jQuery hide or show when clicked. Again this runs fast in Firefox, Opera, even IE, pretty well in Safari but in Google Chrome it can take over 30 seconds which brings up the dialog window asking if you want to kill the page because a script is running to long.

@LINK:/questions/4812633/making-a-a-a-functor
@TITLE:Making (a, a) a Functor
@CONTENT:How can I make (a, a) a Functor without resorting to a newtype? Basically I want it to work like this: instance Functor (a, a) where
  fmap f (x, y) = (f x, f y)
 But of course that's not a legal way to express it: Kind mis-match
The first argument of `Functor' should have kind `* -> *',
but `(a, a)' has kind `*'
In the instance declaration for `Functor (a, a)'
 What I really want is a type-level function like this: \a -> (a, a) (invalid syntax). So a type alias, perhaps? type V2 a = (a, a)
instance Functor V2 where
    fmap f (x, y) = (f x, f y)
 I would think this would work, but it doesn't. First I get this complaint: Illegal instance declaration for `Functor V2'
(All instance types must be of the form (T t1 ... tn)
 where T is not a synonym.
 Use -XTypeSynonymInstances if you want to disable this.)
In the instance declaration for `Functor V2'
 If I follow the advice and add the TypeSynonymInstances extension, I get a new error: Type synonym `V2' should have 1 argument, but has been given 0
In the instance declaration for `Functor V2'
 Well, duh, that's the point! V2 has kind * -> * which is what is required of a Functor instance. Well, ok, I can use a newtype like this: newtype V2 a = V2 (a, a)
instance Functor V2 where
  fmap f (V2 (x, y)) = V2 (f x, f y)
 But now I've got to sprinkle V2s liberally throughout my code instead of just being able to deal with simple tuples, which kind of defeats the point of making it a Functor; at that point I might as well make my own function vmap :: (a -> b) -> (a, a) -> (b, b). So is there any way to do this nicely, i.e. without a newtype?

@CONTENT:I've begun playing around with styles and such in my android applications, and I have gotten everything working so far. I quite understood the 'style' section of the guide. But, looking around, as in this thread, I can't really figure out the difference between the two (declare-stylable and style). From my understanding declare-styleable takes the attribute specified in it and specifies it as styleable, and then from the code one changes it as he wants. But if this is what it really does, wouldn't it be simpler to just define the attribute in the layout? Or declare a style specifying it?

@TITLE:Multiple Combo Boxes With The Same Data Source (C#)
@CONTENT:UPDATE: This is now resolved, see answer below. On one of my forms (in a Windows Forms application) I have 3 Combo Boxes. These combo boxes need to display a list of prices (In text, with an integer back-end value). All of these combo boxes are using the same data source (A List<> of type TSPrice, with ValueMember set to Price and DisplayMember set to Description). My problem is this... Everytime I choose a price option from one of the dropdowns, they ALL change to the same value... Is this something to do with them all being bound to the same data source? Here is how I am binding them: var priceList = new List<TSPrice>
                    {
                        new TSPrice(0, ""),
                        new TSPrice(0, "Half Day"),
                        new TSPrice(0, "Full Day"),
                        new TSPrice(0, "1 + Half"),
                        new TSPrice(0, "2 Days"),
                        new TSPrice(0, "Formal Quote Required")
                    };

objInsuredPrice.DataSource = priceList;
objTPPrice.DataSource = priceList;
objProvSum.DataSource = priceList;

objInsuredPrice.ValueMember = "Price";
objTPPrice.ValueMember = "Price";
objProvSum.ValueMember = "Price";

objInsuredPrice.DisplayMember = "Description";
objTPPrice.DisplayMember = "Description";
objProvSum.DisplayMember = "Description";

objInsuredPrice.SelectedIndex = 0;
objTPPrice.SelectedIndex = 0;
objProvSum.SelectedIndex = 0;

//objInsuredPrice.DataSource      = objTPPrice.DataSource     = objProvSum.DataSource     = priceList;
//objInsuredPrice.ValueMember     = objTPPrice.ValueMember    = objProvSum.ValueMember    = "Price";
//objInsuredPrice.DisplayMember   = objTPPrice.DisplayMember  = objProvSum.DisplayMember  = "Description";
//objInsuredPrice.SelectedIndex   = objTPPrice.SelectedIndex  = objProvSum.SelectedIndex  = 0;
 Edit: The issue was that they were all being bound to the same DataSource as confirmed by Saurabh. This is how I solved it. var priceList = new List<TSPrice>
                    {
                        new TSPrice(0, ""),

@TITLE:How to embed image in html in MFMailComposeViewController for iPhone
@CONTENT:I am trying to embed a bunch of small images in an html table which I want to send using MFMailComposeViewController. After doing some search I figured out almost everyone is suggesting "NSData+Base64 by Matt Gallagher" class to encode the photo in Base64encoding and embedding it into html. While it looks to work on iPhone and with some email servers but Gmail and Yahoo do not show the images embedded this way. This problem is mentioned here as well. I was wondering if anyone has a better solution for this. I don't want to upload photos on the web and put the link in the html code. I would like the image to be attached to the email and show up as an inline image within html text,table,...

@TITLE:How to debug ruby code?
@CONTENT:I run Ubuntu 10.10. I just want to debug a simple script. After spending half a day trying to figure out how that could be done I give up. What the heck am I supposed to do? I installed ruby-dev from the Ubuntu repository I ran sudo gem install ruby-debug and sudo gem install ruby-debug-ide I tried a few different ways to make this work. I tried require 'ruby-debug' and then setting debugger somewhere in the code. But Ruby won't find ruby-debug. I tried setting up vim-ruby-debugger, which will take ages to execute :Rdebugger myScript.rb and will allow me to set breakpoints, but there doesn't seem to be a way to execute my code using that debugger. And I tried to use NetBeans which simply crashed every time I set up the project and clicked anything. So, dear community: There must be a way to debug Ruby. Not Rails. Nothing fancy. Just some CLI script. Please help me or I lose what is left of my sanity. Edit: the gem exec dir was not in my path. So, at least rdebug seems to work now.

@TITLE:Serialization third-party classes with Simple XML (org.simpleframework.xml)
@CONTENT:I have decided to use Simple XML serialization and was stucked with basic problem. I am trying to serialize java.util.UUID class instance as final field in this small class: @Root
public class Identity {
    @Attribute
    private final UUID id;

    public Identity(@Attribute UUID id) {
        this.id = id;
    } 
}
 Tutorial shows how to serialize third-party objects by registering converters like this: Registry registry = new Registry();
registry.bind(UUID.class, UUIDConverter.class);
Strategy strategy = new RegistryStrategy(registry);
Serializer serializer = new Persister(strategy);

serializer.write( object, stream );
 appropriate converter for UUID is pretty simple: public class UUIDConverter implements Converter<UUID> {
    @Override
    public UUID read(InputNode node) throws Exception {
       return new UUID.fromString(node.getValue());
    }
    @Override
    public void write(OutputNode node, UUID value) throws Exception {
       node.setValue(value.toString());
    }
}
 But this simple code just didn't work for me, during serialization objects with UUID fields was thrown exception Transform of class java.util.UUID not supported. I have tried something something similar with custom Matcher (which was not in tutorial) that works for me: Serializer serializer = new Persister(new MyMatcher());

serializer.write( object, stream );
 and Matcher class looks like this: public static class MyMatcher implements Matcher {
    @Override
    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
    public Transform match(Class type) throws Exception {
        if (type.equals(UUID.class))
            return new UUIDTransform();
        return null;
    }
}

public class UUIDTransform implements Transform<UUID> {
    @Override
    public UUID read(String value) throws Exception {
        return UUID.fromString(value);
    }
    @Override
    public String write(UUID value) throws Exception {
        return value.toString();
    }
}
 Questions: Is custom Matcher always recommended practice for streaming third-party classes? In which case I can use Converter? Are there any better tutorials/examples for Simple XML out there? Thank you.

@CONTENT:I'll be the first to admit that my overall knowledge of low level programming is a bit sparse. I understand many of the core concepts but I do not use them on a regular basis. That being said I was absolutely astounded at how much code was needed for dtoa.c. For the past couple months I have been working on an ECMAScript implementation in C# and I've been slowing filling in the holes in my engine. Last night I started working on Number.prototype.toString which is described in section 15.7.4.2 of the ECMAScript specification (pdf). In section 9.8.1, NOTE 3 offers a link to dtoa.c but I was looking for a challenge so I waited to view it. The following is what I came up with. private IDynamic ToString(Engine engine, Args args)

    }
    else if (radix == 10D)
    {
        return num.ToStringPrimitive();

    var sb = new StringBuilder();
    var isNegative = false;

    if (num < 0D)

        isNegative = true;
        num = -num;
    }

    var integralPart = Math.Truncate(num);
    var decimalPart = (double)((decimal)num.Value - (decimal)integralPart);
    var radixChars = RadixMap.GetArray((int)radix);

    if (integralPart == 0D)

@CONTENT:Let's say I have the following simple classes: public class Person
{

    public string Name { get; set; }
}

public class PersonHolder
{
    public Person CurrentPerson { get; set; }
    public int ActiveId { get; set; }
}
 Now I have a grid with an instance of class PersonHolder as DataContext, and in the grid I have a StackPanel which is bound to the CurrentPerson of PersonHolder - showing its data: <Grid>
    <StackPanel x:Name="PersonPanel" DataContext="{Binding CurrentPerson}">
        <TextBlock Text="{Binding Id}" />
        <TextBlock Text="{Binding Name}" />            
    </StackPanel>        
</Grid>
 So - to the question: How can I give the StackPanel a green background when the CurrentPerson has an Id matching the ActiveId of the PersonHolder (yeah, very useful, but this is just an extremely simplified example..). My thought is that this is something one uses a trigger for, but can I use bindings in my trigger condition value? If so I could do something like this: <Grid x:Name="Foo">
    <StackPanel x:Name="PersonPanel" DataContext="{Binding CurrentPerson}">
        <TextBlock Text="{Binding Id}" />
        <TextBlock Text="{Binding Name}" />
        <StackPanel.Triggers>
            <DataTrigger Binding="{Binding Id}" Value="{Binding ElementName=Foo, Path=ActiveId}">
                <Setter TargetName="PersonPanel" Property="Background" Value="Green" />
            </DataTrigger>
        </StackPanel.Triggers>
    </StackPanel>        
</Grid>
 But this doesn't work. How can I solve this?
@CODE:public class Person
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
}

public class PersonHolder
{

@TITLE:Garbage Collection and Threads
@CONTENT:AFAIK when a GC is doing its thing the VM blocks all running threads -- or at least when it is compacting the heap. Is this the case in modern implementions of the CLR and the JVM (Production versions as of January 2010) ? Please do not provide basic links on GC as I understand the rudimentary workings. I assume global locking is the case as when compaction occurs references might be invalid during the move period, and it seems simplest just to lock the entire heap (i.e., indirectly by blocking all threads). I can imagine more robust mechanisms, but KISS often prevails. If I am incorrect my question would be answered by a simple explanation of the strategy used to minimise blocking. If my assumption is correct please provide some insight on the following two questions: If this is indeed the behaviour, how do heavyweight enterprise engines like JBOSS and Glassfish maintain a consistantly high TPS rate ? I did some googling on JBOSS and I was expecting to find something on a APACHE like memory allocator suited for web processing. In the face of NUMA-esque architectures (potentially the near future) this sounds like a disaster unless the processes are CPU bound by thread and memory-allocation.

@TITLE:Multiple Combo Boxes With The Same Data Source (C#)
@CONTENT:UPDATE: This is now resolved, see answer below. On one of my forms (in a Windows Forms application) I have 3 Combo Boxes. These combo boxes need to display a list of prices (In text, with an integer back-end value). All of these combo boxes are using the same data source (A List<> of type TSPrice, with ValueMember set to Price and DisplayMember set to Description). My problem is this... Everytime I choose a price option from one of the dropdowns, they ALL change to the same value... Is this something to do with them all being bound to the same data source? Here is how I am binding them: var priceList = new List<TSPrice>
                    {
                        new TSPrice(0, ""),
                        new TSPrice(0, "Half Day"),
                        new TSPrice(0, "Full Day"),
                        new TSPrice(0, "1 + Half"),
                        new TSPrice(0, "2 Days"),
                        new TSPrice(0, "Formal Quote Required")
                    };

objInsuredPrice.DataSource = priceList;
objTPPrice.DataSource = priceList;
objProvSum.DataSource = priceList;

objInsuredPrice.ValueMember = "Price";
objTPPrice.ValueMember = "Price";
objProvSum.ValueMember = "Price";

objInsuredPrice.DisplayMember = "Description";
objTPPrice.DisplayMember = "Description";
objProvSum.DisplayMember = "Description";

objInsuredPrice.SelectedIndex = 0;
objTPPrice.SelectedIndex = 0;
objProvSum.SelectedIndex = 0;

//objInsuredPrice.DataSource      = objTPPrice.DataSource     = objProvSum.DataSource     = priceList;
//objInsuredPrice.ValueMember     = objTPPrice.ValueMember    = objProvSum.ValueMember    = "Price";
//objInsuredPrice.DisplayMember   = objTPPrice.DisplayMember  = objProvSum.DisplayMember  = "Description";
//objInsuredPrice.SelectedIndex   = objTPPrice.SelectedIndex  = objProvSum.SelectedIndex  = 0;
 Edit: The issue was that they were all being bound to the same DataSource as confirmed by Saurabh. This is how I solved it. var priceList = new List<TSPrice>
                    {
                        new TSPrice(0, ""),
                        new TSPrice(1, "Half Day"),
                        new TSPrice(2, "Full Day"),
                        new TSPrice(3, "1 + Half"),
                        new TSPrice(4, "2 Days"),
                        new TSPrice(5, "Formal Quote Required")
                    };

@TITLE:How to embed image in html in MFMailComposeViewController for iPhone
@CONTENT:I am trying to embed a bunch of small images in an html table which I want to send using MFMailComposeViewController. After doing some search I figured out almost everyone is suggesting "NSData+Base64 by Matt Gallagher" class to encode the photo in Base64encoding and embedding it into html. While it looks to work on iPhone and with some email servers but Gmail and Yahoo do not show the images embedded this way. This problem is mentioned here as well. I was wondering if anyone has a better solution for this. I don't want to upload photos on the web and put the link in the html code. I would like the image to be attached to the email and show up as an inline image within html text,table,...

@TITLE:How to debug ruby code?
@CONTENT:I run Ubuntu 10.10. I just want to debug a simple script. After spending half a day trying to figure out how that could be done I give up. What the heck am I supposed to do? I installed ruby-dev from the Ubuntu repository I ran sudo gem install ruby-debug and sudo gem install ruby-debug-ide I tried a few different ways to make this work. I tried require 'ruby-debug' and then setting debugger somewhere in the code. But Ruby won't find ruby-debug. I tried setting up vim-ruby-debugger, which will take ages to execute :Rdebugger myScript.rb and will allow me to set breakpoints, but there doesn't seem to be a way to execute my code using that debugger. And I tried to use NetBeans which simply crashed every time I set up the project and clicked anything. So, dear community: There must be a way to debug Ruby. Not Rails. Nothing fancy. Just some CLI script. Please help me or I lose what is left of my sanity. Edit: the gem exec dir was not in my path. So, at least rdebug seems to work now.

@LINK:/questions/3626208/serialization-third-party-classes-with-simple-xml-org-simpleframework-xml
@TITLE:Serialization third-party classes with Simple XML (org.simpleframework.xml)
@CONTENT:I have decided to use Simple XML serialization and was stucked with basic problem. I am trying to serialize java.util.UUID class instance as final field in this small class: @Root
public class Identity {
    @Attribute
    private final UUID id;

    public Identity(@Attribute UUID id) {
        this.id = id;
    } 
}
 Tutorial shows how to serialize third-party objects by registering converters like this: Registry registry = new Registry();
registry.bind(UUID.class, UUIDConverter.class);
Strategy strategy = new RegistryStrategy(registry);
Serializer serializer = new Persister(strategy);

serializer.write( object, stream );
 appropriate converter for UUID is pretty simple: public class UUIDConverter implements Converter<UUID> {
    @Override
    public UUID read(InputNode node) throws Exception {
       return new UUID.fromString(node.getValue());
    }
    @Override
    public void write(OutputNode node, UUID value) throws Exception {
       node.setValue(value.toString());
    }
}
 But this simple code just didn't work for me, during serialization objects with UUID fields was thrown exception Transform of class java.util.UUID not supported. I have tried something something similar with custom Matcher (which was not in tutorial) that works for me: Serializer serializer = new Persister(new MyMatcher());

serializer.write( object, stream );
 and Matcher class looks like this: public static class MyMatcher implements Matcher {
    @Override
    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
    public Transform match(Class type) throws Exception {
        if (type.equals(UUID.class))
            return new UUIDTransform();
        return null;
    }
}

public class UUIDTransform implements Transform<UUID> {
    @Override
    public UUID read(String value) throws Exception {
        return UUID.fromString(value);
    }
    @Override
    public String write(UUID value) throws Exception {
        return value.toString();
    }
}
 Questions: Is custom Matcher always recommended practice for streaming third-party classes? In which case I can use Converter? Are there any better tutorials/examples for Simple XML out there? Thank you.

@TITLE:Why does ¡§dtoa.c¡¨ contain so much code?
@CONTENT:I'll be the first to admit that my overall knowledge of low level programming is a bit sparse. I understand many of the core concepts but I do not use them on a regular basis. That being said I was absolutely astounded at how much code was needed for dtoa.c. For the past couple months I have been working on an ECMAScript implementation in C# and I've been slowing filling in the holes in my engine. Last night I started working on Number.prototype.toString which is described in section 15.7.4.2 of the ECMAScript specification (pdf). In section 9.8.1, NOTE 3 offers a link to dtoa.c but I was looking for a challenge so I waited to view it. The following is what I came up with. private IDynamic ToString(Engine engine, Args args)

@TITLE:Django MySQL full text search
@CONTENT:I need to implement full text search for my Django application, running MySQL as backend. Let's say I've got a model as follows: class MyItem(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField()
    short_description = models.TextField()
    description = models.TextField()
 I would like to have results first for search term occurences in title, then in short_description and at the end in description field. I'll be happier if I don't have to use additional modules/applications for this task. Any idea? Thanks in advance.

@LINK:/questions/2239839/using-bindings-in-datatrigger-condition
@TITLE:Using bindings in DataTrigger condition
@CONTENT:Let's say I have the following simple classes: public class Person
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
}

public class PersonHolder
{
    public Person CurrentPerson { get; set; }
    public int ActiveId { get; set; }
}
 Now I have a grid with an instance of class PersonHolder as DataContext, and in the grid I have a StackPanel which is bound to the CurrentPerson of PersonHolder - showing its data: <Grid>
    <StackPanel x:Name="PersonPanel" DataContext="{Binding CurrentPerson}">
        <TextBlock Text="{Binding Id}" />
        <TextBlock Text="{Binding Name}" />            
    </StackPanel>        
</Grid>
 So - to the question: How can I give the StackPanel a green background when the CurrentPerson has an Id matching the ActiveId of the PersonHolder (yeah, very useful, but this is just an extremely simplified example..). My thought is that this is something one uses a trigger for, but can I use bindings in my trigger condition value? If so I could do something like this: <Grid x:Name="Foo">
    <StackPanel x:Name="PersonPanel" DataContext="{Binding CurrentPerson}">
        <TextBlock Text="{Binding Id}" />
        <TextBlock Text="{Binding Name}" />
        <StackPanel.Triggers>
            <DataTrigger Binding="{Binding Id}" Value="{Binding ElementName=Foo, Path=ActiveId}">
                <Setter TargetName="PersonPanel" Property="Background" Value="Green" />
            </DataTrigger>
        </StackPanel.Triggers>
    </StackPanel>        
</Grid>
 But this doesn't work. How can I solve this?
@CODE:public class Person
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
}

public class PersonHolder
{
    public Person CurrentPerson { get; set; }
    public int ActiveId { get; set; }
} DataContext StackPanel CurrentPerson PersonHolder <Grid>
    <StackPanel x:Name="PersonPanel" DataContext="{Binding CurrentPerson}">
        <TextBlock Text="{Binding Id}" />
        <TextBlock Text="{Binding Name}" />            
    </StackPanel>        
</Grid> StackPanel CurrentPerson Id ActiveId PersonHolder <Grid x:Name="Foo">
    <StackPanel x:Name="PersonPanel" DataContext="{Binding CurrentPerson}">
        <TextBlock Text="{Binding Id}" />
        <TextBlock Text="{Binding Name}" />
        <StackPanel.Triggers>
            <DataTrigger Binding="{Binding Id}" Value="{Binding ElementName=Foo, Path=ActiveId}">
                <Setter TargetName="PersonPanel" Property="Background" Value="Green" />

@TITLE:Garbage Collection and Threads
@CONTENT:AFAIK when a GC is doing its thing the VM blocks all running threads -- or at least when it is compacting the heap. Is this the case in modern implementions of the CLR and the JVM (Production versions as of January 2010) ? Please do not provide basic links on GC as I understand the rudimentary workings. I assume global locking is the case as when compaction occurs references might be invalid during the move period, and it seems simplest just to lock the entire heap (i.e., indirectly by blocking all threads). I can imagine more robust mechanisms, but KISS often prevails. If I am incorrect my question would be answered by a simple explanation of the strategy used to minimise blocking. If my assumption is correct please provide some insight on the following two questions: If this is indeed the behaviour, how do heavyweight enterprise engines like JBOSS and Glassfish maintain a consistantly high TPS rate ? I did some googling on JBOSS and I was expecting to find something on a APACHE like memory allocator suited for web processing. In the face of NUMA-esque architectures (potentially the near future) this sounds like a disaster unless the processes are CPU bound by thread and memory-allocation.

@TITLE:How to reliably submit an HTML form with JavaScript?
@CONTENT:Is there a way to submit an HTML form using JavaScript that is guaranteed to work in all situations? I elaborate. The common approach seems to be: formElement.submit()
 That is all good and well except for one thing. Fields of a form are available as attributes of formElement, so if there is a field with name or id "text1", it can be accessed as formElement.text1. This means that if an elements is called "submit" (be it its name or its id), then formElement.submit() will not work. This is because formElement.submit won't be a method of the form, but the field with that name. Unfortunately, it's fairly common that submit buttons have a "submit" name or id. Two examples to illustrate my point. First, the following will NOT work, because an element of the form has name "submit": <form name="example" id="example" action="/">
  <button type="button" name="submit" onclick="document.example.submit(); return false;">Submit</button>
</form>
 The following will work though. The only difference is that I have removed the name "submit" from the form: <form name="example" id="example" action="/">
  <button type="button" onclick="document.example.submit(); return false;">Submit</button>
</form>
 So, is there any other way to submit an HTML form using JavaScript?
@CODE:formElement.submit() formElement formElement.text1 formElement.submit() formElement.submit <form name="example" id="example" action="/">
  <button type="button" name="submit" onclick="document.example.submit(); return false;">Submit</button>
</form> <form name="example" id="example" action="/">
  <button type="button" onclick="document.example.submit(); return false;">Submit</button>
</form> "action" "run"

@TITLE:C# for writing macros in Visual Studio?
@CONTENT:I started C# a while ago and really like it. I work with VS 2008 and really like it. I tried Resharper and loved it. Now I am starting with Macros in VS2008 to increase my coding speed a little more. And stumble upon visual basic. And I do not like that. Is there any way to write macros in C#. Or a workaround, in writing a plugin for VS to reach the same goal. Just let me stress out, its a productivity issue. I just want to automate some features I use often (create macro, assign shortcut, tell my touchscreen-app to send this shortcut)... So from an experts point of view, is there an easy way to e.g. "collapse all items in the solution explorer, but expand all starting with the letter A" (just a silly example) without using visual basic? Thanks for any tips, Chris PS: I was nearly happy with recording and playback. But, as it turns out, some "external" resharper command (like collapse all) do not play well with macros (getting strange com errors). So I thought, hey, a loop to collapse all items, I can do that. But unfortunately not really quick in VB :-)

I think, when using an IoC container (e.g. Spring), components can be easily configured if programmed accordingly. In this context either a propery IsUsingNetwork can be set by the IoC container or, if the "using network" implementation behaves differently, another implementation of that interface should be implemented and injected (e.g.: IService, ServiceImplementation, NetworkingServiceImplementation). Can somebody please provide citations of OO-Gurus or references in books which basically reads "Preprocessor usage is bad OO practice if you try to configure behaviour which should be configured via an IoC container"? I need this citations to convince coworkers to refactor... Edit: I do know and agree that using preprocessor directives to change targetplatform specific code during compilation is fine and that is what preprocessor directives are made for. However, I think that runtime-configuration should be used rather then compiletime-configuration to get good designed and testable classes and components. In other words: Using #defines and #if's beyond what they are meant for will lead to difficult to test code and badly designed classes.

@TITLE:Guaranteed file deletion upon program termination (C/C++)
@CONTENT:Win32's CreateFile has FILE_FLAG_DELETE_ON_CLOSE, but I'm on Linux. I want to open a temporary file which will always be deleted upon program termination. I could understand that in the case of a program crash it may not be practical to guarantee this, but in any other case I'd like it to work. I know about RAII. I know about signals. I know about atexit(3). I know I can open the file and delete it immediately and the file will remain accessible until the file descriptor is closed (which even handles a crash). None of these seem like a complete and straightforward solution: RAII: been there, done that: I have an object whose destructor deletes the file, but the destructor is not called if the program is terminated by a signal. signals: I'm writing a low-level library which makes registering a signal handler a tricky proposition. For example, what if the application uses signals itself? I don't want to step on any toes. I might consider some clever use of sigaction(2) to cope...but haven't put enough thought into this possibility yet. atexit(3): apparently useless, since it isn't called during abnormal termination (e.g. via a signal). preemptive unlink(2): this is pretty good except that I need the file to remain visible in the filesystem (otherwise the system is harder to monitor/troubleshoot). What would you do here? Further Explanation I elided one detail in my original post which I now realize I should have included. The "file" in this case is not strictly a normal file, but rather is a POSIX Message Queue. I create it via mq_open(). It can be closed via mq_close() or close() (the former is an alias for the latter on my system). It can be removed from the system via mq_unlink(). All of this makes it analogous to a regular file, except that I cannot choose the directory in which the file resides. This makes the current most popular answer (placing the file in /tmp) unworkable, because the "file" is created by the system in a virtual filesystem with very limited capacity. (I've mounted the virtual filesystem in /dev/mqueue, following the example in man mq_overview) . This also explains why I need the name to remain visible (making the immediate-unlink approach unworkable): the "file" must be shared between two or more processes.

  <Target Name="AfterBuild">
    <Test />

 I've set up the build order so "BuildTasks" gets built before "Model".

Could not load file or assembly 'file:///C:\WIP\TestSolution\src\BuildTasks\bin\BuildTasks.dll' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified. Confirm that the <UsingTask> declaration is correct, and that the assembly and all its dependencies are available. This file definitely exists, so why can't MSBuild find it? I've even tried hard-coding "C:\WIP\TestSolution" in place of "$(SolutionDir)" and get the same error. However, if I copy that .dll to my desktop and hard-code the path to my desktop, it DOES work, which I can't figure out why. EDIT: I don't have the path wrong. I modified the Debug/Release builds for BuildTasks to output the .dll to just the bin folder since I didn't want Debug/Release to have different paths.
@CODE:using Microsoft.Build.Utilities;

namespace BuildTasks
{
    public class Test : Task
    {
    	public override bool Execute()
    	{
    		Log.LogMessage( "FASDfasdf" );
    		return true;
    	}
    }
} <UsingTask TaskName="BuildTasks.Test" AssemblyFile="$(SolutionDir)src\BuildTasks\bin\BuildTasks.dll" />

@TITLE:NodeJS version number confusion
@CONTENT:I installed Node JS several months ago and played around a bit. Today, I wanted to start learning more about node and before coding, I decided I wanted to make sure I had the latest version. I checked the version and it was something like v0.10.3x. I looked on the NodeJS website and it shows the latest version as v4.1.0. So I thought Woahhh! I better upgrade and I couldn't believe it moved that fast to a 4.x version in only a few months. I spent quite some time trying to figure out how to completely uninstall node and npm because I couldn't seem to upgrade it. Finally I got it all ripped out, then installed in on CentOS 7 using yum. I know I won't get the latest version through yum but, I figured it would be close enough. After install, I am at v0.10.40. I have a feeling I just don't understand something about NodeJS version numbers. Can someone shed some light for me? Thanks in advance.

@TITLE:How to check if user is logged in with FB SDK 4.0 for Android?
@CONTENT:A few days ago I implemented FB Login to my APP, and today I found out that most of the things I have implemented are now deprecated. Before, I was using Session to see if the user was logged in or not. However, that doesn't work with the new SDK. According to their docs, we can use AccessToken.getCurrentAccessToken() and Profile.getCurrentProfile() to check if the user is already logged in, but I could not make use of those. I tried something like this: if(AccessToken.getCurrentAccessToken() == null)
 I wonder if that would work if I could use it inside of this (which is also provided by FB): LoginManager.getInstance().registerCallback(callbackManager, new LoginManager.Callback() {...});
 However, I get a "Cannot resolve symbol 'Callback'". EDIT!!!!!! Alright, so I was able to check if the user is logged in by using the following: On onCreate: accessTokenTracker = new AccessTokenTracker() {
        @Override
        protected void onCurrentAccessTokenChanged(AccessToken oldAccessToken, AccessToken newAccessToken) {
            updateWithToken(newAccessToken);
        }
    };
 Then, that calles my updateWithToken method: private void updateWithToken(AccessToken currentAccessToken) {
    if (currentAccessToken != null) {

            LOAD ACTIVITY A!

    } else {

            LOAD ACTIVITY B!
    }
}
 Now, the problem is: If the user has used the application and hasn logged in before, I can check for that! But if it is the first time that the user is using the app, updateWithToken is never called by my AccessTokenTracker. I'd really appreciate if someone could help. Thanks!
@CODE:Session AccessToken.getCurrentAccessToken() Profile.getCurrentProfile() if(AccessToken.getCurrentAccessToken() == null) LoginManager.getInstance().registerCallback(callbackManager, new LoginManager.Callback() {...}); accessTokenTracker = new AccessTokenTracker() {
        @Override
        protected void onCurrentAccessTokenChanged(AccessToken oldAccessToken, AccessToken newAccessToken) {
            updateWithToken(newAccessToken);
        }
    }; updateWithToken private void updateWithToken(AccessToken currentAccessToken) {
    if (currentAccessToken != null) {

            LOAD ACTIVITY A!

    } else {

            LOAD ACTIVITY B!
    }

@CONTENT:I am using less and Grunt, and am moving to gulp. My less works. When I run: lessc public/less/myapp.less
 I get working output with no errors. All my less, including includes, is in public/less, BTW. Here is my gulpfile: var gulp = require('gulp');
var prefixer = require('gulp-autoprefixer');
var less = require('gulp-less');

gulp.task('compileLess', function () {
  gulp
    .src('./public/less/*')

      filename: 'myapp.less'
    }))
    .pipe(gulp.dest('./public/css'));

  gulp.run('compileLess');

  // Watch files and run tasks if they change

 Why isn't gulp picking up my includes? Specifying 'paths' option for less should make it work, but it isn't fixing it. What's a good way to debug this? I don't have a line number, for example. Is there a way to make gulp work?

@CONTENT:I have a class AgentBalance with an association to Agent, thus: public class AgentBalance

    public int AgentId { get; set; }

    public virtual Agent Agent { get; set; }

}
 AgentId is detected as the FK for the Agent relationship by convention, but I want to make it explicit in the Mapping class, to be safer against future changes. If Agent had a collection of Balances then I know how to do this e.g.: HasRequired(t => t.Agent).WithMany(a => a.Balances).HasForeignKey(t => t.AgentId);
 However, Agent does not have a collection of Balances - I don't want that association to be reverse navigable. But without the .WithMany in the mapping I don't get the option to specify .HasForeignKey. Is there another way? (N.B. I know I could also do this using attributes, but I want to use the fluent API mapping).

@LINK:/questions/17898282/searchview-taking-all-the-space-in-the-new-actionbarcompat
@TITLE:SearchView taking all the space in the new ActionBarCompat
@CONTENT:I switched from ActionBarSherlock to ActionBarCompat (support library v7). After some adjustments, almost everything is working fine by now. But I'm in trouble with the SearchView in the ActionBar. When it's expanded (actually, It's always expanded in my Activity), it takes up all the space and doesn't respect the space of other Action Items that are set to show always (showAsAction="always"). To simulate the problem, use this: <menu xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
      xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto">

    <item
        android:id="@+id/menu_buscar"
        app:actionViewClass="android.support.v7.widget.SearchView"
        android:icon="@drawable/abc_ic_search"
        app:showAsAction="always"
        android:title="@string/buscar"/>

    <item android:id="@+id/tentar_novamente"
          android:title="@string/tentar_novamente"
          android:icon="@drawable/acao_tentar_novamente"
          app:showAsAction="always" />

</menu>
 In the Activity: @Override
public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu) {
    getMenuInflater().inflate(R.menu.busca_action_menu, menu);

    searchMenuItem = menu.findItem(R.id.menu_buscar);
    searchView = (SearchView) MenuItemCompat.getActionView(searchMenuItem);

    searchView.setIconifiedByDefault(false);
    searchView.setQueryHint(stringBusqueArtistasMusicasEAlbuns);

    return super.onCreateOptionsMenu(menu);
}
 This is the result in the android 4.3: And this is the result in the android 2.3 (the action items doesn't even appear): The same problem happens when I use: setSupportProgressBarIndeterminateVisibility(true);
 The progress indicator appears very strange in the Android 4.3 and doesn't appear in Android 2.3. The same code worked as expected with ActionBarSherlock. When there was some action item, the SearchView used to decrease its width to give space for the action items. UPDATE: I've posted an issue in the Android's Bug Tracker: https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=58251&thanks=58251&ts=1375191632 If you have the same problem, please follow the issue. UPDATE: I've tried to put the action items before the SearchView and this way they items appear. But, the setSupportProgressBarIndeterminateVisibility(true) is still not showing the progress bar.
@CODE:<menu xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
      xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto">

 If you visit http://rourkery.com in Chrome, you should see the problem on the main text area. It didn't used to do this and it doesn't seem to effect other webkit browsers (like Safari). There were some other posts about people experiencing a similar issue with 3d transforms, but can't find anything about 2d transforms like this. Any ideas would be appreciated, thanks!

@TITLE:How to use onAppWidgetOptionsChanged() in a widget?
@CONTENT:I would like to update my widget every time it gets resized. I figured out that this is done in: onAppWidgetOptionsChanged(Context context, AppWidgetManager appWidgetManager, int appWidgetId, Bundle newOptions) But I can't find out how to update the widget in it. I tried to redraw the widget by calling everything that I put in onUpdate(), but it's not working. How can I make use of the bundle?

@TITLE:Android CalendarView slowing down layout
@CONTENT:This is driving me crazy. I have a fragment in my Android app which is laid out using a RelativeLayout. Problem is that for some reason it takes ages to render, about 5 seconds just to load about 4 elements on screen. One of the elements is a CalendarView and when I remove it it goes back to proper speeds (ie: instant). I'd imagine the problem is got to do with the way I'm asking Android to lay it out, must not make much sense or is inefficient or something. Here's the XML file: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<RelativeLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
android:layout_width="match_parent"
android:layout_height="match_parent"

     android:layout_alignParentLeft="true"

    android:layout_height="wrap_content"

    android:textAppearance="?android:attr/textAppearanceMedium"

@CONTENT:I created MVC Application that have 3 different Area. (Admin, User, News) This is my RouteConfig.cs File in App_Start directory: public class RouteConfig
{
    public static void RegisterRoutes(RouteCollection routes)
    {
        routes.IgnoreRoute("{resource}.axd/{*pathInfo}");

        routes.MapRoute(

            defaults: new { controller = "Home", action = "Index", id = UrlParameter.Optional },
            namespaces: new[] { "TestMvcApplication.Controllers" }
        );
    }
}
 And This is my AdminAreaRegisteration.cs file:     namespace TestMvcApplication.Areas.Admin
{
    public class AdminAreaRegistration : AreaRegistration
    {
        public override string AreaName
        {

@TITLE:rake db:migrate is not working
@CONTENT:I'm working through the rails tutorial and have gotten stuck. Starting at Listing 8.16 I have made the following modifications to <timestamp>_add_remember_token_to_users.rb: class AddRememberTokenToUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    add_column :users, :remember_token, :string
    add_index  :users, :remember_token
  end
end
 The guide then says to update dev & test db as usual: $ bundle exec rake db:migrate
$ bundle exec rake db:test:prepare
 My User test for the *remember_token* is still failing so I took a look at the user table in dev and tests database with command line sqlite3. They look like this: sqlite> .schema users
CREATE TABLE "users" (
   "id" INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL, 
   "name" varchar(255),

   "created_at" datetime NOT NULL, 
   "updated_at" datetime NOT NULL, 
   "password_digest" varchar(255));
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "index_users_on_email" ON "users" ("email");
 It seems like my migration has not been run yet but I do not know how to force it to run.

@LINK:/questions/9896011/any-reason-not-to-trust-asp-net-antiforgerytoken
@TITLE:Any reason not to trust ASP.NET AntiForgeryToken?
@CONTENT:I know that Stack Exchange sites do not use the ASP.NET MVC built-in @Html.AntiForgeryToken() for the prevention of XSRF/CSRF attacks. Instead of creating a hidden input named __RequestVerificationToken with a really long value based on the machineKey section of the web.config, the Stack Exchange method creates an input named fkey with a MUCH more succinct value. This is apparently a Guid, and based on evidence from the Stack Exchange Data Explorer project on Google Code, this value is tied to each individual user, remaining fairly constant until you log in or out. Also, the Stack Exchange value is constant on a page, and is made available to client script, so that Ajax posts for voting and things like that also use the token. By contrast So why does Stack Exchange march to its own drummer? Is there a reason not to trust AntiForgeryToken? Does the AntiForgeryToken have some limitations that the Stack Exchange team was unwilling to accept? If so what were they? Or maybe AntiForgeryToken just wasn't around (it started life in the MVC Futures project) when Stack Overflow was started, and if they had it to do over from scratch today they would use AntiForgeryToken? I've been unable to find any blog posts from Jeff or others on the Stack Exchange team to explain the guiding principles behind how the XSRF-prevention policy on the SE network. It would be really nice if one of them could do a write-up, assuming of course that it could be done in general terms without creating a vulnerability. It would be really valuable information for those of us that want to make our websites secure, but aren't entirely comfortable just blindly trusting Microsoft to do it for us.

@LINK:/questions/9626777/how-to-have-assetic-sass-work-with-symfony2-in-windows
@TITLE:How to have Assetic + sass work with Symfony2 in Windows?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to get Assetic to run within Symfony 2.0.11 in order to use sass for css files. I've been fiddling around that issue for hours, and from what I gather the current assetic version (1.0.2) is screwed up and just can't work in windows. I tried updating assetic and asseticBundle to the latest Master version from github, but those require Symfony 2.1 which brings in a lot of changes and is not backward compatible (not to mention it's not officially released either), so that's not an option. This post symfony2 assetics yui compressor on windows (path syntax) gives some good insight on the matter, but unfortunately the changes on the assetic lib it recommends aren't enough to make it work properly in my environment. I found some interesting bits also in https://github.com/kriswallsmith/assetic/commit/5621cd449b0d85316e5872d672e7e900edc2246c and https://github.com/kriswallsmith/assetic/issues/25 In the end, what I know is that I need to alter vendor/assetic/src/Assetic/Util/ProcessBuilder.php, maybe some other files in the package, and perhaps add some informations in my config.yml file (it seems adding the path to java or sass might help). What I need is for someone who was able to get a working configuration to give me pointers onto what I'm missing, or ideally the steps required to have that damn thing work. Anyone up to the task ? ___Update: Still digging, it's only been 3 days now :/ New elements : 1/ php5.3.8 may have an issue with proc_open and data > 2048 bytes as per https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=60120 This issue can have implications when getting symfony from the git repository ( https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/3216 ). issuing "git config --global core.autocrlf input" and re-fetching everything from git allowed me to use php5.3.10 without crash. 2/ https://github.com/kriswallsmith/assetic/commit/5621cd449b0d85316e5872d672e7e900edc2246c looks like a decent basis. I've maded some minor modifications on the paths in Process.php (cf https://github.com/kriswallsmith/assetic/issues/92 ) but I'm not really sure that is relevant. Anyhow, the command line I get from Assetic at this point works in a shell and outputs the expected css. 3/ sass.bat (located in Ruby193\bin) needs to have absolute path to ruby.exe in order to go a bit further (I learnt that the hard way, you only see the error message if you var_dump and kill the script at the right place!) Now, things seem a bit better, but still not working with sass (I think it'd work fine with some other filters) I managed to isolate the issue in Process.php (around line 172) at "$data = fread($pipe, 8192);" : The second time the script passes at this place, with $pipe pointing to the second resource, it never returns... and php gets stuck and has really hard times coming out (I need to kill/restart wamp at least two times to be able to make another test) I'm really not familiar with proc_open and streams, and I have difficulties understanding what the code is trying to do in there... I hope this can help the next one trying to have things work, and eventually help my case too. Still looking for some support on the matter! ___Update: Further testing made me realize that I could have "php app/console assetic:dump" work when the sass file was small enough. It seems to me that the actual css rules (excluding variable definitions and mixins) need to me smaller than 4096 bytes with php5.3.10, even less with php 5.3.8. That is pointing to the proc_open bug described in https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=60120 and https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=51800 ___Update: I tried to install php5.4 to check if it was fixing the issue. It took me some time to realize the reason this version was not working on my computer is because there is no x64 build yet. I then installed the 32bits version of wamp, and got php5.4 working with it easily. End result : proc_open still hangs :( I'm beginning to be out of ideas here... Walkthrough: So, eventually I got this to work, and thought I'd try to sum the most important steps up for later viewers : 1. Have Ruby 1.9.3 and compass 0.12 installed check http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/ Update compass to 0.12 with "gem update --system"
 and then "gem install compass"
 2. Alter compiler.rb in compass Go to Ruby193\lib\ruby\gems\1.9.1\gems\compass-0.12.0\lib\compass in line 10, replace self.from, self.to = File.expand_path(from), to
 with self.from, self.to = from.gsub('./', ''), to
 /!\ with some setup, it may be the other way around, but with the setup I'm trying to describe, it goes this way. 3. point Assetic to the latest version that works with symfony 2.0.11 edit the deps file like such : [assetic]
    git=http://github.com/kriswallsmith/assetic.git
    ;version=v1.0.2
    version=ac71449e46bed22c276da26bf54ab2f733b3801d
[AsseticBundle]
    git=http://github.com/symfony/AsseticBundle.git
    target=/bundles/Symfony/Bundle/AsseticBundle
    ;version=v1.0.1
    version=da4a46ce37557dcf3068b8493b12bdbbe47455e2
 /!\ you'll need to remove the references to a specific version in the deps.lock file too ! and issue a "php bin/vendors install". 4. Change your config.yml here's what mine looks like now : # Assetic Configuration
assetic:
    debug:          %kernel.debug%
    use_controller: false
    # java: /usr/bin/java
    filters:
        compass:
            bin: e:\outils\Ruby193\bin\compass.bat
 5. Use absolute path in compass.bat/sass.bat Go to your Ruby193\bin directory and edit compass.bat to set an absolute path to ruby.exe (do the same with sass.bat while you're at it) 6. Change the call in template Here's what mine looks like now : {% stylesheets filter='compass' output='css/*.css'
        '@LndBimBundle/Resources/public/css/main.scss'
    %}
        <link href="{{ asset_url }}" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" />
    {% endstylesheets %}
 Testing : For testing, you can use php app/console assetic:dump --verbose --no-debug
 That way if you get into an endless loop as I did, you can just ctrl+C, which makes testing way more efficient than in a browser /!\ You absolutely need to use --no-debug, or you'll end up with a bunch of unwanted lines in your css that look like : @media -sass-debug-info{filename{font-family:file\:\/\/C\:\/Users\/Mattso\/AppData\/Local\/Temp\/ass9DBF\.tmp\.scss}line{font-family:\0000359}}
 You can use die($this->commandline);
 in the run method of vendor\assetic\src\Assetic\Util\Process.php
 to show you the current command line, and test it. Mine currently looks like this : cmd /V:ON /E:ON /C ""e:\outils\Ruby193\bin\compass.bat" "compile" "C:\Users\Mattso\AppData\Local\Temp" "--config" "C:\Users\Mattso\AppData\Local\Temp\ass59BB.tmp" "--sass-dir" "" "--css-dir" "" "C:\Users\Mattso\AppData\Local\Temp\ass59BC.tmp.scss""
 Then you just need to type "php app/console assetic:dump --no-debug" in your cli to create the css files in web\css and refresh your site's page. Et... voila! (hopefully!) Note: As you may have noticed, I'm using the CompassFilter instead of the SassFilter. That is because it does the same thing (and more) and can actually be made to do what we expect of it. If anyone can find out how to fix the SassFilter, that would be swell. Meanwhile I already spent way too much time on this. I've been pulling my hair for days on that crazyness, I hope this post will be helpful to some other people's mental health ;)

@QREC:9009627
@LINK:/questions/9009627/immutable-or-not-immutable
@TITLE:Immutable or not immutable?
@CONTENT:Ok, as I understand it, immutable types are inherently thread safe or so I've read in various places and I think I understand why it is so. If the inner state of an instance can not be modified once the object is created there seems to be no problems with concurrent access to the instance itself. Therefore, I could create the following List: class ImmutableList<T>: IEnumerable<T>
{
    readonly List<T> innerList;

    public ImmutableList(IEnumerable<T> collection)
    {
         this.innerList = new List<T>(collection);
    }

    public ImmutableList()
    {
         this.innerList = new List<T>();
    }

    public ImmutableList<T> Add(T item)
    {
         var list = new ImmutableList<T>(this.innerList);
         list.innerList.Add(item);
         return list;
    }

    public ImmutableList<T> Remove(T item)
    {
         var list = new ImmutableList<T>(this.innerList);
         list.innerList.Remove(item);
         return list;
    } //and so on with relevant List methods...

    public T this[int index]
    {
        get
        {
            return this.innerList[index];
        }
    }

    public IEnumerator<T> GetEnumerator()
    {
        return innerList.GetEnumerator();
    }

    System.Collections.IEnumerator System.Collections.IEnumerable.GetEnumerator()
    {
        return ((System.Collections.IEnumerable)this.innerList).GetEnumerator();
    }
}
 So the question is: Is this really an immutable type? Is it really thread safe? Obviously the type itself is immutable but there is absolutely no garantee that T is and therefore you could have concurrent access and threading issues related directly with the generic type. Would that mean that ImmutableList should be considered mutable?. Should class ImmutableList<T>: IEnumerable<T> where T: struct be the only type truly considered immutable? Thanks for any input on this issue. UPDATE: A lot of answers/comments are concentrating on the particular implementation of ImmutableList I've posted which is probably not a very good example. But the issue of the question is not the implementation. The question I'm asking is if ImmutableList<MutableT> is really an immutable type considering everything that an immutable type entails.
@CODE:List class ImmutableList<T>: IEnumerable<T>
{
    readonly List<T> innerList;

    public ImmutableList(IEnumerable<T> collection)
    {
         this.innerList = new List<T>(collection);
    }

    public ImmutableList()
    {
         this.innerList = new List<T>();
    }

    public ImmutableList<T> Add(T item)
    {
         var list = new ImmutableList<T>(this.innerList);
         list.innerList.Add(item);
         return list;
    }

    public ImmutableList<T> Remove(T item)
    {
         var list = new ImmutableList<T>(this.innerList);
         list.innerList.Remove(item);
         return list;
    } //and so on with relevant List methods...

    public T this[int index]
    {
        get
        {
            return this.innerList[index];
        }
    }

    public IEnumerator<T> GetEnumerator()
    {
        return innerList.GetEnumerator();
    }

    System.Collections.IEnumerator System.Collections.IEnumerable.GetEnumerator()

        return ((System.Collections.IEnumerable)this.innerList).GetEnumerator();

@LINK:/questions/8629640/symfony2-doctrine2-is-not-caching-results-of-joined-entities
@TITLE:Symfony2 + Doctrine2 is not caching results of joined entities
@CONTENT:I am using Symfony 2.0.10 with Doctrine 2.1 and have rather simple query (see below), where I want to cache results with APC (version 3.1.7, enabled 1GB of memory for it) via useResultCache(true, 600) and keep hydration mode as \Doctrine\ORM\Query::HYDRATE_OBJECT. The problem is that Many-to-Many relations (Doctrine\ORM\PersistentCollection) don't get cached and every time when main query results are cached the joined entities are set to null. The same query is cached well in APC when I set hydration mode to \Doctrine\ORM\Query::HYDRATE_ARRAY, but it is not acceptable solution for me, because I can't redo many templates for this to work. Please suggest how can I cache all joined entities' properties in APC? Please don't point to documentation, because I think I have learned it by heart trying to solve this issue :) CODE: $property = $em
->createQueryBuilder()
->select('p,u')
->from('MyBundle:Property', 'p')
->leftJoin('p.users', 'u')
->where('p.id in (:id)')
->setParameter('id', 123)
->getQuery()
->useResultCache(true, 60)
->setHydrationMode(\Doctrine\ORM\Query::HYDRATE_OBJECT)
->getResult();
 User.php class User {
    /**

@TITLE:Which is faster: Automapper, Valuinjector, or manual mapping? To what degree is each one faster? [closed]
@CONTENT:Suppose I have this object in my DAL (ORM etc) public class Student
{
   public string Name {get;set;}
   public string Address {get;set;}
   public string Phone {get;set;}
   public Parent Parent {get;set;}
}
public class Parent
{
   public string Name {get;set;}
   public string Address {get;set;}
   public string Phone {get;set;}
}
 And I have a ViewModel that looks like this public class StudentDetailVM
{
   public string Name {get;set;}
   public string Address {get;set;}
   public string Phone {get;set;}

   public string ParentName {get;set;}
   public string ParentPhone {get;set;}
}
 In that case I need to flatten the objects. I can do this with a tool like Automapper, ValueInjector, or I could do it manually. This is tedious work if there are many such classes to handle, but there appears to be a performance / developer efficiency tradeoff between all three approaches. I'm looking for guidance on when to use Automapper vs Valueinjector vs a manual mapping. I'm sure manual mapping is the fastest one, but by how much? Are some scenarios much slower/faster than others (e.g. flattening, etc)? Would it make sense to do a hybrid approach to mapping objects between layers? The reason I ask is because a Codeplex project called emitmapper was created to address performance issues in automapper, and I remember seeing a comment that said automapper may take up to .5ms to map a large class. (reference needed) I also remember seeing an article that describes how users have a higher chance of staying on your site if it loads within 70ms, as opposed to 90ms or more. (I'm looking for this link too). If automapper is consuming most of my page-load time, combined with network latency, then I see potential to not use automapper and create manual classes for my high volume pages and stick with a hybrid approach. Bottom line: I would run the tests myself, but I don't know enough about .NET internals to create accurate results that can be used as a reusable guideline.
@CODE:public class Student
{
   public string Name {get;set;}
   public string Address {get;set;}
   public string Phone {get;set;}
   public Parent Parent {get;set;}
}
public class Parent
{
   public string Name {get;set;}
   public string Address {get;set;}
   public string Phone {get;set;}
} public class StudentDetailVM
{
   public string Name {get;set;}
   public string Address {get;set;}
   public string Phone {get;set;}

   public string ParentName {get;set;}
   public string ParentPhone {get;set;}
}

@TITLE:Temporarily Disabling Django Caching
@CONTENT:How do you disable Django caching on a per checkout basis? Back before Django 1.3, I could disable caching for my local development checkout by specifying CACHE_BACKEND = None, in a settings_local.py imported by settings.py. The settings_local.py was ignored by SVN, so I could always ensure my local environment didn't cache, while not have to worry about modifying the cache params in settings.py. Now, with Django 1.3, and the new CACHES = {...} structure, setting CACHES = None or CACHES['default']['BACKEND'] = None causes Django to choke, and setting CACHES = {} still seems to enable basic caching.

 The memory referenced by the ArrayList is eligible for garbage collection in each iteration of the while loop, and internally JVM calls garbage collection (System.gc()) before throwing an OutOfMemory Error because of heap space. So why is the exception occurring?

Source video fragments are stored in server formatted in H.264 and with MPEG2(.ts) container. Is there a way to play these video in Flash platform? These are my current investigations. As I know, Adobe offers their own streaming format F4F, anyway we already decided not to go for it. There is OSMF framework and an implementation. http://code.google.com/p/apple-http-osmf/ Option #2 looks good. But I have no idea about how can I use it. How can I use this? What's OSMF? Is it possible to run in standard Flash Player for web browsers? And is it work smoothly like in iOS? (smoothly means no struggling) If you have used this OSMF stuff for this purpose, please let me know! P.S. I'm finding client-side method primarily. We prefer progressive download if this is impossible in Flash Player.

I try some booleans, but no chance.

@TITLE:The type arguments cannot be inferred from the usage. Try specifying the type arguments explicitly
@CONTENT:Could someone please clarify something for me. In my ASP.NET MVC 2 app, I've got a BaseViewModel class which includes the following method: public virtual IDictionary<string, object> GetHtmlAttributes<TModel, TProperty>
                        (Expression<Func<TModel, TProperty>> propertyExpression)
{
    return new Dictionary<string, object>();
}
 The idea being that each child viewmodel can override this method and provide a suitable set of html attributes, based on some logic, to be rendered in the view: <%: Html.TextBoxFor(model => model.MyProperty, Model.GetHtmlAttributes
                                                 (model => model.MyProperty)) %>
 However when used as in the line above, I get a compilation error when I hit the view: The type arguments for method '...BaseViewModel.GetHtmlAttributes<TModel,TProperty> Expression<System.Func<TModel,TProperty>)' cannot be inferred from the usage. Try specifying the type arguments explicitly. I have to do the following: <%: Html.TextBoxFor(model => model.MyProperty, Model.GetHtmlAttributes
                             <ChildModel, string>(model => model.MyProperty)) %>
 I'm just looking for some clarity as to how it tries to infer the type, it has no problem doing so in the HtmlHelper/TextBoxFor extension method? Is it because HtmlHelper in the view will automatically be for the same type as is specified in the ViewUserControl at the top of the page, whereas my code can be for any type inheriting from BaseViewModel? Is is possible to write this in such a way that it can infer my model/property types?
@CODE:BaseViewModel public virtual IDictionary<string, object> GetHtmlAttributes<TModel, TProperty>
                        (Expression<Func<TModel, TProperty>> propertyExpression)

@TITLE:Turning tracing off via app.config
@CONTENT:I'm trying to use System.Diagnostics to do some very basic logging. I figure I'd use what's in the box rather than taking on an extra dependency like Log4Net or EntLib. I'm all set up, tracing is working wonderfully. Code snippet: Trace.TraceInformation("Hello World")
 App.config: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<configuration>
  <system.diagnostics>
    <trace autoflush="true" indentsize="4">
      <listeners>
        <add name="TraceListener" type="System.Diagnostics.TextWriterTraceListener" initializeData="Trace.log" traceOutputOptions="DateTime" />
        <remove name="Default" />
      </listeners>
    </trace>
  </system.diagnostics>
</configuration>
 and my little "Hello World" shows nicely up in my Trace.log file. But now I'd like to switch OFF tracing, so I dig into MSDN and find How to: Configure Trace Switches . I add the <switches> element, and now my app.config looks like this: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<configuration>
  <system.diagnostics>
    <trace autoflush="true" indentsize="4">
      <listeners>
        <add name="TraceListener" type="System.Diagnostics.TextWriterTraceListener" initializeData="Trace.log" traceOutputOptions="DateTime" />
        <remove name="Default" />
      </listeners>
    </trace>
    <switches>
      <add name="Data" value="0" />
    </switches>
  </system.diagnostics>
</configuration>
 The value="0" should turn off tracing - at least if you then follow How to: Create and Initialize Trace Switches, which tells you to add this line of code: Dim dataSwitch As New BooleanSwitch("Data", "DataAccess module")
 That doesn't make sense to me: I just have to declare an instance of the BooleanSwicth to be able to manage (disable) tracing via the .config file? Should I like ... use ... the object somewhere? Anyways, I'm sure I missed something really obvious somewhere. Please help. How do I switch OFF tracing in app.config?

@CONTENT:for tracking purposes, I want that the URL, which appears on the facebook stream after an "like-action", is slightly different from the URL the user actually liked. Example: I use <link rel="canonical" href="http://example.com/test.html"> in my head section to tell facebook to which URL a like-action on this website refers to. Further down on the website I have <fb:like href="http://example.com/test.html?param=144141"> with the same URL, just with an additional parameter. My intention: If someone clicks on the like button, facebook puts him to the "group who like http://example.com/test.html" in order to appear next the like button. But when another user sees his like-action on the facebook stream and clicks on it, he should be redirected to http://example.com/test.html?param=144141. The problem is that this doesn't work, because the canonical declaration in the head section kind of overwrites the href attribute of my <fb:like> tag. Anyone knows how to solve this problem or does it simply not work?

@CONTENT:Given a phone keypad as shown below: 1 2 3

 How many different 10-digit numbers can be formed starting from 1? The constraint is that the movement from 1 digit to the next is similar to the movement of the Knight in a chess game. For eg. if we are at 1 then the next digit can be either 6 or 8 if we are at 6 then the next digit can be 1, 7 or 0. Repetition of digits are allowed - 1616161616 is a valid number. Is there a polynomial time algorithm which solves this problem? The problem requires us to just give the count of 10-digit numbers and not necessarily list the numbers. EDIT: I tried modeling this as a graph with each digit having 2 or 3 digits as its neighbors. Then I used DFS to navigate upto the depth of 10 nodes and then increment the count of numbers each time I reached the depth of 10. This obviously is not polynomial time. Assuming each digit had just 2 neighbors, this would have required at least 2^10 iterations. The variable here is the number of digits. I have taken the eg. of 10 digit numbers. It could as well be n-digits.

I use python as a part of a software package, and the python runs behind the curtain without the user's notice of it. What I did was as follows. Copy python.exe, python26.dll, msvcr90.dll and Microsoft.VC90.CRT.manifest zip all the directory in LIBs directory as the python26.zip copy all the necessary dll/pyd file inside the DLL directory. It seems to work, but when I change the python26.zip to the other name such as pythonlib.zip. It cannot find the python library anymore. Q1 : What's the magic behind the python26.zip name? The python automatically finds a library inside a python26.zip but not with different name? Q2 : If I have python26.zip at the same directory where python.exe/python26.dll is, I don't need to add path sys.path.append(THE PATH TO python26.zip). Is it correct? Added Python has built in library, and sys is one of them. I thought that I could use sys.path to point to whatever python library in zip file I needed. But, surprisingly, if I use the lib name as Python26.zip, it just worked. I wanted to ask why is this so.

This does not work and I am wondering if this is due to the fact that the userLocation field is read only. Use the [MKMapView showUserLocation:YES], create a MKMapViewDelegate and add the tracking when the annotation view for the user location is requested. This does not work, because the annotation view is apparently requested only once??? Use a CLLocationManager and try to add the blue pin manually. Unfortunately, I did not find the blue pin in the available pin types, so I tried to create a user annotation manually without success. Does anyone has any idea how I can achieve this and still benefit from the blue pin or is my only solution to use a CLLocationManager and create my own pin?

@CONTENT:We are looking at using Cassandra to store a stream of information coming from various sources. One issue we are facing is the best way to query between two dates. For example we will need to retrieve an object between datetime dt1 and datetime dt2. We are currently considering the created unix timestamp as the key pointing to the actual object then using get_key_range to query to retrieve? Obviously this wouldn't work if two items have the same timestamp. Is this the best way to do datetime in noSQL stores in general?

@TITLE:How to have multiple instances of jQuery plugin on single page?
@CONTENT:I'm writing a simple jQuery plugin, but I'm having trouble being able to use multiple instances on a page. For instance, here is a sample plugin to illustrate my point: (function($) {
  $.fn.samplePlugin = function(options) {
    if (typeof foo != 'undefined')
    {
      alert('Already defined!');
    } else {
      var foo = 'bar';
    }
  };
})(jQuery);
 And then if I do this: $(document).ready(function(){
  $('#myDiv').samplePlugin({}); // does nothing
  $('#myDiv2').samplePlugion({}); // alerts "Already defined!"
});
 This is obviously an over-simplified example to get across the point. So my question is, how do I have two separate instances of the plugin? I'd like to be able to use it across multiple instances on the same page. I'm guessing that part of the problem might be with defining the variables in a global scope. How can I define them unique to that instance of the plugin then? Thank you for your guidance!

  $.fn.samplePlugin = function(options) {
    if (typeof foo != 'undefined')

@TITLE:Custom Exceptions in C++
@CONTENT:I've been trying to make some custom exception classes for a C++ library I'm working on. These custom exceptions capture extra info, such as file,line number,etc, needed for debugging, if for some reason while testing an exception is not caught in the right place. However most people seem to recommend inheriting from the std::exception class in the STL, which I agree with, but I was wondering maybe it would be better to use multiple inheritance to inherit from each of the derived std::exception classes (eg. std::runtime_error) and a custom exception class, as in the code below? Another thing, how does one go about copy constructors and assignment operators in exception classes? Should they be disabled? class Exception{

@TITLE:How to disable address space randomization for a binary on Linux?
@CONTENT:I'm working on a runtime system for parallel programs that can take advantage of a common address space layout across multiple processes, potentially spread over several (thousand) nodes. Many times, software built for this environment is run on Linux systems that have address space randomization enabled by default, and users may not want or be able to disable it system-wide (via sysctl -w kernel.randomize_va_space=0 and the like). This imposes some limitations on the parallel programs, and can hurt performance. Thus, we want to figure out how to disable it for the binaries that we build. Security is not an issue, as this software is always running in controlled environments. I've found references to various flags and variables, like ET_EXEC, EF_AS_NO_RANDOM (apparently never merged?) and PF_RANDOMIZE, but I can't find any document that describes what I can do to set these flags. An ideal answer would tell me what compiler/assembler/linker flag will disable randomization for the resulting binary, and what versions of the tool-chain/kernel this works on. Next best would be a tool that does the same after a binary is built. Since I'm sure someone will suggest it, I'm already aware that we can make this change at runtime with setarch -R, but it's preferable to record this in the executable. It looks like paxctl -rx ought to do the trick, but it doesn't seem to apply to the current method used in kernels that don't include the PaX patches.

@CONTENT:I am using Xcode 3.2 on 10.6, with the shipped version of gcov and default GCC compiler (both version 4.2.1). I have created a dependent Cocoa unit test bundle which is injected into my app, and followed Apple's documentation on setting up a gcov-instrumented build configuration - based on the Debug configuration which doesn't have any compiler optimisations enabled. When I build the test bundle with this 'Gcov-instrumented' configuration, the app launches and the tests are injected and run. Also the coverage statistics files are generated at: build/<AppTarget>.build/Gcov-instrumented/<AppTarget>.build/Objects-normal/x86_64/<object>.gcda build/<AppTarget>.build/Gcov-instrumented/<AppTarget>.build/Objects-normal/x86_64/<object>.gcno So far so good. I know the tests are really being run because if I insert failures then the test suite fails as expected. Unfortunately, gcov reports that no lines of the objects have been covered by the tests! Every line is reported as 0 coverage. I've searched here and at the Apple mailing list archives, and can't find anyone with a similar problem. I expect I'm missing something - but what is it?

@TITLE:How to create an optimized packing function in python?
@CONTENT:So I have been given the task to create a shipping module for a webshop system. It may be a bit overkill, but I would really like to create one that can figure out how to pack parcels in the most optimized way. Having learned programming simply by doing it, this is an area where I have no knowledge - yet! Anyways I can just give short description of the actual problem. So when users by stuff at webshops they will have x products in their cart with possibly varying sizes and weight. So I want to give that list of products to the function and let it figure out how these products should be packed in parcel(s). max length of parcel: 100 max width of parcel: 50 max height of parcel: 50 max weight of parcel: 20 Every product has a weight, length, width and height as well. Since parcels and products is basically boxes, I'm guessing this would be rather complex, as there are different ways of putting the products inside the parcel. My goal is not to make the perfect packaging function, but I would like to do something better than just putting products inside the parcel until a limit has been reached. Now, I don't expect you guys to make this for me, but what I would like to ask is three things. Where can I find good online resources that will teach me the basics needed? Are there some native python tools that would be good to use? Some pointers of what I need to be aware of, pitfalls etc Like I said, I don't plan for this to be perfect and 100% optimized, but I would like to end up with something that will come close. I would hate if users feel that the sending fee will be a lot higher than it actual is.

(Before hitting tab, Or moving the mouse) I have a database query that occurs on the textchanged event and everything works perfectly. However, I noticed that there is a bit of lag of course because if a user is quickly typing into the textbox the program is busy doing a query for each character. So what I was hoping for was a way to see if the user has finished typing. So if they type "a" and stop then an event fires. However, if they type "all the way" the event fires after the y keyup. I have some ideas floating around my head but I'm sure they aren't the most efficient. Like measuring the time since the last textchange event and if it was > than a certain value then it would proceed to run the rest of my procedures. let me know what you think.

@CONTENT:The problem that I am having has to do with the need to keep some urls of a website protected by HTTPS and the rest kicked to HTTP. Normally, you have $_SERVER['HTTP_HTTPS'] or $_SERVER['HTTPS'] (depending on your flavor of Apache). You also can check the port - it's 80 for normal traffic and 443 for HTTPS. My problem is that the certificate sits on the loadbalancer, and all these variables are unavailable, and the webserver sees http://www.foo.com on port 80. One way to fix this is to tell the loadbalancer to send the traffic on a different port, but I wonder if there are other ways to detect HTTPS coming from the load balancer?

@CONTENT:On Mac OS X, you can create a zip archive from the Finder by selecting some files and selecting "Compress" from the contextual menu or the File menu. Unfortunately, the resulting file is not identical to the archive created by the zip command (with the default options). This distinction matters to at least one service operated by Apple, which fails to accept archives created with the zip command. Having to create archives manually is preventing me from fully automating my release build process. How can I create a zip archive in the correct format within a shell script? EDIT: Since writing this question long ago, I've figured out that the key difference between ditto and zip is how they handle symbolic links: because the code signature inside an app bundle contains a symlink, it needs to be preserved as a link and not stored as a regular file. ditto does this by default, but zip does not (option -y is required).

@LINK:/questions/26147491/whats-the-correct-enable-if-constraint-on-perfect-forwarding-setter
@TITLE:What's the correct `enable_if` constraint on perfect forwarding setter?
@CONTENT:Herb Sutter's Back to the Basics! Essentials of Modern C++ presentation at CppCon discussed different options for passing parameters and compared their performance vs. ease of writing/teaching. The 'advanced' option (providing the best performance in all the cases tested, but too difficult for most developers to write) was perfect forwarding, with the example given (PDF, pg. 28): class employee {
    std::string name_;

public:
    template <class String,
              class = std::enable_if_t<!std::is_same<std::decay_t<String>,
                                                     std::string>::value>>
    void set_name(String &&name) noexcept(
      std::is_nothrow_assignable<std::string &, String>::value) {
        name_ = std::forward<String>(name);
    }
};
 The example uses a template function with forwarding reference, with the template parameter String constrained using enable_if. However the constraint appears to be incorrect: It seems to be saying this method may be used only if the String type is not a std::string, which makes no sense. That would mean that this std::string member can be set using anything but an std::string value. using namespace std::string_literals;

employee e;
e.set_name("Bob"s); // error
 One explanation I considered was that there's a simple typo and the constraint was intended to be std::is_same<std::decay_t<String>, std::string>::value instead of !std::is_same<std::decay_t<String>, std::string>::value. However that would imply that the setter doesn't work with, e.g., const char * and it obviously was intended to work with this type given that that's one of the cases tested in the presentation. It seems to me that the correct constraint is more like: template <class String,
          class = std::enable_if_t<std::is_assignable<decltype((name_)),
                                                      String>::value>>
void set_name(String &&name) noexcept(
  std::is_nothrow_assignable<decltype((name_)), String>::value) {
    name_ = std::forward<String>(name);
}
 allowing anything that can be assigned to the member to be used with the setter. Have I got the right constraint? Are there other improvements that can be made? Is there any explanation for the original constraint, perhaps it was taken out of context? Also I wonder if the complicated, 'unteachable' parts of this declaration are really that beneficial. Since we're not using overloading we can simply rely on normal template instantiation: template <class String>
void set_name(String &&name) noexcept(
  std::is_nothrow_assignable<decltype((name_)), String>::value) {
    name_ = std::forward<String>(name);
}
 And of course there's some debate over whether noexcept really matters, some saying not to worry too much about it except for move/swap primitives: template <class String>
void set_name(String &&name) {
    name_ = std::forward<String>(name);
}
 Maybe with concepts it wouldn't be unreasonably difficult to constrain the template, simply for improved error messages. template <class String>
  requires std::is_assignable<decltype((name_)), String>::value
void set_name(String &&name) {
    name_ = std::forward<String>(name);
}
 This would still have the drawbacks that it can't be virtual and that it must be in a header (though hopefully modules will eventually render that moot), but this seems fairly teachable.

    std::string name_;

public:
    template <class String,

@TITLE:AES-NI intrinsics enabled by default?
@CONTENT:Oracle has this to say about Java 8 with regards to AES-NI: Hardware intrinsics were added to use Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). The UseAES and UseAESIntrinsics flags are available to enable the hardware-based AES intrinsics for Intel hardware. The hardware must be 2010 or newer Westmere hardware. For example, to enable hardware AES, use the following flags: -XX:+UseAES -XX:+UseAESIntrinsics
 To disable hardware AES use the following flags: -XX:-UseAES -XX:-UseAESIntrinsics
 But it does not indicate if AES intrinsics are enabled by default (for processors that support it). So the question is simple: if the processor supports AES-NI, are AES intrinsics used? Bonus question: is there any way to test if AES-NI is being used? I guess you can guess based on performance, but that's not an optimal or sure fire way of testing. For readerS that are not familiar with AES-NI intrinsics: it's replacing byte code with pre-compiled machine code, using the AES-NI instruction set. This happens by the JVM, so it does not show up in the API of the Java runtime or bytecode.

@LINK:/questions/21028438/gradle-sourcecompatibility-has-no-effect-to-subprojects
@TITLE:Gradle sourceCompatibility has no effect to subprojects
@CONTENT:I have Java 6 and 7 installed on my machine. Gradle uses 1.7 (checked using gradle -v). But I need to compile my code to be compatible with Java 1.6. As far as I understand the documentation I can use the sourceCompatibility property to do so (and indirectly the targetCompatibility which defaults to the sourceCompatibility). So I added the following line to my build file (on the root level, not in any closure): sourceCompatibility = 1.6
 (to be sure I also added the targetCompatibility = 1.6 in some trials, but that should not make a difference) To check whether the result was actually compatible with 1.6 I unzipped the resulting jar, cd into the WEB-INF/classes folder and used javap -verbose on the first .class file I encountered. But no matter whether I set the target compatibility or whether I used 1.5 instead of 1.6 or whether I specified it as string ('1.6'), each time the result of javap was minor version: 0
major version: 51
 Afaik this means it is Java 1.7 Bytecode, which is wrong. Any ideas why the sourceCompatibility-setting doesn't work? Or is javap not the correct way to check the compatibility? UPDATE: Yes, this is actually a multi-project build but I only checked one of the subprojects' build results. In this subproject's build file I made the mentioned changes to be sure they are actually applied. In addition, I added the following in the root project's build file (as @Vidya proposed as well): allprojects {
    sourceCompatibility = 1.6
    targetCompatibility = 1.6
}
 But this didn't help either. UPDATE 2: I checked the setting of sourceCompatibility with this snippet in the relevant build.gradle files: compileJava.doFirst {
    println "source compatibility " + sourceCompatibility
}
 It revealed that my sourceCompatibility is set to 1.7 although I tried to set it to 1.6. When I extracted the simplest subproject and built in on its own the sourceCompatibility is set correctly and the Java Byte code is compatible to 1.6. However, even this sub-project uses the wrong sourceCompatibility when used in the multi project build. BTW: The plugins I use in some of the sub projects are: java, war, jetty, gwt UPDATE 3: I changed the built scripts to just use the java plugin (and thus just construct some jars) and removed the usage of the war, jetty and gwt plugin. But still all the projects are set to sourceCompatibility 1.7 despite me setting it in the allprojects section and in some of the sub projects. All that is left now in the build scripts is the declaration of some decencies (maven, files and other sub projects), the declaration of the repositories to use, the declaration of some others tasks (that the build-task does not depend on, so it shouldn't be affected) and the configuration of the manifest file for the created jar files (I add a specification and an implementation version and title to the manifest file). I don't see how any of that would affect the sourceCompatibility setting.
@CODE:gradle -v sourceCompatibility targetCompatibility sourceCompatibility sourceCompatibility = 1.6 targetCompatibility = 1.6 cd WEB-INF/classes javap -verbose .class '1.6' minor version: 0
major version: 51 sourceCompatibility javap allprojects {
    sourceCompatibility = 1.6
    targetCompatibility = 1.6
} compileJava.doFirst {
    println "source compatibility " + sourceCompatibility
} java war jetty gwt war jetty gwt allprojects targetCompatibility sourceCompatibility major version: 50 compileJava.doFirst { println sourceCompatibility } compileJava.sourceCompatibility project.sourceCompatibility tasks.withType(JavaCompile) { sourceCompatibility = "1.6"; targetCompatibility = "1.6" } tasks.withType(JavaCompile) { sourceCompatibility = "1.6"; targetCompatibility = "1.6" } allProjects{}

@CONTENT:I'm using D3 to draw a scatter graph. I would like to show tooltips when the user mouses over each circle. My problem is that I can append tooltips, but they're positioned using the mouse event d3.event.pageX and d3.event.pageY, so they are not positioned consistently over each circle. Instead, some are slightly to the left of the circle, some to the right - it depends on how the user's mouse enters the circle. This is my code: circles
  .on("mouseover", function(d) {         
    tooltip.html(d)  
      .style("left", (d3.event.pageX) + "px")     
      .style("top", (d3.event.pageY - 28) + "px");    
  })                  
  .on("mouseout", function(d) {       
    tooltip.transition().duration(500).style("opacity", 0);   
  });
 And is a JSFiddle showing the problem: http://jsfiddle.net/WLYUY/5/ Is there some way I can use the centre of the circle itself as the position to orient the tooltip, not the mouse position?

 When method2 is not throwing this exception, it works well. What I have tried: Setting @Transactional(noRollbackFor={UserException.class})) on method1 Try and catch in method2 But it didn't change anything. As the exception is thrown in a different transaction where a rollback happened I don't understand why it doesn't work. I had a look at this : Jpa transaction javax.persistence.RollbackException: Transaction marked as rollbackOnly but it didn't really help me. I will be very greatful if someone could give me a clue. Update I've made it work by setting propagation=Propagation.REQUIRES_NEW on the method called by method2 (which is actually the one which is sending the exception). This method is defined in a class very similar to my BatchService. So I don't see why it works on this level and not on method2. I've set method2 as public as the annotation @Transactional is not taken into account if the method is private as said in the documentation : The @Transactional annotation may be placed before an interface definition, a method on an interface, a class definition, or a public method on a class. I also tried to use Exception instead of RuntimeException (as it is more appropriate) but it also didn't change anything. Even if it is working the question remains open as it has a strange behaviour and I would like to understand why it's not acting like it should be.
@CODE:method1 method2 UserException RuntimeException @Transactional
public class BatchService implements IBatchService {
 @Transactional(propagation=Propagation.REQUIRES_NEW)
 public User method2(User user) {
   // Processing, which can throw a RuntimeException
 }

   // ...
   try {
     this.method2(user);
   } catch (UserException e) {
     // ...
   }

@TITLE:How to efficiently calculate a row in pascal's triangle?
@CONTENT:I'm interested in finding the nth row of pascal triangle (not a specific element but the whole row itself). What would be the most efficient way to do it? I thought about the conventional way to construct the triangle by summing up the corresponding elements in the row above which would take: 1 + 2 + .. + n = O(n^2)
 Another way could be using the combination formula of a specific element: c(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)
 for each element in the row which I guess would take more time the the former method depending on the way to calculate the combination. Any ideas?
@CODE:1 + 2 + .. + n = O(n^2) c(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)

@TITLE:How do CursorLoader automatically updates the view even if the app is inactive?
@CONTENT:I have been working on a small To-Do list app. I used CursorLoader to update the ToDolistview from a content provider. I have a written a function onNewItemAdded(), which is called when user enters a new item in the text view and clicks enter. Refer below:  public void onNewItemAdded(String newItem) {
    ContentResolver cr = getContentResolver();

    ContentValues values = new ContentValues();
    values.put(ToDoContentProvider.KEY_TASK, newItem);

    cr.insert(ToDoContentProvider.CONTENT_URI, values);
   // getLoaderManager().restartLoader(0, null, this); // commented for the sake of testing
  }
 @Override
  protected void onResume() {
    super.onResume();
   //getLoaderManager().restartLoader(0, null, this); // commented for the sake of testing
  }

public Loader<Cursor> onCreateLoader(int id, Bundle args) {

    CursorLoader loader = new CursorLoader(this, 
      ToDoContentProvider.CONTENT_URI, null, null, null, null);
    Log.e("GOPAL", "In the onCreateLoader");    
    return loader;
  }

 public void onLoadFinished(Loader<Cursor> loader, Cursor cursor) {

        int keyTaskIndex = cursor.getColumnIndexOrThrow(ToDoContentProvider.KEY_TASK);
        Log.e("GOPAL", "In the onLoadFinished");
        todoItems.clear();
        if(cursor.moveToNext()==false) Log.e("GOPAL", "Empty Cursor");
        else{ 
            while (cursor.moveToNext()) {
              ToDoItem newItem = new ToDoItem(cursor.getString(keyTaskIndex));
              todoItems.add(newItem);
            }
            aa.notifyDataSetChanged(); // aa is arrayadapter used for the listview
        }
      }
 I have read, CursorLoader automatically updates the view, whenever there is a data change in the content provider db. That means I suppose, getLoaderManager().restartLoader(0, null, this) has to be called implicitly whenever there is a change in data, right? But that is not happening. Whenever I add a new item (the item is added to the db from onNewItemAdded, but restartLoader is not explicitly called), pause this activity and resume it back. I don't see any implicit call to restartLoader(even though db is changed) and the listview also is not updated with new item added. Why is that? How does a CursorLoader automatically updates the view even if app is not active??? Thanks :) EDIT: I have also used getContext().getContentResolver().notifyChange(insertedId, null) in insert of my content provider.
@CODE:public void onNewItemAdded(String newItem) {
    ContentResolver cr = getContentResolver();

    ContentValues values = new ContentValues();
    values.put(ToDoContentProvider.KEY_TASK, newItem);

    cr.insert(ToDoContentProvider.CONTENT_URI, values);
   // getLoaderManager().restartLoader(0, null, this); // commented for the sake of testing
  }
 @Override
  protected void onResume() {
    super.onResume();
   //getLoaderManager().restartLoader(0, null, this); // commented for the sake of testing
  }

public Loader<Cursor> onCreateLoader(int id, Bundle args) {

    CursorLoader loader = new CursorLoader(this, 
      ToDoContentProvider.CONTENT_URI, null, null, null, null);
    Log.e("GOPAL", "In the onCreateLoader");    
    return loader;
  }

 public void onLoadFinished(Loader<Cursor> loader, Cursor cursor) {

        int keyTaskIndex = cursor.getColumnIndexOrThrow(ToDoContentProvider.KEY_TASK);
        Log.e("GOPAL", "In the onLoadFinished");
        todoItems.clear();
        if(cursor.moveToNext()==false) Log.e("GOPAL", "Empty Cursor");
        else{ 
            while (cursor.moveToNext()) {
              ToDoItem newItem = new ToDoItem(cursor.getString(keyTaskIndex));
              todoItems.add(newItem);

@TITLE:IO exception error when using serialport.open()
@CONTENT:FINAL UPDATE It was our firmware the whole time. Embarrassing to a degree, but I'm happy we can move forward and I can put learning Java off for another day. My answer is below. UPDATE So I have more or less given up on this. I think it is a bug that goes down to the API but I have neither the time, resources nor skill-set to get to the bottom of it. I think there exists some hardware to whom Windows just gives the middle finger. I have downloaded Eclipse, switched to Java and will try to see if that works. If not, you'll see me back here. However, I would absolutely love to solve this and so if anyone has the time or inclination to dig deep into this one, I'd love to see what you come up with. Obviously I will be checking back here from time to time. Please make sure you '@' me in your comments so I am alerted. ORIGINAL POST I know there are a few other people dealing with this issue, but I was hoping someone could help me. I am trying to connect to a COM Port but I am getting an IO exception when I try to use the serialport.Open() command: System.IO.IOException: The parameter is incorrect.

 I am using a Stellaris LM4F232 to emulate a COM Port. I can open, access and I get good results using Termite (a terminal program) but whenever I try with Visual Studio it won't even connect and I get this error. Now I don't even really know what this error means and I despite trying to read elsewhere I still feel lost. Can anyone explain to me what is happening here and maybe I can begin to try to figure this out? I can include more code, but to be honest there isn't much there; all the properties of the serialport device are as normal, and it is only happening with this device (I can use an MSP430 no problem with the same details). My code is shown below for people who would like to see it (note this is just a 'sandbox', not the actual program but the symptoms are identical):   try
        {
            serialPort1.PortName = "COM5";
            serialPort1.Open();
            if (serialPort1.IsOpen == true)
            {
                textBox1.Text = "CONNECTED";
            }
            else
            {
                textBox1.Text = "NOT CONNECTED";
            }
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            MessageBox.Show("Error: " + ex.ToString(), "ERROR");
        }
 and the other settings are done with the property manager (only difference is baud is set to 230400, all others are on their default). I can open up COM4 with this (an MSP430) which for all intents and purposes is an identical device. I can open COM5 with Termite so I know the connection is good). And no, I am not trying to open them at the same time. If you need more info let me know and I can post more. Thanks! EDIT: I'm on day three of trying to figure this out and still no luck. I don't really understand why I can access this COM through a terminal program and not my own when as near as I can see there is absolutely no difference. Does anyone know of a program that can 'examine' a COM port to see the properties of it (besides windows manager I mean)? I'm getting pretty frustrated and am sort of at a stand still in my project until I figure this out... EDIT2: I've found an apparent workaround, but I've yet to get it to work here. Now I get a few different IO errors, but at least it is motion (not sure if it is progress). I've also learned that this is a .NET bug, which has existed since 2.0. I'd still love any help, but if I figure it out I will report back. Zach's code (the workaround linked above) is shown below: using System;

 EDIT3: Day 6: I'm still plugging away at this. My water rations are low but still I struggle on. I feel help must surely be on the horizon. Whoever finds this journal bring my remains back to Canada and find Nicole. Tell her I love her. But seriously, I have no idea what is causing this problem. I'm wondering if it is purely on the embedded side; maybe because it is USB-to-go, or because the device is capable of being a host also. Has anyone run into that problem? It doesn't explain why I can use Termite (a terminal program, for those viewers just joining us) though. I have been trying to find an open source terminal program that a) works and b) see a). As per usual, I will report back if I discover the issue here as I have now found countless forums where it sounds people have had this issue dating back to 2006. EDIT4: So as per the advice given, I downloaded a port monitoring software app (I got Eltima Serial Port Monitor) and it does look like a baud issue: but strangely no matter what baud I set it still fails. And also can someone explain what the up/down thing means? I tried googling it but the keywords are too general. As usual, I will keep reporting back any changes. Also, for the record, I can connect using Eltima at a baud of 115200 (same as Termite). Unfortunately this does not work in Visual Studio. EDIT5: Our plot takes a surprise twist. I was monitoring what happens when Termite connects to the COM port in question and BLAM! Termite throws the exact same error as my program, but it ignores it. Genius, right? Sloppy, but it works. Now I need to learn how to ignore IOExceptions. I'll report back when I get it figured out. EDIT6: So as it turns out it is a baud rate issue, but it goes deeper. I have been using Eltima Serial Port Monitoring software and it is very intuitive and easy to use. I would recommend it. After some research I have learned that you cannot ignore this exception and still connect to the serial port using .NETs library. So I have to go deeper into the Win32 API and write my own. I have found a few pages that touch on this, but to be honest I have never done anything like this before so it may be a while before I report back but I will definitely figure this out and get back to everyone. There are way too many who suffer from this problem. I have found quite a few forums and websites where I can see the exact same symptoms but nobody has really done much besides say 'Yeah, .NET sucks'. I plan on writing a full static library class and then publish either on my website, here and wherever else I can. Hopefully .NET will take notice (this bug has existed since 2.0). I'll report back when it is done! EDIT7: This is a lot harder than I thought it would be. EDIT8: I don't know if anyone is following this or not but I wanted to say that I am still at it but am out of town for a week on a business trip. I'm still happy to hear suggestions and alternative ideas though!

@TITLE:Keeping a long-term reference to an IOS AddressBook entry
@CONTENT:Given that an ABRecordID can change between cloud syncs and under other circumstances out of my control, how can I maintain a long-term reference to an IOS address book record? Apple provides the following guidance: "The recommended way to keep a long-term reference to a particular record is to store the first and last name, or a hash of the first and last name, in addition to the identifier. When you look up a record by ID, compare the record¡¦s name to your stored name. If they don¡¦t match, use the stored name to find the record, and store the new ID for the record." But I don't understand this guidance. If the address book can have duplicate names in it AND since users can modify the name in a record how could this advice work? For example, if the user modifies the name of an address book record my routine will fail to find it by ABRecordID so if I think search by the name hash I stored couldn't I find a duplicate name instead of the new ABRecordID for that specific record I previously referenced? In the end, what is the BEST way to get a long-term reference to an IOS AddressBook record? And if the above advice really does work what am I missing?

@TITLE:Is it possbile to implement lock free map in C++
@CONTENT:We are developing a network application based C/S, we find there are too many locks adding to std::map that the performance of server became poor. I wonder if it is possible to implement a lock-free map, if yes, how? Is there any open source code there? EDIT: Actually we use the std::map to store sockets information, we did encapsulation based on the socket file description to include some other necessary information such as ip address, port, socket type, tcp or udp, etc. To summary, we have a global map say it's map<int fileDescriptor, socketInfor*> SocketsMap, 
 then every thread which is used to send data needs to access SocketsMap, and they have to add mutex before reading from SocketsMap or writing to SocketsMap, thus the concurrency level of the whole application would be greatly decreased because of so many locks addding to SocketsMap. To avoid the concurrency level problem, we have two solutions: 1. store each socketInfor* separately 2. use some kind of lock-free map. I would like to find some kind of lock-free map, because codes changes required by this solution are much less than that of solution 1.

@TITLE:Intercept the call to an async method using DynamicProxy
@CONTENT:Below is the code from the Intercept method on a custom type that implements IInterceptor of the Castle Dynamic Proxy library. This snippet is from an AOP based logging proof-of-concept console app that is posted here.     public void Intercept(IInvocation invocation)
    {
        if (Log.IsDebugEnabled) Log.Debug(CreateInvocationLogString("Called", invocation));
        try
        {
            invocation.Proceed();
            if (Log.IsDebugEnabled)
                if (invocation.Method.ReturnType != typeof(void))
                    Log.Debug("Returning with: " + invocation.ReturnValue);
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            if (Log.IsErrorEnabled) Log.Error(CreateInvocationLogString("ERROR", invocation), ex);
            throw;
        }
    }
 This is working as expected on regular method calls, but not when tried with async methods (using the async/await keywords from C# 5.0). And I believe, I understand the reasons behind this as well. For the async/await to work, the compiler adds the functional body of the method into a state machine behind the scenes and the control will return to the caller, as soon as the first awaitable expression that cannot be completed synchronously, is encountered. Also, we can interrogate the return type and figure out whether we are dealing with an async method like this:             if (invocation.Method.ReturnType == typeof(Task) || 
                (invocation.Method.ReturnType.IsGenericType && 
                 invocation.Method.ReturnType.GetGenericTypeDefinition() == typeof(Task<>)))
                Log.Info("Asynchronous method found...");
 This works for only those async methods that returns either Task or Task<> and not void but I am fine with that. What changes have to made within the Intercept method so that the awaiter would return to there rather than the original caller?
@CODE:Intercept IInterceptor public void Intercept(IInvocation invocation)
    {
        if (Log.IsDebugEnabled) Log.Debug(CreateInvocationLogString("Called", invocation));
        try

            invocation.Proceed();
            if (Log.IsDebugEnabled)
                if (invocation.Method.ReturnType != typeof(void))
                    Log.Debug("Returning with: " + invocation.ReturnValue);
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            if (Log.IsErrorEnabled) Log.Error(CreateInvocationLogString("ERROR", invocation), ex);
            throw;
        }
    } async async/await async/await awaitable async if (invocation.Method.ReturnType == typeof(Task) ||

Thanks EDIT Here is my implementation so far: My style xml: <style name="Theme.AppTheme" parent="@android:style/Theme.Holo">
    <item name="android:actionBarStyle">@style/MyActionBar</item>
    <item name="android:selectableItemBackground">@android:color/transparent</item>
    <item name="android:windowEnterAnimation">@anim/fadein</item>
    <item name="android:windowExitAnimation">@anim/fadeout</item>        
    <item name="android:actionBarItemBackground">@android:color/transparent</item>
</style>

<style name="MyActionBar" parent="@android:style/Widget.Holo.Light.ActionBar">
    <item name="android:background">@drawable/actionbarheader</item>
    <item name="android:backgroundStacked">@drawable/actionbarheader</item>
    <item name="android:backgroundSplit">@drawable/actionbarheader</item>
    <item name="android:titleTextStyle">@style/ActionBarTitle</item>
    <item name="android:actionBarItemBackground">@android:color/transparent</item>
    <item name="android:actionButtonStyle">@style/MyActionButtonStyle</item>
    <item name="android:homeAsUpIndicator">@drawable/actionbarlogo</item>
    <item name="android:icon">@drawable/app_icon</item>>
</style>

<style name="ActionBarTitle" parent="@android:style/TextAppearance.Holo.Widget.ActionBar.Title">
    <item name="android:textSize">20sp</item>
</style>

<style name="MyActionButtonStyle" parent="@android:style/Widget.Holo.Light.ActionButton">
    <item name="android:background">@android:color/transparent</item>
</style>
 Then I have a drawable for the actionbarogo: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<selector xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
  <item android:drawable="@drawable/actionbarlogo_on" android:state_pressed="true"/>
  <item android:drawable="@drawable/actionbarlogo_on" android:state_focused="true"/>
  <item android:drawable="@drawable/actionbarlogo_off"/>
</selector>
 My menu xml for the action bar items: <menu xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
    <item android:id="@+id/ContactsMode"
        android:icon="@drawable/actionbarcontacts"
        android:title="@string/contacts"
        android:orderInCategory="100"
        android:showAsAction="always"
        android:background="@android:color/transparent" />
</menu>
 and finally, the item's drawable: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<selector xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
  <item android:drawable="@drawable/actionbarcontacts_on" android:state_pressed="true"/>
  <item android:drawable="@drawable/actionbarcontacts_on" android:state_focused="true"/>
  <item android:drawable="@drawable/actionbarcontacts_off"/>
</selector>
 Here is how I create the Menu Items for the ActionBar: public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu) {
        MenuInflater inflater = getMenuInflater();
        inflater.inflate(R.menu.main_menu, menu);
        actionBar.setIcon(R.drawable.actionbarlogo);
        return true;
    }

    public boolean onPrepareOptionsMenu(Menu menu) {        
         MenuItem item= menu.findItem(R.id.ContactsMode);
         if(ContactsButton)
             item.setVisible(true);      
         else
            item.setVisible(false);

         return true;   
    }
@CODE:<style name="Theme.AppTheme" parent="@android:style/Theme.Holo">

    <item name="android:windowExitAnimation">@anim/fadeout</item>        
    <item name="android:actionBarItemBackground">@android:color/transparent</item>

<style name="MyActionBar" parent="@android:style/Widget.Holo.Light.ActionBar">
    <item name="android:background">@drawable/actionbarheader</item>

@TITLE:Allow rotation/landscape in one fragment
@CONTENT:My app has a single Activity with a FragmentPagerAdapter with four fragments (Using the ViewPagerIndicator library). One of these fragments has designs for both a separate portrait and landscape layout, the other three do not and need to be fixed to portrait orientation. My thought was to set android:configChanges="orientation" in the manifest and call getActivity().setRequestedScreenOrientation() in the onResume() of all the fragments, locking to SCREEN_ORIENTATION_PORTRAIT in three of them but to SCREEN_ORIENTATION_UNSPECIFIED in the one that needs to allow rotation, but this doesn't work. The app remains in portrait mode. Is there a way to achieve this? It isn't actually necessary for the actual activity to rotate if there is anyway to allow a fragment to change orientation without its activity doing so, but I have not found anything mentioning this being possible. It would also be equally ok if the activity rotates since the tab bar will be hidden when in landscape orientation.

@TITLE:Web API Model Binding with Multipart formdata
@CONTENT:Is there a way to be able to get model binding (or whatever) to give out the model from a multipart form data request in ASP.NET MVC Web API? I see various blog posts but either things have changed between the post and actual release or they don't show model binding working. This is an outdated post: Sending HTML Form Data and so is this: Asynchronous File Upload using ASP.NET Web API I found this code (and modified a bit) somewhere which reads the values manually: Model: public class TestModel
{
    [Required]
    public byte[] Stream { get; set; }

    [Required]
    public string MimeType { get; set; }
}
 Controller:     public HttpResponseMessage Post()
    {
        if (!Request.Content.IsMimeMultipartContent("form-data"))
        {
            throw new HttpResponseException(HttpStatusCode.UnsupportedMediaType);
        }

        IEnumerable<HttpContent> parts = Request.Content.ReadAsMultipartAsync().Result.Contents;


        string mimeType;
        if (!parts.TryGetFormFieldValue("mimeType", out mimeType))
        {
            return Request.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.BadRequest);
        }

        var media = parts.ToArray()[1].ReadAsByteArrayAsync().Result;

        // create the model here
        var model = new TestModel()
            {
                MimeType = mimeType,
                Stream = media
            };
        // save the model or do something with it
        // repository.Save(model)

        return Request.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.OK);
    }
 Test: [DeploymentItem("test_sound.aac")]
[TestMethod]
public void CanPostMultiPartData()
{
    var content = new MultipartFormDataContent { { new StringContent("audio/aac"),  "mimeType"}, new ByteArrayContent(File.ReadAllBytes("test_sound.aac")) };

    this.controller.Request = new HttpRequestMessage {Content = content};
    var response = this.controller.Post();

    Assert.AreEqual(response.StatusCode, HttpStatusCode.OK);
}
 This code is basically fragile, un-maintainable and further, doesn't enforce the model binding or data annotation constraints. Is there a better way to do this? Update: I've seen this post and this makes me think - do I have to write a new formatter for every single model that I want to support?

            };
        // save the model or do something with it

@TITLE:How to use ServiceStack authentication correctly in ASP.Net MVC controller
@CONTENT:I'm having problem with getting ServiceStack [Authentication] attribute to work in ASP.Net MVC4 controller, pages / action methods with the attribute keep redirecting Users to the login page even after the login details are submitted correctly. I've followed the SocialBootstrapApi example, with the difference being that all the authentication web service calls are made from the controllers: this.CreateRestClient().Post<RegistrationResponse>("/register", model);
 Other things that I've done so far: Use my own user session implementation subclassing AuthUserSession (not too different from the example, but using my own implementation of User table) Inherit ServiceStackController on my BaseController, overriding the default login URL Enable Auth feature in AppHost with my user session implementation Registration does work, user auth logic works (even though the session does not persist), and I can see the ss-id and ss-pid cookies in the request. So my complete list of questions: How do I make the [Authenticate] attribute work (or, what did I do wrong)? How do I save and reuse the user session in an MVC controller? At the moment this.UserSession is always null. How do I logout a user? this.CreateRestClient().Get<AuthResponse>("/auth/logout"); does not seem to work. Update 1: The session cookies (ss-id and ss-pid) gets created when I attempt to load the secured page (ones with [Authenticate] attribute), before any credentials get submitted. Is this the expected behaviour? Update 2: I can see that the session is saved in MemoryCacheClient, however trying to retrieve it in the base controller via this.Cache.Get<CustomUserSession>(SessionKey) returns null (where SessionKey is like: urn:iauthsession:1)
@CODE:this.CreateRestClient().Post<RegistrationResponse>("/register", model); ss-id ss-pid this.UserSession this.CreateRestClient().Get<AuthResponse>("/auth/logout"); ss-id ss-pid MemoryCacheClient this.Cache.Get<CustomUserSession>(SessionKey) urn:iauthsession:1

@CONTENT:Consider the following from Effective Java Item 11 (Override clone judiciously) where Josh Bloch is explaining what is wrong with the clone() contract . There are a number of problems with this contract. The provision that ¡§no constructors are called¡¨ is too strong. A well-behaved clone method can call constructors to create objects internal to the clone under construction. If the class is final, clone can even return an object created by a constructor. Can someone explain what Josh Bloch is saying in the first paragraph by "If the class is final, clone can even return an object created by a constructor." What does final have to do with clone() here?

@LINK:/questions/10694676/what-is-the-correct-way-to-declare-a-readonly-property-for-ios-using-arc
@TITLE:What is the correct way to declare a readonly property for ios using ARC
@CONTENT:I am new to iOS development in general and have never dealt with manual reference counting (retain, release, autorelease). As such I don't have a good understanding of what magic ARC is performing. I thought I understood until I was asked what type of ownership (weak, strong, assign, etc) should be given to a readonly property pointing at an object, such as: @property (readonly,nonatomic) NSString* name;
 I read here Questions about a readonly @property in ARC that leaving off the strong/weak won't actually compile unless you specify a backing variable when you @synthesize the property; I just so happened to be specifying a backing ivar like this: @synthesize name = _name;
 Now I understand that the default 'lifetime qualifier' of a variable is strong, from here: http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/releasenotes/ObjectiveC/RN-TransitioningToARC/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011226-CH1-SW4 So to cut a long story short - I am indirectly defining my property as (readonly,nonatomic,strong) as the _name ivar is implicitly declared as __strong. I have a few questions: Is strong the correct lifetime qualifier to use? I assume that it is, otherwise the object backing my NSString* wouldn't be owned anywhere and would thus be freed automatically (coming from Java land this makes sense as all references are strong by default). Are there any other modifiers which make sense in this situation, such as copy or assign? Does declaring the property as (readonly,nonatomic,strong) and (readonly,nonatomic) make any difference to the code which consumes the property? eg. does declaring it without the strong keyword cause the object pointer to be stored as __unsafe_unretained where the strong property would be stored in a __strong pointer? Thanks! EDIT So as I understand now, the following applies to readonly properties: For non-NSObject* types (int, float, void*, etc) use (readonly, assign). For object pointers, use (readonly, strong) or (readonly, copy) - these function the same for readonly properties but you may want the copy semantics if you extend/subclass and redeclare the property as readwrite. For object pointers, (readonly, weak) only makes sense if you are going to be storing an already weak pointer in that property (that pointer must be strong elsewhere or the object will be deallocated).
@CODE:weak strong assign @property (readonly,nonatomic) NSString* name; strong weak @synthesize @synthesize name = _name; (readonly,nonatomic,strong) _name __strong strong NSString* copy assign (readonly,nonatomic,strong) (readonly,nonatomic) strong __unsafe_unretained strong __strong (readonly, assign) (readonly, strong) (readonly, copy) readwrite (readonly, weak) (readonly) (strong) (copy) (readwrite, copy)

I am looking for the best way to constrain the entire page to document.body.clientWidth - 300, thereby leaving the 300px on the right for my sidebar.

 I need a way to prevent the existing page elements from bleeding over into my sidebar.

I'm using socket.io to handle all such communication between a given server and the web application it serves - but what I'm looking for is a way to communicate server-to-server. I had initially assumed it would be as easy as something like this: var io = require("socket.io");
var socket = io.connect("my remote endpoint");
 However, as it turns out the server-side socket.io implementation doesn't offer a "connect" method, only a listen method. Why is this? Why can't I treat a node application server as a client to a socket.io server running elsewhere? Is there any way that I can achieve this functionality?

@TITLE:How do I use Controller specific stylesheets in Rails 3.2.1?
@CONTENT:Using Rails 3.2.1 I created a simple controller called Home using the command: rails g controller Home index
 And it created a new controller and view for me: Notice how there are two stylesheets, one "Application" and one "Home". I can't find any documentation to support this assumption but I'm guessing you put styles that will only be applied to the "Home" views, in the Home.css.scss file, correct? So as a test, I added in some global styles to Application.css.scss.erb and ran the application. The styles applied as expected. Next, I added in some rules to the Home.css.scss file and I visited a "Home/index" view, yet the style in that file wasn't attached, neither as a seperate CSS reference link, or even appended to the single Application.css.scss file. This is highly confusing to me, since the comments say: // Place all the styles related to the Home controller here.
// They will automatically be included in application.css.
// You can use Sass (SCSS) here: http://sass-lang.com/
 Why aren't the rules written in Home.css.scss applied to my website?

@CONTENT:I have my website that I am creating here and it's looking good (right now CSS3 media queries aren't working for IE) but I find my @font face is broken and looks like crap in Chrome for Windows (so far that's the only major one I've found). I've searched it up and found CSS3 rbg fix that is supposed to work however it did nothing for me. Did the bulletproof fix from Paul Irish however then my font breaks in Android. I've been researching this fro a couple hours now but can't seem to find anything that will work. I've heard of Cufon but I'm trying to stick with @font face as it's just for Chrome that I'm having this trouble. I went to font squirrel and got the font face kit for the font I am using so it looks like this @font-face {

     url('geosanslight-webfont.svg#GeosansLightRegular') format('svg');
font-weight: normal;
font-style: normal;

}
 It works with most of the browsers (again I haven't had a chance to test EVERY single one, but I have checked it on IE 6-9 and it looks good, FF 9 for Windows and FF 8 for OSX, Safari Opera and it looks great. Chrome for windows is just not working well with the @font face command. Does anyone have advice as to what I can do to either make it look better or fix it? (Aside from removing the @font face class and using regular font.) Also, I could however end up using a conditional comment from Chrome to just view a regular font but then my HTML wouldn't validate eh? So any help would be appreciated..

@TITLE:Move UIScrollView when keyboard comes into place
@CONTENT:[Edit:] The problem has been solved. I did not have my delegates linked properly in UIBuilder. Code is good! I am trying to resize a scrollview when the keyboard appears. I went to the developer docs and found this information. http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/StringsTextFonts/Conceptual/TextAndWebiPhoneOS/KeyboardManagement/KeyboardManagement.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009542-CH5-SW1 On the left "Managing the keyboard". In the documentation it shows a bit of code to detect the size of the keyboard and then to resize a UIScrollView. I have placed an NSLog message in the code for function "- (void)keyboardWasShown:(NSNotification*)aNotification" so I see that the function is actually being called, but when I try to to NSLog the kbSize.height it is always valued at 0. Why does the code that apple provide for this purpose not work? - (void)keyboardWasShown:(NSNotification*)aNotification
{
    NSDictionary* info = [aNotification userInfo];
    CGSize kbSize = [[info objectForKey:UIKeyboardFrameBeginUserInfoKey] CGRectValue].size;

    UIEdgeInsets contentInsets = UIEdgeInsetsMake(0.0, 0.0, kbSize.height, 0.0);
    scrollView.contentInset = contentInsets;
    scrollView.scrollIndicatorInsets = contentInsets;

    // If active text field is hidden by keyboard, scroll it so it's visible
    // Your application might not need or want this behavior.
    CGRect aRect = self.view.frame;
    aRect.size.height -= kbSize.height;
    if (!CGRectContainsPoint(aRect, activeField.frame.origin) ) {

@CONTENT:I am using PyDev for development and unit-testing of my Python application. As for unit-testing, everything works great behalf the fact that content logged to any logging. Logger is not captured by the "Captured output" of PyDev. I already forward everything logged to the standard output like this: import sys
logger = logging.getLogger()
logger.level = logging.DEBUG
logger.addHandler(logging.StreamHandler(sys.stdout))
 Nevertheless the "Captured output" does not display stuff logged to loggers. Here an example unittest-script: test.py import sys
import unittest
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger()
logger.level = logging.DEBUG
logger.addHandler(logging.StreamHandler(sys.stdout))

class TestCase(unittest.TestCase):
    def testSimpleMsg(self):
        print("AA")
        logging.getLogger().info("BB")
 The console output is: Finding files... done.

@TITLE:What's the accepted method for deploying a linux application that relies on shared libraries?
@CONTENT:I have an application that relies on Qt, GDCM, and VTK, with the main build environment being Qt. All of these libraries are cross-platform and compile on Windows, Mac, and Linux. I need to deploy the application to Linux after deploying on Windows. The versions of vtk and gdcm I'm using are trunk versions from git (about a month old), more recent than what I can get apt-get on Ubuntu 11.04, which is my current (and only) Linux deployment target. What is the accepted method for deploying an application that relies on these kinds of libraries? Should I be statically linking here, to avoid LD_LIBRARY_PATH? I see conflicting reports on LD_LIBRARY_PATH; tutorials like this one suggest that it's the 'right way' to modify the library path to use shared libraries through system reboots. Others suggest that I should never set LD_LIBRARY_PATH. In the default version of GDCM, the installation already puts libraries into the /usr/local/lib directory, so those libraries get seen when I run ldd <my program>. VTK, on the other hand, puts its libraries into /usr/local/lib/vtk-5.9, which is not part of the LD_LIBRARY_PATH on most user's machines, and so is not found unless some change is made to the system. Copying the VTK files into '/usr/local/lib' does not allow 'ldd' to see the files. So, how can I make my application see VTK to use the libraries? On windows, deploying the dlls is very straightforward, because I can just include them in the installer, and the application finds them because they are in the local directory. That approach does not work in Linux, so I was going to have the users install Qt, GDCM, and VTK from whatever appropriate source and use the default locations, and then have the application point to those default locations. However, since VTK is putting things into a non-standard location, should I also expect users to modify LD_LIBRARY_PATH? Should I include the specific versions of the libraries that I want and then figure out how to make the executable look in the local directory for those libraries and ignore the ones it finds in the library path?

@TITLE:Android style Resources compile (aapt) failing : Bad resource table: header size 0xc
@CONTENT:I just spent a few hours with a horrible Android Resource pre compile problem to do with styles and was wondering could anyone explain what caused it. I fixed it but dont know whats the problem. Not helped by Android saying the error was in colors.xml and not in another xml. Step 1 - to recreate error Given a style
<style name="ActionBarTitleContainer">
    <item name="android:id">@id/title_container</item>
    <item name="android:layout_width">fill_parent</item>
    <item name="android:layout_height">@dimen/title_height</item>
    <item name="android:orientation">horizontal</item>
    <item name="android:background">@color/title_color_light</item>
</style>
 I copied it, gave it new, android:id     <item name="android:id">@id/info_container</item>


<style name="ActionBarTitleContainer">
    <item name="android:id">@id/title_container</item>
    <item name="android:layout_width">fill_parent</item>
    <item name="android:layout_height">@dimen/title_height</item>
    <item name="android:orientation">horizontal</item>
    <item name="android:background">@color/title_color_light</item>
</style>
<style name="ActionBarInfoContainer">

    <item name="android:layout_width">fill_parent</item>

    <item name="android:orientation">horizontal</item>
    <item name="android:background">@color/title_color_light</item>
</style>
 Saved and Compile said error in id <style name="ActionBarInfoContainer">
    <item name="android:id">@id/info_container</item>

Description Resource Path Location Type
error: Error: No resource found that matches the given name (at 'android:id' with value '@id/info_container'). styles.xml /MyApp/res/values line 68 Android AAPT Problem
 So mistakenly I added a + before the id <style name="ActionBarInfoContainer">
    <item name="android:id">@+id/info_container</item>
 Then got error W/ResourceType( 2202): Bad resource table: header size 0xc or total size 0x4aba is not on an integer boundary
W/ResourceType( 2202): Bad resource table: header size 0xc or total size 0x4aba is not on an integer boundary
ERROR: Unable to parse generated resources, aborting.
'aapt' error. Pre Compiler Build aborted.
 Sadly I had added a lot of style etc not just this one so spent ages back tracking to find the error. Not helped by Android saying error occuring in colors.xml when it wasnt. Fixed by removing the + from styles.xml placing new id in ids.xml  <style name="ActionBarTitleContainer">
    <item name="android:id">@id/title_container</item>
    ....
</style>
<style name="ActionBarInfoContainer">
    <item name="android:id">@id/info_container</item>
    ....
</style>
 Changed @+id/info_container to @id/info_container And adding id to ids.xml <resources>
    <item type="id" name="title_container" />
    <item type="id" name="info_container" />
 Any idea what the error means because it took me a few hours of pain to track it down. Not helped by Android aapt compiler saying the error was caused around colors.xml. Is this error caused by me compiling against 2.1U1? I have the latest SDK but there is an aapt in each platform folder but date against it is APR 2011. And for future reference as I found very little info on aapt resource compiling. Heres some tips for people with Resource compilation errors, so you dont lose hours on bad google error reporting: TIP 1 - TURN ON VERBOSE ANDROID BUILD OUTPUT Open Eclipse Preferences
Open in the list on the left 
    Android 
        Build
Set Build output to
    Verbose
Hit OK
Open Console View
Window > View > Console
Do clean build or type a space in and file and hit save if you dont want to do full build
Resources compiler aapt will run first
and throw error
 Two issues Issue 1 - error in red may appear in output in confusing location probably caused by Exception being throw in a thread but other files still compile ok before build process fully stops. Notice here how the error seems to occur after nearest_bus_stops_layout.xml.

 THIS IS NOT THE FILE WHERE THE ERROR IS. TIP: How to FIND WHICH FILE EXACTLY CAUSING THE PROBLEM Find the last file that's mentioned before the error message: 'aapt' error. Pre Compiler Build aborted.
 This is /send_email_activity.xml
 PROBLEM: send_email_activity.xml isnt the file with the error. send_email_activity.xml compiled ok and was output. ITS THE ONE AFTER /send_email_activity.xml that we want Problem: filename that threw the error missing. How to Find the file AFTER /send_email_activity.xml that caused the error Scroll UP in console output to Files:
 The aapt compiler lists all files its found and is going to compile. Luckily the order in Files: is the same as when the error is thrown down below Look for the last file to compile (send_email_activity.xml) in the Files: section TIP In the Console window find the last file that compiled ok before the error 
'send_email_activity.xml'
And do CTRL/CMD(Mac) + F for previous occurrences under the Files: section
 We can see here that /send_email_activity.xml is followed by colors.xml Files:
  drawable/alphabet_bar_bg.xml
    Src: /Users/clearbrian/Documents/workspace/LondonBusStopMaps/res/drawable/alphabet_bar_bg.xml
  drawable/alphabet_separator_bg.xml
    Src: /Users/clearbrian/Documents/workspace/LondonBusStopMaps/res/drawable/alphabet_separator_bg.xml
.......
layout/send_email_activity.xml

 .......
values/themes.xml
 Src: /Users/clearbrian/Documents/workspace/LondonBusStopMaps/res/values/themes.xml
AndroidManifest.xml
 Src: /Users/clearbrian/Documents/workspace/LondonBusStopMaps/AndroidManifest.xml
 ANSWER: colors.xml IS THE FILE THAT CAUSED 'aapt' error. Pre Compiler Build aborted. And also the error: [2011-05-15 16:22:25 - MyApp] W/ResourceType( 2247): Bad resource table: header size 0xc or total size 0x4aba is not on an integer boundary
[2011-05-15 16:22:25 - MyApp] W/ResourceType( 2247): Bad resource table: header size 0xc or total size 0x4aba is not on an integer boundary
[2011-05-15 16:22:25 - MyApp] ERROR: Unable to parse generated resources, aborting.
 Problem 2: the error ISNT in colors.xml. I had changed a color value in colors.xml but it had been referenced in styles.xml styles.xml  <style name="ActionBarInfoContainer">
      <item name="android:id">@id/info_container</item>
 ...
      <item name="android:background">@color/title_color_light</item>
</style>
 So in the compile process it probably tried to compile styles.xml then saw @color so then compiled colors.xml. Or visa versa (ask Google) So it reported the error as being in colors.xml when in fast it was styles.xml/ids.xml And the possible error was only noticed when I saw the difference in id between the <style name="ActionBarTitleContainer">
     <item name="android:id">@id/title_container</item>
     ...
</style>
<style name="ActionBarInfoContainer">
     <item name="android:id">@+id/info_container</item>
     ...
 </style>
 The line  <item name="android:id">@+id/info_container</item>
 Should be (no +)  <item name="android:id">@id/info_container</item>
 And id should be in ids.xml <resources>
     <item type="id" name="title_container" />
     <item type="id" name="info_container"  />
 XML ..the punchcards of the new millenium!

@TITLE:How to display 2 lines of text for subtitle of MKAnnotation and change the image for the button on the right?
@CONTENT:I am looking at Apple's MapCallouts example for map annotations and callouts (==bubbles that appear when you click on a pin). Every annotation there has coordinates, title and subtitle. I would like to display subtitle in 2 lines, i tried with: - (NSString *)subtitle
{
return @"Founded: June 29, 1776\nSecond line text";
}
 but the text "Second line text" stays in one line and makes bubble wider.I get this: I would also like to change image of the button to one of my own's, the code that sets the button is currently like this: UIButton* rightButton = [UIButton buttonWithType:UIButtonTypeDetailDisclosure];
 Any ideas? EDIT: I tried 7KV7's advice. Button change is successful, but i still cant get subtitles in 2 lines. My code: MKPinAnnotationView* customPinView = [[[MKPinAnnotationView alloc]
                                        initWithAnnotation:annotation reuseIdentifier:BridgeAnnotationIdentifier] autorelease];
        customPinView.pinColor = MKPinAnnotationColorPurple;
        customPinView.animatesDrop = YES;


        // Button
        UIButton *button = [UIButton buttonWithType:UIButtonTypeCustom];
        button.frame = CGRectMake(0, 0, 23, 23);
        button.contentVerticalAlignment = UIControlContentVerticalAlignmentCenter;
        button.contentHorizontalAlignment = UIControlContentHorizontalAlignmentCenter;

        //UIEdgeInsets titleInsets = UIEdgeInsetsMake(7.0, -20.0, 7.0, 7.0);
        //button.titleEdgeInsets = titleInsets;

        [button setImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"ic_phone_default.png"] forState:UIControlStateNormal];
        //[button setImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"ic_phone_selected.png"] forState:UIControlStateSelected];
        [button setImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"ic_phone_selected.png"] forState:UIControlStateHighlighted];
        [button addTarget:self action:@selector(showDetails:) forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchUpInside];

        customPinView.rightCalloutAccessoryView = button;

        //two labels
        UIView *leftCAV = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0,0,50,50)];
        //[leftCAV addSubview : button];
        UILabel *l1=[[UILabel alloc] init];

 What's the reasoning behind these? Is it some sort of abstraction I'm not understanding? Edit: For those people mentioning compiler cross-compatilibity: My question is not about why they didn't use unsigned long long instead of, say, DWORD64. My question is about why would anyone use DWORD64 instead of ULONG64 (or vice-versa)? Aren't both of those typedefed to be 64 bits wide? Or, as another example: Even in a "hypothetical" compiler that was meant to deceive us in every respect, what would be the difference between ULONG_PTR and UINT_PTR and DWORD_PTR? Aren't those all abstract data types just meaning the same thing -- SIZE_T? However, I am asking why they used ULONGLONG instead of long long -- is there any potential difference in meaning, covered by neither long long nor DWORDLONG?

@CONTENT:I have a POCO class that has two one-way unary relationships with another class, both classes share an ancestor. The names of the foreign keys in the generated schema do not reflect the property names. (Properties MainContact and FinancialContact give PersonId and PersonId1 field names). How can I influence schema generation to generate database column names that match the property names? The model looks like this: The code looks like this: public class CustomerContext: DbContext
{
   public DbSet<Organisation> Organisations { get; set; }
   public DbSet<Person> Persons { get; set; }

   protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder builder)
   {

   public string Name { get; set; }
}

public class Person : Customer
{
   public string Email { get; set; }
}

public class Organisation : Customer
{
   public Person FinancialContact { get; set; }
   public Person MainContact { get; set; }
}
 The schema looks like this: Answer from druttka druttka's answer below did the job and it's nice to know that it's a CTP5 bug that's behind this. EF also needs the cascade behaviour to be specified and I've used the fluent API to do this following the example in the link given by druttka. Some more good reading from Morteza Manavi here. The code now is this: public class CustomerContext : DbContext
{
   public DbSet<Organisation> Organisations { get; set; }
   public DbSet<Person> Persons { get; set; }

   protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder builder)
   {
      DbDatabase.SetInitializer(new DropCreateDatabaseAlways<CustomerContext>());

      builder.Entity<Organisation>()
         .HasRequired(p => p.MainContact)
         .WithMany()
         .HasForeignKey(p => p.MainContactId)
         .WillCascadeOnDelete(false);
      builder.Entity<Organisation>()
         .Property(p => p.MainContactId)
         .HasColumnName("MainContact");

      builder.Entity<Organisation>()
         .HasRequired(p => p.FinancialContact)
         .WithMany()
         .HasForeignKey(p => p.FinancialContactId)
         .WillCascadeOnDelete(false);
      builder.Entity<Organisation>()
         .Property(p => p.FinancialContactId)
         .HasColumnName("FinancialContact");
   }
}

public abstract class Customer
{
   public int Id { get; set; }
   public string Name { get; set; }
}

public class Person : Customer
{
   public string Email { get; set; }
}

public class Organisation : Customer
{
   public Person FinancialContact { get; set; }
   public int FinancialContactId { get; set; }

   public Person MainContact { get; set; }
   public int MainContactId { get; set; }
}

unless the script has also called the global .ajaxError()  method or. 

As of jQuery 1.5, the .error() method of the jqXHR object 
returned by jQuery.get() is also available for error handling. So, if all goes well, my callback function for success will be called. However, if the request fails, I would like to get the HTTP code :404, 502, etc and formulate a meaningful error message for the user. However, since this is an asynchronous call I can imagine that I might have several outstanding. How would .ajaxError() know which request it corresponds to? Maybe it would be better to use the .error() method of the jqXHR object returned by jQuery.get()? Can someone please prvode an extremely simple code example? Perhaps the success routine calls Alert("Page found") and the failure routine checks for 404 and does an Alert("Page not found") Update: the following page is extremely helpful ... http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/

@TITLE:C: avoiding overflows when working with big numbers
@CONTENT:I've implemented some sorting algorithms (to sort integers) in C, carefully using uint64_t to store anything which has got to do with the data size (thus also counters and stuff), since the algorithms should be tested also with data sets of several giga of integers. The algorithms should be fine, and there should be no problems about the amount of data allocated: data is stored on files, and we only load little chunks per time, everything works fine even when we choke the in-memory buffers to any size. Tests with datasets up to 4 giga ints (thus 16GB of data) work fine (sorting 4Gint took 2228 seconds, ~37 minutes), but when we go above that (ie: 8 Gints) the algorithm doesn't seem to halt (it's been running for about 16 hours now). I'm afraid the problem could be due to integer overflow, maybe a counter in a loop is stored on a 32 bits variable, or maybe we're calling some functions that works with 32 bits integers. What else could it be? Is there any easy way to check whether an integer overflow occurs at runtime?

While finishing up an app that I've nearly completed, I noticed that I couldn't get local notifications to work, no matter what I tried. So instead of wasting time, I decided to go back to basics and see if I could get them working at all.

    theNotification.fireDate = [NSDate dateWithTimeIntervalSinceNow:10];

    [[UIApplication sharedApplication] scheduleLocalNotification:theNotification];

 However, that also doesn't do anything at all. I expected to see a notification 10 seconds after launching the app, but nothing appears. Also, I tested this on both my iPhone and the simulator.

  <behaviors>
    <endpointBehaviors>

      <endpoint address="mex" binding="mexHttpBinding" contract="IMetadataExchange" />
    </service>
  </services>
</system.serviceModel>
 Unfortunately, however, there's a problem with this. This web service needs to be deployed to hundreds of our customers' servers, and not all of them will be using https. Deploying it to a server that doesn't have an https binding set up in IIS causes it to fail. Is there a way to have both of these bindings in the web.config by default without it dying if there's not an https binding set up in IIS? We've got a possible solution for this problem, but it doesn't really fit well with our deployment requirements. Has anybody else encountered anything like this before, and how did you resolve it?

 In text mode, the variables listed after 'a' would indent as written above, but in ruby mode they would instead be flush with 'attr_accessor'. How can I get ruby mode to indent like text mode in this situation?

@TITLE:Android: Disable rotations by 90¢X, but enable rotations by 180¢X
@CONTENT:I would like to create an Android app (for a tablet) that should be only displayed in landscape orientation, e.g. the app should ignore rotations by 90¢X, but support rotations by 180¢X. Adding android:screenOrientation="landscape" in the manifest causes the app to ignore all rotations, (even the 180¢X rotations), i.e. rotating the device by 180¢X shows the application upside down. Without the android:screenOrientation attribute my app is displayed "correctly" in all four positions. Rotation the device by 180¢X flips the UI vertically resp. horizontally. When rotation the device the following log messages are created (maybe this helps?): [...]: INFO/WindowManager(1290): Setting rotation to 1, animFlags=0
Rotation is a value between 0 and 3 representing the current orientation.
 Summarized: Is it possible to enable an app to support both landscape orientations?

'$1+2**(x+y)$'

 I make soma calculations, then I get the angles for each axis.   float R =  sqrt(pow(Rx,2)+pow(Ry,2)+pow(Rz,2));

@TITLE:Getting Python under control on Mac OS X - setting up environment and libraries
@CONTENT:After starting out with Python on Ubuntu Linux, I've now for a good while been doing most of my sustained work on the Mac, currently Mac?OS?X 10.6. Unfortunately I've neglected to give proper attention to how Python is installed there and ended up with: Python 2.6.1 (Mac default version?) in /usr/bin (also, 2.5.4, which I'm not sure how it got there) Python 2.6.5 installed via MacPorts in /opt/local/bin/. This is my default I use pip to install libraries, which end up in some ungodly place (something like /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/lib/python2.6/site-packages/ - SRSLY?) Otherwise, mostly TextMate, and Git for version control. Django and Google App Engine, etc... Now I'm preparing to set up 2.7 and 3.2, and I am unhappy with the haphazard state of things. So what are your favourite approaches to organising the code and libraries, and how have you wrestled the Mac into submission? I'd like to continue using pip, but would like to have more control or at least understanding of what libraries for which version are getting installed and made accessible from where: I've had problems with installing py.test via pip and only being able to load it from the obsolete 2.6.1 Python, not my current 2.6.5 one. MacPorts has python_select, but it's not overly helpful: reason: chris$ python_select -l
Available versions:
current none python26 python26-apple
 Most Python people I've asked don't use MacPorts, which I don't much like, but the stock Mac Python from python.org. I've also heard the recommendation to use virtualenv systematically, so what is the link to a good practical introduction?

@TITLE:If you delete a DOM element, do any events that started with that element continue to bubble?
@CONTENT:What behavior should I expect if I delete a DOM element that was used to start an event bubble, or whose child started the event bubble - will it continue to bubble if the element is removed? For example - lets say you have a table, and want to detect click events on the table cells. Another piece of JS has executed an AJAX request that will eventually replace the table, in full, once the request is complete. What happens if I click the table, and immediately after the table gets replaced by a successful completion of an AJAX request? I ask because I am seeing some behavior where the click events don't seem to be bubbling - but it is hard to duplicate. I am watching the event on a parent element of the table (instead of attaching the event to every TD), and it just doesn't seem to reach it sometimes. EDIT: Encountered this problem again, and finally got to the root of it. Was not a event-bubbling issue at all! See my answer below for details.

@TITLE:Get Method Name Using Lambda Expression
@CONTENT:I'm trying to get the name of a method on a type using a lambda expression. I'm using Windows Identity Foundation and need to define access policies with the type name with namespace as a resource and the method name as the action. Here is an example. This is the type I would be getting the type name and method name from: namespace My.OrderEntry {
    public class Order {
        public void AddItem(string itemNumber, int quantity) {}
    }
}
 This is how I would like to define the access policy through a DSL: ForResource<Order>().Performing(o => o.AddItem).AllowUsersHaving(new Claim());
 From that statement, I would like to get "My.OrderEntry.Order" as the resource and "AddItem" as the action. Getting the type name with namespace is no problem, but I don't think I can use a lambda for a method like I'm trying to do. public static IPermissionExp Performing<T>(
    this IActionExp<T> exp,
    Func<T, delegate???> action) {} //this is where I don't know what to define
 Is this sort of thing even possible to do? Is there another way to do this sort of thing without using magic strings?

    public class Order {
        public void AddItem(string itemNumber, int quantity) {}

@TITLE:Killing the child processes with the parent process
@CONTENT:I have a program spawning and communicating with cpu heavy, unstable processes, not created by me. If my app crashes or is killed by sigkill, I want the subprocesses to get killed as well, so the user don?t have to track them down and kill them manually. I know this topic has been covered before, but I have tried all methods described, and none of them seams to live up to survive the test. I know it must be possible, since terminals do it all the time. If I run something in a terminal, and kill the terminal, the stuff always dies. I have tried atexit, double fork and ptys. atexit doenst work for sigkill; double fork doesnt work at all; and ptys I have found no way to work with using python. Today I found out about prctl(PR_SET_PDEATHSIG, SIGKILL), which should be a way for childprocesses to order a kill on themselves, when their parent dies. I tried to use it in python, with popen, but it seams to have no effect at all: import ctypes, subprocess
libc = ctypes.CDLL('/lib/libc.so.6')
PR_SET_PDEATHSIG = 1; TERM = 15
implant_bomb = lambda: libc.prctl(PR_SET_PDEATHSIG, TERM)
subprocess.Popen(['gnuchess'], preexec_fn=implant_bomb)
 In the above the child is created and the parent exits. Now you would expect gnuchess to recieve a SIGKILL and die, but it doesnt. I can still find it in my process mamager using 100% cpu. Can anybody tell me if there is something wrong with my use of prctl?, or do you know how terminals manage to kill their children?

libc = ctypes.CDLL('/lib/libc.so.6')

@TITLE:null objects vs. empty objects
@CONTENT:[ This is a result of Best Practice: Should functions return null or an empty object? but I'm trying to be very general. ] In a lot of legacy (um...production) C++ code that I've seen, there is a tendency to write a lot of NULL (or similar) checks to test pointers. Many of these get added near the end of a release cycle when adding a NULL-check provides a quick fix to a crash caused by the pointer dereference--and there isn't a lot of time to investigate. To combat this, I started to write code that took a (const) reference parameter instead of the (much) more common technique of passing a pointer. No pointer, no desire to check for NULL (ignoring the corner case of actually having a null reference). In C#, the same C++ "problem" is present: the desire to check every unknown reference against null (ArgumentNullException) and to quickly fix NullReferenceExceptions by adding a null check. It seems to me, one way to prevent this is to avoid null objects in the first place by using empty objects (String.Empty, EventArgs.Empty) instead. Another would be to throw an exception rather than return null. I'm just starting to learn F#, but it appears there are far fewer null objects in that enviroment. So maybe you don't really have to have a lot of null references floating around? Am I barking up the wrong tree here?

@CONTENT:I am writing a web application for my engineering company (warning: I am a programmer only by hobby) and was planning on using Django until I hit this snag. The models I want to use naturally have multi-column primary keys. Per http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/373, I can't use Django, at least not a released version. Can anyone help me with a workaround, whether it be via another web framework (Python-based only, please) or by suggesting changes to the model so it will work with Django's limitations? I am really hoping for the latter, as I was hoping to use this as an opportunity to learn Django. Example: Table one has part_number and part_revision as two fields that should comprise a primary key. A P/N can exist at multiple revisions, but P/N + rev are unique. Table two has part_number, part_revision and dimension_number as its primary key. A P/N at a specific rev can have a number of dimensions, however, each is unique. Also, in this case, P/N + rev should be a ForeignKey of Table one.

@TITLE:Do you put your database static data into source-control ? How?
@CONTENT:I'm using SQL-Server 2008 with Visual Studio Database Edition. With this setup, keeping your schema in sync is very easy. Basically, there's a 'compare schema' tool that allow me to sync the schema of two databases and/or a database schema with a source-controlled creation script folder. However, the situation is less clear when it comes to data, which can be of three different kind : static data referenced in the code. typical example : my users can change their setting, and their configuration is stored on the server. However, there's a system-wide default value for each setting that is used in case the user didn't override it. The table containing those default settings grows as more options are added to the program. This means that when a new feature/option is checked in, the system-wide default setting is usually created in the database as well. static data. eg. a product list populating a dropdown list. The program doesn't rely on the existence of a specific product in the list to work. This can be for example a list of unicode-encoded products that should be deployed in production when the new "unicode version" of the program is deployed. other data, ie everything else (logs, user accounts, user data, etc.) It seems obvious to me that my third item shouldn't be source-controlled (of course, it should be backuped on a regular basis) But regarding the static data, I'm wondering what to do. Should I append the insert scripts to the creation scripts? or maybe use separate scripts? How do I (as a developer) warn the people doing the deployment that they should execute an insert statement ? Should I differentiate my two kind of data? (the first one being usually created by a dev, while the second one is usually created by a non-dev) How do you manage your DB static data ?

@CONTENT:I have lots of data with start and stop times for a given ID and I need to flatten all intersecting and adjacent timespans into one combined timespan. The sample data posted below is all for the same ID so I didn't list it. To make things a bit clearer, take a look at the sample data for 03.06.2009: The following timespans are overlapping or contiunous and need to merge into one timespan 05:54:48 - 10:00:13 09:26:45 - 09:59:40 The resulting timespan would be from 05:54:48 to 10:00:13. Since there's a gap between 10:00:13 and 10:12:50 we also have the following timespans: 10:12:50 - 10:27:25 10:13:12 - 11:14:56 10:27:25 - 10:27:31 10:27:39 - 13:53:38 11:14:56 - 11:15:03 11:15:30 - 14:02:14 13:53:38 - 13:53:43 14:02:14 - 14:02:31 which result in one merged timespan from 10:12:50 to 14:02:31, since they're overlapping or adjacent. Below you will find the sample data and the flattened data as I would need it. The duration column is just informative. Any solution - be it SQL or not - is appreciated. EDIT: Since there are lots of different and interesting solutions I'm refining my original question by adding constraints to see the "best" (if there is one) solution bubble up: I'm getting the data via ODBC from another system. There's no way to change the table layout for me or adding indexes The data is indexed only by the date column (the time part isn't) There are about 2.5k rows for every day The estimated usage pattern of the data is roughly as follows: Most of the time (lets say 90%) the user will query just one or two days (2.5k - 5k rows) Sometimes (9%) the range will be up to a month (~75k rows) Rarely (1%) the range will be up to a year (~900k rows) The query should be fast for the typical case and not "last forever" for the rare case. Querying a year worth of data takes about 5 minutes (plain select without joins) Within these constraints, what would be the best solution? I'm afraid that most of the solutions will be horribly slow since they join on the combination of date and time, which is not an index field in my case. Would you do all the merging on the client or the server side? Would you first create an optimized temp table and use one of the proposed solutions with that table? I didn't have the time to test the solutions until now but I will keep you informed what works best for me. Sample data: Date       | Start    | Stop

@TITLE:How can I visualise the memory (SRAM) usage of an AVR program?
@CONTENT:I have encountered a problem in a C program running on an AVR microcontroller (ATMega328P). I believe it is due to a stack/heap collision but I'd like to be able to confirm this. Is there any way I can visualise SRAM usage by the stack and the heap? Note: the program is compiled with avr-gcc and uses avr-libc. Update: The actual problem I am having is that the malloc implementation is failing (returning NULL). All mallocing happens on startup and all freeing happens at the end of the application (which in practice is never since the main part of the application is in an infinite loop). So I'm sure fragmentation is not the issue.

@CONTENT:In the ProtoBuf-Net implementation, what does the ProtoInclude attribute mean, and what does it do? An example would be appreciated. I saw it in this post and I'm not sure what it does. The example was: [Serializable,
 ProtoContract,
 ProtoInclude(50, typeof(BeginRequest))]
abstract internal class BaseMessage

  [ProtoMember(1)]
  abstract public UInt16 messageType { get; }
}

[Serializable,

 Also, is there a way to generate such inheritance using the protogen tool?

 ProtoInclude(50, typeof(BeginRequest))]
abstract internal class BaseMessage

@TITLE:ASP.net RequiredFieldValidator not preventing postback
@CONTENT:I have a question about what could stop a RequiredFieldValidator from preventing a postback. I began working on an older, but simple aspx form and my predecessor used manual, server-side form validation (checking to see if some form fields have a value and if not displaying an error message in a label). I thought I'd clean out some unneeded code and replace the manual checking with RequiredFieldValidator controls, but while they appear to be validating, they aren't preventing a postback. Ie., I get my error messages displayed but the postback still occurs. The form is quite simple and there are no CausesValidation="false" attributes set. My controls look like:  <asp:TextBox ID="txtPhone" Runat="server" Columns="20" MaxLength="20" />
 <asp:RequiredFieldValidator ID="rfvPhone" runat="server" Display="Dynamic"
      ErrorMessage="* Required" ControlToValidate="txtPhone" />
 I created a brand new webform in the same project with just a single textbox, validator and submit button and it acts the same way. Error message displays but postback still occurs. Is there a global or project-wide setting that would cause this behaviour? Something in the web.config or global.asax?

@CONTENT:I have two arrays built while parsing a text file. The first contains the column names, the second contains the values from the current row. I need to iterate over both lists at once to build a map. Right now I have the following: var currentValues = currentRow.Split(separatorChar);
var valueEnumerator = currentValues.GetEnumerator();

foreach (String column in columnList)
{
    valueEnumerator.MoveNext();
    valueMap.Add(column, (String)valueEnumerator.Current);

 This works just fine, but it doesn't quite satisfy my sense of elegance, and it gets really hairy if the number of arrays is larger than two (as I have to do occasionally). Does anyone have another, terser idiom?

@TITLE:Javascript automatic getter/setters (John Resig Book)
@CONTENT:I'm reading "Pro Javascript Techniques" from John Resig, and I'm confused with an example. This is the code: // Create a new user object that accepts an object of properties
function User( properties ) {
  // Iterate through the properties of the object, and make sure
  // that it's properly scoped (as discussed previously)
  for ( var i in properties ) { (function(){
  // Create a new getter for the property
  this[ "get" + i ] = function() {
    return properties[i];
  };
  // Create a new setter for the property
  this[ "set" + i ] = function(val) {
    properties[i] = val;
  };
})(); }
}

// Create a new user object instance and pass in an object of
// properties to seed it with
var user = new User({
  name: "Bob",
  age: 44
});

// Just note that the name property does not exist, as it's private
// within the properties object
alert( user.name == null );

// However, we're able to access its value using the new getname()
// method, that was dynamically generated
alert( user.getname() == "Bob" );

// Finally, we can see that it's possible to set and get the age using
// the newly generated functions
user.setage( 22 );
alert( user.getage() == 22 );
 Now running that on Firebug console (on FF3) throws that user.getname() is not a function. I tried doing this: var other = User
other()
window.getname() --> this works!
 And it worked! Any idea why? thanks everybody! PS: I strongly recommend this book. EDIT: doing: var me = this;
 seems to work a bit better, but when executing "getname()" it returns '44' (the second property)... also I find it strange that it worked on the window object without modification... and a third question, what's the difference between PEZ solution and the original? (he doesn't use an anonymous function) Thanks to everyone for the feedback! +1

  // acquire MyMutex
  DoSomethingElse(s, t);
  // release MyMutex
}
 From what I have found so far it seems that it is not possible to use a single delegate for two methods with different signatures. Are there any other alternatives to write something like this: public void UsingMutex(...)
{
  // acquire MyMutex
  ...
  // release MyMutex
}

UsingMutex(M1);
UsingMutex(M2);
 All I can think for the moment is to use two delegates and a boolean flag to know which delegate to call, but it is not a long term solution. It is possible to combine generics with delegates? And if so, do you have some links for any kind of documentation? Environment: C# 2.0
@CODE:public void M1(Int32 a)
{
  // acquire MyMutex
  DoSomething(a);
  // release MyMutex
} public void M2(String s, String t)
{
  // acquire MyMutex
  DoSomethingElse(s, t);
  // release MyMutex
} public void UsingMutex(...)
{
  // acquire MyMutex
  ...
  // release MyMutex
}

UsingMutex(M1);
UsingMutex(M2);

@CONTENT:I have been working on a legacy C++ application and am definitely outside of my comfort-zone (a good thing). I was wondering if anyone out there would be so kind as to give me a few pointers (pun intended). I need to cast 2 bytes in an unsigned char array to an unsigned short. The bytes are consecutive. For an example of what I am trying to do: I receive a string from a socket and place it in an unsigned char array. I can ignore the first byte and then the next 2 bytes should be converted to an unsigned char. This will be on windows only so there are no Big/Little Endian issues (that I am aware of). Here is what I have now (not working obviously): //packetBuffer is an unsigned char array containing the string "123456789" for testing
//I need to convert bytes 2 and 3 into the short, 2 being the most significant byte
//so I would expect to get 515 (2*256 + 3) instead all the code I have tried gives me
//either errors or 2 (only converting one byte
unsigned short myShort;
myShort = static_cast<unsigned_short>(packetBuffer[1])

I've got a system I'm building which includes business contact information. Pretty common no doubt. My test/demo database currently has randomly generated individual's names loaded (thanks to a handy IRS spreadsheet I found). This has worked great for internal testing and review purposes, but it looks really odd when shown to prospective customers. I've tried various online public information sources (e.g. EDGAR, and county based property records searches), but these all require me to manually stitch together the results in blocks of 50 names or so at a time. I could do this, but was really hoping for a search service or data store out there that had this type of information readily searchable and retrievable in very large batches.

@LINK:/questions/124946/c-sharp-file-read-write-fileshare-doesnt-appear-to-work
@TITLE:C# file read/write fileshare doesn't appear to work
@CONTENT:My question is based off of inheriting a great deal of legacy code that I can't do very much about. Basically, I have a device that will produce a block of data. A library which will call the device to create that block of data, for some reason I don't entirely understand and cannot change even if I wanted to, writes that block of data to disk. This write is not instantaneous, but can take up to 90 seconds. In that time, the user wants to get a partial view of the data that's being produced, so I want to have a consumer thread which reads the data that the other library is writing to disk. Before I even touch this legacy code, I want to mimic the problem using code I entirely control. I'm using C#, ostensibly because it provides a lot of the functionality I want. In the producer class, I have this code creating a random block of data: FileStream theFS = new FileStream(this.ScannerRawFileName, 
  FileMode.OpenOrCreate, FileAccess.Write, FileShare.Read);
//note that I need to be able to read this elsewhere...
BinaryWriter theBinaryWriter = new BinaryWriter(theFS);
int y, x;
for (y = 0; y < imheight; y++){
    ushort[] theData= new ushort[imwidth];
    for(x = 0; x < imwidth;x++){
       theData[x] = (ushort)(2*y+4*x);
    }
    byte[] theNewArray = new byte[imwidth * 2];
    Buffer.BlockCopy(theImage, 0, theNewArray, 0, imwidth * 2);
    theBinaryWriter.Write(theNewArray);
    Thread.Sleep(mScanThreadWait); //sleep for 50 milliseconds
    Progress = (float)(y-1 >= 0 ? y-1 : 0) / (float)imheight;
}
theFS.Close();
 So far, so good. This code works. The current version (using FileStream and BinaryWriter) appears to be equivalent (though slower, because of the copy) to using File.Open with the same options and a BinaryFormatter on the ushort[] being written to disk. But then I add a consumer thread: FileStream theFS;
if (!File.Exists(theFileName)) {
    //do error handling
    return;
}
else {
     theFS = new FileStream(theFileName, FileMode.Open, 
        FileAccess.Read, FileShare.Read);
            //very relaxed file opening
}
BinaryReader theReader = new BinaryReader(theFS);

//gotta do this copying in order to handle byte array swaps
//frustrating, but true.
byte[] theNewArray = theReader.ReadBytes(
   (int)(imheight * imwidth * inBase.Progress) * 2);
ushort[] theData = new ushort[((int)(theNewArray.Length/2))];
Buffer.BlockCopy(theNewArray, 0, theData, 0, theNewArray.Length);
 Now, it's possible that the declaration of theNewArray is broken, and will cause some kind of read overflow. However, this code never gets that far, because it always always always breaks on trying to open the new FileStream with a System.IO.IOException that states that another process has opened the file. I'm setting the FileAccess and FileShare enumerations as stated in the FileStream documentation on MSDN, but it appears that I just can't do what I want to do (ie, write in one thread, read in another). I realize that this application is a bit unorthodox, but when I get the actual device involved, I'm going to have to do the same thing, but using MFC. In any event, What am I forgetting? Is what I'm wanting to do possible, since it's specified as possible in the documentation? Thanks! mmr

@TITLE:IPA created via Xcode bot fails to run for APNS but runs if built manually via Xcode itself or built as an archive by Xcode
@CONTENT:I have a CI build machine running Xcode server and using a bot to generate a build, however the .ipa built via the bot is not being entitled to register for the APNS token. Specifically, didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError gets called and there is a runtime warning of ""No valid 'aps-environment' entitlement string found for application". However if I build the app on a separte development PC, or I build it actually on the CI machine independently of the bot then everything is fine. I've used push notifications extensively in several apps so know that the message "No valid 'aps-environment' entitlement string found for application" always appears if the app has not been signed with the correct profiles. However I have absolutely 100% confirmed that the app is being built with the same profiles when running as part of the bot build to when I build it manually. I also know that Xcode downloads provisioning profiles to different locations when running under the bot to when running for a user, and I also know that the bot runs as system and not the logged in user when I build manually. I have taken all these differences into consideration but am still unable to get the bot build to work. What's more I have used this exact same CI machine to previously build this app using Jenkins (which also ran as system) enabled for push and it worked! These is what I have done/checked: 1) Download the project manually to the desktop, open in Xcode and examine the signing identity and provisioning profiles being sued in the build settings. Build and run it manually using Xcode -> it works Download the project indirectly via the bot as part of its integration run. Open the project downloaded by the Bot in Xcode (the Xcode server downloads it to: /Library/Server/Xcode/Data/BotRuns//Cache/NNNN). Do the same thing, check the signing identity and provisioning profiles. THEY ARE IDENTICAL to those used when I build on the desktop OK so the problem is not due to a difference in the actual signing identity and provisioning profiles being used. 2) When you run Xcode manually it downloads the provisioning profiles to location X, but the Bot downloads the provisioning profiles to location Y. So I have examined the contents of X and Y to make sure there is nothing missing from Y (if there was the build would actually fail however, which it doesn't). To make absolutely sure they are identical I have copied the entire contents of X into Y and run the bot again (they don't get overriden by the bot) - So now the bot and the desktop builds are using the exact same copies of the profiles yet still there is a difference when the .ipa executes. Incidentally the location of X is ~/Library/MobileDevice/Provisioning Profiles and that of Y is / Library/Server/Xcode/Data/ProvisioningProfiles. 3) When I build manually it is as the logged in user, but when the bot build it is as the system. So within the keychain I have tried copying all the certificates and keys from the user's keychain into the system keychain. Yes still it makes no difference, the .ipa created by the build bot fails to run properly while the build created manually via Xcode does run. This is driving me mad and has wasted days already, what else could I have missed or could try to resolve this? Any suggestions or ideas?

        });
    });
 My root issue is when I click on link with "#/topics/slug-name?section=section-1", state is reloaded completely, which in turn re-requests data for Topic. How can one just "refresh" query parameters (and catch that event in controller) but don't reload state (to keep data loaded)? EDIT For my issue there is a rather simple solution which I've failed to notice - per AngularJS documentation on "Hashbang and HTML5 Modes" - last hash is accessible via $location.hash() and scrolling can be initiated by $anchorScroll() So my current solution is: In controller: $scope.$watch('$location.hash', function () {
    _.defer($anchorScroll);
});
 Defer is needed because content may not be parsed yet and there are no id's. In template I just had to set target to "#/topics/slug-name#section-name".

@TITLE:Network Activity Monitoring on iPhone
@CONTENT:I've been working for 5 days trying to learn and implement Network monitor on the iPhone. I looked into netstat code from apple, and i lost like 25% of my hair. I found links for JB Devices but i need it to execute on a non JB device. (Irrespective of whether Apple accepts it on the App store or not). I found some useful links : how to get tcp udp opening port list on iPhone (I couldn't parse the data returned in this question :( ) Data Usage on iPhone sysctlbyname buf return type (I'm not a networking guy..could not understand this one, may be you guys can help :) ) TCP/UPD port list I can say i got some thing from the first link. Can you guys help me to Parse the data ? Is there any other method to achieve this??

@TITLE:Detecting when system buttons are visible while using 'immersive mode'
@CONTENT:I'm currently using immersive mode (API 19) for one of my Activities as follows: getWindow().getDecorView()
            .setSystemUiVisibility(
                    View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_STABLE
                            | View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_HIDE_NAVIGATION
                            | View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_FULLSCREEN
                            | View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_HIDE_NAVIGATION

                            | View.INVISIBLE);
 This hides the system buttons and notification bar until the user swipes for them back. This works fine, however I wish to detect when the user makes the buttons visible again. I've tried a OnSystemUiVisibilityChangeListener but it does not trigger for this particular event. Any ideas?

@TITLE:Best Way: Save & Restore TextView Position in ScrollView
@CONTENT:What i want is, upon the device changes orientation, the top line on the screen when in Portrait remains the top line on screen in Landscape. And vice versa. As the width of the screen is likely to be different between Portrait and Landscape, the line width of the text, which means also the width of the TextView and the ScrollView, will vary. Thus, the line-wrap will be different in different screen configurations (Portrait vs. Landscape, large vs. small). The line-break will be at different position in different cases. There are three not-so-perfect solutions for your reference. Also explained the shortcomings of them. Firstly, The very most basic approach: (1) By just storing the y-offset in pixel Please take a look at: http://eliasbland.wordpress.com/2011/07/28/how-to-save-the-position-of-a-scrollview-when-the-orientation-changes-in-android/ Why this is not-so-perfect: In Portrait, lines are wrapped.

Line_2_Word_A Line_2_Word_B Line_2_Word_C Line_2_Word_D
Line_3_Word_A Line_3_Word_B Line_3_Word_C Line_3_Word_D
 Imagine reading Line_2_Word_A (at screen top) in Portrait while saving. When changed to Landscape, it will be showing Line_3_Word_A (at screen top). (Because of two-lines-offset-in-pixel from top.) Then i come up with an approach, (2) By saving the scroll-percentage @Override
protected void onSaveInstanceState(Bundle outState) {
    super.onSaveInstanceState(outState);
    final ScrollView scrollView = (ScrollView) findViewById(R.id.Trial_C_ScrollViewContainer);
    outState.putFloatArray(ScrollViewContainerScrollPercentage,
            new float[]{
            (float) scrollView.getScrollX()/scrollView.getChildAt(0).getWidth(),
            (float) scrollView.getScrollY()/scrollView.getChildAt(0).getHeight() });
}
@Override
protected void onRestoreInstanceState(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onRestoreInstanceState(savedInstanceState);
    final float[] scrollPercentage = savedInstanceState.getFloatArray(ScrollViewContainerScrollPercentage);
    final ScrollView scrollView = (ScrollView) findViewById(R.id.Trial_C_ScrollViewContainer);
    scrollView.post(new Runnable() {
        public void run() {
            scrollView.scrollTo(
                    Math.round(scrollPercentage[0]*scrollView.getChildAt(0).getWidth()),
                    Math.round(scrollPercentage[1]*scrollView.getChildAt(0).getHeight()));
        }
    });
}
 This works perfectly if and only if the length of every line is the same. Why this is not-so-perfect: In Portrait, lines are wrapped. Line_1_Word_A Line_1_Word_B
Line_1_Word_C Line_1_Word_D
Line_1_Word_E Line_1_Word_F

Line_3_Word_A
Line_4_Word_A
 In Landscape, lines are not wrapped. Line_1_Word_A Line_1_Word_B Line_1_Word_C Line_1_Word_D Line_1_Word_E Line_1_Word_F
Line_2_Word_A
Line_3_Word_A
Line_4_Word_A
 Imagine reading Line_2_Word_A (at screen top) in Portrait while saving. When changed to Landscape, it will be showing Line_3_Word_A (at screen top). (Because it is scrolled by 50%.) Then i found this approach which indeed (3) Storing the first visible line Please take a look at (first answer): How to restore textview scrolling position after screen rotation?

Line_4_Word_A
 Imagine reading Line_1_Word_E (at screen top) in Portrait while saving. When changed to Landscape, it will be showing Line_3_Word_A (at screen top). (Because it is the third line.) A perfect one would be, in Landscape, showing Line_1_Word_A (as well as Line_1_Word_E) at screen top. Could you please suggest a perfect approach? Edit: After a few thoughts, is method (3) identical to method (1) in fact? :-/ Edit 2: Well, i have just come up with another not-so-perfect-yet-more-perfect approach than the above three: (4) Paragraph-based storing Separating paragraphs (or blocks of texts) into different TextView objects. Then by the codes like method (3), or in any other ways, it is not hard to detect which paragraph (or block), i.e. which TextView object, is currently at the top of the screen. Then restore and scroll down to that paragraph (or block). Bingo! As i said, it is not-so-perfect. But at least the users can get back to that paragraph (or block) that he/she was reading. He/She just have to peek down a bit to find that particular line. (Or it might be even better to remind readers with a few previous lines, i.e. reading from the start of the paragraph.) i know it might be terribly bad if we have a long long long paragraph :-/ Well, we can actually "improve" this method. Make it down to word-level, a word a TextView. So it is logically "perfect". But, i guess, it is not a wise choice. P.S. bathroom is always the best place for brainstorming (-: i am still looking for your perfect answer!!

@TITLE:Youtube API Limitations
@CONTENT:I'm building a pretty large app for a client, and had some questions about heavy API usage. Basically this app is going to aggregate feeds from various sources. My client estimates around 900 follow-able users will be in this system to start out, with more being added over time. He wants to update the feed data every 15 minutes, so we would need to update one user feed per second, assuming 900 feeds and a 15 minute TTL. As the requests take a few seconds to complete, we would then need to load balance across a few threads to tackle the queue asynchronously. My question is, should I be worried about quota errors or hitting any kind of limitations? If so, what are our options? I've already read their help pages and documentation, and it's very vague and not really helpful. I need concrete numbers. It's not feasible to load test their API to figure out the limitation. The matter is not helped by Google deferring all support to a non-official channel such as StackOverflow where people do not have knowledge of the Youtube internals. Thanks in advance...

@TITLE:How do browsers deal with non-integer values for height and width?
@CONTENT:When browsers are given widths and heights for elements that aren't integer values, how do they deal with them? In particular, At what stage do non-integer values get rounded? Do they round to the nearest integer, or truncate them? When a container's children have non-integer dimensions, will there ever be instances where the sum of the child lengths or heights not equal the inner width / height of the parent element? Do provided non-integer dimensions get handled differently to non-integer results of percentage-based dimensions? What about non-whole values for padding and margins? Edit: Is it the browsers that perform this rounding, or is it the OS? If it's the OS, does that create conditions where the browser 'thinks' items are larger than their painted area, and does that create issues with the sizing of parent containers?

@TITLE:Using C/Intel assembly, what is the fastest way to test if a 128-byte memory block contains all zeros?
@CONTENT:Continuing on from my first question, I am trying to optimize a memory hotspot found via VTune profiling a 64-bit C program. In particular, I'd like to find the fastest way to test if a 128-byte block of memory contains all zeros. You may assume any desired memory alignment for the memory block; I used 64-byte alignment. I am using a PC with an Intel Ivy Bridge Core i7 3770 processor with 32 GB of memory and the free version of Microsoft vs2010 C compiler. My first attempt was: const char* bytevecM;    // 4 GB block of memory, 64-byte aligned
size_t* psz;             // size_t is 64-bits
// ...
// "m7 & 0xffffff80" selects the 128 byte block to test for all zeros
psz = (size_t*)&bytevecM[(unsigned int)m7 & 0xffffff80];
if (psz[0]  == 0 && psz[1]  == 0
&&  psz[2]  == 0 && psz[3]  == 0
&&  psz[4]  == 0 && psz[5]  == 0
&&  psz[6]  == 0 && psz[7]  == 0
&&  psz[8]  == 0 && psz[9]  == 0
&&  psz[10] == 0 && psz[11] == 0
&&  psz[12] == 0 && psz[13] == 0
&&  psz[14] == 0 && psz[15] == 0) continue;
// ...

 As you can see, there are fewer assembly instructions and this version further proved to be faster in timing tests. Since I am quite weak in the area of Intel SSE/AVX instructions, I welcome advice on how they might be better employed to speed up this code. Though I scoured the hundreds of available instrinsics, I may have missed the ideal ones. In particular, I was unable to effectively employ _mm_cmpeq_epi64(); I looked for a "not equal" version of this instrinsic (which seems better suited to this problem) but came up dry. Though the below code "works": if (_mm_testz_si128(_mm_andnot_si128(_mm_cmpeq_epi64(psz[7], _mm_andnot_si128(_mm_cmpeq_epi64(psz[6], _mm_andnot_si128(_mm_cmpeq_epi64(psz[5], _mm_andnot_si128(_mm_cmpeq_epi64(psz[4], _mm_andnot_si128(_mm_cmpeq_epi64(psz[3], _mm_andnot_si128(_mm_cmpeq_epi64(psz[2], _mm_andnot_si128(_mm_cmpeq_epi64(psz[1], _mm_andnot_si128(_mm_cmpeq_epi64(psz[0], zero), one)), one)), one)), one)), one)), one)), one)), one), one)) continue;
 it is borderline unreadable and (unsurprisingly) proved to be way slower than the two versions given above. I feel sure there must be a more elegant way to employ _mm_cmpeq_epi64() and welcome advice on how that might be achieved. In addition to using intrinsics from C, raw Intel assembly language solutions to this problem are also welcome.

@TITLE:Node.js connect only works on localhost
@CONTENT:I've written a small node.js app, using Connect, that serves up a web page, then sends it regular updates. It also accepts and logs user observations to a disk file. It works fine as long as I am on localhost, but I can't get other commputers on the same intranet to see it. I am using port 3000, but changing to port 8080 or 80 didn't help. Here is the code I am using to set up the connection:     
var io = require('socket.io'),
  connect = require('connect');

var app = connect().use(connect.static('public')).listen(3000);
var chat_room = io.listen(app);
 As stated above, I've tried changing the port number to 8080 or to 80, and didn't see any difference, so I don't think that it is a firewall problem (but I could be wrong). I've also thought about, after reading similar questions dealing with HTTP, to add 0.0.0.0 to the listen() but it doesn't seem that listen() takes an IP mask parameter.
@CODE:var io = require('socket.io'),
  connect = require('connect');

var app = connect().use(connect.static('public')).listen(3000);
var chat_room = io.listen(app); listen() http.Server#listen

 I used a program to take snapshots from the current process in MySQL. Other queries were executed at the same time, but when I change it to just one SELECT statement, it NEVER goes over one second. Maybe I have something else that's going on; I'm asking 'cause I'm not so into DBs... Update 3: The explain statement The Entity Framework generated '1', 'PRIMARY', '<derived2>', 'ALL', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '46', 'Using filesort'

 This is from my QA environment, so the timing I pasted above is not related to the rowcount explain statements. I think that there are about 500,000 records that match one server ID. Solution I switched from MySQL to SQL Server. I don't want to end up completely rewriting the application layer.

@TITLE:GCM msg delivery times are WILDLY erratic
@CONTENT:I've setup an Android app with GCM support, and have a little test app to send a msg to the app. When I run the App in the emulator, I can see (via logging msgs) that it registers with GCM and gets a Token. Then when I put the token in my test app and have it send a msg, the result shows that 1 msg was sent, 0 failed, and 0 had ID changes. Sometimes the msg shows up almost immediately, sometimes it takes 20 minutes. On Friday, my 2 test msgs took 15 and 20 minutes. The first 2 I sent this morning were immediately, the next one hasn't shown up yet - it's only been 10 minutes... Is there anything I can do to make the delivery times consistently fast? A random 20 minute delay will be pretty much an unacceptable condition.

                 } completion:nil];
 But when it runs the views jump half the transform in the opposite direction before sliding to half a position in the correct direction. I've slowed down the animation duration to 5 seconds but the initial jump is instantaneous and half the transformation in the wrong direction. When I animate back using this code... [UIView animateWithDuration:0.2

                 } completion:nil];
 It does exactly the same thing. The result is that the final movement is half the desired transform as it jumps half the transform in the wrong direction first. I really can't work out why this is happening? Any ideas. ::EDIT:: Clearing up some possible ambiguity. I'm not trying to have these views "bounce" back to where they are. The views I'm animating are like control panel at the edge of the screen. When the user presses "go" the view then slide out of the way. When the user presses "stop" the panels slide back into the view. At least they used to. Since enabling auto layout (which I need for other parts of the app) I can't just change the frame of the views so I went the the transform route. You can see this effect by sticking a view into a view controller and a button to run the animation. Thanks

I'm creating an app for use on many different subdomains (actually chained subdomains like http://clientname.projectname.mydomain.com) that allows users to login through facebook (via js), and then retrieves their data (both through js and php). How do you setup your facebook app so it supports multiple subdomains?

@TITLE:Concurrent reading of a File (java preffered) [closed]
@CONTENT:I have a large File that takes multiple hours to process. So I am thinking of trying to estimate chunks and read the chunks in parallel. is it possible to to concurrent read on a single File? I have looked at both RandomAccessFile as well as nio.FileChannel but based on other posts am not sure if this approach would work. suggestion!!

@TITLE:How can I remove silence from an MP3 programmatically?
@CONTENT:I have MP3 files that sometimes have silence at the end. I would like to remove this silence automatically. From what I can tell, it is "perfect" silence (0 amplitude), not background noise. The length of the content and the silence varies. I found some other questions about cropping to the first 30 seconds or cropping to X and X+N seconds using ffmpeg. I would think I could use a similar approach, as long as I have a way to find when the silence starts. How would I do that programatically? For example, one possible solution would be to have a command that finds the beginning of the "silence". I'd expect a sequence like this end=$(ffmpeg some-command-to-find-start-of-silence)
ffmpeg -t "$end" -acodec copy -i inputfile.mp3 outputfile.mp3
 The solution does not have to use ffmpeg, but it does need to be available on Ubuntu.

@LINK:/questions/11687281/transformation-between-two-set-of-points
@TITLE:Transformation between two set of points
@CONTENT:I have object let's say on model image. I want to compute transformation (displacement, scale, rotation) between object on model image and object on target image. I want to make assumption that object's can be treated as 2D so only 2D transformations should be computed. First I want to to it in manually assisted way. The user selects base point on model image and then target point on target image. The number of points should be defined by user (but no less than some minimum 2-3 points). When points gives different information, the transformation should be averaged and for example from this the quality of matching can be computed. So the questions is rather about computing transformation of two sets of points, but as I want to do it on image I've added image processing tag. Especially welcomed are references and advices with some pieces of code or pseudocode. With two points it's very easy issue, only rotation, scale and displacement of line should be taken, but how to do it with more points, and with averaging it and computing some quality factors. Current solution is: void transformFnc(std::vector<PointF> basePoints, std::vector<PointF> targetPoints,
                  PointF& offset, double rotation, double scale)
{
    std::vector<Line> basePointsLines;
    std::vector<Line> targetPointsLines;
    assert(basePoints.size() == targetPoints.size());
    int pointsNumber = basePoints.size();

    for(int i = 0; i < pointsNumber; i++)
    {
         for(int j = i + 1; j < pointsNumber; j++)
         {
             basePointsLines.push_back(Line(basePoints[i], basePoints[j]));
             targetPointsLines.push_back(Line(targetPoints[i], targetPoints[j]));
         }
    }
    std::vector<double> scalesVector;
    std::vector<double> rotationsVector;
    double baseCenterX = 0, baseCenterY = 0, targetCenterX = 0, targetCenterY = 0;
    for(std::vector<Line>::iterator it = basePointsLines.begin(), i = targetPointsLines.begin();
        it != basePointsLines.end(), i != targetPointsLines.end(); it++, i++)
    {
        scalesVector.push_back((*i).length()/(*it).length());
        baseCenterX += (*it).pointAt(0.5).x(); 
        baseCenterY += (*it).pointAt(0.5).y();
        targetCenterX += (*i).pointAt(0.5).x();
        targetCenterY += (*i).pointAt(0.5).y();
        double rotation;
        rotation = (*i).angleTo((*it));
        rotationsVector.push_back(rotation);
    }
    baseCenterX = baseCenterX / pointsNumber;
    baseCenterY = baseCenterY / pointsNumber;
    targetCenterX = targetCenterX / pointsNumber;
    targetCenterY = targetCenterY / pointsNumber;

    offset = PointF(targetCenterX - baseCenterX, targetCenterY - baseCenterY);
    scale = sum(scalesVector) / scalesVector.size();
    rotation = sum(rotationsVector) / rotationsVector.size();
}
 Only optimization I can find in this code is to eliminate from scales and rotations those values which differs too much from the rest. I'm looking for codes or pseudocodes of solution propositions. It can also be references to some codes. So far from answers I know that: RANSAC algorithm can be used I need to look for some affine transform computing algorithm in the least square sense
@CODE:void transformFnc(std::vector<PointF> basePoints, std::vector<PointF> targetPoints,
                  PointF& offset, double rotation, double scale)
{
    std::vector<Line> basePointsLines;
    std::vector<Line> targetPointsLines;
    assert(basePoints.size() == targetPoints.size());
    int pointsNumber = basePoints.size();

    for(int i = 0; i < pointsNumber; i++)
    {
         for(int j = i + 1; j < pointsNumber; j++)
         {
             basePointsLines.push_back(Line(basePoints[i], basePoints[j]));
             targetPointsLines.push_back(Line(targetPoints[i], targetPoints[j]));
         }
    }
    std::vector<double> scalesVector;
    std::vector<double> rotationsVector;
    double baseCenterX = 0, baseCenterY = 0, targetCenterX = 0, targetCenterY = 0;
    for(std::vector<Line>::iterator it = basePointsLines.begin(), i = targetPointsLines.begin();
        it != basePointsLines.end(), i != targetPointsLines.end(); it++, i++)
    {
        scalesVector.push_back((*i).length()/(*it).length());
        baseCenterX += (*it).pointAt(0.5).x(); 
        baseCenterY += (*it).pointAt(0.5).y();
        targetCenterX += (*i).pointAt(0.5).x();
        targetCenterY += (*i).pointAt(0.5).y();
        double rotation;
        rotation = (*i).angleTo((*it));
        rotationsVector.push_back(rotation);
    }
    baseCenterX = baseCenterX / pointsNumber;
    baseCenterY = baseCenterY / pointsNumber;
    targetCenterX = targetCenterX / pointsNumber;
    targetCenterY = targetCenterY / pointsNumber;

@LINK:/questions/11377629/c-constructors-why-is-this-virtual-function-call-not-safe
@TITLE:C++ constructors: why is this virtual function call not safe?
@CONTENT:This is from the C++11 standard sec 12.7.4. This is rather confusing. What does the last sentence in the text mean exactly? Why is the last method call in B::B undefined? Shoudn't it just call a.A::f? 4 Member functions, including virtual functions (10.3), can be called during construction or destruction (12.6.2). When a virtual function is called directly or indirectly from a constructor or from a destructor, including during the construction or destruction of the class¡¦s non-static data members, and the object to which the call applies is the object (call it x) under construction or destruction, the function called is the final overrider in the constructor¡¦s or destructor¡¦s class and not one overriding it in a more-derived class. If the virtual function call uses an explicit class member access (5.2.5) and the object expression refers to the complete object of x or one of that object¡¦s base class subobjects but not x or one of its base class subobjects, the behavior is undefined. [ Example: struct V {
 virtual void f();
 virtual void g();
};

struct A : virtual V {
 virtual void f();
};

struct B : virtual V {
 virtual void g();
 B(V*, A*);
};

struct D : A, B {
 virtual void f();
 virtual void g();
 D() : B((A*)this, this) { }
};

B::B(V* v, A* a) {
 f(); // calls V::f, not A::f
 g(); // calls B::g, not D::g
 v->g(); // v is base of B, the call is well-defined, calls B::g
 a->f(); // undefined behavior, a¡¦s type not a base of B
}
 ¡Xend example ]
@CODE:B::B a.A::f struct V {
 virtual void f();
 virtual void g();
};

struct A : virtual V {
 virtual void f();
};

struct B : virtual V {
 virtual void g();
 B(V*, A*);
};

struct D : A, B {
 virtual void f();
 virtual void g();
 D() : B((A*)this, this) { }
};

B::B(V* v, A* a) {
 f(); // calls V::f, not A::f
 g(); // calls B::g, not D::g
 v->g(); // v is base of B, the call is well-defined, calls B::g

@TITLE:JQuery & history.js back button not working
@CONTENT:I'm using history.JS (latest) with Jquery (latest) to load and replace just a portion of a website, this is all working, currently I'm only trying to get it working in modern browsers so I'm not fiddling with the hash changes. Everything seems to work, however when I click the back button on the browser (latest FF & Chrome) the page does not change (although the url and title do change). I've had a google and a look on here but I can't see what is happening. Looking on stack overflow I found this page: Do not understand History.js which seems to be asking a similar question. I've add the loaded contents of the #left_col (which is the div being replaced) to the state data, but I'm not really sure where to go from there, I know I need to reload that data when the state changes, but I can't see how. var History = window.History; 
var origTitle = document.title;
if ( !History.enabled ) {
    return false;
}

History.Adapter.bind(window,'statechange',function(){ 
    var State = History.getState();     
    History.log(State.data, State.title, State.url);
});

$('.ajaxload').live("click", function() {
    History.pushState({state:1,leftcol:$('#left_col').html()}, origTitle, $(this).attr("href"));
    $('#left_col').load($(this).attr("rel"));
    return false;
});
 I'd really appreciate any help! update: I managed to get the page to change on the user clicking back, but it doesn't load the right state (it seems to go two states back rather than one), the code I've added to the above code is: window.addEventListener('popstate', function(event) {
    var State = History.getState(); 
    $('#left_col').html(State.data.leftcol);
});
@CODE:var History = window.History; 
var origTitle = document.title;
if ( !History.enabled ) {
    return false;
}

@TITLE:CurrentCulture incorrectly defaulting to en-US in ASP.net
@CONTENT:I have just migrated around 100 ASP.net sites from IIS 6 on Windows Sever 2003 to IIS 7 on Windows 2008. I've just noticed that various pieces of code that use things like DateTime.Parse have started kicking up errors "String was not recognized as a valid DateTime". I've tracked this down to the fact that the CurrentCulture of the sites is defaulting to 'en-US' and so my UK users are inputting dates in an unexpected format. Question is, where are they getting en-US from? Starting from the top, if I look in 'Control Panel > Region and Language' everything is set to English (United Kingdom). The web.configs of the sites either don't have a <globalization> section or have it set as <globalization culture="auto" uiCulture="auto" />. In 'IIS7 - .Net Globalization' all of the sites have their culture set to 'Invariant Language (Invariant Country)'. I can't find anywhere that's settings the culture to 'en-US'... but something is. Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture.Name is outputting 'en-US'
Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture.NumberFormat.CurrencySymbol is outputting '$'
 I can fix the issue by adding <globalization culture="en-GB" uiCulture="en-GB" /> to every web.config BUT I really don't want to have to hand edit about 100 web.configs! I wan't it to inherit the culture from the server OS settings, which are set to en-GB. Am I missing something? Thanks.

@TITLE:Fragments Not Working Correctly After Orientation Change
@CONTENT:I am having a problem with Fragments and orientation change. I have an application which has a MainActivity which handles the switching up Fragments via a tabbed action bar. Here is the code for the tabbed action bar and when a tab is selected. private class MyTabListener <T extends android.support.v4.app.Fragment> implements ActionBar.TabListener {
    private android.support.v4.app.Fragment mFragment;
    private final Activity mActivity;
    private final String mTag;
    private final Class<T> mClass;

    public MyTabListener(SherlockFragmentActivity activity, String tag, Class<T> clz) {
        mActivity = activity;
        mTag = tag;
        mClass = clz;
    }

    @Override
    public void onTabSelected(Tab tab, android.support.v4.app.FragmentTransaction ft) {
        if (mFragment == null){ // check to see if the fragment has already been initialised. If not create a new one.
            mFragment = android.support.v4.app.Fragment.instantiate(mActivity, mClass.getName());
            ft.add(android.R.id.content,mFragment,mTag);
        } else {
            ft.attach(mFragment); // if the fragment has been initialised attach it to the current activity
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void onTabUnselected(Tab tab, android.support.v4.app.FragmentTransaction ft) {
        if (mFragment != null){
            ft.detach(mFragment); // when a fragment is no longer needed, detach it from the activity but dont destroy it
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void onTabReselected(Tab tab, android.support.v4.app.FragmentTransaction ft) {

    }
 The way I see it is that everything works fine when the application first loads in portrait mode. When I rotate, for some reason another instance of Fragment1 is added and then isn't detached when another tab is selected. This is also the case when I then rotate back to portrait. I have tried using setRetainInstance(true); in my Fragments but this doesn't work. Is there a method I need to override or do something with my Fragments before rotating? Thanks in advance. EDIT I have now seen that onTabSelected is called again when the activity is recreated. Could this be the cause of my problem with fragments being attached more than once? Here is my activities onCreate method. super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

        if (savedInstanceState == null) {
           //setContentView(R.layout.main);

        }

@LINK:/questions/10693913/c11-anonymous-union-with-non-trivial-members
@TITLE:C++11 anonymous union with non-trivial members
@CONTENT:I'm updating a struct of mine and I was wanting to add a std::string member to it. The original struct looks like this: struct Value {
  uint64_t lastUpdated;

  union {
    uint64_t ui;
    int64_t i;
    float f;
    bool b;
  };
};
 Just adding a std::string member to the union, of course, causes a compile error, because one would normally need to add the non-trivial constructors of the object. In the case of std::string (text from informit.com) Since std::string defines all of the six special member functions, U will have an implicitly deleted default constructor, copy constructor, copy assignment operator, move constructor, move assignment operator and destructor. Effectively, this means that you can't create instances of U unless you define some, or all of the special member functions explicitly. Then the website goes on to give the following sample code: union U
{
int a;
int b;
string s;
U();
~U();
};
 However, I'm using an anonymous union within a struct. I asked ##C++ on freenode and they told me the correct way to do that was to put the constructor in the struct instead and gave me this example code: #include <new>

struct Point  {
    Point() {}
    Point(int x, int y): x_(x), y_(y) {}
    int x_, y_;
};

struct Foo
{
  Foo() { new(&p) Point(); }
  union {
    int z;
    double w;
    Point p;
  };
};

int main(void)
{
}
 But from there I can't figure how to make the rest of the special functions that std::string needs defined, and moreover, I'm not entirely clear on how the ctor in that example is working. Can I get someone to explain this to me a bit clearer?
@CODE:struct Value {
  uint64_t lastUpdated;

  union {
    uint64_t ui;
    int64_t i;
    float f;
    bool b;
  };
}; union U
{
int a;
int b;
string s;
U();
~U();
}; #include <new>

struct Point  {
    Point() {}
    Point(int x, int y): x_(x), y_(y) {}
    int x_, y_;
};

struct Foo
{
  Foo() { new(&p) Point(); }
  union {
    int z;
    double w;
    Point p;
  };
};

int main(void)
{

The names are all different (very different in some cases) but they all are the same person/document. Person 1: David Bowie, David Robert Jones, Ziggy Stardust, Thin White Duke Person 2: David Letterman Person 3: David Hasselhoff, David Michael Hasselhoff If I were to search for "David" I'd like for all of these to have about the same chance of a match. If each name is scored independently that would seem to be the case. If they are just stored and searched as a single field, David Bowie would be punished for having many more tokens than the others. How does Solr handle this scenario?

@CONTENT:In C++11 we can define copy and move constructors, but are both allowed on the same class? If so, how do you disambiguate their usage? For example: Foo MoveAFoo() {
  Foo f;
  return f;
}
 Is the above a copy? A move? How do I know?
@CODE:Foo MoveAFoo() {
  Foo f;

@TITLE:Setting a color based on theme
@CONTENT:I have an accent color that I use through out my layouts. I have it defined as a style that I apply to a TextView. My application lets the user choose between a dark theme and a light theme. I would like to tweak the accent color based on the selected theme. You can't define a color in a theme You can't define a state list color based on theme You can't separate resources based on theme (as you can for version or screen size) You can't update the resource color from code (??? not 100% on this ???) How should I control my accent color based on the selected theme? The dev guide gives an example of a theme using a custom color, which is close to what I want. I need to be able to change the color at runtime. I know I could go into my code and the X places where this style is being used I could ferrit out the component and set the color that way. But I would think I could accomplish this with some combination of style/theme. Thanks

@CONTENT:given some source file test.cpp I would like to create a shared library libtest.so . I am trying to do this within the scope of an automake file however I cannot seem to get this to work. For example under g++ I do the following: g++ -shared -fPIC test.cpp -o libtest.so
 then i can create another file that will depend on the shared library as follows: g++ mytest.cpp libtest.so -o blah
 I have read that automake only supports making shared libraries via libtool. I have tried to get my automake scriupt to work as follows but it never seems to produce an .so . The closest i have gotten is for it to produce an .la and .o file: in configure.ac: AC_ENABLE_SHARED
AC_DISABLE_STATIC

@TITLE:Deserializing local NSString of JSON into objects via RestKit (no network download)
@CONTENT:Is it possible to deserialize an NSString of JSON into objects via RestKit? I checked the API list here and could not find something that would serve for this purpose. The closest I could find are the various parser classes that return NSDictionary after parsing the input. I assume RestKit uses these parsers after downloading the response so my thinking is that the functionality is available somewhere in RestKit but not exposed publicly. If I am not missing anything and this functionality is not exposed, what would be the alternatives? Two obvious ones do not look very promising: Get the resulting NSDictionary and try to deserialize myself (effectively reimplementing RestKit) or try to dive into RestKit source and see if this can be somehow exposed (looks tedious and error prone). Thanks in advance for any help. PS: The idea is that a string property on a deserialized object is actually the JSON representation of another set of objects (embedded JSON in a sense) and it is deserialized on demand during runtime.

@TITLE:Collision Detection with MANY objects
@CONTENT:I mainly focused on the Graphics aspects to create a little 2DGame. I've watched/looked at several tutorials but none of them were that pleasing. I already have a player(a square) moving and colliding with other squares on the screen. Gravity etc. Are also done. If there are only that much objects as seen on the screen (30*20), everything works perfectly fine. But if I increase it to let's say 300*300 the program starts to run very slow since it has to check for so many objects. I really don't get how games like Minecraft can work with ALL THOSE blocks and my program already gives up on 300*300 blocks. I already tried to ONLY check for collisions when the objects are visible, but that leads to the program checking every single object for it's visibility leading to the same problem. What am I doing wrong? Help appreciated. I'll post some code on how I handle the collisions. player.collision(player, wall);

@TITLE:SQL Database Design Best Practice (Addresses)
@CONTENT:Of course I realize that there's no one "right way" to design a SQL database, but I wanted to get some opinions on what is better or worse in my particular scenario. Currently, I'm designing an order entry module (Windows .NET 4.0 application with SQL Server 2008) and I'm torn between two design decisions when it comes to data that can be applied in more than one spot. In this question I'll refer specifically to Addresses. Addresses can be used by a variety of objects (orders, customers, employees, shipments, etc..) and they almost always contain the same data (Address1/2/3, City, State, Postal Code, Country, etc). I was originally going to include each of these fields as a column in each of the related tables (e.g. Orders will contain Address1/2/3, City, State, etc.. and Customers will also contain this same column layout). But a part of me wants to apply DRY/Normalization principles to this scenario, i.e. have a table called "Addresses" which is referenced via Foreign Key in the appropriate table.

 From a design standpoint I like this approach because it creates a standard address format that is easily changeable, i.e. if I ever needed to add Address4 I would just add it in one place rather than to every table. However, I can see the number of JOINs required to build queries might get a little insane. I guess I'm just wondering if any enterprise-level SQL architects out there have ever used this approach successfully, or if the number of JOINs that this creates would create a performance issue?

@TITLE:Is there a good way to do this type of mining?
@CONTENT:I am trying to find points that are closest in space in X and Y directions (sample dataset given at the end) and am looking to see if there are smarter approaches to do this than my trivial (and untested) approach. The plot of these points in space looks something like the following and am trying to find sets of points marked inside the boxes i.e. the output I am looking for is a set of groups: Group 1: (1,23), (2,23), (3,23)...
Group 2: (68,200), (68,201), (68,203), (68,204), (68,100), (68,101), (68,101)...
 For the horizontal bands, I am thinking I could just go ahead and use small sliding windows of size say, 5 or 10 (which should really be determined from the global information of which size will give the maximum grouped points but I am still exploring a good approach) and search for contiguous points because a break would not be considered a horizontal band anymore. I am guessing the same approach works for the vertical bands as well but not in all cases because there is a subtle difference in horizontal and vertical bands: points should appear close to be considered a group horizontally but they can appear anywhere to be considered part of a vertical band. Observe the large vertical band in the figure. So I am guessing I could just look for points that have the same x-coordinate (in this case, x=68) should give me a lot of points. Other than this trivial solution, I can't think of anything smart that can be done here as this problem appears deceptively simple to me. Am I missing something here? Does this fall into some known class of problems and if so, is there a good and scalable approach to achieve this? Sample Dataset: 1,23

@TITLE:Unique log file for each instance of class
@CONTENT:I am currently running a windows service that creates multiple instances of a class. At the top of the service class and every other class in my solution, I have something like this: private static readonly ILog _log = LogManager.GetLogger(typeof(SomeClassTypeHere));
 In my App.config, I have Log4Net configured for a single file: <log4net debug="true">
    <appender name="RollingFileAppender" type="log4net.Appender.RollingFileAppender">
      <file value="Logs\SomeLogFileName.xml" />
      <appendToFile value="true" />
      <rollingStyle value="Size" />
      <countDirection value="1" />
      <maxSizeRollBackups value="30" />
      <maximumFileSize value="10MB" />
      <staticLogFileName value="true" />
      <lockingModel type="log4net.Appender.FileAppender+MinimalLock" />
      <layout type="log4net.Layout.XmlLayoutSchemaLog4j">
        <locationInfo value="true" />
      </layout>
    </appender>

    <root>
      <level value="INFO" />
      <appender-ref ref="RollingFileAppender" />
    </root>
  </log4net>
 This works great in most respects, and everything logs to a single file. However, I'd really like to create a separate log file for each instance of a particular class that my service creates. This is a class that we often need to monitor for support and we can have a handful of instances running at the same time. We don't know which instances will be running at a given time, so it makes creating static files in the configuration kinda painful. I tried taking off the readonly modifier and setting the following in the class constructor: _log = LogManager.GetLogger("DataCollectionClass_" + deviceName + "_" + DateTime.Now.ToString("MMddyyyy"), typeof(SomeClassTypeHere));
 But that requires that I define an appender manually in the configuration, which would be cumbersome and tough to keep up with. Any thoughts on doing this in L4N? I have seen links here but don't really know if that much frameworking is necessary.
@CODE:private static readonly ILog _log = LogManager.GetLogger(typeof(SomeClassTypeHere)); <log4net debug="true">
    <appender name="RollingFileAppender" type="log4net.Appender.RollingFileAppender">
      <file value="Logs\SomeLogFileName.xml" />

      <layout type="log4net.Layout.XmlLayoutSchemaLog4j">

@TITLE:mmap, msync and linux process termination
@CONTENT:I want to use mmap to implement persistence of certain portions of program state in a C program running under Linux by associating a fixed-size struct with a well known file name using mmap() with the MAP_SHARED flag set. For performance reasons, I would prefer not to call msync() at all, and no other programs will be accessing this file. When my program terminates and is restarted, it will map the same file again and do some processing on it to recover the state that it was in before the termination. My question is this: if I never call msync() on the file descriptor, will the kernel guarantee that all updates to the memory will get written to disk and be subsequently recoverable even if my process is terminated with SIGKILL? Also, will there be general system overhead from the kernel periodically writing the pages to disk even if my program never calls msync()? EDIT: I've settled the problem of whether the data is written, but I'm still not sure about whether this will cause some unexpected system loading over trying to handle this problem with open()/write()/fsync() and taking the risk that some data might be lost if the process gets hit by KILL/SEGV/ABRT/etc. Added a 'linux-kernel' tag in hopes that some knowledgeable person might chime in.

@TITLE:Cut off text in a div if it exceeds set width?
@CONTENT:On a website I am working on users can add a heading to a section of a page.A simple example: M11-001 - loss of container and goods from Manchester
 With some headings the content can be quite in-depth. In reality, for the heading at least, this content isn't always needed. The first few words would suffice to differentiate between records. I could just set overflow:hidden to the div and ruthlessly cut of anything outside of the set width. I would prefer to add ... To the end. Like so: M11-001 - loss of container...
 So three full-stops would be added after either X width or X characters. Is this possible with CSS, or maybe JavaScript?

@TITLE:Implementing a ¡§variant¡¨ class
@CONTENT:Note: I'm aware of boost::variant, but I am curious about the design principles. This question mostly for self-education. Original post At my current job I found an old variant class implementation. It's implemented with a union and can only support a handful of datatypes. I've been thinking about how one should go about designing an improved version. After some tinkering I ended up with something that seems to work. However I'd like to know your opinion about it. Here it is: #include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <stdexcept>
#include <string>
#include <typeinfo>
#include <boost/shared_ptr.hpp>

class Variant
{
public:
    Variant() { }

    template<class T>
    Variant(T inValue) :
        mImpl(new VariantImpl<T>(inValue)),
        mClassName(typeid(T).name())
    {
    }

    template<class T>
    T getValue() const
    {
        if (typeid(T).name() != mClassName)
        {
            throw std::logic_error("Non-matching types!");
        }

        return dynamic_cast<VariantImpl<T>*>(mImpl.get())->getValue();
    }

    template<class T>
    void setValue(T inValue)
    {
        mImpl.reset(new VariantImpl<T>(inValue));
        mClassName = typeid(T).name();
    }

private:
    struct AbstractVariantImpl
    {
        virtual ~AbstractVariantImpl() {}
    };

    template<class T>
    struct VariantImpl : public AbstractVariantImpl
    {
        VariantImpl(T inValue) : mValue(inValue) { }

        ~VariantImpl() {}

        T getValue() const { return mValue; }

        T mValue;
    };

    boost::shared_ptr<AbstractVariantImpl> mImpl;
    std::string mClassName;
};

int main()
{
    // Store int
    Variant v(10);
    int a = 0;
    a = v.getValue<int>();
    std::cout << "a = " << a << std::endl;

    // Store float
    v.setValue<float>(12.34);
    float d = v.getValue<float>();
    std::cout << "d = " << d << std::endl;

    // Store map<string, string>
    typedef std::map<std::string, std::string> Mapping;
    Mapping m;
    m["one"] = "uno";
    m["two"] = "due";
    m["three"] = "tre";
    v.setValue<Mapping>(m);
    Mapping m2 = v.getValue<Mapping>();
    std::cout << "m2[\"one\"] = " << m2["one"] << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
 Output is correct: a = 10
d = 12.34
m2["one"] = uno
 My SO questions are: Is this implementation correct? Will the dynamic cast in getValue() work as expected (I'm not certain) Should I return T as a const reference instead? Or can I count on return-value-optimization to kick in? Any other problems or suggestions? Update Thanks to @templatetypedef for his suggestions. This updated version only uses dynamic_cast to check if the types match. Type mismatches caused by differences in constness are now avoided thanks to the TypeWrapper classes (which I have shamelessly stolen from the Poco C++ project). So this is the current version. It's likely to contain a few errors though, as I'm not familiar with the idea of modifying const/ref on template templates. I'll have a fresh look tomorrow. template <typename T>

A couple of things to consider: The processes are running on a firewalled Windows 2008 server The processes are running using renamed versions of the JDK java.exe executable As far as I can see the processes are running using the 1.6.0_18 JDK One of the running processes starts an RMI registry I'm waiting on a virtualized copy of the server so I can mess around with it (this is a production server). But in the meanwhile; any ideas as to why I cannot see any of the processes in jvisualvm (or jconsole for that matter)?

@TITLE:How to efficiently de-interleave bits (inverse Morton)
@CONTENT:This question: How to de-interleave bits (UnMortonizing?) has a good answer for extracting one of the two halves of a Morton number (just the odd bits), but I need a solution which extracts both parts (the odd bits and the even bits) in as few operations as possible. For my use I would need to take a 32 bit int and extract two 16 bit ints, where one is the even bits and the other is the odd bits shifted right by 1 bit, e.g. input,  z: 11101101 01010111 11011011 01101110

output, x: 11100001 10110111 // odd bits shifted right by 1
        y: 10111111 11011010 // even bits
 There seem to be plenty of solutions using shifts and masks with magic numbers for generating Morton numbers (i.e. interleaving bits), e.g. Interleave bits by Binary Magic Numbers, but I haven't yet found anything for doing the reverse (i.e. de-interleaving). UPDATE After re-reading the section from Hacker's Delight on perfect shuffles/unshuffles I found some useful examples which I adapted as follows: // morton1 - extract even bits

uint32_t morton1(uint32_t x)
{
    x = x & 0x55555555;
    x = (x | (x >> 1)) & 0x33333333;
    x = (x | (x >> 2)) & 0x0F0F0F0F;
    x = (x | (x >> 4)) & 0x00FF00FF;
    x = (x | (x >> 8)) & 0x0000FFFF;
    return x;
}

// morton2 - extract odd and even bits

void morton2(uint32_t *x, uint32_t *y, uint32_t z)
{
    *x = morton1(z);
    *y = morton1(z >> 1);
}
 I think this can still be improved on, both in its current scalar form and also by taking advantage of SIMD, so I'm still interested in better solutions (either scalar or SIMD).
@CODE:input,  z: 11101101 01010111 11011011 01101110

output, x: 11100001 10110111 // odd bits shifted right by 1
        y: 10111111 11011010 // even bits // morton1 - extract even bits

uint32_t morton1(uint32_t x)
{
    x = x & 0x55555555;
    x = (x | (x >> 1)) & 0x33333333;

    return x;
}

@TITLE:Handling dropped clients in a duplex binding WCF application
@CONTENT:We are using a pub-sub model in our WCF application that pretty much follows the Microsoft sample: Design Patterns: List-Based Publish-Subscribe. Whilst the service provides a notion of subscribe() and unsubscribe(), what is the best practice to handle the cleanup in the situation when a client dies or the channel faults? Currently, when a client subscribes I attach to handlers to the current InstanceContext's Closed and Faulted events (the service users an PerSession instance context mode and netTcpBinding): _communicationObject = OperationContext.Current.InstanceContext;
_communicationObject.Closed += OnClientLost;
_communicationObject.Faulted += OnClientLost;
 The OnClientLost handler simply unsubscribes the client, however: Is the above a good practice and alone robust enough to catch all situations when a client drops off the duplex communication? Or should the service just handle exceptions encountered at the point it attempts to communicate with the client and handle cleanup then? Aside from just unsubscribing the client call back handler, should any further cleanup be performed especially in the case of a fault? This question poses a similar question but ultimately does not provide answers to the cases outside of the client calling subscribe and/or unsubscribe Thanks

In a new project, the files would look like this: while all I was able to create was: Did I mention that the app didn't work anymore this way? It crashed saying the model must not be nil. The problem was solved by starting a new project with the same name and dragging the files over to the old one - not the most elegant solution, I suppose. I figured however that there are things about Core Data that I still don't quite understand, obviously. Please, enlighten me - what's the magic behind the .xcdatamodeld folder?

@CONTENT:Let say we need to have just one instance of some class in our project. There are couple ways of doing it. I want to compare. Please can you review my understanding. 1) Classical Singleton pattern 2) Completely static class (all methods and members are static). As I understand the differences are following: a) The order of initialization of static members across different units isn't defined. So, completely static members initialization can't use any static members/functions from other modules. And singleton doesn't have this problem. b) We have to deal with threading for getInstance() of Singleton. However, completely static class doesn't have this problem. c) Access to methods looks a little bit different. Foo::bar(); vs Foo::getInstance()->bar(); Generally, singleton can return NULL to identify that there were some problems with construction of object and static class can't. d) Definition of class looks a little bit clunky with bunch of statics for static class. Have I missed anything?

   @DateTimeFormat(style="M-")
   public DateTime getDateOfBirth() {
      return dateOfBirth;
   }
}
 Now I want to display the dateOfBirth in my JSP: Date of birth: ${customer.dateOfBirth}
 But the result is unformatted: Date of birth: 2010-08-11T11:23:30.148+02:00
 After some research I found out, that I have to use the spring:bind-tag: <spring:bind path="customer.dateOfBirth">
   Date of birth: ${status.value}
</spring:bind>
 With this it works. But it seems too complicated for this simple task. And using this method on lists is even more complicated since you have to integrate the list-index into the binding-path. So my question is: Is there a simpler way to display a formatted value using the spring formatting-annotations?
@CODE:public class Customer {
   private DateTime dateOfBirth;

   @DateTimeFormat(style="M-")
   public DateTime getDateOfBirth() {
      return dateOfBirth;

@TITLE:Problem reloading a jar using URLClassLoader
@CONTENT:I need to add plugin functionality to an existing application for certain parts of the application. I want to be able to add a jar at runtime and the application should be able to load a class from the jar without restarting the app. So far so good. I found some samples online using URLClassLoader and it works fine. I also wanted the ability to reload the same class when an updated version of the jar is available. I again found some samples and the key to achieving this as I understand is that I need to use a new classloader instance for each new load. I wrote some sample code but hit a NullPointerException. First let me show you guys the code: package test.misc;

import java.io.File;
import java.net.URL;
import java.net.URLClassLoader;

import plugin.misc.IPlugin;

public class TestJarLoading {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        IPlugin plugin = null;

        while(true) {
            try {
                File file = new File("C:\\plugins\\test.jar");
                String classToLoad = "jartest.TestPlugin";
                URL jarUrl = new URL("jar", "","file:" + file.getAbsolutePath()+"!/");
                URLClassLoader cl = new URLClassLoader(new URL[] {jarUrl}, TestJarLoading.class.getClassLoader());
                Class loadedClass = cl.loadClass(classToLoad);
                plugin = (IPlugin) loadedClass.newInstance();
                plugin.doProc();
            } catch (Exception e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            } finally {
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(30000);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
 IPlugin is a simple interface with just one method doProc: public interface IPlugin {
    void doProc();
}
 and jartest.TestPlugin is an implementation of this interface where doProc just prints out some statements. Now, I package the jartest.TestPlugin class into a jar called test.jar and place it under C:\plugins and run this code. The first iteration runs smoothly and the class loads without issues. When the program is executing the sleep statement, I replace C:\plugins\test.jar with a new jar containing an updated version of the same class and wait for the next iteration of while. Now here's what I don't understand. Sometimes the updated class gets reloaded without issues i.e. the next iteration runs fine. But sometimes, I see an exception thrown: java.lang.NullPointerException

@TITLE:Installshield or Wix
@CONTENT:I have a pretty huge web application developed using asp.net 3.5 and I need to prepare an installer package which will be using to deploy the application on IIS 6 and 7. I have done a lot of research on Wix and Installsheild 2010 (pro) and need some advice before making decision. I notice that the installsheild is quite expense in terms of license but for me, I have enough budget so that won't be an issue. the installer should be able to perform the following processes. Deploy the published web resource (aspx etc). Create Virtual Directory. Create Database on sql server and run some initializing scripts. Modify XML files and web.config files. Set the permission to allow writing to the files in the virtual dir. I found that both technologies are capable of doing the above scenarios but I would like to get personnal experience and advices. Thanks Thurein

@CONTENT:I was asked by a customer what the term "data warehouse" really means. I thought about ETL, details of the data model, differences to NoSQL, Clouds, 'normal' DBMS, MDM (Master Data Management) etc. but wasn't able to describe the term in a few words to him... (In fact I did some talking and left him un-illuminated.) How can "data warehouse" described in 1-3 (or a bit more) sentences?

@TITLE:Resident Set Size (RSS) limit has no effect
@CONTENT:The following problem occurs on a machine running Ubuntu 10.04 with the 2.6.32-22-generic kernel: Setting a limit for the Resident Set Size (RSS) of a process does not seem to have any effect. I currently set the limit in Python with the following code: import resource
# (100, 100) is the (soft, hard) limit. ~100kb.
resource.setrlimit(resource.RLIMIT_RSS, (100, 100))
memory_sink = ['a']*10000000   # this should fail
 The list, memory_sink, succeeds every time. When I check RSS usage with top, I can easily get the process to use 1gb of RAM, which means that the limit is not working. Do RSS limits not work with this kernel or distro? If it helps, resource.RLIMIT_NPROC (user process limit) does work.
@CODE:import resource
# (100, 100) is the (soft, hard) limit. ~100kb.
resource.setrlimit(resource.RLIMIT_RSS, (100, 100))

@TITLE:How to handle set based consistency validation in CQRS?
@CONTENT:I have a fairly simple domain model involving a list of Facility aggregate roots. Given that I'm using CQRS and an event-bus to handle events raised from the domain, how could you handle validation on sets? For example, say I have the following requirement: Facility's must have a unique name. Since I'm using an eventually consistent database on the query side, the data in it is not guaranteed to be accurate at the time the event processesor processes the event. For example, a FacilityCreatedEvent is in the query database event processing queue waiting to be processed and written into the database. A new CreateFacilityCommand is sent to the domain to be processed. The domain services query the read database to see if there are any other Facility's registered already with that name, but returns false because the CreateNewFacilityEvent has not yet been processed and written to the store. The new CreateFacilityCommand will now succeed and throw up another FacilityCreatedEvent which would blow up when the event processor tries to write it into the database and finds that another Facility already exists with that name.

@TITLE:RSA Encrypt / Decrypt Problem in .NET
@CONTENT:I'm having a problem with C# encrypting and decrypting using RSA. I have developed a web service that will be sent sensitive financial information and transactions. What I would like to be able to do is on the client side, Encrypt the certain fields using the clients RSA Private key, once it has reached my service it will decrypt with the clients public key. At the moment I keep getting a "The data to be decrypted exceeds the maximum for this modulus of 128 bytes." exception. I have not dealt much with C# RSA cryptography so any help would be greatly appreciated. This is the method i am using to generate the keys private void buttonGenerate_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    string secretKey = RandomString(12, true);

    CspParameters param = new CspParameters();
    param.Flags = CspProviderFlags.UseMachineKeyStore;

    SecureString secureString = new SecureString();
    byte[] stringBytes = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(secretKey);
    for (int i = 0; i < stringBytes.Length; i++)
    {
        secureString.AppendChar((char)stringBytes[i]);
    }
    secureString.MakeReadOnly();
    param.KeyPassword = secureString;

    RSACryptoServiceProvider rsaProvider = new RSACryptoServiceProvider(param);
    rsaProvider = (RSACryptoServiceProvider)RSACryptoServiceProvider.Create();
    rsaProvider.KeySize = 1024;


    string publicKey = rsaProvider.ToXmlString(false);
    string privateKey = rsaProvider.ToXmlString(true);

    Repository.RSA_XML_PRIVATE_KEY = privateKey;
    Repository.RSA_XML_PUBLIC_KEY = publicKey;

    textBoxRsaPrivate.Text = Repository.RSA_XML_PRIVATE_KEY;
    textBoxRsaPublic.Text = Repository.RSA_XML_PUBLIC_KEY;

    MessageBox.Show("Please note, when generating keys you must sign on to the gateway\n" +
        " to exhange keys otherwise transactions will fail", "Key Exchange", MessageBoxButtons.OK, MessageBoxIcon.Information);

}
 Once i have generated the keys, i send the public key to the web service which stores it as an XML file. Now i decided to test this so here is my method to encrypt a string public static string RsaEncrypt(string dataToEncrypt)
{
    string rsaPrivate = RSA_XML_PRIVATE_KEY;
    CspParameters csp = new CspParameters();
    csp.Flags = CspProviderFlags.UseMachineKeyStore;

    RSACryptoServiceProvider provider = new RSACryptoServiceProvider(csp);

    provider.FromXmlString(rsaPrivate);

    ASCIIEncoding enc = new ASCIIEncoding();
    int numOfChars = enc.GetByteCount(dataToEncrypt);
    byte[] tempArray = enc.GetBytes(dataToEncrypt);
    byte[] result = provider.Encrypt(tempArray, true);
    string resultString = Convert.ToBase64String(result);
    Console.WriteLine("Encrypted : " + resultString);
    return resultString;
}
 I do get what seems to be an encrypted value. In the test crypto web method that i created, i then take this encrypted data, try and decrypt the data using the clients public key and send this back in the clear. But this is where the exception is thrown. Here is my method responsible for this. public string DecryptRSA(string data, string merchantId)
{
    string clearData = null;
    try
    {
        CspParameters param = new CspParameters();
        param.Flags = CspProviderFlags.UseMachineKeyStore;
        RSACryptoServiceProvider rsaProvider = new RSACryptoServiceProvider(param);

        string merchantRsaPublic = GetXmlRsaKey(merchantId);
        rsaProvider.FromXmlString(merchantRsaPublic);
        byte[] asciiString = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(data);

        byte[] decryptedData = rsaProvider.Decrypt(asciiString, false);

        clearData = Convert.ToString(decryptedData);
    }

    {
        Log.Error("A cryptographic error occured trying to decrypt a value for " + merchantId, ex);

    }

}

@TITLE:onPause/onResume activity issues
@CONTENT:I have a small test application I am working on which has a timer that updates a textview to countdown from 100 to 0. That works fine, but now I am trying to pause the application if the user presses the back button on the phone and then restart the timer from where they left off when they reopen the app. Here is the code I am using: @Override
public void onPause()
{
    if(this._timer_time_remaining > 0) {
        this.timer.cancel();
    }
    super.onPause();
    Log.v("Pausing", String.format("Pausing with %d", this._timer_time_remaining));
}

@Override
public void onResume()
{
    Log.v("Resuming", String.format("Resuming with %d", this._timer_time_remaining));

    if(this._timer_time_remaining > 0) {
        start_timer(this._timer_time_remaining);
    }
    super.onResume();
}
 The start_timer() method creates a CountDownTimer which updates the textview in the onTick method and updates the this._timer_time_remaining int variable. CountDownTimer and _timer_time_remaining are both declared at the class level like this: private CountDownTimer timer;
private int _timer_time_remaining;
 From the Log.v() prints I see that the _timer_time_remaining variable has the correct number of seconds stored when onPause is called, but it is set back to 0 when onResume starts. Why does the variable get reset? I thought that the application would continue to run in the background with the same values. Am I missing something? This is all declared in a class that extends Activity. Thanks in advance! Note: Edited to clean up the code copying
@CODE:@Override
public void onPause()
{
    if(this._timer_time_remaining > 0) {
        this.timer.cancel();

}

</HTML>
 I'm using NSXMLParser and it is going well till it find the ? html entity. It calls foundCharacters: for "Bye Bye" and then it calls resolveExternalEntityName:systemID:: with an entityName of "egrave". In this method i'm just returning the character "?" trasformed in an NSData, the foundCharacters is called again adding the string "?" to the previous one "Bye Bye " and then the parser raise the NSXMLParserUndeclaredEntityError error. I have no DTD and i cannot change the html file i'm parsing. Do you have any ideas on this problem? Thanks in advance to all of you, Rob. Update (12/03/2010). After the suggestion of Griffo i ended up with something like this: data = [self replaceHtmlEntities:data];
NSXMLParser *parser = [[NSXMLParser alloc] initWithData:data];
[parser setDelegate:self];
[parser parse];
 where replaceHtmlEntities:(NSData *) is something like this: - (NSData *)replaceHtmlEntities:(NSData *)data {

    NSString *htmlCode = [[NSString alloc] initWithData:data encoding:NSISOLatin1StringEncoding];
    NSMutableString *temp = [NSMutableString stringWithString:htmlCode];

    [temp replaceOccurrencesOfString:@"&amp;" withString:@"&" options:NSLiteralSearch range:NSMakeRange(0, [temp length])];
    [temp replaceOccurrencesOfString:@"&nbsp;" withString:@" " options:NSLiteralSearch range:NSMakeRange(0, [temp length])];
    ...
    [temp replaceOccurrencesOfString:@"&Agrave;" withString:@"?" options:NSLiteralSearch range:NSMakeRange(0, [temp length])];

    NSData *finalData = [temp dataUsingEncoding:NSISOLatin1StringEncoding];
    return finalData;

}
 But i am still looking the best way to solve this problem. I will try TouchXml in the next days but i still think that there should be a way to do this using NSXMLParser API, so if you know how, feel free to write it here :)

 Its only when navigating to the page that this error is displayed. I think with MVC, as there is some logic and referances in the View, it would be a good thing for the compiler to report the error. However i'd like to know if there is a solid reason that this not be the case?

    }
 In above code, I will get address of first pushed local variable on stack when foo function is active. How can I access the return address (main called foo) that is pushed somewhere before this variable on stack? Is that location fixed and can be accessed relative to first local variable? How can I modify it? EDIT: My environment is Ubuntu 9.04 on x86 processor with gcc compiler.

            foo();
            printf("in main\n");

@TITLE:why <br /> and not <br/>?
@CONTENT:This is one of those things that you read once, say "aha!" and then forget. Exactly my case. Why is the line-break tag in xhtml preferentially written with a space <br /> and not in the also ok format <br/> ? I remember the reason was interesting, and as you can imagine it's not easy to find with google. For sure it's not an issue of xml well-formedness. From W3C [44]    EmptyElemTag	   ::=   	'<' Name (S Attribute)* S? '/>'	

   Empty-element tags may be used for any element which has no content, whether
   or not it is declared using the keyword EMPTY. For interoperability, the 
   empty-element tag should be used, and should only be used, for elements which 
   are declared EMPTY.

Examples of empty elements:

<IMG align="left"  src="http://www.w3.org/Icons/WWW/w3c_home" /> 
<br></br> 
<br/>
 So the space at the end is optional.

I'm going to link to my examples as it needs some explaining. www.madmediablitz.com/tv/precentdemo.html The link above is the closest I've come to a solution and I'm hoping that someone here will find it simple to fix. What I want to happen is the tv to always be the height of the viewport (to a degree, min-height:~400px; max-height:~700px;). The code that I used there is based on http://www.alistapart.com/articles/creating-intrinsic-ratios-for-video/. www.madmediablitz.com/tv/precentdemo_alt.html This one is what I DON'T want to happen. IF you resize your window you will see it doesn't scale proportionally. I've been trying both of these for about 2 days now and I haven't been able to get it to work. I'm literally praying for help as I think, this isn't too complicated.

@TITLE:MKMapView loading all annotation views at once (including those that are outside the current rect)
@CONTENT:UPDATE It looks like this problem has been quietly fixed in iOS 4.3. Up to this point, the distance that was considered "far enough" for an annotation to be recycled seemed to be hundreds of miles, even when zoomed in very closely. When I build my app with the iOS 4.3 SDK, annotations are recycled based on more reasonable limits. Has anyone else run into this problem? Here's the code: - (MKAnnotationView *)mapView:(MKMapView *)mapView viewForAnnotation:(WWMapAnnotation *)annotation {



// Only return an Annotation view for the placemarks. Ignore for the current location--the iPhone SDK will place a blue ball there.

NSLog(@"Request for annotation view");

if ([annotation isKindOfClass:[WWMapAnnotation class]]){



    MKPinAnnotationView *browse_map_annot_view = (MKPinAnnotationView *)[mapView dequeueReusableAnnotationViewWithIdentifier:@"BrowseMapAnnot"];



    if (!browse_map_annot_view) {
        browse_map_annot_view = [[[MKPinAnnotationView alloc] initWithAnnotation:annotation reuseIdentifier:@"BrowseMapAnnot"] autorelease];
        NSLog(@"Creating new annotation view");
    } else {
        NSLog(@"Recycling annotation view");
        browse_map_annot_view.annotation = annotation;
    }
 ... As soon as the view is displayed, I get 2009-08-05 13:12:03.332 xxx[24308:20b] Request for annotation view
2009-08-05 13:12:03.333 xxx[24308:20b] Creating new annotation view

2009-08-05 13:12:03.333 xxx[24308:20b] Creating new annotation view
 and on and on, for every annotation (~60) I've added. The map (correctly) only displays the two annotations in the current rect. I am setting the region in viewDidLoad: if (center_point.latitude == 0) {
    center_point.latitude = 35.785098;
    center_point.longitude = -78.669899;
}

if (map_span.latitudeDelta == 0) {
    map_span.latitudeDelta = .001;
    map_span.longitudeDelta = .001;
}

map_region.center = center_point;
map_region.span = map_span;

NSLog(@"Setting initial map center and region");

[browse_map_view setRegion:map_region animated:NO];
 The log entry for the region being set is printed to the console before any annotation views are requested. The problem here is that since all of the annotations are being requested at once, [mapView dequeueReusableAnnotationViewWithIdentifier] does nothing, since there are unique MKAnnotationViews for every annotation on the map. This is leading to memory problems for me. One possible issue is that these annotations are clustered in a pretty small space (~1 mile radius). Although the map is zoomed in pretty tight in viewDidLoad (latitude and longitude delta .001), it still loads all of the annotation views at once. Thanks...

@TITLE:How can I debug this NullPointer Exception?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to write an application for Android and when I launch my new activity, I've set break points and found that it runs through my onCreate without any errors, but after that function returns, the debugger says there is a NullPointer Exception. The problem is, its not in my code, it says its in ActivityThread.performLaunchActivity(ActivityThread$ActivityRecord) line: 2268 and where the source normally would be (if it were my code) I just get "Source not found." and a button that says "Edit Source Lookup Path" How can I setup eclipse so I can debug this problem? I'm sure I'm doing something wrong in my code, but because the exception originates in code I can't see, I have no idea how to figure out where the problem is. I'm using android-sdk-linux_x86-1.5_r3 and my G1 for this project. UPDATE: I think my question really has more to do with android development than using eclipse. I'm not sure where to find the source for the the code that is throwing the exception. Maybe there is a way I can debug it without having that file, but I'm not sure what it would be.

@CONTENT:My company has a little widget that plugs into shopping carts. We are running into a problem where setting cookies in IE7 is not working. This is happening because we are a 3rd party because we are embedded into the site via an iframe. I have seen several post that say the way to solve this problem is by putting a P3P compact policy in the header. As mentioned: Cookie blocked/not saved in IFRAME in Internet Explorer I have verified that my P3P policy is in my HTTP header. And it actually works for the first page/step of the shopping cart site, but as soon as there is personal information on the page (like name, address, phone, etc), IE blocks my site and my cookie. I have tried several different P3P policies and they all don't work at the same place. I have also used the IBM P3P tool to generate my own special P3P policy, but it still doesn't work. I am at a complete loss.

For whatever reason, I was in the two-phase camp up until recently, because at some point I must have heard that it's bad to do error-prone operations in your constructor. However, I think I'm now convinced that single-phase is preferable, based on questions I've read on SO and other articles. My question is: Why does Objective C use the two-phase approach (alloc/init) almost exclusively for non-convenience constructors? Is there any specific reason in the language, or was it just a design decision by the designers?

@CONTENT:I understand copy constructor is called on three instances When instantiating one object and initializing it with values from another object (as in the example above). When passing an object by value. 3. When an object is returned from a function by value. I have question with no.3 if copy constructor is called when an object value is returned, shouldn't it create problems if object is declared locally in the function. i mean the copy constructor is a deep copy one and takes reference of an object as parameter

@TITLE:Building an assembler
@CONTENT:I need to build an assembler for a CPU architecture that I've built. The architecture is similar to MIPS, but this is of no importance. I started using C#, although C++ would be more appropriate. (C# means faster development time for me). My only problem is that I can't come with a good design for this application. I am building a 2 pass assembler. I know what I need to do in each pass.\ I've implemented the first pass and I realised that if I have to lines assembly code on the same line ...no error is thrown.This means only one thing poor parsing techniques. So almighty programmers, fathers of assembler enlighten me how should I proceed. I just need to support symbols and data declaration. Instructions have fixed size. Please let me know if you need more information.

@LINK:/questions/375316/xna-keyboard-text-input
@TITLE:XNA - Keyboard text input
@CONTENT:Okay, so basically I want to be able to retrieve keyboard text. Like entering text into a text field or something. I'm only writing my game for windows. I've disregarded using Guide.BeginShowKeyboardInput because it breaks the feel of a self contained game, and the fact that the Guide always shows XBOX buttons doesn't seem right to me either. Yes it's the easiest way, but I don't like it. Next I tried using System.Windows.Forms.NativeWindow. I created a class that inherited from it, and passed it the Games window handle, implemented the WndProc function to catch WM_CHAR (or WM_KEYDOWN) though the WndProc got called for other messages, WM_CHAR and WM_KEYDOWN never did. So I had to abandon that idea, and besides, I was also referencing the whole of Windows forms, which meant unnecessary memory footprint bloat. So my last idea was to create a Thread level, low level keyboard hook. This has been the most successful so far. I get WM_KEYDOWN message, (not tried WM_CHAR yet) translate the virtual keycode with Win32 funcation MapVirtualKey to a char. And I get my text! (I'm just printing with Debug.Write at the moment) A couple problems though. It's as if I have caps lock on, and an unresponsive shift key. (Of course it's not however, it's just that there is only one Virtual Key Code per key, so translating it only has one output) and it adds overhead as it attaches itself to the Windows Hook List and isn't as fast as I'd like it to be, but the slowness could be more due to Debug.Write. Has anyone else approached this and solved it, without having to resort to an on screen keyboard? or does anyone have further ideas for me to try? thanks in advance. Question asked by Jimmy Maybe I'm not understanding the question, but why can't you use the XNA Keyboard and KeyboardState classes? My comment: It's because though you can read keystates, you can't get access to typed text as and how it is typed by the user. So let me further clarify. I want to implement being able to read text input from the user as if they are typing into textbox is windows. The keyboard and KeyboardState class get states of all keys, but I'd have to map each key and combination to it's character representation. This falls over when the user doesn't use the same keyboard language as I do especially with symbols (my double quotes is shift + 2, while american keyboards have theirs somewhere near the return key). it seems my window hook was the way to go, just the reason I wasn't getting WM_CHAR is because the XNA message pump doesn't do translate message. Adding TranslateMessage in whenever I received a WM_KEYDOWN message meant I got my WM_CHAR message, I then used this to fire a character typed event in my MessageHook class which my KeyboardBuffer class had subscribed to, which then buffers that to a text buffer :D (or StringBuilder, but the result is the same) So I have it all working as I want. Many thanks to Jimmy for a link to a very informative thread.

Another developer gets updated code from the repository and has to manually set up all of these project references, but I can't even determine where this information is stored, unless it's in that .suo, which is NOT source-control friendly.

@TITLE:Stairway pattern implementation
@CONTENT:I came across "Stairway" pattern description in the "Adaptive code via C#" book and I don't really understand how this is supposed to be implemented: (source) So I have client assembly: using ServiceInterface;

namespace Client
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Have to create service implementation somehow
            // Where does ServiceFactory belong?
            ServiceFactory serviceFactory = new ServiceFactory();
            IService service = serviceFactory.CreateService();
            service.Do();
        }
    }
}
 Service interface assembly: namespace Service
{
    public interface IService
    {
        void Do();
    }
}
 And service implementation assembly: using ServiceInterface;

namespace ServiceImplementation
{
    public class PrintService : IService
    {
        public void Do()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Some work done");
        }
    }
}
 And the question is: how to I get an IService object in the Client namespace? Where shall I place actual new PrintService() object creation? This can't be a part of ServiceInterface, because interface assembly doesn't depend on ServiceImplementation. But it also can't be a part of Client or ServiceImplementation because Client should only depend on ServiceInterface. The only solution I came to is having Application assembly on top of it, which has references to all three (Client, ServiceInterface and ServiceImplementation) and injects IService into Client. Am I missing something?
@CODE:using ServiceInterface;

namespace Client
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Have to create service implementation somehow
            // Where does ServiceFactory belong?
            ServiceFactory serviceFactory = new ServiceFactory();
            IService service = serviceFactory.CreateService();
            service.Do();
        }
    }

@TITLE:How to set the theme for the application, to avoid wrong color transitions?
@CONTENT:Background I'm developing a themes chooser feature in my "app manager" app, and I've succeeded setting the theme dynamically for each of the activities. AGAIN : this is not about setting the theme for the activities. This actually works fine for me. The problem The acitivties are showing the correct theme, but the application itself, when launching the app, is showing the wrong one, no matter what I do. This is a problem because when the user opens the app, he will see the background of the theme of the app, and only after a few moments the activity will be shown with the theme the user has chosen. So, if the application has a white background, and the user has chosen a theme with a black background, the order will be: Application shows a white background -> activity is starting and shows a black background. In screenshots: So this is wrong. In this case, I need it to show black-to-black background. Only if the user has chosen a Holo-light based theme (which the app has by default), it works fine, as the color matches the one on the activity that is shown right when opening the app. What I've tried I had an idea of setting the app's theme to be empty of everything, hoping that no transition will be shown, using something like: <application
    ...
    android:theme="@android:style/Theme.Translucent.NoTitleBar" >
 In fact, some people here suggested a similar solution. This works, but it causes a bad experience, since on some devices it takes some time till the first activity is shown, and as such, there is a significant amount of time the user sees nothing at all, as if the app isn't being launched. The question How do I solve this? I've already tried setting the theme in the class that extends from Application, but it doesn't do anything, no matter where in this class I call it.

@TITLE:What is a Java 8 Lambda Expression Compiled to? [duplicate]
@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: How will Java lambda functions be compiled? 1 answer Consider the following Java 8 snippet. public static void main(String[] args) {            
   List<Integer> integers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

   Consumer<Integer>  consumer = x -> System.out.print(x);  

   integers.forEach(consumer);
}
 What is Consumer<Integer> consumer = x -> System.out.print(x) getting compiled to? I understand that Lambdas are not implemented as anonymous inner classes. However Consumer<Integer> is an interface therefore x -> System.out.print(x) must be producing an object of some kind but it is not clear what kind of object is being produced. Is there some new type of object in Java 8 to represent a lambda expression? Update Here is the decompiled program the program was complied with the eclipse java 8 complier and the output below is from eclipse when you open a class file. It looks like that the lambda expression is getting turned into a static method on the class that contains the lambda expression private static synthetic void lambda$0(java.lang.Integer x); // Compiled from Example.java (version 1.8 : 52.0, super bit)

@TITLE:ASP.NET Identity vs Simple membership Pros and Cons?
@CONTENT:In MVC4 we had Simple Membership. My opinion is that Simple Membership was a good Identity Model tried and tested with good documentation and didn't need to be fixed but simply needed an upgrade in terms of Email Verification/ Password Reset and all other stuff that we normally have to deal with when building an app. However the new ASP.NET Identity model seems achieve Something of sorts that Vista achieved over XP. I mean AspnetUserClaims and AspnetLogins could have been bunched together as UserAliases. And Microsoft should have provided some methods for the Email part of my babble. Having just discussed my opinion based on first looks which might be deceiving my question is I am trying to decide whether I should move from Simple Membership to the new ASP.NET Identity but since documentation and tests of ASP.NET Identity model is sparse, conflicting and hard to locate using Google. So can someone with experience of both please summarize the pros and cons?

 This is how my Application boots: @Configuration
@ComponentScan
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public class Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }
}
 When my Spring controller handles the connection: @Controller
public class GetController {

    private UserService userService;

    @Autowired 
    public void setUserService(UserService userService) {
        this.userService = userService;
    }

    @RequestMapping(value = "/user", method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public @ResponseBody User getUser(@RequestParam(value="id", required=true) int id) {
        User user = null;

        user = userService.getUser(id);

        return user;
    }
}
 It does a getUser on the userService: @Component
public class UserService {

    private UserDAO UserDao;

    public UserDAO getUserDao() {
        return UserDao;
    }

    @Autowired
    public void setUserDao(UserDAO UserDao) {
        this.UserDao = UserDao;
    }

    public User getUser(int id) {
        return getUserDao().load(id);
    }
}
 Which uses the userDao to find the entity: @Repository("userDao")
@Transactional(propagation=Propagation.REQUIRED)
public class UserDAO {

    @PersistenceContext
    private EntityManager entityManager;

    public void insert(User user) {
        entityManager.persist(user);
    }

    public User load(int id) {
        return entityManager.find(User.class, id);
    }
}
 I have the following spring-config.xml in /src/main/resources: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

@LINK:/questions/19193540/difference-between-throws-in-method-signature-and-throw-statements-in-java
@TITLE:Difference between Throws in method signature and Throw Statements in Java
@CONTENT:I am trying to make it clear of the difference between Throws in method signature and Throw Statements in Java. Throws in method signature is as following: public void aMethod() throws IOException{
    FileReader f = new FileReader("notExist.txt");
}
 Throw Statements is as following: public void bMethod() {
    throw new IOException();
}
 From my understanding, a throws in method signature is a notification that the method may throw such an exception. throw statement is what actually throw a created object under according circumstances. In that sense, throws in method signature should always appear if there exist a throw statement in the method. However, the following code doesn't seem doing so. The code is from the library. My question is why it is happening? Am I understanding the concepts wrong? This piece of code is a copy from java.util.linkedList. @author Josh Bloch  /**
 * Returns the first element in this list.
 *
 * @return the first element in this list
 * @throws NoSuchElementException if this list is empty
 */
public E getFirst() {
    final Node<E> f = first;
    if (f == null)
        throw new NoSuchElementException();
    return f.item;
}
 Update on the answer: update 1 : is above code the same as the following? public E getFirst() throws  NoSuchElementException{   //as far as I know, it is the same as without throws
    final Node<E> f = first;
    if (f == null)
        throw new NoSuchElementException();
    return f.item;
}
 update 2 : For checked exception. Do I need to have "throws" in the signature? Yes. public String abc() throws IOException{  //has to throw checked exception otherwise compile error
    throw new IOException();
}
@CODE:public void aMethod() throws IOException{
    FileReader f = new FileReader("notExist.txt");
} public void bMethod() {
    throw new IOException();
} throws throw /**
 * Returns the first element in this list.
 *
 * @return the first element in this list
 * @throws NoSuchElementException if this list is empty
 */
public E getFirst() {
    final Node<E> f = first;
    if (f == null)
        throw new NoSuchElementException();
    return f.item;
} public E getFirst() throws  NoSuchElementException{   //as far as I know, it is the same as without throws
    final Node<E> f = first;
    if (f == null)
        throw new NoSuchElementException();
    return f.item;
} public String abc() throws IOException{  //has to throw checked exception otherwise compile error
    throw new IOException();
} throw new throw new MyException() throw (new MyException()) MyException e = new MyException(); throw e throw new

@LINK:/questions/19169115/phonegap-keyboard-changes-window-height-in-ios-7
@TITLE:Phonegap: Keyboard changes window height in iOS 7
@CONTENT:In iOS 6 everything works fine. The keyboard opens and moves the input into view. When the keyboard closes everything goes back where it should. In iOS 7 the keyboard opens fine and the input remains in view. When the keyboard is closed the whole bottom half of the app is gone, though. I've tracked the issue down to the height of the window changing when the keyboard is opened, and not changing back when it's closed. Right before the keyboard is opened the window height is 568 according to $(window).height() and after it's opened and after it's closed it is 828. The height of the document also changes accordingly. I've attempted preventing the window from resizing with: $(window).resize(function(e) {
   e.preventDefault();
   e.stopPropagation();
   window.resizeTo(320,480);
   return false;
});
 I've also attempted to set the size back after the keyboard closes with no success. I'm using phonegap 2.7 and have KeyboardShrinksView set to true.
@CODE:$(window).resize(function(e) {
   e.preventDefault();
   e.stopPropagation();
   window.resizeTo(320,480);
   return false;

@TITLE:In iOS7 Text Magnifier isn't working app wide
@CONTENT:I have a came across a rather annoying bug in one of my apps. In iOS7 when I hold down on a UITextView or UITextField to bring up the Magnifying Glass, nothing shows up in the magnified area. This problem is app wide and the only element that ever shows up in the circle area is the keyboard itself (when I drag my finger down to the top of it). I have tried everything from View Controllers with only a single UITextView to UIWebView and the problem is app wide. The magnifying glass works as expected on iOS6 devices, and the iOS7 simulator. But not on any of the devices I have tested it with running iOS7. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

@TITLE:How can I prevent iPhone (including iOS 7) from going to sleep in HTML or JS?
@CONTENT:I'm attempting to write some code to keep a phone alive and not go to sleep on a webpage. In my search, I found this post: Prevent iOS mobile safari from going idle / auto-locking / sleeping? But looping an audio file seems to no longer keep MobileSafari alive and prevent the phone from locking. While forcing the page to refresh every 30 seconds works, I need the original page to stay open. Google's latest interactive music video, Just A Reflektor, seems to be preventing lock from mobile, and their JS here references a preventSleepIos function. What could I simply do to prevent iOS from falling asleep? Thanks!

@TITLE:Dynamic expand UITextView on ios 7
@CONTENT:I am using this code CGRect frame = self.mytext.frame;
frame.size.height = self.mytext.contentSize.height;
self.mytext.frame = frame;
 But it doesn`t work in iOS 7. Does anyone know why or have the same problem? EDITED: Sorry. I made an UIView, a UITextView and a UIScrollView so i can load the text in my uitextview expand. I used this code in viewDidLoad CGRect frame = self.moreDetailsTextView.frame;
frame.size.height = self.moreDetailsTextView.contentSize.height;
self.moreDetailsTextView.frame = frame;

CGRect moreViewFrame =  self.moreDetailsView.frame;
moreViewFrame.size.height = frame.size.height + 270;
self.moreDetailsView.frame = moreViewFrame;

int scrollViewHeight =  moreViewFrame.size.height + 235;
self.scrollView.contentSize = CGSizeMake(320, scrollViewHeight);
 This was working fine in ios6, but now with xcode5 and ios7 the uitextview does not expand when i test the app in the simulator.
@CODE:CGRect frame = self.mytext.frame;
frame.size.height = self.mytext.contentSize.height;
self.mytext.frame = frame; CGRect frame = self.moreDetailsTextView.frame;

self.moreDetailsTextView.frame = frame;

CGRect moreViewFrame =  self.moreDetailsView.frame;

@TITLE:AMD equivalent to NvOptimusEnablement
@CONTENT:For Intel+NVIDIA dual-GPU "Optimus" setups, an application can export NvOptimusEnablement as explained in OptimusRenderingPolicies.pdf. This option allows an application to ensure the use of the high-speed discrete GPU without needing profile updates or user interaction, which is usually desired for certain classes of applictions. Is there an equivalent trick for systems with AMD GPUs (Windows-only is fine), and if so, what is it? I have not been able to find any concrete information via Googling; only a lot of people asking the same question on various forums with no answers, or SO articles on the NVIDIA trick with a "maybe AMD has something similar, I don't know" comment.

@LINK:/questions/17190755/why-sbt-runs-dependency-resolution-every-time-after-clean
@TITLE:Why sbt runs dependency resolution every time after clean?
@CONTENT:SBT runs dependency resolution every time after clean even if project dependency management configuration hasn't changed. This is time consuming when running on CI server. But documentation says: Normally, if no dependency management configuration has changed since the last successful resolution and the retrieved files are still present, sbt does not ask Ivy to perform resolution. How can I stop sbt from doing dependency resolution every time I build project with sbt clean publish-local ? Update I've discovered that sbt also runs resolution when I enter in interactive mode with sbt. Update2 As @Ezhik pointed if I can preserve target/resolution-cache then sbt will not resolve dependencies after clean. So I tried to move resolution-cache out from target dir: ivyConfiguration <<= (externalResolvers, ivyPaths, offline, checksums, appConfiguration, target, streams) map { (rs, paths, off, check, app, t, s) =>
        val resCacheDir = t / ".." / "resolution-cache"
        new InlineIvyConfiguration(paths, rs, Nil, Nil, off, Option(lock(app)), check, Some(resCacheDir), s.log)
      }
 Now with this code in Build.scala resolution cache is placed in project root and is therefore preserved after clean, but resolution is being done anyway. So I assume this approach is wrong or insufficient.
@CODE:clean sbt clean publish-local sbt @Ezhik target/resolution-cache resolution-cache ivyConfiguration <<= (externalResolvers, ivyPaths, offline, checksums, appConfiguration, target, streams) map { (rs, paths, off, check, app, t, s) =>
        val resCacheDir = t / ".." / "resolution-cache"
        new InlineIvyConfiguration(paths, rs, Nil, Nil, off, Option(lock(app)), check, Some(resCacheDir), s.log)
      } Build.scala clean

@CONTENT:In play's 2.0.x doc you can see how to schedule asynchronous tasks: http://www.playframework.org/documentation/2.0.4/ScalaAkka Akka.system.scheduler.schedule(0 seconds, 30 minutes, testActor, "tick")
 How can you achieve the same thing withthe recently releades Play 2.1??? The whole akka API seems to have changed... I've checked: https://github.com/playframework/Play20/wiki/Highlights https://github.com/playframework/Play20/wiki/Migration and also http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.1.0-RC1/project/migration-guide-2.0.x-2.1.x.html also asked here: https://groups.google.com/d/topic/play-framework/7VcwNea6QlM/discussion

@TITLE:Python 3: send method of generators
@CONTENT:I can't understand the send method. I understand that it is used to operate the generator. But the syntax is here: generator.send(value). I somehow can't catch why the value should become the result of the current yield expression. I prepared an example: def gen():
    for i in range(10):
        X = yield i
        if X == 'stop':
            break
        print("Inside the function " + str(X))

m = gen()
print("1 Outside the function " + str(next(m)) + '\n')
print("2 Outside the function " + str(next(m)) + '\n')
print("3 Outside the function " + str(next(m)) + '\n')
print("4 Outside the function " + str(next(m)) + '\n')
print('\n')
print("Outside the function " + str(m.send(None)) + '\n') # Start generator
print("Outside the function " + str(m.send(77)) + '\n')
print("Outside the function " + str(m.send(88)) + '\n')
#print("Outside the function " + str(m.send('stop')) + '\n')
print("Outside the function " + str(m.send(99)) + '\n')
print("Outside the function " + str(m.send(None)) + '\n')
 The result is: 1 Outside the function 0

Inside the function None
2 Outside the function 1

 Well, frankly speaking, it is astonishing me. In the documentation we can read that when a yield statement is executed, the state of the generator is frozen and the value of expression_list is returned to next¡¥s caller. Well, it doesn't seem to have happened. Why can we execute if statement and print function inside gen(). How can I understand why X inside and outside the function differs? Ok. Let us assume that send(77) transmits 77 into m. Well, yield expression becomes 77. Then what is X = yield i? And how 77 inside the function converts into 5 when occurs outside? Why the first result string doesn't reflect anything that is going on inside the generator? Anyway, could you somehow comment on these send and yield statements?
@CODE:send generator.send(value) yield def gen():
    for i in range(10):
        X = yield i
        if X == 'stop':
            break

@LINK:/questions/12053709/how-to-expose-iobservablet-properties-without-using-subjectt-backing-field
@TITLE:How to expose IObservable<T> properties without using Subject<T> backing field
@CONTENT:In this answer to a question about Subject<T> Enigmativity mentioned: as an aside, you should try to avoid using subjects at all. The general rule is that if you're using a subject then you're doing something wrong. I often use subjects as backing fields for IObservable properties, which would have probably been .NET events in the days before Rx. e.g. instead of something like public class Thing
{
    public event EventHandler SomethingHappened;

    private void DoSomething()
    {
        Blah();
        SomethingHappened(this, EventArgs.Empty);
    }
}
 I might do public class Thing
{
    private readonly Subject<Unit> somethingHappened = new Subject<Unit>();
    public IObservable<Unit> SomethingHappened
    {
        get { return somethingHappened; }
    }

    private void DoSomething()
    {
        Blah();
        somethingHappened.OnNext(Unit.Default);
    }
}
 So, if I want to avoid using Subject what would be the correct way of doing this kind of thing? Or I should I stick to using .NET events in my interfaces, even when they'll be consumed by Rx code (so probably FromEventPattern)? Also, a bit more details on why using Subject like this is a bad idea would be helpful. Update: To make this question a bit more concrete, I'm talking about using Subject<T> as a way to get from non-Rx code (maybe you're working with some other legacy code) into the Rx world. So, something like: class MyVolumeCallback : LegacyApiForSomeHardware
{
    private readonly Subject<int> volumeChanged = new Subject<int>();

    public IObservable<int> VolumeChanged
    {
        get
        {
            return volumeChanged.AsObservable();
        }
    }

    protected override void UserChangedVolume(int newVolume)
    {
        volumeChanged.OnNext(newVolume);
    }
}
 Where, instead of using events, the LegacyApiForSomeHardware type makes you override virtual methods as a way of getting "this just happened" notifications.
@CODE:Subject<T> IObservable public class Thing
{
    public event EventHandler SomethingHappened;

    private void DoSomething()
    {
        Blah();
        SomethingHappened(this, EventArgs.Empty);
    }
} public class Thing
{
    private readonly Subject<Unit> somethingHappened = new Subject<Unit>();
    public IObservable<Unit> SomethingHappened
    {
        get { return somethingHappened; }
    }

    private void DoSomething()
    {
        Blah();
        somethingHappened.OnNext(Unit.Default);
    }
} Subject FromEventPattern Subject Subject<T> class MyVolumeCallback : LegacyApiForSomeHardware
{
    private readonly Subject<int> volumeChanged = new Subject<int>();

    public IObservable<int> VolumeChanged
    {
        get
        {
            return volumeChanged.AsObservable();
        }
    }

    protected override void UserChangedVolume(int newVolume)
    {
        volumeChanged.OnNext(newVolume);
    }
}

 The problem is I want to save all the graphs plot1, plot2, plot3 to a single pdf. So, is there any way to achieve it and no, I can't include the plotGraph function in the mainModule. There's a function named "pylab.savefig" but that seems to work only if its placed along with plotting module. Is there any other way to accomplish it? Suggest me any changes to my function codes so that I can save the plots into a single pdf file.

@CONTENT:I am writing a shell script to put data into hadoop as soon as they are generated. I can ssh to my master node, copy the files to a folder over there and then put them into hadoop. I am looking for a shell command to get rid of copying the file to the local disk on master node. to better explain what I need, here below you can find what I have so far: 1) copy the file to the master node's local disk: scp test.txt username@masternode:/folderName/
 I have already setup SSH connection using keys. So no password is needed to do this. 2) I can use ssh to remotely execute the hadoop put command: ssh username@masternode "hadoop dfs -put /folderName/test.txt hadoopFolderName/"
 what I am looking for is how to pipe/combine these two steps into one and skip the local copy of the file on masterNode's local disk. thanks In other words, I want to pipe several command in a way that I can

@TITLE:Python method-wrapper type?
@CONTENT:What is the method-wrapper type in Python 3? If I define a class like so: class Foo(object):
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val
    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.val == other.val
 And then do: Foo(42).__eq__
 I get: <bound method Foo.__eq__ of <__main__.Foo object at 0x10121d0>>
 But if I do (in Python 3 ): Foo(42).__ne__
 I get: <method-wrapper '__ne__' of Foo object at 0x1073e50>
 What is a "method-wrapper" type? Edit: sorry to be more accurate: class method-wrapper is the type of __ne__, as if I do: >>> type(Foo(42).__ne__)
<class 'method-wrapper'>
 Whereas the type of __eq__ is: >>> type(Foo(42).__eq__)
<class 'method'>
 Furthermore method-wrapper seems to be the type of any undefined magic method on a class (so __le__, __repr__, __str__ etc if not explicitly defined will also have this type). What I am interested in is how the method-wrapper class is used by Python. Are all "default implementations" of methods on a class just instances of this type?

    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val

@CONTENT:I am writing a C function that will be invoked from assembly code. (Specifically, I want to do some checking job in the path of system call handling in linux kernel, so I will call the c function before a system call is dispatched in entry_32.S) I am confused with the "asmlinkage" modifier when defining my c function. I know asmlinkage is to tell the compiler that the parameters will be passed through stack. #define asmlinkage CPP_ASMLINKAGE __attribute__((regparm(0))) Questions: (1) Is asmlinkage required when defining such a function that will be invoked from assembly code? (2) what is the default calling convention in gcc. If I omit "asmlinkage" when defining a c function, does it imply _cdecl or fastcall? (3) if the default calling convention is cdecl, why is asmlinkage needed, considering cdecl is equal to asmlinkage modifier? (am I correct here?) (4) why are those system call functions all declared with asmlinkage. Can we copy the parameters to registers first, then call those system call functions? From my point of view, in x86, when issuing a system call, the parameters are readily saved in registers; then why bother to save then in stack to enforce such passing parameters via stack convention? Finally, can anybody recommend some resources/books that I can refer to for such mix assembly/c programming?

@TITLE:Are floats bad? What should be used in its place
@CONTENT:I've made the jump from table design to css about a week ago and have since been reading more about it. Yesterday, I read a long post here on SO where the posters were knocking floats and about how depreciated they are. There was a lot of talk about inline-block being used in its place. I have a HTML5 design that I just finished and it looks fantastic in firefox and chrome but when tested from other computers running explorer versions 7, 8 and 9, the design absolutely explodes. It seems to me that anything in this design that I've floated right is not honored in IE. It just seems to wrap under whatever is to the left of it. I'd like to know if I'm OK with floats or if I should I be using inline-block instead. An example of how to have two divs next to one another where one is on the left side and the other on the right, using inline-block would be nice. I have another dilemma here that hopefully someone can help me with. I am on an old development machine running XP SP1. The best IE browser I can test with is 6. I'd like to somehow get a hold of something that will allow me to test versions 7, 8 and 9 (and 10 if it's out yet). Can someone recommend any solution for this?

@CONTENT:We recently switched to Entity Framework data migrations and I am working on some build automation scripts for our MVC app. I can successfully run the migrations from our build server using the migrate.exe tool in 4.3 if I have a Web.config to point it at.

    /startupdirectory:ProjectName\bin\Debug 
    /startupconfigurationfile:ProjectName\Web.config

 However, for various reasons I would like to avoid using the Web.config and just pass in the correct connection string at the time of the migration: ProjectName\packages\EntityFramework.4.3.1\tools\migrate.exe MyAssembly
    /startupdirectory:ProjectName\bin\Debug 
    /connectionString:"Data Source=awesomeserver;Initial Catalog=awesomedatabase;User Id=funkyuser;Password=crazypassword"

@TITLE:Why does String.hashCode() in Java have many conflicts? [closed]
@CONTENT:Why does String.hashcode() have so many conflicts? I'm reading the String.hashCode() in jdk1.6, below is the codes public int hashCode() {
    int h = hash;
    if (h == 0) {
        int off = offset;
        char val[] = value;
        int len = count;

        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            h = 31*h + val[off++];
        }
        hash = h;
    }
    return h;
}
 This looks quite confusing to me because it has so many conflicts; although it's not required to be unique (we can still rely on the equals()), but less conflicts means better performance without visiting the entries in a linked list. Suppose we've two characters, then so long as we can find two strings matching below equation, then we will have the same hashcode() a * 31 +b = c * 31 +d
 It will be easy to conclude that (a-c) * 31 = d-b take an easy example is make a-c = 1 and d-b = 31; so i wrote below codes for simple test public void testHash() {
    System.out.println("A:" + (int)'A');
    System.out.println("B:" + (int)'B');
    System.out.println("a:" + (int)'a');

    System.out.println("Aa".hashCode() + "," + "BB".hashCode());
    System.out.println("Ba".hashCode() + "," + "CB".hashCode());
    System.out.println("Ca".hashCode() + "," + "DB".hashCode());
    System.out.println("Da".hashCode() + "," + "EB".hashCode());        
}
 it will print below results which means all the strings have the same hashcode(), and it's easy to do it in a loop. A:65

 even worse, suppose we've 4 characters in the string, according to the algorithm, suppose the first 2 characters produce a2, the 2nd 2 characters produce b2; the hashcode will still be a2 * 31^2 + b2 thus, with a2 and b2 equal between 2 strings, we will get more strings with hashcode() conflict. such examples are "AaAa", "BBBB" and so on; then we will have 6 characters, 8 characters...... suppose most of the time we use characters in ascii table in a string which will be used in a hashmap or hashtable, then the choosen prime number 31 here is definitely too small; one easy fix is to use a larger prime number (luckily, 257 is a prime number) which can avoid this conflict. of course, choose a too big number will cause returned int value to be overflowed if the string is very long, but i assume most of the time the string used as a key is not that big? of course, it could still return a long value to avoid this. below is my modified version of betterhash() which can solve such conflicts easily by running the codes it will print below values, which is effective to solve this problem. 16802,17028

@TITLE:access (faster polling) accelerometer via NativeActivity NDK
@CONTENT:I've searched for a tutorial/an answer on polling accelerometer faster with NDK but didnt find solver yet. just found an androiddevelopers documentation here. what i need is polling acceleration about 100 samples per second (100Hz), by default my device (Samsung Galaxy SL i9003 with gingerbread 2.3.5) with default SENSOR_DELAY_FASTEST can only get about 60 samples persecond (60Hz). Therefore i tried to access sensor via NativeActivity with NDK by generating .c files that i try to make based on sensor.h and looper.h: #include <jni.h>
#include <string.h>

#include <android/sensor.h>
#include <android/log.h>

    ALooper* looper = ALooper_forThread();
    if(looper == NULL)
        looper = ALooper_prepare(ALOOPER_PREPARE_ALLOW_NON_CALLBACKS);

    ASensorRef accelerometerSensor = ASensorManager_getDefaultSensor(sensorManager,ASENSOR_TYPE_ACCELEROMETER);
    LOGI("accelerometerSensor: %s, vendor: %s", ASensor_getName(accelerometerSensor), ASensor_getVendor(accelerometerSensor));

    ASensorEventQueue* queue = ASensorManager_createEventQueue(sensorManager, looper, LOOPER_ID, NULL, NULL);

    ASensorEventQueue_enableSensor(queue, accelerometerSensor);
    ASensorEventQueue_setEventRate(queue, accelerometerSensor, (1000L/SAMP_PER_SEC)*1000); 

    int ident;//identifier 
    int events;
    while (1) {
        while ((ident=ALooper_pollAll(-1, NULL, &events, NULL) >= 0)) {
            // If a sensor has data, process it now.
            if (ident == LOOPER_ID) {
                ASensorEvent event;
                while (ASensorEventQueue_getEvents(queue, &event, 1) > 0) {

                }
            }
        }
    }

}
 so far, i've been able to access accelerometer with NativeActivity, but there is no change with number sample had taken. even when i change ASensorEventQueue_setEventRate big enough or small enough the acceleration recorded still about 60 samples per second (1 samples per 15 milisec) is there any mistakes in my code? or something that i forget with? thanks in advance

@CONTENT:I'm working on an iOS5 app using storyboard, and I have a method in a view controller class that i'd like to access from the App Delegate. The trouble is, this view controller gets instantiated via a tab bar controller in storyboard, so the App Delegate has no direct way of calling the method I want... For a view controller to get in touch with the App Delegate, all one has to do is use: MyAppDelegate *appDelegate = (MyAppDelegate *)[[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate];
 Is there a similarly easy way of pointing to an already-instantiated view controller or class?

@CONTENT:I have recently became familiar with C# application settings, and it seems cool. I was searching for a way to store a list of custom objects, but I couldn't find a way!

</Setting>
 I tried to address my object as quoted below in the type attribute but it wasn't helpful since it doesn't recognizing my object... I tried "type = List" and "type="tuple[]" both of these options didn't help me! I have a class looks like: class tuple

@TITLE:Android - How to upload photo from the SD card to the Facebook wall
@CONTENT:I use the Facebook Android SDK. Goal Create multiple posts in news feed of Facebook logged in user that will contain photo from the Android device (its SD card) and some comment. The result should be the same as when you do it using the Add photo/video feature directly in Facebook. In the end, it should look like this: Wanted Facebook result Problem I can't do it. I went through the numerous similar posts on Stack Overflow, but no answer there so far. What I have tried to implement so far Approach 1: SD card photos 2 Facebook album How Upload pictures from my mobile (its SD card) to an album that is created for my application the first time I upload a picture from it. In this case, when constructing the params object, I use the picture key and put the bytes of the picture as its value. I use me/photos in the request(...) call of the Facebook (or AsyncFacebookRunner) object. ** The problem Not all uploaded images are displayed on my wall. Instead, there is something like x photos were added to the album xxx. The code snippet is this (for one picture) Bundle params = new Bundle();
params.putString("message", "Uploaded on " + now());
params.putByteArray("picture", bytes); //bytes contains photo bytes, no problem here
asyncRunner.request("me/photos", params, "POST", new PostPhotoRequestListener(), null);
 Facebook result Approach 2: Internet photos 2 facebook news feed How Display pictures stored somewhere on the Internet in posts on my wall. In this case, when constructing the params object, I use the link key and set the url to picture as its value. I use me/feed in the request(...) call. The problem This produces some strange output, but it isn't what I want. The code snippet is this (for one picture) Bundle params = new Bundle();
params.putString("message", "Uploaded on " + now());
params.putString("link", "http://i1114.photobucket.com/albums/k538/tom_rada/bota2.jpg");
asyncRunner.request("me/feed", params, "POST", new PostPhotoRequestListener(), null);
 Facebook result Approach 3: Mix of approach 1 and 2 How I try to use the picture key and set photo bytes as its value (as in 1.), and call the request with me/feed (as in 2.), The problem Message is produced as I would like it to be, but no photo is included The code snippet is this (for one picture) Bundle params = new Bundle();
params.putString("message", "Uploaded on " + now());
params.putByteArray("picture", bytes); //bytes contains photo bytes, no problem here
asyncRunner.request("me/feed", params, "POST", new PostPhotoRequestListener(), null);
 Facebook result So, any ideas how I could reach my goal? EDIT - WORKAROUND FOUND It seems that the only way to create new posts containing photos on user's wall is to add photos and related comments to user's Wall photos album. How - Code snippet Beware: The facebook.request call should be replaced with async call, so the operation doesn't block the UI thread !!! String wallAlbumID = null;
String response = facebook.request("me/albums");
JSONObject json = Util.parseJson(response);
JSONArray albums = json.getJSONArray("data");
for (int i =0; i < albums.length(); i++) {
    JSONObject album = albums.getJSONObject(i);
    if (album.getString("type").equalsIgnoreCase("wall")) {
        wallAlbumID = album.getString("id");
        Log.d("JSON", wallAlbumID);
        break;
    }
}
 ... and then if (wallAlbumID != null) {
    Bundle params = new Bundle();
    params.putString("message", "Uploaded on " + now());
    params.putByteArray("source", bytes);
    asyncRunner.request(wallAlbumID+"/photos", params, "POST", new PostPhotoRequestListener(), null);
}

@TITLE:ssh X11 forwarding won't work
@CONTENT:I have been trying to get X11 port forwarding to work from my laptop. I can't figure out why it won't work. I get this message when I try to run xterm: X11 connection rejected because of wrong authentication.
xterm Xt error: Can't open display: localhost:10.0
 I don't know if this is related or not, but when I login, I get this message: /usr/bin/xauth:  timeout in locking authority file /home/sphillips/.Xauthority
 I have wondered if the problem is that my local user on my laptop is skp and the username on this server is sphillips. I have been able to get X11 forwarding to work with my other computers that use the same skp login. Also, the X11 port forwarding works from a Windows machine using Xming and Putty to the same server. I have to manually configure the DISPLAY variable to the IP address and display 0.0, but it works. I have run an xhost + on my machine with the attempt to try to bypass any security issues. That still didn't work. On the server, I check the configuration: $ sudo grep X11Forwarding /etc/ssh/sshd_config
#X11Forwarding no
X11Forwarding yes
#   X11Forwarding no
 And on my machine as well: $ sudo grep X11Forwarding /etc/ssh/sshd_config
[sudo] password for skp: 
#X11Forwarding no
X11Forwarding yes

 My server is RedHat Enterprise Linux 6 and my laptop is Fedora 15. Can anyone give me any thoughts on things to try to get SSH X11 forwarding to work from my laptop?

@TITLE:Correct pattern to acquire a WakeLock in a BroadcastReceiver and release it in a Service
@CONTENT:Even after a lot of research I am still not completely sure if the way how I implement a WakeLock for a Service started by a BroadcastReceiver is correct - even though it seems to work fine. The broadcast receiver gets intents sent to it from an alarm, so to start with, from the API docs of AlarmManager: If your alarm receiver called Context.startService(), it is possible that the phone will sleep before the requested service is launched. To prevent this, your BroadcastReceiver and Service will need to implement a separate wake lock policy to ensure that the phone continues running until the service becomes available. So, in onReceive() I do:     Intent serviceIntent = new Intent(context, SomeService.class);
    context.startService(serviceIntent);

    if(SomeService.wakeLock == null) {
        PowerManager powerManager = (PowerManager)context.getSystemService(Context.POWER_SERVICE);
        SomeService.wakeLock = powerManager.newWakeLock(
                PowerManager.PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK, 
                SomeService.WAKE_LOCK_TAG);
    }
    if(! SomeService.wakeLock.isHeld()) {
        SomeService.wakeLock.acquire();
    }
 and in the service I do:     try {
        // Do some work
    } finally {
        if(wakeLock != null) {
            if(wakeLock.isHeld()) {
                wakeLock.release();
            }
            wakeLock = null;
        }
    }
 The SomeService.wakeLockfield is package private, static and volatile. What I am unsure about is the check using isHeld() - does it really tell me if a WakeLock is acquired or not, and do I need to do this check at all?
@CODE:WakeLock Service BroadcastReceiver AlarmManager onReceive() Intent serviceIntent = new Intent(context, SomeService.class);
    context.startService(serviceIntent);

    if(SomeService.wakeLock == null) {
        PowerManager powerManager = (PowerManager)context.getSystemService(Context.POWER_SERVICE);
        SomeService.wakeLock = powerManager.newWakeLock(
                PowerManager.PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK, 
                SomeService.WAKE_LOCK_TAG);
    }
    if(! SomeService.wakeLock.isHeld()) {
        SomeService.wakeLock.acquire();
    } try {
        // Do some work
    } finally {
        if(wakeLock != null) {
            if(wakeLock.isHeld()) {
                wakeLock.release();
            }
            wakeLock = null;
        }
    } SomeService.wakeLock isHeld() WakeLock

This leads to lots of: No serializer defined for type: System.DateTimeOffset Can I define my own serialization routine for unknown types? (The same question was asked earlier, but his problem was worked around.) I'm using the latest protobuf-net beta, v2.0.0.431, under .NET 4 if it matters.

@TITLE:Is there a generic way to adapt a function template to be a polymorphic function object?
@CONTENT:I have some function templates, for example template <typename T>
void foo(T);

template <typename T>
void bar(T);

// others
 and I need to pass each one to an algorithm that will call it with various types, e.g. template <typename F>
void some_algorithm(F f)
{
    // call f with argument of type int
    // call f with argument of type SomeClass
    // etc.
}
 I can't pass in my function template uninstantiated, but I can't instantiate it with any specific type either because some_algorithm will need to call it with arguments of several different types. I could adapt my function templates to be polymorphic function objects, e.g. struct foo_polymorphic
{
    template <typename T>
    void operator()(T t)
    {
        foo(t);
    }
};
 and then pass it as some_algorithm(foo_polymorphic()). But this requires writing a separate adapter for each of my function templates. Is there a generic way of adapting a function template to be a polymorphic function object, i.e. some mechanism that I can re-use for each of the function templates I need to adapt, without having to declare something separately for each one?
@CODE:template <typename T>
void foo(T);

template <typename T>
void bar(T);

// others template <typename F>
void some_algorithm(F f)
{
    // call f with argument of type int
    // call f with argument of type SomeClass

{
    template <typename T>
    void operator()(T t)
    {
        foo(t);
    }
}; some_algorithm(foo_polymorphic()) Non-type template parameters must be of integral, enumeration, pointer, reference, or pointer to member type, and must be constant at compile time. some_algorithm([](auto x){ foo(x);});

ContourPlot does that very efficiently (that is: it uses clever multi-grid methods, not just a brute force fine-grained scan) but just gives me a plot. I would like to have a set of values {x,y} (with some specified resolution) or perhaps some interpolating function which allows me to get access to the location of these contours.

@TITLE:ASP.NET MVC3 add a HtmlFieldPrefix when calling Controller.PartialView
@CONTENT:I am rendering a partial view as part of an Ajax request. When I call the partial view from a view: int i=0;

        TemplateInfo = new System.Web.Mvc.TemplateInfo { HtmlFieldPrefix = string.Format("Rules[{0}]", i) } })   
    i++;
}
 I am able to set the HtmlFieldPrefix to allow for proper Model binding. I want the user to be able to add a new ValidationRuleRow on the fly via ajax, like: $.ajax({
    type: "GET",
    url: "/Monitors/NewMonitorValidationRule",
    success: function (data, textStatus, jqXHR) {
        var element = $(data);
        $("#ValidationRuleContainer").append(element);
    }
});
 So I have an action in my controller to get the HTML: public ActionResult NewMonitorValidationRule()
{
    ValidationRule rule = new ValidationRule{Id = TempSurrogateKey.Next};
    var view = PartialView("ValidationRuleRow", rule);
    // CODE TO SET PartialView field prefix
    return view;
}

@TITLE:Custom stream manipulator for streaming integers in any base
@CONTENT:I can make an std::ostream object output integer numbers in hex, for example std::cout << std::hex << 0xabc; //prints `abc`, not the base-10 representation
 Is there any manipulator that is universal for all bases? Something like std::cout << std::base(4) << 20; //I want this to output 110
 If there is one, then I have no further question. If there isn't one, then can I write one? Won't it require me to access private implementation details of std::ostream? Note that I know I can write a function that takes a number and converts it to a string which is the representation of that number in any base. Or I can use one that already exists. I am asking about custom stream manipulators - are they possible? Thanks in advance
@CODE:std::ostream std::cout << std::hex << 0xabc; //prints `abc`, not the base-10 representation std::cout << std::base(4) << 20; //I want this to output 110 std::ostream 50 std::cout << std::base(4) << 20 50 110 "50" Custom stream manipulator for streaming integers in any base Custom stream manipulator

@LINK:/questions/6198664/more-than-one-rkobjectmanager-at-a-time-restkit
@TITLE:More than one RKObjectManager at a time (RestKit)
@CONTENT:I am testing out RestKit and need to access different BaseUrls and also sometimes access a web service with the same baseUrl from different places "at once", lastly I also need to access the same baseUrl with different ressourcePaths in the same controller. In my app delegate I set up the RKObjectManager singleton like this. RKObjectManager *objectManager = [RKObjectManager objectManagerWithBaseURL:kBaseUrl];
[objectManager registerClass:[EntityClass1 class] forElementNamed:@"element1"];
[objectManager registerClass:[EntityClass2 class] forElementNamed:@"element2"];
.
.
.
etc.
 The singleton approach is really easy to work with, I however can't figure out how to separate the different web service calls. In MyViewController, which implement the RKObjectLoaderDelegate, I will have the two methods: - (void)objectLoader:(RKObjectLoader *)objectLoader didLoadObjects:(NSArray *)objects         {
    //stuff with result
}

- (void)objectLoader:(RKObjectLoader *)objectLoader didFailWithError:(NSError *)error {
    //stuff with error    
}
 This causes no problems when MyViewController uses one RKObjectManager singleton to access one ressourcePath with one baseUrl. If I start different requests in this way: [[RKObjectManager sharedManager] loadObjectsAtResourcePath:FLICKRPath delegate:self]
[[RKObjectManager sharedManager] loadObjectsAtResourcePath:FOURSQUAREPath delegate:self]
 and so on, within the same MyController, my problem is that FLICKRPath and FOURSQUAREPath of course has different baseUrl, but the RKObjectManager only has one? If I get this working and can have different RKObjectManagers another problem arises. The delegate methods didLoadObjects and didFailWithError will receive results from both RKObjectManagers and I can't see any other way to tell them apart than from their baseUrls. Potentially comparing each return value with a baseUrl and, even worse, a ressourcePath, in the delegate method does not appeal to me at all. If I have different RKObjectManagers I guess I could pass them different delegates and build classes dedicated to deal with the return values from different baseUrls and ressourcePaths. This would mean I had to build yet another abstraction on top of MyController and RestKit, which also seems messy. I have a strong feeling I am going about this in the wrong way, the RestKit source is very impressive which indicates that is me fighting the framework. I would really appreciate some best practice insights on the subject. I have been through all the resources and examples that I could find but have not seen the above use case. It is always one RKObjectManager, one baseUrl and one ressourcePath. Thank you in advance.
