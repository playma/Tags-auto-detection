@TITLE:How to enter long SQL text sample data with Visual Studio?
@CONTENT:The Server Explorer built into Visual Studio is a nice way to connect to your database, view existing data, and edit data. Very useful for entering sample data into a database for testing and development purposes. However, what if you have a "text" column and want to enter a long text field? For example, I have a text column in which I want to store a multi-line XML value. I'd like to be able to do multi-line editing from within the table data viewer. I can't figure out how to do that? Does anyone know if it can be done, and if so, how?

@TITLE:Runtime exec and a custom built RTF editor
@CONTENT:I have a class that manages the creation of RTF documents and a method in that class that calls the RTF editor with a XML file for display. All but one user can access this editor without any issues. This one user consistently runs into an issue where their application just hangs. There are no errors in any logs. Normally this kind of problem is easily identified, reproduced and corrected, however, I can't for the life of my reproduce it so my attempts at debugging are failing. Basically the code is as follows: int exitVal = CUBSRTFEditor.runRTFEditor("c:\\tmp\\control"+ap_doc_id+".xml", xml,"I:\\AppealsLetters.exe /process \"c:\\tmp\\control"+ap_doc_id+".xml\"");

public static int runRTFEditor(String xmlLocation, String xmlContent, String executePath)
{
    int exitVal = 0;
    createLocalFile(xmlLocation, xmlContent);

    try
    {
        System.out.println("executePath must = "+executePath);
        Runtime rt = Runtime.getRuntime();
        Process proc = rt.exec(executePath);
        System.out.println("after executePath runs");

        //exhaust that stream before waiting for the process to exit
        InputStream inputstream = proc.getInputStream();
        InputStreamReader inputstreamreader = new InputStreamReader(inputstream);
        BufferedReader bufferedreader = new BufferedReader(inputstreamreader);
        // read the ls output
        String line;
        while ((line = bufferedreader.readLine())!= null)
        {
            System.out.println(line);
        }
        exitVal = proc.waitFor();
    }
    catch (Throwable t)
    {
        t.printStackTrace();
    }

    CUBSRTFEditor.deleteTempFile(xmlLocation);

    return exitVal;
}
 The last output is the first System.out. When I take the xml file and execute this on any other PC it executes without issue. I see no useful info in proc.getErrorStream() or proc.getOutputStream(). The JDK's Javadoc documentation on this problem (exec hanging): Because some native platforms only provide limited buffer size for standard input and output streams, failure to promptly write the input stream or read the output stream of the subprocess may cause the subprocess to block, and even deadlock. I try exhausting that stream before waiting for the process to exit and that does not seem to help as it never seems to get to that point (the second System.out is not displayed) Have I implemented this incorrectly? Am I missing something important? Any ideas on how to get more info out of the process would be great. I am stuck....

@LINK:/questions/830520/ajax-not-returning-data
@TITLE:$.ajax not returning data
@CONTENT:I am trying to POST data back to the server and get a dataset back. What I am getting back instead is the HTML for the whole page AND it is not kicking off the Action in my Controller. And yes - JQuery is still confusing to me. The code I currently have is: function updateNavIndex(pageIndex) {
    var filters = $("form").serialize();
    var productGroup = $("#valProductGroup").attr('title');
    var productType = $("#valProductType").attr('title');
    var itemsPerPage = $("#ItemsPerPage").val();

    $.ajax({ path: "/CatalogAjaxController/UpdateNavigation"
          , type: "POST"
          , data: "{ productGroup: " + productGroup + ", productType: " + productType + ", itemsPerPage: " + itemsPerPage + ", pageIndex: " + pageIndex + ", filters: " + filters + "}"
          , success: function(data) { handleMenuData(data); }
    });
    $.ajax({ path: "/CatalogAjaxController/UpdateProducts"
          , type: "POST"
          , data: "{ productGroup: " + productGroup + ", productType: " + productType + ", itemsPerPage: " + itemsPerPage + ", pageIndex: " + pageIndex + ", filters: " + filters + "}"
          , success: function(data) { handleProductData(data); }
    });
}
 The callback function is tripping and the function definition looks like: function handleMenuData(data) {
    $("#navigation ul").remove();
    }
 At this point the "data" variable has the Page HTML in it. (And like I said, the Action did not fire off.) I am thinking that I should not be calling the $ajax function directly but using a var function definition. Something like: var retrieveMenuData = function(path, productGroup, productType, itemsPerPage, pageIndex, filter, fnHandleCallback) {
    $.ajax( path
          , type
          , { productGroup: productGroup, productType: productType, itemsPerPage: itemsPerPage, pageIndex: pageIndex, filter: filter }
          , function(data) { fnHandleCallback(data); });
};
 I'm not sure if I have it defined correctly or how to call it correctly. ANy help is appreciated!
@CODE:function updateNavIndex(pageIndex) {
    var filters = $("form").serialize();
    var productGroup = $("#valProductGroup").attr('title');

@TITLE:Issue with WPF Focus
@CONTENT:I have code that handles the LostFocus event of my controls. It validates the value and in some cases will enable a subsequent control. For instance, there might be a ComboBox that allows a user to select a country. The subsequent ComboBox allows the user to select a state. IF the currently selected country is not the USA, the state ComboBox is disabled. If the user selects "USA" and then tabs out of the combo box, the LostFocus code enables the state ComboBox. However, the State ComboBox does not get focus, instead focus goes to the control that follows the State ComboBox. I've tried using the PreviewLostKeyboardFocus to handle the event instead with no luck. I'm kind of at a loss as to figuring out someway to hack WPF to get this work. Any suggestions?

@TITLE:c++ loop macros
@CONTENT:I use macros to code unrolled loops like this: (silly example) #define foreach_small_prime(p, instr) {   \
  int p;                                  \
  p = 2; instr;                           \

  p = 7; instr;                           \
}

foreach_small_prime(pp, cout << pp);

int sum = 0;
foreach_small_prime(pp, {
  sum += pp;
  if (sum >= 10) cout << sum << endl;
});
 But in some cases I might use for construct: #define foreach_small_even(ii) for(int ii = 0; ii < 20; ii += 2)

int sum = 0;
foreach_small_even(pp) {
  sum += pp;
  if (sum >= 10) cout << sum << endl;
}
 I like this macros because I can pass a variable name as a parameter. Question: Is there a way to define loop like the first one in a for-like syntax like the second macro?
@CODE:#define foreach_small_prime(p, instr) {   \
  int p;                                  \

@TITLE:Determine DDL value for dynamic column creation in oninit event
@CONTENT:Greetings, hopefully there is a simple solution for this complex problem. Please correct any misconceptions I have along the way. A while ago I wrote a GrivView with dynamic column capability. The columns are added in the OnInit page event so that they are added BEFORE the viewstate is applied. They are reapplied on every posting in this section of the page so that when the viewstate is applied changes that the user has made and not committed to the database are maintained. It also is required if you don・t want your viewstate control tree to get out of synch and blow everything up. My current problem is that I am now tasked with doing essentially the same thing where the columns will be different based on a Drop Down List (I will recreate the GridView if the ddl changes, and the users will lose all work with a warning). How can I get the ID that is selected in the Drop Down List in the OnInit Event? My understanding is that when the user changes the value of the ddl on the client side a JavaScript ：__doPostBack； call is fired. The page request is then sent to the server but by the time the new value is present in the event handler I am past the point where I need to add the columns. I saw something I thought was promising when people were trying to determine what control caused a post back but that code relies on page.Request.Params.Get("__EVENTTARGET"); and page.Request.Form which are empty. Should I look at the session state, try to ．send・ the ID using client side manipulation, or some other method (Perhaps a sneaky way to look in the viewstate I am missing)? Thanks for any ideas!!!

@TITLE:How does one customize VS 2008 Database Item Templates?
@CONTENT:Whereas there is a set of richly informative pages describing Visual Studio templates for code projects (projects and items) in MSDN, there doesn't seem to be a thing for database projects. If I am wrong, please steer me in the right direction. I have VS2008 Professional. Anyway, my question has to do with the new database items. Presently, the folder C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\Common7\Tools\Templates\Database Project Items contains 6 template files and one other file, NewDataItems.vsdir, which seems to help control how VS uses these 6 templates. I want to create a new template for stored procedures, and I note that if I merely copy the default template and modify it with a new name, it does show up in the Add New Item dialog, but it doesn't use the same icon as the other items. It does work, but I can't help wondering if I appropriately modify the NewDataItems.vsdir file to include it, I could get it to look the same as the other items in the dialog.

 It's unclear to me what the various elements of this file are supposed to mean, but it looks like the numbered items (#6308, 30, 1052, etc) may control some aspect of the presentation in the dialog. Can someone explain the elements of this file and how to make changes and additions? Also, the default template New Stored Procedure Script.sql is actually presented in the dialog as "Stored Procedure Script". If I copy and paste New Stored Procedure Script.sql as Special Stored Procedure Script.sql without doing anything more, a new item with an icon different from the original shows up, and when selected and Added goes into the project as expected. But how do I make the icon the same as for the default, and how do I make the name of the item in the dialog something of my choice rather than the filename? ReplyQuote

@TITLE:Trouble calling an applet method from page
@CONTENT:I know it's not optimal, but I have to work with it, a page making calls to the applet. My problem is, when I do so, I recieve a rather cryptic error message: "uncaught exception: Error calling method on NPObject! [plugin exception: java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException]." Can anyone decode this? Even multiple possibilities would be better than the junk I came up with. The basic call to the applet is from a javascript call: document.getElementById('my_applet').passData("pass some data", someOtherData);
 As you can see, the passData method is the exposed method I am trying to use. The applet itself works fine on the page, it's just when I try to call this, it doesn't do anything except throw that error. If I ask the person working on the applet (it's not my portion) is it possible for them to add constructive error throwing or am I not even at the point of connecting to the applet yet?

@TITLE:Changing database collation doesnt update collation of varchar/text fields in the DB (MS SQL)
@CONTENT:I changed the collation of the database. All of the text/varchar columns before the change were set to database default. When the change was made to the DB collation, I would have expected the columns that were set to database default to remain database default and therefore remain linked to the new DB collation. However, I noticed that these columns were actually changed to be specifically set to the old collation. I do have a script that will update all the columns, but I'm intrigued as to why these columns didn't remain database_default or at the least get set to the new collation. So the questions I have are: 1: Why did the columns not get updated? 2: Is there a way to get them to automatically update?

@TITLE:How can you tell if you're on the Main UI thread? (In CF)
@CONTENT:Now unfortunately due to the fact that WinCE Usb Device Arrival / Removal exposes itself via WindowsMessages I have to ensure that a certain (non-UI) component is not created on a background thread. I would like to assert this via an exception but am lacking the code for the assertion. This component creates a MessageWindow* and uses it to receive usb arrived/removed messages. The issue is if someone creates this component on a background thread (not necessarily; IsBackground = true) when the thread exits the window will be destroyed. Any ideas? *as an aside I still don't know why Form doesn't inherit from this class Update I think my version 1 wasn't very clear. So this is v2. When you create a MessageWindow or a Form for that matter on a thread, when that thread exits the Window/Form is destroyed. My component is creating a "hidden" message window to intercept some important events, ergo I do not wish for it to be destroyed. Therefore I must somehow ensure that the code that creates the form is running on the "Main UI" thread. If possible i'd like to avoid passing down a reference to the "main" form to this component as it is (architecturally speaking) supposed to be miles away from the UI.

@CONTENT:I am running into what seems to me to be a bug in the Advantage Database PHP Extension (I know, I know...). I've reported it as a bug, but still haven't heard anything back, so I thought I'd run it by you guys. Working Code: for ($i = 0; $i < 100; $i++)
{
    $connection = ads_connect( 'DataDirectory=\\some\path\;ServerTypes=2;RightsChecking=Off;TrimTrailingSpaces=true;CommType=TCP_IP;', '', '' );

    $results = ads_do( $connection , 'SELECT TOP 1 * FROM projects');

    ads_close( $connection );
}
 This just loops through 100 times, connects to the db, executes a query, and disconnects. NON-Working Code: for ($i = 0; $i < 100; $i++)
{
    $connection = ads_connect( 'DataDirectory=\\some\path\;ServerTypes=2;RightsChecking=Off;TrimTrailingSpaces=true;CommType=TCP_IP;', '', '' );

    $results = ads_do( $connection , 'SELECT TOP 1 * FROM projects');
    $results = ads_do( $connection , 'SELECT TOP 1 * FROM projects');

    ads_close( $connection );
}
 Notice the second query execution? This loop fails on the 51st cycle (the db server limits each application to 50 simultaneous connections) with the error Error 6303: Maximum Advantage Database Server connections exceeded. I've tried several other things including this with no success: for ($i = 0; $i < 100; $i++)
{
    $connection = ads_connect( 'DataDirectory=\\some\path\;ServerTypes=2;RightsChecking=Off;TrimTrailingSpaces=true;CommType=TCP_IP;', '', '' );

    $results = ads_do( $connection , 'SELECT TOP 1 * FROM projects');
    ads_free_result( $results );

    $results = ads_do( $connection , 'SELECT TOP 1 * FROM projects');
    ads_free_result( $results );

    ads_close( $connection );
}
 This, however, DOES fix the problem, and BOTH queries still execute successfully and accurately!! for ($i = 0; $i < 100; $i++)
{
    $connection = ads_connect( 'DataDirectory=\\some\path\;ServerTypes=2;RightsChecking=Off;TrimTrailingSpaces=true;CommType=TCP_IP;', '', '' );

    $results = ads_do( $connection , 'SELECT TOP 1 * FROM projects');
    ads_close( $connection );

    $results = ads_do( $connection , 'SELECT TOP 1 * FROM projects');
    ads_close( $connection );	
}
 This all seems very odd to me... any ideas? EDIT: I am on PHP 5.2.5 and ADS 8.1
@CODE:for ($i = 0; $i < 100; $i++)
{
    $connection = ads_connect( 'DataDirectory=\\some\path\;ServerTypes=2;RightsChecking=Off;TrimTrailingSpaces=true;CommType=TCP_IP;', '', '' );

    $results = ads_do( $connection , 'SELECT TOP 1 * FROM projects');

{
    $connection = ads_connect( 'DataDirectory=\\some\path\;ServerTypes=2;RightsChecking=Off;TrimTrailingSpaces=true;CommType=TCP_IP;', '', '' );

    $results = ads_do( $connection , 'SELECT TOP 1 * FROM projects');

@LINK:/questions/819515/mono-system-io-ports-serialport-class-error-handling
@TITLE:Mono System.IO.Ports SerialPort class error handling
@CONTENT:I am debugging some mono code that is using the serial port. At some point the mono write a table with the following code :    // Send the 1024 byte (256 word) CRC table

    progressBar = new ProgressBar();

    progressBar.Update(0.0,"Sending CRC table...");

    for (int i = 0; i < MyCRC.Length; i++)

    {

        MySP.Write(MyCRC[i].ToString("x8"));

        progressBar.Percent = (((Double)(i+1))/MyCRC.Length);

    }

    progressBar.Update(100.0,"CRC table sent.");
 MySP is a SerialPort instance. When I trace this code using strace however, here is what I think are the resulting system calls : 16620 write(3, "3ab551ce", 8)           = -1 EAGAIN (Resource temporarily unavailable)
16620 write(3, "\0003ab551c", 8)        = -1 EAGAIN (Resource temporarily unavailable)
16620 write(3, "\0\0003ab551", 8)       = -1 EAGAIN (Resource temporarily unavailable)
16620 write(3, "\0\0\0003ab55", 8)      = -1 EAGAIN (Resource temporarily unavailable)
16620 write(3, "\10\0\0\0003ab5", 8)    = -1 EAGAIN (Resource temporarily unavailable)
16620 write(3, "\0\10\0\0\0003ab", 8)   = -1 EAGAIN (Resource temporarily unavailable)

...

16620 write(3, "\0005\0\230O+\10\0", 8) = -1 EAGAIN (Resource temporarily unavailable)
16620 write(3, "E\0005\0\230O+\10", 8)  = -1 EAGAIN (Resource temporarily unavailable)
16620 write(3, "\0E\0005\0\230O+", 8)   = -1 EAGAIN (Resource temporarily unavailable)
16620 write(3, "\0\0E\0005\0\230O", 8)  = -1 EAGAIN (Resource temporarily unavailable)
16620 write(3, "\0\0\0E\0005\0\230", 8) = -1 EAGAIN (Resource temporarily unavailable)
16620 write(3, "4\0\0\0E\0005\0", 8)    = 8
16620 write(3, "\230O+\10\0\0\0\0", 8)  = 8
16620 write(3, "\0\0\0\0\10\0\0\0", 8)  = -1 EAGAIN (Resource temporarily unavailable)
 My understanding is that the SerialPort Write method dos not handle the -EAGAIN case correctly and updates the index by -1 before restarting the write. because after each try, the content of the original buffer is shifted by one byte. My question is, is it a known problem, and how can I modify the SerialPort class so that it behaves correctly or use the serial port in a blocking way ? The Mono documentation for the SerialPort class is not very helpful Additional Info : mono -V output: Mono JIT compiler version 1.2.6 (tarball)

It fails out but when i try to call an insert new row formated just the same it works. $result = mysql_query("INSERT INTO auth (username, password, studycode, description, server) VALUES ('$username', '$password', '$studycode', '$description', '$server')");
 but this code fails $result = mysql_query("UPDATE auth SET username='$username', password='$password', studycode='$studycode', description='$description', server='$server' WHERE index='$id' LIMIT 1;");
 index is the first column and its the key/id for the table. Edit: Ok so i just went into mysql admin and tried the exact command my code would have sent to track the error. UPDATE auth SET username='username', password='password', studycode='ab9102y', description='test change', server='server2' WHERE index='5' LIMIT 1;
 gives me the error #1064 - You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'index='5' LIMIT 1' at line 1

@TITLE:Can I set ShowDialog() to not be topmost?
@CONTENT:Is there a way I can set a ShowDialog() to not be topmost? I've looked at all the related SO questions, and none quite matched my situation. What I do is open a new WinForm from a datagridview button column. This new form pulls information from a few SQLite tables and allows the user to add information to the row the button was clicked. I open the WinForm using the code below. I use the ShowDialog() method so I can tell if the user saves the information in the form or cancels it. Pay_Bill_Window paywindow = new Pay_Bill_Window(getClickedRowID);
if (paywindow.ShowDialog() == DialogResult.OK)
{
    FillPendingPaymentDataGrid(dbAccess.GetPendingBills());
}
 I do this so I can tell if I need to reload the information in the datagridview. The information the user can fill into the window is from other sources, like a web browser, so having the form be on top of all applications is not ideal. Is there a way I can stop the window from being on top of all applications (top-most in my series of windows is fine), or is there a way to tell what button a user clicks on another form (basically, using paywindow.Show() and watching for a different type of return)? Thanks for any help!

@TITLE:C# Multiple Linq Query Search Issue
@CONTENT:I have multiple linq queries for searching a database of information based on a single specific piece of criteria per query. e.g. by ID or by Name etc. Currently, the user can search by use of only one query method. The problem is that I want the user to be able to search using multiple criteria, without having to write new queries that combine the criteria from multiple queries. For Example: Below I have a query that returns a set of questions based on the department name that they are stored under, and another query that returns a set of questions based on the module title that the questions are stored under. Since currently the user can only search by department name or by module title - e.g. Computer Science or Distributed Systems, I would like to change this so that the user can specify something like: Return all questions that are of DepartmentName == Computer Science && ModuleTitle == Distributed Systems.

 I'd like my result to only include ID's for those rows in the list. i.e. 12,13,14. My first thought is to loop through the list and do a select. ie. for the first value being 1, I grab all records with a 1 (true) in col1 (resulting in record 12). Then move onto the second value being 2 and grab all records with a 1 (true) in col2 (resulting in record 14) and so on.. I'm wondering if there's a more efficient/better/cleaner way to do this?

These are not things I should expect an end-user to have installed. Ideally the process should be the user installs the new version of the app, launches it and it takes care of everything behind the scene. Depending on how long the process takes I may or may not show a progress bar, and then it's done, the use the app normally blissfully unaware that there's such as thing as sql, msbuild, relational database, or anything even remotely technical sounding. Other misc info: SQLCE that's xcopy installed. Single user database that most likely shouldn't be too large. Releases will be fairly frequent with the program evolving through user input on requested features. Initial release isn't done yet, so don't need to worry about any current data, just need a painless process for initial and subsequent releases (for the end-user, preferably for me as well!). Using LINQ to SQL as ORM. (Do I upgrade the database first then run SQLMetal to regenerate the classes?) Doing TDD (for the first time) and wondering how to automate testing upgrades. Visual C# Express so no VS plugins. Edit: I guess MSBuild comes with the .NET Framework and not just VS, so I guess this is a non-issue and I can just use migratordotnet and just shell out to msbuild. If needed I could probably redirect console output and do some naive string parsing to get progress info, but I'll resort to that if it looks like it's taking long enough to warrant displaying actual progress instead of just a marquee progress bar.

@TITLE:AS3 retrieving xml from aspx page
@CONTENT:I'm an AS3 noob on training wheels... I have an XML Loader class which is doing what it's supposed to with a test.xml file, however I need the flash to read the xml written by an aspx file. So I tried: var urlRequest:URLRequest = new URLRequest("../xml/CaseStudyFlashAssets.aspx");
 I get error #1090 (which I gather is because the aspx is not xml and it doesn't like it) Can anyone help me get to the xml written by the aspx file? Thanks Mikey

@TITLE:Spanish voice for System.Speech.Synthesis and TTSEngine
@CONTENT:I have successfully managed to get System.Speech.Synthesis to read English text in arbitrary voices Anna and Sam. My next task is to localize my application to correctly read Spanish text to our Spanish-speaking clientele. However, I don't think I am asking the right questions, b/c I cannot find in documentation, forum, group or technology write-up any clear explanation on how this might be done. 1st: Am I correct in saying that there is no setting on the SpeechSynthesizer class or any other Text-To-Speech object? In other words, is it only a matter of installing the correct voice that will read with a Spanish "accent"? 2nd: How does one do this? I have seen links for Spanish libraries that I have tried installing, but I am never able to see these new voices in my Windows XP Speech control panel or in my application's GetInstalledVoices() call. I am using .Net 3.5 SP 1 one Windows XP SP3, and my code is using Visual Studio 2..8. If I am missing details, please let me know. I would appreciate any help. V

@TITLE:Save JFrame location in multi-display environment
@CONTENT:I want to store a JFrame's location (bounds, extendedState) when the user closes it. However, when the user moves the frame onto the 2nd screen and maximizes it, how can I store that information? My naive (and single display) implementation is like this: 
void saveFrame(JFrame frame) throws IOException {
    Properties props = new Properties();
    props.setProperty("State", String.valueOf(frame.getExtendedState()));
    props.setProperty("X", String.valueOf(frame.getX()));
    props.setProperty("Y", String.valueOf(frame.getY()));
    props.setProperty("W", String.valueOf(frame.getWidth()));
    props.setProperty("H", String.valueOf(frame.getHeight()));
    props.storeToXML(new FileOutputStream("config.xml"), null);
}
void loadFrame(JFrame frame) throws IOException {
    Properties props = new Properties();
    props.loadFromXML(new FileInputStream("config.xml"));
    int extendedState = Integer.parseInt(props.getProperty("State", String.valueOf(frame.getExtendedState())));
    if (extendedState != JFrame.MAXIMIZED_BOTH) {
        frame.setBounds(
            Integer.parseInt(props.getProperty("X", String.valueOf(frame.getX()))),
            Integer.parseInt(props.getProperty("Y", String.valueOf(frame.getY()))),
            Integer.parseInt(props.getProperty("W", String.valueOf(frame.getWidth()))),
            Integer.parseInt(props.getProperty("H", String.valueOf(frame.getHeight())))
        );
    } else {
        frame.setExtendedState(JFrame.MAXIMIZED_BOTH);
    }
}
 How can I discover on which screen the frame is located? How can I move a frame to the second screen and maximize it there?

@TITLE:Do I want to minimize the scope of @Transactional?
@CONTENT:Not sure if 'scope' is the correct term here. I am using Spring for JPA transaction management (with a Hibernate underneath). My method to preform database transaction is private, but since you can only set @Transactional on a class or on a public method Since this mechanism is based on proxies, only 'external' method calls coming in through the proxy will be intercepted. This means that 'self-invocation', i.e. a method within the target object calling some other method of the target object, won't lead to an actual transaction at runtime even if the invoked method is marked with @Transactional! I have set the public entry point of the class as @Transactional. @Transactional
public void run(parameters) {
    //First non-database method, takes a decent amount of time
    Data data = getData();
    //Call to database
    storeData(data);
}

private storeData(data) {
    em.persist(data);
}
 Is this bad practice? Is Spring keep an open transaction for longer then needed here? I was thinking of move the storeData() method to a DAO class and making it public, but as academic point, I wanted to know if refactoring to public would have any performance benefit.

@TITLE:Strict doctype preventing access to DOM variable in FireFox
@CONTENT:I don't know if this is a well known 'thing' or something new in whatever version of Firefox it just updated itself too - but in either case I have no idea how to google for this question so I'll have to ask it here. I have a DIV in my DOM that I am trying to directly access by id, in the most simplest form like this:  alert(btnTest.id);
 This works fine in all browsers, but was causing issues in firefox that actually led to the browser being in a strange 'broken' state. The error I was getting was 'btnTest is not defined'. I did not get this error in Safari, Internet Explorer or Chrome. I assumed I had mismatched HTML tags, or javascript curly braces or something else missing. Eventually after stripping everything out I tried removing the DOCTYPE. Suddenly in Firefox (v 3.0.10) it started returning the correct ID as expected. What is going on!!! ?? Surely 'strict' mode should allow me to access named elements, and if not then why do all the other browsers let me. Note: I can easily work around it with $('#btnTest')[0].id, which is what I'm going to have to do now until i can figure out a better solution.  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">

@TITLE:How To Implement Shared Behavior Between Classes (Without Multiple Inheritance Of Course) in C#
@CONTENT:UPDATE: So pretty much everyone here told me that i just need to start over again on how i designed my classes (thank you folks for your excellent answers by the way!). Taking the hint, i started doing extensive reading on the strategy pattern. I want to create behavior classes (or strategy classes) that inherit from an abstract base classes. The Candidate class would then have properties w/ the different abstract base classes as the types for the behaviors or strategies. maybe something like this: public abstract class SalaryStrategy {
    public abstract decimal Salary { get; set; }
    public abstract decimal Min { get; set; }
    public abstract decimal Mid { get; set; }
    public decimal CompaRatio {
        get {
            if (this.Mid == 0) { return 0; }
            else { return this.Salary / this.Mid; }
        }
    }
}

public class InternalCurrentSalaryStrategy {
    public override decimal Salary { get; set; }
    public override decimal Min {
        get { return this.Salary * .25m; }
        set { }
    }
    public override decimal Mid { get; set; }
}

public class Candidate {
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public SalaryStrategy CurrentSalaryStrategy { get; set; }
}

public static void Main(string[] args) {
    var internal = new Candidate();
    internal.CurrentSalaryStrategy = new InternalCurrentSalaryStrategy();
    var internalElp = new Candidate();
    internalElp.CurrentSalaryStrategy = new InternalCurrentSalaryStrategy();
    var elp = new Candidate();
    // elp.CurrentSalaryStrategy can stay null cause it's not used for elps
}
 Any comments or suggestions? ORIGINAL Question: I am trying to learn and become more proficient at design patterns and principles. I have am currently working on a design for few classes that has stumped me. Here's a very condensed version of the code: public class Candidate {
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Comments { get; set; }
    // lots more properties and behaviors...
}

public class InternalCandidate : Candidate {
    public decimal CurrentMid { get; set; }
    public decimal CurrentMax {
         get { return this.CurrentMin * 1.3m;
    }
    // lots more properties and behaviors...
}

public class EntryLevelCandidate : Candidate {
    public string Gpa { get; set; }
    // lots more properties and behaviors...
}

public class InternalEntryLevelCandidate /* what do I inherit here??? */ {
    // needs all of the properties and behaviors of
    // EntryLevelCandidate but also needs the CurrentMin and
    // CurrentMax (and possibly more) in InternalCandidate
}
 The InternalEntryLevelCandidate class is primarily an EntryLevelCandidate but needs to share some of the implementations of InternalCandidate. I say implementations because I don't want the implementations to be different or repeated, otherwise I would use an interface for common contracts and have concrete implementations in each class. Some of the implementations of the InternalCandidate properties and behaviors need to be common or shared. I have read about C++ and Ruby mixins, which seem to be something similar to what I what I want to do. I also read this interesting blog post that discusses an idea for a behavior type where a class would be able to inherit multiple behaviors while still maintaining a single "is a" relationship: http://www.deftflux.net/blog/post/A-good-design-for-multiple-implementation-inheritance.aspx. This seems to convey what I am wanting. Can anyone give me some direction on how I can accomplish this using good design practices?

    public abstract decimal Salary { get; set; }
    public abstract decimal Min { get; set; }
    public abstract decimal Mid { get; set; }

        get {
            if (this.Mid == 0) { return 0; }
            else { return this.Salary / this.Mid; }
        }
    }
}

    public override decimal Salary { get; set; }
    public override decimal Min {
        get { return this.Salary * .25m; }

    }

@CONTENT:I have a .NET system where I need to allow files to be locked and unlocked across process boundaries. The model I plan to use is this: User generate a lock token Uses Locks a file with token and refreshes token repeat at #2 as needed Uses unlocks all files by releasing token If uses fails to refresh token in some time-frame, #4 happens automatically Each step can be done from a different process. The question is two fold: is this a reasonable model and are there any readily available tools for implementing it? If this can't be directly done in the OS, I'm thinking of some sort of advisory locking with .files or the like. Edit: this mode gets non-exclusive read locks, but other modes could get exclusive write locks but they would always be released by the same process that got them.

@TITLE:Merge two lists of lists - Python
@CONTENT:This is a great primer but doesn't answer what I need: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/464342/combining-two-sorted-lists-in-python I have two Python lists, each is a list of datetime,value pairs: list_a = [['1241000884000', 3], ['1241004212000', 4], ['1241006473000', 11]]
 And: list_x = [['1241000884000', 16], ['1241000992000', 16], ['1241001121000', 17], ['1241001545000', 19], ['1241004212000', 20], ['1241006473000', 22]]
 There are actually numerous list_a lists with different key/values. All list_a datetimes are in list_x. I want to make a list, list_c, corresponding to each list_a which has each datetime from list_x and value_a/value_x. Bonus: In my real program, list_a is actually a list within a dictionary like so. Taking the answer to the dictionary level would be: dict = {object_a: [['1241000884000', 3], ['1241004212000', 4], ['1241006473000', 11]], object_b: [['1241004212000', 2]]}

 This is on Informix, and the byte column is a simple large object. Now normally I would query the table with "SELECT ID, Name, (image is not null) as imageexists..." and handle the blob load later. I can construct my object model to have two different classes (and thus two different map definitions) to handle the relationship, but how can I "fool" nhibernate into using the same table to show this one-to-one relationship?

@TITLE:Struggling to come up with a generic C# method that compares different types of numeric objects
@CONTENT:I have an Infragistics UltraNumericEditor (version 5.3, quite old) control on a form. If I set the .Value field to something less than .MinValue or something more than .MaxValue then I get a System.Exception thrown with the following message: The 'Value' property cannot be set to a value that is outside the range determined by the 'MinValue' and 'MaxValue' properties The signatures of the relevant fields on UltraNumericEditor are as follows: public object MinValue { get; set; }
public object MaxValue { get; set; }    
public object Value { get; set; }
 This has potential to occur many hundreds of times through our codebase, so rather than check MinValue and MaxValue vs the value we're trying to set every time, I thought I'd subclass the control and put the check there: public class OurNumericEditor : Infragistics.Win.UltraWinEditors.UltraNumericEditor  
{  
    public object Value  
    {
        get
        {
            return base.Value;
        }
        set
        {
            // make sure what we're setting isn't outside the min or max
            // if it is, set value to the min or max instead

            double min = (double)base.MinValue;
            double max = (double)base.MaxValue;
            double attempted = (double)value;

            if (attempted > max)
                base.Value = max;
            else if (attempted < min)
                base.Value = min;
            else
                base.Value = value;
        }
    }
}
 Clearly this works fine when the type of value, MinValue and MaxValue can be casted to doubles, but I would expect an InvalidCastException when that's not possible. Now I may just be having a blonde moment here but I think it should be possible to write a method that makes use of generics to do the comparison, but I'm struggling to visualise what that might look like. Any ideas or input at all? Thanks Tom

@CONTENT:I need an elegant way to store dynamic arrays (basically spreadsheets without all the functionality) of various sizes (both x and y), mostly being used as ENUMs, lists, lookup data, price sheets, that sort of thing. Multi-lingual would be a great bonus. Speed of the essence. Here's an example of a typical "sheet" ;             |  1 |  2 |   3 |   4

  model A   | 2$ | 5$ |  8$ | 10$
  model B   | 3$ | 6$ |  9$ | 12$

  echo $price ;   // Prints '9$'
 I'm in the PHP5 and Zend Framework world, but thoughts on design and SQL is just as dandy, even suggestions on and from the outside world, libs, extensions, etc. as I don't want to reinvent too much of the wheel. I need the backend stuff the most, and I'll write a GUI for dynamic sheets later. Thoughts, ideas, pointers? Just an edit to point out that I'd prefer not to serialize and blob the data as I would like to query the indeces and sheets, perhaps even the data (or type for those who support such, now that would be awsome!) if I'm in a crazy mood. But again, this is not a breaker for me; if someone has a nice library or class for serializing in and out quickly out of a database with some simple querying, I'm all happy.

@CONTENT:I'd like to have tables that can dynamically collapse some rows in a web page, such as: 
    |   Title   |   Foo   |   Bar   |
    ---------------------------------
    | + My First Section            |
    ---------------------------------
    | + My Second Section           |
    ---------------------------------
 can dynamically expand to 
    |   Title   |   Foo   |   Bar   |
    ---------------------------------
    | - My First Section            |
    ---------------------------------
    | 1st Title |    42   |  $10.00 |
    ---------------------------------
    | 2nd Title |    74   |  $12.00 |
    ---------------------------------
    | + My Second Section           |
    ---------------------------------
 when I press on the + sign. Are there any JavaScript libraries that could help me do such a thing, or is there some magic native command that could do it for my easily?

 The problem is that when i draw that bmp image then it differs in color than original. So is there any way to apply lut (lookup table) on that colored images. i want any unsafe code because i tried getixel and setPixel and they are very slow. I also dont want Image.fromSource() methods.

I've managed to do it but it seems I can't use it on server due to licensing problems... The problem with apachepoi and other solutions providing access to word documents info is related to incompleteness of some docs. pageCount property in document summary is sometimes missing (it's often case with odt documents saved as doc and older docs).

@TITLE:Retrieve a list of the most popular GET param variations for a given URL?
@CONTENT:I'm working on building intelligence around link propagation, and because I need to deal with many short URL services where a reverse-lookup from an exact URL address is required, I need to be able to resolve multiple approximate versions of the same URL. An example would be a URL like http://www.example.com?ref=affil&hl=en&ct=0 Of course, changing GET params in certain circumstances can refer to a completely different page, especially if the GET params in question refer to a profile or content ID. But a quick parse of the page would quickly determine how similar the pages were to each other. Using a bit of machine learning, it could quickly become clear which GET params don't effect the content of the pages returned for a given site. I'm assuming a service to send a URL and get a list of very similar URLs could only be offered by the likes of Google or Yahoo (or Twitter), but they don't seem to offer this feature, and I haven't found any other services that do. If you know of any services that do cluster together groups of almost identical URLs in the aforementioned way, please let me know. My bounty is a hug.

@TITLE:makeArray function in Sizzle (jQuery 1.3)
@CONTENT:I've been having a lot of problems with jQuery 1.3.2 on only one of my sites. It's a Joomla site, so Mootools is included on the page as well (and it's too difficult to remove Mootools). Basically the problem is that calling the basic jQuery selector with one selector (eg: "a", ".myClass", not "html a", ".myClass td"), will only return the first element. I've stepped through the code and have narrowed it down to this function in the Sizzle engine: (see for yourself, line 2058 jquery.js) var makeArray = function(array, results) {
    array = Array.prototype.slice.call( array );
    if ( results ) {
        results.push.apply( results, array );
        return results;
    }
    return array;
};
 I'll write it out here again with comments to show the values I've been logging after calling jQuery("a"): var makeArray = function(array, results) {
    // "array" is an array of all the 58 links on the page
    // "results" is an empty jQuery object

    array = Array.prototype.slice.call( array );

    // array is unchanged.

    if ( results ) {   // true
        results.push.apply( results, array );
        // "results" is now an array only holding the FIRST element.
        return results;
    }
    return array;
};
 Can someone explain this code to me? And also why it's getting rid of all but one of my elements??
@CODE:"a", ".myClass" "html a", ".myClass td" var makeArray = function(array, results) {
    array = Array.prototype.slice.call( array );

@TITLE:What is a ：field；? ：Field； vs ：Field Value；
@CONTENT:In a passport there is a field: First Name, and that field has a value John. I assert that it is correct to describe the relationship as follows: Field First Name: Has a name (First Name). Has a set of valid values (e.g. defined by regex [A-Za-z. ]{1,30} Has a description (name that stands first in the person's full name) And Passport is a set of pairs (field : field value), such that: passport has a field "First Name" passport has a value for field "First Name" Point here is that it is incorrect to say: "First Name value is John"; The correct way (conceptually/academically) is to say: "passport has a value 'John' for field 'First Name'". In practical terms it means (pseudo C#): struct Passport {
    Map<Field, object> fieldValues;
}

struct Field {
    string Name;
    string Description; 
    bool IsValidValue(object value);

 where "this" is a MovieClip and textItem is a TextField that is only on the second frame of the movieClip.

I understand that it is trying to access that property before it was completely instantiated, what I don't understand is why it works in FP10 and not FP9?

@TITLE:How to select .NET framework version running from Excel?
@CONTENT:How can I specify that Excel uses the .NET framework version 2.0 when running .NET dlls other than adding an excel.exe.config file to the Office Binary folder? Our application runs in Excel and uses VBA which makes calls into managed code in .NET assemblies. I believe the textbook way of doing this is to add excel.exe.config to the Office binary directory containing: <?xml version="1.0"?>
<configuration>
  <startup>
    <supportedRuntime version="v2.0.50727"/>
  </startup>
</configuration>
 This option is not acceptable for our clients, firstly because they simply won't allow us to add files to the Office directory and even if they did we could not risk breaking some application using .NET v1.1 which is the default choice of Excel. The solution which we thought would work was to copy the Excel.exe file to our own applications directory from the client's Office directory, to add the config file there and execute that file. It works well but we are having serious installation problems where the install script cannot find the correct version of Excel. Plus it's a nasty kludge in the first place. Any ideas would be welcome. I wonder if a layer of unmanaged (non .NET) code in a DLL might work. Some advice on how to do this or some simpler alternative would be appreciated as this is non-trivial. Related: .NET app.config question

@TITLE:Converting a LinqToSql DAL to EntityFramework
@CONTENT:I've got an app that is just over 1yr old but it still evolving and will likely revolve more and more around a growing database schema in the near to mid term. The app was written using LinqToSql which has met our needs fairly well. We have run into a few pain points but have worked around them. I would currently consider this app to have fairly minimal database demands. Now that the EntityFramework appears to be the ORM Microsoft is pushing people towards I'm wondering if it isn't inevitable that we will want to migrate in that direction. I have heard a lot of good and bad about EntityFramework. So I am wondering if I would be better of taking the plunge now or waiting for v2.0 when VS10 arrives? Any thoughts? Will I lose any functionality if I do it now? If I were to decide to migrate, can anyone point me at some resources on what is involved? Thanks!

@TITLE:DataGridView: How to select first cell in current row when MultiSelect is true
@CONTENT:I am creating my DataGridViewEx class, inherited from DataGridView. I want to create a method for selecting first cell in a current row, so I wrote this:     	/// <summary>
	/// The method selects first visible cell in a current row.
	/// If current row is null, nothing is done. 
	/// If any cells are selected, they are unselected before selecting first cell.
	/// </summary>
	public void SelectFirstCellInCurrentRow()
	{
		if (CurrentRow == null) return;

		ClearSelection();
		foreach (DataGridViewCell cell in CurrentRow.Cells)
		{
			if (cell.Visible)
			{
				cell.Selected = true;
				return;
			}
		}
	}
 And I want to use it like this for example:  	private void btnAdd_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
    	{
    		bindingSource.Add(new Customer());
    		bindingSource.MoveLast();
    		grid.SelectFirstCellInCurrentRow();
    		grid.BeginEdit(false);
    	} My task is to add a new row to the grid and start editing its first cell. This code works fine if grid.MultiSelect = false, but if grid.MultiSelect = true, then it doesn't work as expected: all cells are deselected, first cell of the last row is selected, but !!! the cell in last row on column that was last selected gets edited, instead of first cell! This is how it looks: 1) I select some cells: _http://img13.imageshack.us/img13/2528/beforeadd.gif 2) After I press Add button: _http://img211.imageshack.us/img211/847/afteradd.gif Thank you in advance.

@TITLE:Do you use lock in your web applications?
@CONTENT:After posting this question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/781189/how-to-lock-on-an-integer-in-c Many of the answers made me feel that I'm a 'sinner' for using lock in my web apps. I never thought this is a problem (if used wisely), what about you? Do you ever use it in your web applications? I don't see how a web application can be written without locking, for example if you want to load some data from a database and you want to be sure that no other thread will load it (also for singletons), normally you use locking, for example: private _locker =  new object();
private YourClass[] _data;
public YourClass[] Data
{
    get
    {
        if(_data == null)
        {
            lock( _locker)
            {
                // get your data
               _data = GetYourData();
            }
        }
        return _data;
    }
}
 Is there a problem with this?! Edit: Please note that I'm referring to a single server scenario here, for a server farm you need some distributed locking mechanism, but you don't expect every site you create to get millions of hits in a couple of weeks, do you? What if you need locking, should you create your site with that distributed locking, isn't that too much for an application which you have no idea whether it will ever need to be scaled or not? Besides computers have gotten really fast these days, one server can handle tons of traffic and this has been proven so many times, some examples are plentyoffish.com and this very site you're using right now, do some googling and I'm sure you'll come across so many others.
@CODE:private _locker =  new object();
private YourClass[] _data;
public YourClass[] Data
{
    get
    {
        if(_data == null)
        {

@CONTENT:I have a List with a custom ItemRenderer. The ItemRenderer contains a Checkbox and a Label. The component with the List has a 'select all' checkbox.

I want to display X number of posts and then the latest three comments for each of the posts. My replies has a foreign key "post_id" which matches the "id" of every post. I am trying to create a main page that has something along the lines of Post --Reply --Reply --Reply Post --Reply so on and so fourth. I can accomplish this by using a for loop in my template and discarding the unneeded replies but I hate grabbing data from a db I won't use. Any ideas?

@CONTENT:I'm using NAnt 0.85 to build a legacy project. The script itself uses the csc task (not the msbuild task) and works fine. The project is on its way to migrating over .NET 3.5. We already use VS2008, and C# 3.0, while still targeting .NET 2.0 framework runtime. Now the problem occurs when we want to upgrade our NAnt scripts, to compile C#3.0 code using csc task. I managed to compile C#3.0 code with NAnt, by modifying the nant.exe.config to add the net-3.5 framework section, but still, I can't figure a way to ensure that resulting assemblies will execute on .NET 2.0 runtime. More problematic : if I'm using LinqBridge to leverage Linq without System.Core and .NET 3.5 runtime, the csc task fails and gave me an error message indicating that all linq-related calls are ambiguous. In fact, NAnt csc task seems to automatically reference System.Core.dll, which causes a conflict with the only reference I effectively added to the <references> section, under the csc task: LinqBridge.dll. Do you now how to solve that?

@CONTENT:I am trying to find a way to decode the REG_BINARY value for "HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Ole\DefaultLaunchPermission" to see which users have permissions by default, and if possible, a method in which I can also append other users by their username. At work we make use of DCOM and for the most part we always give the same users permission but in some cases we are forced to accommodate our clients and add custom users/groups to suit their needs. Unfortunately the custom users we need to add are random usernames so I am unable to just add all the users and copy the value from the key like I have done with the default users we use 95% of the time. I am currently working on a command-line executable application where I have a command to set permissions for pre-defined users but I would also like to be able to add an option to append a custom user(s) to add to the default permission along with our predefined default users list. Currently, to set the default users list with my application I would just type: MyTool.exe Policies But I would like to be able to make it a bit more verbose, closer to how NET command is used for windows users, something like: MyTool.exe Policies /ADD:"MyCustomUsername" The problem is that the data stored in the REG_BINARY value doesn't seem to be easily decoded. I was able to decode the hex portion in python but I am left with some sort of binary data which I don't have a clue what to do with as I don't even know what kind of encoding was used in the first place to know what to use to decode it. :P I have done quite a bit of googling but I think my lack of understanding the terminology around this topic has probably caused me to overlook the answer without recognizing it for what it is. I guess my first real question would have to be what kind of encoding is used for the above key after it has been decoded from hex? Or better yet, is it even possible to obtain/modify the key's value programmatically so that I can obtain a list of the users that are currently set, and if necessary, append additional users/groups? I would prefer to keep this application written strictly in Python if possible (or WMI/WMIC), but if necessary I can attempt to implement other types of code into my python application if it means getting the job finally done! I guess it would also be useful to mention that this application is primarily used on Windows XP Professional and most Windows Server versions so I am not worried if any possible solution will not be compatible with earlier Windows OS version(s). Any assistance, code or just some simple help with getting familiar with this topic, would be GREATLY appreciated! Thanks in advance for any help you can provide!! :D

@TITLE:Generics: Accessing New Members, Not Hidden Members
@CONTENT:I have run into a problem with generics and new members. I wrote a generic class which operates on an object of type ObjectA. ObjectB derives from ObjectA and hides a few of ObjectA's members. When I supply the type of ObjectB as the type parameter to the generic class, I would expect that when I call any of the members hidden by ObjectB, I would be calling ObjectB's implementation. However, the CLR still calls the hidden members (ObjectA's implementation). This seems illogical because I explicitly provided the type of ObjectB to the generic class. Is this a problem with generics themselves, or am I doing something wrong? Edit: Unfortunately, I do not have access to ObjectA's source code and the member I want to override is not virtual. If I had access to ObjectA's source code, I would make the member virtual, but as I cannot do so, my only option for "overriding" the member is through the "new" keyword. class GenericClass<T> where T : ObjectA

@TITLE:SOAP Header with identity of final client
@CONTENT:The environment is in-house service based applications running in a Windows environment with WCF. There are several "middle-tier" ASP.NET Web Applications and Web Services that authenticate the final client using Windows authentication, and use ASP.NET Roles to set Thread.CurrentPrincipal to a suitable RolePrincipal. These applications each run under their own service account, which is a domain account, and are considered to be trusted subsystems. Some back-end WCF web services that may only be accessed by these trusted "middle-tier" applications. They use Windows Authentication to limit access to the service accounts used by these applications. We now have a requirement for the back-end services to audit the identity of the final client whose call to the middle-tier application resulted in the call to the back-end service. To avoid making any application changes, I was thinking of writing an endpoint behavior which inserts a SOAP Header with the final client's identity into the request sent to the back-end service. Note that the middle-tier applications are trusted, so no authentication of this SOAP Header would be required. It occurred to me that this requirement may not be unique, so before I invent my own SOAP Header for this purpose I thought I'd ask if there exist any standards in this area I could reuse?

file_put_contents($mystring, "");
$h = dir('.');
$h->read(); // "."
$h->read(); // ".."
$filename = $h->read();

print "string: $mystring and filename: $filename are ";

if ($mystring == $filename) print "equal\n";
else print "different\n";
 When run MacOSX: $ php test.php
string: abc???def? and filename: abc???def? are different
$ php test.php |cat -evt
string: abc???M-^Zdef?$ and filename: abco?M-^Au?M-^HU?M-^Adefa?M-^J are different$
 When run on Linux (or on a nfs-mounted ext3 filesystem on MacOSX): $ php test.php
string: abc???def? and filename: abc???def? are equal
$ php test.php |cat -evt
string: abcM-CM-3M-CM-<M-CM-^ZdefM-CM-% and filename: abcM-CM-3M-CM-<M-CM-^ZdefM-CM-% are equal$
 Is there a way to make this script return "equal" on both platforms?

@TITLE:How do I shows column headers of main report on each page when subreport renders on more than one pages
@CONTENT:I have few subreports in a sql main report(.rdl file) using VS/SSRS 2008. The subreports start approximately on the middle of the page in the main report detail section. I have one group in main report, shows header information and pass one parameter - ReportID to each subreport. I also have checked both: Row Headers V ：Repeat header rows on each page； and Column Headers V ：Repeat header columns on each page； on General tab of Tablix properties of the main report. If I have few detail lines in the subreport, so that all can be rendered on page one, everything is ok. If I have more detail lines in the subreport so that it's not possible to print all on one page, the subreport renders from the fist page and moves on to page two, three and so on. When I have more than one page of data in the subreport, it is also started on page one, and continues renders on second page and so on... However, it doesn't show the main report's column/row headers on subsequent pages of the subreports? I've noticed that when next item/ReportID starts in my main report group, it prints column header only on the first page but not any subsequent page and so on... I also tried to check only ONE, either Row Headers V ：Repeat header rows on each page； OR Column Headers V ：Repeat header columns on each page； on general tab of Tablix properties of the main report BUT didn・t work? Any ideas how to print header info on each page when subreport has more than one page data?

@CONTENT:I'm looping through each line of a series of CURL returned http headers, trying to detect when one ends and the next begins. I know that an http header terminates with an empty line, but what character is used to represent this line break in php? I've tried with \n but it doesn't seem to work. I certainly could be doing something wrong. What character is used to represent the line break used to terminate a header? Here's my existing code: $redirect = '';
$regs = '';
foreach ($curl_response as $line)

	if ($line != "\n")
	{	# line is not a linebreak, so we're still processing a header block

 Solved - Turns out that \r is what I should have been matching on. Very odd. Not sure if this changes per site, or if it's something set in curl. So far its \r on all sites I've tried. Edit 2: Doh. I think it's because in order to get the header into an array of lines, I exploded it on \n. So perhaps any \r\n are now just \r... $c = explode("\n",$content);

@CONTENT:We have several pages in our ASP.net Ajax application which auto refresh the UpdatePanels contents based on a timer event but the problem is that we have a requirement to timeout the web session and the auto refresh is preventing that. Is there a way to prevent the timer postback event from modifying the web session or any other alternate solution to allow the web session to timeout while auto refreshing the UpdatePanel contents? Here is an example to illustrate this problem. I set the session timeout to 3 minutes and have a timer in the UpdatePanel that ticks every minute and modifies the contents of the UpdatePanel based on the current state. After logging in, I navigate to this page and do nothing for 5 minutes and then try and click on another page and I am still logged in since the session didn't time out.

 And so on, like that. I left out the eventQuery, because that one works fine. The travel query and event query also have the same connection string. The program has the event query executes and then if one of the values, RdwyID returned fits within a certain range, travelQuery executes. I set RdwyID to 187 within the code to force it to pull and post the travel times, and when I try running it it crashes saying that there are no values. Here's the exact code I use. I do things in the exact same way with eventQuery where it works fine. I am making sure to open and close the connection properly. Time is properly declared as an array of objects.

When I pass a StudentID instance to SqlCommand.Parameters.AddWithValue (as the value) and execute the command, I receive the following error: No mapping exists from object type StudentID to a known managed provider native type.
 Specifying a type for the parameter like SqlDbType.NVarChar doesn't help. The only thing that works is to explicitly cast the StudentID value to a string, which defeats the purpose of having the implicit cast. I guess the framework does not consider available conversions. Is there anything I can do to the StudentID class to make the command handle it without requiring an explicit cast to a primitive type? This MSDN article talks about how primitive types are handled, but not user-defined types. The closest match would be object, which it says is passed as a Variant. The exact point of failure is in the System.Data.SqlClient.MetaType.GetMetaTypeFromValue method, with signature private static MetaType GetMetaTypeFromValue(Type dataType, object value, bool inferLen). Reflection reveals that it looks for primative types, and if the TypeCode is object, it looks for Sql* data types such as SqlBoolean, so it seems to be looking for very specific kinds of primitive or Sql* types.

@CONTENT:I know that in general I can expect .NET 2.0 or better installed on most client/customer machines since it's been included in Windows XP SP1 (SP2?) for some time and comes standard in Vista/2003/2008. But my question now is, can I expect .NET 3.0 to support WCF/WPF? We build component libraries so we can't make too many assumptions and requiring that the our development customers include the 3.0 installer is not ideal. So the question I guess is, in your experience what is the minimum version of .NET installed on most machines that have .NET installed? Is there a resource that tracks this sort of thing? To clarify: I do not have any control or influence over the final intstaller. I'm interested in what dependencies are already in place not what to do to bring the client machine up to spec.

@TITLE:Determine if device is connected/disconnected to RS232 port without opening the port
@CONTENT:I"m working on a C++ Win32 application for which I'm trying to essentially "auto detect" if a device has been plugged into one of the RS232 ports and then if it has been disconnected. The checking for a connected device is easy enough because my use case allows me to assume that this particular thread will be the first to try to initiate communication with the port. I'm able to scan the available ports every minute or so and once I've found a port with the device on it I flag that port has having a device, close the port, then set an event so that the process that actually will use the device knows it can now connect on that port. The disconnect detect is where I run into trouble. When I'm scanning for connected devices I can actually send data to the port to be sure that, if there is a device, it's the specific device I'm looking for. But once it's connected, that port will already be open by the other process and I can no longer open that port from the detect thread. So I am looking for a way to either open the port in a "listen mode" or something like that so I can just see if the device is still there. I briefly came across something about watching the DSR or DTR line or something...but couldn't find any more or how to actually do it. Any suggestions? Edit: Looks like I need to clarify a little more... For detecting the disconnect, I cannot send data to the RS232 port in any way. Also, I cannot assume that another application actually has the port open. The device may be physically connected, but without and open connection...but I still can't risk sending data to it. I was hoping there was a way to just check that there was still power on that port or something like that.

I am trying to create a C# application that will read this database using the System.Data.OleDB namespace.

So far I have not been successful in an approach that I have found. The following is a sample code snippet I am using to read the table and includes two options I used to read the CTRLNUMS field. Both options resulted in 238 characters being returned even though there is 750 characters stored in the field.

@LINK:/questions/753599/implementing-linq-to-sql-transactions-through-wcf
@TITLE:Implementing LINQ-to-SQL transactions through WCF
@CONTENT:I have a WCF service which is used to add tenders to the database, which is MS SQL Server 2005. WCF uses LINQ-to-SQL. Each tender can have a lot of documents and a lot of items. The customers can add one object per service call. That is, the do something like this: TendersServiceClient service = new TenderServiceClient();
service.BeginTransaction();

// Adding a new tender
service.AddTender(TenderDTO tenderInfo);

// Adding tender's documents
foreach (DocumentDTO documentInfo in documents)
   service.AddTenderDocument(tenderInfo.TenderID, documentInfo);

// Adding tender's items
foreach (ItemDTO itemInfo in items)
   service.AddTenderItem(tenderInfo.TenderID, itemInfo);

service.CommitTransaction();
 Notice the BeginTransaction() and CommitTransaction(). That is, all the above procedure must either succeed completely or be rolled back completely. For example, if one of the items couldn't be inserted, then the whole tender shouldn't exist... So the question is how do I implement this kind of transaction. The problem is that WCF is stateless, of course. So new DataContext is created for each service call. If I use a static DataContext instead, then I'll be able to use its built-in transactions capabilities, but then how can I handle other customers who can try to add another tender in the same time (they must be, of course, outside this transaction)? So please help me with some kind of design pattern to achieve this. I am free to change the code both of the service and of the client, so feel free with your suggestions =)
@CODE:TendersServiceClient service = new TenderServiceClient();
service.BeginTransaction();

// Adding a new tender
service.AddTender(TenderDTO tenderInfo);

// Adding tender's documents
foreach (DocumentDTO documentInfo in documents)
   service.AddTenderDocument(tenderInfo.TenderID, documentInfo);

// Adding tender's items
foreach (ItemDTO itemInfo in items)
   service.AddTenderItem(tenderInfo.TenderID, itemInfo);

service.CommitTransaction();

I also have access to the TR after which i need to insert. This is slightly different then what i have done before where i was replacing TBODY with another TBODY. The problem i am having is that appendChild requires a single element, but i have to insert a set. Edit: Here is the solution : function appendRows(node, html){ 
    var temp = document.createElement("div");
    var tbody = node.parentNode;
    var nextSib = node.nextSibling;

    temp.innerHTML = "<table><tbody>"+html;

@CONTENT:I am transferring a large static website of 500+ pages to a Joomla installation but what I am wanting to do, rather than code a 500+ line .htaccess file, is to use PHP's built in 301 header redirect to dynamically redirect requests that come in to the new URL. So for example, after I move the site, the following URL would 404 without a redirect- http://www.foo.com/old_page.html I would want it to redirect to http://www.foo.com/old-page.php
 So I would like to create a MySQL database of old URLs and their corresponding new URL and then, if the server is going to return a 404, for it first to check the DB for the existing old URL, and if matched, to issue a 301 redirect to the new URL. Right, am I making sense here? How would I do that? I can "talk" the logic but not really sure where to begin or how to accomplish it because, while I understand PHP, I don't really understand how this would work with Apache (or even if it would for example...)?

@CONTENT:Okay I have to write a program that accepts 2 or more arguments and searches the second and remaining arguments for a matching argument. for example the output would be: ./a 3 h 4 9 3  
3 found
 or ./a hsi and iash me 34 hsi  
hsi found
 So far I have this, and I'm pretty sure I've got a lot of junk in here that is useless in the situation. Any help provided would be greatly appreciated!: int linear_search (const char*A[], char*x, int v ){  
    int i;

    while ( i < v - 1){

        }

 Whenever I run the program through the compiler I get the warning: passing arg 1 of 'linear_search' from incompatible pointer type. warning: passing arg 2 of 'linear_search' makes pointer from integer without a cast. What does that mean?

@TITLE:301 redirect with PHP and MySQL on 404
@CONTENT:I am transferring a large static website of 500+ pages to a Joomla installation but what I am wanting to do, rather than code a 500+ line .htaccess file, is to use PHP's built in 301 header redirect to dynamically redirect requests that come in to the new URL. So for example, after I move the site, the following URL would 404 without a redirect- http://www.foo.com/old_page.html I would want it to redirect to http://www.foo.com/old-page.php
 So I would like to create a MySQL database of old URLs and their corresponding new URL and then, if the server is going to return a 404, for it first to check the DB for the existing old URL, and if matched, to issue a 301 redirect to the new URL. Right, am I making sense here? How would I do that? I can "talk" the logic but not really sure where to begin or how to accomplish it because, while I understand PHP, I don't really understand how this would work with Apache (or even if it would for example...)? And if you know of any scripts out there that are already doing this, all the better.

 I can get the Team1 column using max() from a sub select query, but I'm having a complete mental block on how to achieve Team2, Team3, etc. (Yes, I know that if there are more teams assigned to a user than I create columns the query will lose that information: that isn't a concern). Edit: To clarify, the number of columns in the query will be fixed (in the actual query, there will always be 7). If there are less teams than columns the additional columns should be Null (as in example). If there are more teams than columns, only the first 7 teams will be shown in this summary. Edit 2 - Possible solution which doesn't work...: I tried... SELECT UserTable.ID As UID, UserTable.Name, 
(SELECT TOP 1 TeamID FROM TeamTable WHERE UserTable.ID = TeamTable.UserID
ORDER BY TeamID) As Team1
FROM UserTable

@CONTENT:I work for a billing service that uses some complicated mainframe-based billing software for it's core services. We have all kinds of codes we set up that are used for tracking things: payment codes, provider codes, write-off codes, etc... Each type of code has a completely different set of data items that control what the code does and how it behaves. I am tasked with building a new system for tracking changes made to these codes. We want to know who requested what code, who/when it was reviewed, approved, and implemented, and what the exact setup looked like for that code. The current process only tracks two of the different types of code. This project will add immediate support for a third, with the goal of also making it easy to add additional code types into the same process at a later date. My design conundrum is that each code type has a different set of data that needs to be configured with it, of varying complexity. So I have a few choices available: I could give each code type it's own table(s) and build them independently. Considering we only have three codes I'm concerned about at the moment, this would be simplest. However, this concept has already failed or I wouldn't be building a new system in the first place. It's also weak in that the code involved in writing generic source code at the presentation level to display request data for any code type (even those not yet implemented) is not trivial. Build a db schema capable of storing the data points associated with each code type: not only values, but what type they are and how they should be displayed (dropdown list from an enum of some kind). I have a decent db schema for this started, but it just feels wrong: overly complicated to query and maintain, and it ultimately requires a custom query to view full data in nice tabular for for each code type anyway. Storing the data points for each code request as xml. This greatly simplifies the database design and will hopefully make it easier to build the interface: just set up a schema for each code type. Then have code that validates requests to their schema, transforms a schema into display widgets and maps an actual request item onto the display. What this item lacks is how to handle changes to the schema. My questions are: how would you do it? Am I missing any big design options? Any other pros/cons to those choices? My current inclination is to go with the xml option. Given the schema updates are expected but extremely infrequent (probably less than one per code type per 18 months), should I just build it to assume the schema never changes, but so that I can easily add support for a changing schema later? What would that look like in SQL Server 2000 (we're moving to SQL Server 2005, but that won't be ready until after this project is supposed to be completed)? [Update]: One reason I'm thinking xml is that some of the data will be complex: nested/conditional data, enumerated drop down lists, etc. But I really don't need to query any of it. So I was thinking it would be easier to define this data in xml schemas. However, le dorfier's point about introducing a whole new technology hit very close to home. We currently use very little xml anywhere. That's slowly changing, but at the moment this would look a little out of place. I'm also not entirely sure how to build an input form from a schema, and then merge a record that matches that schema into the form in an elegant way. It will be very common to only store a partially-completed record and so I don't want to build the form from the record itself. That's a topic for a different question, though. Based on all the comments so far Xml is still the leading candidate. Separate tables may be as good or better, but I have the feeling that my manager would see that as not different or generic enough compared to what we're currently doing.

@TITLE:Test Before Attempting Exclusive Lock
@CONTENT:I've written some code to upgrade a SQL Server database. Before I upgrade the database, I attain an exclusive lock via: ALTER DATABASE Test SET SINGLE_USER WITH NO_WAIT
 However, I'd like to test the database to see if the exclusive lock is possible before I run the above code. The test doesn't have to be 100% perfect, I'd just like to avoid the possibility of a timeout when attempting to gain an exclusive lock. To that end, I've written the code below: SELECT 
    *
FROM 
    sys.db_tran_locks 
WHERE 
    resource_database_id = DB_ID('Test') AND
    request_session_id <> @@SPID
 I'm assuming that if there's 1 or more row returned, then the database must be in use. Is this true? Or is it not that simple? UPDATE Taking @gbn's comments into account, I've decided to force rollback of existing connections using the following statement: ALTER DATABASE Test SET SINGLE_USER WITH ROLLBACK IMMEDIATE
 Before running this code, I'll give the user the an opportunity to opt out. However, I'd like the user to be able to see the list of active connections to the database - so they can make an informed decision. Which leads me onto this question.

@TITLE:Hibernate: How declare foreign key without having to code association methods in the domain object?
@CONTENT:I have two related tables, MANY and ONE. An integer ONE_ID column on the MANY table formalises a many-to-one relationship. I want to map to Many and One domain objects and to have Hibernate generate the DDL including a foreign key constraint on MANY.ONE_ID. But I want a simple property getter and setter pair ("int getOneId() / void setOneId(int)") on the Many domain object rather than the association methods that Hibernate would ordinarily expect me to provide ("One getOne() / void setOne(One)"). Is this possible? I'll try and explain why I want this: I actually have hundreds of such many to one associations for which I want the FK constraint but that I'll never need to navigate. The hibernate mapping file and the domain objects are to be created by code generation. All I need to do at runtime is to be able to read the FK property from the 'many' side object and to set it; I never need to actually navigate the many to one association. Because of the code generation issues it would greatly simplify things if I could have simple property based accessors for the FK field.

@CONTENT:Item is a simple model class. ItemComponent is a view for an Item which just draws simple rectangles in a given spot. A bunch of ItemComponent instances are put into a parent component that is added to the JFrame of the application (just a simple shell right now). The view has two different display styles. I want to adjust some properties of the model, and possibly change the state (which controls the style), and then call update() to repaint. The problem is, as far as I can tell... paint() is only EVER called once. repaint() seems to have no effect. What's wrong? I'm not a Swing programmer and cobbled this together from examples, so I expect it may be something trivial here I don't understand. public class ItemComponent extends JComponent implements ItemView {

    private static final Color COLOR_FILL_NORMAL = new Color(0x008080ff);

    public ItemComponent(Item item) {
        this.item = item;
        this.rect = new RoundRectangle2D.Double(0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5);
        item.setView(this);
    }

    public void setState(State state) {
        this.state = state;
    }

    public void update() {
        System.out.println("ItemComponent.update");
        setLocation(item.getLeft(), 1);
        setSize(item.getWidth(), getParent().getHeight()-1);
        rect.setRoundRect(0, 0, getWidth()-1, getHeight()-1, 5, 5);

        repaint();
        //paintImmediately(getBounds());
    }

        if (state == State.NORMAL) {
            System.out.println("draw normal");
            g2.setPaint(COLOR_FILL_NORMAL); // light blue
            g2.fill(rect);

            g2.setPaint(COLOR_OUTLINE);

            g2.draw(rect);
        }
    }
}
 Hint: I traced into repaint() and found a point where isDisplayable() was being checked, and it's returning false. It makes sure that getPeer() != null. So my component has no peer? What's up with that? It's been added to a container which itself is added to the rest of the app. And it gets painted once, so I know it's visible.

 A disadvantage is that the combinations expand with n numbers. For three numbers, the number of combinations is 3! (=6) that is g/1.*2.*3\|2.*1.*3\|3.*1.*2\|1.*3.*2\|2.*3.*1\|3.*2.*1/

@TITLE:How to determine if a file will be logically moved or physically moved
@CONTENT:The facts: When a file is moved, there's two possibilities: The source and destination file are on the same partition and only the file system index is updated The source and destination are on two different file system and the file need to be moved byte per byte. (aka copy on move) The question: How can I determine if a file will be either logically or physically moved ? I'm transferring large files (700+ megs) and would adopt a different behaviors for each situation. Edit: I've already coded a moving file dialog with a worker thread that perform the blocking io call to copy the file a meg at a time. It provide information to the user like rough estimate of the remaining time and transfer rate. The problem is: how do I know if the file can be moved logically before trying to move it physically ?

@TITLE:ASP.NET MVC AJAX change UpdateTargetId if ModelState is invalid
@CONTENT:I use a view with two partial views inside. <div id="matches">
    <% foreach (var item in Model)
       { %>
    <% Html.RenderPartial("RenderMatchesListRowUserControl", item); %>
    <% } %>
</div>
<div id="addMatchFormBox">    
    <% Html.RenderPartial("AddNewMatchUserControl");%>
</div>
 The first partial view "RenderMatchesListRowUserControl" renders a simple div element (for a list of matches), the second one "AddNewMatchUserControl" renders a form to create a new match beneath the list: Source of AddNewMatchUserControl: <%= Html.ValidationSummary("Create was unsuccessful. Please correct the errors and try again.") %>

<% using (Ajax.BeginForm("Create", new AjaxOptions
   {
       UpdateTargetId = "matches",
       InsertionMode = InsertionMode.InsertAfter,
       OnSuccess = "flashit",
       OnFailure = "renderForm"
   }))
   {%>
<fieldset>
    <legend>New Match</legend>
    <p>
        <label for="DurationBetweenMovesInDays">
            Dauer (in Tagen) zwischen den Z&uuml;gen:</label>
        <%= Html.TextBox("DurationBetweenMovesInDays")%>
        <%= Html.ValidationMessage("DurationBetweenMovesInDays", "*")%>
    </p>
    <p>
        <input type="submit" value="Create" />
    </p>
</fieldset>
<% } %>
 Depending on the ModelState, the controller returns the partial view for the new match entry or the partial view for the form, to display the model errors. if (Request.IsAjaxRequest()) {
            return ModelState.IsValid ?    PartialView("RenderMatchesListRowUserControl", match) : PartialView("AddNewMatchUserControl");
        }
 It works fine, till the ModelState become invalid. In this case the form will be rendered at the end of the matches list because of the updatetargetid refers to the div element which contains the matches list. To avoid this, the updatetargetid must be changed to refer the div element containing the form. But i have no idea how to do this.
@CODE:<div id="matches">
    <% foreach (var item in Model)

@TITLE:How can I have DBIC persistent database connection in mod_perl?
@CONTENT:I am using mod_perl for my web application. Currently, I plan to use a mysql database across the network. In every CGI request to display_customer_transaction.cgi, my script will Open up database connection across network Perform query on the database using SQL statement Analysis the data retrieved from database Print out the data in HTML format Close the database connection After some profiling, I realize step (1) is the bottleneck. Hence, I wish to avoid opening and closing a database connection for every CGI request. My wish is, if my first CGI request opens up a database connection, my second incoming CGI request (from different client) may reuse the first database connection. I tried to Google for "DBIX Persistent Database Connection" but hardly find relevant result. (Edit: that's because it's called DIBC, or DBIx::Class, not DBIX.) I further find for relevant information, using Apache::DBI (However, my intention is on DBIX, not Apache::DBI). There are some information which confused me: The Apache::DBI module still has a limitation: it keeps database connections persistent on a per process basis. All the while, my concept on how Apache serving CGI request is that Apache will always spawn a new process to serve an incoming new CGI request. Whenever the Perl interpreter finish executed Perl script, the process will dead. So, if Apache::DBI module only able to keeps database connections persistent on a per process basis, how can my second CGI request re-use back the connection opened by the first CGI request? But come back to my original question. How can I have DBIX persistent database connection in mod_perl?

@LINK:/questions/732522/comparing-elements-in-a-generic-list
@TITLE:Comparing elements in a generic list
@CONTENT:I wrote a linked list implementation for my java class earlier this year. This is a generic class called LList. We now have to write out the merge sort algorithm for a lab. Instead of creating a new List implementation that takes Ints, I decided to just reuse the generic list I had created before. The problem is how do I compare two generic objects? java wont let me do something like if(first.headNode.data > second.headNode.data)
 So, my question is, is their a way to implement some sort of comparison function that will work on any type of data? I tried the following:         String one, two;
        one = first.headNode.data.toString();
        two = second.headNode.data.toString();
        if(first.headNode.data.compareTo(second.headNode.data) < 0) {
            result.add(first.headNode.data);
            // remove head node. remove() takes care of list size.
            first.remove(1);
        } else {
            // If compareTo returns 0 or higher, second.headNode is lower or
            // equal to first.headNode. So it's safe to update the result
            // list
            result.add(second.headNode.data);
            second.remove(1);
        }
 Which wont even work properly. I tested with the numbers 6 and 12, the above adds 12 to the result list. Relevant stuff:  private LList<T> mergeSort(LList<T> list) {
    LList<T> first = new LList();
    LList<T> second = new LList();
    if (list.length() == 1) {
        return list;
    }

    int middle = list.length() / 2;
    second.headNode = list.getNodeAt(middle + 1);
    second.length = list.length() - (middle);
    // Set first half to full list, then remove the "second" half.
    first.headNode = list.headNode;
    first.length = middle;
    first.getNodeAt(middle).next = null;

    // Get the splitted halves.
    first = mergeSort(first);
    second = mergeSort(second);
    return merge(first, second);
}

private LList<T> merge(LList<T> first, LList<T> second) {
    LList<T> result = new LList();

    while((first.length > 0) && (second.length > 0)) {
        // Ok, lets force toString to compare stuff since generics are a pain.
        String one, two;
        one = first.headNode.data.toString();
        two = second.headNode.data.toString();
        if(one.compareTo(two)) < 0) {
            result.add(first.headNode.data);
            // remove head node. remove() takes care of list size.
            first.remove(1);
        } else {
            // If compareTo returns 0 or higher, second.headNode is lower or

 The Text component doesnt suffer from this, but I cannot attach a stylesheet to a text component. Hoping someone can help. Or is there some other component I can use where I can add a stylesheet to stylise anchor tags. I found this overridable in the TextArea.as source and if I override it and remove the "2 x" multiplier it almost works but unfortunately it means that the content doesnt get bigger when it needs to and vertically scrolls instead, so its almost there: override protected function measure():void
{
    super.measure();

    measuredMinWidth = DEFAULT_MEASURED_MIN_WIDTH;
    measuredWidth = DEFAULT_MEASURED_WIDTH;
    // TextArea is minimum of two lines of text
    measuredMinHeight = measuredHeight = 2 * DEFAULT_MEASURED_MIN_HEIGHT;
}

Each page in a "document" has text such as "Page 3 of 26". I want to be able to automatically identify the first and last page of each "document" within a PDF (Note: this is not the same as the first and last page of a PDF as each PDF may contain several "documents") and extract these into a new PDF for later printing and archival.

@TITLE:Way of jumping to a page in a local pdf?
@CONTENT:My question is similar to "How can I programmaticly open a pdf at a certain point?", but the PDF is local, not on a web server. I need a way to jump to a given page in a PDF that is on the users computer, that works across versions of Acrobat (or using an alternative PDF viewer like Foxit Reader). The PDF is going to be called from a Java app (it is only used on Windows, so cross-platform isn't a must), and right now it works with: int pageNum = 24;

String cmdString = "\"" + acrordPath + \" /A \"page=" + pageNum + 
    "=OpenActions\" \"" + manualPath + \"";
Process p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(cmdString);
 Obviously this will only work if the end user is using Acrobat 8 for 32bit, and installed it in the default location. I next tried using: rundll32 url.dll,FileProtocolHandler file:///C:/Program%20Files/Foo/Bar/Docs/RefMan.pdf#page=24
 thinking that this would open the users browser and jump to that page, but it simply opened Acrobat on page 1. So I'm stumpped, and asking for help.

@LINK:/questions/727449/synchronizing-jena-ontmodels-with-bnodes
@TITLE:Synchronizing Jena OntModels with bnodes
@CONTENT:This question relates to rcreswick's question on Serializing Jena OntModel Changes. I have Jena models on two (or more) machines that need to remain synchronized over sockets. The main issue that I need to address is that the models may contain anonymous nodes (bnodes), which can originate in any of the models. Question: Am I on the right track here, or is there a better, more robust approach that I'm failing to consider? I can think of 3 approaches to this problem: Serialize the complete model: This is prohibitively expensive for synchronizing small updates. Also, since changes can occur on either machine, I can't just replace machine B's model with the serialized model from machine A. I need to merge them. Serialize a partial model: Use a dedicated model for serialization that only contains the changes that need to be sent over the socket. This approach requires special vocabulary to represent statements that were removed from the model. Presumably, when I serialize the model from machine A to machine B, anonymous node IDs will be unique to machine A but may overlap with IDs for anonymous nodes created on machine B. Therefore, I'll have to rename anonymous nodes and keep a mapping from machine A's anon ids to machine B's ids in order to handle future changes correctly. Serialize individual statements: This approach requires no special vocabulary, but may not be as robust. Are there issues other than anonymous nodes that I just haven't encountered yet? Generate globally unique bnode ids (NEW): We can generate globally unique IDs for anonymous nodes by prefixing the ID with a unique machine ID. Unfortunately, I haven't figured out how to tell Jena to use my ID generator instead of its own. This would allow us to serialize individual statements without remapping bnode IDs. Here's an example to ground this discussion a bit more. Suppose I have a list on machine A represented as: 
    _:a rdf:first myns:tom
    _:a rdf:rest rdf:nil
 I serialize this model from machine A to machine B. Now, because machine B may already have an (unrelated) anonymous node with id 'a', I remap id 'a' to a new id 'b': 
    _:b rdf:first myns:tom
    _:b rdf:rest rdf:nil
 Now the list changes on machine A: 
    _:a rdf:first myns:tom
    _:a rdf:rest _:b
    _:b rdf:first myns:dick
    _:b rdf:rest rdf:nil
 Since machine B has never encountered machine A's id 'b' before, it adds a new mapping from machine A's id 'b' to a new id 'c': 
    _:b rdf:first myns:tom
    _:b rdf:rest _:c
    _:c rdf:first myns:dick
    _:c rdf:rest rdf:nil
 The problem is further complicated with more than two machines. If there is a third machine C, for example, it may have it's own anonymous node 'a' that is different from machine A's anonymous node 'a'. Thus, machine B really does need to keep a map from each of the other machines' anonymous node IDs to its local IDs, not just from remote IDs in general to local IDs. When processing incoming changes, it must take into account where the changes came from to map the IDs correctly.
@CODE:_:a rdf:first myns:tom
    _:a rdf:rest rdf:nil _:b rdf:first myns:tom
    _:b rdf:rest rdf:nil _:a rdf:first myns:tom
    _:a rdf:rest _:b
    _:b rdf:first myns:dick
    _:b rdf:rest rdf:nil _:b rdf:first myns:tom
    _:b rdf:rest _:c
    _:c rdf:first myns:dick

@CONTENT:I've set up an XML file with names of objects that will be contained in a fla/swf library. I wish to position the objects on the stage using an XML file that can be quickly modified without having to recompile the fla/swf file. Of course, positioning can only be accomplished when the objects are instantiaed and added to the stage. The problem is passing the parsed XML file name/class paring data into the var creation programatically. The XML file contains the object names and class: example follows: <objects>
   <object name="myBall" class="Ball"/>
</objects>
 The XML file parses correctly and I've set up a ...for...each loop to assign the name/class to each object. The problem is with the proper syntax to input the name/class paring, something similar to the following: var object.@name:object.@class = new object.@class();
 Am I off my rocker with this or just temporarily ignorant???**

@TITLE:How do I cleanup an opened Process in Java?
@CONTENT:I'm starting a Process from a Java program. I hold onto it and at later points in the program I may send it some signals (not as in UNIX signals -- a different mechanism) to tell it to clean itself up and shut down, which is the proper way of terminating this process. I may later restart and hold onto the process and stop it again an arbitrary number of times. I'd like my program, when it exists, to signal the Process to terminate and make sure it exists. Otherwise, since Java starts the process up asynchronously, it persists and continues to run after my program terminates. I thought I would do this in the destructor for the object that contains the Process variable, but it seems that Java does not have a destructor. It has a finalize() method for freeing memory allocated through JNI, but this is not such a case, and apparently you can't guarantee that finalize() will be called: it is only called when the object is garbage collected, and the program might run through to termination without ever calling garbage collection, in which case everything is freed at once and no garbage collection and no finalize() occurs. What's the best way to make sure that when my program exits this cleanup code gets called first? I see that Java 1.6 has introduced a Runtime.addShutdownHook() method, but I am currently stuck on Java 1.5.

@TITLE:How to detect 'strict aliasing' at compile time?
@CONTENT:'Strict aliasing' optimization needs special care from the source code, s.a. using a union instead of pointer casts. Is there a way to detect using preprocessor directives (#if/else) whether the compiler is trying to do such optimizations? I would like to maintain the old and non-strict-aliasing-prepared code path for processors and compilers that don't care. It seems faster. Edit: GCC predefined macros does not seem to have anything about aliasing. In other words, I'm most interested on gcc 4.x, but also in a general solution (which does not seem to exist).

@TITLE:How to manage styles for child components?
@CONTENT:How does one define a default style for a custom Flex component? was a good start, but I want to create custom styles for my custom component which contains other components. The custom component is a Canvas. It contains other Canvases, Buttons, Lists, etc. I do not want to have the child components use the same values as the parent component, and I want to have some style values "jump" the parent component and only affect a specific child (not all of them). I would like to have a single CSS definition with values for the parent and each of the subcomponents rather than a separate style for each. Can I have style values in the CSS files that are not actually standard CSS (e.g. buttonCornerRadius, mainPaneBackgroundColor, actionBitmap) ? Where should I propagate the styles to the child components? this.updateDisplayList() ? How would I know if the values changed via setStyle or loading a new CSS file (as StyleManager does not have events) ? Thanks

@LINK:/questions/723293/inserting-object-with-manytomany-in-django
@TITLE:Inserting object with ManyToMany in Django
@CONTENT:I have a blog-like application with stories and categories: class Category(models.Model):
    ...
class Story(models.Model):
    categories = models.ManyToManyField(Category)
    ...
 Now I know that when you save a new instance of a model with a many-to-many field, problems come up because the object is not yet in the database. This problem usually manifests itself on form submission, which can be neatly worked around with story_form.save(commit=False). What about a situation where there are no forms to speak of? In my case, I want to build an API to accept remote submissions. Since I like JSON, and a whole lot of other messaging in our company is in JSON (including outgoing messages from this server), I'd like to be able to receive the following: { "operation": "INSERT",
  "values": [
            { "datatype": "story",
              "categories": [4,6,8],
              "id":50,
              ...
            }
            ]
}
 and implement a factory that converts the values to instances. But I'd like the factory to be as agnostic as possible to the type of operation. So: { "operation": "UPDATE",
  "values": [
            { "datatype": "story",
              "categories": [4,6,8],
              "id":50,
              ...
            }
            ]
}
 should also be converted in the same way, except that INSERT ignores id and UPDATE gets the already existing instance and overrides it. (The remote submitter listens to a feed that gives it, among other things, the category objects to cache, so it can, and must, refer to them by id, but it doesn't have any direct communication with the database.) My real question is: what's the most easiest consistent to inflate an instance of a Django model object that has a ManyToManyManager involved. As far as I can fathom, any insert of an object with a many-to-many field will require two database hits, just because it is necessary to obtain a new id first. But my current awkward solution is to save the object right away and mark it hidden, so that functions down the line can play with it and save it as something a little more meaningful. It seems like one step up would be overriding save so that objects without ids save once, copy some proxy field to categories, then save again. Best of all would be some robust manager object that saves me the trouble. What do you recommend?
@CODE:class Category(models.Model):
    ...
class Story(models.Model):
    categories = models.ManyToManyField(Category)
    ... story_form.save(commit=False) { "operation": "INSERT",
  "values": [
            { "datatype": "story",
              "categories": [4,6,8],
              "id":50,
              ...
            }
            ]
} { "operation": "UPDATE",
  "values": [
            { "datatype": "story",
              "categories": [4,6,8],
              "id":50,
              ...
            }
            ]
} save categories

@TITLE:Excel VBA macro to track changes in separate sheet
@CONTENT:I am trying to write a VBA macro to track changes to a workbook in a separate sheet. If you do this manually, the sequence of commands is Tools > Track Changes > Highlight Changes, taking the option Separate Worksheet. You have to do two iterations of the command, one to activate tracking inline, a second to move the tracking to a separate sheet. Using the macro recorder, I got to this piece of code: With ActiveWorkbook
    .Save
    .KeepChangeHistory = True
    .HighlightChangesOptions When:=xlAllChanges
    .ListChangesOnNewSheet = True
    .HighlightChangesOnScreen = False
    .Worksheets("History").Select
End With
 When I run this, I get the error HighlightChangesOptions method fails. Any suggestions?
@CODE:With ActiveWorkbook
    .Save
    .KeepChangeHistory = True
    .HighlightChangesOptions When:=xlAllChanges
    .ListChangesOnNewSheet = True
    .HighlightChangesOnScreen = False
    .Worksheets("History").Select

@LINK:/questions/720750/pinning-a-delegate-within-a-struct-before-passing-to-unmanaged-code
@TITLE:Pinning a delegate within a struct before passing to unmanaged code
@CONTENT:I'm trying to use an unmanaged C dll for loading image data into a C# application. The library has a fairly simple interface where you pass in a struct that contains three callbacks, one to receive the size of the image, one that receives each row of the pixels and finally one called when the load is completed. Like this (C# managed definition): [System.Runtime.InteropServices.StructLayoutAttribute(System.Runtime.InteropServices.LayoutKind.Sequential)]
public struct st_ImageProtocol
{
   public st_ImageProtocol_done Done;    
   public st_ImageProtocol_setSize SetSize;    
   public st_ImageProtocol_sendLine SendLine;
}
 The types starting st_ImageProtocol are delgates: public delegate int st_ImageProtocol_sendLine(System.IntPtr localData, int rowNumber, System.IntPtr pixelData);
 With the test file that I'm using the SetSize should get called once, then the SendLine will get called 200 times (once for each row of pixels in the image), finally the Done callback gets triggered. What actually happens is that the SendLine is called 19 times and then a AccessViolationException is thrown claiming that the library tried to access protected memory. I have access to the code of the C library (though I can't change the functionality) and during the loop where it calls the SendLine method it does not allocate or free any new memory, so my assumption is that the delegate itself is the issue and I need to pin it before I pass it in (I have no code inside the delegate itself currently, besides a counter to see how often it gets called, so I doubt I'm breaking anything on the managed side). The problem is that I don't know how to do this; the method I've been using to declare the structs in unmanaged space doesn't work with delegates (Marshal.AllocHGlobal()) and I can't find any other suitable method. The delegates themselves are static fields in the Program class so they shouldn't be being garbage collected, but I guess the runtime could be moving them. This blog entry by Chris Brumme says that delegates don't need to be pinned before being passed into unmanaged code: Clearly the unmanaged function pointer must refer to a fixed address. It would be a disaster if the GC were relocating that! This leads many applications to create a pinning handle for the delegate. This is completely unnecessary. The unmanaged function pointer actually refers to a native code stub that we dynamically generate to perform the transition & marshaling. This stub exists in fixed memory outside of the GC heap. But I don't know if this holds true when the delegate is part of a struct. It does imply that it is possible to manually pin them though, and I'm interested in how to do this or any better suggestions as to why a loop would run 19 times then suddenly fail. Thanks. Edited to answer Johan's questions... The code that allocates the struct is as follows: _sendLineFunc = new st_ImageProtocol_sendLine(protocolSendLineStub);

_imageProtocol = new st_ImageProtocol()
                     {
                          //Set some other properties...
                          SendLine = _sendLineFunc
                     };

int protocolSize = Marshal.SizeOf(_imageProtocol);
_imageProtocolPtr = Marshal.AllocHGlobal(protocolSize);
Marshal.StructureToPtr(_imageProtocol, _imageProtocolPtr, true);
 Where the _sendLineFunc and the _imageProtocol variables are both static fields of the Program class. If I understand the internals of this correctly, that means that I'm passing an unmanaged pointer to a copy of the _imageProtocol variable into the C library, but that copy contains a reference to the static _sendLineFunc. This should mean that the copy isn't touched by the GC - since it is unmanaged - and the delegate won't be collected since it is still in scope (static). The struct actually gets passed to the library as a return value from another callback, but as a pointer: private static IntPtr beginCallback(IntPtr localData, en_ImageType imageType)
{
    return _imageProtocolPtr;
}
 Basically there is another struct type that holds the image filename and the function pointer to this callback, the library figures out what type of image is stored in the file and uses this callback to request the correct protocol struct for the given type. My filename struct is declared and managed in the same way as the protocol one above, so probably contains the same mistakes, but since this delegate is only called once and called quickly I haven't had any problems with it yet. Edited to update Thanks to everybody for their responses, but after spending another couple of days on the problem and making no progress I decided to shelve it. In case anyone is interested I was attempting write a tool for users of the Lightwave 3D rendering application and a nice feature would have been the ability to view all the different image formats that Lightwave supports (some of which are fairly exotic). I thought that the best way to do this would be to write a C# wrapper for the plugin architecture that Lightwave uses for image manipulation so I could use their code to actually load the files. Unfortunately after trying a number of the plugins against my solution I had a variety of errors that I couldn't understand or fix and my guess is that Lightwave doesn't call the methods on the plugins in a standard way, probably to improve the security of running external code (wild stab in the dark, I admit). For the time being I'm going to drop the image feature and if I do decide to reinstate it I'll approach it in a different way. Thanks again, I learnt a lot through this process even though I didn't get the result I wanted.

{
   public st_ImageProtocol_done Done;

@TITLE:checksum/hash function with reversible property
@CONTENT:I am looking for a specific hashcode that has the following properties. I dont know of any such hashcodes and I dont know if it is possible to do such a thing. Just wanted to put it out there and see what people say. I have two databases (loosely used term - dont think of SQL or anything of that sort), one master and one backup. There is a need to keep the two databases in sync and to detect when the databases are not in sync. Instead of verifying every data in there, it would be preferable to keep some hashcode that can be verified. But the two databases dont necessarily share every modifications. Since changes from master to backup are batched, it is possible that certain modifications from the master to backup are collapsed. ie: lets say current state of database has elements A->X, B->Y and C->Z. Now B gets modified such that B->Y1 and then later B->Y2. The only change that will get sent from master to backup is B->Y2. The intermediate B->Y1 is skipped. Now instead of looping over every element in each database to verify that they match, we would prefer to keep a running hash code of the elements in both the locations and then just compare that. The hashcode would have to compute something like: assuming previous hashcode of hm0: hashcode hm1 = f(hm0, A->X, B->Y, C->Z) When B changes now: hashcode hm2 = f(hm1, B->Y1) and then hashcode hm3 = f(hm2, B->Y2) So master will have hashcode of h3. Now backup will not receive the modification B->Y2, so if it computes a running hash code, it will be like this: hashcode hb1 = f(hb0, A->X, B->Y, C->Z) hashcode hb2 = f(hb1, B->Y2) Now we want hb2 and hm3 to match, as the current state of the databases are the same. But most (if not all) hashcodes dont work this way. So what we would want then is that we would want to "remove" the contribution of B->Y from the hash first and then 'add' the contribution of B->Y1 and then remove contribution of B->Y1 and add the contribution of B->Y2 into the hash code. So we want something like this: Two functions, f, g: f modifies existing hashcode by adding contribution of a new element, while g modifies existing hashcode by removing contribution of an element. On master: hm1 = f(hm0, A->X, B->Y, C->Z) when B gets modified to B->Y1: hm2 = g(hm1, B->Y) hm3 = f(hm2, B->Y1) when B get modified to B->Y2: hm4 = g(hm3, B->Y1) hm5 = f(hm4, B->Y2) hm5 is the new hashcode for the current state of the database (A->X, B->Y2, C->Z) On backup: hb1 = f(hb0, A->X, B->Y, C->Z) when B gets modified to B->Y2: hb2 = g(hb1, B->Y) hb3 = f(hb2, B->Y2) Now hm5 and hb3 should match, as the current state of both databases is the same. So: are there such algorithms f and g? I hope I made the question clear.... Thanks.

@TITLE:Conversion from 'xxxx' to 'yyyy', possible loss of data, suppression?
@CONTENT:Sometimes I've got warnings with conversion from a longer type to a smaller type e.g.: void f( unsigned short i ) // f - accept any numeric type
                           // smaller than std::vector<>::size_type
{}

std::vector < some_type > v;
..
f ( v.size() );
 Usually I was using one of next solutions: assert( v.size() <= std::numeric_limits< unsigned short >::max() );
f( static_cast< unsigned short >( v.size() ) );
 or f( boost::numeric_cast<  unsigned short >( v.size() ) );
 But on my present work boost not used and from last month asserts are disallowed. What other safe ways you know for suppress this warning? Any pitfalls in discribed ways? PS: It is not always possible to change the signature of f, also sometimes really should accept small numeric type. EDITED: I want to make conversion as safe as possible.
@CODE:void f( unsigned short i ) // f - accept any numeric type
                           // smaller than std::vector<>::size_type

..
f ( v.size() ); assert( v.size() <= std::numeric_limits< unsigned short >::max() );

@TITLE:A question about cache of filesystem
@CONTENT:When I read a large file in the file system, can the cache improve the speed of the operation? I think there are two different answers: 1.Yes. Because cache can prefetch thus the performance gets improved. 2.No. Because the speed to read from cache is more faster than the speed to read from disk, at the end we can find that the cache doesn't help,so the reading speed is also the speed to read from disk. Which one is correct? How can I testify the answer? [edit] And another questions is : What I am not sure is that, when you turn on the cache the bandwidth is used to 1.prefetch 2.prefetch and read which one is correct? While if you turn off the cache ,the bandwith of disk is just used to read. If I turn off the cache and randomly access the disk, is the time needed comparable with the time when read sequentially with the cache turned on?

@CONTENT:When I use innerHTML from javascript, the browser (Safari and Firefox at least) seem to replace certain characters and numeric entities with their named entities. The character \xa0 (non breaking space) gets replaced by &nbsp;, &#60; (lesser than) gets replaced by &lt;. But for example the umlaut ? is not replaced with &uuml;. I have not found any documentation for this behaviour. A simple demo: <h2 id="withoutnbsp">This does not use en?be?es?pe (uses the \xa0 character)</h2>
<script>alert(document.getElementById("withoutnbsp").innerHTML);</script>
 A more elaborate demonstration can be found here: http://gist.github.com/89434 You can use the "raw" link on the gist page, to view it in your browser. I need to know exactly which characters innerHTML replaces. Any help is appreciated. Thanks.

@TITLE:WPF Handle links inside FlowDocument
@CONTENT:I'm building simple dictionary application using WPF. I'm using MVVM pattern, databinding and FlowDocument to display words to user. UI consists of 2 controls: ListBox and FlowDocumentScrollViewer. Dictionary data comes from XML file, format of this string may look like this <b>Word</b> - Some description. Another <i>description</i>. Reference <ref id="123">related word</ref>
 The order of HTML and reference elements is not defined. I parse HTML string, make it into XAML, then from XAML I create FlowDocument object and bind it to Document property of FlowDocumentScrollViewer control. The problem arises when I need to link ref. elements. (my requirement is when user clicks on reference link, referenced word is selected in ListBox control and shown in FlowDocumentScrollViewer) My question is there a way to dynamically create "hyperlink"-style controls (with event or commands attached) that would take user to referenced word in dictionary. Is it possible to solve this problem at all?

What are your recommendations? Similar questions have been asked before, like this 6 months ago...: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13589/asp-net-ajax-drag-drop where MooTools is recommended, but 6 months is a long time in the ASP.NET/Ajax world, so maybe a better and even simpler option exists now?

@LINK:/questions/709694/replace-with-html-ascii-codes
@TITLE:Replace with HTML ascii codes
@CONTENT:I ran into a problem. Wrote the following code snippet: teksti = teksti.Trim()
teksti = Replace(teksti, "<", "& lt;")
teksti = Replace(teksti, ">", "& gt;")
teksti = Replace(teksti, """", "& quot;")
teksti = Replace(teksti, "'", "& #8217;")
teksti = Replace(teksti, "%", "& #37;")
teksti = Replace(teksti, "&", "& amp;")
teksti = Replace(teksti, "#", "& #35;")
teksti = Replace(teksti, "@", "& #64;")
 After writing this I realized it becomes its own problem. The function is supposed to make information safe for HTML and SQL injection (there are other methods too, parameterized queries, etc but that's beside the point). However what happens, is that it first replaces &lt; with & lt; and then proceeds to replace the newly written string again as every replace string has &, # and ; signs in it. Any hints? I thought about using a regex for this, but I couldn't find any decent Visual Basic examples that were simple enough. Edit: Thanks for the tips. I was sure there would be a "smart" easy way to do this, but I guess there are no common methods available after all. The re-arranging the problem cases first is the obvious solution here, thanks for that. I guess the work day was too long for me to notice. :D As for parametirized queries, checking back I see my English doesn't come out as intended. I meant to say that I'm already using them, that this problem here is specific to prevent all manner of html-injection and possible sql-injection using the same strings elsewhere later. Thanks again for the help.

But after configuring my app i just could visit my web site only once, other attempts gives "The server is taking too long to respond.". But from other IP i can access, but only once, it seems all ip addresses being blocked after first visit(even ftp and other services go down, no access at all from the IP), can anyone help to explore this problem ? i don't think that it's my app problem, the app works fine on my local PC. By far The only one is there might be a infinity loop in my code becouse i had this issues on my local pc, but i fixed it, should work fine everywhere. Can infinity loop make blocking all services bind(if this is the way) to particular IP ? but im not sure about this. Never thought this way.

@CONTENT:My department is currently converting all of our projects from 2.0 to 3.5, and we are experiencing an odd side effect. It seems that most, if not all, control events aren't firing after we convert the projects to the 3.5 framework. At least not initially. Case in point, I was looking at one of our internal interfaces that had been converted, and none of the button click events of drop-down selected index changed events were firing. I moved on to something else unrelated then went back to the page approximately 2 hours later, and then the events were firing. I've loaded the .aspx page in Design mode and ensured that the events were tied properly to the code-behind methods, and some projects still don't respond to events. Has anyone experienced this? I've done some searching on the web and have not been able to find any relevant answers. Any information would be greatly appreciated! James

@TITLE:ASP.NET Best way to retain label.text value between postback with PageMethods
@CONTENT:ASP.NET 2.0, PageMethods. Good day, I'm using ASP.NET AJAX PageMethods to dynamically change the text of a Label when a dropdownlist is changed on my page. I know that the text of Labels are not retained between postbacks when they are changed on client-side, which is my case. I've heard that a solution is to keep the label content in a hidden field, then to set Label text from that field in Page_Load. However, this solution does not seem really clean to me. Are there any other alternatives or best practices? Thank you! Just to clarify, I have a dropdownlist with people names. When the dropdownlist get changed, I want, in a label, to put the telephone of that person. However, I thought that doing a full postback was not really the best alternative, so I decided to get the telephone with a PageMethod, passing the Id of the item selected in the dropdownlist to retrieve the telephone, and the put it in the label. However, since other controls cause a full postback, I lose the telephone on every postback. I know that putting it in a hidden field, then setting it back to the label in Page_Load when there is a full postback would work, but I was wordering if there was another solution. Since WebMethods are marked as static, I cannot write Label.text = person.Telephone; in them.

@TITLE:C#: Blowfish Encipher a single dword
@CONTENT:I'm translating a C++ TCP Client into C#.The client is used to encode 4 bytes of an array using blowfish. C++ Blowfish C# Blowfish(C# NET) C++     BYTE response[6] =

 To make it clear,the loop is executed only one time due to the short length of the bytes passed(4). Only one call is executed from this huge code(only once),the call is: Blowfish_encipher((DWORD *) pInput, (DWORD *)(pInput + 4));
 //meaning the code is passing the first two if statements and then leaves the loop and the function. From my point of view,the solution is hidden somewhere inside the encipher function: void cBlowFish::Blowfish_encipher(DWORD *xl, DWORD *xr)
{
union aword Xl, Xr;

Xl.dword = *xl;
Xr.dword = *xr;

Xl.dword ^= PArray [0];
ROUND(Xr, Xl, 1);  
ROUND(Xl, Xr, 2);
ROUND(Xr, Xl, 3);  
ROUND(Xl, Xr, 4);
ROUND(Xr, Xl, 5);  
ROUND(Xl, Xr, 6);
ROUND(Xr, Xl, 7);  
ROUND(Xl, Xr, 8);
ROUND(Xr, Xl, 9);  
ROUND(Xl, Xr, 10);
ROUND(Xr, Xl, 11); 
ROUND(Xl, Xr, 12);
ROUND(Xr, Xl, 13); 
ROUND(Xl, Xr, 14);
ROUND(Xr, Xl, 15); 
ROUND(Xl, Xr, 16);
Xr.dword ^= PArray [17];

*xr = Xl.dword;
*xl = Xr.dword;
}
 The definitions: #define S(x,i)  		(SBoxes[i][x.w.byte##i])
#define bf_F(x) 		(((S(x,0) + S(x,1)) ^ S(x,2)) + S(x,3))
#define ROUND(a,b,n)    (a.dword ^= bf_F(b) ^ PArray[n])
 The problem is that the Blowfish_Encipher function in C++ has two parameters:Input(xl) as dword and Output(xr) as dword. The C# Blowfish Encrypt_Block function has four parameters,why?         public void EncryptBlock(uint hi,uint lo,out uint outHi,out uint outLo)
 Unlike the C++ blowfish,EncryptBlock calls Encrypt instead Encrypt to call EncryptBlock.Maybe EncryptBlock is NOT the C++ Blowfish_Encipher? Anyway,my problem is that when I call the C++ code with that array of 6 bytes requesting the blowfish to encode only the last 4 bytes,it does it. While If I call the encrypt function in C# with those 4 bytes,it returns 0x00.(If you'd like to see the C# Blowfish,check my first lines - I have added a hyperlink there). Note I can't change the packet structure,it should be just like that,but encrypted. I also tried this: Knowing the C++ Encrpypt functions executes only one call - blowfish Encipher.I tried to call EncryptBlock in C# directly,but there are Hi Uint32 and Low Uint32 as input and output,how to spread them into HI or LO? Will this work if the Encrypt_Block calls blowfish Encrypt in C#? I'm quite not sure. Thank you in advance!

@LINK:/questions/704858/why-doesnt-jquery-append-work-for-the-end-of-html-list-items
@TITLE:Why doesn't jQuery Append work for the end of HTML List Items?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to clone a list item, and then append it to the bottom of that cloned list item, note that it should be below the list item being cloned, not at the bottom of the list as I can do that myself. The purpose is to use it with jQuery.ui sortable. Everything is working fine, in fact I can even get the cloning and the appending right. However, it appends it before the closing </li> tag, and for the life of me I can't force it to append after this tag. This is the HTML Markup: <ul id="column-2" class="connectedSortable">
    <li class="ui-state-default">
    	<div class="label">feature</div>
    	<div class="action">
    		<div class="delete"></div>
    		<div class="other"></div>
    	</div>
    </li>
</ul>
 The part we're concerned with is class="other" which upon being clicked on will duplicate the list item. This is the jQuery so far: // This works fine
$(".other").click(function() {

    // This needs to be set (global) to be used later on in some future code.
    actionTarget = this; 		

    // This grabs the whole list item
    var targetStory = $(actionTarget).parent().parent();

    // This clones the list item, as well as appending 
    // that clone to the cloned list item
    $(targetStory).clone().appendTo(targetStory);

})
 This works well, it grabs the list item, clones it, then dumps it on the screen - but in the wrong place :( <ul id="column-2" class="connectedSortable">
    <li class="ui-state-default">
    	<div class="label">feature</div>
    	<div class="action">
    		<div class="delete"></div>
    		<div class="other"></div>
    	</div>
    	<li class="ui-state-default">
       		<div class="label">feature</div>
       		<div class="action">
       			<div class="delete"></div>
       			<div class="other"></div>
       		</div>
    	</li>
    </li>
</ul>
 Anyone have any idea why it's not appending to the end of the list item being cloned, and how to resolve this?
@CODE:</li> <ul id="column-2" class="connectedSortable">
    <li class="ui-state-default">
    	<div class="label">feature</div>
    	<div class="action">
    		<div class="delete"></div>
    		<div class="other"></div>
    	</div>
    </li>
</ul> class="other" // This works fine
$(".other").click(function() {

    // This needs to be set (global) to be used later on in some future code.
    actionTarget = this; 		

    // This grabs the whole list item
    var targetStory = $(actionTarget).parent().parent();

    // This clones the list item, as well as appending 
    // that clone to the cloned list item
    $(targetStory).clone().appendTo(targetStory);

}) <ul id="column-2" class="connectedSortable">
    <li class="ui-state-default">
    	<div class="label">feature</div>
    	<div class="action">
    		<div class="delete"></div>
    		<div class="other"></div>
    	</div>
    	<li class="ui-state-default">
       		<div class="label">feature</div>
       		<div class="action">
       			<div class="delete"></div>

 This works great, however it doesn't modify the date format: Page owner: litwareinc\treesj Last updated: 3/31/2009 10:32 PM I'm guessing the date is returned as a string so the formatting of dd/MM/yyyy does nothing. I realize modifying the regional settings on the web application might fix this however I'm more interested in how this could be implemeneted with a different format to the default.

@TITLE:Any source control systems that allow custom defined $Keywords$?
@CONTENT:I was wondering if there are any source control systems that allow administrators to define custom keywords which are replaced on check in with different behaviours (i.e. similar to $Id$ or $Author$ etc.) I'm only familiar with SVN and CVS which have a set list of keywords, but there would be applications for something like $LineNo$ or $MyLicenceText$. I'm sure there would be other use cases. The idea would be to create a plugin architecture where the behaviour of a keyword could be defined or modified. So my question is - is there a tool (commerical or open source) that already has something like that? Edit: Doing it as a part of the build is a valid way of solving the problem, however would cause issues if a developer did not do a build prior to check-in. Imagine for something like $LineNo$, if the build was not in sync with the source exactly, the value could easily be incorrect. For keywords with more static behaviour though (like $MyLicenceText$) replacement on build is a valid solution.

@LINK:/questions/703369/ant-build-consoles-get-clobbered-by-dependent-projects-in-eclipse
@TITLE:Ant build consoles get clobbered by dependent projects in Eclipse
@CONTENT:I have a set of dependent projects in Eclipse, each with its own Ant build script. If I make a change in multiple projects, then select "Build All" (Ctrl+B), each Ant build is invoked in the correct order. But if there is an error in one project, Eclipse still tries to build the other projects also, and in the process clobbers the Ant console so that the build errors are no longer visible. This wouldn't be quite so annoying if I could open up the offending project and select "Build Project", but Eclipse out-smarts me: it won't rebuild until I open some file in the project, edit it, and save (typically I add and remove a space character wherever my cursor happens to be). An answer to any of the following questions would be welcome. How can I configure Eclipse to (in preference order): terminate a "Build All" as soon as any project's Ant build fails? save all console output for "Build All" instead of resetting the console for each project? spawn a separate console for each new instance of Ant? allow me to force a "Build Project" even if it doesn't think anything has changed? [UPDATE] Bonus Question: How can I configure Eclipse so that fixing any build errors in a depended-on project counts as a "change" for the purposes of "Build Project"?

@TITLE:SerialPort.Open() freezes the system if data was received previously (Compact Framework)
@CONTENT:I have a very weird problem here, maybe you guys can help me out. I have a Windows CE 6 device that uses a barcode card reader connected through a serial port. I'm using the Compact Framework's (v2.0) SerialPort class to handle this, and everything has been working fine. There's one problem, however. If a card is swiped at any point before the serial port is opened, the entire system freezes at the Open() call. No exceptions, no warnings, just a complete system freeze for no reason. I tried clearing the buffers before opening the port but apparently that method can only be used after the port has been opened because I got an InvalidOperationException. I made a simplified version of the code to see if the complexity had anything to do with it, but a simple form with a button that opens the port will freeze in the same way. Here's the simplified code: private void btConnect_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
            try
            {
                this.serialPort = new SerialPort(this.txName.Text, Convert.ToInt32(this.txBaud.Text));
                this.serialPort.RtsEnable = this.chRTS.Checked;

                this.serialPort.Open(); //it freezes here
                this.btConnect.Text = "Disconnect";

                this.txName.Enabled = false;
                this.txBaud.Enabled = false;
                this.chRTS.Enabled = false;
            }
            catch
            {
                MessageBox.Show("Failed to open port. Please check your settings and try again.", "Operation failed", MessageBoxButtons.OK, MessageBoxIcon.Hand, MessageBoxDefaultButton.Button1);
            }}
 I can't see what I'm doing wrong, I'm starting to think that it's a bug in the compact framework. The card reader sends packets such as F03030DKD03003\r\n. Any ideas? Thanks in advance.

@CONTENT:This might be a too bigger ask, but before I outsource it, I would like to try to understand it first, and do it for myself. I am working on a project that involves an existing database. I am building the site around the existing data, but have run into issues with timestamps. Basically, I am hoping someone can give me a snippet example of what I would need(function, or class) to achieve this: Each user in the database has tables of data which includes content like blogs, articles, and other input containing timestamps for dates. Each user also has a timezone code(i.e: 10+, 12-, 1+, and so on and so forth) which they manually selected upon signup, to make any timestamps applicable to their timezone. I need to create a function(or class) that enables me to collect the users timezone, and convert any timestamps to be applicable to the users timezone code. Example: $timestamp = $rows[blogentry_date]; //Just an example of a query result
$users_timeszone_code = TheFunctionI_NeedHelpCreating() // Hopefully collects users 
// timezone code, and converts it to a supported 
// timezone using date_default_timezone_set()??(just a guess)
CreateDate($users_timeszone_code, $timestamp);
 Example Output: 12, Monday 2007. 5:00am // Just as an example
 Does this make sense? I hope my examples haven't made things worst, but i find it easier explaining what im thinking in little code snippets than with words..lol. Any help will be greatly appreciated. Cheers, and thanks.

@TITLE:ASP.NET code inside Google Maps info window
@CONTENT:Clarification: Put simply, I'd like to put an ASP.NET UpdatePanel inside the info window of Google Maps. This would mean that users could interact with my application from within an info window, without refreshing the page and without closing the currently open info window. Does anyone know if this is possible? Update: Thank you to all those who have so far responded. Very much appreciated. What I have gleaned from the answers is that: the update panel has it's own "mysterious mechanics" which might be causing the UpdatePanel to not work correctly inside the InfoWindow. Going down the more direct route of using JQuery to make ajax calls to simple web services should eliminate the hidden complexity of the UpdatePanel and enable the functionality I want. I am still intrigued as to why the UpdatePanel approach does not work, and as to why using one would "break the model" of Google Maps, when surely an UpdatePanel merely renders as HTML and javascript with a link to the XMLHttpRequest object. Is it possible to place ASP.NET code inside Google Maps info window? I'd like to place an UpdatePanel with some AJAXified asp:Button's inside the info window. AFAICT you simply provide the HTML to place in the info window as a string, so was thinking of rendering a UserControl to a string and placing that string in the info window for the browser to render. Does anyone know if this is likely to work? If this is not possible in Google maps, does anyone have any idea whether such an implementation would be possible with the corresponding Virtual Earth technology?

@CONTENT:I'm just after a bit of advice - I am building an online store (using php/mysql) and at present can view current orders by clicking through to the relevant section and applying filters etc. An email is also sent to my inbox. Because of the nature of the business (orders need to be prepared and dispatched within half hour), I would like to have a page on my website that displays orders 'live' as they come through the website, that I can manage and mark off as they are fulfilled. What would be the best approach to take for this??

@TITLE:Is dynamically allocated memory (heap), local to a function or can all functions in a thread have access to it even without passing pointer as an argument
@CONTENT:I have a very basic question and need help. I am trying to understand what is the scope of a dynamically allocated memory (on heap). #include <stdio.h>
#include <malloc.h>

//-----Struct def-------
struct node {
    	int x;
    	int y;
};

//------GLOBAL DATA------

//-----FUNC DEFINITION----
void funct(){
  t->x = 5; //**can I access 't' allocated on heap in main over here ?**
  t->y = 6; //**can I access 't' allocated on heap in main over here ?**
  printf ("int x = %d\n", t->x);
  printf ("int y = %d\n", t->y);
  return;
}

//-----MAIN FUNCTION------
int main(void){
      struct node * t = NULL;// and what difference will it make if I define 
                                 //it outside main() instead- as a global pointer variable
          t = (struct node *) malloc (sizeof(struct node));
      t->x = 7;
      t->y = 12;
      printf ("int x = %d\n", t->x);
      printf ("int y = %d\n", t->y);

    funct(); // FUNCTION CALLED**
    return 0;
}
 So, here can I access structure 't' in funct() even though the memory is allocated in main() without passing argument (pointer to t to function funct) - since heap is common to a thread ? And what difference will it make if I define struct node * t = NULL outside of main() as a global variable and is there anything wrong with it ? Thanks
@CODE:#include <stdio.h>
#include <malloc.h>

  printf ("int x = %d\n", t->x);
  printf ("int y = %d\n", t->y);
  return;
}

//-----MAIN FUNCTION------
int main(void){
      struct node * t = NULL;// and what difference will it make if I define

 TcmDataPanel is a (3rd generation) TFrame descendent. It's not used directly, but rather multiple other compound components descend from it. TcmDataConnector is a component which holds the database connection information for these other components. I'm using ModelMaker, and am trying to implement an Observer pattern so that multiple "Data Panels" can be automatically updated whenever the "Data Connector" changes state. Here's my problem: I can't seem to get around the "circular refernece" problem, as each class uses the other in the Interface section. Putting the associated "uses" reference in the Interface section doesn't clear up the "Undeclared identifier" issue, and putting them both in the same unit doesn't either. Right now they are in the same unit (I've tried them in separate units, and together), and I get the "Undeclared identifier: TcmTPDataConnector" error. How can I get around this? ================ UPDATE: It's Friday night at 9:30pm where I am, and I was totally stuck. Just MINUTES after my post, you people SAVED THE DAY!! (night!) THANK YOU!!

@TITLE:Full VCL Class Browser for Delphi
@CONTENT:Remember the old class hierarchy posters that used to come w/Delphi? I'm wanting a full class hierarchy browser for ALL my Delphi classes, including the custom ones I've built and installed on the palette, plus third-party components. Ideally easily searchable by class name (including "whole word only" searches, so partial matches don't count). I've only seen two things that come close: 1) GExpets Class Browser - Works great, BUT doesn't automatically load ALL installed components / classes, which is what I want. You have to import all the source units manually, as far as I can tell.... which can be quite a hassle. It also doesn't allow "whole word only" searches, so sometimes searching for a class w/a common "sub name" takes forever. 2) Eagle / DevExpress CDK - It loads the full class list automatically, and seems to work brilliantly, but it's only usable in D7 and prior, and it's not really focused on being a class browser per se, so much as an "inherit from" chooser. Is there anything out there which does this already? If not, how difficult would it be to write an app that, at bare minimum, builds a self-referencing class-name table, so I could at least throw it into a database / treeview component to easily view inheritance / ancestry, etc.?

@TITLE:GXT KeyListener.componentKeyDown() immediately closes MessageBox.alert()
@CONTENT:In GXT, MessageBox methods are asynchronous, meaning that the application does not "lock up" while the message box is displayed. I using a KeyListener to process enter key presses in a form (to increase usability, i.e., allowing the form to be submitted by the enter key) and subsequently disabling the form fields while the application processes the user's credentials. If they are incorrect, I show a MessageBox.alert() and then re-enable the form fields. However, since alert() returns immediately, the form fields are immediately made available again, allowing the user to input data without closing the alert. The solution is to use a callback in alert(); however, the enter keypress not only causes the form to submit, but also causes the alert to immediately dismiss (as if both the form and the message box are processing the enter key). How do I keep the alert box open until the user presses enter a second time or clicks the "Ok" button?

@TITLE:ASP.NET web.config authorization settings ignored
@CONTENT:I have an asp.net (dynamic data) website set up as an application in a subdirectory of another site. This site requires different security settings from the top level site. Something like:     <authorization>
       <allow roles="ADMIN"/>

    </authorization>
 These settings are ignored in the sub site. However, they work on the top level site, but even when set on the top level site, they are not inherited by the sub-site, and it's freely accessible. What could cause these settings to be ignored? I've tried adding: <location path="." inheritInChildApplications="false">

@TITLE:How can I permit tab characters in a textfield in Flash?
@CONTENT:I am working on an AS3 Flash game that initially takes a input from a barcode scanner. The data that it scans comes in as one long string using tabs to separate the data segments. The scanner acts as a keyboard and inputs the string into a hidden textfield so that I can grab the string and split it apart to get the data. The input and everything works great. The issue that I am running into is that when the the textfield receives a tab character, instead of inserting the character into the textfield it highlights whatever is in the textfield. Then the next set of characters overwrite what was already in the textfield. Is there any way around this? Is there some way to make the textfield accept the tab as a literal character? I cannot change the way the barcode delimits the data in the string. Thanks for any help you can give.

@LINK:/questions/687995/what-is-the-best-way-to-store-a-threaded-message-list-tree-in-sql
@TITLE:What is the best way to store a threaded message list/tree in SQL?
@CONTENT:I'm looking for the best way to store a set of "posts" as well as comments on those posts in SQL. Imagine a design similar to a "Wall" on Facebook where users can write posts on their wall and other users can comment on those posts. I need to be able to display all wall posts as well as the comments. When I first started out, I came up with a table such as: CREATE Table wallposts
(
 id uuid NOT NULL,
 posted timestamp NOT NULL,
 userid uuid NOT NULL,
 posterid uuid NOT NULL,
 parentid uuid NOT NULL,
 comment text NOT NULL
)
 id is unique, parentid will be null on original posts and point to an id if the row is a comment on an existing post. Easy enough and super fast to insert new data. However, doing a select which would return me: POST 1
COMMENT 1
COMMENT 2
POST 2
COMMENT 1
COMMENT 2
 Regardless of which order the rows existed in the database proved to be extremely difficult. I obviously can't just order by date, as someone might comment on post 1 after post 2 has been posted. If I do a LEFT JOIN to get the parent post on all rows, and then sort by that date first, all the original posts group together as they'd have a value of null. Then I got this idea: CREATE TABLE wallposts
(
 id uuid NOT NULL,
 threadposted timestamp,
 posted timestamp,
 ...
 comment text
)
 On an original post, threadposted and posted would be the same. On a comment, timestamp would be the time the original post was posted and "posted" would be the time the comment on that thread was posted. Now I can just do: select * from wallposts order by threadposted, posted;
 This works great, however one thing irks me. If two people create a post at the same time, comments on the two posts would get munged together as they'd have the same timestamp. I could use "ticks" instead of a datetime, but still the accuracy is only 1/1000 of a second. I could also setup a unique constraint on threadposted and posted which makes inserts a bit more expensive, but if I had multiple database servers in a farm, the chance of a collision is still there. I almost went ahead with this anyway since the chances of this happening are extremely small, but I wanted to see if I could eat my cake and still have it too. Mostly for my own educational curiosity. Third solution would be to store this data in the form of a graph. Each node would have a v-left and v-right pointer. I could order by "left" which would traverse the tree in the order I need. However, every time someone inserts a comment I'd have to re balance the whole tree. This would create a ton of row locking, and all sorts of problems if the site was very busy. Plus, it's kinda extreme and also causes replication problems. So I tossed this idea quickly. I also thought about just storing the original posts and then serializing the comments in a binary form, since who cares about individual comments. This would be very fast, however if a user wants to delete their comment or append a new comment to the end, I have to deserialize this data, modify the structure, then serialize it back and update the row. If a bunch of people are commenting on the same post at the same time, I might have random issues with that. So here's what I eventually did. I query for all the posts ordered by date entered. In the middle ware layer, I loop through the recordset and create a "stack" of original posts, each node on the stack points to a linked list of comments. When I come across an original post, I push a new node on the stack and when I come across a comment I add a node to the linked list. I organize this in memory so I can traverse the recordset once and have O(n). After I create the in-memory representation of the wall, I traverse through this data structure again and write out HTML. This works great and has super fast inserts and super fast selects, and no weird row locking issues; however it's a bit heavier on my presentation layer and requires me to build an in memory representation of the user's wall to move stuff around so it's in the right order. Still, I believe this is the best approach I've found so far. I thought I'd check with other SQL experts to see if there's a better way to do this using some weird JOINS or UNIONS or something which would still be performant with millions of users.

@TITLE:Why would AccessDataSource return different results to query in Access?
@CONTENT:I have a query to return random distinct rows from an Access database. Here is the query: SELECT * FROM 
(SELECT DISTINCT m.MemberID, m.Title, m.FullName, m.Address, 
        m.Phone, m.EmailAddress, m.WebsiteAddress FROM Members AS m INNER JOIN MembersForType AS t ON m.MemberID = t.MemberID WHERE 
(Category = 'MemberType1' OR Category = 'MemberType2')) as Members 
ORDER BY RND(members.MemberID) DESC
 When I run this in Access it returns the rows in different order every time, as per the random sort order. When I run it through my web app however the rows return in the same order every time. Here is how I call it in my code-behind: private void BindData()
{
    using (AccessDataSource ds = new AccessDataSource("~/App_Data/mydb.mdb", GetSQLStatement()))
    {
        ds.DataSourceMode = SqlDataSourceMode.DataReader;
        ds.CacheDuration = 0;
        ds.CacheExpirationPolicy = DataSourceCacheExpiry.Absolute;
        ds.EnableCaching = false;            
        listing.DataSource = ds.Select(new DataSourceSelectArguments());
        listing.DataBind();
        if (listing.Items.Count == 0)
            noResults.Visible = true;
        else
            noResults.Visible = false;
    }
}
 I added in all that stuff about caching because I thought maybe the query was being cached but the result was the same. I put a breakpoint in the code to make sure the query was the same as above and it was. Any ideas? This is driving me nuts.

@TITLE:Executing javascript code upon the load (and inside) of a javascript Modalbox
@CONTENT:What i'm exactly trying to do is make my script.aculo.us Autocompleter work for my form when it is loaded inside a Modalbox object. Of course, i've tried my Autocompleter when loading the form as standalone and it works just as expected. For reference, here is my JS code loading the feature: Event.observe(window, 'load', function() { 
new Ajax.Autocompleter("gl_name", "autocomplete_choices", "<? echo WEB_ROOT . $page_name; ?>?action=ajax_autocomplete", {
    paramName: "value",
    minChars: 2,
    indicator: 'indicator1',
    afterUpdateElement: getSelectionIdGL
    });
});
 Then I have my Autocompleter div and indicator which appear at the end of my html's body: <span id="indicator1" style="display: none">
    <img src="/images/spinner.gif" alt="Working..." />
</span>
<div id="autocomplete_choices" class="autocomplete"></div>
 I also called the Modalbox() with evalScripts: true. So I basically know where my problem is: I want my autocompleters to be created a the load of the form, but the "window" object is already loaded when the script is written since it's basically the same window as the calling page. That said, I honestly don't see to which event it could ever be actually triggered. I don't even know if it's actually possible, but I certainly hope it is. So.. that's about it. I don't know what else to add. Don't hesitate if you need any clarifications on my issue.

}
 The error is: Cannot implicitly convert type 'ulong' to 'byte'.

@TITLE:Retrieving Device Context from .NET print API
@CONTENT:I am working on a .NET application to control DataCard Desktop Card printers, and I have stumbled upon a problem. In order to execute Magnetic Stripe and Chip encoding, I have to call a function in a native printer API dll to enable the printers Interactive mode. I have managed to create the P/Invoke code to call this native function. But the problem is that this method takes the printer Device Context handle as a parameter, and have to be called BEFORE the Gdi32 StartDoc function is called. In the .NET printing API I do have access to the hDC from the Graphics object. But as far as I can see the Graphics object is only availible AFTER the StartDoc function is invoked. So my question is if anyone knows a way to retrieve the context before StartDoc is called?

@TITLE:：Already listening； when invoking an RPC call
@CONTENT:I use Microsoft RPC for interprocess communications. I have an interface with a set of methods accepting a byte pipe as an "in" parameter (IDL description): [
    uuid(ActualGuidHere), 
    version(1.0), 
    pointer_default(unique)
]

interface IMyInterface
{
    //other irrelevant methods here
    error_status_t rpcDoAction( [in] pipe byte params );
    //more irrelevant methods here
}
 every once in a while when I invoke such methods on a client side through a client stub generated by MIDL and delegated to NdrClientCall2(), it doesn't reach the server side, but NdrClientCall2() returns RPC_S_ALREADY_LISTENING ("The server is already listening") which is really confusing. I added logging into the functions used for push/pull operations during transfer - they are not ever called for any of the calls that fail this way. This implies that the transmission is not even started. I never encounter such behaviour when calling methods that don't have pipes as parameters. What might be the reason and the workaround?

Or perhaps to minimize it right after start? That would solve the focus issue from the other question and the already running problem would more or less deal with itself. Clarification issues again: the Java client and the .exe are running in Windows and I really don't have the ability to write any wrappers or make use of JNI mojo or anything like that.

@CONTENT:I'm writing Cucumber tests for a Sinatra based application using Webrat. For some tests I need to implement a scenario like Given I am logged in as admin

 I define steps like this: Given /^I am logged in as "(.+)"$/ do |user|
    visit "/login"

 and then verified in views when user tries to access admin pages via helper method: def logged_in?
    request.cookies[cookie_name] == cookie_value
end

@CONTENT:Does anyone have any thoughts on how to prevent malware attacks on standalone applications. Let's say this is a program on a Windows machine connected to the internet, this is the most common scenario. I'm also wondering what type of attacks are possible. I believe .NET will do some type of static check on the code before it runs it, using a type of checksum. This would detect a statically attached malicious code snippet. Can this be gotten around? What about dynamically injected code. Separate program spaces prevent this to some degree. What about infecting data files? Is it safer to store data in a database and only use service calls no file operations? What about memory usage techniques to increase security? I know it's not a standalone case, but, the problem with DNS server corruption had to do with a predictable use of, I think, IP addresses. Should memory usage be made more unpredictable?

 In my search, I do this:     $hits    = $index->find($q);
 This works with simple words, but when I want to do a search like "Sheba Foods" (quotes included), it returns one result, but the wrong one, which doesn't even have the word "Sheba". I moved away from MySQL full-text search because of its obvious problems, and can't make any headway with this. I've been looking at the Zend_Search_Lucene_Search_QueryParser::parse() method. Does the answer lie in this method?

@TITLE:Database Update Order
@CONTENT:I've run into a situation in our database where I need to shift the timestamps of a number of records by a day, however I have a unique constraint that requires the an id field and a timestamp field to be unique. Here is the table description. Table "public.eedata"
   Column    |              Type              |                         Modifiers

 eedata_id   | bigint                         | not null default nextval('eedata_eedata_id_seq'::regclass)
 user_id     | integer                        | 
 eeupload_id | bigint                         | 
 eetimestamp | timestamp(0) without time zone | 
Indexes:
    "pk_eedata" PRIMARY KEY, btree (eedata_id)
    "eedata_user_id_key" UNIQUE, btree (user_id, eetimestamp)
    "fki_eeuploadid" btree (eeupload_id)
Foreign-key constraints:
    "fk_eeupload_id" FOREIGN KEY (eeupload_id) REFERENCES eeupload(eeupload_id) ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELETE CASCADE
    "fk_user_id" FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id) ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELETE CASCADE
 The problem in this case is caused by the eedata_user_id_key constraint. I can successfully subtract a day using, update eedata set eetimestamp = eetimestamp - interval '1 day' where eeupload_id = xxx; because the order that it applies the update in prevents any collisions, however when I try update eedata set eetimestamp = eetimestamp + interval '1 day' where eeupload_id = xxx; I get ERROR:  duplicate key violates unique constraint "eedata_user_id_key" What I need to be able to do is either specify the order in which the update is applied (effectively an order by for an update statement) or the ability to suspend the constraint for a single update statement. I'm using Postgres 8.1.11 if that matters.

@TITLE:When sending an array of int over TCP, why are only the first amount correct?
@CONTENT:Following my previous question (Why do I get weird results when reading an array of integers from a TCP socket?), I have come up with the following code, which seems to work, sort of. The code sample works well with a small number of array elements, but once it becomes large, the data is corrupt toward the end. This is the code to send the array of int over TCP: #define ARRAY_LEN 262144

long *sourceArrayPointer = getSourceArray();

long sourceArray[ARRAY_LEN];
for (int i = 0; i < ARRAY_LEN; i++)
{
    sourceArray[i] = sourceArrayPointer[i];
}

int result = send(clientSocketFD, sourceArray, sizeof(long) * ARRAY_LEN);
 And this is the code to receive the array of int: #define ARRAY_LEN 262144

long targetArray[ARRAY_LEN];
int result = read(socketFD, targetArray, sizeof(long) * ARRAY_LEN);
 The first few numbers are fine, but further down the array the numbers start going completely different. At the end, when the numbers should look like this: 0
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
 But they actually come out as this? 4310701
0
-12288
32767

0

 Is this because I'm using the wrong send/recieve size?

The management-application should be able to write some files that the outwards-facing application can read (data-files that are used to supply responses to requests from the internet) and the outwards-facing application should be able to write a file that the management can read (log-file). My question is: what is the best place to store these files? Application Data/[Company Name]/[Product Name]? An APP_DATA under one of the web-applications? Somewhere else? Some factors to consider are: What extra permissions do the solution need? Can the web-applications discover the location without needing to know where the other application has been installed?

@TITLE:Reason for CSS property precedence?
@CONTENT:I actually know how the browsers tend to render the following examples (results based on Opera 9.5 and Firefox 3.0), but I don't understand the reason behind them. Take this example, <style type="text/css">

</style>

<div id="outer" class="outer">
    <div id="inner" class="inner">
    	<span>testing</span>

 The result is blue text. However, now see this example, <style type="text/css">
#outer span{color:red;}
.inner span{color:blue;}
</style>

<div id="outer" class="outer">
    <div id="inner" class="inner">

 The text is now red. Finally, try this, <style type="text/css">
#outer span{color:red;}
#inner span{color:blue;}
</style>

<div id="outer" class="outer">
    <div id="inner" class="inner">

@CONTENT:(Forgive me because I do not write in Java very often.) I'm writing a client-side network application in Java and I'm having an interesting issue. Every call to readInt() throws an EOFException. The variable is of type DataInputStream (initialized as: DataInputStream din = new DataInputStream(new BufferedInputStream(sock.getInputStream())); where sock is of type Socket). Now, sock.isInputShutdown() returns false and socket.isConnected() returns true. I'm assuming that this means that I have a valid connection to the other machine I'm connecting to. I've also performed other checks to ensure that I'm properly connected to the other machine. Is it possible that the DataInputStream was not set up correctly? Are there any preconditions that I have missed? Any help is greatly appreciated. @tofubeer: I actually wrote 17 bytes to the socket. The socket is connected to another machine and I'm waiting on input from that machine (I'm sorry if this was unclear). I successfully read from the stream (to initiate a handshake) first and this worked just fine. I'm checking now to see if my sent-requests are malformed, but I don't think they are. Also, I tried reading a single byte from the stream (via read()) and it returned -1.

 Correct? Is there anything that could go wrong with that regex that will not get it to match with the above input? Full usage here: while(!feof($handle))

 Could how much that is being read by fread be effecting the regex to work correctly? I really need confirmation as I am trying to identify why it isn't working on a new server. This question is related to Change in Server Permits script not to work. Can this be due to PHP.ini being different?

I want to do a query that will return every row of the main table, with the columns of the main table, and a the columns from only a single row (doesn't matter which) of the sub-table, if there are any, otherwise NULL in those columns. Of course if I just do a basic LEFT OUTER JOIN then of course I get the main table repeated multiple times, one for each match in the sub-table. I'm sure I have seen this done before using a LEFT OUTER JOIN and some sort of trickery that forces only one row to be selected from the sub-table, not all of them -- maybe picking out the minimum or maximum OID.

@TITLE:LocationMatch and DAV svn
@CONTENT:I am trying to make our subversion repository accessible via multiple URLs. To do so, I was thinking to use the LocationMatch directive. My configuration is: <Location ~ "/(svn|repository)">
  DAV svn
  SVNPath /opt/svn
  AuthzSVNAccessFile /etc/subversion/access
</Location>
 The above configuration does NOT work ... Strange thing is that if i use for example this configuration, it works well for both URLs: <Location ~ "/(svn|repository)">
  SetHandler server-status
</Location>
 For me it looks like the combination of DAV svn and LocationMatch does not really work... or am I doing something wrong here?
@CODE:<Location ~ "/(svn|repository)">
  DAV svn
  SVNPath /opt/svn
  AuthzSVNAccessFile /etc/subversion/access

@TITLE:Delete rows from two tables
@CONTENT:I have two tables. Those tables have two relation between them. Table 1

Table 2

 Those two relations exists. Table 1 -< Table2

insert into @table

delete from Table2

delete from Table

 I have read that this is typically the fault of missing libraries. I know the C & FORTRAN code compiles fine seperatly (respective libraries included) as does the C++ code when compiled on its own. This leads me to believe that it is the interface between the two programs that causes the error. Unfortunatly I've little to no experiance debugging this sort of problem and without any clues from the linker its hard to move forward. I'll include the necessary parts of my program that deal with the interface between the two sides of the program. First the C++ part: SA.h, SA.cpp SA.h: class SimAnneal {
    ...
    std::vector<float> DensityArray; 
    std::vector<float> EnergyArray;
  public
    double ObjFunction ();
    ...
}
 SA.ccp: #include <math.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>  		
#include <time.h>   		
#include <vector>
#include "SA.h"
#include "CFE.h"
#include "randomc.h"  //Includes mersenne.cpp

double SimAnneal::ObjFunction () 
{
    CFE(&DensityArray[0], &EnergyArray[0]); 

      // sends pointers of both arrays to CFE.c and modifies EnergyArray as 
      // shown in CFE.c

    double SumStrainEnergy = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < EnergyArray.size(); i++)
    {
    	SumStrainEnergy += EnergyArray[i];  //Effectively sum of array 
                                                //engy[] from CFE.c
    }

    return SumStrainEnergy;
}
 Secondly the C/FORTRAN part: CFE.h, CFE.c CFE.h: #ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#endif 

void CFE(float density[], float energy[]);

#ifdef __cplusplus
 }
#endif
 CFE.c: #include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <math.h>
#include "BCs.h"
#include "EMatrix.h"
#include "Numbering.h"
#include "KMatrix.h"
#include "fg_types.h"
#include "Solve.h"

void CFE(float density[], float energy[])
{
    ...stuff...

    float * dens;
    dens = density;  //pass pointer of array density[0] in SA.cpp to CFE.c

    ...more stuff....

    float * engy;
    engy = energy; //pass pointer of array energy[0] in SA.cpp to CFE.c

    ***Modify engy in some respects****    
}
 Essentially the ObjFunction in SA.cpp is called in main.cpp, which contains main(). Is there any visible fault? Is there any way I can ask the linker to announce what causes / where the error occours in the linking? Any help will be much appriciated. Thank you. +++ EDIT: Verbose feedback +++ birch $ g++ -v Hello.cpp

@TITLE:Need MySQL INSERT - SELECT query for tables with millions of records
@CONTENT:I am trying to take one step towards optimizing a 90GB+ table: Old Table Every day the table grabs approx. 750,000 records from an external source and adds them to the table with the new date. This has been going on for three years from what I understand. 97% of the records don't change from one day to the next. New Table I am trying to go through old table (millions and millions of records) and eliminate redundancy which will likely reduce the table size quite dramatically. old_table date record_id data_field (really many fields, but for the sake of the example) new_table_index date index_id new_table index_id record_id data_field Logic as we go through each record in old_table if (record_id is not in new_table) or (record_id is in new_table, but the latest entry of it has a different data_field) insert it into the new_table and get the index_id else get the latest entry index_id for that record_id from the new_table_index always insert the index_id and date into the new_table_index Any thoughts on optimal ways to do this? I am not advanced enough with MySQL to put this all together. When I tried writing a script in PHP it used up 3GB of memory and then failed. Other suggestions or queries??? Thanks so much!

@TITLE:How would you model data variables variance on common scheme? SQL
@CONTENT:I was thinking about some stuff lately and I was wondering what would be the RIGHT way to do something like the following scenario (I'm sure it is a quite common thing for DB guys to do something like it). Let's say you have a products table, something like this (MySQL): CREATE TABLE `products` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
  `product_name` varchar(255) default NULL,
  `product_description` text,
  KEY `id` (`id`),
  KEY `product_name` (`product_name`)
) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;
 Nothing out of the ordinary here. Now lets say that there are a hierarchy of categories in a different table, and there is a separate table which binds many-to-many relationships with products table - so that each product belongs to some kind of a category (I'll omit those, because thats not the issue here). Now comes the interesting part - what IF each of the categories mandates additional set of variables to the product items. For example products in the computer monitors category must have LCD/CRT enum field, screen size enum etc. - and some other category, lets say ice creams have some other variables like flavor varchar, shelf storage time int etc. The problem herein lies in that all products have a common set of variables (id, name, description and sort of like that), but there are additional variables which are not consistent from category to category - but all products should share common set, because in the end they all belong to the products group, so one can query for example SELECT * FROM products ORDER BY company_id (trivial example, maybe not representative, but you get the picture). Now, I see severa potential resolutions: - generate separate table for each product category and store products there with appropriate additional variables - stupid and not query friendly - product table stays the same with common variables, and for each category create a separate table with additional variables binding two tables with a JOIN - normalized, but query performance and clarity issues - how would one filter down products from category (1st table - products) and additional filter for extra variable (17" LCD monitors ie.) - it would require SQL JOIN trickery - products table stays the same and add another variable type text that holds for example JSON data that hold additional variables - compact and neat, but can't filter through variables with SQL I know I'm missing something quite obvious and simple here - I'm a bit rusty on the normalization techniques :) edit: I've been searching around stackoverflow before asking this question without success. However, after I've posted the question I have clicked on one of my tags 'normalization' and found several similar questions which resulted in to look up 'generalization specialization relational design'. Point of the story is that this must be the first occurrence in my internet life that tags are actually useful in search. However, I would still like to hear from you guys and your opinions. edit2: The problem with approach no.2 is that I expect somewhere around ~1000 specializations. There is a hierarchy (1-4 level deep) of categories and end nodes add specialized variables - they accumulate in the order of ~1000, so it would be a bit unpractical to add specialized tables to join with. edit3: Due to the vast number of attribute volatility in my case "entity attribute value" that was suggested looks like the way to go. Here comes query nightmares! Thanks guys.

@TITLE:Error in returning a pointer from a function that points to an array
@CONTENT:I'm in a bit of a fiddle in that I don't know why my code brings up the following error when compiling: 1>..\SA.cpp(81) : error C2664: 'CFE' : cannot convert parameter 1 from 'int' to 'int []'
1>        Conversion from integral type to pointer type requires reinterpret_cast, C-style cast or function-style cast
 Essentially I am trying to: Step1: Convert from a vector to an array using: int* VecToArray(vector<int> Vec)
{
    int ary[Vec.size()];

    for(int i = 0; i < Vec.size(); i++)
        ary[i] = Vec[i];

    return ary;
}
 Step2: Calling upon a function into which the array is an paremeter and it returns a pointer from a newly generated array: int* CFE(int density[])
{
   ...do stuff to generate 'double Energy[]'....

    return Energy;
}
 Step 3: Using this pointer in a third function to calcualte the sum of Energy[]: double ObjFunction (double *E_Array) 
{
    double SumEnergy = 0;

    int n = 10; // Is irrelivant

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        SumEnergy += E_Array[i];
    }

    return SumEnergy;
}
 To make for simpler coding I've used the functions like so, where VectorName is an integer vector: double TotalEnergy = ObjFunction ( CFE ( VecToArray ( VectorName ) ) );
 I am obviously getting the parameter types wrong somewhere, though I just cant see why myself. Could anyone with a more experienced eye assist in spotting it/them?

Are there any drawbacks to having Visual Studio running on the desktop and simply using the laptop as a way to access it remotely? I'd guess that the only thing that you would be concerned about would be the network latency, but if the two computers are on the same network that should be minimal.

@TITLE:What's the best candidate padding char for url-safe and filename-safe base64?
@CONTENT:The padding char for the official base64 is '=', which might need to be percent-encoded when used in a URL. I'm trying to find the best padding char so that my encoded string can be both url safe (I'll be using the encoded string as parameter value, such as id=encodedString) AND filename safe (I'll be using the encoded string directly as filename). Dot ('.') is a popular candidate, it's url safe but it's not exactly filename safe: Windows won't allow a file name which ends with a trailing dot. '!' seems to be a viable choice, although I googled and I've never seen anybody using it as the padding char. Any ideas? Thanks! Update: I replaced "+" with "-" (minus) and replaced "/" with "_" (underscore) in my customized base64 encoding already, so '-' or '_' is not available for the padding char any more.

Would it be possible instead to keep the cell offscreen, route mouse and keyboard events to it, and paint it onto the cell?

@TITLE:How to do this query in Mysql?
@CONTENT:I have 3 tables, message, subject and message_subject_rel. The idea is to have messages that can relate to a lot of subjects and then do a cross subject search. Lets say I have a message: Id: 1, Message: This is a message
 2 subjects: Id:1, Subject: Math
Id:2, Subject: Science
 And there's 2 message_subject_rel entries that go: Id: 1, message_id: 1, subject_id: 1
Id: 2, message_id: 1, subject_id: 2
 If i wanted to search the messages that are related with math, I would do a simple join with the 3 tables and the where clause would be subject = "Math" But what I don't know how to do, is search for the messages that are related with math AND Science. If i do a simple join i get tables with something like: id  message 	user_id 	created_at 	ip 	id 	message_id 	subject_id 	id 	subject
 And if I do a where subject = "Math" and subject = "Science" i wont get any results because each message will only have 1 subject related in each row, but duplicated rows for messages with more than 1 subject. So, what do you recommend?
@CODE:message_subject_rel Id: 1, Message: This is a message Id:1, Subject: Math
Id:2, Subject: Science message_subject_rel Id: 1, message_id: 1, subject_id: 1

engine.Runtime.LoadAssembly(typeof(BuildMetaData).Assembly);
engine.ExecuteFile(buildFile);
var klass = engine.Runtime.Globals.GetVariable("get_metadata");

@CONTENT:Which free database would you use for a relatively small datawarehouse system? Are there any 'special' databases e.g. multidimensional databases freely available? Which of the free relational databases is best suited for the job? By datawarehouse system I mean a system that will receive some inserts, few updates, next to no deletes and plenty of complex selects. Structured in star schemas (if the database is relational). By small I mean about 100.000 records in the main fact table, maybe 10 dimensions, the largest containing 5.000 records. Be free I mean free of charge of internal commercial use. Edit: Since so far I mostly only got a list of free databases, let me specify some features that would be interesting / needed: outer joins (must) inlineviews / subselects (almost must) materialized views (nice) smart query optimizer (the smarter the better) support for dimensions, roll up, cube queries (nice) analytic functions (that's the name in oracle, don't know how they are named in other databases)(nice)

@CONTENT:When deciding whether you are getting involved in a fairly big open source project in order to contribute to its code base, how significant are the project's issue tracking facilities (i.e. tracking of bugs & feature requests) for your decision to contribute or not? There are still many non-trivial (huge code base) open source projects out there, that don't formally do issue tracking - and while some contributors may indeed still do this privately in the form of miscellaneous "ToDo" lists, I have personally found the lack of availability and established use of issue tracking to be a fairly reliable indicator for a lack of organization, structure and overall project coordination.

@TITLE:Mixing custom and basic serialization?
@CONTENT:I've got a class with well over 100 properties (it's a database mapping class) and one of the properties has to be in a method. In other words this data is not exposed via a property but via methods: "ABCType GetABC(), SetABC(ABCType value)" It's all very un-C#-like. I shudder when I see it. The class needs to be serializable so it can be sent over web services, and the data exposed by the Get/Set methods needs to be serialized too. (It's in a method because of a strange thing the grid I'm using does with reflection; it can't handle objects that contain properties of the same type as the containing object. The problem property stores the original state of the database object in case a revert is required. Inefficient implementation, yes - but I'm unable to re-engineer it.) My question is this: since only this 1 field needs custom serialization code, I'd like to use custom serialization only for calling GetABC and SetABC, reverting to basic XML serialization for the rest of the class. It'll minimize potential for bugs in my serialization code. Is there a way?

@CONTENT:Our web services are accessed through a router which uses port forwarding to connect to the actual web server. When we are trying to establish a web reference in Visual Studio it seems the .NET framework returns the full URL with a port to Visual Studio for the reference during discovery. Visual Studio then tries to make a connection back to that web service to create a proxy object (or whatever) and is denied because we don't allow access on that non-standard port. Original web service URL http://webservices.example.com/SomeService.asmx
 Returned web service URL from router http://webservices.example.com:25001/SomeService.asmx
 My question is if you know how to make the .NET framework NOT include the port when returning the URL from the discovery call. Here's a diagram depicting this process:

I have some code that works perfectly on my system, and he can't seem to get it compiled. We've tracked the issue down to his copy of dev studio ignoring the preprocessor directives. For example, in the project properties under C/C++|Preprocessor|Preprocessor Directives, I add DEFINE_ME. Which should translate to a /D"DEFINE_ME" for the compiler. And it does in my development environment, but it doesn't on his. I verified that when he checks out the code from the source repository, that he has the same version of the code I do. And if I look in his Project Properties, all of the directives are there. For some reason they're just not getting passed down to the compiler. Any Ideas?

@TITLE:How do I Select all text boxes in a table excluding the last one in the table row with JQuery
@CONTENT:I want add a key up event to every text box element in a table excluding the last text box in each row. The table is dynamic on both axis. The key up event will total the values in all but the last text box. The total is then placed in the last text box for the row. The script for the totaling and setting the total all works fine. I tired the following to select the target elements: $("#Grid tr input:text:not(:last)").keyup(function(){
    //do total stuff here
})
 Unfortunately it works as documented and not as I wanted and selects all but the very last checkbox. Ideally the solution will not involve any further markup to the table example below or involve any looping. However if that is what it takes, so be it. <table id="Grid">
	<tr id="r1">
		<td>Row 1</td>
		<td><input type="text" id="txt_a1_b1"></td>
		<td><input type="text" id="txt_a1_b2"></td>
		<td><input type="text" id="txt_a1_b3"></td>
		<td><input type="text" id="txt_a1_b4"></td>
		<td><input type="text" id="total_a1"></td>
	</tr>
	<tr id="r2">
		<td>Row 2</td>
		<td><input type="text" id="txt_a2_b1"></td>
		<td><input type="text" id="txt_a2_b2"></td>
		<td><input type="text" id="txt_a2_b3"></td>
		<td><input type="text" id="txt_a2_b4"></td>
		<td><input type="text" id="total_a2"></td>
	</tr>

		<td><input type="text" id="txt_a3_b1"></td>

		<td><input type="text" id="txt_a3_b4"></td>
		<td><input type="text" id="total_a3"></td>
	</tr>
</table>
 One final point, the total text box does need to be a text box as there is also a requirement to enter a total then split it across the row and I do not want a key up function in the total text box.
@CODE:$("#Grid tr input:text:not(:last)").keyup(function(){
    //do total stuff here
}) <table id="Grid">

If I enter "make" into the windows command prompt, this appears: make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop.
 If I enter "g++" or "gdc" into the windows command prompt, this appears (or similar): 'g++' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
 So, in other words make is working but the rest isn't..but they're in the same bin folder! Has got me completely confused. If I attempt to open Cygwin Bash Shell, g++, make and GDC all work there. However, I need it to work in the command prompt so that Eclipse is able to compile the programs I write in the IDE. If you know why this is happening, please let me know.
@CODE:make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop. 'g++' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.

@TITLE:EJBs and Storing Objects in a Data Structure (Map, List, etc)
@CONTENT:Is it possible to have objects stored in a data structure for the duration of an App Server's uptime? Basically I want an EJB that interfaces with this Data Structure, but does not require a full fledged database solution. As an example I made this dummy animal object: package com.test.entities;

public class Animal implements java.io.Serializable {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 3621626745694501710L;
    private Integer id;
    private String animalName;

    public Integer getId() {
    	// TODO Auto-generated method stub
    	return id;
    }	
    public void setId(Integer id){
    	this.id=id;
    }
    public String getAnimalName(){
    	return animalName;

    }
    public void setAnimalName(String animalName){
    	this.animalName=animalName;
    }
}
 So here is the EJB Remote Interface: package com.test.beans;

import java.util.Map;

import javax.ejb.Remote;

import com.test.entities.Animal;

@Remote
public interface MapBeanRemote {

    public void addAnimal(Animal a);

    public void removaAnimal(Integer id);

    public Animal getAnimalById(Integer id);

    Map<Integer, Animal> getAllAnimals();

}
 Here is the Session Bean: package com.test.beans;

import java.util.ConcurrentHashMap;
import java.util.Map;

import javax.annotation.PostConstruct;
import javax.ejb.Stateless;

import com.test.entities.Animal;

@Stateless(mappedName="ejb/MapBean")
public class MapBean implements MapBeanRemote{

    Map<Integer, Animal> animalStore;

    @PostConstruct
    public void initialize(){
    	animalStore = new ConcurrentHashMap<Integer,Animal>();
    }

    @Override
    public void addAnimal(Animal a) {
    	if(a.getId()!=null){
    		animalStore.put(a.getId(), a);
    	}
    }

    @Override
    public Animal getAnimalById(Integer id) {
    	return animalStore.get(id);
    }

    @Override
    public void removaAnimal(Integer id) {
    	animalStore.remove(id);

    }

    @Override
    public Map<Integer, Animal> getAllAnimals() {
    	return animalStore;
    }

}
 So basically I want any client who wants to manipulate the Animal Map to go through this EJB and have each client accessing the same exact Map of objects. This example does not work good enough. After a while all of the animals are erased (I'm assuming when the EJB gets replaced from the bean pool) Could this somehow be injected as a resource?
@CODE:package com.test.entities;

public class Animal implements java.io.Serializable {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 3621626745694501710L;
    private Integer id;
    private String animalName;

    public Integer getId() {
    	// TODO Auto-generated method stub
    	return id;
    }	
    public void setId(Integer id){
    	this.id=id;
    }
    public String getAnimalName(){
    	return animalName;

    }
    public void setAnimalName(String animalName){
    	this.animalName=animalName;
    }
} package com.test.beans;

import java.util.Map;

import javax.ejb.Remote;

import com.test.entities.Animal;

@Remote
public interface MapBeanRemote {

    public void addAnimal(Animal a);

    public void removaAnimal(Integer id);

    public Animal getAnimalById(Integer id);

    Map<Integer, Animal> getAllAnimals();

} package com.test.beans;

import java.util.ConcurrentHashMap;
import java.util.Map;

import javax.annotation.PostConstruct;
import javax.ejb.Stateless;

import com.test.entities.Animal;

@Stateless(mappedName="ejb/MapBean")
public class MapBean implements MapBeanRemote{

    Map<Integer, Animal> animalStore;

    @PostConstruct
    public void initialize(){
    	animalStore = new ConcurrentHashMap<Integer,Animal>();
    }

    @Override
    public void addAnimal(Animal a) {
    	if(a.getId()!=null){
    		animalStore.put(a.getId(), a);
    	}
    }

    @Override
    public Animal getAnimalById(Integer id) {
    	return animalStore.get(id);
    }

    @Override
    public void removaAnimal(Integer id) {
    	animalStore.remove(id);

    }

@CONTENT:I have a Windows application in .Net 2.0 that uses several levels of configuration files. For reasons out of my control, the application consists of a Windows app (.exe) project and several DLLs, each of which has its own app.config file. I have successfully figured out how to read the config file for each DLL, using (in C#) ConfigurationManager.OpenMappedExeConfiguration("my DLL's config file path", ConfigurationUserLevel.None);
 This works just fine - I can confirm that I get a Configuration object from this method when pointed to the file path name of my DLL's configuration file ("foo.dll.config"). However, when I try to access a custom configuration section, I get an exception saying that the data type for my custom configuration section cannot be found. What else do I need to do to get the typing information available to my code when loading a configuration file in this manner?

@CONTENT:I'm writing some little applications that parse the source of a few web pages, extract some data, and save it into another format. Specifically, some of my banks don't provide downloads of transactions/statements but they do provide access to those statements on their websites. I've done one fine, but another (HSBC UK) is proving a pain in the arse, since its source is not valid XHTML. For example there is whitespace before the <?xml?> tag, and there are places where == is used instead of = between an attribute name and its value (e.g. <li class=="lastItem">). Of course, when I pass this data into my XmlDocument, it throws a wobbly (more accurately an exception). My question is: is it possible to relax the requirements for XML parsing in C#? I know it's far better to fix these problems at source - that's absolutely my attitude too - but there's roughly zero chance HSBC would change their website which already works in most browsers just for little old me.

@LINK:/questions/632297/how-do-i-configure-my-settings-file-to-work-with-unit-tests
@TITLE:How do I configure my settings file to work with unit tests?
@CONTENT:I have a library I'm writing unit tests for. The library is used by two applications: one a Windows service, the other a command-line application that does some registry read-writes. Each has a slightly different App.config file that is loaded from the library at start-up. For example:     public RetentionService()
    {
        SettingHive = new Hive();
        TimingService = new RetentionTimingService(SettingHive);

        AppSettingsReader asr = new AppSettingsReader();
        object appsListObj = asr.GetValue(@"blocking-process-list", Type.GetType(@"System.String"));
        string appsList = appsListObj.ToString();
        _BlockingAppNames = RetentionService.ListFromList(appsList);

        string targetList = asr.GetValue(@"target-files", Type.GetType(@"System.String")).ToString();
        _TargetLogs = RetentionService.ListFromList(targetList);
    }
 When I try to use this library from a unit test, it fails to load because the application loading the library (presumably nunit) doesn't have a *.exe.config file with the appropriate keys. What's a better way to do this? I'd like the library to load the settings from each application's *.exe.config in production, but from a third location if running a unit test.
@CODE:public RetentionService()
    {
        SettingHive = new Hive();
        TimingService = new RetentionTimingService(SettingHive);

        AppSettingsReader asr = new AppSettingsReader();
        object appsListObj = asr.GetValue(@"blocking-process-list", Type.GetType(@"System.String"));
        string appsList = appsListObj.ToString();
        _BlockingAppNames = RetentionService.ListFromList(appsList);

        string targetList = asr.GetValue(@"target-files", Type.GetType(@"System.String")).ToString();
        _TargetLogs = RetentionService.ListFromList(targetList);

@TITLE:BCC never sent from Exchange 2007 using SpecifiedPickupDirectory
@CONTENT:I'm using an Exchange 2007 pickup directory to send emails from my ASP.NET application with System.Net.Mail.SmtpClient. Thus I'm using SmtpClient.DeliveryMethod = SmtpDeliveryMethod.SpecifiedPickupDirectory. It sends emails fine, but then I noticed that BCC is not working at all. The file being placed in the pickup folder seems to have the right settings, but Exchange is ignoring the X-Receiver list. Here is a sample of the EML file being created: X-Sender: "Joe" <joe@example.com>
X-Receiver: david@example.com
X-Receiver: contact@example.com
X-Receiver: lindsey@example.com
MIME-Version: 1.0
From: "Joe" <joe@example.com>

Subject: Test Message
Content-Type: text/html; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

<p>Test Message</p>
 contact@ and lindsey@ are the BCC recipients. When I use a network send, it works fine. BCC only stops working with the pickup directory. So you know, I'm using Windows Server 2008 and ASP.NET 3.5 / C#. Workaround It seems that Exchange 2007 ignores the X-Receiver and expects to see Bcc: instead. So I've resorted to doing mailMessage.Headers.Add("Bcc", bccList) where bccList is a semicolon-delimited list of the email addresses. That works fine. But as pointed Chase Seibert out if you look at the header of the message in the email client, you can still see all the X-Receivers listed. Though Bcc is stripped out and thus hidden from the recipients. So you get the effect of a Bcc with the possibility that someone will open the message and see all the Bcc's. I think the best way to suppress the X-Receivers list is to not include anything in the mailMessage.Bcc property.

@TITLE:Is it possible to style a div (and its children) with another stylesheet?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to show a print-preview div (#preview in examples). Is there a way to use print.css only for a particular div and its children overriding all local definitions? Essentially, I would like to be able to do something similar to: #preview element {
    definition equal to definition of an element in print.css
}
 in main.css, but for a long list of definitions. It's not too DRY and following option is more coherent. Second approach would be to include print.css into the main document and change each definition from element {
    definition
}
 to: element, #preview element {
     definition
}
 But that seems to me a bit cumbersome. What would be the best way to solve this problem? Update just to give an example: in the main document I have red underlined links, they should be blue undecorated in print version. So when content of preview is dynamically formed, I pop up div where all links should be blue undecorated. But only in that particular div (#preview), in the rest of the document they still would be red and underlined.
@CODE:#preview print.css #preview element {
    definition equal to definition of an element in print.css

@TITLE:.aspx page Response.BinaryWrite image on IE7
@CONTENT:I maintain an application that has a .aspx page that loads on image from the database and uses Response.BinaryWrite() to write it back to the client. This worked perfectly not long ago. Two things have changed, we upgraded the application to .NET 3.5 and they upgraded all the computers at work to IE7. Everything works fine on Firefox, but all I get in IE7 is a red X. So I assume this issue is related to IE7? Is there a security setting somewhere that would stop it from loading images from a .aspx form? It's already set to display based on the content type and not the extension. Here is some of the code. Like I said, I just maintain this app and didn't write it. I know using Session is not a great way of doing it, but it's what I have and the switch statement is just a "wtf?". <asp:image id="imgContent" runat="server" Visible="true" ImageUrl="ProductContentFormImage.aspx"></asp:image>

@TITLE:Do you use ant's <depend> task?
@CONTENT:The documentation for ant's task states: The performance of the depend task is dependent on a number of factors such as class relationship complexity and how many class files are out of date. The decision about whether it is cheaper to just recompile all classes or to use the depend task will depend on the size of your project and how interrelated your classes are. I suspect that using the task before calling may speed up the build for the project I work on, and possibly prevent the need for clean builds in certain cases. However, the ant documentation is very cryptic for this task and I could use some clarification. I work with a large code base containing about 16k classes in src and 4k classes in testsrc. We build a core jar file containing about a quarter of the classes, followed by about 15 other jars that depend on the core.jar and not each other. I would just try it out, but our build.xml requires a lot of clean-up before I can make this change, and I want to understand the task better anyway.

 But what both of us have not been able to find out: why does the above pattern produce no matches at all, while the following does: Pattern p = Pattern.compile(".*(www).*");

@CONTENT:I've implemented a data access layer that populates generic entities from a datareader using a variation of the third monkey approach (http://www.codeproject.com/KB/database/DynamicMethod_ILGenerator.aspx). This works well, performs well and saves me writing loads of repetetive code for data retrieval. Now I want to add methods that take a generic entity and convert it to a parameter list for feeding to a stored proc so that I can add data persistence to my monkey's trick collection. I found some guidance at: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms973259.aspx and some sample code in the autosproc solution. It looks good on paper and I intend to incorporate this but a quick google did not turn up much in the way of user experiences of implementing autosproc and I am looking for a thumbs up (or down) from anyone who has been there and done that already. So, have you used autosproc? Did it work well for you? Are there any gaping flaws in performance or elsewhere that would make it unsuitable in an enterprise application? Advice appreciated.

 First question. Is this the correct way in which we propagate child user control dependancy properties, backup through the parent user control so that it can be set from the page xaml? I've had a look around on the net, there isn't much there considering that this is a fairly primitive thing todo when writing custom controls. Giving details around the bigger picture, I have customer details page, some the controls are bound to the customer object which is contained in an observable collection. If I change the value of the text box (which is contained within the Field control) on the page from "xxxx" to "yyyy" I always get back "xxxx". It seems like something is going wrong somewhere around the getter?

I am trying to build a system which consists of the following: User calls system using regular land line Some processing is done by asterisk Call is forwarded to an external number (another landline/mobile phone) Now I would like atleast 2 simultaneous lines on which the user can call. I would like to know the following: Will the TDM410 work for what I am trying to achieve? Since I want call forwarding, do I need an extra line for that? Or can I do it on the same line? e.g. for one user do I need one incoming line and one outgoing line or can I do both receiving and forwarding on the same line? I have both asterisk books but am still unclear as to which card to purchase. Is the TDM410 with 4 FXO the right one? I am thinking of TDM410 because it has 4 lines so that I can use two for incoming and two for outgoing. Am I right? Can someone please point me to a link/online store? Thank you very much for your time. PS- I do not wish to use SIP. I want to use POTS for all my calls (incoming and outgoing)

@TITLE:Questions about boxing
@CONTENT:I know that boxing is a popular concept with plenty of information available on it, but I have a few questions which I can't really find answers to: 1) If boxing leads to a value type (struct) being converted to an object (Reference type), or reference type, then why use a value type which will be boxed and incur a performance penalty? I am aware of the benefits and suitability in certain cases of either a struct or class. It is said (1) that values (value types) tend to live on the stack in a temporary storage space, but how long for? If I don't need the type, how can I ensure it is taken care of and disposed at that moment? Or is this where the disposable pattern comes into play? I assume the reason to use a struct will be due to its benefits. Interestingly, if I use a struct to store two strings and a DateTime field, the struct will hold two references (strings) and the DateTime together. I obviously assume this is quicker than the values being scattered. Is there anything I need to be aware of in this design? (2). 1) http://en.csharp-online.net/Classes, Structs, and ObjectsXBoxing and Unboxing 2) http://dotnetperls.com/Content/Struct-Examples.aspx I have done a search on here for the answers I am after, but no luck. I usually do searches on this site for topics such as GC, generics, exception handling, etc, as there is a lot of wisdom to learn and share. Thanks for the (potential) education to all posters! Please excuse any potential naivety. Learning the internals takes me nicely to spending some time on understanding IL, etc (something to tackle, soon).

I believe widget can be used to refer to any self-contained dynamic object on a site (your own or a third party). However, my client says that if the object is on your own site, it is a "gadget."

 triggers System.Security.VerificationException: Operation could destabilize the runtime. exception. Reflector parses it OK. What could be wrong with it? Update 1 Code is intended to work as follows: public void set_AccountProfileModifiedAt(DateTime value)
{
    bool propertyHasChanged = this.AccountProfileModifiedAt != value;
    this.accountProfileModifiedAt = value;
    if (propertyHasChanged)

 Update 2 I get specified exception inside the setter itself Update 3 Making non-static calls as callvirt (NotifyPropertyChanged) does not help Update 4 Commenting out (for test purposes) code: L_0018: ldloc.0 
L_0019: ldc.i4.0 
L_001a: ceq 
L_001c: stloc.1

 and replacing L_001e: brtrue.s L_002b with L_001e: br.s L_002b does the trick but it's an unconditional return - not what I want. Update 5 If I use C# compiler to mimic required behavior (I still need to do that with Postsharp) I get following IL: .method public hidebysig specialname newslot virtual final instance void

However neither of the INotifyPropertyChanging INotifyPropertyChanged appear to be raised when the refresh occurs and this leaves my UI displaying incorrect information.

 Now I keep getting the Error that duplicate users exist in this table. But I have checked the database using the following query: SELECT COUNT(UserId) as NumberOfUsers, UserName

GROUP BY UserName, UserId 
ORDER BY UserName
 This results in a list of users all having 1 as a NumberOfUsers. So no duplicates there. But when I'm checking the username he fails I see the following result: beluga
b?luga
 So apperently he fails to compare an "e" and "?" or "?" ... It's like he ignores these, is there any way that sql doesn't ignore these accents when adding the unique key contraint. SOLUTION: THX to you guys I've found the solution. This fixed the problem: ALTER TABLE Users

@TITLE:What would be the light way to render a JSP page without an App/Web Server
@CONTENT:First, some background: I will have to work on code for a JSP that will demand a lot of code fixing and testing. This JSP will receive a structure of given objects, and render it according to a couple of rules. What I would like to do, is to write a "Test Server" that would read some mock data out of a fixtures file, and mock those objects into a factory that would be used by the JSP in question. The target App Server is WebSphere and I would like to code, change, code in order to test appropriate HTML rendering. I have done something similar on the past, but the JSP part was just calling a method on a rendering object, so I created an Ad Hoc HTTP server that would read the fixture files, parse it and render HTML. All I had to do was run it inside RAD, change the HTML code and hit F5. So question pretty much goes down to: Is there any stand alone library or lightweight server (I thought of Jetty) that would take a JSP, and given the correct contexts (Request, Response, Session, etc.) render the proper HTML?

 I was wondering if anyone knew how it was implemented algorithmically (in IL) and what its time order is. That is to say, is it faster than a foreach loop that just casts each item, or is that exactly what it does? EDIT The main class needs to maintain a list of the actual objects. But the reader is only allowed to touch them through the interface.
@CODE:class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            List<A> aList = new List<A>();

            var aObj = new A();

            aObj.Go(aList.Cast<IB>());
        }
    }

    class A : IB
    {
        public void Go(IEnumerable<IB> interfaceList)
        {
            foreach (IB ibby in interfaceList)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Here");
            }
        }
    }

    interface IB
    {
        void Go(IEnumerable<IB> interfaceList);
    } aList.Cast<IB>();

@TITLE:C# doubt, finding the datatype
@CONTENT:I have the following variables: string str1 = "1";
string str2 = "asd";
string str3 = "3.5";
string str4 = "a";
 Now I need to find the data type of each string i.e. the data type to which it can be converted if quotes are removed. Here is what I would like each variable to convert to: str1 - integer str2 - string str3 - double str4 - char Note: if the string has single character it should be char, though a string can have single letter, I'm limiting it. FYI: these values are obtained from DataGrid where i manually entered values. So everything is becoming a string. Is there any way to do this?

@CONTENT:I have the following problem: there is a class with a couple of string properties there is a collection of such class entities That collection is shown in tree on the left of some windows and details shown on the right. I'm binding string properties of selected node to comboboxes in details. First combobox always have the same ItemsSource but the second one ItemsSource depends on SelectedItem of the first combo... <ComboBox 
  Grid.Column="1"

 Now when i create new node in the tree, both string properties have null reference. And when first combo changes its SelectedItem for the NEW node, second ComboBox binds null to the string value of the OLD node, which were selected before creating new node in the tree... I wonder what should i do in this case?

@CONTENT:I have a requirement to be able to track how much a user interacts with the different applications running on their machine. What seemed logical to me was to keep a log of window focus events with timestamps which would tell you what applications were in focus over the course of the day. We have some other things to do in this application that would be straightforward in Java. However I haven't done any GUI programming in Java so I'm not sure if it's possible to get information about OS-level windows through the awt API. Is that even possible? Would there be another way to do this through JNI or would a native application be required to do this? PS: I know that this requirement sounds a little nefarious but I am only here to determine whether or not this is technically possible. Please don't shoot the messenger, this wasn't my idea. :)

@CONTENT:Is it possible to serialize a hierarchy of objects in Flex, send the binary data to a URL for storage/retrieval on/from a server, and deserialize the data to restore the objects' original state? I know it's possible to convert the objects into an XML format (haven't tried it yet), but I'm hoping to avoid parsing XML and rebuilding the objects manually. It would be nice to have functionality which can serialize/deserialize objects to a simple binary format (I did something similar in the past in Java, though not quite as easily as I would have liked).

@CONTENT:how can I prevent file_get_contents from creating an empty file when being used as a test condition in an if clause? An empty file is created regardless, which causes a subsequent call in a different method to getimagesize() to fail. The problem is, that as I have my code setup, the first time it is called will determine to save an image or to display a previously saved imaged. This is in part dependent on the presence of a file. As an empty file is created, this causes problems when calling my code subsequent times. Is the easiest way to add a check if the file exists and is greater than 0? Regardless of if my code works, file_get_contents will still output an error.

@TITLE:Creating Plain .rb Files with Aptana RadRails
@CONTENT:I have just bought a MacBook for some ruby development and like the look of Aptana Studio as a really nice IDE. The question I have, however, is that I want to know (before getting too deep into it, and potentially wasting time) is can I create plain old .rb files without the rails framework attached? Also, can I execute the ruby file straight from the IDE, or will I have to use Terminal? As I said, I am only just learning Ruby and I am working through some books I have bought, and while I do wish to get into rails soon, I feel its important to learn the language properly, before asking rails to do a lot of stuff for me. Any other thoughts on best practices and other potential IDE's would also be appreciated.

@TITLE:Re-opening SqlConnection instance
@CONTENT:1) I noticed that after you close SqlConnection instance, you are still able to re-open the same connection: a) can you tell me what is going on behind the scenes? Meaning, after we close file stream object, we can・t re-open it, but instead must create a new object V so why isn・t the same with SqlConnection objects? b) If pooling is enabled, then I assume the connection object is returned back to the connection pool and can later be reused?! But then how do we know that after re-opening the connection we will get the same Sqlconnection instance as before we initially closed it? I・m asking this because as far as I know, even if connection pool has several connections available, these SqlConnection objects could be in different state than original SqlConnection object ( by ：different state； I mean that some properties could hold different values than those in ：original； connection object)?! c) What if pooling isn・t enabled? Does .Net recreate SqlConnection object ：from scratch；? Again, before we initially closed the SqlConnection object, we might have changed values of some properties? How will compiler know how to recreate the state SqlConnection object was in before we closed it? thank you

I've followed the manual and did this: I svnadmin dump c:\repository | svndumpfilter include > myproject.dump My problem is, svndumpfilter chokes with the error "Invalid copy source path" because we moved that particular project from branches back to another folder awhile ago. Has anyone dealt with this particular problem successfully? I am currently thinking of dumping the main repository in chunks, skipping the revisions that may cause errors. I will then load each chunk into the new repository, each chunk under a folder, and merge them using Eclipse. Does this sound sane to you? Do you see any problems with it?

@LINK:/questions/595504/how-can-i-launch-a-program-from-memory-in-c
@TITLE:How can I launch a program from memory in C#?
@CONTENT:I have some UI application that lives in the user's task bar that is written in C#. The EXE for the tool is checked in to our source control system on a number of projects that use it so we are able to update the version they run with by checking in updated EXE. The problem is that when the users get the latest revision of the exe, the program is often running, and the sync fails on their machine. I want to fix it so the program doesn't lock the exe and any dependent DLL's when it runs so they can sync without having to shut down the program. Currently, I have a program that takes an executable as a parameter and will launch it from memory by reading the assembly contents into memory ahead of time. Unfortunetly, this totally fails when it comes to the DLL's that the program requires. The code I have right now looks something like this: public class ExecuteFromMemory
{
	public static void Main(string[] args)
	{
		//Figure out the name of the EXE to launch and the arguments to forward to it
		string fileName = args[0];
		string[] realArgs = new string[args.Length - 1];
		Array.Copy(args, 1, realArgs, 0, args.Length - 1);

		//Read the assembly from the disk
		byte[] binary = File.ReadAllBytes(fileName);

		//Execute the loaded assembly using reflection
		Assembly memoryAssembly = null;
		try
		{
			memoryAssembly = Assembly.Load(binary);
		}
		catch (Exception ex)
		{
			//Print error message and exit
		}

		MethodInfo method = memoryAssembly.EntryPoint;
		if (method != null && method.IsStatic)
		{
			try
			{
				method.Invoke(null, new object[] { realArgs });
			}
			catch(Exception ex)
			{
				//Print error message and exit
			}
		}
		else
		{
			//Print error message and exit
		}
	}
}
 My question is, am I doing something totally stupid? Is there a better way to handle this? If not, what should I do to support handling external dependencies? For example, the above code fails to load any dependent files if you try to run 'Foo.exe' that uses functions from 'Bar.dll', the 'Foo.exe' will be overwriteable, but 'Bar.dll' is still locked and can't be overwritten. I tried getting the list of referenced assemblies from the 'GetReferencedAssemblies()' method on the loaded assmebly, but that doesn't seem to give any indication where the assemblies should be loaded from... Do I need to search for them myself? If so, what's the best way to do this? It seems like other people might have come across this before, and I don't want to re-invent the wheel. - Update: The EXE is checked in because thats how we distribute our in-house tools to the teams that use them. Its not optimal for this use-case, but I don't have the opportunity to change that policy.

@TITLE:IIS stackoverflow
@CONTENT:We've been chasing an bug on my WCF web application (W2K3 IIS) which was resulting in a stackoverflow. To fix it I needed to increase the stack of my application by creating a thread with the amount of memory I wanted to allocate. But what happens with the child threads? My app creates many threads, will they inherit the value or will I have to set every single thread with the new value? Edit: If I run the (WCF) services as a console host they work just fine. Also, If I modify the stack of the w3wp.exe (with the EDITBIN) they also work fine on IIS. So I need to increase the stack. I know I can create a thread with the stack size (is there another way?) but I need to know what happens with the child threads. Edit2: We need to define some BIG vectors which are resulting in a stack overflow. So it is not a bug in our system. I really need (have) to increase the stack

@TITLE:Am I missing something with my ListView selection event handling
@CONTENT:...or are c# listviews really such a nightmare to manage? Okay the problem I'm working on is very simple. Or at least it appears to be so: I have a text file which contains information about customer orders on separate lines. The data items are separated by semi-colons. My form iterates through these orders, puts the item information into hashtables and puts each hashtable into a master hashtable. Some summary information about each order (product/order#/customer name/customer#) is displayed in my listview separated by sortable columns. Below the listview is a tab control with textboxes for the editable parts of the order details spread across three tabs. Here is what I would like to happen: User clicks on single entry: tab control textboxes fill with Order Details. User edits details in tab control. User clicks on another order: confirmation message checks that the change should be committed, if "Yes" then the details should be saved back to the relevant Hashtable and the display in the listview updates. User selects multiple listview items: the top item should be editable in the tab control. User presses "Remove Item(s)" button on a tool strip at the top of the form: the item(s) are removed from the hashtable and the listview control is updated to reflect the deletion. The textboxes are all set back to blank across the tab control. This seems to me like pretty ordinary and reasonable behaviour. I guessed that using the SelectedIndexChanged event would offer the opportunities to do the data work. But the event fires twice on every selection/deselection and it's not always clear which items should be updated in the listview at which point. The code for testing what kind of "selection/deselection" has just taken place and decide what action should thus be taken is starting to get quite long and I'm just wondering if I'm making things too complicated. So: Is there another event I could use to achieve my functionality goals? Or Is there something about the SelectedIndexChanged event that I don't know that would help the program decide what it should be doing at any given point? Or Am I just going about this the wrong way? Any suggestions, even ones about redesigning my form would be most welcome. EDIT: While trying to attack this problem from a different angle I am changing my master hashtable to a sortedlist. The rest of the problem remains the same.

@TITLE:How can a WCF service return large amounts of data?
@CONTENT:I'm working on a web app that passes data to a custom client app. I'm getting exceptions when the data is over some "small" size. Since the end users will likely be using increasingly larger data sizes, I switched the return from the WCF function to be the ID of the data set. Next, I converted the client to use the ID to retrieve the data from some simple ASPX page. This works fine, but means an inconsistency in the interface. Edit: I'm not sure how I missed returning a Stream, but I did. Does anyone have problems with Streams over WCF? Other than a dropped connection, are there any issues in reading files via HTTP streams from an ASPX page? I would presume that I'm missing a capability of WCF (like oob data). But then, the C#/.NET on-line help is either pretty poor or else seriously broken as installed on my machine. Thanks. [Edit] By the way, in my case the "large amount of data" is user-input driven, but will need to be at least 20MiB.

@TITLE:User-Interface: Best way to toggle MDI frame's on-top status?
@CONTENT:I maintain an MFC (VC6) MDI application that uses Frame Windows as views for a document. There is only one document at a time but there are several MDI-Frames each with a different view of the document data. Recently a request came up to be able to keep one of those frame windows on top of the others while being able to interact with the background windows. One idea was to add a "pin-button" to the frame's title bar. During my research I found out that every implementation uses bitmaps instead of for example CButton objects. This starts to get ugly as soon as one uses window colors other than the default-grey let alone UI-Themes. An option in the menu of the frame window (the thing that appears when left-clicking the window icon in the title bar) would be possible but I'm searching for something that is more obvious to the user. What other possibilities to set this frame window's on-top state are there? Update I have decided to go for the solution suggested by Uli as that one works fine with the XP themes. Unfortunately this directly lead me to my next question: How can I actually make the frame window stay on top?

@CONTENT:We have a very strange error occurring at a developer site which we are unable to replicate ourselves. A developer in Poland has recently upgraded his Windows XP Service Pack 3 machine to 4Gb of Ram When he did so he started experiencing graphical errors in java programs using IBM JDK 1.5 This errors only occur in IBM JDK 1.5 and not in any other version. The problem manifests itself when you create a button or control on a form and move the mouse over it. We have a test program import java.awt.FlowLayout;

import javax.swing.JButton;
import javax.swing.JFrame;

public class GraphicTest {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
    	JFrame frame = new JFrame("GraphicTest");
    	frame.getContentPane().setLayout(new FlowLayout());
    	frame.setSize(200, 200);
    	JButton button = new JButton("Test button");
    	button.setVisible(true);
    	frame.getContentPane().add(button);
    	frame.setVisible(true);
    	frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
    }
}
 which shows the problem straight away. However the problem doesn't arise on my own machine when I upgrade the same windows version to 4Gb of Ram. Has anyone else ever seen an issue like this? Just to clarify this a bit, this issue only happens with IBM JDK 1.5 and only happens when we have 4Gb of Ram. It doesn't happen on any other version of the JDKs and if we reduce the amount of memory to 3 Gb the problem disappears.

Thanks Sparr for posing the followup to this question, I will definitely rewrite the above with your advice in mind. I am not very well versed in the RGB color scale. Knowing the intention of the above method is to retrieve a "complimentary?" color to the existing set of colors, will the solution provided in 1 actually be complimentary in the sense of how we perceive the color? Is there a simpler way to choose a color that will compliment the set, or does the numerical analysis of the RGB components actually yield the appropriate color?
@CODE:public Color nextColor() {
   int max = 0, min = 1000000000, cr = 0, cg = 0, cb = 0;
   for (int r = 0; r < 256; r += 4) {
      for (int g = 0; g < 256; g += 4) {
         for (int b = 0; b < 256; b += 4) {
            if (r + g + b < 256 || r + g + b > 512) {
               continue;
            }
            min = 1000000000;
            for (Color c : colorTable) {
               int dred   = r - c.getRed();
               int dgreen = g - c.getGreen();
               int dblue  = b - c.getBlue();
               int dif = dred * dred + dgreen * dgreen + dblue * dblue;
               if (min > dif) {
                  min = dif;
               }
            }
            if (max < min) {
               max = min;
               cr  = r;
               cg  = g;
               cb  = b;
            }
         }
      }
   }

   return new Color(cr, cg, cb, 0x90);

@TITLE:Count the number of packets sent to a server from a client?
@CONTENT:So I'm almost done an assignment involving Win32 programming and sockets, but I have to generate and analyze some statistics about the transfers. The only part I'm having trouble with is how to figure out the number of packets that were sent to the server from the client. The data sent can be variable-length, so I can't just divide the total bytes received by a #define'd value. We have to use asynchronous calls to do everything, so I've been trying to increment a counter with every FD_READ message I get for the server's socket. However, because I have to be able to accept a potentially large file size, I have to call recv/recvfrom with a buffer size around 64k. If I send a small packet (a-z), there are no problems. But if I send a string of 1024 characters 10x, the server reports 2 or 3 packets received, but 0% data loss in terms of bytes sent/received. Any idea how to get the number of packets? Thanks in advance :)

@TITLE:Can I use multiple source control providers on one project in Visual Studio?
@CONTENT:At work, we use Team Foundation Server for source control. I work from home a lot, though, and external access to our Team Foundation Server isn't possible now or in the foreseeable future. I'm utterly fed up of using email/usb source control - almost as bad as no source control at all - so I was thinking about bringing the project(s) home via email or USB and committing them to a subversion server (probably on one of my own computers, although the free Subversion facilities offered by http://xp-dev.com/ might be an option: I could commit changes to there from work and pick them up from home). Installing a local Team Foundation Server and editing the appropriate files to point to it would be possible as I have an MSDN license, but somehow I don't think that would work (and I don't even know where the address of the Team Foundation Server is stored, and I've looked in the obvious places like the ???scc files.) I used Subversion previously for my own projects, with TortoiseSVN as the interface, but as I've got used to the convenience of being able to move and rename files from within Visual Studio I expect I would use AnkhSVN in Visual Studio, then use TortoiseSVN's Export function to get a clean copy of the project to take back to work to check in. What I'm worried about are conflicts arising from a project being managed by two source control providers. Is this even possible in Visual Studio (2008)? It gets cross enough that the Team Foundation Server isn't available when opening a project at home. Has anyone done anything similar? I know I could just try it and see how it works out, but I'd like to know in advance of any potential pitfalls. Edit: I can't VPN into work for the same reasons I can't access the Team Foundation Server remotely. I surely would like to..

@LINK:/questions/582625/editingcontrolshowing-events-firing-multiple-times
@TITLE:EditingControlShowing events firing multiple times
@CONTENT:I have a DGV in VB.Net 2008 connected to an Access DB table. The DGV is not Read Only, but is full of read-only columns except for one, which contains a combo box. The combo box allows the user to select an outcome for that particular row, and then the program copies in a pre calculated value into the "Profit" column depending upon the item selected in the combobox. Then the user hits the Save button and the DB updates (currently via SQL methods in the XSD). Easy enough so far. Here is the code. Private Sub DGUserBets_EditingControlShowing(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewEditingControlShowingEventArgs) Handles DGUserBets.EditingControlShowing

    Dim combo As ComboBox = CType(e.Control, ComboBox)

    If (combo IsNot Nothing) Then

         // Remove an existing event-handler, if present, to avoid 
         // adding multiple handlers when the editing control is reused.
        RemoveHandler combo.SelectedIndexChanged, _
            New EventHandler(AddressOf DGUBStake_SelectedIndexChanged)

        // Add the event handler. 
        AddHandler combo.SelectedIndexChanged, _
            New EventHandler(AddressOf DGUBStake_SelectedIndexChanged)

    End If

End Sub


Private Sub DGUBStake_SelectedIndexChanged(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)

    Dim myStatus As ComboBox = CType(sender, ComboBox)

    Dim row = DGUserBets.CurrentRow

    Select Case myStatus.SelectedIndex
        Case 0
            row.Cells("DGUBProfit").Value = 0
            // pending. no action
        Case 1
            row.Cells("DGUBProfit").Value = row.Cells("DGUBIfWin").Value
            // win
        Case 2
            // loses
            row.Cells("DGUBProfit").Value = row.Cells("DGUBIfLose").Value
        Case 3
            // void
            row.Cells("DGUBProfit").Value = 0
    End Select


End Sub
 The problem I have is that it would seem that if a user selects the desired outcome from the combobox but does NOT hit Enter, and simply mouses on to a different combobox to again select the outcome for a different row, the first eventhandler is not disconnected and thus the events fire multiple times. This then causes various default MsgBox errors and brings up problems when the user tries to commit all changes to the DB/exit program etc etc. What do I need to do? Do I need to .EndEdit somewhere appropriate to force the row to save the changes? And where should I call this? Thank you.

@TITLE:PostMessage in service applications
@CONTENT:There is a problem I am unable to solve. I created two service applications in Delphi and tried to post messages within them. Of course, there are no windows in such applications and PostMessage needs a window handle parameter to send a message. Therefore, I created a window handle using the AllocateHWnd(MyMethod: TWndMethod) function and passed, as the 'MyMethod' parameter, a procedure I want to be called when a message is received. If it was a windowed application, PostMessage() called using the handle returned by the AllocateHWnd method would certainly send a message that would then be received by the 'MyMethod' procedure. The situation, however, is different in my service applications. I do not understand why, but in one of them posting messages this way works fine, whereas in the second one it does not (the messages are not received at all). Only when the service is being stopped do I notice that two messages are received by 'MyMethod': WM_DESTROY and WM_NCDESTROY. The messages I send using PostMessage are never received by this procedure. On the other hand, the first service always receives all messages I send. Could you please give me a clue that would help me find the reason of the second service not receiving my messages? I do not know in what way they can differ. I checked the settings of the services and they seem to be identical. Why then one of them works fine and the second one does not (as far as sending messages is concerned)? Thanks for any advice.

As part of an Internet?Explorer?7 extension I'm trying to open a window modal with respect to an Internet?Explorer tab. It's not the currently selected tab, but I can get the hwnd of the tab OK. However, when I pass this to ShowDialog my Form is shown, but it's not modal with respect to anything: I can still do things in Internet?Explorer, including in the tab that's supposed to be the owner. My form is shown floating above the Internet?Explorer windows and it stays on top, so it's not like it's just opened as a normal form, but it's not correctly modal. Using Spy++, I can find my form and it's owner handle is correctly set. Does this mean that something has gone wrong, or I'm doing something wrong? How do I make my form correctly modal? FYI, I'm using this wrapper class to create an IWin32Window from a hwnd (thanks Ryan!): /// <summary>
/// Wrapper class so that we can return an IWin32Window given a hwnd
/// </summary>
public class WindowWrapper : System.Windows.Forms.IWin32Window
{
    public WindowWrapper(IntPtr handle)
    {
        _hwnd = handle;
    }

    public IntPtr Handle
    {
        get { return _hwnd; }
    }

    private IntPtr _hwnd;
}
 UPDATE: Using Internet?Explorer?7 & .NET 2.0 UPDATE: Playing around some more with Spy++ and the handles it exposes, I find that if I use a different hwnd then I can make my window modal to the tab: I was using the tab's hwnd as suggested by the IWebBrowser2.HWND doc, which in Spy++ appears as class TabWindowClass. It has a child of class Shell DocObject View, which has a child of Internet_Explorer_Server. If I use the hwnd of the Internet Explorer_Server then it works correctly, for example, when I click with the mouse on other tabs, Internet?Explorer reacts normally. When I click with the mouse on the tab of interest, it plays the windows d'oh sound and doesn't do anything. I don't yet know how to programatically get the Internet_Explorer_Server hwnd, but it should be possible. Also, for what it's worth, while playing with other window handles I was generally able to make my form modal to other applications and dialogs. So I guess the answer to my question is 'many but not all handles'... possibly it depends on the application? UPDATE: Another side-note: The original reason I wanted to make my form modal to the tab instead of the whole window is that when opening a MessageBox from my form, passing the form as owner, the MessageBox would not always open on top of my form. If a new Internet?Explorer tab had just been opened but wasn't active then the MessageBox would be hidden and that tab would start flashing. However, since Internet?Explorer was disabled with my form opened modal it wasn't possible to switch to that tab, so Internet?Explorer would be frozen. I thought that opening my form modal to the tab would solve this, but I've found another solution is to avoid using MessageBox: if I use a second form and ShowDialog(this) from my first form then the second form correctly opens to the front. So it seems that Form.ShowDialog() works better than MessageBox.Show() in some cases. More discussion in Problems with modal dialogs and messageboxes.

@TITLE:Serialize/deserialize to/from multiple XML config files
@CONTENT:I have a set of custom XML configuration management classes in .NET. There are two configuration scopes in my application: User: the setting applies to the user regardless of the account she's logged into. Stored in a XML config file in the user's directory. User/Account: the setting applies to the user when logged into a particular account. Stored in a XML config file in the user's directory under an account specific sub-directory. The two XML documents have the same structure and can be modified by hand. When the application starts up, I read the XML config from the user's profile and the XML config from the User/Account directory. I then merge the two XML documents into a single XDocument and then deserialize the XML into objects modeled after the XDocument's sections. If there is a User/Account-level setting present, it should override the User-level setting. Example: User file: <FileSettings>
  <DownloadPath>C:\downloads</DownloadPath>
  <UploadPath>C:\uploads</UploadPath>
</FileSettings>
 User/Account file for account XYZ: <FileSettings>
  <DownloadPath>C:\newlocation\xyz\mystuff</DownloadPath>
</FileSettings>
 Result after merge: <FileSettings>
  <DownloadPath>C:\newlocation\xyz\mystuff</DownloadPath>
  <UploadPath>C:\uploads</UploadPath>
</FileSettings>
 In the above example, a FileSettings object with 2 properties - DownloadPath and UploadPath will be instantiated from the section. Here's my issue: I have no idea which config file (i.e., scope) the DownloadPath and UploadPath came from. As a result, when the object needs to serialize again, it doesn't know which properties go in which file. Question: What's the best way to store the "source," on a property-by-property basis, so that I can ensure a setting gets written to the same config file that it was read from? Thanks.
@CODE:<FileSettings>
  <DownloadPath>C:\downloads</DownloadPath>
  <UploadPath>C:\uploads</UploadPath>
</FileSettings> <FileSettings>
  <DownloadPath>C:\newlocation\xyz\mystuff</DownloadPath>

Sorry I didn't originally mention it, but the server is a Linux box running Apache and PHP. As I know I should, I plan to do server side validation of the input, but want the client side validation to improve the users' experience and to avoid as much as possible having the server reject invalid inputs. Edit 2: Sorry I didn't reply for months! Other priorities came up and diverted me from this. I ended up doing my own validation routines - in addition to the good points made in some of the answers, some of the items I'm validating are rarely used in other applications and I couldn't find a library with that sort of validation included.

@LINK:/questions/575602/using-pipes-in-c-for-parent-child-ipc-makes-program-block
@TITLE:Using pipes in C for parent-child IPC makes program block
@CONTENT:I am writing a server which fork()'s off a child process when it accepts a socket connection. As the child communicates with a client, it must send some of that information back to the parent. I am using a pipe to accomplish this. The problem is that when I try to do the parent-child IPC, the parent blocks when reading input from the child. Which means that, even though the children are running concurrently, they can only be processed one-at-a-time because they are all waiting for the parent. My code looks something like this (error-checking removed for brevity): /* loop: wait for clients to connect */
for(;;) {

  pipe(write_to_parent); /* create pipe between parent and child */
  pipe(write_to_child);  /* create pipe between parent and child */

  newsockfd = accept(...);

  pid = fork();

  if (pid == 0) { /* child process */
      close(write_to_parent[0]);
      close(write_to_child[1]);

     printf("Connected!\n");

     while ((rc = recv(newsockfd, ...)) > 0) {
         /* process socket request */

         /* write stuff to parent that is related to what we recv'd from client */
         rc = write(write_to_parent[1], &buf, 1024);
     }

     printf("Disconnected!\n");

     exit(0);
  } else { /* parent */

      close(write_to_parent[1]);
      close(write_to_child[0]);

       while (read(write_to_parent[0], &buf, 1024) > 0) {
           /* accept data from child process, and do some processing */
       }
  }
}
 So my question is, how do I remedy this? How can I have the parent communicating with a children using pipes in such a way that it is not blocking? Is this even possible with pipes, or should I used shared memory (with a semaphore, i guess) or message queue instead? (I read this post: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/404604/comparing-unix-linux-ipc but it is really difficult to find examples how these tasks are actually accomplished.) More details: I have a test program that does the following: 1. Connect to the server 2. Sleep(5) 3. Disconnect from the server When I run 2 instances of this program, the server outputs this: connected!
  // pause for 5 seconds
disconnected!
connected!
  // pause for 5 seconds
disconnected!
 Obviously processing each client one at a time. When I remove the IPC - when I get rid of the pipe read() and write()'s from both the parent and child, I get this: connected!
connected!
  // pause for 5ish seconds
disconnected!
disconnected!
 Which is what I want! Any thoughts on how I can accomplish this? (or changes I should make in the way I am going about solving this problem?) (edit: This is part of an assignment for a networking class. We are implementing a P2P protocol that uses a centralized server to manage the peers. We could use any language, and I figured I'd give it a whirl in C .)
@CODE:/* loop: wait for clients to connect */

  if (pid == 0) { /* child process */
      close(write_to_parent[0]);
      close(write_to_child[1]);

     printf("Connected!\n");

     while ((rc = recv(newsockfd, ...)) > 0) {

@TITLE:Alternatives to Iframe
@CONTENT:I have been developing a service that allows users to insert information from my database onto their sites by using iframes. The only problem was that the iframe needs to be resizeable and this is one of the biggest problems with iframes as most people already know, aswell as the fact I can access objects on the parent page from within the iframe and vice versa. I have thought of making an asp.net web servie to server up the HTML and access it by using a get request. However this also has a problem since these request can only be made from the same domain? What I need to know is the best way to retrieve a small piece of HTML containing customer reviews from server and display it on their page using some sort of AJAX. Thanks

@TITLE:dynamic linker dependenciy info embedded in an archive
@CONTENT:Dynamic libraries are nice. The have embedded information in then that help the runtime linker figure what other libraries the final executable needs to load. It also tells the executable what symbols will be loaded Static libraries, however, are a pain in the neck. The linker won't automatically link an archive's dependencies. This get heinous when statically linking a library that is moderately complicated or has a deep dependency graph. So why can't archives just include their dependency information. I tried to do just that. The key to my idea is /usr/lib/libc.so. This file is not a shared object file but a linker script. Linker scripts give you a lot of control over the final linker output, but all I want is to specify dependencies which you can with: INPUT( -ldependency -ldependecy2 )
 Here are my questions. This seems pretty simple, why hasn't this been done before? I can't be the first person who thought of this. This seems easier and more intuitive than pkg-config or libtool (especially libtool ugh). I tried to embed the linker script in the archive, it doesn't work. Why not? Can it be made to work? I suspect some clever use of ranlib might do the trick, but it is beyond me. My current solution is create a linker script called libMyLibrary.a. It contains INPUT( -lMyRealLibrary -ldependency1 -ldependency2 )
 I have to put in the dependencies by hand, it would be nice if ld could for me, but that is problem for another day.

@CONTENT:I was wondering how people usually go about limiting the number of entities returned from a query. I know about SetMaxResults but this seems to break down as soon as joins are involved - 3 entities with each 2 children will produce 6 rows as a result. If I use SetMaxResults(3) to get only 3 entities I will only get 3 resulting rows which will probably give me an incomplete object graph. I am aware this is due to the DistinctRootEntityResultTransformer, but I'm wondering what other people do to avoid getting 1000 rows just to get the 6 rows necessary to build my 3 entities.

@TITLE:Can I use multiple source control providers on one project in Visual Studio?
@CONTENT:At work, we use Team Foundation Server for source control. I work from home a lot, though, and external access to our Team Foundation Server isn't possible now or in the foreseeable future. I'm utterly fed up of using email/usb source control - almost as bad as no source control at all - so I was thinking about bringing the project(s) home via email or USB and committing them to a subversion server (probably on one of my own computers, although the free Subversion facilities offered by http://xp-dev.com/ might be an option: I could commit changes to there from work and pick them up from home). Installing a local Team Foundation Server and editing the appropriate files to point to it would be possible as I have an MSDN license, but somehow I don't think that would work (and I don't even know where the address of the Team Foundation Server is stored, and I've looked in the obvious places like the ???scc files.) I used Subversion previously for my own projects, with TortoiseSVN as the interface, but as I've got used to the convenience of being able to move and rename files from within Visual Studio I expect I would use AnkhSVN in Visual Studio, then use TortoiseSVN's Export function to get a clean copy of the project to take back to work to check in. What I'm worried about are conflicts arising from a project being managed by two source control providers. Is this even possible in Visual Studio (2008)? It gets cross enough that the Team Foundation Server isn't available when opening a project at home. Has anyone done anything similar? I know I could just try it and see how it works out, but I'd like to know in advance of any potential pitfalls. Edit: I can't VPN into work for the same reasons I can't access the Team Foundation Server remotely. I surely would like to..

 The problem I have is that it would seem that if a user selects the desired outcome from the combobox but does NOT hit Enter, and simply mouses on to a different combobox to again select the outcome for a different row, the first eventhandler is not disconnected and thus the events fire multiple times. This then causes various default MsgBox errors and brings up problems when the user tries to commit all changes to the DB/exit program etc etc. What do I need to do? Do I need to .EndEdit somewhere appropriate to force the row to save the changes? And where should I call this? Thank you.

Are there any built-in ways to make the menu drop left from the dropdown button, or do I have to set the menu's position by hand, and manually show/hide? Edit: there are 2 situations, where such behaviour is less than optimal: if it's not full-screen, or close to the right end, it will hang out from the app's window; and In a multi-monitor enviornment, it drops down on the next monitor

@LINK:/questions/582115/postmessage-in-service-applications
@TITLE:PostMessage in service applications
@CONTENT:There is a problem I am unable to solve. I created two service applications in Delphi and tried to post messages within them. Of course, there are no windows in such applications and PostMessage needs a window handle parameter to send a message. Therefore, I created a window handle using the AllocateHWnd(MyMethod: TWndMethod) function and passed, as the 'MyMethod' parameter, a procedure I want to be called when a message is received. If it was a windowed application, PostMessage() called using the handle returned by the AllocateHWnd method would certainly send a message that would then be received by the 'MyMethod' procedure. The situation, however, is different in my service applications. I do not understand why, but in one of them posting messages this way works fine, whereas in the second one it does not (the messages are not received at all). Only when the service is being stopped do I notice that two messages are received by 'MyMethod': WM_DESTROY and WM_NCDESTROY. The messages I send using PostMessage are never received by this procedure. On the other hand, the first service always receives all messages I send. Could you please give me a clue that would help me find the reason of the second service not receiving my messages? I do not know in what way they can differ. I checked the settings of the services and they seem to be identical. Why then one of them works fine and the second one does not (as far as sending messages is concerned)? Thanks for any advice.

@CONTENT:This question is a continuation to another question, also entitled Entity Relationship. Dejene: you should transfer the material here into the original question and then delete this question. Elaboration: Yes, 'Field ' is referring to areas of land. We have several cane growing fields at different location. It [each field?] is named and has budget. User is not referring to individual who are working on the machine. They are departments. I used 'isDone' table to link userDept with machine. A machine can be used by several departments and many machines can work for a userDept. A particular machine can be used for multiple tasks on a given shift. It can work for say 2 hours and can start another task on another field. We have three shifts per day, each of 8 hrs! If I use Auto increment PK, do you think that other key are important? I don't prefer to use it! Usually, I use auto increment key alone in a table. How can we create relationship that involves auto increment keys? Thank you for thoughtful comment!! Dejene

It's a memory pig and it could probably be faster. No, I didn't generate the classes using XSD. I see there are posts on reading and parsing KML using Linq. However, has anyone used Linq to XML to create KML? If not, what do you think is the best approach to create a progammatic. easy to use set of classes to abstract KML?

@TITLE:Should Form.ShowDialog(IWin32Window) work with any window handle?
@CONTENT:When using System.Windows.Forms.ShowDialog(IWin32Window), should I be able to pass in an IWin32Window representing any window handle and have it be modal with respect to that window? As part of an Internet?Explorer?7 extension I'm trying to open a window modal with respect to an Internet?Explorer tab. It's not the currently selected tab, but I can get the hwnd of the tab OK. However, when I pass this to ShowDialog my Form is shown, but it's not modal with respect to anything: I can still do things in Internet?Explorer, including in the tab that's supposed to be the owner. My form is shown floating above the Internet?Explorer windows and it stays on top, so it's not like it's just opened as a normal form, but it's not correctly modal. Using Spy++, I can find my form and it's owner handle is correctly set. Does this mean that something has gone wrong, or I'm doing something wrong? How do I make my form correctly modal? FYI, I'm using this wrapper class to create an IWin32Window from a hwnd (thanks Ryan!): /// <summary>
/// Wrapper class so that we can return an IWin32Window given a hwnd
/// </summary>
public class WindowWrapper : System.Windows.Forms.IWin32Window
{
    public WindowWrapper(IntPtr handle)
    {
        _hwnd = handle;
    }

    public IntPtr Handle
    {
        get { return _hwnd; }
    }

    private IntPtr _hwnd;
}
 UPDATE: Using Internet?Explorer?7 & .NET 2.0 UPDATE: Playing around some more with Spy++ and the handles it exposes, I find that if I use a different hwnd then I can make my window modal to the tab: I was using the tab's hwnd as suggested by the IWebBrowser2.HWND doc, which in Spy++ appears as class TabWindowClass. It has a child of class Shell DocObject View, which has a child of Internet_Explorer_Server. If I use the hwnd of the Internet Explorer_Server then it works correctly, for example, when I click with the mouse on other tabs, Internet?Explorer reacts normally. When I click with the mouse on the tab of interest, it plays the windows d'oh sound and doesn't do anything. I don't yet know how to programatically get the Internet_Explorer_Server hwnd, but it should be possible. Also, for what it's worth, while playing with other window handles I was generally able to make my form modal to other applications and dialogs. So I guess the answer to my question is 'many but not all handles'... possibly it depends on the application? UPDATE: Another side-note: The original reason I wanted to make my form modal to the tab instead of the whole window is that when opening a MessageBox from my form, passing the form as owner, the MessageBox would not always open on top of my form. If a new Internet?Explorer tab had just been opened but wasn't active then the MessageBox would be hidden and that tab would start flashing. However, since Internet?Explorer was disabled with my form opened modal it wasn't possible to switch to that tab, so Internet?Explorer would be frozen. I thought that opening my form modal to the tab would solve this, but I've found another solution is to avoid using MessageBox: if I use a second form and ShowDialog(this) from my first form then the second form correctly opens to the front. So it seems that Form.ShowDialog() works better than MessageBox.Show() in some cases. More discussion in Problems with modal dialogs and messageboxes.

@TITLE:Serialize/deserialize to/from multiple XML config files
@CONTENT:I have a set of custom XML configuration management classes in .NET. There are two configuration scopes in my application: User: the setting applies to the user regardless of the account she's logged into. Stored in a XML config file in the user's directory. User/Account: the setting applies to the user when logged into a particular account. Stored in a XML config file in the user's directory under an account specific sub-directory. The two XML documents have the same structure and can be modified by hand. When the application starts up, I read the XML config from the user's profile and the XML config from the User/Account directory. I then merge the two XML documents into a single XDocument and then deserialize the XML into objects modeled after the XDocument's sections. If there is a User/Account-level setting present, it should override the User-level setting. Example: User file: <FileSettings>
  <DownloadPath>C:\downloads</DownloadPath>
  <UploadPath>C:\uploads</UploadPath>
</FileSettings>
 User/Account file for account XYZ: <FileSettings>
  <DownloadPath>C:\newlocation\xyz\mystuff</DownloadPath>
</FileSettings>
 Result after merge: <FileSettings>
  <DownloadPath>C:\newlocation\xyz\mystuff</DownloadPath>
  <UploadPath>C:\uploads</UploadPath>
</FileSettings>
 In the above example, a FileSettings object with 2 properties - DownloadPath and UploadPath will be instantiated from the section. Here's my issue: I have no idea which config file (i.e., scope) the DownloadPath and UploadPath came from. As a result, when the object needs to serialize again, it doesn't know which properties go in which file. Question: What's the best way to store the "source," on a property-by-property basis, so that I can ensure a setting gets written to the same config file that it was read from? Thanks.
@CODE:<FileSettings>
  <DownloadPath>C:\downloads</DownloadPath>

@TITLE:What JavaScript library to use for client-side form checking?
@CONTENT:Over the years, I've dabbled in plain JavaScript a little, but have not yet used any JavaScript/AJAX libraries. For some new stuff I'm working on, I would like to use a js library to do client-side form validation, and want to know which would be best for that. By best, my criteria would be: quick and easy to learn, small footprint, compatible with all popular browsers. Edit: Thanks for the ASP suggestions, but they're not relevant to me. Sorry I didn't originally mention it, but the server is a Linux box running Apache and PHP. As I know I should, I plan to do server side validation of the input, but want the client side validation to improve the users' experience and to avoid as much as possible having the server reject invalid inputs. Edit 2: Sorry I didn't reply for months! Other priorities came up and diverted me from this. I ended up doing my own validation routines - in addition to the good points made in some of the answers, some of the items I'm validating are rarely used in other applications and I couldn't find a library with that sort of validation included.

@TITLE:How do you insert new entries into an Access db table through an ASP.net website?
@CONTENT:I need to insert new records into an Access database. I'm using Visual Studio 2008 and firstly create a asp.net website. I can connect to the information in Access databse using dataview or gridview and can query a particular entry (ie. Proposal No. -brings up all details linking to that proposal). I can then edit the details of that proposal and this would update the Access Db. What I need to do is to have a form that simply enters new details for a new customer. ie. Enter name [__] Enter Adress[__]. Then for this to update the database. By using the gridview or dataview I am able to view all fields that exist in the table and edit them. Is there a way that I can get a blank gridview/dataview template (which includes all the fields in the table) and fill it out to then update the database? Thanks

@LINK:/questions/575602/using-pipes-in-c-for-parent-child-ipc-makes-program-block
@TITLE:Using pipes in C for parent-child IPC makes program block
@CONTENT:I am writing a server which fork()'s off a child process when it accepts a socket connection. As the child communicates with a client, it must send some of that information back to the parent. I am using a pipe to accomplish this. The problem is that when I try to do the parent-child IPC, the parent blocks when reading input from the child. Which means that, even though the children are running concurrently, they can only be processed one-at-a-time because they are all waiting for the parent. My code looks something like this (error-checking removed for brevity): /* loop: wait for clients to connect */
for(;;) {

  pipe(write_to_parent); /* create pipe between parent and child */
  pipe(write_to_child);  /* create pipe between parent and child */

  newsockfd = accept(...);

  pid = fork();

  if (pid == 0) { /* child process */
      close(write_to_parent[0]);
      close(write_to_child[1]);

     printf("Connected!\n");

     while ((rc = recv(newsockfd, ...)) > 0) {
         /* process socket request */

         /* write stuff to parent that is related to what we recv'd from client */
         rc = write(write_to_parent[1], &buf, 1024);
     }

     printf("Disconnected!\n");

     exit(0);
  } else { /* parent */

      close(write_to_parent[1]);
      close(write_to_child[0]);

       while (read(write_to_parent[0], &buf, 1024) > 0) {
           /* accept data from child process, and do some processing */
       }
  }
}
 So my question is, how do I remedy this? How can I have the parent communicating with a children using pipes in such a way that it is not blocking? Is this even possible with pipes, or should I used shared memory (with a semaphore, i guess) or message queue instead? (I read this post: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/404604/comparing-unix-linux-ipc but it is really difficult to find examples how these tasks are actually accomplished.) More details: I have a test program that does the following: 1. Connect to the server 2. Sleep(5) 3. Disconnect from the server When I run 2 instances of this program, the server outputs this: connected!
  // pause for 5 seconds
disconnected!
connected!
  // pause for 5 seconds
disconnected!
 Obviously processing each client one at a time. When I remove the IPC - when I get rid of the pipe read() and write()'s from both the parent and child, I get this: connected!
connected!
  // pause for 5ish seconds
disconnected!
disconnected!
 Which is what I want! Any thoughts on how I can accomplish this? (or changes I should make in the way I am going about solving this problem?) (edit: This is part of an assignment for a networking class. We are implementing a P2P protocol that uses a centralized server to manage the peers. We could use any language, and I figured I'd give it a whirl in C .)
@CODE:/* loop: wait for clients to connect */
for(;;) {

  pipe(write_to_parent); /* create pipe between parent and child */
  pipe(write_to_child);  /* create pipe between parent and child */

  newsockfd = accept(...);

  pid = fork();

  if (pid == 0) { /* child process */
      close(write_to_parent[0]);
      close(write_to_child[1]);

     printf("Connected!\n");

     while ((rc = recv(newsockfd, ...)) > 0) {
         /* process socket request */

         /* write stuff to parent that is related to what we recv'd from client */
         rc = write(write_to_parent[1], &buf, 1024);
     }

     printf("Disconnected!\n");

     exit(0);
  } else { /* parent */

      close(write_to_parent[1]);
      close(write_to_child[0]);

       while (read(write_to_parent[0], &buf, 1024) > 0) {

@TITLE:dynamic linker dependenciy info embedded in an archive
@CONTENT:Dynamic libraries are nice. The have embedded information in then that help the runtime linker figure what other libraries the final executable needs to load. It also tells the executable what symbols will be loaded Static libraries, however, are a pain in the neck. The linker won't automatically link an archive's dependencies. This get heinous when statically linking a library that is moderately complicated or has a deep dependency graph. So why can't archives just include their dependency information. I tried to do just that. The key to my idea is /usr/lib/libc.so. This file is not a shared object file but a linker script. Linker scripts give you a lot of control over the final linker output, but all I want is to specify dependencies which you can with: INPUT( -ldependency -ldependecy2 )
 Here are my questions. This seems pretty simple, why hasn't this been done before? I can't be the first person who thought of this. This seems easier and more intuitive than pkg-config or libtool (especially libtool ugh). I tried to embed the linker script in the archive, it doesn't work. Why not? Can it be made to work? I suspect some clever use of ranlib might do the trick, but it is beyond me. My current solution is create a linker script called libMyLibrary.a. It contains INPUT( -lMyRealLibrary -ldependency1 -ldependency2 )
 I have to put in the dependencies by hand, it would be nice if ld could for me, but that is problem for another day.

@CONTENT:I am using WCF for the client to access service. I am trying to access the endpoint with TLS (https). I have certificates with both private and public keys. If I have the end point of the service to have the host name same as the certificate name ("Issued To"), then i am able to access the service from the client. If the names of the "issued to" and end point domain name are different i get the error "Could not establish trust relationship for the SSL/TLS secure channel with authority". I have added the certificates to "Trusted Root", "Personal" and "trusted People". In my service i have used "PeerOrChainTrust". Please let me know if anybody has any idea on this. Thanks, Jan

@TITLE:Limiting number of results when using NHibernate
@CONTENT:I was wondering how people usually go about limiting the number of entities returned from a query. I know about SetMaxResults but this seems to break down as soon as joins are involved - 3 entities with each 2 children will produce 6 rows as a result. If I use SetMaxResults(3) to get only 3 entities I will only get 3 resulting rows which will probably give me an incomplete object graph. I am aware this is due to the DistinctRootEntityResultTransformer, but I'm wondering what other people do to avoid getting 1000 rows just to get the 6 rows necessary to build my 3 entities.

@TITLE:What is the complexity of finding median and doing counts in MySQL?
@CONTENT:I would like to know what the complexity of the following two operations are. The first case is a count where I order by a column that I have an index on and ask for the count of all values below or above a certain number like this: SELECT count(*) FROM tbl WHERE col1 > 10 ORDER BY col1;
 The other case is concerning a median operation. By median I mean finding the (int)n/2's row value, where n is the number of rows in the table. An example of this could be the following (again there's an index on col1): SELECT median(col1) FROM tbl ORDER BY col1;
 What is the worst case complexities of these cases?

 Those are made up properties, btw, which would be nice to have. I know I could probably setup a timer to fire ever 10th of a second and check the left and top and then move it back if it's over. But it would be more elegant to have the window act like it hit a wall and can't go any farther, like moving to the edge of the screen or something similar. Edit: There seems to be some confusion somewhere, the point I'm trying to make is in the paragraph above, dragging, not re-sizing.

@CONTENT:I am trying to build a windows service that includes a Lua component, and links with Lua's shared libraries. I am building the code in Eclipse/CDT with MinGW. It builds fine, but when I run it, I get "Application failed to Initialize Properly (0x80000003). Click OK to terminate". I am looking for clues as to what might be going on. A Hello World program compiles and runs fine, so there are no basic environment issues (I hope!). BTW, I am running on XP Home. Update: OK, I have figured out, by some guesswork, what was going on, and thought I'd post this for the benefit of others who might run into a similar problem - I think the lua DLL I was linking to, at runtime, was a different version than the one I built with. This caused the app initialization to fail I guess. When I made them to be the same file, things started working. I have not looked into why this would cause app init to fail, but I guess some symbol being at a different address or something? Or could it be that the DLLs were built with different tool chains?

@CONTENT:While making a state system that follows the state design pattern (which is working quite well so far) and I am now wondering if there is a way to send arbitrary data to this system. I was thinking that this might be possible using a Stimulus class. The system itself is composited into another object that can respond to the stimuli, and both the state machine and the states themselves can have stimuli as well, and they will be passed from the outer to the inner levels via function calls. The problem being that the stimuli need to carry arbitrary data to these different levels, and I can't think of a simple way to get it out. I was thinking that it might be possible using a dynamic_cast, but I was wondering if there might be a better way.

@CONTENT:We have a VB project that loads a reference to a .Net dll (which we also make). Both projects are being simultaneously developed. When we add new classes to the referenced dll, the main project normally fails to notice the changes. That is, if we added a new class Bar to the Foo dll, we should be able to type "Foo." and have Bar listed in the intellisense dropdown. It's never there. Removing the reference and then adding it back in again sometimes fixes the problem. Sometimes we have been able to just manually type Bar in and then rebuild without errors. It seems to me that there should be some way to tell Visual Studio to reload the referenced project because it has changed. Actually, I think VS should notice the change itself, but failing that, we need a simple way to force a reload. Any suggestions? Edit: It is VS2005 and we are referencing output assemblies (the dll)

@CONTENT:I'm using ODP.Net version 11.1.0 to insert data into a database, and I'm seeing a memory leak. If I comment out the code below, it goes away. This code is called thousands of times in my application, and I can watch # of bytes in all heaps grow steadily as it runs. cmdStr contains an insert statement that inserts into a table with 375 columns. The fields are all NUMBER except for two - one is a DATE, and the other is a VARCHAR2(20). Is there something else I need to do to clean up the OracleCommand? No exceptions are thrown here - the insert command is successful every time. Edit: I tried moving the return statement, and that had no effect as expected - using is really a try-finally block. Update: I used CLRProfiler to see what is using up the memory, and it's a bunch of string objects, ~2800 of them. Their references are held by HashTable objects that are owned by Oracle.DataAccess.Client.ConnDataPool objects. Why is ODP.NET keeping these around? try

@TITLE:Inserting item in LINQ to SQL datacontext - doesn't appear until application restart
@CONTENT:I have an ASP.NET MVC (using the release candidate) application that works with a class library that among other things uses LINQ to SQL for data persistance. One of the thing the app/db maintains, is the concept of a "Folder" - like a disk folder, but with a hierarchy that only exists in the database. Other database objects live in these folders, seen from the perspective of the user. Each class in the class library has its own static reference to my DataContext object. In addition, the MVC controller each has it's own DataContext object. I have two Actions returning JSON data. One is a "GetFoldersJSON" which returns the folder structure in a format suitable for a select (dropdown) list. The other one is "AddFolderJSON" which accepts some form data, inserts a new Folder into the database, and then returns GetFoldersJSON() for sending the new folder list to the client. The client uses AJAX with these actions to refresh the dropdownlists once a new folder is created. The flow of this operation is as such: AddFolderJSON() action - Get the form information with new folder name, parent folder etc. Create new Folder object. Perform a dataContext.Folders.InsertOnSubmit(newFolder); Perform a dataContext.SubmitChanges(); Perform a dataContext.Refresh(OverwriteThingy, dataContext.Folders); return result of GetFoldersJSON() GetFoldersJSON() uses a function which resides in the Folder definition - a partial class extending the OR-mapped folder object. This function recursively adds folders and subfolders to a flat list using code like this: var rootFolders = from f in db.Folders
                  where f.ParentFolder == null
                  orderby f.name
                  select f;
 db is of course the local, static DataContext reference. Then a simple loop:     foreach (var fldr in rootFolders)
    {
        AddFolderContents(list, fldr);
    }
 The AddFolderContents() function then adds the current folder to the list, and proceeds to call itself for each subfolder of the current folder, thus creating a hierarchy. This works fine for data already in the database, but when we run this procedure after creating a new Folder, the new folder does not show up. If we refresh the page, it still doesn't show up. It doesn't actually show up until the application is restarted. I have tried to do Refresh() calls just about everywhere, and it seems to have no effect in this case. Is there a way to tell LINQ to SQL "Hey, I know what you're thinking, but DROP IT ALL, and just get ALL the data from the database, NOW!"? I have a nagging feeling I've heard about this before, but couldn't find it described here.
@CODE:var rootFolders = from f in db.Folders
                  where f.ParentFolder == null
                  orderby f.name
                  select f; foreach (var fldr in rootFolders)
    {
        AddFolderContents(list, fldr);

We figured we would need to have a socket server running on the machine in order to do this. We want to send objects with byte arrays etc, not just strings. Is there anything out there that could help us? Do we need to write our own socket server, which I am afraid might take some time, or can we use any of the existing remote gateways like WebORB or FluorineFX and somehow use that to do the communication and the serialization perhaps by hosting them as a Windows service?

 I don't need to do anything in the competed event of each operation. I need to just display a message at the end of the last one. Any ideas? EDIT: I may be porting this to Silverlight, so that's why I need to call the service asyncronously. I don't think I can use the background worker.

@TITLE:How can I have a VBA macro perform a Search/Replace in formulas across an entire workbook?
@CONTENT:I distribute an Excel workbook to a number of users, and they are supposed to have a particular macro file pre-installed in their XLSTART folder. If they don't have the macro installed correctly, and they send the workbook back to me, any formulas depending on it include the full path of the macro, e.g.: 'C:\Documents and Settings\richard.tallent\Application Data\
Microsoft\Excel\XLSTART\pcs.xls'!MyMacroFunction()
 I want to create a quick macro I can use to remove the improper path from every formula in the workbook. I've successfully retrieved the special folder using GetSpecialFolder (an external function that is working just fine), but the Replace call itself shown below throws an "Application-defined or object-defined error". Public Sub FixBrokenMacroFormulas()
  Dim badpath As String
  badpath = "'" & GetSpecialFolder(AppDataFolder) & "\Microsoft\Excel\XLSTART\mymacro.xls'!"

End Sub
 Automating search and replace isn't exactly my forte, what am I doing wrong? I've already commented out some of the parameters that don't seem essential.

@TITLE:Setting up Django on an internal server (os.environ() not working as expected?)
@CONTENT:I'm trying to setup Django on an internal company server. (No external connection to the Internet.) Looking over the server setup documentation it appears that the "Running Django on a shared-hosting provider with Apache" method seems to be the most-likely to work in this situation. Here's the server information: Can't install mod_python no root access Server is SunOs 5.6 Python 2.5 Apache/2.0.46 I've installed Django (and flup) using the --prefix option (reading again I probably should've used --home, but at the moment it doesn't seem to matter) I've added the .htaccess file and mysite.fcgi file to my root web directory as mentioned here. When I run the mysite.fcgi script from the server I get my expected output (the correct site HTML output). But, it won't when trying to access it from a browser. It seems that it may be a problem with the PYTHONPATH setting since I'm using the prefix option. I've noticed that if I run mysite.fcgi from the command-line without setting the PYTHONPATH enviornment variable it throws the following error: prompt$ python2.5 mysite.fcgi 
 ERROR:
 No module named flup   Unable to load
 the flup package.  In order to run
 django   as a FastCGI application, you
 will need to get flup from  
 http://www.saddi.com/software/flup/  
 If you've already   installed flup,
 then make sure you have it in your
 PYTHONPATH.
 I've added sys.path.append(prefixpath) and os.environ['PYTHONPATH'] = prefixpath to mysite.fcgi, but if I set the enviornment variable to be empty on the command-line then run mysite.fcgi, I still get the above error. Here are some command-line results: >>> os.environ['PYTHONPATH'] = 'Null'
>>>
>>> os.system('echo $PYTHONPATH')
Null
>>> os.environ['PYTHONPATH'] = '/prefix/path'
>>>
>>> os.system('echo $PYTHONPATH')
/prefix/path
>>> exit()
prompt$ echo $PYTHONPATH
Null
 It looks like Python is setting the variable OK, but the variable is only applicable inside of the script. Flup appears to be distributed as an .egg file, and my guess is that the egg implementation doesn't take into account variables added by os.environ['key'] = value (?) at least when installing via the --prefix option. I'm not that familiar with .pth files, but it seems that the easy-install.pth file is the one that points to flup: import sys; sys.__plen = len(sys.path)
./setuptools-0.6c6-py2.5.egg
./flup-1.0.1-py2.5.egg
import sys; new=sys.path[sys.__plen:]; del sys.path[sys.__plen:]; p=getattr(sys,'__egginsert',0); sy
s.path[p:p]=new; sys.__egginsert = p+len(new)
 It looks like it's doing something funky, anyway to edit this or add something to my code so it will find flup?

@TITLE:WIA.DeviceManager.DeviceInfos.Count = 0. Why?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to identify the scanners attached to the computer. One of the possible solutions is to use WIA (Windows Image Acquisition Automation Library). These were my actions so far: Download wiaaut.dll Copy it to system32 Register it with "regsvr32 wiaaut.dll" (successfully) Add reference to my project in Visual Studio.NET Check that the Windows Image Acquisition (WIA) service is running Next, I add and debug the following code: WIA.DeviceManager manager = new WIA.DeviceManagerClass();
string deviceName = "";
foreach (WIA.DeviceInfo info in manager.DeviceInfos)
{
    if (info.Type == WIA.WiaDeviceType.ScannerDeviceType)
    {
        foreach (WIA.Property p in info.Properties)
        {
            if (p.Name == "Name")
                {
                    deviceName = ((WIA.IProperty)p).get_Value().ToString();
                    Console.WriteLine(deviceName);
                }
        }
    }
}
 However, the manager.DeviceInfos is always empty. I have 2 scanners attached, one of them shows in Control Panel->Scanners and Cameras, one doesn't, and both show under "Imaging Devices" in Device manager. Any suggestion on why none are appearing in WIA.DeviceManager.DeviceInfos? Running on Windows XP Service Pack 2
@CODE:WIA.DeviceManager manager = new WIA.DeviceManagerClass();
string deviceName = "";
foreach (WIA.DeviceInfo info in manager.DeviceInfos)
{
    if (info.Type == WIA.WiaDeviceType.ScannerDeviceType)
    {
        foreach (WIA.Property p in info.Properties)
        {
            if (p.Name == "Name")
                {
                    deviceName = ((WIA.IProperty)p).get_Value().ToString();
                    Console.WriteLine(deviceName);

    myProcess.WaitForExit();

    myProcess.Close();
 .. and all works fine except ... I am not able to get back non-asci characters. For example providing some Korean characters in the input returns questionmarks as output.

@TITLE:Debugging a DLL which is in another solution on VS2003
@CONTENT:I'm am trying to debug a DLL which is called from a VC++ application, but cannot step-inside the DLL function because the DLL source is located in another solution project. I have tried to set a break point right before the DLL function call but when I try to step-in it just passes right down. I am aware that it is possible to just debug the DLL on its own and feed it arguments, but since there are many variables, I do not find it practical for debugging purposes. Is there a way to debug a DLL that is separate from the Invoking Application as if it where a single solution file?

@TITLE:Linux & C-Programming: How can I write utf-8 encoded text to a file?
@CONTENT:I am interested in writing utf-8 encoded strings to a file. I did this with low level functions open() and write(). In the first place I set the locale to a utf-8 aware character set with setlocale("LC_ALL", "de_DE.utf8"). But the resulting file does not contain utf-8 characters, only iso8859 encoded umlauts. What am I doing wrong? Addendum: I don't know if my strings are really utf-8 encoded in the first place. I just keep them in the source file in this form: char *msg = "Rote Gr?tze"; See screenshot for content of the textfile:
@CODE:setlocale("LC_ALL", "de_DE.utf8") char *msg = "Rote Gr?tze"; char *msg = "Rote Gr?tze"

@TITLE:Eclipse - Compiling & executing program
@CONTENT:In the past, I have used JCreator to develop my java applications. I wanted to try Eclipse and see its IDE. On JCreator, I could just open a java file and run it in the command prompt. On Eclipse, I cannot find out how I can compile and run a java file written by someone else without first creating a project, creating a new java class and then copy and pasting the code from the file. I cannot even figure out how to import a java file into the project. So my questions: 1. How can I open, compile and run a java file without first creating a java project. 2. How can I import a java file into a project I already have. 3. How can I run the program in command prompt, instead of on the console that is in Eclipse, (update: to be more clear) directly from the Eclipse. Thank you.

@TITLE:Use domain-specific-language files inside C++ project
@CONTENT:I am developping a DSL with its own graphical editor. Such files have a .own extension. I also have a small tool that compiles .own files into .h files. X.own --> X.h and X/*.h I have written a simple .rules file to launch the generation. My problem is the following : Most of my source files include X.h, but a change in X.own does not mean the generated X.h (or any other generated file) will be different. This is dealt with by the generator through the use of temporary files and file comparison. But Visual Studio does not seem to know how to deal with all this. If i set the "output file(s)" property to the right file(s), it always assumes they will be changed. If i don't, it generates its build process assuming they won't be ! How can i make things right ? 1) Launch custom build tool 2) Compute build process based on dependencies

@TITLE:Just started C++: Undefined Symbol error on Compile
@CONTENT:Here's the situation: I just started my first C++ class. I know nothing about C++ and despite this being the an intro to C++ class, the teacher has taught pretty much NO syntax for the language, just logic that we already know. Now he gave us a program description and said, "write it, lol." I understand the logic fine, but as I said before, I know nothing about C++. Thus I wrote it first in java (which I do know), and then once I got it working in java, I tried to code it over to C++.

 EDIT: Added questionmark to url to show the problem This works fine in all browsers tested - however, in Firefox 3.0.6, both on windows, mac and debian, it fails to set the hyperlinks properly. Every single hyperlink points to the same URL the redirect points to, completely ignoring the "href" attribute. Refreshing the page does not help - I have to re-enter the URL manually and hit enter for the hyperlinks to start working again. I've tried this in IE6, IE7, Opera and Safari, and it works fine. I'm assuming something is wrong with the way I implement the redirect, could anyone point me in the right direction?

@TITLE:code critique - am I creating a Rube Goldberg machine?
@CONTENT:I'm making a fair amount of calls to database tables via ADO. In the spirit of keeping things DRY, I wrote the following functions to return an array of values from a recordset. Is this hare brained? I use it mainly for grabbing a set of combo-box values and the like, never for enormous values. Example Usage (error handling removed for brevity): Function getEmployeeList()
    getEmployeeList= Array()
    strSQL =  "SELECT emp_id, emp_name from employees"
    getEmployeeList = getSQLArray( strSQL, "|" )
End Function
 Then I just do whatever I want with the returned array. Function getSQLArray( SQL, delimiter )
'*************************************************************************************
' Input a SQL statement and an optional delimiter, and this function
' will return an array of strings delimited by whatever (pipe defaults)
' You can perform a Split to extract the appropriate values. 
' Additionally, this function will return error messages as well; check for 
' a return of error & delimiter & errNum & delimiter & errDescription
'*************************************************************************************
    getSQLArray = Array()
    Err.Number = 0
    Set objCon = Server.CreateObject("ADODB.Connection") 


    objCon.Open oracleDSN


    Set objRS = objCon.Execute(SQL)

    if objRS.BOF = false and objRS.EOF = false then
    	Do While Not objRS.EOF
    		for fieldIndex=0 to (objRS.Fields.Count - 1)
    				If ( fieldIndex <> 0 ) Then
    					fieldValue = testEmpty(objRS.Fields.Item(fieldIndex))
    					recordString = recordString & delimiter & fieldValue
    				Else 
    					recordString = CStr(objRS.Fields.Item(fieldIndex))
    				End If
    		Next 
    		Call myPush( recordString, getSQLArray )
    		objRS.MoveNext
    	Loop
    End If
    Set objRS = Nothing
  objCon.Close
  Set objCon = Nothing
End Function

Sub myPush(newElement, inputArray)
    Dim i
    i = UBound(inputArray) + 1
    ReDim Preserve inputArray(i)
    inputArray(i) = newElement                                          
End Sub


Function testEmpty( inputValue )
    If (trim( inputValue ) = "") OR (IsNull( inputValue )) Then 
      testEmpty = ""
    Else
    	testEmpty = inputValue 
    End If
End Function
 The questions I'd have are: Does it make sense to abstract all the recordset object creation/opening/error handling into its own function call like this? Am I building a Rube Goldberg machine, where anyone maintaining this code will curse my name? Should I just suck it up and write some macros to spit out the ADO connection code, rather than try doing it in a function? I'm very new to asp so I have holes in its capabilities/best practices, so any input would be appreciated.

@CONTENT:I'm using the excellent Jalbum to create a photo album for a website. Each page of the generated photo album is a complete webpage, so the recommended way to embed the album within a website is to use an iframe. A problem arises when I want to style the images contained within the embedded iframe. If I add a rule such as: img {

 to my stylesheet, it does not select the images within the iframe. Is there a way to select elements contained within an embedded iframe?

@TITLE:How to set or export display variable through java code?
@CONTENT:We are required to add export DISPLAY=:0.0 in tomcat's startup file and batch server's startup file. This is to make java see the X11 Display libraries on Unix and run our applet. Without this export in the startup files, the applet throws a Headless Exception. Though this explicit export makes the java applet run, it disrupts the other applications running on the server. Is there a way where I can make this export DISPLAY=:0.0 run from within java code instead of adding it to startup files? And if it is possible, would that be a good approach? I have already tried setting the system property to -Djava.awt.headless=true , but it didn't work. As the link given above http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/J2SE/Desktop/headless/ also says that setting headless=true would work only for few components like Canvas, Panel but it will not work for the top level components. So I feel the only option left for me is using export DISPLAY=:0.0. This is making my applet work when set in the startup files but causes problem for other applications running in the server. So if anybody could help me to make export DISPLAY=:0.0 work such that it doesn't interfere with other applications in the server. One way I thought was to export the display through code. Any help would be highly appreciated.

@TITLE:How do I build a OneTwoThree linked list with a minimum number of assignment operators? [closed]
@CONTENT:I came across this problem while preparing for an interview and curious to know the diffrent ways it can be written. I found this at http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/103/ and have given the problem as it is. here is a code to build the list {1,2,3} struct node* BuildOneTwoThree() {
    struct node* head = NULL;
    struct node* second = NULL;
    struct node* third = NULL;
    head = malloc(sizeof(struct node)); // allocate 3 nodes in the heap
    second = malloc(sizeof(struct node));
    third = malloc(sizeof(struct node));
    head->data = 1; // setup first node
    head->next = second; // note: pointer assignment rule
    second->data = 2; // setup second node
    second->next = third;
    third->data = 3; // setup third link
    third->next = NULL;
    // At this point, the linked list referenced by "head"
    // matches the list in the drawing.
    return head;
}
 Q: Write the code with the smallest number of assignments (=) which will build the above memory structure. A: It requires 3 calls to malloc(). 3 int assignments (=) to setup the ints. 4 pointer assignments to setup head and the 3 next fields. With a little cleverness and knowledge of the C language, this can all be done with 7 assignment operations (=).
@CODE:struct node* BuildOneTwoThree() {
    struct node* head = NULL;
    struct node* second = NULL;
    struct node* third = NULL;
    head = malloc(sizeof(struct node)); // allocate 3 nodes in the heap
    second = malloc(sizeof(struct node));
    third = malloc(sizeof(struct node));
    head->data = 1; // setup first node
    head->next = second; // note: pointer assignment rule

@TITLE:Parse String to Integer (come hell or high water)
@CONTENT:I need to maintain a legacy VB.NET web application. Data typing is, I would say, inconsistent. Especially, there are data that is stored sometimes as integers and sometimes as strings, and I have to parse strings to integers reliably. If parsing goes wrong it should always return 0. The problem is, I can't use any of the .NET/VB.NET parsing functions for this, but I have to rely on a self-made function. Could I use a one-liner standard framework call to do every String-to-Integer parsing task? Let's say there is a string that can be null, empty, contain an integer representation like "10" or contain something else. I have tried these with an empty input string "": CType(string, Integer) -> Conversion from string "" to type 'Integer' is not valid.
Convert.ToInt32(string) -> Input string was not in a correct format.
Integer.Parse(string) -> Input string was not in a correct format.
CInt(string) -> Conversion from string "" to type 'Integer' is not valid.
Val(string) -> Success!
 But even Val can fail. The surefire way is to call a self-made function:    Public Function ToInteger(ByVal s As String) As Integer

        s = Trim(s)
        Dim i As Integer

        Try
            i = Val(s)
        Catch ex As Exception
            i = 0
        End Try

        Return i

    End Function
 I think this sucks. This is bad because: I'm trying to parse strings to integers! This is not rocket science, even if semantics are involved Self-made standards do not stick very well. Somewhere in the code you will always find broken standard framework solutions As a result there are unnecessary bugs in the software. And I accuse the standard framework for this. Unless, of course a better solution is found :) Thanks for all the answers. Int32.TryParse is perfect here. But if you have to cast the input to a string first, the cast can fail. Like when reading from a database object with a possible DBNull value.
@CODE:CType(string, Integer) -> Conversion from string "" to type 'Integer' is not valid.
Convert.ToInt32(string) -> Input string was not in a correct format.
Integer.Parse(string) -> Input string was not in a correct format.
CInt(string) -> Conversion from string "" to type 'Integer' is not valid.
Val(string) -> Success! Public Function ToInteger(ByVal s As String) As Integer

        s = Trim(s)
        Dim i As Integer

        Try
            i = Val(s)
        Catch ex As Exception
            i = 0

I understand some browsers support this through the thead,tbody,tfooter tags, but the users are using IE6 only. A row is normally only one line but on occasion can be two or three (maybe more).

    [action] => up
    [id] => 89

 Now, i have tried everything, changed computer, tried on a server with a full url(thinking maybe localhost was the trouble), read somewhere that using http://localhost/reporeade/Vote/Ajax/?rand= instade of http://localhost/reporeade/Vote/Ajax?rand= solved the trouble but tried both and really cant undertand what would make the post get lost.... any ideas? Edit: Well after playing with all this, i got it working(like it is) in our production server, but in all of our wamp instalations it will not work(well fail like 50% of the time). Its really important for me to solve this so we can keep on developing all the ajax functionality of the product, so... I tried xampp but its not compatible with our framework I tried going to apache 2.0 instead of 2.2 in wamp I tried with diferent configurations of the httpd.conf and php.ini Any ideas of why wamp would fail like this? Update: I'm sure the problem is the wamp instalation that is not sending the POST correctly some times, any help that would lead to solving this will get the correct answer and the bounty!

 stAguments structure filled before this call, obviously. Imagine you've forgot to add one of arguments into this container or used wrong argument type, say created invalid request. ColdFusion throws exception that can be catched, but can not (not literally) be read: *Web service operation AddCustomer with parameters {postcode={12345},org_name={Terms test 7.79661762856},fax={},html={1},addr1={address1},firstname={sergey},city={Austin},country={},taxable={},notify={1},lastname={galashyn},addr2={},ssn={},api_key={8FE9AD0BCF2382D92A1080DB3AA62DB9},taxrate={0},terms={Net 15},active={},state={},salutation={Mr.},password={123},account_manager={1}} cannot be found.*
 It breaks my head checking all these arguments manually one by one. This is the problem. Maybe anyone uses some technique to make this easier. I've even thought about some kind of parser to automate this comparison. Will appreciate any thought and ideas. Thank you. P.S. Sorry for my English -- not my native language. Please ask if I've wrote anything not clear enough. EDIT: To clarify. Problem is not in accessing service. I am owner of it and I am definitely know all arguments and their types of each method. Problem is only in reading error message when creating request -- filling method arguments container. For example, method got 10 arguments and accidentally I've added 9 -- local instance of CF throws error that method can't be found and shows raw list (em'ed above) of fields I've passed. And I need to compare them one by one with method arguments to find what I've missed. Really, it's an usability and time saving problem.

@CONTENT:Let's say I'm getting a large (2 million rows?) amount of data that's supposed to be static and unchanging. Supposed to be. And this data gets republished monthly. What methods are available to 1) be aware of what data points have changed from month to month and 2) consume the data given a point in time? Solution 1) Naively save every snapshot of data, annotated by date. Diff awareness is handled by some in-house program, but consumption of the data by date is trivial. Cons, space requirements balloon by an order of magnitude. Solution 2A) Using an in-house program, track when the diffs happen and store them in an EAV table, annotated by date. Space requirements are low, but consumption integrated with the original data becomes unwieldly. Solution 2B) Using an in-house program, track when the diffs happen and store them in a sparsely filled table that looks much like the original table, filled only with the data that's changed and the date when changed. Cons, model is sparse and consumption integrated with the original data is non-trivial. I guess, basically, how do I integrate the dimension of time into a relational database, keeping in mind both the viewing of the data and awareness of differences between time periods? Does this relate to data warehousing at all? Smells like... Slowly changing dimension?

}
 However, serializer.WriteObject(ms, objectToSerialize); throws System.Runtime.Serialization.InvalidDataContractException: Consider marking it with the DataContractAttribute attribute, and marking all of its members you want serialized with the DataMemberAttribute attribute. Alternatively, you can ensure that the type is public and has a parameterless constructor - all public members of the type will then be serialized, and no attributes will be required." Now, when I do add those attributes to the MyCustomClass, I of course get the same exception, only this time for System.Windows.UIElement instead of MyCustomClass. So, is there a way to serialize my custom derived class with the existing serialization method, or should I just write a custom serialization methods for MyCustomClass?

@TITLE:C# (or VB6) Convert Word doc to Tiff
@CONTENT:I'm working on a VB6 application that is used by over a hundred users. It generates a Word document, then saves a TIFF image of the document in a database. Currently, it simply sets the printer to Microsoft Office Document Image Writer, "prints" the document to a set location, then imports the resulting TIFF file into the database. However, the organization is in the process of upgrading everyone to Office 07, and this means that Microsoft Office Document Image Writer is going away. So, I'd like to know how hard it would be to programmatically convert from Word to TIFF. We're already bringing in a C# (.NET 3.5) control library as COM, so that seems like a good place to put the functionality. At some point I'll be converting the whole app to 3.5, so I'd prefer that any new code be already there so there's less to convert. EDIT: I appreciate the suggestions, but I'd really like to try and do this without using expensive third-party components. It's just hard to get the money guys to see the merit of spending thousands of dollars to fix something that used to work for free. Plus, I'm genuinely interested in what it would take to roll it myself. A bit masochistic, I know, but I got into programming because I'm cursed with a desire to know how things work... :) Thanks for all your help!

An example would be "123 Forest Hill Road".

@TITLE:How to parse NULL value returned using YUI datasource
@CONTENT:I am using YUI datatable and datasource to render data in one of my projects. The data returned happens to be NULL and YUI datasource is unable to parse it. Below is the declaration code of datasource and datatable. For readability sake, I am seperating each of the declarations. Column Descriptions declaration             var columnDescription = 
		    [
				{key:'Requirements'},
				{key:'abc'},
				{key:'xyz'}
		     ];
 This columnDescription is set in the function below. DataSource Declaration var dataSrcSample = new YAHOO.util.FunctionDataSource(getDataGrid);
    			myDataSource.connMethodPost = true;
    			myDataSource.responseType = YAHOO.util.DataSource.TYPE_JSON;

{key:'abc',parser:YAHOO.util.DataSource.parseString},
 {key:'xyz',parser:YAHOO.util.DataSource.parseString}]
                	};
 getDataGrid function makes the call to server side to get the data from the server. Below is the table definition itself. 		YAHOO.example.sampleTable = function()
		{
                           var columnDesc=columnDescription;
			var myDataSource = dataSrcSample;
			var oConfigs = 
			{
				width:'100%'
			};

			var myDataTable = new YAHOO.widget.DataTable("tableContainerDiv", 
columnDesc,
 myDataSource,
 oConfigs);
    		}();
 tableContainerDiv is declared in the html page. This is the container div. The function that gets the JSON data from server. function getDataGrid()
{
      //calls backend and gets the data
}
 The function is returning json string that has some null values. Datasource constructor is complaining following problems. ERROR_DATAINVALID ERROR_DATANULL I checked the yui documentation and found that the string parser does not parse null values. I am wondering if there is any way to parse this data. Do I have to handleResponse parse the raw data? Any suggestions appreciated.

 So what I am looking at is how to add Financial as an child to Company. I tried mptt.register(Financials, parent = Company) which of course give me error. so mytree structure will be: company1

company2

 Thanks
@CODE:class Company(models.Model):

       parent = models.ForeignKey('self', null=True, blank=True, related_name='children')

   mptt.register(Company, order_insertion_by=['name']) class Financials(models.Model):
    company = models.ForeignKey(Company, related_name="financials")
    year = models.IntegerField()
    revenue = models.DecimalField(max_digits = 10, decimal_places = 2) mptt.register(Financials, parent = Company) company1

@CONTENT:If I've got Foo with a property of type Bar. Both are persisted in a database which can be retrieved by an ID. (The IDs are actually used in the line of business by customer service claims. So they're not just index placeholders.) I could take the approach shown with b1 or b2. Chaining entities together scares me since if you push that too far, it's easy to get Null's popping up. On the other hand, having the ID show up everywhere seems like it's adding unnecessary wordiness. int fooKey = 123;
Foo f = new Foo(fooKey);
Bar b1 = new Bar(Foo.BarID);  //This?
Bar b2 = Foo.Bar;  // Or This?
 Note: This is NOT about the .NET Entity framework. The word entity is used here in the general sense.

Suppose that we have this schematic object model: So, each object could have lots of properties due to the set of implemented Interfaces, and then become relatively heavy object. Creating all the possible -and of course reasonable- object can be a way for solving this problem *(i.e. Pipe_Designed v.s. Pipe_Designed_NeedInspection)*, but I have a large number of interfaces by now, that make it difficult. I wonder if there is a way to have dynamic properties, something like the following dialog to allow the end user to select available functionalities for his/hers new object.

@TITLE:Create a new tab or window for a web page from ASP.NET
@CONTENT:I have a main page that I want to be a sort of dispatch center for the user in my web application. So I want the main page the stay open, but when the user selects certain tasks I can set it up so that a new tab or page is created with the task that they selected. I know how to transfer control to another page, but how can I do something like a Server.Transfer only make that new page appear in a new tab and keep the existing page open in the old tab/window? To give an example of what I'm doing. I currently have a repeater on my main page which constructs a list of LinkButtons. The LinkButtons have text from the data source. Once the user clicks on a link button, I want to open a new page and I want Session state to be preserved with this new page. Can this be done, and how? I'm using the version of ASP.NET in .NET 3.5. Edit: I don't care whether its a tab or window. I just want to be able to spawn a new web page and keep the existing one open.

@TITLE:SSIS - Is there a Data Flow Source component that will handle CSV files where the column order may change?
@CONTENT:We have written a number of SSIS packages that import data from CSV files using the Flat File Source. It now seems that after these packages are deployed into production, the providers of these files may deliver files where the column order of the files changes (Don't ask!). Currently if this happens, our packages will fail. For example, an additional column is inserted at the beginning of each row. In this case, the flat file source continues to use the existing column order, which obviously has a detrimental effect on the transformation! Eg. Using a trivial example, the original file has the following content : OurReference,Client,Amount
235,MFI,20000.00
236,MS,30000.00
 The output from the flat file source is : OurReference   Client   Amount
235            ClientA  20000.00
236            ClientB  30000.00
 Subsequently, the file delivered changes to : OurReference,ClientReference,Client,Amount
235,A244,ClientA,20000.00
236,B222,ClientB,30000.00
 When the existing unchanged package is run against this file, the output from the flat file source is : OurReference   Client   Amount
235            A244     ClientA,20000.00
236            B222     ClientB,30000.00
 Ideally, we would like to use a data source that will cope with this problem - ie which produces output based on the column names, instead of the column order. Any suggestions would be welcomed!
@CODE:OurReference,Client,Amount
235,MFI,20000.00
236,MS,30000.00 OurReference   Client   Amount
235            ClientA  20000.00

@CONTENT:A few days ago, I asked a question regarding dynamically modifying a function's code midway through the outerlying script's execution and I was told to completely forget ever coming upon the notion. I'm not sure I understand why that is. Let me give an example: <script>
var display = function(msg)
 {
alert(msg);
 }

// Now, at the moment, the display() function
// is receiving a single parameter and alerting
// it to the user. I'm now going to use eval()
// to modify the display() function.

eval('display = ' + display.toString().replace('alert(', 'document.write('));

// Now, the display() function writes its parameter
// to the document as opposed to alerting it.
</script>
 I realize this is a rather trivial example, but there must surely be some use that can be derived from being able to dynamically modify a function, something so useful by itself.
@CODE:<script>
var display = function(msg)
 {
alert(msg);
 }

// Now, at the moment, the display() function
// is receiving a single parameter and alerting
// it to the user. I'm now going to use eval()

eval('display = ' + display.toString().replace('alert(', 'document.write('));

@TITLE:Tomcat/IIS closes socket after http response has completed
@CONTENT:I am using JBoss 4.0.4 GA, which has Tomcat Servlet Container 5.5. I also have IIS 6.0 redirected to this JBoss. (via IIS tomcat connector, which is used as ISAPI filter in IIS). All is working OK, configured the workers as described. Here is a piece of workers.properties file of the connector: #
# Defining a worker named ajp13 and of type ajp13
# Note that the name and the type do not have to match.
#
worker.jboss0_ajp13.port=8009
worker.jboss0_ajp13.type=ajp13
worker.jboss0_ajp13.host=localhost
worker.jboss0_ajp13.socket_keepalive=1
worker.jboss0_ajp13.socket_timeout=300
 But when connecting to the application via IIS (port 80), for each completed HTTP response for HTTP request, the socket is closed (FIN is sent on the TCP layer). This causes severe slowdowns, since the application is working over WAN. (for each closed socket, another one needed to be established, which takes 500ms). This is not happening when connecting to JBoss web server directly, and also not happening when connecting to a different virtual directory on the same WebServer instanse of IIS (i.e. Keep-Alive in IIS is also configured). This happens with the latest version of tomcat IIS connector. Do you know if there is a bug in the connector, or there is a problem with my configuration? Thanks in advance, Henry.

@CONTENT:I have a List of a "complex" type - an object with a few string properties. The List itself is a property of another object and contains objects of a variety of types, as shown in this abbreviated class structure: Customer {
   public List<Characteristic> Characteristics;
   .
   .
   .
}

Characteristic {
   public string CharacteristicType;
   public string CharacteristicValue;
}
 I'd like to be able to collect a List of the values of a given type of Characteristics for the current Customer, which I can do in a 2-step process as follows: List<Characteristic> interestCharacteristics = customer.Characteristics.FindAll(
   delegate (Characteristic interest) {
      return interest.CharacteristicType == "Interest";
   }
);

List<string> interests = interestCharacteristics.ConvertAll<string>(
   delegate (Characteristic interest) {
      return interest.CharacteristicValue;
   }
);
 That works fine, but it seems like a long way around. I'm sure I must be missing a simpler way of getting to this list, either by chaining together the FindAll() and Convert() methods, or something else I'm overlooking entirely. For background, I'm working in .Net 2.0, so I'm limited to the .Net 2 generics, and the Characteristic class is an external dependency - I can't change it's structure to simplify it, and there are other aspects of the class that are important, just not in relations to this problem. Any pointers or additional reading welcomed.

@TITLE:Testing Custom Control derived from ComboBox
@CONTENT:I've created a control derived from ComboBox, and wish to unit test its behaviour. However, it appears to be behaving differently in my unit test to how it behaves in the real application. In the real application, the Combobox.DataSource property and the .Items sync up - in other words when I change the Combobox.DataSource the .Items list immediately and automatically updates to show an item for each element of the DataSource. In my test, I construct a ComboBox, assign a datasource to it, but the .Items list doesn't get updated at all, remaining at 0 items. Thus, when I try to update the .SelectedIndex to 0 in the test to select the first item, I recieve an ArgumentOutOfRangeException. Is this because I don't have an Application.Run in my unit test starting an event loop, or is this a bit of a red herring? EDIT: More detail on the first test:     [SetUp]
    public void SetUp()
    {
        mECB = new EnhancedComboBox();

        mECB.FormattingEnabled = true;
        mECB.Location = new System.Drawing.Point( 45, 4 );
        mECB.Name = "cboFind";
        mECB.Size = new System.Drawing.Size( 121, 21 );
        mECB.TabIndex = 3;

        mECB.AddObserver( this );

        mTestItems = new List<TestItem>();
        mTestItems.Add( new TestItem() { Value = "Billy" } );
        mTestItems.Add( new TestItem() { Value = "Bob" } );
        mTestItems.Add( new TestItem() { Value = "Blues" } );

        mECB.DataSource = mTestItems;
        mECB.Reset();

        mObservedValue = null;
    }

    [Test]
    public void Test01_UpdateObserver()
    {
        mECB.SelectedIndex = 0;
        Assert.AreEqual( "Billy", mObservedValue.Value );
    }
 The test fails on the first line, when trying to set the SelectedIndex to 0. On debugging, this appears to be because when the .DataSource is changed, the .Items collection is not updated to reflect this. However, on debugging the real application, the .Items collection is always updated when the .DataSource changes. Surely I don't have to actually render the ComboBox in the test, I don't even have any drawing surfaces set up to render on to! Maybe the only answer I need is "How do I make the ComboBox update in the same way as when it is drawn, in a unit test scenario where I don't actually need to draw the box?"
@CODE:[SetUp]
    public void SetUp()
    {
        mECB = new EnhancedComboBox();

        mECB.FormattingEnabled = true;

@CONTENT:Since I've gotten no answer at all to my question Is there an alternative to MKS Yacc that supports selection preference syntax or something very similar?, I'll ask the more basic question: Has anyone used the "selection preferences" provided by MKS Yacc? If you have, what did you use it for? Also, does it make any sense to use it in anything other than the last position in a rule? I have to look after a grammar which figures rules such as:     TOKEN1 LPAREN non_terminal1 [^EQUAL] TOKEN2 non_terminal2 RPAREN
 Unless I'm misunderstanding something, the embedded selection preference doesn't provide any value whatsoever in this context. Background MKS Yacc supports a notation which their web site calls "selection preference syntax". It isn't illustrated, but it consists of a token or list of tokens in square brackets with a caret (which might be optional), and it indicates that the particular token must not follow this construct, but that token is not counted as part of this rule: non_terminal1:  TOKEN1 non_terminal2 TOKEN2 [^TOKEN3]
 So, this rules says that a TOKEN1 followed by a non_terminal2 and a TOKEN2 is a non_terminal1, unless the next token is a TOKEN3 in which case some other rule applies. (I'm not clear whether the bracketed item can be a non-terminal. The code I've seen using the notation always uses a token or a couple of space separated tokens, and never a non-terminal. I'm also not clear whether the caret is required; again, all the examples I've seen use the caret.)

@TITLE:Efficient join with a ：correlated； subquery
@CONTENT:Given three tables Dates(date aDate, doUse boolean), Days(rangeId int, day int, qty int) and Range(rangeId int, startDate date) in Oracle I want to join these so that Range is joined with Dates from aDate = startDate where doUse = 1 whith each day in Days. Given a single range it might be done something like this SELECT rangeId, aDate, CASE WHEN doUse = 1 THEN qty ELSE 0 END AS qty
FROM (
    SELECT aDate, doUse, SUM(doUse) OVER (ORDER BY aDate) day
    FROM Dates 
    WHERE aDate >= :startDAte
) INNER JOIN (
    SELECT rangeId, day,qty
    FROM Days
    WHERE rangeId = :rangeId
) USING (day)
ORDER BY day ASC
 What I want to do is make query for all ranges in Range, not just one. The problem is that the join value "day" is dependent on the range startDate to be calculated, wich gives me some trouble in formulating a query. Keep in mind that the Dates table is pretty huge so I would like to avoid calculating the day value from the first date in the table, while each Range Days shouldn't be more than a 100 days or so. Edit: Sample data Dates                            Days

@TITLE:How to read inline styling of an element?
@CONTENT:Howdy all. I'd like to know if it's possible to determine what inline styling has been attributed to an HTML element. I do not need to retrieve the value, but rather just detect if it's been set inline or not. For instance, if the HTML were: <div id="foo" style="width: 100px; height: 100px; background: green;"></div>
 How can I determine that "width," "height," and "background" have been explicitly declared, inline? As far as I can tell, the solution can work two ways. I can ask it if a specific attribute is set and it will tell me true or false, or it can tell me all attributes that have been set. Like so: var obj = document.getElementById('foo');
obj.hasInlineStyle('width');  //returns true;
obj.hasInlineStyle('border'); //returns false;

//or

obj.getInlineStyles();   //returns array with values:
                       // 'width' 'height' and 'background'
 I'm not interested in css attributes that are inherited via declarations in a stylesheet, only inline styles. One last thing, I have no control over the HTML source. Thanks
@CODE:<div id="foo" style="width: 100px; height: 100px; background: green;"></div> var obj = document.getElementById('foo');
obj.hasInlineStyle('width');  //returns true;

My next approach would be to override JTabbedPane.insertTab(String title, Icon icon, Component component, String tip, int index) and setting the preferred size of the label component, but this doesn't seem very elegant and I'm not even sure it would work at all.

@CONTENT:MKS Yacc supports a notation which their web site calls "selection preference syntax". It isn't illustrated, but it consists of a token in square brackets, optionally with a caret, and it indicates that a particular token is required to follow, or is required not to follow, the rest of the rules: non_terminal:  TOKEN1 non_terminal2 TOKEN2 [TOKEN3]

non_terminal:  TOKEN1 non_terminal2 TOKEN2 [^TOKEN3]
 (I'm not clear whether the bracketed item can be a non-terminal. The code I've seen using the notation always uses a token or a couple of space separated tokens, and never a non-terminal.) Is anyone aware of an alternative Yacc-compatible system (preferably open source) that provides the same support (notation can differ - functionality can't), running on Unix or Linux machines, preferably available in source format? (MKS Yacc also provides some flexibility in handling errors and adjusting the error behaviour. One way in which that can be used is to treat keywords as identifiers when they are encountered in a position that makes no sense when they are treated as keywords. I was able to retrofit that into byacc - Berkeley Yacc - but I haven't spent enough time working out how to handle 'selection preferences'.) See also: Has anyone used the "selection preference" mechanism provided by MKS Yacc?

 into the model, as so: def set_status

  if (consulted_legal == true) && (consulted_marketing == true)
      status = "Pending Approval"
  elsif (consulted_legal == true) && (consulted_marketing == false)

 I am calling that from a before_save callback. As a default, both the consulted_legal and consulted_marketing attributes are set to false and not null, which is why I am testing for == false or true here, instead of asking if consulted_legal?

 The date is apparantly not restored. I can not see that the headers are obviously different in any way.

My script has worked on over 3000 emails, ensuring all clients displays the emails in the right order aftr moving servers and all files having the same date, but for some reason it will not work on a particular email. Have I left something obvious out of the script? edit: the date is apparently restored from the script, however clients that rely on mtimes will not display this message regardless of what the script sets the date to.

@TITLE:in Drupal, how to make login state consistent between browser pages and embedded XMLRPC client?
@CONTENT:I have a Drupal site with user logins. Embedded within this site is a Flash application that shows some data to everybody but allows extra functionality if the user is logged on. From within Flash, I'm using XMLRPC to access the system.check method (to determine whether the user is logged in) and the user.login method (to log in a user from within Flash). Within Flash, everything works fine. However the Flash login state does not seem to correspond to the rest of the site. For example, if I invoke user.login via XMLRPC, subsequent calls to system.check show that I am logged in, but the Drupal user page still says I'm logged out. Or if I am logged in both places and then I log out via the Drupal user page, the next call to system.check still indicates that I am logged in. How can I make the login state consistent between the Drupal GUI and my embedded Flash app? (Note: I am not using any XMLRPC library, I am just constructing the requisite XML manually and sending POST methods using a URLRequest object.) EDIT: I have confirmed via this question and also via testing with a Web Proxy that the SESS cookie returned by the user login page is being picked up and sent back by the flash application. EDIT: And now I have shown experimentally that even though Flash (via Safari) is sending the same cookie, it gets back a DIFFERENT cookie when it connects to the XMLRPC service than when it requests and HTML page. In other words, Drupal just doesn't support this kind of synchronization and I'm stuck. I'm accepting the answer below that put me on the right track. EDIT: AMHPHP is not fully released for Drupal6 as of this writing, but it turned out to be installed on the site anyway. Using the DrupalSite library, I was very easily able to log into and out of the site from flash, and the login remained consistent between flash and HTML.

@CONTENT:I'm having trouble creating a mouseover function with an NSTableView. The idea is that (if the feature is selected in prefs) placing the mouse pointer above a particular row in an NSTabelView will display a small popup window with additional information regarding the entry in that particular row. The effect should not be immediate (as e.g. highliting a button when rolling over it), but come with a delay of a few seconds. So far, I have implemented this functionality using the tooltip delegate method, but this does not allow for customization of the window and does not work well (layout wise) if more than 1-3 rows of info need to be displayed. In Hillegass' book it is suggested that one uses the mouseEntered/mouseExited methods for rollovers, but as far as I can tell this works with pre-defined areas of a window and not rows in a table view.

An example is shown at jQuery Sound Plug-in Demo, however I can not get this working in IE7 and IE8 Beta. I am getting a JavaScript issue within the section of code below. load: function(evt, url) {

	var movie = self.data("sound.get_movie")(id);
	movie.load(url);
	self.data("sound.isPlaying", true);
},
 The plug-in is also using the following function to get the Flash movie which looks fine for IE browsers. var get_movie = function(id) {
	var movie = null;
	if ($.browser.msie) {
		movie = window[id];
	} else {
		movie = document[id];

@CONTENT:I have a case where I need to serve "raw" swf files to the browser. That is, without embedding. We have had some problems making this work in IE now and then but managed to work around it. Until now. We're fixing some other issues with serving documents and as a side effect the flash files stop working in IE. Flash controls the browser display area (you get the Flash context menu instead of IE:s) but the flash file doesn't render. I can't figure out what I've changed that made it stop working. Much because our workarounds for making it work have been true trial-and-error efforts. (We've never quite understood the underpinnings of the problem.) The flash files render fine in the previous version of our system. I've tested with Flash Player 9 and 10 and there's no difference. I'm totally stuck. Anyone has a clue on where I could try some digging? EDIT: Following the advice by MatthieuP and Kristian J, I found out what it was about. It wasn't the headers as such, but the proxy I used for looking at the headers revealed an interesting thing**: When IE fetches an swf that's not embedded it requests the file twice (I'm guessing that the ActiveX component creates a HTML document with the embed code in it and then the file gets requested from that document too.) This duplicate fetching spells p r o b l e m s for us since file requests to our system needs to have a valid one-time token to succeed. It's doomed to fail for the second request. Thanks for your answers. You got +1 each from me for giving it a shot.

@TITLE:TableView won't send setEditing message to cells
@CONTENT:So far I have a UITableView, it works properly and all. My problem is when going into "editing" mode, apparently the cells are not changing at all, and the red sign (delete control) only shows up when I drag the cell out of the tableview (meaning the iphone reloads the cell again, and it is here when it detects that the cell was "flagged" as editing). The problem is right when I select "edit" button, red controls should show up but they don't. I did implement the tableview's delegate method for returning a editing type control ( either an insert ot deletion) and no luck.

From the adobe site. http://kb.adobe.com/selfservice/viewContent.do?externalId=tn_15683&sliceId=1 the really cool thing about that is their source file download link is dead. and coming across another post: http://www.jesuscarrera.info/2009/01/05/communication-between-actionscript-3-and-javascript/ The download works... except the fla file is blank and running the html page you can receive text from the flash movie... but you can't send text from html to the flash movie. I followed the steps pretty closely, can anybody see anything wrong w/ the instructions on the adobe site? And if ANYBODY can reeeeeally help me out, could you post a source example of this functionality? Thanks everybody for your time!

@CONTENT:My application (written in WPF/C#) will monitor a live video source and will need to store small video segments and image stills. I'm hesitant to use a user defined "temp" directory since this would potentially allow a user to modify or delete these files causing major issues with my application. Alternatively, I have attempted to store these items in memory (BitmapSource object for the images) but cannot find an equivalent object for video. Should I byte the bullet and use a temp directory and simply use the image's URI or is their a better approach? Thank you in advance!

Do you know of such an API? UPDATE: It seems that this code hasn't necessarily been written as many times over as I'd hoped. The solved problem, apparently, is dealing directly with the analog input via particular devices. What I'm looking for is an algorithm that takes as input a direct digital sample of the analog signal (with sufficient resolution to pick up the changes specified in the standard) and returns a video picture, similar to what this person wanted and had to build himself.

@CONTENT:How can I create a Java/Swing text component that is both styled and has a custom font? I want to highlight a small portion of the text in red, but at the same time use a custom (embedded via Font.createFont) font. JLabel accepts HTML text, which allows me to highlight a portion of the text, but it ignores font settings when rendering HTML. Other text components such as JTextArea will use the custom font, but they won't render HTML. What's the easiest way to do both? Here's an example of using JTextPane unsuccessfully:     JTextPane textPane = new JTextPane();
    textPane.setFont(myCustomFont);
    textPane.setText(text);
    MutableAttributeSet attributes = new SimpleAttributeSet();
    StyleConstants.setForeground(attributes, Color.RED);
    textPane.getStyledDocument().setCharacterAttributes(
        text.indexOf(toHighlight),
        toHighlight.length(),
        attributes, true
    );
 This successfully displays the text with the "toHighlight" portion highlighted in red, but it doesn't use myCustomFont. Note that I could set a String font with StyleConstants.setFontFamily(), but not a custom font.
@CODE:Font.createFont JTextPane textPane = new JTextPane();
    textPane.setFont(myCustomFont);

@TITLE:How do I merge two columns in a DataSet?
@CONTENT:Previously I've asked about inserting a column into a dataset. I now have a similar question...namely merging two or more columns into a single column. Lets say I have the following data set: DataSet ds = new DataSet();
ds.Tables.Add(new DataTable());
ds.Tables[0].Columns.Add("id", typeof(int));
ds.Tables[0].Columns.Add("firstname", typeof(string));
ds.Tables[0].Columns.Add("lastname", typeof(string));
 I am needing to combine the "firstname" and "lastname" columns into a single column called "name". Would it be best for me to create a method that merges two columns together or a more general one that can be used to merge multiple columns together? My idea is to create a generalized method sort of like the following: MergeColumns(string format, string mergedColumn, DataTable dt, params string[] columnsToMerge) The user supplies a format as follows: "{0} {1}" mergedColumn is the name of the new column...but it must be able to be the same as one of the columns that will be merged cause in my real world case I'm merging "name" and "given_names" into "name"...but I still want to be able to use it if I ever needed to merge "street", "city", "state" "postcode" etc into a column called "address". The way I am thinking this would be used is as follows: MergeColumns("{0} {1}", "name", dataTable, "firstname", "lastname"); given the above dataset, I would expect the resultant data set to look as follows: DataSet ds = new DataSet();
ds.Tables.Add(new DataTable());
ds.Tables[0].Columns.Add("id", typeof(int));
ds.Tables[0].Columns.Add("name", typeof(string));
 Does this seem like a reasonable approach? Does a method like this already exist? I don't want to reinvent the wheel. Also, am I creating a method that does more than I actually need right now?
@CODE:DataSet ds = new DataSet();
ds.Tables.Add(new DataTable());
ds.Tables[0].Columns.Add("id", typeof(int));
ds.Tables[0].Columns.Add("firstname", typeof(string));
ds.Tables[0].Columns.Add("lastname", typeof(string)); DataSet ds = new DataSet();

@TITLE:Crystal Reports - No rowset was returned for this table, query or procedure - Crash!
@CONTENT:I am using Crystal Reports 8.0.1.0 and have an OLEDB connection set as "favourite". We have several reports being run against a few stored procedures on the database. Our database is an SQLExpress 2005 named instance. One of the reports deals with balance, i.e. we have to provide a balance report for a specific company or set of companies. The customer, however, has specifically asked us to have a separate section to be the last one for a specific economic account typology and in order to do this, we have to separate this one from the others which are instead displayed using two parallel subreports. Hence our structure should be like follows:                            GENERAL HEADING
                          PATRIMONIAL STATE
                              ...data...

                              ...data...
                         THIRD-PARTY EFFECTS
                              ...data...
 The first two sections below the general heading are achieved with two parallel subreports, so now we have to display the third section. Is it clear up to now? Well, as you may well be aware, CR subreports require you to set the database location, regardless if you have set one up already for main report. The problem, however, is that if I try to set the location pointing to our stored procedure(which returns ALL the data for the balance report), the first time it will display the message in subject, and the second time again, but this time it'll also crash. Our stored procedure has a parameter and both previous subreports(the ones in parallel) are set to the same SP and are working flawlessly. This crash makes it impossible for me to work on the third section and I'm pretty much at loss as to what would be the best approach to solve the issue at hand. Any ideas/suggestions? I would love to receive your answers and I hope my problem was clear enough(I'm very willing to further delve into it for clarification if ever needed). Thank you so much for your time, Andrea Raimondi

@TITLE:How to implement ：class versioning； (using different version of the same class)
@CONTENT:Here is the problem : our main class (say : Contract) change every year. Some properties are added, other are removed. We don't know how it will look next year. It may change a lot or not at all. On the other hand, we now (new requirement...) have to keep an historic of every contracts. Each time the user update a contract, the whole object must be stored in a backup (e.g. - serialized in a table). Of course, we must be able to read it back... One option (brutal) is to have a new Contract class every year (Contract2008, Contract2009, ...). But it would be very cumbersome (and ugly) since a lot of classes depend on Contract - in facts, we would have to create a bunch of new classes every year. Ever have this kind of problem ? Any suggestion ? Thanks in advance ! (We're using C# 2.0.) ADDED : Thank for your answers. We're now asking ourself how we could use a dictionary / an XML file to implement versioning without breaking all the code. Dictionary seems very sexy in this context :o)

@CONTENT:from this post http://stackoverflow.com/questions/334183/what-is-the-most-efficient-way-to-store-tags-in-a-database It was recommended to store tag tables like this. Table: Item
Columns: ItemID, Title, Content

Table: Tag
Columns: TagID, Title

Table: ItemTag
Columns: ItemID, TagID
 And another SO post said the same thing. Can anyone explain why tags should be stored like this? I am guessing ItemID is some internal val, title is the tag name (c++, sql, noob, etc) content is whatever else data i want to store with my item. why not something like Table: Item
Columns: ItemID, Title, <more data i want>

Table: TagList
Columns: ItemID, Title
 title in item being "item name" and tag title being "c++" "sql" "noob" "etc"

@CONTENT:I have a form which contains a whole heap of data entry fields that will be completed by the user including some elements where the user can dictate how many of the same items they will enter.

@TITLE:strange HashMap.put() behaviour
@CONTENT:I am attempting to troubleshoot an intermittent failure that appears to be related to removing an object from a HashMap and then putting that same object back using a new key. My HashMap is created as follows: transactions = new HashMap<Short, TransactionBase>();
 The code that does the re-assignment is as follows: transactions.remove(transaction.tran_no);
transaction.tran_no = generate_transaction_id();
transactions.put(transaction.tran_no, transaction);
 The intermittent behaviour that I am seeing is that code that executes immediately after this that depends upon the transaction object being locatable does not appear to find the transaction object using the new transaction id. However, at some future point, the transaction can be located. So pulling at straws, is there any sort of asynchronous effect to put() or remove that can cause this sort of behaviour? I should mention that, to the best of my knowledge, the container is being accessed by only one thread. I have already read in he documentation that class HashMap is not "synchronised".

I then create another user control that inherits from the base user control. I resize the inherited control (e.g. increase height or width). Throw the inherited control onto the form. Run. The inherited control does not honor the anchor properties of the Ok and Cancel buttons. Here are the exact steps to repro. 1 - Create a new winforms project 2 - Create a base control (BaseControl1) with a Ok and Cancel buttons located at bottom/right. Anchor them there at Bottom,Right. Compile the app. 3 - Create a new User Control (UserControl1) that inherits from the base control (BaseControl1), created in step 1. 4 - Increase (in the designer) UserControl1's height or width. 5 - Throw UserControl1 onto Form1. Run. You'll see that Ok and Cancel buttons are not where they are supposed to be. Am I doing something wrong, or does VS2008 simply not honor the anchor properties of the controls on the base user control?

When the user changes the default font size and resolution etc in Windows the edges of the form lose controls (they get pushed off the visible portion of the form) typically dropping off buttons from the bottom. This is problematic for us and will cause issues across other applications using the standard look-and-feel framework we are creating around these applications.

@TITLE:what is the best strategy to retrieve form data? client ajax / server
@CONTENT:Recently I was introduced to Ajax form data handling, including the use of jTemplates to guarantee some repeatability and jQuery, a great library. But I'm a little confused. With the form-user interaction, I use Ajax calls and deal with pure HTML markup. So if I want to bind form data on loading of the form, I need to do that with the Ajax by way of jQuery/JS. This doesn't seem good to me. I feel that onLoad initializing should only occur on the server. However then I need to find some way to expose the form markup so that later Ajax interactions will be straightforward. For example, if I want to bind some list on the server, what control can handle this in a way such that I later can add/delete items with Ajax? I hope that I made my point clear. Thanks for the help!

@LINK:/questions/439729/decorator-chaining-of-repositories-and-specialized-repositories-with-dependancy
@TITLE:Decorator Chaining of Repositories and Specialized Repositories with Dependancy Injection
@CONTENT:Right now I'm trying to figure out a way to do things smarter, and in the course of doing so all i've managed to do is use a full bottle of excedrin in a single day. Assume i have an interface called IRepository like so.  public interface IRepository<T>
 {
    T Get(int id);
    void Add(T value);
    void Update(T value);
    void Delete(T value);
    ...
 }
 And assume i have an implementation like public class NHibernateRepository<T>
{
    ...
}
 Now, all is fine and good, i can do all my basic operations against the repository to support all CRUD functionality, but i may want specialized operations, so assume i have an interface like this: public interface IUserRepository : IRepository<User>
{
     IList<User> GetUsersByRole(Role role);
}
 And an implementation like such: public class UserRepository : NHibernateRepository<User>, IUserRepository
{
    ....
}
 Ok, so that is the basic setup, now there's one more thing that i want to do. I want to have logging and transaction and things like that all transparently. So what i would like to do is use a dependency injection framework like Castle Windsor or StructureMap so that when i ask for IRepository, i'll get it wrapped by a LoggingRepository and a TransactionRepository, both of which implement IRepository. So, what i want to do is something like this: IUserRepository repository = container.Resolve< IUserRepository>();
 and have it return a user repository that's wrapped in the Logging and Transaction decorators, but i can't think of a way that this will ever work. The only way i can think of getting this to work is by implementing UserRepository like such: public class UserRepository : DecoratorRepository<T>, IUserRepository
{
    protected IRepository<T> Repository { get; set; }

    public UserRepository(IRepository<T> innerRepository)
    {
        Repository = innerRepository;
    }
}
 This would mean that we would use Dependancy Injection to create a decorated repository and pass that into the constructor of the UserRepository and then use that as the repository in which we run operations against. This would work, but i still don't think it's ideal. So, my question is, am I right in that this is the only way to do this, or am I not understanding this correctly or just missing something all together. Also, if you have run up against this problem before, how did you solve this problem?
@CODE:public interface IRepository<T>
 {
    T Get(int id);
    void Add(T value);
    void Update(T value);
    void Delete(T value);
    ...
 } public class NHibernateRepository<T>
{
    ...
} public interface IUserRepository : IRepository<User>
{
     IList<User> GetUsersByRole(Role role);
} public class UserRepository : NHibernateRepository<User>, IUserRepository
{
    ....
} IUserRepository repository = container.Resolve< IUserRepository>(); public class UserRepository : DecoratorRepository<T>, IUserRepository
{
    protected IRepository<T> Repository { get; set; }

    public UserRepository(IRepository<T> innerRepository)
    {
        Repository = innerRepository;
    }
} UnitOfWork IUserRepository IRepository<User> UserRepository : IRepository<User> IUserRepository IRepository<User>

@LINK:/questions/439507/id-fields-in-sql-tables-rule-or-law
@TITLE:ID fields in SQL tables: rule or law?
@CONTENT:Just a quick database design question: Do you ALWAYS use an ID field in EVERY table, or just most of them? Clearly most of your tables will benefit, but are there ever tables that you might not want to use an ID field? For example, I want to add the ability to add tags to objects in another table (foo). So I've got a table FooTag with a varchar field to hold the tag, and a fooID field to refer to the row in foo. Do I really need to create a clustered index around an essentially arbitrary ID field? Wouldn't it be more efficient to use fooID and my text field as the clustered index, since I will almost always be searching by fooID anyway? Plus using my text in the clustered index would keep the data sorted, making sorting easier when I have to query my data. The downside is that inserts would take longer, but wouldn't that be offset by the gains during selection, which would happen far more often? What are your thoughts on ID fields? Bendable rule, or unbreakable law? edit: I am aware that the example provided is not normalized. If tagging is to be a major part of the project, with multiple tables being tagged, and other 'extras', a two-table solution would be a clear answer. However in this simplest case, would normalization be worthwhile? It would save some space, but require an extra join when running queries

I'm using Visual C# express. What's the best way to do this without requiring some sort of database like MySQL or MSSQL or Access? If the only way or easiest way is a database, I'd rather use Access. If so, does the user of the program need Access installed for my program to run on their computer? What if I go with another database? p.s. I forgot to mention, I'd rather the user not be able to access this file and read the contents easily. Text file without encryption would be easy to open. Any way to encrypt this? Also, if I use a delimiter like ':', then that means the user cannot use that character. So any other way? Thanks!

@CONTENT:I'm trying to debug a web service (Windows XP SP3, VS 2008, ASP.NET 2, VB.NET). For most of it, if the asp.net worker process is already loaded, I can start the Windows form that calls the web service, attach to aspnet_wp.exe in Visual Studio, and then debug to my heart's content, but catching the Application Start event in global.asax is a pain. If I reset IIS, of course there is no process to attach to, until the Application start event is all over. The only way I've found to do this is create a separate aspx page, set it as the start page, and run that - then I can stop on the break in the App start event, but it's a nuisance having to maintain a page that's essentially just a test stub. Any ideas for something a bit neater? Kind of, "Attach to a process as soon as it starts". Better still, of course, would be not to have to attach explicitly to aspnet_wp.exe in order to be able to debug the web service, but I haven't found a way of doing that either. Thanks for any suggestions.

@TITLE:Where should I put Velocity template files for a command line utility built with Maven?
@CONTENT:I have a small command line utility project that I'm using Maven to manage. The utility is a very simple app to populate a Velocity template and dump the results to a new file. My problem is where to put my Velocity templates. When I put them in src/test/resources/foo/bar/baz, mvn test fails because it can't find the referenced template, even though it is clearly there in target/classes/foo/bar/baz, which is where the .class file for the test and the class under test are located. If I put the template in the top-level directory of the project, the test passes, but then I'm not following the Maven project structure, and I suspect that the actual packaged .jar file wouldn't function. What am I missing? UPDATE: Method under test: public final void mergeTemplate(final String templateFileName, final Writer writer) throws ResourceNotFoundException, ParseErrorException, MethodInvocationException, IOException, Exception {
    Velocity.init();
    Velocity.mergeTemplate(templateFileName, Charset.defaultCharset().name(), context(), writer);
}
 Test method: @Test
public void testMergeTemplate() throws Exception {
    final FooGenerator generator = new FooGenerator();
    final StringWriter writer = new StringWriter();
    generator.mergeTemplate("foo.yaml", writer);
    Assert.assertEquals("Something went horribly, horribly wrong.", EXPECTED_RESULT, writer.toString().trim());
}
 The only place I can place foo.yaml and have the tests pass is in the root directory of the project, i.e., as a peer of src and target.
@CODE:src/test/resources/foo/bar/baz mvn test target/classes/foo/bar/baz .class public final void mergeTemplate(final String templateFileName, final Writer writer) throws ResourceNotFoundException, ParseErrorException, MethodInvocationException, IOException, Exception {
    Velocity.init();
    Velocity.mergeTemplate(templateFileName, Charset.defaultCharset().name(), context(), writer);
} @Test
public void testMergeTemplate() throws Exception {
    final FooGenerator generator = new FooGenerator();
    final StringWriter writer = new StringWriter();

@CONTENT:When trying to load a large text file into the oracle db using SQLLoader, we get the following errors: SQL*Loader-926: OCI-Error; uldlfca:OCIDirPathColArrayLoadStream for table <myTabele>
SQL*Loader-2026: the load was aborted because SQL Loader cannot continue.
SQL*Loader-925: Error in uldlgs: OCIStmtExecute (ptc_hp)
 This only happens in DIRECT mode, when we're using the conventional path method, everything is fine (but a lot slower). So I assume it can't be a problem with the data or the general parts of the control file. While the error message is quite amusing, what can I do to get everything to work? Versions: SQLLoader 9.2.0.1, Database is a 10.2.0.3.0 (64-bit) EDIT After some more trying, it seems that the problems are caused by using functions to convert some of the input. When I remove the functions (with the resulting changes in the table definition), everything seems to be working fine. Is it possible that when doing a direct load I cannot use functions? The documentation says that starting with version 9.x it should work ...

@TITLE:Modifying the Data Source for the Strongly Typed Dataset connection string
@CONTENT:Here are two questions related to modifying the data source for strongly typed dataset connection string. When my app is deployed, a light weight database ( in the form of Microsoft Access) is deployed to the Application Data folder. I have a strongly typed dataset that is wrapped around that. So the question is how to change the following app.config code: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<configuration>
    <configSections>
    </configSections>
    <connectionStrings>
        <add name="XTrace.Properties.Settings.Timer_DBConnectionString"
            connectionString="Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;Data Source=&quot;|DataDirectory|\Timer DB.mdb&quot;;Persist Security Info=True"
            providerName="System.Data.OleDb" />
    </connectionStrings>
</configuration>
 To make it read from the Application Data folder copy? I read from SO and elsewhere that it's best to use app.config or web.config to manage the connection string. But since the app.config is compiled into the Windows Form, how does it suppose to provide the flexibility that allows one to change the connection string at deployment time? I am not talking about web app though, because I understand that it's possible that web app distributes the web.config and from that file you can modify your connection string.
@CODE:<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<configuration>
    <configSections>
    </configSections>
    <connectionStrings>
        <add name="XTrace.Properties.Settings.Timer_DBConnectionString"

 The first assignment of &rval to a literal value fails as expected. If I comment out that line the code compiles and runs. I understand why the initialization fails, but I'm confused why the assignment to rval works in the last line. I didn't think it was allowed to assign a reference to a literal value. EDIT: Thanks for the quick answers. I'm tempted to delete this to hide my shame, but I think I'll leave it here so everyone else can point and laugh. In my own defense, I'm working through the exercises in a book (C++ Primer) and this problem is about reference initialization. Still, it's pretty embarrassing to have so completely overlooked the point of a reference in the first place. :)

@LINK:/questions/429174/possible-to-add-large-amount-of-dom-nodes-without-browser-choking
@TITLE:Possible to add large amount of DOM nodes without browser choking?
@CONTENT:I have a webpage on my site that displays a table, reloads the XML source data every 10 seconds (with an XmlHttpRequest), and then updates the table to show the user any additions or removals of the data. To do this, the JavaScript function first clears out all elements from the table and then adds a new row for each unit of data. Recently, I battled thru a number of memory leaks in Internet Explorer caused by this DOM destroy-and-create code (most of them having to do with circular references between JavaScript objects and DOM objects, and the JavaScript library we are using quietly keeping a reference to every JS object created with new Element(...) until the page is unloaded). With the memory problems solved, we've now uncovered a CPU-based problem: when the user has a large amount of data to view (100+ units of data, which equals 100 <tr> nodes to create, plus all of the table cells for each column), the process ties up the CPU until Internet Explorer prompts the user with: Stop running this script? A script on this page is causing Internet Explorer to run slowly. If it continues to run, your computer may become unresponsive. It seems that running the row-and-cell-creation code times 100+ pieces of data is what is causing the CPU usage to spike, the function to take "too long" (from IE's perspective) to run, thus causing IE to generate this warning for the user. I've also noticed that while the "update screen" function runs for the 100 rows, IE does not re-render the table contents until the function completes (since the JS interpreter is using 100% CPU for that time period, I assume). So my question is: Is there any way in JavaScript to tell the browser to pause JS execution and re-render the DOM? If not, are there any strategies for handling creating large amounts of DOM nodes and not having the browser choke? One method I can think of would be to handle the "update table" logic asynchronously; that is, once the Ajax method to reload the XML data is complete, put the data into some sort of array, and then set a function (using setInterval()) to run which will handle one element of the array at a time. However this seems a little bit like re-creating threading in a JavaScript environment, which seems like it could get very complicated (i.e. what if another Ajax data request fires while I'm still re-creating the table's DOM nodes?, etc.) update: Just wanted to explain why I'm accepting RoBurg's answer. In doing some testing, I've found that the new Element() method in my framework (I'm using mootools) is about 2x as slow as the traditional document.createElement() in IE7. I ran a test to create 1000 <spans> and add them to a <div>, using new Element() takes about 1800ms on IE7 (running on Virtual PC), the traditional method takes about 800ms. My test also revealed an even quicker method, at least for a simple test such as mine: using DocumentFragments as described by John Resig. Running the same test on the same machine with IE7 took 247ms, a 9x improvement from my original method!

There must be a standard solution? Is there a good reason these Flex classes take a Class in the first place? EDIT: I don't actually care about emulating the [Embed] tag's behaviour. I just want to be able to use an image file path with CursorManager. I'm sure I've seen this done in other situations, and surely the Flex people figured these things would not always be hard-coded?

@TITLE:Painting a Canvas in an Applet
@CONTENT:I currently have a small Java program which I would like to run both on the desktop (ie in a JFrame) and in an applet. Currently all of the drawing and logic are handled by a class extending Canvas. This gives me a very nice main method for the Desktop application: public static void main(String[] args) {
    MyCanvas canvas = new MyCanvas();
    JFrame frame = MyCanvas.frameCanvas(canvas);
    frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
    canvas.loop();
}
 Can I do something similar for the applet? Ideally MyCanvas would remain the same for both cases. Not sure if its important but I am drawing using BufferStrategy with setIgnoreRepaint(true). Edit: To clarify, my issue seems to be painting the canvas -- since all the painting is being done from the canvas.loop() call.
@CODE:public static void main(String[] args) {
    MyCanvas canvas = new MyCanvas();
    JFrame frame = MyCanvas.frameCanvas(canvas);
    frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
    canvas.loop();
} setIgnoreRepaint(true) canvas.loop()

@TITLE:How can I replace an image in a WPF grid with another control depending on the source data?
@CONTENT:I have a grid laid out like so; +---------+---------+
|  Image  | Details |
|    is   |  pane   |
|  here   | for data|
|         |  entry  |
+---------+---------+
| ListView here to  |
| select data item  |
| for top two panes |
+---------+---------+
 This all works well, but I would now like to change the image to another set of controls saying 'Sorry, no image available' when the selected item in the listview does not have an image I've tried wrapping the image in a DockPanel and setting a DataTemplate there (so I can use DataTriggers) but IntelliSense says no! The ListView uses DataTriggers to do a similar thing, but as I say I can't get my head round how to do it for a single image that does not seem to have access to a DataTemplate. Simplified XAML is below; <Grid DataContext="{Binding Source={StaticResource MyData}}">
   <!-- row 0 col 0 -->
   <Image x:Name="imgPhoto" Source="{Binding ElementName=MyListViewOfData, Path=SelectedItem.PathToImageOnDisk}" />

   <!-- row 0 col 1 -->
   <StackPanel DataContext="{Binding ElementName=MyListViewOfData, Path=SelectedItem}">
      <TextBox Name="NameTextBox" Text="{Binding Name}" />
      <TextBlock Name="DateCreatedTextBlock" Text="{Binding DateCreated}" />
   </StackPanel>

   <!-- row 1 cols 0,1 -->
   <ListView ItemsSource="{Binding}" ItemTemplate="{StaticResource MyListViewTemplate}" 
IsSynchronizedWithCurrentItem="True" Name="MyListViewOfData" />

</Grid>

When the form is submitted the gridview is validated it is entirely possible that more than one row has an empty textbox. This results in repeating validation messages e.g. Please provide text for 'Name' field Please provide text for 'Name' field Please provide text for 'Name' field Is it possible to consolidate these messages into one message? I know it possible to create a validator by setting up a validator class and inheriting from BaseValidator class which can be used to validate the gridview as a whole. But I put an image against each row when it is invalid so I should imagine I require separate validators on each row.

@TITLE:.NET Generics: Using an Activator created type as a generic shows wrong Type? Need workaround
@CONTENT:This really has my stumped today. I'm sure its simple, but... Here is my sample code: using System;
using System.Collections;

namespace ConsoleApplication1
{
    class Program
    {
    	public ArrayList SomeProp { get; set; }

    	static void Main(string[] args)
    	{
    		// Get the Type of a property by reflection.
    		Type myPropType = typeof(Program).GetProperty("SomeProp").PropertyType;

    		// Create an instance of the determined Type.
    		var x = Activator.CreateInstance(myPropType);

    		// Now try to use that instance, passing to a method that takes a generic.
    		WhatAmI(x);

    		Console.ReadKey();
    	}

    	private static void WhatAmI<T>(T x)
    	{
    		Console.WriteLine("T is: " + typeof(T).FullName);
    		Console.WriteLine("x is: " + x.GetType().FullName);
    	}
    }
}
 The output here is: T is: System.Object
x is: System.Collections.ArrayList
 Basically what is going on here is I have some property on some class. It doesnt really matter what/where that comes from. The important part is that I get the PropertyInfo for that property. From there I create a new instance of its Type with Activator. Now If I pass that created instance to a function that takes a generic parameter, the generic Type always comes across as Object, because Activator.CreateInstance() returns an Object, so "var x" is an Object, not, in this case, an ArrayList. What I need to happen is for the generic type to be the actual type, int his case "ArrayList". I know there is an Activator.CreateInstance() that I can use instead, but I can't use a Type (PropertyInfo.PropertyType) within the angle brackets for that method. I could also just cast the returned object, like: myPropType x = (myPropType)Activator.CreateInstance(myPropType);
 But obviously that doesn't compile... Plus it wouldn't be valid anyway because the cast is compile time, and I don't know the type until runtime, but conceptually its what I need... So I'm stuck with this Type, but I can't figure out how to get it passed over to the WhatAmI() method, and have T be ArrayList, not Object. Ideas?

    		var x = Activator.CreateInstance(myPropType);

    		// Now try to use that instance, passing to a method that takes a generic.

Since the user has to interact with the image directly, I need to be able to convert the PictureBox click coordinates to image coordinates. What I have done so far, is compare the aspect ratio of the PictureBox to the aspect ratio of the image. For example, if the PictureBox is "more widescreen" in relation to the image (see screenshot), it means the PictureBox will stretch the image to its own height and center it horizontally, showing its background color (in this case red) to the left and right of the image. Then I assume the image's displayed height is the same as PictureBox.Height, and work from there. There's a problem, though. As you can see in the screenshot (green annotation mine), the white image being stretched to fit (zoomed) inside the red PictureBox leaves a small margin at the bottom. Click for full-size. This doesn't happen for all PictureBox.Size / Image.Size combinations, though. This leads me to believe there must be a better way to do this. Sure, I'll do that. I just have to adapt the code to remove the context dependency. But the margin at the bottom does not come from my code. It comes from the PictureBox itself. Do me a favor and try the following: Add a PictureBox (PictureBox1) to a Form, dock it to all four sides of the Form. The code should look as follows: Public Class Form1

    Private Sub Form1_Shown(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Me.Shown

        PictureBox1.SizeMode = PictureBoxSizeMode.Zoom

        PictureBox1.BackColor = Color.Red
        PictureBox1.Image = New Bitmap(PictureBox1.Width, PictureBox1.Height)
        Dim g As Graphics = Graphics.FromImage(PictureBox1.Image)

        g.FillRectangle(Brushes.White, 0, 0, PictureBox1.Image.Width, PictureBox1.Image.Height)

    End Sub

End Class
 Run it and resize the Form so that the image is stretched (zoomed) to fill the height of the PictureBox, leaving red bars to the left and right of the white square. Now resize the Form vertically, as slow as you can. You should see a red margin at the bottom every now and then. The same thing happens with the width and a horizontal resize, showing a margin to the right. It's because of this small imperfection that I know the zoom factor cannot be calculated the way I have been doing it; the result would only be an approximate. If after trying this you still think the code is relevant, then I'll gladly post it. Thank you for taking the time to read and respond.
@CODE:Public Class Form1

    Private Sub Form1_Shown(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Me.Shown

        PictureBox1.SizeMode = PictureBoxSizeMode.Zoom

        PictureBox1.BackColor = Color.Red
        PictureBox1.Image = New Bitmap(PictureBox1.Width, PictureBox1.Height)
        Dim g As Graphics = Graphics.FromImage(PictureBox1.Image)

        g.FillRectangle(Brushes.White, 0, 0, PictureBox1.Image.Width, PictureBox1.Image.Height)

    End Sub

@LINK:/questions/419776/modal-operation-using-imessagefilter-and-doevents
@TITLE:Modal operation using IMessageFilter and DoEvents
@CONTENT:This is a Windows Forms application. I have a function which captures some mouse events modally till a condition is met. For example, I would like to wait for the user to select a point in the window's client area (or optionally cancel the operation using the Escape key) before the function returns. I am using the following structure: Application::AddMessageFilter(someFilter);
while(someFilter->HasUserSelectedAPoint_Or_HitEscapeKey()){
    Application::DoEvents();
}
Application::RemoveMessageFilter(someFilter);
 This works quite nicely except for taking up nearly 100% CPU usage when control enters the while loop. I am looking for an alternative similar to what is shown below: Application::AddMessageFilter(someFilter);
while(someFilter->HasUserSelectedAPoint_Or_HitEscapeKey()){
    // Assuming that ManagedGetMessage() below is a blocking
    // call which yields control to the OS
    if(ManagedGetMessage())
        Application::DoEvents();
}
Application::RemoveMessageFilter(someFilter);
 What is the right way to use IMessageFilter and DoEvents? How do I surrender control to the OS till a message is received? Any GetMessage equivalent in the managed world?
@CODE:Application::AddMessageFilter(someFilter);
while(someFilter->HasUserSelectedAPoint_Or_HitEscapeKey()){
    Application::DoEvents();
}
Application::RemoveMessageFilter(someFilter); Application::AddMessageFilter(someFilter);
while(someFilter->HasUserSelectedAPoint_Or_HitEscapeKey()){
    // Assuming that ManagedGetMessage() below is a blocking
    // call which yields control to the OS
    if(ManagedGetMessage())
        Application::DoEvents();
}
Application::RemoveMessageFilter(someFilter); IMessageFilter DoEvents GetMessage

 I would like to nest a span tag within the label content_tag, so that the final output would be along the lines of: <p><label>Name
        <span class="small">Add your name</span>
    </label>
    <input type="text" name="textfield" id="textfield" />
 I am wondering how I go about including the span's content (say a variable such as 'warning') I have tried all sorts, to no avail. The methods call ok (such as f.text_field :name will produce <p><label for="object_name">Name</label></p>
 Have tried this:   def self.create_tagged_field(method_name)
    define_method(method_name) do |label, warning, *args|
      @template.content_tag("p",
        @template.content_tag("label" , 
                              label.to_s.humanize.capitalize+
                              content_tag("span", warning),

MySQL allows zeros in date parts unless the NO_ZEROES_IN_DATE sql mode is enabled, which isn't by default. Is there any reason not to use a date field where if the month and day may be zero, or to split it up to 3 different fields for year, month and day (year(4), tinyint, tinyint)?

@TITLE:XML Serialization empty collections not self closing
@CONTENT:Wondering if anyone can help me with this annoying but trivial (in terms of need) question. I have an object which has inside it a collection of object  public class OuterClass

     public InnerClasses InnerClasses
    {
      get {return innerClasses; }

  public class InnerClasses:List<InnerClass>
  {

  }
  public class <InnerClass>

 basically my problem I'm experiencing is that if I pass it through an xml serializer     var outer = new OuterClass(){Name="Name"}
    var xmlSerializer = new XmlSerializer(GetType());
    var stringBuilder = new StringBuilder();
    var stringWriter = new StringWriter(stringBuilder);    
    xmlSerializer.Serialize(stringWriter, this);
    return stringBuilder.ToString();
 I'm wondering why when I have no inner classes it puts out <OuterClass>
 <Name>Name</Name>
 <InnerClasses ></InnerClasses>
</OuterClass>
 why does it not put InnerClasses as a self closed tag ? I realize the code above will put but I can't put the full actual code listing. (not much use I know) I'm just looking for pointers as to what could cause it. I can't for the life of me work out why it's not doing this by default. Many thanks for any input as to where to look.

 If i change tempObjectVec objects in foo1, will the original objects in ObjectVec change, I say yes since I am passing references, further is this efficient. Can you suggest alternatives.

Unfortunately this date is in m/d/y format, when I would prefer it to be in d/m/y. Subclipse may be using Eclipse for the date formatting, but I don't recall having seen any other instances of m/d/y (other date locations in Eclipse all seem to include the full month name).

@TITLE:Prevent Python subprocess from passing fds on Windows?
@CONTENT:Python's subprocess module by default passes all open file descriptors to any child processes it spawns. This means that if the parent process is listening on a port, and is killed, it cannot restart and begin listening again (even using SO_REUSEADDR) because the child is still in possession of that descriptor. I have no control over the child process. The subprocess POpen constructor does accept a close_fds argument, which would close descriptors on the child, just as I want. However, there is a restriction, only on Windows, that prevents it from being used if stdin/stdout are also overridden, which I need to do. Does anyone know of a work-around for this on Windows?

I have a presenter and when presenter's Load method called I want to test view should load class properties, table fields, data types,set presenter....

 Is there a code smell in this code? How Can I improve or simplify this?

@TITLE:Pointer class assistance
@CONTENT:I'm writing a sparse matrix class in C++ in which every row and column are arrays of linked lists from a class I created (aptly named: LinkedList). I want to write a class that is a "smart" pointer to one cell in this matrix. In that class, let say LIPointer, I will implement a ++ operator function for moving in the linked lists of the matrix. Is there an elegant way of doing this without moving the references of the matrix arrays and sized elements each time I create a linkedlistPointer? I can't use stl::array etc. because I have to build them myself. Here are the declarations: class LinkedItem 
{ 
private:
    int Column, Row;
    double Value;
    LinkedItem* Right;
    LinkedItem* Down;
public:
...
};
 class SparseLinkedMatrix
{
private: //members
    int ColSize;
    int RowSize;
    LinkedItem ** Columns;
    LinkedItem ** Rows;
public: //functions
    SparseLinkedMatrix();
...

};
 class LIPointer;
private:
    LinkedItem * CellPointer;
public:
    LIPointer();
        void operator++();//???
...
};
 Any advice or direction would be appreciated. Update: It needs to run on the whole matrix. That is why I think I need to move (by reference) the arrays and the size of the matrix. The intended effect is that this would from the last cell in the linked list of the first row to the first cell in the second row.

@TITLE:HTTP status 403: Forbidden exception using certificate to authenticate ASP.NET web service
@CONTENT:I posted days ago about access control to web service (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/390853/access-control-to-web-service). In short, I have an ASP.NET web service deployed on //service/webservice and I want my ASP.NET web application (app1) on the //web1 to access the web service with certificate authentication. I keep getting System.Net.WebException: The request failed with HTTP status 403: Forbidden exception. The following is my setup: On certificate export; I exported a server certificate issued to //service from LocalMachine store and saved it as service.cer. I also exported a client certificate issued to //web1 from LocalMachine store and saved it as web1.cer Setup on //service/webservice: On Directory Security, unchecked Anonymous Access and all Authentication Access (Integrated Windows Access, Digest Authentication and Basic Authentication). On Secure communications, checked Required secure channel(SSL), Require 128-bit encyption, Require client certificate, and Enable client certificate mapping. I then mapped web1.cer to an AD account MyDomain/user which has access right to //service/webservice For //service/webservice/WebService.asmx, set <authentication mode="Windows" /> on web.config Setup on //web1/app1 Set <authentication mode="Windows" /> and <identity impersonate="true" /> on web.config In VS2008, I added the web reference to //service/webservice/WebService.asmx and named it WService In //web1/app1/default.aspx.cs, I had this: using System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates;
    using System.Net;
        WService.WebService ws = new WService.WebService();
        ServicePointManager.ServerCertificateValidationCallback = delegate(Object sender1, X509Certificate cert, X509Chain chain, System.Net.Security.SslPolicyErrors errors) { return true; };
//I was a bit confused here on which certificate I should use so I have tried both service.cer and web1.cer but still got the same error
        X509Certificate x509 = X509Certificate.CreateFromCertFile(@"C:\Certificates\service.cer"); 
        ws.ClientCertificates.Add(x509);
        ws.DoSomething();
 I ran WinHttpCertCfg.exe to grant access to both certificates in LocalMachine for ASPNET account I went to https://service/webservice/WebService.asmx and was prompted to provide a client certificate and after that I was through. But if I went to https://web1/app1/default.aspx (which would call the web service) and I would get the HTTP status 403 exception. What did I miss? I would assume the problem is because //web1/app1/default.aspx.cs failed to transmit the certificate across. If that's the problem, how do I do that? I built both the asmx and aspx on VS 2008 and ASP.NET 3.5.
@CODE:<authentication mode="Windows" /> <authentication mode="Windows" /> <identity impersonate="true" /> using System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates;

@LINK:/questions/395973/mysql-schedule-conflicts
@TITLE:MySQL schedule conflicts
@CONTENT:Hey, I stumbled upon this site looking for solutions for event overlaps in mySQL tables. I was SO impressed with the solution (which is helping already) I thought I'd see if I could get some more help... Okay, so Joe want's to swap shifts with someone at work. He has a court date. He goes to the shift swap form and it pull up this week's schedule (or what's left of it). This is done with a DB query. No sweat. He picks a shift. From this point, it gets prickly. So, first, the form passes the shift start and shift end to the script. It runs a query for anyone who has a shift that overlaps this shift. They can't work two shifts at once, so all user IDs from this query are put on a black list. This query looks like: SELECT DISTINCT user_id FROM shifts
WHERE
FROM_UNIXTIME('$swap_shift_start') < shiftend
AND FROM_UNIXTIME('$swap_shift_end') > shiftstart
 Next, we run a query for all shifts that are a) the same length (company policy), and b) don't overlap with any other shifts Joe is working. What I currently have is something like this: SELECT *
FROM shifts
AND shiftstart BETWEEN  FROM_UNIXTIME('$startday') AND FROM_UNIXTIME('$endday')
AND user_id NOT IN ($busy_users) 
AND (TIME_TO_SEC(TIMEDIFF(shiftend,shiftstart)) = '$swap_shift_length')
$conflict_dates
ORDER BY shiftstart, lastname
 Now, you are probably wondering "what is $conflict_dates???" Well, when Joe submits the swap shift, it reloads his shifts for the week in case he decides to check out another shift's potential. So when it does that first query, while the script is looping through and outputting his choices, it is also building a string that looks kind of like: AND NOT(
'joe_shift1_start' < shiftend
AND 'joe_shift1_end' > shiftstart)
AND NOT(
'joe_shift2_start' < shiftend
AND 'joe_shift2_end' > shiftstart)
...etc
 So that the database is getting a pretty long query along the lines of: SELECT *
FROM shifts
AND shiftstart BETWEEN  FROM_UNIXTIME('$startday') AND FROM_UNIXTIME('$endday')
AND user_id NOT IN ('blacklisteduser1', 'blacklisteduser2',...etc) 
AND (TIME_TO_SEC(TIMEDIFF(shiftend,shiftstart)) = '$swap_shift_length')
AND NOT(
'joe_shift1_start' < shiftend
AND 'joe_shift1_end' > shiftstart)
AND NOT(
'joe_shift2_start' < shiftend
AND 'joe_shift2_end' > shiftstart)
AND NOT(
'joe_shift3_start' < shiftend
AND 'joe_shift3_end' > shiftstart)
AND NOT(
'joe_shift4_start' < shiftend
AND 'joe_shift4_end' > shiftstart)
...etc
ORDER BY shiftstart, lastname
 So, my hope is that either SQL has some genius way of dealing with this in a simpler way, or that someone can point out a fantastic logical principal that accounts for the potential conflicts in a much smarter way. (Notice the use of the 'start > end, end < start', before I found that I was using betweens and had to subtract a minute off both ends.) Thanks! A

@TITLE:Java graphic library for multicoloured text
@CONTENT:I would like to know the recommended library or procedure for dealing with multi-coloured text within Java. My current usage of java.awt.Graphics, while function, appears to be a bit more complex than necessary. The main issue involves the frequent change of colour, creating a new java.awt.Colour() object whenever a new colour is needed (and it's usually not one of the predefined values.) I already keep track of the previously used rgb value, but it's possible that the colour can potentially change to unique values for each character I draw: java.awt.Color colorRender = new java.awt.Color(rgb);
g.setColor(colorRender);
 I also ran a profiler on my code, and identified a secondary bottleneck in an extreme case. I suspect that it may be the method used for drawing a single character, but there may be overhead in determining said character: char[] c = new char[1]; // Created once for many uses
/* ... */
g.drawChars(charRender, 0, 1, x, y);
 I have looked at the BufferedImage class - while it's great for pixel-level graphics, it doesn't directly support drawing characters.
@CODE:java.awt.Color colorRender = new java.awt.Color(rgb);
g.setColor(colorRender); char[] c = new char[1]; // Created once for many uses

@LINK:/questions/393366/java-doesnt-seem-to-be-comparing-doubles-right
@TITLE:Java doesn't seem to be comparing Doubles right
@CONTENT:I created a Linked List, with insert, search and remove functions. I also created a iterator for it. Now, suppose I do this: myList<Integer> test = new myList();
test.insert(30);
test.insert(20);
test.insert(10);
myList.iterator it = test.search(20);
if(it.hasNext())
    System.out.println(it.next());
 And voila, it works (it prints the value of the element at the node, in this case 20). Now, if I do this: myList<Double> test = new myList();
test.insert(30.1);
test.insert(20.1);
test.insert(10.1);
myList.iterator it = test.search(20.1);
if(it.hasNext())
    System.out.println(it.next());
 It doesn't, because the iterator is pointing to null. Here is the implementation of the search function: public iterator search(T data)
{
    no<T> temp = first;
    while( (temp != null) && (temp.data != data) )
    	temp = temp.next;
    return (new iterator(temp));
}
 Here's how I know there's something fishy with the comparisons: If I change part of the above code like this: while( (temp != null) && (temp.data != data) )
     System.out.println(temp.data + " " + data);
     temp = temp.next;
 I can see it printing the numbers in the list. It prints, at one point, "20.1 20.1" (for example). So how can I fix this? The function appears to be right, but it just seems as if Java isn't comparing the numbers correctly. EDIT: wth, BigDecimal gave me the same kind of problem too. EDIT 2: equals() worked, didn't realize something else was amiss. Sorry.
@CODE:myList<Integer> test = new myList();
test.insert(30);
test.insert(20);

        End Select

        End Select
    Next
End Sub
 As you can see there is a commented out line where I insert into the changesTable that will put up the query in an input box so I can copy/paste it and look at it. When I uncomment that line everything is fine. If it is commented it generates the first change fine, but then won't change it for the other controls. So if I change field1 and field2 it will insert the field 1 change twice. It is quite confusing and I have NO CLUE as to why this is happening. Also I know I am using the wrong comment syntax but if I use the correct syntax the SO "code color"er doesn't display properly.

I do all my editing in Xcode on the larger monitor, and leave the menu bar, debugging and documentation on the laptop's monitor. The problem is when I disconnect from the second monitor and want to work on code in "laptop" mode. Now, whenever I open a file for editing, it shows up almost entirely off the screen and I have to drag it over to edit it. I understand (sort of) why this is happening, since I last had it open in a different monitor. What I'd like to do is reset the window positions in Xcode so the edit windows show up completely on the laptop monitor. Any ideas on how to do this? I'd even be willing to nuke entries out of the preferences (or set up an applescript to do it) but the xcode plist is inscrutable to me. Thanks!

 As commented in the method. How do I get the name of the button or control that triggered the event. Or I'm handling this the wrong way? I just want to route all click events to that one method and decide what to do from there... Thanks! ;-)

 My query should be something like Select teacher From classes where lower(class) = 'math101'
 Is this the best way to do the comparison? Update I have no control over the database or the data. I am a read only consumer.

@TITLE:Debugging Tools for Windows: Symbol Proxy doesn't proxy
@CONTENT:I'm attempting to set up a symbol proxy using symproxy.dll from Debugging Tools for Windows. When I issue ".reload /f" from the debugger, none of the symbol files can be found. It looks like Symproxy isn't going out to the Microsoft Symbol Server to actually get the symbols. I see nothing in Wireshark, for example. SYMPROXY.DLL is definitely being loaded -- I can see some entries in the Event Log, and http://my-server/symbols/status returns valid-looking information. I've followed the instructions in the documentation as far as I can tell. Why won't symproxy go to Microsoft's site? What am I doing wrong? I need this to work, because the machine on which I'm debugging doesn't have external access. The box on which symproxy is running has Internet access -- I regularly use it for debugging. The symbol path configured in the registry for symproxy looks correct. It doesn't have to go through a proxy to get to the Internet, and I've configured that in the registry as well. When I use !sym noisy on the other box, it contacts symproxy, but simply says "file not found". It's like the symproxy is simply serving the content, rather than doing a lookaside to the MS symbol servers, like it's supposed to.

@TITLE:Javascript multiple rollovers
@CONTENT:I am trying to do a multi rollover with Javascript. I know a lot of people say to use css, but it's going to be done in Javascript this time around. Anyway, I am having much trouble with this rollover hierarchy. I have a button image nav with five buttons. When you mouseover one of the buttons, the button changes color AND a heading appears underneath for that button. The next part is that the user has to hover over the heading, and then ANOTHER image appears with text in it that describes the heading. So, for example, the button might be a red smile, when you rollover it, it becomes a blue smile and then a heading appears underneath that says Happy. Then if you rollover happy, you get an image of text describing what it means to be happy. This is the way the client wants it and the only reason I am using an image of text, is because his text uses a unique font. So, just to show you that I have been trying to code this and not looking for answer without the work, here's my code so far. It kind of works, but it's not great and I'm not so familar with javascript. function rollover()

@TITLE:Correctly incrementing values using Linq to SQL
@CONTENT:I have a MS SQL table that I don't have any control over and I need to write to. This table has a int primary key that isn't automatically incremented. I can't use stored procs and I would like to use Linq to SQL since it makes other processing very easy. My current solution is to read the last value, increment it, try to use it, if I get a clash, increment it again and retry. Something along these lines: var newEntity = new Log()
{
	ID = dc.Logs.Max(l => l.ID) + 1,
	Note = "Test"		
};

dc.Logs.InsertOnSubmit(newEntity);

const int maxRetries = 10;
int retries = 0;

bool success = false;
while (!success && retries < maxRetries)
{				
	try
	{															
		dc.SubmitChanges();
		success = true;
	}
	catch (SqlException)
	{
		retries++;
		newEntity.ID = dc.Logs.Max(l => l.ID);					
	}
}			
if (retries >= maxRetries)
{
	throw new Exception("Bummer...");
}
 Does anyone have a better solution? EDIT: Thanks to Jon, I simplified the max ID calculation. I was still in SQL thinking mode.
@CODE:var newEntity = new Log()
{
	ID = dc.Logs.Max(l => l.ID) + 1,
	Note = "Test"		
};

dc.Logs.InsertOnSubmit(newEntity);

const int maxRetries = 10;
int retries = 0;

bool success = false;
while (!success && retries < maxRetries)
{				
	try
	{															
		dc.SubmitChanges();
		success = true;
	}
	catch (SqlException)
	{
		retries++;
		newEntity.ID = dc.Logs.Max(l => l.ID);					
	}

@TITLE:Why is this property not getting set?
@CONTENT:I'm having trouble trying to set the value of a property after i cast it. I'm not sure if this is called boxing. Anyways, the new variable is getting set, but the original is not. I thought the new variable is just a reference to the original. But when i check the intellisence/debug watcher, the original property is still null. here's the code. // NOTE: data is either a Foo || FooFoo || FooBar, at this point.
//       only Foo impliments ITagElement.
if (data is ITagElement)
{
    var tags = ((ITagElement)data).TagList;
    // At this point, tags == null and data.TagList == null.
    if (tags.IsNullOrEmpty())
    {
        tags = new List<Tag>();
    }

    tags.Add(new Tag
    {
        K = xmlReader.GetAttribute("k"),
         V = xmlReader.GetAttribute("v")
    });

    // At this point, Tags.Count == 1 and data.TagList == null :( :( :(
}
 Notice my inline comments about the values for tags and data.TagList ? Can some explain what I have done wrong? I thought the variable tags is just a reference pointer to the property data.TagList .. but it looks like it's not. Update / Answer :) thanks for the answers guys! it's embarassing cause i've been doing ths stuff for years and still forget/not notice simple things like this. (And of course, makes so much sence now that i see the light). Marc got the points because his answer (IMO) was the simplest for my single blond brain cell. Thanks all!
