@TITLE:Reveal image underneath a mask css/javascript
@CONTENT:I am sure the answer is staring me in the face, but I can't seem to figure this out. Goal: What I am trying to do is animate liquid filling up a cup. This doesn't have to be super realistic. I was thinking that I could have a cup image as one layer, and behind it have the image of liquid and reveal the liquid slowly to give the illusion that it's being filled it up. This will work in conjunction with a preloader (that I have already built). What I have tried: My first thought was to try and use a CSS Mask, so I tinkered with that a little bit. While it does have a wide range of options, you can't just define your image and everything outside of the mask that you've define would show the image behind. Instead, it only shows the places you have cut out in your mask, and everything outside of your mask is white. Using mask-position and mask-repeat: none does not work to try and work around this. What I think could work: Maybe some sort of background positioning that gets animated?? While looking into this, it didn't seem like I was going to be able to make this do what I wanted. I know that this would work in an animation capacity to move the mask layer slowly to give it that illusion of a cup being filled up. My question: How would I reveal parts of an image slowly to give it the illusion that it's slowly filling up a cup by using an image of a cup as a top layer and the liquid as the layer behind with a mask between that gets animated to show the liquid?

 I would like to display user scores like this: if a user on a certain day has more than 3 scores it would get only highest 3, repeat that for every day for this user and then add all days together. I want to display this sum for every user. EDIT: So in the example above for user 1 on 06.12. I would add top 3 scores together and ignore 4th score, then add to that number top 3 from the next day and so on. I need that number for every user. EDIT 2: Expected output is:   userid |   score  
--------------------
    1    |    59    //19 + 16.5 + 7 (06.12.) + 10 + 6.5 (07.12.)

 I hope this is more clear :) I would really appreciate the help because I am stuck.

@TITLE:OAuth 2.0 for desktop and mobile applications
@CONTENT:I'm doing research on OAuth 2.0 protocol. I came stuck in the problem of generating bearer tokens for desktop/mobile applications that don't run on a web server. The OAuth 2.0 protocol flow is clear to me for web applications. Suppose myapp.com wants to access protectedresource.com on behalf of user Alice, then Alice gets redirected to https://protectedresource.com/oauth?redirect_uri=https://myapp.com/oauth&[...] so the resource manager, after obtaining consent, redirects Alice's browser to a page that will collect the authorization code and use it to obtain the bearer token. This works fine and secure because protectedresource.com recognizes myapp.com domain and releases the bearer token only to requests coming from myapp.com If I'm running a desktop application, even with support of a browser (ie embed an HTML viewer in a Windows Form or something like that) where am I supposed to redirect Alice after consent?? Who collects the authorization code? How does the control flow change? Does anybody have examples of OAuth 2.0 implementations running on desktop or Android?

@TITLE:rails assets:precompile during slug for s3 error: Fog provider and directory can't be blank when env are set
@CONTENT:I decided to serve rails assets via S3; heroku has great tutorials on how to do this. The site is now serving assets from my amazon bucket but I'm unsure why I had to manually run heroku run rake assets:precompile after a git push heroku master which runs a rake assets:precompile. After running the git push heroku master the assets where not in my bucket and the output for the precompile stuff was: AssetSync: using default configuration from built-in initializer

 I did set the fog provider and directory with: heroku config:add FOG_DIRECTORY=XXX FOD_PROVIDER=AWS and calling heroku config --app confirms this...so I don't get those errors. The assets didn't show up in my bucket so I ran: heroku run rake assets:precompile and everything worked with a warning: AssetSync: using default configuration from built-in initializer
AssetSync: Syncing.
[WARNING] fog: the specified s3 bucket name(ss_assets) is not a valid dns name, which will negatively impact performance.  For details see: http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Bucket
Restrictions.html
 Will I always have to run the precompile task after and just be okay with the push failure? I'll check to see if the Warning of the directory name is causing the blank FOG errors on push EDIT Again asset_sync doesn't appear to have ENV variables when called in the assets:precompile task of the heroku push. Running that task after push works but it 'annoying'. Still not working for me, latest attempt was (per asset_sync github project): lib/tasks/asset_sync.rake. Rake::Task['assets:precompile'].enhance do
  AssetSync.sync
end

Rake::Task["assets:precompile:nondigest"].enhance do
  AssetSync.sync
end
 I also attempted adding lines to my production.rb file such as:   config.asset_sync.aws_bucket = ENV['FOG_DIRECTORY']
  config.asset_sync.fog_provider = ENV['FOG_PROVIDER']
 Didn't work for me either.

@LINK:/questions/13733148/surpassing-mysqls-time-value-limit-of-8385959
@TITLE:Surpassing MySQL's TIME value limit of 838:59:59
@CONTENT:The title might be a bit confusing so allow me to explain. I'm using a table to record my work logs. Every day I'll create an entry stating from what time to what time I have worked and I'll add a comment describing what I did. I then use a query to compare the timestamps to figure out exactly how many hours and minutes I have worked that day. Additionally, I use a query to calculate the sum of hours and minutes I have worked the entire year. That's where I'm running into a problem. My query is as follows. SELECT TIME_FORMAT(SEC_TO_TIME(SUM(TIME_TO_SEC(TIMEDIFF(entry_end_time, entry_start_time)))), '%H:%i') 
AS total FROM entry 
WHERE entry_date BETWEEN '2012-01-01' AND '2012-12-31' AND user_id = 3
 By default, MySQL TIME fields allow a time range of '-838:59:59' to '838:59:59'. I have currently logged more than 900 hours of work this year though, and I want the result of my query to reflect this. Instead, the result is 838:59:59, which makes sense because that is the limit. Is there any way around this so the result of the query can go beyond 839 hours, or would I have to use something like PHP to go over the entire table and add it all up? I kind of want to avoid that if possible.

@LINK:/questions/13694239/how-to-track-login-attempts-using-httpsession-in-java
@TITLE:How to track login attempts using HttpSession in Java?
@CONTENT:I have a no-framework web application. I need to implement a simple way to check unsuccessful logins, using sessions. If the user attempts to log in 3 times using incorrect username/password combination, they will be given a 20 minute timeout before they can try logging in again. Currently I only set a user session if the user successfully logs in to the system. However, it seems that I should get a session in case of unsuccessful login also, and count the login attempts somehow. Login.jsp (simplified version): <form name="loginForm" method="post" action="CustomerData">
User name:<input type="text" name="userName"/>
Password:<input type="password" name="password"/>
<input type="button" value="submit">
 CustomerData.java (simplified version): // See if customer is a valid user
        String selectQuery = "Select firstName,lastName,email from customer where userName='"+userName+"' and password='"+password+"'";
        selectResult = statement.executeQuery(selectQuery);

if(selectResult.next())
{
    // We got a valid user, let's log them in
    ....
    HttpSession session = request.getSession(true);
    session.setAttribute("customer", customer);
}
else
{
    // this is where I need to get the session id (??),
    // count the unsuccessful login attempts somehow, 
    //and give them a 20 minutes timeout before they can try logging in again.

    request.setAttribute("message","Invalid username or password. Please try again!");

}
 While doing research, I found that there are a lot of built-in security features for various Java frameworks. I also found that using sessions is not the best way to track login attempts, because the user can log-in with different browsers. However, I'm creating this functionality for a simple web project that will never go to any production environment. I would like to know how to implement this functionality using the Java HTTPSession Object. Ok, here is my full solution, based on the feedback I received. I'm posting this in case it might help others with similar issues: // See if customer is a valid user
String selectQuery = "Select firstName,lastName,email from customer where userName='"+userName+"' and password='"+password+"'";

@LINK:/questions/13684354/validating-a-view-model-after-custom-model-binding
@TITLE:Validating a view model after custom model binding
@CONTENT:I have a view model that implements IValidatableObject that contains a string and a collection of another view model, something like this: public sealed class MainViewModel
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public ICollection<OtherViewModel> Others { get; set; }
}
 My validation checks each object in Others against different rules using the contract provided by IValidatableObject: public IEnumerable<ValidationResult> Validate(ValidationContext validationContext)
{
    foreach (var other in this.Others)
    {
        // validate or yield return new ValidationResult
    }
}
 Because of the complex structure of the real MainViewModel I have had to create a custom model binder which re-builds the model and assigns POST data to the relevant components. The problem that I'm getting is that nothing is getting validated resulting in validation errors at the context level as it violates certain database constraints and I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong - I assumed that ModelState.IsValid would invoke the Validate method on my view model but it doesn't seem to go down that way. My model binder looks like this: public object BindModel(ControllerContext controllerContext, ModelBindingContext bindingContext)
{
    int modelId = (int)controllerContext.RouteData.Values["id"];

    // query the database and re-build the components of the view model

    // iterate the POST data and assign to the model where necessary

    // should I be calling something here to validate the model before it's passed to the controller?

    return model;
}
 Any help appreciated! Validator.TryValidateObject OK, seems I'm a little closer. I can now get my IValidatableObject method to run by adding the following to my custom model binder: var validationResults = new HashSet<ValidationResult>();
var isValid = Validator.TryValidateObject(model, new ValidationContext(model, null, null), validationResults, true);
 Seems that Validator.TryValidateObject invokes the validation method and setting the last parameter to true causes it to validate all properties. However, I'm now stuck with getting the validationResults to the controller so they can be used in a meaningful way.
@CODE:IValidatableObject public sealed class MainViewModel
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public ICollection<OtherViewModel> Others { get; set; }
} Others IValidatableObject public IEnumerable<ValidationResult> Validate(ValidationContext validationContext)
{
    foreach (var other in this.Others)
    {
        // validate or yield return new ValidationResult
    }
} MainViewModel ModelState.IsValid Validate public object BindModel(ControllerContext controllerContext, ModelBindingContext bindingContext)
{
    int modelId = (int)controllerContext.RouteData.Values["id"];

    // query the database and re-build the components of the view model

    // iterate the POST data and assign to the model where necessary

    // should I be calling something here to validate the model before it's passed to the controller?

    return model;
} IValidatableObject var validationResults = new HashSet<ValidationResult>();
var isValid = Validator.TryValidateObject(model, new ValidationContext(model, null, null), validationResults, true); Validator.TryValidateObject true validationResults

                       (CGFloat)1.0f, (CGFloat)1.0f);

    [self.popover presentPopoverFromRect:popoverAnchor
                                  inView:self.view

                                animated:YES];
}
 My problem The y-position of the popover view controller is incorrect, it is different for each bar and for the first bar, which has a negative y-value, it is presented at the upper limit of the bar instead the lower limit and hides the bar. The x-position seems to be correct. Please help Any ideas on why my code does not work as expected? Thank you! Edit Based on Eric's answer I have updated my code as follows: - (void)barPlot:(CPTBarPlot *)plot barWasSelectedAtRecordIndex:(NSUInteger)idx {

    NSNumber *plotXvalue = [self numberForPlot:plot
                                         field:CPTScatterPlotFieldX
                                   recordIndex:idx];
    NSNumber *plotYvalue = [self numberForPlot:plot
                                         field:CPTScatterPlotFieldY
                                   recordIndex:idx];

    CPTXYPlotSpace *plotSpace = (CPTXYPlotSpace *)graph.defaultPlotSpace;

    CGPoint cgPlotPoint =
        CGPointMake(plotXvalue.floatValue,
                    plotYvalue.floatValue);
    CGPoint cgPlotAreaPoint =
        [graph convertPoint:cgPlotPoint toLayer:graph.plotAreaFrame.plotArea];

    NSDecimal plotAreaPoint[2];
    plotAreaPoint[CPTCoordinateX] =
        CPTDecimalFromFloat(cgPlotAreaPoint.x);
    plotAreaPoint[CPTCoordinateY] =
        CPTDecimalFromFloat(cgPlotAreaPoint.y);

    CGPoint dataPoint = [plotSpace


           plotAreaViewPointForPlotPoint:plotAreaPoint];
        NSLog(@"datapoint (CGPoint) coordinates tapped: %@",NSStringFromCGPoint(dataPoint));

GrowthChartInfoTableViewController *infoViewController = [self.storyboard 
   instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@"GrowthChartInfo"];



    self.popover = nil;
        self.popover = [[UIPopoverController alloc]


      initWithContentViewController:infoViewController];
    self.popover.popoverContentSize = CGSizeMake(250, 200);
    self.popover.delegate = self;
    CGRect popoverAnchor =
        CGRectMake(dataPoint.x + graph.paddingLeft,
                   dataPoint.y - graph.paddingTop + graph.paddingBottom,
                   (CGFloat)1.0f, (CGFloat)1.0f);

    [self.popover presentPopoverFromRect:popoverAnchor
        inView:self.view
        permittedArrowDirections:UIPopoverArrowDirectionUp
        animated:YES];
}
 However, the results I am getting are more erroneous than before. I believe I must have misunderstand something. Here are some of the results of the NSLog commands: barWasSelectedAtRecordIndex x: 0, y: -0.03920931548773198848
datapoint (CGPoint) coordinates tapped: {-6388.88, -67024.8}

barWasSelectedAtRecordIndex x: 2, y: 0.174494288286651392
datapoint (CGPoint) coordinates tapped: {-6073.38, -66790}

barWasSelectedAtRecordIndex x: 2, y: 0.174494288286651392
datapoint (CGPoint) coordinates tapped: {-6073.38, -66790}

datapoint (CGPoint) coordinates tapped: {-6388.88, -67024.8}
 It seems that the conversion from the bar coordinates to the view coordinates is completely wrong in my code. Edit 2 Thank you again for your code sample, Eric! I have updated my code and tested it with the following options (y-value = 0: plotPoint[CPTCoordinateY] = CPTDecimalFromFloat(0.0f), which results in an anchor point for the popover whose y-value seems to be incorrect (please refer to the following screenshot). The anchor point's y-value should be equivalent to the position of 0 on the y-axis. Then I tried to set the y-value of the anchor point to the current y-value of the data. (plotPoint[CPTCoordinateY] = plotYvalue.decimalValue). This results in an anchor point which is close to the y-axis's 0 value instead of being close to the top of the bar. However, the y-value changes a little bit for each company (x-value) indicating that there might be a problem with the shift of the y-values: I also tried the additional conversion which Eric suggested dataPoint = [self.view convertPoint:dataPoint fromView:graph.hostingView], but this did not change the results. In addition, I tried to add - graph.paddingTop + graph.paddingBottom to the final y-values, without success. I would appreciate any ideas on what my error might be. Thank you!

@TITLE:How do you keep changes separate and isolated across multiple deployment environments in git?
@CONTENT:At my workplace, we are attempting to design a workflow based around Git to handle our deployments and changes to the code. We have a Java EE web application and 3 deployment environments (Test, QA and Production). We also have an instance of Jenkins CI to handle builds and deployments. When changes are made to the application's code (in branches) we need to be able to pick and choose which ones get promoted to QA and Production. Some might get to QA and then never go to production. We also need to be immune to accidentally including everyone else's code in your branch when promoting and merging. The "promotion" of branches needs to also be automated - in such a way that an analyst would select the branch or changeset and then jenkins or some other script would do the actual merging and deployment. I see merge conflicts being an issue here... How would you recommend setting up (a) Git repository(ies) to handle these requirements?

@TITLE:dart: debugging client/server communication for dart client and existing rest api?
@CONTENT:I have a rest api (developed in django/python) which i run locally and want to develop a simple client application in dart. This client uses XMLHttpRequest to communicate to a local django development server. The problem is the default run configuration in the Dart Editor launches it's own web server and than either dartium or the system browser with dart2js. Which will both obviously violate the cross origin policy when i try to access my rest api. I'm wondering what the best setup would be to test client/server communication - should i configure my rest api to proxy the :3030 port which is used by the dart editor and configure a launch configuration with a URL, or is there a way to tell the dart editor server to send a "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" http header (this would be really cool), or some chrome launch parameter to disable cross origin checking for XMLHttpRequests? seems like an obviously stupid problem, but i haven't found any solutions described in the (dart) documentation, or in previous questions here.

@TITLE:Run jquery at the end of Ember.CollectionView rendering
@CONTENT:I have a ContainerView which contains a CollectionView. After this CollectionView renders on the screen I need to perform a jquery function which essentially looks through the content of the rendered template and performs some display modifications. If I perform that jquery within the didInsertElement of CollectionView it works but it gets executed for every single element in the CollectionView where as I really just need it to be done once at the end. How do I specify that? http://jsfiddle.net/JFqNr/ (note doesn't render on jsfiddle or some reason but just to show you structure) App = Ember.Application.create();

App.FooContainerView = Ember.ContainerView.extend({

@TITLE:Utility class that re-throws a throwable as unchecked?
@CONTENT:I am catching all throwables in a unit test wrapper method in order to reset some data in an external system. I want to re-throw the original exception when this is done and I am using this piece of code to do it: if (t instanceof RuntimeException) {
    throw (RuntimeException) t;
} else if (t instanceof Error) {
    throw (Error) t;
} else {
    throw new RuntimeException(t);
}
 However, is there any existing utility call that does this already? (I am catching throwables because AssertionErrors are Errors.) Edit: To be honest, I don't really want to wrap the exception, so any trick that would allow me to throw any throwable (including checked exceptions) without declaring throws is acceptable.

@CONTENT:I have taken over an application written by another developer, which reads data from a database, and exports it. The developer used DataTables and DataAdaptors. So,  _dataAdapter = new SqlDataAdapter("Select * From C....", myConnection);
 and then ExtractedData = new DataTable("CreditCards");
_dataAdapter.Fill(ExtractedData);
 ExtractedData is then passed around to do different functions. I have now been told that I need to, in addition to this, get the same format of data from some comma separated text files. The application does the same processing - it's just getting the data from two sources. So, I am wondering if I can get the data read into a DataTable, as above, and then ADD more records from a CSV file. Is this possible?

@TITLE:How to get HTTPS content using Python Requests through TOR and Privoxy
@CONTENT:I have TOR setup on my system with Privoxy that has been tested and works well. What I am trying to do is proxy HTTPS requests through this setup, so that these GET and POSTs come through TOR. Below is the simplest version of the code I could produce: import requests
proxy = { 'http':'127.0.0.1:8118','https':'127.0.0.1:8118' }
r = requests.get('https://www.whatismyip.com/',proxies=proxy)
#r = requests.get('http://www.whatsmyip.org/')
print r
 When using HTTPS, I do not get the response body (r.content is blank), but I do get a 200 status code and I can see the request go out in the Privoxy logs. I saw a bug on this thread, but it appears that was solved in the Requests library months ago with this. My privoxy setup is the basic one and setup to listen on the localhost with the addition of the following two lines: forward-socks4a / localhost:9050 .
forward-socks5 / localhost:9050 .
 At this point I am not sure what's going on, but nothing I do seems to work. I am on Python 2.6.5 with the latest requests library and urllib3.
@CODE:import requests
proxy = { 'http':'127.0.0.1:8118','https':'127.0.0.1:8118' }
r = requests.get('https://www.whatismyip.com/',proxies=proxy)

@TITLE:Use GIT fork / branches
@CONTENT:I am using Git for a while but i still have trouble understanding some features despite hours spent on blogs and tutorials... :) I am working on a project with other people for which my boss created a repo on bitBucket. I cloned it locally, and already did some commits to the master branch, and pulled some changes by others. I now want to do modifications on the long term. I will have to push some of them to the master branch, and keep other ones just for myself. I think that i could fork the master branch to have my own version(?). I am a bit confused about what procedure i should follow. Should I create my own branch? or fork ? If I'm right, forking will create another version located in myy BitBucket account that I should copy on my computer (in a different directory from the master branch project?) in order to do modifications. On the other hand, it seems to me that a great feature of GIT is to work locally in a single directory with all different existing branches, switching from one to another, and pushing your modifications on your remote repo when you're done (and potentially to the master branch). Before deciding, I have a few questions for you guys: Question 1: If I modify files in my forked version, will I be able to push them to the master branch? how? Question 2: How do I incorporate new commits (on the master branch) from other users into my forked version? Question 4: Has the remote repo of my forked version anything to do with the master repo? Question 5: Will my forked version contents be visible by others members of the team? I'd appreciate A LOT if anyone could clarify this for me! Thank you.

@CONTENT:I've created an application with serial views (A,B,C,D,...), and I need to pop back D to B. Someone may say Why not using: [self.navigationController popToViewController:[[self.navigationController viewControllers] objectAtIndex:1] animated:YES];
 However, it is not a good solution. Because this method needs you to get the index which our "B" is store in. Question: How to get the index of "B" in the viewControllers? format in the UIViewControllers should be: "< A: 0x6e70710 >", "< C: 0x6e30370 >", "< B: 0x6988a70 >", "< D: 0x6ea8950 >", "< E: 0x6eaaad0 >" I've tried and failed to use rangeOfString and hasPrefix to get the "B" view's index.

@CONTENT:I'm on creating a maven based java project, which contains the PMD maven plugin. I use my own rule set XML and it works like a charm, except two rule sets: the emptycode and the unnecessary: when I run the build, maven says: "can't find resource". The role definitions look like: <role ref="rulesets/emptycode" />
 and <role ref="rulesets/unnecessary" />
 In every other cases, this kind of definition works. What I found out is that: there is a rule set with the name "unnecessary" under ecmasrcipt category, so maybe this definition needs some suggestion to use java version. I tried multiple thinks, like set language attribute to the ruleset xml node ("JAVA", based on PMD JavaDoc), and some pre-postfix in ref, but it doesn't work and I found no working solution over the web. Does someone has an idea, what I forgot to set, or what I fail? Thanks for any help!

@TITLE:Mongoose - Same schema for different collections in (MongoDB)
@CONTENT:I'm creating an application (Express+MongoDB+Mongoose) where documents are naturally clustered by groups. Every query to the database will only need to access documents from a single group. So I'm thinking it's a good idea to separate each group into its own collection for the sake of performance. Now, I'm going to use the same Schema for each of these collections because they will store the same type of documents. I used to have a single Model object because I used to have everything in a single collection but now I need multiple Models, one per group. Is it a good idea to create a new Model object on every request (using a shared Schema) or is this too expensive? What would be a good architectural decision in this case? The best approach I could think of is to create a Model the first time there's a request for a collection and then cache the Models in a dictionary for quick access. I guess the best approach depends on the cost of creating a new Model object on each request. Thanks!

@TITLE:AngularJS $http HTML Parser
@CONTENT:All, we're developing a webapp with AngularJS and we have a use case/requirement (that won't happen very often at all) where we will need to retrieve a complete HTML document from our static server. However, it appears that the $http object returns a raw HTML string as its 'data'. We are trying to avoid using an external library (like jQuery, for instance), but we need to parse that raw HTML string into a queriable DOM object. We could use an iframe and be done with it, but we're also trying to avoid using iframes for well-known reasons. So, the question is: does AngularJS have a parser for HTML (as it does for JSON)? Or else, what's the most graceful way to handle this case? P.S.: We tried sifting through Angular's API docs, but in all honesty they are hit-or-miss and unintuitive to navigate around.

@LINK:/questions/13129538/high-resolution-timer-in-java
@TITLE:high resolution timer in java
@CONTENT:I want to simulate TCP in Java. For that I have multiple threads, like sender and receiver threads for every TCP connection. My problem is, I want to pause (like Thread.sleep()) threads for microseconds time interval. So that I can simulate flow control, where sender thread will block for microseconds before sending next packet, and at same time CPU can be used by receiving and data processing threads. But I couldn't find any methods which perform sleep() or wait() for microsecond or nanosecond resolution. How can I block (pause) threads in Java with micro or nanosecond resolution? I found System.nanoTime() method, but there no methods for blocking threads for specified micro or nano seconds. If there any such methods, then please let me know. System.nanoTime() just gives relative time interval in nanoseconds. I can use System.nanoTime() to perform nanosecond delay in threads using busy-loop, but that will waste CPU, which could have been used for receiving data thread or processing thread. Another confusing question: By surfing internet, I found Thread.sleep() or wait() methods blocks for at least specified milliseconds or in multiple of 10ms, whichever is less, without thread interrupt, in Windows System. But when I run sample examples, I found very different results. Like threads are sleeping less than specified milliseconds. Some threads are giving me 100 microsecond sleep. Is it error in time measured? Is not System.nanoTime() that much accurate? See below example where I am getting very different results. Thread priorities are also not giving predicted results. public class MyClass {
    public static void main(String args []){
        Runnable r = new Runnable() {
            public void run() {

@TITLE:Boost property_tree: multiple values per key
@CONTENT:Boost property tree seems like an excellent library to use for parsing config files. However, I can't figure out how to handle situations where there are multiple values per key. For example, let's say I was specifying a box like this: box
{
    x -1 1
    y -1 1
    z -1 1
}
 where x, y, and z are the bounds of the box on the x, y, and z axes respectively, specified using property_tree's INFO format. I see mention in the manual of using quotes for values that use spaces, but then I don't see that I could import those values as numbers. I'd have to parse the string into numbers, which seems to defeat the purpose of using property_tree in the first place. I could certainly give each number a key: box 
{
    xlo -1
    xhi 1
    ylo -1
    yhi 1
    zlo -1
    zhi 1
}    
 but that seems cumbersome, and will inflate my config file. I also noted that I could handle this situation in program_options, but I lose the nested config file capabilities (yeah, I know I can use dot notation to "nest", but it's not the same). Is there a way to import e.g. x as a list of numbers like this?
@CODE:box
{
    x -1 1
    y -1 1
    z -1 1
} x y z x y z box 
{
    xlo -1
    xhi 1

 I know that the function defined here as scan is faster than scanf and is very useful on programming competitions. But for some reason this code is not working on windows and is working on linux. What do I do to get it working on windows. I am using the g++ compiler of dev-c++.

@LINK:/questions/13001363/using-mediaplayer-to-play-the-same-file-multiple-times-with-overlap
@TITLE:Using MediaPlayer to play the same file multiple times with overlap
@CONTENT:What's currently happening with my android application: I mapped a simple image to a button and have it play a sound on click. On each click, I create a MediaPlayer object with a sound file in my raw folder, I set an OnClickListener for that MediaPlayer object which stops playing the file and releases it, and then I play the MediaPlayer object. The code for the defined section: public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.main_activity);
    ImageButton start = (ImageButton) findViewById(R.id.imageButton1);
    start.setOnClickListener(new OnClickListener() {

        public void onClick(View v) {
            MediaPlayer play = MediaPlayer.create(MainActivity.this, R.raw.dvno);
            play.setOnCompletionListener(new OnCompletionListener() {
                public void onCompletion(MediaPlayer mp) {
                    mp.stop();
                    mp.release();
                    mp = null;
                }
            });
            play.start();
        }
    });
}
 What's wrong with it: It works fine and does not crash, but it's terrible for memory and very slow in general. I'd like for users to click the button many times in a row, as fast as they possibly can, and hear the sound play instantaneously over and over with overlap. Creating a new MediaPlayer object on each click and waiting for it to finish and be released consumes too many resources and the sound often lags behind the actual press of the button. I'd like to be able to create a single sound as MediaPlayer object which can be played while overlapping on itself. Possible Solution: Create a single final MediaPlayer object in the scope of onCreate rather than onClick and somehow use threading to start the MediaPlayer object on every click. I read that this might be a possible solution, but I haven't ever used threads before and I don't know if they're slow, if not slower, than my current code, so I'd like to know if there's a solution without using threads that might be simpler. Manipulating the state of a single MediaPlayer to overlap on itself seems impossible at this point, but maybe I'm wrong. Would this crash the program because of illegal states? If not, is this going to be slower than I want it to be? And if not, can anyone suggest a fix to my code?
@CODE:public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.main_activity);
    ImageButton start = (ImageButton) findViewById(R.id.imageButton1);
    start.setOnClickListener(new OnClickListener() {

        public void onClick(View v) {
            MediaPlayer play = MediaPlayer.create(MainActivity.this, R.raw.dvno);
            play.setOnCompletionListener(new OnCompletionListener() {
                public void onCompletion(MediaPlayer mp) {
                    mp.stop();
                    mp.release();
                    mp = null;
                }
            });
            play.start();
        }
    });

@TITLE:How to route the splitted packets using netfilter hooks in kernel space
@CONTENT:I have to split large packets into smaller ones in PRE_ROUTING hook. I have done the necessary steps for splitting a packet into smaller ones, creating skb, setting ip and udp header etc, etc. But what I am not understanding is how to route the packets? I can append data in packets now (that can be seen in my previous question: How to append data on a packet from kernel space?). But now I am stuck with routing splitted packets. Thanks in advance. I am giving my codes (so far I can write) below. Let us imagine the module runs on the server machine. The server runs on port 6000. The client then sends a message "ThisIsUsedForTesting". According to the code, the server should get "ThisI": a smaller packet. I am not concerning with the second packet right now. I can easily mangle packet size. But now there can be two or more packets. After running this module, the server gets the message: "ThisI". But when echoing it back, the packet does not go out of the box. I write the module for PRE_ROUTING, and the machine should oops right then, but the server process gets the message, and the machine then oops. I do not understand these scenario. Any help/suggestion is welcome. If I can manage the first splitted packet, I think, the rest can be handled automatically, so the code for them is not given here:     #include <linux/kernel.h>

That's exactly what I need to count resulted elements for the specific query until it's over defined limit like 1000, but I do not see any way to do it in c# driver. Count of IMongoCollection and SetCount of IMongoCursor are both parameter-less. Any idea?

@CONTENT:Finally I created a stream video recorder flash application and its simple Red5 backend but of course Red5 jokes me again. Most of the times the recorded videos are corrupted, cannot play them back without randomly stopping-resuming, hanging out the player .. and me as well. Why is it doing this? I researched the internet and found this issue but no solution! I tried not to record the video instead switch it to live and attach an ffmpeg to do the dirty job but naturally the ffmpeg couldn't connect with the following error message on the red5's output: Error executing call: Service: null Method: play Num Params: 1 0: my_little_stream ... blabla bla Before I try out integrating the Xuggler stuff what I truly don't want to I ask you, what to do, can I attach the ffmpeg somehow or is there a configuration in the red5 server I should change.. or anything! Thanks! Edit: I'm using Red5 1.0 RC2 Edit#2: I compiled the oflaDemo app from trunk sources with red5 1.0.0rc2 server files then created a live stream with a simple flex app just to try out if ffmpeg recorder worked. Now it could connect to red5 but the result is the same! The videos seems to be corrupt...

@LINK:/questions/12843675/where-to-put-returns-around-callbacks-with-node-js
@TITLE:Where to put returns around callbacks with node.js
@CONTENT:A little background; I work with node.js, and have found that many bugs are avoided by returning all callbacks in asynchronous code. For example: function useMyAsyncFunc(stuff, c, callback)
    myAsyncFunc(stuff.a, stuff.b, c, function (error, data) {
        if (error) {
            return callback(error);
        }

        // Long body of code in here.

        return callback(null, data);
    });
}
 My question is, would it be better to do the above, considering that the chain of callbacks could be quite large, or would function useMyAsyncFunc(stuff, c, callback)
    myAsyncFunc(stuff.a, stuff.b, c, function (error, data) {
        if (error) {
           callback(error);
           return;
        }

        // Long body of code in here.

        callback(null, data);
        return;
    });
}

@TITLE:mclapply vs for loops for plotting: speed and scalability focus
@CONTENT:I am running a function in R that can take a long time to run as it carries out multiple commands to transform and subset some data before it pushes it into ggplot to plot. I need to run this function multiple times adjusting the arguments values. The example I will provide is a simple one...but was wondering how to speed it up? if scaled up, i.e. what is the fastest way of getting every single combination...is there a generic method of converting for loops into mclapply assuming they are faster...please feel free to provide alternative mock examples that demonstrate a preference for a particular method mock example: the basic function: ff <- function(n, mu, stdev){
     x1 <- c(1:n)
     y1 <- rnorm(n,mu,stdev)
     z1 <- data.frame(cbind(x1,y1))
     ggplot(z1, aes(x=x1,y=y1))+
       geom_point()+
       labs(title=paste("n=",n,"mu=",mu, "stdev=",stdev))
}
 so the nieve way of going through parameters would be to do the following... for(i in 1:10){
    for(j in 1:2){
       for(k in seq(100,500,by=100)){
         ff(k,i,j)
       }
    }
}
 what would be the fastest way of speeding this up? I'm assuming it might need something like expand.grid(x=c(1:10),y=c(1:2),z=seq(100,500,by=100)) and the using mclapply to run through each row...in some sort of parallel manner? (I have 4 cores available for this). Please feel free to pull bits out of the basic function or put things into the basic function according to the methods that would create the greatest improvement in speed. The process will obviously take longer if you increase the range for each parameter, but is there nothing that can be done about that...or can that be changed somehow too if split across more cores or something...? and for bonus points...is there anything that will save the output images and create sliders like in the package manipulate to go through all the parameters in an interactive manner...in which all it is doing is pulling out the relevant image, rather than recalculating it each time. N.B. Please feel free to use/suggest any other packages (like foreach) that you think might be useful for your solution
@CODE:ggplot for mclapply ff <- function(n, mu, stdev){
     x1 <- c(1:n)
     y1 <- rnorm(n,mu,stdev)
     z1 <- data.frame(cbind(x1,y1))
     ggplot(z1, aes(x=x1,y=y1))+
       geom_point()+
       labs(title=paste("n=",n,"mu=",mu, "stdev=",stdev))
} for(i in 1:10){
    for(j in 1:2){
       for(k in seq(100,500,by=100)){
         ff(k,i,j)
       }
    }

@TITLE:Typescript AMD Modules in Visual Studio
@CONTENT:I am starting with TypeScript using Visual Studio 2012 Ultimate. I have changed my MSBuild including the --module amd tag in the compiler command. The compiler started to generate AMD modules. I have include in my project RequireJS from Nuget Packages and include in my main HTML this line: <script type="text/javascript" data-main="scripts/SiteMaster"  src="scripts/require.min.js"></script>
 I have two Modules SiteMaster and Authenticate. The module SiteMaster is simple: export module SiteMaster {
    import auth = module("Authenticate");
    auth.Authenticate.run();
}
 It just imports the Authenticate module and calls the function run(). The js for SiteMaster is like this: define(["require", "exports"], function(require, exports) {
(function (SiteMaster) {
    var auth = __auth__;

    auth.Authenticate.run();
})(exports.SiteMaster || (exports.SiteMaster = {}));
 }) The problem is that when I browse the solution I receive the error: Microsoft JScript runtime error: '__auth__' is undefined
 How can I solve this problem ??? Thanks in advance.

 My question is: (Please look at the code) When I am calling unzipEntry(), when it encounters a sub-folder, it passes something like "/data/abc.ext", but my file system does not contain any folder named as "data", I even tried to create it, but failed in doing so. So how to create sub-folders from zipped file to destination path?? I have even tried method: if(entry.isDirectory) {
// create directory
}
 But this doesn't get called, since unzipEntry() (Please look in for() loop) directly passes the file under sub-folder. Please help me on this. Thank you.

@TITLE:Delphi Indy Ping Error 10040
@CONTENT:I have a small piece of code that checks if a computer is alive by pinging it. We use to have a room with 40 computer and I wanna check remotely through my program which on is alive. Therefore I wrote a little ping function using indy function TMainForm.Ping(const AHost : string) : Boolean;
var
  MyIdIcmpClient : TIdIcmpClient;
begin
  Result := True;

  MyIdIcmpClient := TIdIcmpClient.Create(nil);
  MyIdIcmpClient.ReceiveTimeout := 200;
  MyIdIcmpClient.Host := AHost;

  try
    MyIdIcmpClient.Ping;
    Application.ProcessMessages;
  except
    Result := False;
    MyIdIcmpClient.Free;
    Exit;
  end;
  if MyIdIcmpClient.ReplyStatus.ReplyStatusType <> rsEcho Then result := False;

  MyIdIcmpClient.Free;
end;
 So I've developped that at home on my wifi network and everthing just work fine. When I get back to work I tested and I get an error saying Socket Errod # 10040 Message too long
 At work we have fixed IPs and all the computer and I are in the same subnet. I tried to disconnect from the fixed IP and connect to the wifi which of course is DHCP and not in the same subnet, and it is just working fine. I have tried searching the internet for this error and how to solve it but didn't find much info. Of course I have tried to change the default buffer size to a larger value but it didn't change anything I still get the error on the fixed IP within same subnet. Moreover, I don't know if this can help finding a solution, but my code treats exceptions, but in that case it takes about 3-4 seconds to raise the error whereas the Timeout is set to 200 milliseconds. And I cannot wait that long over each ping. By the way I use delphi 2010 and I think it is indy 10. I also have tested on XE2 but same error. Any idea ----- EDIT ----- This question is answered, now I try to have this running in multithread and I have asked another question for that Delphi (XE2) Indy (10) Multithread Ping
@CODE:function TMainForm.Ping(const AHost : string) : Boolean;
var
  MyIdIcmpClient : TIdIcmpClient;

@TITLE:Symbol Visibility in Windows
@CONTENT:I do a lot of programming in linux and I use the visibility attribute to define if a symbol is visible or hidden in the Shared Object. Just to make the things clearer possible: If a symbol is visible it will be accessible externally (someone linking with the shared object), if it is hidden it is supposed to be used only internally. On windows it seems to work a bit different, it works with exporting (the symbol is defined here in the shared object and will be accessible by someone linking with this) and importing (here I am linking with a shared object and the symbol is exported there) symbols. But I couldn't find a way to tell the compiler to not export a symbol because it must be used only here, i.e. if someone link with it a linker error is expected. My question is if I can define a symbol as "hidden" (like in linux's gcc) and how. Also, all this visibility in windows topic is a bit fuzzy for me and I was looking for some further reading links to understand better how everything works.

@TITLE:Save and load date localstorage
@CONTENT:I have to save a date to localStorage and when the page is refreshed I want to calculate how much time has passed since then. Now, here's the problem: localStorage saves the date as a string so after it is saved in localStorage trying to calculate the difference between those two dates returns NaN. Try this in your javascript console: var a = new Date();
var b = new Date();
console.log(b - a); //this works
localStorage.a = a;
localStorage.b = b;
console.log(localStorage.b - localStorage.a); //this doesn't work
 I also tried JSON.stringify and JSON.parse trying to keep the date object intact, but that doesn't work either. My guess is that I have to parse the date in the localStorage. If there is not a better method, how can I do that?
@CODE:var a = new Date();
var b = new Date();
console.log(b - a); //this works

@CONTENT:Now I am creating an iOS application. I also implemented some web services. My requirement is : "The user should be able to call a web service API by Sending a Text Message(SMS)". After a lot of research I found out that there a provider called Clickatell(http://www.clickatell.com/). But I don't know how can I configure it? Please help me in configuring this. Or Is there any other APIs or SMS gateways providing this service?

@TITLE:Configuring eclipse CDT and openCV
@CONTENT:I am trying to configure OpenCV and eclipse CDT (Juno) in Windows 7. I have already installed MinGW and have been using eclipse with MinGW to write C++ programs. I am now trying to incorporate the OpenCV libraries. Below are the steps I have followed: Download and extract OpenCV 2.4.2 to F:\Applications\opencv Create new eclipse C++ project under project properties under c/c++ build > settings > GCC C++ Compiler > Includes > Include Paths (-I) I have added "F:\Applications\opencv\build\include\" under MinGW C++ Linnker > Libraries > Libraries (-l) I have added "opencv_core242", "opencv_imgproc242", "opencv_highgui242" under MinGW C++ Linker > Libraries > Library search path (-L) I have added "F:\Applications\opencv\build\x86\lib" I have then tried to write the simple program: #include "opencv2\opencv.hpp"
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
using namespace cv;
int main(void)
{
    Mat A;
    A = imread("lena.png", CV_LOAD_IMAGE_COLOR);

    imshow("image", A);

    cout << "Done" << endl;
    return 0;
}
 However nothing happens and I don't even get the "Done" message in the output. I am stumped now as I'm new to C++ and OpenCV and am not quite sure how to debug this and move forward. Any suggestions are appreciated.
@CODE:#include "opencv2\opencv.hpp"

@TITLE:Is setDownloadListener onDownloadStart called after the webview already Gets the file?
@CONTENT:Is it true that the WebView will perform an Http Get and download the complete file then it calls calls my onDownloadStart() method and my code downloads the file again? In a WebView used in an Android application we need to handle downloading a PDF file. I'm seeing behavior which I guess makes sense, but it seems odd so I'm hoping someone can verify for me. When the WebView is set up we call setDownloadListener() and create a new DownloadListener to handle the onDownloadStart() method call. In the onDownloadStart() method we use an HttpURLConnection to get the resource from our web server. In network traces I see two Http Get requests performed for the same resource. I assume this is because the webview first does a Get on the resource, then the webview does its own processing and determines that it cannot render the resource. The webview then calls the onDownloadStart() method and we retrieve the resource a second time. The docs for SetDownloadListener say: Register the interface to be used when content can not be handled by the rendering engine, and should be downloaded instead. This will replace the current handler. The webview would not know if it can render the resource until it gets a response from the server and can read the content-type returned. So, it must first do a GET or a HEAD to read the response headers. So, the double download behavior seems to make sense. And, some follow up questions: Is this a common situation? Do most apps that download files from within a webview really download the file twice? (that seems expensive but I think it may be happening) Is there a way to reuse the already downloaded content from the first request rather than requesting it again? Why doesn't the WebView use the Http HEAD method on the first request rather than GET? (I guess this would make every hyperlink a two step process and that would be expensive too) Is there a way I can prevent the extra download? Perhaps using shouldOverrideUrlLoading() to intercept the request?

 But why so? First, why i have no clang in previous folder, where it always was, and second, it is the valid way to use as 'default location for clang' this xctoolchain folder (e.g., for cmake in project repository) EDIT: for Xcode 5 and more, clang is again present in .xctoolchain folder

Subscript requires size of interface node which is not constant in non-fragile ABI or Select the Objective-C ABI version to use. Available versions are 1 (legacy "fragile" ABI), 2, (non-fragile ABI 1), and 3 (non-fragile ABI 2). That said... What is a non-fragile ABI?

@TITLE:Not able to input date using sendKeys in Selenium WebDriver
@CONTENT:The date field is like a calendar and I'm not able to input the date using sendKeys of Selenium WebDriver. But "type" in the date field was working fine before with Selenium RC. I tried using "clear()" before "sendKeys()" but this gave the error: Caught Exception: Element is read-only and so may not be used for actions
Command duration or timeout: 10.11 seconds
 sendKeys() is working fine for other text input fields. I tried isDisplayed() to check for the element and it comes as true. Even in the browser, when running the test, the cursor goes to the date fields but doesnt type any text into them.

@TITLE:What are the official Android recommendations for tabs?
@CONTENT:I have to say I'm pretty lost when it comes to designing tabbed layouts on Android right now. The platform developers seem to be evolving the design faster than I can figure out their intentions. From what I can gather from the combination of the recently deprecated TabActivity and the new design guide, I think they intend for tabs to be exclusively with the Action Bar, either inside the main action bar or stacked on a secondary action bar. Though the developer's guide suggests using the Action Bar for "global navigation". Does this mean that it's recommended to create your own tabs outside the Action Bar if your tabs only apply to a particular application context?

@TITLE:Set look and feel color
@CONTENT:I'm using the Nimbus Look & Feel within my Java Swing application. The L&F looks great, but i need to change some settings (Fonts, Colors, ... ) to fit the corporate identity of my firm. The following code sets the L&F of the whole application: try {
    for( LookAndFeelInfo info : UIManager.getInstalledLookAndFeels() ) {
        if( "Nimbus".equals( info.getName() ) ) {
            UIManager.setLookAndFeel(info.getClassName());

        }
    }
}
catch( Exception e ) {
    LogUtility.warning( "cannot set application look and feel" );
    LogUtility.warning( e.getMessage() );
}
 The code does, what it is supposed to do (setting the Nimbus Look & Feel). The problem is, that the customizeNimbusLaF() does not work, as i expect it to do. private final void customizeNimbusLaF() {

            UIConstants.BLACK );

    // tree
    UIManager.put( "Tree.background", UIConstants.BLACK );      
}
 The datatypes of the constants in UIConstants are either of type Color of Font depending of the attribute to be set. The problem is, that only a few look & feel options change. Options like the background of the tree do not change according to the options on the look & feel. I am aware of this, that a few things only change, if I change the painter of a component. But e.g. JPanel does not have such a painter property, but makes problems too. I have a second question concerning the look & feel: Aren't the painters of e.g. the menuBar supposed to use the colors, which are set in the primary color section, or do I need to implement my own painters for this use? Can someone tell me where my problem is?

@TITLE:NSEvent addGlobalMonitorForEventsMatchingMask: Hotkey Intercepting
@CONTENT:I wanna intercept hotkeys that begin with Control+Shift and ends with a character (mandatory). I have the following code: [NSEvent addGlobalMonitorForEventsMatchingMask:NSFlagsChangedMask handler: ^(NSEvent *event) {
    NSUInteger flags = [event modifierFlags] & NSDeviceIndependentModifierFlagsMask;
    if(flags == NSControlKeyMask + NSShiftKeyMask){
        NSLog(@"pressed!");
    }
}];
 What do i need to add to my code to check if the user pressed ControlShift+character, and what character the user pressed? The code NSLog(@"pressed!"); will be executed only if what i said above is true. This is my pseudo-code for what i'm looking for: [NSEvent addGlobalMonitorForEventsMatchingMask:NSFlagsChangedMask handler: ^(NSEvent *event) {
    NSUInteger flags = [event modifierFlags] & NSDeviceIndependentModifierFlagsMask;
    if((flags == NSControlKeyMask + NSShiftKeyMask) && [event containsCharacter]){
       NSLog(@"%@", [event character];
    }
}];
 So if the user presses Control+Shift+1 i'll do one thing, if Control+Shift+2 other thing, and so on...
@CODE:[NSEvent addGlobalMonitorForEventsMatchingMask:NSFlagsChangedMask handler: ^(NSEvent *event) {
    NSUInteger flags = [event modifierFlags] & NSDeviceIndependentModifierFlagsMask;

    NSUInteger flags = [event modifierFlags] & NSDeviceIndependentModifierFlagsMask;
    if((flags == NSControlKeyMask + NSShiftKeyMask) && [event containsCharacter]){

@TITLE:Reading a file with FileStream and FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING
@CONTENT:A little background: I've been experimenting with using the FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING flag when doing IO with large files. We're trying to reduce the load on the cache manager in the hope that with background IO, we'll reduce the impact of our app on user machines. Performance is not an issue. Being behind the scenes as much as possible is a big issue. I have a close-to-working wrapper for doing unbuffered IO but I ran into a strange issue. I get this error when I call Read with an offset that is not a multiple of 4. Handle does not support synchronous operations. The parameters to the FileStream constructor may need to be changed to indicate that the handle was opened asynchronously (that is, it was opened explicitly for overlapped I/O). Why does this happen? And is doesn't this message contradict itself? If I add the Asynchronous file option I get an IOException(The parameter is incorrect.) I guess the real question is what do these requirements, http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/cc644950%28v=vs.85%29.aspx, have to do with these multiples of 4. Here is the code that demonstrates the issue: FileOptions FileFlagNoBuffering = (FileOptions)0x20000000;

byte[] buffer = new byte[MinSectorSize * 2];
int i = 0;

@LINK:/questions/12362918/android-reliable-audio-recording-all-devices
@TITLE:Android: Reliable Audio Recording, All Devices
@CONTENT:Can someone please share with me a RELIABLE way to record audio across all devices using MediaRecorder? I'm simply trying to record a low-bitrate AMR format audio file, which according to google is standard across all devices. That's a bunch of crap. In my experience, there are many off-brand devices, tablets, etc. that will fail horribly when you use the default AudioEncoder.AMR_NB. My workaround is currently to use reflection to poll what encoders are in the superclass, then looping through each one with an errorlistener to see which one doesn't fail. Not only is this not graceful, but it doesn't catch all devices. I have also tried setting to default on the AudioEncoder and OutputFormat options (constant 0) and this fails horribly on some devices as well. Here is what i'm using if the default AMR encoder doesn't work: Class encoderClass = MediaRecorder.AudioEncoder.class;
Field[] encoders = encoderClass.getFields();
 Then i loop through each encoder, setting an error listener. If it ends successfully i set it as the default encoder as a setting. for (int i = j; i < encoders.length; i++) {

try {
    int enc = encoders[i].getInt(null);
    recorder.reset();
    recorder.setAudioSource(AudioSource.MIC);
    recorder.setOutputFormat(OutputFormat.THREE_GPP);
    recorder.setAudioEncoder(enc);  //testing the encoder const here
    recorder.setOutputFile(amrPath);
    recorder.setMaxDuration(3000);
    recorder.setOnInfoListener(new OnInfoListener() {
 I continue the loop if the listener catches an error: if (arg1 == MediaRecorder.MEDIA_RECORDER_ERROR_UNKNOWN) {
 This technique works for most devices. What about the rest? I still have devices that fall through the cracks and frankly i'd like something RELIABLE for nearly all devices????
@CODE:Class encoderClass = MediaRecorder.AudioEncoder.class;
Field[] encoders = encoderClass.getFields(); for (int i = j; i < encoders.length; i++) {

try {

@CONTENT:I want users to be able to enter data from a web server and/or native PC app and transfer it to their chosen Android device in much the same way that Google Play's install on device works. I'd like to use the user's Google account authentication to establish a link between the application server and the user's Android device that registered with GCM. I couldn't find any mention of how to handle this kind of authentication in the Google Cloud messaging API documentation, but did find this unanswered question in the GCM forums. I'd like to authenticate users from a web application via the his or her Google account. Similarly, the Android application would somehow obtain a handle on the same Google Account, which would be sent to the web application server once at same time as initial GCM registration. Then when the user uses the web application, the server provides a list of devices the user has already registered to the server, so that the user can be prompted about which Android device he or she would like to send data to. How can I accomplish this on the web server as well as on the device? What information can I use after authenticating with the Google account to establish a link between the two logins?

@TITLE:How to extract zipped file received from HttpWebResponse?
@CONTENT:I put url to browser's address bar and it downloads the zip file to HD. The size of zipped file is 386 bytes as written in its properties. When I use UnZipFiles method to extract the file - it works. But, I want to download programaticaly and extract it in memory. I use GetResultFromServer method to get zipped content. As shown in headers the size of the content is the same as the size of zipped file saved on HD: content-disposition: attachment; filename=emaillog-xml.zip

var s = new ZipInputStream(ms);
 but I get Unable to read from this stream.

@CONTENT:I have a project here and it has set by default that the actions occur by MouseEnter event. I mean, opening a Window, closing, returning, whatever, happens only by the MouseEnter event. I was requested to make the event fire only after 3 seconds. That means that the user will place the mouse on the control and only after 3 seconds the event must happen for all the controls in the window. So, I thought about a global timer or something alike, that will return false untill the timer reaches 3... I think that's the way... Geez, does anybody knows how can I make such thing? Thanks!!

@LINK:/questions/12287696/clarification-on-apples-block-docs
@TITLE:Clarification on Apple's Block Docs?
@CONTENT:I am working through some retain-cycle issues with blocks/ARC, and I am trying to get my head around the nuances. Any guidance is appreciated. Apple's documentation on "Blocks and Variables" (http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/cocoa/Conceptual/Blocks/Articles/bxVariables.html) says the following: If you use a block within the implementation of a method, the rules for memory management of object instance variables are more subtle: If you access an instance variable by reference, self is retained; If you access an instance variable by value, the variable is retained. The following examples illustrate the two different situations: dispatch_async(queue, ^{
    // instanceVariable is used by reference, self is retained
    doSomethingWithObject(instanceVariable);
});


id localVariable = instanceVariable;
dispatch_async(queue, ^{
    // localVariable is used by value, localVariable is retained (not self)
    doSomethingWithObject(localVariable);
});
 I find this explanation confusing. Is this appropriate use of the "by value" / "by reference" terminology? Assuming that these variables are of the same type (id), it seems like the distinguishing characteristic between them is their scope. I do not see how self is being referenced in the "by reference" example? If an accessor method were being used, (e.g. - below), I could see self being retained. doSomethingWithObject(self.instanceVariable); Do you have any guidance on when one might want to do things one way or the other? If conventional wisdom is to utilize the "by value" variables, it seems like this is going to result in a lot of additional code for additional variable declarations? In a circumstance where nested blocks are coming into play, it seems like it may be more maintainable to avoid declaring the blocks inside of each other as one could ultimately end up with a potpourri of unintentionally retained objects?
@CODE:dispatch_async(queue, ^{
    // instanceVariable is used by reference, self is retained
    doSomethingWithObject(instanceVariable);
});


id localVariable = instanceVariable;
dispatch_async(queue, ^{
    // localVariable is used by value, localVariable is retained (not self)
    doSomethingWithObject(localVariable);

@TITLE:Multiple google maps on one page
@CONTENT:On one page multiple entities are displayed. For each entity there is a google map. This is how I deal with displaying a map for only one entity: var map;
var geocoder;

$(document).ready(function(){
    google.maps.event.addDomListener(window, 'load', initialize);
});

function initialize() {
    geocoder = new google.maps.Geocoder();
    var mapOptions = {
        zoom: 16,
        center: new google.maps.LatLng(50.317408,11.12915),
        mapTypeId: google.maps.MapTypeId.ROADMAP
    };
    map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById('map_canvas'),
        mapOptions);
        codeAddress($('#entityID span#address').text());
}

function codeAddress(address) {

    geocoder.geocode( {
        'address': address
    }, function(results, status) {
        if (status == google.maps.GeocoderStatus.OK) {
            map.setCenter(results[0].geometry.location);
            var marker = new google.maps.Marker({
                map: map,

            });
        } else {
            codeAddress('germany');
        }
    });
}
 Now I want to show multiple maps, each with a different location. How would that look like? Any ideas? The algorithm should be able to deal with a dynamic amount of entities.
@CODE:var map;
var geocoder;

$(document).ready(function(){
    google.maps.event.addDomListener(window, 'load', initialize);
});

function initialize() {

        center: new google.maps.LatLng(50.317408,11.12915),
        mapTypeId: google.maps.MapTypeId.ROADMAP
    };
    map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById('map_canvas'),
        mapOptions);
        codeAddress($('#entityID span#address').text());
}

function codeAddress(address) {

    geocoder.geocode( {
        'address': address
    }, function(results, status) {
        if (status == google.maps.GeocoderStatus.OK) {

@LINK:/questions/12262943/jtable-deleting-rows-consume-the-event-to-not-get-dispatched-further
@TITLE:JTable. Deleting rows. Consume the event to not get dispatched further
@CONTENT:I needed to delete rows from a JTable on the delete key-press. So the use case is quite simple, the user select some rows, press the delete key, the rows get deleted. The code is also very simple : DefaultTableModel tableModel = (DefaultTableModel) table.getModel();
    int[] selectedRows = table.getSelectedRows();
    for (int i = selectedRows.length - 1; i > -1; i--) {
        tableModel.removeRow(selectedRows[i]);
    }
 The problem is that after the deletion gets finished we'll hear a sound beep (I'm on windows, typical windows beep), as when pressing the delete key in an empty text box (or when the caret is at the end of the text). What I thing is happening is that the key press is dispatched further to the text component that displays the text content of the cell(the first cell after the deleted ones). The beep is fired by the DefaultEditorKit$DeleteNextCharAction#actionPerformed method because there is no character ahead the dot. As a hack I modify the event in the listener : e.setKeyCode(KeyEvent.VK_SHIFT) // see JTable#processKeyBinding
 the event does not get forwarded further, so the beep dissapear but I think it's a bad solution and there's a better one. But which is that better solution ?
@CODE:DefaultTableModel tableModel = (DefaultTableModel) table.getModel();
    int[] selectedRows = table.getSelectedRows();
    for (int i = selectedRows.length - 1; i > -1; i--) {
        tableModel.removeRow(selectedRows[i]);
    } e.setKeyCode(KeyEvent.VK_SHIFT) // see JTable#processKeyBinding e.consume();

@TITLE:Taking screenshot in Java (Robot, code working but not with external full screen application)
@CONTENT:I am using the following code for taking a screenshot:         Robot robot = new Robot();
        BufferedImage image = robot.createScreenCapture(screenRectangle);
        ImageIO.write(image,"png", file);
 This code is running good. It takes screen shots of my desktop when I run the program, etc. However, when I try to run first some game, application in full screen, it doesn't work properly. It renders either black screen, either the same "initial" picture. Is this problem known, and how to fix this please? Second question : Is this possible to simulate some "Print Screen" key we can have on keybord in order to solve this problem? Because I can use Print Screen key when the application is launched in full screen, and when I paste I got my screen. (Like this but in java : Copy the contents of the screen or the active window ? ) Thank you in advance for your help. EDIT : Andrew Thompson was kind to propose me the following code that will be a good first step to solve this problem : import java.awt.Robot;
import java.awt.Toolkit;
import java.awt.datatransfer.Clipboard;
import java.awt.datatransfer.DataFlavor;
import java.awt.event.KeyEvent;

public class ScreenshotUsingPrintScreen {

public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    int i = KeyEvent.VK_PRINTSCREEN;
    Clipboard cb = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().getSystemClipboard();
    DataFlavor[] flavors = cb.getAvailableDataFlavors();
    System.out.println("Before: ");
    for (DataFlavor flavor : flavors) {
        System.out.println(flavor);
    }

    // get the screenshot
    Robot robot = new Robot();
    robot.keyPress(KeyEvent.VK_PRINTSCREEN);
    robot.delay(40);
    robot.keyRelease(KeyEvent.VK_PRINTSCREEN);
    robot.delay(40);

    cb = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().getSystemClipboard();
    flavors = cb.getAvailableDataFlavors();
    System.out.println("After: ");
    for (DataFlavor flavor : flavors) {
        System.out.println(flavor);
    }
}
 } It compiles well but however I receive the following error while then running it. Before:

@TITLE:connecting between two dropdownlist mvc 4
@CONTENT:I have an preepay products sale. dealer can have subdealers dealer can Set a price for each product and he have max obligo for each product. now i like in my mvc c# site project in the sale page to have two DropDowmList when i chack product from the first ddl i want my other ddl(how much product he have to sale) to be conected from my db. EDIT: for exemple a dealer have three product to sale: productA - 5 units to sale productB - 20 productC - 15 When he choos productB on the seccond ddl or on a textboxForNumber(min,max) he shuld see the range from 1 to 20 i try to creat a new model like this:     public int ProductObligoByDealerID { get; set; }

    public int DealerID { get; set; }
    public virtual Dealer Dealer { get; set; }

    public int ProductID { get; set; }
    public virtual Product Product { get; set; }

    public uint MonthObligo { get; set; }
 but i cant connect this two ddl togethe. thank for ideas and sory for my bad english =) EDIT: i tryed to do this with the ViewBag like the other ddl resorces list. var AllObligoProdact = db.ProductObligo.Where(p => p.DealerID == currentDealer.DealerID);

foreach (var item in AllObligoProdact)
 ViewBag.ProductObligo[item.Product.ProductID].max = item.MonthObligo;
 and in the cshtml side         <div class="editor-label">
        @Html.LabelFor(model => model.DealerProductID)
    </div>

        @Html.ValidationMessageFor(model => model.NumOfMonth)
    </div>
 but i still get nothing :/ it is a good idea to use a new table in the db, or maybee thare are a better way to do this?
@CODE:public int ProductObligoByDealerID { get; set; }

@TITLE:Rendering <%%= with HAML
@CONTENT:I have a Backbone.js application hosted in Sinatra and rendered via an ERB script. The backbone templates are using the underscore template functionality so the variables are rendered in ERB like so: <div id="<%%= variable %>">
 The extra "%" escapes the rendering of that variable and renders it with a single "%" which is what the underscore template library would pick up. I tried the following while upgrading to HAML: #"<%= id %>"
 Which did not work. How do I accomplish the same task with HAML?

@TITLE:The Law of Demeter
@CONTENT:I recently posted a question on stackoverflow where I did something to effect of @period_registration.period.event However, it was suggested that I do something like the following: def event
  period.event
end

@period_registration.event
 My general sense is that this seems a little heavy-handed. Looking at this previous posting How do I apply the Law of Demeter to this? shows how heavy handed this can become if you did this for every association. How common of a practice is this in rails? My thought is that even if this is technically the right thing to do, if it isn't a part of the rails culture then it seems that doing this will throw people off. And, more importantly, actually make the code less maintainable as other developers think you're wasting your time with all these helper methods. Let's say I wanted to impliment this, would @period_registration.event.city, where city is an attribute of event, not a seperate object also violate LoD or would I need to write ANOTHER method so I could do: @period_registration.city
@CODE:@period_registration.period.event def event
  period.event
end

@period_registration.event

I just gave an example of userName but actually its some other data which changes everyday, like say "news of the day" Many would suggest to remove public static and send that userName as: Intent.putExtra("user_name", userName);
 But isn't this same as what i am doing. I mean even this way i will get NullPointerException right??

@CONTENT:I have a receiver that start after phone boot like this: <receiver android:name=".OnBootReceiver" >

                <action android:name="android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED" />
            </intent-filter>

</receiver>
 in the receiver I run set an alarm like this: AlarmManager  mgr=(AlarmManager)context.getSystemService(Context.ALARM_SERVICE);

        Intent i=new Intent(context, LocationPoller.class);

        i.putExtra(LocationPoller.EXTRA_INTENT,
                  new Intent(context, LocationReceiver.class));
        i.putExtra(LocationPoller.EXTRA_PROVIDER,
                 LocationManager.GPS_PROVIDER);



         PendingIntent pi=PendingIntent.getBroadcast(context, 0, i, 0);
          mgr.setRepeating(AlarmManager.ELAPSED_REALTIME_WAKEUP,
                        SystemClock.elapsedRealtime(),
                        PERIOD,
                        pi);
 It works fine, except, of course, when user install app, the alarm will not be set until user reboot phone,. to go around this, I need to check from my Activity if AlarmManager is set, if not I need to set from Activity. Hence, how do I check if Alarm manager is already set.

@TITLE:Implementing a ListView Filter with Josh Smith's WPF MVVM Demo App
@CONTENT:I've been trying to expand Josh Smith's demo MVVM application in order to better understand the principals behind it and I've hit a wall when trying to implement a filter function on a View using a ListView. I have spent a few hours researching and dabbling but its just not working. My first step was to bind a textbox in my view to a property in my ViewModel: <TextBox Height="25" Name="txtFilter" Width="150" Text="{Binding Path=Filter, UpdateSourceTrigger=PropertyChanged}"/>
 This matches in my VM: public string Filter
    {
        get { return this.filter; }
        set
        {
            this.filter = value;
            OnFilterChanged();
        }
    }
 My VM used a ObservableCollection for the datasource but I've tried to convert it into an ICollectionView after reading tutorials: internal ObservableCollection<StaffViewModel> InnerStaff { get; set; }
    internal CollectionViewSource CvsStaff { get; set; }
    public ICollectionView AllStaff
    {
        get { return CvsStaff.View; }
    }
 In my constructor I have specified: CvsStaff = new CollectionViewSource();
CvsStaff.Source = this.InnerStaff;
CvsStaff.Filter += ApplyFilter;
 When my Filter Property gets updated it calls OnFilterChanged which is: private void OnFilterChanged()
    {
        CvsStaff.View.Refresh();
    }
 My ApplyFilter Function is: void ApplyFilter(object sender, FilterEventArgs e)
    {
        StaffViewModel svm = (StaffViewModel)e.Item;

        if (this.Filter.Length == 0)
        {
            e.Accepted = true;
        }
        else
        {
            e.Accepted = svm.LastName.Contains(Filter);
        }
    }
 Is there a silly mistake that I've made that anyone can help me spot? I'm fairly new to WPF and the MVVM pattern so I'm still learning! EDIT In the View I bind the collection with: <CollectionViewSource
  x:Key="StaffGroup"
  Source="{Binding Path=AllStaff}"
  />
 and the ListView is as such: <ListView
      Name="staffList"
      AlternationCount="2" 
      DataContext="{StaticResource StaffGroup}" 
      ItemContainerStyle="{StaticResource StaffItemStyle}"
      ItemsSource="{Binding}"
        Grid.Row="1">
@CODE:<TextBox Height="25" Name="txtFilter" Width="150" Text="{Binding Path=Filter, UpdateSourceTrigger=PropertyChanged}"/> public string Filter
    {
        get { return this.filter; }
        set
        {
            this.filter = value;
            OnFilterChanged();
        }
    } internal ObservableCollection<StaffViewModel> InnerStaff { get; set; }
    internal CollectionViewSource CvsStaff { get; set; }
    public ICollectionView AllStaff
    {
        get { return CvsStaff.View; }
    } CvsStaff = new CollectionViewSource();
CvsStaff.Source = this.InnerStaff;
CvsStaff.Filter += ApplyFilter; private void OnFilterChanged()
    {
        CvsStaff.View.Refresh();
    } void ApplyFilter(object sender, FilterEventArgs e)
    {
        StaffViewModel svm = (StaffViewModel)e.Item;

        if (this.Filter.Length == 0)
        {
            e.Accepted = true;
        }
        else
        {
            e.Accepted = svm.LastName.Contains(Filter);
        }

@TITLE:Writing a large 2d array to Excel
@CONTENT:I'm looking to write a large 2d array to an Excel worksheet using C#. If the array is 500 x 500, the code that I would use to write this is as follows:  var startCell = Worksheet.Cells[1, 1];
 var endCell = Worksheet.Cells[500, 500];
 var writeRange = (Excel.Range)Worksheet.Cells[startCell, endCell;
 writeRange.Value = myArray;
 I get an exception on this line: var endCell = Worksheet.Cells[500, 500];
 As anybody who has used C# and Excel via COM can testify, the error message received is pretty much useless. I think that the issue is that the underlying data structure used for the worksheet is not of sufficient size to index cell 500,500 when I first create the sheet. Does anybody know how to achieve the desired result? I'm hoping that there is a simple way to re-size the underlying data structure before creating the Range. Thanks. Edit: Error message is: {"Exception from HRESULT: 0x800A03EC"}
 With and excel error code of -2146827284. Update: The link supplied in the comments below alluded to an issue with opening the Excel sheet in compatibility mode. This does seem to be the problem. If I save the document in .xlsx or .xlsm format before running my code, this seems to work. My issue is that I cannot expect my users to do this each time. Is there a programmitcal way of achieving this? Would it simply be a case of opening the file, checking the extension and then saving it in the new format if needed?
@CODE:var startCell = Worksheet.Cells[1, 1];

@TITLE:How do I read an arbitrarily long line in C?
@CONTENT:I would like to have the equivalent (in C) of getline in C++: std::string s;
getline(std::cin,s); // reads an arbitrarily long line and
                     // inserts its contents on s
 Is there any way to do such a thing in C? I'm looking for something that looks like this: char* s;
getline(stdin,s); // allocates the space necessary to fit the read
                  // line and make s point to it
 EDIT: I decided to use the POSIX getline function at the end since I'm on Linux (run man getline if you don't know what I'm talking about), but Michael Burr provided an implementation of getline which works on other operational systems in which getline is not available by default. Even if his implementation is not the most efficient one could conceive, it does the job as I want so I marked it as the answer for my question.
@CODE:getline std::string s;
getline(std::cin,s); // reads an arbitrarily long line and
                     // inserts its contents on s char* s;

@TITLE:Bit shifting an int 32 times in C
@CONTENT:I have a specific C bit-shifting scenario that I do not believe is covered on Stack Overflow yet. (If it is, I haven't been able to find it!) This exercise is using signed ints as the data type. Take the value 0x80000000 (which is just a 1 in the most significant bit.) Shift it right once on a machine using arithmetic right-shifts (which mine does). Result = 0xC0000000 (1100 0000 in leftmost byte). Continue shifting it and you should be filling up with ones, from the left to the right. Result = 0xFFFFFFFF (All ones.) However: Try the same example but shift one extra position, all together: 0x80000000 >> 0x00000020 (Right shift 32 times) Your result? I don't know. My result was not all ones. In fact, I got 0x00000001 which was NOT my desired behavior. Why is this? Is it machine specific? (Context: Homework assignment limiting my operations to a few bit operators to solve a puzzle. This is an aspect to a puzzle but is far from the entire question.)

 I tired to look into the MEMORY_BASIC_INFORMATION for the failing pages but I didn't find anything strange there. Also the number of failing pages varies from run to run (in average about 5). WHat prevents me from reading these pages? Do I need to adjust some privilges in the process token?

@TITLE:Why do I have to call GraphicsEnvorinment.registerFont() even if I my Font were created from file?
@CONTENT:I'm developing a web application which use JFreeChart to render chart. However, when server dose not have any Chinese font installed, JFreeChart dose not display Chinese character even if I have set the font. Then I write a small testing code and find out that add this line of code before drawing the chart can solve the problem. GraphicsEnvironment.getLocalGraphicsEnvironment().registerFont(font);
 So my questions are - Why do I have to register font into JVM even if I create my font from File ? Dose that mean JFreeChart do not use the font I set directly ? When I deploy my program into server, even if I add this line of code, it dose not display Chinese characters. How do I make it always use the font I set in order to display character properly in all environment ? I know I can make a fallback directory in $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib and put my font into it. But that dose not explain why JFreeChart cannot display with the font I set. UPDATE I'm pretty sure the font were load correctly, and so dose registerFont() return true when I deploy the program into Tomcat. UPDATE 2 According to JAVA 2D FAQ, now I realize I have to call registerFont() in order to make my own font "installed" into JVM, and my font will be available throught Font constructor. As of Java SE 6, there is a method : GraphicsEnvironment.registerFont() which gives you the ability to make a "created" font available to Font constructors and to be listed via Font enumeration APIs. Font.createFont() and this method combine to provide a way to "install" a Font into the running JRE so it is available just as O/S installed fonts are. However this Font does not persist across JRE invocations. But, since I already have Font instances created/derived from createFont(), why dosen my program still need to create other Font ? Following is the code I used, it simply output a chart in PNG format. If you want to run the code, you should change the output location and font to fit your need, and here is the SourceForge link for Chinese font I use in code. import java.awt.Font;

The question is, how can I make it view only and disable download (At least disable this toolbar item). Is that possible with google viewer? or is there any other viewer that works like Google Viewer but view-only?

@TITLE:Performance slow with kineticjs
@CONTENT:Sorry if this question was asked already, I've tried to find it by couldn't. I have a canvas that should eventually show about 400-500 rectangles 20-30 pixels height/width. Each one of them should move one pixel left and up on mouse over and back on mouse out to create sort of selected behavior. Now, my code works great with small amount of shapes, but for 500 of them it starts slowing down dramatically. From some example on the internet I saw that I can create "animation layer" and move the object i need to animate there. But, this still requires me to redraw the main layer to remove the moved item from it's previous position... Here's the code: var seatMap = {};

seatMap.seatTypes = {
    economy: {

    }
};

seatMap.Map = function (params) {
    var stage = new Kinetic.Stage({

    });

    var mainLayer = new Kinetic.Layer();
    var animationLayer = new Kinetic.Layer();

    stage.add(mainLayer);
    stage.add(animationLayer);

    var addSeat = function (object) {
        object.seat.mainLayerRef = mainLayer;
        object.seat.animationLayerRef = animationLayer;

        mainLayer.add(object.seat);
    };

    var refresh = function () {
        mainLayer.draw();
    }

    return {
        refresh: refresh,
        addSeat: addSeat
    }
}

seatMap.Seat = function (params) {

    var seatType = params.seatType == null ? seatMap.seatTypes.economy : params.seatType;

    var seat = new Kinetic.Rect({

        listening: true
    });
    seat.staticXPosition = params.x;
    seat.staticYPosition = params.y;

    seat.on('mouseover', function (event) {
        event.shape.moveTo(event.shape.animationLayerRef);
        event.shape.setX(event.shape.staticXPosition - 2);
        event.shape.setY(event.shape.staticYPosition - 2);
        event.shape.animationLayerRef.draw();
        event.shape.mainLayerRef.draw();

@TITLE:simple financial rate function in javascript
@CONTENT:I'm looking for a simple javascript financial RATE function, and I found this one. But it seems too difficult to understand. I want to simplify this function, and I need your help. If anyone has a simplest function, please answer. (It's a excel RATE function equivalent.) var rate = function(nper, pmt, pv, fv, type, guess) {
  if (guess == null) guess = 0.01;
  if (fv == null) fv = 0;
  if (type == null) type = 0;

  var FINANCIAL_MAX_ITERATIONS = 128;//Bet accuracy with 128
  var FINANCIAL_PRECISION = 0.0000001;//1.0e-8

  var y, y0, y1, x0, x1 = 0, f = 0, i = 0;
  var rate = guess;
  if (Math.abs(rate) < FINANCIAL_PRECISION) {
     y = pv * (1 + nper * rate) + pmt * (1 + rate * type) * nper + fv;

@LINK:/questions/12014571/efficient-way-to-compute-facet-counts-in-elastic-search
@TITLE:Efficient way to compute *Facet Counts* in Elastic Search
@CONTENT:I want to compute facet counts for a facet query UI but I think I am missing something as I am unable to get the numbers I need using facet filters. Here's an example. Given two facets with three possible terms in each facet: Colors: {red, yellow, blue}
Notes: {do, re, mi}
 When I do a search, the counts for each term in a facet do not take into account the filters set in the other facet. To illustrate: [ ] All colors (18)
 [x] Red (10)
 [ ] Green (5)
 [ ] Blue (3)

[ ] All notes (18)
 [ ] Do (5)
 [x] Re (7)
 [ ] Mi (6)
 Note that the totals within each facet sum to the total number of hits for the query as though no filters are set. The behaviour I want is for the numbers in the Notes facet to take into account the filter in the Colors facet and vice versa. That is, the numbers for the note terms should sum to 10 (to match the red filter), not 18. Interestingly, the example screenshot in the docs uses an example from Linked In which actually demonstrates the behavior that I want. http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/api/search/facets/ I am able to get the result I want by manually resubmitting the query once for each term in each facet (ugh) but I wonder if there is a way to get the same behaviour as LinkedIn out of the box by changing my query.

@CONTENT:I have been working with the blueimp jQuery File Upload plugin and I'm trying to setup a custom field the user can change for uploads. Within the PHP class there is a construct which sets up all the default options variables. I'm looking for the best way I can store this data so after the user sets a value it'll save as the new default upload folder. I'm thinking inside an external XML file, which is them imported into the PHP script. Here's the upload class constructor function:     function __construct($options=null) {

 I hope this makes sense and I'm happy to clarify anything. But basically - how can I allow users to manually enter a directory structure and that becomes the new upload directory for images? Where could I save this new string variable? Probably not inside PHP but possibly in an external file, like XML or JSON?

@CONTENT:Are there any good resources (books, websites) that give very good comparison of different scheduling algorithms for a Finite State Machine (FSM) in an embedded system without an OS? I am designing a simple embedded web server without an OS. I would like to know what are the various methods used to schedule the processing of the different events that occur in the system. For example,if two events arrived at the same time how are the events prioritized? If I assign different priorities to events, how do I ensure that the higher priority event gets processed first? If an even higher priority event comes in while an event is being processed, how can make sure that that event is processed immediately? I'm planning on using a FSM to check various conditions upon an event's arrival and then to properly schedule the event for processing. Because the embedded web server does not have an OS, I am considering using a cyclic executive approach. But I would like to see a comparison of the pros and cons of different algorithms that could be used in this approach.

Is this a limitation of Python (2.7.3 and 3.2.3 tried) or is there a good reason why this cannot work? Are there plans to get rid of the limitation? Are there workarounds (some different syntax maybe I didn't figure out) to achieve what I want?

@TITLE:Require Pass-code to Disable Android Device Administrator
@CONTENT:I was thinking of a security app which will have device administrator privileges. I wanted to see if it was possible to require a pass-code when the user tries to uncheck the app as an administrator under Settings->Security->Device Administrators. This would add a roadblock to not easily allow the user to uninstall the app as they would first need to remove the admin privileges from the app (for which they would need to authenticate with a password) and then they could uninstall. The idea is for parents to install a security app on their kids' phones and not have the kids uninstall it easily. Would something like this be possible without root access?

@TITLE:how to remove character from edittext?
@CONTENT:I want to know is there any method by which i can remove the specific character from the EditText. I want to remove charter from EditText by specifying position in edit text is there something like removeAt() for EditText?     public class MainActivity extends Activity {

    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

}
 EXTRA INFORMATION the main problem is i want to make text bold inside edittext but not all the text. The text that is typed after setting bold button on(bold is my toggle button). ok here is the code      ed1.setOnKeyListener(new OnKeyListener() {

        public boolean onKey(View v, int keyCode, KeyEvent event) {
            // TODO Auto-generated method stub
            int i = 0;

            switch(event.getAction())
            {
            case KeyEvent.ACTION_UP:
                    if(bold.isChecked())
                    {
                         i=ed1.getSelectionStart();

                         ed1.append(Html.fromHtml("<b>"+ed1.getText().toString().charAt(i-1)+"</b>"));

                    }

            }
            return false;
        }
    });
 the problem is that i get double character's one is normal character and then again the bold one so i want to remove that normal characters by specifying there position

The thing is, since I am using the NavigationController all the ViewControllers are loaded either from the Left or from the Right. But I want to load the ViewController from the Bottom. I know I can use presentModalViewController to present the ViewController from the Bottom. But it is not equivalent to the Navigation Controller because , from the 4th ViewController, If I press one button , I need to come to the 1st ViewController.

 This all work fine. What I am trying to achieve now is for the pre-selected item to show by default when the user re-visits the form if they wish to edit their choice.

@TITLE:MonoTouch: Doubling Appearance Image size when Hue adjusted on Retina display
@CONTENT:I am setting the NavBar's background with this code which works great in Retina and non-Retina displays. There is a @2x and normal image. So, all good: UINavigationBar.Appearance.SetBackgroundImage(
     GetImage(ImageTheme.menubar), UIBarMetrics.Default);
 Now, when I apply this ChangeHue() transformation to the image to adjust its hue, on Retina displays the image is twice the size. Non-Retina displays are fine:     UINavigationBar.Appearance.SetBackgroundImage(
       ChangeHue(GetImage(ImageTheme.menubar)), UIBarMetrics.Default);
    ...

    UIImage ChangeHue(UIImage originalImage){
        var hueAdjust = new CIHueAdjust() {
            Image = CIImage.FromCGImage(originalImage.CGImage),
            Angle = hue * (float)Math.PI / 180f // angles to radians
        };

        var output = hueAdjust.OutputImage;
        var context = CIContext.FromOptions(null);
        var cgimage = context.CreateCGImage(output, output.Extent);
        var i = UIImage.FromImage(cgimage);
        return i;
}
 Here is the result in Non-Retina and Retina displays after the Hue is applied:

@TITLE:Managing AutoFac lifetime scopes per session and request in asp.net mvc 3
@CONTENT:I want to use AutoFac in a web application. I have the root container, a child container per session and a child container per request. I'm trying to figure out what the/a best way is to manage these lifetime scopes. In the Global.asax.cs I have added the following: protected void Application_Start(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    var container = ...;
}

protected void Session_Start(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    var sessionScope = container.BeginLifetimeScope("session");

    Session["Autofac_LifetimeScope"] = sessionScope;
}

protected void Application_BeginRequest(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    var sessionScope = (ILifetimeScope) Session["Autofac_LifetimeScope"];
    var requestScope = sessionScope.BeginLifetimeScope("httpRequest");

    HttpContext.Current.Items["Autofac_LifetimeScope"] = requestScope;
}

protected void Application_EndRequest(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    var requestScope = (ILifetimeScope)HttpContext.Current.Items["Autofac_LifetimeScope"];
    requestScope.Dispose();
}

protected void Session_End(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    var sessionScope = (ILifetimeScope)Session["Autofac_LifetimeScope"];

    sessionScope.Dispose();
}

protected void Application_End(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    container.Dispose();
}
 How can I tell AutoFac to use my requestScope as the starting point for getting dependencies, so that the implementations I register as InstancePerLifetimeScope will be resolved using my requestScope? If that is not possible, can I get AutoFac to create its per-request lifetime scope out of my sessionScope? Or am I on the wrong track here? Could there be an other way of making AutoFac aware of this hierarchy? Any help or other comments are appreciated. In response to Steven. I'm still in the early stages of prototyping, but possible things you could have in the sessionScope: UserPreferences Authentication and authorization context (e.g. user identity and roles) Not related to the application I'm going to build, but in a e-commerce environment, the shopping cart could be session scoped. This is probably the best concrete example. It is something that you expect to live longer than a request, but shorter than the application. There could be more than this, but if I have a strategy for the UserPreferences, Authentication and Authorization, then that strategy could also be applied to other components that will be created later. A possible alternative is to get all the necessary information at the beginning of the request and place these configured components in the request scope. It will give me the result I expect, but it doesn't match the model I have in my mind about application->session->request hierarchy. I'm hoping to create a system that makes sense, since I'm definitely not the one that is going to maintain it.
@CODE:protected void Application_Start(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    var container = ...;

}

{
    var requestScope = (ILifetimeScope)HttpContext.Current.Items["Autofac_LifetimeScope"];
    requestScope.Dispose();

@TITLE:After publishing new version of android app to google play admob status changed to inactive and no ads are displayed
@CONTENT:Admob was showing ads on my application, everything was working fine. Then I created a new version of that app, uploaded it to google play and ads stopped appearing. In admob the status of this app chnaged to "Inactive: AdMob has never received an ad request for your site" (the bubble got from green to red) despite the fact that there is some revenue from the first version, when the ads were still working. I didn't change adUnitId, it's the same like Publisher id shown in admob. When I run that app from eclipse test ads appear correctly, but only test ads. If I remove my device from list of test devices an ad is never displayed. In LogCat I get these messages: Received ad url: "url" and then onFailedToReceiveAd(Ad request successful, but no ad returned due to lack of ad inventory.) Ok, it is possible that I don't get ads because of my locality or something, but how can that be with all few hundred people that used my app? The problem must be somewhere else. What could be the problem? Do I need to create a new app in admob for every app update in google play store? (which seems unlogical to me) Thank you.

@TITLE:How to read from detected NFC tag (NDEF message). Android NFC
@CONTENT:Similar question - How to read detected NFC tag (NDEF content) details in android? I want my android app to be able to read and parse a detected NDEF message. I have already edited the AndroidManifest.xml to detect nfc tags and I have added the intent filter it looks like this             <intent-filter>
            <action android:name="android.nfc.action.TAG_DISCOVERED"/>
            <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT"/>
    </intent-filter>
 I believe this is fine as when I use the NFCDemo sample app that comes with the SDK to create MockNDEFtags, when the list of applications I can choose to handle these generated tags my app appears. I then click on my app and it opens up without problem, I just need a way to read the data that was passed to it in the NDEF message. The code:  Tag myTag = (Tag) nfcintent.getParcelableExtra(NfcAdapter.EXTRA_TAG);

 // get NDEF tag details
 Ndef ndefTag = Ndef.get(myTag);
 ...
 NdefMessage ndefMesg = ndefTag.getCachedNdefMessage();
 was suggested in a similar question and throughout the web I find many similar answers. My problem is with the line of code "Tag myTag = (Tag) nfcintent.getParcelableExtra(NfcAdapter.EXTRA_TAG);"
 I get the error "nfcintent cannot be resolved" I realize that the author of the code likely put nfcintent as a placeholder for an intent specific to my app however im not sure what im supposed to put in its place. My mainactivity that starts my app looks like this public class TabsActivity extends TabActivity {

/** Called when the activity is first created. */
@Override
public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.main);

    TabHost tabHost = getTabHost();

    // Tab for Graph
    TabSpec graphspec = tabHost.newTabSpec("Graph");
    // setting Title and Icon for the Tab
    graphspec.setIndicator("Graph");
    Intent graphIntent = new Intent(this, GraphActivity.class);
    graphspec.setContent(graphIntent);

    // Tab for Intro
    TabSpec introspec = tabHost.newTabSpec("Intro");
    introspec.setIndicator("Intro");
    Intent introIntent = new Intent(this, IntroActivity.class);
    introspec.setContent(introIntent);


    // Adding all TabSpec to TabHost
    tabHost.addTab(introspec); // Adding intro tab
    tabHost.addTab(graphspec); // Adding graph tab

}
 } I assume as this starts the app it is where the NFC tag must be dealt with. If I can just access the NDEFMessage from the tag I already have the ability to parse it with the NdefMessageParser from the android sample app. I want to parse the information from the NDEFmessage and ultimately have that information accessible by each tab in the app.
@CODE:<intent-filter>
            <action android:name="android.nfc.action.TAG_DISCOVERED"/>
            <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT"/>
    </intent-filter> Tag myTag = (Tag) nfcintent.getParcelableExtra(NfcAdapter.EXTRA_TAG);

 // get NDEF tag details
 Ndef ndefTag = Ndef.get(myTag);
 ...
 NdefMessage ndefMesg = ndefTag.getCachedNdefMessage(); "Tag myTag = (Tag) nfcintent.getParcelableExtra(NfcAdapter.EXTRA_TAG);" public class TabsActivity extends TabActivity {

@CONTENT:Can the following be done in gnuplot? If yes, how? I have data for time vs position(x,y,z) in a table with t,x,y,z as headers. I would like to know if I can somehow plot the same time vs position of the particle inside a predefined space with a pause after each time step; so that i can see the evolution of the particles position with time. I would also like to know if I can draw a continuous line from the previous position to the current position so that I can actually see the track of its past. Example data: Lets say the predefined space is a box of 10x10x10 and my particle has the following positions over 3 seconds. t x y z

 How do i see the tracking of the particle! my idea is that if i can pause the plot of every time step by a little bit, it will look like an animation which i can just capture using a screen capture software... UNLESS, this data can be animated using gnuplot too Is there any other software which does this more efficiently and/or elegantly if gnuplot is not the right tool!? Any help would be appreciated! Thanks.

 Sorry im new i cant post pictures. Thanks in advance, hope you guys get it. ///////UPDATE/////////////// Okay guys, this is very interesting.. i tried all your suggestions however neither has worked, so i started a new blank project and just put a textview into layout with really long string and it wrapped just fine. So, i dont know how is this possible, but its the custom theme to style the actionbar doing this, when i comment it out in the manifest it works just fine, however the system holo theme seems doing this aswell AndroidManifest.xml <manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"

@CONTENT:Let's say I am solving a particular problem and come up with a function let function parameter1 ... = 
     a lot of adding, multiplying & so on with a lot of 
     literals all over the place
 Now this function works fine if my parameters are of type int. But somewhere I will need it to go up to 11, I will need that extra push into int64 or even BigInteger. So what do I do? I copy&paste the function, change the name, and go hunting for all literal appearances that make the compiler think the function should operate on int. And this sucks. Is there a way to do this: let greatFunction param1 param2 = (param1+1)/(param2*2)
 where param1 and param2 can be any combo of integer types? Edit: Expanding a bit on a great tip by kvb below, I came up with the following module NumericLiteralG 

  let inline FromZero() = LanguagePrimitives.GenericZero
  let inline FromOne() = LanguagePrimitives.GenericOne
  let inline FromInt32 n =
    let rec loop nIn nOut = 
        if nIn>0 then loop (nIn - 1) (nOut + LanguagePrimitives.GenericOne)
        else nOut
    loop n LanguagePrimitives.GenericZero
 so it becomes a bit less ugly when used let inline halfSquare num =
   let res = num / 2G
   res * res

let solve1 = halfSquare 5I 
let solve2 = halfSquare 5.0
let solve3 = halfSquare 5uy
 Now the question is should I use this? If not, why not?
@CODE:let function parameter1 ... =

@TITLE:Cross compiler default include path setup
@CONTENT:First, some background: I'm attempting to write drivers and applications for Android on the Beagleboard-xM. I've downloaded their android development kit, installed it, and can succesfully build everything in it using the directions at http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/TI-Android-ICS-4.0.3-DevKit-3.0.0_DevelopersGuide I've been able to make my own skeleton kernel module following the steps in http://tldp.org/LDP/lkmpg/2.6/lkmpg.pdf without issues. I can copy the .ko file to the android device, insmod, rmmod, etc. I got tired of the basic shell given by the default build and thought I'd add busybox. I tried following the directions at ht tp://omapp edia.org/wiki/Android_Installing_Busybox_Command_Line_Tools, but I get a compile error on standard libc header files. After digging around quite a bit, I've determined that the pre-built cross compiler provided in the TI android development kit wasn't searching the right paths. I confirmed this by creating my own .c file that included and tried to compile it with arm-eabi-gcc blah.c -o blah and was met with the same results (unable to find the header file in question) 'arm-eabi-gcc -print-prog-name=cc1' -v gives me this: ignoring nonexistent directory "/usr/local/google/home/android/cupcake_rel_root/usr/local/include" ignoring nonexistent directory "/usr/local/lib/gcc/arm-eabi/4.4.3/include" ignoring nonexistent directory "/usr/local/lib/gcc/arm-eabi/4.4.3/include-fixed" ignoring nonexistent directory "/usr/local/lib/../arm-eabi/include" ignoring nonexistent directory "/usr/local/google/home/android/cupcake_rel_root/usr/include" None of these paths ever existed on my fresh install of ubuntu 10.04. My cross compiler I used is at /usr/TI-Android/prebuilt/linux-86/toolchain/arm-eabi-4.4.3/. I didn't do anything except run the bit .bin file that was the android development kit (which seemed more like simply extracting itself from the .bin file; I don't remember it doing anything else) So, a few questions: how the heck did everything else (i.e. android, x-loader, u-boot, the kernel) build by just putting the bin of the cross compile tool into $PATH (like the how-to documents say). I assume it (make menuconfig?) does some magic in fixing up the include paths based on the location of the executable, but... Why doesn't busybox work the same way since it seems to be built with a similar looking infrastructure? How do I make it so I can cross compile my own applications? I assume I've missed a step and should have done some sort of install/configure on the pre-built cross compiler, but information is horribly scant. I appeal to you, open source gods, to point my way across this dark and stormy sea. (p.s. sorry for mangling the third HTTP, the system wouldn't let me post more than 2 at my reputation level)

 However, the tutorial says the method "is used to project a new result type from the matching documents". How to ensure this method will retrieve only the subset of fields and not the entire result and then select only the subset into a new object?

I need to dynamically alter the where clause based on parameters that are passed through the query string. I have this working fine except that I want the end user to be able to use wildcards: A "?" is used to represent a single character. A "*" represents multiple characters. Seems easy enough, all I need to do use the LIKE operator and replace ? with _ (match a single character), and * with % (match all characters). Below is the method that does the fancy footwork (which is called on PageLoad), and it works great except that my wildcards are being escaped. private void ApplyFilter(ref LinqDataSource lds)
{
    if (Request.QueryString.Keys.Count > 0)
    {
        string where = "";
        int counter = 0;

        foreach (string key in Request.QueryString.Keys)
        {
            if (Request.QueryString[key] != "")
            {
                if (counter == 0)
                {
                    where += key + ".Contains(@" + key + ")";
                }
                else
                {
                    where += " AND " + key + ".Contains(@" + key + ")";
                }

                lds.WhereParameters.Add(key, Request.QueryString[key].Replace("?", "_").Replace("*", "%"));
                counter++;
            }
        }

        if (where != "")
            lds.Where = where;
    }
}
 Below is the query that is generated from this query string: .aspx?LOOP_DESCRIPTION=*&LOOP=*&AREA=01 exec sp_executesql N'SELECT [t1].[AREA], [t1].[LOOP], [t1].[LOOP DESCRIPTION] AS [LOOP_DESCRIPTION]
FROM (
    SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY [t0].[AREA], [t0].[LOOP], [t0].[LOOP DESCRIPTION]) AS [ROW_NUMBER], [t0].[AREA], [t0].[LOOP], [t0].[LOOP DESCRIPTION]
    FROM [dbo].[INSTRUMENT LOOP DESCRIPTION] AS [t0]
    WHERE ([t0].[LOOP DESCRIPTION] LIKE @p0 ESCAPE ''~'') AND ([t0].[LOOP] LIKE @p1 ESCAPE ''~'') AND ([t0].[AREA] LIKE @p2)
    ) AS [t1]
WHERE [t1].[ROW_NUMBER] BETWEEN @p3 + 1 AND @p3 + @p4

 As you can see by the parameter assignment, my wildcards are being escaped with the tilde character: @p0=N'%~%%',@p1=N'%~%%',@p2=N'%01%'
 My question is, is it possible to stop the _ and % characters from being escaped?

@TITLE:Getting signatures of private API methods for iOS
@CONTENT:I know that SpringboardService contains a lot of private API's (as example: SBGetApplicationState, SBDimScreen etc). I got the list of these methods using "nm" tool. I want to find a tool which will let me get signatures for these private API methods. As I understand SBGetApplicationState is a C call (vs Objective C method). So I am not sure whether it's possible to recover signatures without disassembling and additional manual actions. However, I hope that at least semi-automated process exist. Several notes: a) I have seen this link (iOS Runtime private headers): https://github.com/nst/iOS-Runtime-Headers It contains only Objective C headers. b) I have seen this link (SpringBoard.app/MIG subsystem) http://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/SpringBoard.app/MIG_subsystem It contains some interesting information, but the documentation is a little bit outdate (for iOS 3.1-4.2) c) I am doing a research and I don't plan to submit any application to AppStore. I am well aware of AppStore rejections based on usage of private API's

@TITLE:HTTPS with URL rewriting is not working on appharbor
@CONTENT:I have built an application on asp.net 3.5 which is hosted on AppHarbor. The problem is that on HTTPS URL rewriting is not working. The following is the code to run some of the pages on SSL: string CurrentUrl = Request.Url.ToString();
string sPath = System.Web.HttpContext.Current.Request.Url.AbsolutePath;      
System.IO.FileInfo oInfo = new System.IO.FileInfo(sPath);
string sRet = oInfo.Name;

pageName = sRet;

    string NewUrl = "";

    if (!Request.IsSecureConnection && !string.Equals(HttpContext.Current.Request.Headers["X-Forwarded-Proto"], "https", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
    {
        NewUrl = Regex.Replace(CurrentUrl,

        Response.Redirect(NewUrl);
    }
}
 And the rule for URL rewrite on web.config: <rewrite>
  <rules>
    <rule name="Rewrite with .aspx" stopProcessing="true">
      <match url="^([^\.]+)$" />

@CONTENT:Regarding Listbox to ListView migration. Hello. I have a Listbox I add entries like this to: 1;content Where 1 is always an int and content is always a string. I can access each one seperately. Now I want the result to be sorted descendingly, ie: 1;content
4;content2

1;content
 As this doesn't look good, I want to use a Listview instead. Like this: Frequency | Content

4 | content2
2 | content3
1 | content
 Problem is, the tabular property does not seem to exist, all entries are being put in like symbols in a listview in explorer. Also I have problems "reaching" the 2nd column(content), ie I only see 4,2,1. How would I prepare and populate a listview in c# .net 4 for that?

 All I understand is these lines compile .cpp files into .o, after 'print-opts', with 'cc-command'. But I don't understand the semantics. If I expand the macro of 'OBJS', this line should be: $(SRCS:$(SRC)/%.cpp=$(OBJ)/%.o) : $(OBJ)/%.o: $(SRC)/%.cpp | print-opts

 To me, it looks like in '$(SRCS:$(SRC)/%.cpp=$(OBJ)/%.o)', it claims all .cpp in $(SRC) would come to .o in $(OBJ), but this would depend on $(OBJ)/%.o, which depends on $(SRC)/%.cpp. This doesn't make sense... I don't understand what is the meaning of equal sign here, and what multiple colons mean.

                                         [NSNumber numberWithBool:NO], AVLinearPCMIsFloatKey,

                                         nil];

        output = [[AVAssetReaderAudioMixOutput alloc] initWithAudioTracks:uasset.tracks audioSettings:outputSettings];
        [reader addOutput:output];
...
 And I grab the data thusly: CMSampleBufferRef ref= [output copyNextSampleBuffer];
    // NSLog(@"%@",ref);
    if(ref==NULL)
        return;
    //copy data to file
    //read next one
    AudioBufferList audioBufferList;
    NSMutableData *data = [NSMutableData data];
    CMBlockBufferRef blockBuffer;
    CMSampleBufferGetAudioBufferListWithRetainedBlockBuffer(ref, NULL, &audioBufferList, sizeof(audioBufferList), NULL, NULL, 0, &blockBuffer);
    // NSLog(@"%@",blockBuffer);

    if(blockBuffer==NULL)
    {
        [data release];
        return;
    }
    if(&audioBufferList==NULL)
    {
        [data release];
        return;
    }

    //stash data in same object
    for( int y=0; y<audioBufferList.mNumberBuffers; y++ )
    {
//        NSData* throwData;
        AudioBuffer audioBuffer = audioBufferList.mBuffers[y];
        [self.delegate streamer:self didGetAudioBuffer:audioBuffer];
        /*
        Float32 *frame = (Float32*)audioBuffer.mData;
        throwData = [NSData dataWithBytes:audioBuffer.mData length:audioBuffer.mDataByteSize];
        [self.delegate streamer:self didGetAudioBuffer:throwData];
        [data appendBytes:audioBuffer.mData length:audioBuffer.mDataByteSize];
         */
    }
 which eventually brings us to the audio queue, set up in this way: //Apple's own code for canonical PCM
    audioDesc.mSampleRate       = 44100.0;
    audioDesc.mFormatID         = kAudioFormatLinearPCM;
    audioDesc.mFormatFlags      = kAudioFormatFlagsAudioUnitCanonical;
    audioDesc.mBytesPerPacket   = 2 * sizeof (AudioUnitSampleType);    // 8
    audioDesc.mFramesPerPacket  = 1;
    audioDesc.mBytesPerFrame    = 1 * sizeof (AudioUnitSampleType);    // 8
    audioDesc.mChannelsPerFrame = 2;
    audioDesc.mBitsPerChannel   = 8 * sizeof (AudioUnitSampleType);    // 32


err = AudioQueueNewOutput(&audioDesc, handler_OSStreamingAudio_queueOutput, self, NULL, NULL, 0, &audioQueue);
    if(err){
#pragma warning  handle error
//never errs, am using breakpoint to check
        return;
    }
 and we enqueue thusly while (inNumberBytes)
        {
            size_t bufSpaceRemaining = kAQDefaultBufSize - bytesFilled;
            if (bufSpaceRemaining < inNumberBytes)
            {
                AudioQueueBufferRef fillBuf = audioQueueBuffer[fillBufferIndex];
        fillBuf->mAudioDataByteSize = bytesFilled;
        err = AudioQueueEnqueueBuffer(audioQueue, fillBuf, 0, NULL);
            }


                bufSpaceRemaining = kAQDefaultBufSize - bytesFilled;
                size_t copySize;
                if (bufSpaceRemaining < inNumberBytes)
                {
                    copySize = bufSpaceRemaining;
                }
                else
                {
                    copySize = inNumberBytes;
                }

                if (bytesFilled > packetBufferSize)
                {
                    return;
                }

                AudioQueueBufferRef fillBuf = audioQueueBuffer[fillBufferIndex];
                memcpy((char*)fillBuf->mAudioData + bytesFilled, (const char*)(inInputData + offset), copySize);


                bytesFilled += copySize;
                packetsFilled = 0;
                inNumberBytes -= copySize;
                offset += copySize;
            }
        }
 I tried to be as code inclusive as possible so as to make it easy for everyone to point out where I'm being a moron. That being said, I have a feeling my problem occurs either in the output settings declaration of the track reader or in the actual declaration of the AudioQueue (where I describe to the queue what kind of audio I'm going to be sending it). The fact of the matter is, I don't really know mathematically how to actually generate those numbers (bytes per packet, frames per packet, what have you). An explanation of that would be greatly appreciated, and thanks for the help in advance.

@TITLE:How does phpMyAdmin Export work?
@CONTENT:Couldn't find a good answer to my question anywhere. If I were to want to create a php function that does the same thing as the Export tab in phpMyAdmin, how could I do it? I don't know if there is a mysql function that does this or if phpMyAdmin just builds the export file (in SQL that is) manually. Without shell access. Just using php. I tried the documentation for mysqldump, but that seemed to require using the shell (which I'm not quite sure what that even is -- maybe my question is How the heck do you use shell?). My silly idea (aren't they all?) is to allow non-technical users to build a site on one server (say a localhost) using MySQL then export the site, database and all, to another server (eg. a remote server). I think I'm pretty clear on the Import process. Please help.

@LINK:/questions/11374585/why-asp-net-session-is-expired-sooner-than-its-timeout
@TITLE:Why asp.net session is expired sooner than its timeout?
@CONTENT:I have an Asp.net webservice. It has method M1. M1 creates a folder for each session. When a session is expired, I delete that folder in global.asax using the following code. void Session_End(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        try
        {
            System.IO.DirectoryInfo dirMyPacksFolder = new System.IO.DirectoryInfo(Utilities.getMyPacksFolder(Session));
            //dirMyPacksFolder.Parent.CreateSubdirectory("ended_" + Session.SessionID);
            if (dirMyPacksFolder.Exists)
            {
                dirMyPacksFolder.Delete(true);
            }
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Utilities.logException("", ex);
        }
    }
 When I open my webservice in browser and call M1, it operates correctly and the folder is deleted on timeout expiration time that I have set. But when I submit "Invoke" button of webservice for the second time (after session timeout and folder is deleted), its session starts (create folder) and ends (deletes folder) immediately before timeout that I have set. Why this happens? If I open a new window (new session) for each method call everything is OK. But I have problem when I click "Invoke" button for second time. It is something like caching problem for same sessions.
@CODE:void Session_End(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        try
        {
            System.IO.DirectoryInfo dirMyPacksFolder = new System.IO.DirectoryInfo(Utilities.getMyPacksFolder(Session));

@CONTENT:App doesn't load an Image from an HTTPS URL when run on the emulator. Sample code: URL url = new URL("https://someserver.com/photo.jpg");
mImageView.setImageBitmap(BitmapFactory.decodeStream(url.openStream()));
 The image loads just fine when run on an actual device. Also the emulator loads the image if it's accessed via HTTP instead of HTTPS. Am I doing something wrong or is this a known issue?

@LINK:/questions/11372248/inbreeding-immune-database-structure
@TITLE:Inbreeding-immune database structure
@CONTENT:I have an application that requires a "simple" family tree. I would like to be able to perform queries that will give me data for an entire family given one id from a member in the family. I say simple because it does not need to take into account adoption or any other obscurities. The requirements for the application are as follows: Any two people will not be able to breed if they're from the same genetic line Needs to allow for the addition of new family lines (new people with no previous family) Need to be able to pull siblings, parents separately through queries I'm having trouble coming up with the proper structure for the database. So far I've come up with two solutions but they're not very reliable and will probably get out of hand quite quickly. Solution 1 involves placing a family_ids field on the people table and storing a list of unique family ids. Each time two people breed the lists are checked against each other to make sure no ids match and if everything checks out will merge the two lists and set that as the child's family_ids field. Example: Father (family_ids: (null)) breeds with Mother (family_ids: (213, 519)) ->
Child (family_ids: (213, 519)) breeds with Random Person (family_ids: (813, 712, 122, 767)) ->
Grandchild (family_ids: (213, 519, 813, 712, 122, 767))
 And so on and so forth... The problem I see with this is the lists becoming unreasonably large as time goes on. Solution 2 uses cakephp's associations to declare: public $belongsTo = array(
    'Father' => array(
        'className' => 'User',
        'foreignKey' => 'father_id'
    ),
    'Mother' => array(
        'className' => 'User',
        'foreignKey' => 'mother_id'
    )
);
 Now setting recursive to 2 will fetch the results of the mother and father, along with their mother and father, and so on and so forth all the way down the line. The problem with this route is that the data is in nested arrays and I'm unsure of how to efficiently work through the code. If anyone would be able to steer me in the direction of the most efficient way to handle what I want to achieve that would be tremendously helpful. Any and all help is greatly appreciated and I'll gladly answer any questions anyone has. Thanks a lot.

@TITLE:Zend Framework 2 MVC - Modules Route mapping not working
@CONTENT:I try to follow Akrabats Tutorial the Application/Index is working, the Album part not. I tried it also with the ZendSkeletonModule with no luck. The error in both cases is: album/album (resolves to invalid controller class or alias: album/album) I tried it with ZF2 master and beta4 tag (but beta4 tag gives php error about missing method getEventManager) I took the code from Akrabats Tutorial, and after that failed used the code form the GitHub Repo. Unfortunatly there isnt some Forum or Comment section to ask for help. I found some diffrences in the tutorial and the Skeleton (zfcUser has the same diffrence) in the module.config.php (which i believe is the core of the problem). The tutorial uses classes in the controller index, zfcUser and the Skeleton using invokables but it doesnt seem to matter, as the error dont change. my module.config currently looks like this: <?php

@TITLE:Google Drive V2 Java API - Upload file to specific folder
@CONTENT:Following is the method adopted to upload file to specific folder using Gdrive V2 sdk. 1) insert file to root folder (Drive.Files.insert(File,AbstractInputStream) 2) Delete the root parent reference of the new uploaded file 3) Add the specific target folder as the new parent reference to the file. The above works. But, if network is slow, we see the file sitting at the Root folder for quite some time before it moves to the specific target folder. How can we avoid this? Can we batch all the above three operations? But AFAIK, batching is supported for operations of a particular type like..we can batch only all Files operations or Parent operations or Revision operations. Can we batch operations belonging to different types, for example (Files.insert() and Parent.delete())? Inputs will be appreciated. Thanks!!

@CONTENT:so.. i run into a possibly very common problem. just started implementing google maps api, and following is my code to resolve a city into lat/lang and center the map there: function SetMapAddress(address) {  // "London, UK" for example 
  var geocoder = new google.maps.Geocoder();
  if (geocoder) {
     geocoder.geocode({ 'address': address }, function (results, status) {

        document.map.setCenter(new google.maps.LatLng(loc.lat(),loc.lng(), 13));
     }
 the problem is that i am passing a static zoom (13). if someone types a name of a country, i'd like to zoom out more. if it is a city, i'd like to zoom in more etc.. the only thing i can think of is to figure out appropriate zoom for every city and country, store them in some hash, and try to figure out which is being used, to pass appropriate zoom. maybe google thought of a more intelligent approach ?

@TITLE:Apps must follow the iOS Data Storage Guidelines, nothing in /documents but still some kbs sent to iCloud
@CONTENT:My app got rejected with for the following reason : Your app does not follow the iOS Data Storage Guidelines, as required by the App Store Review Guidelines. Your app backs up 4.0 MB of data to each user's iCloud space on launch. Please be sure to set the "Do not back up" attribute for all data which is not generated or modified by the user. To check how much data your app is storing: Install and launch your app Go to Settings > iCloud > Storage and Backup > Manage Storage If necessary, select "Show all apps" Check your app's storage The iOS Data Storage Guidelines indicate that only content that the user creates using your app, (documents, new files, edits, etc.) may be stored in the /Documents directory - and backed up to iCloud. Temporary files used by your app should only be stored in the /tmp directory. Please remember to delete the files stored in this location when the user exits the app. Data that can be recreated but must persist for proper functioning of your app or because customers expect it to be available for offline use should be appended with the "do not back up" attribute. For NSURL objects, add the NSURLIsExcludedFromBackupKey attribute to prevent the corresponding file from being backed up. For CFURLRef objects, use the corresponding kCFURLIsExcludedFromBackupKey attribute. From what I understand, everything that is stored in the /documents folder will be stored in iCloud, and this folder should only contain data that was generated by the user. Now, I've moved all my files that were in /documents into the cache folder. However when I test the app with a device, there's still about 28kb sent into iCloud (and there is nothing in the /documents folder of that device's app sandbox, according to Organizer). My project doesn't support iCloud, so I don't understand what's being sent when there's nothing in the documents. Is there a way to check what exactly is being sent into iCloud? Also, my project right now targets iOS 5.0. From what I understand in 5.0 there is nothing in place to prevent an eventual purge of the cache folder. Should I only support >= 5.0.1?

@TITLE:video-steganography in java
@CONTENT:I need to create steganographic videos (videos with data hidden in them) for my project. I need to carry this out by extracting all the frames from a video and then hiding data in the selected frames by replacing bits in the LSB of the pixel color value and then encoding all the frames to create a new video(note here that lossless formats are required otherwise I might end up losing hidden data). My research motivated me to use xuggler for manipulating videos, 'png' format to save the extracted images as it is a lossless format(handling them as BufferedImage objects), and using 'avi' video files. As of now I am able to extract all frames from a video and encode my hidden data in the lsb's. But I am having problems in creating the new avi video file using xuggler. When I extract the frames from the new video they lose the hidden data. I don't understand how to get this right and keep the data intact. This could be due to some lossy compression technique being used to create the new video.The size of the new video does not matter to me. I also can't find the correct codec_id to create the new video. I am extensively using xuggler tutorial available on wiki. decode and capture frames http://build.xuggle.com/view/Stable/job/xuggler_jdk5_stable/ws/workingcopy/src/com/xuggle/mediatool/demos/DecodeAndCaptureFrames.java I can post my code as required...

@TITLE:encrypting and/or decrypting large files (AES) on a memory and storage constrained system, with catastrophe recovery
@CONTENT:I have a fairly generic question, so please pardon if it is a bit vague. So, let's a assume a file of 1GB, that needs to be encrypted and later decrypted on a given system. Problem is that the system has less than 512 mb of free memory and about 1.5 GB storage space (give or take), so, with the file "onboard" we have about ~500 MB of "hard drive scratch space" and less than 512 mb RAM to "play with". The system is not unlikely to experience an "unscheduled power down" at any moment during encryption or decryption, and needs to be able to successfully resume the encryption/decryption process after being powered up again (and this seems like an extra-unpleasant nut to tackle). The questions are: 1) is it at all doable :) ? 2) what would be the best strategy to go about a) encrypting/decrypting with so little scratch space (can't have the entire file lying around while decrypting/encrypting, need to truncate it "on the fly" somehow...) and b) implementing a disaster recovery that would work in such a constrained environment? P.S.: The cipher used has to be AES. I looked into AES-CTR specifically but it does not seem to bode all that well for the disaster recovery shenanigan in an environment where you can't keep the entire decrypted file around till the end... [edited to add] I think I'll be doing it the Iserni way after all.

@TITLE:Force UITableView to scroll to top?
@CONTENT:How would you go about forcing a UITableViewCell to scroll to the top if the tableview contains less than 10 or so cells? I support editing of Managed Object Contexts within my tableView cells while the tableview is in editing mode. Needless to say, if a cell is at the bottom of the tableview, it gets blocked by the keyboard when a user goes to edit the title or location of an event. I tried a solution like: -(void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath*)indexPath
{
    [tableView deselectRowAtIndexPath:indexPath animated:NO];

    if(_selectedIndex == indexPath.row){
        _selectedIndex = -1;
        [tableView reloadRowsAtIndexPaths:[NSArray arrayWithObject:indexPath]
                         withRowAnimation:UITableViewRowAnimationFade];
        return;
    }

    if(_selectedIndex >= 0){
        NSIndexPath *previous = [NSIndexPath indexPathForRow:_selectedIndex inSection:0];
        _selectedIndex = indexPath.row;
        [tableView reloadRowsAtIndexPaths:[NSArray arrayWithObject:previous]
                         withRowAnimation:UITableViewRowAnimationFade];
    }

    _selectedIndex = indexPath.row;
    [tableView reloadRowsAtIndexPaths:[NSArray arrayWithObject:indexPath]
                     withRowAnimation:UITableViewRowAnimationFade];

    [tableView setContentOffset:CGPointMake(0, [tableView rowHeight]*indexPath.row) animated:YES];
}
 But this does not keep the tableview at the contentOffset. it will snap to the top and then snap back
@CODE:-(void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath*)indexPath
{
    [tableView deselectRowAtIndexPath:indexPath animated:NO];

    if(_selectedIndex == indexPath.row){
        _selectedIndex = -1;
        [tableView reloadRowsAtIndexPaths:[NSArray arrayWithObject:indexPath]

@LINK:/questions/11251826/java-communication-fails-through-web-proxy-using-apache-httpclient
@TITLE:Java communication fails through web proxy using Apache HttpClient
@CONTENT:I have a desktop client that sends data to a web server and I can't seem to get through the proxy server. Update: I am getting a 407 HTTP error when trying to communicate through the proxy. When downloading information from my web server, everything is fine. Once the user configures the proxy server (using a dialog box I wrote) the download works fine. But uploading data using org.apache.http.client.HttpClient is not working. I am configuring the proxy server with code like this after gathering the information from a JDialog.         System.setProperty("http.proxyHost", proxyHost);
        System.setProperty("http.proxyPort", "" + portNumber);
 Now, once we do that, simple downloads work fine. For instance, I have code that reads some xml data from my web server (see below). On the customer's network the error in my catch block was displayed before the proxy settings were configured and then everything worked fine once the correct proxy was set. /**
 * Loads a collection of exams from the web site. The URL is determined by
 * configuration or registration since it is State specific.
 */
public static int importExamsWS(StringBuilder msg) {
    try {
        java.net.URL onlineExams = new URL(examURL);
        //Parse the XML data from InputStream and store it.
        return importExams(onlineExams.openStream(), msg);

    } 
    catch (java.net.UnknownHostException noDNS) {
        showError(noDNS, "Unable to connect to proctinator.com to download the exam file.\n"
                + "There is probably a problem with your Internet proxy settings.");
    }
    catch (MalformedURLException | IOException duh) {
        showFileError(duh);
    }
    return 0;
}
 However, when I try to SEND data to the web server it is as if the proxy settings are being ignored and an IOException gets thrown. Namely: org.apache.http.conn.HttpHostConnectException: Connection to http://proctinator.com:8080 refused
 Now I know that port 8080 is not blocked by the customer's web filter because we tested the address in a web browser. Here is my code for verifying the registration ID entered by the user: Update: Now I am also setting the proxy in this method. //Registered is just an enum with ACTIVE, INACTIVE, NOTFOUND, ERROR
public static Registered checkRegistration(int id) throws IOException {    
    httpclient = new DefaultHttpClient();
    Config pref = Config.getConfig(); //stores user-entered proxy settings.
    HttpHost proxy = new HttpHost(pref.getProxyServer(), pref.getProxyPort());
    httpclient.getParams().setParameter(ConnRoutePNames.DEFAULT_PROXY, proxy);
    URIBuilder builder = new URIBuilder();
    String path = "/Proctorest/rsc/register/" + id;
    try {
        builder.setScheme("http").setHost(server).setPort(8080).setPath(path);
        URI uri = builder.build();
        System.out.println("Connecting to " + uri.toString());
        HttpGet httpget = new HttpGet(uri);
        HttpResponse response = httpclient.execute(httpget);
        System.out.println(response.getStatusLine().toString());
        if(response.getStatusLine().getStatusCode()==200) {
            String msg = EntityUtils.toString(response.getEntity());
            GUI.globalLog.log(Level.INFO, "Server response to checkRegistration(" + id + "): " + msg);
            return Registered.stringToRegistered(msg);
        }
        else {
            GUI.globalLog.log(Level.INFO, "Server response status code to checkRegistration: " + 
                    response.getStatusLine().getStatusCode());
            return Registered.ERROR;
        }
    }
    catch(java.net.URISyntaxException bad) {
        System.out.println("URI construction error: " + bad.toString());
        return Registered.ERROR;
    }
}
 I'm almost positive that the problem is coming from the proxy server configuration, yet the docs for SystemDefaultHttpClient claim that it takes uses System properties for http.proxyHost and http.proxyPort . I know that the properties have been properly set, but I am still getting this authentication error. Viewing the logs generated from my program showed me this: checkRegistration INFO: Server response status code to checkRegistration: 407 
 How do I resolve this authentication error?

However when I test the app with a device, there's still about 28kb sent into iCloud (and there is nothing in the /documents folder of that device's app sandbox, according to Organizer). My project doesn't support iCloud, so I don't understand what's being sent when there's nothing in the documents. Is there a way to check what exactly is being sent into iCloud? Also, my project right now targets iOS 5.0. From what I understand in 5.0 there is nothing in place to prevent an eventual purge of the cache folder. Should I only support >= 5.0.1?

@TITLE:video-steganography in java
@CONTENT:I need to create steganographic videos (videos with data hidden in them) for my project. I need to carry this out by extracting all the frames from a video and then hiding data in the selected frames by replacing bits in the LSB of the pixel color value and then encoding all the frames to create a new video(note here that lossless formats are required otherwise I might end up losing hidden data). My research motivated me to use xuggler for manipulating videos, 'png' format to save the extracted images as it is a lossless format(handling them as BufferedImage objects), and using 'avi' video files. As of now I am able to extract all frames from a video and encode my hidden data in the lsb's. But I am having problems in creating the new avi video file using xuggler. When I extract the frames from the new video they lose the hidden data. I don't understand how to get this right and keep the data intact. This could be due to some lossy compression technique being used to create the new video.The size of the new video does not matter to me. I also can't find the correct codec_id to create the new video. I am extensively using xuggler tutorial available on wiki. decode and capture frames http://build.xuggle.com/view/Stable/job/xuggler_jdk5_stable/ws/workingcopy/src/com/xuggle/mediatool/demos/DecodeAndCaptureFrames.java I can post my code as required...

@TITLE:encrypting and/or decrypting large files (AES) on a memory and storage constrained system, with catastrophe recovery
@CONTENT:I have a fairly generic question, so please pardon if it is a bit vague. So, let's a assume a file of 1GB, that needs to be encrypted and later decrypted on a given system. Problem is that the system has less than 512 mb of free memory and about 1.5 GB storage space (give or take), so, with the file "onboard" we have about ~500 MB of "hard drive scratch space" and less than 512 mb RAM to "play with". The system is not unlikely to experience an "unscheduled power down" at any moment during encryption or decryption, and needs to be able to successfully resume the encryption/decryption process after being powered up again (and this seems like an extra-unpleasant nut to tackle). The questions are: 1) is it at all doable :) ? 2) what would be the best strategy to go about a) encrypting/decrypting with so little scratch space (can't have the entire file lying around while decrypting/encrypting, need to truncate it "on the fly" somehow...) and b) implementing a disaster recovery that would work in such a constrained environment? P.S.: The cipher used has to be AES. I looked into AES-CTR specifically but it does not seem to bode all that well for the disaster recovery shenanigan in an environment where you can't keep the entire decrypted file around till the end... [edited to add] I think I'll be doing it the Iserni way after all.

@TITLE:Force UITableView to scroll to top?
@CONTENT:How would you go about forcing a UITableViewCell to scroll to the top if the tableview contains less than 10 or so cells? I support editing of Managed Object Contexts within my tableView cells while the tableview is in editing mode. Needless to say, if a cell is at the bottom of the tableview, it gets blocked by the keyboard when a user goes to edit the title or location of an event. I tried a solution like: -(void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath*)indexPath
{
    [tableView deselectRowAtIndexPath:indexPath animated:NO];

    if(_selectedIndex == indexPath.row){
        _selectedIndex = -1;
        [tableView reloadRowsAtIndexPaths:[NSArray arrayWithObject:indexPath]
                         withRowAnimation:UITableViewRowAnimationFade];
        return;
    }

    if(_selectedIndex >= 0){
        NSIndexPath *previous = [NSIndexPath indexPathForRow:_selectedIndex inSection:0];
        _selectedIndex = indexPath.row;
        [tableView reloadRowsAtIndexPaths:[NSArray arrayWithObject:previous]
                         withRowAnimation:UITableViewRowAnimationFade];
    }

    _selectedIndex = indexPath.row;
    [tableView reloadRowsAtIndexPaths:[NSArray arrayWithObject:indexPath]
                     withRowAnimation:UITableViewRowAnimationFade];

    [tableView setContentOffset:CGPointMake(0, [tableView rowHeight]*indexPath.row) animated:YES];
}
 But this does not keep the tableview at the contentOffset. it will snap to the top and then snap back
@CODE:-(void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath*)indexPath
{
    [tableView deselectRowAtIndexPath:indexPath animated:NO];

    if(_selectedIndex == indexPath.row){

@LINK:/questions/11251826/java-communication-fails-through-web-proxy-using-apache-httpclient
@TITLE:Java communication fails through web proxy using Apache HttpClient
@CONTENT:I have a desktop client that sends data to a web server and I can't seem to get through the proxy server. Update: I am getting a 407 HTTP error when trying to communicate through the proxy. When downloading information from my web server, everything is fine. Once the user configures the proxy server (using a dialog box I wrote) the download works fine. But uploading data using org.apache.http.client.HttpClient is not working. I am configuring the proxy server with code like this after gathering the information from a JDialog.         System.setProperty("http.proxyHost", proxyHost);
        System.setProperty("http.proxyPort", "" + portNumber);
 Now, once we do that, simple downloads work fine. For instance, I have code that reads some xml data from my web server (see below). On the customer's network the error in my catch block was displayed before the proxy settings were configured and then everything worked fine once the correct proxy was set. /**
 * Loads a collection of exams from the web site. The URL is determined by
 * configuration or registration since it is State specific.
 */
public static int importExamsWS(StringBuilder msg) {
    try {
        java.net.URL onlineExams = new URL(examURL);
        //Parse the XML data from InputStream and store it.
        return importExams(onlineExams.openStream(), msg);

    } 
    catch (java.net.UnknownHostException noDNS) {
        showError(noDNS, "Unable to connect to proctinator.com to download the exam file.\n"
                + "There is probably a problem with your Internet proxy settings.");
    }
    catch (MalformedURLException | IOException duh) {
        showFileError(duh);
    }
    return 0;
}
 However, when I try to SEND data to the web server it is as if the proxy settings are being ignored and an IOException gets thrown. Namely: org.apache.http.conn.HttpHostConnectException: Connection to http://proctinator.com:8080 refused
 Now I know that port 8080 is not blocked by the customer's web filter because we tested the address in a web browser. Here is my code for verifying the registration ID entered by the user: Update: Now I am also setting the proxy in this method. //Registered is just an enum with ACTIVE, INACTIVE, NOTFOUND, ERROR
public static Registered checkRegistration(int id) throws IOException {    
    httpclient = new DefaultHttpClient();
    Config pref = Config.getConfig(); //stores user-entered proxy settings.
    HttpHost proxy = new HttpHost(pref.getProxyServer(), pref.getProxyPort());
    httpclient.getParams().setParameter(ConnRoutePNames.DEFAULT_PROXY, proxy);
    URIBuilder builder = new URIBuilder();
    String path = "/Proctorest/rsc/register/" + id;
    try {
        builder.setScheme("http").setHost(server).setPort(8080).setPath(path);
        URI uri = builder.build();
        System.out.println("Connecting to " + uri.toString());
        HttpGet httpget = new HttpGet(uri);
        HttpResponse response = httpclient.execute(httpget);
        System.out.println(response.getStatusLine().toString());
        if(response.getStatusLine().getStatusCode()==200) {
            String msg = EntityUtils.toString(response.getEntity());
            GUI.globalLog.log(Level.INFO, "Server response to checkRegistration(" + id + "): " + msg);
            return Registered.stringToRegistered(msg);
        }
        else {
            GUI.globalLog.log(Level.INFO, "Server response status code to checkRegistration: " + 
                    response.getStatusLine().getStatusCode());
            return Registered.ERROR;

    catch(java.net.URISyntaxException bad) {
        System.out.println("URI construction error: " + bad.toString());
        return Registered.ERROR;
    }
}
 I'm almost positive that the problem is coming from the proxy server configuration, yet the docs for SystemDefaultHttpClient claim that it takes uses System properties for http.proxyHost and http.proxyPort . I know that the properties have been properly set, but I am still getting this authentication error. Viewing the logs generated from my program showed me this: checkRegistration INFO: Server response status code to checkRegistration: 407 
 How do I resolve this authentication error?

 Deletion is triggered by clicking on container/id/delete_confirmation however this fires more events than I was expecting. My subscribed function is called twice: once when I click on the link, then again when I confirm the deletion. Even more confusing, it's also called if I cancel the deletion. I was expecting the event to only be raised if an object was, y'know, removed from a container. In all three cases the event object is the same, with the same property values for oldName, oldParent etc. How can I distinguish between asking to delete an item, cancelling that request, and actually deleting an item? Update: so it seems the initial event is called because the object is removed from the container in order to check link integrity, at which point there's a rollback.

@CONTENT:There are many many posts and an infinite number of questions on how to create a custom row and add it to a ListView.

    (this,R.layout.row_layout,R.id.text1,colors);
 I was wondering if there isn't a way to do this in the XML files directly? Isn't there a property on the ListView where you can set a custom layout file for the rows? The reason I'm asking is because I'm trying to do all (most) of my layout work in the Graphical Layout tool in Eclipse and I would like to be able to preview my layouts in it without launching the app. Surely this should be possible in one way or another? If I could to it in the XML I would be very happy but if I have to write a custom class that will show up in the "custom" part of the graphical layout editor that will do as well. Many thanks for your time.

@TITLE:Reading Block of text file
@CONTENT:I have a text file in which a particular character repeats at the start of the line after every few lines. the no. of lines in between is not fixed. I am able to find out those lines where this condition occurs. I want to read those lines in between.  using (StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(@"text file"))
 {
     string line;
     while ((line = sr.ReadLine()) != null)
     {
         if (line.StartsWith("some character"))
 Because the next time, this character occurs, the code remains same. I am not able to read those lines in between For eg. Condition at the begining of a line
Next line
Next line
Condition at the begining of a line
Next Line

@TITLE:Secondary sorting in Map-Reduce
@CONTENT:I understood the way of sorting the values of a particular key before the key enters the reducer. I learned that it can be done by writing three methods viz, keycomparator, partitioner and valuegrouping. Now, when valuegrouping runs, it basically groups all the values associated with the natural key, right? So when it groups all the values for the natural key, what will be the actual key that is sent along with a set of sorted values to the reducer? The natural key would have been associated with more than one type of entity (the second part of the composite key). What will be the composite key sent to the reducer? ap

@TITLE:Sockets on Ubuntu (operation not permitted)
@CONTENT:I'm newbee and just making my first steps in c++ under linux. So I have some task about sockets. I'm following guides, especially this one. And code examples are not working. I started with this: #include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <errno.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <sys/un.h>

    int s, s2, t, len;
    struct sockaddr_un local, remote;
    char str[100];

    if ((s = socket(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0)) == -1) {
        perror("socket");
        exit(1);
    }

    local.sun_family = AF_UNIX;
    strcpy(local.sun_path, SOCK_PATH);
    unlink(local.sun_path);

        exit(1);
    }

 I've figured out that to compile it (Code::Blocks) there must be one more include: #include <unistd.h>

@TITLE:Trying to run a SELECT sql query based on the dropdown list result. mySQL php
@CONTENT:I haven't designed a website for about 3 years now, so I am quite rusty to say the least. I have to fall back on Dreamweaver CS5 to help me out. Right... I want a page for news, and the user/customer will select from a dropdown menu the date (JAN, FEB, MAR, APR etc...) Now, I have a table in my mySQL database called 'news' where each row is referenced by these dates. I have already set up a Dynamic List for the date (a dropdown list.) What I want is for the customer to select the date from the dropdown, and for the results to show in a Recordset underneath. I am assuming that the SQL query needs to be wrote something along the lines of: SELECT date, subject, message FROM news WHERE date = $ XXXXXDROPDOWNLIST XXX $ As you can see, I made the last line up because I can't quite grasp how it should function. I am thinking that the dropdown list needs to be in a form which will POST and the table of results needs to be in a form which will GET. Could somebody more technical than me please enlighten my dillema? Thanks, Rob. Code mysql_select_db($database_rcc, $rcc);
$query_dropdowndate = "SELECT DATE_FORMAT(date, '%M %Y') AS FORMATTEDDATE FROM news GROUP BY FORMATTEDDATE ORDER BY Date DESC  ";

 Some of this may look weird so let me explain... The dynamic list (dropdown) is called 'dropdowndate' and the form is called 'choosedate' There is a button called 'submit' to submit the form. FORMATTEDDATE is the name given to the recordset which gives the dropdown menu a dynamic list. I want the value from that dynamic list when user's POST, to insert into the query as i mentioned ... SELECT Date, Subject, Message FROM news WHERE date = $_POST['dropdowndate']"; (THIS BIT IS PROBABLY WRONG) Rob

@TITLE:How to detect and match a marker using OpenCV (Template Matching)
@CONTENT:I am using an image which holds a marker in a specific area. I tried to do it using Template matching which is the method defined in opencv as cvMatchTemplate. I am using a web cam to detect them, currently the program is detecting the marker, because I provided the same marker as template. But I cannot find a way to check whether it is the best match or just slightly matched. Because in cvMatchTemplate it is not only detecting the best match, it also keeps detecting the areas which are slightly matching. Can any one please tell me a way to do this. Or if there is any other way for my problem, please let me know! here is the link for my image card http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/266/piggycard.jpg/ (I want to detect and check whether its mached) here is the code // template_mching_test_2.cpp : Defines the entry point for the console application. // #include "stdafx.h"

}
 and as the template I provided the same marker which cropped from the original image. From minMaxLoc i took the max value to check the best match. but it is keep giving me the same values when the image marker in a position, And when the image marker is not in the frame and slightly matching at a place which previous matched with the marker.Does minMaxloc giving us the coordinates(position) of the marker or matching percentage.Or is there any other way for this. Thank you for your consideration.

@TITLE:MVC3 + WordPress IIS Url Rewriting Rules
@CONTENT:I have a ASP.NET MVC3 website located at http://mydomain.com/mymvcapp/. However, the root of the webiste (mydomain.com) contains a WordPress site running PHP. Therefore, I put the following IIS URL Rewrite rule to allow WordPress to function correctly via its rewriting mechanisms:     <rewrite>
        <rules>
            <rule name="wordpress" patternSyntax="Wildcard">
                <match url="*" />
                <conditions>
                    <add input="{REQUEST_FILENAME}" matchType="IsFile" negate="true" />
                    <add input="{REQUEST_FILENAME}" matchType="IsDirectory" negate="true" />
                </conditions>
                <action type="Rewrite" url="index.php"/>
            </rule>     
        </rules>
    </rewrite>
 So with this rule in place my WordPress functions perfectly, however, my MVC rewriting does NOT work. How would I alter this rule to allow both WordPress and MVC (under the /mymvcapp/ folder) to coexist nicely?
@CODE:<rewrite>
        <rules>
            <rule name="wordpress" patternSyntax="Wildcard">
                <match url="*" />
                <conditions>
                    <add input="{REQUEST_FILENAME}" matchType="IsFile" negate="true" />
                    <add input="{REQUEST_FILENAME}" matchType="IsDirectory" negate="true" />
                </conditions>
                <action type="Rewrite" url="index.php"/>
            </rule>

@TITLE:jquery ajax cutting off response in IE
@CONTENT:I am using the jquery form plugin which uses jquery ajax to do most of its work. We have jquery 1.7.2 We are using it to send a form via ajax to the server and either return a value indiciating success or return the form with validation errors. I have it working in firefox and chrome when an error is found in validation the contents of a div containing the old form are replaced with the new one that has the errors. $('#FormDiv').empty().html(response); The reponse would look something like the following: <form action="/MyForm/Edit" id="MyForm" method="post"><input id="Id" name="Id" type="hidden" value="" />
    <input id="PlantId" name="PlantId" type="hidden" value="1" />
    <table>
        <tr><td class="field">
                ID
            </td>
            <td>
                <input class="required" id="MyId" name="MyName" type="text" value="JP001" />

            </td>
            <td class="field">Description</td>   
            <td><input class="required" id="Description" name="Description" type="text" value="" />

            <td class="field">Created by</td>
            <td>Joe Bloggs</td>

            <td>15/06/2012</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</form>
 Debugging in IE the I can see that the ajax call actually has this in its return body however the parameter to my method is removing the outer form starting and ending tags so essentially it is just a table. I have tried a few different things to try and figure this out including setting processData to false (not sure if that would really affect it anyway) and setting the returnType to "text" and "html" but none really helped. Any ideas? So it turns out that if i wrap the form in a div everything seems to work ok, not quite sure whats going on there, if anyone can explain this they can have the answer
@CODE:<form action="/MyForm/Edit" id="MyForm" method="post"><input id="Id" name="Id" type="hidden" value="" />
    <input id="PlantId" name="PlantId" type="hidden" value="1" />

@TITLE:How to get the pid of a process that is listening on a certain port programmatically?
@CONTENT:I have to write a SNMP module which monitor a certain server application that I have written too. The problem is that I have to know if this application is running and I should be able to kill it whenever I can. I know the port where the application is listening (reading the application configuration file) and I can try to bind this port to a socket in order to know if it is (or isn't) being used by my application or another which is enough for my module. Here is the code: int
get_server_status()
{
        struct sockaddr_in local;
        int port,sockfd;

        if (parse_config_file(&port,NULL,CONFIG_FILE_PATH) == -1)
                return -1; //Error

        if ((sockfd = socket ( AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0 )) < 0)
                return -1; //Error

        local.sin_family = AF_INET;
        local.sin_port = htons ( port );
        local.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr ("127.0.0.1");

        if (bind(sockfd, (struct sockaddr *) &local, sizeof (local) ) < 0 ){
                if(errno == EADDRINUSE)
                        return 1; //Port being used
                else
                        return -1; //Error
        }else{
                close(sockfd);
                return 0;         //Port not being used

        }
}
 The problem comes when I need to kill the application, I don't know neither its PID nor how to get it. I can get is using netstat -tln <port>but I don't know how to do it programmatically. Any ideas??

 As you can see a very simple example, user clicks the login link, goes to the login page where they login with Google Authentication and redirected back to the unsecured home page. When the user gets back to the home page the expected behavior is that "Who is logged in" returns either admin/user/anonymous but all I get is anonymous, the logout url isn't added or the admin url for an admin user. If I make the login normal http then if I have a secure route to say /admin that request receives a 401 Error. This code only works when I make make everything HTTPS. I know others are using secure login pages and still able to access the user information on unsecure pages. I believe this has to do with how the cookie is being set, but I am at a loss at what I'm doing wrong.

@TITLE:Why doesn't Android Facebook interface work with Fragments?
@CONTENT:I'm switching some Android Facebook code from an Activity to a Fragment. Prior to the switch everything worked fine, but now the onComplete() callback is not being executed. Does the Facebook code not work with Fragments, or am I doing something wrong? Here's the original code (in a SherlockActivity): if (!mFacebook.isSessionValid()) {
    mFacebook.authorize(MyActivity.this, permissions, new DialogListener() {
        @Override
        public void onComplete(Bundle values) { ... }    // CALLED AS EXPECTED
    }
}
 And here's the new code (in a SherlockFragment): if (!mFacebook.isSessionValid()) {
    mFacebook.authorize(getActivity(), permissions, new DialogListener() {
        @Override
        public void onComplete(Bundle values) { ... }    // DOES NOT GET CALLED
    }
}
 Both the Activity and the Fragment include the same onActivityResult() as required by Facebook: @Override
public void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
    super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);
    mFacebook.authorizeCallback(requestCode, resultCode, data);
}
 Thanks for your help! EDIT: A similar question is asked here, where the accepted answer is to change the Fragment to a FragmentActivity. But I don't see how this helps, as then it's no longer a Fragment (which I need for other reasons). Suggestions? EDIT 2: I rolled my own solution. See below.

 I noticed that this URL provides background information but doesn't solve my issue: Milliseconds puzzle when calling strptime in R. Also this URL touches on the issue but doesn't solve it: R xts: .001 millisecond in index. In these cases I do see the following: > x <- as.POSIXlt("13:29:56.061", format='%H:%M:%OS', tz='UTC')
> print(as.numeric(x), digits=20)
[1] 1339075796.0610001087
 The URL also seems to indicate that this is just a display issue but I've noticed that using statements like "%OS3" without the options line don't seem to pickup the correct number of digits. The version I'm using is 32 bit 2.15.0 under Windows but this seems to exist under other situations for R. Note that my original data is these date time strings within a CSV file I must find a way of converting them into the correct millisecond time from a string.

@TITLE:The puzzle of Liars
@CONTENT:I have been trying to solve a puzzle in Interviewstreet. But I don't have a clue for the problem by now. It'll be great if someone can give me a hint. The puzzle is: You have N soldiers numbered from 1 to N. Each of your soldiers is either a liar or a truthful person. You have M sets of information about them. The information is of the following form: Each line contains 3 integers - A, B and C. This means that in the set of soldiers numbered as {A, A+1, A+2, ..., B}, exactly C of them are liars. There are M lines like the above. Let L be the total number of your liar soldiers. Since you can't find the exact value of L, you want to find the minimum and maximum value of L. Input: The first line of the input contains two integers N and M. Each of next M lines contains three integers - A, B and C (1 <= Ai <= Bi <= n) and (0 <= Ci <= Bi-Ai). where Ai, B i and C i refers to the values of A, B and C in the ith line respectively N and M are not more than 101, and it is guaranteed the given informations are satisfiable. You can always find a situation that satisfies the given information . Output: Print two integers Lmin and Lmax to the output. Sample Input 3 2

 Sample Output 1 2

7 9 2
10 13 3
7 16 7
14 19 4
 Sample Output 13 14
 Explanation In the first sample testcase the first line is "3 2", meaning that there are 3 soldiers and we have two sets of information. The first information is that in the set of soldiers {1, 2} one is a liar and the second piece of information is that in the set of soldiers {2,3} again there is one liar. Now there are two possibilities for this scenario: Soldiers number 1 and 3 are liars or soldier number 2 is liar. So the minimum number of liars is 1 and maximum number of liars is 2. Hence the answer, 1 2.

I got the program to take the screenshot and open a file dialog box to save it, the saving works. The issue is that no matter how I save the screenshot, the saved image has significant quality loss and pixelates around text and stuff. This is a massive issue because I need the image to save exactly as it is seen on the users screen, I cannot have ANY quality loss at all. I tried to save the image as a jpg and a png and both gave me quality loss. I was wondering if anyone could point me towards some code or a method that would allow me to save the screenshots at the same quality as the users screen. I would like to save the image as a JPG or a PNG if possible. Any help would greatly be appreciated!

@CONTENT:I'm going mad trying to get a spinner to appear. I've bound my heavy processing function to a button thus: $(document).delegate("#clearread", "tap", onClearRead);
 So on tap it calls this: var onClearRead = function() {

setTimeout($.mobile.showPageLoadingMsg, 5);  

// Civilised cleaning of saved status
var jStorIndex = $.jStorage.index();
for (var i = 0; i < jStorIndex.length; i++) {

        $.jStorage.deleteKey(jStorIndex[i]);
    }
}   

// Load articles afresh
loadArticles();

$.mobile.changePage("#choosearticle");

} //onClearRead
 I find that the spinner does not appear during the clearing/loading of articles (about 10 secs) but only for a brief period while the #choosearticle page loads (0.5 secs). What am I doing wrong? I have the spinner working elsewhere in the app. Thanks

Update: According the apple documentation, this method is responsible for dismissing the iAD. but this method is still not working in my code. Any sample or how this method works? - (void)cancelBannerViewAction Explanation: A banner view action can cover your applications user interface. However, your application continues to run, and receives events normally. If your application receives an event that requires the users attention, it can programmatically cancel the action and uncover its interface by calling cancelBannerViewAction. Canceling actions frequently can cause a loss of revenue for your application. Reference from Apple But still I am unable to execute? This method is not working properly

@TITLE:iOS encryption AES128/CBC/nopadding why is not working?
@CONTENT:I have an app that needs to encode some data using AES/CBC/no padding. The app is ported also on android. There the encoding is done like this: byte[] encodedKey = getKey();
    SecretKeySpec skeySpec = new SecretKeySpec(encodedKey, "AES");
    AlgorithmParameterSpec paramSpec = new IvParameterSpec(initializationVector);

    Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/CBC/NoPadding");

    int blockSize = cipher.getBlockSize();

    System.out.println("Current size: " + decrypted.length);
    if (diffSize != 0) {
      diffSize = blockSize - diffSize;
      byte[] oldDecrypted = decrypted;
      decrypted = new byte[decrypted.length + diffSize];
      System.arraycopy(oldDecrypted, 0, decrypted, 0, oldDecrypted.length);
      for (int i = 0; i < diffSize; i++) {
        decrypted[i + oldDecrypted.length] = " ".getBytes()[0];
      }
      System.out.println("New size: " + decrypted.length);

    }
    return cipher.doFinal(decrypted);
 the initializationVector looks like this: private byte[] initializationVector = new byte[] { 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00 };
 on iOS i have something like this for encryption: - (NSData *)AES128EncryptWithKey:(NSString *)key 
{
    // 'key' should be 16 bytes for AES128, will be null-padded otherwise
    char keyPtr[kCCKeySizeAES128+1]; // room for terminator (unused)
    bzero(keyPtr, sizeof(keyPtr)); // fill with zeroes (for padding)


    // fetch key data
    [key getCString:keyPtr maxLength:sizeof(keyPtr) encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];

    NSUInteger dataLength = [self length];

    //See the doc: For block ciphers, the output size will always be less than or 
    //equal to the input size plus the size of one block.
    //That's why we need to add the size of one block here

    void *buffer = malloc(bufferSize);

    size_t numBytesEncrypted = 0;

        return [NSData dataWithBytesNoCopy:buffer length:numBytesEncrypted];
    }

    free(buffer); //free the buffer;
    return nil;
}
 the method described above is part of a category over NSData. the method is called like this: NSData *data = [@"4915200456727" dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];
    NSData *cipher  = [data AES128EncryptWithKey:@"@x#zddXekZerBBw6"];
    NSString *ecriptedString = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%.*s", [cipher length], [cipher bytes]];
 the problem that i have is that i don't receive the same encrypted data on iOS and android. On iOS the encrypted data has 0 bytes in length. Could you give any pointers on how to encrypt a string using AES128 with CBC and no padding and perhaps an example? Thank you

@TITLE:Windows Azure Authentication for Bing Search in PHP
@CONTENT:I am trying to perform a Bing Search by using the Windows Azure Marketplace API, I have downloaded their guide and sample code. The code prepares a HTTPS request with basic authentication, however I am constantly getting the following error: Warning: file_get_contents(https://api.datamarket.azure.com/Data.ashx/Bing/SearchWeb/Web?Query=%27washburn%27&Adult=%27Off%27&$top=50&$format=Atom): failed to open stream: Connection refused The php code (from Microsoft's document): $context = stream_context_create(array(
    'http' => array(
    'proxy' => 'tcp://127.0.0.1:8888',
    'request_fulluri' => true,
    'header'  => "Authorization: Basic " . base64_encode($accountKey.":".$accountKey)
    )
));
 Does anyone know what is causing the error please? I have correctly set the $accountKey and I tested it in a browser. What puzzles me a little is 127.0.0.1:8888 and also base64_encode($accountKey.":".$accountKey) , how come you need the $accountKey both before and after the : while when using a browser you are supposed to leave the username blank and just input the account key into the password field?

 What I want is for my slickGrid to gather data, then have the div automatically resize to encompass the updated grid. Currently it appears that the div size must be set statically? If I don't set values for the height of div "myGrid", it just sets it's height to 0. I want the div to expand with the size of the grid it loads. The documentation for slickgrid on gitHub ( https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid/wiki/_pages ) is extremely limited (to be fair the author acknowledges this). I've also had a lot of trouble with this topic on google also. I know it's software specific, but really hoping we have some slickGrid Guru's out there as this tool seems amazing!

@TITLE:How to monitor that an application is opened?
@CONTENT:I'm implementing a desktop analytics application that needs to record the names and times of programs a user opens on the PC. It's a C# (WPF) application that starts when the user logs on and runs without a UI. For programs such as Word or IE it would also capture what document or Url they are viewing. Currently I have a working solution as follows: Install a Windows Hook for Mouse Down. When that event fires I use p-Invoke to "GetForegroundWindow" and then use the window handle to "GetWindowThreadProcessId", with the ProcessId I can get the System.Diagnostics.Process object containing the name, start time and argument start list. I maintain a history list so I only write a tracking entry if this processId/window handle combination has not been recorded before. This solution does work ok but requires the mouse hook which can get dropped by Windows without any notification or ability to problematically check if it is still hooked. Not to mention this implementation seems like a hack. If there is a better more straightforward approach please advise. Thanks.

@CONTENT:I've been trying to come up with a way to autorun a series of HTML pages that are hosted on a USB Flash Drive. These are all static pages, and are all linked to index.html in my flash drive's root. I tried setting up an autorun.inf file like this: [autorun]
open=index.html
 I have also tried this: [autorun]
shellexecute=index.html
 And I have tried this: [autorun]
open=wscript.exe autorun.vbs
 where autorun.vbs looks like this: Call WScript.CreateObject("WScript.Shell").Run("index.html", 1)
 So far, I've had no luck in getting the application to even show up on the autorun dialog. I even had a more robust autorun.inf similar to this one: [autorun]
shellexecute=index.html
label=Test Application
action=Start Test Application
shell\start=Start Application
shell\start\command=index.html
shell=start
 I switched out various shellexecute/open commands in a number of different configurations. I then stumbled upon a page during my research that said "Windows 7 no longer supports autorun.inf from flash drives." but there was no other information about this that I could find. Anyone have a solution? I only would like to insert the flash drive and have the webpage within opened without other user input. If I have to deal with an autoplay dialog that has a "Display page" button, that would also be fine. Edit: I also tried this link: Windows Autorun for an HTML file but it did not work either.

My security system is implemented so that every function is a role and you can dynamically make "user roles" these are stored in the DB and when somebody logs in all the (function)roles in that "user role" will be set in tomcat security as roles. So now I have this piece of code to check if my user can access the function:        public static void checkSecurity(final String function) {
    final FacesContext facesContext = FacesContext.getCurrentInstance();
    try {
        if (facesContext.getExternalContext().getRemoteUser() == null) {
            facesContext.getExternalContext().redirect("login.xhtml");
            return;
        }
        if (!facesContext.getExternalContext().isUserInRole(function)) {
            facesContext.getExternalContext().redirect("restricted.xhtml");
            return;
        }
    } catch (final Exception ex /* Mandatory "IOException e" will be caught + all other exceptions. */) {
        facesContext.getExternalContext().setResponseStatus(403); // HTTP Status 403: Forbidden. Can also throw 401.
        facesContext.responseComplete();
    }
}
 Now I have to call this SecurityUtil.checkSecurity("name_of_function"); in every method. But I want to have an annotation like this @CustomSecurity("function_name_role").    @Target(ElementType.METHOD)
   @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
   public @interface CustomSecurity {
     // Single Element called value.
      String value();
   }
 And when a method has this annotation the checkSecurity function automatically has to be performed. So I have to scan for this annotation at a point, or make some kind of actionlistener. JSF should have some options for this but all the forums I found on this don't really help. Does somebody has some ideas? EDIT: I tried this blog it works but only on an action of a component (and components don't render when you don't have the role). So how secure is this when people try to hack into the JSF structure. And I rather have it running on every method.         public class SecurityActionListener extends ActionListenerImpl implements ActionListener {

    private static final Logger LOGGER = FacesLogger.APPLICATION.getLogger();

    @SuppressWarnings("unused")
    @Override
    public void processAction(final ActionEvent event) {

        final FacesContext context = FacesContext.getCurrentInstance();
        final Application application = context.getApplication();
        final ConfigurableNavigationHandler navHandler = (ConfigurableNavigationHandler) application.getNavigationHandler();

        // Action stuff
        final UIComponent source = event.getComponent();
        final ActionSource actionSource = (ActionSource) source;
        MethodBinding binding;

        binding = actionSource.getAction();
        final String expr = binding.getExpressionString();
        if (!expr.startsWith("#")) {
            super.processAction(event);
            return;
        }

        final int idx = expr.indexOf('.');
        final String target = expr.substring(0, idx).substring(2);
        final String t = expr.substring(idx + 1);
        final String method = t.substring(0, (t.length() - 1));

        final MethodExpression expression = new MethodExpressionMethodBindingAdapter(binding);
        final ELContext elContext = context.getELContext();
        final ExpressionFactory factory = context.getApplication().getExpressionFactory();

        final ValueExpression ve = factory.createValueExpression(elContext, "#{" + target + '}', Object.class);
        final Object result = ve.getValue(elContext);

        // Check if the target method is a secured method
        // and check security accordingly
        final Method[] methods = result.getClass().getMethods();
        for (final Method meth : methods) {
            if (meth.getName().equals(method)) {
                if (meth.isAnnotationPresent(CustomSecurity.class)) {
                    final CustomSecurity securityAnnotation = meth.getAnnotation(CustomSecurity.class);
                    System.out.println("Function to check security on: " + securityAnnotation.value()); // TODO TO LOG
                    SecurityUtil.checkSecurity(securityAnnotation.value());
                } else {
                    super.processAction(event);
                }
                break;
            }
        }
    }

}
 And this in the faces-config.xml: <action-listener> com.nielsr.randompackagebecauseofnda.SecurityActionListener </action-listener> This blog could also be an answer, but I don't know how it will work with my JaaS Tomcat security because the security is in a separate project deployed as a standalone JAR in the tomcat lib folder. But I actually don't know that I have to secure my Beans. Because I have configured all the functions (aka roles see above) that are on 1 page in the Web.xml as security constraints. And I render the components on the page only if you have to rights or "function_role" on that component. So is this secured enough? Or if somebody has a right to a function on a page can he render the components himself and so hack my site? I'm not that familiar to JSF to know this, what is going on in that extra JSF abstraction layer between Controller and View? (I'm more of a Spring MVC developer, but because of requirements I have to use JSF but it's nice to broaden my knowledge.)

@TITLE:jquery setting hidden input value not working as expected in IE7 and IE8
@CONTENT:Continuing adopting my code to work with IE... I have a hidden div containing a form to edit some information. When the user selects the item to edit, this div is shown and the fields are populated with the information for the item. That divs (in simplified terms) looks like this: <div id="editform">
<form action="" method="post" id="qform" name="qform">
    First param: <input name="field1" id="field1"/> <br/>
    Second param: <input name="field2" id="field2"/> <br/>
    ...

    <input type="hidden" name="qid" id="qid" value=""/>

    <img id="submit" src="..." alt="..." title="..." />
</form>
 I use jquery to set the values into the fields. My function for opening up the editing div looks something like this: function edit_item(item_id) {
    item = get_item(item_id);    //this will return a JS object
    $('#field1').val(item.property1);
    $('#field2').val(item.property2);
    ...
    $('#qid').val(item_id);
    $('#submit').click(function() {
        alert($('#qid').val());
        $('#qform').ajaxSubmit();
    });
}
 All of this works fine in FF, Opera, Webkit and IE 9, however in IE7 and IE8, I'm having a strange problem. I can see the item_id being set correctly in the edit_item function, however as soon as that function completes, the hidden input value (qid) gets reset to the empty string. When the form is being ajax-submitted, the alert shows the value to be an empty string despite it being set correctly. Interestingly, all other fields are fine. And it works correctly in IE 9. What am I missing here? Many thanks in advance.

@TITLE:Setting namespaces and prefixes in a Java DOM document
@CONTENT:I'm trying to convert a ResulSet to an XML file. I've first used this example for the serialization. import  org.w3c.dom.bootstrap.DOMImplementationRegistry;
import  org.w3c.dom.Document;
import  org.w3c.dom.ls.DOMImplementationLS;

 After I made this work, I tried to validate my XML file, there were a couple of warnings. One about not having a doctype. So I tried another way to implement this. I came across the Transformer class. This class lets me set the encoding, doctype, etc. The previous implementation supports automatic namespace fix-up. The following does not. private static Document toDocument(ResultSet rs) throws Exception {   
    DocumentBuilderFactory factory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
    factory.setNamespaceAware(true);
    DocumentBuilder builder = factory.newDocumentBuilder();
    Document doc = builder.newDocument();

 While I was testing the previous implementation I got an TransformationException: Namespace for prefix 'xsi' has not been declared. As you can see I've tried to add a namespace with the xsi prefix to the root element of my document. After testing this I still got the Exception. What is the correct way to set namespaces and their prefixes?

 I would like to select the lines in file A, where either column 3 or column 6 have a match in file B. In the above example the output would look like: 1       101427      GENE|ACT-A      1       101589      GENE|ACT-B    0.0357

@TITLE:Symfony2: How to dynamically register a bundle (and clear the cache) from other bundle's controller
@CONTENT:I'm creating some kind of an 'ready to be extended' admin panel. What I'm trying to do is a module for extending some admin panel features by downloading a proper bundle and install it from within admin panel. I have prepared an additional gallery module and I don't wan to enable it with the standard version of admin panel (or even deploy this bundle to the prod server). The extra gallery bundle should only be installed from, let's say an admin panel/modules site. Where user could upload the gallery module(a bundle, downloaded from the server) and let the application handle the rest which would be: extract the bundle to src/proper_path, register it in AppKernel.php and clear the cache(if it's necessary). The final and only question is: is it possible in Symfony2 and how it can be done? Is it possible to dynamically register bundles in Symfony2? says it is, but is it a proper or only way? And what about cache clearing, can I run it form a controller? Does the Composer have anything to do with the whole problem, or can help? Extending features of the site using that method is very pupular in many of public free CMS. Do you have any experience or words of wisdom?

@TITLE:CodeIgniter CAPTCHA validation
@CONTENT:I have created some form for inserting data into database and for checking if the data was sent from human I have used CAPTCHA which is already integrated to CI. This is my controller:     $checkrules = array(
        'img_path' => realpath(APPPATH . '../upload/checking/img') . '/',
        'img_url' => base_url() . 'upload/checking/img/',

        'img_width' => 150,
        'img_height' => 30,
        'expiration' => 7200
    );

    $check = create_captcha($checkrules);
    $data['checkimg'] = $check['image'];

    $this->form_validation->set_rules('name', 'Name', 'required|max_length[40]|xss_clean');
    $this->form_validation->set_rules('email', 'E-mail', 'required|valid_email|xss_clean');
    $this->form_validation->set_rules('website', 'Website', 'max_length[80]|prep_url|xss_clean');
    $this->form_validation->set_rules('comment', 'Comment', 'required|xss_clean');

    }
    else
    {
        echo "success";
        $this->load->view('cms/theme', $data);
    }
 My question now is what's the best way to validate CAPTCHA? 1.) Creating callback, which I have already done, but there was problem because when I send form is error with new CAPTCHA code. 2.) Inserting CAPTCHA's code into database and check from it. Problem is because there will be a lot of loading database and it will be very busy. And second question. Is this CAPTCHA saving only .jpg pictures in folder or it can be any other format there? (I'm asking this because I want to delete this captcha's after they are used.)

@TITLE:GMaps JS Geocode: Using/Passing Variables With Asynchronous Geocode Function?
@CONTENT:I have an array list of location objects, and I am using some of them to build a full address, and then geocode that. Once I receive the OK status I am then placing a marker on the map. This all works fine. However, now I would also like to place an info window on each marker with another property from my array list, LocationName. Code is here: function placeMarkers(myObjList){
var geocoder = new google.maps.Geocoder();
for(var i=0; i<myObjList.length; i++){
    var fullAddress = myObjList[i].Address + ", " + myObjList[i].City + ", " + myObjList[i].State + ", " + myObjList[i].Zip;
    /* The variable I would like to have access to in the geocode call */
    var locationName = myObjList[i].LocationName;

    geocoder.geocode( { 'address': fullAddress}, function(results, status) {
        if (status == google.maps.GeocoderStatus.OK) {
            alert(locationName);
            var marker = new google.maps.Marker({
                map: map,
                position: results[0].geometry.location,
                clickable: true
            });
            markers.push(marker);
        } else {
            alert("Geocode was not successful for the following reason: " + status);
        }
    });
}
}
 The alert is to just see what locationName is when I get that status OK. But in testing it is just always the same value. Once I can tailor this to reflect the right value each time, then I have code lined up to place the info windows on the marker. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
@CODE:function placeMarkers(myObjList){
var geocoder = new google.maps.Geocoder();
for(var i=0; i<myObjList.length; i++){

    var locationName = myObjList[i].LocationName;

@TITLE:Fast integer to decimal conversion
@CONTENT:Given an (unsigned) integer, what is the generally fastest way to convert it into a string that contains its decimal representation? The na?ve way of doing that is repeatedly dividing by 10, until you reach zero. I dislike this approach, because it uses integer division, which is both slow and not available on some integrated platforms requires the programmer to flip the string afterwards. This doubles the number of memory operations needed. I thought of the following method to convert integers to decimal base. Is this a good idea? How is this done in common implementations of functions like printf ? #include <stdint.h>

@TITLE:how to update the database upon successful downloading?
@CONTENT:I have written the a download script which will download a file from a directory. Upon successful download I need to update the database so I write the following code. $path = $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']."/upload/"; // change the path to fit your websites document structure

$fullPath = $path.$_GET['download_file'];

if ($fd = fopen ($fullPath, "r")) {
    $fsize = filesize($fullPath);
    $path_parts = pathinfo($fullPath);
    $ext = strtolower($path_parts["extension"]);
    switch ($ext) {
        case "pdf":
        header("Content-type: application/pdf"); // add here more headers for diff. extensions
        header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"".$path_parts["basename"]."\""); // use 'attachment' to force a download
        break;
        default;
        header("Content-type: application/octet-stream");
        header("Content-Disposition: filename=\"".$path_parts["basename"]."\"");

    }
}
fclose ($fd);
$update = mysql_query("Update query");
if($update) {
echo "updated";
}
else {
echo 'error'.mysql_error();
}
exit;
 But when I click on the download link and a browser popup appears the in the popup when I click on the cancel button, it should not execute the update query as the file is not downloaded but when in using the above code even if I click on the cancel button the update query executed. So what is the mistake in my code?

@CONTENT:We have an iPad app running in a kiosk mode deployed across multiple physical locations. We'd like to have a solution where any updates to the app are pushed automatically to the device so that the client does not have to touch each iPad they have. Our client has an existing MDM software that notifies the user if there's an update, but since it's intended to be a kiosk we don't want the general public to actually do the update by themselves. Does anyone know if this is possible at all? Thanks, Teja.

@TITLE:Consuming C# WCF service from Delphi 2010 client: Databinding and Entity Framework
@CONTENT:I am migrating a win32 Delphi VCL application written in Delphi 2010 to a multi-tiered architecture. The application makes extensive use of ExpressGrids (TcxGrid) by devexpress for databinding. I have designed the data tier based on Entity framework, using dbContext and Data transfer objects. I have expose the CRUD operations via WCF using T4 templates based on the entity data model. That's all working fine, Delphi client successfully communicates with the WCF service, to exchange data transfer objects. The problem is, how do I maintain the Databinding functionality? I am leaning toward writing a service method that returns a generic data table, or a dataset. Can I convert linq statement results to Datasets, tables or views? I am not sure I can bind Expressgrids to arrays of objects (WCF returns entity collections, but Delphi sees arrays). Has any one had experience with this type of interoperability? EDIT I have the data service returning DataSets, but guess what? The xml dataset from .net is not compatible with Delphi (2010 at least). I have managed to get that to work using the Gekko example (modified) , but it's not going to be practical due to the complexity of the queries we'd need to run from the client. Our options now, are to leave the Grids as they are until the BLL is complete and start a new project to re-write the client in C# (as a web or windows application) or, write a generic Grid plugin using RemObjects Hydra, to embed in forms with grids- trying to figure that out now. Update I have dropped the Gekko DataSet implementation in favour of writing my own by studying the xml format required by TClientDataSet in Delphi. On the server side, I've implemented a service that returns TClientDataSet compliant xml in the form of a byte array. On the client I Load this into a TStringStream and then load the stream into the TclientDataSet component. I use this for small collections to provide lookups and data binding while we roll out the Hydra solution. The xml roughly follows this format: "2.0">

@TITLE:Can I replace a call to open_memstream with a malloc and an implicit cast?
@CONTENT:All, I have a program that prints to a stream. I need to buffer this stream in memory, and then print each line as necessary to an actual file later. Since the fprintf() function calls must have a FILE * pointer, I need to have said pointer addressing space in memory. I had used the open_memstream() function, but this is not supported on windows. Since malloc() returns a void * pointer that magically casts to the necessary pointer as needed, could I use that as my FILE * pointer? If so, what caveats are there? Do I need to watch out for running out of space? Update: After finding the source for open_memstream(), which was harder than it should have been, it looks like they are doing a file stream to malloc'd space. Since that is the case, and I've got their source, I'm going to se if I can't get a working version to cross compile for windows with mingw.

@LINK:/questions/10287650/send-a-backgroundworker-to-sleep-while-checking-for-cancellation
@TITLE:Send a backgroundworker to sleep while checking for cancellation
@CONTENT:I have a background worker which updates the GUI on a regular basis via ReportProgress. The update occurs at regular intervals, every 5 seconds for example, or it could be 20 seconds. In order to perform the update at set times I send the worker process to sleep for the duration and when it wakes it updates the GUI with new information. The worker supports cancellation, and outside of sleeping it cancels correctly. I want to be able to invoke the cancellation during the wait period, however sending the thread to sleep makes this impossible. I assume I'll have to invoke a loop and check for the cancellation as part of the loop to simulate the thread sleep. What is the best method for achieving this, my timing is completely off with my attempt.             long counter = 0;
            long sleepfor = timelinespeed*1000;
            int timelinespeed = 10;

                while (counter != sleepfor)
                {

                    Thread.Sleep(1);

I have found many tutorials like this: http://blog.doityourselfandroid.com/2011/02/13/guide-to-integrating-twitter-android-application/ ,which show how to post to twitter from apps but in all of these solutions the user needs to login with his/her own account.

@TITLE:Can variadic expansions be used as a chain of comma-operator calls?
@CONTENT:I was looking at "How to properly use references with variadic templates," and wondered how far comma expansion can go. Here's a variant of the answer: inline void inc() { }

template<typename T,typename ...Args>
inline void inc(T& t, Args& ...args) { ++t; inc(args...); }
 Since variadic arguments are expanded to a comma-separated list of their elements, are those commas semantically equivalent to template/function-argument separators, or are they inserted lexically, making them suitable for any (post-preprocessor) use, including the comma operator? This works on my GCC-4.6: // Use the same zero-argument "inc"

template<typename T,typename ...Args>
inline void inc(T& t, Args& ...args) { ++t, inc(args...); }
 But when I tried: // Use the same zero-argument "inc"

template<typename T,typename ...Args>
inline void inc(T& t, Args& ...args) { ++t, ++args...; }
 I kept getting parsing errors, expecting the ";" before the "...", and that "args" won't get its pack expanded. Why doesn't it work? Is it because if "args" is empty, we get an invalid blob of punctuation? Is it legal, and my compiler isn't good enough? (I've tried surrounding "args" in parentheses, and/or use post-increment; neither worked.)
@CODE:inline void inc() { }

template<typename T,typename ...Args>
inline void inc(T& t, Args& ...args) { ++t; inc(args...); } // Use the same zero-argument "inc"

template<typename T,typename ...Args>
inline void inc(T& t, Args& ...args) { ++t, inc(args...); } // Use the same zero-argument "inc"

 I need something like that : ======================UPDATE========================= I have add the click event as a result of domi27 recomendation. Kindly review the freemarker updates. I have added a java script method that uses :http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/docs/event_data/removeEvents/ The new JS method :    $('#calendar').fullCalendar('removeEvents', 1);
 This method works perfectly with the events that was initially loaded from the controller. However,whenever I try to use the same method to remove the new events I have just added,Nothing happens. When I fire the "select event" for the new event I created ,I get for its id"undefined". As I've mentiond on my freemarker,that are the lines I use to build the new event object that I aappend to the list. var newVacation = {id:'133',title:'title',start:start,url: 'title'};
                                    resourceVacation.push(newVacation);
 When I debug my script,I observe a difference among the objects loaded from the controller and the new object I created when the user adds a new event. Here is the old object I got from the controller when I initiated the calendar: Here is the new Object I got after I insert the new event:
@CODE:<script type="text/javascript">

    function censor(censor) {
        return (function() {
            var i = 0;
            return function(key, value) {
                if (i !== 0 && typeof(censor) === 'object' && typeof(value) == 'object' && censor == value)
                    return '[Circular]';                   

                ++i; // so we know we aren't using the original object anymore

 Is there a better way so that when I have 100 variables, I don't have to type all 100 names? thanks in advance!

@TITLE:How do I display a website with html-forms locally using python and collect the user input?
@CONTENT:I am a behavorial scientist and usually collect data by letting participants do some tasks on a computer and record their responses (I write the programs using the pyglet wrapper PsychoPy). That is, the program runs locally and the data is stored locally. Now I would like to know if there is a way to use Python to display a (local) website with html-forms to the user and collect the input (locally). The reason for this idea is that currently whenever I want to display checkboxes, radiobuttons, or input fields I use wxPython. This works quite well, but programming and layouting in wxPython is kind of cumbersome and I would prefer html with forms. A requirement would be that it would need to rum without any borders, adress field, menu bar, ... The reason is that I need it in kind of fullscreen mode (I currently open a non-fullscreen pygflet window in the size of the screen to hide the desktop) so that participants can do nothing but work on the forms. So I am looking for a way to (a) display html websites including html form above a pyglet window with no menu bar or whatsoever, (b) collect the input when clicking on the Ok button (i.e., the form is send), (c) control what is presented prior and after viewing this website, and (d) everything of this should happen locally! My idea would be that the data is collected when participants hit the "Send away" button in the following example pic and the next page is displayed. Update: I use windows (XP or 7).

@CONTENT:I have two Redis instances (or two respective dump.rdb files) and I would like to combine them into a single instance with two dbs, one for each respective initial instance. I could do this using MIGRATE, but it is only available in Redis 2.6.0, which is not supported by my current Redis server.

@TITLE:Java Tree parser output for ANTLR
@CONTENT:I've found a sample template in the ANTLR website, its the Javatreeparser.g, which the site says could produce the AST that I need, but since I'm new to ANTLR, how do I make it show? What I've done so far is placing the grammar file together with my existing java grammar. But I have no idea on how to use and output the AST that I need from the file. How do I do it?

@TITLE:Android: Alarm to be play every 30 minutes and it start from 12:30
@CONTENT:Here i am going to use the alarm service to play the alarm at every 30 minutes. Right now i have set it to play it at every 10 second from the Every start. Here is the Code: @Override
public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState){
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.settings_layout);


    Intent myIntent = new Intent(SettingsActivity.this, MyAlarmService.class);
    pendingIntent = PendingIntent.getService(SettingsActivity.this, 0, myIntent, 0);

    AlarmManager alarmManager = (AlarmManager)getSystemService(ALARM_SERVICE);

    Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();
    calendar.setTimeInMillis(System.currentTimeMillis());

    alarmManager.setRepeating(AlarmManager.RTC_WAKEUP, calendar.getTimeInMillis(), 10*1000, pendingIntent);

}
 Now the Problem is, I want to start the alarm from the 12:30 not from the time application start and it should repeatedly play at evert 30 minutes. like 1:00, 1:30, 2:00 . . . etc So what changes i have to do in my code ?
@CODE:@Override
public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState){
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.settings_layout);


    Intent myIntent = new Intent(SettingsActivity.this, MyAlarmService.class);
    pendingIntent = PendingIntent.getService(SettingsActivity.this, 0, myIntent, 0);

    AlarmManager alarmManager = (AlarmManager)getSystemService(ALARM_SERVICE);

    Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();
    calendar.setTimeInMillis(System.currentTimeMillis());

    alarmManager.setRepeating(AlarmManager.RTC_WAKEUP, calendar.getTimeInMillis(), 10*1000, pendingIntent);

@TITLE:jQuery.draggable() - Revert on button click
@CONTENT:I have several draggable & droppable elements on my page, which have accept properties. Currently my code is set up like: $(".answer." + answer).draggable({

});
$(".graph." + graph).droppable({
    accept: ".answer." + answer
});
 Therefore if the answer isn't correct, its reverted to its original position. The user also needs the ability to reset all on the page. I've tried the following, but it doesn't work: $("btnReset").click(function(){
   $(".graph.A").draggable({revert:true});
});

@TITLE:Javascript object creation using literals vs custom constructor functions
@CONTENT:I understand that there are multiple ways to create an object in javascript and I have been reading that object literal syntax is generally preferred. (Correct?) What I haven't been able to figure out is if there is ever a reason to use any of the other ways to create objects, such as a custom constructor function (var p = new Person("Adam"))? Is it true to use a custom constructor function only if I want private variables or to add methods or properties to its prototype? Is there no way to do these in a literal?

@TITLE:How to optimize this complicated EAV MYSQL query?
@CONTENT:Is it possible to optimize this query I have written I've created a sort of dynamic virtual database to give my users the ability to add custom fields without affecting the database structure. Here is a very simplified view of the stucture so far. tables         | columns
 db_cases       | caseid
db_structure   | fieldname
db_data        | fieldname, data, caseid
db_names       | nameid
 We can create a new field by adding a row to db_structure Any data we wish to record is recorded to db_data. Names are stored in db_names and the name_id is stored in db_data I am trying to output the cases to a html table Hopefully the rest is self explanatory, you can see how unefficient it is. Can I do the same thing via joins? SELECT 
case_id,
(SELECT data_field_value 
 FROM db_data 
 WHERE data_case_id = case_id AND data_field_name = 'casestatus'
) AS casestatus,
(SELECT forename_company 
 FROM db_names 
 WHERE name_id = (SELECT data_field_value 
                  FROM db_data 
                  WHERE data_case_id = case_id AND data_field_name = 'client1'

@TITLE:Load adsense ads through page transition with jQuery mobile
@CONTENT:I have been reading the web and trying out things for days looking for a way to show the Google Adsense ads through jQuery mobile transitions without breaking the ToS. I am a bit stuck so I turn to the wisest community. The Adsense tag is made of three scripts (i) a general one, (ii) a list of slots and (iii) the display itself. The first two go in the <head>, the latter in the <body>. I can display the ads on my first page just fine. The problem comes with page transition. Since jQuery Mobile does not reload the <head>, an option is to prepare the googletag while loading the <head> the first time. This sets the limit to a maximum of three ads per page, which, across a whole site is not a lot. Plus it means that you will have to move ad <div> around, which is not so great either. Finally, it means that you may load ads and not display them until the user goes to the page where it belongs, if ever. Which is not so ToS compatible either. Is there a way to load a fresh new ad on each transition? If yes, where do I put the Google scripts to make sure they load properly?

@TITLE:.htaccess Remove URL Extension, Add Trailing Slash
@CONTENT:I have been trying to get this to work on my client's server for a website I am developing, but I simply cannot get it to work. Basically I am trying to remove the .html extensions, and add a trailing slash (in the URL bar). So if someone enters: -example.com/home/ ----------- goes to ----- example.com/home/ -example.com/home ------------ goes to ----- example.com/home/ -example.com/home.html ------ goes to ----- example.com/home/ -example.com/home.html/ ----- goes to ----- example.com/home/ -example.com/home/.html ----- goes to ----- example.com/home/ -example.com/home/.html/ ---- goes to ----- example.com/home/ Here is my .htaccess so far, which works PERFECTLY, and does everything I want it do, except add the trailing slash at the end. Here is that code: #force www
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^www\.
RewriteRule ^(.*) http://www.%{HTTP_HOST}/1 [R=301,L]

# remove .html ONLY if requested directly
RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} (\.html\sHTTP/1)
RewriteRule ^(.+)\.html /1 [R=301,L,QSA]

# remove trailing slash ONLY if it is not an existing folder
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*)/ /1 [L,R=301]

# rewrite to FILENAME.html if such file does exist and is not a folder
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME}\.html -f
RewriteRule ^(.*) /1.html [L,QSA]
 All of my files hosted on the server are in the form of FILENAME.html, and are located in the root directory. So, if any one could please help me out, I would really appreciate it.

@TITLE:Has and Belongs to Many error - *_development.hunts_tasks' doesn't exist:
@CONTENT:So I'm working on a project where there are tasks that make up a scavenger hunt. So when a user clicks on a particular hunt, I'd like the show.html.erb file to show the hunt as well as the tasks associated with that hunt. Both models (Hunt.rb and Task.rb) have "has_and_belongs_to_many" relationships with one another. My controller originally had this code, but it showed every task in the database, instead of just the tasks associated with a particular hunt.   def show
    @hunt = Hunt.find(params[:id])
    @title = @hunt.name  
    @tasks = Task.paginate(:page => params[:page])
  end
 So I tried this.   def show
    @hunt = Hunt.find(params[:id])
    @title = @hunt.name    
    @tasks = @hunt.tasks.paginate(:page => params[:page]) 
  end
 But then it throws up this error:     ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid in Hunts#show

@CONTENT:Is it possible to automate the exportation of a single db using phpMyAdmin? When I try creating the .sql file from an external script, like php, the resulting .sql file looks clean, but when imported causes problems in the application. When I use phpMyAdmin to create a similar .sql file by using Export, the resulting .sql file Imports without causing any issues to my application. The application is moodle 2.2, the MySQL version is 5.5, the phpMyAdmin version is 3.4.10.

@TITLE:Accessing programmatically created calendar on iOS device
@CONTENT:I have figured out how to add a custom calendar within my iPhone app, but I can't figure out how to add that calendar to the device's Calendar. The event shows the correct calendar when viewed from within the app, but even when I tap on the calendar row for an event, my calendar is not in the list, and I have to cancel if I want to keep the calendar name correct. Is there a way to 'subscribe' to my locally created calendar so that I can see it from within the Calendar app on the device (obviously, I would also want it to sync with the user's computer, etc).

@TITLE:CodeIgniter: Passing fields to user_profiles database with Tank_auth
@CONTENT:I'm wracking my brain on what is probably a simple issue. Relatively new to MVC and codeigniter. I'm using tank_auth for user registration, and it comes with a db table user_profiles which I've altered slightly to add things like 'firstname', 'lastname', 'homephone', etc. I've added the appropriate fields to my register_form.php view and following advice from this question: Tank Auth Adding Fields and others, tried to update all necessary stuff. Unfortunately, while the users table gets populated properly, the user_profiles table does not. I've double checked with firebug that the view is posting properly, but the model is not picking up the data, and I keep getting the error: A PHP Error was encountered

Severity: Notice

Message: Undefined variable: firstname

Filename: tank_auth/users.php

Line Number: 382
 Using var_dump, I can see that the controller function is not receiving 'firstname' or anything else and they are NULL, but the data going into users is being sent properly. Here's the relevant code: Model: private function create_profile($user_id)

@CONTENT:I'm working to develop an application that has to query at some time, a database with over 4k rows, and each row has 90 fields (Strings). The problem is that if I select * from database, my cursor gets really big (over 4MB). And the cursor in android is limited to 1MB. How can I solve this, or what's the most elegant method to workaround this? It is possible to split database in smaller chunks and query them out? Thanks, Arkde

@TITLE:Convert from Base64 String to PNG File
@CONTENT:I am trying to convert a base64 encoded string to an image object using the method below. function gotFileWriter(writer) {
    console.log('Starting gotFileWriter');
    writer.onwrite = function (evt) {
        console.log("write success");
    };

    $.mobile.showPageLoadingMsg();
    //        console.log('height: ' + cb_canvas.height);
    //        console.log('width: ' + cb_canvas.width);
    Signaturebase64 = cb_canvas.toDataURL();

    //I need to save the base64 string to a PNG image on the Phone here.  
    writer.write(Signaturebase64 );

    $.mobile.hidePageLoadingMsg();
    $.mobile.changePage("#MyJob");
    console.log('Finished gotFileWriter');
}
 The line: Signaturebase64 = cb_canvas.toDataURL();
 Works as expected and gives me back my base64 string. What I would like to do now is to convert it to an image file on the phone's persistent storage. The following line is writing the base64 string to the storage but what I want it to do is save it as a PNG file instead: writer.write(filedata);
@CODE:function gotFileWriter(writer) {
    console.log('Starting gotFileWriter');
    writer.onwrite = function (evt) {
        console.log("write success");
    };

    $.mobile.showPageLoadingMsg();
    //        console.log('height: ' + cb_canvas.height);
    //        console.log('width: ' + cb_canvas.width);
    Signaturebase64 = cb_canvas.toDataURL();

    //I need to save the base64 string to a PNG image on the Phone here.  
    writer.write(Signaturebase64 );

    $.mobile.hidePageLoadingMsg();
    $.mobile.changePage("#MyJob");

@CONTENT:I was trying out the sparse representation of the arff file as shown here. In my program I am able to print the the class label "B" but for some reason it is not printing "A".     attVals = new FastVector();
    attVals.addElement("A");
    attVals.addElement("B");
    atts.addElement(new Attribute("class", attVals));

    vals[index] = attVals.indexOf("A");
 The output for the program is like -  {0 6,2 8}      ---  I should get {0 6,2 8,3 A}
 But when I do vals[index] = attVals.indexOf("B");
 I get proper output -  {0 6,2 8,3 B}
 For some reason it is not taking the index 0. Can someone tell me why this is happening?

@TITLE:How to integrate photoswipe inside jquerymobile pages?
@CONTENT:I am trying to implement photoswipe inside my jquerymobile application. I am using jquerymobile & Django to develop my application and now I want to setup a gallery on one my pages. Basically I have 3 pages, page 1 is the the category index, then I got a subcategory index for each category and finally I goto a detail item page. On the itemPage I put the code to handle the photoswipe library however it doesn't work as I expected because the content of the page is loaded via ajax ( I have to do a full refresh in order to load the photoswipe scripts) I know I can solve the issue, calling the subctageory level links with rel="external", but this cause a total refresh on Itempage and I want to keep the smooth transitions between pages. So I need to know how to setup the code for photoswipe before page load. The code below is from the itemPage level( I put the code from the photoswipe demo inside) <!DOCTYPE html>

 I put the script to handle the gallery inside <div data-role="page" id="Home"> since If I put the code in the head is never executed for the ajax call. However when I executed the code above, the page doesn't show the last level(itempage never appears) I guess the problem can be fixed changing ther way the page is loaded with some code like below inside <div data-role="page" id="Home"> $( document ).delegate("#Home", "pagebeforecreate", function() {
             alert('A page with an ID of "aboutPage" is about to be created by jQuery Mobile!');
          });
 but how I can call the photoswipe script, If I replaced the code from alert function with (function(window, PhotoSwipe){

            document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function(){

                var
                    options = {},
                    instance = PhotoSwipe.attach( window.document.querySelectorAll('#Gallery a'), options );

            }, false);


        }(window, window.Code.PhotoSwipe));
 it doesn't work? the page doesn't load Hope you can help me! Thanks

@TITLE:CakePHP Subdomain Routing & Misc
@CONTENT:Background: Building a web app (as an introduction to CakePHP) which allows users to manage a lounge. A lounge is composed of a blog, contacts, calendar, etc. Each lounge is associated with a subdomain (so jcotton.lounger.local would take you to my lounge). The root of the site, used for creating new lounges, registering users, etc is hosted on lounger.local. I am using Cake 2.0. Questions: I wanted to be able to separate actions and views associated with the root site (lounger.local) from individual lounges (subdomains of lounger.local). After a good deal of research I settled on the following soln. I setup a prefix route "lounge" and added the the following code in routes.php. Actions (and views) associated with a lounge all contain the prefix lounge (ex: lounge_index()). How would you handle this?      if(preg_match('/^([^.]+)\.lounger\.local$/',env("HTTP_HOST"),$matches)){
           $prefix = "lounge";
           Router::connect('/', array('controller' => 'loungememberships','action' => 'index', 'prefix' => $prefix, $prefix => true));
           /* Not currently using plugins
           Router::connect("/:plugin/:controller", array('action' => 'index', 'prefix' => $prefix, $prefix => true));
           Router::connect("/:plugin/:controller/:action/*", array('prefix' => $prefix, $prefix => true));
           */
           Router::connect("/:controller", array('action' => 'index', 'prefix' => $prefix, $prefix => true));
           Router::connect("/:controller/:action/*", array('prefix' => $prefix, $prefix => true));
           unset($prefix);
      }
 Each time a user performs an action within a lounge such as posting a comment within the blog, adding a contact, etc, it is necessary to lookup the lounge_id (based on the subdomain); this is necessary to verify the user is authorized to perform that action and to associate the corresponding data with the correct lounge. I have implemented this via the beforeFilter function in AppController. Each time a request is received with a subdomain a search is performed and the lounge_id is written to a session variable. Each controller then loads CakeSession and reads the corresponding lounge_id. Is this better than calling ClassRegistry::Init('Lounge') and doing the lookup in each controller? Is there a better soln? Thanks in advance for the help
@CODE:if(preg_match('/^([^.]+)\.lounger\.local$/',env("HTTP_HOST"),$matches)){
           $prefix = "lounge";
           Router::connect('/', array('controller' => 'loungememberships','action' => 'index', 'prefix' => $prefix, $prefix => true));
           /* Not currently using plugins
           Router::connect("/:plugin/:controller", array('action' => 'index', 'prefix' => $prefix, $prefix => true));
           Router::connect("/:plugin/:controller/:action/*", array('prefix' => $prefix, $prefix => true));
           */
           Router::connect("/:controller", array('action' => 'index', 'prefix' => $prefix, $prefix => true));
           Router::connect("/:controller/:action/*", array('prefix' => $prefix, $prefix => true));

@TITLE:Can't provoke Priority Inversion in C++
@CONTENT:I'm trying to provoke Priority Inversion on a small C++ program for demonstration purposes but I can't: The low priority thread that holds the mutex is not preempted and keeps running on the critical section. This is what I'm doing: // let's declare a global mutex
pthread_mutex_t my_mutex;
  ...

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  ...
  pthread_t normal_thread;
  pthread_t prio_thread;

  pthread_mutexattr_t attr;
  pthread_mutexattr_init (&attr);
  pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol (&attr, PTHREAD_PRIO_NONE);  // ! None !
  pthread_mutex_init(&my_mutex, &attr);

  // create first normal thread (L):
  pthread_create(&normal_thread, NULL, the_locking_start_routine, NULL);

  // just to help the normal thread enter in the critical section
  sleep(2);

  // now will launch:
  // * (M) several CPU intensive SCHED_FIFO threads with priority < 99
  // * (H) one SCHED_FIFO thread that will try to lock the mutex, with priority < 99

  // build Real Time attributes for the Real Time threads:
  pthread_attr_t my_rt_att;
  pthread_attr_init(&my_rt_att);

  // it was missing in the original post and it was also wrong:
  // even setting the SchedPolicy you have to set "InheritSched"
  pthread_attr_setinheritsched(&my_rt_att, PTHREAD_EXPLICIT_SCHED)

  pthread_attr_setschedpolicy(&my_rt_att, SCHED_FIFO);
  struct sched_param params;

  params.sched_priority = 1;
  pthread_attr_setschedparam(&my_rt_att, &params);

  pthread_create(&prio_thread, &my_rt_att, the_CPU_intensive_start_routine, NULL) 

  params.sched_priority = 99;
  pthread_attr_setschedparam(&my_rt_att, &params);

  // create one RealTime thread like this:
  pthread_create(&prio_thread, &my_rt_att, the_locking_start_routine, NULL)  //coma was missing

  ...
}

void *the_locking_start_routine(void *arg) {
  ...
  pthread_mutex_lock(&my_mutex);
  // This thread is on the critical section
  // ... (skipped)
  pthread_mutex_unlock(&my_mutex);
  ...
}
 ... But it doesn't work, I can't have my desired Priority Inversion. This is what happens: As I understand, with a scheduller like Linux's CFS, a non-real time thread (SCHED_OTHER) will not run until there isn't any Real Time thread (SCHED_FIFO or SCHED_RR) in runnning state. But I have achieved this threads running simultaneously: (L) One non-real time (SCHED_OTHER) thread locking the mutex and consuming CPU (M) several Real Time threads (SCHED_FIFO , & priority > 0) CPU intensive and non-waiting to lock the mutex (H) One Real Time thread (SCHED_FIFO , & highest priority ) waiting for the lock There are more Real Time CPU intensive threads (M) running than the amount of CPUs of my system ... but the non-real time thread holding (L) the lock is still consuming CPU and finishes it's work and releases the mutex before the "M" threads finish consuming CPU. Why isn't the low priority thread preempted, the application dead-locked and I can't get priority inversion? I'm using g++ 4.5.2 on a Ubuntu Desktop 11.04 with kernel 2.6.38-13.

This is a UK application only, and part of the system requires a full, or near full, postcode to process correctly. However the reverse geocoder regularly returns just the part of the postcode - for example "GU3", even when the actual address returned appears to be complete - for example including street and house number. Is there anyway, preferably google but otherwise if not, of 'snapping' the address to the nearest full postcode?

So when I click submit, <p:message> show up on component that have require=true, but the user did not type/select I want the red box Required also appear next to the upload component. Here is what I have tried. 1 . when I set required="true" in p:fileUpload, nothing really happen (not sure if this is a bug). 2 . I put validator in p:fileUpload, below is my validator sources public void validateFileUpload(FacesContext context, UIComponent component,

     message.setDetail("Required");
     throw new ValidatorException(message);      
   }
}
 nothing really happen when I click submit, not even when I go through the upload, validateFileUpload did not get called at all (not sure if this is a bug) 3 . When I click submit, if everything else pass, and I get into my action method, I am able to check if the file is null or not, then return a FacesMessage and let p:growl pick it up. However, I dont like it that way since it give the user a feeling of multiple layer of validation. Is there a way to do better validation on p:fileUpload?

@TITLE:Role of files .keystore and CAKey.pem in SSL?
@CONTENT:i was successfully to take my webapplication on https from http. Actually i have doubts about the roles of two files that came across during this transition phase. I can see two key files one is .keystore and another is CAKey.pem. I specifically want to know the at what point of time they come in to picture. In server.xml i find a entry of atrributes keystoreFile(for which value is location of keystore) and keystorePass(value for which is password i had given during generation of .keystore file) while in ApplicationConfig.xml i find a two attributes i.e openSSLLocation(against which i can see the value of openssl directory) and second attribute is password (against which value is what i had given the value of password during generation of CAKey.pem file). Want to know specifically what these file contain and play role in SSL? Edit i went thru the link which bruno pinted out. I also went thru another informative link link i.e http://www.verisign.com/ssl/ssl-information-center/how-ssl-security-works/. Now my understanding after going thru thhese two links is kestore file contains the details of SSL certificate (if we use authorized CA like verisign they provide 128 bit encryption which probably default key store brovided by java keytool command certificates does not). On the basis of this certificate containing private key, encryption happens. Right? As pointed in versign link , at last digital signature is also issued as acknowledgement. Not sure Does this certificate has any purpose or just acknowledgement as pointed in link? Files like CACert.pem, CAKey.pem are related to digital certificates? Edit 2 here are the steps I followed for SSL 1) Download Win32OpenSSL_Light-0_9_8t from http://www.slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html and install 2) In the OpenSSL installation directory, create subdirectory private. The Certificate Authority's private key will be stored here. In the OpenSSL installation directory, create subdirectory newcerts. New certificates signed by the CA will be stored here. In the OpenSSL installation directory, create an empty file named index.txt. OpenSSL keeps its signed certificates database in that file. From the subdirectory bin/PEM/demoCA of the OpenSSL installation directory, copy the file serial to the OpenSSL installation directory. Open the copied serial file and edit it to read 00 and save. Each new CA-signed certificate's serial number is taken from this file's content, which is incremented each time a certificate is signed. 3) In openssl.cfg .Did the following changes dir = c:/openssl <-- This is the OpenSSL installation directory certificate = $dir/private/cacert.pem #crl = $dir/crl.pem 4) Create Self-signed Certificate with command cd /d "%OPENSSL_HOME%" openssl req -new -x509 -days 2000 -keyout private\CAKey.pem -out private\CACert.pem -config bin\openssl.cnf 5)Convert the certificate PEM file to a DER encoded file cd /d "%OPENSSL_HOME%" openssl x509 -in private\CACert.pem -out private\CACert.cer -outform DER This command creates file CACert.cer in the private subdirectory. 6) Modify Java Root Certificates cd %JAVA_HOME% keytool -import -keystore jre\lib\security\cacerts -alias AppOpenSSLCert -file %OPENSSL_HOME%\private\cacert.cer This adds our self-signed CA certificate to Java's trusted CA certificates, which are kept in file jre\lib\security\cacerts in the Java JDK installation directory. Our self-signed CA certificate was stored under the alias AppOpenSSLCert. As per documentation it should have worked(i.e i tried hitting the URL with https) but it did not work . To make it work I had to run one more command i.e 7) C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_23>keytool -genkey -alias tomcat -keyalg RSA which generated .keystore file((which will have SSL certificate which will be send when client makes https request and client matches this certificates in truststore and private key) Finally i made changes in server.xml and it worked keystoreFile="c:/.keystore" keystorePass="changeit" Thats why whole confusion came to my mind. If we are using certificates pointed by .keystore file generated in 7th step,what is the purpose of steps i did from 1 to 6(CAKey.pem and CACert.pem files). Whatever i understood regarding SSL, i think i should not mention .keystore(generated in step 7)in server.xml but some other keystore probably generated somewhere during step 1-6 but not sure what is the file name and where it is generated? Last question in the verisign link. it talks about two certicates i.e SSL certificate and digital certificate. Where SSL certificate and digital certificate fit in above scenario?

@TITLE:Using an animated GIF in a JComboBox
@CONTENT:I'm trying to use animated (GIF) icons in a JComboBox. As the DefaultListCellRenderer is based on JLabel, ImageIcons are directly supported when putting them into the the ComboBoxModel. However this does not work with animated GIFs. In the dropdown they are not show at all unless they are selected (the GIFs do work when used in a regular JLabel though) The code to populate the combobox is straight forward: ImageIcon[] data = new ImageIcon[4];
data[0] = new ImageIcon("icon_one.gif");
data[1] = new ImageIcon("icon_two.gif");
data[2] = new ImageIcon("icon_three.gif");
data[3] = new ImageIcon("icon_four.gif");
ComboBoxModel model = new DefaultComboBoxModel(data);
setModel(model);
 icon_one.gif is the static one and is shown without any problems. The others are animated. (The images are loaded correctly because if I assign any of those icons to a JLabel directly they are displayed just fine) I also tried to use my own ListCellRenderer based on a JPanel (inspired by the answer to this question: Java animated GIF without using a JLabel). That works a bit better but not ideal either. The icons are only shown if I move the mouse over them while the dropdown is shown. So I guess it's a repaiting issue, although I don't know where This is the part from my JPanel that implements the ListCellRenderer interface. public Component getListCellRendererComponent(JList list, Object value, int index, boolean isSelected, boolean cellHasFocus)
{
  this.image = ((ImageIcon)value).getImage();
  if (isSelected)
  {
    setBackground(list.getSelectionBackground());
    setForeground(list.getSelectionForeground());
  }
  else
  {
    setBackground(list.getBackground());
    setForeground(list.getForeground());
  }
  revalidate();
  repaint();

  return this;
}
 The call to revalidate() and repaint() was inspired by looking at the code of JLabel.setIcon() The paint() method is straight forward as well: public void paintComponent(Graphics g)
{
  super.paintComponent(g);
  if (image != null)

setModel(model); public Component getListCellRendererComponent(JList list, Object value, int index, boolean isSelected, boolean cellHasFocus)
{
  this.image = ((ImageIcon)value).getImage();
  if (isSelected)
  {
    setBackground(list.getSelectionBackground());
    setForeground(list.getSelectionForeground());
  }
  else
  {
    setBackground(list.getBackground());
    setForeground(list.getForeground());
  }
  revalidate();
  repaint();

  return this;

@CONTENT:My Question is similar to this one How can I wake an android device up and skip the screenlock I want to display a dialogue box from broadcast receiver, but Android API is not allowing me to do that therefore I am using starting an activity from there and changing the theme of this activity to Theme. Now I want this activity to be displayed even when phone is in locked mode/ sleep mode. Screen I am able to turn on bu using below flags but Key Guard (Non Secured) I have to unlock manually. I am not able to see my window over locked screen. The difference is that I am not using a full screen Activity i.e. android:theme="@android:style/Theme.Dialog
 in my code I am using Window w = getWindow();
w.addFlags(WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON |

@TITLE:Protecting app secret for extendAccessToken usage (Java/Android)
@CONTENT:I'm developing for Android and currently use facebook-android-sdk for authentication. From what I can see there is no use of the app secret in that code which is great. Now that Facebook are going to remove the offline_access permission I need to extend the access token. Unfortunately the sdk's extendAccessToken method isn't stand alone and requires the official Facebook application to be installed which is unacceptable for me. So I decided to implement extendAccessToken directly (similar to the iphone sdk implementation). The problem is the HTTP request for extending an access token requires the client_secret field which means I need to put the app secret in the code itself. This doesn't feel safe at all for an Android/Java application that can be reverse engineered easily. Are there any alternatives?

@TITLE:j_security_check redirect
@CONTENT:I am learning Java servlets on Tomcat environment. I am learning how to use form based login authentication using j_security_check. So, in my servlet, I have a login page that has j_username and j_password. In web.xml file of that servlet, I have the welcome page list indicating my landing page, "landing.html". So, ideally, after successful login, I want the user to get redirected to "landing.html" page. Without the authentication (no form based authentication), My servlet opens up and goes to "landing.html" page as expected ("localhost:8080/MyServlet" - shows the content of the landing.html). However, now, after a successful login with j_security_check, for some reason, I get automatically redirected to the .css file for "landing.html" file. I can't understand why is this happening. Is there a particular way how I can tell the server to just load the "landing.html" page after successful authentication and not forward it to any where else? EDIT *Okay, I solved it. The css file which was loading after successful authentication was listed within the <head></head> tags of the login.html page where the j_username and j_password are. I added that css file to make the login page's design consist with the rest of the website. My guess is that when the server is re-loading the wanted resource, for some reason it was simply re-loading the top css file from the head tag. Really weird. So, is j_security_check is the best way to do any authentication for websites on Tomcat or is there a better and more reliable way?*

 I am SO confused, I am positive that I have MySql 6.4.4 dll's in my Bin directory, also my Web.config makes ZERO references to version 6.3.6 - I've searched my entire project (using global find) for 6.3.6 and even just for MySql to see if I can find ANY random references to this rogue 6.3.6 version but I find nothing! I'm so lost and am getting no where. I would GREATLY appreciate any guidance on this, thanks so much in advance.

@TITLE:Javascript Template Engine Use with jQuery
@CONTENT:All, I'm trying to use the jQuery File Upload Demo: http://blueimp.github.com/jQuery-File-Upload/ My question is that it says in the Documentation that it uses the Javascript Template Engine (https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Template-Engine) However, I'm not familiar with this process. I'm trying to integrate this into my Wordpress blog to allow file uploads this way. Within the index.html it has the following Template defined: <script id="template-upload" type="text/x-tmpl">
{% for (var i=0, file; file=o.files[i]; i++) { %}

        {% if (file.error) { %}
            <td class="error" colspan="2"><span class="label label-important">{%=locale.fileupload.error%}</span> {%=locale.fileupload.errors[file.error] || file.error%}</td>

{% } %}
</script>
 I'm using the jQuery Tmpl code (https://github.com/jquery/jquery-tmpl) and when I try and create this in my Wordpress blog I get some errors in my jquery.fileupload-ui.js file on these lines: _initTemplates: function () {
        var options = this.options;
        options.templateContainer = document.createElement(
            this._files.prop('nodeName')
        );
        options.uploadTemplate = tmpl(options.uploadTemplateId);
        options.downloadTemplate = tmpl(options.downloadTemplateId);
    },
 Earlier in this file this is defined as this: uploadTemplateId: 'template-upload', I'm confused why this wouldn't work or even how to use my own javascript template to do this? When I try and copy these files into my Wordpress blog it always fails and the only thing I don't think I copy is the package.JSON and the .gitignore files in the initial download. What significance do these files play? Just trying to understand what this template is and how to use it? Anything you can point me to in advance is greatly appreciated! Thanks for the help!

@CONTENT:I have created a webView: videoView.delegate = self;
videoView.userInteractionEnabled = true;
[videoView loadRequest:[[NSURLRequest alloc]initWithURL:[[NSURL alloc]   initWithString:@"website"]]];
 I have html/javascript to handle the video's loading as well as the autoplay and next video. This all works, but my problem is that IOS autoloads the quicktime - like player, which is also a good thing, but I do not know how to control that, nor do I know how to get the video to play once that has happened. I would like the button that shows up in the player to autoplay. I would like that to happen anytime a new video is loaded. JS code works like this. I take in a list and that is my playlist. I do not load a playlist from youTube I just make my own list and when end of video is called I load a new video by id. I also autoplay the video which is what gives me the button that IOS supplies anytime a video loads. Also, I am using an iframe to do all of this, with the youTube api's that is how I have control on the js side of things. Question: Is there a way to control the play via code? If so how, also when the player is already loaded and I load another video how can I get that to autoplay as well? I found the answer: If you put webView.mediaPlaybackRequiresUserAction=FALSE; in the webViewDidFinishLoad then it will autoplay and still let you use the other buttons as well. This worked like a charm and suggest using it.
@CODE:videoView.delegate = self;
videoView.userInteractionEnabled = true;

Long story short there are two copies of the application deployed: one server for the 'main' site and one server with an ev certificate running on https for the customer details (including payment; this is a PCI compliance issue). My question is this: When jumping from http://shop.domain -> https://secure.domain (and back, if the user browses back), how can I preserve the session? Its trivial to pass cookies cross domain using JSONP, but I have no idea what to do with them on the remote side to 'reconnect' to the session. I have read various things about rolling your own custom session provider, etc. etc. but I haven't found one that is more than just generic advice; certainly no examples of how this might be used to rejoin a session.

    def all_vehicles #returns an array of all Vehicle objects

 Now to keep @@total_vehicles and @@all_instances up-to-date and correct, I want to make sure that they are correctly decremented and updated, respectively, when one of those objects is garbage collected. But here is what happens: v = Vehicle.new
Vehicle.total_vehicles # => 1
v = nil #no references to Vehicle instance now
ObjectSpace.garbage_collect #instance garbage collected
Vehicle.total_vehicles # => 1    Nope!
 Well I could add a finalizer Proc to each instance of the Vehicle class that, when called upon the object's garbage collection, would be called. But according to the documentation, ObjectSpace.define_finalizer(v,someProc) would call someProc after the Vehicle instance is destroyed - meaning I cannot use self or self.class in there (since there would be no class, as there is no object!) I could have the proc call a public accessor method on the Vehicle class, but that takes away the purpose of class variables being accessible only to the class and its instances -> essentially turning the class variables into gvars. How can I have the equivalent of a destructor method (from C++) that will get a Vehicle instance's affairs in order, as it were, before getting garbage-collected? P.S. ObjectSpace#count_objects is no a viable option, as even the Ruby docs are up front about.

@TITLE:Exec command doesn't work as expected
@CONTENT:I'm trying to launch a CLI command from a PHP script: in particular I wanna use this command convert a.png a.tif to convert an image to tiff. When I launch this command from CLI it works as expected but if I launch from a PHP script with the following code it doesn't create any tiff image in my folder: $exec = "convert a.png a.tif";
exec($exec,$yaks,$err);
echo "<pre>";
print_r($yaks);
echo "$err";
echo "</pre>";
 Moreover $yaks is empty and $err is set to 127. I'm not an expert, why this doesn't work as expected? Best regards UPDATE I used this command instead $exec = "convert 4.png 4.tif 2>&1"; and I got in return [0] => sh: convert: command not found This seems to me strange since I can use it from CLI! FINAL UPDATE Thanks a lot guys! $exec = "/usr/local/bin/convert a.png a.tif";
 This command solved the problem! You're great.
@CODE:convert a.png a.tif $exec = "convert a.png a.tif";

@CONTENT:I have the Dragon Mobile SDK running nicely on Windows Phone 7 and I would like to get the equivalent functionality working for iOS. Since the SDK wraps the microphone, it's not really possible to use the .NET assemblies in my MonoTouch project (even if I did have the source). It appears that the best way to do this is to create a binding library (as Miguel describes here). It sure seems like a lot of work though, and I would love to reuse as opposed to reinventing the wheel if someone's done it already...

@CONTENT:I am working on a homework project for a Networking class where we have to build a simple web based chat server in either C/C++ or Python. I chose Python because I thought it would be an easier language to implement the project in. We can use any material we find on the web, because it most likely won't have all the functionality that the project requires. In fact, the professor actually encouraged us to use material from the web including tutorials. He's not testing us on our ability to code rather our ability to implement networking code, and whether or not we fully understand the processes involved. The project must handle multiple clients, and must be able to support multiple browsers, chrome, firefox, etc. A user needs to be able to type in an IP Address and a Port in the browser to connect. I just can't find any material to work with. I have found a little in C but nothing in Python. Does anyone know of any complete tutorials out there? There are plenty for client/server command-based chats, but no browser based chats.

 While the algorithm is fairly easy to implement, I haven't the slightest idea how to generate the power set of S, and to feed the subsets of the power set into each iteration of the while loop. My current implementation uses a list of pairs to hold an item's weight and profit: list< pair<int, int> > weight_profit_pair;

@CONTENT:I'm making a cross-domain AJAX request using jQuery but my callback function is not firing (see http://jsfiddle.net/zC8z5/). function jsonpCallback(response){

$.ajax({
    url: url,

    },
    jsonp: false,
    jsonpCallback: 'jsonpCallback'
});
 As per the docs: As of jQuery 1.5, setting the jsonp option to false prevents jQuery from adding the "?callback" string to the URL or attempting to use "=?" for transformation. In this case, you should also explicitly set the jsonpCallback setting. For example, { jsonp: false, jsonpCallback: "callbackName" } However, if I don't specify a callback and instead just handle the data in the success event it works (see http://jsfiddle.net/2gBRT/). $.ajax({
    url: url,
    dataType: 'jsonp',
    error: function(xhr, status, error) {
        alert(error);
    },
    success: function(data) {

@TITLE:A Route Assignment Program Algorithm
@CONTENT:What im trying to do, is create a program that will assign a route for a driving test. there will be three diffrent routes, linked together at certain points. Never should there be more than one student at a point of intersection. Best way to solve this is to schedule these interection points by time. This isnt my only problem, i will need routes to be equally distributed to examiners. So route 1 will be given to examiner 1 route 2 - examiner 2 route 3- examiner 3... The Real Baumann suggested this: Calculate collision times from start. Route 1 has 6 points. {A,B,C,D,E,F} Route 2 has 5 points. {A,F,G,H,I} Route 3 has 6 points. {A,H,K,L,M,N} Possible Collisions at: {A,F,H} So you need to calculate the following times: Route 1: A->F, A->A Route 2: A->F, A->H, A->A Route 3: A->H, A->A From here you can calculate time differences that create a collision. If it takes you 20 minutes to go from route 1A to Route 1F and 5 minutes to get from Route 2A to Route 2F, then you know a collision will occur if start an appointment on Route 2 exactly 15 minutes after you began an appointment at Route 1. Then you would have a set of non-working collisions: Route 1 & 2 collide at: 15, 25, 40 Route 1 & 3 collide at: 25, 30 Route 2 & 3 collide at: 30, 40, 45 This i can understand to a point. But in terms of an algorithm i dont know where to start. IF someone could help me with some pseudo code to work off, or something to make it clearer in my own mind. it would help a lot.

@TITLE:# of bits needed to represent a number x
@CONTENT:I am currently trying to write an algorithm that determines how many bits are necessary to represent a number x. My implementation will be in c. There are a few catches though, I am restricted to pretty much just the bitwise operators {~, &, ^, |, +, <<, >>}. Also, I cannot use any type of control flow (if, while, for). My original approach was to examine the number in binary from left to right, and look for where there is an occurrence of the first '1'. I am not sure how to approach this given the restrictions I have. The number I am working with can be considered an unsigned integer. So 00110 would require only 3 bits. I am wondering if there is a much easier/cleaner way to do this and I am missing it? Or if someone can give a few hints? Basically, I was trying to implement this without the while loop:  int result = 0;
  while (x >>= 1) {
    result += 1;
  }
  return result;
@CODE:int result = 0;
  while (x >>= 1) {

@CONTENT:What im trying to do, is create a program that will assign a route for a driving test. there will be three diffrent routes, linked together at certain points. Never should there be more than one student at a point of intersection. Best way to solve this is to schedule these interection points by time. This isnt my only problem, i will need routes to be equally distributed to examiners. So route 1 will be given to examiner 1 route 2 - examiner 2 route 3- examiner 3... The Real Baumann suggested this: Calculate collision times from start. Route 1 has 6 points. {A,B,C,D,E,F} Route 2 has 5 points. {A,F,G,H,I} Route 3 has 6 points. {A,H,K,L,M,N} Possible Collisions at: {A,F,H} So you need to calculate the following times: Route 1: A->F, A->A Route 2: A->F, A->H, A->A Route 3: A->H, A->A From here you can calculate time differences that create a collision. If it takes you 20 minutes to go from route 1A to Route 1F and 5 minutes to get from Route 2A to Route 2F, then you know a collision will occur if start an appointment on Route 2 exactly 15 minutes after you began an appointment at Route 1. Then you would have a set of non-working collisions: Route 1 & 2 collide at: 15, 25, 40 Route 1 & 3 collide at: 25, 30 Route 2 & 3 collide at: 30, 40, 45 This i can understand to a point. But in terms of an algorithm i dont know where to start. IF someone could help me with some pseudo code to work off, or something to make it clearer in my own mind. it would help a lot.

@CONTENT:If I have a mobile web app (website with meta tag name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes") and save it to the homescreen to create the "app"... then open the app and use the four finger swipe to switch applications and switch back to the mobile web app... it will bring me back, but the app is completely locked/frozen/disabled. Is there any way to make it so the app doesn't get locked when swiping away and back to it? If not, I suppose it would be better to restart the app than bring up a frozen screen.. so would that be possible?

@TITLE:# of bits needed to represent a number x
@CONTENT:I am currently trying to write an algorithm that determines how many bits are necessary to represent a number x. My implementation will be in c. There are a few catches though, I am restricted to pretty much just the bitwise operators {~, &, ^, |, +, <<, >>}. Also, I cannot use any type of control flow (if, while, for). My original approach was to examine the number in binary from left to right, and look for where there is an occurrence of the first '1'. I am not sure how to approach this given the restrictions I have. The number I am working with can be considered an unsigned integer. So 00110 would require only 3 bits. I am wondering if there is a much easier/cleaner way to do this and I am missing it? Or if someone can give a few hints? Basically, I was trying to implement this without the while loop:  int result = 0;
  while (x >>= 1) {
    result += 1;
  }
  return result;
@CODE:int result = 0;

@TITLE:GridView column width does not update when changing ItemsSource
@CONTENT:I have a GridView where I'm setting the ItemsSource in code-behind. All columns in the grid are defined in XAML, and all column widths are "Auto". When I initially set ItemsSource of the grid, the column widths are set correctly. Now, depending on the user's actions, the ItemsSource of the grid may be set to a new EntityCollection. What I have noticed is that the column widths remain as they were with the previous ItemsSource. That is, the column widths don't seem to adjust themselves automatically when a new ItemsSource is set for the Grid. Is there any way in code-behind or XAML to force the Grid to use the new ItemsSource when setting the column widths?

@TITLE:Is there any way to remove the small bias along the gravity axis in the accelerometer data
@CONTENT:Similar to this question: CMDeviceMotion userAcceleration drift I'm using CMDeviceMotion.userAcceleration in iOS5 SDK to plot its x, y, z components over time. Like the above post, I see z acceleration component shows always small positive values (0.005 - 0.015) while x and y components are centering along zero (-0.005 - 0.005) when my iPhone 4s is sitting on a flat surface. This small bias keeps adding up to the estimated velocity (which I compute by integrating the acceleration data) even when my phone is not moving a bit. Is there any known way to remove this bias from the accelerometer data? I cannot simply subtract the bias from z component because it seems that the bias spreads over x y and z along the gravity axis if the device is in some arbitrary orientation. I know that the data in CMDeviceMotion.userAcceleration has already factored out the gravity using Gyro data but wonder if there is any effective way to remove this residual bias?

@TITLE:Upload Library or captured images on iOS with Flex Mobile 4.6
@CONTENT:Does anyone have any experience with the Camera APIs in Flex 4.6 with iOS? I'm running into a lot of setup issues and the documentation is lacking. I'm trying to setup an image upload component where a user can either capture a new photo or choose an existing from their library. For capturing, there seems to be a huge hang (like 10 seconds where the app just sits non-responsive) when the image is being saved as a JPEG, and I'm using the Alchemy swc.         private var cam:CameraUI;
        protected function takePhotoHandler(event:MouseEvent):void
        {
            if(CameraUI.isSupported) {

                cam.launch(MediaType.IMAGE);
            }

        {
            cam.removeEventListener(MediaEvent.COMPLETE, mediaEventComplete);
            status.text =   "Media captured..." ;

            var imagePromise:MediaPromise = e.data;
            var loader:Loader = new Loader();
            if(imagePromise.isAsync) {
                status.text =   "Asynchronous media promise." ;
                loader.contentLoaderInfo.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, asyncImageLoadHandler);
                loader.addEventListener(IOErrorEvent.IO_ERROR, asyncImageErrorHandler);

                var baSource: ByteArray = bitmapData.clone().getPixels( new Rectangle( 0, 0, loaderInfo.width, loaderInfo.height) );
                var bytes: ByteArray = as3_jpeg_wrapper.write_jpeg_file(baSource, loaderInfo.width, loaderInfo.height, 3, 2, 80);     
                d_trace("encoding end");
                stream.writeBytes(bytes,0,bytes.bytesAvailable);

                f.addEventListener(Event.OPEN,openUploadHandler);
                f.upload(urlRequest);


            }
        }
 For choosing from the library, I can't get a file reference to actually start the upload. When the select is made, the mediaPromise.file value is null. mediaPromise.isAsync is true and I can attach a loader listener but that only returns the contentLoaderInfo, which has no reference to the actual File or a FileRefernce, so I can't call the upload method without creating a temp image, which seems expensive and crazy. protected function chooseImage(): void {
    if(CameraRoll.supportsBrowseForImage) {
        var roll: CameraRoll = newCameraRoll();
        roll.addEventListener( MediaEvent.SELECT, roll_selectHandler );
        var options:CameraRollBrowseOptions = new CameraRollBrowseOptions();
         roll.browseForImage(options);
 }}
        private function roll_selectHandler( event: MediaEvent ): void
        {

            var imagePromise:MediaPromise = event.data;

            if(imagePromise.isAsync) {
                // Here's where I get. Not sure how to get the reference to the file I just selected.
            }}
 Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!

@TITLE:Unable to send text messages on some Android Phones using SmsManager
@CONTENT:My mobile app occasionally is sending text messages, everything works great on most phones but i am starting to receive emails from some users stating the messages aren't going out. Here is the code i am using: SmsManager sms = SmsManager.getDefault();
sms.sendTextMessage("+12223334444", null, "test sms", null, null);
 I've read somewhere that I should use the PendingIntent, so i tried it as follows: PendingIntent sentPI = PendingIntent.getBroadcast(context, 0, new Intent("SMS_SENT"), 0);
PendingIntent deliveredPI = PendingIntent.getBroadcast(context, 0, new Intent("SMS_DELIVERED"), 0);                     
SmsManager sm = SmsManager.getDefault();
sm.sendTextMessage(number, null, message, sentPI, deliveredPI);   
 So far I have gotten emails from users of Samsung Galaxy S II, Sprint Evo Shift, Samsung Sidekick phones. Please keep in mind it's not phone specific, i have tested the app on two of these phones (my friends) and the text message was sent normally
@CODE:SmsManager sms = SmsManager.getDefault();
sms.sendTextMessage("+12223334444", null, "test sms", null, null); PendingIntent sentPI = PendingIntent.getBroadcast(context, 0, new Intent("SMS_SENT"), 0);
PendingIntent deliveredPI = PendingIntent.getBroadcast(context, 0, new Intent("SMS_DELIVERED"), 0);

}
 } I'm using a generic bean (NavNode) to help me determine when I have a leaf and when I have an option (NavOption) or options that contain a target used for Hyperlink construction. I want, when I click on a node (TreeNode) in the CellTree, that a pop-up menu (DecoratedPopupPanel) appears, but only for those nodes that have options. I have tried to employ either of the inner Handler implementations (on construction of a DefaultNodeInfo) to no success. Hopefully from the above code sample you can see what I'm trying to do. Here's a variant that adds a SelectionChangeEvent.Handler to SingleSelectionModel if (currNode.hasOptions()) { // add pop-up menu to this node if it has options
            selectionModel.addSelectionChangeHandler(new NavNodeSelectionHandler());
            result = new DefaultNodeInfo<NavNode>(getDataProvider(currNode), getCell(), selectionModel, null);
        }
 What's happening is that the attempt to cast the Event fails with a ClassCastException. I want to get a handle on an UIObject so I can position the popup. I think I need a handle on a TreeNode, but cannot see how to do it. The CellTree, TreeViewModel, SelectionModel and friends are some of the most obtuse API I've come across. Would really appreciate some help from a GWT expert!

@CONTENT:At the moment I have an Hibernate entity class as follows: @Entity
@Table(name = "entity")

 I've found that even when the non-timestamp fields are not modified (i.e. the data field) a call to merge still updates the timestamp. I would like the timestamp to only update when other data fields have changed. Is there anyway I can prevent calls to merge making a SQL UPDATE when all other data fields are not modified, or do I have to explicitly check for this myself in the code?

@LINK:/questions/8801508/google-app-engine-keyword-search-ordering-on-other-properties
@TITLE:Google App Engine - keyword search + ordering on other properties
@CONTENT:Say I have an entity that looks a bit like this: class MyEntity(db.Model):
    keywords            = db.StringListProperty()
    sortProp            = db.FloatProperty()
 I have a filter that does a keyword search by doing this: query = MyEntity.all()\
                .filter('keywords >=', unicode(kWord))\
                .filter('keywords <',  unicode(kWord) + u"\ufffd")\
                .order('keywords')
 Which works great. The issue I'm running into is that if I try to put an order on that using 'sortProp':                 .order('sortProp')
 ordering has no effect. I realize why - the documentation specifically says this is not possible and that sort order is ignored when using equality filters with a multi-valued property (from the Google docs): One important caveat is queries with both an equality filter and a sort order on a multi-valued property. In those queries, the sort order is disregarded. For single-valued properties, this is a simple optimization. Every result would have the same value for the property, so the results do not need to be sorted further. However, multi-valued properties may have additional values. Since the sort order is disregarded, the query results may be returned in a different order than if the sort order were applied. (Restoring the dropped sort order would be expensive and require extra indices, and this use case is rare, so the query planner leaves it off.) My question is: does anyone know of a good workaround for this? Is there a better way to do a keyword search that circumvents this limitation? I'd really like to combine using keywords with ordering for other properties. The only solution I can think of is sorting the list after the query, but if I do that I lose the ability to offset into the query and I may not even get the results with the highest sort order if the data set is large. Thanks for your tips!
@CODE:class MyEntity(db.Model):
    keywords            = db.StringListProperty()
    sortProp            = db.FloatProperty() query = MyEntity.all()\

@CONTENT:edit: My main question now is why these two operators need to be overloaded to use the && and || operators. Wouldn't the short-circuit operators take the true or false values of the objects and compare those? Where in the use of the && and || operators is | and & used? I'm reading C#, the complete reference, and I'm quite confused about the | and & operators. I'm used to them being bitwise operators that compare the bits of two integers, but they're explained as the original logical operators, to which && and || are the short-circuit versions that stop testing values when the statement is definitely going to be a certain value. Does this mean that the two operators have multiple uses, or that C# does do some behind the scenes type casting? Also, when using the && and || operators on a class, why do | and & have to be overloaded? Why can't just the true and false values for a class be overloaded?

 My first question is, I have a jsp page for login with the following code... <form action="/login" method="post" >
Username : <input name="username" type="text" />
Password : <input name="password" type="password" />
<input type="submit" />
</form>
 This gives a 404 but in my Controller, I've mapped the controller to /login with the code below... @Controller
public class LoginController {

    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(LoginController.class);

    /**
     * Simply selects the home view to render by returning its name.
     */
    @RequestMapping(value = "/login", method = RequestMethod.POST)
    public String home(Locale locale, Model model, String username, String password) {

        if(username.equalsIgnoreCase("david"))
        {
            logger.info("Welcome home! the client locale is "+ locale.toString());

            Date date = new Date();
            DateFormat dateFormat = DateFormat.getDateTimeInstance(DateFormat.LONG, DateFormat.LONG, locale);

            String formattedDate = dateFormat.format(date);

            model.addAttribute("serverTime", formattedDate );

            return "home";
        }
        else
        {
            return "void";
        }

    }

}
 My understanding is the @requestmapping should do the servlet mapping rather than in the web.xml, is this correct? The value of /WEB-INF/spring/appServlet/servlet-context.xml is shown below also if needed. <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

 So my first question is : is the servlet mapping done in the web.xml or at the @requestmapping in the controller class? Second question : what's the best way to architect this to have more pages, should I keep appending to the webxml? Should I create a controller for every url? Should I create a servlet-context for every url? Thanks for reading :)

@TITLE:How do you load an image from resource file in vb 2010 expresss?
@CONTENT:First of all Im new to vb 2010 and so far have enjoyed what I have been able to do with it. That being said I have run into an issue with my current project. Basically I have created a timer and all works well on that part. My issue lies in that my timer loads a .png for each minute/second and I was linking the images like so: Picturebox1.Image = Image.Fromfile("C:\timer\images\" & minutes.text & ".png")
Picturebox2.Image = Image.Fromfile("C:\timer\images\" & seconds.text & ".png")
 So running this on another pc rendered that bit of code useless as that computer did not have those files locally and the program would end in an error as it could not find the .png files. I did a bit of searching online and found a few sites and video tutorials how to read from the resource file. But in doing so I have been unable to make it function properly. So this is what I found here: Picturebox1.image = My.Resources.minutes.text
Picturebox2.image = My.Resources.seconds.text
 I know this bit of code is wrong as I'm now getting 2 errors in vb 2010. The only way I have managed to make this work is to specify the file name. But what I'm wanting to do is use whats in "minutes.text" and "seconds.text" to specify the file name. Is there a way around this? or do I have to use a bunch of if statements to do this? example: If minutes.text = 1 Then
picturebox1 = My.Resource._1
End If
If seconds.text = 12 Then
Picturebox2 = My.Resource._12
End If
 I would hate having to do a bunch of if statements if there is a simple fix. So I've come here for help.
@CODE:Picturebox1.Image = Image.Fromfile("C:\timer\images\" & minutes.text & ".png")
Picturebox2.Image = Image.Fromfile("C:\timer\images\" & seconds.text & ".png") Picturebox1.image = My.Resources.minutes.text
Picturebox2.image = My.Resources.seconds.text If minutes.text = 1 Then
picturebox1 = My.Resource._1
End If
If seconds.text = 12 Then
Picturebox2 = My.Resource._12
End If minutes

What's the problem with dock and anchor options? Is it a general problem with forms? Is it a general disadvantage of using .net components and windows forms? I don't have any custom events handled on control resize, so the problem is about the controls Microsoft developed. Should I avoid using dock=fill?

However, when I publish to a our Windows VPS, errors return the standard IIS error page. I have never administered a web server before, and I am not sure what settings I need to check to figure out why its not returning the custom errors I have set up. I have tried setting .net error pages for the app to off and on, with the default page set to the root site, as well as just '/'. I have also tried setting the error pages (under iis in 7.5) to custom and detailed. None of these seem to have any effect on the error page that is returned. What am I doing wrong here?

@TITLE:Excel Macro loading Arrays
@CONTENT:I am not sure how to phrase the question, but I have come up against an issue where I need to load a list of names from a group of sheets into seperate arrays. For example, Sheet 1, Column A has 10 names to be loaded into array1, Sheet 2, Column A has 14 names to be loaded into array2. I know this could be hard coded into a macro to load them all but the list of names is not a fixed length and shy of a lot of code I was wondering if this could be shortened. The way that my mind would tell me to do this is below. Dim tarray1 As Variant
Dim tarray2 As Variant
Dim tarray3 As Variant

For f = 1 To 3

    Sheets("Region " & f).Select
    With ActiveSheet
        lastrow = .Cells(.Rows.Count, "A").End(xlUp).Row
        tarray& f = ActiveSheet.Range("A2:A" & lastrow)
    End With


Next
 The actual sheet in question has 10 seperate sheets to have the names read in going from Region 1 to 10. So there will be 10 seperate tarrays. This is done for reporting purposes and will be passed back and forth around the sheets. However tarray & f is obviously not valid and will throw up compile errors. Can anyone think of a way to get around this? Hope someone can help.

@TITLE:Last x blog entries - but only once per user
@CONTENT:I would like to display a box with the last x (say 5) blog entries. But I would like to avoid that a very active user is listed twice. My tryout boils down to:     $stats['blog'] = $this->User->Blog->find('all', array(
        'order'=>array('Blog.published' => 'DESC'), 
        'conditions' => array('Blog.status' => 1), 
        'contain' => array('User.username'),
        'group' => array('User.id'),
        'limit' => 5,
    ));
 But - of course - it groups too soon without the chance of sorting it first. The resulting sql often loses the last published blog entries of a user in favor of one of his older ones: SELECT * 
FROM `comm_blogs` AS `Blog` 
LEFT JOIN `comm_users` AS `User` ON (`Blog`.`user_id` = `User`.`id`) 
WHERE `Blog`.`status` = 1 
GROUP BY `User`.`id` 
ORDER BY `Blog`.`published` DESC LIMIT 5
 Therefore the result is almost completely wrong all the time because the new blog entries never show up if this user already blogged about something else in the past. How can I first sort by published DESC before grouping? Or is there another convenient way? Thx The stucture of the tables: users: - id
- username
 blogs: - id
- user_id
- published (datetime)
- title
- content
- status

@TITLE:How to find out why an ASP.NET web application is being restarted
@CONTENT:In my web application Application.End is called after every request for some reason and the application is restarted. When I set a breakpoint in Applicaion_End I don't get a useful stack trace. Furthermore, there are no entries in Event Viewer. According to MSDN, the following could cause an application restart: Adding, modifying, or deleting assemblies from the application's Bin folder. Adding, modifying, or deleting localization resources from the App_GlobalResources or App_LocalResources folders. Adding, modifying, or deleting the application's Global.asax file. Adding, modifying, or deleting source code files in the App_Code directory. Adding, modifying, or deleting Profile configuration. Adding, modifying, or deleting Web service references in the App_WebReferences directory. Adding, modifying, or deleting the application's Web.config file. I guess that my code changes some file which triggers an application restart. Is there any way to find out what exactly causes the application restarts? Edit: I solved my problem now by stepping through the code and watching the timestamps in Explorer. On application startup I'm reading a value from an access database which causes a .ldb file to be created and deleted. However, this question has not been answered yet. Is there any log that keeps record of such events that cause the application to be restarted?

@TITLE:Java IllegalStateMonitorException while holding the lock
@CONTENT:I have written a class in java that implements a double buffer. The class has two methods to write into the two buffers and a method to clear them. Then I have three thread: one that writes on the first buffer, another that writes on the second buffer and a third one that clears the buffers. Here, I paste (a piece of) the code that causes the problem (I know that it is not correct, but i've simplified it for debugging purposes): public void addAlpha(int toAdd){
synchronized (alphaCount) {
    while(alphaCount >= alpha.length){
        try {
        alphaCount.wait();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        }
    }

    alpha[alphaCount] = toAdd;
    alphaCount++;
    }
}
 And here the piece in which i call the notifyAll(): public void clear(){
    synchronized (alphaCount) {
        alphaCount = 0;
        alphaCount.notifyAll();
    }
}
 As you can see, in the addAlpha method, I get the lock on alphaCount, test the condition and then wait on the alphaCount object. In the clear method, i get the lock on alphaCount and I call notifyAll() on it. At runtime, I get the IllegalStateMonitorException... But I really don't know where the error is: I checked the documentation and more than one forum, without any luck... Thanks for your time and your attention, Rick.

@LINK:/questions/8635666/mpeg-ts-segments-http-live-streaming
@TITLE:MPEG-TS Segments HTTP Live Streaming
@CONTENT:I'm trying to interleave MPEG-TS segments but failing. One set of segments was actually captured using the built in camera in the laptop, then encoded using FFMPEG with the following command: ffmpeg -er 4 -y -f video4linux2 -s 640x480 -r 30 -i %s -isync -f mpegts -acodec libmp3lame -ar 48000 -ab 64k -s 640x480 -vcodec libx264 -fflags +genpts -b 386k -coder 0 -me_range 16 -keyint_min 25 -i_qfactor 0.71 -bt 386k -maxrate 386k -bufsize 386k -qcomp 0.6 -qmin 10 -qmax 51 -qdiff 4 -aspect 640:480
 And the other one is an avi file that was encoded using the following command: fmpeg -er 4 -y -f avi -s 640x480 -r 30 -i ./DSCF2021.AVI -vbsf dump_extra -f mpegts -acodec libmp3lame -ar 48000 -ab 64k -s 640x480 -vcodec libx264 -fflags +genpts -b 386k -coder 0 -me_range 16 -keyint_min 25 -i_qfactor 0.71 -bt 386k -maxrate 386k -bufsize 386k -qcomp 0.6 -qmin 10 -qmax 51 -qdiff 4 -aspect 640:480
 Then the output is segmented into ts segments using an open source segmenter. If both come from the same source (both from the camera) they work fine. However in this case, the second set of segments freeze. Time passes, but the video does not move.. So i think it's an encoding problem. So my question is, how should i change the ffmpeg command for this to work? By interleave I mean, having a playlist with the first set of segments, and another playlist with the other set of segments, and having the client call one then the other (HTTP Live Streaming) The ffprobe output of one of the first set of segments: Input #0, mpegts, from 'live1.ts':

@CONTENT:i have a Server based on ThreadingTCPServer. Now i want to add SSL Support to that Server. Without SSL it works fine but with SSLv3 I cant connect a Client to the Server, it always throws an exception: Error 111 Connection Refused. The error mens there's no SSL Server on that port. I added the SSL Support based on an example I found here at Stackoverflow. Here's my code: Server: class BeastServer(SocketServer.ThreadingMixIn, SocketServer.TCPServer):

@LINK:/questions/8580780/editorfor-on-nullable-datetime-nullable-object-must-have-a-value
@TITLE:EditorFor on nullable DateTime - Nullable object must have a value.
@CONTENT:I am attempting to display a form that allows a user to input a new assignment for a person. I'm using a DateTime.cshtml EditorTemplate to handle DateTime values for the assignment. The non-nullable DateTime works fine. The nullable DateTime causes an "InvalidOperationException: Nullable object must have a value." I have a simple viewmodel that looks like this: AssignmentViewModel.cs: public Person Person { get; set; }
public Assignment NewAssignment { get; set; }
 Assignment.cs contains: public DateTime AssignmentStartDate { get; set; }
public DateTime? AssignmentEndDate { get; set; }
 My AssignmentController Create() method looks like: public ViewResult Create(int personId)
{
    Person person = personRepository.GetPersonById(personId);
    var newAssignment = new AssignmentViewModel { Person = person, NewAssignment = new Assignment() };
    return View(newAssignment);
}
 My Create.cshtml view looks like this: @model AssignmentViewModel

@using (Html.BeginForm("Create", "Assignment"))
{
    @Html.Hidden("NewAssignment.PersonId", Model.Person.PersonId)
    @Html.LabelFor(x => x.NewAssignment.AssignmentStartDate):
    @Html.EditorFor(x => x.NewAssignment.AssignmentStartDate.Date, new { cssClass = "datePicker" })
    <br />
    @Html.LabelFor(x => x.NewAssignment.AssignmentEndDate):
    @Html.EditorFor(x => x.NewAssignment.AssignmentEndDate.Value.Date, new { cssClass = "datePicker" })
    <br />
    <input type="submit" value="Send />
}
 My DateTime.cshtml EditorTemplate looks like: @model DateTime?

@{
    String modelValue = "";
    if (Model.HasValue)
    {
        if (Model.Value != DateTime.MinValue)
        {
            modelValue = Model.Value.ToShortDateString();
        }
    }
}

@Html.TextBox("", modelValue, new { @class = "datePicker" })
 When I attempt to load the Create view, I get the exception mentioned above on the line "@Html.EditorFor(x => x.NewAssignment.AssignmentEndDate.Value)". You may be wondering why I'm passing in AssignmentEndDate.Value.Date instead of just passing in AssignmentEndDate; the reason is because I'm trying to get to the point where I'm splitting DateTime into Date and a TimeOfDay field and recombine them with a DateTimeModelBinder. I am using a similar technique to the one shown here and here. I -can- bypass the error, by changing my controller Create() method to instantiate the ViewModel with AssignmentEndDate set to DateTime.MinValue, but this seems completely wrong for a nullable DateTime: var newAssignment = new AssignmentViewModel 
                        { 
                            Person = person, 
                            NewAssignment = new Assignment { AssignmentEndDate = DateTime.MinValue } 
                        };
 Something strange happens after I "bypass" the error by supplying a value for the nullable DateTime; the un-required nullable DateTime property (AssignmentEndDate.Date) fails client side validation. Trying to submit the form highlights the field in red. How can I handle this correctly?
@CODE:public Person Person { get; set; }
public Assignment NewAssignment { get; set; } public DateTime AssignmentStartDate { get; set; }
public DateTime? AssignmentEndDate { get; set; } public ViewResult Create(int personId)
{
    Person person = personRepository.GetPersonById(personId);
    var newAssignment = new AssignmentViewModel { Person = person, NewAssignment = new Assignment() };
    return View(newAssignment);
} @model AssignmentViewModel

@using (Html.BeginForm("Create", "Assignment"))
{
    @Html.Hidden("NewAssignment.PersonId", Model.Person.PersonId)
    @Html.LabelFor(x => x.NewAssignment.AssignmentStartDate):
    @Html.EditorFor(x => x.NewAssignment.AssignmentStartDate.Date, new { cssClass = "datePicker" })
    <br />
    @Html.LabelFor(x => x.NewAssignment.AssignmentEndDate):
    @Html.EditorFor(x => x.NewAssignment.AssignmentEndDate.Value.Date, new { cssClass = "datePicker" })
    <br />
    <input type="submit" value="Send />
} @model DateTime?

@{
    String modelValue = "";
    if (Model.HasValue)
    {
        if (Model.Value != DateTime.MinValue)
        {
            modelValue = Model.Value.ToShortDateString();
        }
    }
}

@Html.TextBox("", modelValue, new { @class = "datePicker" }) var newAssignment = new AssignmentViewModel 
                        { 
                            Person = person, 
                            NewAssignment = new Assignment { AssignmentEndDate = DateTime.MinValue }

@TITLE:How to zip a directory in iOS with ZipKit?
@CONTENT:I need to zip a subdirectory of my Documents folder in an iOS app. After consulting Google and other SO posts, I've found ZipKit and ZipArchive as two open source projects offering this functionality. At this point, I've chosen to implement ZipKit, as it seems to be much more currently maintained than ZipArchive. I've found examples of how to unzip archives, but haven't been able to find an example of how to archive a directory into a .zip file. I have tried the following code, which returned a successful result status, but no zip file was actually generated. // projectPath is /Documents/projects/myproject
ZKDataArchive *archive = [[ZKDataArchive alloc] init];
NSInteger result = [archive deflateDirectory:projectPath relativeToPath:nil usingResourceFork:NO];
 I'm sure there's something basic I'm not doing correctly, but haven't been able to sort out what it is. In particular, I haven't yet figured out the meaning of each parameter to deflateDirectory:. If anyone can point me in the right direction (or has other recommendations for zipping directories on iOS) I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks!

@TITLE:.htaccess mod_rewrite subdirectory to URL parameter
@CONTENT:I hope this was not asked over and over again before, but I didn't get further to an answer using google, w3schools and so on. So here is my question: I'm writing a script that creates kind of an index of projects that I have on my homepage and makes a nice list with images and teaser text based on an info file. I mostly have my projects on github and the readme is in markdown so I thought I could dynamically generate the HTML from the markdown of the latest blob from github on demand using PHP so it gets updated automatically. My directory structure looks like this: projects
    project1
        .remoteindex
        .info
    project2
        .remoteindex
        .info
    index.php
    .htaccess
 So when just domain.tld/projects/ is requested I get the info from .info and make a nice index of all projects. But if domain.tld/projects/project1/ is request it, I want to internally redirect it to domain.tld/projects/?dir=project1 to do my markdown parsing and so on. But domain.tld/projects/project1/image.png should not be redirected. This is what I tried: .htaccess
RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule ^([^/]+)/?$ index.php?dir=$1 [R,L]
 I made it redirect instead of rewrite so that I can see what the error is because I just got an 404. The URL that I get redirected to is domain.tld/home/www/web310/html/projects/index.php?dir=project1 so obviously there is something going wrong with the internal structure of the web server an paths an whatever. I hope you can understand my problem an I would be very pleased if someone could help me, because I'm totally lost on .htaccess anyway. Edit: See my answer below for the used .htaccess. The strange thing is that if I have an index.html in on of the subdirectories, my local web server (Apache with XAMPP for Mac OS X 1.7.3) does not rewrite and the index.html gets displayed, without one it works correctly.But on my real web server that serves my homepage it rewrites both with and without index.html (which is what I want). Any hints on that?

@LINK:/questions/8518046/programmatically-get-expression-value-of-facelets-parameter-variable
@TITLE:Programmatically get expression value of facelets parameter (variable)
@CONTENT:Following java code allows to access any object or variable from faces context: ELContext elCtx = facesContext.getELContext();
ExpressionFactory exprFac = facesContext.getApplication().getExpressionFactory();
MyProperty myProperty = (MyProperty) exprFac.createValueExpression(elCtx, "#{somebean.someattr.someproperty}", MyProperty.class).getValue(elCtx);
 I use the code from within my custom converter to read additional converting parameters from context. The code works correctly if #{somebean} is defined as normal backing bean within JSF context. Facelets allow to create 'shortcut' to JSF expressions. Example: <ui:param name="shortcut" value="#{somebean.someattr.someproperty}" />
<div>#{somebean.someattr.someproperty} equals #{shortcut}</div>
 In this case both #{somebean.someattr.someproperty} and #{shortcut} have the same value. However these 'shortcut' names are not accessible using java code above. For example: MyProperty myProperty1 = (MyProperty) exprFac.createValueExpression(elCtx, "#{somebean.someattr.someproperty}", MyProperty.class).getValue(elCtx);
// myProperty1 has expected value

MyProperty myProperty2 = (MyProperty) exprFac.createValueExpression(elCtx, "#{shortcut}", MyProperty.class).getValue(elCtx);
// myProperty2 is null
 Is there a way to access a facelets context and to read 'shortcut' parameter values, defined on the current JSF page?
@CODE:ELContext elCtx = facesContext.getELContext();
ExpressionFactory exprFac = facesContext.getApplication().getExpressionFactory();
MyProperty myProperty = (MyProperty) exprFac.createValueExpression(elCtx, "#{somebean.someattr.someproperty}", MyProperty.class).getValue(elCtx); #{somebean} <ui:param name="shortcut" value="#{somebean.someattr.someproperty}" />

// myProperty1 has expected value

 I've contemplated saving it to a temporary file with FileWriter API and then upload it, but that just isn't right. When answering, take into account: The server can't be modified, nor i'm willing to select another server provider. It must work at least on Firefox and Chrome (my app is alredy limited to those two browsers).

@CONTENT:I have been looking for tutorials on how to add and remove a class from a link unfortunately without any success. All the earlier questions on this have give me some understanding, but haven't give me the result I want to accomplish. I'm trying to have an active state for my navigation, by adding and removing a class when the link is clicked. Here is what I have as far as JavaScript: $(document).ready(function(){

            $this.parent().addClass('active');

        });
    });
});
 And this is my navigation: <div id="nav">

@LINK:/questions/8357018/animation-with-infinite-scrollview
@TITLE:animation with infinite scrollView
@CONTENT:I have 5 pictures inside an infinite scrollView. So in order to make that scrollView infinite/circular I positioned my images like this: 5 1 2 3 4 5 1 meaning: last picture first picture second picture.....last picture first picture And in order for it to become infinite I have the following code: - (void)scrollViewDidEndDecelerating:(UIScrollView *)scrollView
{
    if(self.scrollView.contentOffset.x == 0){

    [self.scrollView scrollRectToVisible:CGRectMake(self.view.frame.size.width*pathImages.count, 0, self.view.frame.size.width, self.view.frame.size.height) animated:NO];  
        }
    else if (self.scrollView.contentOffset.x == self.view.frame.size.width*(pathImages.count+1)) {         

    [self.scrollView scrollRectToVisible:CGRectMake(self.view.frame.size.width,0 ,self.view.frame.size.width, self.view.frame.size.height) animated:NO];    
    }
}
 which means that when I'm at the last picture the contentOffset of the scrollView is set to go to the first picture-in this way I get an infinite scrollView.   What I wanted next was for my scrollView to slide automatically-for this I set a timer which calls one method-onTimer:

- (void) onTimer{
    NSLog(@"flip pages");
    if(h < pathImages.count*self.view.frame.size.width)
    {
        h+= self.view.frame.size.width;

    }
    else
    {
        h=self.view.frame.size.width;
    }

    if(self.scrollView.contentOffset.x == 0){

        [self.scrollView scrollRectToVisible:CGRectMake(self.view.frame.size.width*pathImages.count, 0, self.view.frame.size.width, self.view.frame.size.height) animated:NO];  

    }

    if (self.scrollView.contentOffset.x == self.view.frame.size.width*pathImages.count)         

    {      

        [self.scrollView scrollRectToVisible:CGRectMake(self.view.frame.size.width,0 ,self.view.frame.size.width, self.view.frame.size.height) animated:NO];                         

    }

    else

    [UIView animateWithDuration:1 
                          delay:0 
                        options:UIViewAnimationOptionCurveEaseInOut 
                     animations:^{ self.scrollView.contentOffset = CGPointMake(h, 0); } 
                     completion:NULL];
}
 This magic line: [UIView animateWithDuration:1 
                              delay:0 
                            options:UIViewAnimationOptionCurveEaseInOut 
                         animations:^{ self.scrollView.contentOffset = CGPointMake(h, 0); } 
                         completion:NULL];
 does the scoll automatically with animation. Everything is great except this: after I view the last picture I should set the offset of scroll view in order to get back to the first picture with animation. Well if I do that: if (self.scrollView.contentOffset.x == self.view.frame.size.width*pathImages.count)         
            {      
        [UIView animateWithDuration:1 
                                  delay:0 
                                options:UIViewAnimationOptionCurveEaseInOut 
                             animations:^{     [self.scrollView scrollRectToVisible:CGRectMake(self.view.frame.size.width,0 ,self.view.frame.size.width, self.view.frame.size.height) animated:NO];  } 
                             completion:NULL];                        

        }
 after the last picture is viewed in order to get to the first picture...it loops through all the other pictures. What I want is this:after I view the last picture to get me back to the first picture which should be loaded on screen using animation, but without viewing all the other pictures between them.Thanks

@TITLE:Multilateration of GPS Coordinates
@CONTENT:I have N GPS coordinates with N distances given to an unknown position which I wish to determine. My first approach was to use just three points and trilateration, exactly as described here. This approach was already quite accurate (best error~5km), but I would like to improve this and increase the robustness. Because the given distances are not very accurate to begin with, I thought about using multiple measurements and multilateration. However, it turned out that this approach is by far less accurate (best error~100km) although I provide more than 3 points/distances (tested with up to 6) and now I am asking, if someone has an idea what I could have done wrong. In short, my approach for multilateration is as follows: Convert all coordinates into ECEF Build a matrix as described in Eq.7 at wikipedia Use SVD to find the minimizer As the solution is only up to scale, I use a root-finding approach to determine a normalization so that the coordinates converted back into LLA result in a height of 0 (my initial assumption is that all coordinates are at zero height) Convert back into LLA LLA/ECEF conversion is double-checked and correct. Step 2 and 3 I've checked with euclidean coordinates (and exact distances) and appear correct. I came up with step 4 by myself, I have no clue if this is a good approach at all, so suggestions are welcome. +++UPDATE I've put together sample code in python to illustrate the problem with some ground truth. Trilateration gets as close as 400m, while Multilateration ranges at 10-130km here. Because of length, I've put it at ideone

Surely if they can read what the salt value is for that hashed password, they can work out what the hashed password is without the salt and then use a rainbow table? Or is it a good idea to encrypt the salt value too with something that is reversible? If the salt value is stored in plain-text, I just cannot see the point of it. Please enlighten me?

@CONTENT:I'm working on an application that will be available for Android and iPhone. The application is done using jQuery Mobile and compiled with Phonegap. Sometimes in the application a user can display an image, this image is very large, and needs to be scrollable. I've done a javascript code that creates a div with theses css properties and appends it to the body: position: absolute;
width: 100%;
height: 100%;
z-index: 1200;
background-color: black;
overflow: scroll;
 On iPhone it works perfectly, the user can scroll as far as he wants on the right. On Android it doesn't, the screen stays locked and the user can only scrolldown. The viewport on the index.html page is like this: <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1" />
 I've spend about 2 hours playing with it, looking on the internet, but didn't find anything that made the screen to be scrollable on Android. I cannot make it be another page, with a different viewport because my application is very deeply javascripted. And I wouldn't be able to bring back the user to the exact spot where he left when he wanted to view the image. I'm running out of ideas, and have been testing it for a few days. Would someone have an idea that would help me to make a scrollable popup on android ? Thank you

@TITLE:Objective C: Using UIImage for Stroking
@CONTENT:I am trying to apply a texture for my brush but i'm really having a hard time figuring how it is done. Here's the image of my output. I used an UIImage that just follows the touch on the screen but when i swipe it faster the result is on the right side "W", and on the left side that's the result when i swipe it slow. i tried using the CGContextMoveToPoint and CGContextAddLineToPoint i don't know how apply the texture. Is it possible to use UIImage for the stroke texture? Here's my code     UIImage * brushImageTexture = [UIImage imageNamed:@"brushImage.png"]; 
    [brushImagetexture drawAtPoint:CGPointMake(touchCurrentPosition.x, touchVurrentPosition.y) blendMode:blendMode alpha:1.0f];

@CONTENT:We are using PostgreSQL. My requirement is to delete unused sequences from my database. For example, if I create any table through my application, one sequence will be created, but for deleting the table we are not deleting the sequence, too. If want to create the same table another sequence is being created. Example: table: file; automatically created sequence for id coumn: file_id_seq When I delete the table file and create it with same name again, a new sequence is being created (i.e. file_id_seq1). I have accumulated a huge number of unused sequences in my application database this way. How to delete these unused sequences?

@TITLE:Transparent PNGs in Monotouch for iOS
@CONTENT:I have a problem, and I 've been searching for months for a solution before posting here. The problem is about transparent PNG files in Monotouch: I am trying to load a transparent PNG in a context in order to read and write pixel colors. I am using the code below, which works perfectly with non-transparent PNGs. (I am also including several other attempts made while trying to get the correct result) With transparent PNGs the problem seems to be that I have to load the image in the context with premultiplied alpha info (CGImageAlphaInfo.PremultipliedLast). This causes RGB values to be altered from their original values when loaded in the context. I tried to create a context with CGImageAlphaInfo.Last (which is theoretically correct), but I get an exception (not acceptable parameter combination). I thought of trying with CoreImage, but this would restrict our users to iOS 5 or later and I decided that this is not acceptable. I desperately need to find a way to get and set pixels in transparent PNGs, since I am creating a cross platform software (iPhone, iPad, Mac using MonoMac and Windows) that needs to process transparent PNGs. Any help will be greatly appreciated. Thanks! using System;

@LINK:/questions/8240124/a-custom-login-page-for-azure-acs-not-working
@TITLE:A custom login page for Azure ACS not working
@CONTENT:I downloaded the sample login page from the ACS portal for my application, which is a html file. I then configured my application with WIF, and everything worked perfectly. Since we need to handle and save an incoming querystring, so that querystring can be used later after the user had been logged in, we needed to move the html login page to a aspx page. The problem is that when I change the issuer for WIF in the web.config file to the aspx file, it stops working. When it works it looks like this: <certificateValidation certificateValidationMode="None" />
  <federatedAuthentication>
    <wsFederation passiveRedirectEnabled="true" issuer="http://localhost:81/acstest/WebSiteAdvancedACSLoginPageCode.html" realm="http://localhost:81/acstest/" requireHttps="false" />
    <cookieHandler requireSsl="false" />
  </federatedAuthentication>
 But then when I change it to my aspx page, where I just moved all the code in the html page into, I cant even load the page: <certificateValidation certificateValidationMode="None" />
  <federatedAuthentication>
    <wsFederation passiveRedirectEnabled="true" issuer="http://localhost:81/acstest/WebSiteAdvancedACSLoginPageCode.aspx" realm="http://localhost:81/acstest/" requireHttps="false" />
    <cookieHandler requireSsl="false" />
  </federatedAuthentication>
 When I then run with the aspx file configured I can see in fiddler that something isn't right, It tries to a get, and keeps getting "object moved to here:" This is the get request: GET http://localhost:81/acstest/WebSiteAdvancedACSLoginPageCode.aspx?wa=wsignin1.0&wtrealm=http%3a%2f%2flocalhost%3a81%2facstest%2f&wctx=rm%3d0%26id%3dpassive%26ru%3d%252facstest%252fWebSiteAdvancedACSLoginPageCode.aspx&wct=2011-11-23T09%3a33%3a30Z HTTP/1.1

@TITLE:How can I do an Amazon App Store search using an Intent and filter it by developer name?
@CONTENT:Is there a way to start an Intent on the Kindle Fire that will cause the AppStore app to open and display all the apps for a certain developer? For instance, on a phone/tablet with the Android Market installed, I can do this:            Intent otherApps = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW,Uri.parse("market://search?q=pub:\"" + developerName + "\""));
           activity.startActivity(otherApps);
 And show all my apps in the Android Market. Can I do that with the Amazon App Store? If so, how? I've tried that Intent with other seemingly valid names (such as "ZeptoLab") and I don't get any filtering. It just drops me in the full unfiltered App Store. Looking up a specific app with "market://details?id=package.name" does seem to work.

@LINK:/questions/8230682/atmosphere-jersey-bidirectional-conversation
@TITLE:Atmosphere/Jersey bidirectional conversation
@CONTENT:I've seen a number of Atmosphere examples including pub-sub. I want to do something like pub-sub (client subscribes to a channel that is unique to that client; server periodically publishes to that channel), except that the client will send data to the server as well. The client will send data in response to data sent by the server and in other cases when something important happens on the client that the server needs to know about (which the server doesn't need to acknowledge). Is it even possible to do this with Atmosphere? It might look something like this: @Stateless
@Path("/id/{clientId}/key/{clientKey}")
public class MyService {
    @POST
    @Produces("application/xml")
    @Consumes("application/xml")
    @Suspend
    public StreamingOutput subscribe(@PathParam("clientId") String clientId,
                                     @PathParam("clientKey") String clientKey,
                                     @Context Broadcaster broadcaster,
                                     InputStream body) {
        if (!authenticate(clientId, clientKey) {
            throw new WebApplicationException(401);
        }
        broadcaster.setID(clientId);

        // Do something here... Not sure what
    }
}
 But there are a couple of problems here: The incoming connection will suspend, so it won't be able to send anything to the server except when resumed via broadcast; Any usage of the InputStream will result in blocking I/O, which kind of defeats the purpose of using Atmosphere. Both of these problems could be solved simply by removing @Suspend, but then I'm in the thread-per-connection situation. I get the feeling that Atmosphere isn't going to be the appropriate technology here and perhaps I might have to do something a bit lower level. But I'm not sure how to go about it. Ideas? Edit: I can't find a straightforward way of parsing XML asynchronously anyway, so this whole thing is looking less like something that can be done asynchronously.
@CODE:@Stateless
@Path("/id/{clientId}/key/{clientKey}")

@TITLE:ASP.NET MVC 3 - Model Validation
@CONTENT:I'm just learning MVC and I have a few questions about the design/how things are supposed to work. I'm using MVC 3 and Razor, with Entity Framework classes (e.g. Location) and I'm going to create a buddy class with Validation annotations. In my View, I have a Partial View that renders a DevExpress TreeView (using a list of Locations) and a Form for creating/editing the Locations in the Tree. I have a LocationController, a LocationManagementView, a LocationManagementPartialView (contains the code for tree view), and a LocationModel. The LocationModel will hold the buddy class and get methods for getting children (the children are only fetched after a node is expanded). I have a service wrapper (for my service client) that will be injected using StructureMap. Should I inject the service wrapper into the Controller's constructor or into the Model's constructor? Also, my Model has get methods that use the service wrapper to fetch data from the database (do those methods belong here in the Model?): for example, GetChildren for the tree view. Also, is it correct to store the Location buddy class in the Model? I want to make sure I design this application well, as it's part of a much bigger project. Any design pointers are much appreciated. I've been reading ScottGu's blog for the MVC stuff. Ref: http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/01/15/asp-net-mvc-2-model-validation.aspx

 The code above works fine in ios 4.2 but not in ios 5. I have the code in applicationDidfinishingLaunching method. Due to error, black screen appears and app exits. Only recurrenceRules has changed in ios 5 and I have not made use of it. All other properties are available in superclass EKCalendarItem. I cannot test it since I have xcode 3.2 and snow leopard. I am looking to debug the line at which error occurs causing the app to quit. I doubt it is related to setCalendar or using alarms property.

@TITLE:Using inst/extdata with vignette during package checking R 2.14.0
@CONTENT:I have a package which contains a csv file which I put in inst/extdata per R-exts. This file is needed for the vignette. If I Sweave the vignette directly, all works well. When I run R --vanilla CMD check however, the check process can't find the file. I know it has been moved into an .Rcheck directory during checking and this is probably part of the problem. But I don't know how to set it up so both direct Sweave and vignette building/checking works. The vignette contains a line like this: EC1 <- dot2HPD(file = "../inst/extdata/E_coli/ecoli.dot",
node.inst = "../inst/extdata/E_coli/NodeInst.csv",
 and the function dot2HPD accesses the file via:     ni <- read.csv(node.inst)
 Here's the error message:     > tab <- read.csv("../inst/extdata/E_coli/NodeInst.csv")

@TITLE:How to automatically update a MYSQL column value using formula and data from other columns in same row?
@CONTENT:Question on mySQL. I have a table with columns like below: BasePrice, Discount, NetPrice
 Now assume that the calculation of net price happens like below: NetPrice = BasePrice - Discount
 Now, I do not mind entering the BasePrice and Discount values into the column on my own, manually using phpMyadmin (that is, direct backend updation). Since the NetPrice value involves calculation as shown above, I do not want to update the column value for each row in the table, but would prefer the database updating it automatically for me ( not that I am weak at math :) ). Is there someway to have the database update the NetPrice column value automatically? I know I can use php to get the other two column values, calculate and then update the NetPrice value, again using php code, but would prefer the db doing it on its own without any php/server side scripting. I use mySQL and phpMyadmin for dev. Thanks.

@TITLE:Tagging people in wall post with POST to Facebook Graph API
@CONTENT:I'm having some serious trouble with tagging people in a wall post. I'm working with CakePHP right now and using the FB API to POST to the Graph API. Here's the code:     $theMsg1 = $this->Connect->user('name').' tagged ';
    $theMsg2 = $friendName.' on the IF Tag website.';
    $msg1Len = strlen($theMsg1);
    $fbNameLen = strlen($friendName);`

    $fbcall = FB::api($fbID.'/feed', 'POST', array(
        'name'    => $theTag['Tag']['name'],
        'caption' => 'IF Tag is an application that allows you to interact with people on Facebook.',
        'message' => $theMsg1.$theMsg2,

            'link' => 'iftag.local'
        )
    ));
 From what I understand and what I've read I'm supposed to use the message_tags object to tag people in a post but it's not working at all. It doesn't give any errors, just doesn't tag. I've also tried using @[{userid}:1:{username}] from other posts I've seen but that doesn't seem to work with the current iteration of the API.

 I have three different interceptors for a reason, though the StaticsHandlerInterceptor is just the preHandle method returning true (for all of my static content (js, css, etc)). The second one is for AJAX requests. The third one is for actual pages.

var finishInit = function() {
    alert(imagesToLoad);
    imagesToLoad--;
    if (imagesToLoad == 0) {
       // remaining initializations

this._prevIcon.onload = finishInit;

 To my surprise, when executed the displayed dialogs read 4,4,4,4 in Firefox 7 and 4,3,2,4 in IE 9. I'm confused becaused I believed that JS is single-threaded and thus one event handler should not interrupt another. Where's the catch (or my mistake)? Thanks in advance. Best regards, Tomek

@TITLE:Android: How do I totally remove an Activity from the Activity Stack?
@CONTENT:I have two Activities FirstActivity and SecondActivity. FirstActivity has an intent filter MAIN, LAUNCHER and DEFAULT. SecondActivity is just a normal activity and no other flags is set in the AndroidManifest. My application is C2DM enabled and when a notification is received a taskbar Icon is displayed and when clicked it opens SecondActivity. Arrival of Notifications has two scenarios: First, My Application is Already Running when notification arrived and second My Application is totally not running. On the first scenario, everything is fine. A notification is received, i clicked from the notification drop down and my SecondActivity is displayed. When I press back SecondActivity is finished and application goes to the background. When I start my application again from Recent Applications, it displays FirstActivity which is correct since its the MAIN, LAUNCHER and DEFAULT. On the Second Scenario, A notification is received, I clicked it from the notification drop down and my SecondActivity is displayed. When I press back SecondActivity is finished and application goes to the background. When I start my application again from recent Applications, it displays SecondActivity which is wrong. I am expecting FirstActivity to be displayed because it should be a fresh start. I tried ForceKilling the application after the second scenario but the result is the same, I needed to restart my phone to be able to start from FirstActivity Again. Have you guys encountered the same problem? or is it just me? What do you think is wrong with my configuration? I also tried setting noHistory=false to SecondActivity but still the results are the same.

@CONTENT:I try to add labels to bars in a lattice barchart with multiple panels. I end up with way too many labels (every label is in every panel). Here is my code: library(lattice)
data(iris)

barchart(seq(1,50) ~ Petal.Width + Petal.Length | Species, data = iris, stack = TRUE,
         panel=function(x, y, ...) {

@CONTENT:I have a TreeView helper which takes list of categories and its links. I did that with @helper TreeView(FavouriteLinksXmlMVC3.Controllers.HomeController cat)

         Response.Write( e.ToString() );
      }

 Good. It's work like a charm. I did a function which takes a link information with JQuery :  $(".file").click(function () {
         $.ajax({
            url: '@Url.Action("GetLinkInfo")',
            data: { cat_name: $(this).attr("categ_name"), url: $(this).attr("id") },
            type: "GET",
            success: function (data) {
               //alert(data.Name + " " + data.Url + " " + data.Description);
               var make = "<table style='border-collapse:collapse' border='1'><tr><td>Name:</td><td>" + data.Name + "</td></tr><tr><td>Url:</td><td>" + data.Url + "</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td>" + data.Description + "</td></tr></table>";
               $("#details").html(make);
            }
         });
      });
 And the GetLinkInfo [HttpGet]
       public ActionResult GetLinkInfo( string cat_name, string url ) {
          if ( string.IsNullOrEmpty( cat_name ) )
             throw new ArgumentNullException( "GetLinkInfo cat_name" );
          if ( string.IsNullOrEmpty( url ) )
             throw new ArgumentNullException( "GetLinkInfo url" );

          var c = this.Categories.Find( x => x.Name == cat_name );
          string name1="", url1="", descr1="";
          bool done = false;

          if ( c != null ) {
             foreach ( var p in c.Links ) {
                if ( p.Url == url ) {
                   name1 = p.Name;
                   url1 = p.Url;
                   descr1 = p.Description;
                   done = true;
                   break;
                }
             }
          }

          if ( done ) {
             return Json(
                new {
                   Name = name1,
                   Url = url1,
                   Description = descr1
                },
                JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet
                );
          } else {
             return View();
          }
       }
 I solved the problem with this [HttpGet] //controller
       public JsonResult GetCategoryInfo( string cat_name ) {
          if ( string.IsNullOrEmpty( cat_name ) )
             throw new ArgumentNullException( "GetCategoryInfo cat_name" );

          var c = this.Categories.Find( x => x.Name == cat_name );

          if ( c != null ) {
             List<LinksControl> lk = null;
             if ( c.hasChild ) {
                lk = new List<LinksControl>();

                foreach ( var p in c.Links ) {
                   lk.Add( p );
                }
             } else {
                lk = new List<LinksControl>( 0 );
             }
             return this.Json(lk,JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet);
          } else {
             return this.Json(new List<LinksControl>( 0 ),JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet);
          }

       }
 And the JQuery $(".folder").click(function() {
   var find_id = $(this).attr("id");

$.ajax({
           type: "GET",
           url: '@Url.Action("GetCategoryInfo")',

@TITLE:How do I get the size of a pygtk window?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to use gtk.window.get_size(), but it always just returns the default width and height. The documentation says The get_size() method returns a tuple containing the current width and height of the window. If the window is not on-screen, it returns the size PyGTK will suggest to the window manager for the initial window size. The size obtained by the get_size() method is the last size received in a configure event, that is, PyGTK uses its locally-stored size, rather than querying the X server for the size. As a result, if you call the resize() method then immediately call the get_size() method, the size won't have taken effect yet. After the window manager processes the resize request, PyGTK receives notification that the size has changed via a configure event, and the size of the window gets updated. I've tried resizing the window manually and waiting a minute or so, but I still get the default width and height. I'm trying to use this to save the window size on quit so that I can restore it on start. Is there a better way to do this? Here's the code snipit I have for my main quit. def on_main_window_destroy(self, widget, data=None):
    if self.view.current_view.layout == 'list':
        self.view.current_view.set_column_order()

    width = self.main_window.get_size()[0]
    height = self.main_window.get_size()[1]
    #test statement
    print (width, height)

    self.prefs.set_size_prefs(width, height)
    self.prefs.set_view_prefs(self.view.current_view.media, self.view.current_view.layout)
    gtk.main_quit()
 I think I understand what's happening now. This is inside the destroy signal, so by the time the code gets called, the window is already gone. Is there a more canonical way of handling window resizing? I was hoping to avoid handling resize events everytime the user resized the window.

@TITLE:Combining JQuery Validation followed by ajax post
@CONTENT:I'm sure this is simple but I'm new to JQuery. I am using the JQuery plugin to validate an email address, this works and the code is: $(document).ready(function () {
    $("#email").click(function () {
        $(this).attr({value: ''});
    });
    $("#subscribe-form").validate();
});
 What I then want to do is to post the email address using an ajax post, again this code works fine without the validator: $(document).ready(function () {
    $('#submit').click(function () {
        var email = $('#email').val();
        var data = "email=" + email;
        $.ajax({
            type: "POST",
            url: "subscript.php",
            data: data,
        });
    });
});
 What I don't seem to be able to do is combine them both, so that if the email is valid it will then post. I'd really appreciate help on how to do this. Thanks very much

    $("#email").click(function () {

 Why is it that you cannot use super to initialise the inherited classes when a qt4 class is involved? I would rather not have todo QtGui.QMainWindow.__init__() 
A.__init__() 
 Anyone know what is going on?

@TITLE:Android: Wrong item checked when filtering listview
@CONTENT:I'm suffering from the same issue as this question: Wrong item checked when filtering ListView in android As suggested in the above question, I have an Hashset holding all the selectedIds, but I can't figure out how to use it when the cursor is repopulating the checked items. My issue is only cosmetic - for example: "Facebook" is located at the 5th position in the unfiltered list. User searched for "face", only "Facebook" appears in the 1st position in the filtered list. User checks "Facebook" as selected and goes back to the unfiltered list. The checked item is the 1st item in the list and not "Facebook" (positioned 5th). Note: Except this issue, everything else works great. For example, "delete" will delete the right items because I use the selectedIds to do it (even if the checked items are wrong). Single click on a list item: OnItemClickListener mOnItemClickListener = new OnItemClickListener() {
            @Override
            public void onItemClick(AdapterView<?> parent, View v, int position, long id) {

                //gets the Bookmark ID of selected position
                    Cursor cursor = (Cursor)parent.getItemAtPosition(position);
                    String bookmarkID = cursor.getString(0);

                    boolean currentlyChecked = checkedStates.get(position);
                    checkedStates.set(position, !currentlyChecked);

                    if (!selectedIds.contains(bookmarkID)) {

                        selectedIds.add(bookmarkID);
                        selectedLines.add(position);

                    } else {

                        selectedIds.remove(bookmarkID);
                        selectedLines.remove(position);


                        }

            }
        };
 Inside the Cursor: - this is where the problem lies. This repopulates the checked items - the problem is it does it by position (pos) and what was the right position of the item in the filtered list, is not its position in the unfiltered list - resulting in a wrongly marked item. CheckedTextView markedItem = (CheckedTextView) row.findViewById(R.id.btitle);
markedItem.setChecked(checkedStates.get(pos));
 Would appreciate any help!

EVP_BytesToKey(EVP_aes_256_cbc(), EVP_sha1(), (const unsigned char *)aes_salt, aes_key, sizeof(aes_key), 5, key, iv);
 then i aes256 my data EVP_EncryptInit_ex(&e_ctx, EVP_aes_256_cbc(), NULL, key, iv);
 then i encrypt the key and iv with RSA RSA_public_encrypt(flen, (unsigned char *)key, encryptedKey, rsa, RSA_PKCS1_PADDING );
RSA_public_encrypt(flen, (unsigned char *)iv, encryptedIV, rsa, RSA_PKCS1_PADDING );
 then i save the 128bit key and iv at the "top" of my file (256Bytes header). decryption: -> read the first 256bytes (split into key and iv) -> decrypt the key and iv with the local RSA Private Key (of course the RSA Private Key IS NOT in the file) -> use the key and iv to decrypt the data Am i kind of safe with that code?
@CODE:RAND_bytes(aes_key)
RAND_bytes(aes_salt)

EVP_BytesToKey(EVP_aes_256_cbc(), EVP_sha1(), (const unsigned char *)aes_salt, aes_key, sizeof(aes_key), 5, key, iv); EVP_EncryptInit_ex(&e_ctx, EVP_aes_256_cbc(), NULL, key, iv); RSA_public_encrypt(flen, (unsigned char *)key, encryptedKey, rsa, RSA_PKCS1_PADDING );
RSA_public_encrypt(flen, (unsigned char *)iv, encryptedIV, rsa, RSA_PKCS1_PADDING );

@LINK:/questions/7864664/passing-an-argument-when-starting-new-qthread-in-pyqt
@TITLE:Passing an argument when starting new QThread() in PyQt
@CONTENT:I have a multi-threaded application written in Python in which one thread "takes care" of the GUI, and the other is the worker thread. However, the worker thread has two main functions (or so to say two main jobs), and I need to tell the run function which job exactly to do. So what I had in mind was to create a run function in the worker thread which will take one parameter (save for "self). The parameter will either be "create" or upload. Without further ado, here's the somewhat-code that I have so far: GUI.py class GUI(QMainWindow):
  def __init__(self, parent=None):
    super, etc
    self.worker = worker.Worker()

  def create(self):         
     self.worker.start()

  def upload(self):
     self.worker.start()
 Worker.py class Worker(QThread):
  def __init__(self, parent=None):
    super, etc

  def run(self):
     self.create_data() # OR   self.upload_data(), depends
 So the question is, how can I tell worker.start() which function I want it to perform? I realize one could directly use worker.run() method, but I was told by the "Rapid GUI development with PyQT" never to call worker.run() directly, and always to use worker.start().
@CODE:class GUI(QMainWindow):
  def __init__(self, parent=None):
    super, etc
    self.worker = worker.Worker()

  def create(self):         
     self.worker.start()

  def upload(self):
     self.worker.start() class Worker(QThread):
  def __init__(self, parent=None):
    super, etc

  def run(self):
     self.create_data() # OR   self.upload_data(), depends

@CONTENT:Edit : I've accepted @bakennedy answer confirming my original thoughts, that is: 'Yes, but not out of the box'. A good combo for this seems Celery + APSCheduler. Original question : What is the best way to schedule a periodic task starting at specific datetime? (I'm not using cron for this considering I've the need to schedule about a hundred remote rsyncs, where I compute the remote vs local offset and would need to rsync each path the second the logs are generated in each host.) By my understanding the celery.task.schedules crontab class only allows specifying hour, minute, day of week. The most useful tip I've found so was this nosklo answer. Is this the best solution? Am I using the wrong tool for the job?

@CONTENT:I'm trying to add an array of controls to an aspx page (C# code behind). These are the similar controls (search criteria for separate fields but will have the same values). The dropdown control values are currently set in the Page_Load method, like this: protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) {
  ListItem[] items = new ListItem[3];
  //these values are actually set by a database query
  items[0] = new ListItem('Apple', 'Apple');
  items[1] = new ListItem('Orange', 'Orange');
  items[2] = new ListItem('Banana', 'Banana');

  FruitDropDown.Items.AddRange(items);
  FruitDropDown.DataBind();
}
 then on the page I have a control like: <asp:DropDownList ID="FruitDropDown" runat="server"/>
 This works fine and populates the control, but I want to now create an array of those dropdowns - there will be 20 of them, so I don't want to create it 20 times in the Page_Load method. Should I add the dropdown population in a list and then do something like: <asp:DropDownList ID="FruitDropDown[0]" runat="server"/>
<asp:DropDownList ID="FruitDropDown[1]" runat="server"/>
 How would I label them on the page and then be able to access those values in the controller? Could I do something like this if I've already added those named controls to the aspx page? protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) {
  ListItem[] items = new ListItem[3];
  //these values are actually set by a database query
  items[0] = new ListItem('Apple', 'Apple');
  items[1] = new ListItem('Orange', 'Orange');
  items[2] = new ListItem('Banana', 'Banana');

  for (int x = 0; x < 20; x++) {
    FruitDropDown[x].Items.AddRange(items);
    FruitDropDown[x].DataBind();
}
 Does this also require copying and pasting the controls on the aspx page 20 times? What if it expands to 100? Can I add those in a loop on the aspx page?
@CODE:protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) {
  ListItem[] items = new ListItem[3];
  //these values are actually set by a database query
  items[0] = new ListItem('Apple', 'Apple');

@TITLE:Is it possible to clone Z3_context?
@CONTENT:I need it for incremental solving in the context of symbolic execution (Klee). In points of branching of symbolic execution paths it is necessary to split solver context into 2 parts: with true and false conditions. Of course, there is an expensive workaround - create empty context and replay all constraints. Is there a way to split Z3_context? Do you plan to add such functionality? Note splitting of context can be avoided if use depth-first symbolic exploration, that is exploring current execution path until it reaches "end" and hence this path won't be explored anymore in future. In this case it is enough to pop until branch point reached and continue to explore another condition branch. But in case of Klee many symbolic paths are explored "simultaneously" (exploration of true and false branches is interleaved), so you need solver context solver switching (there is Z3_context argument in each method) and branching (there are no methods for this, that is what I need). Thanks!

@TITLE:Forwarding child control MouseMove events to the parent seamlessly
@CONTENT:I have a custom UserControl that I am drawing using the GDI+. It is a transparent control which draws small shapes on top of the parent control. All the parent window does is creates the control, gives it a Rectangle in which to draw itself, and then it receives events if the user clicks on the non-transparent areas. The drawing part works perfectly, but right now what I need to do is to as seamlessly as possible forward all MouseMove, MouseClick, etc. events to the parent control IF those events occurred outside the shapes. The shapes are drawn using GraphicsPath, and I am already able to detect if the mouse position is over a shape using GraphicsPath.IsVisible(). I want to do this in a way that requires zero or minimal extra code on the parent. The parent should not necessarily know whether the MouseMove event was forwarded from the child control or not, it should treat them all equally. Do I have to pinvoke/SendMessage() to do this? Or is there an easier way using the .NET framework?

@CONTENT:We have a monitoring service where our monitor units keep an eye on certain machines. I'm creating a form to register a new machine in Symfony2. So we have the machine entity: id machine name monitor id And the monitor entity: id serialnumber ... For a new machine, the customer needs to fill the form with: machine name serialnumber of attached monitor ... Now, if I make a form with, as data backing, a machine entity, I have no 'field' in which to ask for the serial number. Symfony doesn't allow it, since the backing entity doesn't have a field named 'serial number'. How can I: ask for the serial number while there is no such field in the backing entity if I get the serial number, how do I link it up with it's internal id to persist with the entity once the data is validated and bound I figure I can: make a form without an object behind it, as described by @weaverryan in this excellent article: http://knplabs.com/en/blog-csi/symfony-validators-standalone - this way I do the persisting myself, but I need separate constraints for my custom form, and for my machine entity, which is a pity. provide some kind of link so that Symfony knows where to get the fact that a serialnumber field exists, and what it's constraints are. Perhaps by defining a relation? Tbh I was hoping to avoid relations in my entity code, because I've seen quite a few problems arise from it on the mailinglist, but maybe I have no choice :-) anything else? I hope I'm explaining this right. I think many have had to solve this. I think I'm just looking over some very standard Symfony functionality, just because I'm not sure what it's called :-)

@TITLE:Permission migration from publish_stream to publish_action
@CONTENT:I am wondering if you have a users permission to publish_stream and you want to publish_action from now on does publish_stream cover both or do we need to re-request the users permission? If so whats the easiest way of detecting wether they have this permission granted etc. User journey suggestions welcome. The login system I have in place is users can use with facebook or their account credentials. But some users sign up without facebook and then connect later. I don't create the session every time they login as I only need the publish_stream permission which works without needing a live user session with facebook to post when the user does specific actions. There is one column in the table which specifies wether the user is connected or not. Suggestions welcome. Thanks! -Stefan

@CONTENT:I'm trying to develop a web service to be consumed by mobile clients (iOS clients, for now), I read that RESTful services are much more lightweight than SOAP services, so I'd like to try my hand at this. Most methods will require authentication, but I'm not sure how to handle this, as I read REST is supposed to be stateless, so how can I validate the user accessing the service from iOS and then use that authentication to validate successive calls to other web methods? Note: I'll be using WCF 4's WebHttp on IIS. Thank you!

@TITLE:How To Signal End Of Data Without Closing NetworkStream in C#
@CONTENT:I have a client application that serializes a object and sends it to a server application. The server should deserialize the object, make changes to it, then serialize it and send it back. Server Code: TcpClient client = server.AcceptTcpClient();

@TITLE:Multi-value date parameter in stored procedure?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to get a stored procedure to work that accepts a multi-value parameter for dates. This isn't in SSRS but I'm trying to use the same approach as I do with it: ALTER PROCEDURE spSelectPlacementData
(
    @ClientID           SMALLINT,
    @SourceFileDates    VARCHAR(MAX)
)
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT (snip)
    FROM [APS].[dbo].[Account] A
    WHERE ClientID = @ClientID
    AND A.[SourceFileDate] IN (SELECT * FROM dbo.Split(@SourceFileDates))
END
 I use this approach with INT and VARCHAR fields on SSRS report multi-value parameters. Here is the code I'm using to concatenate the SourceFileDates:     string sourceFileDates = "";

    foreach (DateTime file in job.sourceFiles)
    {
        if (file == job.sourceFiles.Last())
        {
            sourceFileDates += "'" + file.ToString("d") + "'";
        }
        else
        {
            sourceFileDates += "'" + file.ToString("d") + "', ";
        }
    }

    selectRunCommand = new SqlCommand("spSelectPlacementData", sqlConnection);
    selectRunCommand.CommandType = CommandType.StoredProcedure;
    selectRunCommand.Parameters.Add("@ClientID", SqlDbType.SmallInt);
    selectRunCommand.Parameters["@ClientID"].Value = job.clientID;
    selectRunCommand.Parameters.Add("@SourceFileDates", SqlDbType.VarChar);
    selectRunCommand.Parameters["@SourceFileDates"].Value = sourceFileDates;
 Using this dbo.Split function I grabbed online: /****** Object:  UserDefinedFunction [dbo].[Split]    Script Date: 09/20/2011 11:16:13 ******/
SET ANSI_NULLS ON
GO

 I guess I'm not entirely clear on what differs between how I'm formatting the parameter, how SSRS does so for similar parameters (this is the only one I've tried doing from code), and how the Date data type affects required formatting. I'm getting a "Conversion failed when converting date and/or time from character string." error when selecting more than one value.

@TITLE:How to enable autocomplete in GoClipse?
@CONTENT:The instructions how to install GoClipse have been followed. I'm not getting any autocomplete stuff happening at all, either for local packages that I write, for built in stuff, or for GAE stuff (I have downloaded Go src to the SDK folder as the wiki states). Are there any settings that I can check to ensure it is set up correctly? Is autocomplete supposed to work in the current version?

@TITLE:Passing parameters with h:commandButton X or the equivalent
@CONTENT:I read on other threads that this does not work: <h:commandButton value="Create New Account" 
                action="#{acctBean.doCreate}" >
   <f:param name="acctName" value="#{acctBean.handle}" />
   <f:param name="acctNo" value="#{acctBean.id}" />
</h:commandButton>
 The doCreate() method will return a navigation to a "congratulations" page if it creates the account. The target page can then resolve #{param.handle} and #{param.id}. I know this will work if I use h:commandLink instead, but I want a button, not a link. Is there any generally accepted way of doing that? UPDATE: Based on the first answer from @BalusC I created the following test code:                 <h:commandButton value="Push Me" action="goAcctCreated" >
                    <f:param name="acctName" value="This Is Account Name" />
                    <f:param name="acctNo" value="1234" />
                </h:commandButton>
                <h:button value="Push Me #2" outcome="newAcct" >
                    <f:param name="acctName" value="This Is Account Name" />
                    <f:param name="acctNo" value="1234" />
                </h:button>
 And in the target page I have:  <p>You may now log in with the account you just created: <b>#{param['acctName']}</b>.</p>
 <p>This is account number <b>#{param['acctNo']}</b>.</p>
 As before, the h:commandButton does not work with a POST transaction and as BalusC said, h:button does a GET and does work. Interestingly enough, on the POST that the h:commandbutton does it has the parameters encoded, as viewed by Firebug: acctName    This Is Account Name
acctNo  1234
javax.faces.ViewState   8642267042811824055:-4937858692781722161
testForm    testForm
testForm:j_idt55    testForm:j_idt55
 So the f:param tags are doing their job at least, but the target page doesn't resolve the EL expressions #{param[xxx]}. They also don't show up in the scoped variables report (ctrl-shift-D). Is there something I am supposed to do on the target page?
@CODE:<h:commandButton value="Create New Account" 
                action="#{acctBean.doCreate}" >

@LINK:/questions/7363152/hibernate-aliastobean-with-collection
@TITLE:Hibernate AliasToBean with Collection
@CONTENT:I have a bi-directional one-to-many relationship defined between Parent and Child classes. I'm looking to execute a query such that I can return a single parent, and a subset of its children in a bean. public class Parent {
    private int id;
    private Set<Child> children = new HashSet<Child>(0);

    // other fields + getters and setters
}

public class Child {
    private Parent parent;
    private int age;

    // other fields + getters and setters
}
 The output I'm looking to achieve is: public class ParentChildWrapper {
    private Parent parent;
    private Collection<Child> children; // subset of children
}
 I'd like to filter on the parent's id and the child's age column. I've tried a number of query combinations in order to get the desired output. The following is close, but doesn't group the children in a collection in the ParentChildWrapper bean I've defined. The result I get is a list of objects, with 1 instance per child that matches the age filter: Query q = session.createQuery(
    "SELECT p, c " +
    "FROM Parent p " +
    "INNER JOIN p.children c " +
    "WHERE p.id = :id " +
    "AND c.age = :age"
);
 I've also tried to group by the parent in order to try and aggregate all the children into a collection, also to no avail. Obviously I could separate this into two separate queries in order to select the parent, and then select the children that I want. But it feels like this should be a fairly common use case. Perhaps I'm not thinking in a hibernate-esque way.
@CODE:public class Parent {
    private int id;
    private Set<Child> children = new HashSet<Child>(0);

public class Child {

    private int age;

    // other fields + getters and setters
} public class ParentChildWrapper {

@TITLE:On reset what happens in embedded system?
@CONTENT:I have a doubt regarding the reset due to power up: 1.As i know that microcontroller is hardwired to start with some particular memory location say 0000H on power up. At 0000h, whether interrupt service routine is written for reset(intialization of stack pointer and program counter etc) or the reset address is there at 0000h(say 7000) so that micro controller jumps at 7000 address and there initialization of stack and PC is written. 2.Who writes this reset service routine? Is it the manufacturer of microcontroller chip(Intel or microchip etc) or any programmer can change this reset service routine(For example, programmer changed the PC to 4000h from 7000h on power up reset resulting into the first instruction to be fetched from 4000 instead of 7000). 3.how the stack pointer and program counter are initialized to the respective inital addresses as on power up microcontroller is not in the state to put the address into stack pointer and program counter registers(there is no intialization done till reset service routine). What should be the steps in the reset service routine considering all possibilities? Thanks in advance

I have installed git successfully on both my remote server and my local machine (OSX). I am using a mac git client called Tower, here is my dilemma... I can successfully create a bare repository on my remote server, no problems there. I then open up Tower and attempt to clone my remote repository to my local machine. I've been able to do that as well, I can successfully clone the remote repo to my local machine. However, whenever I add a new file to my local branch and then commit that change and push to the remote repo, it says it goes through successfully, but when I check my remote repo location, there are no new files there? Tower says that the file exists in the remote repo, I can checkout that repo to a new local branch and it pulls the previous commit history and files like it should, but I can't find where the files are being stored on my remote repo. What am I missing here? Any advice will be greatly appreciated, thanks!

@TITLE:Lock a div on the screen after so much of it has scrolled off?
@CONTENT:I'm currently trying to find a way to lock my header on the screen after most of it has scrolled off the top. So, if for example, my header was 150 pixels high, is there anyway I could lock the bottom 15 pixels at the top of the screen after the top 135 pixels have scrolled off the top as the user scrolls down my page? So that no matter how long my page becomes, there will always be the bottom 15 pixels of my header at the top of it. I also need to reverse this when the user scrolls back up, so that the header can return to it's original state. I've tried a dirty work around whereby having another header 15 pixels high with a "fixed" position layered behind my original header, so that when the full 150 pixel original one goes off the screen my new one appears out from behind it. This does work, but if the user catches it at mid point it looks disgraceful. I have extremely limited knowledge of JavaScript and fear that may be where my answer lies.

If method does deal with state of object they should always be declared as class methods i.e static. But still in most of the projects i ihave seen the methods which never not operates on instance variables they are also declared as instance methods(basically what these methods are doing they are using some of the method parametrs and doing some processing on that paremets and calling some other classes).Thats it.

@CONTENT:The redis documentation for ZADD states the operation is O(log N). However, does anyone know if ZADD is better than O(log N) when the inserted element is at the beginning or end of the sort order? E.g. for certain implementations this could be O(1). Specifically, the redis tutorial states that: Sorted sets are implemented via a dual-ported data structure containing both a skip list and an hash table, so every time we add an element Redis performs an O(log(N)) operation. It seems plausible to modify a skip list to support O(k) insert at beginning and end, where k is the max level of the skip list.

@CONTENT:I want to write output from the TextToSpeech engine to my app's cache directory. In order to for the TTS to write there I first have to give it permissions to do so. But I don't know how. I understand that normally such problems can be solved by handing a FileDescriptor over thus giving permissions to access a specific file. But I can't do that with TTS, as the TextToSpeech.synthesizeToFile method only accepts the file path as a String, no FileDescriptor. So what to do? To make my point that TTS really hasn't permissions to write to my app's directories, here's the code...: TextToSpeech mTts = new new TextToSpeech(context, this);
mTts.synthesizeToFile(text, null, getCacheDir() + "/" + "speech.wav");

 Hi, I have an expiration of reservation code here. My problem is that if a customer makes a reservation on 23:30 and the reservation will expire at 00:30 (1 hour), I made this code: $currentdate = date("F j, Y, G:i");  
$onehour = date("G") + 1;
$expire = date("F j, Y, $onehour:i");
 The $onehour must increment, but the problem is that the 23:30 reservation must expire at 24:30. But after incrementing the $onehour, the 23:30 results into 24:40. Which my program cannot read since military time of 12am is 00:00 and not 24:00. Can anyone have suggestions in my problem? Thanks. Sorry for the lazy english I was tired of thinking

@TITLE:Caliburn Micro WPF Window Management
@CONTENT:I'm wanting to start a WPF application using caliburn.micro so I can use TDD as much as possible, I've used caliburn.micro before with WP7 but WPF seems to be a different ship, and the documentation isn't as complete as that for WP7. I've set up the project with my Bootstrapper public class ApplicationBootstrapper : Bootstrapper
{
    private SimpleContainer _container;
    private WindowManager _windowManager;

    protected override void Configure()
    {
        _container = new SimpleContainer();
        _windowManager = new WindowManager();

        _container.RegisterSingleton(typeof(MainViewModel), "MainViewModel", typeof(MainViewModel));
        _container.RegisterSingleton(typeof(DataViewModel), "DataViewModel", typeof(DataViewModel));

    }

    protected override object GetInstance(Type service, string key)
    {
        return _container.GetInstance(service, key);
    }

    protected override IEnumerable<object> GetAllInstances(Type service)
    {
        return _container.GetAllInstances(service);
    }

    protected override void BuildUp(object instance)
    {
        _container.BuildUp(instance);
    }

    protected override void OnStartup(object sender, System.Windows.StartupEventArgs e)
    {
        _windowManager.ShowWindow(_container.GetInstance(typeof(MainViewModel), "MainViewModel"));
    }
}
 and this loads the MainView fine, which made me think I had won but I was then wanting to move on and have another view/viewmodel setup but for the life of me I cannot get the WindowManager to be passed through to my ViewModel in order to load more views (As I did with the NavigationService in WP7) Here is my MainViewModel code public class MainViewModel : BaseViewModel
{
    private readonly DataViewModel _dataViewModel;
    private readonly IWindowManager _windowManager;


    public MainViewModel(IWindowManager windowManager, DataViewModel dataViewModel)
    {

        _dataViewModel = dataViewModel;
        _windowManager = windowManager;
    }

    public string Title { get { return ApplicationTitle; } }

    public void BtnNew()
    {
        System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(_windowManager == null);

    }

    public void BtnLoad()
    {
        MessageBox.Show("Sorry, not yet implemented");
    }
}
 But the Window Manger and the DataViewModel is always null, when I searched the internet for a solution I found that it was indeed the WindowManager that I wanted to utilize, and something about the MEFBootStrapper? but I would have thought that the framework conventions that I used on WP7 would have transferred a tonne better than it seems to be. The Simple Container is just the recipe provided by caliburn.micro on their site, and the one I used in WP7 applications
@CODE:public class ApplicationBootstrapper : Bootstrapper
{
    private SimpleContainer _container;
    private WindowManager _windowManager;

    protected override void Configure()
    {
        _container = new SimpleContainer();
        _windowManager = new WindowManager();

        _container.RegisterSingleton(typeof(MainViewModel), "MainViewModel", typeof(MainViewModel));
        _container.RegisterSingleton(typeof(DataViewModel), "DataViewModel", typeof(DataViewModel));

    }

    protected override object GetInstance(Type service, string key)
    {
        return _container.GetInstance(service, key);
    }

    protected override IEnumerable<object> GetAllInstances(Type service)
    {
        return _container.GetAllInstances(service);
    }

    protected override void BuildUp(object instance)
    {
        _container.BuildUp(instance);
    }

    protected override void OnStartup(object sender, System.Windows.StartupEventArgs e)
    {
        _windowManager.ShowWindow(_container.GetInstance(typeof(MainViewModel), "MainViewModel"));
    }
} public class MainViewModel : BaseViewModel
{
    private readonly DataViewModel _dataViewModel;
    private readonly IWindowManager _windowManager;


    public MainViewModel(IWindowManager windowManager, DataViewModel dataViewModel)
    {

        _dataViewModel = dataViewModel;
        _windowManager = windowManager;
    }

But I don't get why the wildcard class is throwing this weird error. Is there a way to fix this without using @SupressWarning or using generics? Edit: To Clarify, the following code using generics makes the warning go away. class Foo<T extends Enum<T>>{
    Class<T> enumClass;
    Enum e = Enum.valueOf(enumClass, aString);
}
 The usage of <T> is what I mean by using generics. I can't do that because it would be a huge cascading change.

@TITLE:MongoDB php $in and $regex
@CONTENT:i'm trying to combine $regex and $in to do simple search. For example I have a user query of this kind : $user_query = "for focus red";
 In my mongodb collection for each document I have a keywords field. I want to get to get the document where the field keywords is : {
    keywords :
        [0] => ford,
        [1] => focus,
        [2] => red
}
 As you can see the user has done a mistake and typed "for" instead of "ford". I can get the results with $in if the user types Ford, but I don't know how to combine $regex and $in, I have looked the mongodb doc and php mongo doc.
@CODE:$user_query = "for focus red"; {
    keywords :
        [0] => ford,
        [1] => focus,
        [2] => red
} $in $regex $in $regex $in $in $regex

@CONTENT:In Asp.Net for creating a huge pdf report iam using "ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem", My requirement is report has to be created asynchronously , and i do not want to wait for the Response. I plan to achieve it through below code protected void Button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)

}

public void CreateReport()
{
    //This method will take 30 seconds to finish it work

 My question is ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem will create a new thread from Asp.Net worker process or some system thread. Is this a good approach ?, I may have 100 of concurrent users accessing the web page.

@TITLE:How to use a common target object to handle actions/outlets of multiple views?
@CONTENT:I'm beginning to try and use IB where previously I used code. I have created nibs for iPad/iPhone Portrait/Landscape so I have four possible views. All have files owner set to UIViewController, all have an object added from the palette set to my NSObject subclass "TargetObject". No problem setting IBActions/IBOutlets, just ctrl-drag as usual to create the code in one nib, then go and right-click the object and drag the actions/outlets to the right controls in the other nibs so that the connection exists in all nibs. The idea is that the app delegate kicks off the appropriate view controller for the current device and then that view controller loads the right view depending on orientation. (Maybe with autoresizing mastery this approach is not necessary - I want to know if it is possible to do it this way because getting the layouts to rearrange themselves just right just with those IB controls is very, very frustrating.) The idea behind these one-to-many views and target objects is that I can use them anywhere in the app. For example, where I have something displayed which is an object in core data and I would like to allow detail view/edit in multiple places in the app. It seems like a very MVC way to do things. The problem comes in loadView of the view controller when I do: NSArray *portraitViewArray = [[NSBundle mainBundle] loadNibNamed:@"Weekview_iPad_Portrait" owner:self options:nil];
portraitWeekView = [portraitViewArray objectAtIndex:0];

NSArray *landscapeViewArray = [[NSBundle mainBundle] loadNibNamed:@"Weekview_iPad_Landscape" owner:self options:nil];
landscapeWeekView = [landscapeViewArray objectAtIndex:0];

// this object is intended to be a common target for portrait and landscape arrays. 
weekViewTarget = [portraitViewArray objectAtIndex:1];

UIInterfaceOrientation interfaceOrientation = self.interfaceOrientation;

if(interfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait || interfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientationPortraitUpsideDown)
    self.view = portraitWeekView;
else 
    self.view = landscapeWeekView;
 As you guessed, everything is fine in portrait orientation but in landscape any interaction with the target object crashes. The weekViewTarget object refers to an object created with the portrait view, so the landscape view is looking for a different instance that hasn't been held with a reference. In the landscape view _viewDelegate is nil - it is private so I can't fix it up in code. I can hold onto the landscape target object with a reference too, but then there will be problems whenever the orientation changes - in case of any stateful controls like UITableView the datasource/delegate will change resulting in strange user experience on rotation. Unless I ensure the target object implements only simple actions and uses a separate, shared object to implement datasource/delegate objects for any table views or text views required. One thing I have thought of is to make the target a singleton. Seems like a hack and here will be times that can't work. What's the right way to create multiple views implemented as nibs using a common target object to do stuff to the model? progress - things begin to work if I give each target a pointer to its own type: WeekViewTarget *forwardTarget;
 and let the real handler's forwardTarget = nil while the unused handler's forwardTarget is set as follows: weekViewTarget = [portraitViewArray objectAtIndex:1];
forwardedWeekViewTarget = [landscapeViewArray objectAtIndex:1];
forwardedWeekViewTarget.forwardTarget = weekViewTarget;
 and then do the following in each IBAction: - (IBAction)timeBlockTapped:(id)sender {

    if(forwardTarget != nil) {
        [forwardTarget performSelector:@selector(timeBlockTapped:) withObject:sender];
    } else {
        NSLog(@"Got a tap event with sender %@", [sender description]);
    }
}
 Still doesn't feel right though.
@CODE:NSArray *portraitViewArray = [[NSBundle mainBundle] loadNibNamed:@"Weekview_iPad_Portrait" owner:self options:nil];
portraitWeekView = [portraitViewArray objectAtIndex:0];

NSArray *landscapeViewArray = [[NSBundle mainBundle] loadNibNamed:@"Weekview_iPad_Landscape" owner:self options:nil];
landscapeWeekView = [landscapeViewArray objectAtIndex:0];

// this object is intended to be a common target for portrait and landscape arrays. 
weekViewTarget = [portraitViewArray objectAtIndex:1];

UIInterfaceOrientation interfaceOrientation = self.interfaceOrientation;

if(interfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait || interfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientationPortraitUpsideDown)
    self.view = portraitWeekView;
else 
    self.view = landscapeWeekView; WeekViewTarget *forwardTarget; forwardTarget = nil weekViewTarget = [portraitViewArray objectAtIndex:1];
forwardedWeekViewTarget = [landscapeViewArray objectAtIndex:1];
forwardedWeekViewTarget.forwardTarget = weekViewTarget; - (IBAction)timeBlockTapped:(id)sender {

    if(forwardTarget != nil) {
        [forwardTarget performSelector:@selector(timeBlockTapped:) withObject:sender];

@LINK:/questions/6918001/populating-an-object-based-on-a-one-to-many-table-relationship-in-sql
@TITLE:Populating an object based on a one-to-many table relationship in SQL
@CONTENT:I have an object in C# like this: private ClassWidget
{
    public int ID;
    public List<int> WidgetFavoriteNumbers;
}
 Let's say I have two tables in SQL, one defines widget properties, and the other holds many records for a single widget, let's say the widget's favorite numbers: widgets
-----------
id (int, not null)
// other properties ...

widget_nums
----------
widget_id (int, not null)
num (int)
 I find myself frequently executing two SQL queries to populate this object even though I know I can join the tables to create just one query. The reason is that it seems simpler to populate the object with just the data I need rather than iterating over result sets that have a lot of duplicate data. Of course this widget example is much simplified compared to the real scenario. Here's the example: int WidgetID = 8;
ClassWidget MyWidget = new ClassWidget();
using (SqlConnection conn = GetSQLConnection())
{
    using (SqlCommand cmd = conn.CreateCommand())
    {
        conn.Open();
        cmd.CommandText = @"SELECT id FROM widgets WHERE id = @WidgetID;";
        cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("WidgetID", WidgetID);
        using (SqlDataReader Reader = cmd.ExecuteReader())
        {
            if (Reader.HasRows)
                MyWidget.ID = GetDBInt("id", Reader); // custom method to read database result
        }
        cmd.CommandText = @"SELECT num FROM widget_nums WHERE widget_id = @WidgetID;";
        using (SqlDataReader Reader = cmd.ExecuteReader())
        {
            if (Reader.HasRows)
                while (Reader.Read())
                    MyWidget.WidgetFavoriteNumbers.Add(GetDBInt("num", Reader));
        }
        conn.Close();
    }
}
 My question is whether I should continue using this type of approach, or if performing a table join would be recommended. If the table join is recommended, what is the best design pattern to populate the object? My problem is that I have to create some logic to filter out duplicate rows, and is especially complicated when I am getting all widgets rather than just one.
@CODE:private ClassWidget
{
    public int ID;
    public List<int> WidgetFavoriteNumbers;
} widgets
-----------
id (int, not null)
// other properties ...

widget_nums
----------
widget_id (int, not null)
num (int) int WidgetID = 8;
ClassWidget MyWidget = new ClassWidget();
using (SqlConnection conn = GetSQLConnection())
{
    using (SqlCommand cmd = conn.CreateCommand())
    {
        conn.Open();
        cmd.CommandText = @"SELECT id FROM widgets WHERE id = @WidgetID;";
        cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("WidgetID", WidgetID);
        using (SqlDataReader Reader = cmd.ExecuteReader())
        {
            if (Reader.HasRows)
                MyWidget.ID = GetDBInt("id", Reader); // custom method to read database result
        }
        cmd.CommandText = @"SELECT num FROM widget_nums WHERE widget_id = @WidgetID;";
        using (SqlDataReader Reader = cmd.ExecuteReader())
        {
            if (Reader.HasRows)
                while (Reader.Read())
                    MyWidget.WidgetFavoriteNumbers.Add(GetDBInt("num", Reader));
        }
        conn.Close();
    }

@TITLE:Injection of EJB3 into Annotation Based JSF2 Backing bean causing javax.naming.NameNotFoundException:
@CONTENT:I have seen other thread with similar issue but was not able to work out direct link with my problem . Hopefully I am not repeating a question.My issue is this: I am using Webpsphere 7 with JSF2 as Shared Isolated Library . When I try to inject an EJB3 into in an annotated JSF2 backing bean I get this error Caused by: javax.naming.NameNotFoundException: Name comp/env/helloworld.HelloBean not found in context "java:".
 but It works fine if we configure JSF2 using face.xml and not use annotation. However without EJB3 injection we can use the application with JSF2 annotations and not see any issue only when we try to inject ejb3 we get issues. Code from a simple trial app is below Service interface: package au.com.test;

import javax.ejb.Local;

@Local
public interface SampleService {
    public String getServiceName();
}
 Service Implementation: package au.com.test;

import javax.ejb.Stateless;
import javax.ejb.TransactionAttribute;
import javax.ejb.TransactionAttributeType;


@Stateless
@TransactionAttribute (TransactionAttributeType.NOT_SUPPORTED)
public class SampleSession implements SampleService {

    @Override
    public String getServiceName() {

    }

}

@LINK:/questions/6866415/intentservice-how-to-enqueue-correctly
@TITLE:IntentService : How to enqueue correctly?
@CONTENT:In my code i'm using an IntentService to listen to location updates (either GPS or network updates) and this IntentService is triggered when an event is received, so it is started with startService() from any activity. public class AddLocationService extends IntentService implements LocationListener {
    /*My code here*/
}

    @Override
protected void onHandleIntent(Intent intent) {
    if(getOldLoc() == null) 
    { 
        //Get a new location
        this.locationManager.requestLocationUpdates(LocationManager.NETWORK_PROVIDER, TIME_INTERVAL_GPS, 0, this);
        this.locationManager.requestLocationUpdates(LocationManager.GPS_PROVIDER, TIME_INTERVAL_GPS, 0, this);
        Log.d(AddLocationService.TAG, "Network listener started");

        this.time_start_listening = System.currentTimeMillis();
        mTimerThread mTimerRunnable = new mTimerThread();
        this.timerThread = new Thread(mTimerRunnable);
        this.timerThread.start();
    }
    else    
        /*REUSE OLD LOCATION*/
}
 Now my problem is : When two events start this IntentService and the second starts it while the first one is still requesting for updates, I will like the second one to wait until first one is fully finished (location found OR timer thread finishes). However whenever the IntentService is executed a second time (first instance still running), it prints me the log and does as it was executing in parallel. However I thought that the main goal of IntentService was that it is something sequential so a second intent would have to wait until first one is done... Did I missunderstood something ?
@CODE:IntentService IntentService startService() public class AddLocationService extends IntentService implements LocationListener {
    /*My code here*/
}

    @Override
protected void onHandleIntent(Intent intent) {
    if(getOldLoc() == null) 
    {

        this.locationManager.requestLocationUpdates(LocationManager.GPS_PROVIDER, TIME_INTERVAL_GPS, 0, this);
        Log.d(AddLocationService.TAG, "Network listener started");

        this.time_start_listening = System.currentTimeMillis();

@TITLE:Check if URL-file exist or not
@CONTENT:I wonder how I can check if a file exist on a server or not, without downloading the data first. I have around 30 different objects and some of them is connected to a movie on a server. At the moment I use NSData to control if the the URL exist, and then shows the movie, or if it doesn't and then alerts the user that there is no video for that object. The code I use for the moment: NSString *fPath = [[NSString alloc] initWithFormat:@"http://www.myserver/%@", [rows idNr]];
NSURL *videoURL = [NSURL URLWithString:fPath];
NSData *videoData = [NSData dataWithContentsOfURL:videoURL];

url = [NSURL URLWithString:fPath];
[fPath release];

if (videoData) {
    [self performSelectorOnMainThread:@selector(playVideo:) withObject:url waitUntilDone:NO];
} else {
    NSLog(@"videodata false");
    errorLabel.hidden = NO;
    activityView.hidden = YES;
}
 "rows idNr" is the name of the object. This method is doing what I want, but the problem is that with NSData it first "downloading" the file, and when the URL is validated as a file, the movie is loading once again in the movieplayer. This means that it takes twice as long to load the file. Suggestions?
@CODE:NSString *fPath = [[NSString alloc] initWithFormat:@"http://www.myserver/%@", [rows idNr]];
NSURL *videoURL = [NSURL URLWithString:fPath];

So, the in#s and out's have slipped from my memory. I am working with boost::asio and boost::thread at the moment. In order to emulate synchronous RPC against an asynchronous function executor (boost::io_service with multiple threads io::service::run'ing where requests are io_serviced::post'ed), I am using boost synchronization primitives.

 Forty bytes for a mutex ?? ?? ? WTF ! 88 for a condition_variable !!! Please keep in mind that I'm repulsed by this bloated size because I am thinking of an application that could create hundreds of notification_object's This level of overhead for portability seems ridiculous, can someone justify this? As far as I can remember these primitives should be 4 or 8 bytes wide depending on the memory model of the CPU.

@CONTENT:This is a stupid question, it feels like one. But mental block is bad right now. :( My problem is I have an array consisting only of numbers. I want to use that array as a lookup, but the number I pass to lookup a number in the array keeps looking to the array in the index of that number, not whether that number exists in the array. For example: var a = [2,4,6,8,10],
b = 2;

if(a[b]){ /* if the number 2 exists in the array a, then do something * }
 But that looks at the array value in position 2 (6), not whether the value 2 is in the array. And this makes perfect sense, but (mental block) I can't figure out a way to test whether a number exists in an array of numbers... I even made everything strings, but it does type coercion and the problem persists. Pulling my hair out here. Please help, thanks. :D

@TITLE:ReactiveUI: Using CanExecute with a ReactiveCommand
@CONTENT:I'm starting to work with the ReactiveUI framework on a Silverlight project and need some help working with ReactiveCommands. In my view model, I have something that looks roughly like this (this is just a simplified example): public class MyViewModel : ReactiveObject
{
  private int MaxRecords = 5;

  public ReactiveCommand AddNewRecord { get; protected set; }

  private ObservableCollection<string> _myCollection = new ObservableCollection<string>();
  public ObservableCollection<string> MyCollection
  {
    get
    {
      return _myCollection;
    }

    set
    {
      _myCollection = value;
      raiseCollectionChanged("MyCollection");
    }
  }

  MyViewModel()
  {
    var canAddRecords = Observable.Return<bool>(MyCollection.Count < MaxRecords);
    AddNewRecord = new ReactiveCommand(canAddRecords);

    AddNewRecord.Subscribe(x => 
    {
       MyCollection.Add("foo");
    }
  }
}
 The canAddRecords function is getting evaluated the first time the ReactiveCommand is created, but it's not getting re-evaluated when items are added to MyCollection. Can anyone show me a good example of how to bind the canExecute property of a ReactiveCommand so that it gets automatically re-evaluated in this situation?
@CODE:public class MyViewModel : ReactiveObject
{
  private int MaxRecords = 5;

  public ReactiveCommand AddNewRecord { get; protected set; }

  private ObservableCollection<string> _myCollection = new ObservableCollection<string>();
  public ObservableCollection<string> MyCollection
  {
    get
    {
      return _myCollection;
    }

    set
    {
      _myCollection = value;
      raiseCollectionChanged("MyCollection");
    }
  }

  MyViewModel()
  {
    var canAddRecords = Observable.Return<bool>(MyCollection.Count < MaxRecords);
    AddNewRecord = new ReactiveCommand(canAddRecords);

@CONTENT:So anyways, I'm working on a small PHP website/script, and as one of the features I'd like to be able to run a WHOIS lookup on the current domain the PHP script is running on. Ideally, it would be one function that I could call and in the function it would run the WHOIS, and then echo the results to the screen. It would take in the URL of the site to run the WHOIS lookup on, or it would just run it on the current URL/Domain (which is what I want), although I can feed it a variable for the website domain if need be. I don't know much about WHOIS lookups (well, I know what they do, I just don't know how to run them in PHP), but I'd also be fine with having to query another website (even one of my own if you can give me the code for it). Whatever works, please just let me know! The main thing is that, I'd prefer it to fit all in one function, and it definitely must fit in one PHP file/document.

@TITLE:ContextualDeserializer for mapping JSON to different types of maps with Jackson
@CONTENT:This JSON snippet should be mapped to a Java-Objects that contains a cars field of type Map<String, Car> and a bikes field of type Map<String, Bike>. Because bikes and cars can be empty strings in the JSON file, i need a custom deserializer (See this question). {
    "id" : "1234",
    "name" : "John Doe",
    "cars" : {
        "Tesla Model S" : {
            "color" : "silver",
            "buying_date" : "2012-06-01"

    },
    "bikes" : {
        "Bike 1" : {
            "color" : "black"
        },
        "Bike 2" : {
            "color" : "red"
        }
    }
}
 I thought about having instances of a generic custom deserializer that can be returned by the createContextual(DeserializationConfig cfg, BeanProperty property) method of a ContextualDeserializer based on the BeanProperty parameter. The generic custom deserializer looks like this: public class MapsGenericDeserializer<T> extends
        JsonDeserializer<Map<String, T>> {

    private ObjectMapper mapper; // ObjectMapper without special map deserializer

    public MapsGenericDeserializer(ObjectMapper mapper) {
        this.mapper = mapper;
    }

    @Override
    public Map<String, T> deserialize(JsonParser jp, DeserializationContext ctxt)
            throws IOException, JsonProcessingException {
        ObjectCodec codec = jp.getCodec();
        JsonNode node = codec.readTree(jp);
        if (!"".equals(node.getTextValue())) {
            return mapper.readValue(node, 
                    new TypeReference<Map<String, T>>() {});
        }
        return null; // Node was an empty string
    }
}
 The contextual serializer below does not work because casting from MapsGenericDeserializer<Car> to JsonDeserializer<Map<String,?>> is not possible. Maybe this is possible in newer Versions of Java, but it does not work on the Version of Android I am coding for. So how can I implement the desired behaviour? public class MapsDeserializer extends JsonDeserializer<Map<String, ?>>
        implements ContextualDeserializer<Map<String, ?>> {

    private ObjectMapper mapper;

    MapsGenericDeserializer<Car> carDeserializer = new MapsGenericDeserializer<Car>(mapper);

    public MapsDeserializer(ObjectMapper mapper) {
        this.mapper = mapper;
    }

            BeanProperty property) throws JsonMappingException {

            android:topRightRadius="10dp"
            />
</shape>
 This give me rounded corners. The problem is that each items are RelativeLayout with TextView on the left side and ImageButton on the right side. Both views have custom graphic on pressed, foucused and default state. Something like this. +------------------------------------+
|      TextView        | ImageButton |
+------------------------------------+
 The problem is that custom graphic cover ListView background and thus rounded corners on first and last item. Everything is okay when scrolling. I've written custom adapter and in getView method I set proper bg for items. @Override
public View getView(int position, View view, ViewGroup parent) {        
    ...
    if(position == 0) {
        mItemView.setBackgroundResource(R.drawable.cell_item_first_selector);
        mImgBtn.setBackgroundResource(R.drawable.cell_btn_first_selector);
    }
    else if (position == mData.size() -1) {
        mItemView.setBackgroundResource(R.drawable.cell_item_last_selector);
        mImgBtn.setBackgroundResource(R.drawable.cell_btn_last_selector);
    } 
    else {
        mItemView.setBackgroundResource(R.drawable.cell_item_def_selector);
        mImgBtn.setBackgroundResource(R.drawable.cell_btn_def_selector);
    }
    ... 
}
 It works, but I'm not sure that is good solution. Is there any other way to automatically round corners in Android Views, not just by setting background?

Is there a straightforward/non-convoluted way to take a raw email string and send/forward/relay it to a specific email address? I hesitate to use PHP's mail() or Pear::Mail because, as far as I can tell, I can't just pass along the raw email. I'd have to parse the headers and run the risk of stripping or altering the original email's contents.

@TITLE:Multi threading which would be the best to use? (Threadpool or threads)
@CONTENT:Hopefully this is a better question than my previous. I have a .exe which I will be passing different parameters (file paths) to which it will then take in and parse. So I will have a loop going, looping through the file paths in a list and passing them to this .exe file. For this to be more efficient, I want to spread the execution across multiple cores which I think you do through threading. My question is, should I use the threadpool, or multiple threads to run this .exe asynchronously? Also, depending on which one of those you guys think is the best, if you can point me to a tutorial that will have some info on what I want to do. Thank you! EDIT: I need to limit the number of executions of the .exe to ONE execution PER CORE. This is the most efficient because if I am parsing 100,000 files I can't just fire up 100000 processes. So I am using threads to limit the number of executions at one time to one execution per core. If there is another way (other than threads) to find out if a processor isn't tied up in execution, or if the .exe has finished please explain. But if there isn't another way, my FINAL question is how would I use a thread to call a parse method and then call back when that thread is no longer in use? SECOND UPDATE (VERY IMPORTANT): I went through what everyone told me, and found out a key element that I left out that I thought didn't matter. So I am using a GUI and I don't want it to be locked up. THAT is why I wanted to use threads. My main question now is, how do I send back information from a thread so I know when the execution is over?

Now I want to zoom in / out and image while maintaining center of ImageView at the same point of Bitmap that was before scale. If I try to zoom in an image with matrix.postScale(zoom, zoom), point that I want to maintain (blue dot) shifts to other place (purple dot). I have tried several different ways to shift Bitmap back, but I cant get it to work correctly. I know initial Bitmap size, ImageView size, distances marked by doted line. Tried to calculate needed shift and use matrix.postTranslate(-zoomshiftX, -zoomshiftY) afterwards, but it doesn't shift correctly. Even found out, that underlying Bitmap's pixel count doesnt change after matrix.postScale() function and tried matrix.postTranslate(-zoomshiftX/zoom, -zoomshiftY/zoom) - but still no luck. How do I achieve such zoom?

        [self.markers setObject:temp forKey:location.eid];
        return annotationView;
    }

    return nil;    
}

    [station setSubtitle:free];

    NSString *status;

        status = @"empty";
    } else if( (free.intValue>0) && (parkings.intValue<=3)  ){

    } else {
        status = @"available";
    }
    UIImage * image = [UIImage imageNamed:[NSString imageWithFormat:@"%@.png", status]];
    pin.image = image;
}
 This brings up no errors (assuming I pasted and traduced everything correctly), but the NSMutableDictionary that should contain both my custom MKAnnotationView and the MKAnnotation, but even when I log them all before the request completes and it appears correctly, when the request completes its as if both the MKAnnotationView and MKAnnotation are just not what I expected, and thus, I can't modify the annotations to change the image or update the annotation view. Any ideas would be appreciated!

@CONTENT:I have a simple ComboBox with CheckBoxes as Items. How can I prevent the actual selection of the items. The user should only be able to check or uncheck the checkboxes? Currently if I click on an element (not on the content or the check itself) it becomes selected. The problem with this is: The TextProperty of the ComboBox is bound to a value which displays the names of the checked items. But if one ComboBoxItem becomes selected the displayed text becomes the value of the ViewModel of the selected item. Thanks in advance for any suggestion.

@TITLE:JTable: changing cell background when a button is clicked
@CONTENT:I know changing cell backgrounds in jtable is done by creating a new cellrenderer class. I've done that. I've read about DefaultTableRenderer "color memory" issue, but I can't figure out how to work around it for my particular purpose. My goal is simple enough: When a button is clicked, change the background color of all selected cells in the jtable. I have the adequate method calls set up for the event, but I can't get the renderer to work the way I want it to. I have all selected cells stored in an arraylist of TableCells (a class containing row, column, and the cell's text string data). Here is my code for getTableCellRendererComponent inside of my CustomCellRenderer. public Component getTableCellRendererComponent(JTable table, Object value, boolean isSelected, boolean hasFocus, int row, int column)
  {
     for(TableCell c: selectedCells)
     {
         if(c.row ==row && c.col == column)
         {
             this.setBackground(Color.black);

         {
             this.setBackground(Color.BLUE);
         }
     }
     return this;
  }
 This code sets the background of all table cells' backgrounds to blue. Obviously I need some different logic to work around this color memory issue. Any ideas on this would be great. Thanks.

It works intermittently, on some executions it will do the right thing and advance one frame, but most times I will have to press the button 3 or 4 times before it will advance a frame. This makes me think it is some kind of precision issue, but I can't figure out what it is. Each time it is run the new CMTime appears to be advancing by the same amount. My other theory is that it could be caused by the currentTime not being set to an exact frame boundary at my frame rate (caused by seeking through the video).

@TITLE:ORDER BY and WITH(ROWLOCK, UPDLOCK, READPAST)
@CONTENT:I need to set up a queue system using some SQL tables, like the one described here. That being, and since I need to filter queued items by different critera, inside a stored procedure I am using BEGIN TRANSACTION

CREATE TABLE #Temp (ID INT, SOMEFIELD INT)

INSERT INTO #Temp SELECT TOP (@Something) TableA.ID, TableB.SomeField FROM TableA WITH (ROWLOCK, READPAST) INNER JOIN TableB WITH (UPDLOCK, READPAST) WHERE Condition1

INSERT INTO #Temp SELECT TOP (@Something) TableA.ID, TableB.SomeField FROM TableA WITH (ROWLOCK, READPAST) INNER JOIN TableB WITH (UPDLOCK, READPAST) WHERE Condition2

(...)

UPDATE TableB SET SomeField = 1 FROM TableB WITH (ROWLOCK, READPAST) WHERE ID IN (SELECT ID FROM #Temp)

COMMIT TRANSACTION
 I am using ROWLOCK in the first table and UPDLOCK in the second because, after this select, I am going to update TableB only, though I need to make sure that these lines don't get updated inTableA by any other concurrent query. Everything goes well until the point where I need to insert an ORDER BY clause in any of the SELECTs above, so that only very specific IDs get selected (I must really do this). What happens is: 1) Without ORDER BY, two concurrent executions execute as desired, returning different and non-overlapping results; however, they don't return the results I want because those precise results were outside the scope of every SELECT statement. 2) Using ORDER BY and two concurrent executions, only the first one returns results. The second one does not return anything. I recall seeing on a blog that for these kind of queries with WITH (ROWLOCK, READPAST) and ORDER BY to work one needs to create indexes on the fields one is using in the ordering. I tried it, but I got the same results. How can I get past this problem? Edit: For example, if I have a table TestTable with fields (TestID INT, Value INT) and values "(1,1), (2,2), ..." and execute "simultaneously" BEGIN TRANSACTION

SELECT TOP 2 TestID FROM TestTable WITH (UPDLOCK, READPAST)

WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:05'

COMMIT TRANSACTION
 the first execution returns lines (1,2) and the second one returns (3,4) as espected. However, if I execute BEGIN TRANSACTION

SELECT TOP 2 TestID FROM TestTable WITH (UPDLOCK, READPAST) ORDER BY VALUE ASC

WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:05'

COMMIT TRANSACTION
 the first one returns (1, 2) and the second returns nothing. Why is this?!

@TITLE:Best way to get request object from within Symfony forms?
@CONTENT:I use Symfony and Doctrine to generate forms for my CMSes. Lately I've been customizing them by setting default values based on specific URL parameters. For example, I have two models: PollQuestion and PollChoice. PollChoice has a relation to PollQuestion by means of a poll_question_id field. The PollChoice form has a dropdown that lists all the available PollQuestions that the PollChoice can be attached to. I also have two routes: pollchoices/new and poll/:poll_id/choice/new. Both routes display the PollChoiceForm, but by using the 2nd route you would automatically see the PollQuestion dropdown set to the :poll_id URL parameter. I do this by simply changing the default value of the dropdown widget in the PollChoiceForm class by fetching the value of :poll_id from the request object. My question is two-fold: 1) I currently fetch the request object by using sfContext::getInstance()->getRequest(). I know that sfContext::getInstance() is frowned upon, but I haven't been able to find another way to fetch it. Is there another way? Dependency injection seems like a good way to go, but I don't know how to accomplish that without doing a lot of hacking (which I'd like to avoid). 2) Am I completely going about the wrong way of changing a form's default values based on URL parameters?

 This machine has two CPUs, each with 4 cores with hyperthreading capability, so the total processor number is 16(2 CPU * 4 core * 2 hyperthreading). These processors have same output, to keep clean, I just show the last one's info and omit part of flags in the flags line. So how do I calculate the peak performance of this machine in terms of GFlops? Let me know if more info should be supplied. Thanks.

@TITLE:nested_form, collection_select, accepts_nested_attributes_for and fields_for, and adding records to a join table
@CONTENT:Update: according to the stack trace, posted at the end of this question, I think the real problem is to figure out what attr_accessible and build association settings I need to get the contributors and linkers attributes to update with the new isbn id. Please help me! Following on from this question... I've got a join table between two models - isbns and contributors - which have a many to many relationship. I want to use the existing values from the contributor model in a collection_select drop-down, within a nested form using fields_for. So when I'm creating a new isbn, I don't want to create new contributor records - I want to be able to select existing ones. And I want to be able to select many contributors, which is why I'm using the nested_form gem which allows me to dynamically create additional form fields for contributors. My question: should I be calling the method on the join table? And if so, why do I get a 'missing block' error despite having pretty much everything attr_accessible and accepts_nested_attributes_for: isbn.rb:   attr_accessible :linkers_attributes, :contributors_attributes, :contributor_id,
  has_many   :linkers
  has_many   :contributors, :through => :linkers
  accepts_nested_attributes_for :contributors
  accepts_nested_attributes_for :linkers
 contributor.rb: attr_accessible :linkers_attributes, :isbns_attributes 
  has_many :linkers
  has_many :isbns, :through => :linkers
  accepts_nested_attributes_for :isbns
  accepts_nested_attributes_for :linkers
 linker.rb: belongs_to :isbn
  belongs_to :contributor
  accepts_nested_attributes_for :contributor
  accepts_nested_attributes_for :isbn
  attr_accessible :isbn_id, :contributor_id, :isbns_attributes, :contributors_attributes, :contributor_attributes, :isbn_attributes
 isbns controller: def new
    @isbn  = Isbn.new
    @title = "Create new ISBN"
    1.times {@isbn.linkers.build}
  end
 new.html.erb: <td class="main">
<%= nested_form_for @isbn, :validate => false do |f| %>
<h1>Create new ISBN</h1>
<%= render 'shared/error_messages', :object => f.object %>
<%= render 'fields', :f => f %>
  <div class="actions">
    <%= f.submit "Create" %>
  </div>  
 <% end %> _fields: (option 1) <%= f.fields_for :contributors do |contributor_form| %>
<li>
<%= contributor_form.label 'Contributor Name' %>
<%= contributor_form.collection_select(:isbn_id, Contributor.all, :id, :personnameinverted ) %>
</li>
<%= contributor_form.link_to_remove "[-] Remove this contributor"%>
<% end %>
<%= f.link_to_add "[+] Add a contributor", :contributors  %>
 This creates a new ISBN, and a new record in linkers with the correct isbn_id, but also a new record in contributors, when I actually want the new linker record to contain an existing contributor_id. So I figured I'd do this: _fields (option 2) <%= field_set_tag 'Contributor' do %>
<li>
<%= f.label 'Contributor Sequence Number' %>
<%= f.text_field :descriptivedetail_contributor_sequencenumber%>
<%= tooltip(:xxx, :hover) %>
</li>

<%= f.fields_for :linkers do |contributor_form| %>
<li>
<%= contributor_form.label 'Contributor Name' %>
<%= contributor_form.collection_select(:isbn_id,  Contributor.all, :id, :personnameinverted ) %>
</li>
<%= contributor_form.link_to_remove "[-] Remove this contributor"%>
<% end %>
<%= f.link_to_add "[+] Add a contributor", :contributors  %>
 But this returns a missing block error. Huge thanks in advance, I've spent two solid days on this and think I might pop. update: Here's a clue, the stack trace from this new code, because I figured you can't actually call a method on a join table: <%= f.fields_for :contributors do |contributor_form| %>
<li>
<%= contributor_form.collection_select(:id, Contributor.all, :id, :personnameinverted, :include_blank => true ) %>

@TITLE:How to tag user/page in Facebook POST.to property using Graph API? No PHP or Javascript involved, only plain HTTP POST Request
@CONTENT:I am aware that using PHP or javascript API, it can be much easier. However, in this case, we are using restFB API at the back end to send HTTP POST request to graph API. The requirement is to be able to tag/mention facebook fan pages or facebook users when publishing a post to fan page wall. According to Facebook Graph API -> Post http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/post/ Field: to Description: Profiles mentioned or targeted in this post Returns: Contains in data an array of objects, each with the name and Facebook id of the user Supposedly, by specifying to = "{name=,id=}" should enable tagging. But it does not seem to work. curl -F 'access_token=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN' -F 'to=FRIEND_FB_ID' https://graph.facebook.com/PAGE_ID/feed (or /photos, as you can tag either photo or mention people in your facebook post) Can someone please give an example as the one above that works? Thanks a lot

@TITLE:Testing API which returns multiple values with JUnit
@CONTENT:I would like to test an API, which received one argument and returns a set. The test invokes the API with an argument and checks if the returned set contains expected values. Suppose, I have to test the API with arguments arg1, arg2, and arg3 and check if values a, b, c appear in the returned set. That is, my test case looks as follows: invoke the API with arg1 and check if a, b, c appear in the returned set. invoke the API with arg2 and check if a, b, c appear in the returned set. invoke the API with arg3 and check if a, b, c appear in the returned set. How to develop this test case with Junit 4 ? What if I have to add arg4 ? What if I have to check if value d appear in the returned set ? Can I read the list of arguments and expected values from the configuration?

@LINK:/questions/6218769/providing-configuration-for-existing-plugins-in-maven-lifecycle-mapping
@TITLE:Providing configuration for existing plugins in maven lifecycle mapping
@CONTENT:I would like to provide a maven plugin with a custom <packaging> that provides a complex lifecycle. As part of this lifecycle, I need to run the maven-compiler-plugin 2 times in different phases with different configurations. I would like to make this packaging as simple as possible to use. The goal would be that all a consumer of this plugin would have to do is select the new packaging and not have to do any plugin execution configuration: <project>
  <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
  <groupId>some.other.group</groupId>
  <artifactId>something-useful</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0</version>
  <packaging>my-maven-plugin-jar</packaging>
  ...
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>my.group.id</groupId>
        <artifactId>my-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>0.0.1</version>
        <extensions>true</extensions
      </plugin>
    </plugin>
  </build>
</project>
 Then my custom lifecycle would bind the all the goals I needed including the compiler both times. The problem is, each compiler pass is compiling different source (using <includes> and <excludes> into different destinations (using outputDirectory) and I cant find any way to configure them without doing so in the <executions> sub-element of pom using my plugin. I could do this with an archetype, but it seems to me to be a little more elegant to do this with a custom packaging. Any suggestions?
@CODE:<packaging> <project>

 Now I have a big problem, tha app work properly in all my developer device and in the simulator and the app read and write properly the file. I submit the app on the Apple store but others user can't read/write this file. Why this? Thanks Paolo

@CONTENT:I am facing some problems in a cross platform program : when I open a python shell in Linux and in Windows, I don't get the same time from the Epoch. In Linux, I tried to do dpkg-reconfigure tzdata. Currently, in linux I get that avec the dpkg-reconfigure tzdata : Current default time zone: 'Europe/London'
Local time is now:      Mon May 30 10:29:52 BST 2011.

 As you can see, we don't see any thing for 1970 !!!! Does anyone know how can I change the timezone of Debian, into my own one !? Thank you, Mr_Kaz Old message : Hello, I am facing some problems in a cross platform program : when I open a python shell in Linux and in Windows, I don't get the same time from the Epoch. In linux (debian squeeze) : >>> import time

 As you can see there is an hour of difference. Does any one know why ? Thank you, Mr_Kaz Thank you for your answer that is what i did then : in Windows : >>> time.tzname

>>> time.timezone

>>> time.daylight

 in Linux : >>> time.tzname

>>> time.daylight

 I don't want to use gmtime if I don't know why there is a problem. I tried to change the time in Linux to get the same as in Windows (I started the development of my software in Windows and it works perfectly, that's why I want to change the system time in Linux and not in windows). In Linux, I tried to do dpkg-reconfigure tzdata. But whatever I choose the time is still wrong. Currently, in linux I get that avec the dpkg-reconfigure tzdata : Current default time zone: 'Europe/London'
Local time is now:      Mon May 30 10:29:52 BST 2011.
Universal Time is now:  Mon May 30 09:29:52 UTC 2011.
 I don't understand which time used in Windows. I am using 'UTC'. I create this script : import time
print time.tzname, time.timezone, time.altzone, time.daylight
print time.localtime()
print time.localtime(0)
 On linux that returns : ('GMT', 'BST') 0 -3600 1
time.struct_time(tm_year=2011, tm_mon=5, tm_mday=30, tm_hour=11, tm_min=35, tm_sec=8, tm_wday=0, tm_yday=150, tm_isdst=1)
time.struct_time(tm_year=1970, tm_mon=1, tm_mday=1, tm_hour=1, tm_min=0, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=3, tm_yday=1, tm_isdst=0)
 On windows that returns : ('GMT', 'GMT (heure d\x92\xe9t\xe9)') 0 -3600 1
time.struct_time(tm_year=2011, tm_mon=5, tm_mday=30, tm_hour=11, tm_min=40, tm_sec=1, tm_wday=0, tm_yday=150, tm_isdst=1)

 And as you can see, there is still the problem of time since the Epoch (it was 1 am at the epoch...) I create another topic because it seems not to be anymore due to python : Timezone issues

@TITLE:What does the prototype belongs to the class not the instance mean in javascript?
@CONTENT:I asked the question: Why cant I declare a constructor instantiate an object and then access the prototype? And you can see that I have marked the answer. I understand the response but Im a bit confused as to what he means by: The prototype belongs to the class, not the instance:
 Does this mean that javascript has a class in this example? I thought javascript was classless? It only has function constructors... At what point does a function constructor become a class? Is it when you add other members to it using the .prototype accessor?

@TITLE:Simple Comparing of two texts in R
@CONTENT:I want to compare two texts to similarity, therefore i need a simple function to list clearly and chronologically the words and phrases occurring in both texts. these words/sentences should be highlighted or underlined for better visualization) on the base of @joris Meys ideas, i added an array to divide text into sentences and subordinate sentences. this is how it looks like:   textparts <- function (text){
  textparts <- c("\\,", "\\.")
  i <- 1
  while(i<=length(textparts)){
        text <- unlist(strsplit(text, textparts[i]))
        i <- i+1
  }
  return (text)
}

textparts1 <- textparts("This is a complete sentence, whereas this is a dependent clause. This thing works.")
textparts2 <- textparts("This could be a sentence, whereas this is a dependent clause. Plagiarism is not cool. This thing works.")

  commonWords <- intersect(textparts1, textparts2)
  commonWords <- paste("\\<(",commonWords,")\\>",sep="")


  for(x in commonWords){
    textparts1 <- gsub(x, "\\1*", textparts1,ignore.case=TRUE)
    textparts2 <- gsub(x, "\\1*", textparts2,ignore.case=TRUE)
  }
  return(list(textparts1,textparts2))
 However, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. I WOULD like to have results like these: >   return(list(textparts1,textparts2))
[[1]]
[1] "This is a complete sentence"         " whereas this is a dependent clause*" " This thing works*"                  

[[2]]
[1] "This could be a sentence"            " whereas this is a dependent clause*" " Plagiarism is not cool"             " This thing works*"           
 whereas i get none results.
@CODE:textparts <- function (text){

  i <- 1

@TITLE:What is the benefit of Enforce Join option in Crystal Reports?
@CONTENT:What is the benefit the makes SAP Crystal reports Enforce Join default option in Link Dialog is "Not Enforced"? Is it performance issue? because I noticed if you don't select field from the joined table it'll generate SELECT query with only fields of the selected Table only without any joins. here's some information about the Enforce Join options: Not Enforced: When you select this option, the link you've created is used only if it's explicitly required by the Select statement. This is the default option. Your users can create reports based on the selected tables without restriction (that is, without enforcement based on other tables). Enforced From: When you select this option, if the "to" table for the link is used, the link is enforced. For example, if you create a link from Table A to Table B using Enforce From and select only a field from Table B, the Select statement will still include the join to Table A because it is enforced. Conversely, selecting only from Table A with the same join condition will not cause the join to Table B to be enforced. Enforced To: When you select this option, if the "from" table for the link is used, the link is enforced. For example, if you create a link from Table A to Table B using Enforce To and select only a field from Table A, the join to Table B will be enforced, and the Select statement that is generated will include both tables. Enforced Both: When you select this option, if either the "from" table or the "to" table for this link is used, the link is enforced.

@LINK:/questions/6117901/how-can-i-force-jquery-validate-to-check-for-duplicate-username-in-database
@TITLE:How can I force jQuery Validate to check for duplicate username in database?
@CONTENT:I'm coming into the middle of this project so I'm having to do a bit of re-writing because of sloppy code. I am using jQuery 1.6.1 and Validate 1.8.1. First, here's the PHP which runs the back-end (dbquery.php): include("../includes/dbconnection.php");
session_start();

$location='';
$action='';
if($_GET['action']=='')
    $action=$_POST['action'];
else
    $action=$_GET['action'];

if($action=='checkusername'){
    $error='';
    $username=$_GET['username'];
    // exclude denied account
    $checkuserquery=mysql_query("Select * from database_users as user LEFT OUTER JOIN  database_approval as approval on user.user_id=approval.approval_user_id  where (approval.approval_status IS NULL or approval.approval_status <> 4) and user_username='".$username."'");
    $checkuserresult=mysql_numrows($checkuserquery);
    if($checkuserresult>0) {
        $error = 'false';
    } else {
        $error = 'true';
    }
    echo $error;
} 
 I'm trying to use jQuery Validate script to query the database for existing usernames on the fly. I either get two extremes: it never works or it always spits back given username as taken. I believe the problem is that I cannot grab the input value of the username variable. When I create alert (username) within function (output), it returns nothing. My assumption is that .val() is only working when the page loads thus anything I'm typing into the input isn't working for some reason. Here's the jQuery I've re-written and copied from sources online: $(document).ready(function(){

$.validator.addMethod("checkAvailability",function(value,element){
    var username = $("#username").val();
    $.ajax({
          url: "dbquery.php",
          type: "GET",
          async: false,
          data: "action=checkusername&username="+username,
          success: function(output) {
                     return output;
         }
     });
},"Sorry, this user name is not available");

// jQuery Validation script
    $("#signup").validate( {
        rules: {
            username: {
                required: true,
                minlength: 5,
                checkAvailability: true // remote check for duplicate username
            },
        },
        messages: {
            username: {
                required: "Enter a username"
            }
        },
        submitHandler: function(form) {
            form.submit();
        }
    });

});
 I am only a beginner with jQuery but am getting my hands pretty dirty with this code. Am I on the right track or should I use remote: under rules and username? I've been told that the remote method won't work because of the dynamnic nature of the input value I'm trying to validate. The other major problem I've been running into is making the remote error message ONLY show up when a username already exists in the database. Unfortunately, it shows up whether dbquery.php comes back as true or false. If I try an existing username, it returns false, then I rewrite a new username that returns true, the message doesn't go away. Similarly, when I write a username and it returns true, I still get the remote error message. The original coder was referencing getXMLHTTP and using ActiveXObject. The method he programmed seemed a little outdated so I'm trying to make the code a little more contemporary and clean it up. 5/25 - I am editing this to include the OLD original JavaScript code which works but is using the outdated method which I'd like to get away from (I have since removed the following code and replaced with jQuery above): function getXMLHTTP() { //function to return the xml http object
    var xmlhttp=false;    
    try{
        xmlhttp=new XMLHttpRequest();
    }
    catch(e)    {        
        try{            
            xmlhttp= new ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP");
        }
        catch(e){
            try{
            xmlhttp = new ActiveXObject("Msxml2.XMLHTTP");
            }
            catch(e1){
                xmlhttp=false;
            }
        }
    }

    return xmlhttp;
}
//validate username
function validateUsername(username){
    var strURL="dbquery.php?action=checkusername&username="+username;
    var req = getXMLHTTP();        
    if (req) {            
        req.onreadystatechange = function() {
            if (req.readyState == 4) {
                // only if "OK"
                if (req.status == 200) {          
                    if(req.responseText=='notavailable'){

                        document.getElementById("errorusername").innerHTML="<div id=\"errors\"><strong>"+username+"</strong> is already taken by another user.</div>";
                        error = true;

@TITLE:enabling grails hibernate filters
@CONTENT:Hi I am using the Grails filter plugin I am trying to define a default filter as below // Defined inside the Book entity
static hibernateFilters = {
    activeFilter(condition:'active=1', default:true)
}
 When i run my integration tests the filter does not apply for dynamic finder methods like Book.findAll()
 If I add the below line in the BootStrap.groovy class Book.enableHibernateFilter('activeFilter')
 Then the filter is applied. However when the application is run the filter is never applied, with or without the above code in BootStrap.groovy Any ideas ? After a little digging around this is what i have found The hibernate filter plugin works well without the zkgrails plugin however the two cannot seem to work together :( The below code snippet seems to be the problem for me. I think we could have two issues here 1) Initially the execution gets to all(controller:'', action:'') only once during application startup. I am thinking it should get there each time there is a new request and hence a new session. 2) Even if it somehow gets there after certain modification, I do not think it'll get past all(controller:'', action:'') composers are used in zkoss class HibernateFilterFilters { def filters = {
    all(controller:'*', action:'*') {
        before = {
            def session = grailsApplication.mainContext.sessionFactory.currentSession

@TITLE:How to write data from Form in HTML to XML with Javascript
@CONTENT:This is an assignment from my class. What I need to do is create a registration page. When the user presses the submit button, I have take all the information on the form and write it to an existing XML file using Javascript. This is done on the client side, only through HTML, Javascript, and XML. By the way, my Professor purposely did not teach us how to do this because he wants us to research on it by ourselves. Also, I'm not too familiar with Javascript, especially with the built in functions, if possible please explain what each line or method of code is doing. Let me begin, here's how my existing XML looks like:     <?xml version ="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
    <!--GGFGFGFVBFVVVHVBV-->
    <PersonInfo>
      <Person Usrname="Bob111" Pswd="Smith111" personid="111" FirstName="Bob" LastName="Smith" DOB="01/01/1960" Gender="M" Title="Hello1"> 
      </Person>
    <!-- several more lines of <person> here --> 
    </PersonInfo>  
 When saving the form data, it has to follow all the layout within , basically I would need Usrname, Pswd, personid, and so on. Basically, from what I understand, I have to create the XML line "Person" from my registration page once I press submit. Then push it to the array that already have my XML information, then write over my XML document with the information on the array. My problem is, I have exactly no idea how to do that. For those who wants to know how my registration page looks like, here it is:     <html>

    <head>
    <title>Registration</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="CSS_LABs.css" />
    </head>


    <body>

    <div class="form">
    <form id="Registration" action="" method="get">

    Username:<input type="text" name="usrname" maxlength="10"/> <br/>
    Password:<input type="password" name="pswd" maxlength="20"/> <br/>

    <hr>

    PersonID:<input type="text" name="PID" /> <br>

    <hr>

    First Name:<input type="text" name="fname"/> <br>
    Last Name:<input type="text" name="lname"/>

    <hr>

    DOB:<input type="text" name="dob" /> <br>

    <hr>

    Gender:<input type="text" name="sex" /> <br>

    <hr>

    Title:<input type="text" name="title" /> <br>

    Secret Question:<br>
    <select name="secret?">
    </select> <br>

    Answer:<input type="text" name="answer" /> <br> <br>

    <input type="submit" value="submit" />
    </form>
    </div>

    </body>

    </html>
 By the way, I know certain information on my HTML document may not be worded properly, so do hope you guys don't mind. Also, I would also have to fix up my XML later by putting the answer to the secret question within later. Alright, thanks a lot in advance guys. UPDATE!!! Here we go, I finally figured out how to create an XML document with Javascript, here's the code:     var xmlDoc = new ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLDOM");
    var fso = new ActiveXObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject");
    var FILENAME = 'G:\\CST2309 - Web Programming 1\\Copy of Take Home Exam - Copy\\PersonXML2.xml';

    function SaveXML(UserData) 
    {   
        var file = fso.CreateTextFile(FILENAME, true);
        file.WriteLine('<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>\n');
        file.WriteLine('<PersonInfo>\n');

        for (countr = 0; countr < UserData.length; countr++) {
            file.Write('    <Person ');
            file.Write('Usrname="' + UserData[countr][0] + '" ');
            file.Write('Pswd="' + UserData[countr][1] + '" ');
            file.Write('PersonID="' + UserData[countr][2] + '" ');
            file.Write('FirstName="' + UserData[countr][3] + '" ');
            file.Write('LastName="' + UserData[countr][4] + '" ');
            file.Write('Gender="' + UserData[countr][5] + '" ');
            file.Write('DOB="' + UserData[countr][6] + '" ');
            file.Write('Title="' + UserData[countr][7] + '"');
            file.WriteLine('></Person>\n');
        } // end for countr

        file.WriteLine('</PersonInfo>\n');
        file.Close();

    } // end SaveXML function --------------------

    function LoadXML(xmlFile) 
    {
        xmlDoc.load(xmlFile);
        return xmlDoc.documentElement;
    } //end function LoadXML()

    function initialize_array() 
    {
        var person = new Array();
        var noFile = true;
        var xmlObj;
        if (fso.FileExists(FILENAME)) 
        {
            xmlObj = LoadXML(FILENAME);
            noFile = false;
            } // if
        else 
        {
            xmlObj = LoadXML("PersonXML.xml");
            //alert("local" + xmlObj);
            } // end if

        var usrCount = 0;
        while (usrCount < xmlObj.childNodes.length) 
        {
            var tmpUsrs = new Array(xmlObj.childNodes(usrCount).getAttribute("Usrname"),
                                    xmlObj.childNodes(usrCount).getAttribute("Pswd"),
                        xmlObj.childNodes(usrCount).getAttribute("PersonID"),
                                    xmlObj.childNodes(usrCount).getAttribute("FirstName"),
                                    xmlObj.childNodes(usrCount).getAttribute("LastName"),
                                    xmlObj.childNodes(usrCount).getAttribute("Gender"),
                                    xmlObj.childNodes(usrCount).getAttribute("DOB"),
                                    xmlObj.childNodes(usrCount).getAttribute("Title"));
            person.push(tmpUsrs);
            usrCount++;
             }   //end while
        if (noFile == false)
            fso.DeleteFile(FILENAME);
        SaveXML(person);
    }   // end function initialize_array()  
 What this code here is doing is that, it takes my original XML file and loads it up into an array so it can create a new XML file. Basically I got the creating the XML file part down, but still need help with the rest of my stuff. My goal is trying to take my form data and push it into my existing array, not overwrite it, add to it, so I can update my existing XML file with the new registration information. This is where I have absolutely no idea how to do. Some pointers would be nice.

I know there are PHP captchas out there. I know there are numeric captchas out there. But I'm looking for a PHP numeric Javascript-independent captcha. The only numeric captcha's I've found are either for ASP.NET or jQuery/JS based ones. I don't want any of those as an answer to the question. And I'm not taking about a small website here. In the answer I'd like to know whether your suggestion puts a lot of strain on the server or not.

@TITLE:Change set predecessor using cleartool
@CONTENT:Eventually I'd like to find out how to diff a version in an UCM activity with the change set predecessor, using the command prompt, assuming there is more than one version for the same file in the activity. I already know how to get all the versions of a file in an activity. In general I could diff the latest version in the set with the earliest-1, but if the earliest version is the first version, because this is a new stream, then I'll have to figure the original stream. And that is also something I don't know how to accomplish. A single cleartool command that receives a version and tells its predecessor will solve all my problems. Any ideas?

@TITLE:How to avoid building intermediates and useless AST nodes with ANTLR3?
@CONTENT:I wrote an ANTLR3 grammar subdivided into smaller rules to increase readability. For example: messageSequenceChart:
  'msc' mscHead bmsc 'endmsc' end
;

# Where mscHead is a shortcut to :
mscHead:
  mscName mscParameterDecl? timeOffset? end
  mscInstInterface? mscGateInterface
;
 I know the built-in ANTLR AST building feature allows the user to declare intermediate AST nodes that won't be in the final AST. But what if you build the AST by hand? messageSequenceChart returns [msc::MessageSequenceChart* n = 0]:
  'msc' mscHead bmsc'endmsc' end
  {
    $n = new msc::MessageSequenceChart(/* mscHead subrules accessors like $mscHead.mscName.n ? */
                                       $bmsc.n);
  }
;

mscHead:
  mscName mscParameterDecl? timeOffset? end
;
 The documentation does not talk about such a thing. So it looks like I will have to create nodes for every intermediate rules to be able to access their subrules result. Does anyone know a better solution ? Thank you.

@TITLE:Setting property to newly alloc'd object using accessor cause memory leak
@CONTENT:I just want confirmation on whether or not the following causes a memory leak. .h file @property (nonatomic, retain) MyObject *foo;
 .m file @synthesize foo;
...

self.foo = [[MyObject alloc] init];
 dealloc is setup as [foo release];
 My understanding is that the implementation of the auto-generated accessor method looks like -(void)setFoo:(MyObject *)newObject {
    if (foo != newObject) {
        [foo release];
        foo = [newObject retain];
    }
}
 Walking through self.foo = [[MyObject alloc] init]; now reads to me as, "allocated a new MyObject object whose retain count will be 1, pass it to setFoo:, foo will never be equal to myObject as it was newly allocated, so release the old value, increment the retain count of newObject making it 2 and assign it to foo" dealloc releases foo therefore setting its retain count to 1, which means this object is leaked? To do this safely we should write our code like self.foo = [[[MyObject alloc] init] autorelease];
 Is my understanding correct? EDIT I realize this question is not really appropriate for SO, so feel free to point me to a better place to ask this type of question as well.
@CODE:@property (nonatomic, retain) MyObject *foo; @synthesize foo;
...

self.foo = [[MyObject alloc] init]; dealloc [foo release]; -(void)setFoo:(MyObject *)newObject {

@TITLE:HTML5 Web Audio API, porting from javax.sound and getting distortion
@CONTENT:I have a requirement to generate audio on the fly (generating from wav or mp3 files is not an option). Luckily the new WebAudio API (FF4 and Chrome 13) provides this functionality. I have some Java code i'm porting to Javascript that looks like this: byte[] buffer = new byte[]{ 56, -27, 88, -29, 88, -29, 88, -29 ............ };
AudioFormat af = new AudioFormat(44100, 16, 1, true, false);

sdl.open(af, 1470 * 4); //create 4 frame audio buffer
sdl.start();
sdl.write(buffer, 0, buffer.length);
 I'm trying to get this working with the Web Audio API, but it is extremely distorted. Here is the code i'm using in JS: var buffer = [ 56, -27, 88, -29, 88, -29, 88, -29 ............ ];
var ctx = new webkitAudioContext();
var src = ctx.createBufferSource();
src.buffer = ctx.createBuffer(1, buffer.length, 44100);
src.buffer.getChannelData(0).set(buffer);
src.connect(ctx.destination);

@TITLE:Graphical issue with spinner control in Android
@CONTENT:My first (old) Android app (Suspension Calculator) is showing a problem I cannot find a solution for: the spinner control on some spinners is showing transparent lines in unwanted places. The pattern is this: every other spinner is having this problem, starting with the first spinner control. So while spinners 2, 4, 6, ... have no unwanted lines, spinners 1, 3, 5, ... have them. The following image (link below) shows the spinner in selected state first, and in unselected state after the red separator. In selected state, the transparent line is at baseline height for the entire control except some places where the button text can be. It's a little different in unselected state. I cannot provide an image directly: [...] as a spam prevention mechanism, new users aren't allowed to post images. But I can give you a link: Screenshot that illustrated the graphical spinner problem The XML file under res/layout looks like this: <ScrollView ...>

@TITLE:Get Wifi Interface name on Android
@CONTENT:Possible Duplicate: How to get the wifi network interface name in java I am currently developing a sort of wifi sniffer. To achieve that I use a tcpdump binary compiled for arm. But it's assume that I know the name of the Wifi Interface. According to the SDK documentation NetworkInterface provide a getName() method. I plan to use this method, so the first step is to get the NetworkInterface objet corresponding to my wifi interface. To do that I use the WifiInfo to get the ip adress, then get an InetAddress corresponding to this IP and finally get an instance of NetworkInterface by using the static method getByInetAddress(InetAddress address). Here is my code : WifiInfo wifiInfo = wifiManager.getConnectionInfo();
int ipAddress = wifiInfo.getIpAddress();
byte[] bytes = BigInteger.valueOf(ipAddress).toByteArray();
InetAddress addr = InetAddress.getByAddress(bytes);
NetworkInterface netInterface = NetworkInterface.getByInetAddress(addr);

 But I except something like : eth0
 I also try the isVirtual() method but it doesn't compile, and I get an error message saying the method isVirtual() is not define for the type NetworkInterface. I don't understand what is going on... Any help will be appreciate.

@TITLE:Non Latin Characters & ouch
@CONTENT:I'm getting to know Cake PHP, which has unearthed a general question about best practice in terms of PHP / MySQL character set stuff, which I'm hoping can be answered here. My (practice) system contains a mysql table of movies. This list was sourced from an Excel sheet, which was exported as CSV, and imported via phpMyAdmin. I noticed that titles with more "exotic" glyphs have issues rendering in the browser, eg The ? in Am?lie. Using Cake or plain PHP, it renders as a ?, unless transformed via htmlentities into a &eacute;. Links with the special characters don't render at all. If I use my Cake input form to enter an <alt>0233, this is rendered correctly in source, but as &Atilde;&copy; via htmlentities. After a quick SO search, I decided maybe UTF-8 would fix stuff, hence I changed the PHP source, and CSV file encoding to UTF-8 made sure the <meta> stuff was there (it was already via Cake's default layout). made sure my browsers thinks the doc is UTF-8 (they do) changed the collation on the MySQL DB to utf-8 general_ci (as an educated stab from avalable UTF-8 options) deleted and reimported my data However, I'm still stuck. I note that phpMyAdmin manages to render the characters "correctly" in it's HTML source when browsing records. I sense that document encoding's to blame, however, am wondering if someone can provide the best answer to: what's the best way to move my data from Excel to MySQL to preserve glyphs? what's the optimum settings for my tables to accommodate this? I'd prefer to use UTF-8 to natively display the likes of ?, what can I do in Cake to avoid making loads of calls to the likes of htmlentities ie is there a configuration setting or way I set stuff up that makes this more friendly and lets Cake native helpers like Html->link work? Some code, just in case: movies controller excerpt.. function index() {
        $this->set('movies' , $this->Movie->find('all'));

@TITLE:manually add UITabBar to UITableViewController
@CONTENT:I have a standard app with a navigation controller managing several UITableViewController classes. I want to add a UITabBar to the root view (a UITableViewController) to manage filtering the selection of objects showin in the UITableView. I dont want/need a UITabBarController. The UITabBar is only for functionality and UI (radio-button style selection and familiar tabbar UI). I just want to manually create a UITabBar and add it to my view anchored/locked to the very bottom of the screen like is the case when using UITabBarControllers. My main problem is I can't figure out what I should be adding the UITabBar as a subview too. I dont want to add it to the controllers self.tableView because then it would be achored to the bottom of the scrolling TableView and not always visible on the bottom of the screen. I also tried adding to the view.tableView.superview but that didnt seem to work as well. Any help, or am I completely doing this "filtering of tableview data the wrong way" and should be using something else instead?

      td = td + ' ' + $(this).find('input').val();
      alert(td);
   });
})
 my question is: How to add text before the data from the row? like for example, this code alert the first row like data1.1 data1.2 data1.3, then the second row like data2.1 data2.2 data2.3, I want my output to be displayed like this [ {"name":"data1.1","comparison":"data1.2", "value":"data1.3"}, {"name":"data2.1","comparison":"data2.2", "value":"data2.3"}, {"name":"data3.1","comparison":"data3.2", "value":"data3.3"} {.....and so on......}] but before that happen, i want to check if all the FIRST cell in a row is not empty. if its empty, skip that row then proceed to next row. is there somebody can help me, please...

This is the code for the inital load:     //first load
$.ajax({

    data:"city=&gender=&category=",
    success:function(data){

                            autoHover: true,

    }

});//end ajax
 This is the code for handling the change of a filter: $(".statelist :input").click(function(){

    var carousel = $('#thumbs').data('jcarousel');  
    var state = $('.statelist input:checked').attr('value');
    var gender = $('.gender input:checked').attr('value');
    var category =$('.category input:checked').attr('value');
        $.ajax({

 I referred bxSlider's documentation and it had a built-in function to handle a reset: destroyShow(): function() reloadShow(): function() I am confused as to what I am doing wrong. Even tried emptying the carousel div before loading it with data, using .empty(), no dice. Thoughts? Edit: link to the bxSlider website: http://bxslider.com/

--    due to business case like quantity may damage and short quantity like that. 
--    So we maintain a status for that eg: OK, Damage, also we have to calculate

@TITLE:object inheritance and nested cmd
@CONTENT:This is probably a basic OO question: I'm trying to do a nested console menu with cmd which has gone well. I also want all my sub-consoles to have access to the same objects. This has not gone well. My simple Example: import cmd
class MainConsole(cmd.Cmd):
    def __init__(self,obj1,obj2):
        cmd.Cmd.__init__(self)
        self.prompt = ">"
        self.obj1 = obj1 # The objects I want access to in all my consoles.
        self.obj2 = obj2
        self.menu1 = SubConsole1() # I could pass in the objects here as arguments
        self.menu2 = SubConsole2() # but there should be a better way.

    def do_menu1(self,args):
        self.menu1.cmdloop()
    def do_menu2(self,args):
        self.menu2.cmdloop()
    def do_info(self,args):
        self.menu1.do_info(args)
        self.menu2.do_info(args)
    def do_exit(self,args):
        return -1

class SubConsole1(cmd.Cmd,MainConsole):

        self.prompt = "1>"
    def do_action(self,args):

        self.someattr2 = init_value * 2

object1 = anobject(1)
object2 = anobject(2)
c=MainConsole(object1,object2)

@TITLE:How to send a file from a servlet the right way?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to send a file to a user from an http servlet. The servlet runs some identification tests (on the request) and then sends the client a file. This generally works but now I turned on my TOMCAT server redirects to https and when I try to access the servlet and download the file from either IE6 or IE8 it fails and I get this exception: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Cannot forward after response has been committed
 (on the localhost.log) and ClientAbortException:  java.net.SocketException: Connection reset by peer: socket write error
 (in the servlet log) The code that does the sending (Simplified): private void sendFile(HttpServletResponse response, byte[] file, String clientFileName)
{
    ServletOutputStream op = null;

    setContentType(response);
    response.setHeader("Content-Disposition", "attachment; filename=\"" + clientFileName + "\"");
    // send byte array to output buffer. 
    op = response.getOutputStream();

    // Content Length must be set after all processing done.
    response.setContentLength((int) file.length);   
    op.write(file);
}
 Is this the correct way to send a file from a servlet? What's the best way? Thanks!! UPDATE Used the code from @BalusC artice in this link: http://balusc.blogspot.com/2007/07/fileservlet.html This made it work. Still doesn't work in IE6-IE8 when used from Gmail because of a filtering stage gmail adds to downloads in these browsers. UPDATE 2 The problem seems to be with Gmail + Internet Explorer 6-8. I'm Assuming that gmail is doing a redirect (That's actually pretty obvious if you look at the url on the page after you click the link in the mail). Is Client-Pull technique my only solution?

@LINK:/questions/5795632/orchard-mvc-wcf-service-url-with-area
@TITLE:Orchard/MVC WCF Service Url with Area
@CONTENT:Bertrand created a blog post to specify how to use IoC in WCF Modules for Orchard. In 1.1, you can create a SVC file using the new Orchard host factory: <%@ ServiceHost Language="C#" Debug="true" 
    Service="MyModule.IMyService, MyAssembly"
    Factory="Orchard.Wcf.OrchardServiceHostFactory, Orchard.Framework" %>
Then register your service normally as an IDependency but with service and operation contract attributes:

using System.ServiceModel;

namespace MyModule {
    [ServiceContract]
    public interface IMyService : IDependency {
        [OperationContract]
        string GetUserEmail(string username);
    }
}
 My question is that all of Orchard's modules are really area's. So how can you build a route that hits the svc file created in the area/module? Should you use the full physical path to get to the svc file (tried that and it caused a web.config issue since it was bridging a site and area). http://localhost/modules/WebServices/MyService.svc
 Or do you create a ServiceRoute with WebServiceHostFactory/OrchardServiceHostFactory? new ServiceRoute("WebServices/MyService", new OrchardServiceHostFactory(), typeof(MyService))
 Whatever I try I get a 404 when trying to hit the resource. I was able to get this working using a wcf Application project and setting WCF as a stand alone application, my issues started when trying to bring it into Orchard/MVC. UPDATE Thanks for the help Piotr, This is the steps I took to implement the service. Routes.cs new RouteDescriptor {   Priority = 20,
                        Route = new ServiceRoute(
                                      "Services",
                                      new WebServiceHostFactory(),
                                      typeof(MyService)) }
 If I use OrchardServiceHostFactory() instead of WebServiceHostFactory() I get the following error. Operation is not valid due to the current state of the object.
 Orchard Root Web.Config   <system.serviceModel>
    <serviceHostingEnvironment aspNetCompatibilityEnabled="true" multipleSiteBindingsEnabled="true"/>

            via the attributes on the <standardEndpoint> element below
        -->
        <standardEndpoint name="" helpEnabled="true" automaticFormatSelectionEnabled="true"/>
      </webHttpEndpoint>
    </standardEndpoints>

 MyService [ServiceContract]
public interface IMyService : IDependency
{
    [OperationContract]
    string GetTest();
}

[AspNetCompatibilityRequirements(RequirementsMode = AspNetCompatibilityRequirementsMode.Allowed)]
class MyService : IMyService
{
    public string GetTest()
    {
        return "test";
    }
}
 I couldn't get the service working by just modifying the module's web.config. I get the following error ASP.NET routing integration feature requires ASP.NET compatibility.
 UPDATE 2 Orchard Root Web.Config   <system.serviceModel>
    <serviceHostingEnvironment aspNetCompatibilityEnabled="true" multipleSiteBindingsEnabled="true" />
    <!-- ... -->
  </system.serviceModel>
 Routes.cs public IEnumerable<RouteDescriptor> GetRoutes() {
    return new[] {
                     new RouteDescriptor {   Priority = 20,
                                             Route = new ServiceRoute(
                                                 "Services",
                                                 new OrchardServiceHostFactory(),
                                                 typeof(IMyService))

                     }
                 };

 This works, the key here is that you must call typeof on the object that is referencing IDependency, WorkContextModule.IsClosingTypeOf cant handle the object that consumes the dependancy, it must take the Interface that it is directly called by.
@CODE:<%@ ServiceHost Language="C#" Debug="true" 
    Service="MyModule.IMyService, MyAssembly"
    Factory="Orchard.Wcf.OrchardServiceHostFactory, Orchard.Framework" %>
Then register your service normally as an IDependency but with service and operation contract attributes:

using System.ServiceModel;

namespace MyModule {
    [ServiceContract]
    public interface IMyService : IDependency {
        [OperationContract]
        string GetUserEmail(string username);
    }
} http://localhost/modules/WebServices/MyService.svc new ServiceRoute("WebServices/MyService", new OrchardServiceHostFactory(), typeof(MyService)) new RouteDescriptor {   Priority = 20,
                        Route = new ServiceRoute(
                                      "Services",
                                      new WebServiceHostFactory(),
                                      typeof(MyService)) } Operation is not valid due to the current state of the object. <system.serviceModel>

@CONTENT:In my ASP.NET application I am using the WebRequest class and I want to use the default system proxy. Here is the code I am using. private static bool CheckIfUriIsReachable(string uri)
{
    bool reachable = true;

    var request = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(uri);
    request.Method = "HEAD";

}
 This works perfectly well when run as part of a console application - it correctly picks up the system proxy (I assume the IE proxy for the signed-on user on the PC), However, this does not work when run as part of an ASP.NET application on the same machine. No proxy is found. I assume this is because ASP.NET is running under a user account that does not have an IE proxy setting in the system registry. I have tried to include the following in the web.config file but this does not work. <system.net>
   <defaultProxy>
       <proxy usesystemdefault="true" />
   </defaultProxy>
</system.net>
 My question is how to setup an ASP.NET 3.5 application to correctly use the default proxy used by IE?

@LINK:/questions/5748973/why-is-my-truetype-font-of-size-11-rendering-different-than-windows
@TITLE:why is my truetype font of size 11 rendering different than windows?
@CONTENT:To wit: Notepad is opened, the font selected as "Arial, Size 11", the words "this is just a test" carefully entered, a screenshot taken: The following Python code is entered and run: import ImageFont, ImageDraw, Image
im = Image.open("c:/textimg.png") #the above image

pilfont = ImageFont.truetype("arial.ttf", 11)

compimg = Image.new("RGB", im.size, (255, 255, 255))
draw = ImageDraw.Draw(compimg)

draw.text((0,0), "this is just a test", (0,0,0), font=pilfont)

compimg.save("c:/compimg.png")
 Yet the result is disappointingly different: Not only is it the wrong size, but it's also slightly shaded, whereas the notepad rendering is crisp and crosses no pixel boundaries. How can I get it to render like notepad does? I've had this exact issue with pygame as well, so I think I'm missing some fundamental understanding about TTF here. UPDATE: I tried it with pygame again. It does the same thing. It does have an option to turn off anti-aliasing but it looks like it just lops off whatever pixels it would have antialiased based on some threshold. The closest approximation I got was using size 15. The code was: pygfont = pygame.font.Font(r"c:\windows\fonts\arial.ttf", 15)
surf = pygfont.render("this is just a test", False, (0,0,0), (255,255,255))
pygame.image.save(surf, r"c:\pygameimg.png")
 and the result (notepad original on top for comparison): Gah why can't I offer a bounty right away? UPDATE: here's comparing all the methods: PIL 15, then notepad 11, then pygame 15 anti-alias-off, then pygame 15 anti-alias-on. PIL 15 actually has the right proportions, it's just anti-aliased. so: why 15 vs. 11? how to make it do it the same way windows does? (and wtf is pygame doing?)
@CODE:import ImageFont, ImageDraw, Image
im = Image.open("c:/textimg.png") #the above image

pilfont = ImageFont.truetype("arial.ttf", 11)

compimg = Image.new("RGB", im.size, (255, 255, 255))
draw = ImageDraw.Draw(compimg)

draw.text((0,0), "this is just a test", (0,0,0), font=pilfont)

compimg.save("c:/compimg.png") pygfont = pygame.font.Font(r"c:\windows\fonts\arial.ttf", 15)
surf = pygfont.render("this is just a test", False, (0,0,0), (255,255,255))
pygame.image.save(surf, r"c:\pygameimg.png")

@TITLE:Another questionable jQuery Quiz answer at W3Schools
@CONTENT:There is a jQuery quiz posted on the W3Schools site here... http://www.w3schools.com/quiztest/quiztest.asp?qtest=jQuery Question #16 is as follows, Which jQuery function is used to prevent code from running, before the document is finished loading? A. $(document).load() B. $(document).ready() C. $(body).onload() I got it wrong by picking answer A. (their official answer is B.) I answered it, thinking that I knew the following, document.load fires after everything on the page loads including all images document.ready fires only after the DOM is loaded (not necessarily all the images have been loaded) I interpreted the original question's wording of, "document is finished loading", to include everything (with all the images). After all, I thought that's why they called it "document.load". Also for their answer to be correct, you'd have to conclude that "DOM" is the equivalent to "document". This does not seem right otherwise why call it "document object model" (DOM) instead of just "document"? Despite the W3School claim that B is the correct answer, what is really the correct answer? Thank-you for your thoughts. Sidenote: Quoting my own comments in my other related question... "I actually learn most of my jQuery over at the jQuery site and come search here at StackOverflow when I get stuck. I was mostly playing around with the quiz at W3School because I was investigating their "prerequisites" for jQuery Certification. I don't consider myself to be a jQuery expert but I easily scored 95% (19/20) on their quiz. Seeing the improper wording in that answer, I figured I'd confirm what I already suspected by posting here. My opinions on these kinds of certifications are now shifting." EDIT: I notified the W3Schools of the existence of this thread. EDIT 2: When I answered the original quiz question, I was thinking of $(window).load(), therefore my quiz answer was clearly incorrect. I believe this fact leaves none of the three multiple choice options as the correct answer. See my detailed answer below.

@TITLE:How to resolve poor nHibernate collection initialization
@CONTENT:nHibernate3; retrieving 4xxx records out of an EAV data schema. When nHibernate, or .NET, goes to initialize those collections for the first time, we're seeing a severe penalty. Subsequent calls appear to perform more efficiently. Running the same queries in SQL Server Management Studio result in expected quick return times. Using Fluent and runtime mapping instead of .hbm.xml; curious if serialized mapping would help here? nHibernate Profiler and log4net logging didn't seem to give me much to go on. A total of something like 140,000 entities are hydrated in this process. Attached a screenshot of my dotTrace performance tracing that shows the collection initialization penalty: Have tried join and eager fetchtypes, with no apparent results, but am not 100% certain I implemented those correctly -- does just the parent need to be so designated, or do the children tables also need to be flagged? var products = ((HandleSession)_handleSession).Session.CreateCriteria(typeof(Product))
                    .SetFetchMode("Product", FetchMode.Eager)

 In my code, if I want to play a video from the view without the gallery, I hide the other. linearLayoutVideoGallery.setVisibility(GONE);
linearLayoutLiveVideo.setVisibility(VISIBLE);
playVideo();
 The problem is that the archived_video_view stays on top and only the gallery hides. Any tips? Let me know if you need any additional information. Thanks! EDIT: Here is my if statement for choosing the menu items inside onCreate(). Hopefully this will help. When I click position==1 and then postion==2, the gallery is gone but the archived_video_view is still there paused so I can only see the top sliver of video_view where the gallery used to be.           lv.setOnItemClickListener(new OnItemClickListener() {
            public void onItemClick(AdapterView<?> parent, View view,
                int position, long id) {
                if (position==1) { //video gallery list item has been pressed
                    vvLive.stopPlayback();
                    linearLayoutLiveVideo.setVisibility(GONE);
                    linearLayoutVideoGallery.setVisibility(VISIBLE);

@TITLE:Communication between two different applications
@CONTENT:We have two applications running on single machine,one of which is web application that responses every request by reading xml document(s).We wish to add the case that when the new xml file is created or existing file has replaced,application must not read file until its all changed and by the time the case happens,it must respond with old file. Since web applications works for request/respond cycle,we decided that this cycle shouldn't be interfered knowing that time between file changing and request time is obscured in live-running system,we must split file reading process.For that purpose,we use FileSystemWatcher in local machine with windows or console application(or some other says use WCF instead). Now that we come to question in above case,saying how can we communicate these two (or more) applications?

In other words, client-side I want to work as if using subversion, regardless of what the TFS server might think. This must be possible, I just wonder if it is easy to setup. In yet other words, until and unless I say 'checkin', other users shouldn't (be able to) bother what files I'm editing.

@TITLE:How do I keep a touch event keep its focus on the widget it was started in?
@CONTENT:Let's say I have a ListView, and one row in it is a custom View of mine. The user touches inside the custom view -> custom View gets to handle this touch event. User continues this touch sequence inside the are of the custom View -> custom View gets to handle those events too. Problem: When the user drags his/her finger outside the area of the custom View (the drag started inside), the custom View losts the touch events. But I need those events too, how can I achieve this? I know that this can be done: if you put a Gallery containing a bunch of images inside a LisView, and I start to drag the Gallery left-right, and drag my finger outside the area of the Gallery while doing so (moving up/downwards too much), I still control the Gallery scrolling, not the ListView. I hope that I was clear enough, does anyone have some tips on this problem?

@TITLE:Joining a list of python objects with __str__ method
@CONTENT:I've already looked at this question on representing strings in Python but my question is slightly different. Here's the code: >>> class WeirdThing(object):
...     def __init__(self):
...         self.me = time.time()
...     def __str__(self):
...         return "%s" % self.me
...     def __repr__(self):
...         return ";%s;" % self.me
... 
>>> weird_list = [WeirdThing(), WeirdThing(), WeirdThing()]
>>> print weird_list
[;1302217717.89;, ;1302217717.89;, ;1302217717.89;]
>>> "\n".join(weird_list)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<console>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: sequence item 0: expected string, WeirdThing found
 I realize that this works: >>> "\n".join(str(wi) for wi in weird_list)
'1302217717.89\n1302217717.89\n1302217717.89'

 Still it would be nice to avoid doing that every time I want to join the objects together. Is it simply not possible?

@TITLE:How to load different Event source (json) for each View?
@CONTENT:Hi i have a calendar which must load a different JSON source of events for each view. ie, A brief source for "Month" (only a max of 3 items per day cell), then more detailed sources of data for both "Day" and "Week". I was thinking i could capture when a view has loaded and based on which view, call removeEventSource() to remove the previous event source then addEventSource() to add the current view's related data and refresh. Is this the only way to do something like this? If so... how do i detect that the view has finished loading so i can call getView() to inturn load the appropriate event source? I've seen there is loading() callback but i don't think this is what i need, i want to know when the whole calendar is complete loading not just the current data. Thanks for any help EDIT: The only other way I can think to do this is remove the DAY/WEEK/MONTH fullcalendar buttons and replace with my own which reloads the php screen with a variable appended say &calLoad=month or &calLoad=day i can then load with a different json feed but this is obviously a less optimal way of doing things.

@TITLE:How do I create the view for the has_one association?
@CONTENT:So, imagine I have this model: class Car
  has_one :engine
end
 and the engine model: class Engine
  belongs_to :car
end
 When I present the form for the user, so that he can create a new car, I only want to allow him to select from one of the available engines ( the available engines will be in a select, populated by the collection_select ). The thing is, if I build the field like this: <%= f.collection_select :engine,Engine.all,:id,:name %>
 When I will try to save it, I will get an AssociationTypeMismatch saying that it expected an Engine, but it received a string. Is this the way to do it? def create
  car = Car.new(params[:car])
  engine = Engine.find(params[:engine])
  car.engine = engine
  if car.save
     # redirect somewhere
  else
     # do something with the errors
  end
end
 I always felt that stuff, like associating an engine to a car, are done automatically by Rails, but I don't know how to make him do it. Is switching the has_one and belongs_to associations the only way to achieve this? I am lost and I feel like I'm missing something very basic here.
@CODE:class Car
  has_one :engine
end class Engine
  belongs_to :car
end select collection_select <%= f.collection_select :engine,Engine.all,:id,:name %> def create
  car = Car.new(params[:car])
  engine = Engine.find(params[:engine])

These ads will be served by known adservers like doubleclick, smartadserver, eyewonder, etc. Thanks to some questions on Stack Overflow, I've discovered that they are some ways to break the ads out of the <iframe>s or even to dynamically resize the <iframe>s. I've found <iframe> buster files from the main ad serving company on the Internet, but I don't really get how they work. I know that I have to create a HTML file which I'll be giving along with my ad tag to the publisher, and they'll need to put it under their domain. But I don't understand how that file works. How do I interact with it from my JS?

@LINK:/questions/5536795/simplecursoradapter-not-working
@TITLE:simplecursoradapter not working
@CONTENT:I am using a database, getting a cursor out of it and then using a simplecursoradapter to populate a listview. I can't seem to figure out why the app crashes on creating a new simplecursoradapter. My cursor is contained in a singleton object. I have a reference to it through the data variable in this class.     String[] columns = new String[] {"item", "quantity", "days"};
    int[] to = new int[] { R.id.nametext, R.id.quantitytext, R.id.dayslefttext};

    SimpleCursorAdapter sCA = new SimpleCursorAdapter(this, R.layout.itemrow, data.listCursor, columns, to);

    listView1.setAdapter(sCA);
 What does the simplecursoradapter do with the information passed to it in its constructor? Is one of the parameters in the wrong format? Here is the simple xml file for each row that I am using to just see if this works:     <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<LinearLayout
  xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
  android:layout_width="fill_parent"
  android:layout_height="wrap_content">
  <TextView  
    android:layout_width="fill_parent" 
    android:layout_height="wrap_content" 
    android:text="Loading Screen"
    android:id="@+id/nametext"
    />
    <TextView  
    android:layout_width="fill_parent"

    android:layout_height="wrap_content" 
    android:text="Loading Screen"
    android:id="@+id/dayslefttext"
    />
</LinearLayout>
 Here is how I load the cursors: listCursor = myDataBase.query(ITEMS_TABLE, null, "location" +" = ?", new String[]{IN_SPECIAL_LIST}, null, null, "item");
 I can't figure out what the problems is. I ran this through some debugging and the problem occurs when I I create the new simplecursoradapter. Thanks!
@CODE:String[] columns = new String[] {"item", "quantity", "days"};
    int[] to = new int[] { R.id.nametext, R.id.quantitytext, R.id.dayslefttext};

@CONTENT:I want to read a log file in different chunks to make it multi threaded. The application is going to run in a serverside environment with multiple hard disks. After reading into chunks the app is going to process line per line of every chunk. I've accomplished the reading of every file line line with a bufferedreader and I can make chunks of my file with RandomAccessFile in combination with MappedByteBuffer, but combining these two isn't easy. The problem is that the chunk is just cutting into the last line of my chunk. I never have the whole last line of my block so processing this last log-line is impossible. I'm trying to find a way to cut my file into variable-length chunks respecting the end of the lines. Does anyone have a code for doing this?

@TITLE:Ruby on Rails: Why does the user's encrypted password get changed in the DB when I use the toggle method on the admin attribute?
@CONTENT:I just finished Hartl's Rails Tutorial book and I'm using his account authentication logic in my first rails app. However, when I make a new user account and set it as an admin account by toggling the admin attribute in the console (e.g. User.find(5).toggle!(:admin)), the encrypted password that is stored in the DB gets modified. Why? Here's the user model logic... class User < ActiveRecord::Base

  #virtual attributes
  attr_accessor :password           

  #attrs modifiable by the outside world
  attr_accessible :name, :email, :password, :password_confirmation    

  email_regex = /\A[\w+\-.]+@[a-z\d\-.]+\.[a-z]+\z/i

  #validations
  validates :name,  :presence => true,
                    :length   => { :maximum => 50 }
  validates :email, :presence => true,
                    :format   => { :with => email_regex },
                    :uniqueness => true

                        :length       => { :within => 6..40 }

  #class method that authenticates a user, used to create a session cookie
  def self.authenticate(email, submitted_password)
    user = find_by_email(email)
    return nil if user.nil?
    return user if user.has_password?(submitted_password)
  end

  #used to authenticate a signed user from a signed cookie 
  def self.authenticate_with_salt(id, cookie_salt)
    user = find_by_id(id)
    return nil if user.nil?
    return user if user.salt == cookie_salt
  end

  #callback that occurs before a record is successfully saved (meaning it has a valud password)                      
  before_save :encrypt_password

  def has_password?(submitted_password)
    encrypted_password == encrypt(submitted_password)
  end

  private

    #self keyword is required when assigning to a instance attribute
    def encrypt_password
      self.salt = make_salt if new_record?
      self.encrypted_password = encrypt(password)
    end

    def encrypt(string)
      secure_hash("#{salt}--#{string}")
    end

    def make_salt
      secure_hash("#{Time.now.utc}--#{password}")      
    end

    def secure_hash(string)
      Digest::SHA2.hexdigest(string)
    end
end
 and here's what the behavior looks like... ruby-1.9.2-p180 :018 > User.last

@LINK:/questions/5454521/accessing-data-for-validation-and-determining-default-values-using-ddd
@TITLE:Accessing data for validation and determining default values using DDD
@CONTENT:Lets take a hypothetical project such as a student enrollment system for a music school. Within the system there needs to exist a way to enter student data for a new student interested in receiving instruction at this school and we can assume that students may have access to this functionality through a web site. Part of the enrollment process asks the student the type of instrument for which she would like to receive instruction. As a result of entering information about her preferred musical instrument the behavior will be to assign a default instructor who is assigned to that group of instruments. Before completing the enrollment request the student will be also be able to change the assigned instructor to different instructor who also is listed as able to give instructed for her selected instrument. Given this description, the part I'm having a little trouble with is how manage the list of possible instructors out of the ones who are able to give instruction for particular instrument in terms of choosing a default instructor for a new student first, and secondly how to use this same data when it comes time to validate the selected instructor before an enrollment is submitted. Other technical constraints are that up to this point I've been using a self validating technique very similar to the one presented in Jimmy Nilsson's book Applying Domain-Driven Design and Patterns so it is mainly unclear to me the best way to go about continuing following self validating techniques when access to external data is necessary which I would normally see as outside of the scope of the entity being tested for validity. The options I'm aware of: Move validation outside of the entity itself. Perhaps validation is moved into a set of services or a single service per entity which analyses current state of the whole entity and deems it valid or not and provides for domain events or other value objects to be emitted that give more insight about what validation rules have been broken. In this case I'm still a bit uneasy about how the service would get access to the necessary information about instructors Allow for access to a instructor repository from necessary entities that are attempting to perform this validation. Create a service that allows access to a list of instructors by instrument category. Alternatively create two separate services, one that returns whether a given instructor is in the list of instructors for a given category, and another which returns the default instructor for a given category. Load a list of instructor value objects within my aggregate root (likely student, or a student enrollment request) that can be used for validation either by the aggregate root or entities contained within the root. In either of the first two cases above it seems like the use of a instructor repository would be overkill because I don't need to access an aggregate root that represents an instructor but instead in my case I would see the instructor as a value object that describes the student enrollment request and having a repository spit back value objects seems to be blurring the lines of what a repository is supposed to be doing. For the last two options it seems wrong two allow access to data from a service or a factory in the case of option 4 since aren't repositories supposed to be in charge of data access such as this? And if repositories are the right place for this logic where are the appropriate places to access or store references to repositories? I've been convinced that there are reasons not to access repositories directly within any entity or value object that makes up the model so I'm wondering if this is a case where I may have to bend on that assumption. I should also mention that I'm pretty new to DDD and I'm just now encountering some of my head scratching moments and attempting not to box myself in so any knowledgeable input on this topic would be valuable.

@TITLE:Memory allocator in C X how to utilize sbrk()'ed space
@CONTENT:I've been writing an implementation of malloc and was wondering if someone could help me with this problem. Basically, I would like to reuse memory after allocating it using sbrk(), and having made certain that the memory is free. So essentially, imagine my memory is like this |------------------------------|
 ...and I do some allocations. When I allocate memory, each bit has a head (h) and data (d). |hddddddhddd---hdd--hddd-------|
 Now I've got these holes, and if I want to use say, the first gap in my diagram, how do I set it up so that it's got a head (h) and a body (dd) also? I've gotten to the point where now I've got a pointer to the memory location I want. In C, its pointed to by a pointer. The pointer has a custom type, where "meta" is a struct I defined. So now I have metaStruct * mypointer = the memory address.
 But when I try to do mypointer->size = 30;
 Or mypointer->buddy = 1;
 I get a segfault. The question: how do I set it up so that the memory address, which has been allocated via sbrk(), will have the form of my struct? Obviously I can't just go myPointer = malloc(sizeof(metaStruct)), because I am writing malloc itself. I'm also not interested in sbrk()'ing more space, but rather, utilizing the existing space that I'm pointing to (I want to disregard its junk data and use the space). How do I go about doing that?

@TITLE:How to handle rotation for a UIViewController that isnt on top of UINavigationController stack?
@CONTENT:I have a root UIViewController (VC1), inside a UINavigationController, which handles rotation by adjusting its views/subviews frames manually in the willRotateToInterfaceOrientation: method. The rotation works fine if the root UIViewController is the active view controller, basically on top of the stack. The problem occurs when i push another UIViewController (VC2) onto the NavigationController. I then rotate VC2 which works fine. However when i pop VC2 the problem is that VC1 has not rotated to the correct orientation, nor does its willRotateToInterfaceOrientation: method get called?? The shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation: method in VC1 is called but thats it. My question then is how am i supposed to make sure that my UIViewController VC1 has been updated for the current orientation for this type of situation??

@TITLE:Help me understand CMTime in AVAssetWriter
@CONTENT:I'm having a hard time understanding how to convert a stream of motion JPEG at 30fps using the AVAssetWriter to a video file. The part I'm not getting is the [adaptor appendPixelBuffer:buffer withPresentationTimeresentTime] method. How do I calculate the withPresentationTime value if I want to output 30fps mpeg4 video? The video source is a camera that streams 30fps motion JPEG in real time. Appreciate any idea. Thanks

@TITLE:How to implement IDropTarget in an CSharp Application and register it for file types?
@CONTENT:I'm implementing a small tool in C# which works on files. Because I'm lazy I want to register my tool on the file types in the registry to be able to simply open all my files from the explorer. Currently I am using HCR\MyFile\shell\open\command to specify the calling command line to my program with "%1" for the current file. This works fine for single files, but oviously not when selecting multiple files. I found out that my application should implement IDropTraget to get multiple files, but I don't know how to do this. How to my CSharp "application" implement IDropTraget? How to I then register my application in the windows registry for the file types correctly to get it called? I am relatively new to the whole COM stuff. I "used" it several times now, but I never wrote a COM-class by my own. Is there an example or tutorial? (I searched, but found nothing, at least I recognized nothing in this direction) Thanks!

@CONTENT:I have a wierd problem. I developed a site that works fine in most browsers. I just upgraded to IE9 and none of my styles are being applied. I'm viewing this on my local pc as this site is not on the internet just yet. All in-line or page level styles get applied correctly but the styles linked from external css files in the HEAD section aren't applied at all. If I use the developer toolbar and view the site as IE8, IE7, or any other mode the sites work fine. There's about 6 style sheets and no extra components so it shouldn't be an issue of too many style sheets. I can't figure what is causing this. Anybody else seen this?

For example, it is mentioned in topics of correctly initializing/finalizing. However, when I google managed types, it seems most links are related to C++, or .NET. For example, see the MSDN page. Could some one help to comment what are managed types defined in Delphi? Given that Delphi for POSIX/MacOS is being born, are managed types specific to Windows? Thanks for your effort and time in advance! PS: Topics of correctly initializing/finalizing: Which variables are initialized when in Delphi? Are delphi variables initialized with a value by default? How should I free an array of objects in a Delphi 7 destructor? In Delphi 2009 do I need to free variant arrays?

@LINK:/questions/5328858/json-stringify-fails-on-scripting-dictionary-objects
@TITLE:JSON.Stringify fails on Scripting.Dictionary objects
@CONTENT:I am working on an ASP classic project where I have implemented the JScript JSON class found here. It is able to interop with both VBScript and JScript and is almost exactly the code provided at json.org. I am required to use VBScript for this project by the manager of my team. It works very well on primitives and classes defined within ASP. But I have need for Dictionary objects which from my knowledge are only available through COM interop. (via Server.CreateObject("Scripting.Dictionary")) I have the following class which represents a product: (ProductInfo.class.asp) <%
Class ProductInfo

    Public ID
    Public Category
    Public PriceUS
    Public PriceCA
    Public Name
    Public SKU
    Public Overview
    Public Features
    Public Specs

End Class
%>
 The Specs property is a Dictionary of key:value pairs. Here's how I'm serializing it: (product.asp) <%
dim oProd
set oProd = new ProductInfo
' ... fill in properties
' ... output appropriate headers and stuff
Response.write( JSON.stringify( oProd ) )
%>
 When I pass an instance of ProductInfo to JSON.Stringify (as seen above) I get something like the following: {
    "id": "1547",
    "Category": {
        "id": 101,
        "Name": "Category Name",
        "AlternateName": "",
        "URL": "/category_name/",
        "ParentCategoryID": 21
    },
    "PriceUS": 9.99,
    "PriceCA": 11.99,
    "Name": "Product Name",
    "SKU": 3454536,
    "Overview": "Lorem Ipsum dolor sit amet..",
    "Features": "Lorem Ipsum dolor sit amet..",
    "Specs": {}
}
 As you can see, the Specs property is an empty object. I believe that the JSON stringify method knows that the Specs property is an object, so it appends the {} to the JSON string around the stringified output. Which in this case is an empty string. What I expect it to show, however is not an empty object. See below: "Specs": {
    "foo":"bar",
    "baz":1,
    "etc":"..."
}
 I believe the problem area of the JSON library is here: (json2.asp) // Otherwise, iterate through all of the keys in the object.

for (k in value) {
    if (Object.hasOwnProperty.call(value, k)) {
        v = str(k, value);
        if (v) {
            partial.push(quote(k) + (gap ? ': ' : ':') + v);
        }
    }
}
 I postulate that the problem with the above code is that it assumes that all objects inherit from the Object class. (The one that provides hasOwnProperty) However I think that it's likely that COM objects don't inherit from the Object class X or at least the same Object class. Or at least don't implement whatever interface is required to do for ... in on them. Update: While I feel it is irrelevant for the question to be answered X I expect some sort of web client to request (via http) the JSON representation of this object or a collection of this object. tl;dr The question: What should I do to make it so that the Scripting.Dictionary can be output properly as JSON instead of failing and returning just an empty string? Do I need to 'reinvent the wheel' and write my own Dictionary class in VBScript that does act as a normal object in ASP?

 In general code follows this post and I actually do not see what is wrong neither how to fix it. And it follows way how we would pass accepted TCP connection from one process to another (described here) May be this "Socket inheritance on different Windows platforms" example could help but I do not see how. Can any one please help me to find any possible workaround that problem? Update: Just tested code on Linux - works perfectly, no errors. So what is it with windows version?
@CODE:#include <iostream>
#include <boost/asio.hpp>

#ifdef _WIN32
#include "Windows.h"
#endif

using namespace boost::asio::ip;
using namespace std;

int main(){
int m_nPort = 12345;
boost::asio::io_service io_service;
tcp::acceptor acceptor(io_service, tcp::endpoint(tcp::v4(), m_nPort));

cout << "Waiting for connection..." << endl;

tcp::socket socket(io_service);
acceptor.accept(socket);
cout << "connection accepted" << endl;

#ifdef _WIN32

@TITLE:Spring-Returning json with @ResponseBody when the Accept header is */* throws HttpMediaTypeNotAcceptableException
@CONTENT:I'm using spring 3.0.0. I have an endpoint that returns an object that I want to be serialized to JSON. When the request comes in with Accept: application/json, it works correctly. The request is currently coming in with */* as the Accept value. Unfortunately I don't have control over the request, otherwise I would change that. When */* is received, it throws a HttpMediaTypeNotAcceptableException exception. Is there a way to map this accept pattern to application/json? This is very similar to another question, but the key difference is I need to have the Accept header be */*. Spring's Json not being resolved with appropriate response Here's what my controller looks like: @RequestMapping(value = "/v1/endpoint", method = RequestMethod.POST)
@ResponseBody
public EndpointResponse runEndpoint(@RequestBody String jsonData) {

    ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
    EndpointRequest opRequest = null;
    EndpointResponse opResponse = null;

    try {

        opRequest = mapper.readValue(jsonData, EndpointRequest.class);

        //....do stuff



    } catch (JsonParseException e) {
        return handleException(opResponse, e);

 and SELECTION being: public static final String SELECTION = Data.RAW_CONTACT_ID + "=?"; The rawcontactId does return values, I've made logs to check. To give it some context I'm working with Account sync. The goal here is for it to find the data columns for existing contacts and writing over them with any new data. I'm working from the following sample code provided by android: http://developer.android.com/resources/samples/SampleSyncAdapter/src/com/example/android/samplesync/platform/ContactManager.html To summarize my problem, I have two contacts via this synced account which are added without any problems, but are not being able to be updated. Anyone have experience with this? Thanks. EDIT: Here is my rawContact returning method private static long lookupRawContact(ContentResolver resolver, String username) {
    Log.e("Looking up Raw Contact", username);
    long authorId = 0;
    Cursor cursor = resolver.query(

    public static final String SELECTION = RawContacts.ACCOUNT_TYPE + "='" +

 And here is my constructor for a ContactSyncOperations class being used to add a new contact. The source id here is a username, the same as I call in my SELECTION argument. public ContactSyncOperations(Context context, String username,
        String accountName, BatchOperationForSync batchOperation) {

@LINK:/questions/5284452/headphones-unplugged-during-playback-cause-bug-on-iphone-app
@TITLE:Headphones unplugged during playback cause bug on iPhone app
@CONTENT:I am creating an application based on the Speak Here example app. I want the audio to play through the headphones if they are plugged in or otherwise default to the speakers. I've used the bottom bit of code to make this happen and it works fine unless the headphones are unplugged during playback. At that point the playback ends, which is okay. The problem is when I hit play again the playback comes out all weird and the stop button stops working. It also starts playback from where it left off rather then resetting from the beginning as it normally does when you hit the stop button. Likewise if the headphones are plugged in before the app opens this also results in strange behaviour. Maybe I need to grab the 'headphones unplugged' event and get it to 'press the stop button'? Because the way it is doing it now is not correct. To put my question in a simple form: How do you properly setup core audio on the iPhone for playback through the speakers and headphones. Any pieces of code that could solve this problem would be of great help. Thanks!  OSStatus error = AudioSessionInitialize(NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);

@TITLE:How can I get NSScrollView to respect a clipping path
@CONTENT:I am trying to make a NSScrollView with clipped corners, similar to the Twitter app: I have a NSScrollView subclass which I added the following code: - (void)drawRect:(NSRect)dirtyRect {
    NSBezierPath *pcath = [NSBezierPath bezierPathWithRoundedRect:[self bounds] xRadius:kDefaultCornerRadius yRadius:kDefaultCornerRadius];
    [path setClip];

    [super drawRect:dirtyRect];
}
 I expected the content of the NSScrollView to have rounded corners, but it is not respecting the clipped path. How can I do this? UPDATE & CLARIFICATION I know how to make a custom NSScroller, I know how to make it transparent overlay. All I am asking is how to make the NSSCrollView clip its corners, including everything it contains. The NSScrollView is inside a NSView which has a background that could change, meaning a view overlay to fake the rounded corners is not an option.
@CODE:NSScrollView - (void)drawRect:(NSRect)dirtyRect {
    NSBezierPath *pcath = [NSBezierPath bezierPathWithRoundedRect:[self bounds] xRadius:kDefaultCornerRadius yRadius:kDefaultCornerRadius];
    [path setClip];

@TITLE:FlashDevelop: recommended way for loading/playing sound files
@CONTENT:I'm not sure if this is a FlashDevelop or a general ActionScript3 question, however, I am trying to figure out the best way to add sound files to my flashdevelop project. For example, I've found that if I place .mp3 files within the my project's bin folder I can load/play them with the following lines of code var sndreq:URLRequest = new URLRequest("foo.mp3");
var sound:Sound = new Sound();
sound.load(sndreq);
sound.play();
 It seems like kindof a pain to move all my sound files to my project's bin directory (but if that's what it takes so be it). I see that there's an "add to library" option when I right click on my media files, but I'm not sure what the effect of that is (I was hoping that meant it would be automatically copied to the project's bin directory, but no such luck). So, my question is: supposing I only have flashdevelop and not Flash CS3/4, is this the recommended way for loading local sound files?

var sound:Sound = new Sound();
sound.load(sndreq);

@TITLE:Converting truecolor RGB image to indexed colors
@CONTENT:I want to convert a 24bit RGB image (8 bit for each channel) 8 bit using an indexed color palette. My initial idea was to create an array and simply count the amount of times each color was represented in the image, but I figured it would be wasteful if there were large areas with slight change in color that used up all of the palette space in favor of smaller, but maybe more significant color groups. Once I complete building the palette, my idea was to consider each RGB color as a 3-dimensional matrix and compare its dot product with each entry in the palette. ... As you might see, I'm not completely in on the terminology, but I hope you get what I mean :) My question is; Is anyone able to share insights on how to approach this or perhaps put me in the right direction to any reading material online? thanks!

@CONTENT:We are taking a hit the first time some heavy UI screens are loaded. our project is divided into one main executable and several DLL files. The DLL files can also contain UI screens which are slow the first time they are loaded. Is there a way (in code) we can pre Load all the referenced assemblies so as to avoid the JIT compilation hit? I know there is a tool called NGEN. Is it possible to operate NGEN in a development environment so we can see its effects instantly. Ideally though, we would like to pre Load the referenced assemblies from code. Using C# .NET 3.5 along with DevExpress for our UI components.

@TITLE:Output bash script into file (without >> )
@CONTENT:Perhaps this is very simple thing, but yet I dont know it. I have a job specified in cron, which calls a script once in a while. something like that: 1 1 * * * bash script.sh Now, when script launched it reads configuration and realises that all output needs to be appended to log file. The simple solution would be to update cron task like 1 1 * * * bash script.sh >> log But let assume that name and location of the file is not known at this stage. So I came up with the solution which works, but I dont like it a lot. Code at the top of the script: source config.sh N=$#
LAST_ARG=${!N}
if [ "$LAST_ARG" != "log" ]
then
  bash \`basename $0\` \`echo $@ log\` >>  "$LogFile"
  exit

 I recursively launching the same script, with additional argument, and direction to log file. Then Parent instance just getting closed. Sure there has to be a better way to do it ? Thanks

 Which effectively 'orphans' the text 'The relationships between...' outside of its <p> markup, losing its styling and semantic meaning... at least to the human viewer of the website page. Moving the <figure> outside of the <p> seems to have more predictable results, i.e.: <figure>

 But we kinda lose the 'textwrap' effect when the <figure> is text-aligned left or right. Is this proper use of <figure> (the former example)? Is the fault with the browser? (Safari/Firefox & Chrome all produce slightly different, unexpected interpretations)? What 'should' the proper markup be?

@TITLE:iPad large NSArray - initWithObjects vs. ArrayWithObjects
@CONTENT:can anyone clear this up for me ? I am building an iPad App that has a TableViewController that is supposed to show something between 1000 and 2000 strings. I have those NSStrings in a Singleton. In the init Method of the Singleton I initialize an Array that holds all the data ( does not have to be the final way to do it - was just a quick copy and paste for testing ) I did an self.someArray = [[NSArray alloc]initWithObjects: followed by the large number of strings, followed by nil. that worked fine in the simulator - but crashed with bad access on the iPad right on Application startup If I use the convenience method [NSArray arrayWithObjects:instead - it works fine. I looked into Instruments and the overall memory footprint of the App is just about 2,5 MB. Now I don't know why it works the one way but not the other. EDIT: #import "StaticValueContainer.h"`

static StaticValueContainer* instance = nil;
@implementation StaticValueContainer
@synthesize customerRatingKeys;

+(StaticValueContainer*)sharedInstance
{
    if (instance == nil){
        instance = [[StaticValueContainer alloc]init];
