@TITLE:Copy Constructor Needed with temp object
@CONTENT:The following code only works when the copy constructor is available. When I add print statements (via std::cout) and make the copy constructor available it is not used (I assume there is so compiler trick happening to remove the unnecessary copy). But in both the output operator << and the function plop() below (where I create a temporary object) I don't see the need for the copy constructor. Can somebody explain why the language needs it when I am passing everything by const reference (or what I am doing wrong). #include <iostream>

class N
{
    public:
        N(int)  {}
    private:
        N(N const&);
};

std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& str,N const& data)
{
    return str << "N\n";
}

void plop(std::ostream& str,N const& data)
{
    str << "N\n";
}

int main()
{
    std::cout << N(1);     // Needs copy constructor  (line 25)
    plop(std::cout,N(1));  // Needs copy constructor

    N    a(5);
    std::cout << a;
    plop(std::cout,a);
}

@TITLE:Discover subclasses of a given class in Obj-C
@CONTENT:Is there any way to discover at runtime which subclasses exist of a given class? Edit: From the answers so far I think I need to clarify a bit more what I am trying to do. I am aware that this is not a common practice in Cocoa, and that it may come with some caveats. I am writing a parser using the dynamic creation pattern. (See the book Cocoa Design Patterns by Buck and Yacktman, chapter 5.) Basically, the parser instance processes a stack, and instantiates objects that know how to perform certain calculations. If I can get all the subclasses of the MYCommand class, I can, for example, provide the user with a list of available commands. Also, in the example from chapter 5, the parser has an substitution dictionary so operators like +, -, * and / can be used. (They are mapped to MYAddCommand, etc.) To me it seemed this information belonged in the MyCommand subclass, not the parser instance as it kinda defeats the idea of dynamic creation.

@LINK:/questions/1589950/initializer-list-argument-evaluation-order
@TITLE:Initializer list *argument* evaluation order
@CONTENT:So, the C++ standard requires that class members be initialized in the order in which they are declared in the class, rather than the order that they're mentioned in any constructor's initializer list. However, this doesn't imply anything about the order in which the arguments to those initializations are evaluated. I'm working with a system that frequently passes references to serialization objects around, and wondering if I can ensure that bits are read from it in the right order, independent of the order in which those bits get written into the object's fields. struct Foo {
    int a;
    double b;
    // I want to be able to do this
    Foo(SerObj &s)
    : b(s.readDouble()), a(s.readInt())
    { }
    // Rather than this
    Foo (SerObj &s)
    {
        b = s.readDouble();
        a = s.readInt();
    }
};
 Obviously, reordering things like ints and doubles in the declaration is not too big a deal, but bigger objects and things requiring dynamic allocation sometimes can be.
@CODE:struct Foo {
    int a;
    double b;
    // I want to be able to do this
    Foo(SerObj &s)
    : b(s.readDouble()), a(s.readInt())

@TITLE:CPU Architecture Independent P/Invoke: Can the DllName or path be ：dynamic；?
@CONTENT:Is there a way to have the particular DLL referenced by a P/Invoke (DllImport) signature depend on the CPU architecture? I'm working on an application that loads a large number of method signatures from a native dll from a third party vendor, in this case the user-space interface DLL to a piece of hardware. That vendor has now started supplying both x86 and x64 versions of the DLL now, and I think my app would benefit from running as a 64bit process. Except for this one DLL, everything is .NET code, so building as "Any CPU" would work. All of the method signatures in the native DLL are the same on 64bit, however name of the DLL is different (Foo.dll vs. Foo_x64.dll). Is there any way through either the P/Invoke signatures or app.config entries I can get it to pick which DLL to load based on the running CPU architecture? If instead of different DLL names it was the same name in different folders, does that open any other options? NB: Because it is essential that the version of this user-space DLL match the installed kernel driver for the hardware, the DLL is not bundled with our app, but instead we depend on the vendor installer to place it in a directory in the %PATH%.

@TITLE:Java - where and how should exceptions be used?
@CONTENT:I was reading some things about exception handling in Java, to be able to write better code. OK, I admit, I am guilty; I've used too much try-catch{} blocks, I've used ex.printStackTrace() in the catch, not even using a proper logger (actually the System.out and System.err were redirected to a PrintWriter, so a log was generated). However, after a few hours of readings, I find myself in a strange place: the unknown. If the exceptions are designed to pass info about abnormal states of flow, how does one know WHERE is the proper level to do something with that info? For instance, when a database error occurs, should one return a null value or an error code, or throw the exception? If thrown, WHERE should that exception be handled? I understand that is no use even to log an exception if you cant do anything about it. However, in GUI apps, that could easily kill your GUI (I am using SWT and I've seen this too often), even for the case of the menuShown() method (an ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception will close the app, if not handled). The example could go on forever, but here's the summary of questions: Does using try-catch() excessively have a negative impact on performance? Is it better to use specific exception types? What if I missed catching one of the possible X types of exceptions that could occur? Frankly, I've heard of and use a mere 10% I think of the Java standard exceptions, in 2-3 years. Yes, someone said that if the caller don't know how to deal with the thrown exceptions, he SHOULD NOT HAVE THE RIGHT to call the throwing method. Is that right? I've read this article of Anders Hejlsberg, saying that checked exceptions are bad. Should that indicate that convenient exception swallowing is advised in some cases? A picture is worth 1000 words; I guess some examples will help a lot here. I know the subject is eternal, but actually I am looking forward to review a middle-size project of 150 classes, using your advice. Many thanks.

@TITLE:ASP.NET, jQuery, dirty forms, and window.onbeforeunload
@CONTENT:In my ASP.NET web app, I'm trying to create a universal way of warning users before navigating away from a form when they've made changes, using jQuery. Pretty standard stuff, but after a lot of searching I have yet to find a technique that works. Here's what I have at this point:     addToPostBack = function(func) {
        var old__doPostBack = __doPostBack;
        if (typeof __doPostBack != 'function') {
            __doPostBack = func;
        } else {
            __doPostBack = function() {
                old__doPostBack();
                func();
            }
        }
    }

    var isDirty = false;

    $(document).ready(function() {
        addToPostBack(function() {
            alert("Postback detected.")
            clearDirty();
        });
        $(':input').bind("change select keydown", setDirty);
        window.onbeforeunload = function(e) {
            var msg = "You have unsaved changes. "
            if (isDirty == true) {
                var e = e || window.event;
                if (e) { e.returnValue = msg; }
                return msg;
            }
        };
    });

    setDirty = function() {isDirty = true;}

    clearDirty = function() {isDirty = false;}
 This works as far as warning the user from navigating away. The problem is that I get the warning on every same-page postback. There are a number of things on my forms that might trigger a postback: There are Save, Cancel, and Delete linkbuttons on the page There might be other linkbuttons on the page that execute server-side functionality while staying on the same page There might be other controls with autopostback=true that also have server-side functions attached to them, but which don't result in the user leaving the page. None of these things should provoke a warning, because the user isn't leaving the page. My code tries to hijack addToPostBack (more details on that in this question) to clear the isDirty bit before posting back, but the problem is that in IE onbeforeunload fires before __doPostBack, apparently because IE fires onbeforeunload immediately when a link is clicked (as described here). Of course, I could wire up each of these controls to clear the isDirty bit, but I'd prefer a solution that operates on the form level and that doesn't require that I touch every single control that might trigger a postback. Does anyone have an approach that works in ASP.NET and that doesn't involve wiring up every control that might cause a postback?
@CODE:addToPostBack = function(func) {
        var old__doPostBack = __doPostBack;
        if (typeof __doPostBack != 'function') {
            __doPostBack = func;
        } else {
            __doPostBack = function() {
                old__doPostBack();
                func();
            }
        }
    }

    var isDirty = false;

    $(document).ready(function() {
        addToPostBack(function() {
            alert("Postback detected.")
            clearDirty();
        });
        $(':input').bind("change select keydown", setDirty);
        window.onbeforeunload = function(e) {
            var msg = "You have unsaved changes. "
            if (isDirty == true) {
                var e = e || window.event;
                if (e) { e.returnValue = msg; }
                return msg;
            }
        };
    });

    setDirty = function() {isDirty = true;}

@TITLE:：Cannot load package A, it contains unit X, which is also contained in package B；
@CONTENT:(More package/component install fun for me -- thanks everyone for all your help to date). I am getting the error listed as the title, in Delphi 2007. Package A is my package of frame-based "viewer panels." Package B is a package containing a couple of components that are used to show information about datasets linked to a gven database (their SQL, state, class type, etc), one of which is a non-visual component (we'll call it the Inspector) which creates and calls a form showing that information. Unit X is the unit of that form. I added the Inspector component to one of my viewer panels in Package, but have since deleted it, and cannot find any reference to it in View Source for the project, nor in the unit of the frame-based viewer panel I added it to. Where is the reference hiding? Also, what would make adding that Inspector component to one of the view panel frames (which also get installed as registered components), cause this problem? This is likely related to this previous question and this one as well, but I decided to start fresh with this specific symtpom / issue, just to keep it succinct and clear, and hopefully thus useful to someone else later. Thanks in advance for any and all help. Update: Thanks to Loren, I was able to find and remove the USES reference that remained and was causing the problem. HOWEVER, I'm still not clear on how to accomplish what I'm trying to accomplish. : \ Here's the latest: The Inspector is a simple non-visual component which contains a DataSet property, and an internal "Info Form." Calling a ShowInfo method creates the form, and populates it with various information related to the linked DataSet. I'm wanting to used it to debug the SQL driving the viewers. As mentioned above, the Inspector is contained in Package B. The viewers are in Package A. I want to use the Inspector component on some of the TFrame descendents (which register as true palette components). When I drop that component on the given TFrame however to use it, and compile/install Package A, I get the "Cannot load package A, it contains unit X, which is also contained in package B" error. It's now clearly the cause, and I can re-create the problem on demand. moobaa's suggestion below makes sense, and yet it seems that even though I am trying to do approach #2 of what he suggest, it does not work. What am I missing? It seems like this should be doable, and in fact it seems like most packages I've seen use other installed packages all the time (included the VCL itself). Note: Package B does not depend on Package A, as far as I can tell (and I've installed it stand alone, so that seems to agree). (BTW, are there any tools to "chart out" package dependencies like this? I'm using D2007) As always, thanks for your time and help.

@LINK:/questions/1155208/when-and-where-to-set-a-custom-ioperationinvoker
@TITLE:When and where to set a custom IOperationInvoker?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to extend WCF so that I can have a RESTful web service, in which, for each operation, I perform a verification of the HTTP Authorization header, whose value I use to call a Login() method. After the login is done, I wish to invoke the operation's corresponding method checking if a security exception is thrown, in which case I'll reply with a custom "access denied" message" using the appropriate HTTP Status Code. With this in mind, I thought implementing a IEndpointBehavior that applies an implementaion of IOperationInvoker to each operation (setting the DispatchOperation.Invoker property) would be a good idea. I decided to implement an IOperationInvoker using the Decorator design pattern. My implementation would need another IOperationInvoker in it's constructor to which the method invocations would be delegated. This is my IOperationInvokerImplementation:     public class BookSmarTkOperationInvoker : IOperationInvoker{

    private readonly IOperationInvoker invoker;

    public BookSmarTkOperationInvoker(IOperationInvoker decoratee)
    {
        this.invoker = decoratee;
    }

    public object[] AllocateInputs()
    {
        return this.invoker.AllocateInputs();
    }

    public object Invoke(object instance, object[] inputs, out object[] outputs)
    {
        BeforeOperation(); // Where there's code to perform the login using WebOperationContext.Current
        object o = null;
        try
        {
            o = this.invoker.Invoke(instance, inputs, out outputs);
        }
        catch (Exception exception)
        {
            outputs = null;
            return AfterFailedOperation(exception); // Return a custom access denied response
        }

        return o;
    }

    public IAsyncResult InvokeBegin(object instance, object[] inputs, AsyncCallback callback, object state)
    {
        throw new Exception("The operation invoker is not asynchronous.");
    }

    public object InvokeEnd(object instance, out object[] outputs, IAsyncResult result)
    {
        throw new Exception("The operation invoker is not asynchronous.");
    }

    public bool IsSynchronous
    {
        get
        {
            return false;
        }
    }
}
 I decided to implement an IEndpointBehavior by extending the behavior I already needed (WebHttpBehavior) this way I only use one beavior. Here's the code I wrote: public class BookSmarTkEndpointBehavior : WebHttpBehavior
{
    public override void Validate(ServiceEndpoint endpoint)
    {
        base.Validate(endpoint);
    }

    public override void AddBindingParameters(ServiceEndpoint endpoint, BindingParameterCollection bindingParameters)
    {
        base.AddBindingParameters(endpoint, bindingParameters);
    }

    public override void ApplyDispatchBehavior(ServiceEndpoint endpoint, EndpointDispatcher endpointDispatcher)
    {
        base.ApplyDispatchBehavior(endpoint, endpointDispatcher);

        foreach (DispatchOperation operation in endpointDispatcher.DispatchRuntime.Operations)
        {
            IOperationInvoker defaultInvoker = operation.Invoker;
            IOperationInvoker decoratorInvoker = new BookSmarTkOperationInvoker(defaultInvoker);
            operation.Invoker = decoratorInvoker;

            Console.Write("Before: " + ((object)defaultInvoker ?? "null"));
            Console.WriteLine(" After: " + operation.Invoker);
        }
    }

    public override void ApplyClientBehavior(ServiceEndpoint endpoint, ClientRuntime clientRuntime)
    {
        base.ApplyClientBehavior(endpoint, clientRuntime);
        throw new Exception("The BookSmarTkEndointBehavior cannot be used in client endpoints.");
    }
}
 Now here's the problem: Only the constructor is being invoked in the IOperationInvoker, none of the other methods are. The decoratee IOperationInvoker (the one that's passed in the decorator's constructor) is null. I'm guessing that maybe some other code from some other behavior is setting another IOperationInvoker in the OperationDispatcher.Invoker setting afterwards. Thus, overriding mine. This would clearly explain my situation. What is happening and what should I do? My service is self-hosted. In case you need to see it, here is the configuration I have in the app.config file under system.serviceModel. <services>
  <service name="BookSmarTk.Web.Service.BookSmarTkService">

@CONTENT:Let's say the page TestPage.aspx has two controls. The first control is an address control that has a validation group called "AddressGroup". This group contains several validation controls which are colated in the validation summary on that control. The second control is a credit card control and has a validation group called "CreditCardGroup". It also has several validators and a summary to display the results. To add to the problem, there are some random controls on the page that also have validators which are tied to a third ValidatorSummary control.

End Sub
 When I run this same bit of code from my production solution, the IO.Directory.CreateDirectory() method is not throwing an exception, IO.Directory.Exists() returns True, and the directory does not actually get created on disk. Are there any project/solution settings that would make the behavior of IO.Directory.CreateDirectory() vary like this? Note: I am not running Visual Studio as an administrator in either case. EDIT: The production application is running on the same box as the test application. EDIT #2: The production application is using virtualization. I clicked on My Computer, navigated to C:\Windows, and clicked on "Compatibility Files" on the explorer toolbar and it brought me to C:\Users\myUser\AppData\Local\VirtualStore\Windows where my created directories were sitting. The only outstanding question is - why does the production application virtualize while the test console application throws an exception?? Answer: the console application, by default, was created with an app.manifest. The production application--which is a WPF application--did not have an app.manifest. Apparently Vista will use virtualization if there is no app.manifest present for the execuable. Thanks everyone!

@TITLE:adding child nodes in treeview
@CONTENT:I'm new to C# and don't have any programming experience. But I've finish a C# basics. Now I would like to design a simple tree view by adding parent node and child node. I would like to add a second child for the Second node, I'm quite stuck here and don't know what's next. Any ideas? Here is the code:     private void addParentNode_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        string yourParentNode;
        yourParentNode = textBox1.Text.Trim();
        treeView2.Nodes.Add(yourParentNode);
    }

    private void addChildNode_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        string yourChildNode;
        yourChildNode = textBox1.Text.Trim();
        treeView2.Nodes[0].Nodes.Add(yourChildNode);
    }
 Sorry I wasn't clear, I'm not sure if I really need this one here:   //treeView1.BeginUpdate(); 
  //treeView1.Nodes.Clear();
 What I'm trying to do, is to add Parent Nodes and child node. In my code, I can add several Parent Nodes, but if I want to add a child node, it only add in the first parent node. I want that if I add a child node, I want to add it to the second parent or third parent. In my code I only use one treeview here which names as treeview2 Here is the screenshot this is how my final code looks like: Before I put the else, I'm getting an error if I don't select anything. So I made it that way that if there is nothing selected it will add the "child node" to the "default node" or (parent1 node). It seems to work good. Thanks guys;-)     //This is for adding a parent node
    private void addParentNode_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        treeView2.BeginUpdate();

        string yourParentNode;
        yourParentNode = textBox1.Text.Trim();
        treeView2.Nodes.Add(yourParentNode);
        treeView2.EndUpdate();
    }

    //This is for adding child node
    private void addChildNode_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        if (treeView2.SelectedNode != null)
        {
            string yourChildNode;
            yourChildNode = textBox1.Text.Trim();

            treeView2.SelectedNode.Nodes.Add(yourChildNode);
            treeView2.ExpandAll();
        }
        //This is for adding the child node to the default node(parent 1 node)
        else
        {
            string yourChildNode;
            yourChildNode = textBox1.Text.Trim();
            treeView2.Nodes[0].Nodes.Add(yourChildNode);
        }
 Additional question: Are there any other ways on how the code be better? Because here, I declare the string "yourChildNode" twice. One in the if and other one in the else, are there any simplification?
@CODE:private void addParentNode_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        string yourParentNode;
        yourParentNode = textBox1.Text.Trim();
        treeView2.Nodes.Add(yourParentNode);
    }

    private void addChildNode_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        string yourChildNode;
        yourChildNode = textBox1.Text.Trim();
        treeView2.Nodes[0].Nodes.Add(yourChildNode);
    } //treeView1.BeginUpdate(); 
  //treeView1.Nodes.Clear(); //This is for adding a parent node
    private void addParentNode_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        treeView2.BeginUpdate();

        string yourParentNode;
        yourParentNode = textBox1.Text.Trim();
        treeView2.Nodes.Add(yourParentNode);
        treeView2.EndUpdate();
    }

    //This is for adding child node
    private void addChildNode_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        if (treeView2.SelectedNode != null)
        {
            string yourChildNode;
            yourChildNode = textBox1.Text.Trim();

            treeView2.SelectedNode.Nodes.Add(yourChildNode);
            treeView2.ExpandAll();
        }
        //This is for adding the child node to the default node(parent 1 node)
        else
        {
            string yourChildNode;
            yourChildNode = textBox1.Text.Trim();
            treeView2.Nodes[0].Nodes.Add(yourChildNode);
        }

@TITLE:Creating a nested tree structure from a path in XSLT
@CONTENT:I have a dynamic XML document which represents a tree structure of categories, but does so using path separated attributes in arbitrary order - like this:    <data>    
      <record ID="24" Name="category 1\sub category 1"/>   
      <record ID="26" Name="category 1"/>     
      <record ID="25" Name="category 1\sub category 1\sub category 2"/>    
      <record ID="27" Name="category 1\sub category 1\sub category 3"/>    
      ...
   </data>
 I need to come up with a solution that 'normalizes' the XML so that it is transformed into something like this:    <data>    
      <record ID="26" Name="category 1">    
         <record ID="24" Name="sub category 1">    
            <record ID="25" Name="sub category 2"/>

         </record>
      </record>   
      ...
   </data>
 Basically I was wondering if this is something XSLT might be able to address, and how, rather than having to do it programmatically.

@TITLE:WHY doesn't WCF 'properly' consume/expose abstract types when hosted as a web service
@CONTENT:I've been designing web services for quite a while now but never had to expose a 'complicated' WCF service until recently. I was baffled at the apparent lack of "proper support" in WCF for abstract types. Sure - you can USE them - sure you can get them to 'work'... you just don't end up with what you WANT... The first problem is that if you generate code from a wsdl with an abstract type you get vastly different code because it falls back to the xmlserializer and not the DataContractSerializer. This is obviously a bit less than desirable... I'd like to use the fancy new faster serializer please thank you... (and all that comes along with Service/DataContract) on the flip side - if you start with code first and expose a properly attributed abstract wcf class as a web service the exposed wsdl does NOT contain the abstract="true" attribute making the "abstract class" technically concrete... This is not what I want of course... I've got a workaround but it involves a crazy amount of 'hackery' where I create the wsdl/xsd contract first, remove any abstract="true" (oh - let's not mention that I can't use attributes in the xsd shall we) and then svcuitl the result... But now I'm left with a c# api that has a CONCRETE abstract class and I then need to go modify that to ADD the abstract keyword... This 'works' but it's a huge pita - and not easily 'scriptable'... This is all just whacked! I'm hoping someone can explain to me precisely 'why' this is... I welcome answers that don't cite "solid" resources but I'm really waiting for the person to tell me - with proper documentation (like preferably from good ol Don Box himself) why exactly this is... Cause I just don't get it... Thanks all - if anyone would like more details - please let me know! UPDATED FOR ADDITION OF A SAMPLE REQUEST - starting with c# [ServiceContract]

@TITLE:Can I stop my WCF generating ArrayOfString instead of string[] or List<string>
@CONTENT:I am having a minor problem with WCF service proxies where the message contains List<string> as a parameter. I am using the 'Add Service reference' in Visual Studio to generate a reference to my service.    // portion of my web service message
   public List<SubscribeInfo> Subscribe { get; set; }
   public List<string> Unsubscribe { get; set; }
 These are the generated properties on my MsgIn for one of my web methods. You can see it used ArrayOfString when I am using List<string>, and the other takes List<SubscribeInfo> - which matches my original C# object above. [System.Runtime.Serialization.DataMemberAttribute(EmitDefaultValue=false)]
public System.Collections.Generic.List<DataAccess.MailingListWSReference.SubscribeInfo> Subscribe {
    get {
        return this.SubscribeField;
    }
    set {
        if ((object.ReferenceEquals(this.SubscribeField, value) != true)) {
            this.SubscribeField = value;
            this.RaisePropertyChanged("Subscribe");
        }
    }
}

[System.Runtime.Serialization.DataMemberAttribute(EmitDefaultValue=false)]
publicDataAccess.MailingListWSReference.ArrayOfString Unsubscribe {
    get {
        return this.UnsubscribeField;
    }
    set {
        if ((object.ReferenceEquals(this.UnsubscribeField, value) != true)) {
            this.UnsubscribeField = value;
            this.RaisePropertyChanged("Unsubscribe");
        }
    }
}
 The ArrayOfString class generated looks like this. This is a class generated in my code - its not a .NET class. It actually generated me a class that inherits from List, but didn't have the 'decency' to create me any constructors.     [System.Diagnostics.DebuggerStepThroughAttribute()]
    [System.CodeDom.Compiler.GeneratedCodeAttribute("System.Runtime.Serialization", "3.0.0.0")]
    [System.Runtime.Serialization.CollectionDataContractAttribute(Name="ArrayOfString", Namespace="http://www.example.com/", ItemName="string")]
    [System.SerializableAttribute()]
    public class ArrayOfString : System.Collections.Generic.List<string> {
    }
 The problem is that I often create my message like this : client.UpdateMailingList(new UpdateMailingListMsgIn()
{
    Email = model.Email,
    Name = model.Name,
    Source = Request.Url.ToString(),
    Subscribe = subscribeTo.ToList(),
    Unsubscribe = unsubscribeFrom.ToList()
});
 I really like the clean look this gives me. Now for the actual problem : I cant assign a List<string> to the Unsubscribe property which is an ArrayOfString - even though it inherits from List. In fact I cant seem to find ANY way to assign it without extra statements. I've tried the following : new ArrayOfString(unsubscribeFrom.ToList()) - this constructor doesn't exist :-( changing the type of the array used by the code generator - doesn't work - it always gives me ArrayOfString (!?) try to cast List<string> to ArrayOfString - fails with 'unable to cast', even though it compiles just fine create new ArrayOfString() and then AddRange(unsubscribeFrom.ToList()) - works, but I cant do it all in one statement create a conversion function ToArrayOfString(List<string>), which works but isn't as clean as I want. Its only doing this for string, which is annoying. Am i missing something? Is there a way to tell it not to generate ArrayOfString - or some other trick to assign it ?

@TITLE:.NET WCF faults generating incorrect SOAP 1.1 faultcode values
@CONTENT:I am experimenting with using the FaultException and FaultException<T> to determine the best usage pattern in our applications. We need to support WCF as well as non-WCF service consumers/clients, including SOAP 1.1 and SOAP 1.2 clients. FYI: using FaultExceptions with wsHttpBinding results in SOAP 1.2 semantics whereas using FaultExceptions with basicHttpBinding results in SOAP 1.1 semantics. I am using the following code to throw a FaultException<FaultDetails>:   throw new FaultException<FaultDetails>(
      new FaultDetails("Throwing FaultException<FaultDetails>."),
      new FaultReason("Testing fault exceptions."),
      FaultCode.CreateSenderFaultCode(new FaultCode("MySubFaultCode"))
      );
 The FaultDetails class is just a simple test class that contains a string "Message" property as you can see below. When using wsHttpBinding the response is: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?>
<Fault xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope">
<Code>
  <Value>Sender</Value>
  <Subcode>
    <Value>MySubFaultCode</Value>
  </Subcode>
</Code>
<Reason>
  <Text xml:lang="en-US">Testing fault exceptions.</Text>
</Reason>
<Detail>
  <FaultDetails xmlns="http://schemas.datacontract.org/2004/07/ClassLibrary" xmlns:i="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
    <Message>Throwing FaultException&lt;FaultDetails&gt;.</Message>
  </FaultDetails>
</Detail>
 This looks right according to the SOAP 1.2 specs. The main/root ：Code； is ：Sender；, which has a ：Subcode； of ：MySubFaultCode；. If the service consumer/client is using WCF the FaultException on the client side also mimics the same structure, with the faultException.Code.Name being ：Sender； and faultException.Code.SubCode.Name being ：MySubFaultCode；. When using basicHttpBinding the response is: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?>
<s:Fault xmlns:s="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
  <faultcode>s:MySubFaultCode</faultcode>
  <faultstring xml:lang="en-US">Testing fault exceptions.</faultstring>
  <detail>
    <FaultDetails xmlns="http://schemas.datacontract.org/2004/07/ClassLibrary" xmlns:i="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
      <Message>Throwing FaultException&lt;FaultDetails&gt;.</Message>
    </FaultDetails>
  </detail>
</s:Fault>
 This does not look right. Looking at the SOAP 1.1 specs, I was expecting to see the ：faultcode； to have a value of ：s:Client.MySubFaultCode； when I use FaultCode.CreateSenderFaultCode(new FaultCode("MySubFaultCode")). Also a WCF client gets an incorrect structure. The faultException.Code.Name is ：MySubFaultCode； instead of being ：Sender；, and the faultException.Code.SubCode is null instead of faultException.Code.SubCode.Name being ：MySubFaultCode；. Also, the faultException.Code.IsSenderFault is false. Similar problem when using FaultCode.CreateReceiverFaultCode(new FaultCode("MySubFaultCode")): works as expected for SOAP 1.2 generates ：s:MySubFaultCode； instead of ：s:Server.MySubFaultCode； and the faultException.Code.IsReceiverFault is false for SOAP 1.1 This item was also posted by someone else on http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=669420&SiteID=1 in 2006 and no one has answered it. I find it very hard to believe that no one has run into this, yet.

@TITLE:international characters in Javascript
@CONTENT:I am working on a web application, where I transfer data from the server to the browser in XML. Since I'm danish, I quickly run into problems with the characters ???. I know that in html, I use the "&amp;aelig;&amp;oslash;&amp;aring;" for ???. however, as soon as the chars pass through JavaScript, I get black boxes with "?" in them when using ???, and "&aelig;&oslash;&aring;" is printed as is. I've made sure to set it to utf-8, but that isn't helping much. Ideally, I want it to work with any special characters (naturally). The example that isn't working is included below: <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">
<html>
  <head>
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />

            alert("???");

        </script>
    </head>
    <body>

 What am I doing wrong? Ok, thanks to Grapefrukts answer, I got it working. I actually needed it for data coming from an MySQL server. Since the saving of the files in UTF-8 encoding only solves the problem for static content, I figure I'd include the solution for strings from a MySQL server, pulled out using PHP: utf8_encode($MyStringHere)
@CODE:??? "&amp;aelig;&amp;oslash;&amp;aring;" ??? "?" ??? "&aelig;&oslash;&aring;" <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">

@TITLE:UI Automation events stop being received after a while monitoring an application and then restart after some time
@CONTENT:We are using Microsoft's UIAutomation framework to develop a client that monitors events of a specific application and responds to them in different ways. We've started with the managed version of the framework, but due to delay issues, moved to the native version wrapped in UIACOMWrapper. After more issues with performance inside our (massive) WPF application, we decided to move it to a separate terminal application (transfer the events to our WPF app through UDP) which seemed to fix all the performance issues. The only problem is that it seems that every several minutes, the events for TabSelection, StructureChanged, WindowOpened and WindowClosed stop being captured for a few minutes. Surprisingly PropertyChanged events are still received and handled while this happens. I will post the relevant code of our event monitor, but this is probably irrelevant as we have seen similar behavior when using Microsoft's own AccEvent utility. I can't post the code of the monitored application as it is proprietary and confidential as well, I can say that it is a WinForms application that hosts WPF windows and also quite massive. Has anyone seen this sort of behavior while working with the UI Automation framework? Thank you for your time.

 EDIT: I forgot to mention that I strongly suspect that the issue is that one of the UI-Automation event handler threads gets stuck somehow. The reason I believe this, is that when the problem occurred in my monitor, I started an instance of AccEvent and it received all the missing events that my monitor was not getting. This means that the events are being fired but not passed to my monitor. EDIT2: I forgot to mention that this happens running in Windows 8 with the specific target application, I have not seen this phenomenon on my own Windows 7 machine with other applications. Another interesting thing is that it seems to happen periodically more or less, but regardless of when I subscribe to events, i.e. it can happen almost immediately after subscribing but then it takes several minutes to reoccur.

@TITLE:Issue adding reference to class libary project in ASP.NET 5 vnext
@CONTENT:Hi firstly i know vaguely similar questions have been asked before, but they are outdated now, I am using Visual Studio 2015 rtm and ASP.NET 5 beta 6. I'm trying to add a reference to a normal (i.e. not vnext) class library project to my vnext web application. If I follow these steps: Create a new web app project Remove the "dnxcore50" framework from project.json Add a new project for a normal class library Manually move the class library project into the /src folder (otherwise I get error "The dependency MyClassLibrary1 >= 1.0.0-* could not be resolved.") Add a reference to this class library Now it builds OK, but if I try and add "using MyClassLibrary1" it says MyClassLibrary1 doesn't exist in current context. If I then change the class library to target .NET 4 Client profile (by default it was 4.6) it does work correctly, however .NET 4 full or 4.5 does not work. I need it to be 4.5 or higher as I need to reference various packages that require this. Ideally everything would just target 4.6. This is my project.json file: {

@LINK:/questions/28365202/spring-boot-eureka-server-hystrix-with-turbine-empty-turbine-stream
@TITLE:Spring Boot + Eureka Server + Hystrix with Turbine: empty turbine.stream
@CONTENT:I'm trying to run Spring Boot (with Spring Cloud) + Eureka Server + Hystrix Dashboard and Turbine stream, but I run into a problem I couldn't find any solution so far. I use Spring Boot 1.2.1.RELEASE and Spring Cloud 1.0.0.RC2. Here is what I have: The first instance is running Eureka server and Hystrix dashboard: @Configuration
@EnableAutoConfiguration
@EnableEurekaServer
@EnableHystrixDashboard
@EnableDiscoveryClient
class Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run Application, args
    }
}
 Here you can find build.gradle for that instance - https://gist.github.com/wololock/570272ad7cf2d14a4d3c Eureka server is running ok, I can see registered instances on eureka server dashboard, I can also use LoadBalancer to get the URL to registered instance using its id. So far everything is ok. I have a few instances that are run with @EnableHystrix annotation and use @HystrixCommand to define which methods have to be monitored by Hystrix. When I pass URL to hystrix.stream of single instance to Hystrix dashboard, I can see it running with no problem. I have also separate Turbine server, not complicated one: @EnableAutoConfiguration
@EnableTurbine
@Configuration
@EnableDiscoveryClient
class Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run Application, args
    }
}
 Here you can find build.gradle for Turbine server instance - https://gist.github.com/wololock/ff0d855b8a890232851e It uses very simple configuration, build mostly on the one provided by sample turbine app - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/turbine info:
  component: Turbine

endpoints:
  restart:
    enabled: true
  shutdown:
    enabled: true

turbine:
  appConfig: pdf-creator-service

InstanceDiscovery:
  impl: io.spring.platform.netflix.turbine.EurekaInstanceDiscovery

server:
  port: 8989

management:
  port: 8990

eureka:

  client:
    serviceUrl:
      defaultZone: ${vcap.services.${PREFIX:}eureka.credentials.uri:http://user:password@localhost:8761}/eureka/
 After running those instances in order: eureka server turbine server discover client instance, I have 2nd and 3rd instance registered in eureka server, turbine server log says, that there is one instance up: [2015-02-06 12:35:04.162] boot - 20495  INFO [Timer-0] --- EurekaInstanceDiscovery: Fetching instance list for apps: [pdf-creator-service]

Previously I tried to manage this by having eureka and turbine server in single instance, but in that case turbine couldn't even find the registered application in eureka using proper application name. I made a progress after splitting eureka and turbine, but it still does not work correctly. I will be grateful for any suggestion. If you need more information, just let me know, I might miss something important. UPDATE 20150209 Following Dave's suggestion I applied small changes in application.yml file of turbine-server. Now the file contains only: info:
  component: Turbine

turbine:
  appConfig: pdf-creator-service
  clusterNameExpression: 'default'

server:
  port: 8989

management:
  port: 8990

eureka:
  instance:
    leaseRenewalIntervalInSeconds: 10
  client:
    serviceUrl:
      defaultZone: ${vcap.services.${PREFIX:}eureka.credentials.uri:http://user:password@localhost:8761}/eureka/
 But it doesn't make turbine.stream working. After turbine-server gets aware of registered client in eureka server, it fails with given exception: [2015-02-09 21:25:03.516] boot - 4808  INFO [Timer-0] --- EurekaInstanceDiscovery: Fetching instance list for apps: [pdf-creator-service]

 I tried writting 'default' as well as default, but the result is unfortunately the same. Solution Thanks Dave Syer for finding the proper solution. Basically what did the trick was adding: turbine:
    clusterNameExpression: new String("default")
 to application.yml file in turbine server application instance. It might look weird, I didn't believe it will work, but it does. Now when I call my hystrix client application I get the proper information in hystrix.stream that is served by this application and in turbine.stream of Turbine server as well. My current application.yml in turbine server looks as follows: info:
  component: Turbine

turbine:
  clusterNameExpression: new String("default")
  appConfig: pdf-creator-service

server:
  port: 8989

management:
  port: 8990

eureka:
  instance:
    leaseRenewalIntervalInSeconds: 10
  client:
    serviceUrl:
      defaultZone: ${vcap.services.${PREFIX:}eureka.credentials.uri:http://user:password@localhost:8761}/eureka/
 turbine.appConfig holds the information about the hystrix clients (by their IDs). To add another client to your turbine server you will have to simply put another instance id, coma separated with the previous one. And that's all folks :)

 This was working perfectly fine, with no margins whatsoever between the list elements. I have now just placed the linear layout inside the cardView which has resulted in extra margins. The reason being that i want to provide exact margins to these elements, and any margins I supply now is being added over to this preexisting margins. I have tried supplying zero/negative paddings/margins to the cardView element but none of these work. Any idea, I can remove these margins or otherwise know exactly how much margin is being added.

 This question asked basically the same question, but only a single "info" column. I have multiple other columns and would like to do this for all of them. Bonus points for doing this using dplyr.

cor.matrix <- round(cor(dat, use = "pairwise.complete.obs", method = "spearman"), digits = 2)

 But what I'm trying to produce is- it seems like this should be obvious (e.g. it's very easy to do in base-R) , but I haven't managed to find what I'm looking for in ggplot2.

@CONTENT:I am making a software in C# and MATLAB that calls another software (CMG) to do some processing. My problem is that the address of the software I have put in my program is only correct on my personal computer and not on the customers' computers (I don't know what would be the path to CMG software on their computer). How can I provide a general form of the address in order to make it work on every computer? The following is the path I call from my MATLAB software: C:\Program Files (x86)\CMG\STARS\2011.10\Win_x64\EXE\st201110.exe
 As you see it is in drive C and the version is 2011.10. So if customer's version is something else and it is installed on other drives, this path makes no sense.

@TITLE:Moved my ASP.NET website to IIS 8 on windows server 2012K services missing: .svc files are viewable, but their methods give a 404
@CONTENT:I moved from IIS 6 on windows server 2003. I can browse to the .svc files. I get a nice standard "This is a Windows? Communication Foundation service" page if I go to http://example.com/Service.svc in a browser. But I can't browse to any of the methods - I get a 404 error if I go to http://example.com/Service.svc/Method?parameter=xyz in a browser. Has anyone seen anything like this? Any ideas or suggestions? I thought I might have a similar problem to this question: WCF on IIS8; *.svc handler mapping doesn't work But the symptoms are different (looks like they can't see .svc files at all) and none of the solutions work (I have Http Activation for WCF features installed, etc).

@CONTENT:Im creating a map in a fragment, the source code can be found below. The map can show up, unfortunately when the first time the map fragment loads, it looks sluggish, if I go any other fragment and click the map fragment, it loads fast and no slug anymore. Can anyone tell me what is going on here? Thanks! fragment_map.xml, id is map <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

 Edit: Previously I stored all images in drawable folder, this might be the reason why the map first loads slow, when draw the markers on screen, the image may not fit the screen size. Now I stored images in drawable-mdpi, drawable-hdpi and so on, the app works smoother than before.

@TITLE:Vim: Remove comment character after double enter
@CONTENT:In Vim, I like the feature that allows you to auto insert comments after you have started a comment block. How would you make it so that you get a comment character(s) after a newline, but upon getting a second newline that comment is removed and you start a newline without a comment character. This would be helpful if you are working on a comment block and don't want to make anymore comments after that (in my case I also want to apply the same thing to markdown lists, treating */- as comment characters). For example // typing a comment
// (cursor here after hitting enter once)
 And // typing a comment

(cursor here after hitting enter twice)

@TITLE:Presenting semi-transparent viewcontroller that works both in iOS7 and iOS8
@CONTENT:I had the following code that worked perfectly in iOS7. [UIView animateWithDuration:0.5 animations:^(void) {
    self.view.alpha = 0.5;
    [self.navigationController.navigationBar setAlpha:0.3];

}]; //to make the background view controller semi-transparent
UIViewController *rootViewController = [UIApplication sharedApplication].delegate.window.rootViewController;
[rootViewController setModalPresentationStyle:UIModalPresentationCurrentContext];
OverlayViewController *ctlr = [storyBoard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@"OverlayViewController"];
//present the OverlayViewController
[self presentViewController:ctlr animated:YES completion:nil];
 Then I had the following in viewWillAppear of the background view controller, to revert back its view to full opaque. [UIView animateWithDuration:1.0 animations:^(void) {
    self.view.alpha = 1.0;
    [self.navigationController.view setAlpha:1.0];
}];
 Now, with iOS8, the above code doesn't set the background to be semi-transparent. Black color surrounds the OverlayViewController. I found online that using UIModalPresentationOverCurrentContext will give the expected behavior. It does actually, but the background view controller is never taken off the view heirarchy (edited to add reference to this behavior: https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/iOS/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIViewController_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/c/tdef/UIModalPresentationStyle). So, the viewWillAppear is never called, and so the semi-transparency is never removed. Obviously, I can resort to hacks like using NSNotificationCenter and fire off a notification when the OverlayViewController is removed, but it feels like a roundabout way to do what should be simple. Is there any other way in which I can gracefully achieve this? Corollary questions: 1) If UIModalPresentationOverCurrentContext is the only way to achieve this, then I am wondering if I would be forced to put two versions of the code to get it working both in iOS7 and iOS8. 2) Obviously that new enum is not recognized in earlier versions of XCode. So, should my team upgrade to XCode 6 just to ensure they can run this code, even if the rest of their work is centered around iOS7 only? Or is there any way of telling the older version of XCode to ignore the particular code block that is needed only for iOS8?

@LINK:/questions/25675389/implement-coredata-into-an-existing-project-using-swift
@TITLE:Implement CoreData into an existing project using Swift
@CONTENT:I am currently using Xcode 6 beta 7 and decided I needed CoreData after already creating my project. I have looked at some of the questions already asking this for objective C along with watching videos on the subject but I seem to be getting the same error. As for my usage of the CoreData framework itself, I am pretty sure it is correct as I created another empty project (with the CoreData box checked) and followed the same implementation and it worked like a charm but there may be something wrong I'm doing there too. So here are the steps I followed to implement CoreData in my project in Swift. Any help is appreciated. Step 1: I added the CoreData framework through "Link Binary with Libraries" tab under "Build Phases" Step 2: I then went to any of my .swift files which would need to implement CoreData (appDelegate.swift and one other file as of now) and added the line: import CoreData
 to the top. Step 3: I created a data list with an entity called "cData", then made a class for it called "data.swift". Here is data.swift: import UIKit
import CoreData

@objc( data )
class data: NSManagedObject {

    @NSManaged var something : String
}
 Step 4: I wrote the code to actually save the data in another file: @IBAction func useCoreData(sender: AnyObject)
    {

        let AD : AppDelegate = UIApplication.sharedApplication().delegate as AppDelegate
        let ct : NSManagedObjectContext = AD.managedObjectContext!
        let ent = NSEntityDescription.entityForName( "CData", inManagedObjectContext: ct )
        var dat = data( entity: ent!, insertIntoManagedObjectContext: ct )
        dat.something = someTextField.text
        ct.save( nil )

        println(dat)


    }
 Step 5: Here is where I believe I messed up, though I could be wrong. I created a new project on a separate Mac (so I could name it the same thing) and checked the CoreData box. I then copied the entire appDelegate.swift from this project to my current one. Here is my appDelegate.swift: import UIKit
import CoreData



@UIApplicationMain

class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {



    var window: UIWindow?





    func application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool {

        // Override point for customization after application launch.

        return true

    }



    func applicationWillResignActive(application: UIApplication) {

        // Sent when the application is about to move from active to inactive state. This can occur for certain types of temporary interruptions (such as an incoming phone call or SMS message) or when the user quits the application and it begins the transition to the background state.

        // Use this method to pause ongoing tasks, disable timers, and throttle down OpenGL ES frame rates. Games should use this method to pause the game.

    }



    func applicationDidEnterBackground(application: UIApplication) {

        // Use this method to release shared resources, save user data, invalidate timers, and store enough application state information to restore your application to its current state in case it is terminated later.

        // If your application supports background execution, this method is called instead of applicationWillTerminate: when the user quits.

    }



    func applicationWillEnterForeground(application: UIApplication) {

        // Called as part of the transition from the background to the inactive state; here you can undo many of the changes made on entering the background.

    }



    func applicationDidBecomeActive(application: UIApplication) {

        // Restart any tasks that were paused (or not yet started) while the application was inactive. If the application was previously in the background, optionally refresh the user interface.

    }



    func applicationWillTerminate(application: UIApplication) {

        // Called when the application is about to terminate. Save data if appropriate. See also applicationDidEnterBackground:.

        // Saves changes in the application's managed object context before the application terminates.

        self.saveContext()

    }

    lazy var applicationDocumentsDirectory: NSURL = {

        }()



    lazy var persistentStoreCoordinator: NSPersistentStoreCoordinator? = {

        // The persistent store coordinator for the application. This implementation creates and return a coordinator, having added the store for the application to it. This property is optional since there are legitimate error conditions that could cause the creation of the store to fail.

        // Create the coordinator and store

        var coordinator: NSPersistentStoreCoordinator? = NSPersistentStoreCoordinator(managedObjectModel: self.managedObjectModel)

        let url = self.applicationDocumentsDirectory.URLByAppendingPathComponent("my_app.sqlite")

        var error: NSError? = nil

            let dict = NSMutableDictionary()

            dict[NSLocalizedDescriptionKey] = "Failed to initialize the application's saved data"

            dict[NSLocalizedFailureReasonErrorKey] = failureReason

        }



        return coordinator

    lazy var managedObjectContext: NSManagedObjectContext? = {

        // Returns the managed object context for the application (which is already bound to the persistent store coordinator for the application.) This property is optional since there are legitimate error conditions that could cause the creation of the context to fail.

        let coordinator = self.persistentStoreCoordinator

        if coordinator == nil {

            return nil

        }

        var managedObjectContext = NSManagedObjectContext()

        managedObjectContext.persistentStoreCoordinator = coordinator

        return managedObjectContext

        }()



    // MARK: - Core Data Saving support



    func saveContext () {

        if let moc = self.managedObjectContext {

            var error: NSError? = nil

            if moc.hasChanges && !moc.save(&error) {

                // Replace this implementation with code to handle the error appropriately.

                // abort() causes the application to generate a crash log and terminate. You should not use this function in a shipping application, although it may be useful during development.

                NSLog("Unresolved error \(error), \(error!.userInfo)")

                abort()

            }

        }

    }



}
 Once the IBAction method "useCoreData" is called, I get a crash and the exception states "fatal error: unexpectedly found nil while unwrapping an Optional value (lldb)" and states the offending line is in appDelegate.swift: let modelURL = NSBundle.mainBundle().URLForResource("my_app", withExtension: "momd")!
 Again, when I try this same CoreData implementation in another project that had the CoreData box checked from the get-go, it works like a charm. I saw a similar question like this (the user was getting the same error), but it doesn't seem like his problem was solved either. Again any help is appreciated and thanks in advance!

@TITLE:In ggplot2, coord_flip and free scales don't work together
@CONTENT:Here is some example data for a hypothetical meta-analysis on the effectiveness of sports-promotion interventions for which I would like to create a forest plot: example.df = data.frame(Author = c("McAuliffe et al.", "Palen et al.", "Manning et al.", "Richters et al.", "Grello et al.","Mpofu et al.", "Kuo & St Lawrence", "Langstrom & Hanson", "Ompad et al.", "Abdullah et al.","Yan", "Peltzer & Pengpid", "Lo & Wei", "Haggstrom-Nordin et al.", "Mwaba & Naidoo", "Hughes et al.","Lydie et al.", "Zimmer-Gembeck et al.", "Babalola", "Garos et al.", "Pinkerton et al."),
                    Sport = c("Basketball", "Basketball", "Baseball", "Dance", "Baseball", "Dance", "Wrestling","Wrestling", "Dance", "Baseball", "Wrestling", "Dance", "Swimming", "Swimming","Basketball", "Basketball", "Basketball", "Basketball", "Basketball", "Swimming", "Wrestling"),
                    Gender = c("Male", "Female", "Male", "Male", "Female", "Male", "Male", "Male", "Male", "Female","Female", "Male", "Female", "Female", "Female", "Male", "Female", "Female", "Female", "Male", "Female"),
                    d = c(-0.12, 0.53, 0.11, 0.02, 0.32, 0.04, 0.03,0.04,0.26, 0.76, 1.11, 0.34, 0.77, 1.19, 0.59, 0.15, 0.30, 0.81, 0.12, 0.11, 1.01),
                    d_SE = c(.10, .04, .06, .01, .11, .08, .08, .04, .05, .05, .14, .07, .05, .08, .19, .16, .07, .16, .06, .18, .15))
 The data frame contains author names, the sport, whether the sample was male or female, the effect size for the intervention, and the standard error of the effect size. I am hoping to create a dot plot mapping shape to gender, and faceting by the particular sport. After following examples in Chang's "cookbook" and this related query, I've come up with the following code that meets most of my formatting needs: p<-ggplot(example.df, aes(x=Author, y=d, ymin=d-1.96*d_SE, ymax=d+1.96*d_SE,shape=Gender))+ 
geom_pointrange() + 
coord_flip()+
scale_y_continuous(limits=c(-2,2),breaks=c(-2,-1.5,-1,-0.5,0,.5,1,1.5,2))+
geom_hline(yintercept=0, color="grey60",linetype="dashed")+
theme_bw()+
theme(panel.grid.major.x=element_blank(),panel.grid.minor.x=element_blank(),panel.grid.major.y=element_line(color="grey60",linetype="dashed"))+
facet_grid(Sport ~ ., scales="free_y")
p
 My problem, however, is that the resulting plots for each facet (below) have every author in the entire data frame plotted on the y-axis (technically x-axis, but the axes are flipped). Instead, I only want the authors with data relevant to a given facet to be plotted on the author-associated axis of that facet, so each facet should have a different list of authors on the axis. I had thought the scales="free_y"component of the facet_grid layer would ensure a unique author axis for each facet (I've also tried scales="free_x", given the inverted axes), but this is not having the intended effect. Does anyone know of a way that I could ensure that the only author names that appear on each facet's axis are the ones with associated data for that facet?
@CODE:example.df = data.frame(Author = c("McAuliffe et al.", "Palen et al.", "Manning et al.", "Richters et al.", "Grello et al.","Mpofu et al.", "Kuo & St Lawrence", "Langstrom & Hanson", "Ompad et al.", "Abdullah et al.","Yan", "Peltzer & Pengpid", "Lo & Wei", "Haggstrom-Nordin et al.", "Mwaba & Naidoo", "Hughes et al.","Lydie et al.", "Zimmer-Gembeck et al.", "Babalola", "Garos et al.", "Pinkerton et al."),

@TITLE:Angular JS ui-router how to redirect to a child state from a parent?
@CONTENT:When using onEnter to redirect to a state, if the new state is a child of the current state, an infinite loop occurs. Example: $stateProvider
  .state 'inventory',
    url: '/inventory'
    templateUrl: 'views/inventory.html'

    controller: 'LowInventoryCtrl'
 When: $state.go 'inventory.low'
 Is called, the state inventory is re-initialized, causing it to be called again = infinite loop. However, if the redirect state is: $state.go 'otherStateThatIsNotAChild'
 This issue does not occur. I assume that the parent state is being re-initialized, but why? Why is the parent state being reinitialized when .go is called on a child state? How then, would you handle redirecting to a child state?

@CONTENT:I have been trying to add spring validators to a spring-data-rest project. I followed along and setup the "getting started" application via this link: http://spring.io/guides/gs/accessing-data-rest/ ...and now I am trying to add a custom PeopleValidator by following the documents here: http://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/docs/2.1.0.RELEASE/reference/html/validation-chapter.html My custom PeopleValidator looks like package hello;

public class PeopleValidator implements Validator {
    @Override
    public boolean supports(Class<?> clazz) {
        return true;
    }

    @Override
    public void validate(Object target, Errors errors) {
        errors.reject("DIE");
    }
}
 ...and my Application.java class now looks like this package hello;

}
 I would expect that POSTing to the http://localhost:8080/people URL would result in an error of some kind since the PeopleValidator is rejecting everything. However, no error is thrown, and the validator is never called. I have also tried manually setting up the validator as shown in section 5.1 of the spring-data-rest documentation. What am I missing?

@TITLE:Format Timestamp in outgoing JSON in GoLang?
@CONTENT:so I've been playing with Go recently and its awesome. The thing I can't seem to figure out (after looking through documentation and blog posts) is how to get the time.Time type to format into whatever format I'd like when it's encoded by json.NewEncoder.Encode Here's a minimal Code example: package main

type Document struct {
    Name        string
    Content     string
    Stamp       time.Time
    Author      string
}

func sendResponse(data interface{}, w http.ResponseWriter, r * http.Request){
     _, err := json.Marshal(data)
    j := json.NewEncoder(w)
    if err == nil {
        encodedErr := j.Encode(data)
        if encodedErr != nil{
            //code snipped
        }
    }else{
       //code snipped
    }
}

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/document", control.HandleDocuments)
    http.ListenAndServe("localhost:4000", nil)
}

func HandleDocuments(w http.ResponseWriter,r *http.Request) {
    w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "application/json")
    w.Header().Set("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*")

    switch r.Method {
        case "GET": 
            //logic snipped
            testDoc := model.Document{"Meeting Notes", "These are some notes", time.Now(), "Bacon"}    
            sendResponse(testDoc, w,r)
            }
        case "POST":
        case "PUT":
        case "DELETE":
        default:
            //snipped
    }
}
 So idealy, I'd like to send a request and get the Stamp field back as something like May 15, 2014 and not 2014-05-16T08:28:06.801064-04:00 But I'm not really sure how, I know I can add json:stamp to the Document type declaration to get the field to be encoded with the name stamp instead of Stamp, but I don't know what those types of things are called, so I'm not even sure what to google for to find out if there is some type of formatting option in that as well. Does anyone have a link to the an example or good documentation page on the subject of those type mark ups (or whatever they're called) or on how I can tell the JSON encoder to handle time.Time fields? Edit: Just for reference, I have looked at this page:here and here and of course, at the official docs
@CODE:time.Time json.NewEncoder.Encode package main

    Name        string

The "thread" based method is not intended for production use; it is merely useful for prototyping and tutorials such as this one. Hibernate.cfg.xml <hibernate-configuration>

    <session-factory>

 Current Configuration and Code Based on answers blew and this part of documentation mu current configuration is as following:  public class HibernateUtil {

    private static SessionFactory sessionFactory = buildSessionFactory();

    private static SessionFactory buildSessionFactory() {
        try {
              Configuration configuration = new Configuration();
              return configuration.configure()
                                  .buildSessionFactory(
                                       new StandardServiceRegistryBuilder()  
                                          .applySettings(configuration.getProperties())
                                          .build());
        } catch (Throwable ex) {
            System.err.println("Initial SessionFactory creation failed." + ex);
            throw new ExceptionInInitializerError(ex);
        }
    }

    public static SessionFactory getSessionFactory() {
        return sessionFactory;
    }

}
 And the code would be as following     final Session session = HibernateUtil.getSessionFactory().openSession();
    try {
        final Transaction tx = session.beginTransaction();
        try {
              ...

@TITLE:Interleave three equally sized partitions in an array inplace in O(n) time
@CONTENT:Given an array of size 3n of the form [x1, x2, x3... xn, y1, y2, y3... yn, z1, z2, z3... zn]
 Convert it to [x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, ... xn, yn, zn] Here xn, yn, zn can be any integers. See example input and output below. Two constraints Do in O(n) O(1) memory (inplace) An example input and output are as follows. Input : [5, 8, 11, 3, 2, 17, 21, 1, 9] 3n = 9. So n = 3. Here x1=5 x2=8 x3=11 y1=3 y2=2 y3=17 z1=21 z2=1 z3=9 Output : [5, 3, 21, 8, 2, 1, 11, 17, 9] One possible O(n log n) soln: Considering just x's and y's. Now I can swap all y's to its position which will leave me x2, x4, x6 swapped out of position. Then I will swap in x2, x4's which will leave x3, x7's out of position. And next iteration would be x8, x16's. This would take me to O(n log n) but not O(n).
@CODE:[x1, x2, x3... xn, y1, y2, y3... yn, z1, z2, z3... zn] [x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, ... xn, yn, zn] [5, 8, 11, 3, 2, 17, 21, 1, 9] x1=5 x2=8 x3=11 y1=3 y2=2 y3=17 z1=21 z2=1 z3=9 [5, 3, 21, 8, 2, 1, 11, 17, 9] x,y,z a,b,c

@LINK:/questions/23019194/difficulty-getting-browserify-shim-working-with-grunt-browserify-2-0-2-as-tr
@TITLE:Difficulty getting browserify-shim working with grunt-browserify (> 2.0.2) as transform
@CONTENT:In version 2.0.2 of grunt-browserify, browserify-shim was removed from the module itself and converted to be used as a transform, rather than a straightforward option on a grunt-browserify task. The old version of using the shim with grunt-browserify would look as such: 'libs-dev': {
    src: [path.join('<%= config.dirs.browserLibs %>', 'angular', 'angular.js')],
    dest: path.join('<%= config.dirs.dest.dev %>', 'js', 'libs.js'),
    options: {
        shim: {
            angular: {
                path: path.join('<%= config.dirs.browserLibs %>', 'angular', 'angular.js'),
                exports: 'angular'
            }
        }
    }
}
 This worked great, and generated a wrapper around the libs.js module as such: require=(function(e,t,n){function i(n,s){if(!t[n]){if(!e[n]){var o=typeof require=="function"&&require;if(!s&&o)return o(n,!0);if(r)return r(n,!0);throw new Error("Cannot find module '"+n+"'")}var u=t[n]={exports:{}};e[n][0].call(u.exports,function(t){var r=e[n][1][t];return i(r?r:t)},u,u.exports)}return t[n].exports}var r=typeof require=="function"&&require;for(var s=0;s<n.length;s++)i(n[s]);return i})({"angular":[function(require,module,exports){
    module.exports=require('i10PRm');
},{}],"i10PRm":[function(require,module,exports){
    (function(global){(function browserifyShim(module, exports, define, browserify_shim__define__module__export__) {
        browserify_shim__define__module__export__(typeof angular != "undefined" ? angular : window.angular);
    }).call(global, undefined, undefined, undefined, function defineExport(ex) { module.exports = ex; });
})(window)
},{}]},{},["i10PRm"]);
 However, based on the (incredibly sparse and frustrating) documentation, the new version of the shim within grunt-browserify is used as a transform, as such: 'libs-dev': {
    src: [path.join('<%= config.dirs.browserLibs %>', 'angular', 'angular.js')],
    dest: path.join('<%= config.dirs.dest.dev %>', 'js', 'libs.js'),
    options: {
        transform: ['browserify-shim']
    }
}
 and, since browserify-shim's configuration is now entirely based on package.json configuration, my package.json looks as such: "browser": {
    "angular": "./bower_components/angular/angular.js"
},
"browserify-shim": {
    "angular": "angular"
}
 However, this generates a wrapper that looks like: (function e(t,n,r){function s(o,u){if(!n[o]){if(!t[o]){var a=typeof require=="function"&&require;if(!u&&a)return a(o,!0);if(i)return i(o,!0);throw new Error("Cannot find module '"+o+"'")}var f=n[o]={exports:{}};t[o][0].call(f.exports,function(e){var n=t[o][1][e];return s(n?n:e)},f,f.exports,e,t,n,r)}return n[o].exports}var i=typeof require=="function"&&require;for(var o=0;o<r.length;o++)s(r[o]);return s})({1:[function(require,module,exports){
    (function (global){
        __browserify_shim_require__=require;(function browserifyShim(module, exports, require, define, browserify_shim__define__module__export__) {
            browserify_shim__define__module__export__(typeof angular != "undefined" ? angular : window.angular);
    }).call(global, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, function defineExport(ex) { module.exports = ex; });
}).call(this,typeof self !== "undefined" ? self : typeof window !== "undefined" ? window : {})
},{}]},{},[1]);
 As you can see, something's missing from this new wrapper; there doesn't seem to be an equivalent to the i10PRm export value assigned in the old wrapper. Presumably, this means I'm using exports incorrectly somehow, though I'm following the browserify-shim docs and it all seems fairly straightforward. Would love any assistance or clarity regarding the newest versions of grunt-browserify (>= 2.0.2) and browserify-shim and how to use them together correctly.

@TITLE:Using lists inside data.table columns
@CONTENT:In data.table is possible to have columns of type list and I'm trying for the first time to benefit from this feature. I need to store for each row of my table dt several comments taken from an rApache web service. Each comment will have a username, datetime, and body item. Instead of using long strings with some weird, unusual character to separate each message from the others (like |), and a ; to separate each item in a comment, I thought to use lists like this: library(data.table)
dt <- data.table(id=1:2, comment=list(list(list(username="michele", date=Sys.time(), message="hello"),
                                           list(username="michele", date=Sys.time(), message="world")),
                                      list(list(username="michele", date=Sys.time(), message="hello"),
                                           list(username="michele", date=Sys.time(), message="world"))))

> dt
   id comment
1:  1  <list>
2:  2  <list>
 to store all the comments added for one particular row. (also because it will be easier to convert to JSON later on when I need to send it back to the UI) However, when I try to simulate how I will be actually filling my table during production (adding single comment to a particular row), R either crashes or doesn't assign what I would like and then crashes: library(data.table)

> library(data.table)
> dt <- data.table(id=1:2, comment=vector(mode="list", length=2))
> dt$comment
[[1]]
NULL

[[2]]
NULL

> dt[1L, comment := 1] # this works
> dt$comment
[[1]]
[1] 1

[[2]]
NULL

> set(dt, 1L, "comment", list(1, "a"))  # assign only `1` and when I try to see `dt` R crashes
Warning message:
In set(dt, 1L, "comment", list(1, "a")) :
  Supplied 2 items to be assigned to 1 items of column 'comment' (1 unused)

> dt[1L, comment := list(1, "a")]       # R crashes as soon as I run
> dt[1L, comment := list(list(1, "a"))] # any of these two
 I know I'm trying to misuse data.table, e.g. the way the j argument has been designed allows this: dt[1L, c("id", "comment") := list(1, "a")] # lists in RHS are seen as different columns! not parts of one
 Question: So, is there a way to do the assignment I want? Or I just have to take dt$comment out in a variable, modify it, and then re-assign the whole column every times I need to do an update?
@CODE:data.table list dt | ; library(data.table)

 Calender is showing as per the needs but the events like dp.change, dp.hide, dp.show are not firing up.. What could be the problem? Any help? EDIT: Please note that I've included all necessary files like Bootstrap js, bootstrap css, Moment.js and datetimepicker js and css files.

@TITLE:subprocess.Popen stdin read file
@CONTENT:I'm trying to call a process on a file after part of it has been read. For example: with open('in.txt', 'r') as a, open('out.txt', 'w') as b:
  header = a.readline()
  subprocess.call(['sort'], stdin=a, stdout=b)
 This works fine if I don't read anything from a before doing the subprocess.call, but if I read anything from it, the subprocess doesn't see anything. This is using python 2.7.3. I can't find anything in the documentation that explains this behaviour, and a (very) brief glance at the subprocess source didn't reveal a cause.

@TITLE:How to change CAGradientLayer color points?
@CONTENT:Right now I've got a GA Gradient layer where I've set the colors but I'd like to set the color point to (instead of top center, to top left) and the bottom to (instead of bottom center to bottom right) just to change things up a bit. Thoughts? Below is the code that I've got so far...I included core animation because I'm animation between colors. - (id)init {
    self = [super init];

    UIView *gradientView = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, self.w, self.h)];
    [self addSubview:gradientView];
    [self sendSubviewToBack:gradientView];

    topColor = [UIColor colorWithRed:0.012 green:0.012 blue:0.012 alpha:1];
    bottomColor = [UIColor colorWithRed:1.000 green:0.765 blue:0.235 alpha:1];

    gradient = [CAGradientLayer layer];
    gradient.frame = gradientView.frame;
    gradient.colors = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:(id)topColor.CGColor, (id)bottomColor.CGColor, nil];
    gradient.locations = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:[NSNumber numberWithFloat:0.0f], [NSNumber numberWithFloat:0.7], nil];
    [gradientView.layer addSublayer:gradient];

    [self performSelector:@selector(animateColors) withObject:self afterDelay:2.0];

@LINK:/questions/20263888/are-there-cases-where-downcasting-an-actual-base-to-a-derived-would-be-defined
@TITLE:Are there cases where downcasting an actual Base to a Derived would be defined?
@CONTENT:In the general case, it is (a very well deserved) Undefined Behavior to dowcast from a (dynamic) Base to one of the deriving classes Derived The obvious UB class Base
{
public:
    virtual void foo()
    { /* does something */?}

    int a;
}

class Derived : public Base
{
public:
    virtual void foo()
    { /* does something different */?}

    double b;
}

Base obj;
Derived derObj = *static_cast<Derived *>(&obj);  // <- here come the demons
 In the current implementation approach of compilers, here there would obviously be at least the problems of inconsistent values in the Vtable and b containing garbage values. So it makes sense the standard does not define the behavior of a downcast in those conditions. The not so obvious naive case Yet I was curious to know if there were some concessions to this rule in specific cases ? For an example : class Base
{
public:
    void foo()
    { /* does something */?}

    int a = 1;
    double b = 2.;
}

class DerivedForInt : public Base
{
    int getVal()
    { return a }
}

Base obj;
DerivedForInt derObj = *static_cast<DerivedForInt *>(&obj);  // <- still an UB ?
 Here we can easily imagine compiler doing the right thing. But from the standard perspective, is it still undefined ? Edit : static_cast is a random choice for illustration purpose, it is also interesting if working with other casts !
@CODE:Base Derived class Base
{
public:
    virtual void foo()
    { /* does something */?}

    int a;
}

class Derived : public Base
{
public:
    virtual void foo()
    { /* does something different */?}

    double b;
}

Base obj;
Derived derObj = *static_cast<Derived *>(&obj);  // <- here come the demons class Base
{
public:
    void foo()
    { /* does something */?}

    int a = 1;
    double b = 2.;
}

class DerivedForInt : public Base
{
    int getVal()
    { return a }
}

@TITLE:Java - Hibernate criteria.setResultTransformer(Transformers.aliasToBean(StudentModel.class)) initializes the studentModel fields with default values
@CONTENT:I am new to Hibernate and I am trying to get some data from the database. I don't want to get the full data but a projection of an entity. The thing is that in the for-loop when I get the id and the name of my projection, it gets the default values id=0 and name=null instead of id=7 and name="Name 8" which are the records of the original entity in the database. Do you know what causes this problem? The for-loop is in the last code. Here is the Student Entity @Entity(name = "Students")
public class Student {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    @Column(name = "StudentId")
    private int id;

    @Column(name = "Name", nullable = false, length = 50)
    private String name;

    @Column(name = "Grade")
    private Double grade = null;

    @ManyToOne(cascade = CascadeType.PERSIST)
    @JoinColumn(name = "FacultyId", nullable = false)
    private Faculty faculty;

    @ManyToMany(cascade = CascadeType.PERSIST)
    @JoinTable(
        joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "StudentId"),
        inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "CourseId"))
    private Collection<Course> courses;

    public Student() {
        this.courses = new HashSet<Course>();
    }

    // Setters and Getters for all fields
}
 Here is the StudentModel public class StudentModel {
    private  int id;
    private String name;

    public int getId() {
        return this.id;
    }

    public void setId(int id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return this.name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
 And the code I am executing Session session = sessionFactory.openSession();
    session.beginTransaction();

@TITLE:How to use selector to tint imageview in android
@CONTENT:I want to tint my tabhost's icons using xml, instead of doing it programatically (I wasn't able to do that anyway)... So I found this thread on SO: Android imageview change tint to simulate button click That seems to be a pretty good solution, but I wasn't able to adapt it correctly in my project... I did the following changes: public class TintableImageView extends ImageView {
private ColorStateList tint;

public TintableImageView(Context context) {
    super(context);
}

//this is the constructor that causes the exception
public TintableImageView(Context context, AttributeSet attrs) {
    super(context, attrs);
    init(context, attrs, 0);
}

public TintableImageView(Context context, AttributeSet attrs, int defStyle) {
    super(context, attrs, defStyle);
    init(context, attrs, defStyle);
}

//here, obtainStyledAttributes was asking for an array
private void init(Context context, AttributeSet attrs, int defStyle) {
    TypedArray a = context.obtainStyledAttributes(attrs, new int[]{R.styleable.TintableImageView_tint}, defStyle, 0);
    tint = a.getColorStateList(R.styleable.TintableImageView_tint);
    a.recycle();
}

@Override
protected void drawableStateChanged() {
    super.drawableStateChanged();
    if (tint != null && tint.isStateful())
        updateTintColor();
}

public void setColorFilter(ColorStateList tint) {
    this.tint = tint;
    super.setColorFilter(tint.getColorForState(getDrawableState(), 0));
}

private void updateTintColor() {
    int color = tint.getColorForState(getDrawableState(), 0);
    setColorFilter(color);
}

}
 I also wasn't able to reference @drawable/selector.xml at android:tint, so I did this at colors.xml: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
<color name="azulPadrao">#2e7cb4</color>
<drawable name="tab_icon_selector">@drawable/tab_icon_selector</drawable>
</resources>
 My selector: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

<selector xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
<item android:state_selected="true" android:tint="#007AFF" />
<item android:state_focused="true" android:tint="#007AFF" />
<item android:state_pressed="true" android:tint="#007AFF" />
<item android:tint="#929292" />
</selector>

</LinearLayout>
 Any suggestions? Thanks in advance [EDIT]I was getting a numberformatexception for using android:tint, when the correct was app:tint (after setting xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/com.myapp")... but now I think I'm using my selector in a wrong way, because the icons are all black, no matter the state... I've tried setting @drawable/tab_icon_selector from within colors.xml, didn't work [/EDIT]

@TITLE:Android SSL HTTP Request using self signed cert and CA
@CONTENT:I have an android application that is connecting to an SSL web service that we host. The Web server is apache and has its own CA that we created and a self signed SSL certificate. I have imported our CA certificate onto the Android tablet in the User Trusted certificates section in Security. I have tested access to the web server and can confirm that the web service certificate shows as valid (screenshot below) Here is the certificate in the security settings: Now when I try and access the webservice in my application I get the "No Peer Certificate" exception being triggered. This is the SSL implementation simplified: public class MainActivity extends Activity {

    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

    // allows network on main thread (temp hack)

    } catch (Exception e) {

}
 The while loop just spits out the certificates and I can see my own CA in the logs. But I still get the "No Peer Certificate" exception. 10-17 18:29:01.234: I/System.out(4006): No peer certificate Do I have to manually load my CA certificate somehow in this implementation?

@TITLE:Bootstrap Popover arrow and box positioning
@CONTENT:I am using Bootstrap popovers to display information about a link on hover, before clicking the link. It's currently working at the moment, however, The links are displayed from a dropdown menu at the top of the page. When the first link has alot of information about it, the top of the popover disappears at the top of the page, so you cannot see the content of it. I am trying to make it so that the popover arrow appears at the top-left of the popover(as opposed to middle-left which it is doing now) and the top of the popover box is level with the arrow if that makes sense. $('.popOver').popover({
    trigger: 'hover',
    html: true
});
 This above is working fine but I don't believe any popover options are able to help me here. Its the CSS I need to change but its rather extensive to post, so I was just looking for some one with knowledge of bootstrap to point me in the right direction. Thanks.

 When building the free variants, the annotations processor is run as indicated by the following in the gradle output: Note: Starting AndroidAnnotations annotation processing
 When building the Pro variants, the annotations processor doesn't run, so the references to the generated code fails. The curious thing about this is, I found (truly by accident) that if I remove the packageName "com.MyCompany.MyApp.Pro" from the script....the annotations processor runs and it will build correctly. I need to update the the package name for Google Play. When looking in android studio, you can see that the apt (the Annotation Processing Tool) is showing the Pro version as being active even when I have the FreeDebug build variant selected. I am not sure this is indicative of a problem or if this is just a problem with the beta android studio (Android Studio version: 0.2.13). So take that with a grain of salt. I'm new to the gradle build system but I thought I was getting the hang of it. I have looked at the script over and over again and I don't see why the annotations processor is not running for the pro variant. And aside from running the wrapper with the --info and --debug arguments, I don't know yet how to debug these problems. I've run the gradle wrapper with the -info and -debug to get extended output but there is nothing there that indicates any other error (or missing item) until it reaches the error caused by the missing generated code. So this leads me to believe it's just the fact that the androidannotations are not being run with that variant that is the root problem. (i.e. I don't think this is an error caused by something upstream and being misreported later on. I could be wrong though) I'm really at a loss and have been stuck with this for 2 days now.

@LINK:/questions/19348477/multitenancy-with-hibernate-4-0-with-separate-schema-approach
@TITLE:MultiTenancy with Hibernate 4.0 with Separate Schema approach
@CONTENT:I am using EJB 3.0 and Hibernate 4 with PostgreSQL as my database server to create a multitenant system where each tenant will have separate but identical schema. I am still in the trial stage where I have 3 schemes public, company1, company2 all having a single table person. Now what i want to do is change the schema in runtime as per the user so that he can view the data of his/her company only. Here is my sample code: Entity Object:     package com.neebal.domain;

        import java.io.Serializable;
        import java.lang.Long;
        import java.lang.String;

        import javax.persistence.*;
        import org.eclipse.persistence.annotations.Multitenant;
        import org.eclipse.persistence.annotations.MultitenantType;

        @Entity

        //@Table(schema = "company1")
        public class Person implements Serializable {


    @Id
    private Long id;
    private String name;
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    public Person() {
        super();
    }   
    public Long getId() {
        return this.id;
    }

    public void setId(Long id) {
        this.id = id;
    }   
    public String getName() {
        return this.name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }  
}
 The MultiTenantConnectionProvider class: import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.SQLException;
import java.util.Map;

import org.hibernate.HibernateException;
import org.hibernate.service.config.spi.ConfigurationService;
import org.hibernate.service.jdbc.connections.internal.C3P0ConnectionProvider;
import org.hibernate.service.jdbc.connections.spi.MultiTenantConnectionProvider;
import org.hibernate.service.spi.ServiceRegistryAwareService;
import org.hibernate.service.spi.ServiceRegistryImplementor;

public class MultiTenantProvider implements MultiTenantConnectionProvider, ServiceRegistryAwareService  {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 4368575201221677384L;

    private C3P0ConnectionProvider connectionProvider = null;

    @Override
    public boolean supportsAggressiveRelease() {
        return false;
    }

    @Override
    public void injectServices(ServiceRegistryImplementor serviceRegistry) {
        Map lSettings = serviceRegistry.getService(ConfigurationService.class).getSettings();

        connectionProvider = new C3P0ConnectionProvider();
        connectionProvider.injectServices(serviceRegistry);
        connectionProvider.configure(lSettings);
    }

    @Override
    public boolean isUnwrappableAs(Class clazz) {
        return false;
    }

    @Override
    public <T> T unwrap(Class<T> clazz) {
        return null;
    }

    @Override
    public Connection getAnyConnection() throws SQLException {
        final Connection connection = connectionProvider.getConnection();
        return connection;
    }

    @Override
    public Connection getConnection(String tenantIdentifier) throws SQLException {
        final Connection connection = getAnyConnection();
        try {
            connection.createStatement().execute("SET SCHEMA '" + tenantIdentifier + "'");
        }
        catch (SQLException e) {
            throw new HibernateException("Could not alter JDBC connection to specified schema [" + tenantIdentifier + "]", e);
        }
        return connection;
    }

    @Override
    public void releaseAnyConnection(Connection connection) throws SQLException {
        try {
            connection.createStatement().execute("SET SCHEMA 'public'");
        }
        catch (SQLException e) {
            throw new HibernateException("Could not alter JDBC connection to specified schema [public]", e);
        }
        connectionProvider.closeConnection(connection);
    }

    @Override
    public void releaseConnection(String tenantIdentifier, Connection connection) throws SQLException {
        releaseAnyConnection(connection);
    }
}
 The CurrentTenantIdentifierResolver class: import org.hibernate.context.spi.CurrentTenantIdentifierResolver;

public class SchemaResolver implements CurrentTenantIdentifierResolver {

    @Override
    public String resolveCurrentTenantIdentifier() {
        System.out.println("company1");
        return "company1"; //TODO: Implement service to identify tenant like: userService.getCurrentlyAuthUser().getTenantId();
    }

    @Override
    public boolean validateExistingCurrentSessions() {
        return false;
    }
}
 The persistence.xml file: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<persistence version="2.0"
    xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence/persistence_2_0.xsd">
    <persistence-unit name="testEJB">
        <jta-data-source>jdbc/testpgsql</jta-data-source>
        <properties>
            <property name="javax.persistence.provider" value="org.hibernate.ejb.HibernatePersistence" />

            <property name="hibernate.connection.username" value="postgres" />
            <property name="hibernate.connection.password" value="root" />
            <property name="hibernate.connection.url" value="jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/test" />

            <property name="hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto" value="create-drop" />
        </properties>
    </persistence-unit>
</persistence>
 And finally the DAO class: import java.util.List;

import javax.ejb.Stateless;
import javax.persistence.EntityManager;
import javax.persistence.PersistenceContext;

import com.neebal.domain.Person;

/**
 * Session Bean implementation class PersonDAO
 */
@Stateless
public class PersonDAO implements PersonDAOLocal {

    @PersistenceContext
    EntityManager entityManager;
    /**
     * Default constructor. 
     */
    public PersonDAO() {
        // TODO Auto-generated constructor stub
    }

    @Override
    public void save(Person person) {
        entityManager.persist(person);
    }

    @Override
    public List<Person> getAll() {

        Person person = entityManager.find(Person.class, 2L);
        System.out.println(person.getName());
        return null;
    }

}
 In this example I have hardcoded the schema as company1 but it still persists or retrieves the data from public schema. So where am I wrong in this example.
@CODE:public company1 company2 package com.neebal.domain;

        import java.io.Serializable;
        import java.lang.Long;
        import java.lang.String;

        @Entity

        //@Table(schema = "company1")
        public class Person implements Serializable {


    @Id
    private Long id;
    private String name;
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    public Person() {
        super();
    }   
    public Long getId() {
        return this.id;
    }

    public void setId(Long id) {
        this.id = id;
    }   
    public String getName() {
        return this.name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {

@CONTENT:I am working on an app where I have to use Yahoo account to login. I had gone through this link and followed the procedure as it was there.But I am unable to get back to my app after authentication.After googling I found an answer here.Here he said that "Add an URL Scheme in your info.plist file with the YOUR_APP_ID_OR_BUNDLE_ID" I did the same,but unable to redirect from yahoo to my app.If any one worked on this please help me.Thanks in advance. This is what I had done in my URL Schemes where JCzOzd44 is my app ID. In yahoo account while creating the app.what should I give in "Application Domain"

@TITLE:R - ggplot - stat_contour not able to generate contour lines
@CONTENT:I am trying to add contour lines via stat_contour() to my ggplot/ggplot2-plot. Unfortunately, I can not give you the real data from which point values should be evaluated. However, another easily repreducably example behaves the same: testPts <- data.frame(x=rep(seq(7.08, 7.14, by=0.005), 200))
testPts$y <- runif(length(testPts$x), 50.93, 50.96)
testPts$z <- sin(testPts$y * 500)

(ggplot(data=testPts, aes(x=x, y=y, z=z))
+ geom_point(aes(colour=z))
+ stat_contour()
)
 This results in the following error message: Error in if (nrow(layer_data) == 0) return() : argument is of length zero
In addition: Warning message:
Not possible to generate contour data 
 The example looks not different to others posted on stackoverflow or in the official manual/tutorial to me, and it seeminlgy doesn't matter if I provide more specifications to stat_contour. It seems, the function does not pass the data(-layer) as pointed ou tint the error message. Thank you for your ideas and advice!

@TITLE:How can I address an app that started earlier, but is ：Terminated due to Memory Pressure； now?
@CONTENT:I am working on an iOS app in Xcode. Earlier I got it to start and run, up to a limited level of functionality. Then there were compilation failures claiming untouched boilerplate generated code had syntax errors. Copying the source code into a new project gets a different problem. Right now, I can compile and start running, but it states before even the launch image shows up that the application was closed due to memory pressure. The total visual assets is around 272M, which could be optimized some without hurting graphical richness, and is so far the only area of the program expected to be large. (The assets may or may not be kept in memory; for instance every current loading image is populated and my code never accesses any loading image programmatically.) And it crashes before the loading image has itself loaded. How can I address this memory issue? I may be able to slim down the way images are handled, but I suspect there is another root cause. Or is this excessive memory consumption? Thanks,

So when one process is reading from or writing to file ABC.txt, file ABC.txt must be locked so that any other processes can not reading from or writing to it. I know the enum System.IO.FileShare may be the right way to handle this problem. But I used another way which I'm not sure if it is right. The following is my solution. I added another file Lock.txt to the folder. Before I can read from or write to file ABC.txt, I must have the capability to read from file Lock.txt. And after I have read from or written to file ABC.txt, I have to release that capability. The following is the code.         #region Enter the lock
        FileStream lockFileStream = null;
        bool lockEntered = false;
        while (lockEntered == false)

str = str.replace(/&#39;/g, "'"); $("body").html( $(body).html().replace(/\ａ/g,'$') )

@TITLE:Replace two dots in a string with gsub
@CONTENT:I'm trying to use the following code to replace two dots for only one: test<-"test..1"
gsub("\\..", ".", test, fixed=TRUE)
 and getting: [1] "test..1"
 I tried several combinations of escape strings, including brackets [] with no success. What am I doing wrong?

@TITLE:iOS UITableView sections with fetchedResultsController confusion
@CONTENT:I have an entity being displayed in a table view in just one section. The entity has two attributes, workoutName and trainingLevel. Both are of string type. Training level consists of the 3 types: 1, 2, 3. (trainingLevel = (Integer 16 or String Type? Which would be ideal?) I would like to split the table into three sections, each section containing entries for the corresponding training level. How do I do this? The code I am currently using is below: - (NSInteger)numberOfSectionsInTableView:(UITableView *)tableView
{
// Return the number of sections.
    return 1;
}

- (NSInteger)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView numberOfRowsInSection:(NSInteger)section
{
    // Return the number of rows in the section.
    return self.workoutType.workouts.count;
}
- (UITableViewCell *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath
{
    static NSString *CellIdentifier = @"Cell";
    UITableViewCell *cell =
    [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:CellIdentifier];
    if (cell == nil)
    {
        cell = [[UITableViewCell alloc] initWithStyle:UITableViewCellStyleSubtitle
                                  reuseIdentifier:CellIdentifier];
        cell.accessoryType = UITableViewCellAccessoryDisclosureIndicator;
    }


    WorkoutSet *workoutSet = [self.fetchedResultsController objectAtIndexPath:indexPath];


    cell.textLabel.text = workoutSet.workoutName;
    cell.detailTextLabel.text = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"(%d)", workoutSet.days.count];    
}

-(void)fetchWorkoutSets
{

    NSFetchRequest *fetchRequest = [NSFetchRequest fetchRequestWithEntityName:@"WorkoutSet"];
    NSPredicate *predicate = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@"workoutType = %@", self.workoutType];

    NSSortDescriptor *sortDescriptor = [NSSortDescriptor sortDescriptorWithKey:@"workoutName" ascending:YES];
    [fetchRequest setSortDescriptors:@[sortDescriptor]];
    [fetchRequest setPredicate:predicate];
    self.fetchedResultsController = [[NSFetchedResultsController alloc]
                                 initWithFetchRequest:fetchRequest managedObjectContext:self.managedObjectContext
                                 sectionNameKeyPath:nil cacheName:nil];

    NSError *error;
    if (![self.fetchedResultsController performFetch:&error])
    {
        NSLog(@"Fetch failed: %@", error);
    }
}
 What I am struggling with is: How to determine the number of rows for each section through the core data model by fetching number of entries with training level 1 or 2 or 3. How to fill the rows of each section by fetching the correct items. How to give a title to each section header.
@CODE:workoutName trainingLevel - (NSInteger)numberOfSectionsInTableView:(UITableView *)tableView
{
// Return the number of sections.
    return 1;
}

- (NSInteger)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView numberOfRowsInSection:(NSInteger)section
{
    // Return the number of rows in the section.
    return self.workoutType.workouts.count;
}
- (UITableViewCell *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath
{
    static NSString *CellIdentifier = @"Cell";
    UITableViewCell *cell =
    [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:CellIdentifier];
    if (cell == nil)
    {
        cell = [[UITableViewCell alloc] initWithStyle:UITableViewCellStyleSubtitle
                                  reuseIdentifier:CellIdentifier];
        cell.accessoryType = UITableViewCellAccessoryDisclosureIndicator;
    }


    WorkoutSet *workoutSet = [self.fetchedResultsController objectAtIndexPath:indexPath];


    cell.textLabel.text = workoutSet.workoutName;
    cell.detailTextLabel.text = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"(%d)", workoutSet.days.count];    
}

@TITLE:AngularJS regex route for similar url to load different controller and view
@CONTENT:I have a similar route that should load a different view and controller based on whether or not the parameter is a number. Example: /artists/2 should ArtistsIndexController with a view /www/artists/index.html /artists/name should ArtistsProfileController with a view /www/artists/profile.html Ideally I would use something like: $routeProvider.when("/artists/:page", {
  templateUrl: "/www/artists/index.html",
  controller: "ArtistsIndexController"
});

$routeProvider.when("/artists/:name", {
  templateUrl: "/www/artists/profile.html",
  controller: "ArtistsProfileController"
});
 Where :page is a number and :name is not. Note I see a related github issue (found from this question) but am wondering if there is a resolution or preferred solution.
@CODE:/artists/2 ArtistsIndexController /www/artists/index.html /artists/name ArtistsProfileController /www/artists/profile.html $routeProvider.when("/artists/:page", {
  templateUrl: "/www/artists/index.html",
  controller: "ArtistsIndexController"

@TITLE:manually trigger touch event
@CONTENT:I searched for the past 30 minutes, but didn't find a solution. I want to trigger a touchstart event on an element. This fires the touchstart event: var e = document.createEvent('MouseEvent');

e.initMouseEvent("touchstart", true, true, window, 1, screenX, screenY, clientX, clientY,
    ctrlKey, altKey, shiftKey, metaKey, button, relatedTarget);

target.dispatchEvent(e);
 Note that the variables are defined by my function But there's a problem with that. The event object doesn't have a touches property. So something like this won't work: var touch = e.touches[0];
 Is there a way to trigger a touchstart event manually (it should work on Android >= 4.0 and Chrome with touch enabled [DevTools]) ? Please note, that I do NOT want to use any framework like jQuery. With jQuery it's easy to create a touchevent on an element ;)
@CODE:touchstart touchstart var e = document.createEvent('MouseEvent');

e.initMouseEvent("touchstart", true, true, window, 1, screenX, screenY, clientX, clientY,
    ctrlKey, altKey, shiftKey, metaKey, button, relatedTarget);

target.dispatchEvent(e); event touches var touch = e.touches[0]; touchstart touchevent touchstart

@CONTENT:I'm following this how-to to modify the confirmation page after a successful sign up. https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/wiki/How-To:-Redirect-to-a-specific-page-on-successful-sign-up-(registration) I do everything like it says but i get this error: in `add_route': Invalid route name, already in use: 'new_user_session'  (ArgumentError)
You may have defined two routes with the same name using the `:as` option, or you may be overriding a route already defined by a resource with the same naming. For the latter, you can restrict the routes created with `resources` as explained here: 
http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html#restricting-the-routes-created
 I guess the wiki is not updated for using Devise with Rails 4, but i don't find around enough information to fix the error. The line which is returning the error is next (routes.rb): devise_for :users, :controllers => { :registrations => "registrations" }
 Any suggestion? Thanks. EDIT -- registrations_controller.rb class RegistrationsController < Devise::RegistrationsController

@LINK:/questions/19348477/multitenancy-with-hibernate-4-0-with-separate-schema-approach
@TITLE:MultiTenancy with Hibernate 4.0 with Separate Schema approach
@CONTENT:I am using EJB 3.0 and Hibernate 4 with PostgreSQL as my database server to create a multitenant system where each tenant will have separate but identical schema. I am still in the trial stage where I have 3 schemes public, company1, company2 all having a single table person. Now what i want to do is change the schema in runtime as per the user so that he can view the data of his/her company only. Here is my sample code: Entity Object:     package com.neebal.domain;

        import java.io.Serializable;
        import java.lang.Long;
        import java.lang.String;

        import javax.persistence.*;
        import org.eclipse.persistence.annotations.Multitenant;
        import org.eclipse.persistence.annotations.MultitenantType;

        @Entity

        //@Table(schema = "company1")
        public class Person implements Serializable {


    @Id
    private Long id;
    private String name;
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    public Person() {
        super();
    }   
    public Long getId() {
        return this.id;
    }

    public void setId(Long id) {
        this.id = id;
    }   
    public String getName() {
        return this.name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }  
}
 The MultiTenantConnectionProvider class: import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.SQLException;
import java.util.Map;

import org.hibernate.HibernateException;
import org.hibernate.service.config.spi.ConfigurationService;
import org.hibernate.service.jdbc.connections.internal.C3P0ConnectionProvider;

public class MultiTenantProvider implements MultiTenantConnectionProvider, ServiceRegistryAwareService  {

    private C3P0ConnectionProvider connectionProvider = null;

    @Override
    public boolean supportsAggressiveRelease() {

    }

    @Override

        final Connection connection = connectionProvider.getConnection();
        return connection;
    }

    @Override
    public Connection getConnection(String tenantIdentifier) throws SQLException {
        final Connection connection = getAnyConnection();
        try {
            connection.createStatement().execute("SET SCHEMA '" + tenantIdentifier + "'");
        }
        catch (SQLException e) {
            throw new HibernateException("Could not alter JDBC connection to specified schema [" + tenantIdentifier + "]", e);
        }
        return connection;
    }

    @Override
    public void releaseAnyConnection(Connection connection) throws SQLException {
        try {

    }

    @Override
    public void releaseConnection(String tenantIdentifier, Connection connection) throws SQLException {
        releaseAnyConnection(connection);
    }
}
 The CurrentTenantIdentifierResolver class: import org.hibernate.context.spi.CurrentTenantIdentifierResolver;

public class SchemaResolver implements CurrentTenantIdentifierResolver {

    @Override
    public String resolveCurrentTenantIdentifier() {
        System.out.println("company1");
        return "company1"; //TODO: Implement service to identify tenant like: userService.getCurrentlyAuthUser().getTenantId();
    }

    @Override
    public boolean validateExistingCurrentSessions() {
        return false;
    }
}
 The persistence.xml file: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<persistence version="2.0"
    xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"

            <property name="hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto" value="create-drop" />
        </properties>
    </persistence-unit>
</persistence>
 And finally the DAO class: import java.util.List;

import javax.ejb.Stateless;
import javax.persistence.EntityManager;
import javax.persistence.PersistenceContext;

import com.neebal.domain.Person;

/**
 * Session Bean implementation class PersonDAO
 */
@Stateless
public class PersonDAO implements PersonDAOLocal {

    @PersistenceContext
    EntityManager entityManager;
    /**
     * Default constructor. 
     */
    public PersonDAO() {
        // TODO Auto-generated constructor stub
    }

    @Override
    public void save(Person person) {
        entityManager.persist(person);
    }

    @Override
    public List<Person> getAll() {

        Person person = entityManager.find(Person.class, 2L);
        System.out.println(person.getName());
        return null;
    }

}
 In this example I have hardcoded the schema as company1 but it still persists or retrieves the data from public schema. So where am I wrong in this example.
@CODE:public company1 company2 package com.neebal.domain;

        import java.io.Serializable;
        import java.lang.Long;
        import java.lang.String;

        @Entity

        //@Table(schema = "company1")
        public class Person implements Serializable {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    public Person() {

    public Long getId() {

    }

    public void setId(Long id) {
        this.id = id;
    }   
    public String getName() {

@TITLE:R - ggplot - stat_contour not able to generate contour lines
@CONTENT:I am trying to add contour lines via stat_contour() to my ggplot/ggplot2-plot. Unfortunately, I can not give you the real data from which point values should be evaluated. However, another easily repreducably example behaves the same: testPts <- data.frame(x=rep(seq(7.08, 7.14, by=0.005), 200))
testPts$y <- runif(length(testPts$x), 50.93, 50.96)
testPts$z <- sin(testPts$y * 500)

(ggplot(data=testPts, aes(x=x, y=y, z=z))
+ geom_point(aes(colour=z))
+ stat_contour()
)
 This results in the following error message: Error in if (nrow(layer_data) == 0) return() : argument is of length zero
In addition: Warning message:
Not possible to generate contour data 
 The example looks not different to others posted on stackoverflow or in the official manual/tutorial to me, and it seeminlgy doesn't matter if I provide more specifications to stat_contour. It seems, the function does not pass the data(-layer) as pointed ou tint the error message. Thank you for your ideas and advice!

@TITLE:How can I address an app that started earlier, but is ：Terminated due to Memory Pressure； now?
@CONTENT:I am working on an iOS app in Xcode. Earlier I got it to start and run, up to a limited level of functionality. Then there were compilation failures claiming untouched boilerplate generated code had syntax errors. Copying the source code into a new project gets a different problem. Right now, I can compile and start running, but it states before even the launch image shows up that the application was closed due to memory pressure. The total visual assets is around 272M, which could be optimized some without hurting graphical richness, and is so far the only area of the program expected to be large. (The assets may or may not be kept in memory; for instance every current loading image is populated and my code never accesses any loading image programmatically.) And it crashes before the loading image has itself loaded. How can I address this memory issue? I may be able to slim down the way images are handled, but I suspect there is another root cause. Or is this excessive memory consumption? Thanks,

 Allows the view to be created, but I'm concerned that this is not showing all relevant data. How can I modify the view to work on redshift or is there an better/alternative way to view grants on redshift ? UPDATE: Redshift has the HAS_TABLE_PRIVILEGE function to check grants. (see here)

@LINK:/questions/18690537/multi-processes-readwrite-one-file
@TITLE:Multi processes read&write one file
@CONTENT:I have a txt file ABC.txt which will be read and wrote by multi processes. So when one process is reading from or writing to file ABC.txt, file ABC.txt must be locked so that any other processes can not reading from or writing to it. I know the enum System.IO.FileShare may be the right way to handle this problem. But I used another way which I'm not sure if it is right. The following is my solution. I added another file Lock.txt to the folder. Before I can read from or write to file ABC.txt, I must have the capability to read from file Lock.txt. And after I have read from or written to file ABC.txt, I have to release that capability. The following is the code.         #region Enter the lock
        FileStream lockFileStream = null;
        bool lockEntered = false;
        while (lockEntered == false)
        {
            try
            {
                lockFileStream = File.Open("Lock.txt", FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read, FileShare.None);
                lockEntered = true;
            }
            catch (Exception)
            {
                Thread.Sleep(500);
            }
        }
        #endregion

        #region Do the work
        // Read from or write to File ABC.txt
        // Read from or write to other files
        #endregion

        #region Release the lock
        try
        {
            if (lockFileStream != null)
            {
                lockFileStream.Dispose();
            }
        }
        catch
        {
        }
        #endregion
 On my computer, it seems that this solution works well, but I still can not make sure if it is appropriate.. Edit: Multi processes, not multi threads in the same process. (Sorry for my poor English)

@CONTENT:I'm wondering if there is a lightweight way I could use JavaScript or jQuery to sniff out a specific text character across a document; say ａ and find all instances of this character. And then! Write an ability to replace all instances of this with say a $. I found this snippet for starters: var str = 'test: &#39;';

str = str.replace(/&#39;/g, "'");
 Essentially; I am wanting a solution for a one page document. Grab all instances of X and make it XY. Only text characters.
@CODE:var str = 'test: &#39;';

str = str.replace(/&#39;/g, "'"); $("body").html( $(body).html().replace(/\ａ/g,'$') )

@TITLE:iOS UITableView sections with fetchedResultsController confusion
@CONTENT:I have an entity being displayed in a table view in just one section. The entity has two attributes, workoutName and trainingLevel. Both are of string type. Training level consists of the 3 types: 1, 2, 3. (trainingLevel = (Integer 16 or String Type? Which would be ideal?) I would like to split the table into three sections, each section containing entries for the corresponding training level. How do I do this? The code I am currently using is below: - (NSInteger)numberOfSectionsInTableView:(UITableView *)tableView
{
// Return the number of sections.
    return 1;
}

- (NSInteger)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView numberOfRowsInSection:(NSInteger)section
{
    // Return the number of rows in the section.
    return self.workoutType.workouts.count;
}

    static NSString *CellIdentifier = @"Cell";
    UITableViewCell *cell =
    [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:CellIdentifier];

@TITLE:AngularJS regex route for similar url to load different controller and view
@CONTENT:I have a similar route that should load a different view and controller based on whether or not the parameter is a number. Example: /artists/2 should ArtistsIndexController with a view /www/artists/index.html /artists/name should ArtistsProfileController with a view /www/artists/profile.html Ideally I would use something like: $routeProvider.when("/artists/:page", {
  templateUrl: "/www/artists/index.html",
  controller: "ArtistsIndexController"
});

$routeProvider.when("/artists/:name", {
  templateUrl: "/www/artists/profile.html",
  controller: "ArtistsProfileController"
});
 Where :page is a number and :name is not. Note I see a related github issue (found from this question) but am wondering if there is a resolution or preferred solution.
@CODE:/artists/2 ArtistsIndexController /www/artists/index.html /artists/name ArtistsProfileController /www/artists/profile.html $routeProvider.when("/artists/:page", {
  templateUrl: "/www/artists/index.html",
  controller: "ArtistsIndexController"

@TITLE:manually trigger touch event
@CONTENT:I searched for the past 30 minutes, but didn't find a solution. I want to trigger a touchstart event on an element. This fires the touchstart event: var e = document.createEvent('MouseEvent');

e.initMouseEvent("touchstart", true, true, window, 1, screenX, screenY, clientX, clientY,
    ctrlKey, altKey, shiftKey, metaKey, button, relatedTarget);

target.dispatchEvent(e);
 Note that the variables are defined by my function But there's a problem with that. The event object doesn't have a touches property. So something like this won't work: var touch = e.touches[0];
 Is there a way to trigger a touchstart event manually (it should work on Android >= 4.0 and Chrome with touch enabled [DevTools]) ? Please note, that I do NOT want to use any framework like jQuery. With jQuery it's easy to create a touchevent on an element ;)
@CODE:touchstart touchstart var e = document.createEvent('MouseEvent');

e.initMouseEvent("touchstart", true, true, window, 1, screenX, screenY, clientX, clientY,
    ctrlKey, altKey, shiftKey, metaKey, button, relatedTarget);

target.dispatchEvent(e); event touches var touch = e.touches[0]; touchstart touchevent touchstart

You may have defined two routes with the same name using the `:as` option, or you may be overriding a route already defined by a resource with the same naming. For the latter, you can restrict the routes created with `resources` as explained here: 
http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html#restricting-the-routes-created
 I guess the wiki is not updated for using Devise with Rails 4, but i don't find around enough information to fix the error. The line which is returning the error is next (routes.rb): devise_for :users, :controllers => { :registrations => "registrations" }
 Any suggestion? Thanks. EDIT -- registrations_controller.rb class RegistrationsController < Devise::RegistrationsController

dframe <- data.frame(val=rnorm(50))
p <- ggplot(dframe, aes(x=val, y=..count..))
p + geom_bar()
 It works just fine. However let's say that we want for some reason frequencies divided by an earler defined number. My shot would be: k <- 5
p <- ggplot(dframe, aes(x=val, y=..count../k))
p + geom_bar()
 However I get this annoying error: Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos) : object 'k' not found
 Does there exist a way for using both ..count..-like variables with some predefined ones?

@LINK:/questions/17806821/solr-composite-unique-key-from-existing-fields-in-schema
@TITLE:Solr Composite Unique key from existing fields in schema
@CONTENT:I have an index named LocationIndex in solr with fields as follows: <fields>
    <field name="solr_id" type="string" stored="true" required="true" indexed="true"/>
    <field name="solr_ver" type="string" stored="true" required="true" indexed="true" default="0000"/>
    // and some more fields
</fields>
<uniqueKey>solr_id</uniqueKey>
 But now I want to change schema so that unique key must be composite of two already present fields solr_id and solr_ver... something as follows: <fields>
    <field name="solr_id" type="string" stored="true" required="true" indexed="true"/>
    <field name="solr_ver" type="string" stored="true" required="true" indexed="true" default="0000"/>
    <field name="composite-id" type="string" stored="true" required="true" indexed="true"/>
    // and some more fields
</fields>
<uniqueKey>solr_ver-solr_id</uniqueKey>
 After searching I found that it's possible by adding following to schema: (ref: Solr Composite Unique key from existing fields in schema) <updateRequestProcessorChain name="composite-id">
  <processor class="solr.CloneFieldUpdateProcessorFactory">
    <str name="source">docid_s</str>
    <str name="source">userid_s</str>
    <str name="dest">id</str>
  </processor>
  <processor class="solr.ConcatFieldUpdateProcessorFactory">
    <str name="fieldName">id</str>
    <str name="delimiter">--</str>
  </processor>
  <processor class="solr.LogUpdateProcessorFactory" />
  <processor class="solr.RunUpdateProcessorFactory" />
</updateRequestProcessorChain>
 So I changed schema and finally it looks like: <updateRequestProcessorChain name="composite-id">
  <processor class="solr.CloneFieldUpdateProcessorFactory">
    <str name="source">solr_ver</str>
    <str name="source">solr_id</str>
    <str name="dest">id</str>
  </processor>
  <processor class="solr.ConcatFieldUpdateProcessorFactory">
    <str name="fieldName">id</str>
    <str name="delimiter">-</str>
  </processor>
  <processor class="solr.LogUpdateProcessorFactory" />
  <processor class="solr.RunUpdateProcessorFactory" />
</updateRequestProcessorChain>

<fields>
    <field name="solr_id" type="string" stored="true" required="true" indexed="true"/>
    <field name="solr_ver" type="string" stored="true" required="true" indexed="true" default="0000"/>
    <field name="id" type="string" stored="true" required="true" indexed="true"/>
    // and some more fields
</fields>
<uniqueKey>id</uniqueKey>
 But while adding a document it's giving me error: org.apache.solr.client.solrj.SolrServerException: Server at http://localhost:8983/solr/LocationIndex returned non ok status:400, message:Document [null] missing required field: id
 I'm not getting what changes in schema are required to work as desired? In a document I add, it contain fields solr_ver and solr_id. How and where it'll (solr) create id field by combining both these field something like solr_ver-solr_id? EDIT: At this link It's given how refer to this chain. Bu I'm unable to understand how would it be used in schema? And where should I make changes?
@CODE:LocationIndex <fields>

@CONTENT:I have a System.Windows.Forms.Panel with some content. I am trying to programmatically scroll the panel (vertically) either up or down. I have tried setting the AutoScrollPosition property to a new Point on the panel but that doesn't seem to do it. I have the AutoScroll property set to true.

This is what I am currently doing: //I have tried passing both positive and negative values.

@LINK:/questions/17510261/django-unique-together-constraint-failure
@TITLE:Django unique together constraint failure?
@CONTENT:Using Django 1.5.1. Python 2.7.3. I wanted to do a unique together constraint with a foreign key field and a slug field. So in my model meta, I did foreign_key = models.ForeignKey("self", null=True, default=None)
slug = models.SlugField(max_length=40, unique=False)

class Meta:
    unique_together = ("foreign_key", "slug")
 I even checked the table description in Postgres (9.1) and the constraint was put into the database table. -- something like
"table_name_foreign_key_id_slug_key" UNIQUE CONSTRAINT, btree (foreign_key_id, slug)
 However, I could still save into the database table a foreign_key of None/null and duplicate strings. For example, I could input and save # model objects with slug="python" three times; all three foreign_key(s) 
# are None/null because that is their default value
MO(slug="python").save()
MO(slug="python").save()
MO(slug="python").save()
 So after using unique_together, why can I still input three of the same valued rows? I'm just guessing right now that it might have to do with the default value of None for the foreign_key field, because before the unique_together, when I just had unique=True on slug, everything worked fine. So if that is the case, what default value should I have that indicates a null value, but also maintains the unique constraint?
@CODE:foreign_key = models.ForeignKey("self", null=True, default=None)
slug = models.SlugField(max_length=40, unique=False)

class Meta:
    unique_together = ("foreign_key", "slug") -- something like
"table_name_foreign_key_id_slug_key" UNIQUE CONSTRAINT, btree (foreign_key_id, slug) # model objects with slug="python" three times; all three foreign_key(s)

@CONTENT:I am using matplotlib.pyplot.annotate to draw an arrow on my plot, like so: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.annotate("",(x,ybottom),(x,ytop),arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle="->"))
 I want to use an arrow style that has a flat line at one end and an arrow at the other, so combining the styles "|-|" and "->" to make something we might call "|->", but I can't figure out how to define my own style. I thought I might try something like import matplotlib.patches as patches                                                                                                                                                                              
myarrow = patches.ArrowStyle("Fancy", head_length=0.4,head_width=0.2)
 (which should just be the same as "->" for now; I can tweak the style later) but then how do I tell plt.annotate to use myarrow as the style? There is no arrowstyle property for plt.annotate, and arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle=myarrow) doesn't work either. I've also tried defining it in the arrowprops dictionary, such as plt.annotate("",(x,ybottom),(x,ytop),arrowprops=dict(head_length=0.4,head_width=0.2))
 but that gives me errors about no attribute 'set_head_width'. So, how can I define my own style for pyplot.annotate to use?
@CODE:import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.annotate("",(x,ybottom),(x,ytop),arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle="->")) import matplotlib.patches as patches

@CONTENT:I'm just starting to get my feet wet learning the technical details of Azure, so apologies if this is a silly question. If I create a cloud service project in visual studio and add a webrole for an mvc application, within the mvc application I can see the "WebRole.cs" file. However, when I start with an MVC application as the starting point, and later want to enable it for Azure, by right clicking on the project and selecting "Add Windows Azure Cloud Service Project", no WebRole.cs is created. So where would I go to make things happen on the start event of the WebRole? The Application_Start() event of the Global.asax file? If so, what's the difference between Application_Start() in Global.asax and the onStart() method of a webrole? I've found the following post, which offers a partial explanation: What starts first Application_Start or WebRole's OnStart? So if it's a case that the onStart event of the WebRole occurs before the Application_Start() in Global.asax, what happens if I want to run some code on the onStart() event in a project where I've later enabled the app for Azure?

Deleting the entire project including contents on disk, cloning and deleting the .settings folder before importing. Same result. Deleting the entire project including contents on disk, cloning and importing just for grins. Same result. Scoured through the .project file. Nothing of interest. Double checked ant.properties, build.xml and every other plain text readable file for clues. Nothing of interest. Googled the problem and double checked the Eclipse and ADT bug sites for known issues. Nada. Verified on the file system that the file does, in fact, have the correct setting after cloning and that the import is the culprit. Deleting the entire project including contents on disk, cloning, MANUALLY editing the project.properties file to android-14, importing. This resulted in an unchanged project.properties file but since I'm using the Google APIs for mapping this is unacceptable. I just verified that I can "fix" the project after it's imported. Delete the project from Eclipse but leaving the contents on disk. Importing the project incorrectly edits project.properties again. The import process does not recognize the Google APIs entries in project.properties. This is how I'm getting the project from the file system into Eclipse: Thoughts?

 What isn't clear to me from the documentation is whether the calculated load address is an element address or a byte address, i.e. is the load address for element i: load_addr = base + index[i] * scale;               // (1) element addressing ?
 or: load_addr = (char *)base + index[i] * scale;       // (2) byte addressing ?
 From the Intel docs it looks like it might be (2), but this doesn't make much sense given that the smallest element size for gathered loads is 32 bits - why would you want to load from misaligned addresses (i.e. use scale < 4) ?

@CONTENT:I'm trying to parse an extremely big json-File on an iPad. The filesize will vary between 50 and 100 mb (there is an initial file and there will be one new full set of data every month, which will be downloaded, parsed and saved into coredata) I'm building this app for a company as an Enterprise solution - the json file contains sensitive customerdata and it needs to be saved locally on the ipad so it will work even offline. It worked when the file was below 20mb, but now the set of data became bigger and I really need to parse it. I'm receiving memory warnings during parsing and after the third warning it just crashes. I have several different Core Data entities and I'm just setting all the values coming from the json file (when app is launched for the first time) and after everything is done, I'm doing the [context save]. I was hoping somebody could give me some advice on how to handle such huge files. I was thinking about splitting the json file up to several smaller json files and maybe parsing them in multiple threads, but I don't know if that's the right approach. I guess one big problem is that the whole file is being held in the memory - maybe there's some way of "streaming" it into the memory or something like that? I'm using JSONKit (https://github.com/johnezang/JSONKit) for parsing the file, since I have read that it's the fastest one (maybe there's a slower one which goes easier on memory?).

@LINK:/questions/15705895/defaultt-with-empty-collection-instead-of-null
@TITLE:default(T) with empty collection instead of null
@CONTENT:I'd like to have generic method which returns default value for passed type, but for collection type I'd like to get empty collection instead of null, for example: GetDefault<int[]>(); // returns empty array of int's
GetDefault<int>(); // returns 0
GetDefault<object>(); // returns null
GetDefault<IList<object>>(); // returns empty list of objects
 The method I started to write is following: public static T GetDefault<T>()
{
   var type = typeof(T);
   if(type.GetInterface("IEnumerable") != null))
   {
      //return empty collection
   }
   return default(T);   
}
 How to complete it ? EDIT: If anyone would like get default value of some type, based on type instance instead of type identifier, this construction below can be used, i.e.: typeof(int[]).GetDefault();
 The implementation is internally based on @280Z28 answer: public static class TypeExtensions
{
    public static object GetDefault(this Type t)
    {
        var type = typeof(Default<>).MakeGenericType(t);
        var property = type.GetProperty("Value", BindingFlags.Static | BindingFlags.Public);
        var getaccessor = property.GetGetMethod();
        return getaccessor.Invoke(null, null);
    }
}
@CODE:GetDefault<int[]>(); // returns empty array of int's
GetDefault<int>(); // returns 0
GetDefault<object>(); // returns null

 And there is a imageButton                     button = (ImageButton) findViewById(R.id.imageButton1);
        button.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            public void onClick(View v)  {
                if (bIcon == false) {

                    m = myMap.addMarker(new MarkerOptions().position(myMap.getCameraPosition().target).draggable(true));                     
                    LinearLayout linLayout = (LinearLayout)findViewById(R.id.lay);
                    t = (TextView)findViewById(R.id.locinfo);                      
                    linLayout.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);

                                bIcon = true;
                }
                else {
                    button.setImageResource(R.drawable.plus_grey);                                             
                    m.remove();
                    LinearLayout linLayout = (LinearLayout)findViewById(R.id.lay);
                    t.setVisibility(View.INVISIBLE);
                    linLayout.setVisibility(View.INVISIBLE);

            }
        });
 I want to programmatically add LinearLayout.LayoutParams lp = new LinearLayout.LayoutParams((w*2)/3, LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT);
 where w display = getWindowManager().getDefaultDisplay(); 
@SuppressWarnings("deprecation")
w = display.getWidth();
 But when I do like this                 button.setImageResource(R.drawable.plus_yellow);                                                                   
                m = myMap.addMarker(new MarkerOptions().position(myMap.getCameraPosition().target).draggable(true));                     
                LinearLayout linLayout = (LinearLayout)findViewById(R.id.lay);
                LinearLayout.LayoutParams lp = new LinearLayout.LayoutParams((w*2)/3, LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT);
                linLayout.setLayoutParams(lp);
                t = (TextView)findViewById(R.id.locinfo);                      
                linLayout.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);
                t.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);                      
                bIcon = true;
 My application crashes. Can you please tell how to programmatically create with my parameters (tied with the width and height of the screen of the device)? I will take any suggestions. Thank you.

@LINK:/questions/14695065/quickbooks-online-querying-with-filter-returns-401-everytime
@TITLE:QuickBooks Online querying with filter returns 401 everytime
@CONTENT:I've had success creating objects with POST and Content-Type application/xml I've also had success querying using Content-Type application/x-www-form-urlencoded with a blank request body which returns all of the object type depending on which URI I specify. I can also get the same to work with something like PageNum=1&ResultsPerPage=1 in the request body and I have figured out how to incorporate that into the signature so I get a valid response. However no matter how I format it, I cannot get anything other than a 401 response when I try to use a filter (something basic like Filter=FAMILYNAME :EQUALS: Doe). I've read over the OAuth Core 1.0 Revision A specifications on how all parameter names and values are escaped using the [RFC3986] percent-encoding. However I feel like I'm missing a step or formatting incorrectly. I've seen inconsistent information in my searching through Intuit's forums on what exactly is the proper format. Any help on this would be greatly appreciated. I've been struggling with this for a good week now. The response I get when trying to use a filter is: HTTP Status 401 - message=Exception authenticating OAuth; errorCode=003200; statusCode=401 ----Update---- I'm am seeing the same error when I try to use filters with the New IPP Developer Tools - IPP API Explorer. I'm using the IDS V2 QBO API Explorer. I'm able to use that tool to do a retrieve all Post and the response shows all of my customers, but when I try to use a filter I get : Server Error 401 - Unauthorized: Access is denied due to invalid credentials. You do not have permission to view this directory or page using the credentials that you supplied. Any Ideas? If I'm getting the same error from the API Explorer tool, it makes me think the problem is something else entirely. ----Final Update---- I have finally had success with filters and I believe I have figure out what my problem was. I was always suspicious that I was able to get queries with pagination like "PageNum=1&ResultsPerPage=1" to work, but could not get something like "Filter=FAMILYNAME :EQUALS: Doe". I suspected there problem was with the white space in the filter format. What threw me off tracking this down earlier was that I could not get the filters to work in the IDS V2 QBO API Explorer. That made me suspect there was something else going on. I decided to ignore the API Explorer all together and focus on why I could get it to work the one way but no the other. I believe my problem came down to improper encoding of the Filter's value in the signature. That explains the 401 invalid signature errors I was getting. "Filter=Name :EQUALS: Doe" becomes "Filter=Name%20%3AEQUALS%20%3ADoe" after normalization. Percent-Encoding that should give "Filter%3DName%2520%253AEQUALS%2520%253ADoe". In essence you have to "double" encode the blank space and the colons, but not the equal sign. I tried many permutations of doing the encoding, but believe my mistake was that I was either not "double" encoding, or when I was double encoding I was including the '=' sign. Either way breaks your signature. Thanks for everyone's input.

@TITLE:Connecting to MS SQL Server from R on Mac/Linux
@CONTENT:I'm trying to connect to an Microsoft SQL Server from R on Mac/Linux, and I have problems with RJDBC. When I've downloaded both Microsoft's driver and JTDS, but none of the following lines work: library(RJDBC)

drv <- JDBC("com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver",
            "/Users/victor/Downloads/sqljdbc_3.0/enu/sqljdbc4.jar") 

drv1 <- JDBC('net.sourceforge.jtds.jdbc.Driver',

 Each one return the following error message: Error in .jfindClass(as.character(driverClass)[1]) : class not found
 I suspect the issue may be with the wrong Java version: my default java is $ java -version
java version "1.7.0_11"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_11-b21)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 23.6-b04, mixed mode)
 but I also have Jave 1.6 installed on my machine. I have SquirrelSQL installed and it connect to MS SQL Server without any problem using JTDS driver; the Java version that SquirrelSQL runs under is 1.7.0.11. I have run R CMD javareconf with the following result: $ R CMD javareconf

 and removed/installed again RJDBC and rJava packages, and still nothing works. I guess I'm stuck right now, as I'm not very familiar with Java/RJDBC and their interaction. Searching google found several people with similar problems by no solution. Any tips on how to make JDBC behave, or any other way to connect to MS SQL Server from R, will be highly appreciated! UPDATE 1. Well, the first statement seems to work now - I'm getting a connection and can query the database without any problems. Not sure what fixed the problem - may be I needed to restart my mac/R session. The second statement still doesn't work, with the same error message.

@CONTENT:I'm trying to code a loadbalancing with node.js and http-proxy. I want a loadBalancer which share incoming request treatment between 2 servers. var http = require('http'),
httpProxy = require('http-proxy');

 var servers =  [{host :'127.0.0.1', port :3000}, {host : 'remote_adr',port :3000}];

  httpProxy.createServer(function (req, res, proxy) {

  var target = servers.shift();
  proxy.proxyRequest(req, res, target);
  servers.push(target);


   }).listen(8000);
 I thought that doing this, it would have made a loadBalancer which send requests alternately to serv1 and to serv2. However, when I try it out, it seems to request the 2 servers in no particular order. In addition most of the requests are sent to my localhost node server ( 127.0.0.1:3000 ) Is somebody able to explain that behavior ? Thx a lot, Florent.

@TITLE:eclipse workspaces sync settings - what to sync?
@CONTENT:I know it has come up time and again but my specific question is : I have multiple workspaces using the wpt, cdt and jdt extensions (and others). I want to create hard links (I am on windows) from all my workspaces to a subset of settings files that govern things like shortcuts, workspace preferences etc. This way when I, for instance, change a shortcut in one workspace the change will propagate to all other workspaces. Problem is the .metadata/.plugins folder is a complete mess (I believe the settings are all there). For instance I know that I have to link the files : <workspace>\.metadata\.plugins\org.eclipse.core.runtime\.settings\org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs
<workspace>\.metadata\.plugins\org.eclipse.core.runtime\.settings\org.eclipse.jdt.ui.prefs
 I believe I should not try to link the whole .metadata/.plugins folder as it contains workspace-specific data. Would it be safe and enough to hardlink the \.metadata\.plugins\org.eclipse.core.runtime\.settings directory ? Can someone point me to some documentation as to what are all those.index and .dat binary files inside \.metadata\.plugins\ ? If this is not possible I would appreciate at least a reference for the various .prefs files inside \.metadata\.plugins\*\.settings directories, especially the .metadata\.plugins\org.eclipse.core.runtime\.settings one Thanks

@LINK:/questions/13084849/how-to-always-show-the-plotline-in-highcharts
@TITLE:How to always show the plotLine in HighCharts?
@CONTENT:I am creating a HighChart with a plotLine in it. The plotLine has a fixed value, while the data can vary between charts. HighChart scales the y-axis automatically based on the maximum value of data, but it doesn't consider the plotLine's value in its calculations. Hence, if the data range encompasses the plotLine value, the plotLine gets shown, but gets cropped out of the viewport if not. Example: $(function () {
    $(document).ready(function() {
        var chart = new Highcharts.Chart({
            chart: {
                renderTo: 'container',
                type: 'column'
            },
            title: {
                text: 'Dummy Data by Region'
            },
            xAxis: {
                categories: ['Africa', 'America', 'Asia']
            },
            yAxis: {
                plotLines:[{
                    value:450,
                    color: '#ff0000',
                    width:2,
                    zIndex:4,
                    label:{text:'goal'}
                }]
            },
            series: [{

                data: [107, 31, 650]
            }]
        });
    });

});?
 JSFiddle for above code: http://jsfiddle.net/4R5HH/3/ The goal line (in red) is shown for the default data, but if I change the data to [107, 31, 250], then the plotLine goes out of the graph viewport and hence becomes invisible.
@CODE:$(function () {
    $(document).ready(function() {
        var chart = new Highcharts.Chart({
            chart: {

I have been able to send ZPL print jobs to it perfectly fine, but I cannot seem to get it to print unicode characters, such as cyrillic letters. I have downloaded the lucida sans unicode font to the printer using the Seagull Scientific drivers and I am using the following ZPL code to test: ^XA

^FT0,100^B3^FDAAA001^FS
^XZ
 It will print the 'Testing 1 2 3' and the barcode, but it leaves a blank space instead of the cyrillic characters. Am I doing something wrong like not escaping characters or something or is it a problem with the printer? Thanks in advance EDIT: I tried using the Zebra swiss unicode font and now it prints the russian characters as question marks. I've updated the code above to reflect it.

I have neither found this option in the help entry for install.packages nor googling for it. If this option does not exist, is there any reason for that?. I can only think that not all repos have all versions so you are forced to find the version first and download it.

@TITLE:How to force logout user when his/her username is changed by another user?
@CONTENT:In my application I am using Forms-Authentication to sign in and sign out users. One functionality is admin can change the username of other users. In that case, I need to sign out the user whose username is changed. If I do not, due to their cookies set before, they gain access to application and receive error messages (since their username does not exist and there are parts where I use their username for some functionality). How can I force these users to log out using Forms-Authentication ? UPDATE :     public override void OnActionExecuting(ActionExecutingContext filterContext)
    {
        string controller = filterContext.RouteData.Values["controller"].ToString();
        string action     = filterContext.RouteData.Values["action"].ToString(); ;
        // Below returns the previous username, which does not exist anymore in db.
        string userName = HttpContext.Current.User.Identity.Name;

        UnitOfWork unitOfWork = new UnitOfWork();

        if (!unitOfWork.UserRepository.UserExists(userName))
        {
            FormsAuthentication.SignOut();
            filterContext.HttpContext.Session.Clear();
            filterContext.HttpContext.Session.Abandon();
            // I am not using Roles.


        }
        unitOfWork.Dispose();
        base.OnActionExecuting(filterContext);

    }
 In my customer global filter, I check whether user exist or not, if not I sign them out. However, it is not working. By working I mean they pass the authentication and gain access to application. Thanks in advance.
@CODE:public override void OnActionExecuting(ActionExecutingContext filterContext)
    {
        string controller = filterContext.RouteData.Values["controller"].ToString();
        string action     = filterContext.RouteData.Values["action"].ToString(); ;
        // Below returns the previous username, which does not exist anymore in db.
        string userName = HttpContext.Current.User.Identity.Name;

@CONTENT:var a = 1;
var b = Number(1);
var c = new Number(1);
 I was wondering what is the difference between these three statements. I understand that first and second statements are same, as if(a===b) gives true, but the third one will create a object of type number. What I want to know is how these methods are different, and any advantages one will give over the other?

@TITLE:How do I get Spring MVC to invoke validation in a JUnit test?
@CONTENT:I have a POJO called Browser that I've annotated with Hibernate Validator annotations. import org.hibernate.validator.constraints.NotEmpty;

public class Browser {

    @NotEmpty
    private String userAgent;
    @NotEmpty
    private String browserName;

...

}
 I've written the following unit test that tries to verify my Controller method catches validation errors. @Test
public void testInvalidData() throws Exception {
    Browser browser = new Browser("opera", null);
    MockHttpServletRequest request = new MockHttpServletRequest();

    BindingResult errors = new DataBinder(browser).getBindingResult();
    // controller is initialized in @Before method
    controller.add(browser, errors, request);
    assertEquals(1, errors.getErrorCount());
}
 Here's my Controller's add() method: @RequestMapping(value = "/browser/create", method = RequestMethod.POST)
public String add(@Valid Browser browser, BindingResult result, HttpServletRequest request) throws Exception {
    if (result.hasErrors()) {
        request.setAttribute("errorMessage", result.getAllErrors());
        return VIEW_NAME;
    }

    browserManager.save(browser);

    request.getSession(false).setAttribute("successMessage",
            String.format("Browser %s added successfully.", browser.getUserAgent()));

    return "redirect:/" + VIEW_NAME;
}
 The problem I'm experiencing is that result never has errors, so it's like @Valid isn't getting recognized. I tried adding the following to my test class, but it doesn't solve the problem. @RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class)
@ContextConfiguration({"file:path-to/WEB-INF/spring-mvc-servlet.xml"})
 Does anyone know how I'd get @Valid to be recognized (and validated) when testing with JUnit? Thanks, Matt

@CONTENT:I can blend two textures with different blending modes in the fragment shader when both the textures covers the same rectangles.

@LINK:/questions/12231789/cancel-blocking-accepttcpclient-call
@TITLE:Cancel blocking AcceptTcpClient call
@CONTENT:As everyone may already know, the simplest way to accept incoming TCP connections in C# is by looping over TcpListener.AcceptTcpClient(). Additionally this way will block code execution until a connection is obtained. This is extremely limiting to a GUI, so I want to listen for connections in either a seperate thread or task. I have been told, that threads have several disadvantages, however nobody explained me what these are. So instead of using threads, I used tasks. This works great, however since the AcceptTcpClient method is blocking execution, I can't find any way of handling a task cancellation. Currently the code looks like this, but I have no idea how I would want to cancel the task when I want the program to stop listening for connections. First off the function executed in the task: static void Listen () {
// Create listener object
TcpListener serverSocket = new TcpListener ( serverAddr, serverPort );

// Begin listening for connections
while ( true ) {
    try {
        serverSocket.Start ();
    } catch ( SocketException ) {
        MessageBox.Show ( "Another server is currently listening at port " + serverPort );
    }

    // Block and wait for incoming connection
    if ( serverSocket.Pending() ) {
        TcpClient serverClient = serverSocket.AcceptTcpClient ();
        // Retrieve data from network stream
        NetworkStream serverStream = serverClient.GetStream ();
        serverStream.Read ( data, 0, data.Length );
        string serverMsg = ascii.GetString ( data );
        MessageBox.Show ( "Message recieved: " + serverMsg );

        // Close stream and TcpClient connection
        serverClient.Close ();
        serverStream.Close ();

        // Empty buffer
        data = new Byte[256];
        serverMsg = null;
    }
}
 Second, the functions starting and stopping the listening service: private void btnListen_Click (object sender, EventArgs e) {
    btnListen.Enabled = false;
    btnStop.Enabled = true;
    Task listenTask = new Task ( Listen );
    listenTask.Start();
}

private void btnStop_Click ( object sender, EventArgs e ) {
    btnListen.Enabled = true;
    btnStop.Enabled = false;
    //listenTask.Abort();
}
 I just need something to replace the listenTask.Abort() call (Which I commented out because the method doesn't exist)
@CODE:static void Listen () {
// Create listener object
TcpListener serverSocket = new TcpListener ( serverAddr, serverPort );

// Begin listening for connections
while ( true ) {
    try {
        serverSocket.Start ();
    } catch ( SocketException ) {
        MessageBox.Show ( "Another server is currently listening at port " + serverPort );
    }

    // Block and wait for incoming connection
    if ( serverSocket.Pending() ) {
        TcpClient serverClient = serverSocket.AcceptTcpClient ();
        // Retrieve data from network stream
        NetworkStream serverStream = serverClient.GetStream ();
        serverStream.Read ( data, 0, data.Length );
        string serverMsg = ascii.GetString ( data );
        MessageBox.Show ( "Message recieved: " + serverMsg );

        // Close stream and TcpClient connection
        serverClient.Close ();
        serverStream.Close ();

        // Empty buffer
        data = new Byte[256];
        serverMsg = null;
    }
} private void btnListen_Click (object sender, EventArgs e) {
    btnListen.Enabled = false;
    btnStop.Enabled = true;
    Task listenTask = new Task ( Listen );
    listenTask.Start();
}

private void btnStop_Click ( object sender, EventArgs e ) {
    btnListen.Enabled = true;
    btnStop.Enabled = false;
    //listenTask.Abort();
}

@TITLE:Find all references to an object in python
@CONTENT:What is a good way to find all of the references to an object in python? The reason I ask is that it looks like we have a "memory leak". We are uploading image files to the server from a web browser. Each time we do this, the memory usage goes up on the server goes up proportionately to the size of the file that was just uploaded. This memory is never getting released by the python garbage collection, so I'm thinking that there are probably stray references pointing to the image data that are not getting deleted or going out of scope, even at the end of each request. I figure it would be nice to be able to ask python: "What references are still pointing to this memory?" so that I can figure out what is keeping the garbage collection from freeing it. Currently we are running Python and Django on a Heroku server. Any suggestions and ideas are appreciated, thanks so much!

@TITLE:Extracting off-diagonal slice of large matrix
@CONTENT:I've got a large nxn matrix and would like to take off-diagonal slices of varying sizes. For example: 1 2 3 4 5 6
1 2 3 4 5 6
1 2 3 4 5 6
1 2 3 4 5 6
1 2 3 4 5 6
1 2 3 4 5 6
 I'd like an R function which, when given the matrix and "width of diagonal slice" would return an nxn matrix of just those values. So for the matrix above and, say, 3, I'd get: 1 x x x x x
1 2 x x x x
1 2 3 x x x
x 2 3 4 x x
x x 3 4 5 x
x x x 4 5 6
 At the moment I'm using (forgive me) a for loop which is incredibly slow: getDiags<-function(ndiags, cormat){
  resmat=matrix(ncol=ncol(cormat),nrow=nrow(cormat))
  dimnames(resmat)<-dimnames(cormat)
  for(j in 1:ndiags){
    resmat[row(resmat) == col(resmat) + j] <- 
      cormat[row(cormat) == col(cormat) + j]
  }
  return(resmat)
}
 I realise that this is a very "un-R" way to go about solving this problem. Is there a better way to do it, probably using diag or lower.tri?

@TITLE:Solve small symmetric positive definite Ax = b on GPU only
@CONTENT:I'm attempting to optimise an application in realtime 3D modelling. The compute part of the application runs almost entirely on the GPU in CUDA. The application requires the solution of a small (6x6) double precision symmetric positive definite linear system Ax = b 500+ times per second. Currently this is being done with an efficient CPU based Linear Algebra library using Cholesky but necessitates the copying of data from the CPU - GPU and back to GPU hundreds of times per second and the overhead of kernel launches each time etc. How can I calculate the solution to the linear system on the GPU solely without having to take the data onto the CPU at all? I've read a little about the MAGMA library but it seems to use hybrid algorithms rather than GPU only algorithms. I'm prepared for the fact that the solution of an individual linear system on the GPU is going to be a lot slower than with the existing CPU based library but I want to see if that can be made up for by removing the data communication between the host and device and the overhead of kernel launches etc hundreds of times per second. If there is no GPU only LAPACK-like alternative out there how would I go about implementing something to solve this particular 6x6 case on the GPU only? Could it be done without a huge time investment with GPU BLAS libraries for example?

@TITLE:Corebluetooth central manager callback didDiscoverPeripheral twice
@CONTENT:I scan for my peripheral like this: NSDictionary *scanOptions = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObject:[NSNumber numberWithBool:NO] 
                                                            forKey:CBCentralManagerScanOptionAllowDuplicatesKey];
        // Scan for peripherals with given UUID
        [cm scanForPeripheralsWithServices:[NSArray arrayWithObject:HeliController.serviceUUID] options:scanOptions]
 No problem there, I find the peripheral and are able to connect to it. As you can see I give it CBCentralManagerScanOptionAllowDuplicatesKey with bool NO to not allow for more than one peripheral, but sometimes the didDiscoverPeripheralcallback fires twice. - (void) centralManager:(CBCentralManager *)central 
  didDiscoverPeripheral:(CBPeripheral *)peripheral 
  advertisementData:(NSDictionary *)advertisementData 
               RSSI:(NSNumber *)RSSI

    [cm stopScan];

    [scanButton setTitle:@"Connect" forState:UIControlStateNormal];
}
else if(discovered){
    discovered = YES
    NSLog(@"Already discovered");
}
}
 Some times I get Discovered
Already discovered
 as output in my console, and most of the times only the Discoveredmessage shows. In my peripheral delegate I first discover services, which then call [peripheral discoverCharacteristics and the callback always occurs: - (void) peripheral:(CBPeripheral *)peripheral didDiscoverCharacteristicsForService:(CBService *)service error:(NSError *)error{

NSLog(@"Did discover characteristic for service %@", [service.peripheral UUID]);

for(CBCharacteristic *c in [service characteristics]){
    // We never get here when peripheral is discovered twice
    if([[c UUID] isEqual:myCharacteristicUUID]){

        NSLog(@"Found characteristic");

        self.throttleCharacteristic = c;

    }
}
 When didDiscoverPeripheral occur twice, service becomes nilin this method, even though peripheral is not (UUID, name is still correct). Rebooting the phone or resetting the network settings fixes the problem temporarily. I really need to get this fixed! Thank you

   alert("hello");
   }); $(document) checkbox $(document).on('change', 'input[name="ohneiln"]', function() {
   alert("hello");
}); $(document).on() change

@TITLE:How to use custom icons with mapKit framework?
@CONTENT:I am using the MapKit framework to load google maps on my application and I place on map 4 "simulated" places like this: - (void)viewDidLoad {

[super viewDidLoad];

mapView.delegate = self;

mapView.showsUserLocation = YES;

MKUserLocation *userLocation = mapView.userLocation;

MKCoordinateRegion region =
MKCoordinateRegionMakeWithDistance (userLocation.location.coordinate,500,500);
[mapView setRegion:region animated:NO];

//Simulated annotations on the map
CLLocationCoordinate2D poi1Coord , poi2Coord , poi3Coord , poi4Coord;
//poi1 coordinates
poi1Coord.latitude = 37.78754;
poi1Coord.longitude = -122.40718;
//poi2 coordinates
poi2Coord.latitude = 37.78615;
poi2Coord.longitude = -122.41040;
//poi3 coordinates
poi3Coord.latitude = 37.78472;
poi3Coord.longitude = -122.40516;
//poi4 coordinates
poi4Coord.latitude = 37.78866;
poi4Coord.longitude = -122.40623;

poi1.title = @"McDonald's";
poi1.subtitle = @"Best burgers in town";
poi2.title = @"Apple store";
poi2.subtitle = @"Iphone on sales..";
poi3.title = @"Microsoft";
poi3.subtitle = @"Microsoft's headquarters";

poi4.subtitle = @"You got mail!";

[mapView addAnnotation:poi1];
[mapView addAnnotation:poi2];
[mapView addAnnotation:poi3];
[mapView addAnnotation:poi4];    
 } The code is fairly simple. What i want to do is instead of using the typical red pin on my google map , use my own images to show different places. Is there a simple/straightforward way to do that, cause I got much confused from the samples I already found.
@CODE:- (void)viewDidLoad {

[super viewDidLoad];

mapView.delegate = self;

mapView.showsUserLocation = YES;

MKUserLocation *userLocation = mapView.userLocation;

MKCoordinateRegion region =
MKCoordinateRegionMakeWithDistance (userLocation.location.coordinate,500,500);

@TITLE:Sticking Div to Top After Scrolling Past it
@CONTENT:Right now, I'm able to stick the div to the top after it scrolls down 320px but I wanted to know if there is another way of achieving this. Below I have my code: jQuery(function($) {
    function fixDiv() {
        if ($(window).scrollTop() > 320) { 
            $('#navwrap').css({ 'position': 'fixed', 'top': '0', 'width': '100%' }); 
        }
        else {
            $('#navwrap').css({ 'position': 'static', 'top': 'auto', 'width': '100%' });
        }
    }
    $(window).scroll(fixDiv);
    fix5iv();
});
 it works, but some divs above it will not always be the same height so I can't rely on the 320px. How do I get this to work without using if ($(window).scrollTop() > 320) so I can get it to fade in at the top after the user scrolls past the div #navwrap?
@CODE:div 320px jQuery(function($) {
    function fixDiv() {
        if ($(window).scrollTop() > 320) { 
            $('#navwrap').css({ 'position': 'fixed', 'top': '0', 'width': '100%' }); 
        }
        else {
            $('#navwrap').css({ 'position': 'static', 'top': 'auto', 'width': '100%' });
        }
    }
    $(window).scroll(fixDiv);

}); divs 320px if ($(window).scrollTop() > 320) div #navwrap

@CONTENT:(I'm on Windows.) I want to use PyInstaller. I could always create bin files with pyinstaller.py [args]. It's not a package with an __init__.py file, it has no setup.py and it doesn't work to create a folder, put it in my PYTHONPATH, put pyinstaller\[files] in that folder and then make a call to python pyinstaller\pyinstaller.py. pyinstaller.org only tells me something with Configure.py.

@CONTENT:I have the following two types of multiline textareas in my views: <textarea cols="100" rows="15" class="full-width" id="dialogText"

<textarea cols="100" rows="10" class="full-width" id="dialogText" 
          name="Text">@Model.Text</textarea> 
 I would like to take advantage of custom editor templates, but keep the ability to specify attributes differently (e.g. the rows are different between the two above). Is it possible for me to declare and use two different kinds of templates for the same field? If so then how should I declare the template and how do I specify the different templates to use? Also how can I declare the different cols and rows. Can I use cols,rows or should I specify height and width in CSS such as width=500px, height=600px or 400px?
@CODE:<textarea cols="100" rows="15" class="full-width" id="dialogText"

@TITLE:Does thread.yield() lose the lock on object if called inside a synchronized method?
@CONTENT:I understand that Thread.currentThread().yield() is a notification to thread scheduler that it may assign cpu cycle to some other thread of same priority if any such is present. My question is: If current thread has got lock on some object and calls yield(), will it loses that lock right away? And when thread scheduler finds out there is no such thread to assign cpu cycle, then the thread which has called yield() will again be in fight to get lock on the object which it has lost earlier?? I couldn't find it in javadoc and forums [http://www.coderanch.com/t/226223/java-programmer-SCJP/certification/does-sleep-yield-release-lock] have 50-50 answers. I think yield() (lets say thread1) should release lock because if some thread (lets say thread2) of same priority wants to operate on same object, then it can have chance when thread scheduler eventually assign cup to thread2.

@CONTENT:I'm trying to work out the order that cipher suites are returned using SSLSocketFactory.getSupportedCipherSuites() - it seems to differ between Java 1.6 & Java 1.7. I thought this would be easy to determine but have run into a few problems. Firth tho, the code I'm using: SSLContext context = SSLContext.getDefault();
SSLSocketFactory sf = context.getSocketFactory();
String[] cipherSuites = sf.getSupportedCipherSuites();
 Pretty straight forward (do correct me if I've done something stupid). So, I thought (using eclipse) that I'd be able to step into the getSupportedCipherSuites() method, but it seems the source code isn't there to do that (is there a reason for that?). I found the class in jsse.jar and decompiled it using JD-Eclipse. This however gives me an abstract class and I've not been able to see the concrete implementation of the abstract class (I've discovered that the class can be set using a property "ssl.SocketFactory.provider" but this hasn't been specified in java.security). I've also not been able to determine how to turn logging on using the "javax.net.debug" property (this disappears into a native method). Could someone point out where I'm going wrong?

@TITLE:ActionBarSherlock + Maps + Loaders = java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError
@CONTENT:Edit: For a detailed how-to, check out my answer. I'm struggling with it for two days now, hope someone can help. I'm trying to use the newest ActionBarSherlock (4.0) with a MapView. I knew it's problematic with fragments, but I don't need them in this activity. But I need Loaders and it appears, that to use Loaders I have to extend the FragmentActivity too. No problem, I thought, we have the android-support-v4-googlemaps from Pete Doyle. As suggested on many SO threads and Google Groups I build the ABS with android-support-v4-googlemaps JAR (android-support-v13-r7-googlemaps.jar actually) instead of android-support-v4.jar. Then I used it as a library for my project. Now, I would like to have my activity this way: public class BananoutMapActivity extends SherlockFragmentActivity implements LoaderCallbacks<ArrayList<EventItem>>{ The problem: It compiles, but throws a runtime error: E/AndroidRuntime(29159): java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: ndl.klimczak.bananout.BananoutMapActivity Things I've triple checked: both ActionBarSherlock library project and my project are targeted at Google APIs 4.0.3 I have <uses-library android:name="com.google.android.maps" /> and I have it in the application tag. I also have the same android-support-v13-r7-googlemaps.jar in the build path of my project I have .BananoutMapActivity declared in my manifest What is interesting: When I run it on an ICS emulator it works (the error appears on 2.* emulators and my 2.3.7 device), on Honeycomb it would work too probably, it's the question of using the ACL I guess When I remove the implements LoaderCallbacks<ArrayList<EventItem>> part it works too, but this way I'm not able to use LoaderManager Why on earth the NoClassDefFoundError error and how to get the Loaders working in my MapCapableSherlockEnabledFragmentActivity?

@TITLE:Copy target file to another location in a post build step in CMake
@CONTENT:I have a dynamic library that gets a different name depending on configuration, specified in the CMake scripts by: set_target_properties(${name} PROPERTIES OUTPUT_NAME ${outputName}64)
set_target_properties(${name} PROPERTIES DEBUG_OUTPUT_NAME ${outputName}64_d)
 The end result is that I get a different name on release and debug builds. I would like to copy the resulting library to a different directory as a post-build step, but the gift(?) of CMake-Fu did not smile upon yours truly. I have tried doing this: GET_TARGET_PROPERTY(origfile mylibrary LOCATION)
STRING(REGEX REPLACE "/" "\\\\" origfile ${origfile})

STRING(REGEX REPLACE "/" "\\\\" targetfile ${targetfile})

 This works fine for release builds, but for debug the source does not include the _d that I would have expected. How do I get the output path for the target so that I can copy the file? Note: As can be seen from the above snippet, this is currently for Windows/Visual Studio, but I would like this to work on OS X / Xcode / make as well. Note: I need the library to be placed in an extra directory that serves as the output directory for several other projects that depend on this library, so that these projects are able to load the library at runtime. An alternative solution that would be acceptable would be to be able to create a custom target that does the copying, so that the other projects can depend on this project, which in turn depends on the library.

@TITLE:How to use TextBox.Watermark in Silverlight 4?
@CONTENT:While browsing MSDN documentation, you may come across this gem: TextBox.Watermark. "Awesome! I've been wanting a built-in way to do watermarking on my text boxes! This is great, let me go ahead and set that in XAML!" <TextBox Watermark="This is my watermark" Margin="20"></TextBox>
 Unfortunately, if you run this you won・t get what you expect: And the detail: What is this? Well, look at the MSDN documentation closely: That's right. It's supported in Silverlight 4, but it also says "Do not use in a Silverlight 4 application". If you do use it, you receive a System.NotImplemented exception. To verify, here is the code for the property decompiled via Reflector: [EditorBrowsable(EditorBrowsableState.Never)]
public object Watermark
{
get
{
StubHelper.ThrowIfNotInDesignMode();
return base.GetValue(WatermarkProperty);
}
set
{
StubHelper.ThrowIfNotInDesignMode();
base.SetValue(WatermarkProperty, value);
}
}
 There it is V it throws an exception any time it's not in design mode. This makes no sense right? Why would Microsoft do this? Unfortunately I haven't found any definitive answer yet, however if I had to guess it's because Microsoft is planning on implementing a Watermark behavior on the TextBox control in a future version (perhaps v5) and wanted to effectively reserve this property so third party control creators don't subclass TextBox and create their own Watermark property. I know of at least one control vendor, ComponentOne, who has a control that inherits from TextBox and provides a Watermark property. To me, it seems this is Microsoft's way of discouraging people from using this property name on their own TextBox subclasses.
@CODE:<TextBox Watermark="This is my watermark" Margin="20"></TextBox> [EditorBrowsable(EditorBrowsableState.Never)]

@CONTENT:I'm developing an image warping iOS app with OpenGL ES 2.0. I have a good grasp on the setup, the pipeline, etc., and am now moving along to the math. Since my experience with image warping is nil, I'm reaching out for some algorithm suggestions. Currently, I'm setting the initial vertices at points in a grid type fashion, which equally divide the image into squares. Then, I place an additional vertex in the middle of each of those squares. When I draw the indices, each square contains four triangles in the shape of an X. See the image below: After playing with photoshop a little, I noticed adobe uses a slightly more complicated algorithm for their puppet warp, but a much more simplified algorithm for their standard warp. What do you think is best for me to apply here / personal preference? Secondly, when I move a vertex, I'd like to apply a weighted transformation to all the other vertices to smooth out the edges (instead of what I have below, where only the selected vertex is transformed). What sort of algorithm should I apply here?

$jQuery.ajax({
         type: "POST", /* this goesn't work with GET */

 The problem is that the browser locks and does not append the loading image until AFTER the ajax call is done which is useless of course. Firefox is the only browser that actually appends the loading image. IE, Chrome, and Safari DO NOT append the loading image. I know browser locking happens because async is set to false but this is my only option because I have to wait for this request to complete before continuing because I need the data that is returned. Is there any way around this? If I place an alert after the I append the loading image that works but I don't want an alert popping up every time.

@TITLE:min-height/min-width doesn't respect box-sizing in some browsers
@CONTENT:See this example: http://jsfiddle.net/vrgT3/5/ I made a 250x250px parent div with overflow: auto; so scrollbars appear when the content overflows the box. I have set a blue background to make it clear when the parent is visible. Inside the parent is a child div with red background for visibility. It has 8px black borders and box-sizing: border-box; so padding and borders are included in computing the size of the box. The child div is set to min-height: 100% and min-width: 100%. Expected result: Child div should be the exact same size as the parent, so no blue is shown and no scrollbars appear. The computed box size (content+padding+borders) should be 250x250px. There should be 8px black borders inlaying this, leaving a 234x234px red region. Works with: Midori 4.1 Ubuntu Chromium 16 Ubuntu Opera 11.61 Ubuntu Issues with: IE 8 WinXP: Horizontal and vertical scrollbars appear. The content is 249x266px with 8px borders giving a computed box size of 265x282px. Firefox 3.6 WinXP: Vertical scrollbar appears. The content is 217x250px and computed box size is 233x266px. Firefox 10 Ubuntu: Vertical scrollbar appears, content is 221x250px, computed box size is 237x266px. I have checked caniuse.com and it appears that at least the browsers in question support the required min-height, min-width, and box-sizing. What gives? Solution: As Marat suggested, this is indeed a browser bug. I've resolved a workaround utilizing JavaScript to add padding/margins to correct for differences in offsetWidth/Height. See it here: http://jsfiddle.net/vrgT3/8/

 Yes, for now, the need is to simply find the rows where "a" starts with the entered text. I want to bring the speed of look up down to under 100 ms (the appearance of instantaneous). Suggestions? Seems to me that full text search won't help here as my column of text is too short, but I would be happy to try that if worthwhile. Oh, btw I also loaded the exact same data in mongodb and indexed column "a". Loading the data in mongodb was amazingly quick (mongodb++). Both mongodb and Postgres are pretty much instantaneous when doing exact lookups. But, Postgres actually shines when doing trailing wildcard searches as above, consistently taking about 1/3 as long as mongodb. I would be happy to pursue mongodb if I could speed that up as this is only a readonly operation. Update: First, a couple of EXPLAIN ANALYZE outputs EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT a, b, c FROM t WHERE a LIKE 'abcd%'

"Seq Scan on t  (cost=0.00..282075.55 rows=802 width=40) 
    (actual time=1220.132..1220.132 rows=0 loops=1)"
"  Filter: ((a)::text ~~ 'abcd%'::text)"
"Total runtime: 1220.153 ms"
 I actually want to compare Lower(a) with the search term which is always at least 4 characters long, so EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT a, b, c FROM t WHERE Lower(a) LIKE 'abcd%'

"Seq Scan on t  (cost=0.00..302680.04 rows=40612 width=40) 
    (actual time=4.681..3321.387 rows=788 loops=1)"
"  Filter: (lower((a)::text) ~~ 'abcd%'::text)"
"Total runtime: 3321.504 ms"
 So I created an index CREATE INDEX idx_t ON t USING btree (Lower(Substring(a, 1, 4) ));

"Seq Scan on t  (cost=0.00..302680.04 rows=40612 width=40) 
    (actual time=3243.841..3243.841 rows=0 loops=1)"
"  Filter: (lower((a)::text) = 'abcd%'::text)"
"Total runtime: 3243.860 ms"
 Seems the only time an index is being used is when I am looking for an exact match EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT a, b, c FROM t WHERE a = 'abcd'

"Index Scan using idx_t on geonames  (cost=0.00..57.89 rows=13 width=40) 
    (actual time=40.831..40.923 rows=17 loops=1)"
"  Index Cond: ((ascii_name)::text = 'Abcd'::text)"
"Total runtime: 40.940 ms"
 Found a solution by implementing an index with varchar_pattern_ops, and am now looking for an even quicker lookups.

"  Filter: ((a)::text ~~ 'abcd%'::text)"

@TITLE:Bash subshell/pipelines - which parts are executing in subshells?
@CONTENT:In a comment on another post, @JonathanLeffler stated that: { ... } | somecommand is run in a sub-shell and doesn't affect the parent shell. Demo: X=PQR; echo $X; { X=ABC; echo $X; } | cat; echo $X (with output PQR, ABC, PQR on three lines) and indeed: james@bodacious-wired:tmp$X=PQR; echo $X; { X=ABC; echo $X; } | cat; echo $X
PQR
ABC
PQR
 However, man bash says that { .. } does not execute in a subshell:    { list; }
          list  is  simply executed in the current shell environment.  list must be 
          terminated with a newline or semicolon.  This is known as a group command. 
 So what's going on here? Is man bash wrong? I know that each part of a pipeline executes in a subshell; but I don't see how that causes the observed behaviour. For instance: james@bodacious-wired:tmp$X=PQR; echo $X | sed;  X=ABC; echo $X | sed; echo $X
PQR
ABC
ABC
 Edited to add: A few people have suggested using echo $$ to show that things are (or are not) parts of a subshell. This is not at all useful, as the $$ gets expanded during the parameter expansion stage, which happens long before any commands are executed. As an example: james@bodacious-wired:tmp$echo 1$$; ps; ( echo 2$$; ps ); echo 3$$; ps
11194
  PID TTY           TIME CMD
 1194 ttys000    0:00.22 -bash
21194
  PID TTY           TIME CMD
 1194 ttys000    0:00.22 -bash
 7894 ttys000    0:00.00 -bash
31194
  PID TTY           TIME CMD
 1194 ttys000    0:00.22 -bash
james@bodacious-wired:tmp$
 You can see that the second invocation of ps happened inside a subshell, with pid 7894; but echo 2$$ still shows the value that bash substituted in the variable expansion phase, before it spawned the subshell For contrast, and demonstrating that { .. } does not spawn a subshell: james@bodacious-wired:tmp$echo 1$$; ps; { echo 2$$; ps; }; echo 3$$; ps
11194
  PID TTY           TIME CMD
 1194 ttys000    0:00.22 -bash
21194
  PID TTY           TIME CMD
 1194 ttys000    0:00.22 -bash
31194
  PID TTY           TIME CMD
 1194 ttys000    0:00.23 -bash
 Just to prove that @nos is correct, add a pipeline to the above: james@bodacious-wired:tmp$echo 1$$; ps; { echo 2$$; ps; } | sed ; echo 3$$; ps
11194
  PID TTY           TIME CMD
 1194 ttys000    0:00.25 -bash
21194
  PID TTY           TIME CMD
 1194 ttys000    0:00.25 -bash
 7945 ttys000    0:00.00 -bash

31194
  PID TTY           TIME CMD
 1194 ttys000    0:00.25 -bash
 As expected, the shell spawns two subshells, one for each side of the pipeline.
@CODE:X=PQR; echo $X; { X=ABC; echo $X; } | cat; echo $X james@bodacious-wired:tmp$X=PQR; echo $X; { X=ABC; echo $X; } | cat; echo $X
PQR

@TITLE:What is the return type of a constructor in java?
@CONTENT:As we know that we do not have to add any return type to a Java constructor. class Sample{
  .....
  Sample(){
    ........
  }
}
 In Objective C, if we create a constructor, it returns a pointer to its class. But it is not compulsory, I think. AClass *anObject = [[AClass alloc] init];//init is the constructor with return type a pointer to AClass
 Similarly, Is the constructor converted to a method which return a reference to its own class?? Like this: class Sample{
    .....
    Sample Sample(){
      ........

      return this;
    }
}
 Does the compiler add a return type a reference to same class to constructor? What is happening to a constructor? Any reference to study this? EDIT: Actually i want the answers to be at byte code level or JVM level or even below.
@CODE:class Sample{
  .....
  Sample(){
    ........
  }
} AClass *anObject = [[AClass alloc] init];//init is the constructor with return type a pointer to AClass class Sample{

end complex;
 I executed this in SQL Developer using the following statement begin
complex('SomeValue');

 It worked fine, and the value was inserted into the table. However, the above statements are not supported in the Data Analysis tool, so I resorted to use a function instead. The following is the code of the function, it compiles. create or replace

return 'done';
end supercomplex;

@TITLE:：Cannot unregister UpdatePanel with ID 'xxx' since it was not registered with the ScriptManagerK ； in RadGrid while editing record
@CONTENT:Let me cut to the chase. My scenario is as follows: I have custom added fields to filter the RadGrid and filtering works perfectly. The problem comes when I want to edit record using EditForm inside RadGrid. It used to work fine, but then I had some problems with selecting the right row (I was always getting the wrong row selected) so this is what I did to fix it. So, my RadGrid with filters looks like this: What I did is to use the Session which will help us to determine later if the filtered RadGrid DataSource was initiated or it was the default one. protected void btnSearch_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    Session["SearchKontakti"] = "1";
}
 After that I had to set PreRender with if loop to check for previously mentioned Session. protected void gvKontakti_PreRender(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    int idKontakt = Convert.ToInt32(Request.QueryString["idk"]);

    if (Session["SearchKontakti"] == "1")
    {
        var kontakti = from k in db.Kontakt
                       select k;

        int idTipUsera = Convert.ToInt32(rcbTipUsera.SelectedValue);
        int idTvrtka = Convert.ToInt32(rcbTvrtka.SelectedValue);

        if (rcbTvrtka.SelectedValue != "0")
        {
            kontakti = kontakti.Where(k => k.idFirma == idTvrtka);
        }

        if (rcbTipUsera.SelectedValue != "0")
        {
            kontakti = kontakti.Where(k => k.idOvlasti == idTipUsera);
        }

        if (chkAktivan.Checked == true)
        {
            kontakti = kontakti.Where(k => k.Aktivan == true);

        else
        {
            kontakti = kontakti.Where(k => k.Aktivan == false);
        }

        int idAuthKontakt = Convert.ToInt32(Session["authenticatedUI"]);

        if (idKontakt > 0 && idAuthKontakt == idKontakt)
        {
            gvKontakti.DataSource = from k in kontakti
                                    where k.idKontakt == idKontakt

        else if (idKontakt > 0 && idAuthKontakt != idKontakt)
        {
            gvKontakti.DataSource = from k in kontakti
                                    where k.idKontakt == idKontakt

        }

        gvKontakti.DataBind();
    }
}
 So, this fixed my primary problem, but gave me another one. Some of my UserControls contain UpdatePanel and for each UserControl that has it whenever I try to clik Edit button from the RadGrid I receive the following message: "Cannot unregister UpdatePanel with ID 'UpdatePanel4' since it was not registered with the ScriptManager. This might occur if the UpdatePanel was removed from the control tree and later added again, which is not supported. Parameter name: updatePanel" What I'd like to know is how to fix it.

@CONTENT:I'm building a Chrome extension using the Remember the Milk web API. In order to call methods in this API, I need to sign my requests using an API key and a "shared secret" key. My concern is that any user could just crack open the extension and pull out these values if I include them in the published extension. This may or may not pose a security rise for the user, but he or she could certainly use/abuse my API key and maybe get it revoked. Is this something I should be concerned about? Are there any best practices for protecting this type of information in published JavaScript applications?

@TITLE:Qt GUI Development - Displaying a 2D grid using QGraphicsView
@CONTENT:I'm new to Qt development so I've being trying to research a solution to a user interface I need to design. My project is to simulate players in an online game moving around a global map. To represent the map I need to display a 2D grid, with each space in the grid representing a region of a map. I then need to display the location of each player in the game. The back-end is all fully working, with the map implemented as a 2D array. I'm just stuck on how to display the grid. The research I have done has led me to believe a QGraphicsView is the best way to do this, but I can't seem to find a tutorial relevant to what I need. If anyone has any tips on how to implement this it would be much appreciated. Thanks, Dan

@CONTENT:I am using a Data Analysis tool and the requirement I have was to accept a value from the user, pass that as a parameter and store it in a table. Pretty straighforward so I sat to write this create or replace
procedure complex(datainput in VARCHAR2)

insert into dumtab values (datainput);
end complex;
 I executed this in SQL Developer using the following statement begin
complex('SomeValue');  
end;
 It worked fine, and the value was inserted into the table. However, the above statements are not supported in the Data Analysis tool, so I resorted to use a function instead. The following is the code of the function, it compiles. create or replace
function supercomplex(datainput in VARCHAR2)
return varchar2
is
begin
insert into dumtab values (datainput);
return 'done';
end supercomplex;   
 Once again I tried executing it in SQL Developer, but I got cannot perform a DML operation inside a query upon executing the following code select supercomplex('somevalue') from dual;
 My question is - I need a statement that can run the mentioned function in SQL Developer or - A function that can perform what I am looking for which can be executed by the select statement. - If it is not possible to do what I'm asking, I would like a reason so I can inform my manager as I am very new (like a week old?) to PL/SQL so I am not aware of the rules and syntaxes. P.S. How I wish this was C++ or even Java :( EDIT I need to run the function on SQL Developer because before running it in DMine (which is the tool) in order to test if it is valid or not. Anything invalid in SQL is also invalid in DMine, but not the other way around. Thanks for the help, I understood the situation and as to why it is illegal/not recommended

@TITLE:：Cannot unregister UpdatePanel with ID 'xxx' since it was not registered with the ScriptManagerK ； in RadGrid while editing record
@CONTENT:Let me cut to the chase. My scenario is as follows: I have custom added fields to filter the RadGrid and filtering works perfectly. The problem comes when I want to edit record using EditForm inside RadGrid. It used to work fine, but then I had some problems with selecting the right row (I was always getting the wrong row selected) so this is what I did to fix it. So, my RadGrid with filters looks like this: What I did is to use the Session which will help us to determine later if the filtered RadGrid DataSource was initiated or it was the default one. protected void btnSearch_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    Session["SearchKontakti"] = "1";
}
 After that I had to set PreRender with if loop to check for previously mentioned Session. protected void gvKontakti_PreRender(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    int idKontakt = Convert.ToInt32(Request.QueryString["idk"]);

    if (Session["SearchKontakti"] == "1")
    {
        var kontakti = from k in db.Kontakt
                       select k;

        int idTipUsera = Convert.ToInt32(rcbTipUsera.SelectedValue);
        int idTvrtka = Convert.ToInt32(rcbTvrtka.SelectedValue);

        if (rcbTvrtka.SelectedValue != "0")
        {
            kontakti = kontakti.Where(k => k.idFirma == idTvrtka);
        }

        if (rcbTipUsera.SelectedValue != "0")
        {
            kontakti = kontakti.Where(k => k.idOvlasti == idTipUsera);
        }

        if (chkAktivan.Checked == true)
        {
            kontakti = kontakti.Where(k => k.Aktivan == true);

        else
        {
            kontakti = kontakti.Where(k => k.Aktivan == false);
        }

        int idAuthKontakt = Convert.ToInt32(Session["authenticatedUI"]);

        if (idKontakt > 0 && idAuthKontakt == idKontakt)
        {
            gvKontakti.DataSource = from k in kontakti
                                    where k.idKontakt == idKontakt

        {

                                    where k.idKontakt == idKontakt

@CONTENT:I'm building a Chrome extension using the Remember the Milk web API. In order to call methods in this API, I need to sign my requests using an API key and a "shared secret" key. My concern is that any user could just crack open the extension and pull out these values if I include them in the published extension. This may or may not pose a security rise for the user, but he or she could certainly use/abuse my API key and maybe get it revoked. Is this something I should be concerned about?

@TITLE:Qt GUI Development - Displaying a 2D grid using QGraphicsView
@CONTENT:I'm new to Qt development so I've being trying to research a solution to a user interface I need to design. My project is to simulate players in an online game moving around a global map. To represent the map I need to display a 2D grid, with each space in the grid representing a region of a map. I then need to display the location of each player in the game. The back-end is all fully working, with the map implemented as a 2D array. I'm just stuck on how to display the grid. The research I have done has led me to believe a QGraphicsView is the best way to do this, but I can't seem to find a tutorial relevant to what I need. If anyone has any tips on how to implement this it would be much appreciated. Thanks, Dan

@TITLE:c# Public Nested Classes or Better Option?
@CONTENT:I have a control circuit which has multiple settings and may have any number of sensors attached to it (each with it's own set of settings). These sensors may only be used with the control circuit. I thought of using nested classes like so: public class ControlCircuitLib

    private Settings controllerSettings;
    private List<Sensor> attachedSensors;

    // Properties.
    public Settings ControllerSettings
    { get { return this.controllerSettings; } }

    { get { return this.attachedSensors; } }

    // Constructors, methods, etc.
    ...

    // Nested classes.
    public class Settings
    {
       // Fields.
       private ControlCircuitLib controllerCircuit;
       private SerialPort controllerSerialPort;
       private int activeOutputs;
       ... (many, many more settings)

       // Properties.
       public int ActiveOutputs
       { get { return this.activeOutputs; } }
       ... (the other Get properties for the settings)

       // Methods.
       ... (method to set the circuit properties though serial port)        
    }

    public class Sensor
    {
       // Enumerations.
       public enum MeasurementTypes { Displacement, Velocity, Acceleration };

       // Fields.
       private ControlCircuitLib controllerCircuit;
       private string sensorName;
       private MeasurementTypes measurementType;
       private double requiredInputVoltage;
       ... (many, many more settings)

       // Properties.
       public string SensorName {...}
       ... (Get properties)

       // Methods.
       ... (methods to set the sensor settings while attached to the control circuit)
    }
}
 I have read that public nested classes are a "no-no" but that there are exceptions. Is this structure OK or is there a better option? Thanks! EDIT Below is a crude hierarchy of the control circuit for which I am trying to write a library class for; I used code formatting to prevent text-wrap. Control Circuit (com. via serial port) -> Attached Sensors (up to 10) -> Sensor Settings (approx. 10 settings per sensor)
                                          Basic Controller Settings (approx. 20 settings)
                                          Output Settings (approx. 30 settings)
                                          Common Settings (approx. 30 settings)
                                          Environment Settings (approx. 10 settings)
 All of the settings are set through the controller but I would like an organized library instead of just cramming all ~100 methods, properties, and settings under one Controller class. It would be HUGELY appreciated if someone could offer a short example outlining the structure they would use. Thanks!

@TITLE:php foreach, why using pass by reference of a array is fast?
@CONTENT:Below is a test of php foreach loop of a big array, I thought that if the $v don't change, the real copy will not happen because of copy on write, but why it is fast when pass by reference? Code 1: function test1($a){
  $c = 0;
  foreach($a as $v){ if($v=='xxxxx') ++$c; }
}

function test2(&$a){
  $c = 0;
  foreach($a as $v){ if($v=='xxxxx') ++$c; }
}

$x = array_fill(0, 100000, 'xxxxx');

$begin = microtime(true);
test1($x);
$end1 = microtime(true);
test2($x);
$end2 = microtime(true);

echo $end1 - $begin . "\n";   //0.03320002555847
echo $end2 - $end1;           //0.02147388458252
 But this time, using pass by reference is slow. Code 2: function test1($a){
  $cnt = count($a); $c = 0;
  for($i=0; $i<$cnt; ++$i)
    if($a[$i]=='xxxxx') ++$c;
}
function test2(&$a){
  $cnt = count($a); $c = 0;
  for($i=0; $i<$cnt; ++$i)
    if($a[$i]=='xxxxx') ++$c;
}
$x = array_fill(0, 100000, 'xxxxx');

$begin = microtime(true);
test1($x);
$end1 = microtime(true);
test2($x);
$end2 = microtime(true);

echo $end1 - $begin . "\n";   //0.024326801300049
echo $end2 - $end1;           //0.037616014480591
 Can someone explain why passing by reference is fast in code1 but slow in code2? Edit: With Code 2, the count($a) makes the main difference, so the time of the loop took is almost the same.
@CODE:$v function test1($a){
  $c = 0;
  foreach($a as $v){ if($v=='xxxxx') ++$c; }
}

function test2(&$a){
  $c = 0;

@TITLE:When should I use NSURL instead of NSString and vice versa?
@CONTENT:This is not a question about a pertinent problem. It's a question by which I try to deepen my understanding of Objective-C or more specific Cocoa Foundation. When dealing with uploading and download files from a server to my apps, I'm constantly torn between using NSURL or NSString for all things path related. Of course when there's an existing API I just use it according to the specs. But when I store my own paths or create custom classes that deal with them, I'm confused which of the two would be the better pick. NSString is used everywhere and it has convenience methods like stringByAppendingPathComponent: and stringByAppendingPathExtension:. I can easily convert to NSURL by creating a new instance with [NSURL URLWithString:@"string"] and the other way around by calling [url path] on an NSURL instance. But the difference is there for a reason, right? My confusion grows when I look at header files of something like NSFileManager. These two methods are pretty close together: - (BOOL)copyItemAtPath:(NSString *)srcPath toPath:(NSString *)dstPath error:(NSError **)error;
- (BOOL)copyItemAtURL:(NSURL *)srcURL toURL:(NSURL *)dstURL error:(NSError **)error NS_AVAILABLE(10_6, 4_0);
 Why would I choose to use one over the other, especially when conversions between the two are made so easily? And why does Apple go through the trouble of creating near-identical APIs for using both data types? If someone has the deeper insight for when to use NSURL instead of NSString for your own classes handling file paths and remote urls, please do share! Cheers.
@CODE:NSURL NSString NSString stringByAppendingPathComponent: stringByAppendingPathExtension: [NSURL URLWithString:@"string"] [url path] - (BOOL)copyItemAtPath:(NSString *)srcPath toPath:(NSString *)dstPath error:(NSError **)error;
- (BOOL)copyItemAtURL:(NSURL *)srcURL toURL:(NSURL *)dstURL error:(NSError **)error NS_AVAILABLE(10_6, 4_0); NSURL NSURL NSString NSFileManager

@TITLE:How to view permissions for RSA Key Container
@CONTENT:I've created an RSA Machine-Store container as a non-administrator, and assigned Full Control to myself, as well as read access to other accounts. I want to be able to programatically view the ACL for the key container. When I attempt to do so with the code below, I get the following exception even though I am owner of the key container and have Full Control: System.Security.AccessControl.PrivilegeNotHeldException: The process does not possess the 'SeSecurityPrivilege' privilege which is required for this operation.
   at System.Security.AccessControl.Privilege.ToggleState(Boolean enable)
   at System.Security.Cryptography.Utils.GetKeySetSecurityInfo(SafeProvHandle hProv, AccessControlSections accessControlSections)
   at System.Security.Cryptography.CspKeyContainerInfo.get_CryptoKeySecurity()
   ...
 I can view the privileges by using Windows Explorer or CACLS to view the key file in C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\...\Crypto\RSA\MachineKeys, so it appears that my account has the required privilege. The code I'm using is as follows: CspParameters cp = new CspParameters();
cp.Flags = CspProviderFlags.NoPrompt | CspProviderFlags.UseExistingKey | CspProviderFlags.UseMachineKeyStore;
cp.KeyContainerName = containerName;

using (RSACryptoServiceProvider rsa = new RSACryptoServiceProvider(cp))
{
    // PrivilegeNotHeldException thrown at next line while
    // dereferencing CspKeyContainerInfo.CryptoKeySecurity
    if (rsa.CspKeyContainerInfo.CryptoKeySecurity != null)
    {
        foreach (CryptoKeyAccessRule rule in rsa.CspKeyContainerInfo.CryptoKeySecurity.GetAccessRules(true, true, typeof(System.Security.Principal.NTAccount)))
        {
           ... process rule
        }
    }
}
 There's a question with a similar problem here, but I can't see any way to apply the answer to my situation. According to MSDN, the CspKeyContainerInfo.CryptoKeySecurity property: Gets a CryptoKeySecurity object that represents access rights and audit rules for a container. I want an object that represents access rights but not audit rules (as I don't have the privilege for audit rules). UPDATE I've found a workaround, which is to locate the file containing the key container and inspect its ACL. I'm not entirely happy with this as it depends on undocumented implementation details of the cryptography classes (e.g. presumably wouldn't work on Mono), and would still be interested in a better solution. ... Initialize cp as above

CspKeyContainerInfo info = new CspKeyContainerInfo(cp);
string path = Path.Combine(Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.CommonApplicationData), 
    "Microsoft\\Crypto\\RSA\\MachineKeys\\" + info.UniqueKeyContainerName);

@TITLE:Stream video from ffmpeg and capture with OpenCV
@CONTENT:I have a video stream coming in on rtp to ffmpeg and I want to pipe this to my OpenCV tools for live streaming processing. The rtp linkage is working because I am able to send the incoming data to a file and play it (or play if via ffplay). My OpenCV implementation is functional as well because I am able to capture video from a file and also a webcam. The problem is the streaming to OpenCV. I have heard that this may be done using a named pipe. First I could stream the ffmpeg output to the pipe and then have OpenCV open this pipe and begin processing. What I've tried: I make a named-pipe in my cygwin bash by:     $ mkfifo stream_pipe
 Next I use my ffmpeg command to pull the stream from rtp and send it to the pipe:     $ ffmpeg -f avi -i rtp://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:1234 -f avi -y out.avi > stream_pipe
 I am not sure if this is the right way to go about sending the stream to the named pipe but it seems to be accepting the command and work because of the output from ffmpeg gives me bitrates, fps, and such. Next I use the named pipe in my OpenCV capture function:     $ ./cvcap.exe stream_pipe
 where the code for cvcap.cpp boils down to this:     cv::VideoCapture *pIns = new cv::VideoCapture(argv[1]);
 The program seems to hang when reaching this one line, so, I am wondering if this is the right way of going about this. I have never used named pipes before and I am not sure if this is the correct usage. In addition, I don't know if I need to handle the named pipe differently in OpenCV--change code around to accept this kind of input. Like I said, my code already accepts files and camera inputs, I am just hung up on a stream coming in. I have only heard that named pipes can be used for OpenCV--I haven't seen any actual code or commands! Any help or insights are appreciated! UPDATE : I believe named pipes may not be working in the way I intended. As seen on this cygwin forum post: The problem is that Cygwin's implementation of fifos is very buggy. I wouldn't recommend using fifos for anything but the simplest of applications. I may need to find another way to do this. I have tried to pipe the ffmpeg output into a normal file and then have OpenCV read it at the same time. This works to some extent, but I imagine in can be dangerous to read and write from a file concurrently--who knows what would happen!
@CODE:$ mkfifo stream_pipe $ ffmpeg -f avi -i rtp://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:1234 -f avi -y out.avi > stream_pipe $ ./cvcap.exe stream_pipe cv::VideoCapture *pIns = new cv::VideoCapture(argv[1]);

@TITLE:Key value pair params handling in Backbone.js Router
@CONTENT:I want to pass key value pairs as params to Backbone routes and want it to be deserialized to a javascript object before the mapped function is called. var MyRouter = Backbone.Router.extend({
  routes: {
    "dashboard?:params" : "show_dashboard"
  },
  show_dashboard: function(params){
     console.log(params); 
  }
}); 
 When I go to "http://...#dashboard?key1=val1&key2=val2", then {key1: "val1", key2: "val2"} should be printed on the console. Am currently using jQuery BBQ's $.deparam method inside each mapped function to get at the deserialized object. It would be nice if I can extend Router and define it just once so params is accessible inside all mapped functions as an object. What would be a clean way to do this? And are there some pitfalls in this?? Much thanks, mano

  routes: {
    "dashboard?:params" : "show_dashboard"

@LINK:/questions/7342170/using-the-task-parallel-library-on-an-event-based-asynchronous-pattern
@TITLE:Using the Task Parallel Library on an event-based asynchronous pattern
@CONTENT:I'm writing a networked application. Messages are sent over the transport as such: Network.SendMessage (new FirstMessage() );
 I can register an event handler to be called when this message type arrives, like so: Network.RegisterMessageHandler<FirstMessage> (OnFirstMessageReceived);
 And the event gets fired: public void OnFirstMessageReceived(EventArgs<FirstMessageEventArgs> e)
{
}
 I'm writing a custom authentication procedure for my networked application, which requires around five messages to complete. Without using the Task Parallel Library, I would be forced to code the next step of each procedure in the preceding event handler, like so: public void OnFirstMessageReceived(EventArgs<FirstMessageEventArgs> e)
{
     Network.SendMessage( new SecondMessage() );
}

public void OnSecondMessageReceived(EventArgs<SecondMessageEventArgs> e)
{
     Network.SendMessage( new ThirdMessage() );
}

public void OnThirdMessageReceived(EventArgs<ThirdMessageEventArgs> e)
{
     Network.SendMessage( new FourthMessage() );
}

public void OnFourthMessageReceived(EventArgs<FourthMessageEventArgs> e)
{
     // Authentication is complete
}
 I don't like the idea of jumping around the source code to code a portion of this and a portion of that. It's hard to understand and edit. I hear the Task Parallel Library substantially simplifies this solution. However, many of the examples I read using the Task Parallel Library were related to starting a chain of active tasks. What I mean by 'active', is that each task could start when called explicitly, like so: public void Drink() {}
public void Eat()   {}
public void Sleep() {}

Task.Factory.StartNew(     () => Drink() )
            .ContinueWith( () => Eat()   )
            .ContinueWith( () => Sleep() );
 This is opposite from my event-based async pattern, in which each event handler method is called only when the message is received. In other words, I can't do something like this (but I want to): Task.Factory.StartNew(     () => OnFirstMessageReceived()  )
            .ContinueWith( () => OnSecondMessageReceived() )
            .ContinueWith( () => OnThirdMessageReceived()  )
            .ContinueWith( () => OnFourthMessageReceived() );
 I've read this article, but I don't quite understand it. It seems like what I need has to do with TaskCompletionSource. If I wanted to make a task from my event-based async pattern like the code block above, what would it look like?
@CODE:Network.SendMessage (new FirstMessage() ); Network.RegisterMessageHandler<FirstMessage> (OnFirstMessageReceived); public void OnFirstMessageReceived(EventArgs<FirstMessageEventArgs> e)
{
} public void OnFirstMessageReceived(EventArgs<FirstMessageEventArgs> e)
{
     Network.SendMessage( new SecondMessage() );
}

public void OnSecondMessageReceived(EventArgs<SecondMessageEventArgs> e)
{
     Network.SendMessage( new ThirdMessage() );
}

public void OnThirdMessageReceived(EventArgs<ThirdMessageEventArgs> e)
{
     Network.SendMessage( new FourthMessage() );
}

public void OnFourthMessageReceived(EventArgs<FourthMessageEventArgs> e)
{
     // Authentication is complete
} public void Drink() {}
public void Eat()   {}
public void Sleep() {}

Task.Factory.StartNew(     () => Drink() )
            .ContinueWith( () => Eat()   )
            .ContinueWith( () => Sleep() ); Task.Factory.StartNew(     () => OnFirstMessageReceived()  )
            .ContinueWith( () => OnSecondMessageReceived() )
            .ContinueWith( () => OnThirdMessageReceived()  )
            .ContinueWith( () => OnFourthMessageReceived() ); TaskCompletionSource

@TITLE:One-to-one integer mapping function
@CONTENT:We are using MySQL and developing an application where we'd like the ID sequence not to be publicly visible... the IDs are hardly top secret and there is no significant issue if someone indeed was able to decode them. So, a hash is of course the obvious solution, we are currently using MD5... 32bit integers go in, and we trim the MD5 to 64bits and then store that. However, we have no idea how likely collisions are when you trim like this (especially since all numbers come from autoincrement or the current time). We currently check for collisions, but since we may be inserting 100.000 rows at once the performance is terrible (can't bulk insert). But in the end, we really don't need the security offered by the hashes and they consume unnecessary space and also require an additional index... so, is there any simple and good enough function/algorithm out there that guarantees one-to-one mapping for any number without obvious visual patterns for sequential numbers? EDIT: I'm using PHP which does not support integer arithmetic by default, but after looking around I found that it could be cheaply replicated with bitwise operators. Code for 32bit integer multiplication can be found here: http://pastebin.com/np28xhQF

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks. EDIT: It doesn't matter what I'm trying to build. Even if I just make a single file with a function that adds two numbers. It crashes.

@LINK:/questions/7238962/function-apply-not-using-thisarg-parameter
@TITLE:Function.apply not using thisArg parameter
@CONTENT:I'm writing some Actionscript3 code that attempts to apply a method to an object that is determined at runtime. The AS3 documentation for Function.apply and Function.call both indicate that the first argument to those functions is the object which will be used as the 'this' value when the function is executed. However, I have found that in all cases when the function being executed is a method, the first parameter to apply/call is not used, and 'this' always refers to the original object to which that method was bound. Here is some example code and its output: package
{
    import flash.display.Sprite;    
    public class FunctionApplyTest extends Sprite
    {
        public function FunctionApplyTest()
        {
            var objA:MyObj = new MyObj("A");
            var objB:MyObj = new MyObj("B");

            objA.sayName();
            objB.sayName();

            objA.sayName.apply(objB, []);
            objA.sayName.call(objB);
        }
    }
}

internal class MyObj
{
    private var _name:String;
    public function MyObj(name:String)
    {
        _name = name;
    }   
    public function sayName():void
    {
        trace(_name);
    }
}
 Output: A
B
A
A
 A minor modification to the above code to create an in-line anonymous function which refers to 'this' shows that the correct behavior occurs when the function being applied/called is not a bound method. Am I using apply/call incorrect when I attempt to use it on a method? The AS3 documentation specifically provides code for this case, however: myObject.myMethod.call(myOtherObject, 1, 2, 3);
 If this is indeed broken, is there any work-around besides making the target methods into functions (which would be quite ugly, in my opinion)?
@CODE:package
{
    import flash.display.Sprite;    
    public class FunctionApplyTest extends Sprite
    {
        public function FunctionApplyTest()
        {
            var objA:MyObj = new MyObj("A");
            var objB:MyObj = new MyObj("B");

            objA.sayName();
            objB.sayName();

            objA.sayName.apply(objB, []);
            objA.sayName.call(objB);
        }
    }
}

        _name = name;

@LINK:/questions/6457474/eventhandler-with-custom-arguments
@TITLE:EventHandler with custom arguments
@CONTENT:I've been looking for an answer for about an hour on Google but I did not found exactly what I'm looking for. Basically, I have a static Helper class that helps perform many things I do frequently in my App. In this case, I have a method named "CreateDataContextMenu" that creates a context menu on a given TreeView control. public static void CreateDataContextMenu(Form parent, TreeView owner, string dataType)
{ ... }
 TreeView owner is the control in which I will associate my context menu. Then later on I add a Click event to a MenuItem like this: menuItemFolder.Click += new System.EventHandler(menuItemFolder_Click);
 The problem I have here is that I want to pass "owner" and "dataType" as arguments to the menuItemFolder_Click event. I tried the following: menuItemFolder.Click += new System.EventHandler(menuItemFolder_Click(sender,e,owner,dataType));
(...)
private static void menuItemFolder_Click(object sender, System.EventArgs e, Treeview owner, string dataType)
{...}
 But it doesn't work at all. It might be very naive of me to do it that way but I"m not very comfortable with event handler yet. Any idea on how I could do that? My first guess is that I need to create my own EventHandler for this specific case. Am I going in the right direction with that?
@CODE:public static void CreateDataContextMenu(Form parent, TreeView owner, string dataType)
{ ... } menuItemFolder.Click += new System.EventHandler(menuItemFolder_Click); menuItemFolder.Click += new System.EventHandler(menuItemFolder_Click(sender,e,owner,dataType));
(...)

@LINK:/questions/6171502/change-background-color-of-listview-row-programmatically-wpf
@TITLE:Change background color of ListView row programmatically (wpf)
@CONTENT:I have a class that populates a ListView by passing a list of objects. The class uses reflection to see the properties of each object in order to generate the ListView. How could I change the background color of a row in the ListView. This page does exactly what I am looking for. The only problem is that my ListView is bound to the list of objects. In other words each item of the ListView is an object that is bound instead of a ListViewItem. I am assuming that is the reason why I cannot cast some item in the ListView to a ListViewItem. For example when I do this: ListViewItem someItem = (ListViewItem)listView1.Items[0];
 I get an InvalidcastException because if I where to physically add the objects to the ListView like: listview.items.add(someObject) then this will work, but because I am binding the list to the ListView that line does not work. I think that is the reason why I am not able to cast. The reason why I want to cast it is becasue a ListViewItem has a Background property. EDIT I am able to do that with the first 12 objects I have tried the folowing: for (int i = 0; i < listView1.Items.Count; i++)
{
    var lvitem = listView1.ItemContainerGenerator.ContainerFromIndex(i) as ListViewItem;
    lvitem.Foreground = Brushes.Green;                
}
 and I get this error: and I also have tried this: foreach (Tiro t in listView1.Items)
{
    var lvitem = listView1.ItemContainerGenerator.ContainerFromItem(t) as ListViewItem;
    if (t.numero == 0 || t.numero == 37)
    {
        //lvitem.Background = Brushes.Green;
        lvitem.Foreground = Brushes.Green;
    }
    else if (t.numero % 2 == 0)
    {
        //lvitem.Background = Brushes.Red;
        lvitem.Foreground = Brushes.Red;
    }
    else
    {
        //lvitem.Background = Brushes.Gray;
        lvitem.Foreground = Brushes.Black;
    }

}
 and I get the same error: I don't understand why lvitem is null after the 12 iteration? It only works with the items that are being displayed....
@CODE:ListViewItem someItem = (ListViewItem)listView1.Items[0]; for (int i = 0; i < listView1.Items.Count; i++)
{
    var lvitem = listView1.ItemContainerGenerator.ContainerFromIndex(i) as ListViewItem;

@TITLE:python dictionary values sorting
@CONTENT:I have 2 dictionaries, dict1 and dict2 which contain the same keys, but different values for the keys. What I want to do is for each dictionary, sort the values from largest to smallest, and then give each value a rank 1-N, 1 being the largest value. From here, I want to get the difference of the ranks for the values in each dictionary for the same key. For example: dict1 = {a:0.6, b:0.3, c:0.9, d:1.2, e:0.2}
dict2 = {a:1.4, b:7.7, c:9.0, d:2.5, e:2.0}

# sorting by values would look like this:
dict1 = {d:1.2, c:0.9, a:0.6, b:0.3, e:0.2}
dict2 = {c:9.0, b:7.7, d:2.5, e:2.0, a:1.4}

#ranking the values would produce this:
dict1 = {d:1, c:2, a:3, b:4, e:5}
dict2 = {c:1, b:2, d:3, e:4, a:5}

#computing the difference between ranks would be something like this:
diffs = {}
for x in dict1.keys():
    diffs[x] = (dict1[x] - dict2[x])

#diffs would look like this:
diffs[a] = -2
diffs[b] = 2
diffs[c] = 1
diffs[d] = -2
diffs[e] = 1
 I know dictionaries are meant to be random and not sortable, but maybe there is a method to put the keys and values into a list? The main challenges I am facing are getting the keys and values sorted by value (largest to smallest) and then changing the value to its respective rank in the sorted list.
@CODE:dict1 dict2 dict1 = {a:0.6, b:0.3, c:0.9, d:1.2, e:0.2}
dict2 = {a:1.4, b:7.7, c:9.0, d:2.5, e:2.0}

@TITLE:How good is the RAND() function in Excel for Monte Carlo simulation?
@CONTENT:I'm implementing a Monte Carlo simulation in 3 variables in Excel. I've used the RAND() function to sample from Weibull distributions (with long tails). The functions applied to the samples are non-linear but smooth (exp, ln, cos, etc). The result for each sample is a pass/fail, and the overall result is a probability of failure. I have also implemented this by both numerical integration and Monte Carlo in MathCad, getting the same result both times. MathCad uses (I think) a Mersenne Twister random number generator. My excel spreadsheet is getting consistently different results (ie always larger). I have checked the equations are the same. What random number generator does Excel use, and how good is it? Is it possible that this is the source of my problem? I have assumed the Excel implementations of exp, cos etc are ok. Finally, is there a way to implement Monte Carlo to mitigate against the (known) poor properties of a particular random number generator? (I've heard of Markov chains, random walks etc, but don't really know much about them) Many thanks.

@TITLE:Fast way to remove a few items from a list/queue
@CONTENT:This is a follow up to a similar question which asked the best way to write for item in somelist:
    if determine(item):
         code_to_remove_item
 and it seems the consensus was on something like somelist[:] = [x for x in somelist if not determine(x)]
 However, I think if you are only removing a few items, most of the items are being copied into the same object, and perhaps that is slow. In an answer to another related question, someone suggests: for item in reversed(somelist):
    if determine(item):
        somelist.remove(item)
 However, here the list.remove will search for the item, which is O(N) in the length of the list. May be we are limited in that the list is represented as an array, rather than a linked list, so removing items will need to move everything after it. However, it is suggested here that collections.dequeue is represented as a doubly linked list. It should then be possible to remove in O(1) while iterating. How would we actually accomplish this? Update: I did some time testing as well, with the following code: import timeit
setup = """
import random
random.seed(1)
b = [(random.random(),random.random()) for i in xrange(1000)]
c = []
def tokeep(x):

This morning, I've also asked a question about this: Win32 - Backtrace from C code Now, I'm pretty sure that the StackWalk64 function is the key for this. I've read some articles on how to use it, as well as the MS documentation. It actually displays frames on my test program, so it kinda work... The problem is that I'm not able to retrieve the symbol name from the stack informations. I'm using the SymGetSymFromAddr64 function for this, with UnDecorateSymbolName. But I only get junk characters. Here's my code. Hope its not to messy, as I'm not used to Windows programming: void printStack( void )
{
    BOOL                result;
    HANDLE              process;
    HANDLE              thread;
    CONTEXT             context;
    STACKFRAME64        stack;
    ULONG               frame;
    IMAGEHLP_SYMBOL64   symbol;
    DWORD64             displacement;
    char name[ 256 ];

    RtlCaptureContext( &context );
    memset( &stack, 0, sizeof( STACKFRAME64 ) );

    process                = GetCurrentProcess();
    thread                 = GetCurrentThread();
    displacement           = 0;
    stack.AddrPC.Offset    = context.Eip;
    stack.AddrPC.Mode      = AddrModeFlat;
    stack.AddrStack.Offset = context.Esp;
    stack.AddrStack.Mode   = AddrModeFlat;
    stack.AddrFrame.Offset = context.Ebp;
    stack.AddrFrame.Mode   = AddrModeFlat;

    for( frame = 0; ; frame++ )
    {
        result = StackWalk64
        (
            IMAGE_FILE_MACHINE_I386,
            process,
            thread,
            &stack,
            &context,
            NULL,
            SymFunctionTableAccess64,
            SymGetModuleBase64,
            NULL
        );

        symbol.SizeOfStruct  = sizeof( IMAGEHLP_SYMBOL64 );
        symbol.MaxNameLength = 255;

        SymGetSymFromAddr64( process, ( ULONG64 )stack.AddrPC.Offset, &displacement, &symbol );
        UnDecorateSymbolName( symbol.Name, ( PSTR )name, 256, UNDNAME_COMPLETE );

        printf
        (
            "Frame %lu:\n"
            "    Symbol name:    %s\n"
            "    PC address:     0x%08LX\n"
            "    Stack address:  0x%08LX\n"

            ( ULONG64 )stack.AddrStack.Offset,

        if( !result )
        {
            break;
        }
    }
}
 The actual output is: Frame 0:

 Seems weird that the stack address is always 0 by the way... Any help appreciated : ) Thanks to everyone! EDIT I'm looking for a plain C solution, without third party libraries...

 Of course, I can use link instead of button, and I can make it through a property in a managed bean, but in this question I'm seeking for a convenient way to use the button... I'm using RichFaces 3.3.3, JSF2, facelets.

@TITLE:Images were Shuffled when scrolling a ListView with a ViewHolder
@CONTENT:My problem is connected when the user scrolls the ListView. I looked around and saw numerous examples of 'listview lazy image', has also watched the video of the Google IO which speaks of 'good practice ' to make this work. But my problem continues when the user moves up and down the ListView. What happens is that when scrolling the list, the images that were loaded on each item are shuffled, and the avatar of each item going to the next item ends. I do not know if I'm being clear but I will show with the image. When you start, items that have no image left with the standard image. Image 1: http://boxandroid.com/app/weguide/itsok.png Before user scroll ListView: http://boxandroid.com/app/weguide/nook.png Note that the pictures were shuffled among other items. in my adapter: public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent){

@TITLE:Getting an Unhandled Exception in VS2010 debugger even though the exception IS handled
@CONTENT:I have an issue with VS2010 where the debugger stops with an Unhandled Exception. However, the exception is definitely handled. In fact, if I put code in the catch block, I'll hit it when I press F5. In Debug -> Exceptions, I definitely do not have the "Thrown" checkbox checked, so IMO there is absolutely no reason for the unhandled exception dialog to pop up... I can't post the exact code, but will work on a sample soon. The basic idea behind the offending code section is that I have a thread that talks to hardware, and if I have an error talking to it, then I throw a HardwareException. The thread is launched with BeginInvoke, and the exception is caught in the callback handler when I call EndInvoke. When the exception is thrown in the debugger, I get a messagebox that says 'HardwareException not handled by user code". But it is!!! EDIT -- Well, this is driving me crazy. I've got sample code that is representative of the code I have in my application, and it looks like this: using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Runtime.Remoting.Messaging;
using System.Threading;

namespace ConsoleApplication1
{
    public class HardwareException : ApplicationException
    {
        public HardwareException( string message) : base(message) {}
    }

    class Program
    {
        delegate void HardwareTestDelegate();

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            HardwareTestDelegate d = new HardwareTestDelegate( HardwareTestThread);
            d.BeginInvoke( HardwareTestComplete, null);
            while( true);
        }

        static void HardwareTestThread()
        {
            throw new HardwareException( "this is a test");
        }

        static void HardwareTestComplete( IAsyncResult iar)
        {
            try {
                AsyncResult ar = (AsyncResult)iar;
                HardwareTestDelegate caller = (HardwareTestDelegate)ar.AsyncDelegate;
                caller.EndInvoke( iar);
            } catch( Exception ex) {
                Console.WriteLine( "Should see this line without getting an unhandled exception message in the IDE");
            }
        }
    }
}
 I throw my HardwareException from the thread, and then handle the exception when EndInvoke is called. I guess Murphy was right, because when I run this sample code, it does what I expect -- i.e. no unhandled exception error message pops up in the IDE!
@CODE:HardwareException BeginInvoke EndInvoke using System;

        {
            HardwareTestDelegate d = new HardwareTestDelegate( HardwareTestThread);
            d.BeginInvoke( HardwareTestComplete, null);
            while( true);
        }

        static void HardwareTestThread()
        {
            throw new HardwareException( "this is a test");
        }

@TITLE:Background worker - report progress with string array
@CONTENT:I need to return multiple STRING values from my backgroundworker in each loop, so I tried to use ReportProgress second parameter as string array. Example of code: private void backgroundWorker1_DoWork(object sender, DoWorkEventArgs e)
{
    string[] workerResult = new string[2];
    for (int i=0; i<someNumber; i++)
    {

{
    string[] results = (string[])e.UserState;

    MessageBox.Show(results[0]); // line of error

}
 It compiles, but on runtime in the moment I try to access Userstate returned string, I get an error: "Object reference not set to an instance of an object."

@TITLE:What is singular and non-singular values in the context of STL iterators?
@CONTENT:The section ￣24.1/5 from the C++ Standard (2003) reads, Just as a regular pointer to an array guarantees that there is a pointer value pointing past the last element of the array, so for any iterator type there is an iterator value that points past the last element of a corresponding container. These values are called past-the-end values. Values of an iterator i for which the expression *i is defined are called dereferenceable. The library never assumes that past-the-end values are dereferenceable. Iterators can also have singular values that are not associated with any container. [Example: After the declaration of an uninitialized pointer x (as with int* x;), x must always be assumed to have a singular value of a pointer.] Results of most expressions are undefined for singular values; the only exception is an assignment of a non-singular value to an iterator that holds a singular value. In this case the singular value is overwritten the same way as any other value. Dereferenceable values are always nonsingular. I couldn't really understand the text shown in bold? What is singular value and nonsingular value? How are they defined? And where? How and why dereferenceable values are always nonsingular?

@TITLE:perspective correction of texture coordinates in 3d
@CONTENT:I'm writing a software renderer which is currently working well, but I'm trying to get perspective correction of texture coordinates and that doesn't seem to be correct. I am using all the same matrix math as opengl for my renderer. To rasterise a triangle I do the following: transform the vertices using the modelview and projection matrixes, and transform into clip coordinates. for each pixel in each triangle, calculate barycentric coordinates to interpolate properties (color, texture coordinates, normals etc.) to correct for perspective I use perspective correct interpolation: (w is depth coordinate of vertex, c is texture coordinate of vertex, b is the barycentric weight of a vertex) 1/w = b0*(1/w0) + b1*(1/w1) + b2*(1/w2)
c/w = b0*(c0/w0) + b1*(c1/w1) + b2*(c2/w2)
c = (c/w)/(1/w)
 This should correct for perspective, and it helps a little, but there is still an obvious perspective problem. Am I missing something here, perhaps some rounding issues (I'm using floats for all math)? See in this image the error in the texture coordinates evident along the diagonal, this is the result having done the division by depth coordinates. Also, this is usually done for texture coordinates... is it necessary for other properties (e.g. normals etc.) as well?
@CODE:1/w = b0*(1/w0) + b1*(1/w1) + b2*(1/w2)

@TITLE:Duplicate symbol: Include static lib A in static lib B, also include lib A and B in XCode Project
@CONTENT:I've been trying to build up a set of reusable libraries for app development, but I'm starting to run into a problem. One of my static libs is a set of general use methods (categories on Objective-C Foundation classes to improve their usability) which I tend to use in every project. (We'll call it Lib A... i.e. XCode project A produces libProjectA.a) Then I have other static libs, things that contain specialized code for math, etc. (We'll call it Lib B.) Lib B links to Lib A because it needs to use some of that general functionality. (i.e. XCode project B links with libProjectA.a and produces libProjectB.a) In my XCode project, I want to include and depend on Lib A because it has my general use stuff that I use all the time. I also want to include and depend on Lib B because I need that specialized math functionality. (i.e. my app Project wants to link with libProjectA.a and libProjectB.a) However, when I try to build my XCode project I get errors for duplicate symbols, because the symbols that are defined in Lib A are also defined in Lib B. ld: duplicate symbol _OBJC_METACLASS_$_Foo in /Users/kenny/xcode_build/Release-iphonesimulator/lib_ApplicationCore.a(Foo.o) and /Users/kenny/xcode_build/Release-iphonesimulator/lib_SpecializedMath.a(Foo.o)
 How can I get around this problem? I want to develop reusable libraries to speed my app development as well as increase stability through tested/refined code. Am I approaching this from the wrong perspective? I'm developing for iOS so I can't use dylibs, they must be static. How can I include these libraries in my project when they are interdependent upon each other and avoid the duplicate symbols?
@CODE:ld: duplicate symbol _OBJC_METACLASS_$_Foo in /Users/kenny/xcode_build/Release-iphonesimulator/lib_ApplicationCore.a(Foo.o) and /Users/kenny/xcode_build/Release-iphonesimulator/lib_SpecializedMath.a(Foo.o)

@TITLE:Why does XmlSerializer require types which inherit from IEnumerable to have an implementation of Add(System.Object)?
@CONTENT:I am using xml serialization but now came across a runtime error I haven't seen before. "To be XML serializable, types which inherit from IEnumerable must have an implementation of Add(System.Object) at all levels of their inheritance hierarchy. ImageEditor.EffectOptions does not implement Add(System.Object)" It seems a little weird to be forced to implement a method via runtime exception, rather than compile time error such as missing methods from implemented interfaces. Is this by design? Should this not be enforced via some sort of interface like XmlSerializable, etc? Other than this I am wondering if the serializer guarantees passing a value of the right type where I can just cast it to the type, which in my case is EffectOption. Or should I implement this Add (object) method to see if the object is of type EffectOption and if not throw an exception? I haven't implemented this Add (object) method before but my guess is it's safer to just cast it to EffectOption and add it to EffectOptions collection. EDIT: Here's the type itself: public class EffectOptions : IEnumerable<EffectOption>
{
    public List<EffectOption> Options { get; private set; }

    //IEnumerable methods
}

@CONTENT:I'm building an ORM using Entity Frameworks 4.0 (CTP5) in the Model-First pattern. A few of my entities have complex (object tree) properties that don't need to be ORM entities - they're only of interest to back-end server systems that use this database, not to the clients that use this database. I could just serialize the property's object tree down to a string and store it in the DB as a string, but the SQL Server XML data type is really appealing. To be able to query over the XML data contents in an intelligent manner would be very nice. However, I don't see any way to specify that I want an XML data type in the Visual Studio Entity Modeler. Is the only way to get this done to specify string fields in the model, emit the DDL, then modify the DDL to change the string fields to XML fields? That seems awfully brittle and write-once, change never. Is there a better way?

(i.e. my app Project wants to link with libProjectA.a and libProjectB.a) However, when I try to build my XCode project I get errors for duplicate symbols, because the symbols that are defined in Lib A are also defined in Lib B. ld: duplicate symbol _OBJC_METACLASS_$_Foo in /Users/kenny/xcode_build/Release-iphonesimulator/lib_ApplicationCore.a(Foo.o) and /Users/kenny/xcode_build/Release-iphonesimulator/lib_SpecializedMath.a(Foo.o)
 How can I get around this problem? I want to develop reusable libraries to speed my app development as well as increase stability through tested/refined code. Am I approaching this from the wrong perspective? I'm developing for iOS so I can't use dylibs, they must be static. How can I include these libraries in my project when they are interdependent upon each other and avoid the duplicate symbols?
@CODE:ld: duplicate symbol _OBJC_METACLASS_$_Foo in /Users/kenny/xcode_build/Release-iphonesimulator/lib_ApplicationCore.a(Foo.o) and /Users/kenny/xcode_build/Release-iphonesimulator/lib_SpecializedMath.a(Foo.o)

@CONTENT:I'm looking for an algorithm (coded in Java would be nice, but anything clear enough to translate to Java is fine) to draw a 4-connected line. It seems that Bresenham's algorithm is the most widely used, but all the understandable implementations I've found are 8-connected. OpenCV's cvline function apparently has a 4-connected version, but the source code is, to me, as a mediocre and nearly C-illiterate programmer, impenetrable.

@TITLE:Why does XmlSerializer require types which inherit from IEnumerable to have an implementation of Add(System.Object)?
@CONTENT:I am using xml serialization but now came across a runtime error I haven't seen before. "To be XML serializable, types which inherit from IEnumerable must have an implementation of Add(System.Object) at all levels of their inheritance hierarchy. ImageEditor.EffectOptions does not implement Add(System.Object)" It seems a little weird to be forced to implement a method via runtime exception, rather than compile time error such as missing methods from implemented interfaces. Is this by design? Should this not be enforced via some sort of interface like XmlSerializable, etc? Other than this I am wondering if the serializer guarantees passing a value of the right type where I can just cast it to the type, which in my case is EffectOption. Or should I implement this Add (object) method to see if the object is of type EffectOption and if not throw an exception? I haven't implemented this Add (object) method before but my guess is it's safer to just cast it to EffectOption and add it to EffectOptions collection. EDIT: Here's the type itself: public class EffectOptions : IEnumerable<EffectOption>
{
    public List<EffectOption> Options { get; private set; }

    //IEnumerable methods
}

@TITLE:How to specify SQL Server XML data type in Entity Frameworks 4.0 Model?
@CONTENT:I'm building an ORM using Entity Frameworks 4.0 (CTP5) in the Model-First pattern. A few of my entities have complex (object tree) properties that don't need to be ORM entities - they're only of interest to back-end server systems that use this database, not to the clients that use this database. I could just serialize the property's object tree down to a string and store it in the DB as a string, but the SQL Server XML data type is really appealing. To be able to query over the XML data contents in an intelligent manner would be very nice. However, I don't see any way to specify that I want an XML data type in the Visual Studio Entity Modeler. Is the only way to get this done to specify string fields in the model, emit the DDL, then modify the DDL to change the string fields to XML fields? That seems awfully brittle and write-once, change never. Is there a better way?

    // explicitly check for the boolean value `true`
    if (JSONfromServer === true) {
         // do some things
    }
}

// pass it to an ajax as a callback
doSomeAjax(onSuccess);
 [Edit] In this particular case the success variable is any valid JSON returned from a server. So it could be anything. if its the boolean true then a success happened. If it's some error handling object then it will be handled. If it's something else then it will probably be handled quietly. The question was is getting the server to return true as JSON and checking for a good way to handle the case where the action succeeded. I wanted to avoid being specific to JavaScript & AJAX though.
@CODE:if(success) if (someBoolean === true) var onSuccess = function (JSONfromServer) {
    // explicitly check for the boolean value `true`
    if (JSONfromServer === true) {
         // do some things
    }
}

// pass it to an ajax as a callback
doSomeAjax(onSuccess); true

@TITLE:Enabling Queue<T> with concurrency
@CONTENT:I have a previous question which I have provided my solution; however, I don't have access to ConcurrentQueue<T> since I am on .Net 3.5. I need Queue<T> to allow concurrency. I read this question and seems to present a problem if an item is not in the queue and the threaded method tries to dequeue an item. My task now is to determine whether I can derive my own concurrent Queue class. This is what I came up with: public sealed class ConcurrentQueue : Queue<DataTable>
{
    public event EventHandler<TableQueuedEventArgs> TableQueued;
    private ICollection que;

    new public void Enqueue(DataTable Table)
    {
        lock (que.SyncRoot)
        {
            base.Enqueue(Table);
        }

        OnTableQueued(new TableQueuedEventArgs(Dequeue()));
    }

    //  this is where I think I will have a problem...
    new public DataTable Dequeue()
    {
        DataTable table;

        lock (que.SyncRoot)
        {
            table = base.Dequeue();
        }

        return table;
    }

    public void OnTableQueued(TableQueuedEventArgs table)
    {
        EventHandler<TableQueuedEventArgs> handler = TableQueued;

        if (handler != null)
        {
            handler(this, table);
        }
    }
}
 So, when a DataTable is queued, the EventArgs will pass a dequeued table to the event subscriber. Will this implementation provide me with a thread-safe Queue?
@CODE:ConcurrentQueue<T> Queue<T> public sealed class ConcurrentQueue : Queue<DataTable>
{
    public event EventHandler<TableQueuedEventArgs> TableQueued;
    private ICollection que;

    new public void Enqueue(DataTable Table)
    {
        lock (que.SyncRoot)
        {
            base.Enqueue(Table);
        }

        OnTableQueued(new TableQueuedEventArgs(Dequeue()));
    }

    //  this is where I think I will have a problem...
    new public DataTable Dequeue()
    {
        DataTable table;

        lock (que.SyncRoot)
        {
            table = base.Dequeue();
        }

        return table;
    }

    public void OnTableQueued(TableQueuedEventArgs table)
    {
        EventHandler<TableQueuedEventArgs> handler = TableQueued;

        if (handler != null)
        {
            handler(this, table);
        }
    }

@LINK:/questions/4453781/what-happens-when-you-overwrite-a-memory-mapped-executable
@TITLE:What happens when you overwrite a memory-mapped executable?
@CONTENT:Following the comments on one of my questions I'm intrigued to know what happens when one overwrites an executable. I need to check my understanding on the matter. Say I have /usr/bin/myprog. I run it and so the OS loads /usr/bin/myprog, probably via http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory-mapped_file#Common_uses. For whatever reason that process remains in memory and I decide actually I've fixed a bug and I overwrite /usr/bin/myprog. So, as far as I understand it: If an instance of myprog is already loaded and I replace the file from which myprog was already loaded, the instance of myprog is unmodified. If I run a new instance of myprog it will use the new code. Am I correct? However, according to the article on memory-mapped files, such a technique allows a developer to treat portions of a file as if they are physical memory. So I see a contradiction in how I understood things. If pages are truly only loaded in on demand, then assuming myprog is not 100% paged, this wikipedia article implies new pages will load from the file on disk, which has changed since the original image was loaded. However, I am pretty certain that my two compiled images would not be the same and that the relevant address offsets for each file are not identical. So, assuming this happens, the instruction pointer is going to get very lost... I am pretty certain an operating system does not load parts of two different images into memory as part of the same process. So how does the combination of memory-mapping/demand-paging work for the execution of programs, please? Would overwriting that file trigger a page fault on each of the executables' pages to ensure it is loaded in for the currently running process? I did a quick experiment with this: #include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    printf("Program resident...");
    while(1)
    {
        printf("??? Just notifying you I'm still here...\n");
        usleep(1000000);
    }

    return 0;
}
 And sure enough I could a) replace this executable whilst it was running and b) its output isn't changed. SO what is going on? I'd particularly appreciate any suggestions for stuff I can do to see what happens (Linux or Windows). Thanks all. Edit: question to which I was referring that sparked this question: Linux unattended-upgrades without reboot - what kinds of problems can happen? Also, I'm aware this doesn't specifically relate to programming, but the outcome of updating an executable. I am still interested, however, and I can't think of a better place to ask it.
@CODE:/usr/bin/myprog /usr/bin/myprog /usr/bin/myprog myprog myprog myprog myprog myprog #include <stdio.h>

@TITLE:Castle Windsor strange behaviour wth property injection and factory method
@CONTENT:I am using Castle Windsor 2.5.1 in an ASP.NET MVC project and using property injection to create an object which I expect to always be available on a base controller class. I am using a factory to create this object, however if there is an error in the constructor, I do not get a warning from Windsor at all and it just returns my object but without injecting the property. Is this the expected behaviour, and if so, how can I get an error raised when a factory fails to return anything? Here is an example public class MyDependency : IMyDependency
{
    public MyDependency(bool error)
    {
        if (error) throw new Exception("I error on creation");
    }
}

public interface IMyDependency
{
}

public class MyConsumer
{
    public IMyDependency MyDependency { get; set; }
}

public class ProgramTest
{
    [Test]
    public void CreateWithoutError() //Works as expected
    {
        var container = new WindsorContainer().Register(
            Component.For<IMyDependency>().UsingFactoryMethod(() => new MyDependency(false)).LifeStyle.Transient,
            Component.For<MyConsumer>().LifeStyle.Transient
        );

        var consumer = container.Resolve<MyConsumer>();

        Assert.IsNotNull(consumer);
        Assert.IsNotNull(consumer.MyDependency);
    }

    [Test]
    public void CreateWithError_WhatShouldHappen() //I would expect an error since it can't create MyDependency
    {
        var container = new WindsorContainer().Register(
            Component.For<IMyDependency>().UsingFactoryMethod(() => new MyDependency(true)).LifeStyle.Transient,
            Component.For<MyConsumer>().LifeStyle.Transient
        );

        Assert.Throws<Exception>(() => container.Resolve<MyConsumer>());
    }

    [Test]
    public void CreateWithError_WhatActuallyHappens() //Gives me back a consumer, but ignores MyDependency
    {
        var container = new WindsorContainer().Register(
            Component.For<IMyDependency>().UsingFactoryMethod(() => new MyDependency(true)).LifeStyle.Transient,
            Component.For<MyConsumer>().LifeStyle.Transient
        );

        var consumer = container.Resolve<MyConsumer>();

        Assert.IsNotNull(consumer);
        Assert.IsNull(consumer.MyDependency); //Basically fails silently!
    }
}
 An interesting observation, if I use this in my MVC application, I get an internal error from Windsor when calling ReleaseComponent -- so even though it did not give me back a class with my dependency injected, it still appears to try releasing it.

        var consumer = container.Resolve<MyConsumer>();

 We can easily create a mock of this: public class MockEmployeeRepository : IEmployeeRepository

    }
}

{
    Employee GetEmployeeById(long id);

I have some issues with examples on the internet. Take the popular blog post / comments example. Post has none or many Comments associated with it. I create Post object, add a few Comment objects to the IList in Post. Thats fine. Do I add that to just a "Posts" Collection in MonoDB or should I have two collections - one is blog.posts and blog.posts.comments? I have a fair complicated object model, easiest way to think of it is as a Banking System - ours is mining. I tried to highlight tables with square brackets. [Users] have one or many [Accounts] that have one or many [Transactions] which has one and only one [Type]. [Transactions] can have one or more [Tag] assigned to the transaction. [Users] create their own [Tags] unique to that user account and we sometimes need to offer reporting by those tags (Eg. for May, tag drilling-expense was $123456.78). For indexing, I would have thought seperating them would be good but I'm worried it is bad practice this thinking from old RBDMS days. In a way, its like the blog example. I'm not sure if I should have 1 [Account] Collection and persist all information there, or have an intermediate step that splits it up to seperate collections. The other related query is, when you persist back and forth, do you usually get back everything associated with that record - even if not required or do you limit?

@TITLE:Java: Getting Bytecode of Class at Runtime from within the Same JVM
@CONTENT:Related to: Java: Is there a way to obtain the bytecode for a class at runtime? I'm adding durability to Clojure, and I'm finally at the point where I'm ready to add functions. In Clojure, functions are byte compiled into classes with invoke methods (among others). In this way, functions are first class. To make these durable, I need to serialize and deserialize these classes. How do I get the bytecode for the class without having access to the .class file? Please correct me if I'm mistaken, but using an agent requires spawning a separate VM with the agent connecting to the first VM. I need to do it from the same VM. It's not enough to use Serializable to set and get the Class object. Upon deserializing, I need to load the class, and upon subsequent VM instances, there may be a class name collision. I need to modify the bytecode to rename the class to something unique at deserialization/class-load time.

@CONTENT:Is it possible to have not only a LinkedServer, but linked database and server? My situation is that of having one environment with a setup of: ServerX: DatabaseOne, DatabaseTwo and another environment of: ServerY: MyDatabaseOne, MyDatabaseTwo Now, DatabaseOne and MyDatabaseOne are exactly the same, as are DatabaseTwo and MyDatabaseTwo. I have a stored procedure that does some basic table updates from one db to the other on a given server, and I want it to be able to work in both evironments. I have set up a linked server so my reference can be: MyLinkedServer.DatabaseOne.dbo.MyTable or MyLinkedServer.MyDatabaseOne.dbo.MyTable Even with this though, I will need to change the SP when I switch environments to change the db names, is there any way of setting up a Database Alias, so that I can write: SELECT * FROM MyLinkedServer.MyLinkedDatabase.dbo.MyTable So that as long as LinkedServer and (if possible) LinkedDatabase are set up in each environment, the SP will work without changing when switching environments?

@TITLE:Forward declaration include, on top of declaration include (ClassFwd.h + Class.h)
@CONTENT:In Effective C++ (3rd edition), Scott Meyers, in Item 31, suggests that classes should have, on top of their classic Declaration (.h) and Definition (.cpp) files, a Forward Declaration Include File (fwd.h), which class that do not need the full definition can use, instead of forward declaring themselves. I somewhat see the case for it, but I really don't see this as a viable option... It seems very hard to maintain, rather overkill and hardly necessary. I can, however, see its use for template forward declarations, which are rather heavy. But for simple classes? It seems to be that it's a pain to maintain and will create a whole lot of almost empty include files that serve a very small purpose... is it worth the hassle? Here's a example: // Class.h
class Class
{
    Class();
    ~Class();
};

// ClassFwd.h
class Class;

// Class.cpp
Class::Class()
{
}

Class::~Class()
{
}
 My question: What do you guys think? If this a good practice? NOTE I am mostly interested in the arguments FOR this practice, to see if I missed something that would make me agree with Scott Meyers.

class Class
{
    Class();
    ~Class();

My question is can const_cast add constness to a non-const object? Actually i wrote a small programme trying to approve my thought. class ConstTest

 const_cast<const ConstTest&>(ct).test();//it is wrong to write this statement without the '&',why

}
 Omitting the '&' incurs error below: error C2440: 'const_cast' : cannot convert from 'ConstTest' to 'const ConstTest' It shows that const_cast can add constness,but seems like you have to cast to a object reference, what is the magic of this reference ?

@CONTENT:PLEASE READ THE QUESTION CAREFULLY. It is not usual silly "my code doesn't work!!!" question. When I run this code with intended error try {

} catch (PDOException $e) {

 I get this error message You have an error in your SQL syntax ... near 'INN('I\'m','d\'Artagnan')' at line 1 But I thought for years that query and data being sent to the server separately and never interfere. Thus I have some questions (though I doubt anyone got an answer...) Where does it get such a familiar string representation - quoted and escaped? Is it being made especially to report an error or is it a part of actual query? How does it work in real? Does it substitute a placeholder with data or not? Is there a way to get whole query, not only little bit of it, for debugging purposes? Update mysqli does it as expected: it throws an error says near 'INN(?,?)'

@TITLE:How does the pimpl idiom reduce dependencies?
@CONTENT:Consider the following: PImpl.hpp class Impl;

class PImpl
{
    Impl* pimpl;
    PImpl() : pimpl(new Impl) { }
    ~PImpl() { delete pimpl; }
    void DoSomething();

 PImpl.cpp #include "PImpl.hpp"
#include "Impl.hpp"

public:
    void DoSomething() {}
}
 client.cpp #include "Pimpl.hpp"

int main()
{
    PImpl unitUnderTest;
    unitUnderTest.DoSomething();
}
 The idea behind this pattern is that Impl's interface can change, yet clients do not have to be recompiled. Yet, I fail to see how this can truly be the case. Let's say I wanted to add a method to this class -- clients would still have to recompile. Basically, the only kinds of changes like this that I can see ever needing to change the header file for a class for are things for which the interface of the class changes. And when that happens, pimpl or no pimpl, clients have to recompile. What kinds of editing here give us benefits in terms of not recompiling client code?
@CODE:class Impl;

class PImpl
{
    Impl* pimpl;
    PImpl() : pimpl(new Impl) { }
    ~PImpl() { delete pimpl; }

I want to: make this JavaScript file as small as possible (compile it down to < 1kb if possible) inline the code that provides the document readyness in a closure (without exporting it) Inlining the whole jQuery source in my file would be too big, so I'm looking for other methods. window.onload would work, but I specifically want document readyness, and not wait for the window.onload event.

 I want to run a query of one ore more tags against the three tables to return the items that match ALL of the tags. So for example, querying for "pet" would return the items (1)spaniel, (2)tabby and (4)goldfish, because all of them are tagged "pet". Querying for "cheap" and "pet" together would return (1)spaniel and (4)goldfish because they are both tagged "cheap" and "pet". Tabby would not be returned as it is only tagged "pet" but not "cheap" (in my world tabby cats are expensive :P) Querying for "cheap", "pet" and "dog" would only return (1)Spaniel, since it is the only one matching all three tags. Anyway, this is the desired behaviour. I have two questions. Is this the best way to set up my tables for my intended purposes? I am still new to ideas of normalising databases, and am picking this up as I go along - any input on efficiency or even if this is an appropriate layout for my database would be much appreciated. Provided the above setup is workable, how could I structure a single MySQL query to achieve my intended purpose?* (that being, for a series of tags, returning ONLY the item(s) that match ALL the specified tags). I have tried doing a variety of JOINs/UNIONs but none of them are giving me the desired effect(usually return ALL the items that match ANY of the tags)D I've spent some time looking through the MySQL manual online but I feel like I'm missing something conceptually. *I say single query since of course I could just run a series of simple WHERE/JOIN queries, one for each tag and then combine/sort the returned items in PHP or something after the fact but it seems a foolish and inefficient way of doing it. I feel like there is a way I should be able to do this with a single MySQL query, given the appropriate setup.

@TITLE:WCF Known Type from System.Object in Config
@CONTENT:I'm trying to specify a known type in my config, but I'm having problems with the fact that it derives from Object. I can make it work specifying the known type via attribute. But in this case I need to make it work from the config. Here's an example. The following works fine: [ServiceContract]
[ServiceKnownType(typeof(MyData))]
public interface IContract
{
    [OperationContract]
    void Send(object data);
}

[DataContract]
public class MyData
{
    [DataMember]
    public string Message { get; set; }
}
 But if I remove the ServiceKnownType attribute and put the following in the config: <system.runtime.serialization>
  <dataContractSerializer>
    <declaredTypes>
      <add type="System.Object, mscorlib, Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089">

      </add>
    </declaredTypes>
  </dataContractSerializer>
</system.runtime.serialization>
 I get a ConfigurationErrorsException with the message "The value for the property 'type' is not valid. The error is: The type System.Object cannot be used as a declared type in config." Is there anyway to make this work via config?
@CODE:[ServiceContract]

@TITLE:Maximum execution time for JavaScript
@CONTENT:I know both ie and firefox have limits for javascript execution (Source 1, Source 2). Based on number of statements executed, I heard it was 5 million somewhere in IE and based on number of seconds in firefox: it's 10 seconds by default for my version. The thing I don't get is what cases will go over these limits: I'm sure a giant loop will go over the limit for execution time But will an event hander go over the limit, if itself it's execution time is under the limit but if it occurs multiple times? Example: Lets say I have a timer on my page, that executes some javascript every 20 seconds. The execution time for the timer handler is 1 second. Does firefox and ie treat each call of the timer function seperatly, so it never goes over the limit, or is it that firefox/ie adds up the time of each call so after the handler finishes, so after 200 seconds on my site (with the timer called 10 times) an error occurs even though the timer handler itself is only 1 second long?

 And also how to retrieve the generated key of a newly inserted row: KeyHolder keyHolder = new GeneratedKeyHolder();
jdbcTemplate.update(
    new PreparedStatementCreator() {
        public PreparedStatement createPreparedStatement(Connection connection) throws SQLException {
            PreparedStatement ps =
                connection.prepareStatement(INSERT_SQL, new String[] {"id"});
            ps.setString(1, name);
            return ps;
        }
    },
    keyHolder);

// keyHolder.getKey() now contains the generated key
 Is there a way I could combine the two?
@CODE:final File blobIn = new File("spring2004.jpg");
final InputStream blobIs = new FileInputStream(blobIn);
jdbcTemplate.execute(
  "INSERT INTO lob_table (id, a_blob) VALUES (?, ?)",
  new AbstractLobCreatingPreparedStatementCallback(lobhandler) {

          throws SQLException {
        ps.setLong(1, 1L);
        lobCreator.setBlobAsBinaryStream(ps, 2, blobIs, (int)blobIn.length());           
      }
  }
);
blobIs.close(); KeyHolder keyHolder = new GeneratedKeyHolder();
jdbcTemplate.update(
    new PreparedStatementCreator() {
        public PreparedStatement createPreparedStatement(Connection connection) throws SQLException {
            PreparedStatement ps =

@TITLE:In Python, how can I find the index of the first item in a list that is NOT some value?
@CONTENT:Python's list type has an index(x) method. It takes a single parameter x, and returns the (integer) index of the first item in the list that has the value x. Basically, I need to invert the index(x) method. I need to get the index of the first value in a list that does NOT have the value x. I would probably be able to even just use a function that returns the index of the first item with a value != None. I can think of a 'for' loop implementation with an incrementing counter variable, but I feel like I'm missing something. Is there an existing method, or a one-line Python construction that can handle this? In my program, the situation comes up when I'm handling lists returned from complex regex matches. All but one item in each list have a value of None. If I just needed the matched string, I could use a list comprehension like '[x for x in [my_list] if x is not None]', but I need the index in order to figure out which capture group in my regex actually caused the match.

@TITLE:Running job in the background from Perl WITHOUT waiting for return
@CONTENT:The Disclaimer First of all, I know this question (or close variations) have been asked a thousand times. I really spent a few hours looking in the obvious and the not-so-obvious places, but there may be something small I'm missing. The Context Let me define the problem more clearly: I'm writing a newsletter app in which I want the actual sending process to be async. As in, user clicks "send", request returns immediately and then they can check the progress in a specific page (via AJAX, for example). It's written in your traditional LAMP stack. In the particular host I'm using, PHP's exec() and system() are disabled for security reasons, but Perl's system functions (exec, system and backticks) aren't. So my workaround solution was to create a "trigger" script in Perl that calls the actual sender via the PHP CLI, and redirects to the progress page. Where I'm Stuck The very line the calls the sender is, as of now: system("php -q sender.php &");
 Problem being, it's not returning immediately, but waiting for the script to finish. I want it to run in the background and have the system call itself return right away. I also tried running a similar script in my Linux terminal, and in fact the prompt doesn't show until after the script has finished, even though my test output doesn't run, indicating it's really running in the background. What I already tried Perl's exec() function - same result of system(). Changing the command to: "php -q sender.php | at now"), hoping that the "at" daemon would return and that the PHP process itself wouldn't be attached to Perl. Executing the command 'indirectly': "/bin/sh -c 'php -q sender.php &'" - still waits until sender.php is finished sending. fork()'ing the process and executing the system call in the child (hopefully detached process) - same result as above My test environment Just to be sure that I'm not missing anything obvious, I created a sleeper.php script which just sleeps five seconds before exiting. And a test.cgi script that is like this, verbatim: #!/usr/local/bin/perl
system("php sleeper.php &");
print "Content-type: text/html\n\ndone";
 What should I try now?
@CODE:system("php -q sender.php &"); #!/usr/local/bin/perl
system("php sleeper.php &");
print "Content-type: text/html\n\ndone";

Currently I'm using separate controls for the selection icons and the usercontrol containment.

Here is a screenshot of the basic UI. The styling is mostly about how to get the tabcontrols page selection to look like my column of icons.

@CONTENT:I am writing an application needs to use large audio multi-samples, usually around 50 mb in size. One file contains approximately 80 individual short sound recordings, which can get played back by my application at any time. For this reason all the audio data gets loaded into memory for quick access. However, when loading one of these files, it can take many seconds to put into memory because I need to read a large amount of data with ifstream, meaning my program GUI is temporarily frozen. I have tried memory mapping my file but this causes huge CPU spikes and a mess of audio every time I need to jump to a different area of the file, which is not acceptable. So this has led me to think that performing an Asynchronous file read will solve my problem, that is the data gets read in a different process and calls a function on completion. This needs to be both compatible for Mac OS X and Windows and in C++. Can anyone give me some help? Thanks in advance :-) EDIT: Don't want to use the Boost library because I want to keep a small code base.

@TITLE:Having a problem getting mysqli_query to execute
@CONTENT:Here's the problem: I started a swap today to use mysqli. No biggie, just had to change a few statements. Everything went fine, no errors... Except that I can't get it to execute any queries at all. I have double and triple checked my syntax. I even started creating situations where it SHOULD return an error (Trying to get it to INSERT to Tables that don't exist or with values that exceeded column limits or didn't match type) and... nothing. It doesn't return an error, it doesn't write. It WILL complain if parameter one is NOT a mysqli type. Here's the relevant code: $con = mysqli_connect("localhost", "root", "","test");

if (mysqli_connect_errno()) {
printf("Connect failed: %s\n", mysqli_connect_error());
exit();
}

$query = "INSERT INTO files VALUES (NULL, 5, 'hello')";
mysqli_query($con, $query);
 And nothing. It runs without a problem, but it never writes the record. I can even change the $query to "hdjhkfhhjfkd" and it runs no problem. mysqli_query() just isn't executing, period. The only time I can get it to react is if I change $con to anything else, then it complains that it needs a mysqli type. Thoughts? THis is driving me bonkers.
@CODE:$con = mysqli_connect("localhost", "root", "","test");

if (mysqli_connect_errno()) {
printf("Connect failed: %s\n", mysqli_connect_error());
exit();
}

@CONTENT:So I'm having a head against the wall moment and hoping somebody can come help either remove the wall or stop my head from moving!! Over the last 3/4 weeks I've been investigating ORM's in readyness for a new project. The ORM must map to an existing, large and ageing SQL database. So I tried Subsonic. I really liked v2 and v3 after modding to work nicely with VB and named schemas in SQL was running OK. However, its lack of flexibility of having separate entity properties names vs column names had me pulling my hair out (sorry Rob). I tried Entity Framework but I found like others it lacking in certain areas. So I bit the bullet and tried nHibernate but after a week or so getting it working how I liked (with help from Codesmith to generate classes/hbms for me) I'm frustrated with the time it takes to startup (build a config object), despite trying a number of tricks to reduce this time. I'm essentially after building a DAL class that I can share between apps and websites. Am I barking up the wrong tree? For a legacy project with 100s of tables should I go back to ado.net and use DTOs? Aarrgh! Sorry for the ranty style of question. I don't have much hair left and I'd like to keep what I have!! Thanks in advance, Ed PS. I should add that I know SQL very well and not scared of getting my hands dirty to write fast queries. If anything I don't need to be hid from SQL

@TITLE:Mac solution for ：safe； alternatives to ：unsafe； C/C++ Standard Library functions?
@CONTENT:What's the best one-stop-shop "safe" C library solution on the Mac? I use quotes on "safe"/"unsafe" because there is much debate as to the benefits of certain Standard Library functions or their putatively improved alternatives. Many traditional Standard C Library functions (e.g., vfprintf) are considered to be unsafe due to the potential for buffer overflow or other security problems. On Windows, the Microsoft C/C++ compilers provide the "_s" functions (e.g., vfprintf_s) as a safer alternative to the standard library calls. These functions are not drop-in replacements since they have the different signatures necessary to provide additional safety information (e.g., buffer length). They also provide other features such as invalid format string detection, different file security, etc. As far as I know, this implementation is not available on the Mac. Does Apple (or a third party) provide anything similar for use with GCC on OSX? In particular, I'm looking for "safe" implementations of at least the following functions: fopen vfprintf vsprintf sprintf strncpy strcpy strcat Please note: This question is about the Mac. I am NOT asking for your opinions about Microsoft's implementation (unless it's available on the Mac.) Although some of these functions might be easy to write myself, not all are. I am NOT asking how to write these myself. I'm NOT asking for tips on how to use STL classes to do this. I'm NOT asking how to turn off warnings. My particular needs are very specific. I'm trying to identify a best-practice Mac API that is as similar as possible to the traditional C library calls while adding safety. Of course a portable implementation that works on Mac and Windows (and other operating systems) would be even better.

@TITLE:What is the equivalent of 'fread' from Matlab in Python?
@CONTENT:I have practically no knowledge of Matlab, and need to translate some parsing routines into Python. They are for large files, that are themselves divided into 'blocks', and I'm having difficulty right from the off with the checksum at the top of the file. What exactly is going on here in Matlab? status = fseek(fid, 0, 'cof');
fposition = ftell(fid);
disp(' ');
disp(['** Block ',num2str(iBlock),' File Position = ',int2str(fposition)]);

% ----------------- Block Start ------------------ %
[A, count] = fread(fid, 3, 'uint32');
if(count == 3)
    magic_l = A(1);
    magic_h = A(2);
    block_length = A(3);
else
    if(fposition == file_length)
        disp(['** End of file OK']);
    else
        disp(['** Cannot read block start magic !  Note File Length = ',num2str(file_length)]);
    end
    ok = 0;
    break;
end
 fid is the file currently being looked at iBlock is a counter for which 'block' you're in within the file magic_l and magic_h are to do with checksums later, here is the code for that (follows straight from the code above): disp(sprintf('  Magic_L = %08X, Magic_H = %08X, Length = %i', magic_l, magic_h, block_length));
correct_magic_l = hex2dec('4D445254');
correct_magic_h = hex2dec('43494741');

if(magic_l ~= correct_magic_l | magic_h ~= correct_magic_h)
    disp(['** Bad block start magic !']);
    ok = 0;
    return;
end

remaining_length = block_length - 3*4 - 3*4;   % We read Block Header, and we expect a footer
disp(sprintf('  Remaining Block bytes = %i', remaining_length));
 What is going on with the %08X and the hex2dec stuff? Also, why specify 3*4 instead of 12? Really though, I want to know how to replicate [A, count] = fread(fid, 3, 'uint32'); in Python, as io.readline() is just pulling the first 3 characters of the file. Apologies if I'm missing the point somewhere here. It's just that using io.readline(3) on the file seems to return something it shouldn't, and I don't understand how the block_length can fit in a single byte when it could potentially be very long. Thanks for reading this ramble. I hope you can understand kind of what I want to know! (Any insight at all is appreciated.)

The relevant method I changed now looks like:     private static IntPtr HookCallback(int nCode, IntPtr wParam, IntPtr lParam)
    {
        if (nCode >= 0 && wParam == (IntPtr)WM_KEYDOWN)
        {

            KBDLLHOOKSTRUCT replacementKey = (KBDLLHOOKSTRUCT)Marshal.PtrToStructure(lParam, typeof(KBDLLHOOKSTRUCT));
            replacementKey.vkCode = 90; // char 'Z'
            Marshal.StructureToPtr(replacementKey, lParam, false);

        return CallNextHookEx(_hookID, nCode, wParam, lParam);
    }
 The console correctly outputs this as: E
Z
T
Z
G
Z
etc.
 HOWEVER, the in focus app still types 'E' instead of 'Z'. Why? I changed the hooked keyboard input to contain 'Z' instead of 'E', and the console lines show that it was changed correctly! As I understand it, calling the return CallNextHookEx(_hookID, nCode, wParam, lParam); is what sends the "print this now" command to the open app. Is that not how it works? Is there something that's preventing me from typing the character I want? I know apps like AutoHotkey take an input key, check it, and return a different character. How do I do the same here? Thanks!

@TITLE:A select query selecting a select statement
@CONTENT:I don't even know if I am doing this query the right way. There is a Sandwiches table that has some 7 fields and 2 of them are comboboxes (Type and Bread). So I made a query that combines all of the comboboxes values into one query, like this: SELECT TypesAndBreads.TBName, TypesAndBreads.Type
FROM (SELECT [Sandwiches Types].[Sandwich Type] As TBName, "Sandwich Type" As Type
    FROM [Sandwiches Types]
UNION ALL
    SELECT Breads.Bread As TBName, "Bread" As Type 
    FROM Breads)  AS TypesAndBreads;
 I get the flat values of the tables now I want to count all the sandwiches under each TypesAndBreads.TBName. I have this, just to make sure it works with all the Sandwiches: SELECT TypesAndBread.Type, TypesAndBread.TBName,
       (SELECT Count(Sandwiches.[SandwichID]) As SandwichCount
        FROM Sandwiches) As SandwichCount
FROM TypesAndBread;
 But I want to reference the current Type and TBName inside the subquery. Something like this: SELECT TypesAndBread.Type, TypesAndBread.TBName,
       (SELECT Count(Sandwiches.[SandwichID]) As SandwichCount
        FROM Sandwiches
        WHERE Sandwiches.[TypesAndBread.Type] = Sandwiches.[TypesAndBread.TBName]) As SandwichCount
FROM TypesAndBread;
 But of course this doesn't work. I didn't think it will, just thought of giving it a try. I was thinking of maybe constructing the query with VBA when they open the Report that this query is going to be based of. So I guess my question is: Is there a way to reference the current selected fields in a subquery? Or is there a different way to approach this? Thanks for the help EDIT: My table structure is like this: Sandwiches's fields | SandwichID | Name | Date Added | Chef | Sandwich Type | Bread | Reviewed By |
 where Sandwich Type and Bread are Lookup fields for these tables: Sandwiches Types's fields | Sandwich Type |
 Breads's fields | Bread |
 The TypesAndBreads query combined the Sandwiches Types and Breads tables, but the reason for that is so that I can get the count of all the sandwiches that have that Type or bread. A result like this: +=============================================+
|      Type     |    TBName   | SandwichCount |
+=============================================+
| Sandwich Type | Turkey Club |            10 |
| Bread         | Italian     |             5 |
| Bread         | Garlic      |             8 |
+---------------------------------------------+
 the example result's first row basicly says there are 10 sandwiches in record with the Sandwich Type field equal to Turkey Club. I hope that explains it better.
@CODE:Sandwiches Type Bread SELECT TypesAndBreads.TBName, TypesAndBreads.Type
FROM (SELECT [Sandwiches Types].[Sandwich Type] As TBName, "Sandwich Type" As Type
    FROM [Sandwiches Types]
UNION ALL
    SELECT Breads.Bread As TBName, "Bread" As Type 
    FROM Breads)  AS TypesAndBreads; TypesAndBreads.TBName SELECT TypesAndBread.Type, TypesAndBread.TBName,

        FROM Sandwiches

@TITLE:Is SubSonic dying
@CONTENT:I'm real interested in using SubSonic, I've downloaded it and I'm enjoying it so far, but looking at the activity on github and googlegroups it doesn't seem to be very active and looks a lot like a project that's dying. There's no videos about it on tekpub and Rob seems to be using nHibernate for all his projects these days. I don't want to focus on learning SubSonic and integrating it into my projects if it's not going to live much longer. So my question is what's happening with subsonic development, is there a new release imminent is there lots going on behind the scenes or is it as inactive as it seems?

@TITLE:Local alternative to JNLP file?
@CONTENT:Try as I might, I can't get a JNLP file to run locally (via a double-click). It seems to be an issue of locating a jar file, even when I specify it relative to the jnlp file. I get the following error: The field <jar>href has an invalid value: helloworld.jar This happens even when the JNLP file is in the same folder as helloworld.jar. I've done searches and this is a consistent problem especially for people who want to package an application on a CD and use JNLP. The only Sun-provided "solution" is the ability to specify the codebase via command line, but that doesn't really help much. I don't understand why they don't assume or allow the codebase to be "." or "file://." - I tried these sorts of things in the codebase parameter of the jnlp tag (inside the file) and nothing worked. It is extremely convenient for me to use a JNLP file because I don't need to worry about platform detection, native libraries, or even the main JOGL jar files; I simply include this line and everything is done for me: <extension name="JOGL" href="http://download.java.net/media/jogl/builds/archive/jsr-231-2.0-beta10/webstart/jogl-all-awt.jnlp" />
 I'm hoping to find something that can do the same sort of thing. If not, I can manually (or with Ant) grab the JOGL jar files, it's not a big deal; just one of those things that JNLP does for me and I'm really going to miss. What is the best alternative to JNLP files, for me to use locally (i.e. double-click to run)? Is there anything so elegant or do I just need to write a shell script for Linux, a batch file for Windows, and have Ant detect and download the appropriate JOGL jars?

@TITLE:Randomized algorithm for finding hamiltonian path in a directed graph
@CONTENT:From this Wikipedia article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_path_problem A randomized algorithm for Hamiltonian path that is fast on most graphs is the following: Start from a random vertex, and continue if there is a neighbor not visited. If there are no more unvisited neighbors, and the path formed isn't Hamiltonian, pick a neighbor uniformly at random, and rotate using that neighbor as a pivot. (That is, add an edge to that neighbor, and remove one of the existing edges from that neighbor so as not to form a loop.) Then, continue the algorithm at the new end of the path. I don't quite understand how this pivoting process is supposed to work. Can someone explain this algorithm in more detail? Perhaps we can eventually update the Wiki article with a more clear description. Edit 1: I think I understand the algorithm now, but it seems like it only works for undirected graphs. Can anyone confirm that? Here's why I think it only works for undirected graphs: Pretend the vertices are numbered like so: 123
456
789
 Let's say my path so far is: 9, 5, 4, 7, 8. 8's neighbors have all been visited. Let's say I choose 5 to remove an edge from. If I remove (9, 5), I just end up creating a cycle: 5, 4, 7, 8, 5, so it seems I have to remove (5, 4) and create (8, 5). If the graph is undirected, that's fine and now my path is 9, 5, 8, 7, 4. But if you imagine those edges being directed, that's not necessarily a valid path, since (8, 5) is an edge but (5, 8) might not be. Edit 2: I guess for a directed graph I could create the (8, 5) connection and then let the new path be just 4, 7, 8, 5, but that seems counter productive since I have to chop off everything that previously led up to vertex 5.

@TITLE:C# params keyword with two parameters of the same type
@CONTENT:I just encountered something with C# today that I hadn't thought of before. I have two methods in my class, one an overload of the other. They are declared like so: 1) public void RequirePermissions(params string[] permissions)...
2) public void RequirePermissions(string message, params string[] permissions)...
 In my code, I tried to call the first one like so: RequirePermissions("Permission1", "Permission2");
 ...expecting it to call the first overload. Well it called the second overload. The only way I can get it to call the first method in this case is to manually pass a string[] object like so: RequirePermissions(new string[] { "Permission1", "Permission2" });
 Now, this behavior doesn't confuse me because I understand that the compiler can't tell which method I actually wanted to call based on my provided parameters. But was I not careful this could have gone unnoticed in my code. It seems as though Microsoft should have made the compiler throw an error when it encountered a situation like above. Does anyone have any thoughts on this? Is there another way to call the first overload other than the "solution" I posted?
@CODE:1) public void RequirePermissions(params string[] permissions)...

@TITLE:How can I automate the building of a Flex component library?
@CONTENT:I would like to build a flex library project automatically instead of the current process, which involves one of our developers compiling it on his machine and then us checking in the resulting .swc file. It's gross. I am coming at this from the perspective of a java developer, so I'm having a hard time getting the hang of the compilation tools provided in the Flex Builder 3 application, but here's what I already have: I have created an ant file that loads the ant task library correctly, and can therefore execute <mxmlc/> and <compc/> tasks. I have located the source code that I need to build, and know what sort of .swc I want to end up with. What I want is an ant script that will do the equivalent of these steps: We build all sources (actionscript and MXML) and assets in the project into an swc file. The library.swf file is extracted and optimized So far I have this: <target name="compile-component" depends="init">
  <compc output="${DEPLOY_DIR}/${SWC_NAME}.swc">
    <source-path path-element="${FLEX_HOME}/frameworks"/>
    <source-path path-element="${SRC_DIR}"/>
  </compc>
</target>
 However, it's not including any content: [compc] Loading configuration file /Applications/Adobe Flex Builder 3/sdks/3.2.0/frameworks/flex-config.xml

I am not so familiar with dynamic libraries on Mac, but from what I understand, I have 2 options: .dylib or frameworks. What would be the best option? Why? Few related questions: If I understand well, .dylib have to be installed in one of the stnadard UNIX directories such as /usr/lib, etc. Hence using a .dylib should make my customer's installer much more complex, since they'll probably need to request permission to write something in a system folder? Can frameworks be private and embedded within my customer's bundle? So noone else can see/use them? Any constructive criticisms/comments/ideas more than welcome. Thanks in advance. Alex

 Or I could use a pointer declaration private:
   Someclass * instance_
 And then use new() on it in the constructor. I understand that if SomeClass could be derived from another class, a COM object or is an ABC then it should be a pointer. Are there any other guidelines that I should be aware of?

@CONTENT:I may be asking the wrong question here, I'm willing to change it if so. I have a project that is using the Microsoft.NET Oracle provider (our plan is to change to ODP but we haven't done so yet). I am trying to get this project to build on a windows 2008 (x64) build server. It builds just fine but our unit tests fail when they hit stuff on the Oracle database. I had initially installed the 32bit oracle 9i client which is what we currently use on our winxp dev boxes and the previous 2003 build server. But now this gets a message like: Attempt to load Oracle client libraries threw BadImageFormatException. This problem will occur when running in 64 bit mode with the 32 bit Oracle client components installed. We tried compiling to the x86 platform but that didn't change the error message. I now have the 11g 64 bit client installed but I am getting a message saying System.Data.OracleClient requires Oracle client software version 8.1.7 or greater. So what Oracle install should I be using? Edit: I was able to get this to work. Turned out it was the testing causing the problem, by forcing NUnit to run in 32bit mode: http://geekswithblogs.net/Lance/archive/2006/12/28/102191.aspx I was able to get the tests to work using the old 32 bit driver. This would be a crappy answer to the question so I am not using it but will gladly award the correct answer to anyone putting in some good info on transitioning to Oracle 64bit drivers.

@TITLE:Initializing Class Fields at the Field Definition or in Class Constructor
@CONTENT:I have a class with a field that needs to be initialized when the object is initialized, such as a list that needs to be created before objects can be added/removed from it. public class MyClass1
{
    private List<MyOtherClass> _otherClassList;

 I need too pass an array (fixed length) of these structs over to native Code, which writes some data to these structures. The array is allocated in C# and passed over to the C dll. I declared the imported function as: [DllImport("marshall.dll", CallingConvention = CallingConvention.Cdecl)]
private static extern void doIt(RECORD[] dataRecord);
 but I don't get any data back. I already tried the PInvoke Interop Assistant. Should I use IntPtr here? Any ideas? Edit: Here is the C# code to call the native function: RECORD[] rec = new RECORD[256];
doIt(rec);
// values of rec are all zero here
 Here is the C function: int doIt(RECORD* rec)
{
    // deref pointer and write some data
}

@TITLE:MD5 hash calculates differently on server
@CONTENT:I am running some code that I have written in C which calls the md5 hashing functionality from a hashing library that someone else wrote (md5.c & md5.h). The odd behavior I have been seeing is: hashing working perfectly = I hash a string, and it comes out to the exact hash that I have verified it to be with multiple other sources. Hashing functionality works perfectly when compiling and running on my OSX machine and the hash that is computed is exactly as it should be. Same code, no changes is uploaded and compiled on the Linux based server and it computes a different (wrong) hash. Does anyone have any insight on how exactly this would be possible? Its been driving crazy for the past week and I do not understand why this is even possible. I have also tested it on another machine, compiled and executed and it works perfectly. Its just when I upload it to the server that the hash is no longer correct. The hashing functionality file can be found at: http://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/Md5.c SOLVED: Thanks everyone It was the 64-bit arch issue. Its mighty annoying that that slipped my mind to consider that when debugging.......

@TITLE:Can I use mSysGit and Cygwin's git?
@CONTENT:After migrating to Windows, I'm using msysgit with its included bash shell, and that's working well for me. But I have issues: our ant build process won't run in that shell, I'd like to use Cygwin's xterms instead of the Windows command window, since the terminal compatibility isn't good enough to run everything else I'd like in that window, and so on. I've actually made a go of sticking with msysgit in the Windows command shell so that I don't have to use a separate window to build, but that's got even more problems: the lack of cd - and file completion is killing me, most of the commands I'd like to pipe to aren't present, etc. So if I switch to using Cygwin's git, or worse, use both at different times, are line-endings going to bite me? Will Cygwin's git expect everything to be \n and think it's seeing changes because mSysGit converted to \r\n when checking out? Will Cygwin's git check out as \n and confuse my Windows Eclipse, which I'm sure wants everything to be \r\n?

@TITLE:How to implements the /svn-history/ path like Google Code Hosting does?
@CONTENT:When you publish a Subversion repository trough Apache Httpd you got an bonus feature: you can browse the HEAD revision of you sources with any HTTP client. For example, we have this repository: http://trash-cli.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
 With any HTTP client (e.g. Firefox) you can browse the files at the HEAD revision. The svnbook explain very well how do that. But Google Code Hosting offer an extra feature: you can browse also the past revisions. For example you can browse the r10 revision: http://trash-cli.googlecode.com/svn-history/r10/trunk/
 Do you know how Google do that? I want this feature in my company repository too! :) Thanks Update 1 The following behavior may help us to solve the problem. If I visit a path that doesn't exist in repository, for example http://trash-cli.googlecode.com/svn-history/r10/non-existent
 I got the following 404 error: Not Found The requested URL /svn/!svn/bc/10/non-existent was not found on this server. I suspect that there is a URL rewrite rule under the scene. Update 2 Please note that this is not the same of this question. I want to expose the this service on my company repository in a way that is comfortable to the user in a way that Google Code do, I'm not interested how to get old revision in a external repository that doesn't has this feature. I'm using the perspective of the service provider, not the perspective of the user. I want make life easier to my colleagues.

@TITLE:What's best way to secure a database connection string?
@CONTENT:I am writing a set of database-driven applications in PHP. These applications will run on a Linux server as its own user. Other users will likely be on the system at times, but have very controlled access. Other servers they will not have access to at all. I will also expose a limit stored procedure API to developers who need to write Perl scripts that access the database using a DBI and a set of functions I write. My question is what the best way to secure the config files that have connection strings in them? Is a different user with [4+]00 permissions on the file sufficient? Should I encrypt them? That seems to just shift the problem elsewhere so that I worry about where to store an encryption key. I realize the Perl developers will need to have a connection string of their own as they will only have execute database permissions.

@TITLE:Maintaining subclass integrity in a relational database
@CONTENT:Let's say I have a table that represents a super class, students. And then I have N tables that represent subclasses of that object (athletes, musicians, etc). How can I express a constraint such that a student must be modeled in one (not more, not less) subclass? Clarifications regarding comments: This is being maintained manually, not through an ORM package. The project this relates to sits atop SQL Server (but it would be nice to see a generic solution) This may not have been the best example. There are a couple scenarios we can consider regarding subclassing, and I just happened to invent this student/athlete example. A) In true object-oriented fashion, it's possible that the superclass can exist by itself and need not be modeled in any subclasses. B) In real life, any object or student can have multiple roles. C) The particular scenario I was trying to illustrate was requiring that every object be implemented in exactly one subclass. Think of the superclass as an abstract implementation, or just commonalities factored out of otherwise disparate object classes/instances. Thanks to all for your input, especially Bill.

@TITLE:How do I Unit Test Actions without Mocking that use UpdateModel?
@CONTENT:I have been working my way through Scott Guthrie's excellent post on ASP.NET MVC Beta 1. In it he shows the improvements made to the UpdateModel method and how they improve unit testing. I have recreated a similar project however anytime I run a UnitTest that contains a call to UpdateModel I receive an ArgumentNullException naming the controllerContext parameter. Here's the relevant bits, starting with my model: public class Country {
  public Int32 ID { get; set; }
  public String Name { get; set; }
  public String Iso3166 { get; set; }
}
 The controller action: [AcceptVerbs(HttpVerbs.Post)]
public ActionResult Edit(Int32 id, FormCollection form)
{
  using ( ModelBindingDataContext db = new ModelBindingDataContext() ) {
    Country country = db.Countries.Where(c => c.CountryID == id).SingleOrDefault();

    try {
      UpdateModel(country, form);

      db.SubmitChanges();

      return RedirectToAction("Index");
    }
    catch {
      return View(country);
    }
  }
}
 And finally my unit test that's failing: [TestMethod]
public void Edit()
{
  CountryController controller = new CountryController();
  FormCollection form = new FormCollection();
  form.Add("Name", "Canada");
  form.Add("Iso3166", "CA");

  var result = controller.Edit(2 /*Canada*/, form) as RedirectToRouteResult;

  Assert.IsNotNull(result, "Expected to be redirected on successful POST.");
  Assert.AreEqual("Show", result.RouteName, "Expected to redirect to the View action.");
}
 ArgumentNullException is thrown by the call to UpdateModel with the message "Value cannot be null. Parameter name: controllerContext". I'm assuming that somewhere the UpdateModel requires the System.Web.Mvc.ControllerContext which isn't present during execution of the test. I'm also assuming that I'm doing something wrong somewhere and just need to pointed in the right direction. Help Please!

@TITLE:Inside a batch file, how can I tell whether a process is running?
@CONTENT:I'd like to write a batch file that checks to see if a process is running, and takes one action if it is, and another action if it isn't.

@TITLE:How do I GetModuleFileName() if I only have a window handle (hWnd)?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to get the name of the executable of a window that is outside my C# 2.0 application. My app currently gets a window handle (hWnd) using the GetForegroundWindow() call from "user32.dll". From the digging that I've been able to do, I think I want to use the GetModuleFileNameEx() function (from PSAPI) to obtain the name, but GetModuleFileNameEx() requires a handle to a Process, not a Window. Is it possible to get a process handle from a window handle? (Do I need to get the thread handle of the window first?) EDITED the first sentence to make it clearer what I'm trying to do. UPDATE! Here's the C# code that I found worked for me. The only caveat is occasionally it returns a file/path where the drive letter is a "?" instead of the actual drive letter (like "C"). -- Haven't figured out why yet. [DllImport("user32.dll")]

@CONTENT:I want to convert from char representing a hexadecimal value (in upper or lower case) to byte, like '0'->0, '1' -> 1, 'A' -> 10, 'a' -> 10, 'f' -> 15 etc...
 I will be calling this method extremely often, so performance is important. Is there a faster way than to use a pre-initialized HashMap<Character,Byte> to get the value from? Answer It seems like it's a tossup between using a switch-case and Jon Skeet's direct computing solution - the switch-case solution seems to edge out ever so slightly, though. Greg's array method wins out. Here are the performance results (in ms) for 200,000,000 runs of the various methods: Character.getNumericValue:

Character.digit:

@CONTENT:In an ideal world, our development processes would be perfect, resulting in regular releases that were so thoroughly tested that it would never be necessary to "hotfix" a running application. But, unfortunately, we live in the real world, and sometimes bugs slip past us and don't rear their ugly heads until we're already busy coding away at the next release. And the bug needs to be fixed Now. Not as a part of the next scheduled release. Not tonight when the traffic dies down. Now. How do you deal with this need? It really can run counter to good design practices, like refactoring your code into nice, discrete class libraries. Hand-editing markup and stored procedures on a production server can be a recipe for disaster, but it can also avert disaster. What are some good strategies for application design and deployment techniques to find a balance between maintenance needs and good coding practices?

@TITLE:Is anyone familiar with Jaxer? I'm looking for pros and cons
@CONTENT:I realize that this question has been asked before, but it has been a month with no decent responses... I'm looking at Aptana's Jaxer and I find the concept to be very exciting. Here is a quick overview for those who are not familiar with it: Jaxer is, in their words, "the world's first true AJAX server". It is based on the Mozilla engine so scripts are written with javascript and you have complete access to the DOM on the server-side. Scripts are placed on your pages with <script> tags and you can specify a runat attribute (ala ASP.NET) to mark scripts for execution on the client, server, both, or as a "server-proxy" which makes the functions available on the client, but they execute on the server via AJAX. This also means that you can use your favorite client-side libraries (jQuery, Prototype) on the server as well as the client. It also can be used to process documents that are generated in another language (e.g. php, ruby) which I imagine is not practical except to help in transitioning existing applications to use Jaxer. What are the pros and cons? How mature/stable is it the API? How good is performance compared to other server-side html preprocessors? Has anyone used Jaxer with another technology (php, pearl, ruby, etc.) and what were your experiences? EDIT: I've posted another question regarding a drawback I discovered while playing with Jaxer: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/109762/defining-objects-when-using-jaxer

@TITLE:How to dynamically load reducers for code splitting in a Redux application?
@CONTENT:I'm going migrate to Redux. My application consists of a lot of parts (pages, components) so I want to create many reducers. Redux examples show that I should use combineReducers() to generate one reducer. Also as I understand Redux application should have one store and it is created once the application starts. When the store is being created I should pass my combined reducer. This makes sense if the application is not too big. But what if I build more than one JavaScript bundle? For example, each page of application has own bundle. I think in this case the one combined reducer is not good. I looked through the sources of Redux and I have found replaceReducer() function. It seems to be what I want. I could create combined reducer for each part my application and use replaceReducer() when I move between parts of application. Is this a good approach?

@TITLE:when does `datetime.now(pytz_timezone)` fail?
@CONTENT:delorean docs show this way to get the current time in a given timezone using datetime: from datetime import datetime
from pytz import timezone

EST = "US/Eastern"
UTC = "UTC"

d = datetime.utcnow()
utc = timezone(UTC)
est = timezone(EST)
d = utc.localize(d)
d = est.normalize(EST)
 and compare it with the delorian-based code: from delorean import Delorean

EST = "US/Eastern"

d = Delorean(timezone=EST)
 I believe the datetime example should be written as: from datetime import datetime
import pytz

eastern_timezone = pytz.timezone("US/Eastern")
d = datetime.now(eastern_timezone)
 that is more consice. Are there any cases when the last code example fails while the first one continues to work? Update: the current example: from datetime import datetime
import pytz

d = datetime.utcnow()
d = pytz.utc.localize(d)

est = pytz.timezone('US/Eastern')
d = est.normalize(d)
return d
 that is still too verbose. The question stills stands: do you need the explicit round-trip via utc and tz.normalize() or can you use datetime.now(tz) instead?

@CONTENT:According to the selenium documentation, interactions between the webdriver client and a browser is done via JSON Wire Protocol. Basically the client, written in python, ruby, java whatever, sends JSON messages to the web browser and the web browser responds with JSON too. Is there a way to view/catch/log these JSON messages while running a selenium test? For example (in Python): from selenium import webdriver

driver = webdriver.Chrome()
driver.get('http://google.com')

driver.close()
 I want to see what JSON messages are going between the python selenium webdriver client and a browser when I instantiate the driver (in this case Chrome): webdriver.Chrome(), when I'm getting a page: driver.get('http://google.com') and when I'm closing it: driver.close(). FYI, in the #SFSE: Stripping Down Remote WebDriver tutorial, it is done via capturing the network traffic between the local machine where the script is running and the remote selenium server. I'm tagging the question as Python specific, but really would be happy with any pointers.

 ... and I can calculate Pi monteCarlo(100000, circleTest) * 4

 How can I edit the jQuery code or what do I need to do to get rid of this exception being thrown? The part of the jQuery code where the first exception is being thrown : assert(function (div) {
    // Support: Windows 8 Native Apps
    // The type and name attributes are restricted during .innerHTML assignment

}
 TooLongDon'tRead - Things I've tried : From what I understand, it's suppose to throw the exception, however microsoft won't approve an app that is throwing any errors/exceptions... I'm quite confused that there isn't a clear cut answer to this (that is easily found), since it is likely an issue everyone has that uses jquery with visual studio. I even tried using jquery2.02 which people said didn't throw these exceptions , but it still did for me. I tried editing the jquery code myself, but that caused a whole lot of other errors. I also tried the jquery for windows 8 in nuget (that hasn't been updated in like 2 years)... that I guess was suppose to resolve this stuff, but it actually gave me even more runtime errors.

@CONTENT:I'm getting an Out Of Memory exception using Picasso when loading "large" images (> 1.5MB) from Android Gallery (using startActivityForResult). I'm using a custom Target object because I need to preprocess the Bitmap when it is ready and also I'm using a custom Transform object to scale the Bitmap. The problem is that the method public Bitmap transform(Bitmap source) on my Transform object is never called because the Out Of Memory Exception, so I don't get the oportunity to resample the image. But, if I use the .resize(maxWidth, maxHeight) method, then it loads the image OK. I supossed that the Transform object was for that purpose too, but it seems that the transform method is called after the resize, and, if I don't call resize, then it will end in an Out of Memory.. The problem is that with resize I need to specify both width and height, but I need to scale and keep the aspect ratio. Consider that the images will be selected from user Gallery, so they can be bigger or smaller, portrait, squared or landscape, etc, so I need my own Transformation object to perform the logic that needs my application.

@TITLE:MyBatis Batch Insert/Update For Oracle
@CONTENT:I've recently started learning to use myBatis.I am now facing such a scenario, I need to constantly fetch a new list of Objects through WebService, then for this list, I need to insert/update each object into the oracle DB table through myBatis. The tricky part is, I cannot simply do a batch insert every time, because some of the objects might already exist in DB, for these records, I need to update the fields of them instead of a new insertion. My current solution might be very stupid, using Java, build the list of Object from webservice, loop through each of them, do a myBatis select, if it is not a null(already exists in the db), then do a myBatis update; otherwise, do a myBatis insert for this new object. The function is achieved. But my technical lead says it is very low-efficient, since doing a for loop using Java and insert/update one by one will consume a lot of system resource. He advised me to do batch insert using myBatis by passing a list of objects in. Batch insertion in myBatis is straightforward, however, since I am not purely inserting(for existing records I need to do update), I don't think batch insert is appropriate here. I've googled a while for this, and realized maybe I will need to use "merge" instead of "insert" (for Oracle). The examples I googled out for merge in myBatis is only for one object, not in a batch. Thus I want to find out whether experts could offer me some examples on how to do a batch-merge in MyBatis( The correct way to write a Mapper)?

@TITLE:R: interactive plots (tooltips): rCharts dimple plot: formatting axis
@CONTENT:I have some charts created with ggplot2 which I would like to embed in a web application: I'd like to enhance the plots with tooltips. I've looked into several options. I'm currently experimenting with the rCharts library and, among others, dimple plots. Here is the original ggplot: Here is a first attempt to transpose this to a dimple plot: I have several issues: after formatting the y-axis with percentages, the data is altered. after formatting the x-axis to correctly render dates, too many labels are printed. I am not tied to dimple charts, so if there are other options that allow for an easier way to tweak axis formats I'd be happy to know. (the Morris charts look nice too, but tweaking them looks even harder, no?) Objective: Fix the axes and add tooltips that give both the date (in the format 1984) and the value (in the format 40%). If I can fix 1 and 2, I'd be very happy. But here is another, less important question, in case someone has suggestions: Could I add the line labels ("Top 10%") to the tooltips when hovering over the lines? After downloading the data from: https://gist.github.com/ptoche/872a77b5363356ff5399, a data frame is created: df <- read.csv("ps-income-shares.csv")
 The basic dimple plot is created with: library("rCharts")
p <- dPlot(
    value ~ Year,
    groups = c("Fractile"),
    data = transform(df, Year = as.character(format(as.Date(Year), "%Y"))),
    type = "line",
    bounds = list(x = 50, y = 50, height = 300, width = 500)
)
 While basic, so far so good. However, the following command, intended to convert the y-data to percentages, alters the data: p$yAxis(type = "addMeasureAxis", showPercent = TRUE)
 What am I doing wrong with showPercent? For reference, here is the ggplot code: library("ggplot2")
library("scales")
p <- ggplot(data = df, aes(x = Year, y = value, color = Fractile))
p <- p + geom_line()
p <- p + theme_bw()
p <- p + scale_x_date(limits = as.Date(c("1911-01-01", "2023-01-01")), labels = date_format("%Y"))
p <- p + scale_y_continuous(labels = percent)
p <- p + theme(legend.position = "none")
p <- p + geom_text(data = subset(df, Year == "2012-01-01"), aes(x = Year, label = Fractile, hjust = -0.2), size = 4)
p <- p + xlab("")
p <- p + ylab("")

 For information, the chart above is based on the data put together by Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez in their study of U.S. top incomes. The data and more may be found on their website, e.g. http://elsa.berkeley.edu/users/saez/ http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/en/ EDIT: Here is a screenshot of Ramnath's solution, with a title added and axis labels tweaked. Thanks Ramnath! p$xAxis(inputFormat = '%Y-%m-%d', outputFormat = '%Y')
p$yAxis(outputFormat = "%")
p$setTemplate(afterScript = "

@TITLE:Numpy selecting specific column index per row by using a list of indexes
@CONTENT:I'm struggling to select the specific columns per row of a numpy matrix. I'm after a good way of solving the following issue Suppose I have the following matrix which I would call X [1, 2, 3]
[4, 5, 6]
[7, 8, 9]
 I also have a list of column indexes per every row which I would call Y [1, 0, 2]
 I need to get the values [2]
[4]
[9]
 Instead of a list with indexes Y I can also produce a matrix with the same shape as X where every column is a bool/(int in the range 0-1 value indicating whether this is the required column. [0, 1, 0]
[1, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 1]
 I know this can be done with iterating over the array and selecting the column values I need, however I was wondering if there is a better solution. This will be executed frequently on big arrays of data and that's why i has to run as fast as it can. Thank you
@CODE:[1, 2, 3]
[4, 5, 6]
[7, 8, 9] [1, 0, 2] [2]
[4]
[9] [0, 1, 0]
[1, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 1]

@TITLE:C++ template functions overload resolution
@CONTENT:I have the following code: #include <iostream>

template <typename T>
void f (T) { std::cout << "f(T)" << std::endl; }

template <typename T>
void f (bool) { std::cout << "f(bool)" << std::endl; }

int main ( )
{
    f(true);        // #1 prints f(T)
    f<bool>(true);  // #2 prints f(bool)
}
 The #1 line calls f(T), while #2 line calls f(bool). Why does this happen? And what are the rules for selecting an overloaded template function? UPDATE I understood that in the first call compiler is just unable to deduce T while trying to call the second function, so the first is chosen. In the second call second function is considered a better match on gcc, while the first is chosen under VS2013. Who does the right thing here? By the way, I am still interested in the full description of the process.
@CODE:#include <iostream>

template <typename T>
void f (T) { std::cout << "f(T)" << std::endl; }

@TITLE:How can I dynamically add and remove form fields to be validated by Parsley.js?
@CONTENT:I have a form ('#registrations') that I am validating with Parsley.js and so far it is working fine. However, I am trying to dynamically remove form fields and add new ones to Parsley validation, depending on what someone selects in a select drop down ('#manufacturer'). Here is my markup: <select name="manufacturer" id="manufacturer" parsley-required="true" data-error-message="Please select a manufacturer.">

    <option value="apple">Apple</option>

    <option value="blackberry">Blackberry</option>

    <option value="htc">HTC</option>

    <option value="huawei">Huawei</option>

    <option value="lg">LG</option>

    <option value="motorola">Motorola</option>

    <option value="nokia">Nokia</option>

    <option value="samsung">Samsung</option>

    <option value="sony">Sony</option>

    <option value="sony-ericsson">Sony Ericsson</option>

</select>
 Here is my JS: //init parsley
$('#registrations').parsley();

$('#manufacturer').change(function() {

        //define selected value
        var manufacturer = $(this).val();

        //destroy parsley
        $('#registrations').parsley('destroy');

        //remove all models selects from parsley validation
        //if someone has previously selected a different manufacturer
        $('#registrations').parsley('removeItem', '#apple-models');
        $('#registrations').parsley('removeItem', '#blackberry-models');
        $('#registrations').parsley('removeItem', '#htc-models');
        $('#registrations').parsley('removeItem', '#huawei-models');
        $('#registrations').parsley('removeItem', '#lg-models');

@TITLE:Haskell: tail recursion version of depth of binary tree
@CONTENT:First of all I have two different implementation that I believe are correct, and have profiled them and thinking they are about of the same performance: depth::Tree a -> Int
depth Empty        = 0
depth (Branch b l r) = 1 + max (depth l) (depth r)


depthTailRec::Tree a -> Int
depthTailRec = depthTR 0 where
           depthTR d Empty          = d 
           depthTR d (Branch b l r) = let dl = depthTR (d+1) l; dr = depthTR (d+1) r in max dl dr 
 I was just wondering aren't people are talking about how tail recursion can be beneficial for performance? And a lot of questions are jumping into my head: How can you make the depth function faster? I read about something about how Haskell's laziness can reduce the need of tail recursion, is that true? Is it the truth that every recursion can be converted into tail recursion? Finally tail recursion can be faster and space efficient because it can be turned into loops and thus reduce the need to push and pop the stack, is my understanding right?
@CODE:depth::Tree a -> Int
depth Empty        = 0
depth (Branch b l r) = 1 + max (depth l) (depth r)

           depthTR d Empty          = d

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

@LINK:/questions/21027477/joblib-parallel-multiple-cpus-slower-than-single
@TITLE:Joblib Parallel multiple cpu's slower than single
@CONTENT:I've just started using the Joblib module and I'm trying to understand how the Parallel function works. Below is an example of where parallelizing leads to longer runtimes but I don't understand why. My runtime on 1 cpu was 51 sec vs. 217 secs on 2 cpu. My assumption was that running the loop in parallel would copy lists a and b to each processor. Then dispatch item_n to one cpu and item_n+1 to the other cpu, execute the function and then write the results back to a list (in order). Then grab the next 2 items and so on. I'm obviously missing something. Is this a poor example or use of joblib? Did I simply structure the code wrong? Here is the example: import numpy as np
from matplotlib.path import Path
from joblib import Parallel, delayed

## Create pairs of points for line segments
a = zip(np.random.rand(5000,2),np.random.rand(5000,2))

b = zip(np.random.rand(300,2),np.random.rand(300,2))

## Check if one line segment contains another. 
def check_paths(path, paths):
    for other_path in paths:
        res='no cross'
        chck = Path(other_path)
        if chck.contains_path(path)==1:
            res= 'cross'
            break
    return res

res = Parallel(n_jobs=2) (delayed(check_paths) (Path(points), a) for points in b)
@CODE:import numpy as np
from matplotlib.path import Path
from joblib import Parallel, delayed

## Create pairs of points for line segments
a = zip(np.random.rand(5000,2),np.random.rand(5000,2))

        if chck.contains_path(path)==1:
            res= 'cross'
            break
    return res

res = Parallel(n_jobs=2) (delayed(check_paths) (Path(points), a) for points in b) n_jobs=1 joblib if __name__ == '__main__':

@LINK:/questions/20580535/instagram-api-do-scopes-work-with-oauth2-implicit-authentication-flow
@TITLE:Instagram API: do scopes work with OAuth2 implicit authentication flow?
@CONTENT:I'm making requests against the Instagram API from a mobile app. Currently, I'm just directing the user to the Instagram auth url and specifying the response type to be "access_token". Specifying this response_type is known as implicit auth. Explicit auth: response_type=code Implicit auth: response_type=access_token I'm trying to get around needing to stand up a web service to facilitate explicit auth. This would be necessary because in explicit auth flow, the Instagram API needs to make a call to a redirect URL and pass in a "code" parameter. The code would then be used by my server-side code to make a final request to Instagram for an access token. It's much more efficient for a mobile app to use implicit flow because no extra privately-maintained auth service needs to be stood up to handle it. Instagram supports the following scopes: basic - to read any and all data related to a user (e.g. following/followed-by lists, photos, etc.) (granted by default) comments - to create or delete comments on a user・s behalf relationships - to follow and unfollow users on a user・s behalf likes - to like and unlike items on a user・s behalf When I make any other type of scope specification besides "basic", I get the following response when the user provides the credentials at the auth URL: {"code": 400, "error_type": "OAuthException", "error_message": "Invalid scope field(s): basic+likes"}
 Any combination of scopes other than "basic" gives the same response. So, my question are these: Is explicit auth required in order to specify scopes beyond "basic"?? Do I need to specify response_type=code in order for extended scopes to work? Is this an Instagram limitation, or is it a limitation of OAuth 2.0? Thanks in advance.

 It works. However, after I change the JSON file at kDataUrl, and verify that the change is made in a browser, when I run the app again, I still get the previous response. It seems that AFNetworking is somehow caching the old response. I do not want this behavior. I want to download the current feed. Is there some kind of setting or parameter I need to set to turn off caching?

@CONTENT:I have a situation where an app can be accessed from multiple different domains. For instance, foo.com and bar.com could both in theory point to my app. Additionally, their subdomains can also point to my app, so for instance red.foo.com and blue.foo.com. I'm using Express cookie sessions, and my initialization code for the session looks like that: app.use(express.session({

    cookie: {
        domain: ".foo.com"
    },
    store: new MongoStore({
        db: db

}));
 That works well for when users go through foo.com or any of it's subdomains, but bar.com won't work. I need to have both at once. Ideally, I would set it to a different domain per request, but I'm not sure how I would do that. My requests are highly asynchronous and if I just set it for the whole app at every request, I fear it might not work when two calls come in at once. Is this at all possible? Does anyone have any ideas to solve this?

 the thing is i want to create a unit test based on this data, but i dont want that the test will actually make the request. i want a predefined structure will return as the response. i am kind'a new to unit testing, and poked a little of OCMock but cant figure out how to manage this.

@LINK:/questions/19033974/how-do-you-overwrite-image-metadata
@TITLE:How do you overwrite image metadata?
@CONTENT:I can't seem to get image metadata to be written to the image correctly if the key/val is already present in the original image metadata with CGImageDestination. It works just fine if it they key/val is not present in the original metadata. It's almost as though image metadata properties in the original image take precedence over modifications. Is this some kind of byzantine formatting issue I am not aware of, where I need to populate the key/val in some unusual way, a bug, or? Anyone else seen this? Code and output below, for both cases where it works properly (if the value is not already set) and fails to write (if the value is already set to something else). Any help appreciated greatly appreciated. Here is where/how I create the image NSData: // convert the existing asset to nsdata to overwrite itself
ALAssetRepresentation* rep = [asset defaultRepresentation];
Byte* buffer               = (Byte*)malloc(rep.size);
NSUInteger buffered        = [rep getBytes:buffer fromOffset:0.0 length:rep.size error:nil];
NSData* imageData          = [NSData dataWithBytesNoCopy:buffer length:buffered freeWhenDone:YES];

// write the metadata directly into the nsdata of the image itself
NSData* newImage = [self writeMetadataIntoImageData:imageData metadata:newMetadata];
 Here is the actual modification of the metadata: - (NSData*)writeMetadataIntoImageData:(NSData*)imageData metadata:(NSMutableDictionary*)metadataAsMutable
{
    // create an imagesourceref
    CGImageSourceRef source = CGImageSourceCreateWithData((__bridge CFDataRef) imageData, NULL);

    // read and log pre write metadata
    NSDictionary* metadata = (NSDictionary *) CFBridgingRelease(CGImageSourceCopyPropertiesAtIndex(source,0,NULL));
    NSLog(@"Before:\n------------------------------%@\n------------------------------", metadata);

    // set the new metadata keys here
    NSMutableDictionary* iptc = [metadataAsMutable[(NSString*)kCGImagePropertyIPTCDictionary] mutableCopy];
    if (!iptc)
    {
        iptc = [NSMutableDictionary dictionaryWithCapacity:1];
    }
    iptc[(NSString*)kCGImagePropertyIPTCCaptionAbstract] = @"Hardcoded Caption";
    metadataAsMutable[(NSString*)kCGImagePropertyIPTCDictionary] = iptc;

    // log the new metadata as we want it written
    NSLog(@"Parameter:\n------------------------------%@\n------------------------------", metadataAsMutable);

    // this is the type of image (e.g., public.jpeg)
    CFStringRef UTI = CGImageSourceGetType(source);

    // create a new data object and write the new image into it
    NSMutableData *dest_data = [NSMutableData data];
    CGImageDestinationRef destination = CGImageDestinationCreateWithData((__bridge CFMutableDataRef)dest_data,UTI,1,NULL);
    if(!destination)
    {
        NSLog(@"Error: Could not create image destination");
    }
    // add the image contained in the image source to the destination, overidding the old metadata with our modified metadata
    CGImageDestinationAddImageFromSource(destination,source,0, (__bridge CFDictionaryRef) metadataAsMutable);

    BOOL success = NO;
    success = CGImageDestinationFinalize(destination);
    if(!success)
    {
        NSLog(@"Error: Could not create data from image destination");
    }

    // read and log post write metadata
    CGImageSourceRef  source2;
    source2 = CGImageSourceCreateWithData((__bridge CFDataRef) dest_data, NULL);
    NSDictionary *metadata2 = (NSDictionary *) CFBridgingRelease(CGImageSourceCopyPropertiesAtIndex(source2,0,NULL));
    NSLog(@"After:\n------------------------------%@\n------------------------------", metadata2);

    // cleanup
    CFRelease(destination);

    // return the new data
    return dest_data;

@TITLE:Overriding C library functions, calling original
@CONTENT:I am a bit puzzled on how and why this code works as it does. I have not actually encountered this in any project I've worked on, and I have not even thought of doing it myself. override_getline.c: #include <stdio.h>

#define OVERRIDE_GETLINE

#ifdef OVERRIDE_GETLINE
ssize_t getline(char **lineptr, size_t *n, FILE *stream)
{
    printf("getline &lineptr=%p &n=%p &stream=%p\n", lineptr, n, stream);
    return -1; // note: errno has undefined value
}
#endif
 main.c: #include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    char *buf = NULL;
    size_t len = 0;
    printf("Hello World! %zd\n", getline(&buf, &len, stdin));
    return 0;
}
 And finally, example compile and run command: gcc main.c override_getline.c && ./a.out
 With the OVERRIDE_GETLINE define, the custom function gets called, and if it is commented out, normal library function gets called, and both work as expected. Questions What is the correct term for this? "Overriding", "shadowing", something else? Is this gcc-specific, or POSIX, or ANSI C, or even undefined in all? Does it make any difference if function is ANSI C function or (like here) a POSIX function? Where does the overriding function get called? By other .o files in the same linking, at least, and I presume .a files added to link command too. How about static or dynamic libs added with -l command line option of linker? If it is possible, how do I call the library version of getline from the overriden getline?

@CONTENT:There are many solutions to this questions arround but couldn't find non-deprecated one. I have an UILabel with mode WordWrap and fixed width of, let's say 250. Lines are set to 0. Here is what I tried: UILabel *contentLabel = (UILabel*)[contentView viewWithTag:10];
CGSize size = [contentLabel.text sizeWithFont:contentLabel.font forWidth:contentLabel.frame.size.width lineBreakMode:NSLineBreakByWordWrapping];
NSLog(@"Label's height is: %d", size.height);
 The output of height param is always 20 (so it's like one line), while te text is like 30 lines long. I need that for UIScrollView purposes.

@CONTENT:I'm trying to write Connection string to Web.config like this: <connectionStrings>
  <add name="Dbconnection" connectionString="Server=localhost;

</connectionStrings >
 and read from it like this: string strcon =

SqlConnection DbConnection = new SqlConnection(strcon);
 when run the program I get an error because of the null reference. but when I use this code: SqlConnection DbConnection = new SqlConnection();

 I don't get any error and the program works correctly! What is the problem?

 In my html page I use this: @Scripts.Render("~/Scripts/vendor.js")
 This is preventing required libraries (like knockout) from loading. Could it be something in my web.comfig? Any tips would be awesome. UPDATE: I can reproduce the exact issue locally if I do the following: new ScriptBundle("~/Scripts/vvendor.js")  // change the virtual output directory here
 I think this means the view can't find the directory when it's published for some reason...

@TITLE:Existensial types in Scala
@CONTENT:Little confusing about existential types. This works for me: def valueOf(c: Class[_], name: String) {
  type C = Class[T] forSome {type T <: Enum[T]}
  Enum.valueOf(c.asInstanceOf[C], name)
} 
 but this does not: def valueOf(c: Class[_], name: String) {
  type T = T forSome {type T <: Enum[T]}
  Enum.valueOf(c.asInstanceOf[Class[T]], name)
}
 In my mind both expressions are equivalent to: Enum.valueOf(z.asInstanceOf[Class[T] forSome {type T <: Enum[T]}], name)
 But Scala says that it's in my mind only: inferred type arguments [T] do not conform to method valueOf's type parameter bounds [T <: Enum[T]]
         Enum.valueOf(c.asInstanceOf[Class[T]], name)
              ^

@LINK:/questions/18335162/xsrf-headers-not-being-set-in-angularjs
@TITLE:XSRF headers not being set in AngularJS
@CONTENT:I'm developing a DJANGO + AngularJS application, where the angular part is not being served by django. I set the angular $httpProvider as follows: myApp = angular.module('myApp', [])

myApp.config(['$httpProvider',
  function(provider){
    provider.defaults.xsrfCookieName = 'csrftoken';
    provider.defaults.xsrfHeaderName = 'X-CSRFToken';
}
 Then, before doing any POST, I do a GET which sets the cookie. I can confirm through Chrome that the cookie is set: set-cookie:csrftoken=hg88ZZFEdLPnwDdN1eiNquA8YzTySdQO; expires=Tue, 19-Aug-2014 12:26:35 GMT; Max-Age=31449600; Path=/
 (it's visible in resources/cookies/localhost in the Chrome developer tools) However when I do a POST, no X-CSRFToken header is being set this is the POST as recorded by Chrome: POST /data/activities/search HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:14080
Connection: keep-alive

 Why is no header being set? What else should I do to activate this functionality? (side note: if I manually pass the header in the $http() call, the POST request works fine.. therefore the problem is really the header not being set by AngularJS)
@CODE:$httpProvider myApp = angular.module('myApp', [])

@TITLE:Git tracking entire home directory. Get error - fatal: bad default revision 'HEAD'
@CONTENT:I'm completely new to git. I'm working in Mac Terminal. Whenever I do a git status in my home directory, all untracked files, files in the stage directory, and committed files in my entire home directory appear. When I do a git log in my home directory, I get the following error: fatal: bad default revision 'HEAD' How do I go about correcting this error? How do I get git to stop tracking the contents of my entire home directory without affecting it in its current state? Thanks in advance, and I apologize for my ignorance. I just do not want to do anything that could be potentially damaging to my home directory. When I enter git status in the main directory, I get the following: ~ (master) > Kojo$ git status

I now need to obtain the offset C, given the distance required, for use within a quadratic curve. This is where my, very, limited knowledge and understanding of maths formulae comes in.

 , jQuery will send the request as someurl?key1=value1&key2=value4&key3=value5
 all this because Javascript overwrites properties that have the same name. The JSON object is generated dynamically and I am NOT ALLOWED to use arrays in it. Can someone tell me how could I generate the JSON object dinamicaly and with duplicate keys? I would realy appreciate any help from you!

@LINK:/questions/17017882/scikit-learn-predict-proba-gives-wrong-answers
@TITLE:Scikit-learn predict_proba gives wrong answers
@CONTENT:This is a follow-up question from How to know what classes are represented in return array from predict_proba in Scikit-learn In that question, I quoted the following code: >>> import sklearn
>>> sklearn.__version__
'0.13.1'
>>> from sklearn import svm
>>> model = svm.SVC(probability=True)
>>> X = [[1,2,3], [2,3,4]] # feature vectors
>>> Y = ['apple', 'orange'] # classes
>>> model.fit(X, Y)
>>> model.predict_proba([1,2,3])
array([[ 0.39097541,  0.60902459]])
 I discovered in that question this result represents the probability of the point belonging to each class, in the order given by model.classes_ >>> zip(model.classes_, model.predict_proba([1,2,3])[0])
[('apple', 0.39097541289393828), ('orange', 0.60902458710606167)]
 So... this answer, if interpreted correctly, says that the point is probably an 'orange' (with a fairly low confidence, due to the tiny amount of data). But intuitively, this result is obviously incorrect, since the point given was identical to the training data for 'apple'. Just to be sure, I tested the reverse as well: >>> zip(model.classes_, model.predict_proba([2,3,4])[0])
[('apple', 0.60705475211840931), ('orange', 0.39294524788159074)]
 Again, obviously incorrect, but in the other direction. Finally, I tried it with points that were much further away. >>> X = [[1,1,1], [20,20,20]] # feature vectors
>>> model.fit(X, Y)
>>> zip(model.classes_, model.predict_proba([1,1,1])[0])
[('apple', 0.33333332048410247), ('orange', 0.66666667951589786)]
 Again, the model predicts the wrong probabilities. BUT, the model.predict function gets it right! >>> model.predict([1,1,1])[0]
'apple'
 Now, I remember reading something in the docs about predict_proba being inaccurate for small datasets, though I can't seem to find it again. Is this the expected behaviour, or am I doing something wrong? If this IS the expected behaviour, then why does the predict and predict_proba function disagree one the output? And importantly, how big does the dataset need to be before I can trust the results from predict_proba? -------- UPDATE -------- Ok, so I did some more 'experiments' into this: the behaviour of predict_proba is heavily dependent on 'n', but not in any predictable way! >>> def train_test(n):
...     X = [[1,2,3], [2,3,4]] * n
...     Y = ['apple', 'orange'] * n
...     model.fit(X, Y)
...     print "n =", n, zip(model.classes_, model.predict_proba([1,2,3])[0])
... 
>>> train_test(1)
n = 1 [('apple', 0.39097541289393828), ('orange', 0.60902458710606167)]
>>> for n in range(1,10):
...     train_test(n)
... 
n = 1 [('apple', 0.39097541289393828), ('orange', 0.60902458710606167)]
n = 2 [('apple', 0.98437355278112448), ('orange', 0.015626447218875527)]
n = 3 [('apple', 0.90235408180319321), ('orange', 0.097645918196806694)]
n = 4 [('apple', 0.83333299908143665), ('orange', 0.16666700091856332)]
n = 5 [('apple', 0.85714254878984497), ('orange', 0.14285745121015511)]
n = 6 [('apple', 0.87499969631893626), ('orange', 0.1250003036810636)]
n = 7 [('apple', 0.88888844127886335), ('orange', 0.11111155872113669)]
n = 8 [('apple', 0.89999988018127364), ('orange', 0.10000011981872642)]
n = 9 [('apple', 0.90909082368682159), ('orange', 0.090909176313178491)]
 How should I use this function safely in my code? At the very least, is there any value of n for which it will be guaranteed to agree with the result of model.predict?

 Say I want the min across of all the Vi columns row by row, I used to use apply when I was using data.frame. apply(DT[,paste0('V',1:10),with=FALSE],FUN=min,MAR=1)
 [1] -0.6264538107 -0.7099464309 -0.8356286124 -2.2146998872 -1.3770595568 -0.8204683841 -1.8049586289 -1.4707523839 -1.2246126149 -0.5895209462
 So I can update easily. Ok, now say that I want to update the min and max at once (off course this is an example so I took just 2 things but in real life that would be 10...)  f = function(x){return(c(max=max(x),min=min(x)))}
 new=apply(DT[,paste0('V',1:10),with=FALSE],FUN=f,MAR=1)
             [,1]          [,2]          [,3]         [,4]         [,5]          [,6]         [,7]         [,8]         [,9]         [,10]

 I would like to write DT[,rownames(new):=new]
 but this does not work, so here are my questions Using my method, how can I transform new such that I can update DT at once ? Are there some better approach (that would allow me to update multiple columns at once, with the result of a by-row calculation) EDIT: I found a solution for 1 but that's UGLY, actually It is strange that := do not handle matrix, I am pretty sure it used to be the case DT[,c('a1','a2'):=data.table(matrix(apply(DT[,paste0('V',1:10),with=FALSE],FUN=f,MAR=1),byrow=T,nrow=10))]

@TITLE:JavaFX custom control (TextField) not working
@CONTENT:I am trying to make a custom control with JavaFX and SceneBuilder 1.1. I have this code: FXML <?import libreria.javaFX.componentes.componenteTextField.*?>

<AnchorPane id="AnchorPane" maxHeight="-Infinity" maxWidth="-Infinity" minHeight="-Infinity" minWidth="-Infinity" prefHeight="400.0" prefWidth="600.0" xmlns:fx="http://javafx.com/fxml">
  <children>
    <CustomComponent fx:id="pastaTxt" layoutX="69.0" layoutY="87.0" prefWidth="200.0" />
  </children>
</AnchorPane>
 CustomComponent.java package libreria.javaFX.componentes.componenteTextField;

import javafx.scene.control.TextField;

public class CustomComponent extends TextField {

public CustomComponent() {
    super();
    // TODO Auto-generated constructor stub
}

public CustomComponent(String arg0) {
    super(arg0);
    // TODO Auto-generated constructor stub
}
 } When I try to open it from SceneBuilder it tells me this: Missing types are: [CustomComponent] and it gives me the chance to specify the Classpath (which doesn't fix the problem either). I tried putting the class at the import statement too, like this: <?import libreria.javaFX.componentes.componenteTextField.CustomComponent?>
 But it gives a ClassNotFoundException. Any ideas about why is this happening? MORE INFORMATION I have done a new project with just these classes: And the code is as follows: CustomControl.fxml <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<?import custom.CustomControl?>
<?import java.lang.*?>
<?import java.util.*?>
<?import javafx.scene.control.*?>
<?import javafx.scene.layout.*?>
<?import javafx.scene.paint.*?>
<?scenebuilder-classpath-element ../../bin/custom?>

<AnchorPane id="AnchorPane" maxHeight="-Infinity" maxWidth="-Infinity" minHeight="-Infinity" minWidth="-Infinity" prefHeight="400.0" prefWidth="600.0" xmlns:fx="http://javafx.com/fxml">
  <children>
    <CustomControl layoutX="51.0" layoutY="100.0" prefWidth="200.0" />
  </children>

 CustomControl.java package custom;

import javafx.scene.control.TextField;

public class CustomControl extends TextField {

    public CustomControl() {
        super();
    }

public CustomControl(String arg0) {
    super(arg0);

    }
}
 And I still have the same problem. I specify the classpath with the dialog, everything seems right to me but I have the same errors opening the SceneBuilder. LAST INFORMATION Trying to approach to the solution, we tried this project under Eclipse. The result is that Eclipse shows the window ok but SceneBuilder continues with those errors. I hope this clue helps. If anyone has done this kind of custom control definition under Scene Builder, please, tell us and give us an example, it will be extremely helpful for our project.

@TITLE:Use formula in custom calculated field in Pivot Table
@CONTENT:In Excel Pivot table report there is possibility for user intervention by inserting "Calculated Field" so that user can further manipulate the report. This seems like best approach compared to using formula on Pivot table data, outside the Pivot table, for many obvious reasons. "Calculated Field" dialog, looks like this: and while it's easy to do calculation between available variables (as shown in screenshot) I can't find how to reference range of values for any of available variables. For example, if for some reason I want to center the data in range A1:A100 I'd use = A1 - AVERAGE(A1:A100) and fill all rows in regular Excel table. But for Pivot table, if I use "Calculated Field" dialog and add new variable with formula: = 'Actual Sales' - AVERAGE('Actual Sales') I get 0 as output. So my question is how can I reference whole range for 'Actual Sales' variable in "Calculated Field" dialog, so that AVERAGE() will return the average of all targeted cells ?
@CODE:A1:A100 = A1 - AVERAGE(A1:A100) = 'Actual Sales' - AVERAGE('Actual Sales') 0 AVERAGE()

@TITLE:Oauth2 Instagram API ：redirect URI does not match registered redirect URI；
@CONTENT:I am working on a Rails application which is in development mode and it can register with omniauth. The host is http://localhost:3000/
 I'm using the gems: gem 'omniauth'
gem 'omniauth-foursquare'
gem 'omniauth-instagram'
 When I register through omniauth with Foursquare there's no problem at all. All the settings are right and my redirect_uri in the Foursquare developer settings equals to the host (localhost:3000) However, if I fill in the exact same redirect_uri (localhost:3000) in the Instagram client manager*. Instagram gives me this: {
 "code": 400,
 "error_type": "OAuthException",
 "error_message": "Redirect URI does not match registered             redirect URI"

@TITLE:jquery.extend(true, [], obj) not creating a deep copy
@CONTENT:jsFiddle here. If deep copying worked, the output would be "Curious George" and not "Ender's Game". How can I make a deep copy? An answer to this question indicates that $.extend(true, [], obj) creates a deep copy. Yet my example shows that it doesn't. function Person(){}
Person.prototype.favorite_books = [];

var george = new Person();
george.favorite_books = ["Curious George"];

var kate = new Person();
kate.favorite_books = ["The Da Vinci Code", "Harry Potter"];

var people = [kate, george];

var people_copy = $.extend(true, [], people);
people_copy[0].favorite_books[0] = "Ender's Game";

$('#text').text(people[0].favorite_books[0]);
 SOLUTION I updated the jsFiddle. It turns out I need to deep copy each object in the array individually if the object is a custom object (that is, $.isPlainObject returns false).
@CODE:$.extend(true, [], obj) function Person(){}
Person.prototype.favorite_books = [];

var george = new Person();
george.favorite_books = ["Curious George"];

var kate = new Person();
kate.favorite_books = ["The Da Vinci Code", "Harry Potter"];

var people = [kate, george];

var people_copy = $.extend(true, [], people);
people_copy[0].favorite_books[0] = "Ender's Game";

@CONTENT:With jquery there seem to be two ways of finding a list item within an unordered list within the DOM. $("ul>li");
 and $("ul").find("li"); 
 Is there a reason why the latter might be more preferable? It seems like one would need more code to get the same result.

@TITLE:How can I create a canvas imageData array from an arrayBuffer representation of a JPG
@CONTENT:First of all I am aware there are standard methods of achieving this (readAsDataURL and drawImage), but unfortunately they are not usable for this specific use case. I am reading an image using the filereader API as an arraybuffer like so:     var reader = new fileReader();
    reader.onload = function(e){

          var byteArray = new Uint8ClampedArray(e.target.result);
          //do stuff to this array
    }
    reader.readAsArrayBuffer(file);
 I am then creating a clampedarray with this returned data. What I want to be able to do is now draw this pixel array directly to a canvas using putImageData Currently I am doing the following: var byteArray = new Uint8ClampedArray(e.target.result);
var imgdata = ctx.createImageData(img.width, img.height);
var canvdata = imgdata.data;

for (var i = 0; i < canvdata.length; i += 4) {
    canvdata[i] = byteArray[i];
    canvdata[i + 1] = byteArray[i + 1];
    canvdata[i + 2] = byteArray[i + 2];
    canvdata[i + 3] = byteArray[i + 3];
}
ctx.putImageData(imgdata, 0, 0);
 Using this method, although the data gets drawn to the canvas, it appears like garbled snow or noise and is not a correct representation of the image. This leads me to believe that I am constructing the imagedata data incorrectly in my loop or perhaps my initial method of getting the pixel array is incorrect. To summarize, I would like to be able to take an arraybuffer (of a jpeg) retrieved via the html5 fileReader API and then create a canvas compatible imageData array, so that it can later be pushed into a canvas using putImageData Thanks in advance.
@CODE:var reader = new fileReader();
    reader.onload = function(e){

          var byteArray = new Uint8ClampedArray(e.target.result);
          //do stuff to this array
    }
    reader.readAsArrayBuffer(file); putImageData var byteArray = new Uint8ClampedArray(e.target.result);
var imgdata = ctx.createImageData(img.width, img.height);
var canvdata = imgdata.data;

for (var i = 0; i < canvdata.length; i += 4) {
    canvdata[i] = byteArray[i];
    canvdata[i + 1] = byteArray[i + 1];
    canvdata[i + 2] = byteArray[i + 2];
    canvdata[i + 3] = byteArray[i + 3];
}

That is, the figures can well have different sizes to accomodate the axis descriptions, but the plotting area (the rectangle within which the curves are drawn) should always have the same size. Is there a simple way to achieve that? The option figsize of pyplot.figure() seems to set the overall size of the figure, not that of the canvas, so I get a different canvas size whenever the axis description occupies more or less space.

 I also edited my view and use the FormLabel view helper: <dt><label><?php echo $this->formLabel($form->get('city')); ?></label></dt>
 Furthermore I debugged the FormLabel at the place, where the tranlator is used (lines 116-120) -- seems to be OK. But it's still not working. EDIT The (test) items for labels, I added to the de_DE.po file manually, are tranlated. The ZF2 side problem was actually, that I was using $form->get('city')->getLabel() instead of $this->formlabel($form->get('city')) in th view script. The problem is now, that the labels are not added to the de_DE.po file. But it's not a ZF2 issue anymore, so I've accept Ruben's answer and open a new Poedit question.

    public static void main(String args[]) {
        long bigDTime, littleDTime;

        {
            long start = System.nanoTime();

            for (Double i = 0.0; i < 1432143.341; i += 0.1) {
                d += i;
            }
            long end = System.nanoTime();
            bigDTime = end - start;
            System.out.println(bigDTime);
        }

        {

        }

        System.out.println("D/d = " + (bigDTime / littleDTime));

 http://ideone.com/fDizDu So why is the Double type so much slower? Why is it even implemented to allow mathematical operators?

@TITLE:How do I specify a config file with sbt 0.12.2 for sbt test?
@CONTENT:I have a Play! project with unit tests and I am trying to run tests on my staging environment using sbt. Before I upgraded to Play 2.1, when I was using Play 2.0.4 and sbt 0.11.3 I could do $ sbt -Dconfig.file=conf/staging.conf test. Now sbt test seems to use the default application.conf no matter what I specify for -Dconfig.file. sbt start -Dconfig.file=conf/staging.conf still works fine. Is this behavior a bug with sbt 0.12.2 or should I be specifying a config file for running tests in a different way?

 One other problem I face, is that when i try to import com.google.android.gms.maps.MapFragment; it gives an error that it doesnt recognise a package name to be com.google.android.gms so i cant even use the GoogleMapor MapFragment for example. So does anyone have any solution to those 2 problems?

@LINK:/questions/14882003/generic-screws-up-non-related-collection
@TITLE:Generic screws up non-related collection
@CONTENT:Why do collections that are not related to the template class drop their type? Here is an example: (Sorry, it will not compile because of the error I'm confused about.) package test;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class TemplateTest {

    public static class A { }

    public static class B<T extends Comparable> {
        List<A> aList = new ArrayList<A>();

        public List<A> getAList() {
            return aList;
        }

        public int compare(T t, T t1) {
            return t.compareTo(t1);
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        B b = new B();
        for (A a : b.getAList()) { //THIS DOES NOT WORK

        }
        List<A> aList = b.getAList(); //THIS WORKS
        for (A a : aList) {

        }
    }
}
 This code throws an error upon compilation: test/TemplateTest.java:24: incompatible types
    found   : java.lang.Object
    required: test.TemplateTest.A
        for (A a : b.getAList()) {
 If I specify the template of B like B<String>, or if I remove the template from B completely, then everything is ok. What's going on? EDIT: people pointed out there was no need to make B generic so I added to B
@CODE:package test;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class TemplateTest {

    public static class A { }

    public static class B<T extends Comparable> {

@TITLE:Calculating difference row values by group in R
@CONTENT:This is a my df (data.frame):     group value
[1]    1     10
[2]    1     20
[3]    1     25
[4]    2     5
[5]    2     10

    ...
 I need to calculate difference row value by group. So, I need a that result.     group value diff
[1] 1     10    NA (becasue there is a no previous value)
[2] 1     20    10 (value[2]-value[1])
[3] 1     25    5  (vlaue[3]-value[2])
[4] 2     5     NA (because group is changed)
[5] 2     10    5  (value[5]-value[4])
[6] 2     15    5  (value[6]-value[5])
    ...
 Although, I can handle this problem by using ddply, but it takes too much time. This is because I have a lot of groups in my df. (over 1,000,000 groups in my df) Are there any other effective approaches to handle this problem? Thanks.

@TITLE:Merging historical and live stock price data with Rx
@CONTENT:I'm trying out Rx because it seems like a good fit for our domain but the learning curve has taken me by surprise. I need to knit together historical price data with live price data. I'm trying to adapt the usual approach to doing this into the language of Rx: Subscribe to the live prices immediately and start buffering the values I get back Initiate a request for historical price data (this needs to happen after the subscription to live prices so we don't have any gaps in our data) Publish historical prices as they come back Once we've received all historical data, publish the buffered live data, removing any values that overlap with our historical data at the beginning Continue replaying data from the live price feed I have this disgusting and incorrect straw man code which seems to work for the naive test cases I've written: IConnectableObservable<Tick> live = liveService
    .For(symbol)
    .Replay(/* Some appropriate buffer size */);
live.Connect();

IObservable<Tick> historical = historyService.For(since, symbol);

return new[] {historical, live}
    .Concat()
    .Where(TicksAreInChronologicalOrder());

private static Func1<Tick,bool> TicksAreInChronologicalOrder()
{
    // Some stateful predicate comparing the timestamp of this tick 
    // to the timestamp of the last tick we saw
}
 This has a few drawbacks The appropriate replay buffer size is not known. Setting an unlimited buffer isn't possible- this is a long-running sequence. Really we want some kind of one-time buffer that flushes on the first call to Subscribe. If this exists in Rx, I can't find it. The replay buffer will continue to exist even once we've switched to publishing live prices. We don't need the buffer at this point. Similarly, the predicate to filter out overlapping ticks isn't necessary once we've skipped the initial overlap between historical and live prices. I really want to do something like: live.SkipWhile(tick => tick.Timestamp < /* lazily get last timestamp in historical data */). Is Wait(this IObservable<TSource>) useful here? There must be a better way to do this, but I'm still waiting for my brain to grok Rx like it does FP. Another option I've considered to solve 1. is writing my own Rx extension which would be an ISubject that queues messages until it gets its first subscriber (and refuses subscribers after that?). Maybe that's the way to go?
@CODE:IConnectableObservable<Tick> live = liveService
    .For(symbol)
    .Replay(/* Some appropriate buffer size */);
live.Connect();

IObservable<Tick> historical = historyService.For(since, symbol);

return new[] {historical, live}
    .Concat()
    .Where(TicksAreInChronologicalOrder());

private static Func1<Tick,bool> TicksAreInChronologicalOrder()
{
    // Some stateful predicate comparing the timestamp of this tick 
    // to the timestamp of the last tick we saw
} live.SkipWhile(tick => tick.Timestamp < /* lazily get last timestamp in historical data */) Wait(this IObservable<TSource>) ISubject Switch() historical.Switch(live)

 I have no clue why the application won't initialize and I would appreciate any pointers.

@TITLE:How to override all standard error pages in WebAPI
@CONTENT:My beautiful REST webservice works great. Except if I visit pages like ~/, which returns the default IIS 403 Forbidden page (even using Fiddler and specifying only Accept: application/json). I want nothing but JSON or XML errors. Is there a way to override ALL exceptions with a custom exception handler? or a default controller to handle all unknown requests? What's the simplest, and the most correct (if different), way to handle this so that clients need only parse REST API-friendly XML datagrams or JSON blobs? Example Request: GET http://localhost:7414/ HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Fiddler

@TITLE:javascript FileReader - parsing long file in chunks
@CONTENT:I have long file I need to parse. Because it's very long I need to do it chunk by chunk. I tried this: function parseFile(file){
    var chunkSize = 2000;
    var fileSize = (file.size - 1);

    var foo = function(e){
        console.log(e.target.result);
    };

    for(var i =0; i < fileSize; i += chunkSize)
    {
        (function( fil, start ) {
            var reader = new FileReader();
            var blob = fil.slice(start, chunkSize + 1);
            reader.onload = foo;
            reader.readAsText(blob);
        })( file, i );
    }
}
 After running it I see only the first chunk in the console. If I change 'console.log' to jquery append to some div I see only first chunk in that div. What about other chunks? How to make it work?
@CODE:function parseFile(file){
    var chunkSize = 2000;

@TITLE:onOffsetsChanged not called by Touchwiz
@CONTENT:Note: since it is a question specific to Samsung, I also asked it on their developer board. I am currently implementing a Live Wallpaper in Android and I'm listening to the onOffsetsChanged() method in my wallpaper engine to change the wallpaper when the user swipes through his homescreens. This works great on my private Galaxy Tab with a CM9 custom rom. On my company device, a stock Galaxy S3, it does not work. Somehow Touchwiz doesn't call onOffsetsChanged when the homescreen is changed. Googling for the topic didn't yield any significant results besides the description of this app, where the dev states: "Fixed scrolling on latest TouchWiz launcher where onOffsetsChanged() doesn't get called." Now I would just contact the dev, but unfortunately it is also a Samsung app. Does anyone know a workaround to get the current offsets without relying on onOffsetsChanged? Has anyone run into this problem in their own wallpaper? Does anyone know if this is intentional or if I can assume that future Touchwiz versions will make use of the method again?

 So I guess that the dialect that I created is not used at all or is wrong but I don't know why. I think that the @Type annotation should do the mapping but I have seen some tags but I do not know if they are needed in this example and if they are, where do I had them? It's been two days that I am stuck with this problem and I am getting desperate. Could you help me debug this program? Please. Thank you very much in advance. Edit 0: The persistence.xml file seem to find the correct dialect but the function getTypeName(2003) throws the errors above after doing registerHibernateType(Types.ARRAY, "array"). BTW, I am using Hibernate 3.6.4.Final and postgresql 8.4-702.jdbc3. Edit 1: I added the following line to PostgreSQLDialectArray constructor: registerColumnType(Types.ARRAY, "integer[$l]" ); 
 which seems to partially solve the problem. However, now I get another error: 2013-01-09 11:14:30,281 [main] ERROR org.hibernate.tool.hbm2ddl.SchemaExport - Unsuccessful: create table blabla (id int8 not null, array int[255], name varchar(255), test int4 not null, version int4, primary key (id))

  Position: 40
 Apparently, hibernate still does not know how to create a table with an array in it... Edit 2: It seems that postgresql didn't like the fact that my column was called "array". I change that and it worked. The table is created by hibernate with an array of integer. BUT I cannot save any array in it with hibernate because of a problem in the UserType implementation. Apparently, the creation of the array fails with createArrayOf. I am reading some threads on this matter telling to access the underlying connection instead of the wrapper. I think I am going to open a new thread linking to this one because this problem is quite different. The stacktrace: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.AbstractMethodError: org.apache.commons.dbcp.PoolingDataSource$PoolGuardConnectionWrapper.createArrayOf(Ljava/lang/String;[Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/sql/Array;

 Edit 3: Finally, after the following modifications, the UserType for integer arrays works: Add this line in applicationContext.xml in: <bean class="org.apache.commons.dbcp.BasicDataSource" destroy-method="close" id="dataSource"> .... <property name="accessToUnderlyingConnectionAllowed" value="true" /> </bean> Modify the nullSafeSet from IntArrayUserType     @Override
    public void nullSafeSet(final PreparedStatement statement, final Object object, final int i) throws HibernateException, SQLException {
        Connection connection = statement.getConnection();
        int[] castObject = (int[]) object;
        Integer[] integers = toObject(castObject);
        Connection conn = ((DelegatingConnection) connection).getInnermostDelegate();
        Array array = conn.createArrayOf("integer", integers);
        statement.setArray(i, array);
    }
 BUT there is still a problem when getting all the entries from the table blabla: The function findAllBlablas does not work properly and only returns the first entry... Edit 4: In fact, it worked great but the eclipse console was not able to print all data. That's all!

    <div class="controls">
      <%= f.collection_check_boxes 
                 :role_ids, Role.all, :id, :name %>
    </div>
  </div>
 The part I am most getting hung up on is the fact that the f.collection_check_boxes generates code like this. <span>
  <input blah blah />
  <label class="collection_check_boxes" blah>blah</label>
</span>
 Which makes it hard for me to get a css class in there as there are 3 components that have to be touched. I've tried adding things such as dummy classes to the :html hash, but the dummy class doesn't even show up in the rendered html. Any help is greatly appreciated EDIT: Solution Thanks to Baldrick, my working erb looks like this. <%= f.collection_check_boxes :role_ids, Role.all, :id, :name,
      {:item_wrapper_class => 'checkbox_container'} %>
 And my CSS is as follows .checkbox_container {
  display: inline-block;
  vertical-align: -1px;
  margin: 5px;
 }
.checkbox_container input {
  display: inline;
 }
.checkbox_container .collection_check_boxes{
  display: inline;
  vertical-align: -5px;
 }
@CODE:<div class="control-group">
    <%= f.label 'Roles' %>

@TITLE:UITapGestureRecognizer Programmatically trigger a tap in my view
@CONTENT:Edit: Updated to make question more obvious Edit 2: Made question more accurate to my real-world problem. I'm actually looking to take action if they tap anywhere EXCEPT in an on-screen text-field. Thus, I can't simply listen for events within the textfield, I need to know if they tapped anywhere in the View. I'm writing unit tests to assert that a certain action is taken when a gesture recognizer recognizes a tap within certain coordinates of my view. I want to know if I can programmatically create a touch (at specific coordinates) that will be handled by the UITapGestureRecognizer. I'm attempting to simulate the user interaction during a unit test. The UITapGestureRecognizer is configured in Interface Builder //MYUIViewControllerSubclass.m

-(IBAction)viewTapped:(UITapGestureRecognizer*)gesture {
  CGPoint tapPoint = [gesture locationInView:self.view];
  if (!CGRectContainsPoint(self.textField, tapPoint)) {
    // Do stuff if they tapped anywhere outside the text field
  }
}

@TITLE:Draw equidistant points on a spiral
@CONTENT:I need an algorithm to calculate the distribution of points on a spiral path. The input parameters of this algorithm should be: Width of the loop (distance from the innermost loop) Fixed distance between the points The number of points to draw The spiral to draw is an archimedean spiral and the points obtained must be equidistant from each other. The algorithm should print out the sequence of the Cartesian coordinates of single points, for example: Point 1: (0.0) Point 2: (..., ...) ........ Point N (..., ...) The programming language isn't important and all help greatly appreciated! EDIT: I already get and modify this example from this site:     //
//
// centerX-- X origin of the spiral.
// centerY-- Y origin of the spiral.
// radius--- Distance from origin to outer arm.
// sides---- Number of points or sides along the spiral's arm.
// coils---- Number of coils or full rotations. (Positive numbers spin clockwise, negative numbers spin counter-clockwise)
// rotation- Overall rotation of the spiral. ('0'=no rotation, '1'=360 degrees, '180/360'=180 degrees)
//
void SetBlockDisposition(float centerX, float centerY, float radius, float sides, float coils, float rotation)
{
    //
    // How far to step away from center for each side.
    var awayStep = radius/sides;
    //
    // How far to rotate around center for each side.
    var aroundStep = coils/sides;// 0 to 1 based.
    //
    // Convert aroundStep to radians.
    var aroundRadians = aroundStep * 2 * Mathf.PI;
    //
    // Convert rotation to radians.
    rotation *= 2 * Mathf.PI;
    //
    // For every side, step around and away from center.
    for(var i=1; i<=sides; i++){

        //
        // How far away from center
        var away = i * awayStep;
        //
        // How far around the center.
        var around = i * aroundRadians + rotation;
        //
        // Convert 'around' and 'away' to X and Y.
        var x = centerX + Mathf.Cos(around) * away;
        var y = centerY + Mathf.Sin(around) * away;
        //
        // Now that you know it, do it.

        DoSome(x,y);
    }
}
 But the disposition of point is wrong, the points aren't equidistant from each other. The correct distribution example is is the image on the left:
@CODE://
//
// centerX-- X origin of the spiral.
// centerY-- Y origin of the spiral.
// radius--- Distance from origin to outer arm.
// sides---- Number of points or sides along the spiral's arm.
// coils---- Number of coils or full rotations. (Positive numbers spin clockwise, negative numbers spin counter-clockwise)
// rotation- Overall rotation of the spiral. ('0'=no rotation, '1'=360 degrees, '180/360'=180 degrees)

void SetBlockDisposition(float centerX, float centerY, float radius, float sides, float coils, float rotation)
{
    //
    // How far to step away from center for each side.
    var awayStep = radius/sides;
    //
    // How far to rotate around center for each side.
    var aroundStep = coils/sides;// 0 to 1 based.
    //

    var aroundRadians = aroundStep * 2 * Mathf.PI;
    //
    // Convert rotation to radians.
    rotation *= 2 * Mathf.PI;
    //
    // For every side, step around and away from center.
    for(var i=1; i<=sides; i++){

        //
        // How far away from center
        var away = i * awayStep;
        //
        // How far around the center.

@TITLE:Force Landscape Orientation on iOS 6 in Objective-C
@CONTENT:I have a master view controller that's inside a UINavigationController. In that master view controller, I have a button that pushes a detail view controller that has a UIWebView inside of it. I want this detail view controller to be on landscape mode when it's loaded. Going back to the master view controller, it forcibly goes back again to portrait mode. I'm running iOS 6 on this. I have seen the other similar questions but it's not working on my end. I have created a LandscapeViewController that's a subclass of UIViewController where I have written these methods: #pragma mark - Orientation Methods
- (NSUInteger)supportedInterfaceOrientations
{
    return UIInterfaceOrientationMaskLandscape;
}

- (BOOL)shouldAutorotate
{
    return YES;
}
 This is my code when I push the detail view controller: DetailViewController *detailVC = [[DetailViewController alloc]
                                      initWithNibName:@"DetailViewController"
                                      bundle:nil];

    [self.navigationController pushViewController:detailVC
                                         animated:YES];
 I'm thinking on where to subclass my LandscapeViewController on the code above to make it work or on how to properly subclass and push my detail view controller. I can also present my detail view controller modally if it's not possible for the navigation controller to push my detail view controller from portrait to landscape. Where am I doing it wrong?

@TITLE:How can I schedule local notification for the following scenario?
@CONTENT:Experts, I have a scenario wherein I need to notify user three times a day (morning, afternoon, evening). And the timings for these notifications will be different for each day, based on database values for each date. These three notifications are configurable. Meaning user might just choose to set afternoon and evening while turning off morning notification under settings. As per my understanding I can achieve this using local notifications. I can do the following: - before the application exits, inside didFinishLaunchingWithOptions, I can check what is the next notification due, is it set (on/off). If it is set I schedule it. If not I move on to the next notification type and do the same thing. If all the notifications are turned off, obviously, no notifications will be scheduled. Now when the notification shows up i get to see alert with two buttons "Close" and "View". If user selects "View" My app is back to active and before user exits next notification is scheduled. So far so good. Now if user choose to select "Close" What do I do? It wont launch my app and consequently next notification wont be scheduled? How do I achieve this? Is there any better way to do this? Help! Help! Help!

using Type2 = std::function<void(T)>;

Type1 whyDoesThisWork;
Type2<void> andYetThisDoesNot;
 If the second type alias, I get the error "Argument may not have 'void' type". (I tested with Xcode 4.5, Clang/c++11/libc++, OS X 10.7.) I find this curious: I would have expected Type1 and Type2<void> to behave identically. What's going on here? And is there a way to rewrite the second type alias so I can write Type2<void> and get std::function<void(void)> instead of an error? Edit I should probably add that the reason I want this is to allow for something like the following: template <typename ... T>
using Continuation = std::function<void(T...)>;

auto someFunc = []() -> void {
  printf("I'm returning void!\n");
};

Continuation<decltype(someFunc())> c;
 Continuation<decltype(someFunc())> becomes Continuation<void> and I get the error.

@CONTENT:I am able to send a mail using javax.mail API. But the problem here is on an average for each mail it taking around 4.3 seconds to send to destination. If I am sending a 20 mails sequentially, it taking around 86.599 seconds. For my requirement this approach will not work. I am lookging for an approach which can send large number of mails in less time. When I looked at the debug log, this API is trying to authenticate to SMTP server for each and every message it sending. But I am creating session only one time and using the same session for all the mails I am sending. Now my question is Isn't it a overhead process every time authenticating itself to the smtp server. Isn't a better approach there? Below is the log trace you may find helpful. 250-AUTH LOGIN PLAIN XOAUTH XOAUTH2

@TITLE:Export data from SAP to SQL Server
@CONTENT:I have an application which uses SQL Server 2008 to store data that needs to feed a bunch of financial information from SAP (which in this company uses Oracle 11 as back end). I asked the SAP guys for access to read the tables, they said no way. I asked them to connect to my database directly to fill my tables, they said no way. (I have a feed from an Oracle database, other application different than SAP, using the transparent gateway with no problem, so that's why asked this) They say the only way to interact with SAP is through the use of Web services. But due the enormous amount of data, I don't think that's the path. Does anybody has experience in creating an interface between SAP and a SQL Server? I'm going to extend my explanation. My current application is already being fed by three other applications (this is a big enterprise) that all go to the same tables where I receive the data to further process. All the other applications (1 Oracle, 2 SQL Server) perform either a direct update or stored procedures that save the data. Those other 3 applications are managed by different teams with no relation to each other. All of them complained at the beginning but at the end all accepted to export their data to this application. So, the ideal would be to convince the SAP guys to do the same: Open a connection to SQL Server and perform some inserts or run stored procedures.

@TITLE:ICommand binding causing UI memory leak in WPF application
@CONTENT:I'm building a WPF app that connects to a SQL Server database using LINQ to SQL. The main window of the app contains a ListView containing a series of detail views. The ItemSource of the ListView is bound to a collection of detail view model objects exposed as a property on the root view model. Each detail view model object composes several ICommand properties as well as a property exposing a detail model object, which in turn exposes the various data fields shown in the UI. Analysis with the ANTS memory profiler shows that the objects being leaked are those contained in the detail model object, and some UI classes to which they are bound. Instances of these objects from previous refreshes are not being garbage collected. ANTS has a tool that allows the user to trace chains of reference to identify why unwanted memory is being retained. When I use it, I find that all of the chains that show up have an ICommand in them. Accordingly, I've removed the offending ICommand, and found that the memory leak disappears. Unfortunately, I need the ICommand to implement some important functionality. What is really confusing me is how it has a reference to the detail model object in the first place- they are two completely separate instance variables in the detail view model object. Here is the constructor of the detail view model object (The reference to the RootViewModel is used for callbacks in some of the methods connected to the ICommands. I originally suspected that this might be causing a circular chain of references that might be the cause of the problem, but removing it doesn't seem to have any effect.) public CarDataViewModel(CarData carDataItem, RootViewModel parentViewModel)
    {

        _parentViewModel = parentViewModel;
        CarDataModel = carDataItem;
        CompetingCheckboxStatus = CarDataModel.CurrentCar.Competing;
        AcknowledgeAlarm = new ParameterlessCommand(AcknowledgeAlarmClicked);
        Acknowledge = new ParameterlessCommand(AcknowledgeClicked);
        ShowReport = new ParameterlessCommand(ShowReportClicked);
        Cancel = new ParameterlessCommand(CancelClicked);
    }
 Here's the xaml where the bindings are set up - AcknowledgeAlarm is the ICommand, CarDataModel is the detail model object: <ListView x:Name="itemGridView"Grid.Row="1"ScrollViewer.HorizontalScrollBarVisibility="Disabled" ItemsSource="{Binding CarDataViewModels}" IsSynchronizedWithCurrentItem="True" Margin="0,0,0,0">

This is all good and well however in UDP case, if the sender has a lot of info being sent, do we risk loosing the data. Say another device sends a 2MB photo via UDP and we check socket receive every 100msec. At 2MBps, the underlying system must store 200Kbits before our call queries the underlying TCP stack. Is there a way to get an event fired when we receive the data on the particular socket instead of the polling we have to do now?

@CONTENT:Many blogs use the concept of "tags" and "categories" to add metadata to a post. What is the best practice for semantic markup for this information, such that a machine reading the blog post could easily identify the tags? Currently I add "tag" to the rel attribute on the link, e.g. <a rel="tag" class="tag" href="/tags.html#site-configuration">#site-configuration</a>
 I suppose one could use Dublin Core's html format for keyword: <meta name = "DC.Subject"
          content = "site-configuration">
 and add this to the page header, or can meta tags go in the body? Is one or the other preferable, or some entirely different option? Is there a better strategy in terms of providing precise and standardized definitions for content? Is HTML5 a reasonable choice if I want to be so picky about metadata, or should I be using an XML doctype? What are the pros and cons of the different approaches?

@TITLE:C# Linear Interpolation
@CONTENT:I'm having issues interpolating a data file, which i have converted from .csv into an X array and Y array where X[0] corresponds to point Y[0] for example. I need to interpolate between the values to give me a smooth file at the end. I am using a Picoscope to output the function which means each line is equally spaced in time, so only using Y values, which is why I'm trying to do this in a strange way when you see my code. The kind of values it has to deal with are: X     Y
0     0
2.5   0
2.5   12000
7.5   12000
7.5   3000
10    3000
10    6000
11    6625.254
12    7095.154
 So where 2 Y values next to each other are the same its a straight line between them but when they vary like from X = 10 on wards it becomes a sine wave in this example. I have been looking at the equations for interpolation etc and other posts on here but i haven't done that sort of maths for years and sadly i can't figure it out any more, because there's 2 unknowns and i can't think how to program that into c#.

            q++;//reduce number of reps in this loop
        }

    }

        }
    }
    a++;
}
 and this creates a close waveform but it is still very steppy. So can anyone see why this isn't very accurate? How to improve its accuracy? Or a different way of doing this using arrays? Thanks for looking :)

 I find it a bit troubling not to be able to pout 2 items per row. I would like to know how to format my GridView to be able to fulfill such idea Here is my source code: http://www.mediafire.com/?25vae87fvahu4wp

@TITLE:Erasing using backspace control character
@CONTENT:I am trying to use the backspace control character '\b' to erase trailing commas at the end of line. Although it works in cases where there is no other output to stdout, in case if there is another output after '\b', it becomes useless. Here is an example: #include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int a[] =  { 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 32, 321, 9};
    for ( int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
        cout << a[i] << "," ;
    }
    cout << "\b" ;
    //cout << endl;
    return 0;
}
 In the above block of code, if the line is commented as seen, we get the desired result with no comma after the digit 9. However, if the line uncommented, the comma re-appears. In my program, I do not want the comma to be there, but want an endline after 9. How do I do this ?
@CODE:'\b' stdout '\b' #include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int a[] =  { 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 32, 321, 9};
    for ( int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {

@CONTENT:Possible Duplicate: Set active tab style with AngularJS I'm using AngularJS and trying to add a "current" class to my menu whenever that tab's content is being displayed. This is what I have so far, and it works fine when loading the page: HTML: <ul id="nav">
    <li><a href="#/one" class="highlighttab">One</a></li>
    <li><a href="#/two" class="highlighttab">Two</a></li>
</ul>
 JS: myModule.directive('highlighttab', function($location) {
    var currentPath = "#" + $location.path();

    return {
        restrict: 'C',
        link: function(scope, element, attrs) {
            var href = element.attr("href");
            if (currentPath == href)
            {
                element.addClass("current");
            }
        }
    };
});
 This will add the 'current' class to the correct <a> tag when the page url is #/one or /#two The problem is if I click the second tab, the class does not get added to it. I imagine I need some way to get the code inside the directive to be re-run when the URL changes. Is there any way to do that ?
@CODE:<ul id="nav">
    <li><a href="#/one" class="highlighttab">One</a></li>
    <li><a href="#/two" class="highlighttab">Two</a></li>

@TITLE:Fastest way to perform bulk add/insert in Neo4j with Python?
@CONTENT:I am finding Neo4j slow to add nodes and relationships/arcs/edges when using the REST API via py2neo for Python. I understand that this is due to each REST API call executing as a single self-contained transaction. Specifically, adding a few hundred pairs of nodes with relationships between them takes a number of seconds, running on localhost. What is the best approach to significantly improve performance whilst staying with Python? Would using bulbflow and Gremlin be a way of constructing a bulk insert transaction? Thanks!

@TITLE:Execute automatic change connected displays in Windows 8
@CONTENT:Short version How do I automate changing multiple display settings? NVIDIA, 3x monitors (2x DVI and 1x HDMI), GPU only supports 2 active monitors. Long version So I have a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 560 Ti which can run two displays simultaneously. It has two DVI connections and one HDMI. I often swap from using my two desktop monitors and connect only one of the desktop monitors plus my TV using HDMI. I would like to automate the change back and forward using a batch script or other program instead of using the windows control panel (Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Display\Screen Resolution) or the NVIDIA Control Panel. I found some documentation on using "rundll32.exe, NvCpl.dll, dtcfg ...." etc. This did not work at all. Nothing happens for any parameters I use from the NVIDIA PDF documentation. Does anyone have an example that works? I have tried this on Windows 7 as well. I have tried to use WMI to see if the monitor is there, but it only shows the two active monitors. It does not show the third inactive monitor. I have tried EnumDisplayDevices from User32.dll, but this only returns the two active monitors. How can I get this working? I would like to get this working in C#, so I can use it with changing audio device as well :)

The window.mything object will have some functions that I will define in the extension, and these functions should be callable from console.log or any Javascript file when the page is viewed in a browser with the extension enabled. I was able to successfully inject a Javascript file into the page by using a Content Script: var s = document.createElement("script"); 
s.src = chrome.extension.getURL("mything.js");
document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(s);
 mything.js looks like this: window.mything = {thing: true};
console.log(window);
 Whenever a page loads, I see the entire window object as I expect it to be in the console. However, I can't interact with the window.mything object from the console. It seems at if the injected script hasn't really modified the global window object. How can I modify the global window object from a Chrome extension?

@CONTENT:Our method of deploying a new version of an app for weblogic (11g) is to copy over top of the existing ear file and then stop and restart the weblogic server. We do a start/stop of weblogic rather than a redeployment, because of the known permgen issue (where eventually we will run out of perm gen and have to bounce the weblogic server). However, this method of deploying has a drawback-- new JSP versions are not seen by weblogic. In order to fix this we have had to wipe out the contents of the tmp directory that maintain a cache of the compiled JSPs prior to restarting the server. Is there a setting that would tell weblogic to wipe the cache/reload/recompile JSPs when it starts back up?

Often client work in environments where the internet connection is poor or not available. In this case I would like the client to be able to work offline: enter new names, descriptions, prices and use the last VAT to perform calculations. Then synchronise all data as soon as a connection is available. Now the problem is that I do not know what is the best way or technologies for achieving this. Don't worry, I am not asking to write code for me. Can you just explain to me what is the correct way to build such a system? Is there a simple way to use my online MySQL and PHP code locally? Should I save the data I need in a local file, rebuild the calculation in JavaScript, perform them locally and then synchronise the data if database is available. Should I use two MySQL database, one local and one online and do a synchronisation between the two when data is available? If yes which technology (language) shall I use to perform this operation? If possible, I would like an answer from PHP coders that worked on a similar project in the past and can give me detailed information on framework structure and technology to use. please remember that I am new to this way of writing application and I would appreciate if you can spare few minutes and explain everything to me like if I am six year old or stupid (which I am!)

@TITLE:What's the best way to serve up multiple binary files from a single WebApi method?
@CONTENT:I have an ASP.NET MVC 4 Web Api controller method that gets passed a list of file IDs and returns thumbnail images for those files. So, the client might pass in a list of numeric IDs (e.g. 10, 303, 29), and the method returns a List where a ThumbnailImage looks a bit like this: class ThumbnailImage
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    // Some other stuff
    public byte[] RawData { get; set; }
}
 The reason that the caller passes in a list of IDs rather than making one call per item should hopefully be obvious - there may be dozens or hundreds of items to download, and I'm trying to avoid all the HTTP traffic that would be required to download them individually. Currently, I'm using RestSharp and JSON.NET, and so my ThumbnailImage objects are being passed across the wire as JSON. It's fine from a simplicity-of-coding point of view, but JSON is not an efficient way to represent that binary data. So, I'm thinking that I should return the raw bytes as an octet-stream... however, while I can easily do that for a single image, I'm not sure of the best way to do it for multiple images, especially when I also need to return the ID and miscellaneous other information for each file. (The ID is required since the results will not necessarily be returned in a given order - and some files may be missing). I could simply write everything piecemeal into the response stream, so that for each item I write the ID (suitably encoded), followed by the length of the image data, followed by the image data itself, and then followed by the same thing for the next item, etc. The caller would then simply keep reading from the stream until it was exhausted, making assumptions about the encoding (and length!) of the IDs, etc. I think that would work, but it seems clunky - is there a better way?

{
    public int Id { get; set; }

@CONTENT:I am scraping a soccer site and the spider (a single spider) gets several kinds of items from the site's pages: Team, Match, Club etc. I am trying to use the CSVItemExporter to store these items in separate csv files, teams.csv, matches.csv, clubs.csv etc. I am not sure what is the right way to do this. The only way I have thought so far is to create my own custom pipeline like in the example http://doc.scrapy.org/en/0.14/topics/exporters.html and there open all needed csv files in the spider_opened method, ie create a csv exporter for each csv file and in the process_item put code to figure out what kind of item is the "item" parameter and then send it to the corresponding exporter object. Anyway I haven't found any examples of handling multiple csv files (per item type) in scrapy so I am worrying that I am using it in a way that is not meant to be used.

Worksheet_Change triggers when a cell changes, but also when you enter a cell as if to edit but don't actually change the cell's value.

End Sub
 Now to test my work: Change cell A1 and the cell gets highlighted. That's what I'd expect. Double click B1 but don't change the value there and then click C1. You'll notice B1 gets highlighted! Do I have to go through the methods discussed here of capturing the old value, then compare old to new before highlighting the cell? I certainly hope there's something I'm missing.

@TITLE:How to test inline installation of Chromium/Chrome extensions locally?
@CONTENT:I am trying to test the inline installation feature of the Chrome Webstore as per this document (https://developers.google.com/chrome/web-store/docs/inline_installation). I am developing this locally to test and cannot easily and often push my changes live. How do I test inline installation locally since inline installation depends on your site being verified in Webmaster Tools? Code if (!chrome.app.isInstalled) {
    chrome.webstore.install(undefined, undefined, function(err) {
        console.log(err);
    });
}
 This returns: Installs can only be initiated by the Chrome Web Store item's verified site 
 Obviously localhost is not a verified site. Any help is appreciated.

@TITLE:How to add different lines for facets
@CONTENT:I have data were I look at the difference in growth between a monoculture and a mixed culture for two different species. And I made a graph to make my data clear. I want a barplot with errorbars, the whole dataset is ofcourse bigger, but for this graph this is the dataframe with the means for the barplot. plant           species         means
Mixed culture   Elytrigia   0.886625
Monoculture Elytrigia   1.022667
Monoculture Festuca     0.314375
Mixed culture   Festuca     0.078125
 With this data I made a graph in ggplot2, were plant is on the x-ass and means on the y-ass, and I used a facet to devide the species. This is my code:     limits <- aes(ymax = meansS$means + eS$se, ymin=meansS$means - eS$se)
    dodge <- position_dodge(width=0.9)

    myplot<-ggplot(data=meansS, aes(x=plant, y=means, fill=plant)) + facet_grid(. ~ species) 
    myplot<- myplot + geom_bar(position=dodge) + geom_errorbar(limits, position=dodge, width=0.25)
    myplot <- myplot + scale_fill_manual(values=c("#6495ED","#FF7F50"))
    myplot <- myplot +labs(x = "Plant treatment", y = "Shoot biomass (gr)")  
    myplot <- myplot + opts(title="Plant competition")
    myplot <- myplot + opts(legend.position = "none")
    myplot <- myplot + opts(panel.grid.minor=theme_blank(), panel.grid.major=theme_blank())
 So far it is fine, I want however to add two different horizontal lines in the two facet. For that I used this code:     hline.data <- data.frame(z = c(0.511,0.157),species = c("Elytrigia","Festuca")) 
    myplot <- myplot + geom_hline(aes(yintercept = z), hline.data)
 However if I do that I get a plot were there are two extra facets, were the two horizontal lines are plotted.However I want the horizontal lines to be plotted in the facets with the bars, not to make two new facets. Anyone a idea how to solve this. So I thought it makes it clearer if I put the graph I got now:
@CODE:plant           species         means

@TITLE:Open iPhone App from an Email Link
@CONTENT:I've working on a program where an email is sent to a user, and a link to open the iPhone app is embedded in the email. The problem is that when the user clicks the link to open the app, mail has stripped out the colon, so the link no longer works! The link being created basically looks like this: @"<BR><BR><BR><A HREF=\"http://myApp://\">Open App</A>"
 But the link, when clicked in the email, opens this in the browser instead: myApp// with no colon, so the app doesn't launch and the browser says it can't find the page. Any ideas how to fix this? Thanks!

@TITLE:Reading files from a ZIP file in your Android assets folder
@CONTENT:I'm reading files from a ZIP file that's located in my Android assets folder using ZipInputStream: it works, but it's really slow, as it has to read it sequentially using getNextEntry(), and there are quite a lot of files. If I copy the ZIP file onto the SD card, reading is really fast when using ZipFile.getEntry, but I didn't find a way to use ZipFile with the asset file! Is there any way to access the ZIP in the asset folder in a speedy way? Or do I really have to copy the ZIP to the SD card? (BTW, in case anybody wonders why I'm doing this: the app is larger than 50 MB, so in order to get it in the Play Store I have to use Expansion APKs; however, as this app should also be put into the Amazon App Store, I have to use another version for this, as Amazon doesn't support Expansion APKs, naturally... I thought that accessing a ZIP file at two different locations would be an easy way to handle this, but alas...)

@TITLE:Resources$NotFoundException in Graphical Layout ADT preview (but app actually Works)
@CONTENT:My problem is that loading an array of strings defined in XML works in the app but will result in an error in the ADT Graphical Layout preview. Now I can't see any graphics in the Graphical Layout because of this error, and it's difficult to work with other graphics. But the view is loading and displaying the strings fine if I build and run my app. So I suppose my code is correct but either: I am missing some limitations of the Graphical Layout preview and some workaround or perhaps I'm missing something obvious and doing things wrong even if it seems to work in the app I have a custom view where I get an array defined by me in an array.xml file. public class ScoreTable extends View {
  [...]
  @Override
  protected void onDraw(Canvas canvas) {
    [...]
    int score_vals[] = getResources().getIntArray(R.array.score_vals);
    [...]
  }
  [...]
}
 My array is defined in res/values/array.xml: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
    <array name="score_vals">
        <item >10</item>
        <item >20</item>
        <item >50</item>
    </array>
</resources>
 Graphical Layout is blank and says: Int array resource ID #0x7f050000
Exception details are logged in Window > Show View > Error Log
 But of course I have "public static final int score_vals=0x7f050000;" in R.java! The details of this error are in a 50-deep stack, but resumes to this: android.content.res.Resources$NotFoundException: Int array resource ID #0x7f050000

 So, should getResources().getXXXArray() work in the context of a ADT Graphical Layout preview? I would like to mention that I tried with both "array" and "array-integer" in the XML, and both work in the app but not in the preview. Also I tried to save the Context from the constructor of the view in a private Context member... didn't help either.

@TITLE:Multiple Django sites with shared codebase and DB
@CONTENT:I have created a Django proyect with 20 sites (one different domain per site) for 20 different countries. The sites share everything: codebase, database, urls, templates, etc. The only thing they don't share are small customizations (logo, background color of the CSS theme, language code, etc.) that I set in each of the site settings file (each site has one settings file, and all of these files import a global settings file with the common stuff). Right now, in order to run the sites in development mode I'll do: django-admin.py runserver 8000 --settings=config.site_settings.site1
django-admin.py runserver 8001 --settings=config.site_settings.site2
...
django-admin.py runserver 8020 --settings=config.site_settings.site20
 I have a couple of questions: I've read that it is possible to create a virtual host for each site (domain) and pass it the site's settings.py file. However, I am afraid this would create one Django instance per site. Am I right? Is there a more efficient way of doing the deployment? I've read about django-dynamicsites but I am not sure if it is the right way to go. If I decide to deploy using Heroku, it seems that Heroku expects only one settings file per app, so I would need to have 20 apps. Is there a solution for that? Thanks!

@TITLE:Convert unicode string to byte string
@CONTENT:I get a string from a function that is represented like u'\xd0\xbc\xd0\xb0\xd1\x80\xd0\xba\xd0\xb0', but to process it I need it to be bytestring (like '\xd0\xbc\xd0\xb0\xd1\x80\xd0\xba\xd0\xb0'). How do I convert it without changes? My best guess so far is to take s.encode('unicode_escape'), which will return '\\xd0\\xbc\\xd0\\xb0\\xd1\\x80\\xd0\\xba\\xd0\\xb0' and process every 5 characters so that '\xd0' becomes one character represented as '\xd0'.

@TITLE:What 'length' parameter should I pass to SqlDataReader.GetBytes()
@CONTENT:I have a SqlDataReader and need to read a varbinary(max) column from it using the SqlDataReader.GetBytes() method. This method populates a byte array and therefore needs to know what length of data to read. This is where I get confused.. Clearly I want to read all the data that has been returned from the database in this row/column so what 'length' parameter should I pass? As far as I can see, the SqlDataReader doesn't provide any methods to discover what length of data is available, therefore this method seems fairly awkward to me. I'm tempted to just pass int.MaxValue here and forget about the issue but something about this doesn't sit right with me. I am aware that I can instead call byte[] value = (byte[])dataReader["columnName"];
 .. and this seems to completely take care of the length issue internally. However I am working with a set of complicated code generation templates that have been built around the SqlDataReader.GetXXXX() methods. So I am tied into using GetBytes and need to understand its proper usage.

 What I want is the content between the two text tags, including any tags: Some text with <extradata>data</extradata> in it. It spans <sometag>multiple lines: <tag>one</tag>, <tag>two</tag> or more</sometag>. For now I use regular expressions but it get's kinda messy and I don't like this approach.

@TITLE:How to force STORE (overwrite) to HDFS in Pig?
@CONTENT:When developing Pig scripts that use the STORE command I have to delete the output directory for every run or the script stops and offers: 2012-06-19 19:22:49,680 [main] ERROR org.apache.pig.tools.grunt.Grunt - ERROR 6000: Output Location Validation Failed for: 'hdfs://[server]/user/[user]/foo/bar More info to follow:
Output directory hdfs://[server]/user/[user]/foo/bar already exists
 So I'm searching for an in-Pig solution to automatically remove the directory, also one that doesn't choke if the directory is non-existent at call time. In the Pig Latin Reference I found the shell command invoker fs. Unfortunately the Pig script breaks whenever anything produces an error. So I can't use fs -rmr foo/bar
 (i. e. remove recursively) since it breaks if the directory doesn't exist. For a moment I thought I may use fs -test -e foo/bar
 which is a test and shouldn't break or so I thought. However, Pig again interpretes test's return code on a non-existing directory as a failure code and breaks. There is a JIRA ticket for the Pig project addressing my problem and suggesting an optional parameter OVERWRITE or FORCE_WRITE for the STORE command. Anyway, I'm using Pig 0.8.1 out of necessity and there is no such parameter.

@TITLE:Multiple Colors for Each Item in JComboBox
@CONTENT:I'm trying to make a ComboBox that uses different colors for different items. I wrote out some test code but it doesn't seem to work. Adding in the renderer causes the program to crash but commenting it out makes the box display on in the frame. Is there anything I'm missing or am I doing this the wrong way? I tried using the custom ComboBox Renderer tutorial as an example. Here is my code: TestComboColor.java import java.awt.Color;

import javax.swing.JComboBox;
import javax.swing.JFrame;


public class TestComboColor {

    static Color[] colors = {Color.BLUE, Color.GRAY, Color.RED};
    static String[] strings = {"Test1", "Test2", "Test3"};

    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        JFrame frame = new JFrame("JAVA");
        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
        JComboBox cmb = new JComboBox();
        ComboBoxRenderer renderer = new ComboBoxRenderer(cmb);

        renderer.setColors(colors);
        renderer.setStrings(strings);

        cmb.setRenderer(renderer);

        frame.add(cmb);
        frame.pack();
        frame.setVisible(true);
    }
}
 ComboBoxRenderer.java import java.awt.Color;
import java.awt.Component;

import javax.swing.JComboBox;
import javax.swing.JLabel;
import javax.swing.JList;
import javax.swing.JPanel;
import javax.swing.ListCellRenderer;


public final class ComboBoxRenderer extends JPanel implements ListCellRenderer
{

    private static final long serialVersionUID = -1L;
    private Color[] colors;
    private String[] strings;

    JPanel textPanel;
    JLabel text;

    public ComboBoxRenderer(JComboBox combo) {

        textPanel = new JPanel();
        textPanel.add(this);
        text = new JLabel();
        text.setOpaque(true);
        text.setFont(combo.getFont());
        textPanel.add(text);
    }

    public void setColors(Color[] col)
    {
        colors = col;
    }

    public void setStrings(String[] str)
    {
        strings = str;
    }

    public Color[] getColors()
    {
        return colors;
    }

    public String[] getStrings()
    {
        return strings;
    }

    @Override
    public Component getListCellRendererComponent(JList list, Object value,
            int index, boolean isSelected, boolean cellHasFocus) {

        if (isSelected)
        {
            setBackground(list.getSelectionBackground());
        }
        else
        {
        }

        if (colors.length != strings.length)
        {
            System.out.println("colors.length does not equal strings.length");
            return this;
        }
        else if (colors == null)
        {
            System.out.println("use setColors first.");
            return this;
        }
        else if (strings == null)
        {
            System.out.println("use setStrings first.");
            return this;

        text.setText(strings[index]);
        text.setForeground(colors[index]);

 The C style cast in the main function cannot be correctly expressed in terms of the C++ casts (static_cast, dynamic_cast, reinterpret_cast). But what is the reason to allow this in the first place? Doesn't it hurt encapsulation?

@TITLE:NetworkOnMainThreadException on Facebook Login with Phonegap 1.6.0
@CONTENT:I am currently creating an application using Phonegap 1.6.0 and Sencha Touch 1.1. Recently, when testing on a smartphone with Android 4.0.4, we discovered that the Facebook Login doesn't quite work as expected. We are using the Phonegap Facebook Plugin located here with patches for Cordova. What happens is that, once we try logging into Facebook on a Smartphone with Android Honeycomb or higher, the application launches a NetworkOnMainThreadException because Network operations aren't permitted on the main thread. This exception is only thrown on Android Honeycomb or above, which is why we didn't notice it on 2.3.3. The exception is thrown when calling FB.login() and the callback is not reached. I have checked various threads and topics but all are extremely vague. I'm aware that I have to run the network operation in a seperate thread, but I am unsure how this should be done. Threading appears to happen in Java, but I'm not using any Java at all, so before monkeying around in code that wasn't written by me, I'd like some help. I will try to narrow down what part causes the exception later. Any help would be appreciated.

@CONTENT:Possible Duplicate: Python read a single character from the user I am looking to be able to control a robot with the arrow keys using python. And my idea was to implement code that looked something like this... #!/usr/bin/env python
# control a robot using python
exit = 0
while exit == 0:
  keypress = ##get keypress, if no key is pressed, continue##
  if keypress == 'q':
    exit = 1

  elif keypress == KEY_UP:
    ##robot move forward##
  elif keypress == KEY_DOWN:

 However the problem is that I do not know how to get the users input. And I cannot use a GUI based solution like pygame from what I have found because the robot does not use a display. Any help is very much appreciated!!

@TITLE:Django PIL : IOError Cannot identify image file
@CONTENT:I'm learning Python and Django. An image is provided by the user using forms.ImageField(). Then I have to process it in order to create two different sized images. When I submit the form, Django returns the following error: IOError at /add_event/
cannot identify image file
 I call the resize function: def create_event(owner_id, name, image):         
    image_thumb = image_resizer(image, name, '_t', 'events', 180, 120)  
    image_medium = image_resizer(image, name, '_m', 'events', 300, 200)
 I get en error when image_resizer is called for the second time: def image_resizer(image, name, size, app_name, length, height): 
    im = Image.open(image)
    if im.mode != "RGB":

    im = create_thumb(im, length, height)
    posit = str(MEDIA_ROOT)+'/'+app_name+'/'

    imageurl = posit + image_name
    image_2.save(imageurl,'JPEG',quality=80)
    url_image='/'+app_name+'/'+image_name  
    return url_image
 Versions: Django 1.3.1 Python 2.7.1 PIL 1.1.7 I'm trying to find the problem, but i don't know what to do. Thank you in advanced! EDIT I solved rewriting the function; now it creates the different images in batch: I call the resize function: url_array = image_resizer.resize_batch(image, image_name, [[180,120,'_t'], [300,200,'_m']], '/events/')  
 so: image_thumb = url_array[0]
image_medium = url_array[1]
 and the resize function: def resize_batch(image, name, size_array, position):
    im = Image.open(image)
    if im.mode != "RGB":
        im = im.convert("RGB")
    url_array = []

@TITLE:How can I make this call to request in nodejs synchronous?
@CONTENT:I have a function in my nodejs application called get_source_at. It takes a uri as an argument and its purpose is to return the source code from that uri. My problem is that I don't know how to make the function synchronously call request, rather than giving it that callback function. I want control flow to halt for the few seconds it takes to load the uri. How can I achieve this? function get_source_at(uri){
    var source;
    request({ uri:uri}, function (error, response, body) {
        console.log(body);
    });
    return source;
}
 Also, I've read about 'events' and how node is 'evented' and I should respect that in writing my code. I'm happy to do that, but I have to have a way to make sure I have the source code from a uri before continuing the control flow of my application - so if that's not by making the function synchronous, how can it be done?

 The RPC I make is the following: void getVacs() {
    try {
        homeService.getVacancies(new AsyncCallback<ArrayList<Vacancy>>() {
            public void onFailure(Throwable caught)
            {
                RootPanel.get("grayblock").add(new HTML("Failed:" + caught.getMessage()));
            }

            public void onSuccess(ArrayList<Vacancy> result)
            {
                RootPanel.get("grayblock").add(new HTML(result.get(0).getTitle()));
            }
        });
    } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
        // TODO Auto-generated catch block
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
 I thought I had done all I needed to make Vacancy Serializable, and an ArrayList of Vacancy as returntype for the RPC counts as having Vacancy as return type.. right? What am I doing wrong? Thanks in advance!

using namespace std;

void wait () {

int random (int low, int high) {

@CONTENT:Here I've two lines of code const char * s1 = "test";

 Both lines of code have the same behavior, so I cannot see any difference whether I should prefer s1 over s2 or vice-versa. In addition to s1 and s2, there is also the way of using std::string. I think the way of using std::string is the most elegant. While looking at other code, I often see that people either use const char * or char s []. Thus, my question is now, when should I use const char * s1 or char s [] or std::string? What are the differences and in which situations should I use which approach?

@TITLE:Conflict between copy constructor and forwarding constructor
@CONTENT:This problem is based on code that works for me on GCC-4.6 but not for another user with CLang-3.0, both in C++0x mode. template <typename T>
struct MyBase
{
//protected:
    T  m;

    template <typename Args...>
    MyBase( Args&& ...x ) : m( std::forward<Args>(x)... ) {}
};
 An object of MyBase can take any list of constructor arguments, as long as T supports that construction signature. The problem has to do with the special-member functions. IIUC, the constructor template cancels the automatically-defined default constructor. However, since the template can accept zero arguments, it will act as an explicitly-defined default constructor (as long as T is default-constructible). IIUC, determination of a class' copy-construction policy ignores constructor templates. That means in this case that MyBase will gain an automatically-defined copy constructor (as long as T is copyable) that'll channel T copy-construction. Apply the previous step for move-construction too. So if I pass a MyBase<T> const & as the sole constructor argument, which constructor gets called, the forwarding one or the implicit copying one? typedef std::vector<Int>  int_vector;
typedef MyBase<int_vector>   VB_type;

int_vector  a{ 1, 3, 5 };
VB_type     b{ a };
VB_type     c{ b };  // which constructor gets called
 My user's problem was using this in as a base class. The compiler complained that his class couldn't synthesize an automatically-defined copy constructor, because it couldn't find a match with the base class' constructor template. Shouldn't it be calling MyBase automatic copy-constructor for its own automatic copy-constructor? Is CLang in error for coming up with a conflict?
@CODE:template <typename T>
struct MyBase
{
//protected:
    T  m;

    template <typename Args...>
    MyBase( Args&& ...x ) : m( std::forward<Args>(x)... ) {}
}; MyBase T T MyBase T T MyBase<T> const & typedef std::vector<Int>  int_vector;
typedef MyBase<int_vector>   VB_type;

int_vector  a{ 1, 3, 5 };

    Toast toast = Toast.makeText(ContentView.this, R.string.messageWordAddedToFarvourite, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT);
    toast.show();

@CONTENT:I am doing a iPhone app using Phonegap & also using jquery mobile. I want to set background image for data-role=page div. In this height of page is equal to screen & hence background is set to size of screen. But the page content length is much greater than screen & hence gray background is seen after image completes. My question is whether there is a way so that we can keep the background image fixed & scroll or move only content of page & not background image. Just to mention I have tried full size background jquery pluggin. Its working on Android but not on iOS. Can anyone please help? Thanks in advance.

@TITLE:Configuring JDO in Spring 3.1?
@CONTENT:I used to have all my DAOs extend the JdoDaoSupport class which is now deprecated in Spring 3.1. I've made my own AbstractJdoDao class which wraps the PersistenceManagerFactory and all the DAOs extend from there. Is that the way I should be doing? Also in the documentation on JDO, it seems that the direct instantiation of PersistenceManagerFactory is not the default option, but to use LocalPersistenceManagerFactoryBean wrapped in a TransactionAwarePersistenceManagerFactoryProxy. How to properly instantiate these beans and make them work with the Spring's @Transactional annotations. Here's the persistence-related part of my application context: <bean id="persistenceManagerFactoryProxy" class="org.springframework.orm.jdo.TransactionAwarePersistenceManagerFactoryProxy">

@LINK:/questions/8818688/printing-png-images-to-a-zebra-network-printer
@TITLE:Printing PNG images to a zebra network printer
@CONTENT:I am trying to find a way of printing images to a zebra and having a lot of trouble. According to the docs: The first encoding, known as B64, encodes the data using the MIME Base64 scheme. Base64 is used to encode e-mail atachedments ... Base64 encodes six bits to the byte, for an expantion of 33 percent over the un-enclosed data. The second encoding, known as Z64, first compresses the data using the LZ77 algorithm to reduce its size. (This algorithm is used by the PKZIP and is intergral to the PNG graphics format.) The compressed data is then encoded using the MIME Base64 scheme as described above. A CRC will be calculated accross the Base64-encoded data. But it doesn't have a great deal more info. Basically I was trying encoding with private byte[] GetItemFromPath(string filepath)
{   
    using (MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream())
    {
        using (Image img = Image.FromFile(filepath))
        {
            img.Save(ms, ImageFormat.Png);
            return ms.ToArray();
        }
    }
}
 Then trying to print with something like: var initialArray = GetItemFromPath("C:\\RED.png");
string converted = Convert.ToBase64String(b);

PrintThis(string.Format(@"~DYRED.PNG,P,P,{1},0,:B64:
{0}
^XA
^F0200,200^XGRED.PNG,1,1^FS
^XZ", converted .ToString(), initialArray.Length));
 From the sounds of it, either B64 or Z64 are both accepted. I've tried a few variations, and a couple of methods for generating the CRC and calculating the 'size'. But none seem to work and the download of the graphics to the printer is always getting aborted. Has anyone managed to accomplish something like this? Or knows where I am going wrong?
@CODE:private byte[] GetItemFromPath(string filepath)
{   
    using (MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream())
    {
        using (Image img = Image.FromFile(filepath))
        {
            img.Save(ms, ImageFormat.Png);
            return ms.ToArray();
        }
    }
} var initialArray = GetItemFromPath("C:\\RED.png");
string converted = Convert.ToBase64String(b);

PrintThis(string.Format(@"~DYRED.PNG,P,P,{1},0,:B64:

Kernel Mode is a privileged mode (PM) while user space is non privileged (NPM). In PM CPU can access all memory while in NPM some memory is restricted - cannot be accessed by CPU. When remap_pfn_range is called, how is that range of memory which was restricted only to PM is now accessible to user space? Looking at remap_pfn_range code there is pgprot_t struct. This is protection mapping related struct. What is protection mapping? Is it the answer to above question?

@TITLE:VSTO: getting Excel cell properties in ：bulk；
@CONTENT:When fetching values from a range in Excel, it is much more efficient to get the values in "bulk" (as a 2D array) than looping through each row and column. For example: Dim range = Globals.Table.Range("A1:E5")
Dim values(,) As Object = range.Value
 With 25 cells it doesn't make much of a difference, but with 10,000 rows by 20 columns it certainly does. So far so good. My question is: has anyone found a way to do the same sort of "bulk" fetching for other properties? For example, I want to find which cells are colored a certain way. I would love to do something like "range.Interior.Color", but that returns just one value, not an array of values. And so I end up looping, which is probably 100 or even 1000 times slower. For large tables, this is really a killer. PS: It looks like .Formula behaves just like .Value: I can fetch multiple ones at a time. But I've yet to cajole colors into playing nice.

@LINK:/questions/8319484/regarding-background-processes-using-fork-and-child-processes-in-my-dummy-shel
@TITLE:Regarding background processes using fork() and child processes in my dummy shell
@CONTENT:I'm trying to create a simple shell program in C. What I need it to do is provide the user with a prompt in which they can run other local programs. I can do that part fine, using a fork() in which the parent process waits() on the child,and the child execvp()'s the program. However, if the '&' character is appended to the end of the user's command, I need their program to run in the background, meaning I need the parent to NOT wait on the child process but instead immediately return the prompt to the user, while allowing the background process to continue to run, bbut not allowing it to display anything on the screen. I just want to be able to check that it still exists via ps command. I tried to understand the idea behind using fork() to create a child, then have the child fork() again to create a grandchild of sorts, then immediately exit()-ing the child process. i.e., orphan the grandchild. Supposedly this allows the parent to still wait on the child, but since the child effectually ends almost immediately, it's like it doesn't wait at all? Something about zombie madness? I don't know. Several sites I've come across seem to recommend this as a way to run a process in the background. However, when I try to do this, I get wild things happening with the flow of the program, the 'background' process continues to display input on the screen, and I'm really not sure where to go from here. This is my implementation of the code, which I'm sure is quite wrong. I'm just wondering if this whole grandchild thing is even the route I need to take,and if so, what's wrong with my code? 36 int main(int argc, char *argv[])
37 {
38     char buffer[512];
39     char *args[16];
40     int background;
41     int *status;
42     size_t arg_ct;
43     pid_t pid;
44 
45     while(1)
46     {
47         printf("> ");
48         fgets(buffer, 512, stdin);
49         parse_args(buffer, args, 16, &arg_ct);
50 
51         if (arg_ct == 0) continue;
52 
53         if (!strcmp(args[0], "exit"))
54         {
55             exit(0);
56         }
57 
58         pid = fork();  //here I fork and create a child process
61 
62         if (pid && !background)  //i.e. if it's the parent process and don't need to run in the background (this is the part that seems to work)
63         {
64             printf("Waiting on child (%d).\n", pid);
65             pid = wait(status);
66             printf("Child (%d) finished.\n", pid);
67         }
68         else
69         {
70             if (background && pid == 0) { //if it's a child process and i need to run the command in background
71                
72                 pid = fork(); //fork child and create a grandchild
73                 if (pid) exit(0); //exit child and orphan grandchild
74

79         }
80     }
81     return 0;
82 }
 P.S. To be clear, I need the process that I'm running in the background to never make a sound again, even if it's got an infinite loop of print statements or something. I just want to make sure that it is still running in the background via ps -a or something. Sorry for the confusing explanation I just don't know how to explain it any better. Thanks in advance P.P.S I'll be implementing it so that each subsequent command will determine the boolean value of 'background', sorry for the confusion

 This is the class that I'm trying to deserialize into: public class Whatever {

@TITLE:C++ error-codes vs ASSERTS vs Exceptions choices choices :(
@CONTENT:Code In question I have heard (and regurgitated) the C++ exception mantra on both sides of the fence. It has been a while and I just want to centre myself once more, and this discussion is specific to the code I have linked (or low level classes such as containers), and it's dependencies. I used to be a defensive and error_code using C programmer, but it's a tiresome practise and I am programming at a higher level of abstraction now. So I am rewriting a container class (and it's dependencies) to be more flexible and read better (iterators absent atm). As you can see I am returning enumerated error_codes where I know I will test them at call-site. The containers are for runtime building of AST's, initialize and make read-only. The exceptions are their to prevent the container being used naively (possibly by myself in the future). I have exceptions all over the place in this class, and they make me feel dirty. I appreciate their use-case. If I had the choice I might turn them off altogether (Boost uses exceptions a lot, and I am building off Boost, and yes I know they can be disabled, but when in Rome....) . I have the choice of replacing them with error_codes but hey, I will not test them , so what is the point ? Should I replace them with ASSERTS ? What is this bloat people speak off [1] [2] [3]? does every function callsite get extra machinery ? or only those that have a catch clause ? Since I won't catch these exceptions I shouldn't be a victim of this bloatage right ? ASSERTS do not make their way into release builds, in the context of fundamental primitive classes ( -- i.e, containers) does that even matter ? I mean how high are the chances that logic errors would find their way into a final build ? Since we like to answer focused questions, here is mine: What would you do, and why ? :D Unrelated Link:Error codes and having them piggy backing in an exception. edit 2 in this particular case the choice is between ASSERTs and exceptions, I think exceptions make the most sense, as I mentioned above, the container is read only after initialisation, and most of the exceptions are triggered during initialisation.

With the help of a friend, I have managed to write the output (page contents that curl picked up) to a textfile, but I want to put it in a string variable instead, so I can use the output in other parts of the code. I could just re-open the textfile and read its contents but that's silly, I want to stop writing to a file and just save to a string variable immediately. The write function /* the function to invoke as the data received */
size_t write_data(void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, FILE *stream) {
    size_t written;
    written = fwrite(ptr, size, nmemb, stream);
    return written;
}
 The entire code #include <iostream>
#include "curl/curl.h"

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

/* the function to invoke as the data recieved */
size_t write_data(void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, FILE *stream) {
    size_t written;
    written = fwrite(ptr, size, nmemb, stream);
    return written;
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {

    CURL *curl;
    FILE *fp;
  CURLcode res;

  curl = curl_easy_init();

char outfilename[FILENAME_MAX] = "C:\\Users\\admin\\Downloads\\bbb.txt";

  if(curl) {
char *response = NULL;

        fp = fopen(outfilename,"wb");
        curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "http://www.*hidden*.org/wp-test/lalala.txt");
        curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION, write_data);
        curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_WRITEDATA, fp);
        res = curl_easy_perform(curl);

        curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
        fclose(fp);


  }
    return 0;
}
 I was also hoping someone could elaborate on how this function is used, exactly. I am used (from php and vb.net) to a function like this: function1(ThisIsAvariable,ThisIsAvariableToo)
{
    if ThisIsAvariable = something
    {
         Print "gogopowerrrangers" *append* ThisIsAvariableToo
    }
};
 Which would then be used like: function1(PassThisAsVariable1,PassThisAsVariable2);
 But in the code above, the function size_t write_data(void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, FILE *stream)
 Is simply called like this write_data
 As you can see here: curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION, write_data);
 So what's all this for? (void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, FILE *stream)
 Does curl automatically "fill" those in or does C/C++ work differently with functions than most other languages?
@CODE:curlpp libcurl /* the function to invoke as the data received */
size_t write_data(void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, FILE *stream) {
    size_t written;
    written = fwrite(ptr, size, nmemb, stream);
    return written;
} #include <iostream>
#include "curl/curl.h"

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

/* the function to invoke as the data recieved */
size_t write_data(void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, FILE *stream) {
    size_t written;
    written = fwrite(ptr, size, nmemb, stream);
    return written;
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {

    CURL *curl;
    FILE *fp;
  CURLcode res;

  curl = curl_easy_init();

char outfilename[FILENAME_MAX] = "C:\\Users\\admin\\Downloads\\bbb.txt";

  if(curl) {
char *response = NULL;

        fp = fopen(outfilename,"wb");
        curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "http://www.*hidden*.org/wp-test/lalala.txt");
        curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION, write_data);
        curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_WRITEDATA, fp);
        res = curl_easy_perform(curl);

        curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
        fclose(fp);


  }
    return 0;
} function1(ThisIsAvariable,ThisIsAvariableToo)
{
    if ThisIsAvariable = something
    {
         Print "gogopowerrrangers" *append* ThisIsAvariableToo
    }
}; function1(PassThisAsVariable1,PassThisAsVariable2); size_t write_data(void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, FILE *stream) write_data curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION, write_data); (void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, FILE *stream)

@TITLE:Accept international name characters in RegEx
@CONTENT:I've always struggled with RegEx so forgive me if this may seem like an awful approach at tackling my problem. When users are entering first and last names I started off just using the basic, check for upper and lower case, white space, apostrophes and hyphens if (!preg_match("/^[a-zA-Z\s'-]+$/", $name)) { // Error }
 Now I realise this isn't the best since people could have things such as: Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. (with comma's and fullstops). So I assume by changing it to this would make it slightly more effective. if (!preg_match("/^[a-zA-Z\s,.'-]+$/", $name)) { // Error }
 I then saw a girls name I know on my Facebook who writes her name as Si?n, which got me thinking of names which contain umlauts as well as say Japanese/Chinese/Korean/Russian characters too. So I started searching and found ways by writing each of these characters in there like so. if (!preg_match("/^[a-zA-Z\s??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ,.'-]+$/u", $first_name)) { // Error }
 As you can imagine, it's extremely long winded and I'm pretty certain there is a much simpler RegEx which can achieve this. Like I've said, I've searched around but this is the best I can do. So, what is a good way to check for upper and lower case characters, commas, full stops, apostrophes, hypens, umlauts, Latin, Japanese/Russian etc

@LINK:/questions/7970872/how-to-use-a-different-database-per-application-instance-in-django
@TITLE:How to use a different database per ：application instance； in Django?
@CONTENT:The scenario We have two applications. TheApp TheApp is an incredible app which customers love. Each customer gets his own instance of the application, which means each customer will use a different database (name,user,password). The database connection should be decided on the domain from which the request comes in. req: customerA.foo.tld -> db:(app_cust1, cust1, hunter2)
req: customerB.foo.tld -> db:(app_cust2, cust2, hunter3)
 Administration application Should be able to create/delete TheApp instances for the customers. Therefore it has to setup the new database and write the config to somewhere. The way which decides which db is used for the incoming request should perform well and be easy manageable. The Question Which is the best way to decide which database connection should be used for an instance? What performs the best? What scales best? Answers I came up with? I read stuff and those are the ways I came up with: (wsgi daemon + settings.py) per instance Each customer will get his own settings.py with the database credentials. The settings may inherit some common stuff from a shared settings file. For each new setting file a new wsgi instance of the application has to be started. This may scale badly if we have many customers? Also creating the apache vhost files is ugly. Using 'using' & one settings.py I could do it like MyModel.objects.using(THE_CURRENT_DB).all()
 and set THE_CURRENT_DB somewhere (middleware thingy?) per request. But it seems ugly to have to do this everywhere. Also the settings.py/app has to be rewritten everytime a customer gets his instance. One settings.py + Application Router I didn't yet have a look if I can access any information about the request in the router, but if so, I maybe could decide which of the dbs in settings.py should be used. Kind of like https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/topics/db/multi-db/#an-example but not per model but per request. Modify settings in a middleware Just had the idea that maybe the db setting could be altered in a middleware. Didn't yet have a look how middleware works in Django and what's possible there. Some obscure other way As I'm pretty new with Django I may have missed some points or some of them are just totally silly and bad. What would jes^wyou do? Why not everything in one db? Well. Because I think separation of stuff is good. And if bad things happen not everybody is suddenly affected.
@CODE:req: customerA.foo.tld -> db:(app_cust1, cust1, hunter2)
req: customerB.foo.tld -> db:(app_cust2, cust2, hunter3) MyModel.objects.using(THE_CURRENT_DB).all() THE_CURRENT_DB

@TITLE:How do you use the Event Dispatch Thread?
@CONTENT:I learned about how swing isn't thread-safe. Delving deeper, I discovered that every modification to a swing component must be done on the Event Dispatch Thread in order to prevent various issues associated with multithreading. However, the information seemed to completely stop there. There doesn't seem to be a good tutorial that explains how to do this anywhere accessible on the internet. Patching together information from code posted in relation to other issues, it seemed that I would have to put an untidy block of code around every single swing modification in my program (like this example from my own code): try {
        SwingUtilities.invokeAndWait(new Runnable() {

            public void run() {
                setTitle("Frame title");
                setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
                setVisible(true);

                setSize(800, 480);
                setLocationRelativeTo(null);
                setIconImage(Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().createImage(ClassLoader.getSystemResource("Frame icon.png")));
            }
        });
    } catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
 Basically, is this right? Do I have to put that code (or the equivalent with invokeLater) around every modification to a Swing component in my code? Also, why doesn't Swing do this automatically?
@CODE:try {
        SwingUtilities.invokeAndWait(new Runnable() {

            public void run() {
                setTitle("Frame title");

That is, I want a position of (0.5, 0.5) to be dead center regardless of the x and y axis limits. Is that possible?

@LINK:/questions/7509863/most-idiomatic-way-to-write-batchesof-size-seq-in-f
@TITLE:Most idiomatic way to write batchesOf size seq in F#
@CONTENT:I'm trying to learn F# by rewriting some C# algorithms I have into idiomatic F#. One of the first functions I'm trying to rewrite is a batchesOf where: [1..17] |> batchesOf 5
 Which would split the sequence into batches with a max of five in each, i.e: [[1; 2; 3; 4; 5]; [6; 7; 8; 9; 10]; [11; 12; 13; 14; 15]; [16; 17]]
 My first attempt at doing this is kind of ugly where I've resorted to using a mutable ref object after running into errors trying to use mutable type inside the closure. Using ref is particularly unpleasant since to dereference it you have to use the ! operator which when inside a condition expression can be counter intuitive to some devs who will read it as logical not. Another problem I ran into is where Seq.skip and Seq.take are not like their Linq aliases in that they will throw an error if size exceeds the size of the sequence. let batchesOf size (sequence: _ seq) : _ list seq =
    seq {
        let s = ref sequence
        while not (!s |> Seq.isEmpty)  do
            yield !s |> Seq.truncate size |> List.ofSeq
            s := System.Linq.Enumerable.Skip(!s, size)
    }
 Anyway what would be the most elegant/idiomatic way to rewrite this in F#? Keeping the original behaviour but preferably without the ref mutable variable.
@CODE:[1..17] |> batchesOf 5 [[1; 2; 3; 4; 5]; [6; 7; 8; 9; 10]; [11; 12; 13; 14; 15]; [16; 17]] let batchesOf size (sequence: _ seq) : _ list seq =
    seq {
        let s = ref sequence
        while not (!s |> Seq.isEmpty)  do
            yield !s |> Seq.truncate size |> List.ofSeq
            s := System.Linq.Enumerable.Skip(!s, size)

@TITLE:File I/O on a mounted USB storage device in USB Host mode (Android 3.1 and up)
@CONTENT:Ok, so I have a Android 3.1 tablet (Acer Iconia Tab, which is great by the way) which I can use with Android USB API to connect with a USB Mass Storage Device (a simple USB memory stick). I use USB Host mode, find the device, get permission to connect to it (using BroadcastReceiver). All works great. The problem is that I don't know exactly what to do in order to copy a file from the External Storage Directory to the USB memory stick. This is what I have so far: final BroadcastReceiver mUsbReceiver = new BroadcastReceiver() {
    public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
        String action = intent.getAction();
        if (ACTION_USB_PERMISSION.equals(action)) {

            UsbDevice device = (UsbDevice) intent.getParcelableExtra(UsbManager.EXTRA_DEVICE);

            if (intent.getBooleanExtra(UsbManager.EXTRA_PERMISSION_GRANTED, false)) {
                if (device != null) {

                    // Got to a point where I should set up connection
                    // I'm setting up a very simple connection, just want some file transfer

                    UsbInterface intf = device.getInterface(0);
                    UsbEndpoint endpoint = intf.getEndpoint(0);
                    UsbDeviceConnection connection = UsbManager.openDevice(device);

                    if (connection.claimInterface(intf, true)) {
                        UtilsAndDialogs.print(getApplicationContext(), "Connected to device");

                        // Copy file to USB...

                    } else
                        UtilsAndDialogs.print(getApplicationContext(), "Could not connect!");

 I read the documentation on the Android Dev (http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/usb/host.html) but it's not very explicit and I found a pretty good tutorial (http://www.basic4ppc.com/forum/basic4android-getting-started-tutorials/11289-android-usb-host-tutorial-adbtest.html) but it uses asynchronous communication. I just want to know how should I set up the connection and use the endpoint (I didn't get the endpoint part, why they are needed) to just be able to create a new file on the USB storage device and copy contents of a different file in there, probably using bulkTransfer() method. Any hints or pointers to more explicit documentation would be greatly appreciated. Thank you

 It does work - it infers the schema nicely: <?xml version="1.0"?>

I need to present them to the user so they can do some mapping. I am retrieving an XmlSchema from XmlSchemaSet.Schemas property, and then what? XmlSchema.Elements only contains one item (products), and I can't find any way to look up what its subelements are.

@CONTENT:I've seen on SO and other places that the following is supposed to work (this example is lifted directly from O'Reilly's XSLT Cookbook): (: intersection :)
$set1[count(. | $set2) = count($set2)]

(: difference :)
$set1[count(. | $set2) != count($set2)]
 and it looks like it should be OK, however this seems to fail when used with actual paths rather than variables. For example, given the following document <a>
  <new>
    <val>1</val>
    <val>2</val>
  </new>
  <old>
    <val>2</val>
    <val>3</val>
  </old>
</a>
 and the XPath expression /a/new/val[count(. | /a/old/val)=count(/a/old/val)]/text() I would expect to get the node-set { 2 } but instead am getting { 1 2 }. Any ideas what I'm doing wrong?
@CODE:(: intersection :)
$set1[count(. | $set2) = count($set2)]

@TITLE:Do spin locks always require a memory barrier? Is spinning on a memory barrier expensive?
@CONTENT:I wrote some lock-free code that works fine with local reads, under most conditions. Does local spinning on a memory read necessarily imply I have to ALWAYS insert a memory barrier before the spinning read? (To validate this, I managed to produce a reader/writer combination which results in a reader never seeing the written value, under certain very specific conditions--dedicated CPU, process attached to CPU, optimizer turned all the way up, no other work done in the loop--so the arrows do point in that direction, but I'm not entirely sure about the cost of spinning through a memory barrier.) What is the cost of spinning through a memory barrier if there is nothing to be flushed in the cache's store buffer? i.e., all the process is doing (in C) is while ( 1 ) {
    __sync_synchronize();
    v = value;
    if ( v != 0 ) {
        ... something ...
    }
}
 Am I correct to assume that it's free and it won't encumber the memory bus with any traffic? Another way to put this is to ask: does a memory barrier do anything more than: flush the store buffer, apply the invalidations to it, and prevent the compiler from reordering reads/writes across its location? Disassembling, __sync_synchronize() appears to translate into: lock orl
 From the Intel manual (similarly nebulous for the neophyte): Volume 3A: System Programming Guide, Part 1 --   8.1.2

Bus Locking

Intel 64 and IA-32 processors provide a LOCK# signal that
is asserted automatically during certain critical memory
operations to lock the system bus or equivalent link.
While this output signal is asserted, requests from other
processors or bus agents for control of the bus are
blocked.

[...]

For the P6 and more recent processor families, if the
memory area being accessed is cached internally in the
processor, the LOCK# signal is generally not asserted;
instead, locking is only applied to the processor・s caches
(see Section 8.1.4, ：Effects of a LOCK Operation on
Internal Processor Caches；).
 My translation: "when you say LOCK, this would be expensive, but we're only doing it where necessary." @BlankXavier: I did test that if the writer does not explicitly push out the write from the store buffer and it is the only process running on that CPU, the reader may never see the effect of the writer (I can reproduce it with a test program, but as I mentioned above, it happens only with a specific test, with specific compilation options and dedicated core assignments--my algorithm works fine, it's only when I got curious about how this works and wrote the explicit test that I realized it could potentially have a problem down the road). I think by default simple writes are WB writes (Write Back), which means they don't get flushed out immediately, but reads will take their most recent value (I think they call that "store forwarding"). So I use a CAS instruction for the writer. I discovered in the Intel manual all these different types of write implementations (UC, WC, WT, WB, WP), Intel vol 3A chap 11-10, still learning about them. My uncertainty is on the reader's side: I understand from McKenney's paper that there is also an invalidation queue, a queue of incoming invalidations from the bus into the cache. I'm not sure how this part works. In particular, you seem to imply that looping through a normal read (i.e., non-LOCK'ed, without a barrier, and using volatile only to insure the optimizer leaves the read once compiled) will check into the "invalidation queue" every time (if such a thing exists). If a simple read is not good enough (i.e. could read an old cache line which still appears valid pending a queued invalidation (that sounds a bit incoherent to me too, but how do invalidation queues work then?)), then an atomic read would be necessary and my question is: in this case, will this have any impact on the bus? (I think probably not.) I'm still reading my way through the Intel manual and while I see a great discussion of store forwarding, I haven't found a good discussion of invalidation queues. I've decided to convert my C code into ASM and experiment, I think this is the best way to really get a feel for how this works.

@TITLE:run-time vs. compile-time iPhone version check
@CONTENT:What's the difference between run-time, e.g., [[UIDevice currentDevice] systemVersion], and compile-time, e.g., __IPHONE_OS_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED checking? When should you one over the other? Is__IPHONE_OS_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED just a variable set in Build Settings? I've read the answers to How to target a specific iPhone version? and other related questions listed below. But, I just noticed that __IPHONE_OS_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED = 30200 when I build & run on iPhone (4.3.1) with Xcode 4. Why? When you submit your code to Apple, do they compile a version of it for each version of the iPhone that exists, setting __IPHONE_OS_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED accordingly? That way, you could inspect __IPHONE_OS_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED, and know what iOS version is running the code. Related Questions: Check iPhone iOS Version Check iOS version at runtime? How to check if iOS version supports library?

@TITLE:MATLAB: How to vector-multiply two arrays of matrices?
@CONTENT:I have two 3-dimensional arrays, the first two dimensions of which represent matrices and the last one counts through a parameterspace, as a simple example take A = repmat([1,2; 3,4], [1 1 4]);
 (but assume A(:,:,j) is different for each j). How can one easily perform a per-j matrix multiplication of two such matrix-arrays A and B? C = A; % pre-allocate, nan(size(A,1), size(B,2)) would be better but slower
for jj = 1:size(A, 3)
  C(:,:,jj) = A(:,:,jj) * B(:,:,jj);
end
 certainly does the job, but if the third dimension is more like 1e3 elements this is very slow since it doesn't use MATLAB's vectorization. So, is there a faster way?
@CODE:A = repmat([1,2; 3,4], [1 1 4]); A(:,:,j) j j A B C = A; % pre-allocate, nan(size(A,1), size(B,2)) would be better but slower
for jj = 1:size(A, 3)
  C(:,:,jj) = A(:,:,jj) * B(:,:,jj);

    PopClient.Connect("pop.secureserver.net", 995, true);
    PopClient.Authenticate("username", "pass");
 My problem is that the server does not accept the user credentials. I'm sure the credentials are OK. I have tried the same code with my Gmail account and every thing goes OK. Is something missing that Go Daddy wants me to set? Is there another a .NET tool like OpenPop.NET that I can use to retrieve emails using the POP3 protocol?

I can create a timer to check if the idle time is more than x, and that's fine. It doesn't matter if I detect the idle mode a few seconds later. The problem is to detect when the Mac is not idle anymore. I want my app to show a notification as soon as possible, not a few seconds later. Is there a way to have a notification for that?

@CONTENT:I have a Serial-to-USB device with a similarly named device driver in the Windows device manager. The devices do not always grab the same COM port on system boot, so my program needs to identify it on start up. I've tried using RXTX to enumerate the COM ports on the system, but CommPortIdentifier.getName() simply returns the COM name (eg. COM1, COM2, etc.) I need to acquire either the driver manufacturer name, or the driver name as it appears in the device manager, and associate it with the COM name. Can this easily be done in Java? (I'd be interested in any 3rd party Java libraries that support this.) Otherwise, how I could begin to accomplish this via the win32 API?

 DayRange(0, 5, ErrorMessage = "The Start Date must be between today and 5 days time.")]
public DateTime StartDate { get; set; }
 DayRange is a custom attribute class : [AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Field | AttributeTargets.Property, AllowMultiple = false, Inherited = true)]
public class DayRangeAttribute : RangeAttribute, IClientValidatable

    private int _minimumDays;

    {
        _minimumDays = minimumDays;
        _maximumDays = maximumDays;
    }

    public override bool IsValid(object value)
    {
        var dateToBeTested = value as DateTime?;
        return dateToBeTested.HasValue && dateToBeTested.Value >= DateTime.Today.AddDays(_minimumDays) && dateToBeTested.Value <= DateTime.Today.AddDays(_maximumDays);

}
 I have the following in my web.config: <appSettings>

@TITLE:How to exit a multithreaded program?
@CONTENT:I was just messing around with threading in python, wrote this basic IM thingy [code at bottom] I noticed that when I kill the program with C-c it doesn't exit, it just hangs forever. I'm just guessing it's waiting for each thread to finish what they are doing, but since it's an endless loop that will never happen. So I guess I need to kill each thread manually, or end the loop when the killsignal comes in. How would I do that? #!/usr/bin/env python

@TITLE:Extracting whole words
@CONTENT:I have a large set of real-world text that I need to pull words out of to input into a spell checker. I'd like to extract as many meaningful words as possible without too much noise. I know there's plenty of regex ninjas around here, so hopefully someone can help me out. Currently I'm extracting all alphabetical sequences with '[a-z]+'. This is an okay approximation, but it drags a lot of rubbish out with it. Ideally I would like some regex (doesn't have to be pretty or efficient) that extracts all alphabetical sequences delimited by natural word separators (such as [/-_,.: ] etc.), and ignores any alphabetical sequences with illegal bounds. However I'd also be happy to just be able to get all alphabetical sequences that ARE NOT adjacent to a number. So for instance 'pie21' would NOT extract 'pie', but 'http://foo.com' would extract ['http', 'foo', 'com']. I tried lookahead and lookbehind assertions, but they were applied per-character (so for example re.findall('(?<!\d)[a-z]+(?!\d)', 'pie21') would return 'pi' when I want it to return nothing). I tried wrapping the alpha part as a term ((?:[a-z]+)) but it didn't help. More detail: The data is an email database, so it's mostly plain English with normal numbers, but occasionally there's rubbish strings like GIHQ4NWL0S5SCGBDD40ZXE5IDP13TYNEA and AC7A21C0 that I'd like to ignore completely. I'm assuming any alphabetical sequence with a number in it is rubbish.
@CODE:'[a-z]+' [/-_,.: ] 'pie21' 'pie' 'http://foo.com' ['http', 'foo', 'com'] lookahead lookbehind re.findall('(?<!\d)[a-z]+(?!\d)', 'pie21') 'pi' (?:[a-z]+) GIHQ4NWL0S5SCGBDD40ZXE5IDP13TYNEA AC7A21C0 \d

I can suppose that short strings (less than 128 chars for example) a stored directly in the record of the table and from this point of view the restriction will help to align fields in the record, larger strings are stored in the database "heap" and only the reference to this string is saved in the table record. Is it so? Is this requirement has a reasonable background? BTW, the DBMS is SQL Server 2008.

@CONTENT:I have an Android App, it works properly on android phones. I've downloaded Android 3.0 sdk and created a tablet emulator at 1024x600, using Android 3.0. When I test my app it runs in a small window centered at the top, using about 1/4 of the screen. What do I have to change in the app, xml files, or manifest to get it to use the whole tablet screen? As a side note I also have icons for drawable-ldpi, hdpi and mdpi. Thanks, Gerry

@TITLE:Script for separating implementation from headers in a .h file
@CONTENT:Sometimes, when working with small classes, it's a pain in the ass to separate the implementation in a .cpp file, so I put all the code in the header file (kids, don't do this). However, eventually these classes grow big time and I have to make the separation that I didn't do in the beginning. The fact is that this is a mechanic process that could be perfectly done by a script or something like that, and I'm sure someone out there has already thought of this. So, do you know of any script that could get a .h file, with all the function bodies implemented, and then return a stripped .h file and a nicely filled .cpp file?

@LINK:/questions/5328411/effective-use-of-c-iomanip-library
@TITLE:Effective use of C++ iomanip library
@CONTENT:I created a Vector class in C++ and it works great for my problems. I am now cleaning it up, and I ran into the following piece of code: std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream &output, const Vector &v){
  output<<"["
    <<std::setiosflags(std::ios::right | std::ios::scientific)
    <<std::setw(23)
    <<std::setprecision(16)
    <<v._x<<", "
    <<std::setiosflags(std::ios::right | std::ios::scientific)
    <<std::setw(23)
    <<std::setprecision(16)
    <<v._y<<", "
    <<std::setiosflags(std::ios::right | std::ios::scientific)
    <<std::setw(23)
    <<std::setprecision(16)
    <<v._z<<"]";
  return output;
} 
 The code allows to print a vector as std::cout<<v<<std::endl;. Each number has 23 spaces, of which 16 are the decimals. The text is right-aligned so that it will print:  1.123456123456e+01
-1.123456123456e+01
 Instead of 1.123456123456e+01
-1.123456123456e+01
 The code seems awfully repetitive. How can you "store" the format (all the setiosflags, setw and setprecision statements) such that you can say something like "print the characters in a standard way, but the numbers with this given format". Thank you! Edit As per Rob Adams' comment, I changed my ugly code (which, as pointed out by others, would mess up the precision for the "next guy") to a more succinct (and correct): std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream &output, const Vector &v){
  std::ios_base::fmtflags f = output.flags(std::ios::right | std::ios::scientific);
  std::streamsize p = output.precision(16);
  output<<"["
    <<std::setw(23)<<v._x<<", "
    <<std::setw(23)<<v._y<<", "
    <<std::setw(23)<<v._z
    <<"]";
  output.flags(f);
  output.precision(p);
  return output;
}

I know that emacs has a built in library for programming in emacs. However, I have researched and found it is feature less, i.e. no syntax highlighting, indention, etc. So I have download the emacs prackage Prolog.el. I have loaded this library using M-X Load-library. However, I am not sure what to do after that. How do I compile my prolog files? In the menu of the emacs IDE it has nothing for Prolog. Do I also need to download some interpretor or compiler for Prolog? Is there an emacs command for compiling? I normally use make in emacs when compiling c code. I did a yum search prolog and got these results, so with all these choices which one do I need?: gprolog.x86_64 : GNU Prolog is a free Prolog compiler
pl.x86_64 : SWI-Prolog - Edinburgh compatible Prolog compiler
pl-static.x86_64 : Static library for SWI Prolog
ppl-gprolog.x86_64 : The GNU Prolog interface of the Parma Polyhedra Library

ppl-yap.x86_64 : The YAP Prolog interface of the Parma Polyhedra Library
yap.i686 : High-performance Prolog Compiler
yap.x86_64 : High-performance Prolog Compiler
 Many thanks for any suggestions, ================== EDIT ===================== I have installed the following pl.x86_64 I have download the prolog.el and put it the following directory: ~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/prolog/prolog.el
 And I have configured my emacs with the following: ;;; Prolog mode
(setq load-path (cons "~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/prolog/prolog.el" load-path))
(autoload 'run-prolog "prolog" "Start a Prolog sub-process." t)
(autoload 'prolog-mode "prolog" "Major mode for editing prolog programs." t)
(setq prolog-system 'swi) ; prolog-system below for possible values
(setq auto-mode-alist (append '(("\\.pl$" . prolog-mode))
                              auto-mode-alist))
 So when I save a file as *.pl I get the prolog menu options. So I write some prolog code and from the prolog menu, I select Run interactive prolog session I get a second blank buffer open which says (Inferior Prolog:run Shell-Compile) However, I am not sure what I need to do at this stage. How do I compile and run the prolog files? Many thanks for any further support.

After overwriting my Makefile twice, attempting to follow the rather poorly-written README, I came up with the following Makefile that almost works:

 I'm guessing that something new (a 'Dir' object being where a POSIX path string is expected) in one of the packages is breaking the build process, but which one? There are just too many layers of cruft here for me to follow. For sure I could just keep trying older packages, particularly for swtoolkit and scons, but if anyone here has successfully compiled libjingle and could prod me in the right direction, I'd appreciate it.

 However, according to Instruments Memory Monitor, the memory usage goes up and up, and never comes down until the end of the loop. (It crashes.) If I replace the UIGraphicsBeginImageContext to UIGraphicsEndImageContext with UIImage *image = someotherimage; then the memory does not spike, but is allocated and reduces on every iteration of the loop, as I would expect, due to the Autorelease pool. (It doesn't crash) And if I just comment out the renderInContext line it works fine. (Doesn't crash) So it looks as if renderInContext is holding onto the image somehow - how can I get it to release it? Or any alternative suggestions please :)?

 From this answer here. If you mark your dependencies with [Inject] for your properties in your provider class, you can call kernel.Inject(MemberShip.Provider) - this will assign all dependencies to your properties. I do not understand this.

@TITLE:Getting a full copy of the WHOIS database
@CONTENT:I'm interested in getting access to a full WHOIS database in order to expand on a domain-profile project I'm working on. I know ARIN provides this database only to non-commercial researchers and every WHOIS provider I know of (including ARIN itself) has rate-limiting. I also know, however, some commercial services that already exist (like the registrant lookup section of domaintools.com, which can search for domains by registrant name) which are impossible unless the site has direct access to a cached copy of the WHOIS database. Any idea how they got ahold of their data?

@TITLE:How do I invoke the search dialog using onSearchRequested()
@CONTENT:I'm trying to implement the search dialog and I am unable to display the search from an Activity. I have my main activity defined in my manifest file, this activity shows the user a list of options they have to choose from. One of the options is a Search option.     <activity
        android:name=".MenuListActivity"
        android:label="@string/app_name">
        <intent-filter>
            <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
            <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />

 My Search activity is defined in my manifest file like so. <activity android:name=".SearchActivity"  
              android:launchMode="singleTop"

 Now my problem is when I call the onSearchRequested() from my MenuListActivity nothing happens. public void onItemClick(AdapterView<?> parent, View itemClicked, int position, long id) {  
          String strText = items[position];  

          if (strText.equalsIgnoreCase(getResources().getString(R.string.menu_item_browse))) {

@TITLE:Rendering a chain of images like a video in javascript
@CONTENT:I'm trying to synthesize a video using a stream of images in JavaScript. The problem is the "video" is either jerky, which was solved by using a buffer of sorts. However now the problem is that images are actually downloaded far faster than they are rendered. If you have a source of images that changes, like an IP camera you can try the example below. What I have noticed is that, the "video" still updates quite slowly, however while watching a packet sniffer I can see that the image is actually being fully retrieved far faster than it is being rendered. Here is the example: <HTML>

@LINK:/questions/4426581/python-eof-for-multi-byte-requests-of-file-read
@TITLE:Python EOF for multi byte requests of file.read()
@CONTENT:The Python docs on file.read() state that An empty string is returned when EOF is encountered immediately. The documentation further states: Note that this method may call the underlying C function fread() more than once in an effort to acquire as close to size bytes as possible. Also note that when in non-blocking mode, less data than was requested may be returned, even if no size parameter was given. I believe Guido has made his view on not adding f.eof() PERFECTLY CLEAR so need to use the Python way! What is not clear to ME, however, is if it is a definitive test that you have reached EOF if you receive less than the requested bytes from a read, but you did receive some. ie: with open(filename,'rb') as f:
    while True:
        s=f.read(size)
        l=len(s) 
        if l==0: 
            break     # it is clear that this is EOF...
        if l<size:
            break      # ? Is receiving less than the request EOF???
 Is it a potential error to break if you have received less than the bytes requested in a call to file.read(size)?

@TITLE:jQuery draggable revert based on condition
@CONTENT:I am having an issue related jQuery draggable and droppable. Here is description something what I want to do. First: I have two divs. One is <div id="selected"> and another is <div id="container">. "container" has 10 <li> which are draggable and droppable into "selected". Here is code: <div id="selected">
    <ul class="sortable-list">
    </ul>
</div>


<div id="container">
    <ul class="sortable-list">
             <li>1</li>
             <li>2</li>
             <li>....</li>
             <li>9</li>
             <li>10</li>
    </ul>
</div>
 Second: I want to allow any 5 <li>s from "container" to "selected" div. If someone tries to add 6th <li>, then it must not allow user to it. That is the 6th <li> that is going to be inserted into "selected" must be reverted using jQuery draggable option revert. i.e. $("#container li").draggable({ revert: true }); Here is javascript code for that. $(document).ready(function(){

    var total = 0;
    $("#selected").droppable({
        drop: function() {
                total = $("#selected li").length;
                //alert(total);
                if (total >= 5) {
                    $("#container li").draggable({ revert: true });
                } else {
                            // below code is not working
                    $("#container li").draggable({ revert: false }); // this is making whole feature weird. I can drag all the <li> anywhere
                }
            }
    });
});
 This is working fine. Third: But when I drag an <li> from "selected" to "container", the "selected" div will have only 4 <li>s. So in this situation, later on user should be able to add another <li> into "selected" div from "container" div. But unfortunately it is not working. All the <li>s I try to drag and drop into "selected" are being reverted due to if (total >= 5 ) condition. Can anyone help me to solve this out using draggable revert option? Please...
@CODE:<div id="selected"> <div id="container"> <li> <div id="selected">
    <ul class="sortable-list">
    </ul>
</div>


<div id="container">
    <ul class="sortable-list">
             <li>1</li>
             <li>2</li>
             <li>....</li>
             <li>9</li>
             <li>10</li>

 (snipped) I think what is happening is that when .Net attempts to derserialize the xml, it hits the first line which contains the "xmlns:ast" and complaints about it. As I understand it, .Net will try to map attributes to a public property in the target class (and it wont find one called xmlns. Or there is something wrong with how I am handling the name spaces. My deserialization code looks as follows:     XmlDocument _Doc = new XmlDocument();
    _Doc.Load(@"C:\inputfile.xml");

    XmlSerializer _XMLSer = new XmlSerializer(typeof(ListeAvisRemboursements));
    ListeAvisRemboursements _X = (ListeAvisRemboursements)_XMLSer.Deserialize(new StringReader(_Doc.OuterXml));
 I have also tried various combinations of adding a namespace manager to the XML document.. XmlNamespaceManager _Ns = new XmlNamespaceManager(_Doc.NameTable);
_Ns.AddNamespace("ast", "xml.AAAAAAA.com/commerce/apres-vente_technique/assistance");
 I understand there is a way I can use this to tell .Net what namespaces to accept. Would be greatful for some help iwth this problem. --- Updated at request with class snippet (sorry should have included before) this was created with xsd.exe ---  /// <remarks/>

@TITLE:How do automatic @synthesized ivars affect the *real* sizeof(MyClass)?
@CONTENT:If I include some automatic properties like this: @property (nonatomic, readonly) NSInteger           test1;
@property (nonatomic, readonly) NSInteger           test2;
@property (nonatomic, readonly) NSInteger           test3;
@property (nonatomic, readonly) NSInteger           test4;
 But I DON'T declare any iVars for them, I can @synthesize them in the .m file like this: @synthesize test1;
@synthesize test2;
@synthesize test3;
@synthesize test4;
 and this works no problem, the compiler automatically adds the iVars - a sizeof(MyClass) shows that my class is (as you might expect) 16 bytes larger than without these properties declared and synthesized. However, if I don't synthesize them and I implement them like this: - (NSInteger)test1
{
    return 0;
}
- (NSInteger)test2
{
    return 0;
}
- (NSInteger)test3
{
    return 0;
}
- (NSInteger)test4
{
    return 0;
}
 then my class is back to its original size. This is determined from a sizeof WITHIN the .m file for MyClass - so the compiler knows at this stage whether the variables were synthesized or implemented. However, other classes do not know this just from the header file, sizeof(MyClass) shows the size WITHOUT the additional (automatic) iVars regardless of whether they are synthesized or not. This seems totally messed up to me, that sizeof can return a different value. How can the compiler behave correctly when subclassing and when using the dereference+offset (->) operator on public iVars of a subclass if it can't be sure of the class size?
@CODE:@property (nonatomic, readonly) NSInteger           test1;

@TITLE:Codeigniter Insert Multiple Rows in SQL
@CONTENT:I am fresh to Codeigniter. I have a form which looks something like this. <tr>

<td><input type="text" name="Address[0]"  value=""><br></td>

 There may be from 0 to n rows, usually 5 to 10 rows. How do I insert them in SQL? Is this possible with Codeigniter or should I use a native PHP script? $name=$_POST['Name'];
$address=$_POST['Address'];
$age=$_POST['Age'];
$email=$_POST['Email'];
$count = count($_POST['Name']);



for($i=0; $i<$count; $i++) {
$data = array(

  $this->db->insert('mytable', $data);

 I did this. It works. But the solution seems inelegant. kevtrout's answer looks better but is currently throwing a lot of errors. Is there any way to insert all data at one go?

@TITLE:How to update a div with Ajax.BeginForm AND execute a javascript function?
@CONTENT:I am updating a div with a partial view by using something like this: <% using (Ajax.BeginForm("Action", "Controller",

               new AjaxOptions

               }))
   {  %>
 and its working fine, the returned view gets appened to the div, however I now need to execute a javascript when the post is successful, so I thought: "easy, just add OnSuccess = "MyJsFunc()" " to the AjaxOptions, but after doing this, it stopped working! now the page is refreshed and only the returned partial view is rendered :(, I even tried with a simple Alert("Hi") and its nor working.. how can I get this to work? (by the way I think this can be a dup of http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1994754/execute-javascript-after-loading-a-mvc-page-using-ajax-beginrouteform but that question got abandoned with no answer)

@TITLE:Win32 SetForegroundWindow unreliable
@CONTENT:Hey guys, I have a rather complex series of applications which depend on the ability to switch applications in the foreground. My problem is, every 5 or 6 times of switching the applications in the foreground, it simply fails to bring the application forward. GetLastError does not report any issues. Often times I see the correct application flash in the foreground for a moment then the previous application is visible. I have a Manager application which I have source for, it spawns and controls about 4 applications which I do not have source for. one of the applications it spawns/controls is also a manager which spawns/controls about 5 applications. This is a sort of kiosk design so the user wont even have a keyboard or mouse, just a touch screen. I have tried every combination of the Win32 calls to control them I am just out of ideas. My first attempt was: SetWindowPos(hApp, HWND_TOPMOST, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, SWP_NOMOVE | SWP_NOSIZE);
SetWindowPos(hApp, HWND_NOTOPMOST, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, SWP_NOMOVE | SWP_NOSIZE);
 My second attempt was: SetForegroundWindow(hApp);
SetActiveWindow(hApp);
SetFocus(hApp);
 my third attempt: DWORD dwThreadID = GetWindowThreadProcessId(hApp, NULL); AttachThreadInput( dwThreadID, GetCurrentThreadId(), true); SetForegroundWindow(hApp);
SetActiveWindow(hApp);
SetFocus(hApp);

AttachThreadInput( dwThreadID, GetCurrentThreadId(), false);
 my forth attempt: DWORD dwThreadID = GetWindowThreadProcessId(hApp, NULL);
AttachThreadInput( dwThreadID, GetCurrentThreadId(), true);

SetWindowPos(hApp, HWND_TOPMOST, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, SWP_NOMOVE | SWP_NOSIZE);
SetWindowPos(hApp, HWND_NOTOPMOST, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, SWP_NOMOVE | SWP_NOSIZE);

SetForegroundWindow(hApp);
SetActiveWindow(hApp);
SetFocus(hApp);

 AttachThreadInput( dwThreadID, GetCurrentThreadId(), false);
 I feel like I am missing an important gotcha when it comes to window switching. I know that only the foreground process can switch windows around but as my main Manager program is spawning and starting all the other processes which I need to control, I feel like it should be capable of moving these windows around. I am really under the gun to finish this (up all night all week), any suggestions or advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you!

@TITLE:Java real time strategy game development
@CONTENT:I'm coming to the end of my first year of CS and I thought a great way to consolidate all the things I've learnt this year would be a personal game project. I would like to implement a 2D based rts, I'm thinking along the lines of starcraft I, warcraft II or even command and conquer. I will have about 3 months without interruptions to implement the game. So to anyone experienced with java game programming, I have a few questions: Is it realistic to design a 2D rts engine from scratch in 3 months? If so what are some good books/resources to get started? Would it be better to modify some existing project? I would think the experience of having to work with a lot of someone else's code would be good since our exposure to such topics in an undergrad cs degree seems very rare, if non-existent. Are there any decent open source 2d rts projects that anyone could recommend? I've looked through a few but most seem to be written in c/c++ My humble thanks Edit: Thanks for the quick responses, I think that perhaps it was a bad idea to post this in a rush since I think I misrepresented what I want to do. When I say "along the lines of warcraft II etc" I mean more like that style of rts using sprites. I don't intend to implement a game nearly that complex, more like just a basic prototype. My goal would be some thing more like a flat textured map with some basic obstacles like trees, a single unit producing structure like a barracks. I'd like to have the units to have health bars, be able to move and attack and die (and possible morph into another unit). Far off goals would be to implement some basic pathing using a modified version of the dijkstra shortest path algorithm, ranged units with missle attack, etc. I don't plan to implement any opponents or ai or networking or anything like that.

@TITLE:Copy or reference semantics of boost::spirit's rule<>?
@CONTENT:I am trying to write a shell language parser in Boost.Spirit. However, I am unclear about some basic issues regarding semantics of rules. Looking at the documentation, there are members r.alias() and r.copy() of rule. IIUC, these members should return a reference to the rule and a copy of the rule's contents, respectively. However, it is not clearly specified what happens when I just use the rule in a definition of another rule. From my experiments, I found mutually recursive rules can be defined by: rule<Iter> r1, r2;
r1 = ... >> r2 >> ...;
r2 = ... >> r1 >> ...;
 which suggests the rules are taken by reference inside parser expressions. The problem is, what does it do when the variable goes out of scope, eg: rule<Iter> r1;
{ 
  rule<Iter> r2;
  r1 = ... >> r2 >> ...;
  r2 = ... >> r1 >> ...;
}
... // use r1
 On the same note, would assigning to a rule from a parsing expression containing a rvalue of type rule work (r.copy() would be a rvalue of type rule too, isn't it)? eg. rule<Iter> f() { return char_('a') << char_('b'); }
rule<Iter> r1 = ... << f();
 Can anybody enlighten me on the detailed semantics of rule's copies and references, and possibly correct any misconceptions in this post?
@CODE:rule r.alias() r.copy() rule rule<Iter> r1, r2;
r1 = ... >> r2 >> ...;
r2 = ... >> r1 >> ...; rule<Iter> r1;
{ 
  rule<Iter> r2;
  r1 = ... >> r2 >> ...;
  r2 = ... >> r1 >> ...;
}
... // use r1 r.copy() rule rule<Iter> f() { return char_('a') << char_('b'); }
rule<Iter> r1 = ... << f(); rule

@TITLE:How do I implement a callback in C++?
@CONTENT:I want to implement a class in c++ that has a callback. So I think I need a method that has 2 arguments: the target object. (let's say *myObj) the pointer to a member function of the target object. (so i can do *myObj->memberFunc(); ) The conditions are: myObj can be from any class. the member function that is gonna be the callback function is non-static. I've been reading about this but it seems like I need to know the class of myObj before hand. But I am not sure how to do it. How can I handle this? Is this possible in C++? This is something I have in mind but is surely incorrect. class MyClassWithCallback{
public
    void *targetObj;
    void (*callback)(int number);
    void setCallback(void *myObj, void(*callbackPtr)(int number)){
        targetObj = myObj;
        callback = callbackPtr;
    };
    void callCallback(int a){
        (myObj)->ptr(a);
    };
};
class Target{
public
    int res;
    void doSomething(int a){//so something here. This is gonna be the callback function};        
};

int main(){
    Target myTarget;
    MyClassWithCallback myCaller;
    myCaller.setCallback((void *)&myTarget, &doSomething);
 } I appreciate any help. Thank you. UPDATE Most of you said Observing and Delegation, well that's i exactly what i am looking for, I am kind of a Objective-C/Cocoa minded guy. My current implementation is using interfaces with virtual functions. Is just I thought it would be "smarter" to just pass the object and a member function pointer (like boost!) instead of defining an Interface. But It seems that everybody agrees that Interfaces are the easiest way right? Boost seems to be a good idea, (assuming is installed)

    void *targetObj;

@LINK:/questions/3289321/c-sharp-capturing-windows-messages-from-a-specific-application
@TITLE:C# - Capturing Windows Messages from a specific application
@CONTENT:I'm writing a C# application which needs to intercept Window Messages that another applications is sending out. The company who wrote the application I'm monitoring sent me some example code, however it's in C++ which I don't really know. In the C++ example code I've got they use the following code:  UINT uMsg = RegisterWindowMessage(SHOCK_MESSAGE_BROADCAST);
 ON_REGISTERED_MESSAGE(WM_SHOCK_BROADCAST_MESSAGE, OnShockStatusMessage)
 LRESULT OnShockStatusMessage(WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam);
 As I understand it this retrieves an Id from Windows for the specific message we want to listen for. Then we're asking C++ to call OnShockStatusMessage whenever an message matching the Id is intercepted. After a bit of research I've put together the following in C# [DllImport("user32.dll", SetLastError = true)]
public static extern IntPtr FindWindow(string lpClassName, string lpWindowName);

[DllImport("user32.dll", SetLastError = true, CharSet = CharSet.Auto)]
static extern uint RegisterWindowMessage(string lpString);

private IntPtr _hWnd; // APS-50 class reference
private List<IntPtr> _windowsMessages = new List<IntPtr>(); // APS-50 messages

private const string _className = "www.AuPix.com/SHOCK/MessageWindowClass";

// Windows Messages events
private const string _messageBroadcast = "www.AuPix.com/SHOCK/BROADCAST";
private const string _messageCallEvents = "www.AuPix.com/SHOCK/CallEvents";
private const string _messageRegistrationEvents = "www.AuPix.com/SHOCK/RegistrationEvents";
private const string _messageActions = "www.AuPix.com/SHOCK/Actions";

private void DemoProblem()
{
    // Find hidden window handle
    _hWnd = FindWindow(_className, null);

    // Register for events
    _windowsMessages.Add( new IntPtr( RegisterWindowMessage( _messageActions ) ) );
    _windowsMessages.Add( new IntPtr( RegisterWindowMessage( _messageBroadcast ) ) );
    _windowsMessages.Add( new IntPtr( RegisterWindowMessage( _messageCallEvents ) ) );
    _windowsMessages.Add( new IntPtr( RegisterWindowMessage( _messageRegistrationEvents ) ) );
}

protected override void WndProc(ref Message m)
{
    base.WndProc(ref m);

    // Are they registered Windows Messages for the APS-50 application?
    foreach (IntPtr message in _windowsMessages)
    {
        if ((IntPtr)m.Msg == message)
        {
            Debug.WriteLine("Message from specified application found!");
        }
    }

    // Are they coming from the APS-50 application?
    if ( m.HWnd == shock.WindowsHandle)
    {
        Debug.WriteLine("Message from specified application found!");
    }

}
 As I understand this should do the same basic thing, in that it: Finds the application I wish to monitor Registers the Window Messages I wish to intercept Watches for all Window Messages - then strips out the ones I need However in my override of the WndProc() method neither of my checks intercept any of the specific messages or any message from the application I'm monitoring. If I Debug.WriteLine for all messages that come through it, I can see that it's monitoring them. However it never filters out the messages that I want. By running the example monitoring application written in C++ I can see that Window Messages are being sent and picked up - it's just my C# implemention doesn't do the same.
@CODE:UINT uMsg = RegisterWindowMessage(SHOCK_MESSAGE_BROADCAST);
 ON_REGISTERED_MESSAGE(WM_SHOCK_BROADCAST_MESSAGE, OnShockStatusMessage)

@TITLE:How to use a custom __init__ of an app engine Python model class properly?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to implement a delayed blog post deletion scheme. So instead of an annoying Are you sure?, you get a 2 minute time frame to cancel deletion. I want to track What will be deleted When with a db.Model class (DeleteQueueItem), as I found no way to delete a task from the queue and suspect I can query what's there. Creating a DeleteQueueItem entity should automatically set a delete_when property and add a task to the queue. I use the relative path of blog posts as their key_name and want to use that as key_name here, too. This led me to a custom init: class DeleteQueueItem(db.Model):
    """Model to keep track of items that will be deleted via task queue."""

    # URL path to the blog post is handled as key_name
    delete_when = db.DateTimeProperty()

    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        delay = 120  # Seconds
        t = datetime.timedelta(seconds=delay)
        deadline = datetime.datetime.now() - t
        key_name = kwargs.get('key_name')

        db.Model.__init__(self, **kwargs)
        self.delete_when = deadline

        taskqueue.add(url='/admin/task/delete_page', 
                      countdown=delay,
                      params={'path': key_name})
 This seems to work, until I try to delete the entity: fetched_item = models.DeleteQueueItem.get_by_key_name(path)
 This fails with: TypeError: __init__() takes exactly 1 non-keyword argument (2 given)
 What am I doing wrong?

@CONTENT:In visual studio, when you add a reference there is a flag in the properties called, "Copy Local". There is some confusion about what this actually does and when. It seems easy to understand but my question is when does it copy local. Is it when the reference is added or does it copy the dll locally when the project is built. The reason for this question is we have created a asp.net template file that refences a dll that is on all of our devs local workstations in exactly the same place. We thought that by setting the flag to "Copy Local", this would reference the location where the dll lives but when we use the template, the reference is broken and needs to be re-added. Can anyone shed some light on this?

 SomeField is located on the DataSource of the DetailsView that serves as the container for the textbox. Alternatively I could do this from code-behind (using the textbox's OnDataBinding event): protected void SomeField_OnDataBinding(object sender, EventArgs e)

@TITLE:Find all cycles in graph, redux
@CONTENT:I know there are a quite some answers existing on this question. However, I found none of them really bringing it to the point. Some argue that a cycle is (almost) the same as a strongly connected components (s. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/546655/finding-all-cycles-in-graph/549402#549402) , so one could use algorithms designed for that goal. Some argue that finding a cycle can be done via DFS and checking for back-edges (s. boost graph documentation on file dependencies). I now would like to have some suggestions on whether all cycles in a graph can be detected via DFS and checking for back-edges? http://www.me.utexas.edu/~bard/IP/Handouts/cycles.pdf (found here on S.O.) states one methode based on cycle bases. Me personally, I don't find it very intuitive so I'm looking for a different solution. EDIT: My initial opinion was apparently wrong. S. next answer by "Moron". Initial opinion: My opinion is that it indeed could work that way as DFS-VISIT (s. pseudocode of DFS) freshly enters each node that was not yet visited. In that sense, each vertex exhibits a potential start of a cycle. Additionally, as DFS visits each edge once, each edge leading to the starting point of a cycle is also covered. Thus, by using DFS and back-edge checking it should indeed be possible to detect all cycles in a graph. Note that, if cycles with different numbers of participant nodes exist (e.g. triangles, rectangles etc.), additional work has to be done to discriminate the acutal "shape" of each cycle.

@CONTENT:I have a script that does various things and access paramenters using sys.argv but when the script gets to the unittest part of the code it says there is no module for this. The script that I have is: class MyScript():

 Say I enter ./script.py Hello in the command line. The error I get is: AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'Hello'
 If I remove the unittest module it works. Also if I remove the testrunner log and leave it at: unittest.main(defaultTest='Run.suite')
 This still doesn't work. Can anyone help. Thanks I tried this hack but it still tries to read the sys.argv. project = sys.argv[4:]
sys.argv = sys.argv[0:4]
 I have tried this with just argv but it still tires to read the extra parameters.

@CONTENT:Take facebook's private messaging system where you have to keep track of sender and receiver along w/ the message content. If I were using MySQL I would have multiple tables, but with MongoDB I'll try to avoid all that. I'm trying to come up with a "good" schema that can scale and is easy to maintain. If I were using mysql, I would have a separate table to reference the user and and message. See below ... profiles table user_id
first_name
last_name
 message table message_id
message_body
time_stamp
 user_message_ref table user_id (FK)
message_id (FK)
is_sender (boolean)
 With the schema listed above, I can query for any messages that "Bob" may have regardless if he's the recipient or sender. Now how to turn that into a schema that works with MongoDB. I'm thinking I'll have a separate collection to hold the messages. Problem is, how can I differentiate between the sender and the recipient? If Bob logs in, what do I query against? Depending on whether Bob initiated the email, I don't want to have to query against "sender" and "receiver" just to see if the message belongs to the user. I hit up MongoDB's message group and came away with something that may work. Each message would be treated as a "blog" post. When a message is created, add the two users (doesn't matter who sender/receiver is initially) into an array. Each response after that would be treated as a comment, which would be inserted into an array. MESSAGES {
    "_id" : <objectID>,
    "users" : ["bob", "amy"],
    "user_msgs" :
        [
            { 
                "is_sender" : "bob",
                "msg_body" : "Hi Amy, how are you?!",
                "timestamp" : <generated by Mongo>
            }
            { 
                "is_sender" : "amy",
                "msg_body" : "Bob, long time no see, how is the family?!",
                "timestamp" : <generated by Mongo>
            }
        ]
}
 This way I can query for messages that involves "Bob," and loop through the "user_msgs" array. I'll be able to tell who the sender is and sort by the timestamp.
@CODE:user_id
first_name
last_name message_id
message_body
time_stamp user_id (FK)
message_id (FK)
is_sender (boolean) {
    "_id" : <objectID>,
    "users" : ["bob", "amy"],
    "user_msgs" :
        [
            { 
                "is_sender" : "bob",
                "msg_body" : "Hi Amy, how are you?!",
                "timestamp" : <generated by Mongo>
            }
            { 
                "is_sender" : "amy",
                "msg_body" : "Bob, long time no see, how is the family?!",
                "timestamp" : <generated by Mongo>
            }
        ]
}

@TITLE:How to build a LINQ query from text at runtime?
@CONTENT:I have a class A {
   public int X;
   public double Y;
   public string Z;
   // and more fields/properties ...
};
 and a List<A> data and can build a linq query like e.g. var q = from a in data where a.X > 20 select new {a.Y, a.Z};
 Then dataGridView1.DataSource = q.ToList(); displays the selection in my DataGridView. Now the question, is it possible to build the query from a text the user has entered at runtime? Like var q = QueryFromText("from a in data where a.X > 20 select new {a.Y, a.Z}");
 The point being, that the user (having programming skills) can dynamically and freely select the displayed data.
@CODE:class A {
   public int X;
   public double Y;
   public string Z;
   // and more fields/properties ...
}; List<A> data var q = from a in data where a.X > 20 select new {a.Y, a.Z}; dataGridView1.DataSource = q.ToList(); var q = QueryFromText("from a in data where a.X > 20 select new {a.Y, a.Z}");

@CONTENT:Possible Duplicate: javascript: pause setTimeout(); Im using jQuery and working on a notification system for my site. The notifications automatically fadeout using the setTimeout function. How can i stop the timer of the setTimeout call? For example i would like to pause the setTimeout call while the mouse is over the notification and continue the count down mouseout... I googled "pause setTimeout" with no luck. Im currently clearing the setTimeout call with clearTimeout and at same time fading out the notification on mouseout but it would be nice to have that pause effect. Any ideas?

@TITLE:Sending out 20,000+ emails with asp.net
@CONTENT:I am writing an application that will need to send a massive amount of emails to our students who will be selected from our database (each email will be personalized to the extent that will include their name, course of study etc...so needs to be sent one at a time). I could do this looping over an SmtpClient, but I'm afraid that with the numbers I'm trying to send, I'll ultimately run into timeout issues or my thread being killed because of lack of machine resources. At this point I'm just looking for suggestions of a better way to handle this, or if looping over SmtpClient is an ok solution, how I should go about handling it to prevent what I posted above. Would a web service be a better alternative? Please advise, TIA

@TITLE:Multiple key/value pairs in HTTP POST where key is the same name
@CONTENT:I'm working on an API that accepts data from remote clients, some of which where the key in an HTTP POST almost functions as an array. In english what this means is say I have a resource on my server called "class". A class in this sense, is the type a student sits in and a teacher educates in. When the user submits an HTTP POST to create a new class for their application, a lot of the key value pairs look like: student_name: Bob Smith student_name: Jane Smith student_name: Chris Smith What's the best way to handle this on both the client side (let's say the client is cURL or ActiveResource, whatever..) and what's a decent way of handling this on the server-side if my server is a Ruby on Rails app? Need a way to allow for multiple keys with the same name and without any namespace clashing or loss of data. My requirement has to be that the POST data is urlencoded key/value pairs.

@LINK:/questions/2596893/regex-to-match-words-and-those-with-an-apostrophe
@TITLE:Regex to match words and those with an apostrophe
@CONTENT:Update: As per comments regarding the ambiguity of my question, I've increased the detail in the question. (Terminology: by words I am refering to any succession of alphanumerical characters.) I'm looking for a regex to match the following, verbatim: Words. Words with one apostrophe at the beginning. Words with any number of non-contiguous apostrophe throughout the middle. Words with one apostrophe at the end. I would like to match the following, however not verbatim, rather, removing the apostrophes: Words with an apostrophe at the beginning and at the end would be matched to the word, without the apostrophes. So 'foo' would be matched to foo. Words with more than one contiguous apostrophe in the middle would be resolved to two different words: the fragment before the contiguous apostrophes and the fragment after the contiguous apostrophes. So, foo''bar would be matched to foo and bar. Words with more than one contiguous apostrophe at the beginning or at the end would be matched to the word, without the apostrophes. So, ''foo would be matched to foo and ''foo'' to foo. Examples These would be matched verbatim: 'bout it's persons' But these would be ignored: ' '' And, for 'open', open would be matched.
@CODE:'foo' foo foo''bar foo bar ''foo foo ''foo'' foo 'bout it's persons' ' '' 'open' open 'foo' ''foo bar'' foo'b foo''bar 'foo''bar' 'foo'bar'zim

@TITLE:Redirect output from sed 's/c/d/' myFile to myFile
@CONTENT:I am using sed in a script to do a replace and I want to have the replaced file overwrite the file. Normally I think that you would use this: % sed -i 's/cat/dog/' manipulate
sed: illegal option -- i
 However as you can see my sed does not have that command. I tried this: % sed 's/cat/dog/' manipulate > manipulate
 But this just turns manipulate into an empty file (makes sense). This works: % sed 's/cat/dog/' manipulate > tmp; mv tmp manipulate
 But I was wondering if there was a standard way to redirect output into the same file that input was taken from.
@CODE:% sed -i 's/cat/dog/' manipulate
sed: illegal option -- i % sed 's/cat/dog/' manipulate > manipulate % sed 's/cat/dog/' manipulate > tmp; mv tmp manipulate sponge
