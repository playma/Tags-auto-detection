@TITLE:Pass touches to the view under
@CONTENT:In my app I have a fragment on top of the activity. The fragment is filling the whole screen. Part of the fragment is a transparent View and you can see the views under (that belong to the activity). Is there a way to transfer the touch events to the views that are under the transparent View of the fragment? Thanks!

@TITLE:How to use adb tcpip without USB debugging enabled?
@CONTENT:I've read quite a few posts already on adb and tcpip mode and I can create a wireless adb connection, but only when USB debugging is on. The way I'm using it is like so: USB debugging is enabled call adb tcpip on the computer (switches from usb to tcpip mode with default port 5555) call adb connect PHONE_IP and a connection is made The above works with or without the usb cable being connected, but only when the USB debugging option is ticked in Developer Options on the Android device. As soon as I untick the option, the tcp connection is lost and cannot be re-established until re-enabling the USB debugging option. The problem is I'm getting started with a IOIO OTG device and I need to disable USB debugging to use the IOIO as an Accessory Device. It would be really useful if I can use the IOIO and debug with adb at the same time. I'm using Android 4.1.2 (API 16) on the device. I can use two devices, both using the same OS version, one rooted, one un-rooted. Is it possible to use adb in tcpip mode without USB debugging enabled ? If so, how ?

@LINK:/questions/19442401/eclipse-project-properties-backslash-paths-considered-harmful
@TITLE:Eclipse project.properties backslash paths considered harmful
@CONTENT:I am working in a team that is developing Android software. Some team members use Windows, some use Macs, and I have been known to use Linux. Everyone uses Eclipse. Eclipse writes a file called project.properties; here's an example. The important part is the last three lines, the android library reference paths. # This file is automatically generated by Android Tools.
# Do not modify this file -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE ERASED!
#
# This file must be checked in Version Control Systems.
#
# To customize properties used by the Ant build system edit
# "ant.properties", and override values to adapt the script to your
# project structure.
#

#proguard.config=${sdk.dir}/tools/proguard/proguard-android.txt:proguard-project.txt

# Project target.
target=android-17
android.library.reference.1=../private-code/lib/SomeLibrary
android.library.reference.2=../google-play-services_lib
android.library.reference.3=../FacebookSDK
 The above is what the file looks like when Eclipse on Mac or Linux writes it. When Eclipse on Windows writes it, the library reference lines are written with backslashes. Of course on Windows, backslashes are acceptable path separators. But on Mac and Linux such paths do not work. The thing is, on Windows, forward slashes work perfectly well. So, our policy now is always to commit the file with forward slashes, so that it will work for everyone. But this is a pain for our Windows users, and it's a pain for the rest of us when the Windows users make a mistake, so I'm looking for a technical solution. I have two ideas: Find a setting somewhere in Eclipse on Windows, telling it to use forward slashes when saving paths in files like project.properties. (Why the heck isn't that the default?!?) We use Mercurial, so: install some sort of "hooks" that will solve the problem. Install a commit hook on the Windows computers, so that the file is committed into the repository with the backslashes replaced by forward slashes. Install a pull hook on the Mac and Linux computers; so if the file gets committed with backslashes, they get fixed up by the time the files are written. The commit hook seems cleaner, so if both are available I'd take a commit hook over a pull hook. I found a Mercurial extension that edits tabs to spaces, which is at least sort of similar to what I want. It's complex enough that I'm a bit leery of trying to modify it into what I need. http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/CheckFilesExtension The other strategy is to add a hook that detects backslashes in the paths, and simply aborts the commit, forcing the Windows user to fix the file by hand before committing. That would be better than nothing.

@TITLE:Robolectric buildActivity() with Mockito spy?
@CONTENT:It seems to me that building an Activity unit test with Robolectric's lifecycle utilities (starting with Robolectric.buildActivity()) and spying on the same Activity with a Mockito spy are mutually exclusive. Because buildActivity() controls the construction of the Activity object, the only place to add a spy for the Activity is after calling buildActivity(). However, the spy doesn't function properly when it's added after the fact. This is especially true when spying for side effects of ActivityController lifecycle methods such as create(), start() and resume(). I assume this is because the ActivityController holds a reference to the "real" Activity object and not the spy that was added later. So is there any way to spy an Activity that's being unit tested with Robolectric, such that the spy works properly when calling the lifecycle methods via Robolectric's ActivityController?

The problem is 100% reproduceable: Open workbook with ActiveX objects in spreadsheet while using a docking station Disconnect machine from docking station, triggering a resolution change (there are other causes too, mine is with a docking station, it seems changing resolution causes this) Click an ActiveX control - they immediately resize and the font changes size. The fontsize change is NOT a function of the .Font.Size parameter but something which cannot be changed after the problem occurs, other than continually increasing the fontsize The only seemingly authoritative solution involves a MS patch (it was a "hotfix" several years ago, though, so it doesn't seem practical for full deployment) and registry edits, which is not practical for my use case. I am looking for a way to either: Prevent this change from occuring Find the best work around There is a lack of authoritative information on this problem online.

@TITLE:Something wrong with javascript unsigned shift operator on iPad?
@CONTENT:I accidentally ran into what appears to be a very strange bug in Safari's javascript engine on iPad. The unsigned shift operator >>> is supposed to bitwise right-shift a number. I experienced some errors in a script that worked fine on other platforms, stripped it down and ended up with this: <html><head><script type='text/javascript'>

var one = 1;

function Zero()
{
    return one*0;
}

function Strange()
{
     return one = (Zero()+1) >>> 0;

var s = 'A bunch of ones: '; // except on iPad :(

{
     s += Strange()+' ';
}
document.write(s);

</script></head><body></body></html>
 Live demo Strangely enough, it correctly generates a bunch of ones, but at a certain point, something breaks and it only outputs zeroes from then on. Obviously the >>> 0 is meaningless here (a shift over zero places typically does nothing, although it could have forced an integer to become unsigned if javascript made that distinction). It's just to demonstrate the problem, if you omit the >>> 0 it doesn't show up. In my actual situation there were different numbers and more complex expressions involved, but the same thing happened: everything works until a number of iterations, then something 'breaks' and variables suddenly become and remain zero, even after subsequent calculations that really ought to make them non-zero. Works fine on Android and PC browsers. Strange huh?

An "original sequence of 3 in the new randomized array" is not desired. Is there anyway to improve this so that: An item is never in its original position A stack of 3 sequential items (from the original sequence is never allowed) (or any number of sequential original items) It could be 6 items or 10 items in the array, but what I'm working with currently is just 4 items.

@LINK:/questions/19115056/how-to-define-bold-in-an-android-selector
@TITLE:How to define bold in an Android selector?
@CONTENT:In my Android app I've got a couple radion buttons which should get a different color and become bold upon selection. I managed to get the different color by defining a radio_pick_color.xml file in drawable: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<selector xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
     <!-- checked -->
     <item android:state_checked="true"
           android:color="#00FF15" /> 
     <!-- default -->
     <item android:color="#4000FF" /> 
</selector>
 and referencing this file in my main.xml file: android:textColor="@drawable/radio_picker_color"
 I now want to do the same for having the text bold. So I made another file called radio_picker_style.xml in which I wanted to define the style like this: <item android:state_checked="true"
       android:style="bold" /> 
 Unfortunately eclipse complaints that no resource identifier can be found for attribute 'style' in package 'android'. I also tried with android:textStyle, but from within a selector item it also doesn't know the android:textStyle attribute. Does anybody know how I can get the selected radio button in bold? ==EDIT== The relevant part of my main.xml file: <RadioGroup
    android:id="@+id/radioGroup2"
    android:layout_width="fill_parent"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:orientation="horizontal" >

    <RadioButton
        android:id="@+id/option_1"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:checked="true"
        android:text="@string/option_1"
        android:textColor="@drawable/radio_picker_color"
        />

    <RadioButton
        android:id="@+id/option_2"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:text="@string/option_2" 
        android:textColor="@drawable/radio_picker_color"
        />
</RadioGroup>
 And the radio_picker_style.xml which I tried to put in drawable folder, but which says "Attribute is missing the Android namespace prefix": <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<style name="mystyle">  
    <item name="android:textColor">#ffffff</item>

@LINK:/questions/19010971/compatible-types-vs-strict-aliasing-rules
@TITLE:compatible types vs. strict aliasing rules
@CONTENT:It is a common strategy in C to cast one type to another type, relying on the fact that the layout of a C struct has certain guarantees. Libraries such as GLib rely on this to implement object-oriented like inheritance. Basically: struct Base
{
  int x;
  int y;
};

struct Derived
{
  struct Base b;
  int z;
};
 This enables a Base* pointer to be assigned to the address of a Derived object. But I'm also aware of the "strict aliasing" rule, which is the implicit assumption by the compiler that different-type pointers can't point to the same address. (This enables the compiler to perform certain optimizations.) So, how are these two things reconciled? Many C libraries, include Glib, CPython, etc., use the above strategy to cast between types. Are they all simply compiling with flags like no-strict-aliasing?
@CODE:struct Base
{
  int x;
  int y;

@TITLE:ios7 keyboard, when it opens shrinks web-app
@CONTENT:I have a web-app for iPad. The app uses the iPad keyboard, before when opening the keyboard it would cover the app, now with ios7 the app gets shrinked to the remaining space after the keyboard appears. Is it possible to change this in JavaScript, and keep the old behavior? EDIT: I just noticed that if I open the app on safari it works just like before, the problem appears when I add the app to the main screen. EDIT: I almost solved this, but then I got some other problems. First I added this height=device-height to the meta tag I was using: <meta name = "viewport" content = "user-scalable=no, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, height=device-height">
 But then a small part of my app (the size of the iPad top bar) would be hidden at the bottom. So I did this: $("#my_app").css("height",window.innerHeight);
 When I opened the app again it was perfect. But when I open the keyboard, it moves up and wont come down when I close the keyboard. So now at the bottom of the iPad is a black line, and the app is a little bit hidden under the top bar of the iPad. Can any one help with this?

@TITLE:Data too long for column - why?
@CONTENT:I've written a MySQL script to create a database for hypothetical hospital records and populate it with data. One of the tables, Department, has a column named Description, which is declared as type varchar(200). When executing the INSERT command for Description I get an error 1406: Data too long for column 'Description' at row 1. All the strings I'm inserting are less than 150 characters. Here's the declaration: CREATE TABLE Department( ... Description varchar(200) ...); And here's the insertion command: INSERT INTO Department VALUES (..., 'There is some text here',...), (..., 'There is some more text over here',...); By all appearances, this should be working. Anyone have some insight?

@TITLE:CSS *only* detection of text overflows in HTML?
@CONTENT:I've seen suggestions on using JavaScript for detecting and acting on text that overflows an HTML element. But it's 2013, so I was wondering if maybe the CSS spec had a way to detect overflows itself. In other words if I have a fixed size div: <div class="smart-warning" style="width:200px; height:20px; overflow:hidden">
This is my very long text that would overflow the box.
</div>
 I'd like to have a style that would do something if the text overflowed such as: <style>
.smart-warning {
  border:1px solid black
}
.smart-warning:overflowing {
  border:1px solid red
}
</style>
 It seems like we'd be really close to having something like this in CSS but pouring over the specifications is not my game. If it doesn't exist, do you think it would be useful? Thanks!

@TITLE:Filter nesting failed in Jade
@CONTENT:I have some filters: var jade = require('jade');
jade.filters.Posts = function(block) {
    return '{block:Posts}'+jade.render(block)+'{/block:Posts}';
};
jade.filters.Audio = function(block) {
    return '{block:Audio}'+jade.render(block)+'{/block:Audio}';

    Posts
        :Audio
            | Audio
        :Video
            | Video
 So I have an error:  >> unknown filter ":Audio"
 Can I handle or fix this problem? PS You can look at the code in this repository X I'm using grunt and grunt-contrib-jade plugin, but to force grunt-contrib-jade work with filters you should edit ./node_modules/grunt-contrib-jade/tasks/jade.js to reflect changes from this pull request. PS2: I found the stumbling block. When I use render() method inside filter, I invoke it from local jade instance, which is don't know anything about filters, but global jade instance (from Gruntfile.js) have all information about that filters. That's why the main question is: how can I throw global Jade-instance to file with filters? PS3: I don't know how create fiddle for such case. But you can clone my Hampi repo, implement changes to grunt-contrib-jade from my PR to them, then at start run npm i. To compile templates run grunt jade. Pay attention to these line in body.jade and commented section in filters. PS4. I find the reason and it in different scope. I describe it with details here. Can you solve this issue? I'm open to additional answers and I will accept fixes in jade core (if it would be required).

@CONTENT:I am using upload feature in my asp website. So i am using file input type. But this control add a default upload button browse and a textbox where path is shown after selecting file in Internet explorer.

So now when i click on "Attach a File" button browse for file windows appears and can select file to upload. But when i click on submit button the file upload control becomes reset and file is not uploaded. Error is that on clicking to submit button the file control becomes null. It happens only in internet explorer. So please help me to solve this.Below is code which can show the problem i am facing in IE.Same problem comes if i use asp:FileUpload control also.

 Download the sample code here UPDATE To reproduce the error i am facing 1) run the project i have given in the download link 2) Test in Internet explorer-any version 3)Click on attach a file button (not on browse,it is intended to make visible false,here shown only for example purpose) 4)browse for files in windows appearing and click OK 5)now click on Save button. When save button is clicked btnsave_Click function should trigger,but it is not triggering.If i click again on save button btnsave_Click gets triggered.But this time the upload control will not be having the file selected.you can see it in the textbox provided by browse control also(only for showing this i made browse control as visible) So now question why btnsave_Click is not triggered for the first time?

@TITLE:Should NSInteger really be used everywhere?
@CONTENT:Now there is an iPhone coming with 64-bit architecture. long becomes 64 bits (while int remains 32-bit) , and everywhere NSInteger has been used is now a long and so 64-bits not 32. And twitter has quite a few people saying "I'm glad I've used NSInteger everywhere not int". If you need to store a value that doesn't exceed 32 bits (for example in a loop which only loops 25 times), why should a long be used, because the 32 (at least) upper bits are going to be empty. If the program has worked on 32-bit integers, then what benefit does using 64-bits for integers provide, when it uses up more memory? Also there will be situations where using a 64-bit integer gives a different result to using a 32-bit integer. So if you use NSInteger then something may work on an iPhone 5S but not on an older device, whereas if int or long is explicitly used then the result will be the same on any device.

@CONTENT:I just cracked open The Little Schemer, and I feel like I'm missing something. The first question asks "Is it true that this is an atom?", but I do not see any definition of what an atom is. I suppose I can derive what an atom is by the answers to the questions, but then it goes on to ask what is the car of l, and what is the cdr of l, and I have no idea what is being asked. Is the purpose of the book to discover what the questions mean by reading the answers, or is there some basic knowledge that I need before I tackle this book? If the latter, can someone point me to where I might acquire that basic knowledge?

@LINK:/questions/18449162/simultaneous-camera-preview-and-processing
@TITLE:Simultaneous camera preview and processing
@CONTENT:I'm designing an application that has a OpenGL processing pipeline (collection of shaders) and simultaneously requires the end user to see the unprocessed camera preview. For the sake of example, suppose you want to show the user the camera preview and at the same time count the number of red objects in the scenes you receive from the camera, but any shaders you utilize to count the objects such as hue filtering, etc. should not be seen by the user. How would I go about setting this up properly? I know I can setup a camera preview and then on the callback receive camera frame data in YUV format, then dump that into an OpenGL texture and process the frame that way, however, that has performance problems associated with it. I have to roundtrip the data from the camera hardware to the VM, then pass it back to the GPU memory. I'm using SurfaceTexture to get the data from the camera directly in OpenGL understandable format and pass that to my shaders to solve this issue. I thought I'd be able to show that same unprocessed SurfaceTexture to the end user, but TextureView does not have a constructor or a setter where I can pass it the SurfaceTexture I want it to render. It always creates its own. This is an overview of my current setup: GLRenderThread: this class extends from Thread, setups the OpenGL context, display, etc. and uses a SurfaceTexture as the surface (3rd parameter of eglCreateWindowSurface). GLFilterChain: A collection of shaders that perform detection on the input texture. Camera: Uses a separate SurfaceTexture which is used as the input of GLFilterChain and grabs the camera's preview Finally a TextureView that displays the GLRenderThread's SurfaceTexture Obviously, with this setup, I'm showing the processed frames to the user which is not what I want. Further, the processing of the frames is not real-time. Basically, I run the input from Camera through the chain once and once all filters are done, I call updateTexImage to grab the next frame from the Camera. My processing is around 10 frames per second on Nexus 4. I feel that I probably need to use 2 GL contexts, one for real-time preview and one for processing, but I'm not certain. I'm hoping someone can push me in the right direction.

   public List<Office> Offices {get; set;}

public class Office

   public List<PhoneBook> WhitePages {get; set;}

   public List<Address> Addresses {get; set;}

public class Addresses

@TITLE:Which Design Pattern To Use For Validation [closed]
@CONTENT:I am sure I am not the only one who's facing this problem but I am unable to find a solution till now. The problem is as below. I have published a web service (on which I don't have any control and I cannot change it) from a legacy system and all the clients are using it. I receive requests from the web service and object which i get is a very complex one but for the sake of an example lets say I receive object A from the web service call which contains several other objects like Object B, Object C in it etc and in addition objects B & C also have some primitive data types as well as some other objects in them. My problem is that I want to validate the whole Object A (all the including objects and sub objects), which design pattern is recommended here? Secondly, the main point here is that I can get different types of Object A from the web service. What i really mean by different types of object A is that the Object A depends upon the client i.e. some clients will send Object A without filling the data in the containing Object B or even they can fill Object B partially and then send it in Object A. So I have to validate the Object A based on the client (as some clients will require containing Object B some will not, some will require few elements in Object B etc). So in other words I will have a place where I will also store the validation rules for each client which will tell me something like this that client ABC wants field abc in Object B to be of type string and the maximum length is 25 chars and it is mandatory to have data in that field. Some validations which I would like to perform is Checking fields of some object (say Object B) for data types, length of a particular field, is the field required for this client or is it optional etc etc... Any concrete working example will be extremely useful. The structure of the Object A for this particular example is as follows.     public class A
    {
        private B objectB;
        private C objectC;
        // and so on
    }

    public class B{
        private E objectE;
        private String name;
        private int age;
        // and so on
    } 

    public class C
    {
        private F objectF;
        private String address;
        private String country;
    }

    public class E
    {
        // Members here
    }

    public class F
    {
        // Members here
    }
 P.S: I have given arbitrary names to the classes and the members just for the general understanding. O yes I forgot to mention that I am using java here but it doesn't really matter as the design principles or patterns can be applied to any language. Hoping to hear from you guys soon.. :)

 works to reset the locale of couts and every stringstream I apply it too. However, do I really need to call imbue on EVERY stringstream declared in EVERY library I link to? There are some libraries that are proprietary and I cannot actually change their source code. There must be a way to reset the locale back to "C" globally?
@CODE:cout << 123456789 << endl 123456789 123,456,789 couts stringstreams setlocale(LC_ALL,"C"); std::cout.imbue(std::locale("C")); couts stringstream imbue stringstream "C"

@CONTENT:I am building rails 4 jQuery mobile application but I find that many times, not all, forms are being submitted twice, resulting in double insertion of records. Both in development and production. I have tried removing UJS and turbolinks but doesn't make any difference. If I disable ajax, my application won't apply the jQuery css to the returned view unless the browser is refreshed. My javascript files are not being called twice and no assets are installed in public/assets. I have not precompiled any assets. I wonder if this could be a problem of using a mouse instead of touch screen on a mobile? The application, while only using JQM needs to be usable from a desktop browser as well.

@LINK:/questions/16997846/how-to-force-g-to-inline-functions
@TITLE:How to force g++ to inline functions?
@CONTENT:I have recently encountered an issue with C++ inline functions when using Haskell FFI to C/C++. Namely, g++ does not really inline functions that are declared inline, and generate symbols for them. Ultimately, this generates linker error when ghci tries to load an object file which calls the inline function: Loading object (static) solveeq.o ... done
Loading object (dynamic) /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.6/libstdc++.so ... done
final link ... ghc: solveeq.o: unknown symbol `_ZN5Eigen8internal19throw_std_bad_allocEv'
 Here, _ZN5Eigen8internal19throw_std_bad_allocEv is an inline function in the header-only Eigen C++ library somehow being treated as a real function and given a linker symbol. solveeq.o is my object file which makes (indirect) calls to that function. The environment is Ubuntu 12.04 64bit, ghc 7.4.1. The issue is this: I can use extern "C" to prevent C++ decoration of functions names for my own functions. But I cannot/shouldn't change the C++ headers defined by others (for obvious reasons). In my opinion, the compiler shouldn't create a function for this inline definition in the first place to cause this error. The reason is simple. If the function in question is truly inlined, I wouldn't get an linker error. If the compiler gets smart and decides to create a real function for it, I get errors like this (or multiple definitions of the same function, as I read elsewhere). So now, the correctness of compilation/linking depends on the mood of the compiler. Also, I think linker issues like this practically defeats header-only C++ libraries (which are appealing for their portability) because now they can not be exported using extern "C". Is this a design problem of c++ or is this just a g++ issue? My question is, is there a way to prevent c++ compilers or g++ from not inlining inline functions? For example, is there a command line option for this? (Modifying source codes is out of question as they are library codes.) Also, I am curious how does the C++ STL deal with this issue. Are they also headers-only?

@TITLE:Gesture Listener onFling Not Acting Consistant
@CONTENT:Update: See bounty for expanded question. I have a GestureDetector setup on a ListView. The ListView is an entire fragment that comes from side of window and overlays another fragment partially. I want to give user ability to swipe it close (i.e. Wunderlist is a great example of this function on right side). Here is my setup:     gestureListener = new View.OnTouchListener() {
        public boolean onTouch(View v, MotionEvent event) {

            if (gestureDetector.onTouchEvent(event)) {
                return true;
            }

            return false;
        }
    };
    listView.setOnTouchListener(gestureListener); 
 The Listener itself: public class GestureListener extends SimpleOnGestureListener {

        private static final int SWIPE_MIN_DISTANCE = 180;
        private static final int SWIPE_THRESHOLD_VELOCITY = 50;

        @Override
        public boolean onFling(MotionEvent e1, MotionEvent e2, float velocityX,
                float velocityY) {

            try {
                if (e2.getX() - e1.getX() > SWIPE_MIN_DISTANCE
                        && Math.abs(velocityX) > SWIPE_THRESHOLD_VELOCITY) {

                    FragmentManager fma = getActivity()
                            .getSupportFragmentManager();



                    FragmentManager fm = getFragmentManager();
                    FragmentTransaction t = fm.beginTransaction();

                    SherlockListFragment mFrag = new RateReviewFragment();

                    t.add(R.id.main_frag, mFrag);
                    t.setCustomAnimations(R.anim.animation_enter,
                            R.anim.animation_leave);
                    t.remove(mFrag);
                    t.commit();

                }
                return false;
            } catch (Exception e) {

            }
            return false;

        @Override

    }
 Sometimes, when the ListView scrolls to the bottom (or list scrolling is interrupted with clicks on a list row) the GestureListener simply stops ... listening. Swiping will not work. You have to scroll back to top to get it to work again. If anyone can help me isolate these issues I would be grateful! UPDATE : Only one issue remains, "the listener stops listening" UPDATE TWO: I may have figured out what is CAUSING this; just dont know the fix: I have found something out after logging my actions; The lower I get in the list (and the more I interact with it), the measurements are not consistent. For example, if I move my finger a centimeter left and right - at very top of list, it will say I moved, for example, 200 pixels. But when I have the problem stated above, it is far lower, maybe 50, for the SAME 1 centimeter distance. So the window doesn't close because it's not meeting my if conditions. Sidenote: I have stated more than once, the problem is when "interacting with the list". This means: If I quickly scroll from top to bottom; no issue; but If I slowly work my way down, perhaps tapping on the screen, scrolling on and off, clicking buttons on the listView, some of which open a new activity (and then come back to same position), this is "interacting" with".

@CONTENT:So I'm trying to get an array of all the words used in my web page. Should be easy, right? The problem I run into is that $("body").text().split(" ") returns an array where the words at the beginning of one element and end of another are joined as one. i.e: <div id="1">Hello
    <div id="2">World</div>
</div>
 returns ["HelloWorld"] when I want it to return ["Hello", "World"]. I also tried: wordArr = [];

function getText(target)

    {
        $(this).children(function(){getText(this)});
    }

        for(var i =0; i < testArr.length; i++)
            wordArr.push(testArr[i]);
    }

}

getText("body");
 but $(node).children() is truthy for any node in the DOM that exists, so that didn't work. I'm sure I'm missing something obvious, so I'd appreciate an extra set of eyes. For what it's worth, I don't need unique words, just every word in the body of the document as an element in the array. I'm trying to use it to generate context and lexical co-occurrence with another set of words, so duplicates just up the contextual importance of a given word. Thanks in advance for any ideas. See Fiddle

@TITLE:HTML5: Why not use my own arbitrary tag names?
@CONTENT:As far as I know, it is perfectly legal to make up tag names in HTML5, and they work like normal with CSS styling and nesting and all. Of course my arbitrary tag names will make no difference to the browser, which does not understand them, but it goes very far in making my code more readable, which makes it easier to maintain. So why should I NOT use arbitrary tag names on my pages? Will it affect SEO? Will it break anything?

@TITLE:Akka actors unit testing with Scala
@CONTENT:I'm fairly new to Scala so please be gentle. In the app I'm currently building, I'm using Akka actors and I want to write some unit tests. I came across this official documentation for writing unit tests for Akka actors but I couldn't understand exactly how it should work. In particular, val actorRef = TestActorRef(new MyActor)
// hypothetical message stimulating a '42' answer
val future = actorRef ? Say42
val Success(result: Int) = future.value.get
result must be(42)
 When I try that, I get not found: value Success, which is not surprising. I then found this example of how to test Scala actors val actorRef = TestActorRef[TickTock]

implicit val timeout = Timeout(5 seconds)
val future = (actorRef ? new Tick("msg")).mapTo[String]
val result = Await.result(future, timeout.duration)

Assert.assertEquals("processed the tick message", result)
 , which admittedly is possibly old, but it is easy to understand and closer to what I normally use when I want to use Futures, and most importantly works. It does require me to declare a few implicits like the ActorSystem, timeout and such, which doesn't seem to be the case with the official way... If possible, I'd like to use the method proposed by the official documentation, so I would appreciate it if someone could help me understand how it works (in particular the Success bit) and how to use it.
@CODE:val actorRef = TestActorRef(new MyActor)
// hypothetical message stimulating a '42' answer
val future = actorRef ? Say42
val Success(result: Int) = future.value.get
result must be(42) not found: value Success val actorRef = TestActorRef[TickTock]

implicit val timeout = Timeout(5 seconds)
val future = (actorRef ? new Tick("msg")).mapTo[String]

I must be missing something - what are the key advantages of this type over a custom union?

@TITLE:pass c# struct by reference?
@CONTENT:In my c# application i receive pointer to c++ struct in callback/delegate. I'm not sure if class can do the trick but just casting c++ pointer to appropriate c# struct works fine, so I'm using c# struct for storing data. Now I want to pass reference to struct for further processing I can't use class because it probably will not "map" perfectly to c++ struct. I don't want to copy struct for better latency How can I do that? This example demonstrates that struct is passed by value, not by reference: using System;

namespace TestStruct
{
    struct s
    {
        public int a;
    }

    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            s s1 = new s
                       {
                           a = 1
                       };
            Foo(s1);
            Console.WriteLine("outer a = " + s1.a);
        }

        private static void Foo(s s1)
        {
            s1.a++;
            Console.WriteLine("inner a = " + s1.a);
        }

    }
}
 Output is: inner a = 2
outer a = 1
@CODE:class class using System;

namespace TestStruct
{
    struct s
    {
        public int a;
    }

    class Program

            Console.WriteLine("outer a = " + s1.a);
        }

@TITLE:IIS responses with HTML instead of JSON on ASP .NET MVC3
@CONTENT:The subject is selfexplanatory. I've developer and production environments. Developer env. is my localhost machine. I've action methods in contolers that sets response status code to 500 when something wents wrong (error occured, or logical inconsistance) and returns Json-answer. My common method looks like that: [HttpPost]
public ActionResult DoSomething(int id)
{
    try
    {
         // some useful code
    }
    catch(Exception ex)
    {
         Response.StatusCode = 500;
         Json(new { message = "error" }, JsonBehaviour.AllowGet)
    }
}
 On the client side in production env. when such an error occured ajax.response looks like an HTML-code, instead of expected JSON. Consider this: <div class="content-container">
 <fieldset>
   <h2>500 - Internal server error.</h2>
   <h3>There is a problem with the resource you are looking for, and it cannot be displayed.</h3>
</fieldset>
</div>
 Filter context is not an option. I think it is some sort of IIS or web.config issue. SOLUTION: We decided to add TrySkipIisCustomErrors in BeginRequest in Global.asax and it is solved problems in each method in our application.
@CODE:[HttpPost]
public ActionResult DoSomething(int id)
{
    try

@TITLE:How can I perform an asynchronous operation before grunt.initConfig()?
@CONTENT:Now I have my Gruntfile setup to perform some automatic detection magic like parsing sourcefiles to parse some PHP sources in roder to dynamically figure out filenames and paths I need to know before running grunt.initConfig(). Unfortunately grunt.initConfig() doesn't seem to be meant to be run asynchronously, so I see no way to have my asynchronous code executed before I can call it. Is there a trick to accomplish this or do I have to rewrite my detection routines synchronously? Is there any easy way to block execution before my callback has arrived? Inside grunt tasks there is of course this.async(), but for initConfig() that doesn't work. Here's a stripped down example: function findSomeFilesAndPaths(callback) {
  // async tasks that detect and parse
  // and execute callback(results) when done
}

module.exports = function (grunt) {
  var config = {
    pkg: grunt.file.readJSON('package.json'),
  }

  findSomeFilesAndPaths(function (results) {
    config.watch = {
      coffee: {
        files: results.coffeeDir + "**/*.coffee",
        tasks: ["coffee"]
         // ...
      }
    };

    grunt.initConfig(config);

    grunt.loadNpmTasks "grunt-contrib-coffee"
    // grunt.loadNpmTasks(...);
  });
};
 Any good ideas how to get this done? Thanks a lot!

@CONTENT:I am trying to log connection pooling for org.apache.commons.dbcp.BasicDataSource using log4j I am using spring framework for dao layer injection. When I saw code inside org.apache.commons.dbcp.BasicDataSource, Logger is not used .So it seems impossible to log pooling message for me.

@TITLE:Unregistering all events to release memory
@CONTENT:I have a program which allows the editing of product information. I noticed that it was not releasing memory after closing the editing forms. After some research I stumbled upon this question which mentions that the problem may be that it is hanging on to event subscriptions. That made sense to me because this form has about 100+ controls on it, many of which are custom with custom events which are subscribed to by their parent controls. This creates a pretty large hierarchy of event subscriptions. So I looked for a way to release these and found this which allows you to unsubscribe from that event. The problem is, I have a ton of subscriptions. Do I really have to manually unsubscribe from each event one by one on form close, or is there at least a way to release them in one fell swoop, or loop through them?

@TITLE:What's the correct way to initialize a member array with an initializer list?
@CONTENT:I have a struct that holds an array, and I'd like to pass an initializer list to the struct's constructor to be forwarded on to the array. To illustrate, I tried: #include <initializer_list>

struct Vector
{
    float v[3];

    Vector(std::initializer_list<float> values) : v{values} {}
};

int main()
{
    Vector v = {1, 2, 3};
}
 Which resulted in the error: error: cannot convert std::initializer_list<float> to float in initialization I tried using parentheses instead of braces for v but that gave the error: error: incompatible types in assignment of std::initializer_list<float> to float [3] My main motivation for trying to do this is to avoid the following warning that clang generates: template <int N>
struct Vector
{
    float v[N];
};

template <>
struct Vector<2>
{
    float x, y;
};

int main()
{
    Vector<2> v2 = {1.0f, 2.0f};         // Yay, works
    Vector<3> v3 = {1.0f, 2.0f, 3.0f};   // Results in warning in clang++
    Vector<3> u3 = {{1.0f, 2.0f, 3.0f}}; // Must use two braces to avoid warning
    // If I could make Vector<N> take an initializer list in its constructor, I
    // could forward that on to the member array and avoid using the double braces
}
 warning: suggest braces around initialization of subobject So my question is: How can I initialize a member array with an initializer list? (i.e. How can I make the first code work? Or is it not possible?

I'm using a coaxial cable to connect to a CRT TV, but I don't believe the cursor is drawing off-screen because I've tried adjusting the X/Y values to check for this.

@LINK:/questions/16240630/dynamically-add-new-lambda-expressions-to-create-a-filter
@TITLE:Dynamically add new lambda expressions to create a filter
@CONTENT:I need to do some filtering on an ObjectSet to obtain the entities I need by doing this : query = this.ObjectSet.Where(x => x.TypeId == 3); // this is just an example;
 Later in the code (and before launching the deferred execution) I filter the query again like this : query = query.Where(<another lambda here ...>);
 That works quite well so far. Here is my problem : The entities contains a DateFrom property and a DateTo property, which are both DataTime types. They represent a period of time. I need to filter the entities to get only those that are part of a collection of periods of time. The periods in the collection are not necessarily contiguous, so, the logic to retreive the entities looks like that : entities.Where(x => x.DateFrom >= Period1.DateFrom and x.DateTo <= Period1.DateTo)
||
entities.Where(x => x.DateFrom >= Period2.DateFrom and x.DateTo <= Period2.DateTo)
||
 ... and on and on for all the periods in the collection. I have tried doing that : foreach (var ratePeriod in ratePeriods)
{
    var period = ratePeriod;

    query = query.Where(de =>
        de.Date >= period.DateFrom && de.Date <= period.DateTo);
}
 But once I launch the deferred execution, it translates this into SQL just like I want it (one filter for each of the periods of time for as many periods there is in the collection), BUT, it translates to AND comparisons instead of OR comparisons, which returns no entities at all, since an entity cannot be part of more than one period of time, obviously. I need to build some sort of dynamic linq here to aggregate the period filters. Update Based on hatten's answer, I've added the following member : private Expression<Func<T, bool>> CombineWithOr<T>(Expression<Func<T, bool>> firstExpression, Expression<Func<T, bool>> secondExpression)
{
    // Create a parameter to use for both of the expression bodies.
    var parameter = Expression.Parameter(typeof(T), "x");
    // Invoke each expression with the new parameter, and combine the expression bodies with OR.
    var resultBody = Expression.Or(Expression.Invoke(firstExpression, parameter), Expression.Invoke(secondExpression, parameter));
    // Combine the parameter with the resulting expression body to create a new lambda expression.
    return Expression.Lambda<Func<T, bool>>(resultBody, parameter);
}
 Declared a new CombineWithOr Expression : Expression<Func<DocumentEntry, bool>> resultExpression = n => false;
 And used it in my period collection iteration like this : foreach (var ratePeriod in ratePeriods)
{
    var period = ratePeriod;
    Expression<Func<DocumentEntry, bool>> expression = de => de.Date >= period.DateFrom && de.Date <= period.DateTo;
    resultExpression = this.CombineWithOr(resultExpression, expression);
}

var documentEntries = query.Where(resultExpression.Compile()).ToList();
 I looked at the resulting SQL and it's like the Expression has no effect at all. The resulting SQL returns the previously programmed filters but not the combined filters. Why ? Update 2 I wanted to give feO2x's suggestion a try, so I have rewritten my filter query like this : query = query.AsEnumerable()
    .Where(de => ratePeriods
        .Any(rp => rp.DateFrom <= de.Date && rp.DateTo >= de.Date))
 As you can see, I added AsEnumerable() but the compiler gave me an error that it cannot convert the IEnumerable back to IQueryable, so I have added ToQueryable() at the end of my query : query = query.AsEnumerable()
    .Where(de => ratePeriods
        .Any(rp => rp.DateFrom <= de.Date && rp.DateTo >= de.Date))
            .ToQueryable();
 Everything works fine. I can compile the code and launch this query. However, it doesn't fit my needs. While profiling the resulting SQL, I can see that the filtering is not part of the SQL query because it filters the dates in-memory during the process. I guess that you already know about that and that is what you intended to suggest. Your suggestion works, BUT, since it fetches all the entities from the database (and there are thousands and thousands of them) before filtering them in-memory, it's really slow to get back that huge amount from the database. What I really want is to send the period filtering as part of the resulting SQL query, so it won't return a huge amount of entities before finishing up with the filtering process.
@CODE:query = this.ObjectSet.Where(x => x.TypeId == 3); // this is just an example; query = query.Where(<another lambda here ...>); entities.Where(x => x.DateFrom >= Period1.DateFrom and x.DateTo <= Period1.DateTo)
||
entities.Where(x => x.DateFrom >= Period2.DateFrom and x.DateTo <= Period2.DateTo)
|| foreach (var ratePeriod in ratePeriods)
{
    var period = ratePeriod;

    query = query.Where(de =>
        de.Date >= period.DateFrom && de.Date <= period.DateTo);

@TITLE:Error 1 libavcodec.so File format not recognized Android GL Live Wallpaper
@CONTENT:I am trying to make a Live Wallpaper for android that plays an .mp4 video located on the device in android-asset (with the example I am using, it actually copies the file to the sdcard at runtime/doesn't matter) I found this example And using this post I was able to get my eclipse set up with NDK and building the project. When building in eclipse using the NDK plugin I get this error in my problems window:     Description Resource    Path    Location    Type
make: *** [libs/armeabi/libavcodec.so] Error 1  GLWallpaperVideoDemo-master         C/C++ Problem
make: *** Deleting file `libs/armeabi/libavcodec.so'    GLWallpaperVideoDemo-master         C/C++ Problem
 I get the same error if I try to run ndk-build from command prompt. I downloaded the project from the link above and then imported into eclipse. I added the lib GLWallpaperService to the build path, and made sure my NDK was setup. Knowing that the lib folder changed to libs I also tried moving the GLWallpaperService to the libs folder, which didn't help. The project builds without NDK just fine in eclipse but obviously errors when trying to run the wallpaper because the native libraries were not built. How can I resolve this error?

@LINK:/questions/16091947/how-to-route-non-crud-actions-in-a-restful-asp-net-web-api
@TITLE:How to Route non-CRUD actions in a RESTful ASP.NET Web API?
@CONTENT:I am trying to design a RESTful web API for our service using ASP.NET Web API. I'm running into trouble with figuring out how to route non-CRUD actions to the proper controller action. Let's assume my resource is a door. I can do all of the familiar CRUD things with my door. Let's say that model for my door is: public class Door
{
   public long Id { get; set; }
   public string InsideRoomName { get; set; }
   public string OutsideRoomName { get; set; }
}
 I can do all of my standard CRUD operations via my web api: POST: http://api.contoso.com/v1/doors
GET: http://api.contoso.com/v1/doors
GET: http://api.contoso.com/v1/doors/1234
GET: http://api.contoso.com/v1/doors?InsideRoomName=Cafeteria
PUT: http://api.contoso.com/v1/doors/1234
DELETE: http://api.contoso.com/v1/doors/1234
 and so on. Where I run into trouble is when I need to model the non-CRUD actions against my door. I want to model a Lock and Unlock verb against my resource. Reading through the ASP.NET articles the guidance seems to be to switch to an RPC style call when using custom actions. This gives me a path: PUT: http://api.contoso.com/v1/doors/1234/lock
PUT: http://api.contoso.com/v1/doors/1234/unlock
 This seems to conflict with the spirit of REST which aims for the path to indicate a resource. I suppose I could model the verb as a resource: POST: http://api.contoso.com/v1/doors/1234/lockrequests
POST: http://api.contoso.com/v1/doors/1234/unlockrequests
 In this case I could still use the recommend {controller}/{id}/{action} but it seems like I'm still creating a mixed RPC / REST API. Is it possible, or even recommended as far as REST interfaces go, to put the custom action in the list of parameters? PUT: http://api.contoso.com/v1/doors/1234?lock
PUT: http://api.contoso.com/v1/doors/1234?unlock
 I could foresee a need to have this call supported with query parameters as well, such as: PUT: http://api.contoso.com/v1/doors?lock&InsideRoomName=Cafeteria
 How would I create the route to map this request to my DoorsController? public class DoorsController : ApiController
{
   public IEnumerable<Doord> Get();
   public Door Get(long id);
   public void Put(long id, Door door);
   public void Post(Door door);
   public void Delete(long id);

   public void Lock(long id);
   public void Unlock(long id);
   public void Lock(string InsideRoomName);
}
 I may be making some false assumptions here regarding what is and is not best practices with respect to REST API design, so any guidance there is appreciated as well.

@TITLE:Permission denied on CopyFile in VBS
@CONTENT:I'm trying to automate pushing a file into my users' home directories, but am stuck on a "Permission Denied" error X is thrown on line 6 here, with the CopyFile call. There are other parts of the script (not shown) that create and copy folder contents using the same source and destination directories, and they work perfectly. It's only when I use CopyFile that it fails. dim fso

 H: is a network home directory, to which the current user has full read/write privs. I've tried adding/removing trailing slashes from the paths, adding "options.txt" to the destination path, removing the false argument...

@CONTENT:Here's my situation: I have a wsdl, "translated" to a header file like this: wsdl2h -o file.h file.wsdl Then, I executed soapcpp2 -Icorrect_path -j file.h On "server side" I implemented the service, using soapXXXService.[h|cpp] On "server side" again, I used soap_init2 (with SOAP_IO_KEEPALIVE), I have soap_bind, soap_accept, soap_copy, etc. and it seems to work perfectly fine (see below) On "client side", I use the generated proxy object (again using SOAP_IO_KEEPALIVE), construct the message and send it to the server The "server" receives this message and sends back ACK (custom XML) The "client" receives the ACK and everything is perfectly fine. So, what I want to do now is make the "server" return the "real" response to the "client" and the "client" has to return back an ACK to the "server". How is this possible? (it should be) "What have you tried?" Two things come to my mind. The first is to somehow reuse the socket's file descriptor, returned from soap_accept, to send the "real response" back to the server. But Is this even possible? Unix sockets are full duplex, so this is technically possible, but does gSoap restricts this? Because I didn't see anything about this in the documentation. The second option, that comes to my mind is to create the same "service" in the "client", to make it possible to receive messages (the "real response") and to return ACK the same way it's done in the "server". But this would mean, that the "server" must also has an instance of proxy object to be able to send this so called "real response". And this sounds really ugly and horrible to me. Not that I'll be surprised if this is the only option, but.. Edit: for the second option - this would mean, that the client should have a listener port, should handle incoming connections, etc. Does not sound like a client to me.. I understand, that I may be missing some fundamental part(s) of how gSoap works, but I read the whole user documentation and the "getting started" guide and I didn't find anything about this. Please, let me know if something is not clear EDIT: Here's the scenario, I want to achieve: client sends request to the server server returns ACK as response (like the standard ACK) - signals successfully received request later, the server sends response to the client (that's the real response) the client returns ACK again - signals successfully received response And this scenario could be in the opposite direction, too: server could also send request to the client. That would mean - the same scenario as above, but replacing "client" <-> "server". NOTE: both request/response and ACK ARE SOAP messages.

@TITLE:How to receive keyboard input from application with admin privileges to a non-admin application?
@CONTENT:I have programmed an application that has an overlay-kind of window that can be shown and hidden via hotkey while another application has the focus. Said other application is a DirectX game that runs with admin privileges. I have already tried 3 possible solutions to get notified when my hotkey is pressed in the other application, 2 of them kind of work, but require my application to have administrative privileges too. That is kind of acceptable, but I'd much rather have a solution that does not require those privileges. I am sure that there has to be a way, since applications like TeamSpeak do manage to receive input without being run as admin. What I have tried already: RegisterHotkey - not suitable because it doesn't work while in DirectX windows. SetWindowsHookEx - works as a general keyboard hook, but only with admin privileges. GetAsyncKeyState - works to check the specified hotkey, but not without admin privileges yet again. So yeah, I'd be really grateful if someone could provide an idea for a different solution since there is nothing more I could think of ... I am using Delphi, but since I'm relying on Windows API anyways I don't think the solution will be language specific.

@LINK:/questions/15856614/how-can-i-bubble-up-events-on-nested-backbone-collections
@TITLE:How can I bubble up events on nested Backbone collections?
@CONTENT:I have a Backbone app that uses nested collections (at least that's how I think they're called). In my particular case there are tabs and subtabs, and each tab (model) contains a collection of subtab (model). For those who're more familiar with code, I'll write bellow my models and collections, and how subtabs are nested inside the tab model: // Subtab Model
var Subtab = Backbone.Model.extend({
    defaults: { label: undefined }
});

// Subtabs Collection
var Subtabs = Backbone.Collection.extend({
    model: Subtab
});

// Tab Model
var Tab = Backbone.Model.extend({
    defaults: { label: undefined, subtabs: new Subtabs}
});

// Tabs Collection
var Tabs = Backbone.Collection.extend({
    model: Tab
});
 Now, when I change a tab's attribute it fires the change event on the Tab model and also on the Tabs collection (quite normal, right?), but when I change a subtab's attribute, it fires the change event on the Subtab model and Subtabs collection (this is also normal) but it doesn't bubble up to the Tab model (and to the Tabs collection). At least, I guess it should because a collection inside a model was changed and so the model was changed (but maybe I'm wrong and I'm not getting it). Any suggestion on how can I achieve this behavior with Backbone?
@CODE:// Subtab Model
var Subtab = Backbone.Model.extend({
    defaults: { label: undefined }
});

// Subtabs Collection
var Subtabs = Backbone.Collection.extend({
    model: Subtab
});

// Tab Model
var Tab = Backbone.Model.extend({
    defaults: { label: undefined, subtabs: new Subtabs}
});

// Tabs Collection
var Tabs = Backbone.Collection.extend({
    model: Tab
}); Tab Tabs Subtab Subtabs Tab Tabs

@LINK:/questions/15839114/restful-soft-delete
@TITLE:RESTful Soft Delete
@CONTENT:I'm trying to build a RESTful webapp wherein I utilize GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. But I had a question about the use of DELETE in this particular app. A bit of background first: My webapp manages generic entities that are also managed (and, it happens, always created) in another system. So within my webapp, each entity will be stored in the database with a unique key. But the way we will be accessing them through URLs is with the unique key of the other system. A simple example will make this clear, I think. Take the URL /entity/1. This will display information for the entity with ID 1 in the other system, and not my own system. In fact, IDs in my system will be completely hidden. There will be no URL scheme for accessing the entity with ID of 1 in my own system. Alright, so now that we know how my webapp is structured, let's return to deleting those entities. There will be a way to 'delete' entities in my system, but I put quotes around it because it won't actually be deleting them from the database. Rather, it will flag them with a property that prevents it from appearing when you go to /entity/1. Because of this, I feel like I should be using PUT ('deleting' in this way will be idempotent), since I am, from the perspective of the data, simply setting a property. So, the question: does the RESTful approach have fidelity to the data (in which case it is clear that I am PUTing), or the representation of the data in the app (in which case it seems that I am DELETEing)?

@CONTENT:I have a Haskell source file which using Unicode syntax: {-# LANGUAGE UnicodeSyntax #-}

 This parses and runs fine with GHC. Additionally, stylish-haskell and hlint (both based on haskell-src-exts) can read this file without any trouble. However, when I try to parse it myself using haskell-src-exts: import Language.Haskell.Exts (parseModule)

    print $ parseModule x
 I get the error message: ParseFailed (SrcLoc {srcFilename = "<unknown>.hs", srcLine = 6, srcColumn = 1}) "TypeOperators is not enabled"

    print $ parseModuleWithMode defaultParseMode

@TITLE:Why does these two code variants produce different floating-point results?
@CONTENT:Given this example C++ code snippet: void floatSurprise()
{
    // these come from some sort of calculation
    int a = 18680, b = 3323524, c = 121;
    float m = float(a) / c;

    // variant 1: calculate result from single expression
    float r1 = b - (2.0f * m * a) + (m * m * c);
    cout << "r1 = " << r1 << endl;

    // variant 2: break up the expression into intermediate parts, 
    /// then calculate 
    float
        r2_p1 = 2.0f * m * a,
        r2_p2 = m * m * c,
        r2 = b - r2_p1 + r2_p2;

    cout << "r2 = " << r2 << endl;
}
 The output is: dev1 = 439703 dev2 = 439702 When viewed in the debugger, the values are actually 439702.50 and 439702.25, respectively, which is interesting in itself - not sure why iostream prints floats without the fractional part by default. EDIT: The reason for this was that the default precision setting for cout was too low, needed cout << setprecision(7) at least to see the decimal point for numbers of this magnitude. But I'm even more interested in why am I getting different results. I suppose it has to do with rounding and some subtle interplay of ints with the required float output type, but I can't put my finger on it. Which value is the correct one? I was amazed that it was so easy to shoot myself in the foot with such a simple piece of code. Any insight will be greatly appreciated! The compiler was VC++2010. EDIT2: I did some more investigating using a spreadsheet to generate "correct" values for the intermediate variables and found (via tracing) that indeed they were being trimmed, contributing to the precision loss in the ultimate result. I also found a problem with the single expression, because I actually used a handy function for calculating squares instead of m * m there: template<typename T> inline T sqr(const T &arg) { return arg*arg; }
 Even though I asked nicely, the compiler apparently didn't inline this, and calculated the value separately, trimming the result before returning the value to the expression, skewing the result yet again. Ouch.

@TITLE:How to draw transparent with alpha transparency in Delphi?
@CONTENT:I want to draw quite complex images with alpha-transparent rectangles and alpha-transparent images. There is GDI+ wrapper from Mitov, but it doesn't seem to support 32bit BMP files plus it rescales them and the documentation is terrible. BMPs are way faster than PNGs so I want to use them. There is SynGDI wrapper of GDI+, but it seems very basic and there is no documentation for it. There is also this trick for GDI: procedure DrawAlphaAPI(Source: TBitmap; Destination: TCanvas;
  const X, Y: Integer; const Opacity: Byte = 255);
var  BlendFunc: TBlendFunction;
begin
  BlendFunc.BlendOp := AC_SRC_OVER;
  BlendFunc.BlendFlags := 0;
  BlendFunc.SourceConstantAlpha := Opacity;

  if Source.PixelFormat = pf32bit then
    BlendFunc.AlphaFormat := AC_SRC_ALPHA
  else
    BlendFunc.AlphaFormat := 0;

  Windows.AlphaBlend(Destination.Handle, X, Y, Source.Width, Source.Height,
  Source.Canvas.Handle, 0, 0, Source.Width, Source.Height, BlendFunc);
end;
 But when I call it with Opacity = 255 it draws 32bit bitmaps not properly (something like they are half transparent where they should be fully). I don't want to use Scanline to make pixels transparent as this will be too complicated to draw all the transparent rectangles this way. Also I thin GDI+ should be faster on modern computers, am I right? So the question is: how to draw an alpha transparent rectangle and bitmap easily (without tons of code)? Preferred Delphi: 7. I also have 2005 and XE3 but since 7 is a speed demon I would most want something to work from 7 up.
@CODE:procedure DrawAlphaAPI(Source: TBitmap; Destination: TCanvas;
  const X, Y: Integer; const Opacity: Byte = 255);
var  BlendFunc: TBlendFunction;
begin
  BlendFunc.BlendOp := AC_SRC_OVER;
  BlendFunc.BlendFlags := 0;
  BlendFunc.SourceConstantAlpha := Opacity;

  if Source.PixelFormat = pf32bit then
    BlendFunc.AlphaFormat := AC_SRC_ALPHA
  else
    BlendFunc.AlphaFormat := 0;

  Windows.AlphaBlend(Destination.Handle, X, Y, Source.Width, Source.Height,

@TITLE:How to make Navigation Bar like Instagram
@CONTENT:I need to implement something like this: tableView must bounce, but not navigation bar. I tried a bunch of different variants. Something like this: - (void)scrollViewDidScroll:(UIScrollView *)scrollView
{
    CGRect imageViewFrame = self.imageView.frame;
    CGRect tableViewFrame = self.tableView.frame;
    //ImageView - is top view(instead of NavBar)
    //defaultHeight - is default height of tableView
    imageViewFrame.origin.y = MIN(0, MAX(-scrollView.contentOffset.y, -100));
    tableViewFrame.origin.y = imageViewFrame.origin.y + 100;
    tableViewFrame.size.height = defaultHeight - imageViewFrame.origin.y;

    self.imageView.frame = imageViewFrame;
    self.tableView.frame = tableViewFrame;
}
 Get this: it is not suitable because in Instagram size of tableView doesn't change(just look at scroll indicators, if size of tableView changed, they also changed) Also I tried add View as subView into tableView, it works, but not exactly what I need is. In Instagram navigation bar outside the tableView, so it is not suitable too. In the facebook app search bar behaves exactly the same Can anyone help me? Thanks!
@CODE:- (void)scrollViewDidScroll:(UIScrollView *)scrollView
{

@CONTENT:Still learning backbone so bear with me; I'm trying to add a new model with blank fields to a view, but the template I've created has a whole bunch of <input value="<%= some_value %>" type="whatever" />
 Works perfectly fine when fetching data, it populates it and all goes well. The trouble arises when I want to create a new (blank) rendered view, it gives me Uncaught ReferenceError: some_value is not defined
 I can set defaults (I do already for a few that have default values in the db) but that means typing out over 40 of them with blanks; is there a better way of handling this? I'm fiddling around with the underscore template itself, trying something like <%= if(some_value != undefined){ some_value } %> but that also seems a bit cumbersome.

@TITLE:Details on what happens when a struct implements an interface
@CONTENT:I recently came across this Stackoverflow question: When to use struct in C#? In it, it had an answer that said something a bit profound: In addition, realize that when a struct implements an interface - as Enumerator does - and is cast to that implemented type, the struct becomes a reference type and is moved to the heap. Internal to the Dictionary class, Enumerator is still a value type. However, as soon as a method calls GetEnumerator(), a reference-type IEnumerator is returned. Exactly what does this mean? If I had something like struct Foo : IFoo 
{
  public int Foobar;
}

class Bar
{
  public IFoo Biz{get; set;} //assume this is Foo
}

...

var b=new Bar();
var f=b.Biz;
f.Foobar=123; //What would happen here
b.Biz.Foobar=567; //would this overwrite the above, or would it have no effect?
b.Biz=new Foo(); //and here!?
 What exactly are the detailed semantics of a value-type structure being treated like a reference-type?
@CODE:struct Foo : IFoo 
{
  public int Foobar;
}

class Bar
{
  public IFoo Biz{get; set;} //assume this is Foo
}

...

var b=new Bar();
var f=b.Biz;
f.Foobar=123; //What would happen here
b.Biz.Foobar=567; //would this overwrite the above, or would it have no effect?

@LINK:/questions/15183010/how-often-should-i-reseed-in-c
@TITLE:How often should I reseed in C++?
@CONTENT:I just wonder if it is enough to seed the random number generator only once at the beginning of a program. I write functions which uses random numbers. I never seed the rand() generator within the function, but rather leave calling srand() on main entry. E.g. my program may look like: void func1()
{
    std::cout << "This is func1 " << std::rand() << std::endl;
}

void func2()
{
    std::cout << "This is func2 " << std::rand() << std::endl;
}

int main()
{
    std::srand(std::time(NULL));
    func1();
    func2();
    return 0;
}
 By doing so, I can easily switch off seeding from the main entry. It comes useful when debugging a program - the results are kept the same every time I run the program without seeding. Sometimes, if a problem occurs due to some random number, it may just disappear if a different set of random numbers is to be generated, so I'd prefer such a simple mechanism to switch off seeding. However, I noticed in C++11's new random utility set, the random number generator has to be instantiated before using. (e.g. default_random_engine). And every time a generator has to be seeded separately. I wonder if it is actually encouraged to reseed the generator whenever a new generator is needed. I know I could create a global random generator and seed it only once as before, but I don't really like the idea of using global variables at all. Otherwise, if I create a local random number generator, I sort of lose the ability to globally switch off seeding for debugging or whatever purpose. I'm excited to learn the new features in C++11, but sometimes it's just very confusing. Can anyone let me know if I got anything wrong with the new random generators? Or what might be the best practice in C++11?
@CODE:void func1()
{
    std::cout << "This is func1 " << std::rand() << std::endl;
}

void func2()
{
    std::cout << "This is func2 " << std::rand() << std::endl;
}

@TITLE:Why does these two code variants produce different floating-point results?
@CONTENT:Given this example C++ code snippet: void floatSurprise()
{
    // these come from some sort of calculation
    int a = 18680, b = 3323524, c = 121;
    float m = float(a) / c;

    // variant 1: calculate result from single expression
    float r1 = b - (2.0f * m * a) + (m * m * c);
    cout << "r1 = " << r1 << endl;

    // variant 2: break up the expression into intermediate parts, 
    /// then calculate 
    float
        r2_p1 = 2.0f * m * a,
        r2_p2 = m * m * c,
        r2 = b - r2_p1 + r2_p2;

    cout << "r2 = " << r2 << endl;
}
 The output is: dev1 = 439703 dev2 = 439702 When viewed in the debugger, the values are actually 439702.50 and 439702.25, respectively, which is interesting in itself - not sure why iostream prints floats without the fractional part by default. EDIT: The reason for this was that the default precision setting for cout was too low, needed cout << setprecision(7) at least to see the decimal point for numbers of this magnitude. But I'm even more interested in why am I getting different results. I suppose it has to do with rounding and some subtle interplay of ints with the required float output type, but I can't put my finger on it. Which value is the correct one? I was amazed that it was so easy to shoot myself in the foot with such a simple piece of code. Any insight will be greatly appreciated! The compiler was VC++2010. EDIT2: I did some more investigating using a spreadsheet to generate "correct" values for the intermediate variables and found (via tracing) that indeed they were being trimmed, contributing to the precision loss in the ultimate result. I also found a problem with the single expression, because I actually used a handy function for calculating squares instead of m * m there: template<typename T> inline T sqr(const T &arg) { return arg*arg; }
 Even though I asked nicely, the compiler apparently didn't inline this, and calculated the value separately, trimming the result before returning the value to the expression, skewing the result yet again. Ouch.
@CODE:void floatSurprise()
{
    // these come from some sort of calculation

 I know that SBT has the sbt.boot.properties files, but can't figure out if the flag should go in there or not. And if it is an example would be nice. Thx in advance. BTW I use SBT launcher for 0.12.2 and have the issue both with SBT 0.12.2 and 0.11.3. And I'm on Ubuntu in case that matters.

@CONTENT:I have two models, Complaint and Company. Complaint belongs_to and accepts_nested_attributes for Company, and Company has_many Complaints. # Models

class Complaint < ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :complaint, :date, :resolved

  belongs_to :user, :class_name => 'User', :foreign_key => 'id'
  belongs_to :company, :class_name => 'Company', :foreign_key => 'id'
  has_many :replies

  has_many :complaints, :class_name => 'Complaint', :foreign_key => 'id'
  has_many :branches, :class_name => 'Branch', :foreign_key => 'id'
  belongs_to :industry

end
 In the Complaint Controller I try build a Company in the new method. # Complaint Controller

class ComplaintsController < ApplicationController
...
def new
    @complaint = Complaint.new
    @complaint.build_company

    respond_to do |format|
      format.html # new.html.erb
      format.json { render json: @complaint }
    end
  end
...
end
 In the form I have added a field for adding a name attribute to the Company. # Complaint Form

<%= form_for(@complaint) do |f| %>
  <% if @complaint.errors.any? %>
    <div id="error_explanation">
      <h2><%= pluralize(@complaint.errors.count, "error") %> prohibited this complaint from being saved:</h2>

      <ul>
      <% @complaint.errors.full_messages.each do |msg| %>

@TITLE:How to draw transparent with alpha transparency in Delphi?
@CONTENT:I want to draw quite complex images with alpha-transparent rectangles and alpha-transparent images. There is GDI+ wrapper from Mitov, but it doesn't seem to support 32bit BMP files plus it rescales them and the documentation is terrible. BMPs are way faster than PNGs so I want to use them. There is SynGDI wrapper of GDI+, but it seems very basic and there is no documentation for it. There is also this trick for GDI: procedure DrawAlphaAPI(Source: TBitmap; Destination: TCanvas;
  const X, Y: Integer; const Opacity: Byte = 255);
var  BlendFunc: TBlendFunction;
begin
  BlendFunc.BlendOp := AC_SRC_OVER;
  BlendFunc.BlendFlags := 0;
  BlendFunc.SourceConstantAlpha := Opacity;

  if Source.PixelFormat = pf32bit then
    BlendFunc.AlphaFormat := AC_SRC_ALPHA
  else
    BlendFunc.AlphaFormat := 0;

  Windows.AlphaBlend(Destination.Handle, X, Y, Source.Width, Source.Height,
  Source.Canvas.Handle, 0, 0, Source.Width, Source.Height, BlendFunc);
end;
 But when I call it with Opacity = 255 it draws 32bit bitmaps not properly (something like they are half transparent where they should be fully). I don't want to use Scanline to make pixels transparent as this will be too complicated to draw all the transparent rectangles this way. Also I thin GDI+ should be faster on modern computers, am I right? So the question is: how to draw an alpha transparent rectangle and bitmap easily (without tons of code)? Preferred Delphi: 7. I also have 2005 and XE3 but since 7 is a speed demon I would most want something to work from 7 up.
@CODE:procedure DrawAlphaAPI(Source: TBitmap; Destination: TCanvas;
  const X, Y: Integer; const Opacity: Byte = 255);
var  BlendFunc: TBlendFunction;
begin
  BlendFunc.BlendOp := AC_SRC_OVER;
  BlendFunc.BlendFlags := 0;
  BlendFunc.SourceConstantAlpha := Opacity;

  if Source.PixelFormat = pf32bit then
    BlendFunc.AlphaFormat := AC_SRC_ALPHA
  else
    BlendFunc.AlphaFormat := 0;

  Windows.AlphaBlend(Destination.Handle, X, Y, Source.Width, Source.Height,
  Source.Canvas.Handle, 0, 0, Source.Width, Source.Height, BlendFunc);
end; this wrapper code like this color adjustment GPBitmap TBitmap

{
    CGRect imageViewFrame = self.imageView.frame;

    //ImageView - is top view(instead of NavBar)

    tableViewFrame.size.height = defaultHeight - imageViewFrame.origin.y;

    self.imageView.frame = imageViewFrame;
    self.tableView.frame = tableViewFrame;
}
 Get this: it is not suitable because in Instagram size of tableView doesn't change(just look at scroll indicators, if size of tableView changed, they also changed) Also I tried add View as subView into tableView, it works, but not exactly what I need is. In Instagram navigation bar outside the tableView, so it is not suitable too. In the facebook app search bar behaves exactly the same Can anyone help me? Thanks!

@TITLE:Ignoring undefined data / vars in an underscore template
@CONTENT:Still learning backbone so bear with me; I'm trying to add a new model with blank fields to a view, but the template I've created has a whole bunch of <input value="<%= some_value %>" type="whatever" />
 Works perfectly fine when fetching data, it populates it and all goes well. The trouble arises when I want to create a new (blank) rendered view, it gives me Uncaught ReferenceError: some_value is not defined
 I can set defaults (I do already for a few that have default values in the db) but that means typing out over 40 of them with blanks; is there a better way of handling this? I'm fiddling around with the underscore template itself, trying something like <%= if(some_value != undefined){ some_value } %> but that also seems a bit cumbersome.

@LINK:/questions/15207260/details-on-what-happens-when-a-struct-implements-an-interface
@TITLE:Details on what happens when a struct implements an interface
@CONTENT:I recently came across this Stackoverflow question: When to use struct in C#? In it, it had an answer that said something a bit profound: In addition, realize that when a struct implements an interface - as Enumerator does - and is cast to that implemented type, the struct becomes a reference type and is moved to the heap. Internal to the Dictionary class, Enumerator is still a value type. However, as soon as a method calls GetEnumerator(), a reference-type IEnumerator is returned. Exactly what does this mean? If I had something like struct Foo : IFoo 
{
  public int Foobar;
}

class Bar
{
  public IFoo Biz{get; set;} //assume this is Foo
}

...

var b=new Bar();
var f=b.Biz;
f.Foobar=123; //What would happen here
b.Biz.Foobar=567; //would this overwrite the above, or would it have no effect?
b.Biz=new Foo(); //and here!?
 What exactly are the detailed semantics of a value-type structure being treated like a reference-type?
@CODE:struct Foo : IFoo 
{
  public int Foobar;
}

class Bar
{
  public IFoo Biz{get; set;} //assume this is Foo
}

...

var b=new Bar();
var f=b.Biz;
f.Foobar=123; //What would happen here
b.Biz.Foobar=567; //would this overwrite the above, or would it have no effect?
b.Biz=new Foo(); //and here!? Foo foo = b.Biz; foo = null null

@LINK:/questions/15183010/how-often-should-i-reseed-in-c
@TITLE:How often should I reseed in C++?
@CONTENT:I just wonder if it is enough to seed the random number generator only once at the beginning of a program. I write functions which uses random numbers. I never seed the rand() generator within the function, but rather leave calling srand() on main entry. E.g. my program may look like: void func1()
{
    std::cout << "This is func1 " << std::rand() << std::endl;
}

void func2()
{
    std::cout << "This is func2 " << std::rand() << std::endl;
}

int main()
{
    std::srand(std::time(NULL));
    func1();
    func2();
    return 0;
}
 By doing so, I can easily switch off seeding from the main entry. It comes useful when debugging a program - the results are kept the same every time I run the program without seeding. Sometimes, if a problem occurs due to some random number, it may just disappear if a different set of random numbers is to be generated, so I'd prefer such a simple mechanism to switch off seeding. However, I noticed in C++11's new random utility set, the random number generator has to be instantiated before using. (e.g. default_random_engine). And every time a generator has to be seeded separately. I wonder if it is actually encouraged to reseed the generator whenever a new generator is needed. I know I could create a global random generator and seed it only once as before, but I don't really like the idea of using global variables at all. Otherwise, if I create a local random number generator, I sort of lose the ability to globally switch off seeding for debugging or whatever purpose. I'm excited to learn the new features in C++11, but sometimes it's just very confusing. Can anyone let me know if I got anything wrong with the new random generators? Or what might be the best practice in C++11?
@CODE:void func1()
{
    std::cout << "This is func1 " << std::rand() << std::endl;
}

void func2()
{
    std::cout << "This is func2 " << std::rand() << std::endl;
}

@TITLE:jQuery & Backbone click events not firing
@CONTENT:I know this problem comes up a million times, but I've been through the answers and none of them help. JS Fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/ZrYYy/ var LoginView = Backbone.View.extend({

    initialize: function () {

        console.log('Login View Intialized');
        this.el = $('#login-container');

    events: {

var newLogin = new Login();
var loginView = new LoginView({model: newLogin});
 In the fiddle, when I bind a normal $('#login-btn').click(); event it works fine although it does not in my own setup (with chrome). The backbone click event does not work whatsoever.

@TITLE:Syntax error: File to import not found or unreadable: foundation/common/ratios
@CONTENT:I have foundation installed and when I edit and save the app.scss file it creates a "app.css" and a "config.rb" file in the sass folder of my project. when I open that "app.css" file I get this Syntax error: File to import not found or unreadable: foundation/common/ratios.
 and then under that I get this: File to import not found or unreadable: foundation/common/ratios.
          Load paths:
            /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/WebApp02/sass
            /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/compass-0.12.2/frameworks/blueprint/stylesheets
            /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/compass-0.12.2/frameworks/compass/stylesheets
            Compass::SpriteImporter
    on line 1 of /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/WebApp02/sass/_settings.scss
    from line 2 of /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/WebApp02/sass/app.scss
 and then a bunch of paths to my gems. It never created an app.css and config.rb file in my sass folder before I was wondering if anyone can explain why that is happening. Compass still complies to app.css in the "stylesheet" folder but I would like to fix this to keep from any future errors from happening. config.rb file looks like this require 'zurb-foundation'
Require any additional compass plugins here.

@LINK:/questions/15079947/obviously-ambiguous-call-does-not-cause-a-compilation-error-on-gcc
@TITLE:Obviously ambiguous call does not cause a compilation error on GCC
@CONTENT:I was surprised by the fact that GCC does not consider the call to foo() in the following program ambiguous: #include <iostream>

struct B1 { bool foo(bool) { return true; } };
struct B2 { bool foo(bool) { return false; } };

struct C : public B1, public B2
{
    using B1::foo;
    using B2::foo;
};

int main()
{
    C c;

    // Compiles and prints `true` on GCC 4.7.2 and GCC 4.8.0 (beta);
    // does not compile on Clang 3.2 and ICC 13.0.1;
    std::cout << std::boolalpha << c.foo(true);
}
 The above function call compiles and returns true on GCC 4.7.2 and GCC 4.8.0 (beta), while it won't compile (as I would expect) on Clang 3.2 and ICC 13.0.1. Is this a case of "no diagnostic required", or is it a bug in GCC? References to the C++11 Standard are encouraged.
@CODE:foo() #include <iostream>

struct B1 { bool foo(bool) { return true; } };
struct B2 { bool foo(bool) { return false; } };

struct C : public B1, public B2
{
    using B1::foo;
    using B2::foo;

@CONTENT:How do I get the play length of an ogg file without downloading the whole file? I know this is posible because both the HTML5 tag and VLC can show the entire play length immediately after loading the URL, without downloading the entire file. Is there a header or something I can read. Maybe even the bitrate, which I can divide by the file size to get an approximate play length?

@LINK:/questions/14782342/expand-in-a-projection-select-for-wcf-data-services-odata
@TITLE:Expand in a Projection (Select) for WCF Data Services (OData)
@CONTENT:Say I have an OData query that looks like this (My actual query is much more complex): Orders.Select(z => new { z.SubOrder.Addresses,
                         z.SubOrder.Cost,
                         z.SubOrder.SubOrderId, 
                         z.Sequence});
 This works fine. Except that the Address object has a sub object on it (StateRef). Since StateRef does a look-up on the State table, it is returned as null. To illustrate, here is an example of how the address object Address might look: Address:
    string         Street 1
    string         Street 2
    StateRef       PrimaryState
    string         City
    // ... 42 other string attributes not shown ...
 The StateRef object has the name of the state on it, but also has some other important State properties (maybe state bird?) So, what I am wondering is, do I have to now create a "sub projection" for z.SubOrder.Addresses that contains all 46 attributes just so that I can access the PrimaryState item? (I Hope NOT) Aside from being way more coding, it also means I have to use anonymous types. Which makes my mapping have to be by hand (instead of using AutoMapper). So what I am looking for is a way to "Expand" the StateRef inside the projection? Something like this: Orders.Select(z => new { z.SubOrder.Addresses.Expand("PrimaryState"),
                         z.SubOrder.Cost,        ^

@CONTENT:Say I have a lazy sequence like the following: (def s (iterate inc 1))

=> (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10)
 Now, I want to generate a sequence of cumulative sum of s like the following: => (1 3 6 10 15 ...)
 How can I do this? What I tried is to use atom and accumulate the sum to it(mutating) Is this the only way to generate cumulative sequence or is there a better way to do this? NOTE: the above cumulative sum is only an example. The source sequence can be other sequence. So I can't use formula: s(n) = n(n+1)/2
@CODE:(def s (iterate inc 1))
(take 10 s)

How can I prevent the garbage collection for this reference until the unmanaged code finished it's work without to declare voxelArr as global variable? Creating a copy of array isn't an option as there is really a lot of data. Active wait inside of startCalc() isn't good too.

@LINK:/questions/14565881/is-null-this-an-acceptable-use-of-extension-methods
@TITLE:Is null this an acceptable use of extension methods? [closed]
@CONTENT:So, I really enjoy using extension methods.. maybe a bit too much. So, I'm going to ask about my latest enjoyment to ensure that I'm not going too far. Scenario is that we have a Guid? variable that gets passed in. If the variable is null or Guid.Empty, then we want to use a different Guid. So, I wrote an extension method to make it read like English:     internal static Guid OrIfEmpty(this Guid? guid, Guid other)
    {
        if (!guid.HasValue || guid.Value == Guid.Empty)
        {
            return other;
        }
        return guid.Value;
    }
 This automatically implies that a "null this" will not throw an exception. For instance, this will work: ((Guid?)null).OrIfEmpty(other);
 This is not possible without using extension methods, and in my opinion can be quite misleading. However, it's just so concise and clean! So, what do you think? Is this an acceptable thing to do or could it be too confusing to other programmers? Also, I'm sure there will be other scenarios where I do things like this and checking this for null, but this is the best example I have right now. Note: I'm not really asking about this Guid? business in particular. I'm asking more about the overall pattern implemented (having an extension method where the this can be null)
@CODE:Guid? Guid.Empty internal static Guid OrIfEmpty(this Guid? guid, Guid other)
    {
        if (!guid.HasValue || guid.Value == Guid.Empty)
        {
            return other;
        }
        return guid.Value;
    } ((Guid?)null).OrIfEmpty(other); this Guid? this null (Guid?)null Nullable<Guid> Guid.Empty ?? object ((object)null).MyExtension()

@LINK:/questions/14512771/how-do-i-migrate-postgresql-strings-to-a-text-type
@TITLE:How do I migrate PostgreSQL strings to a text type?
@CONTENT:We're using a JPA annotated type that looks like this (groovy code): @Entity
@EqualsAndHashCode
class TextNote extends Serializable {
    @Id Long id
    String text
}
 When it was first written I was very new to JPA and wrote the SQL first, then made the annotated classes match the SQL. Reading up on PostgreSQL it seemed like the following was the table I wanted: CREATE TABLE textnote (
    id bigint NOT NULL,
    text text
);
 This worked, and we had tables that looked like this:  id  |          text
-----+------------------------
 837 | really long text here
 What I want to do now is correct the JPA Entity to look like this: @Entity
@EqualsAndHashCode
class TextNote extends Serializable {
    @Id Long id
    @Lob String text
}
 By adding the @Lob annotation the JPA provider (in my case, hibernate) could generate the DDL correctly for me in case we want to swap out databases. It also documents exactly what I want the text field to be. Now when a note gets created I see something like this:  id  |          text
-----+------------------------
 837 | 33427
 Which is fine for new notes, as when I read it in code using String getText() it returns the really long text. Honestly I don't know how PostgreSQL implements the text type, nor should I need to in theory. However our production database already has many notes stored using old code without the @Lob annotation. Running the new code on an existing database generates issues like this: org.springframework.dao.DataIntegrityViolationException: Bad value for type long : not a number this time; SQL [n/a]; nested exception is org.hibernate.exception.DataException: Bad value for type long : not a number this time
 For existing notes, is there a way in SQL to migrate the old notes to use @Lob and text type correctly? Thanks in advance.

 It appears to me the moment code gets hit and XDebug notices it, PHPUnit will include it in the code coverage no matter what. The downside for me with this is, that this code is already tested by Symfony developers, so no need to include it in my coverage report, messing up my numbers :P

@TITLE:WindowsAzure.Storage v2 StorageException
@CONTENT:I'm migrating from WindowsAzure.StorageClient 1.7 to WindowsAzure.Storage 2.0, and I'm working right now on the management of the exceptions. Following this guide and other sources, I found out I had to migrate from try

    {
        case StorageErrorCode.ContainerNotFound:

 Looks simple. The problem is ExtendedErrorInformation is always equal to null. The HttpStatusMessage instead says 'The specified blob does not exist.', as it should. I thought it was caused by the simulator of the test environment, but trying it in a real Azure environment drived me to the same situation. Any idea?

Similar questions have been asked before on this site (see e.g. Is it possible to decompile a Windows .exe?

In order to facilitate answers that are based in fact, I am including compiled code for a mystery function, and I propose that answers to this question measure the success or failure of the proposed techniques by whether they can determine what this function does. This may be unusual for SO but I think it's the best way to get "good subjective" or factual answers to this engineering question. Therefore, What is your best guess at what this function is doing, and how? This is the compiled code, compiled on Mac OSX with gcc: _mystery:

X = _G189
Y = [1, 2|_G189]
 Could you please help me understand? By the way, I got the above example from some tutorials, but when I run it in SWI-Prolog version 6, I get the following: ?- append([1,2],X,Y).

@TITLE:How do I create Android test suite which only runs specified tests in one or more classes?
@CONTENT:Can someone shed some light on how to organize tests in test suites, using JUnit in Android? I find almost all examples to be non-working, and I'm wondering what it is that I'm not getting. I've made a small example with an AndroidTestCase class containing a couple of tests, and a test suite which includes all the tests in the package. This works (apparently): The test case class containing the tests: public class ArithmeticsTest extends AndroidTestCase {
    SomeClass sctest;

    protected void setUp () throws Exception {
        sctest = new SomeClass();       
        super.setUp();
    }


    /* Test the SomeClass.addNumbers (int, int) method: */
    public void testAddNumbers () {
        assertEquals(9, sctest.addNumbers(3, 6));
    }

    /* Test the SomeClass.addNumbers (int, int) method: */
    public void testSubtractNumbers () {
        assertEquals(2, sctest.subtractNumbers(6, 4));
    }


    protected void tearDown () throws Exception {
        super.tearDown();
    }
}
 The test suite class including all the tests in the package: import junit.framework.Test;
import android.test.suitebuilder.TestSuiteBuilder;

public class ProjectTestSuite_AllTests {
    public static Test suite () {
        return new TestSuiteBuilder(ProjectTestSuite_AllTests.class)
            .includeAllPackagesUnderHere()
            .build();
    }
}
 As mentioned, this works. However, if I have many test cases, both classes with several tests, and other classes with other tests (it makes sense to organize different types of tests, imo), then I'd like to create test suites that include specific tests for specific classes etc, so they can be run exclusively. I've seen examples on this, but I've not gotten anyone to work. Does anyone have a good example? That is, a new test suite which includes specific test cases from one or more of the test case classes. Update: The following two examples work: Run all the tests in the package: public static Test suite () {
    return new TestSuiteBuilder(ProjectTestSuite_AllTests.class)
    .includeAllPackagesUnderHere()
    .build();
}
 Run all the tests in a specific class of tests (AndroidTestCase class): public static Test suite () {
    Class testClass = ArithmeticsTests.class;
    TestSuite suite = new TestSuite(testClass);

    return suite;
}
 However, this does NOT work: public static Test suite () {
    TestSuite suite= new TestSuite();
    suite.addTest(new ArithmeticsTest("testAddNumbers"));
    suite.addTest(new ArithmeticsTest("testSubtractNumbers"));

    return suite;
}
 The last (non-working) example is from developer.android.com. The error I get when trying this is: The constructor ArithmeticsTests(String) is undefined Which is strange, since I'm not trying to access a constructor, but name a specific test method in the test case class (testAddNumbers). UPDATE Jan. 11: Here's the test case class containing a couple of tests: public class ArithmeticsTests extends AndroidTestCase {
    SomeClass sctest;

    protected void setUp () throws Exception {
        sctest = new SomeClass();
        super.setUp();
    }

    public void testAddNumbers () {
        assertEquals(9, sctest.addNumbers(3, 6));
    }

    public void testSubtractNumbers () {
        assertEquals(2, sctest.subtractNumbers(6, 4));
    }

    protected void tearDown () throws Exception {
        super.tearDown();
    }
}
 And here's the test suite class in which I try to include (f.ex.) ONE of the tests in the above class: public class ProjectTestSuite_SomeTests {

    public static Test suite () {
        // This does not work:
        TestSuite suite= new TestSuite();
        suite.addTest(new ArithmeticsTests("testAddNumbers"));
        return suite;
    }
}
 The addTest line above results in this error: The constructor ArithmeticsTests(String) is undefined Here's the SomeClass file I try to test in this example: public class SomeClass {

    int     classInt;
    String  classString;
    Item    item;

    public SomeClass () {}

    public SomeClass (int ci, String cs) {
        this.classInt    = ci;
        this.classString = cs;
    }

        return num1+num2;
    }

    public int subtractNumbers (int num1, int num2) {
        return num1-num2;

}

@TITLE:Awful MSMQ Performance Using ReceiveById
@CONTENT:Just 20 message per second! That is all I got! Here is the code that peeks 50 message from queue and receives them in parallel using ReceiveById. Total number of messages in queue is 500. I have tested other numbers too. But the top limit is 20 message per second! Am I somewhere totally out of the way? Edit 1: 1 - I need the queue to be recoverable. BUT the interesting part is even if I set the recoverable option to false; still the top limit is 20 message/sec. 2 - I am forced to use MSMQ here because there are some legacy apps involved. But if this code is correct and this top 20 limit really exists I can persuade the group to switch. So any recommendation (based on actual experience) for replacing MSMQ is really welcome (And please note that we need to persist our messages in case of any failure of any kind). 3 - I have set the number of threads in ThreadPool to a high number in case it helps but actually in this code it will cause 100 - 200 threads be created. I have tested different number from 50 to 10000 and no difference made. 4 - In each task a new MessageQueue created because ReceiveById is not thread safe. 5 - As one can see in the code the message size is very low; it's just a string plus an int. Edit 2: [Very Strange New Result] I've played with every bit of this code and found this: if I comment out the line singleLocal.UseJournalQueue = false; in my task, I can read up to 1200 messages per second. Not impressive but acceptable in my case. The strange part is the default value of UseJournalQueue is false; why setting it to false again should make such difference in performance? static partial class Program

@TITLE:How to read binary file with unicode filename c++?
@CONTENT:In the project I'm working on, I deal with quite a few string manipulations; strings are read from binary files along with their encoding (which can be single or double byte). Essentially, I read the string value as vector<char>, read the encoding and then convert all strings to wstring, for consistency. This works reasonably well, however the filenames themselves can be double-byte chars. I'm totally stumped on how to actually open the input stream. In C I would use _wfopen function passing wchar_t* path, but wifstream seems to behave differently, as it's specifically designed for reading double-byte chars from a file, not for reading single bytes from a file with double-byte filename. What is the solution to this problem? Edit: Searching the net, it looks like there's no support for this at all in standard C++ (e.g. see this discussion). However I'm wondering if C++11 actually adds something useful in this area.

@TITLE:Serially process XML data in perl
@CONTENT:I'm wondering which XML parser people thing would be best in my situation for Perl. I've done a lot of reading and have tried the XML::LibXML and XML::SAX. The first used up too much memory and the second didn't appear to be that quick to me (even after switching off the pure perl parser). My needs are fairly specific. I am receiving a largish response of up to 50MB via the Net::SSH library. I would like to pass this data to an XML library as I receive it so as to keep the minimum amount of data in memory. I need to then look for data in certain tags and do whatever with it, in some cases sum a bunch of values, in other cases just extract values and write them to files or whatever. So I need an XML parser that can work serially, works quick and uses the minimum of memory. The data I get is in chunks of up to 1024 bytes so I would like to be able to just do something like $myparser->sendData($mynewData) and then have functions called when a new tag is opened or closed similar to what XML::SAX does. I don't necessarily need XPath or XSLT.

@TITLE:Detect direction of UIScrollView scroll in scrollViewWillBeginDragging
@CONTENT:I did google enough, & I did check posts like these ( iphone sdk: finding the direction of scrolling in UIScrollView ) in stackoverflow before posting this. I have a dynamic number of photos in an iPhone App, that am displaying through UIScrollView. At any point in time, I have only 3 photos being displayed in the scroll-view. When I have, say 4 photos, in total: 1st photo : displayed at offset 0.0 2nd photo : displayed at offset 320.0 3rd photo : displayed at offset 640.0 Now, when the user scrolls to the 4th photo, the scroll-view resets to 0.0 offset. If the user tries to scroll 'beyond' the 4th photo, scrolling should stop in the right-direction only (so that user doesn't scroll 'beyond'). But currently, the user 'is able' to scroll beyond the last photo ; however, I detect this programmatically & reset the offset. But it doesn't look neat, as the user sees the black background momentarily. I want to detect that the user has started scrolling 'right' (remember, scrolling 'left' i.e. to the 'previous' photo is okay) in scrollViewWillBeginDragging, so that I can stop any further scrolling to the right. What I tried: Trying using self.scrollView.panGestureRecognizer's translationInView isn't working, because there is no panGestureRecognizer instance returned in the first place (!), though the UIScrollView API claims so. Detecting this in scrollViewDidEndDecelerating is possible, though it'll not serve my purpose.

@LINK:/questions/14004000/is-there-a-workaround-to-c-sharp-not-being-able-to-infer-generic-type-arguments
@TITLE:Is there a workaround to C# not being able to infer generic type arguments using type constraints?
@CONTENT:Eric Lippert has explained in his blog post at http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/2009/12/10/constraints-are-not-part-of-the-signature.aspx why constraints are not considered for type inference, which makes sense given that methods cannot be overloaded by simply changing type constraints. However, I would like to find a way to instantiate an object using two generic types, one which can be inferred and another which could be inferred if constraints were considered, without having to specify any of the types. Given the types: public interface I<T>
{
    Other<T> CreateOther();
}

public class C : I<string>
{
    public Other<string> CreateOther()
    {
        return new Other<string>();
    }
}

public class Other<T>
{
}
 and the factory: public static class Factory1
{
    public static Tuple<T, Other<T1>> Create<T, T1>(T o) where T : I<T1>
    {
        return new Tuple<T, Other<T1>>(o, o.CreateOther());
    }
}
 the following desired code will not compile:     public void WontCompile()
    {
        C c = new C();
        var v = Factory1.Create(c); // won't compile
    }
 The error message is "error CS0411: The type arguments for method 'yo.Factory1.Create(T)' cannot be inferred from the usage. Try specifying the type arguments explicitly.", which is in line with what Eric said in his blog post. Thus, we can simply specify the generic type arguments explicitly, as the error message suggests:     public void SpecifyAllTypes()
    {
        C c = new C();
        var v = Factory1.Create<C, string>(c); // type is Tuple<C, Other<string>>
    }
 If we don't wish to specify type arguments and we don't need to retain type C, we can use the following factory: public static class Factory2
{
    public static Tuple<I<T1>, Other<T1>> CreateUntyped<T1>(I<T1> o)
    {
        return new Tuple<I<T1>, Other<T1>>(o, o.CreateOther());
    }
}
 and now specify:     public void Untyped()
    {
        C c = new C();
        var v = Factory2.CreateUntyped(c); // type is Tuple<I<string>, Other<string>>
    }
 However, I wish to retain type C in the returned object and not specify the types.
@CODE:public interface I<T>
{
    Other<T> CreateOther();
}

public class C : I<string>
{
    public Other<string> CreateOther()
    {
        return new Other<string>();
    }
}

public class Other<T>
{
} public static class Factory1
{
    public static Tuple<T, Other<T1>> Create<T, T1>(T o) where T : I<T1>
    {
        return new Tuple<T, Other<T1>>(o, o.CreateOther());
    }
} public void WontCompile()
    {
        C c = new C();
        var v = Factory1.Create(c); // won't compile
    } public void SpecifyAllTypes()
    {
        C c = new C();
        var v = Factory1.Create<C, string>(c); // type is Tuple<C, Other<string>>
    } public static class Factory2
{
    public static Tuple<I<T1>, Other<T1>> CreateUntyped<T1>(I<T1> o)
    {
        return new Tuple<I<T1>, Other<T1>>(o, o.CreateOther());
    }
} public void Untyped()
    {
        C c = new C();
        var v = Factory2.CreateUntyped(c); // type is Tuple<I<string>, Other<string>>

 Output generated by above code is as follows: {"roots":[{"__Ref":true,"rule":3,"object":0}],"data":[[],[],[],[["Seattle","N 34th"]]],"rules":"{\"roots\":[{\"__Ref\":true,\"rule\":1,\"object\":0}],\"data\":[[],[[{\"__Ref\":true,\"rule\":4,\"object\":0},{\"__Ref\":true,\"rule\":3,\"object\":0},{\"__Ref\":true,\"rule\":5,\"object\":0},{\"__Ref\":true,\"rule\":6,\"object\":0}]],[[],[],[\"city\",\"street\"]],[[]],[[]],[[]],[[{\"__Ref\":true,\"rule\":2,\"object\":0},{\"__Ref\":true,\"rule\":2,\"object\":1},\"\",{\"__Ref\":true,\"rule\":2,\"object\":2},{\"__Ref\":true,\"rule\":7,\"object\":0}]],[\"Address\"]],\"rules\":null}"}
@CODE:var address = new Address();
address.street = 'N 34th';
address.city = 'Seattle';
var serialization = new Serialization()
 ..addRuleFor(address);
String output = serialization.write(address); address: {'street':'N 34th', 'city':'Seattle'} {"roots":[{"__Ref":true,"rule":3,"object":0}],"data":[[],[],[],[["Seattle","N 34th"]]],"rules":"{\"roots\":[{\"__Ref\":true,\"rule\":1,\"object\":0}],\"data\":[[],[[{\"__Ref\":true,\"rule\":4,\"object\":0},{\"__Ref\":true,\"rule\":3,\"object\":0},{\"__Ref\":true,\"rule\":5,\"object\":0},{\"__Ref\":true,\"rule\":6,\"object\":0}]],[[],[],[\"city\",\"street\"]],[[]],[[]],[[]],[[{\"__Ref\":true,\"rule\":2,\"object\":0},{\"__Ref\":true,\"rule\":2,\"object\":1},\"\",{\"__Ref\":true,\"rule\":2,\"object\":2},{\"__Ref\":true,\"rule\":7,\"object\":0}]],[\"Address\"]],\"rules\":null}"}

@CONTENT:I call CookieManager.getInstance().removeAllCookie() in onCreate in my app. I'm running into a weird issue where I'm seeing an unexpected cookie value get passed up in a GET request. In fact, the cookie value is a really, really old value. Here are the steps I perform for the test: Install the app Make a GET request on app launch. Request should be clean: no cookies should be sent up. GET request responds with a Set-Cookie. The value is based on the request time, so there's a very small chance this value is the same on any two requests. Make another GET request. Request should send up cookie value from step 3. The first time I installed the app, the cookie behavior worked as I expected above. I uninstalled the app, then re-installed it, and the cookie behavior, again, worked as expected. I do this a few times, things are fine and dandy. Then, suddenly, on the Nth install, step 2 doesn't pass. The very first GET request isn't clean. In fact, it's comes in with a value that was set on the first install of the app. I can't reproduce this problem reliably, but I do see it quite often. It's not that the first GET request on install is sending up a cookie value from the immediately previous install -- the value is from three or four previous installs which were all followed by uninstalls. How is it possible that I'm seeing this? How can I actually remove all of the app's cookies?

@TITLE:Idiomatic Scala for Nested Options
@CONTENT:Lets say I have an Element object (from JDom actually). It might have a child element called "Group", or it might not. If it does, then it might have an attribute called "ID", or again it might not. I want the ID value if it exists. If Java I would write. private String getId(Element e) {
  for (Element child : e.getChildren()) 
    if (child.getName().equals("Group")) 
      for (Attribute a : child.getAttributes()) 
        if (a.getName().equals("ID"))

@TITLE:Why does using ConfigurationManager.GetSection cause SecurityException: Request failed but ConfigurationManager.OpenExeConfiguration does not?
@CONTENT:I have something curious that I am hoping a .Net expert can help me with. I have a custom configuration section and to get hold of it I do this: var s = (TestConfigurationSection)ConfigurationManager
    .GetSection("testSection");
 I run that on my development machine (Windows 7, 64 bit, Windows completely up to date) and it works fine. I take the exe with that code in and I put it in a directory inside c:\users\public on a Windows Server 2008 R2 machine, open up a command prompt as administrator, run it and I get: System.Configuration.ConfigurationErrorsException: An error occurred creating the configuration section handler for testSection: Request failed. (C:\Users\Public\configtest\AppConfigTestConsoleApplication.exe.Config line 10) ---> System.Security.SecurityException: Request failed. Now I changed that code to do this: var config = ConfigurationManager.OpenExeConfiguration(
    ConfigurationUserLevel.None);
var s = (TestConfigurationSection) config
    .GetSection("testSection");
 and it works fine on both machines. So, I am moderately happy (in as much as my application is working) but that little Gremlin in my head is confused so I ask here: Why is this the case? Steps to reproduce Create a new .net 4 Console application project called AppConfigTestConsoleApplication in visual studio 2010 and replace the contents of Program.cs with the following: using System;
using System.Configuration;

namespace AppConfigTestConsoleApplication
{
    public class TestConfigurationSection : ConfigurationSection
    {
        [ConfigurationProperty("someSetting")]
        public int SomeSetting
        {
            get { return (int) this["someSetting"]; }
            set { this["someSetting"] = value; }
        }
    }

    internal class Program
    {
        private static void Main()
        {
            try
            {
                var s = (TestConfigurationSection) ConfigurationManager
                    .GetSection("testSection");
                Console.WriteLine("First Method worked: " + s.SomeSetting);
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("First method failed");
                Console.WriteLine(ex.ToString());

                if (ex.InnerException != null)
                {
                    var eex = ex.InnerException as SecurityException;
                    Console.WriteLine("Action: '{0}'", eex.Action.ToString());
                    Console.WriteLine("Demanded: '{0}'", eex.Demanded.ToString());
                    Console.WriteLine("RefusedSet: '{0}'", eex.RefusedSet);
                    Console.WriteLine("GrantedSet: '{0}'", eex.GrantedSet);
                }

                try
                {
                    var config = ConfigurationManager.OpenExeConfiguration(
                        ConfigurationUserLevel.None);

                    var s = (TestConfigurationSection) config
                        .GetSection("testSection");

                    Console.WriteLine("Second Method worked: " 
                        + s.SomeSetting);
                }
                catch (Exception x)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine("Even the second method failed!");
                    Console.WriteLine(ex.ToString());
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
 Then add an application configuration file and replace the contents with the following: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<configuration>
  <configSections>  
    <section
      name="testSection"
      type="AppConfigTestConsoleApplication.TestConfigurationSection, AppConfigTestConsoleApplication"
      requirePermission="false"
      allowDefinition="Everywhere" />  
  </configSections>
  <testSection someSetting="10"></testSection>
</configuration>
 Compile and run and this is the output I got: C:\Users\Public\configtest>AppConfigTestConsoleApplication.exe
First method failed

@TITLE:Ruby attr_accessor vs. getter/setter benchmark: why is accessor faster?
@CONTENT:I just tested attr_accessor against equivalent getter/setter-methods: class A
  # we define two R/W attributes with accessors
  attr_accessor :acc, :bcc

end

varA   = A.new
startT = 0
dirT   = 0
accT   = 0

# now we do 100 times the same benchmarking
# where we do the same assignment operation
# 50000 times
100.times do
  startT = Time.now.to_f
  50000.times do |i|
    varA.dirA = i

puts "direct:   %10.4fs" % (dirT/100)

@TITLE:AngularJS service not invoking error callback on save() method
@CONTENT:So I'm using angularjs restful service $resource and I'm calling $save function. However, the error callback I pass to it is not being called. The server is sending a 418 error which I thought since it's NOT 200 would result in the error callback being invoked. But, it never does. I can't find any documentation stating what http error codes will result in the error callback being called. Here is my code: var modalScope = $scope.$new();
modalScope.showPassword = false;
modalScope.message = null;
modalScope.user = new User();

modalScope.submit = function(user) {
    user.$save( {}, function(data,headers) {
        // do the success case
    }, function(data,headers) {
        // do the error case                
    });
};
 The modalScope.user is being passed to the submit function defined. So what's the problem why this error callback isn't being called?
@CODE:var modalScope = $scope.$new();
modalScope.showPassword = false;
modalScope.message = null;
modalScope.user = new User();

modalScope.submit = function(user) {
    user.$save( {}, function(data,headers) {
        // do the success case
    }, function(data,headers) {
        // do the error case

@LINK:/questions/13070519/should-i-avoid-using-sp-getapplock
@TITLE:Should I avoid using sp_getAppLock?
@CONTENT:I have a stored procedure, and I want to ensure it cannot be executed concurrently. My (multi-threaded) application does all necessary work on the underlying table via this stored procedure. imo, locking the table itself is an unnecessarily drastic action to take, and so when I found out about sp_GetAppLock, which essentially enforces a critical section, this sounded ideal. My plan was to encase the stored procedure in a transaction and to set up spGetAppLock with transaction scope. The code was written and tested successfully. The code has now been put forward for review and I have been told that I should not call this function. However when asking the obvious question "why not?", the only reasons I am getting are highly subjective, to do with any form of locking being complicated. I don't necessarily buy this, but I was wondering whether anyone had any objective reasons why I should avoid this constuct. Like I say, given my circumstances a critical section sounds an ideal approach to me. TIA, Pete further info: An application sits on top of this with 2 threads T1 and T2. Each thread is waiting for a different message M1 and M2. The business logic involved says that processing can only happen once both M1 and M2 have arrived. The stored procedure logs that Mx has arrived (insert) and then checks whether My is present (select). The built-in locking is fine to make sure the inserts happen serially. But the selects need to happen serially too and I think I need to do something over and above the built-in functionality here. just for clarity, I want the "processing" to happen exactly once. So I can't afford for the stored procedure to return either false positives or false negatives. I'm worried that if the stored proc runs twice in very quick succession, then both "selects" might return data which indicates that it is appropriate to perform processing.

@TITLE:Model-bind POST with Array of objects in NancyFx
@CONTENT:I have a json object with the following structure {
 ContainerType: "Box",
 Items : [{Name: "Coin", Amount: 5}, {Name: "Spyglas", Amount : 1}]   
}
 This object has an representation in the Nancy backend system: public string ContainerType {get; set}
public IEnumberable<Item> Items {get; set}
 where Item (as expected) is a very simple object with public properties: public string Name {get; set;}
public double Amount {get; set;}
 My problem is that when I receive the Post in my module (based on NancyModule) only the string property is being binded in this line of code: var model = this.databind<MyContainerModel>();
 I've tried with changing list types to more specific (List<MyContainerModel>), to Arrays (MyContainerModel[]), but nothing seems to work. The data-binding examples in the demo section of the git-repo for Nancy only deals with deserialization of ints, but my question is for the deserialization of arrays with javascript objects. Any ideas? Thanks!
@CODE:{
 ContainerType: "Box",
 Items : [{Name: "Coin", Amount: 5}, {Name: "Spyglas", Amount : 1}]

I need to check if object with key "instruments" exists (please, not?, I don't know what value "instrument" is ay this time, it may contain any value or an array), and if exists - perform updation, otherwise V insert a new value. How can I do this? collection.find( {  "instruments" : { $exists : true } }, function(err, object){
    if (object) {
        //update

@TITLE:UIPageViewController has strange size
@CONTENT:I am using a UIPageViewController in my app. It works quite well, but when I turn pages, the next page seems to get initialized in a frame that is bigger than the screen: While turning the page, only a part of the view of the next viewController fits on the screen. I am initializing the UIPageViewController in viewDidLoad and started to log the frames of the PageVC, its subviews and the parentVC. Every frame seems to be okay, only the UIPageViewController's frame, which I log in viewControllerAfterViewController has a width that is nearly the double of the screen's actual size.

@TITLE:Android TCP connection best practice
@CONTENT:I am working on an Android application that requires a TCP connection to a TCP server(Written in Node.js) My Android TCP client is working an can send messages back and forth. My spesific questions is: What is the best way to handle a TCP connection to a server in Android ? How to maintain the connection(close the connection properly on onDestroy() etc) ? Is there any bether way then using an AsyncTask(Except a normal Thread class, which is not allowed in Android 4.0) I have my socket connection in an AsyncTask like this: @Override
protected Void doInBackground(Void... params) {
        try {
            Log.d("TCP_MESSAGE", "Connecting...");

                socket = new Socket(MY_LOCAL_IP, 8080);
                dataOutput = new DataOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream());

                inputstream = new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream());
                input = new BufferedReader(inputstream);


            while (!canceled) {

        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
    return null;
}
 The reason i have the connection in an AsyncTask is because i am using android 4.0 and are not allowed to have network code in a regular Thread.

        try {

@CONTENT:I wonder why neo4j has a Capacity Limit on Nodes and Relationships. The limit on Nodes and Relationships is 2^35 1 which is a "little" bit more then the "normal" 2^32 integer. Common SQL Databases for example mysql stores there primary key as int(2^32) or bigint(2^64)2. Can you explain me the advantages of this decision? In my opinion this is a key decision point when choosing a database.

 But I am not defining anything in my second code snippet. I am merely declaring variable b. So why is JSLint doing this? Is there a reason I should be declaring all my functions first? PS I understand I could have just changed order of a and b, but in real project my functions are event handlers and sometimes they call each other, so it is probably not possible.

@TITLE:How to set timeout for NHibernate LINQ statement
@CONTENT:I am using Fluent NHibernate for my ORM. In doing so I am trying to use the NHibernate LINQ syntax to fetch a set of data with the power of LINQ. The code I have works and executes correctly with the exception being that a timeout is thrown if it takes longer than roughly 30 seconds to run. The question I have is how do I extend the default 30 second timeout for LINQ statements via NHibernate? I have already seen the posts here, here, and here but the first two refer to setting the DataContext's Timeout property, which does not apply here, and the third refers to setting the timeout in XML, which also does not apply because I am using Fluent NHibernate to generate the XML on the fly. Not only that but the post is 2 years old and Fluent NHibernate has changed since. With the ICriteria objects and even HQL I can specify the timeout, however that is not the goal here. I would like to know how to set that same timeout and use LINQ. Example code:     using (var session = SessionFactory.OpenSession())
    using (var transaction = session.BeginTransaction())
    {
        var query = (from mem in session.Query<Member>()
                     select mem);
        query = query.Where({where statement});
        int start = (currentPage - 1) * max);
        if (start > 0)
            query = query.Skip(start).Take(max);
        else
            query = query.Take(max);

        var list = query.ToList();
        transaction.Commit();
        return list;
    }
 This code (where statement does not matter) works for all purposes except where a timeout occurs. Any help is appreciated. Thanks in advance!
@CODE:using (var session = SessionFactory.OpenSession())
    using (var transaction = session.BeginTransaction())
    {

@CONTENT:The Windows 8 simulator which comes with Visual Studio 2012 does not launch either via debugging in Visual Studio or by running it directly. As the simulator used remote desktop (RDP) and the issue occurs within Visual Studio & if I start it directly. I have identified that if my VPN is NOT enabled, then the simulator works fine. Thus I believe the issue is between VPN & RDP. In the event log for RDP (Application and service logs - Microsoft - Windows - TerminalServices-RDPClient) I see the following message: RDP ClientActiveX has been disconnected (Reason= 5639) Reason 5639 is The policy does not support delegation of credentials to the target server. Are there any policies in group policy that I can change to enable delegation of credentials? I have also tried turning off the firewall, setting RDP to all users and running the simulator as administrator but none of those options have helped.

@LINK:/questions/12879298/create-an-alias-directory-inside-a-virtual-host
@TITLE:Create an Alias Directory inside a Virtual Host
@CONTENT:I checked here, here, here, here, and here before asking this question. I guess my search skills are weak. I am using the WampServer version 2.2e. I have a need like, I need a virtual path inside a virtual host. Let me say the two hosts that I have. Primary Virtual Host (Localhost) NameVirtualHost *:80

<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName localhost
    DocumentRoot "C:/Wamp/www"
</VirtualHost>
 My Apps Virtual Hosts <VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName apps.ptrl
    DocumentRoot "C:/Wamp/vhosts/ptrl/apps"
    ErrorLog "logs/apps-ptrl-error.log"
    CustomLog "logs/apps-ptrl-access.log" common
    <Directory "C:/Wamp/vhosts/ptrl/apps">
        allow from all
        order allow,deny
        AllowOverride All
    </Directory>
    DirectoryIndex index.html index.htm index.php
</VirtualHost>
 My Blog Virtual Host <VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName blog.praveen-kumar.ptrl
    DocumentRoot "C:/Wamp/vhosts/ptrl/praveen-kumar/blog"
    ErrorLog "logs/praveen-kumar-ptrl-error.log"
    CustomLog "logs/praveen-kumar-ptrl-access.log" common
    <Directory "C:/Wamp/vhosts/ptrl/praveen-kumar/blog">
        allow from all
        order allow,deny
        AllowOverride All
    </Directory>
    DirectoryIndex index.html index.htm index.php
</VirtualHost>
 My requirement now is to have http://apps.ptrl/blog/ and http://blog.praveen-kumar.ptrl/ should be the same directory. One thing I thought of is, moving the blog folder inside the apps folder, but it is connected with Git and other stuffs are there, so it is not possible to move the folder. So, I thought of creating an alias to the VirtualHost in this way: <VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName apps.ptrl
    DocumentRoot "C:/Wamp/vhosts/ptrl/apps"
    ErrorLog "logs/apps-ptrl-error.log"
    CustomLog "logs/apps-ptrl-access.log" common
    <Directory "C:/Wamp/vhosts/ptrl/apps">
        allow from all
        order allow,deny
        AllowOverride All
    </Directory>
    DirectoryIndex index.html index.htm index.php

    # The alias to the blog!
    Alias /blog "C:/Wamp/vhosts/ptrl/praveen-kumar/blog"
    <Directory "C:/Wamp/vhosts/ptrl/praveen-kumar/blog">
        allow from all
        order allow,deny
        AllowOverride All
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
 But when I tried to access http://apps.ptrl/blog, I am getting an Error 403 Forbidden page. Am I doing the right thing? If you need to look at the access log, and error log, they are here: # Access Log

 Waiting eagerly for some help. I am ready to provide more info, if needed. Update #1: Changed VirtualHosts declaration according to the instructions given by felipsmartins: <VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName apps.ptrl

 Update #2: Another Issue: I am able to access the site. The physical links are working now. i.e., I am able to open http://apps.ptrl/blog/index.php but not http://apps.ptrl/blog/view-1.ptf, which gets translated to http://apps.ptrl/blog/index.php?page=view&id=1. Any solutions?

@LINK:/questions/12759430/play-bind-a-form-field-to-a-double
@TITLE:Play: Bind a form field to a double?
@CONTENT:Perhaps I'm just overlooking something obvious but I can't figure out how to bind a form field to a double in a Play controller. For instance, assume this is my model: case class SavingsGoal(
timeframeInMonths: Option[Int],
amount: Double,
name: String
)
 (Ignore that I'm using a double for money, I know that's a bad idea, this is just a simplified example) And I wanted to bind it like so: object SavingsGoals extends Controller {

    val savingsForm: Form[SavingsGoal] = Form(

        mapping(
            "timeframeInMonths" -> optional(number.verifying(min(0))),
            "amount" -> of[Double],
            "name" -> nonEmptyText
        )(SavingsGoal.apply)(SavingsGoal.unapply)

    )

}
 I realized that the number helper only works for ints but I thought using of[] might allow me to bind a double. However, I get a compiler error on this: Cannot find Formatter type class for Double. Perhaps you will need to import
play.api.data.format.Formats._  
 Doing so doesn't help as there's no double formatter defined in the API. This is all just a long way of asking what's the canonical way of binding a form field to a double in Play? Thanks! edit: 4e6 pointed me in the right direction. Here's what I did using his help: Using the snippets in his link, I added the following to app.controllers.Global.scala: object Global {

    /**
     * Default formatter for the `Double` type.
     */
    implicit def doubleFormat: Formatter[Double] = new Formatter[Double] {

      override val format = Some("format.real", Nil)

      def bind(key: String, data: Map[String, String]) =
        parsing(_.toDouble, "error.real", Nil)(key, data)

      def unbind(key: String, value: Double) = Map(key -> value.toString)
    }

    /**
     * Helper for formatters binders
     * @param parse Function parsing a String value into a T value, throwing an exception in case of failure
     * @param error Error to set in case of parsing failure
     * @param key Key name of the field to parse
     * @param data Field data
     */
    private def parsing[T](parse: String => T, errMsg: String, errArgs: Seq[Any])(key: String, data: Map[String, String]): Either[Seq[FormError], T] = {
      stringFormat.bind(key, data).right.flatMap { s =>
        util.control.Exception.allCatch[T]
          .either(parse(s))
          .left.map(e => Seq(FormError(key, errMsg, errArgs)))
      }
    }

}
 Then, in my form mapping: mapping(
    "amount" -> of(Global.doubleFormat)
)
@CODE:case class SavingsGoal(
timeframeInMonths: Option[Int],
amount: Double,
name: String
) object SavingsGoals extends Controller {

    val savingsForm: Form[SavingsGoal] = Form(

        mapping(
            "timeframeInMonths" -> optional(number.verifying(min(0))),
            "amount" -> of[Double],
            "name" -> nonEmptyText
        )(SavingsGoal.apply)(SavingsGoal.unapply)

    )

} number of[] Cannot find Formatter type class for Double. Perhaps you will need to import
play.api.data.format.Formats._ object Global {

    /**
     * Default formatter for the `Double` type.
     */
    implicit def doubleFormat: Formatter[Double] = new Formatter[Double] {

      override val format = Some("format.real", Nil)

      def bind(key: String, data: Map[String, String]) =
        parsing(_.toDouble, "error.real", Nil)(key, data)

      def unbind(key: String, value: Double) = Map(key -> value.toString)
    }

@TITLE:The definitive PHP url parser
@CONTENT:Before you tell me to use parse_url, it's not nearly good enough and has too many bugs. There are many questions on the subject of parsing URLs be found on here, but nearly all are to parse only some specific class of URLs or are otherwise incomplete. I'm looking for a definitive RFC-compliant URL parser in PHP that will reliably process any URL that a browser is likely to encounter. In this I include: Page-internal links #, #title Page-relative URLs blah/thing.php Site-relative URLs /blah/thing.php Anonymous-protocol URLs //ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.1/jquery.min.js Callto URLs callto:+442079460123 File URLs file:///Users/me/thisfile.txt Mailto URLs mailto:user@example.com?subject=hello, mailto:?subject=hello and support for all the usual scheme/authentication/domain/path/query/fragment etc, and break all of those elements out into an array, with extra flags for relative/schemaless URLs. Ideally it would come with a URL reconstructor (like http_build_url) supporting the same elements, and I'd also like validation to be applied (i.e. it should be able to make a best-guess interpretation of a URL if it's invalid, but flag it as such, just like browsers do). This answer contained a tantalising Fermat-style reference to such a beast, but it doesn't actually go anywhere. I've looked in all the major frameworks, but they only seem to provide thin wrappers around parse_url which is generally a bad place to start since it makes so many mistakes. So, does such a thing exist?

$('.my-element').outerHeight(true);
 How would I do this in YUI? I'm currently using version 2.8.1. Similar to this question, I can always do getComputedStyle() for height, border, padding, and margin, but that is a lot of manual labor which includes parsing the return values and grabbing the correct values that are needed and doing the math myself. Isn't there some equivalent function to jQuery's outerHeight() in YUI that does all of this for me? Solution I ended up writing my own solution since I couldn't find a jQuery outerheight() equivalent. I've posted the solution as an answer here.

@CONTENT:I love to put simple text directly on the xml file without declaring a string first. It is easier, more simple and less messy. However, it always has a warning badge whenever I do so. What if I have a dozens of hardcoded string in my xml file without concerning the warning? Will I get into a trouble? thanks in advance.

@TITLE:Can I explicitly reference a JavaScript global variable that's been shadowed by a local with the same name?
@CONTENT:I've seen tons of posts about the difference between global and function scope in JavaScript, far too many to link here. I've also seen my exact question asked about Python. So what I want to know is, how can I access a global variable when a "closer" scope also has a variable with the same name? var a = "global";
function b(){
  var a = "local";
  var magic = ...; // somehow put "global" in magic
  console.log(magic); // should print "global"
}
 In browser only, I figured out that you can use window.a to specify the global. Is there anything that works server-side as well?
@CODE:var a = "global";
function b(){
  var a = "local";
  var magic = ...; // somehow put "global" in magic

@CONTENT:In short, I need to be able to traverse Z3_ast tree and access the data associated with its nodes. Cannot seem to find any documentation/examples on how to do that. Any pointers would be helpful. At length, I need to parse smt2lib type formulae into Z3, make some variable to constant substitutions and then reproduce the formula in a data structure which is compatible with another unrelated SMT sovler (mistral to be specific, I don't think details about mistral are important to this question but funnily enough it does not have a command line interface where I can feed it text formulae. It just has a C API). I have figured that to generate the formula in mistral's format, I would need to traverse the Z3_ast tree and reconstruct the formula in the desired format. I cannot seem to find any documentation/examples that demonstrate how to do this. Any pointers would be helpful.

@TITLE:Eclipse dependent projects not copied to WTP deployment
@CONTENT:Before we started using Gradle, a multi-project (10-12) development effort within Eclipse successfully deployed, via a WTP project, to one of the internal Tomcat 7 servers. We find this very useful for development. With Gradle up and running the dependent project's jar files are no longer being copied to the ../WEB-INF/lib directory. I don't believe this has anything to do with gradle as it is completely out of the picture later on, but it is different, so I am mentioning it. Building the standalone war file works perfectly as does "gradle jettyRun". If I add the project facet "Utility Module" to the dependent projects within Eclipse then it works. However, I don't recall that this was ever done initially. Ok, this also really complicates the generation of the eclipse projects from gradle as well! I can live with it, but was wondering if anyone knew if it has to be this way or if there is some alternative. Thanks - versions: eclipse Indigo SR2, Java 1.7, Gradle 1.2

@TITLE:Difference in memory block layout allocated by malloc and calloc?
@CONTENT:calloc allocates num blocks of memory, each of size size: void * calloc ( size_t num, size_t size ); Allocate space for array in memory Allocates a block of memory for an array of num elements, each of them size bytes long, and initializes all its bits to zero. In contrast, malloc allocates one block of memory of size size: void * malloc ( size_t size ); Allocate memory block Allocates a block of size bytes of memory, returning a pointer to the beginning of the block. Is there any difference between both (except for the zero-initialization by calloc)? What does calloc means exactly by num blocks of memory as in practice the returned memory region is contiguous as well. I believe there has to be some difference, otherwise it wouldn't make much sense to define two different interfaces for these methods?

@LINK:/questions/12463800/issue-with-character-encoding-in-post-requests-sent-with-firefox
@TITLE:Issue with character encoding in POST requests sent with Firefox
@CONTENT:Recently I've come across some very strange behavior related to character encoding for AJAX calls made using the POST method. To make a long story short, I have an HTML form with text fields that can accept diacritics (e.g. "?"). When the form is submitted, the form data is wrapped in an XML block and sent to a server, which stores that information in a MySQL database. Subsequently, that information is retrieved from the database and displayed to regular users, as is. If the request is sent from Chrome or IE, everything is fine. This means that the data, including the diacritics, is sent, stored, then retrieved and displayed correctly. However, when I use Firefox for this, the XML appears to submit the form data right, but when I reload the web page, the previously sent diacritics don't appear. In other words, they seem to get lost somewhere along the way. For example, if the XML contains the word "t?st?", when I load the page I see "tst". Why is this happening? Is Firefox encoding the post messages differently from IE and Chrome? In case it helps, I've attached the request and response headers from Chrome and Firefox, for exactly the same form content - only one example: By the way, I'm not encoding the data before sending it to the server, just simply retrieving the value of the form fields, as is.

    if ($(field).val().length > maxChar){
       $(field).val($(field).val().substr(0, maxChar));
    }
}
 Event is onkeyup. When I type some text in input field cursor stays on the end of text but focus is backed on start of the text so I can't see cursor. What can be a problem. Browser is FF, on IE and chrome it is working correctly

@TITLE:How is exponentiation implemented in Python?
@CONTENT:I am able to compute any normally computable fibonnaci number (unless the result becomes to large) in a constant time using Binet's formula ie closed solution formula to compute fibonnaci numbers. Here is my code: for the non-recursive implementation of fibonnaci: gr = (1 + 5**0.5) / 2
def gfib(n):
    return int(((gr**n - (1-gr)**n) / 5**0.5))
 I understand a^n indicates exponential run time complexity, however this is not the case when the code is run in python, as this computes the nth fibonnaci number instantly. I've done some research on how exponents are implemented in python (maybe exponentiation by squaring?) to give the constant time solution that I get, but haven't found a definitive answer. Any ideas?
@CODE:gr = (1 + 5**0.5) / 2

 I'm using Boost 1.51.0, installed using BREW. Recompiling Boost using Clang does not help. Is there a solution to this mystery? ./a.out

@LINK:/questions/12687790/the-definitive-php-url-parser
@TITLE:The definitive PHP url parser
@CONTENT:Before you tell me to use parse_url, it's not nearly good enough and has too many bugs. There are many questions on the subject of parsing URLs be found on here, but nearly all are to parse only some specific class of URLs or are otherwise incomplete. I'm looking for a definitive RFC-compliant URL parser in PHP that will reliably process any URL that a browser is likely to encounter. In this I include: Page-internal links #, #title Page-relative URLs blah/thing.php Site-relative URLs /blah/thing.php Anonymous-protocol URLs //ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.1/jquery.min.js Callto URLs callto:+442079460123 File URLs file:///Users/me/thisfile.txt Mailto URLs mailto:user@example.com?subject=hello, mailto:?subject=hello and support for all the usual scheme/authentication/domain/path/query/fragment etc, and break all of those elements out into an array, with extra flags for relative/schemaless URLs. Ideally it would come with a URL reconstructor (like http_build_url) supporting the same elements, and I'd also like validation to be applied (i.e. it should be able to make a best-guess interpretation of a URL if it's invalid, but flag it as such, just like browsers do). This answer contained a tantalising Fermat-style reference to such a beast, but it doesn't actually go anywhere. I've looked in all the major frameworks, but they only seem to provide thin wrappers around parse_url which is generally a bad place to start since it makes so many mistakes. So, does such a thing exist?
@CODE:parse_url # #title blah/thing.php /blah/thing.php //ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.1/jquery.min.js callto:+442079460123 file:///Users/me/thisfile.txt mailto:user@example.com?subject=hello mailto:?subject=hello parse_url()

@TITLE:what is the jQuery outerHeight() equivalent in YUI
@CONTENT:In jQuery, I can very easily get the current computed height for an element that includes padding, border, and optionally margin by using outerHeight()... // returns height of element + border + padding + margin
$('.my-element').outerHeight(true);
 How would I do this in YUI? I'm currently using version 2.8.1. Similar to this question, I can always do getComputedStyle() for height, border, padding, and margin, but that is a lot of manual labor which includes parsing the return values and grabbing the correct values that are needed and doing the math myself. Isn't there some equivalent function to jQuery's outerHeight() in YUI that does all of this for me? Solution I ended up writing my own solution since I couldn't find a jQuery outerheight() equivalent. I've posted the solution as an answer here.

It just has a C API). I have figured that to generate the formula in mistral's format, I would need to traverse the Z3_ast tree and reconstruct the formula in the desired format.

@TITLE:Eclipse dependent projects not copied to WTP deployment
@CONTENT:Before we started using Gradle, a multi-project (10-12) development effort within Eclipse successfully deployed, via a WTP project, to one of the internal Tomcat 7 servers. We find this very useful for development. With Gradle up and running the dependent project's jar files are no longer being copied to the ../WEB-INF/lib directory. I don't believe this has anything to do with gradle as it is completely out of the picture later on, but it is different, so I am mentioning it. Building the standalone war file works perfectly as does "gradle jettyRun". If I add the project facet "Utility Module" to the dependent projects within Eclipse then it works. However, I don't recall that this was ever done initially. Ok, this also really complicates the generation of the eclipse projects from gradle as well! I can live with it, but was wondering if anyone knew if it has to be this way or if there is some alternative. Thanks - versions: eclipse Indigo SR2, Java 1.7, Gradle 1.2

In contrast, malloc allocates one block of memory of size size: void * malloc ( size_t size ); Allocate memory block Allocates a block of size bytes of memory, returning a pointer to the beginning of the block. Is there any difference between both (except for the zero-initialization by calloc)? What does calloc means exactly by num blocks of memory as in practice the returned memory region is contiguous as well. I believe there has to be some difference, otherwise it wouldn't make much sense to define two different interfaces for these methods?

@TITLE:Issue with character encoding in POST requests sent with Firefox
@CONTENT:Recently I've come across some very strange behavior related to character encoding for AJAX calls made using the POST method. To make a long story short, I have an HTML form with text fields that can accept diacritics (e.g. "?"). When the form is submitted, the form data is wrapped in an XML block and sent to a server, which stores that information in a MySQL database. Subsequently, that information is retrieved from the database and displayed to regular users, as is. If the request is sent from Chrome or IE, everything is fine. This means that the data, including the diacritics, is sent, stored, then retrieved and displayed correctly. However, when I use Firefox for this, the XML appears to submit the form data right, but when I reload the web page, the previously sent diacritics don't appear. In other words, they seem to get lost somewhere along the way. For example, if the XML contains the word "t?st?", when I load the page I see "tst". Why is this happening? Is Firefox encoding the post messages differently from IE and Chrome? In case it helps, I've attached the request and response headers from Chrome and Firefox, for exactly the same form content - only one example: By the way, I'm not encoding the data before sending it to the server, just simply retrieving the value of the form fields, as is.

@TITLE:LinkButtons in IE10 not performing posting back
@CONTENT:I'm trying to add a simple LinkButton to an ASP.NET 4 page but it's not calling the postback in IE10. The code looks like as follows. HTML: <form id="form1" runat="server">
<div>
  <asp:LinkButton ID="LinkButton1" runat="server"
    OnClick="LinkButton1_Click">LinkButton</asp:LinkButton>
  <br />
  <asp:Label ID="Label1" runat="server" Text="Label"></asp:Label>

 C#: protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) { }

protected void LinkButton1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
  Label1.Text = DateTime.Now.ToString();
}
 As you can see, it's just a plain page. However, I cannot get the LinkButton to call the method since upgrading to Win8 and IE10. This works fine with Firefox. Any ideas what I need to do?

@TITLE:How is exponentiation implemented in Python?
@CONTENT:I am able to compute any normally computable fibonnaci number (unless the result becomes to large) in a constant time using Binet's formula ie closed solution formula to compute fibonnaci numbers. Here is my code: for the non-recursive implementation of fibonnaci: gr = (1 + 5**0.5) / 2
def gfib(n):
    return int(((gr**n - (1-gr)**n) / 5**0.5))
 I understand a^n indicates exponential run time complexity, however this is not the case when the code is run in python, as this computes the nth fibonnaci number instantly. I've done some research on how exponents are implemented in python (maybe exponentiation by squaring?) to give the constant time solution that I get, but haven't found a definitive answer. Any ideas?

@TITLE:How to efficiently select a random element from a std::set
@CONTENT:How can I efficiently select a random element from a std::set? A std::set::iterator is a bidirectional iterator. So I can't directly index a randomly chosen element like I could for a std::deque or std::vector I could take the iterator returned from std::set::begin() and increment it 0 to std::set::size()-1 times, but that seems to be doing a lot of unnecessary work. For an "index" close to the set's size, I would end up traversing the entire first half of the tree, even though it's already known the element won't be found there. Is there a better approach? In the name of efficiency, I am willing to define "random" as less random than whatever approach I might have used to choose a random index in a vector. Call it "reasonably random". Edit... Many insightful answers below. The short version is that even though you can find a specific element in log(n) time, you can't find an arbitrary element in that time through the std::set interface.

@LINK:/questions/12123511/using-ancestors-or-reference-properties-in-google-app-engine
@TITLE:Using ancestors or reference properties in Google App Engine?
@CONTENT:Currently, a lot of my code makes extensive use of ancestors to put and fetch objects. However, I'm looking to change some stuff around. I initially thought that ancestors helped make querying faster if you knew who the ancestor of the entity you're looking for was. But I think it turns out that ancestors are mostly useful for transaction support. I don't make use of transactions, so I'm wondering if ancestors are more of a burden on the system here than a help. What I have is a User entity, and a lot of other entities such as say Comments, Tags, Friends. A User can create many Comments, Tags, and Friends, and so whenever a user does so, I set the ancestor for all these newly created objects as the User. So when I create a Comment, I set the ancestor as the user: comment = Comment(aUser, key_name = commentId)
 Now the only reason I'm doing this is strictly for querying purposes. I thought it would be faster when I wanted to get all comments by a certain user to just get all comments with a common ancestor rather than querying for all comments where authorEmail = userEmail. So when I want to get all comments by a certain user, I do: commentQuery = db.GqlQuery('SELECT * FROM Comment WHERE ANCESTOR IS :1', userKey)
 So my question is, is this a good use of ancestors? Should each Comment instead have a ReferenceProperty that references the User object that created the comment, and filter by that? (Also, my thinking was that using ancestors instead of an indexed ReferenceProperty would save on write costs. Am I mistaken here?)
@CODE:comment = Comment(aUser, key_name = commentId) commentQuery = db.GqlQuery('SELECT * FROM Comment WHERE ANCESTOR IS :1', userKey)

@TITLE:OpenMP and C parallel for loop: why does my code slow down when using OpenMP?
@CONTENT:I'm new here and a beginner level programmer in C. I'm having some problem with using openmp to speedup the for-loop. Below is simple example: #include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <gsl/gsl_rng.h>
#include <omp.h>

gsl_rng *rng;

main()
{
int i, M=100000000;
double tmp;

/* initialize RNG */
gsl_rng_env_setup();
rng = gsl_rng_alloc (gsl_rng_taus);
gsl_rng_set (rng,(unsigned long int)791526599);

// option 1: parallel        
  #pragma omp parallel for default(shared) private( i, tmp ) schedule(dynamic)
  for(i=0;i<=M-1;i++){
     tmp=gsl_ran_gamma_mt(rng, 4, 1./3 );
  }


// option 2: sequential       
  for(i=0;i<=M-1;i++){
     tmp=gsl_ran_gamma_mt(rng, 4, 1./3 );
  }
}
 The code draws from a gamma random distribution for M iterations. It turns out the parallel approach with openmp (option 1) takes about 1 minute while the sequential approach (option 2) takes only 20 seconds. While running with openmp, I can see the cpu usage is 800% ( the server I'm using has 8 CPUs ). And the system is linux with GCC 4.1.3. The compile command I'm using is gcc -fopenmp -lgsl -lgslcblas -lm (I'm using GSL ) Am I doing something wrong? Please help me! Thanks! P.S. As pointed out by some users, it might be caused by rng. But even if I replace tmp=gsl_ran_gamma_mt(rng, 4, 1./3 );
 by say tmp=1000*10000;
 the problem still there...

@CONTENT:I have both Word 2007 and 2010 installed. I need to open Word from within Excel but I need to specify which version I need to open within VBA. I've tried late binding Dim wordApp2007 As Object
Dim wordApp2010 As Object

Set wordApp2007 = CreateObject("Word.Application.12")
wordApp2007.Visible = True
Set wordApp2010 = CreateObject("Word.Application.14")
wordApp2010.Visible = True
 but both open Word 2010 I've also tried early binding by using Dim wordApp As Word.Application
Set wordApp2007 = New Word.Application
wordApp2007.Visible = True
 and setting references to the Word 12.0 object model but this still opens Word 2010 If I register each version of Word using "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office12\WINWORD.EXE" /regserver "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office14\WINWORD.EXE" /regserver then the version registered opens but then I can't open open the non-registered. Can anyone help and show me how to open a specific version of Word within Excel using VBA? Thank you Edit: Example code.... Option Explicit

@CONTENT:I am not able to understand the output of the following program. public class Confusing {

    private Confusing(double[] dArray) {

 The correct output is "double array". WHy was this constructor chosen as more specific than the other when both can accept null?

@TITLE:How can I access Chrome's spell-check dictionary?
@CONTENT:Clearly Chrome has a built-in dictionary that it uses for spell-checking. Is there an API or some way to access this dictionary? I am interested not in checking spelling, but actually accessing the dictionary. E.g. I would like to write Dictionary autocomplete extension for chrome? a dictionary autocomplete extension that uses Chrome's dictionary instead of maintaining my own. Of particular interest to me would be a funciton like getWordsThatStartWith(text).

@TITLE:OpenGL ES 2.0 screen flickering
@CONTENT:I'm facing a big problem. I'm using a Transformer tf101 tab with Android 4.0.3 on it. My app is using a custom OpenGL ES 2.0 surface. I'm rendering multiple planes with textures. this textures are changing approx. 20 times per second and are updated by passing byte arrays. However, in certain cases, the screen begins flickering and does not render the new textures. Additional UI Elements are still responsive and do their work as intended. It seems the OpenGL context ignores all commands and is unresponsive. When this happens, a few lines show up in my logCat: 08-20 10:31:15.390: D/NvOsDebugPrintf(2898): NvRmChannelSubmit: NvError_IoctlFailed with error code 1
 followed by 08-20 10:31:15.390: D/NvOsDebugPrintf(2898): NvRmChannelSubmit failed (err = 13, SyncPointValue = 879005, returning = 0)
 and a few of them: 08-20 10:31:15.390: D/NvOsDebugPrintf(2898): NvRmChannelSubmit failed (err = 196623, SyncPointValue = 0)
 Here is how i create my Textured Plane:     m_nTextureStorage[0] = 0;

    GLES20.glGenTextures( 1, m_nTextureStorage, 0);
    GLES20.glActiveTexture( GLES20.GL_TEXTURE0 );
    GLES20.glBindTexture( GLES20.GL_TEXTURE_2D, m_nTextureStorage[ 0 ] );

    // Set filtering
    GLES20.glTexParameterf( GLES20.GL_TEXTURE_2D, GLES20.GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER, GLES20.GL_NEAREST );
    GLES20.glTexParameterf( GLES20.GL_TEXTURE_2D, GLES20.GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER, GLES20.GL_NEAREST );
    GLES20.glTexParameteri( GLES20.GL_TEXTURE_2D, GLES20.GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S, GLES20.GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE );
    GLES20.glTexParameteri( GLES20.GL_TEXTURE_2D, GLES20.GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T, GLES20.GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE );
 and here is how i draw it: GLES20.glEnable(GLES20.GL_TEXTURE_2D);
        GLES20.glEnable(GLES20.GL_DEPTH_TEST);
        GLES20.glActiveTexture( GLES20.GL_TEXTURE0 );

        //GLES20.glUniformMatrix4fv(m_HMVPMatrixUniform, 1, false, mvpMatrix, 0); 
        GLES20.glUseProgram( m_nProgramHandle );
        ByteBuffer oDataBuf = ByteBuffer.wrap( m_sTexture );

        m_HTextureUniform = GLES20.glGetUniformLocation( m_nProgramHandle, "uTexture" );
        m_HTextureCoordinate = GLES20.glGetAttribLocation( m_nProgramHandle, "TexCoordinate" );
        GLES20.glUniform1iv( m_HTextureUniform, 2, m_nTextureStorage, 0 );

        // get handle to the vertex shader's vPosition member
        m_nPositionHandle = GLES20.glGetAttribLocation( m_nProgramHandle, "vPosition" );


        // Prepare the triangle data
        GLES20.glTexImage2D( GLES20.GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, GLES20.GL_LUMINANCE, 640, 480,
                             0, GLES20.GL_LUMINANCE, GLES20.GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, oDataBuf );

        // Prepare the triangle data
        GLES20.glVertexAttribPointer( m_nPositionHandle, 3, GLES20.GL_FLOAT, false, 12, m_oVertexBuffer );
        GLES20.glEnableVertexAttribArray( m_nPositionHandle );

        GLES20.glVertexAttribPointer( m_HTextureCoordinate, 2, GLES20.GL_FLOAT, false, 12, m_oTextureBuffer); 
        GLES20.glEnableVertexAttribArray( m_HTextureCoordinate );

        m_nMVPMatrixHandle = GLES20.glGetUniformLocation( m_nProgramHandle, "uMVPMatrix");

        // Apply the projection and view transformation
        GLES20.glUniformMatrix4fv( m_nMVPMatrixHandle, 1, false, mvpMatrix, 0);

        GLES20.glDrawArrays(GLES20.GL_TRIANGLES, 0, 6);
 The OpenGL Renderer simply calls the draw function of my TexturedPlane by passing the mvpMatrix. Im not deleting any textures since i've read that the android system will take care of that automatically. I think it has something todo with the GPU going OOM, but im not sure since i haven't found anything related to the posted error messages. Thanks it advance! UPDATE: The Rendermode was set to RENDER_WHEN_DIRTY . After Changing it to RENDERMODE_CONTINOUSLY the problem disappears.. Weird. Since this is just a workaround and no solution, I'm still asking for help ;) Leaving the Rendermode at continuously is no option, since this consumes to much processor time and makes no sense, since rendering is only necessary when new textures a generated.

@TITLE:Cross compile PHP with UCLIBC
@CONTENT:THIS IS A REPOST, PREVIOUS POST GOT CLOSED, MOVED TO SERVERFAULT AND CLOSED AGAIN. I think this post is a valid stackoverflow problem because i think its caused by some automake/compile/linking error. This is a programming problem not a server admin problem. Cross compile PHP http://serverfault.com/questions/418521/cross-compile-php Start of post I have downloaded the PHP 5.4.0 source, extracted it and moved into the source folder. I do a configure with: ./configure --build=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu --host=arm-linux-uclibcgnueabi --prefix=/usr/arm/www CC="arm-linux-uclibcgnueabi-gcc --sysroot=/toolchains/gnu_cortex-a9_tools/"  --disable-libxml --disable-dom  --without-iconv --without-openssl --disable-simplexml --disable-xml --disable-xmlreader --disable-xmlwriter --without-pear --without-sqlite3 --disable-pdo --without-pdo-sqlite --disable-phar  --with-config-file-path=/etc/
 Followed by make
 no errors, everything runs fine. Next i do a make install. make install
 Again everything runs fine. i move it to the target platform and run /usr/arm/www/bin/php -v

 this is very similar to what sixeightzero wrote in the comments yesterday. I have now tried PHP version 5.3.5, 5.4.0, 5.4.5 same error on all. Update4 I downloaded a new toolchain for glibc, cross compiled a new busybox with glibc, created a chroot jail, cross compiled php with glibc instead of uclibc and tested it inside my chroot jail on my uclibc box, and it works! But i still need to get php to work in my uclibc environment....

@TITLE:Color-coding 95% confidence ellipses for centroids
@CONTENT:I've plotted centroids for a Gower similarity index using the vegan{} package in R and would like to color code the ellipse fills based on factors in my original dataset. The centroids are for Month-Site combinations (and these are the only centroids I want to plot; see data sample below), but I want to color code the ellipses by Month and then, in a second plot, by site, to show differences between factors. At the moment the code looks like this: dat.fac<-dat[,1:7]  ##factors

dat.mgower <- vegdist(decostand(dat[,8:34], "log"), "altGower")
ord<-capscale(dat.mgower~1)     #Does the PCO

plot(ord, display = "sites", type = "n")

#for i in 
stats<-with(dat.fac,
    ordiellipse(ord, Site_TP, kind="se", conf=0.95,
    lwd=2, draw = "polygon",col="#0000ff22",border = "blue"))
 The MDS plot with the centroids looks like this: I would like to be able to color code the fills of the centroids based on a) Site and b) season (May vs. September). I have tried using col=c("#0000ff22","#CAFF7022",...) but this doesn't work because the coordinates for the ellipses are in ord. I've also tried with(dat.fac,ordiellipse(ord, Site_TP[1:54], kind="se", conf=0.95,
    lwd=2, draw = "polygon",col="#0000ff22",border = "blue"))
 to get the first half of the ceentroids to be one color (the first half are all from the same month), but this results in the error "Error in cov.wt(X, W) : 'x' must contain finite values only." Help! Thanks. The data looks like this: structure(list(Core_num = structure(c(39L, 50L, 61L, 70L, 71L,

@TITLE:Get base product image in Magento
@CONTENT:I want to get base product image in Magento to resize it and display in cart sidebar. Unfortunatelly this: echo $this->helper('catalog/image')->init($_product, 'image')->resize(38, 38);
 prints Magento placeholder image. Base image is set for this product properly. Small image and thumbnail works great. No idea what's going on. EDIT: Solution: Get full product data this way: $_product = Mage::getModel('catalog/product')->load($_item->getProduct()->getId());
 and then use it as you wish: echo $this->helper('catalog/image')->init($_product, 'image')->resize(38, 38);
@CODE:echo $this->helper('catalog/image')->init($_product, 'image')->resize(38, 38); $_product = Mage::getModel('catalog/product')->load($_item->getProduct()->getId()); echo $this->helper('catalog/image')->init($_product, 'image')->resize(38, 38);

@TITLE:What's with the 'in' keyword?
@CONTENT:In Haskell, why do you not use 'in' with 'let' inside of a do-block, but you must otherwise? For example, in the somewhat contrived examples below: afunc :: Int -> Int
afunc a = 
       let x = 9 in
       a * x

amfunc :: IO Int -> IO Int
amfunc a = do
       let x = 9
       a' <- a
       return (a' * x)
 It's an easy enough rule to remember, but I just don't understand the reason for it.
@CODE:afunc :: Int -> Int
afunc a = 
       let x = 9 in

@CONTENT:Fist i am confused should i set libraries under Linker/Libraries or to set them under "path and symbol". i think that they are the same. am i correct? any way for my question - i need to link static library , so i tried few things: First try I try to add gtest (this is the library) and gtest path in the link library. in this way its compiled and linked correct , but failed in runtime , because when it tried to load shared library (i want static library !) error is error while loading shared libraries: libgtest.so.0 Second try - I try do define it in path and symbol add to libraries the complete path '/root/workspace/gmock/gtest/lib/.lib/libgtest.a' . in this case i got error in the linkage : g++ -L/root/workspace/gmock/lib/.libs -L/root/workspace/gmock/gtest/lib/.libs -o "playground"  ./src/p.o ./src/playground.o   -lpthread -l/root/workspace/gmock/gtest/lib/.lib/libgtest.a -l/root/workspace/gmock/lib/.lib/libgmock.a
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -l/root/workspace/gmock/gtest/lib/.lib/libgtest.a
 This post dosnt give an answer and not explain how you define differently linked against static vs shared. Thank you

@TITLE:Is it possible to host a Microsoft Access form inside a .Net Windows form?
@CONTENT:I am asking if it is possible to host a Microsoft Access form inside a .Net form. No I haven't gone mad, we are maintaining a massive system written entirely in VBA by somebody who didn't know a lot of VBA attempting to use Microsoft Access as an IDE. It's basically thousands of lines of spaghetti code and while we would love to scrap it and start from scratch, this is not an option. We are therefore trying to improve what is there, and in this particular scenario it would be really helpful if we could somehow host the Microsoft Access forms inside a .Net Windows Form as we can interact with the proprietary hardware from .Net much more effectively than we can from VB6. We currently have a .Net application that runs on the computer alongside the many MS-Access databases that the users have open at any one time, and the .Net application interacts with these using MS Access Interop with varying degrees of success. This is because it uses form titles and filenames/locations to get a handle on the database to do what it needs to do, and also relies on the user not interfering/switching off the application/moving the databases to their desktops etc. It's a bit of a mess. Therefore, I am asking if it is possible to somehow host a Microsoft Access form inside a .Net Windows form, by maybe adding the form itself as a control or a subform, in a way that would give me direct access to all of the controls on the form from .Net?

 It can also be in English or in Russian and displayed correctly. If the username changes it's updated in database. Even if I change the value in the db it wont solve the problem. I can fix it before saving by doing this new String(incorrect.getBytes("ISO-8859-1"), "UTF-8");

@TITLE:Javascript Template Engines that work with Chrome's Content Security Policy
@CONTENT:The Chrome API's Manifest version 2 has removed the ability to do unsafe-eval. This means using the eval function or in general dynamically creating a function from text. It seems like most if not all Javascript Templating Engines do this. I was using Jaml, but I tried several others like backbone.js (which really uses underscore.js's templating engine) with no luck. This comment on the Chromium project seems to indicate that there are a great many libraries that suffer from this. I think Angular.js has a CSP-safe mode, but Angular.js is really too big for what we need. We just need a fairly basic templating engine and don't need models or controllers and such. Does anyone know about any CSP-compatbility templating engines out there?

@TITLE:How to disable a particular compiler warning for a particular file
@CONTENT:Background I'm working on a small coding project that is going to be sold to other companies. I needed to create some documentation for it, so I decided to use Sandcastle. After taking far to long to download and install, I finally got it working, and noticed any public method or class that didn't have a comment had red text stating that the comment was missing. I then installed Ghostdoc to help speed up my commenting. This turned on the compiler warnings for missing xml comments, which was great because I now had a list of everything I needed to comment. The Problem One of my code files is an auto-generated file, which contains around 3000 compiler warnings. I need to be able to skip that file from creating any "Missing Xml Comment" compiler warnings. I know these things from this post: I know I can turn off the compiler warning for the project, but there are other files in the project that should have the compiler warning. I know I can use #pragma warning disable 1591 to remove the compiler warning, but the file is autogenerated, and I really don't want to have to re-add it manually every time. I know I can add an empty comment, but once again, I really don't want to have to re-add it every time the file gets regenerated. I could pull the file out into it's own project since it is the only class in it's namespace, then remove the XML comment requirement, but I don't want the customer to have to deal with another dll. The classes are partial classes so I was thinking about trying to find a way to add the #pragma warning disable in a partial class but even if that was possible, there are still enums that would throw warnings. How can I tell VS to ignore a single file for a particular type of warning?

@TITLE:Using java generics to ensure that argument received is same as class or subtype thereof
@CONTENT:I have a newbie question. interface Animal {
    void partner(Animal other);
}

class Lion implements Animal {
    int areaUnderControl;

    public void partner(Animal other) {
        Lion lion = (Lion) other;

    public void partner(Animal other) {
        Human human = (Human) other;
        this.money += human.money;
    }
}
 I want that the partner method in the concrete implementations only receive parameters of its type or its subtype. One solution is to use generics to define Animal as: interface Animal<T extends Animal<T>> {
    void partner(T other);
}

class Lion implements Animal<Lion> {
    int areaUnderControl;
    @Override
    public void partner(Lion other) {
        this.areaUnderControl += other.areaUnderControl; 
    }

class Human implements Animal<Human> {
    int money;
    @Override
    public void partner(Human other) {
        this.money += other.money;
    }
}
 However someone can still abuse this as class Bear implements Animal<Lion> {
    int honey;
    @Override
    public void partner(Lion other) {
        this.honey += other.areaUnderControl; //Problem
    }
}
 where a Bear is aspiring to partner with Lion. Is there someway that I can tie it to the type and subtypes of this I tried searching through the existing questions and somehow I feel the design of the interface itself may be flawed. If someone can point out why this is wrong or the right way to achieve this, it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

 I'm using this code to randomly set several related parameters within a function, but even though Python supports it, I'm wary of mixing types like this in a list. Since the list of mixed data types won't be used for any processing besides variable assignment in and of itself (the variables it assigns to will, but not the list itself), I presume this is fine, but I want to make sure this isn't secretly problematic code.
@CODE:import random
data = [["name1", "long name1", 1, 2, 3],
        ["name2", "long name2", 5, 6, 7]]

@LINK:/questions/11243227/binding-name-in-type-signature-using-datakind
@TITLE:Binding name in type signature using DataKind
@CONTENT:So, I finally found a task where I could make use of the new DataKinds extension (using ghc 7.4.1). Here's the Vec I'm using: data Nat = Z | S Nat deriving (Eq, Show)

data Vec :: Nat -> * -> * where
    Nil :: Vec Z a
    Cons :: a -> Vec n a -> Vec (S n) a
 Now, for convenience I wanted to implement fromList. Basically no problem with simple recursion/fold -- but I can't figure out how to give it the correct type. For reference, this is the Agda version: fromList : ? {a} {A : Set a}  (xs : List A)  Vec A (List.length xs)
 My Haskell approach, using the syntax I saw here: fromList :: (ls :: [a]) -> Vec (length ls) a
fromList [] = Nil 
fromList (x:xs) = Cons x (fromList xs)
 This gives me a parse error on input 'a'. Is the syntax I found even correct, or have they changed it? I also added some more extensions which are in the code in the link, which didn't help either (currently I have GADTs, DataKinds, KindSignatures, TypeOperators, TypeFamilies, UndecidableInstances). My other suspicion was that I just can't bind polymorphic types, but my test for this: bla :: (n :: Nat) -> a -> Vec (S n) a
bla = undefined
 failed, too, with Kind mis-match Expected kind 'ArgKind', but 'n' has kind 'Nat' (don't really know what that means). Could anyone help me with a working version of fromList and also clarify the other issues? Unfortunately, DataKinds isn't documented very well yet and seems to assume that everybody using it has profound type theory knowledge.
@CODE:DataKinds Vec data Nat = Z | S Nat deriving (Eq, Show)

data Vec :: Nat -> * -> * where
    Nil :: Vec Z a
    Cons :: a -> Vec n a -> Vec (S n) a fromList fromList : ? {a} {A : Set a}  (xs : List A)  Vec A (List.length xs) fromList :: (ls :: [a]) -> Vec (length ls) a
fromList [] = Nil 
fromList (x:xs) = Cons x (fromList xs) parse error on input 'a' GADTs, DataKinds, KindSignatures, TypeOperators, TypeFamilies, UndecidableInstances bla :: (n :: Nat) -> a -> Vec (S n) a
bla = undefined Kind mis-match Expected kind 'ArgKind', but 'n' has kind 'Nat' fromList DataKinds

@LINK:/questions/11106224/how-to-cast-blocks-to-and-from-void
@TITLE:How to cast blocks to and from void *
@CONTENT:So, I'm trying to pass a block as an NSAlert contextInfo parameter. [myAlert beginSheetModalForWindow: theWindow
                    modalDelegate: myAlert
                   didEndSelector: @selector(alertDidEnd:returnCode:contextInfo:)
                      contextInfo: (void *) aBlock];
 and get it back on the other end: void (^responseBlock)() = (__bridge_transfer void (^)()) contextInfo;
 Which works, to an extent. Before my call to beginSheetModalForWindow:... aBlock is at 0x00007fff610e1ec0, and in the response (alertDidEnd:...), contextInfo is at 0x00007fff610e1ec0. However, when I try to call the block: responseBlock();
 I get the following error error: called object type '__block_literal_generic *' is not a function or function pointer error: 1 errors parsing expression How does one properly cast blocks to an from void *s for the sake of simple transference? Edit: Full attempted code, using the cast methods suggested in the answers. I now receive an EXC_BAD_ACCESS error on the responseBlock(); call. - (void)alertDidEnd:(NSAlert *)alert returnCode:(NSInteger)returnCode contextInfo:(void *)contextInfo
{
    void (^responseBlock)() = (__bridge typeof(responseBlock)) contextInfo;

    switch (returnCode)
    {
        case NSCancelButton:
        {
            break;
        }

        case NSOKButton:
        {
            responseBlock();
            break;
        }
    }
}
 Other Notes: When using __bridge, the memory address of responseBlock and contextInfo are different, whereas with __bridge_transfer, they are the same. Neither alleviates the EXC_BAD_ACCESS issue. WORKING: [myAlert beginSheetModalForWindow: theWindow
                    modalDelegate: myAlert
                   didEndSelector: @selector(alertDidEnd:returnCode:contextInfo:)
                      contextInfo: (__bridge_retained void *) [aBlock copy]];
 and later... void (^responseBlock)() = (__bridge_transfer typeof(responseBlock)) contextInfo;
@CODE:NSAlert contextInfo [myAlert beginSheetModalForWindow: theWindow

        {
            responseBlock();

@CONTENT:Let's say I have a function: def foo(a = None, b=None, c=None):
  return "a:%s, b:%s, c:%s" % (a,b,c)
 I have a dictionary with some (or none) of the arguments above, but also with keys that are not named arguments in the function, e.g.: d = {'a':1, 'x':4, 'b':2, 'y':5}
 If I call the following I will get an error, because 'x' and 'y' are not keyword arguments in the foo function. foo(**d) # error
 Is there an elegant way of passing the arguments from a dictionary to a function, but only those values with keys that match the function arguments. Please correct me if my argument/parameter terminology is off.
@CODE:def foo(a = None, b=None, c=None):

@CONTENT:The video player actually loads fine. My actual problem is when I refresh some parts of my page with AJAX and those parts contains a video player, the HTML5 player loads fine, but not the Video.js part that customizes it. The video.js file is loaded in the header of the page. I have read the doc and can't find how to initialize a video player on a page that has already been loaded. Isn't there a myPlayer.initialize() kind of function I can call when my part of page containing the video is loaded to make the video player load correctly with Video.js? I think the video.js file does it automatically only on page load. Thanks for your precious help!

Unlike C function pointers, delegates are object-oriented, type safe, and secure. I know what it is and how to use it.

@TITLE:In node.js, how to declare a shared variable that can be initialized by master process and accessed by worker processes?
@CONTENT:I want the following During startup, the master process loads a large table from file and saves it into a shared variable. The table has 9 columns and 12 million rows, 432MB in size. The worker processes run HTTP server, accepting real-time queries against the large table. Here is my code, which obviously does not achieve my goal. var my_shared_var;
var cluster = require('cluster');
var numCPUs = require('os').cpus().length;

if (cluster.isMaster) {
  // Load a large table from file and save it into my_shared_var,
  // hoping the worker processes can access to this shared variable,
  // so that the worker processes do not need to reload the table from file.
  // The loading typically takes 15 seconds.
  my_shared_var = load('path_to_my_large_table');

  // Fork worker processes
  for (var i = 0; i < numCPUs; i++) {
    cluster.fork();
  }
} else {
  // The following line of code actually outputs "undefined".
  // It seems each process has its own copy of my_shared_var.
  console.log(my_shared_var);

  // Then perform query against my_shared_var.
  // The query should be performed by worker processes,
  // otherwise the master process will become bottleneck
  var result = query(my_shared_var);
}
 I have tried saving the large table into MongoDB so that each process can easily access to the data. But the table size is so huge that it takes MongoDB about 10 seconds to complete my query even with an index. This is too slow and not acceptable for my real-time application. I have also tried Redis, which holds data in memory. But Redis is a key-value store and my data is a table. I also wrote a C++ program to load the data into memory, and the query took less than 1 second, so I want to emulate this in node.js.
@CODE:var my_shared_var;
var cluster = require('cluster');
var numCPUs = require('os').cpus().length;

if (cluster.isMaster) {
  // Load a large table from file and save it into my_shared_var,
  // hoping the worker processes can access to this shared variable,
  // so that the worker processes do not need to reload the table from file.
  // The loading typically takes 15 seconds.
  my_shared_var = load('path_to_my_large_table');

  // Fork worker processes
  for (var i = 0; i < numCPUs; i++) {
    cluster.fork();
  }
} else {
  // The following line of code actually outputs "undefined".
  // It seems each process has its own copy of my_shared_var.
  console.log(my_shared_var);

  // Then perform query against my_shared_var.
  // The query should be performed by worker processes,

  var result = query(my_shared_var);

@LINK:/questions/10937763/unit-under-test-impl-or-interface
@TITLE:Unit under test: Impl or Interface?
@CONTENT:Suppose I have interface and implementation class that implements it and I want to write unit-test for this. What should I test interface or Impl? Here is an example: public interface HelloInterface {
    public void sayHello();
}


public class HelloInterfaceImpl implements HelloInterface {
    private PrintStream target = System.out;


    @Override
    public void sayHello() {
        target.print("Hello World");

    }

    public void setTarget(PrintStream target){
        this.target = target;
    }
}
 So, I have HelloInterface and HelloInterfaceImpl that implements it. What is unit-under-test interface or Impl? I think it should be HelloInterface. Consider following sketch of JUnit test: public class HelloInterfaceTest {
    private HelloInterface hi;

    @Before
    public void setUp() {
        hi = new HelloInterfaceImpl();
    }

    @Test
    public void testDefaultBehaviourEndsNormally() {
        hi.sayHello();
        // no NullPointerException here
    }

    @Test
    public void testCheckHelloWorld() throws Exception {
        ByteArrayOutputStream out = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
        PrintStream target = new PrintStream(out);
        PrivilegedAccessor.setValue(hi, "target", target);
        //You can use ReflectionTestUtils in place of PrivilegedAccessor
        //really it is DI 
        //((HelloInterfaceImpl)hi).setTarget(target);
        hi.sayHello();
        String result = out.toString();
        assertEquals("Hello World", result);

    }
 }
 The main line is actually one that I commented out. ((HelloInterfaceImpl)hi).setTarget(target); Method setTarget() is not part of my public interface, so I don't want to accidentally call it. If I really want to call it, I should take a moment and think about it. It helps me, for example, to discover that what I'm really trying to do is dependency injection. It opens for me the whole world of new opportunities. I can use some existing dependency injection mechanism (Spring's, for example), I can simulate it myself as I actually did in my code or to take totally different approach. Take a closer look, preparation of PrintSream wasn't that easy, maybe I should use mock object instead? EDIT: I think I should always focus on the interface. From my point of view setTarget() is not part of the "contract" of the impl class neither, it serves sally for dependency injection. I think any public method of Impl class should be considered as private from the testing perspective. It doesn't mean that I ignore the implementation details, though. See also Should Private/Protected methods be under unit test? EDIT-2 In the case of multiple implementations\multiple interfaces, I would test all of the implementations, but when I declare a variable in my setUp() method I would definitely use interface.
@CODE:public interface HelloInterface {
    public void sayHello();
}


public class HelloInterfaceImpl implements HelloInterface {
    private PrintStream target = System.out;


    @Override
    public void sayHello() {
        target.print("Hello World");

    }

    public void setTarget(PrintStream target){
        this.target = target;
    }
} public class HelloInterfaceTest {
    private HelloInterface hi;

    @Before
    public void setUp() {
        hi = new HelloInterfaceImpl();
    }

    @Test
    public void testDefaultBehaviourEndsNormally() {
        hi.sayHello();
        // no NullPointerException here
    }

    @Test
    public void testCheckHelloWorld() throws Exception {
        ByteArrayOutputStream out = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
        PrintStream target = new PrintStream(out);
        PrivilegedAccessor.setValue(hi, "target", target);
        //You can use ReflectionTestUtils in place of PrivilegedAccessor
        //really it is DI 
        //((HelloInterfaceImpl)hi).setTarget(target);
        hi.sayHello();

@LINK:/questions/11243227/binding-name-in-type-signature-using-datakind
@TITLE:Binding name in type signature using DataKind
@CONTENT:So, I finally found a task where I could make use of the new DataKinds extension (using ghc 7.4.1). Here's the Vec I'm using: data Nat = Z | S Nat deriving (Eq, Show)

data Vec :: Nat -> * -> * where
    Nil :: Vec Z a
    Cons :: a -> Vec n a -> Vec (S n) a
 Now, for convenience I wanted to implement fromList. Basically no problem with simple recursion/fold -- but I can't figure out how to give it the correct type. For reference, this is the Agda version: fromList : ? {a} {A : Set a}  (xs : List A)  Vec A (List.length xs)
 My Haskell approach, using the syntax I saw here: fromList :: (ls :: [a]) -> Vec (length ls) a
fromList [] = Nil 
fromList (x:xs) = Cons x (fromList xs)
 This gives me a parse error on input 'a'. Is the syntax I found even correct, or have they changed it? I also added some more extensions which are in the code in the link, which didn't help either (currently I have GADTs, DataKinds, KindSignatures, TypeOperators, TypeFamilies, UndecidableInstances). My other suspicion was that I just can't bind polymorphic types, but my test for this: bla :: (n :: Nat) -> a -> Vec (S n) a
bla = undefined
 failed, too, with Kind mis-match Expected kind 'ArgKind', but 'n' has kind 'Nat' (don't really know what that means). Could anyone help me with a working version of fromList and also clarify the other issues? Unfortunately, DataKinds isn't documented very well yet and seems to assume that everybody using it has profound type theory knowledge.
@CODE:DataKinds Vec data Nat = Z | S Nat deriving (Eq, Show)

data Vec :: Nat -> * -> * where
    Nil :: Vec Z a
    Cons :: a -> Vec n a -> Vec (S n) a fromList fromList : ? {a} {A : Set a}  (xs : List A)  Vec A (List.length xs) fromList :: (ls :: [a]) -> Vec (length ls) a
fromList [] = Nil 
fromList (x:xs) = Cons x (fromList xs) parse error on input 'a' GADTs, DataKinds, KindSignatures, TypeOperators, TypeFamilies, UndecidableInstances bla :: (n :: Nat) -> a -> Vec (S n) a
bla = undefined Kind mis-match Expected kind 'ArgKind', but 'n' has kind 'Nat' fromList DataKinds

@LINK:/questions/11106224/how-to-cast-blocks-to-and-from-void
@TITLE:How to cast blocks to and from void *
@CONTENT:So, I'm trying to pass a block as an NSAlert contextInfo parameter. [myAlert beginSheetModalForWindow: theWindow
                    modalDelegate: myAlert
                   didEndSelector: @selector(alertDidEnd:returnCode:contextInfo:)
                      contextInfo: (void *) aBlock];
 and get it back on the other end: void (^responseBlock)() = (__bridge_transfer void (^)()) contextInfo;
 Which works, to an extent. Before my call to beginSheetModalForWindow:... aBlock is at 0x00007fff610e1ec0, and in the response (alertDidEnd:...), contextInfo is at 0x00007fff610e1ec0. However, when I try to call the block: responseBlock();
 I get the following error error: called object type '__block_literal_generic *' is not a function or function pointer error: 1 errors parsing expression How does one properly cast blocks to an from void *s for the sake of simple transference? Edit: Full attempted code, using the cast methods suggested in the answers. I now receive an EXC_BAD_ACCESS error on the responseBlock(); call. - (void)alertDidEnd:(NSAlert *)alert returnCode:(NSInteger)returnCode contextInfo:(void *)contextInfo
{
    void (^responseBlock)() = (__bridge typeof(responseBlock)) contextInfo;

        {
            responseBlock();
            break;
        }
    }
}
 Other Notes: When using __bridge, the memory address of responseBlock and contextInfo are different, whereas with __bridge_transfer, they are the same. Neither alleviates the EXC_BAD_ACCESS issue. WORKING: [myAlert beginSheetModalForWindow: theWindow
                    modalDelegate: myAlert

@TITLE:In node.js, how to declare a shared variable that can be initialized by master process and accessed by worker processes?
@CONTENT:I want the following During startup, the master process loads a large table from file and saves it into a shared variable. The table has 9 columns and 12 million rows, 432MB in size. The worker processes run HTTP server, accepting real-time queries against the large table. Here is my code, which obviously does not achieve my goal. var my_shared_var;
var cluster = require('cluster');
var numCPUs = require('os').cpus().length;

if (cluster.isMaster) {
  // Load a large table from file and save it into my_shared_var,
  // hoping the worker processes can access to this shared variable,
  // so that the worker processes do not need to reload the table from file.
  // The loading typically takes 15 seconds.
  my_shared_var = load('path_to_my_large_table');

  // Fork worker processes
  for (var i = 0; i < numCPUs; i++) {
    cluster.fork();
  }
} else {
  // The following line of code actually outputs "undefined".
  // It seems each process has its own copy of my_shared_var.
  console.log(my_shared_var);

  // Then perform query against my_shared_var.
  // The query should be performed by worker processes,
  // otherwise the master process will become bottleneck
  var result = query(my_shared_var);
}
 I have tried saving the large table into MongoDB so that each process can easily access to the data. But the table size is so huge that it takes MongoDB about 10 seconds to complete my query even with an index. This is too slow and not acceptable for my real-time application. I have also tried Redis, which holds data in memory. But Redis is a key-value store and my data is a table. I also wrote a C++ program to load the data into memory, and the query took less than 1 second, so I want to emulate this in node.js.
@CODE:var my_shared_var;
var cluster = require('cluster');
var numCPUs = require('os').cpus().length;

if (cluster.isMaster) {
  // Load a large table from file and save it into my_shared_var,
  // hoping the worker processes can access to this shared variable,
  // so that the worker processes do not need to reload the table from file.
  // The loading typically takes 15 seconds.
  my_shared_var = load('path_to_my_large_table');

  // Fork worker processes
  for (var i = 0; i < numCPUs; i++) {
    cluster.fork();
  }
} else {
  // The following line of code actually outputs "undefined".
  // It seems each process has its own copy of my_shared_var.
  console.log(my_shared_var);

@TITLE:Unit under test: Impl or Interface?
@CONTENT:Suppose I have interface and implementation class that implements it and I want to write unit-test for this. What should I test interface or Impl? Here is an example: public interface HelloInterface {
    public void sayHello();
}


public class HelloInterfaceImpl implements HelloInterface {
    private PrintStream target = System.out;


    @Override
    public void sayHello() {
        target.print("Hello World");

    }

    public void setTarget(PrintStream target){
        this.target = target;
    }
}
 So, I have HelloInterface and HelloInterfaceImpl that implements it. What is unit-under-test interface or Impl? I think it should be HelloInterface. Consider following sketch of JUnit test: public class HelloInterfaceTest {
    private HelloInterface hi;

    @Before
    public void setUp() {
        hi = new HelloInterfaceImpl();
    }

    @Test
    public void testDefaultBehaviourEndsNormally() {
        hi.sayHello();
        // no NullPointerException here
    }

    @Test
    public void testCheckHelloWorld() throws Exception {
        ByteArrayOutputStream out = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
        PrintStream target = new PrintStream(out);
        PrivilegedAccessor.setValue(hi, "target", target);
        //You can use ReflectionTestUtils in place of PrivilegedAccessor
        //really it is DI 
        //((HelloInterfaceImpl)hi).setTarget(target);
        hi.sayHello();
        String result = out.toString();
        assertEquals("Hello World", result);

    }
 }
 The main line is actually one that I commented out. ((HelloInterfaceImpl)hi).setTarget(target); Method setTarget() is not part of my public interface, so I don't want to accidentally call it. If I really want to call it, I should take a moment and think about it. It helps me, for example, to discover that what I'm really trying to do is dependency injection. It opens for me the whole world of new opportunities. I can use some existing dependency injection mechanism (Spring's, for example), I can simulate it myself as I actually did in my code or to take totally different approach. Take a closer look, preparation of PrintSream wasn't that easy, maybe I should use mock object instead? EDIT: I think I should always focus on the interface. From my point of view setTarget() is not part of the "contract" of the impl class neither, it serves sally for dependency injection. I think any public method of Impl class should be considered as private from the testing perspective. It doesn't mean that I ignore the implementation details, though. See also Should Private/Protected methods be under unit test? EDIT-2 In the case of multiple implementations\multiple interfaces, I would test all of the implementations, but when I declare a variable in my setUp() method I would definitely use interface.
@CODE:public interface HelloInterface {
    public void sayHello();
}


public class HelloInterfaceImpl implements HelloInterface {
    private PrintStream target = System.out;


    @Override
    public void sayHello() {
        target.print("Hello World");

    }

    public void setTarget(PrintStream target){
        this.target = target;
    }
} public class HelloInterfaceTest {
    private HelloInterface hi;

    @Before
    public void setUp() {
        hi = new HelloInterfaceImpl();
    }

    @Test
    public void testDefaultBehaviourEndsNormally() {
        hi.sayHello();
        // no NullPointerException here
    }

    @Test
    public void testCheckHelloWorld() throws Exception {
        ByteArrayOutputStream out = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
        PrintStream target = new PrintStream(out);
        PrivilegedAccessor.setValue(hi, "target", target);
        //You can use ReflectionTestUtils in place of PrivilegedAccessor
        //really it is DI 
        //((HelloInterfaceImpl)hi).setTarget(target);
        hi.sayHello();
        String result = out.toString();
        assertEquals("Hello World", result);

    }
 } ((HelloInterfaceImpl)hi).setTarget(target); setTarget() setTarget() setUp()

@TITLE:How do I avoid using dynamic when mocking an Excel.worksheet?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to mock an Excel spreadsheet using NSubstitute or other mocking framework and MSTest (Visual Studio 2010). I'm not sure if there's a better way than this--and this doesn't quite work for testing: Here's an example (this is all prototype code right now, and not very clean): int[] lowerBounds = { 1, 1 };
int[] lengths = { 2, 2 };

//Initialize a 1-based array like Excel does:
object[,] values = (object[,])Array.CreateInstance(typeof(object), lengths, lowerBounds);
values[1,1] = "hello";
values[2,1] = "world";      

//Mock the UsedRange.Value2 property
sheet.UsedRange.Value2.Returns(values); 

//Test:   
GetSetting(sheet, "hello").Should().Be("world");  //FluentAssertions
 So far, so good: this passes if the GetSetting method is in the same project as my test. However when GetSetting is in my VSTO Excel-Addin project, it fails with the following error on the first line of the GetSetting function: System.MissingMethodException: Error: Missing method 'instance object [MyExcel.AddIn] Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Range::get_Value2()' from class 'Castle.Proxies.RangeProxy'.
 For reference, the GetSetting grabs a value from columnA in the sheet, and returns the value in columnB. public static string GetSetting(Excel.Worksheet sheet, string settingName) {
  object[,] value = sheet.UsedRange.Value2 as object[,];
  for (int row = 1; row <= value.GetLength(1); row++) {
    if (value[1, row].ToString() == settingName)
      return value[2, row].ToString();
  }
  return "";
}
 The final interesting piece is if I redefine the signature of my method as follows: public static string GetSetting(dynamic sheet, string settingName) it works in the VSTO project. So what is going on, and what's the best way to do something like this? Thanks!

    "Age": 27,

};
 which I would like to merge onto the following base object so that my user object will have all the required properties var base = { 
    "Name": null, 
    "Height": null,

        { "Name": "Football", "Location": null },
        { "Name": "Rugby", "Location": null }

 The easiest way to merge to the two objects would be to extend the base object with the user object as follows $.extend(true, base, user);
 which would modify the base object to be { 
    "Name": "Dan",

    "Age": 27, 
    "Hobbies": null

    "Name": "Dan", 
    "Height": null,

@TITLE:Does stdio always set errno?
@CONTENT:When a stdio stream encounters an error (but not EOF), the stream's error indicator will be set so that ferror() will return nonzero. I have always assumed that more information is available in errno. But how do I know this? Documentation for some functions [e.g. man fopen under Linux] says that errno will also be set. However man fgets doesn't mention errno at all. The glibc info pages are reassuring: In addition to setting the error indicator associated with the stream, the functions that operate on streams also set `errno' in the same way as the corresponding low-level functions that operate on file descriptors. But I have no idea how strong this guarantee is. Is it required by the C standard? What happens in Visual C/C++?

 Does anyone know how I might make this work? I'd also consider using the tomEE+ Jax-rs server, but it doesn't seem to recognize the Jackson annotations. EDIT: I think the issue is that the openEJB CDI is conflicting with the CDI that comes with Jersey. I have no idea how to fix this.

@TITLE:Always return a 404 when you decide to return a 403
@CONTENT:There are several questions already posted here about returning a 404 instead of a 403 in special cases (e.g., .ht* files or a certain directory), but I can't figure out how to simply replace all 403 responses ("Okay, it exists, but you still have to find a way in") with 404s ("Sorry, never heard of it"). I'm hoping that there is a simple solution that won't require updating regexes or other bits of the .htaccess to match site changes, just a simple directive: "whenever you decide to return a 403, return a 404 instead" that applies to the whole site, regardless of configuration changes. Then, if the top level .htaccess contains "Options -Indexes", and any given directory contains no index.html (or equiv), the bare directory URL will return 404, but if I ever add an index.html to that directory, the same bare directory URL will return the index.html, with no updates needed to any .htaccess file. I don't even care if, in the event I ever password a directory, a bad password returns a 404 (because of the 404 -> 403 mapping). In that case, I'm not hiding anything by returning a 404, but it causes no harm either. If there's a way to UNDO the general 403->404 mapping for special cases (rather than DO it for special cases), though, that could be even more useful. Of course, if I'm overlooking something, please set me straight. EDIT: Drat. I was trying to write a good quality question here, but my description of the behavior of "Options -Indexes" in the second paragraph turns out to be wrong. Without that line a bare directory URL shows "index.html" if exists in the directory; otherwise, it reveals the contents of the directory. (That forwarding of /dir to /dir/index.html if index.html exists is the default setup of the Web host, unless I'm mistaken.) Adding the "Options -Indexes" line stops it airing my laundry in public (returning a 403, not 404, but still better than exposing the dir contents), but now the bare directory URL returns a 403 even if index.html exists. I wish a bare dir URL "mysite.com/mydir" displayed /mydir/index.html if it existed and "404" if it didn't, but clearly there's more to it than just replacing the 403s with 404s.

@TITLE:Remove class attribute from HTML using Python and lxml
@CONTENT:Question How do I remove class attributes from html using python and lxml? Example I have: <p class="DumbClass">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit</p>
 I want: <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit</p>
 What I've tried so far I've checked out lxml.html.clean.Cleaner however, it does not have a method to strip out class attributes. You can set safe_attrs_only=True however, this does not remove the class attribute. Significant searching has turned up nothing workable. I think the fact that class is used in both html and python further muddies search results. Many of the results also seem to deal strictly with xml as well. I'm open to other python modules that offer humane interfaces as well. Thanks much. Solution Thanks to @Dan Roberts answer below, I came up with the following solution. Presented for folks arriving here in the future trying to solve the same problem. import lxml.html

# Our html string we want to remove the class attribute from
html_string = '<p class="DumbClass">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit</p>'

# Parse the html
html = lxml.html.fromstring(html_string)

# Print out our "Before"
print lxml.html.tostring(html)

# .xpath below gives us a list of all elements that have a class attribute
# xpath syntax explained:
# // = select all tags that match our expression regardless of location in doc
# * = match any tag
# [@class] = match all class attributes
for tag in html.xpath('//*[@class]'):
    # For each element with a class attribute, remove that class attribute
    tag.attrib.pop('class')

# Print out our "After"
print lxml.html.tostring(html)
@CODE:<p class="DumbClass">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit</p> <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit</p> safe_attrs_only=True class import lxml.html

# Our html string we want to remove the class attribute from
html_string = '<p class="DumbClass">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit</p>'

# Parse the html
html = lxml.html.fromstring(html_string)

# Print out our "Before"
print lxml.html.tostring(html)

# .xpath below gives us a list of all elements that have a class attribute
# xpath syntax explained:
# // = select all tags that match our expression regardless of location in doc
# * = match any tag
# [@class] = match all class attributes
for tag in html.xpath('//*[@class]'):
    # For each element with a class attribute, remove that class attribute
    tag.attrib.pop('class')

# Print out our "After"
print lxml.html.tostring(html)

@CONTENT:I previously had an rmagick gem installation that works with ImageMagick. ImageMagick was installed from source with OpenMP disabled. This installation works without a hitch.

@LINK:/questions/9917973/what-causes-ie8-to-block-some-file-downloads
@TITLE:What causes IE8 to block some file downloads?
@CONTENT:This is causing some grief among my IE8 users. On my site I have file downloads launched via php script (file_download.php?file=X123). In this page it records some data to a database, then uses headers to force the download. Everything on this page seems to works fine on all browsers. Its how I call this page that seems to be giving me the annoying little "To help protect your security - Internet Explorer has blocked site from downloading files to your computer". If I use a regular href tag <a href="/file_download.php?file=X123">download</a> it launches correctly (with no IE blocked download message). But when I launch using a jQuery script it gives me this warning. So I figured IE8 might be suspicious of javascript redirects, so I made a simple JS function on the local page, but it worked no problem. So it seems jQuery may be the culprit... is it because the window.location event is called from another page or script source? Does anyone know how this works? I will continue testing but for now, could anyone shine some light on this issue? Asking users to tweak their IE settings is not an option.

 ----update---- I have now educated myself enough to understand the cause of this problem - but no simple solution. The cause is IE7 & 8 automatically block downloads that are launched from non-user events. So an onclick event will launch a download, but not a jQuery script. Still searching for a workaround.
@CODE:<a href="/file_download.php?file=X123">download</a> jQuery("a").click(function(e){

            if(jQuery(this).attr("href") !== undefined){

                downloadLink = jQuery(this).attr("href");
                thingClicked = jQuery(this);

                dll_io = downloadLink.indexOf("/file_download.php?file_id=");
                dll_io2 = downloadLink.indexOf("/file_download_safe.php?file_id=");


                    if(dll_io == 0 || dll_io2 == 0){

                        e.preventDefault();

                        jQuery.getScript("/includes/get_login.php?file_id=" + downloadLink + "&dll_io=" + dll_io + "&dll_io2=" + dll_io2 + "&last_url=" + document.URL, function(rp){
                            //get_login.php sets 'requested_dl_id' cookie

@LINK:/questions/9907616/python-fcntl-does-not-lock-as-expected
@TITLE:Python fcntl does not lock as expected
@CONTENT:On a Debian-based OS (Ubuntu, Debian Squeeze), I'm using Python (2.7, 3.2) fcntl to lock a file. As I understand from what I read, fnctl.flock locks a file in a way, that an exception will be thrown if another client wants to lock the same file. I built a little example, which I would expect to throw an excepiton, since I first lock the file, and then, immediately after, I try to lock it again: #!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
import fcntl
fcntl.flock(open('/tmp/locktest', 'r'), fcntl.LOCK_EX)
try:
    fcntl.flock(open('/tmp/locktest', 'r'), fcntl.LOCK_EX | fcntl.LOCK_NB)
except IOError:
    print("can't immediately write-lock the file ($!), blocking ...")
else:
    print("No error")
 But the example just prints "No error". If I split this code up to two clients running at the same time (one locking and then waiting, the other trying to lock after the first lock is already active), I get the same behavior - no effect at all. Whats the explanation for this behavior? EDIT: Changes as requested by nightcracker, this version also prints "No error", although I would not expect that: #!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
import fcntl
import time
fcntl.flock(open('/tmp/locktest', 'w'), fcntl.LOCK_EX | fcntl.LOCK_NB)

@LINK:/questions/9824863/convention-based-dependency-injection-with-ninject-3-0-0
@TITLE:Convention Based Dependency Injection with Ninject 3.0.0
@CONTENT:I have two projects in my solution... a domain project and MVC3 web project (e.g. MyApp.Domain and MyApp.Web). Previously, when using Ninject.Extensions.Conventions ver. 2, I was able to use the following statement in the NinjectMVC3.cs file, and required dependencies throughout my solution (both web and domain) were injected properly (e.g. IFoo automatically bound to Foo). kernel.Scan(x =>
{
  x.FromAssembliesMatching("*");
  x.BindWith<DefaultBindingGenerator>();
});
 I have just upgraded to Ninject 3.0.0 (pre-release) and Ninject.Extensions.Conventions 3.0.0 (another pre-release) but the syntax for convention based binding has changed. I have figured out that I can use the following statement with the new version, but it only automatically binds the convention based interfaces in MyApp.Web and not in MyApp.Domain. The previous version bound interfaces throughout the application. kernel.Bind(x => x
    .FromThisAssembly()
    .SelectAllClasses()
    .BindToAllInterfaces());
 Any clue how I can configure convention based binding with the new Ninject version?

@TITLE:Using PATINDEX to find varying length patterns in T-SQL
@CONTENT:I'm looking to pull floats out of some varchars, using PATINDEX() to spot them. I know in each varchar string, I'm only interested in the first float that exists, but they might have different lengths. e.g. 'some text 456.09 other text'
'even more text 98273.453 la la la'
 I would normally match these with a regex   "[0-9]+[.][0-9]+"
 However, I can't find an equivalent for the + operator, which PATINDEX accepts. So they would need to be matched (respectively) with: '[0-9][0-9][0-9].[0-9][0-9]' and '[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9].[0-9][0-9][0-9]' 
 Is there any way to match both of these example varchars with one single valid PATINDEX pattern?
@CODE:'some text 456.09 other text'
'even more text 98273.453 la la la' "[0-9]+[.][0-9]+" '[0-9][0-9][0-9].[0-9][0-9]' and '[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9].[0-9][0-9][0-9]'

@CONTENT:With Xcode 4.3.1, Apple ships the new iOS 5.1 Simulator. Unfortunately, it looks like when you run iPad hardware, there's no longer the iPad frame around the sim window. Does anyone have any idea how to restore that frame? I often use the simulator to demo features to others via screen sharing, and it looks much better when it's in the iPad frame. Thanks in advance.

@TITLE:Is it possible to determine if an IEnumerable<T> has deffered execution pending?
@CONTENT:I have a function that accepts an Enumerable. I need to ensure that the enumerator is evaluated, but I'd rather not create a copy of it (e.g. via ToList() or ToArray()) if it is all ready in a List or some other "frozen" collection. By Frozen I mean collections where the set of items is already established e.g. List, Array, FsharpSet, Collection etc, as opposed to linq stuff like Select() and where(). Is it possible to create a function "ForceEvaluation" that can determine if the enumerable has deffered execution pending, and then evaluate the enumerable?  public void Process(IEnumerable<Foo> foos)
 {
      IEnumerable<Foo> evalutedFoos = ForceEvaluation(foos)
      EnterLockedMode(); // all the deferred processing needs to have been done before this line. 
      foreach (Foo foo in foos) 
      {
           Bar(foo);
      }  
}

 public IEnumerable ForceEvaluation(IEnumerable<Foo> foos)
 {
      if(??????)
      { return foos}
      else
      {return foos.ToList()}

 }
 } After some more research I've realized that this is pretty much impossible in any practical sense, and would require complex code inspection of each iterator. So I'm going to go with a variant of Mark's answer and create a white-list of known safe types and just call ToList() anything not on that is not on the white-list. Thank you all for your help. Edit* After even more reflection, I've realized that this is equivalent to the halting problem. So very impossible.
@CODE:public void Process(IEnumerable<Foo> foos)
 {
      IEnumerable<Foo> evalutedFoos = ForceEvaluation(foos)
      EnterLockedMode(); // all the deferred processing needs to have been done before this line. 
      foreach (Foo foo in foos)

}

@TITLE:Do any C++11 thread-safety guarantees apply to third-party thread libraries compiled/linked with C++11?
@CONTENT:C++11 offers features like thread-safe initialization of static variables, and citing that question we'll say for instance: Logger& g_logger() {
    static Logger lg;
    return lg;
}
 So ostensibly (?) this is true regardless of whether a module compiled with a C++11 compiler included the thread headers, or spawned any threads in its body. You're offered the guarantee even if it were linked against another module that used C++11 threads and called the function. But what if your "other module" that calls into this code wasn't using C++11 threads, but something like Qt's QThread. Is atomic initialization of statics then outside of the scope of C++11's ability to make such a guarantee? Or does the mere fact of a module having been compiled with C++11 and then linked against other C++11 code imply that you will get the guarantee regardless? Does anyone know a good reference where issues like this are covered?

@LINK:/questions/9459030/django-when-to-use-teardown-method
@TITLE:Django when to use teardown method
@CONTENT:According to the docs: A TestCase, on the other hand, does not truncate tables and reload initial data at the beginning of a test. Instead, it encloses the test code in a database transaction that is rolled back at the end of the test. It also prevents the code under test from issuing any commit or rollback operations on the database, to ensure that the rollback at the end of the test restores the database to its initial state. In order to guarantee that all TestCase code starts with a clean database, the Django test runner runs all TestCase tests first, before any other tests (e.g. doctests) that may alter the database without restoring it to its original state. So if I have a test that looks like this: class GeneralUserCreateTest(TestCase):

    def setUp(self):
        create_roletypes()
        create_permissiontypes()
        self.client = Client()
        self.event = create_event()

    def test_create(self):
        create_url = reverse('event_user_signup', args=[self.event.slug])

        post_data = {
            'signup-account-email': 'foo@bar.com',
            'signup-account-password': 'foobar',
            'signup-account-password2': 'foobar',
            'signup-account-first_name': 'Foo',
            'signup-account-last_name': 'Bar',
        }
        response = self.client.post(create_url, data=post_data)
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 302)

        # check creation of user object
        self.assertEqual(User.objects.filter(email=post_data['signup-account-email']).count(), 1)
        user = User.objects.get(username=post_data['signup-account-email'])

        # user and profile objects created
        self.assertEqual(User.objects.all().count(), 1)
        self.assertEqual(Profile.objects.all().count(), 1)

        # get the first user and profile object to test against submitted field
        user = User.objects.all()[0]
        profile = Profile.objects.all()[0]
        role = Role.objects.filter(event=self.event, profiles=profile)[0]
        self.assertEqual(role.roletype.name, 'General')

        self.assertEqual(profile.first_name, post_data['signup-account-first_name'])
        self.assertEqual(profile.last_name, post_data['signup-account-last_name'])
 Is it still necessary to run a teardown method or does the TestCase class take care of it? If so, when should one use the teardown method given the availability of the TestCase class?

@TITLE:Asp.Net MVC4 Web API - Return OData formatted Json from query without custom MediaTypeFormatter
@CONTENT:I am trying to use the new WebAPI beta to build a web service that I can query using the OData query string conventions and have it return OData formatted Json. I also want to use OData 2.0 (instead of 1.0). While it doesn't look like it has support for the $select option and headers seem to be able to override the $format option, returning an IQueryable generic seems to provide support for most other query options that I need. What I am really struggling with is how best to provide Json objects that meet the OData 2.0 specification. WebAPI just returns normal Json data when queried. For example, if I perform a GET request of something like this... http://localhost:XXXXX/vendor/?$filter=RONUMBER eq '2597385'&$select=VENDORID,VENDORNAME&$top=1&$format=Json
 ..to get the top hit matching the specified RONumber on my dev machine, I get a response containing the following Json... [{"MEPartNumber":"11-2222-3-4444","MFGPartNumber":"123456-123","MFGSerialNumber":"ABC123","RONumber":"987654321","VendorId":"1234567","VendorName":"ACME SERVICE CENTER"}]
 I need Json that meets the OData 2.0 spec. Something more like this.. OData V2: { 
  "d" : { 
    "results":  { 
        "__metadata": {
            "uri": "http://someserver/foo/vendor(1)",
            "type": "Vendor"
        },
        "MEPartNumber": "11-2222-3-4444",
        "MFGPartNumber": "123456-123",
        "MFGSerialNumber": "ABC123", 
        "RONumber":"987654321", 
        "VendorId":"1234567", 
        "VendorName": "ACME SERVICE CENTER"
    }
  }
}
 I suppose I could write a custom MediaTypeFormatter to get the structure that I want. I might also be able to modify my returned objects to mimic the structure of the desired Json. Aside from these two options, does anyone know of a clever way to make WebAPI give me OData 2.0 formatted Json objects?
@CODE:IQueryable http://localhost:XXXXX/vendor/?$filter=RONUMBER eq '2597385'&$select=VENDORID,VENDORNAME&$top=1&$format=Json [{"MEPartNumber":"11-2222-3-4444","MFGPartNumber":"123456-123","MFGSerialNumber":"ABC123","RONumber":"987654321","VendorId":"1234567","VendorName":"ACME SERVICE CENTER"}] OData V2: { 
  "d" : { 
    "results":  { 
        "__metadata": {
            "uri": "http://someserver/foo/vendor(1)",
            "type": "Vendor"
        },
        "MEPartNumber": "11-2222-3-4444",
        "MFGPartNumber": "123456-123",
        "MFGSerialNumber": "ABC123",

  }

@LINK:/questions/9824863/convention-based-dependency-injection-with-ninject-3-0-0
@TITLE:Convention Based Dependency Injection with Ninject 3.0.0
@CONTENT:I have two projects in my solution... a domain project and MVC3 web project (e.g. MyApp.Domain and MyApp.Web). Previously, when using Ninject.Extensions.Conventions ver. 2, I was able to use the following statement in the NinjectMVC3.cs file, and required dependencies throughout my solution (both web and domain) were injected properly (e.g. IFoo automatically bound to Foo). kernel.Scan(x =>
{
  x.FromAssembliesMatching("*");
  x.BindWith<DefaultBindingGenerator>();
});
 I have just upgraded to Ninject 3.0.0 (pre-release) and Ninject.Extensions.Conventions 3.0.0 (another pre-release) but the syntax for convention based binding has changed. I have figured out that I can use the following statement with the new version, but it only automatically binds the convention based interfaces in MyApp.Web and not in MyApp.Domain. The previous version bound interfaces throughout the application. kernel.Bind(x => x
    .FromThisAssembly()
    .SelectAllClasses()
    .BindToAllInterfaces());
 Any clue how I can configure convention based binding with the new Ninject version? I assume it has to do with specifying the assembly, but I have tried using FromAssembliesMatching("*") and it fails for everything then. -- Edit to show my exisiting code in RegisterServices method: -- private static void RegisterServices(IKernel kernel)
{
  // This code used to work with v.2 of Ninject.Extensions.Conventions
  // kernel.Scan(x =>
  // {
  //   x.FromAssembliesMatching("*");

@CONTENT:Due to the integration with Eclipse, the project key of my existing Sonar project needs to be changed. I can change the project key in the ant script and trigger a new analysis. However, Sonar considers it as a new project because the key is different now. This doesn't work for me because my existing project has quite a lot of history information. How can I change the project key while preserving the analysis history? Or, is there a way to merge 2 sonar projects?

@TITLE:Using PATINDEX to find varying length patterns in T-SQL
@CONTENT:I'm looking to pull floats out of some varchars, using PATINDEX() to spot them. I know in each varchar string, I'm only interested in the first float that exists, but they might have different lengths. e.g. 'some text 456.09 other text'
'even more text 98273.453 la la la'
 I would normally match these with a regex   "[0-9]+[.][0-9]+"
 However, I can't find an equivalent for the + operator, which PATINDEX accepts. So they would need to be matched (respectively) with: '[0-9][0-9][0-9].[0-9][0-9]' and '[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9].[0-9][0-9][0-9]' 
 Is there any way to match both of these example varchars with one single valid PATINDEX pattern?

@TITLE:Is it possible to determine if an IEnumerable<T> has deffered execution pending?
@CONTENT:I have a function that accepts an Enumerable. I need to ensure that the enumerator is evaluated, but I'd rather not create a copy of it (e.g. via ToList() or ToArray()) if it is all ready in a List or some other "frozen" collection. By Frozen I mean collections where the set of items is already established e.g. List, Array, FsharpSet, Collection etc, as opposed to linq stuff like Select() and where(). Is it possible to create a function "ForceEvaluation" that can determine if the enumerable has deffered execution pending, and then evaluate the enumerable?  public void Process(IEnumerable<Foo> foos)
 {
      IEnumerable<Foo> evalutedFoos = ForceEvaluation(foos)
      EnterLockedMode(); // all the deferred processing needs to have been done before this line. 
      foreach (Foo foo in foos) 
      {
           Bar(foo);
      }  
}

 public IEnumerable ForceEvaluation(IEnumerable<Foo> foos)
 {
      if(??????)
      { return foos}
      else
      {return foos.ToList()}

 }
 } After some more research I've realized that this is pretty much impossible in any practical sense, and would require complex code inspection of each iterator. So I'm going to go with a variant of Mark's answer and create a white-list of known safe types and just call ToList() anything not on that is not on the white-list. Thank you all for your help. Edit* After even more reflection, I've realized that this is equivalent to the halting problem. So very impossible.
@CODE:public void Process(IEnumerable<Foo> foos)
 {
      IEnumerable<Foo> evalutedFoos = ForceEvaluation(foos)
      EnterLockedMode(); // all the deferred processing needs to have been done before this line.

@TITLE:Do any C++11 thread-safety guarantees apply to third-party thread libraries compiled/linked with C++11?
@CONTENT:C++11 offers features like thread-safe initialization of static variables, and citing that question we'll say for instance: Logger& g_logger() {
    static Logger lg;
    return lg;
}
 So ostensibly (?) this is true regardless of whether a module compiled with a C++11 compiler included the thread headers, or spawned any threads in its body. You're offered the guarantee even if it were linked against another module that used C++11 threads and called the function. But what if your "other module" that calls into this code wasn't using C++11 threads, but something like Qt's QThread. Is atomic initialization of statics then outside of the scope of C++11's ability to make such a guarantee? Or does the mere fact of a module having been compiled with C++11 and then linked against other C++11 code imply that you will get the guarantee regardless? Does anyone know a good reference where issues like this are covered?

@LINK:/questions/9459030/django-when-to-use-teardown-method
@TITLE:Django when to use teardown method
@CONTENT:According to the docs: A TestCase, on the other hand, does not truncate tables and reload initial data at the beginning of a test. Instead, it encloses the test code in a database transaction that is rolled back at the end of the test. It also prevents the code under test from issuing any commit or rollback operations on the database, to ensure that the rollback at the end of the test restores the database to its initial state. In order to guarantee that all TestCase code starts with a clean database, the Django test runner runs all TestCase tests first, before any other tests (e.g. doctests) that may alter the database without restoring it to its original state. So if I have a test that looks like this: class GeneralUserCreateTest(TestCase):

    def setUp(self):
        create_roletypes()
        create_permissiontypes()
        self.client = Client()
        self.event = create_event()

    def test_create(self):
        create_url = reverse('event_user_signup', args=[self.event.slug])

        post_data = {
            'signup-account-email': 'foo@bar.com',
            'signup-account-password': 'foobar',
            'signup-account-password2': 'foobar',
            'signup-account-first_name': 'Foo',
            'signup-account-last_name': 'Bar',
        }
        response = self.client.post(create_url, data=post_data)
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 302)

        # check creation of user object
        self.assertEqual(User.objects.filter(email=post_data['signup-account-email']).count(), 1)
        user = User.objects.get(username=post_data['signup-account-email'])

        # user and profile objects created
        self.assertEqual(User.objects.all().count(), 1)
        self.assertEqual(Profile.objects.all().count(), 1)

        # get the first user and profile object to test against submitted field
        user = User.objects.all()[0]
        profile = Profile.objects.all()[0]
        role = Role.objects.filter(event=self.event, profiles=profile)[0]
        self.assertEqual(role.roletype.name, 'General')

        self.assertEqual(profile.first_name, post_data['signup-account-first_name'])
        self.assertEqual(profile.last_name, post_data['signup-account-last_name'])

@TITLE:.tooltip() is not a function
@CONTENT:I am trying to use the .tooltip() that I found from the following: Jquery-ui tooltip. What I have is a rails app that has some information in a table. In separate cells. Currently you can view the full information of a cell by clicking it which opens up jquery dialog which works fine. What I am trying to add to it is so that there will be two options. 1) Click the cell which brings up jquery dialog - which works already 2) Or hover a cell which shows an overview. Image From the image currently you have a booking that you can click on and it will show the booking information. However I am trying to extend it so that the user has the option of clicking to view the information or hovering over the cell to view the information. What is the best way to do this? I have the following code which works with and brings up the dialog. I tried adding: <td class="<%= booking.status %>" onmouseover='$("#booking<%= booking.id %>").tooltip()'>
 before which didn't work, and I probably understand that it wouldn't work because there would be a conflict between the two. In addition to this I did try using simpletip and qtip but seemed to not have no luck. Is what I am trying to do not feasible. <td class="<%= booking.status %>" onclick='$("#booking<%= booking.id %>").dialog()'>

@TITLE:Asp.Net MVC4 Web API - Return OData formatted Json from query without custom MediaTypeFormatter
@CONTENT:I am trying to use the new WebAPI beta to build a web service that I can query using the OData query string conventions and have it return OData formatted Json. I also want to use OData 2.0 (instead of 1.0). While it doesn't look like it has support for the $select option and headers seem to be able to override the $format option, returning an IQueryable generic seems to provide support for most other query options that I need. What I am really struggling with is how best to provide Json objects that meet the OData 2.0 specification. WebAPI just returns normal Json data when queried. For example, if I perform a GET request of something like this... http://localhost:XXXXX/vendor/?$filter=RONUMBER eq '2597385'&$select=VENDORID,VENDORNAME&$top=1&$format=Json
 ..to get the top hit matching the specified RONumber on my dev machine, I get a response containing the following Json... [{"MEPartNumber":"11-2222-3-4444","MFGPartNumber":"123456-123","MFGSerialNumber":"ABC123","RONumber":"987654321","VendorId":"1234567","VendorName":"ACME SERVICE CENTER"}]
 I need Json that meets the OData 2.0 spec. Something more like this.. OData V2: { 
  "d" : { 
    "results":  { 
        "__metadata": {
            "uri": "http://someserver/foo/vendor(1)",
            "type": "Vendor"
        },
        "MEPartNumber": "11-2222-3-4444",
        "MFGPartNumber": "123456-123",
        "MFGSerialNumber": "ABC123", 
        "RONumber":"987654321", 
        "VendorId":"1234567", 
        "VendorName": "ACME SERVICE CENTER"
    }
  }
}
 I suppose I could write a custom MediaTypeFormatter to get the structure that I want. I might also be able to modify my returned objects to mimic the structure of the desired Json. Aside from these two options, does anyone know of a clever way to make WebAPI give me OData 2.0 formatted Json objects?
@CODE:IQueryable http://localhost:XXXXX/vendor/?$filter=RONUMBER eq '2597385'&$select=VENDORID,VENDORNAME&$top=1&$format=Json [{"MEPartNumber":"11-2222-3-4444","MFGPartNumber":"123456-123","MFGSerialNumber":"ABC123","RONumber":"987654321","VendorId":"1234567","VendorName":"ACME SERVICE CENTER"}] OData V2: { 
  "d" : { 
    "results":  { 
        "__metadata": {
            "uri": "http://someserver/foo/vendor(1)",
            "type": "Vendor"
        },
        "MEPartNumber": "11-2222-3-4444",

  }

@TITLE:Oracle inequality operator: ?=
@CONTENT:Oracle SQL supposedly has four inequality operators: != ^= <> ?= (PL/SQL operators are a little different. They allow ~= instead of ?=. But that is not directly relevant here.) The manual includes the warning "Some forms of the inequality condition may be unavailable on some platforms." This applies to at least the 4th option, ?=. That syntax doesn't work for me on Windows, Linux, or Solaris. My questions are: What platforms support ?=? What platforms, if any, do not support !=, ^=, or <>? Is it worth avoiding one of those to ensure my code is as portable as possible?
@CODE:!= ^= <> ?= ~= ?= ?= ?= != ^= <>

@TITLE:Passing and saving anonymous function in matlab
@CONTENT:I would like a function (for example, a fit function) to return an anonymous function (usually stored in a struct) that I can save and use later. However, passing @func tends to pass a function pointer rather than the function itself. Is an inline function the only way to do this? I would like to avoid inline because it is extremely slow. If that question is not clear, here is a sample of problematic code: I write a testFunc.m file in some PATH     %testFunc.m
    function myfunc = testFunc()
        myfunc = @(x) x.^2;
    end
 I then store the function in a struct. (I know this really should be an object!)     >> mystruct = struct;
    >> mystruct.func = testFunc()
    >> mstruct.x = [1 2 3];
    >> save('myfile.mat','mystruct')
    >> mystruct.func(mystruct.x)

    ans = 

         1     4     9
 If I then move myfile.mat or testFunc.m and load myfile.mat, I cannot load the old struct. Instead, I get the error:     >> cd 'otherdir'
    >> load('../myfile.mat')

    Warning: Could not find appropriate function on path
    loading function handle PATH/testFunc.m>@(x)x.^2 
 I know there is a problem because, if I check functions     >> functions(mystruct.func)

    ans = 

         function: '@(x)x.^2'
             type: 'anonymous'
             file: 'PATH/testFunc.m'
        workspace: {2x1 cell}
 Is there some way to strip off the file workspace information? Are inline functions the only solution?
@CODE:struct @func inline inline testFunc.m PATH %testFunc.m
    function myfunc = testFunc()
        myfunc = @(x) x.^2;

@LINK:/questions/9240505/delphi-7-tidftp-ftp-security-password-protection
@TITLE:Delphi 7 TIdFTP FTP security (password protection)
@CONTENT:I have been dealing with FTP lately and I'm not sure about the security of the Indy component TIdFTP. That is why I have created some tests which I want to share with you so you could give your opinion of best practices and how it is done. First of all I just added the username and password in the component using the Object Inspector: And created a simple connection which works well: procedure TForm1.FormActivate(Sender: TObject);
begin
  try
    FTP.Connect();
    ShowMessage ('Connection success');
  except
    ShowMessage ('Connection failure');
  end;
end;
 The problem with this method is that if you use a simple tool like Resource Hacker you can immediately see all that data: Host = 'ivstefano.com'
Password = 'testpass'
Username = 'testuser'
 Then I decided to be a little bit smarter by removing it from the OI and inserting it in the code as everybody else does: FTP.Host:= 'ivstefano.com';
FTP.Username:= 'testuser';
FTP.Password:= 'testpass';
 Still if somebody is smarter he can use with ease some tool like Hex editor and see what is in compiled in the exe: So what I finally did was to make an encryption tool using OTP(One Time Pad Wiki) which you can download from here Sample OTP tool: I used it to encrypt my password 'testpass' with the keyword 'lemon'. Then I took the OTP encrypted string (#25+#2+#3+#7+#117+#19+#31+#6) and the key(#108+#101+#109+#111+#110), both in ASCII sum of characters and used them in my main ftp connection program to decrypt them using OTP again: function opt(text, key: String): String;
var i: Integer;
begin
  SetLength(Result, length(text));
  for i:= 1 to length(text) do
    Result[i]:= Char(Byte(text[i]) xor (i + Byte(key[i mod length(key)])));
end;

procedure TFTPTester.FormActivate(Sender: TObject);
var decyptedPass: String;
begin
  decyptedPass:= opt(#25+#2+#3+#7+#117+#19+#31+#6, #108+#101+#109+#111+#110);
  FTP.Host:= 'ivstefano.com';
  FTP.Username:= 'testuser';
  FTP.Password:= decyptedPass;
  try
    FTP.Connect();
    ShowMessage ('Connection success with pass: ' + decyptedPass);
  except
    ShowMessage ('Connection failure');
  end;
end;
 And as you can see it connects properly: And if we look at the Hex again we can see that the keyphrase and the encrypted password are here but at least not the plain text password: Conclusion: Still, the "hacker" can see the keyphrase and the encrypted pass but it is going to be harder to guess how to decrypt the pass using the key because he has to reverse engineer the code and see what kind of encryption I have used. Basically I can invent my own encryption and decryption so it is not necessary OTP but if somebody is more advanced he still could see the way I decrypt the encrypted password and access my FTP by applying it to the encrypted pass using the key. ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS: Maybe obfuscating the Delphi code would be a much better choice? QUESTION: What is a better way of protecting your password if any? SOURCES: Here can find the source codes for the FTPTester and OTP generator: Link to both
@CODE:TIdFTP procedure TForm1.FormActivate(Sender: TObject);
begin
  try
    FTP.Connect();
    ShowMessage ('Connection success');
  except
    ShowMessage ('Connection failure');
  end;
end; Host = 'ivstefano.com'
Password = 'testpass'
Username = 'testuser' FTP.Host:= 'ivstefano.com';
FTP.Username:= 'testuser';
FTP.Password:= 'testpass'; #25+#2+#3+#7+#117+#19+#31+#6 #108+#101+#109+#111+#110 function opt(text, key: String): String;
var i: Integer;
begin
  SetLength(Result, length(text));
  for i:= 1 to length(text) do
    Result[i]:= Char(Byte(text[i]) xor (i + Byte(key[i mod length(key)])));

@TITLE:Can Mockito verify parameters based on their values at the time of method call?
@CONTENT:I have a Foo class which is SUT and a Bar class, which is its collaborator. Foo calls run(List<Object> values) on the Bar with "expectedList" as an argument. Then, Foo will add a few more elements to this List so that its state will be different from what it was at the time of calling run(). Here's my test case. @Test
public void testFoo() {
    Bar collaborator = spy(new Bar()); 
    Foo sut = new Foo(collaborator);
    verify(collaborator).run(expectedList);
}
 Note that the collaborator is actually a spy object rather than a mock. This test case will fail because even though run() was called with an argument equal to expectedList, it was modified since and its current value no longer equals expectedList. However, this is the way it is supposed to work, so I'm wondering if there's a way to have Mockito store the snapshot of parameters when a method is called and verify them based on these values rather than the most recent values.

Curl takes the URL and uses that for upload to S3, but S3 returns 403 "The request signature we calculated does not match the signature you provided. Check your key and signing method." Here is the code I'm using to generate the pre-signed URL: public class S3Util {

            return "XXXXXXXXXXXXXX";
        }
    });
    static final String BUCKET = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX";

    static public URL getMediaChunkURL( MediaChunk mc, HttpMethod method ) {
        String key = ...
        //way in the future (for testing)...
        Date expiration = new Date( System.currentTimeMillis() + CalendarUtil.ONE_MINUTE_IN_MILLISECONDS*60*1000 );

        //this gets passed to the end user:
        return s3.generatePresignedUrl(req);
    }
}
 and in curl, run from bash, I execute this: echo Will try to upload chunk to ${location}
curl -i -X POST \
        -F 'Content-Type=application/octet-stream' \
        -F "file=@${fileName}" \
        ${location} || (echo upload chunk failed. ; exit 1 )
 Among other things, I have tried PUT, and I have tried "Content-type" (lowercase T). I realize I'm missing something (or somethings) obvious, but after reading the appropriate docs, googling and looking at lots of similar questions I'm not sure what that is. I see lots of hints about required headers, but I thought the resigned URL was supposed to eliminate those needs. Maybe not? TIA! Update: Just to be clear, I have tested downloads, and that works fine. Java looks like: GeneratePresignedUrlRequest req = new GeneratePresignedUrlRequest(BUCKET, key, HttpMethod.GET);
req.setExpiration(expiration);
 and curl is simply: curl -i ${location}

@TITLE:Formatting of DateUtils.getRelativeDateTimeString
@CONTENT:I have code like this DateUtils.getRelativeDateTimeString(context, due, DateUtils.MINUTE_IN_MILLIS, DateUtils.WEEK_IN_MILLIS,0)
 which is outputting strings formatted like in 23 hours, 6:18am
 I don't understand well the android documentation on this method. Is there a built in way to strip off the time or change the comma to be more sentence like? Either of "in 23 hours" or "in 23 hours at 6:18am" would be preferable to the current output. Thanks.

@LINK:/questions/9007093/rails-getting-validation-failed-error-but-no-errors-in-activerecord-error-model
@TITLE:Rails getting validation failed error, but no errors in ActiveRecord error model
@CONTENT:I am having a problem with validation errors when saving a model using save!. The ActiveRecord error model error messages are blank, so i dont know what errors are happening on a validation attempt. When I try errors.full_messages or errors.each_full according to the documentation, it should display the errors, which it doesn't. The model I am trying to save is the Orders model (ecommerce site using Spree). When an item in the order gets deleted, update_totals! gets called which recalculates the totals, and then save! is called, which triggers the validation error (this error happens very rarely but only when I'm logged in, and I havent been able to find the cause of it). The order model has two validations in its model:   validates_numericality_of :item_total
  validates_numericality_of :total
 i recorded order.item_total.inspect, order.total.inspect, and order.errors.full_messages.inspect and got this: Wed Jan 25 08:53:08 -0800 2012order item total: #<BigDecimal:15780c60,'0.279E2',8(16)>
Wed Jan 25 08:53:08 -0800 2012order total: #<BigDecimal:152bf410,'0.2448225E2',12(20)>
Wed Jan 25 08:53:08 -0800 2012: ERRORS SAVING ORDER: 
Wed Jan 25 08:53:08 -0800 2012[]
 item_total and total are stored in the mySQL database as decimal(8,2). The last line is order.errors.full_messages.inspect, which is an empty array. The validation error looks like this: ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid (Validation failed: {{errors}}):
  vendor/extensions/mgx_core/app/models/order.rb:382:in `update_totals!'

 I guess my question is twofold: 1. Why is my activerecord errors model not saying what the validation error is? 2. How do I fix this problem? Is my item_total and total valid for saving as decimal(8,2)? I am using rails 2.3.5 and spree 0.10.2

@TITLE:Random PHP Fatal error: Out of memory errors
@CONTENT:Since I moved a PHP app to a new server (PHP/5.3.8 running as Apache 2.2 module on 32-bit Windows Server 2003 R2) I'm getting random errors in the PHP error log: [09-Jan-2012 19:45:12] PHP Fatal error:  Out of memory (allocated 786432) (tried to allocate 17 bytes) in D:\site\util\odbc-connection.php on line 675

 I'm confused for the following reasons: It is not the standard error message you get when memory_limit is reached: Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 262144 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 800001 bytes)
 Whatever, memory_limit defaults to 256MB on the server and is set to 128MB on this app (thus 524,288 bytes should not be a problem). In the reported lines there's normally pretty innocent code, such as the start of function definitions... function linea($html){
 ... or foreach() loops of very small arrays: foreach($perfiles_basicos as $c => $v){
 I think I've already discarded all the obvious stuff (I've even searched for the memory_limit string in all *.php, *.ini, .htaccess and *.conf files in the hard disk) and I've written code to detect and log changes to the "128MB" limit (nothing was ever found) so I'm pretty clueless right now. Any hint or idea? Update #1: Apache's error.log shows that the web server gets restarted after I get an Out of memory error from PHP. Some are manual restarts and some are crashes like this: zend_mm_heap corrupted

@CONTENT:I often see examples of using the keyword this in jquery. Sometimes I see it used with the $ and parenthesis, other times without. And I thought I saw it used with a little of each. So,  var id = this.attr('id');

 var id = $(this).attr('id');

 var id = $this.attr('id');
 Are these all the same? Is there a preferred way? Is this a javascript thing and $(this) a jQuery thing? If so, where does $this fall? I know this is probably a total newbie question, but I haven't been able to get the simple, this, by itself, to work. I can only get $(this) to work. I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong, or if I've been reading examples with typos.

@TITLE:Requiring overridden virtual functions to call base implementations
@CONTENT:Within a C++ class hierarchy, is it possible to enforce a requirement that a particular virtual function always call its base class's implementation also? (Like the way constructors chain?) I'm looking at a case where a deep class hierarchy has some common interface functions which each child overrides. I'd like each derived class' override to chain through to the base class. It's straightforward to do this explicitly with eg the code below, but there's the risk that someone implementing a new derived class might forget to chain through to the base. Is there some pattern to enforce this, such that the compiler will throw an error if an override fails to chain the base? So, in class CAA 
{
   virtual void OnEvent( CEvent *e ) { 
     // do base implementation stuff;
   }
}

class CBB : public CAA
{
   typedef CAA BaseClass;
   virtual void OnEvent( CEvent *e ) { 
       DoCustomCBBStuff();
       BaseClass::OnEvent( e ); // chain to base
   }
}

class CCC : public CBB
{
   typedef CBB BaseClass;
   virtual void OnEvent( CEvent *e ) { 
       Frobble();
       Glorp();
       BaseClass::OnEvent( e ); // chain to CBB which chains to CAA, etc
   }
}

class CDD : public CCC
{
   typedef CCC BaseClass;
   virtual void OnEvent( CEvent *e ) { 
       Meep();
       // oops! forgot to chain to base!
   }
}
 is there a way, some template trick or syntactic gimmick, to make CDD throw a more obvious error?
@CODE:class CAA 
{
   virtual void OnEvent( CEvent *e ) { 
     // do base implementation stuff;
   }
}

class CBB : public CAA
{
   typedef CAA BaseClass;
   virtual void OnEvent( CEvent *e ) {

@TITLE:Does Javascript have an enhanced for loop syntax similar to Java's
@CONTENT:I am wondering if JavaScript has an enhanced for loop syntax that allows you to iterate over arrays. For example, in Java, you can simply do the following: String[] array = "hello there my friend".split(" ");

for (String s : array){

}
 output is: hello
there
my
friend
 Is there a way to do this in JavaScript? Or do I have to use array.length and use standard for loop syntax as below? var array = "hello there my friend".split(" ");

for (i=0;i<array.length;i++){
    document.write(array[i]);
}

@CONTENT:How to do integer -> string conversion has been answered many times on the internet... however, I'm looking for the most compact "C++-way" to do this. Since you're able to concatenate strings using the overloaded + operator, it would be preferable to be able to do something along the lines of the python-ish x = (stringVariable + str(intVariable)) concatenation, but I don't know if there's a canonical way to do this in C++. The most common solutions I see are: stringstream: If possible, it would be nice not to have 3 lines of code (declaration, writing to the stream, conversion to string) just to concatenate some letters and numbers. itoa: this works, but I'm looking for a canonical C++ solution. Also, I think itoa is technically non-standard although I could be wrong. boost format / boost lexical cast: this works too, but is there nothing in vanilla C++ that does the job?

 I've searched for a while and it appears that an argument passed with the ref keyword can't be stored. Trying to add the source argument to a list or to assign it to a field variable doesn't allow it to keep a reference to the actual delegate's original reference; so my questions are: Is there a way to unsubscribe from all the sources without passing their references again? If not, how can the class be changed in order to support it, but still maintain the subscription by passing a delegate through a method? Is it possible to achieve it without using Reflection? Is it possible to achieve it without wrapping the delegate/event in a class and then passing the class as a parameter for the subscription? Thank you. EDIT: It appears that without using a Wrapper or Reflection, there's no solution to the given problem. My intention was to make the class as much portable as possible, without having to wrap delegates in helper classes. Thanks everyone for the contributions.

Widths := pointer(ComboBox.Tag);

@TITLE:Unix to Windows: Alternative to vsnprintf to determine length?
@CONTENT:I am currently converting the code of one of our Linux libraries to a Windows DLL. Within this library I have a function which takes the last parameters in a printf-way (format string, then ellipsis). Within this function I use vsnprintf to format the supplied arguments. Since I want to know whether I can cram the final string into a small buffer or if I'd have to allocate memory for it, I am interested in determining the "would-be-length" of the formatted string. To do this, I am currently using vsnprintf like this (made up example code, obviously): #include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdarg.h>

void foo(const char* fmt, ...)
{
   int len = 0;
   va_list ap;

   va_start(ap, fmt);
   len = vsnprintf(0, 0, fmt, ap);
   printf("len = %d\n", len);
   va_end(ap);
}

int main(void)
{
   foo("12345%s", "67890");
   exit(0);
}
 This usage is covered by the Open Group Base Specifications Issue 6: vsnprintf(char *restrict s, size_t n, const char *restrict format, va_list ap) The [...] vsnprintf() [...] functions shall be equivalent to [...] snprintf(). snprintf(char *restrict s, size_t n, const char *restrict format, ...) If the value of n is zero on a call to snprintf(), nothing shall be written, the number of bytes that would have been written had n been sufficiently large excluding the terminating null shall be returned, and s may be a null pointer. The problem arised as I was compiling this code on the Windows-System (Visual Studio 2010) with /analyze on. The compiler/analyzer gave me the following: test.c(11) : warning C6309: Argument '1' is null: this does not adhere to function specification of 'vsnprintf' test.c(11) : warning C6387: 'argument 1' might be '0': this does not adhere to the specification for the function 'vsnprintf': Lines: 7, 8, 10, 11 A quick look at the MSDN entry for vsnprintf gave me this: If buffer or format is NULL, or if count is less than or equal to zero, these functions invoke the invalid parameter handler, as described in Parameter Validation. If execution is allowed to continue, these functions return -1. Curious enough, the above sample works nonetheless on Windows "as expected" (i.e. it returns to me the count of the characters that would be written). But since I don't want this to rely on something unspecified I'd like to know if there is a better, official way of achieving the same, without having to hope that this won't break in some future release. Thanks for your time!

 According to the documentation for index: the return value is an integer indicating the position of the first element within the jQuery object relative to its sibling elements. Emphasis on first element. But the above code returns 3. Based on the documentation shouldn't this code return 0? You can see it in action here: http://jsfiddle.net/Zf9Vv/ NOTE: My selector matches two elements: the first and last LI.
@CODE:<ul>

@CONTENT:The trait Map[A,+B] has a method def minBy [B] (f: ((A, B)) ? B)(implicit cmp: Ordering[B]): (A, B)
 I expected the B of the trait to be the same as the one in the method, but then I can't still make sense of this: val m2 = Map('a -> "1", 'b ->"2" ,'c ->"3")
m2.minBy((t:(Symbol,String))=>Integer.parseInt(t._2))
 Here, B of Map[A,+B] is String, but B of minBy is Int - or err I? So I expected the type of the method to be rather def minBy [C] (f: ((A, B)) ? C)(implicit cmp: Ordering[C]): (A, B)
 But thats not what the source says. If both are distinct, where should I have known? If they are not - can you spot, and point out, my mistake?

@TITLE:Android: How do I set the textsize for a layout?
@CONTENT:I am trying to set the textsize at a global level and cannot figure or find a way to do it. For example I have something like this: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

<ScrollView xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:layout_width="fill_parent"
    android:layout_height="fill_parent">

         android:shrinkColumns="*"  
         android:stretchColumns="*">
</TableLayout>
</ScrollView>
 The TableRows and TextViews themselves are generated dynamically depending on user input. The problem is I would like to set the base textSize globally based on a resource file without having to go and touch a bunch of code. Is there a way to tell the app, "hey app, use this as your base textSize for all the textViews?" Or phrased another way, in HTML I can set the font size at the body, div, and table levels. Is there something analogous I can do at one the layout (LinearLayout, TableLayout, ScrollView, etc.) levels?
@CODE:<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

<ScrollView xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"

@CONTENT:Possible Duplicate: How do I remove the visibility of spaces between inline elements? I usually format my source code to be easy read by humans, AFAIK browsers remove any \n\t characters from the source, so they do not get into the rendered html. Today I built a menu that had a few pixels between 2 anchors in the rendered html and I couldn't find the source of that "empty" space in CSS/HTML. After a few hours I remove the new line (\n) between the 2 anchors in the source (just in case) and the empty space disappeared. I created a fiddle here. The first menu element has the anchors in the same line in the source code, the other 2 menu items have a new line between the anchors. (hover the menu element to see what I'm talking about). I have the same behaviour in Firefox 8.0, Firefox Nightly 11.0a1 (2011-12-01) and Chromium 14.0.835.202 (Developer Build 103287 Linux) Ubuntu 11.10. I just can't understand why is this happening. What I did wrong and how can I avoid this behaviour (without changing the readability of the source code) ?

I'm still having issues getting t to get past the error "The type or namespace name 't' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)" .. not sure where I'm going wrong here.

    // create a new dynamic assembly
    AssemblyName an = new AssemblyName();
    an.Name = "DynamicRandomAssembly";
    AssemblyBuilder ab = ad.DefineDynamicAssembly(an, AssemblyBuilderAccess.Run);

    // create a new module to hold code in the assembly
    ModuleBuilder mb = ab.DefineDynamicModule("RandomModule");

    // create a type in the module

@TITLE:Why is RSACryptoServiceProvider.Encrypt() output not stable?
@CONTENT:Until today I was living under the impression that RSA encryption using RSA is deterministic. After all, how should signature verification work if it wasn't? To my big suprise, .NETs RSACryptoServiceProvider does not have a stable output when encrypting the same set of bytes with the same keys: [Fact]
public void Learning()
{
    const int keySize = 1024;

    System.Security.Cryptography.RSACryptoServiceProvider rsa = new System.Security.Cryptography.RSACryptoServiceProvider(keySize);

    var bytes = GenerateRandomDataWithLength( 36 );

    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++)
        Assert.Equal( rsa.Encrypt( bytes, false ), rsa.Encrypt( bytes, false ) );
}

byte[] GenerateRandomDataWithLength( int length )
{
    Random r = new Random();

    byte[] data = new byte[length];
    r.NextBytes( data );

    return data;
}
 I have skimmed through the PKCS Specification and I do understand the math behind RSA, so I really wonder why I am observing the output to be unstable. Mono's RSA implementation has a stable output. The unstable output of Encrypt does not affect decryption, which is well possible and yields the expected data.

@TITLE:Why does Git use the SHA1 of the *compressed* objects rather than the SHA1 of the original objects?
@CONTENT:I'm just curious as to why this choice was made - it basically rules out changing the compression algorithm used by Git - because it doesn't use the SHA1 of the raw blobs. Perhaps there is some efficiency consideration here. Maybe ZLIB is faster at compressing a file than the SHA1 algorithm is at creating the hash, so therefore compressing before hashing is faster? Here is a link to the original Git READMEby Linus: http://git.kernel.org/?p=git/git.git;a=blob;f=README;h=27577f76849c09d3405397244eb3d8ae1d11b0f3;hb=e83c5163316f89bfbde7d9ab23ca2e25604af290 And here is the relavent paragraph: "There are several kinds of objects in the content-addressable collection database. They are all in deflated with zlib, and start off with a tag of their type, and size information about the data. The SHA1 hash is always the hash of the compressed object, not the original one."

@TITLE:Gravity with air-time, acceleration and speed gaining
@CONTENT:I am trying to accomplish a gravity, where airtime is included, and also acceleration. I have tried using usual gravity, which looks something like this: velocity += gravity * dt;
position += velocity * dt;
 This would probably work good enough for a normal platformer game, but I am trying to make a game inspired by "The helicopter game", where you have to navigate through a tunnel, without touching the walls. what I want to do different, is that I want to be able to save up speed on the way down, which will be used on the way up again, so I will have some acceleration at the beginning. I also want some kind of airtime, so when you hit the top it would not force you down as fast as It would, if I had used the gravity from the code sample. This image illustrates the curve I would like to have: Please note that the whole controlling is done by one key, so for example you would fly up if you held down space, and dive if you released it. The character also never moves left or right, since it will have a static X position on the screen, so vectors can't be used. I have spent hours trying to make it work, but with no success. I have also tried searching on the internet, but without any luck. The game "Whale Trails" got the gravity I kind of want. Here is a link for a video of the game: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OQ0OWcuDJs I'm not that big of a physics guy, so it would be cool if you could give an example of the actual code I hope anyone can help me figure this out.

@LINK:/questions/8263549/performance-of-background-canvas-vs-regular-canvas
@TITLE:Performance of background-canvas vs. regular canvas
@CONTENT:A while back webkit (and thus Safari) began to support CSS canvas-backgrounds for elements (Source: http://www.webkit.org/blog/176/css-canvas-drawing/). This could greatly simplify the creation of games and multimedia, in that you dont need to inject a canvas-tag into a DIV (for instance), but simply hook into the background of the DIV directly. Something like this perhaps: <div id="gameview"
style="background: -webkit-canvas(myscreen); width: 320px; height: 480px;">
</div>

<script>
    var target = document.getElementById("gameview");
    var wd = target.clientWidth;
    var hd = target.clientHeight;
    var context =  document.getCSSCanvasContext("2d", "myscreen", wd, hd);
    /* draw stuff here */
</script>
 I was wondering, are there any speed penalties involved in this? In theory i think drawing to a background canvas should be faster than drawing to a canvas tag, especially if the target element is empty. Have anyone tested this for high-speed demos or games?

Is there a pre-made xml validation plugin/functionality in JS or jQuery like PHP's http://php.net/manual/de/domdocument.schemavalidate.php ? No ActiveX, since ActiveX is just supported by IE (afaik). And it is unhandy, if i remember correctly, the user always has to agree with it. I always just found, selfmade validation of XML (no schemas) or stuff made with ActiveX. So, if there is no xml validation plugin/functionality to which i just can pass a xml and a xsd, i would like to get a quick introduction on how i would do it myself, so i can imagen it better. Probably it's quick a lot of work for making my own xml validation against xsd, right? Thanks

@TITLE:Passing a enum value as a tag attribute in JSP
@CONTENT:I have a custom JSP tag which is using a parameter which is an enum. This approach is a consequence of using other classes which need this enumeration. The point is I have no clue how to assign an enum value in the EL: <mytaglib:mytag enumParam="${now what do I type here?}" />
 The only workaround which I found so far was to make the enumParam an Integer and convert it to desired values: <mytaglib:mytag enumParam="3" />
 I believe there must be a better way to do it. Please help.

@TITLE:Why can't I properly read 32bit registry values in HKCU on 64bit machine?
@CONTENT:I'm stumped on a windows 7 registry problem and while various questions and answers get me some of the way there, nothings I've seen addresses my particular issue. I don't know if other windows versions affects this problem, but we all have win7x64 machines. We have a wide variety of tools at our work, some C++, some C#, some python (2.6), etc. We also run a mix of 32 and 64 bit tools. In the past, we've happily stored registry information in HKLM. We've been working on moving stuff into HKCU. We've had a lot of discussions about whether to do this, affects on UAC, etc. We really want to try and make this move. That said: We are having trouble reading/writing registry keys out of HKCU/software/CompanyABC/App. We have a setup app write in python that writes out registry keys to the above location using _winreg. Whether or not we specify KEY_WRITE|KEY_WOW64_32KEY or just KEY_WRITE, the values get writte to HKCU/Software/WOW6432Node/companyABC/app. Fine. Then I have a C# app that tries to read these values. Using Microsoft.Win32.Registry, I open the subkey ('HKCU/Software/CompanyABC/app') and I don't see my values. Turns out that I'm seeing the following behavior: When reading/writing registry keys from HKLM, this stuff all just works. The python app will write to HKLM/Softare/Wow6432Node/CompanyABC/app, and the C# code will read from that location. This all makes proper sense too, given how we are building our C# apps, and writing the registry values via python Reading/writing the registry values from HKCU, I get different behavior. The _winreg functions will write to HKCU/Sofrware/Wow6432Node/CompanyABC/app, but the C# app will read from HKCU/Software/CompanyABC/app. The C# app is built as an x86 app (not Any CPU and not x64) so I assumed that the app would get properly redirected to the wow6432Node, but it doesn't seem to. after some investigation, it appears that HKCU/Software is different. This article seems to indicate that this area is "shared" and not redirected. If that is the case, then I cannot understand why our python app (again, using _winreg) is writing to a location in HKCU that uses the Wow6432Node - it seems like it should be writing it without that redirection in place. I suppose that it could be a bug in _winreg. I really want to avoid tacking on WOW6432Node explicitly in our tools, but that is where I am at today. Can anyone explain to me how I can make registry accesses from 32 and 64 bit processes into HKCU work correctly without having to resort to hard coded paths into the 32bit hive?

 I hate the fact I can update the balance directly. Perhaps that the old pure OO in me, I really would like to be able make the balance private, at least non-settable from outside the class. Thoughts

@TITLE:ctypes vs C extension
@CONTENT:I have a few functions written in C for a game project. These functions get called quite a lot (about 2000-4000 times per second). The functions are written in C for raw speed. Now, the easiest way for me to include these functions into Python is to use ctypes. The alternative is to write a C extension to Python around these functions (which takes quite a bit of extra effort). So I wondered, not including the initial loading of the DLL, how big is the overhead of ctypes? I'm using Python 2.7 (the standard CPython release), and I do not want to use an external library like Cython. I know this question has been asked before, but I haven't seen much information about the performance comparison between the two options.

@TITLE:SpecFlow wrongly using NUnit
@CONTENT:I've just (today) tried SpecFlow for the first time. I'm playing about by creating a new class library in VS2010 Pro and adding a SpecFlow Feature Definition file. Thing is, the integration doesn't appear to be working properly, with a variety of different errors. I've selected MsTest as the test runner, because I can't be bothered with invoking NUnit (I'd like to use NUnit in the long term but at the moment I just want to get some BDD code working). The generated code files however continue to reference NUnit - which is obviously wrong, since I've just told SpecFlow to run using MsTest. I've done everything I can think of to invoke the code generation again, including creating a brand new class library project with the MsTest option selected in Tools > Options > SpecFlow. If I leave the test runner field set to 'Auto' and right-click a feature file, then select 'Run SpecFlow Scenarios' I get an error message "Could not find matching test runner". If I instead change the test runner field to MsTest, I get a different error message on doing the same thing - "Object Reference not set to an instance of an object". I'm not surprised at this one since it's still trying to run NUnit tests even though I've explicitly asked for MsTest, though obviously it shouldn't nullref and present that to the user. What am I doing wrong? The documentation is not helpful, and as far as I can see, there's no FAQ. edit #1: I've established that the actual setting I'm looking for is provided using App.Config using the field <unitTestProvider name="MsTest" />. I can see what's happened - the field in the Visual Studio options menu doesn't seem to modify the project you're currently working on. Thing is, this makes it look like that field doesn't do anything at all. I've now persuaded SpecFlow to generate MsTest classes and run using the MSTest runner. So now the question morphs into a slightly different one: What (if anything) does the Tools > Options > SpecFlow > Test Runner Tool field do?

@CONTENT:I was reading the documentation of std::sub_match<BidirectionalIterator> and saw that it publicly inherits from std::pair<BidirectionalIterator, BidirectionalIterator>. Since a sub_match is simply a pair of iterators into a sequence of characters, with some additional functions, I can understand that it is implemented with a pair, but why use public inheritance? The problem with inheriting publicly from std::pair<T,U> is the same as inheriting publicly from most other standard classes: they are not meant to be manipulated polymorphically (notably they do not define a virtual destructor). Other members will also fail to work properly, namely the assignment operator and the swap member function (they will not copy the matched member of sub_match). Why did Boost developers and then the committee decided to implement sub_match by inheriting publicly from pair instead of using composition (or private inheritance with using declarations if they wanted to keep member access through first and second)?

@TITLE:No sto{short, unsigned short} functions in C++11? [closed]
@CONTENT:C++11 introduces convenience functions stoi, stol, stoll, stoul, stoull, stof, stod, and stold, which convert a string to an integer, long, long long, unsigned long, unsigned long long, float, double, or long double, respectively. Why no love for short and unsigned short? Besides the fact that the omission annoys me out of principle, I am finding myself having to work awkwardly around situations like this: #include <string>

struct S
{
    S(short);
};

int main()
{
    S s{std::stoi("4")};
}
 Error: test.cpp: In function 'int main()':
test.cpp:10:23: error: narrowing conversion from 'int' to 'short int' inside { } [-fpermissive]
 I'd like to instead write S s{std::stos("4")};, if only there were an stos... Instead I have to write S s{static_cast<short>(std::stoi("4"))};... oh wait, that won't do it either, that will silently truncate integers longer than shorts, as opposed to a hypothetical stos function which would throw an exception if the integer does not fit into a short. So basically I'm back to my pre-C++11 alternatives of stringstreams, boost::lexical_cast, and the like. EDIT: Since people seem to have a hard time locating my actual question, it's why are there no stos and stous functions to go along with the other ones?
@CODE:stoi stol stoll stoul stoull stof stod stold #include <string>

@TITLE:MySql statement prepare not sticking
@CONTENT:I'm attempting to use a prepared statement, and while the MySqlCommand executes just fine, the execution time is abysmal. I had it write the result of cmd.IsPrepared to the console, and sure enough, it is false. Here is where I setup the MySqlCommand: MySqlCommand cmd = con.CreateCommand();
cmd.CommandText = @"INSERT INTO dict (pre, dist, dict.char, score) VALUES(@pre, @dist, @char, @score) ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE score = score + @score";
cmd.Parameters.Add("@pre", MySqlDbType.VarChar, 32);
cmd.Parameters.Add("@dist", MySqlDbType.Int32);
cmd.Parameters.Add("@char", MySqlDbType.VarChar, 1);
cmd.Parameters.Add("@score", MySqlDbType.Double);
cmd.Prepare();
 I've also tried executing the Prepare() before adding parameters with the same result. I then have a loop of code that does some computation and sets variables like so: cmd.Parameters[3].Value = score;
 ...and does nothing else to the command until it comes time to run: Console.WriteLine(cmd.IsPrepared);
cmd.ExecuteNonQuery();
 The result to the console is always false. This is all done within a basic transaction, but that doesn't seem like it should mess things up. I do open the transaction before I setup the MySqlCommand, though. Any ideas as to where this is going wrong? edit: I replicated the code in java, and the prepared statements work fine in it. So it's not a problem with my database server itself, it is specifically a problem in .net. Surely the .net/connector isn't broken for everyone, so what could possibly be the deal here? And it definitely isn't prepared and simply not setting that bool value, the running time in .net for some test input is so long I don't have the patience to wait it out, but in java the same input runs in ~3 minutes. Both use basically the same code. Here's a simple test I did in .net, so you can see the full code of what I'm trying (I removed the UID and password from the connection string, but in the normal code they are there, a connection is established, and the statement enters data into the database):         using (MySqlConnection con = new MySqlConnection(@"SERVER=localhost;DATABASE=rb;UID=;PASSWORD=;"))

                      {
                          A = i.A,
                          B = "",    // i doesn't know this, this comes from elsewhere
                          C = i.C
                      }
 I also have another query doing a similar thing: List<myClass2> otherItems = new List<myClass2>(from j in context
                            select new myClass2
                            {
                                A = j.A,   // A is the intersection, there will only be 1 A here but many A's in items
                                B = j.B
                            }
 In reality these classes are much larger and query data that is separated not only by database but by server as well. Is it possible to use a LINQ query to populate the property B for all items where items.A intersect? All of the built in LINQ predicates appear only to do aggregates, selections or bool expressions. In my brain I had something like this, but this is all off: items.Where(x => x.B = (otherItems.Where(z => z.A == x.A).Single().B));
 Or am I being ridiculous with trying to make this work in LINQ and should just abandon it in favor of a for loop where the actual setting becomes trivial? Because of deadlines I will be resorting to the for loop (and it's probably going to end up being a lot more readable in the long run anyway), but is it possible to do this? Would an extension method be necessary to add a special predicate to allow this?
@CODE:List<myClass> items = new List<myClass>(from i in context
                      select new myClass
                      {

                            select new myClass2

@TITLE:Can std::forward_list members be implemented as static?
@CONTENT:std::forward_list provides insert_after and erase_after members which may not need to actually access the std::forward_list object. Therefore they can be implemented as static member functions and be called without a list object X useful for an object that wants to delete itself from a list, which is a very common use. EDIT: This optimization only applies to forward_list specializations on std::allocator or user-defined stateless allocators. Can a standard-conforming implementation do this? 17.6.5.5/3 says A call to a member function signature described in the C++ standard library behaves as if the implementation declares no additional member function signatures. with a footnote A valid C++ program always calls the expected library member function, or one with equivalent behavior. An implementation may also define additional member functions that would otherwise not be called by a valid C++ program. It's not clear to me whether adding static would create a "different" member function, but removing an (implicit) argument shouldn't break anything that adding defaulted arguments wouldn't, and that is legal. (You cannot legally take a PTMF to any standard member function.) It strikes me that the library should be allowed to do this, but I'm not sure if some rule would be broken. And how normative are the listed member function prototypes?

@TITLE:The most Pythonic way of checking if a value in a dictionary is defined/has zero length
@CONTENT:Say I have a dictionary, and I want to check if a key is mapped to a nonempty value. One way of doing this would be the len function: mydict = {"key" : "value", "emptykey" : ""}
print "True" if len(mydict["key"]) > 0 else "False"  # prints true
print "True" if len(mydict["emptykey"]) > 0 else "False"  # prints false
 However, one can rely on the semantics of Python and how if an object is defined it evaluates to true and leave out the len call: mydict = {"key" : "value", "emptykey" : ""}
print "True" if mydict["key"] else "False"  # prints true
print "True" if mydict["emptykey"] else "False"  # prints false
 However, I'm not sure which is more Pythonic. The first feels "explicit is better than implicit", however the second feels "simple is better than complex". I also wonder if the leaving out the len call could bite me as the dict I'm working with doesn't necessarily contain strings, but could contain other len-able types (lists, sets, etc). OTOH, in the former (with the len call) if None gets stored as a value the code will blow up, whereas the non-len version will work as expected (will eval to false). Which version is safer and more Pythonic? Edit: clarifying assumptions: I know the key is in the dictionary, and I know values will be len-able. I also cannot avoid having zero-length values enter the dictionary. Edit #2: It seems like people are missing the point of my question. I'm not trying to determine the most Pythonic/safest way of checking if a key is present in a dictionary, I'm trying to check if a value has zero length or not
@CODE:mydict = {"key" : "value", "emptykey" : ""}
print "True" if len(mydict["key"]) > 0 else "False"  # prints true
print "True" if len(mydict["emptykey"]) > 0 else "False"  # prints false mydict = {"key" : "value", "emptykey" : ""}

@TITLE:Malloc performance in a multithreaded enviroment
@CONTENT:I've been running some experiments with the openmp framework and found some odd results I'm not sure I know how to explain. My goal is to create this huge matrix and then fill it with values. I made some parts of my code like parallel loops in order to gain performance from my multithreaded enviroment. I'm running this in a machine with 2 quad-core xeon processors, so I can safely put up to 8 concurrent threads in there. Everything works as expected, but for some reason the for loop actually allocating the rows of my matrix have an odd peak performance when running with only 3 threads. From there on, adding some more threads just makes my loop take longer. With 8 threads taking actually more time that it would need with only one. This is my parallel loop:  int width = 11;
 int height = 39916800;
 vector<vector<int> > matrix;
 matrix.resize(height);    
 #pragma omp parallel shared(matrix,width,height) private(i) num_threads(3)
 {
   #pragma omp for schedule(dynamic,chunk)
   for(i = 0; i < height; i++){
     matrix[i].resize(width);
   }
 } /* End of parallel block */
 This made me wonder: is there a known performance problem when calling malloc (which I suppose is what the resize method of the vector template class is actually calling) in a multithreaded enviroment? I found some articles saying something about performance loss in freeing heap space in a mutithreaded enviroment, but nothing specific about allocating new space as in this case. Just to give you an example, I'm placing below a graph of the time it takes for the loop to finish as a function of the number of threads for both the allocation loop, and a normal loop that just reads data from this huge matrix later on. Both times where measured using the gettimeofday function and seem to return very similar and accurate results across different execution instances. So, anyone has a good explanation? Nelson R. P?rez
@CODE:int width = 11;
 int height = 39916800;
 vector<vector<int> > matrix;
 matrix.resize(height);    
 #pragma omp parallel shared(matrix,width,height) private(i) num_threads(3)
 {
   #pragma omp for schedule(dynamic,chunk)
   for(i = 0; i < height; i++){
     matrix[i].resize(width);
   }
 } /* End of parallel block */

@LINK:/questions/7490093/drawing-outline-of-intersecting-circles
@TITLE:Drawing outline of intersecting circles
@CONTENT:I have a set of points and each one has an area of "influence" or essentially a radius. I would like to be able to draw each one of these influence circles for all the points as a simple circular line. They will overlap however I wish to draw the outside of the shape formed. I know this would probably require me working out where they intersect and somehow forming a total shape to draw. The problem is that some points might not even touch others! So I need to be able to work that out too. I have attempted to illustrate what I mean simply: Note that I wish to draw simply the black line, no fill. This is because I wish background images and other geometry to show through. I would be doing this in openGL so the circle would be probably made using GL_LINES or some such with various vertices forming the curves but I really just don't have any idea about how I would work out this perimeter. If anyone has any advice or could point me at how I might go about working this out it would be greatly appreciated! This might be more of a maths question, I am not looking for bits of code but actually how to go about working out these shapes. I just can't think about how to do it! ***Edit: with the solution I came up with, hopefully might help someone else! So I used the suggested ideas and basically decided the best way would be to draw using the stencil buffer. This now means that I loop through my points 3 times but I need to do some careful sorting of them to find only visible ones anyway. So code wise I now have this: private void stencilCircleAroundStars()
{
    //Lets try and draw something here using stencil
    glColorMask(false, false, false, false); //Disable colour mask
    glEnable(GL_STENCIL_TEST); // Enable Stencil Buffer For "marking" the outer circle
    glDisable(GL_DEPTH_TEST);// Disable Depth Testing

    for (Object value : stars.values())
    {
        Star star = (Star)value;

        glStencilFunc(GL_ALWAYS, 1, 1); // Always Passes, 1 Bit Plane, 1 As Mask
        glStencilOp(GL_KEEP, GL_KEEP, GL_REPLACE); // We Set The Stencil Buffer To 1 Where We Draw Any Polygon

        //Draw the large circle
        starOb.location.copy(star.location);
        starOb.setScale(2000);
        starOb.draw();
    }

    for (Object value : stars.values())
    {
        Star star = (Star)value;
        //Now we change the functions and remove a slightly smaller circle from buffer.
        glStencilFunc(GL_ALWAYS, 0, 0); // Always passes, 0 bit plane, 0 as mask;
        glStencilOp(GL_KEEP, GL_KEEP, GL_REPLACE); // We Set The Stencil Buffer To 0 Where We Draw Any Polygon
        starOb.location.copy(star.location);
        starOb.setScale(1900);
        starOb.draw();
    }

    //Now we enable the colour
    glColorMask(true, true, true, true);
    glStencilFunc(GL_EQUAL, 1, 1); // We Draw Only Where The Stencil Is 1
    glStencilOp(GL_KEEP, GL_KEEP, GL_KEEP); // Don't Change The Stencil Buffer

    glColor4f(0.5f, 1.0f, 0.5f, 0.5f);
    for (Object value : stars.values())
    {
        Star star = (Star)value;
        starOb.location.copy(star.location);
        starOb.setScale(2000);
        starOb.draw();
    }

    //Now we are done .. disable
    glDisable(GL_STENCIL_TEST);  
}
 My points are in essence entities called "stars" for the purpose of my program and StarOb is a collection of quads I have loaded from a file which form a nice smooth circle. I disable colour mask and I loop through once, drawing the largest circle I can into the stencil buffer and setting a value of 1. I then loop around again drawing the smaller scaled circle into the stencil buffer but this time setting a value of 0. This should leave a border around any star that is not touching other stars and will effectively remove where they overlap. I finally re-enable the colour mask and actually draw the coloured circles. the stencil buffer stops the insides from being rendered and I get what I wanted! I then disable the stencil buffer. If you really wanted to see it, here's a video of generating several increasing amounts of points: Video of it running Here is a low quality version of how it came out (background was not drawn while testing):
@CODE:private void stencilCircleAroundStars()
{
    //Lets try and draw something here using stencil
    glColorMask(false, false, false, false); //Disable colour mask
    glEnable(GL_STENCIL_TEST); // Enable Stencil Buffer For "marking" the outer circle
    glDisable(GL_DEPTH_TEST);// Disable Depth Testing

    for (Object value : stars.values())
    {
        Star star = (Star)value;

        glStencilFunc(GL_ALWAYS, 1, 1); // Always Passes, 1 Bit Plane, 1 As Mask
        glStencilOp(GL_KEEP, GL_KEEP, GL_REPLACE); // We Set The Stencil Buffer To 1 Where We Draw Any Polygon

        //Draw the large circle
        starOb.location.copy(star.location);
        starOb.setScale(2000);
        starOb.draw();
    }

    for (Object value : stars.values())
    {
        Star star = (Star)value;
        //Now we change the functions and remove a slightly smaller circle from buffer.
        glStencilFunc(GL_ALWAYS, 0, 0); // Always passes, 0 bit plane, 0 as mask;
        glStencilOp(GL_KEEP, GL_KEEP, GL_REPLACE); // We Set The Stencil Buffer To 0 Where We Draw Any Polygon
        starOb.location.copy(star.location);
        starOb.setScale(1900);
        starOb.draw();
    }

    //Now we enable the colour
    glColorMask(true, true, true, true);
    glStencilFunc(GL_EQUAL, 1, 1); // We Draw Only Where The Stencil Is 1
    glStencilOp(GL_KEEP, GL_KEEP, GL_KEEP); // Don't Change The Stencil Buffer

    glColor4f(0.5f, 1.0f, 0.5f, 0.5f);

    {
        Star star = (Star)value;

@TITLE:Is there a better way to benchmark a C program than timing?
@CONTENT:I'm coding a little program that has to sort a large array (up to 4 million text strings). Seems like I'm doing quite well at it, since a combination of radixsort and mergesort already cut the original q(uick)sort execution time in less than half. Execution time being the main point, since this is what I'm using to benchmark my piece of code. My question is: Is there a better (i. e. more reliable) way of benchmarking a program than just time the execution? It kinda works, but the same program (with the same background processes running) usually has slightly different execution times if run twice. This kinda defeats the purpose of detecting small improvements. And several small improvements could add up to a big one... Thanks in advance for any input! Results: I managed to get gprof to work under Windows (using gcc and MinGW). gcc behaves poorly (considering execution time) compared to my normal compiler (tcc), but it gave me quite some insight.

@CONTENT:I have a Panel as a container this panel has a picture on it as a background, within the container panel, I have another panel where I gonna put some information in labels, that information will change in time, what I want is a transition when a new info is about to show, fade out the information panel with the old info and then fade in the same panel with the new info. At the time of the fade out the information panel I will be able to see the backgroud image of the container panel. Both panels have BorderStyle=FixedSingle, also the info panel has a backcolor color. Now my question is: is there any way to fade in/out the information panel and the whole content within too?

@TITLE:Better/faster way to fill a big array in C#
@CONTENT:I have 3 *.dat files (346KB,725KB,1762KB) that are filled with a json-string of "big" int-Arrays. Each time my object is created (several times) I take those three files and use JsonConvert.DeserializeObject to deserialize the arrays into the object. I thought about using binary-files instead of a json-string or could I even save these arrays directly? I dont need to use these files, it's just the location the data is currently saved. I would gladly switch to anything faster. What are the different ways to speed up the initialization of these objects?

@TITLE:Richfaces Skin Overriding Styleclass
@CONTENT:I have a JSF2/Richfaces 4 project in which I want to use one of the default skins, BUT I also want to set some things' style using my own custom style sheet. This sounds pretty straightforward, but what I am finding is that in at least some cases, my own style is not being used. To be explicit, here are my relevant web.xml context-params: <context-param>
    <param-name>org.richfaces.skin</param-name>
    <param-value>blueSky</param-value>
</context-param>
<context-param>
    <param-name>org.richfaces.control_skinning</param-name>
    <param-value>enable</param-value>
</context-param>
<context-param>
    <param-name>org.richfaces.control_skinning_classes</param-name>
    <param-value>enable</param-value>
</context-param>
 My CSS file inclusion: <h:outputStylesheet name="jsp-css.css" library="css" />
 One such actual style definition: .obsOptBtnSel{
background-color: transparent;
background-image: url('/images/circleY.gif');
background-repeat: no-repeat;
background-position: center;
border: none;
text-align: center;
width: 2em;
height: 2em;
}
 And the actual button using the style: <h:commandButton
value="?"
styleClass="#{obs.observation.observationExtent == -1.0 ? 'obsOptBtnSel' : 'obsOptBtnUns'}"
id="unknownButton"
/>
 So, one would think that I'd inherit the styles from the blueSky skin where relevant, and then since I'm specifying a style class, any properties mentioned in the custom style sheet would be overridden. But instead, when I look at the element in Firebug, I see my styleClass getting overridden by that specified by the skin, e.g. it keeps using the blueSky background image instead of mine. I know I could fix this by simply putting !important after all my styling in the stylesheet, but that seems like a really crappy and unnecessary way to deal with this problem. What am I doing wrong here? Is there another solution?

    <param-name>org.richfaces.skin</param-name>

@TITLE:How do I stop visual studio inserting a space between function definition and immediate call?
@CONTENT:I am using the visual studio JSLint plugin to keep my javascript in order, which seems to work really well apart from this one problem. If I type in x = (function () {
}())
 And then put the semicolon on the end, Visual studio corrects it to: x = (function () {
} ());
 And then JSLint complains JS Lint: Unexpected space between '}' and '('. Obviously this is fixable by removing the space, but visual studio is very persistent in putting the space back. Putting a semicolon anywhere inside the function, which is most of the file, will cause VS to put the space back. This is starting to get annoying. I've tried mucking about with the visual studio Javascript editor settings ('insert space after...'), but can't seem to stop it doing this. Another way this could be expressed is x = (function () {
})();
 Which VS leaves alone, but JSLint says JS Lint: Move the invocation into the parens that contain the function. So no dice there. Any suggestions? I know I can turn bits of JSLint off, even just around this last line of the file, but that's going to look messy, I'd like to do a bit better.

@CONTENT:I'm trying to replace an ad-hoc logging system with Python's logging module. I'm using the logging system to output progress information for a long task on a single line so you can tail the log or watch it in a console. I've done this by having a flag on my logging function which suppresses the newline for that log message and build the line piece by piece. All the logging is done from a single thread so there's no serialisation issues. Is it possible to do this with Python's logging module? Is it a good idea?

@CONTENT:I can not find any documentation that specifies on which thread WebClient raises its events. I ran some tests and determined the following: If called from a UI thread (say from an event handler) the event handler will be executed on that thread. As a test, I added an infinite loop after the call to OpenReadAsync. The event handler was never called. If there is no UI thread, like in a console application, the event handler will be executed on a thread pool thread. In this case, if I wanted to provide some results the rest of the application, I would have to be aware of threading issues. Is this behaviour documented anywhere? I found nothing. I have the basically the same question concerning the new async features of C# - eventually, the asynchronous code will have to be executed. Will that also spawn a thread pool thread when there is no UI thread? Will that, in turn, require thread safe code? I feel that I am missing something here - I can only find very little information about this, but this seems important to me.

@CONTENT:hope the title's pretty self-explanatory. I'm using mongoid as my ORM for a Rails app, and I was wondering if anybody knew if it has an equivalent to ActiveRecord's serialize method. I've looked through the mongoid documentation but haven't been able to find anything yet. Here's an example of the model: class Foo

  field :params, type: String
  serialize :params            # method from ActiveRecord

@LINK:/questions/7092395/how-to-render-images-in-jsf-2-0
@TITLE:How to render images in JSF 2.0
@CONTENT:According to the JSF 2.0 specification, there are three ways to use h:graphicImage depending on the way by which JSF generates the "src" attribute of the HTML tag: <h:graphicImage value="#{resource['images:next.gif']}"/>

<h:graphicImage library="images" name="next.gif"/>

<h:graphicImage url="/resources/images/next.gif"/>
 The specification states that the first two should render exactly the same markup. In my JSF implementation (MyFaces 2.0.2), here is the output HTML that is generated: <img src="/AppName/faces/javax.faces.resource/next.gif?ln=images">

<img src="/AppName/faces/javax.faces.resource/next.gif?ln=images">

<img src="/AppName/resources/images/next.gif">
 So it seems that if I use (name, library) or (value) attributes, the image is always going to be streamed to the client by JSF's servlet. If I use (url) attribute, I can give direct link to the resource with no servlet intervention. For me, the second approach - direct server URL to resource, is faster. In what cases the first approach - specifying (name, library) or (value) attributes, be used?
@CODE:<h:graphicImage value="#{resource['images:next.gif']}"/>

<h:graphicImage library="images" name="next.gif"/>

@TITLE:SSE vectorization of math 'pow' function gcc
@CONTENT:I was trying to vectorize a loop that contains the use of the 'pow' function in the math library. I am aware intel compiler supports use of 'pow' for sse instructions - but I can't seem to get it to run with gcc ( I think ). This is the case I am working with: int main(){
        int i=0;
        float a[256],
        b[256];

        float x= 2.3;


        for  (i =0 ; i<256; i++){
                a[i]=1.5;
        }

        for (i=0; i<256; i++){
                b[i]=pow(a[i],x);
        }

        for (i=0; i<256; i++){
                b[i]=a[i]*a[i];
        }
    return 0;

}
 I'm compiling with the following: gcc -O3 -Wall -ftree-vectorize -msse2 -ftree-vectorizer-verbose=5 code.c -o runthis
 This is on os X 10.5.8 using gcc version 4.2 (I used 4.5 as well and couldn't tell if it had vectorized anything - as it didn't output anything at all). It appears that none of the loops vectorize - is there an allignment issue or some other issue that I need t use restrict? If I write one of the loops as a function I get slightly more verbose output(code): void pow2(float *a, float * b, int n) {
        int i;
        for (i=0; i<n; i++){
                b[i]=a[i]*a[i];
        }
}
 output (using level 7 verbose output): note: not vectorized: can't determine dependence between *D.2878_13 and *D.2877_8
bad data dependence.
 I looked at the gcc auto-vectorization page but that didnt' help to much. If it is not possible to use pow in the gcc version what where could I find the resource to do a pow - equivalent function (I'm mostly dealing with integer powers). Edit so I was just digging into so other source- how did it vectorize this?!: void array_op(double * d,int len,double value,void (*f)(double*,double*) ) { 
    for ( int i = 0; i < len; i++ ){
        f(&d[i],&value);
    }
};
 The relevant gcc output: note: Profitability threshold is 3 loop iterations.

note: LOOP VECTORIZED.
 Well now I'm at a loss -- 'd' and 'value' are modified by a function that gcc doesn't know about - strange? Maybe I need to test this portion a little more thoroughly to make sure the results are correct for the vectorized portion. Still looking for a vectorized math library - why aren't there any open source ones?
@CODE:int main(){
        int i=0;
        float a[256],
        b[256];

@TITLE:assign value of readonly variable in private method called only by constructors
@CONTENT:C# compiler gave me the following error CS0191: A readonly field cannot be assigned to (except in a constructor or a variable initializer) Do I have to move the code (in my private function) into the constructor? That sounds awkward. Note that the private method was intended only to be called by the constructor. I expect that there is some sort of attribute that I can use to mark the method corresponding.

@TITLE:How can I make vim align the ternary ?: operator nicely?
@CONTENT:I like to write code using the ternary ?: operator like this: std::string result = input.empty() ? createNewItem()
                                   : processInput( input );
 How can I configure vim so that when pressing Return after having typed createNewItem() indents the next line so that the cursor is in the same column as the last ? so that I can just continue typing : processInput( input );? I tried looking at the cinoptions-values setting but I didn't see anything relevant.

@TITLE:Algorithm to loop over an array from the middle outwards?
@CONTENT:I'm working on a divide-and-conquer algorithm (in fact, one that does curve fitting to a number of input points). For the 'divide' part, I need to calculate an error term for each point, and if the error exceeds a given threshold, I wish to split the curve at that point and process the left and right sections of the input separately. A simple loop does the trick; but it would be advantageous for me to start at the middle of the current section and work outwards. (To clarify: if I do find a point whose error is too large, I recursively call and generate separate curves for the left and right sections - if all the points are within the threshold, then my curve fits and I return). After a bit of head-scratching, I came up with this (the points are in an array, and the current section is from startIndex to endIndex inclusive): int steps = (endIndex+1-startIndex);
int i = (startIndex+endIndex)>>1;
int stepdir = 1;
for(int q=0; q<steps; q++, i+=stepdir*q, stepdir=-stepdir)
{
   // test point i here and return early if error exceeds threshold
}
 In other words, beginning near the middle, go one index forward, two back, three forward, four back... It works, and I'm sure it's efficient, but it strikes me that there should be a cleaner way to do it, in particular, I ended up having to check the Java language spec to make sure that the statements in the for update expression did evaluate in sequence (even though , is not a sequence operator as it is in C/C++). Any ideas gratefully appreciated. Is there a cleaner way?
@CODE:startIndex endIndex int steps = (endIndex+1-startIndex);

@TITLE:View-based NSTableView equivalent of tableView:willDisplayCell:forTableColumn:row?
@CONTENT:In the past, with a cell-based NSTableView, you could modify attributes of the cell in the tableView:willDisplayCell:forTableColumn:row method (for example, setting a custom NSAttributedString for one of the cells to display). Is there an equivalent method for view-based table view's? Implementing tableView:willDisplayCell:forTableColumn:row doesn't get called in a view-based table view, so I'm not sure what to do. I want to set a NSAttributedString using the setAttributedStringValue method of the default NSTextField instance that is included in a NSTableCellView instance created from within Xcode. My efforts so far always get undone by the table view itself. Any ideas?

 Any one can tell me why getCanonicalName here will throw this error? (JDK 1.6.0_20) UPDATE After some research, I find that when you define the class you must load the its parent class first. But it's hard. When I write to the binary, they are just ordered by the sequence in the file folder. So when I load them, they will not order by the class hieriarchy. It's a bit annoying here.For now I just loop the classes , then load the error class again. This is workaround but not a good one.

@TITLE:Entity Framework losing Sql DateTime precision
@CONTENT:I am querying my EDM using Entity SQL and am losing millsecond precision on my DateTime values. For example 2011/7/20 12:55:15.333 PM gets changed to 2011/7/20 12:55:15.000 PM. I have confirmed that in SQL the milliseconds are recorded precisely. There is a Precision attribute I can apply in the .edmx XML file, but I do not know what sort of values it takes,       <Property Name="Timestamp"
                Type="DateTime"
                Nullable="false"

 Does anyone know how to use this precision attribute ? Thanks.

@CONTENT:The json gem does not allow for directly encoding strings to their JSON representation. I tentatively ported this PHP code: $text = json_encode($string);
 to this Ruby: text = string.inspect
 and it seemed to do the job but for some reason if the string itself contains a literal string (it's actually JS code) with newlines, these newlines \n will stay as-is \n, not be encoded to \\n. I can understand if this is the correct behaviour of #inspect, but... How does one encode a string value to its JSON representation in Ruby?

 This will crash on f.getAbsolutePath(). It's currently running in the emulator emulating a 2.3.3 system at 1024x600. Google returns nothing on this...so why on earth is this happening? And how do I fix it?! Thanks a lot! EDIT:: SOLVED! Well, somewhat... I think it turned out to be an emulator error. I changed the skin of the emulator to WXVGA, and that then allowed it to write the files correctly. And when I then changed the resolution back to 1024x600 it kept working correctly. So, if anyone has a similar error, I suggest you play around with the emulator until you find a way past the bug.

@LINK:/questions/6757048/msdn-dispose-example-erroneous-when-to-set-managed-references-to-null
@TITLE:MSDN Dispose() example erroneous? (when to set managed references to null)
@CONTENT:MSDN's example pattern for implementing a Dispose() method depicts setting the reference to a disposed managed resource to null (_resource = null), but does so outside the if (disposing) block: protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)
{
    // If you need thread safety, use a lock around these 
    // operations, as well as in your methods that use the resource.
    if (!_disposed)
    {
        if (disposing) {
            if (_resource != null)
                _resource.Dispose();
                Console.WriteLine("Object disposed.");
        }

        // Indicate that the instance has been disposed.
        _resource = null;
        _disposed = true;   
    }
}
 Shouldn't _resource = null be placed inside this code block? If a call to Dispose(false) is made then _resource will be null and unable to be subsequently disposed! ?? Of course, Dispose(false) is only called (in practice) by the runtime during finalization. But if _resource wasn't previously disposed, what is the need to set it to null at this point when the object (including the _resource member field) is about to be garbage collected? [end of original question] Follow up: After much reading, it appears setting the reference to null is not necessary, but may be a good idea for "heavy" member objects if you have reason to believe the containing class (the one being disposed) might not be garbage collected soon. Know that object disposal is no assurance that the object has been "released" by consuming code. The disposed object might be kept around (in a collection or otherwise) for various purposes, or just in error. I can imagine an application that uses objects from a collection then disposes of them, but keeps them in the collection for a later process to perform removal and log final state (or something like that... who knows...) Conclusions: Setting references to "heavy" member objects to null releases them for garbage collection even if the disposed object is not released. It is overkill to clear references for all objects. Hence, placement of the _resource = null statement (the original question) is not important for two reasons: (A) Using it at all is only something to think about after reading the above; (B) In the MSDN example, it executes for both Dispose(true) and Dispose(false), but the latter only occurs when the object is finalized and just about to be garbage collected anyway! Thus, my preference will be to place _resource = null inside the most inner if block: if (disposing) {
    if (_resource != null) {
        _resource.Dispose();
        _resource = null;
    }
}
 This keeps all the _resource code together. Further thoughts, anyone? More reading: In the Dispose(bool) method implementation, Shouldn't one set members to null? C#: do you need to dispose of objects and set them to null? http://www.codeproject.com/KB/dotnet/idisposable.aspx (Very good, and long!)
@CODE:_resource = null if (disposing) protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)
{
    // If you need thread safety, use a lock around these 
    // operations, as well as in your methods that use the resource.

    {
        if (disposing) {
            if (_resource != null)

        }

int b = str.length;
int c = str.length;
int d = str.length;
int e = str.length;

@TITLE:Call Python from .NET
@CONTENT:I have some code written in Python which can not be transferred to a .NET language. I need to call one of these functions from my .NET WinForms application. Now, I do it by starting the Python script as a separate process and pass parameters to it as command line arguments. It works, but I don't really like this solution. I'd like to improve it to a better one. Is there any better way to call a function of a .py script from a .NET application? What is the best way to do it?

@TITLE:What is the difference between a Local Database in C# and a SQL Server Management Studio created database?
@CONTENT:I'm creating an application with MS Visual C# 2010 Express that requires a database. I've learned that there seem to be two ways to create/use a SQL database with this application. The first seems to be where from within C#, I can create a "local database" by right-clicking on my application in the Solution Explorer and clicking "Add"->"New Item"->"Local Database". Then it's shown in the Database Explorer and I can use it. The other way is where I create a database with SQL Server Management Studio and then from within the C# code, I open a connection to it (SQLConnection... yada yada yada) and use it. I'm having a hard time understanding what technical reasons there are between choosing one way or the other way to do this... Can someone describe the differences and what criteria would be used to choose one way vs. the other? (or point to a website reference...) Thanks! -Adeena Additional Info... Right now, this is really a hobby project as I get a few things worked out. I'm the only developer and working on a single machine The application is intended to be one that runs standalone - not in a browser or over the web in any way. I know that that's not the direction the universe is heading, but as mentioned above, this is a hobby project that I need to complete to work out a few other issues. I don't believe I have any need or intent for multiple applications to work on this database.

Anyways, we have an application that FTPs files from one location to another and obviously the FTP profile needs a password. We have a database with all the details of the profiles, but we need the passwords to be encrypted. We've thought of decrypting them in SQL then sending them to the app, but that would mean sending it over the network, which we don't want. We want to encrypt the stored passwords, pass the details to the application, then decrypt them within the application. Is this possible? From my googling, it doesn't seem it is, but I'm hoping someone has a trick or something. Thanks in advance! Note: I'm using .Net 4 and SQL Server 2008 R2.

@TITLE:calling jQuery supersized plugin onclick
@CONTENT:I am trying to call the supersized plugin (http://buildinternet.com/2009/02/supersized-full-screen-backgroundslideshow-jquery-plugin/) onclick, so far when i click on my diferent menus the images are changed, but it looks like html markup build by supersized dont get rebuild, right now i got this: html wich calls a function brown() onclick: <ul id="rooms_menu" style="display:none;">
<li><a href="javascript:;" onclick="brown()">menu title</a></li>
<p class="rooms_desc">description text</p>
 the html where i echo an ajax response: <div id="script">

<script>$(function(){
        $.supersized({
                      slides    :   [
                     {image     : 'img/rooms-default.jpg'}
                     //{image     : 'img/rooms-default.jpg'}
                                    ]
                     })
                     })</script>

</div>
 brow() is an ajax function:  function brown(){
      $.ajax({
      url: 'ajax.php?action=brown',
      success: function(data){
        $('#script').html(data);
             }
           })

         }
 then the ajax.php file loads its content to #script div: switch($_GET["action"]){
      case "brown":
      echo "<script>$(function(){
         $.supersized({
                   slides :     [
               {image  : 'img/rooms-brown-01.jpg'},
               {image  : 'img/rooms-brown-02.jpg'}
                            ]
                            })

                            })</script>";
      break;
      case "rose":  etc.....
 so the images are updated when i click for the first time on a menu but if i click another menu title the images are updated too but the slideshow starts messing , it looks like the html markup is not rebuild, when i use only one image per menu title(only one image in supersized array) there is no problem. R.
@CODE:<ul id="rooms_menu" style="display:none;">
<li><a href="javascript:;" onclick="brown()">menu title</a></li>
<p class="rooms_desc">description text</p> <div id="script">

<script>$(function(){
        $.supersized({
                      slides    :   [
                     {image     : 'img/rooms-default.jpg'}
                     //{image     : 'img/rooms-default.jpg'}
                                    ]
                     })
                     })</script>

</div> function brown(){
      $.ajax({
      url: 'ajax.php?action=brown',
      success: function(data){
        $('#script').html(data);
             }
           })

         } switch($_GET["action"]){

@TITLE:Is there documentation that lists when/what exceptions are thrown by System.Data.Sqlite objects?
@CONTENT:I'm having trouble finding documentation for the Sqlite.Net data provider (System.Data.Sqlite.dll) (new development has forked here) that lists what exceptions are thrown by the various classes and their methods. I know there are SqliteExceptions that can be thrown, but when? I have ensured I have the accompanying System.Data.Sqlite.xml documentation file, but it doesn't appear to list what exceptions are thrown by each method. I don't want to wrap unnecessary code into try/catch blocks (or blindly catch a generic Exception everywhere). Does anyone know where I may find such documentation? I know that SqliteConnection is derived from DbConnection, and SqliteCommand is derived from DbCommand, so if necessary I guess I can look at the documentation there. However, none of the base classes will list SqliteException, so when will those type of exceptions be thrown? PS - I'm using version 1.0.64 (from 2009... can't upgrade at this time). UPDATE: Due to the lack of responses, is there anyone out there that uses System.Data.Sqlite.dll? If so, what approach do you take to handle exceptions that may be thrown from the objects available in the library? Is there some standard way to deal with these exceptions since it seems there is no documentation on the exceptions that are thrown and by which classes? UPDATE 2: I did manage to find the SQLite.NET documentation found under c:\program files\SQLite.NET\Doc\ (seems kind of obvious). Great documentation so far, however it doesn't tell you what exceptions are thrown. The best I can do so far is to look at the base classes that are inherited or interfaces that are implemented and see what exceptions are thrown. This still doesn't help in knowing when an SqliteException object is thrown though. UPDATE 3: After getting a hold of the source code, it appears that none of the classes themselves contain any /// <exception cref="ExceptionType">Something went wrong!</exception> xml comments. This explains why neither the SQLite.NET help file or Visual Studio Intellisense is listing any exceptions that may be thrown. I've created a ticket requesting the xml comments to include the exceptions, offering to add them myself if it is too low on their priority list. I'll keep this question updated with any new developments for anyone who might be interested.

@TITLE:In UITableViewCell how can I revert the delete confirmation mode back to normal editing mode?
@CONTENT:I have a custom confirmation alert dialog box on top of the regular cell deletion confirmation for some cells, it's sort of doing a double confirmation for these cells. (This is after user enters editing mode, not by swipe) So, if the user clicks 'OK' to confirm in my custom confirmation dialog. It's supposed to do the actual deletion, which behaves well since the whole cell will be removed from the TableView. However, if the user clicks 'Cancel' The cell does not get deleted it remains in the table and remain in "Cancellation Confirmation Mode". This is not what I want, I want it to be reverted back to the 'Normal cell editing mode". I've searched through apple documentation, it only provides a "showingDeleteConfirmation" readonly method. It doesn't really have a way to revert this mode back to cell editing. I can do this to hack it:         [cell setEditing:NO animated:NO];
        [cell setEditing:YES animated:NO];
 I can't enable animation here because it will look bad it's temping to go back to non-editing mode to editing mode again. But the animation transition is not quite smooth without it. IS THERE ANY CLEANER WAY TO DO THIS?

  member o.fn2 (?bo) = o.fn1 bo

  member o.fn3 (?bo) = 1 + bo.Value
  member o.fn4 (?bo) = o.fn3 bo
 While fn1 and fn2 work just fine, fn4 produces the following error: init.fsx(6,30): error FS0001: This expression was expected to have type int but here has type 'a option MSDN states: Optional parameters are interpreted as the F# option type, so you can query them in the regular way that option types are queried, by using a match expression with Some and None. To me, optional parameters are not interpreted as the F# option type otherwise the code would compile. Moreover I do not understand why, when I hover over ?bo in fn3 the tooltip says val bo: int option but from outside expects only int. I would expect a behavior of accepting nothing, int, Some int and None. And as the last note, I do not understand why fn2 works but fn4 does not. Thanks for clarification

@TITLE:Setting a windows region without disabling theming
@CONTENT:Does anyone know how to assign a window region (SetWindowRgn or Control.Region in WinForms) without killing the theming in the non-client area? For example, running the following generates a Windows 2000-style unthemed title bar, border, etc: var form = new Form { Width=500, Height=500, BackColor = Color.Azure };
form.Text = "But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?";
var region = new Region (new Rectangle (Point.Empty, form.Size));
region.Exclude (new Rectangle (100, 100, 300, 300));
form.Region = region;
form.ShowDialog();
 I'm guessing it's to do with this MSDN article which says: As long as a window has a non-NULL region applied to it (SetWindowRgn), the UxTheme Manager assumes that this is a specialized window and the window will not use visual styles. ...hence UxThemes assumes it's a specialized window. Is there a way to tell the UxTheme Manager explicitly to theme a window?
@CODE:SetWindowRgn Control.Region var form = new Form { Width=500, Height=500, BackColor = Color.Azure };
form.Text = "But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?";

@LINK:/questions/6305132/django-1-3-logging-500-errors-are-not-logged
@TITLE:Django 1.3 logging: 500 errors are not logged
@CONTENT:I'm struggling to make the 'django.request' logger work as advertised - 500 errors don't seem to propagate to handlers attached to it. In the default logging configuration for every new project, the comment says the "logging performed by this configuration is to send an email to the site admins on every HTTP 500 error". Obviously the email is only sent if you've setup ADMINS correctly, but I'm not even seeing the handler get called when a view raises an exception. I built a testcase starting with an empty project, and adding my own handler to the 'django.request' logger: LOGGING = {
    'version': 1,
    'disable_existing_loggers': False,
    'handlers': {
        'mail_admins': {
            'level': 'ERROR',
            'class': 'django.utils.log.AdminEmailHandler'
        },
        'my_error_handler' : {
            'level': 'ERROR',
            'class': 'log.MyErrorHandler'
        }
    },
    'loggers': {
        'django.request': {
            'handlers': ['mail_admins', 'my_error_handler'],
            'level': 'ERROR',
            'propagate': True,
        },
    }
}
 The handler itself: import logging
class MyErrorHandler(logging.Handler):     
    def emit(self, record):
        print "handling error: %s" % record 
 If I call .error() on the logger myself, everything works as it should. But when a 500 is generated by a view, neither of the handlers are called. My views.py: import logging

def home(request):

    #this error will be processed by MyErrorHandler
    logging.getLogger('django.request').error("Custom error message")

    #this won't
    raise Exception('500 error message')

    return HttpResponse("Home")
 Everything else is the project is default; DEBUG is True, the middleware config is unchanged. Is there some hidden config option I need to enable to have this work as it says in the docs? Thanks, Matt.

@TITLE:How to avoid having messy AS3 code
@CONTENT:I've been programming with ActionScript 3 for a little while and I've noticed that the natural progression of my code seems to take the form of one giant document class with dozens of member variables, callbacks, and handles to objects on the stage. In short: it's kind of a mess! Thing is, I don't really see a way around it (not yet at least). I use different keyframes on the timeline to represent different states in an app, and while I have some code right on the timeline (for quick things like a mouse click on a movie clip), most of the logic just ends up dumped in the main document class. So, I'm wondering... What are some good ways to help neaten up this code-gone-wild? Or is this normal? I come from a C++ background, and I like writing object-oriented stuff, but I can't see a way to carry over that kind of structure to Flash. Any insight would be really appreciated. Thanks

@TITLE:Good Reason to use java.util.Date in an API
@CONTENT:Are there any specific reasons to use a Date class in an API (for example, in an employee birth date field) rather that a long or Long. There is some discussion of this in: java-date-vs-calendar, but I would like to know specifically if there is any justification for using Dates, when a long (or Long) seems so much simpler. Of course I would use TimeZone and SimpleDateFormatter to parse and display dates in a GUI, and maybe Calendar to perform manipulations, but I am concerned only about the storage and representation of date in the data model/API in this question. Update: An example of one reason why I would not choose Date is that it is mutable. So if I expose a Date in my API, callers can call setTime(long) and this seems to be a violation of basic encapsulation. To me this seems to outweigh the benefit of the added clarity that using a Date provides, since I could just call the long property timeInMillisecondsSinceEpoch and communicate the same information to callers.

 I can change the HTML markup (like marking the "breaking" row with a custom class), but I have to be able decide if the table would be split or not via CSS. I know that I could use 2 tables and use display:inline-table, but I must use just one table because of I need consistent column width (the table must have auto layout).

@TITLE:JDBC insert or update practice
@CONTENT:I need to insert a record to table if the record doesn't exist, and to update a record if the record exists in the table. Of course, I can write: p-code: SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE id='abc' by JDBC
if(exists)
   UPDATE table1 SET ... WHERE id='abc' by JDBC;
else
   INSERT INTO table1... by JDBC;
 However, I don't think the code is elegant. Alternatively, I can also write it in this way: p-code: int row = Statement.executeUpdate("INSERT INTO table1...", 2);
if(row==0)
  update table1 SET ... WHERE id='abc' by JDBC;
 Do you think the latter way is better and faster? Thanks! EDIT: in MYSQL

@CONTENT:More than once the question has been asked on SO. But the only answers that are given read "you should not need to order your unit tests, it is bad because" or "you can avoid that if..." I already know it is bad, why it is bad, and techniques to avoid it. But that is not what I want to know. I'd like to know if it is possible to order the execution of NUnit tests, other than an alphabetical order. To be blunt: I actually want state to propogate from one test to the next. Trust me that I have a clever reason for this, that defies the usual philosophy. MSTest has the "ordered test" capability, which is very useful in certain cases. I'd like to have that ability in NUnit. Can it be done?

@TITLE:Do static libraries, which depend on other slibs need the actual 'code' from them to work?
@CONTENT:Sorry about the vague question title, I just want to ascertain some things. Static libraries don't link with other static libraries, right? So when I write a slib: A, that uses functionality of another: B, all I have to provide are the headers of B to A, and only those, even if A actually uses functionality from B? Yes? As long as exe: X, which uses A,has B.lib specified as linker input? So that at link time, the linker takes A.lib, which basically only knows that a function of B was called somewhere inside its code, and somehow fills that information from B.lib, making A.lib 'whole', before X gets linked with the now working parts of it? The motivation behind these questions is to get rid of some linker warnings 4006 and discarded double definitions, and I think that should do the trick, if this is actually a valid way of doing it.

@LINK:/questions/6163457/design-pattern-for-checking-collision-between-shapes
@TITLE:Design pattern for checking collision between shapes
@CONTENT:I use various shapes for collision detection ( Rectangle, Circle, Cone, Ring etc.) All those shapes are derived from base abstract Shape class. My game objects have property of type Shape. class GameObject
{
    (...)
    public Shape CollisionShape { get; set; }
}
 and during initialize process I decide what shape will be used for each object, like: GameObject person = new GameObject();
person.CollisionShape = new Circle(100); // 100 is radius
 Now when I want to check if two objects intersects I use following class: public class IntersectionChecker
{
   public bool Intersect(Shape a, Shape b)
   {
      Type aType = a.GetType();
      Type bType = b.GetType();

      if( aType == typeof(Rectangle) && bType == typeof(Rectangle))
          return Intersect(a as Rectangle, b as Rectangle);

      if( aType == typeof(Rectangle) && bType == typeof(Circle))
          return Intersect(a as Rectangle, b as Circle);

      // etc. etc. All combinations      
   }

   private bool Intersect(Rectangle a, Rectangle b)
   {
      // check intersection between rectangles
   }
}
 so my code looks like: IntersectionChecker ic = new IntersectionCHecker();
bool isIntersection = 
    is.Intersect(personA.CollisionShape, personB.CollisionShape);
 Is there better way to achieve my goal, without dozens of 'if' checks and type checks in IntersectionChecker class? EDIT: Please take in mind, that method that check intersection between shape A and B can be used to check intersection between B and A aswell. In many answers ( thanks for all yours thoughts!) intersection check is proposed to be invoked from shape itself rather than IntersectionChecker object. I think it will force me to duplicate code. Now i can do as follow:   if( aType == typeof(Rectangle) && bType == typeof(Circle))
      return Intersect(a as Rectangle, b as Rectangle);

  if( aType == typeof(Circle) && bType == typeof(Rectangle))
      return Intersect(b as Rectangle, a as Circle); // same method as above
@CODE:Rectangle Circle Cone Ring Shape class GameObject
{
    (...)
    public Shape CollisionShape { get; set; }
} GameObject person = new GameObject();
person.CollisionShape = new Circle(100); // 100 is radius public class IntersectionChecker
{
   public bool Intersect(Shape a, Shape b)
   {
      Type aType = a.GetType();
      Type bType = b.GetType();

      if( aType == typeof(Rectangle) && bType == typeof(Rectangle))
          return Intersect(a as Rectangle, b as Rectangle);

      if( aType == typeof(Rectangle) && bType == typeof(Circle))
          return Intersect(a as Rectangle, b as Circle);

      // etc. etc. All combinations      
   }

   private bool Intersect(Rectangle a, Rectangle b)
   {
      // check intersection between rectangles
   }
} IntersectionChecker ic = new IntersectionCHecker();
bool isIntersection = 
    is.Intersect(personA.CollisionShape, personB.CollisionShape); if( aType == typeof(Rectangle) && bType == typeof(Circle))
      return Intersect(a as Rectangle, b as Rectangle);

  if( aType == typeof(Circle) && bType == typeof(Rectangle))

@TITLE:Python: How to tell the for loop to continue from a function?
@CONTENT:Sometimes I need the following pattern within a for loop. At times more than once in the same loop:     try:
        var = 'attempt to do something that may fail on a number of levels'
    except Exception, e:
        log(e)
        continue
 Now I don't see a nice way to wrap this in a function as it can not return continue: def attempt(this):
    try:
        return this
    except Exception, e:
        log(e)
        # 1. continue # <-- syntax error: continue not properly in loop or
        # 2. return continue # <-- invalid syntax
        # 3.
        return False # <-- this sort of works, but makes me feel powerless
 If I return False than I could:     var = attempt('to do something that may fail on a number of levels')
    if not var:
        continue
 But I don't feel that does it the justice. I want to tell the for loop to continue (or fake it) from within attempt function.
@CODE:for try:
        var = 'attempt to do something that may fail on a number of levels'
    except Exception, e:
        log(e)
        continue return continue def attempt(this):
    try:
        return this
    except Exception, e:
        log(e)
        # 1. continue # <-- syntax error: continue not properly in loop or
        # 2. return continue # <-- invalid syntax
        # 3.
        return False # <-- this sort of works, but makes me feel powerless return False var = attempt('to do something that may fail on a number of levels')

@TITLE:Efficient way to get index of minimum value in long vector, python
@CONTENT:I have a long list of longitude values (len(Lon) = 420481), and another one of latitude values. I want to find the corresponding latitude to the minimum of the longitude. I tried: SE_Lat = [Lat[x] for x,y in enumerate(Lon) if y == min(Lon)]
 but this takes ages to finish. Does anyone know a more efficient way? Maybe you also have a suggestions for this: I now try to find the closest corresponding latitude to a new longitude, which is not in the original longitude vector. I tried this: minDiff = [min(abs(x - lon_new) for x in lons)] # not very quick, but works
[(lat,lon) for lat,lon in izip(lats,lons) if abs(lon-lon_new)==minDiff]
 The last line throws an error, because there are multiple matches. I don't know at the moment how to find only one value, lets say the first. Any help is greatly appreciated!
@CODE:SE_Lat = [Lat[x] for x,y in enumerate(Lon) if y == min(Lon)] minDiff = [min(abs(x - lon_new) for x in lons)] # not very quick, but works

@CONTENT:I have a column vector A which is 10 elements long. I have a matrix B which is 10 by 10. The memory storage for B is column major. I would like to overwrite the first row in B with the column vector A. Clearly, I can do: for ( int i=0; i < 10; i++ )
{
    B[0 + 10 * i] = A[i];
}
 where I've left the zero in 0 + 10 * i to highlight that B uses column-major storage (zero is the row-index). After some shenanigans in CUDA-land tonight, I had a thought that there might be a CPU function to perform a strided memcpy?? I guess at a low-level, performance would depend on the existence of a strided load/store instruction, which I don't recall there being in x86 assembly?

@CONTENT:I'm trying to create a test using LearnBoost's socket.io and the node-websocket-client. Communication between the client and server work great. After all communication is done, I close both the client and the server. Yet the program hangs, waiting on some unknown callback. Two questions: What is the following program waiting for? Is there a tool for diagnosing outstanding callbacks in node programs? var connect = require('connect'),
    io = require('socket.io'),
    WebSocket = require('websocket-client').WebSocket;

var port = 7111;

var server = connect.createServer();

var socket = io.listen(server); 
socket.on('connection', function(client) {

  client.on('message', function(message) {
    console.log(message);
  });

  client.on('disconnect', function() {
    console.log('closing');
    server.close();
  });
});

server.listen(port, function() {
  var ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:' + port + '/socket.io/websocket');
  ws.onmessage = function(message) {
    console.log(message.data);
  };

  setTimeout(function() {
    ws.send('~m~3~m~Yo!');
    ws.close();
  }, 10);

 How is it that the statement ($buffer = fgets($handle, 4096)) can have a value? Is it a kind of assignment+evaluation of $buffer? I mean, how does it get its value? Is there a name for this? I notice its using strict comparison, so do all assignments evaluate to a boolean true or false? If I wanted to write a function that could be treated this way, do I have to do anything special, other than return false on certain conditions?

@TITLE:Haskell X get TypeRep from concrete type instance
@CONTENT:I want to write a function with this type signature: getTypeRep :: Typeable a => t a -> TypeRep
 where the TypeRep will be the type representation for a, not for t a. That is, the compiler should automatically return the correct type representation at any call sites [to getTypeRep], which will have concrete types for a. To add some context, I want to create a "Dynamic type" data type, with the twist that it will remember the top-level type, but not its parameter. For example, I want to turn MyClass a into Dynamic MyClass, and the above function will be used to create instances of Dynamic MyClass that store a representation of the type parameter a.

@TITLE:How to redirect printf output back into code?
@CONTENT:i'm writing a little c++ app to wrap around the opencv haar training function (namely cvCreateTreeCascadeClassifier). The function throws a whole load of output to the console and I wish to parse this output so that I can populate various variables in my code. The function I wish to use is not part of the actual openCV library; instead it has to be built with my code as part of the project. All of the output from the the function is via printf. Question: Is it possible to intercept the printf statements before they end up on the console? I've managed to redirect them using freopen but this seems a little clumsy as I then need to parse the file and then delete it when the function call is finished. Also, the function is likely to be running for several hours (and possibly even weeks!) so the size of the file might be an issue if its constantly being appended too. Requirements: I need this app to be c++ and to run on both windows and linux (but have no problem with conditional compile statements if need be). I would also like to be able to still see my cout and cerr messages on the console (just not the printf). My googling has removed my will to live! Can anyone help with a solution via either code example or pointers to places I should be looking for an answer? Thanks

@TITLE:HttpContext.Current.Session is null
@CONTENT:I have a WebSite with a custom Cache object inside a class library. All of the projects are running .NET 3.5. I would like to convert this class to use Session state instead of cache, in order to preserve state in a stateserver when my application recycles. However this code throws an exception with "HttpContext.Current.Session is null" when I visit the methods from my Global.asax file. I call the class like this: Customer customer = CustomerCache.Instance.GetCustomer(authTicket.UserData);
 Why is the object allways null? public class CustomerCache: System.Web.SessionState.IRequiresSessionState
{
    private static CustomerCache m_instance;

    private static Cache m_cache = HttpContext.Current.Cache;

    private CustomerCache()
    {
    }

    public static CustomerCache Instance
    {
        get
        {
            if ( m_instance == null )
                m_instance = new CustomerCache();

            return m_instance;
        }
    }

    public void AddCustomer( string key, Customer customer )
    {
        HttpContext.Current.Session[key] = customer;

        m_cache.Insert( key, customer, null, Cache.NoAbsoluteExpiration, new TimeSpan( 0, 20, 0 ), CacheItemPriority.NotRemovable, null );

 As you can see I've tried to add IRequiresSessionState to the class but that doesn't make a difference. Cheers Jens

@TITLE:How to accurately detect if a SQL Server job is running and deal with the job already running?
@CONTENT:I'm currently using code like this to detect if a SQL server job is running. (this is SQL Server 2005, all SP's) return (select isnull(  
(select top 1 CASE 
    WHEN current_execution_status = 4 THEN 0
    ELSE 1
    END
from openquery(devtestvm, 'EXEC msdb.dbo.sp_help_job')
where current_execution_status = 4 and
    name = 'WQCheckQueueJob' + cast(@Index as varchar(10))
), 1)
)
 No problems there, and generally speaking, it works just fine. But.... (always a but) On occasion, I'll invoke this, get back a "job is not running" result, at which point I'll try and start the job, via exec msdb.dbo.sp_start_job @JobName
 and SQL will return that "SQLAgent has refused to start the job because it already has a pending request". Ok. Also not a problem. It's conceivable that there's a slight window where the target job could get started before this code can start it, but after checking if it's started. However, I can just wrap that up in a try catch and just ignore the error, right? begin try
if dbo.WQIsQueueJobActive(@index) = 0 begin
    exec msdb.dbo.sp_start_job @JobName
    break
end         
end try begin catch
    -- nothing here
end catch
 here's the problem, though. 9 times out of 10, this works just fine. SQL agent will raise the error, it's caught, and processing just continues on, since the job is already running, no harm no foul. But occasionally, I'll get a message in the Job History view (keep in mind the above code to detect if a specific job is running and start it if not is actually running from another job) saying that the job failed because "SQLAgent has refused to start the job because it already has a pending request". Of course, this is the exact error that TRY CATCH is supposed to be handling! When this happens, the executing job just dies, but not immediately from what I can tell, just pretty close. I've put logging all over the place and there's no consistency. One time it fails, it'll be at place a, the next time at place b. In some cases, Place A and place B have nothing but a select @var = 'message'
 in between them. Very strange. Basically, the job appears to be unceremoniously dumped and anything left to execute in the job is +not+ executed at all. However, if I remove the "exec StartJob" (or have it invoked exactly one time, when I KNOW that the target job can't already be running), everything works perfectly and all my processing in the job runs through. The purpose behind all this is to have a job started as a result of a trigger (among other things), and, if the job is already started, there's really no need to "start it again". Anyone ever run into behavior like this with SQL Agent's Job handling? EDIT: Current flow of control is like so: Change to a table (update or insert)... fires trigger which calls... a stored proc which calls... sp_Start_Job which... starts a specific job which... calls another stored proc (called CheckQueue) which... performs some processing and... checks several tables and depending on their contents might... invoke sp_start_job on another job to start up a second, simultaneous job to process the additional work (this second job calls the CheckQueue sproc also but the two invocations operate on completely separate sets of data)

When I remove the Platform attribute from the above element, and run the build, I get an ICE80 error: Product.wxs(285) : error LGHT0204 : ICE80: This package contains 64 bit component 'C.Textfiles' but the Template Summary Property does not contain Intel64 or x64. It builds successfully if I use the Platform attribute, but because of the documentation, I am unsure if this is correct. What is the proper way to build an x64 MSI??

@CONTENT:I know, that these are some common/basic libraries, but what do they mean exactly? For example, I know, that -lm is some math library, but is this the standard math library or what? -lz for compression? What compression? And I don't have any idea what is this one - -lrt. I know, that these are different things, but I don't think, that asking different questions for each of these libraries is good idea (: Thanks! EDIT: Can someone specify these things: math library - the seme we use, when we include < cmath > or < math.h > ? compress library - what does this mean - provides some tools, that we can use to compress files, or helps the compiler/linker to do some compress-things?

@TITLE:Reading in only part of a Stata .DTA file in R
@CONTENT:I apologize in advance if this has a simple answer somewhere. It seems like the kind of thing that would, but I can't seem to locate it in the help files, by searching SO, or by Googling. I'm working with some datasets that are several GB right now. It's enough to fit in memory on one of the cluster nodes I have access to, but takes quite a bit of time to load. For many debugging/programming activities with this data, I don't need the entire file loaded, just the first few thousand observations to have a dataset on which to test code. I can of course just read the whole file in and subset, but I was wondering if there's a way to tell read.dta() to only read in the first N rows? This would of course be much faster. I could also use a proper format like .csv and then use read.csv()'s nrows argument, but then I'd lose the factor labels in the Stata dataset (and have to recreate quite a few GB of data from someone else's code that's feeding in to this project. So a direct solution on .dta files is preferred.

@TITLE:How to add something to right sidebar in Magento
@CONTENT:I'm new to Magento. I've read a dozen of questions here and posts on Magento forums but none of them seem to explain how to solve my problem. I have a two column layout for my category pages. In right column I have "Recently viewed items", "My basket" and "Compare products". All I need to do is add a static block to the right column. As far as I know I have to edit some xml file but where is that file? I can't seem to even find how those three existing block were added. My guess is if I could find those I'd figure out how to add one more. Please help, I'm completely lost now. Thanks. Edit I'm obviously missing something fundamental here. Let me put it in other words. I have a category "AAA" In this category I have added using Admin panel: a description, image and assigned few products. Then I open this category in web browser I see all my data in main area and those three blocks (mentioned above) in right sidebar. How does Magento know to show those particular three blocks and not some others? Where does it say to show those three blocks?

@LINK:/questions/5420134/data-encapsulation-in-perl
@TITLE:Data Encapsulation in Perl?
@CONTENT:Hello Perl community on SO. I am using Perl since a few years, but since I am following SO, I recognized that I know Perl not enough. I wrote I quite big script over the past 4 years and tried to do this in OO style. I know that Perl<6 is not really OO. So one point I don't like is that I have no data encapsulation, that means no Variables that are really private to a package ("class") (or maybe I don't know how to do it). I have something like this (only a small part of my script) package TAG;

sub new () {
    my $classname = shift;
    my $self      = {};

    bless( $self, $classname );
    $self->initialize();
    return $self;
}

sub initialize() {
    my $self = shift;

    # Only an example, I have a long list of items in this "class"
    $self->{ID}          = "NA"; 
}

sub setID() {
    ...
}

sub getID() {
    ...
}
 In my main script I am using it then this way: my $CurrentItem;
$CurrentItem = new TAG();

$CurrentItem->getID()
 but $CurrentItem->{ID} = "Something";
 is also working, but I would prefer, that this is not possible. Is there a way to get a better encapsulation of the data I am using in the "class", so that I am (or other users are) forced to use the get and set methods?
@CODE:package TAG;

sub new () {
    my $classname = shift;
    my $self      = {};

    bless( $self, $classname );
    $self->initialize();
    return $self;
}

sub initialize() {
    my $self = shift;

    # Only an example, I have a long list of items in this "class"
    $self->{ID}          = "NA"; 
}

sub setID() {
    ...
}

sub getID() {
    ...
} my $CurrentItem;
$CurrentItem = new TAG();

$CurrentItem->getID() $CurrentItem->{ID} = "Something";

 As far as I am aware, readonly is essentially a constant for my purposes. If I attempt to define these as constants, the compiler indicates that it must be a compile-time constant, which Color is not. Am I good leaving these as-is, or is there some way to define these constants that I should be aware of? (The purpose is simply to have a single location in which to change all of the colors for logging purposes.)

@LINK:/questions/5258860/php-crypt-returning-wrong-answer
@TITLE:PHP crypt() returning wrong answer
@CONTENT:I think i'm losing my marbles here... I've got a problem on my web site where randomly it stops accepting logins. I've now been able to trace it to crypt() behaving very strangely. In my database, i've got the crypted version of the users password - so let's say Og12345678. When the user logs in, they enter their password, I read the salt out of the db and then crypt what they entered and compare - usually this works very well. So i'm doing crypt($enteredPassword, $saltFromDb) - in this case, the salt would be Og of course. Normally for a given users password crypt works fine. When things go wrong (and when they do it's a permanent change until I restart Apache) I found that crypt starts returning a DIFFERENT answer for the same input with the same salt. It's consistent however, i.e. once the system has gone wrong crypt returns the wrong answer but it's always returning the same wrong answer. Repeated refreshes of the page show the same output. The same salt is also in evidence in the newly incorrect crypt result also, so it's not that the salt has gone missing somewhere. If I then restart Apache and re-run the script without any changes at all, the results from crypt are then back to how they should be. I appreciate it's not the latest PHP (5.2.8) but would value any views on this including whether it's a known bug fixed in a later version (upgrading PHP is not a happy task with lots of sites some of which still use unfortunate quirks that all need to be re-tested with each upgrade) - if it is a known fixed bug then obviously i'll get it all upgraded ASAP, beyond that it'll probably be easier to outsource the crypt externally since I only use it in one common place for my site. Any input appreciated. Matt Peddlesden --- Update: 11 Mar 2011 Correction to comment previously given about operating system... - Operating system is Windows Server 2008 SP1 64 bit. Apologies I should have double checked rather than assuming I could remember! Machine is a Dell 2950 8gb Ram, Xeon processors. I am starting to think along the lines Krtek is suggesting - when the system has gone wonky, if I generate new crypt() (i.e a very simple example where i set a variable to a string, crypt it and then compare with the crypt) - all works great. When I restart the server, again it's all back to the previous calculations again. So I am definitely leaning towards something that is changing the algorithm used to calculate the crypt() result... any thoughts on what might cause this to happen? I printed out the values of the CRYPT_STD_DES etc and they don't change between restarts. Anyone got any clues on what might cause this to happen? Whatever it was seemed to happen twice in one day yesterday, most odd. Thanks for the answers thus far. --- Update: 16 Mar 2011 Just wanted to provide another update. This is still happening, still no further understanding of why. In case anyone comes across this in the future, I think my solution going forwards is going to be to do some nasty hack to push all the crypt() executions out to an external C# application and stop having to rely on PHP to do them. Something is going wrong somewhere and at this point the only solution I can see is to remove it from the equation entirely. Of course if it still happens, that will be interesting to know too! :) Thanks all.

@TITLE:Other errors find my Error.cshtml, why doesn't 404 error find Error.cshtml?
@CONTENT:I am tackling ASP.NET, MVC 3, web development, for the first time, all at the same time. Please bear with me, as I know this subject has been discussed heavily from different angles. I still have not found the answer to my specific question: Why doesn't my application find my Error.cshtml file when a 404 occurs, when it finds it just fine with other errors? (Environment: Win 7 64bit, IIS7, SQL 2008 Express, VS2010, ASP.NET 4, MVC3, EF v4) I have a controller, WorkerController.cs, that correctly reads and writes from the database. If I change the database name without updating my DbContext, it gives me an error. When I change web.config to always show custom errors, shows me the /Views/Shared/Error.cshtml file. I do not have a FooController.cs file. If I go to /Foo, I get a 404 error, as expected. It tells me it cannot find the resource /Foo. When I set customErrors mode="On" and make an http request to /Foo, I get a 404 error saying that /Error.cshtml cannot be found. I am searching for and reading the posts that discuss the various methods of handling errors with designated controllers, but I really want to know what I'm missing. Why does it find /Error.cshtml for other errors, but not the 404 error?

@CONTENT:Have a look at this Scala class: class Example {

 Compiling this results in a warning: Example.scala:2: warning: non variable type-argument Int in type pattern

    val (x, y): (Int, Int) = (1, 2)

 Removing the explicit type annotation gets rid of this warning: class Example {
  val (x, y) = (1, 2)
}
 Why do I get the warning and why does removing the explicit type annotation get rid of it? As far as I can see nothing really changes, x and y are still of type Int without the type annotation.

@CONTENT:I am developing a website, in which client uploads some document files like doc, docx, htm, html, txt, pdf etc. I want to retrieve last modified date of an uploaded file. I have created one handler(.ashx) which does the job of saving the files. Following is the code:

string fileName = file.FileName;                               
file.SaveAs(Path.Combine(uploadPath, filename));

@TITLE:Improving Performance of Django ForeignKey Fields in Admin
@CONTENT:By default, Django's admin renders ForeignKey fields in admin as a select field, listing every record in the foreign table as an option. In one admin-accessible model, I'm referencing the User model as a ForeignKey, and since I have thousands of users Django is populating the select with thousands of options. This is causing the admin page to load incredibly slowly, and the select is not very useful since it can take a while to scroll through thousands of options to find the one you want. What's the best way to change the rendering of this field in order to improve page load and usability? I'd like the select field to be replaced with some sort of button to launch a search form popup, or a text field that searches keywords via Ajax to find the Id for the specific User they want to associate. Does admin have anything like this builtin, or would I have to write this from scratch?

@TITLE:AffineTransform without transforming Stroke?
@CONTENT:When using the Graphics2D scale() function with two different parameters (scaling by different ratios in x- and y-direction), everything drawn later on this Graphics2D object is scaled too. This has the strange effect that lines drawn in one direction are thicker than those in another direction. The following program produces this effect, it shows this window: public class StrokeExample extends JPanel {


    public void paintComponent(Graphics context) {
        super.paintComponent(context);
        Graphics2D g = (Graphics2D)context.create();
        g.setStroke(new BasicStroke(0.2f));

        int height = getHeight();
        int width = getWidth();

        g.scale(width/7.0, height/4.0);

        g.setColor(Color.BLACK);
        g.draw(new Rectangle( 2, 1, 4, 2));
    }

    public static void main(String[] params) {
        EventQueue.invokeLater(new Runnable(){public void run() {

            StrokeExample example = new StrokeExample();

            JFrame f = new JFrame("StrokeExample");
            f.setSize(100, 300);
            f.getContentPane().setLayout(new BorderLayout());
            f.getContentPane().add(example);
            f.setDefaultCloseOperation(WindowConstants.DISPOSE_ON_CLOSE);
            f.setVisible(true);
        }});

    }

}
 I'm using this coordinate transform to avoid having to manually transform my application model coordinates (the (2,1, 2,4) in this example) to screen (or component) pixel coordinates, but I don't want this stroke distortion. In other words, I want to have all lines the same width, independent of current x- and y-scale-factors. I know what produces this effect (the Stroke object creates a stroked shape of the rectangle to be painted in user coordinates, which then are translated to screen coordinates), but I'm not sure on how to solve this. Should I create a new Stroke implementation which strokes Shapes differently in X- and Y-direction (thereby undoing the distortion here)? (Or does anyone already knows such an implementation?) Should I transform my shapes to screen coordinates and stroke there? Any other (better) ideas?
@CODE:scale() public class StrokeExample extends JPanel {


    public void paintComponent(Graphics context) {
        super.paintComponent(context);
        Graphics2D g = (Graphics2D)context.create();

class Goo a b
 Now, suppose I have a parameterized data type data Bar a b
 which I want to make an instance of Foo when one of its parameters is part of an instance of Goo. I'm not sure the previous sentence uses exact terminology, so here's what I want to write: instance (Goo c d) => Foo d (Bar a d)
 I'm not allowed to without the UndecidableInstances extension. Am I correct in thinking this is because the instance doesn't refer to the c type? Should I... Just enable the extension? Can somebody elaborate on what kinds of trouble it can get me into? Add another parameter to Foo, so that the last instance declaration becomes something like Foo c d (Bar a d)? A problem with this is that I might have other instances of Foo that never make any reference to any such "fourth type parameter" (i.e. there are instances of the form instance Foo A B in unrelated parts of my code), so these would break. I'd rather fix my instance, not my class. Create a new class FooGoo with enough parameters? I would feel like I'm repeating myself in that case, but at least I wouldn't break unrelated classes. Does anyone have any words of wisdom?

No, the "new Object()" isn't jitted away (try if you don't trust me). The main thread show the speed of each thread. Pressing CTRL-C, the program spawns 50 "sleeping" threads. The slow down begins with just 50 threads. With around 250 it's very visible on the Task Manager that the CPU isn't 100% used (on mine it's 82%). I have tried three methods of locking the "sleeping" thread: Thread.CurrentThread.Suspend() (bad, bad, I know :-) ), a lock on an already locked object and a Thread.Sleep(Timeout.Infinite). It's the same. If I comment the row with the new Object(), and I replace it with a Math.Sqrt (or with nothing) the problem isn't present. The speed doesn't change with the number of threads. Can someone else check it? Does anyone knows where is the bottle neck? Ah... you should test it in Release Mode WITHOUT launching it from the Visual Studio. I'm using XP sp3 on a dual processor (no HT). I have tested it with the .NET 3.5 and 4.0 (to test the different framework runtimes) namespace TestSpeed

@TITLE:Does git's -X theirs not handle new/deleted file conflicts?
@CONTENT:Following on the scenario from this question, I'm performing a git rebase -s recursive -X theirs etc... and am surprised to be stopped with the following types of conflicts: added by them deleted by them deleted by us Is there some reason the strategy doesn't cope with these? (I don't know if this is significant, but git doesn't report conflicts in the output, it just says When you have resolved this problem run "git rebase --continue") UPDATE Here's a script that doesn't quite reproduce, but nearly: git init
git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/Branch1  #just to get the 'right' branch name
echo Added in A > DeletedByThem.txt
git add -A
git commit -m A

echo Modified in B >> DeletedByThem.txt
git add -A
git commit -m B

echo Modified in C >> DeletedByThem.txt
echo Added in C > DeletedByUs.txt
git add -A
git commit -m C

git checkout -b Branch2
echo Modified in D >> DeletedByUs.txt
git rm DeletedByThem.txt
git add -A
git commit -m D

echo Modified in E >> DeletedByUs.txt
git add -A
git commit -m E
 At this point, you should have this: Branch1:    A - B - C
                     \
Branch2:              D - E
 What we want is this: Branch1:    A - B - C
                 \
Branch2:          D - E
 So: git rebase -s recursive -X theirs --onto [SHA of B] Branch1 Branch2
 This reproduces the 'deleted by them' and 'deleted by us' problems, but doesn't reproduce the 'added by them', nor the absence of any conflict report. From what I can gather, in this context 'deleted by them' thus means "modified after B, then deleted" (so we do want to delete it in Branch2), and "deleted by us" means "created after B" (so we want to keep it in Branch2) From what I can tell from the history of my real (and enormous) repo, the 'added by them' is related to incorrectly detected renames (i.e. identical files in completely different folders being identified as renames).

Basically I have a reset.css on the website and then my main.css is called afterwards. In the reset.css it declares the below statement under pretty much every html tag under the sun: font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
 In the main.css the same statement is declared under html, body and p, and even some specific p tags such as p.headerText and p.newsDate This is a pretty standard setup. On Safari, IE and Firefox, the font renders as Arial / Helvetica, on Chrome it renders as Times New Roman. It's really frustrating. Can anybody help? UPDATE The Computed Style on Chrome is showing the correct rule, and I even tested this on a friend of mines machine and it was the same. Both running Chrome 8.0.552.237 on OSX 10.6.6 Cheers

@TITLE:How to lazy load a many-to-many collection in hibernate?
@CONTENT:I can lazy load one-to-many and many-to-one associations but I can't with the many-to-many associations. We have a city in wich we have merchants wich have adresses. Merchants can have multiple addresses and multiple merchants can have the same addresses. When we load a merchant with a get, Merchant merchant = (Merchant) hib_session.get(Merchant.class, id);
System.out.println(merchant.getName());
 it's ok, addresses aren't load until we iterate over them. But when we load a list of merchants, City city = (City) hib_session.get(City.class, city_name);
for(Merchant merchant : city.getMerchants()) {
  System.out.println(merchant.getName());
}
 even if we don't get the addresses, hibernate automatically loads them. Here's an example of my problem. The mapping : <class name="Merchant" table="Merchants" lazy="true">
  <id name="id"
    type="long"
    column="id">
    <generator class="native"></generator>
  </id>
  <set name="addresses" table="AdressesMerchant" lazy="true">
    <key column="merchant_id"></key>
    <many-to-many class="Adresses" column="address_id"/>
  </set>
</class>

<class name="Address" table="Adresses" lazy="true">
  <id name="id"
    type="long"
    column="id">
    <generator class="native"></generator>
  </id>
  <set name="merchants" table="AdressesMerchant" lazy="true">
    <key column="adress_id"/>
    <many-to-many column="merchant_id" class="Merchant"/>
  </set>
</class>
 Any ideas ?
@CODE:Merchant merchant = (Merchant) hib_session.get(Merchant.class, id);

@TITLE:How secure is ProtectedData.Protect (DPAPI)?
@CONTENT:Suppose someone gets access all of my hard disk, I guess the weak spot would be my windows password. Without knowing/being able to retrieve that, the data should be pretty much safe, shouldn't it? I'm asking specifically because of the EFS entry in wikipedia which states that In Windows 2000, the local administrator is the default Data Recovery Agent, capable of decrypting all files encrypted with EFS by any local user. and EFS happens to use DPAPI. So does the same apply to my own data protected using this: ProtectedData.Protect(plain, null, DataProtectionScope.CurrentUser);
 And if that is indeed the case, how could I prevent it? [Edit] N.B. I'm trying to store credentials for a winforms app so that the user does not have to enter their password every time they login. In other words, if someone is able to login as that user (i.e. know the user password), then they might as well be able read the encrypted data. Which - not coming from a windows background - now makes me wonder - can't the local admin login as any local user anyway? In that case I shouldn't be concerned about the admin being able to retrieve passwords anyway... [Edit2] As google reveals, it looks like an Administrator cannot just login as any user without resetting/changing their password first. So my question still seems relevant...

@LINK:/questions/4727023/why-cant-get-the-main-window-handle-for-a-started-process
@TITLE:Why can't get the main window handle for a started process?
@CONTENT:I have a situation where I'm starting a process in my code in order to set up an IPC channel. The process I'm starting is an MFC application with no CLR support. The application from which I am starting this process is a C# module in a WPF application (thought I don't think that that is consequential to my problem). This works with a version of the application that does support CLR, and it works on every computer except the deployment target, a touch screen computer with Windows 7. But for some reason, when I try it with this exact scenario, the Process object never resolves a main window handle (Process.MainWindowHandle). Is there another (perhaps even pinvoke) method of doing this? Is this a security thing? I'm the one staring the process. The process's main window handle does exist. I don't see what could be wrong. If it helps, here is my code.         _applicationProcess = new Process();
        _applicationProcess.StartInfo.FileName = _strProcessPath;
        _applicationProcess.StartInfo.Arguments = _strProcessArguments;
        _applicationProcess.Start();

        long nTicks = Environment.TickCount;

@CONTENT:I am an Objective-C newbie, who still does not have a Mac, but still I want to practice the language. I heard that in the non-Mac world, GNUstep offers a good alternative to Cocoa, and can be used as a lerning tool for new objective-c developers. My question is, since GNUstep ports a lot of the Cocoa classes, what are the chances of me porting an iOS game + its development framework. I am talking about Canabalt for iOS (https://github.com/ericjohnson/canabalt-ios) which is based on the iOS version of the Flixel framework. I would like to know whether there is even the slightest chance of being able to port & run this game on windows using GNUstep. Remember, that this is entirely for educational purposes, so please, do not look for any practical value in it, besides me getting better with ObjC :) I guess that it should be technically possible. In general, what are the chances of porting any iOS app to Win using GNUstep?

@CONTENT:I am depending on a few artifacts that I need to both compile and run my application. According to the Gradle docs, the runtime configuration extends the compile configuration, so surely adding a dependency using runtime implies an implicit compile dependency? At least that was my assumption, but it does not work. When just depending on the artifact using runtime, my project does not compile anymore. I literally have to: compile 'oauth.signpost:signpost-core:1.2.1.2'
runtime 'oauth.signpost:signpost-core:1.2.1.2'
 for the application to both compile and see the Signpost classes at runtime. Am I missing something? That just doesn't look right...

@TITLE:R: passing expression to an inner function
@CONTENT:Further delving into the mysteries of R evaluation...This is closely related to my previous question ( How to write an R function that evaluates an expression within a data-frame ). Let's say I want to write a function topfn that takes a data-frame and an expression involving column-names of that data-frame. I want to pass both these arguments on to another function fn that actually evaluates the expression within the "environment" of the data-frame. And I want both fn and topfn to work correctly when passed a data-frame and an expression My first attempt, as suggested in the answer to the above question, is to define:  fn <- function(dfr, expr) {
   mf <- match.call()
   eval( mf$expr, envir = dfr )
 }
 And define topfn like this: topfn <- function(df, ex) {
  mf <- match.call()
  fn(df, mf$ex) 
}
 Now if I have a data-frame df <- data.frame( a = 1:5, b = 1:5 )
 the inner function fn works fine: > fn(df,a)
[1] 1 2 3 4 5
 But the topfn does not work: > topfn(df,a)
mf$ex
 To fix this I first check the class of topfn(df,a), > class(topfn(df,a))
[1] "call"
 This gives me an idea for an ugly hack to re-define fn as follows: fn <- function(dfr, expr) {
  mf <- match.call()
  res <- eval(mf$expr, envir = dfr)  
  if(class(res) == 'call')
    eval(expr, envir = dfr) else
  res
}
 And now both functions work: > fn(df,a)
[1] 1 2 3 4 5
> topfn(df,a)
[1] 1 2 3 4 5
 As I said, this looks like an ugly hack. Is there a better way (or more standard idiom) to get these working? I've consulted Lumley's curiously-named Standard NonStandard Evaluation Rules document http://developer.r-project.org/nonstandard-eval.pdf but wasn't particularly enlightened after reading it. Also helpful would be any pointers to source-code of functions I can look at for examples.
@CODE:topfn fn fn topfn fn <- function(dfr, expr) {
   mf <- match.call()
   eval( mf$expr, envir = dfr )
 } topfn topfn <- function(df, ex) {
  mf <- match.call()
  fn(df, mf$ex) 
} df <- data.frame( a = 1:5, b = 1:5 ) fn > fn(df,a)
[1] 1 2 3 4 5 topfn > topfn(df,a)
mf$ex topfn(df,a) > class(topfn(df,a))
[1] "call" fn fn <- function(dfr, expr) {
  mf <- match.call()
  res <- eval(mf$expr, envir = dfr)  
  if(class(res) == 'call')
    eval(expr, envir = dfr) else
  res
} > fn(df,a)
[1] 1 2 3 4 5

@TITLE:Why is it better to throw an exception rather than return an error code?
@CONTENT:Legacy error handling tends to follow the method that all functions return a code depending on success/failure. You would check this code and handle (if an error) appropriately. Modern programming languages however follow the exception model, where if something exceptional happens that cannot be handled properly an exception gets thrown - which keeps bubbling up until its handled. My question is why have we moved towards the exception model? What are the reasons behind this? Why is it better? Explanations/links would be much appreciated.

@TITLE:Is it better to reuse SqlCommand when executing the same SQL query several times?
@CONTENT:When querying the database with the same query but different parameters, is it better to: do it in a single using, or to create two separate queries? Example of a single using: using (SqlCommand addProduct = new SqlCommand(@"insert into [Products].[Products] ([Name], [Price]) values (@name, @price)", sqlConnection))
{
    // Insert the first product.
    addProduct.Parameters.AddWithValue("@name", "Product 1");
    addProduct.Parameters.AddWithValue("@price", 41F);
    int countAffectedRows = addProduct.ExecuteNonQuery();
    Debug.Assert(countAffectedRows == 1, "Wrong number of rows affected.");

    addProduct.Parameters.Clear();

    // Insert the second product.
    addProduct.Parameters.AddWithValue("@name", "Product 2");
    addProduct.Parameters.AddWithValue("@price", 49.9);
    countAffectedRows = addProduct.ExecuteNonQuery();
    Debug.Assert(countAffectedRows == 1, "Wrong number of rows affected.");
}
 Example of the same code using two separate queries: // Insert the first product.
using (SqlCommand addProduct = new SqlCommand(@"insert into [Products].[Products] ([Name], [Price]) values (@name, @price)", sqlConnection))
{
    addProduct.Parameters.AddWithValue("@name", "Product 1");
    addProduct.Parameters.AddWithValue("@price", 41F);
    int countAffectedRows = addProduct.ExecuteNonQuery();
    Debug.Assert(countAffectedRows == 1, "Wrong number of rows affected.");
}

// Insert the second product.
using (SqlCommand addProduct = new SqlCommand(@"insert into [Products].[Products] ([Name], [Price]) values (@name, @price)", sqlConnection))
{
    addProduct.Parameters.AddWithValue("@name", "Product 2");
    addProduct.Parameters.AddWithValue("@price", 49.9);
    int countAffectedRows = addProduct.ExecuteNonQuery();
    Debug.Assert(countAffectedRows == 1, "Wrong number of rows affected.");
}
 In my opinion, the second one must be preferred, because: it makes it more clear to see where the SQL command is disposed and how much times it is executed, it is easier to modify if, in future, for some reason, the query must be modified in one case, but not in the other, the first one makes it easy to forget the SqlCommand.Parameters.Clear(). On the other hand, the first sample is more explicit about the fact that the query is the same in both cases, and that only parameters change.
@CODE:using (SqlCommand addProduct = new SqlCommand(@"insert into [Products].[Products] ([Name], [Price]) values (@name, @price)", sqlConnection))
{
    // Insert the first product.
    addProduct.Parameters.AddWithValue("@name", "Product 1");
    addProduct.Parameters.AddWithValue("@price", 41F);
    int countAffectedRows = addProduct.ExecuteNonQuery();
    Debug.Assert(countAffectedRows == 1, "Wrong number of rows affected.");

    addProduct.Parameters.Clear();

    // Insert the second product.
    addProduct.Parameters.AddWithValue("@name", "Product 2");
    addProduct.Parameters.AddWithValue("@price", 49.9);
    countAffectedRows = addProduct.ExecuteNonQuery();
    Debug.Assert(countAffectedRows == 1, "Wrong number of rows affected.");
} // Insert the first product.

@TITLE:Call non-specialised template class function from specialized template class function
@CONTENT:Is it possible to call a function defined in a non-specialised template class from a specialised template class? Here is an example of what i am attempting: template <typename T>
struct Convert

 static inline void toString(unsigned num, unsigned places, std::string& str) { ... }
};

template <>
struct Convert<int8_t>
{
 static inline void toString(unsigned num, std::string& str)
 {
   Convert<int8_t>::toString(num, digitis(num), str);
 }
};
 GCC complains that it can't see the non-specialised class function; i.e. I guess it only looks within the specialised class. Any thoughts? EDIT Here is a more concrete example from my code (with a possible solution): struct NonSpecial { };

template <typename T>
class Convert
{

        template <typename R>
        static inline R fromString(const register char *str, const unsigned str_len)
        {   
            R result = 0;
            //convert str to R
            return result;
        }

        friend class Convert<int8_t>;
        friend class Convert<uint8_t>;
}

template <>
struct Convert<int8_t>     
{
    static inline int8_t fromString(const register char* str, const unsigned str_len = 4)
    {

    }

    {
        Convert<NonSpecial>::fromString<uint8_t>(str, str_len);    
    }
};
 I have other functions - toString(), countDigits(), etc. I have chosen this approach so I can keep the same function names for each type (i.e. don't need toStringU32(), toString32, etc.). I considered template specialization but I don't believe this is possible.
@CODE:template <typename T>
struct Convert

 static inline void toString(unsigned num, unsigned places, std::string& str) { ... }

 {
   Convert<int8_t>::toString(num, digitis(num), str);

        {   
            R result = 0;
            //convert str to R
            return result;

@TITLE:Performing a bitwise sum
@CONTENT:As part of a complex aggregate I want to know the bitwise sum of some data, i.e. if I have rows with values 1,1,1,2,2,8 the bitwise sum is 11. In this case the values are all exact powers of two (single bits), so I can hack around it by grouping and summing over the groups (obviously this example is a bit tortured compared to the real query): select SUM(y.test)
from (
    select x.test
    from ( -- garbage test data
        select 1 as [test]
        union all select 1
        union all select 1
        union all select 2
        union all select 2
        union all select 8) x
group by x.test) y
 but is there a clean way to perform a bitwise sum in [T]SQL?

@CONTENT:I have a base class that basically wraps up attaching a class to a arbitrary windows handle (e.g, HWND, HFONT), and uses a policy class to attach/detach and destroy: // class SmartHandle
template<typename THANDLE, class TWRAPPER, class TPOLICY>
class SmartHandle : boost::noncopyable
{
private:
    TPOLICY*  m_pPolicy;    // Policy
    bool m_bIsTemporary;    // Is this a temporary window?

    SmartHandle();  // no default ctor
    SmartHandle(const SmartHandle<THANDLE, TWRAPPER, TPOLICY>&);    // no cctor
protected:
    THANDLE   m_hHandle;    // Handle to the underlying window

    TPOLICY& policy() {return(*m_pPolicy);};

    // ctor that attaches but is temporary
    SmartHandle(const THANDLE& _handle, bool _temporary) : m_hHandle(_handle)
                                                         , m_bIsTemporary(_temporary)

        m_pPolicy = new TPOLICY(reinterpret_cast<TWRAPPER&>(*this));
        if(_handle)
            m_pPolicy->attach(_handle);
    };  // eo ctor

    // move ctor
    SmartHandle(SmartHandle<THANDLE, TWRAPPER, TPOLICY>&& _rhs) : m_hHandle(_rhs.m_hHandle)
                                                                      , m_bIsTemporary(_rhs.m_bIsTemporary)
    {
        m_pPolicy = new TPOLICY(reinterpret_cast<TWRAPPER&>(*this));

    };  // eo mtor

    // dtor
    virtual ~SmartHandle()
    {

        };
        delete(m_pPolicy);
        m_pPolicy = NULL;
    }; // eo dtor
 Note that I've declared the copy constructor private (with no implementation) as I do not want the class to be copied, but a move is allowed. My Window class derives from this:     class GALLOW_API Window : SmartHandle<HWND, Window, detail::_hWndPolicy>
    {
    friend class Application;
    private:
        static LRESULT CALLBACK wndProc(HWND _hWnd, UINT _message, WPARAM _wParam, LPARAM _lParam);

        // no copy/default ctor
        Window();
        Window(const Window&);
    protected:

    public:
        static const String ClassName;
        Window(const HWND& _hWnd);
        Window(const WindowCreateInfo& _createInfo);
        Window(Window&& _rhs);
        virtual ~Window();
    };  // eo class Window
 Once again, copy default/copy ctors. The implementation of the move constructor is:     Window::Window(Window&& _rhs) : SmartHandle(_rhs)
    {
    };  // eo mtor
 However, during compilation I get the following error on the first line of the move constructor implementation: 1>c:\\documents\visual studio 2010\projects\gallow\gallow\window.cpp(81): error C2248: 'gallow::SmartHandle<THANDLE,TWRAPPER,TPOLICY>::SmartHandle' : cannot access private member declared in class 'gallow::SmartHandle<THANDLE,TWRAPPER,TPOLICY>'
 So, it appears as if it is trying to call the copy constructor (which I've declared private) rather than the move constructor. Is there something simple I am missing here? Thanks in advance. EDIT: Modified mtor so it was non-const, error remains. EDIT2: I am using Visual C++ 2010.

@LINK:/questions/4379439/tired-of-non-semantic-testing-to-make-up-for-dynamic-typing-suggestions
@TITLE:Tired of non-semantic testing to make up for dynamic typing - suggestions?
@CONTENT:I used to do a lot of web programming in Rails (PHP before that) before I started studying computer engineering. Since then, I've done a lot of school work in C, and some personal stuff in Objective-C (Mac stuff). I learnt to love static typing. But now I'm having to do some professional web development (freelancing) and have picked up Rails once again. I'm finding it really annoying to write non-semantic type-checking tests. I was getting those for free from C and Objective-C compilers. I loved hitting Build and having the system check all my code to see that A can call B, B can call some obscure library C, etc. All I had to do was test the semantics. But with Rails, I'm the compiler. :( Has anyone treaded this same path? Are my only options for web development ASP.NET MVC with C# and Java + x framework? Looking for some suggestions, or even some sympathy... :P By the way, I make a specific reference to Rails rather than Ruby because I don't mind Ruby's dynamic nature for simple stuff like scripting or what not. But since Rails depends on so many gems and since one usually adds a number of other gems, the dynamic typing becomes an issue. Thanks! edit: I followed up on pst's suggestion and looked into Scala. In reading the book Programming in Scala, written by the language's creator, Martin Odersky, I came accross this bit of text that in many ways expresses my concerns and a bit more. Very interesting reading. Taken from page 52 of Martin Odersky's Programming in Scala: Scala is statically typed A static type system classifies variables and expressions according to the kinds of values they hold and compute. Scala stands out as a language with a very advanced static type system. Starting from a system of nested class types much like Javas, it allows you to parameterize types with generics, to combine types using intersections, and to hide details of types using abstract types. These give a strong foundation for building and composing your own types, so that you can design interfaces that are at the same time safe and flexible to use. If you like dynamic languages such as Perl, Python, Ruby, or Groovy, you might find it a bit strange that Scalas static type system is listed as one of its strong points. After all, the absence of a static type system has been cited by some as a major advantage of dynamic languages. The most common arguments against static types are that they make programs too verbose, prevent programmers from expressing themselves as they wish, and make impossible certain patterns of dynamic modifications of software systems. However, often these arguments do not go against the idea of static types in general, but against specific type systems, which are perceived to be too verbose or too inflexible. For instance, Alan Kay, the inventor of the Smalltalk language, once remarked: Im not against types, but I dont know of any type systemsthat arent a complete pain, so I still like dynamic typing. We hope to convince you in this book that Scalas type system is far from being a complete pain. In fact, it addresses nicely two of the usual concerns about static typing: verbosity is avoided through type inference and flexibility is gained through pattern matching and several new ways to write and compose types. With these impediments out of the way, the classical benefits of static type systems can be better appreciated. Among the most important of these benefits are verifiable properties of program abstractions, safe refactorings, and better documentation. Verifiable properties Static type systems can prove the absence of certain run-time errors. For instance, they can prove properties like: booleans are never added to integers; private variables are not accessed from outside their class; functions are applied to the right number of arguments; only strings are ever added to a set of strings. Other kinds of errors are not detected by todays static type systems. For instance, they will usually not detect non-terminating functions, array bounds violations, or divisions by zero. They will also not detect that your program does not conform to its specification (assuming there is a spec, that is!). Static type systems have therefore been dismissed by some as not being very useful. The argument goes that since such type systems can only detect simple errors, whereas unit tests provide more extensive coverage, why bother with static types at all? We believe that these arguments miss the point. Although a static type system certainly cannot replace unit testing, it can reduce the number of unit tests needed by taking care of some properties that would otherwise need to be tested. Likewise, unit testing cannot replace static typing. After all, as Edsger Dijkstra said, testing can only prove the presence of errors, never their absence. So the guarantees that static typing gives may be simple, but they are real guarantees of a form no amount of testing can deliver. Safe refactorings A static type system provides a safety net that lets you make changes to a codebase with a high degree of confidence. Consider for instance a refactoring that adds an additional parameter to a method. In a statically typed language you can do the change, re-compile your system and simply fix all lines that cause a type error. Once you have finished with this, you are sure to have found all places that need to be changed. The same holds for many other simple refactorings like changing a method name, or moving methods from one class to another. In all cases a static type check will provide enough assurance that the new system works just like the old. Documentation Static types are program documentation that is checked by the compiler for correctness. Unlike a normal comment, a type annotation can never be out of date (at least not if the source file that contains it has recently passed a compiler). Furthermore, compilers and integrated development environments can make use of type annotations to provide better context help. For instance, an integrated development environment can display all the members available for a selection by determining the static type of the expression on which the selection is made and looking up all members of that type.

I also use Boost in my existing codebase, and I need to use Activ from my existing code. Some points I can encapsulate my use of Activ so that the entire Activ part amounts to a single class I wrote that does not expose any of Activ's headers This single header file does not use any boost anything In this way I can ensure that the Activ parts of my code use Activ's Boost HPP files, and my code uses my Boost's HPP files My worry comes in linking. How can I ensure that my Activ dependent code links to Activ's Boost, and my other code links to my Boost? I'm using g++ now, will also be doing this in VS2008. I got it working in VS2008 before, but I have no idea how everything linked. I want to try to make sure it's done correctly. Is there a way to do it without further encapsulating the Activ part in a dynamic library? Edit: For one, my final product is always an executable file. For two, I statically link to boost myself. The Activ library includes both static and dynamic versions of Boost object libraries, and I plan to statically link it. I never pass Boost objects between code that uses different boost versions. The question is, how do I link one cpp or .o file to objects in one library file, and then make sure other .o files link to the identical objects in another library file? Is this possible?

 I am sure my question might take different when the TextBlocks are in a high nesting level having many siblings and ancestors. Considerations (based on personal thoughts only, I might be wrong in each particular one!): ElementName: Might search and compare current element to more control, thru all its children, siblings, uncles and great uncles including ancestors (maybe there is a HashTable of all the registered names?) Getting a Name property of a control should cost less performance than calling GetType. Comparing a string is cheaper than comparing types, especially when you know that most of the controls don't even have their Name set. FindAncestor: Will only iterate thru ancestors, not siblingls 'uncles', 'cousins' etc. Most likely uses GetType to determine ancestor type; GetType costs more performance then a simple Name property getter (maybe DPs are different?)

@TITLE:Why would the implicitly generated constructor (et al.) be more efficient than a user-defined (trivial) one?
@CONTENT:I read this article from D. Kalev this morning about the new c++11 feature "defaulted and deleted functions", and can't understand the part about performance, namely: the manual definition of a special member function (even if it's trivial) is usually less efficient than an implicitly-defined one. By googling to find an answer, I found another article of the same author: the synthesized constructor and copy constructor enable the implementation to create code that's more efficient than user-written code, because it can apply optimizations that aren't always possible otherwise. There is no explication, but I read time to time similar claims. But how is it that writing: class C { C() = default; };
 can be more efficient than class C { C(){} };
 ? I though a compiler would be smart enough to detect such situation and optimize that. In other words how is it easier for the compiler to optimize when it sees =default instead of {} (void body function)? Edit: the question was edited to add the "c++11" tag, but this question remains in c++03 context: just replace class C {C()=default;}; by class C {};, so not really a c++11 specific question.
@CODE:class C { C() = default; }; class C { C(){} }; =default {} class C {C()=default;}; class C {};

 The only difference is in first line. First code works fine, but the second one crashes. The question is why?? Problem is somewhere in actualNumberOfChromosomes, but I would like to understand why, and not just solve this. I could solve this by creating addition variable p and assigning actualNumberOfChromosomes to it and changing the loop so i was equal to p, in such case both codes work fine.

@CONTENT:I've been getting used to Vim/MacVim for the last few weeks. One of main problems I seem to be having is when I scroll around using the mouse (especially when I'm trying to select large portions of text) the text insertion cursor moves too and doesn't stay where it was (like in TextMate for example). This means I've selected a large piece of text, when I scroll back up to review my selection the cursor will move which messes with the selection that I've made. I do realise I should get used to text selection with visual mode, and I am one bit of a time, but sometimes it's the best tool to use the mouse. Is there a way of fixing this behaviour?

@LINK:/questions/4189581/should-an-ienumerable-iterator-on-a-queue-dequeue-an-item
@TITLE:Should an IEnumerable iterator on a Queue dequeue an item
@CONTENT:I have created a custom generic queue which implements a generic IQueue interface, which uses the generic Queue from the System.Collections.Generic namespace as a private inner queue. Example has been cleaned of irrelevant code. public interface IQueue<TQueueItem>
{
    void Enqueue(TQueueItem queueItem);
    TQueueItem Dequeue();
}

public class CustomQueue<TQueueItem> : IQueue<TQueueItem>
{
    private readonly Queue<TQueueItem> queue = new Queue<TQueueItem>();
    ...
    public void Enqueue(TQueueItem queueItem)
    {
        ...
        queue.Enqueue( queueItem );
        ...
    }

    public TQueueItem Dequeue()
    {
        ...
        return queue.Dequeue();
        ...
    }
}
 I want to keep things consistent with the core implementations and have noticed that the core Queue implements IEnumerable so I will do the same either by explicitly implementing IEnumerable on the class or inheriting it with the IQueue interface. What I want to know is when enumerating over the queue should each move next dequeue the next item? I have used reflector to see how Microsoft has done it and all they do is step through the queues private array but Microsoft is far from infallible so I wanted to get a general opinion. public class CustomQueue<TQueueItem> : IQueue<TQueueItem>, IEnumerable<TQueueItem>
{
    ...

    public IEnumerator<TQueueItem> GetEnumerator()
    {
        while (queue.Count > 0)
        {
            yield return Dequeue();
        }
    }

    //Or

    public IEnumerator<TQueueItem> GetEnumerator()
    {
        return queue.GetEnumerator();
    }

    ...
}
 I am in two minds, on one hand I feel that iterating through a collection should not changed the collections state but on the other hand and especially with my particular implementation it would make the usage look clean. EDIT To put things into context. The class that I am implementing does a Monitor.Wait when Dequeuing and there are no items in the queue. When an item is put onto the queue there is a Monitor.Pulse. This allows for one thread to push stuff onto the queue and the other to essentially "watch" the queue. From a coding point of view I am trying to decide which it looks cleaner: foreach(QueueItem item in queue)
{
    DoSomethingWithThe(item);
}

//Or

while(systemIsRunning)
{
    DoSomethingWithThe(queue.Dequeue());
}
 For my particular implementation it wouldn't matter if there were multiple process dequeuing items. Because it is a queue they can both pick of an item as no item should be processed more than once, hence the use of a queue. EDIT Interestingly enough I have found a blog post where someone has done exactly this. http://blogs.msdn.com/b/toub/archive/2006/04/12/blocking-queues.aspx EDIT One last stab at this before I close this off. How do people feel about the class not implement IEnumerable but having an IEnumerator GetEnumerator() method that dequeues items? The .net language supports duck typing, foreach being one of the uses. Perhaps this deserves it's own question? EDIT Have raised the question of implementing a GetEnumerator method without implementing IEnumerable in another question.

@TITLE:Do I need to open my source code if I use OpenJDK as JVM? [closed]
@CONTENT:With the current developments regarding Oracle announcing its intention to charge for a pro (or whatever you call it) version of JVM, and IBM announcing its intention to support OpenJDK, things are getting quite complicated for a large set of Java developers. We have a large piece of work in Java, and we did not have any issues in choosing our licensing terms up until now. It appears that we'll have to switch to OpenJDK where IBM will be putting their support. But OpenJDK is GPL V2, and as far as I know, any code linking to GPL V2 must be GPL V2. We also have some JNI code, which is going to get even larger. Given these facts, does it mean that if we use OpenJDK to run our software, we'll have to switch to GPL for our licensing? Needless to say, this would blow away our whole licensing & business model setup.

@LINK:/questions/4082065/zombie-objects-after-stdmove
@TITLE:Zombie objects after std::move
@CONTENT:I'm confused about the state of an object after it's been moved using C++0x move semantics. My understanding is that once an object has been moved, it's still a valid object, but its internal state has been altered so that when its destructor is called, no resources are deallocated. But if my understanding is correct, the destructor of a moved object should still be called. But, that doesn't happen when I perform a simple test: struct Foo
{
    Foo()  
    {
        s = new char[100]; 
        cout << "Constructor called!" << endl;  
    }

    Foo(Foo&& f) 
    {
        s = f.s;
        f.s = 0;
    }

    ~Foo() 
    { 
        cout << "Destructor called!" << endl;   
        delete[] s; // okay if s is NULL
    }

    void dosomething() { cout << "Doing something..." << endl; }

    char* s;
};

void work(Foo&& f2)
{
    f2.dosomething();
}

int main()
{
    Foo f1;
    work(std::move(f1));
}
 This output: Constructor called!
Doing something...
Destructor called!
 Notice the destructor is only called once. This shows that my understanding here is off. Why wasn't the destructor called twice? Here's my interpretation of what should have happened: Foo f1 is constructed. Foo f1 is passed to work, which takes an rvalue f2. The move constructor of Foo is called, moving all resources in f1 to f2. Now f2's destructor is called, releasing all resources. Now f1's destructor is called, which doesn't actually do anything since all resources were transferred to f2. Still, the destructor is called nonetheless. But since only one destructor is called, either step 4 or step 5 isn't happening. I did a backtrace from the destructor to see where it was being invoked from, and it's being invoked from step 5. So why isn't f2's destructor also called? EDIT: Okay, I modified this so it's actually managing a resource. (An internal memory buffer.) Still, I get the same behavior where the destructor is only called once.
@CODE:struct Foo
{
    Foo()  
    {
        s = new char[100]; 
        cout << "Constructor called!" << endl;  
    }

    Foo(Foo&& f) 
    {
        s = f.s;
        f.s = 0;

@TITLE:Why does Math.Exp give different results between 32-bit and 64-bit, with same input, same hardware
@CONTENT:I am using .NET 2.0 with PlatformTarget x64 and x86. I am giving Math.Exp the same input number, and it returns different results in either platform. MSDN says you can't rely on a literal/parsed Double to represent the same number between platforms, but I think my use of Int64BitsToDouble below avoids this problem and guarantees the same input to Math.Exp on both platforms. My question is why are the results different? I would have thought that: the input is stored in the same way (double/64-bit precision) the FPU would do the same calculations regardless of processor's bitness the output is stored in the same way I know I should not compare floating-point numbers after the 15/17th digit in general, but I am confused about the inconsistency here with what looks like the same operation on the same hardware. Any one know what's going on under the hood? double d = BitConverter.Int64BitsToDouble(-4648784593573222648L); // same as Double.Parse("-0.0068846153846153849") but with no concern about losing digits in conversion
Debug.Assert(d.ToString("G17") == "-0.0068846153846153849"
    && BitConverter.DoubleToInt64Bits(d) == -4648784593573222648L); // true on both 32 & 64 bit

double exp = Math.Exp(d);

Console.WriteLine("{0:G17} = {1}", exp, BitConverter.DoubleToInt64Bits(exp));
// 64-bit: 0.99313902928727449 = 4607120620669726947
// 32-bit: 0.9931390292872746  = 4607120620669726948
 The results are consistent on both platforms with JIT turned on or off. [Edit] I'm not completely satisfied with the answers below so here are some more details from my searching. http://www.manicai.net/comp/debugging/fpudiff/ says that: So 32-bit is using the 80-bit FPU registers, 64-bit is using the 128-bit SSE registers. And the CLI Standard says that doubles can be represented with higher precision if the hardware supports it: [Rationale: This design allows the CLI to choose a platform-specific high-performance representation for floating-point numbers until they are placed in storage locations. For example, it might be able to leave floating-point variables in hardware registers that provide more precision than a user has requested. At the Partition I 69 same time, CIL generators can force operations to respect language-specific rules for representations through the use of conversion instructions. end rationale] http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-335.pdf (12.1.3 Handling of floating-point data types) I think this is what is happening here, because the results different after Double's standard 15 digits of precision. The 64-bit Math.Exp result is more precise (it has an extra digit) because internally 64-bit .NET is using an FPU register with more precision than the FPU register used by 32-bit .NET.
@CODE:double d = BitConverter.Int64BitsToDouble(-4648784593573222648L); // same as Double.Parse("-0.0068846153846153849") but with no concern about losing digits in conversion
Debug.Assert(d.ToString("G17") == "-0.0068846153846153849"
    && BitConverter.DoubleToInt64Bits(d) == -4648784593573222648L); // true on both 32 & 64 bit

double exp = Math.Exp(d);

Console.WriteLine("{0:G17} = {1}", exp, BitConverter.DoubleToInt64Bits(exp));
// 64-bit: 0.99313902928727449 = 4607120620669726947

@CONTENT:I want to create a flowchart in OpenOffice Draw. Since there's a lot of steps to show (and may change in future) but I can extract the data, I want to automate the creation with the following steps: Create a new ODG document with specified page settings. Insert flow chart shapes with specified properties. Connect those things with arrows. Ideally, auto-organise things into sensible positions. I don't want to spend hours reading about some "UNO" thing - I just want code examples that I can adapt as required. Not bothered if the example code uses the OO API, or just modify XML files inside a zipped template - so long as it lets me do the above things easily enough. I'm doing this with Railo (CFML), but I can also work with Java, or convert snippets from other readable languages. Any suggestions how to go about this? Update: I've started playing with the XML route - I saved an empty file, and a file with a single object, and compared the two (treating as zips) to see the difference, then repeated a few times with different changes to help understand what's going on. I have some very basic (and incomplete) code which can create shapes and connect them, which can be seen here: http://gist.github.com/634306 It's very crude, but I can probably work out a way to use what I've got now to produce what I need - but I'm still hoping that someone can point me towards a better way of doing this - particularly since I'll need to figure out some way of positioning the shapes appropriately, which wont be trivial. I've created a distinct question for this fourth point: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3970366/how-do-i-auto-layout-boxes-on-a-flowchart Update 2: From that other question, I have discovered GraphViz which can visualise graphs from data - and I've created a 'digraph' from my data - so all I need is a way to convert the output of GraphViz into something which OpenOffice Draw can accept. The obvious thought there would be SVG, but it seems OpenOffice hasn't implemented SVG properly yet, so I need to come up with another plan.

@TITLE:Optimized order of HTML attributes for compression
@CONTENT:I read somewhere that organizing HTML attributes in a certain order can improve the rate of compression for the HTML document. (I think I read this from Google or Yahoo recommendation for faster sites). If I recall correctly, the recommendation was to put the most common attributes first (e.g. id, etc.) then put the rest in alphabetical order. I'm a bit confused by this. For example, if id attributes were put right after every p tag, the id would contain unique values. Thus, the duplicated string would be limited to this: <p id=" (say there were <p id="1"> and <p id="2"/>). Because the value of id needs to be unique, I see this as actually causing an adverse effect to the compression. Am I wrong? If I needed to go through a static web page with randomly ordered attributes, what logic should I use to organize attributes to achieve maximum compression?

@TITLE:Sounds fade in/out with ActionScript 3
@CONTENT:I am trying to make a fade in/out in a music in a Flash (CS5) project. I imported the sound to library, set a classname for "Export for ActionScript", and I was trying to fade with TweenLite/TweenMax, like this: var sound = new MySound();
sT = new SoundTransform(0.1);
sound.play(0,99999, c_sndEnvironment);
TweenLite.to(sound, 1, {volume: 1.0});
 But it just doesn't work. I tried to import the volume plugin on TweenLite, and still nothing. I got no error at all though. Am I doing anything wrong? Plus, is there any good (complete) AS3 library for music? Thank you. :)

@CONTENT:I have created a linux service that runs as a deamon (and gets started from /etc/init.d/X). I need to set some environment variables that can be accessed by the application. Here's the scenario. The application is a bunch of Perl AGI scripts that depend on (and therefore need to run as) asterisk user but asterisk doesn't have a shell. Ideally I'd just set this in /home/asterisk/.bashrc but that doesn't exist for asterisk. How can I set environment variables for my app in the asterisk user's running environment so that my app can use them?

 Where I am (UK) the clocks go one hour forward for summer time. In Python I get the local Epoch time using time.time() (and for the sake of argument, right now the time is 17:15:00) which gives me a value of 1286122500. If I convert this back to a human readable time using time.localtime() it converts back to 17:15 as I would expect. How do I convert unix epoch time back to a .NET DateTime value AND account for local daylight savings time. My function above converts 1286122500 back to 16:15 which is incorrect for my geographic location.

@TITLE:How do you think through and predict the output of a threading question like this?
@CONTENT:I'm prepping for the SCJP, and multithreading has been my shakiest area, mostly because I don't know how to look at multithreading code and walk through it. So far my approach has been to write down in English what might be happening in each thread and testing a few cases with threads randomly intersecting each other, which is a really hit-and-miss and time-consuming approach. So I'd like to see how a pro would go about it. Would you be willing to read the code below (it's the latest question that's giving me trouble) and write down what goes through your head (code-related stuff only, please :) as you work out the possible outputs? The choices that come with the question are at the end. What I'm looking for isn't the solution, which I have, but how one arrives at the solution efficiently on the exam. And yeah, I know this question doesn't have a precise answer, etc etc. Accepted vote goes to the answer that's clearest and easiest to emulate, okay :) Thanks everyone! Question: Which of these answers are possible outputs? public class Threads1 {

    int x = 0;

@TITLE:Why am I getting Non-exhaustive patterns in functionK when I invoke my Haskell substring function?
@CONTENT:I'm working my way through the book The Haskell Road to Logic, Maths and Programming. (I'm only mid-way through chapter 1, but I'm enjoying it so far and intend to continue.) I've read through the section 1.5 "Playing the Haskell Game" which "consists of a number of further examples to get you acquainted with [Haskell]". So far I've learned about functions, type declarations, guarded equations, a little about list pattern matching, and where & let. I'm stuck on exercise 1.17, which asks us to write a function substring :: String -> String -> Bool where: if xs is a prefix of ys, xs is a substring of ys if ys equals y:ys' and xs is a substring of ys', xs is a substring of ys nothing else is a substring of ys I used the prefix function provided in a previous example: prefix :: String -> String -> Bool
prefix [] ys = True
prefix (x:xs) [] = False
prefix (x:xs) (y:ys) = (x==y) && prefix xs ys
 And then tried: substring :: String -> String -> Bool
subsstring xs [] = False
substring xs (y:ys) | prefix xs (y:ys) = True
                    | substring xs ys  = True
                    | otherwise        = False
 ...and may other permutations of this. When I run substring "abc" "xxxabcyyy" I get True, but when I run substring "abc" "xxxabyyy" I get "* Exception: substring.hs:(3,0)-(5,45): Non-exhaustive patterns in function substring". I can't figure out why. I don't understand how there could be non-exhaustive patterns when I use "otherwise". BTW, the book has not yet covered if-then-else. I'd prefer to keep that out of my solution, for now.
@CODE:prefix :: String -> String -> Bool
prefix [] ys = True
prefix (x:xs) [] = False
prefix (x:xs) (y:ys) = (x==y) && prefix xs ys substring :: String -> String -> Bool
subsstring xs [] = False
substring xs (y:ys) | prefix xs (y:ys) = True
                    | substring xs ys  = True
                    | otherwise        = False substring "abc" "xxxabcyyy" True substring "abc" "xxxabyyy"

Is there a way to keep the linewidth to the perceived size of 2 or the original size. In short, I want to just scale the size of the rectangle but keep the linewidth visually of size 2. I tried setting the linewidth before and after the scale(2,2) command but the border width also increases. One option is to divide the linewidth by the scale factor and this will work if the x and y scale factors are the same. I don't have the option to scale the rectangle width and height and I need to use the scale command as I have other objects within the rectangle that need the scaling.

@TITLE:Benefits of [NonSerialized] when [Serializable] is not used
@CONTENT:I'm looking through some existing code in a project I'm working on, and I found a class that is implemented as: public class ThingOne
{
    private int A;

    private int B;

    [NonSerialized]
    private System.Timers.Timer timer1;
}
 Shouldn't it look more like this? [Serializable]
public class ThingOne
{
    private int A;

    private int B;

    [NonSerialized]
    private System.Timers.Timer timer1;
}
 Or is there some additional benefit to adding [NonSerialized] even when the class itself is not Serializable?
@CODE:public class ThingOne
{
    private int A;

    private int B;

    [NonSerialized]
    private System.Timers.Timer timer1;
} [Serializable]
public class ThingOne
{
    private int A;

    private int B;

    [NonSerialized]
    private System.Timers.Timer timer1;
}

@TITLE:FIRST ORDER BY K THEN GROUP BY
@CONTENT:I have two tables, one stores the users, the other stores the users' email addresses. table users: (userId, username, etc) table userEmail: (emailId, userId, email) I would like to do a query that allows me to fetch the latest email address along with the user record. I'm basically looking for a query that says FIRST ORDER BY userEmail.emailId DESC 
THEN GROUP BY userEmail.userId
 This can be done with: SELECT 
  users.userId
, users.username
, (
     SELECT 
       userEmail.email
     FROM userEmail
     WHERE userEmail.userId = users.userId
     ORDER BY userEmail.emailId DESC
     LIMIT 1
  ) AS email
FROM users
ORDER BY users.username;
 But this does a subquery for every row and is very inefficient. (It is faster to do 2 separate queries and 'join' them together in my program logic). The intuitive query to write for what I want would be: SELECT 
  users.userId
, users.username
, userEmail.email
FROM users
LEFT JOIN userEmail USING(userId)
GROUP BY users.userId
ORDER BY 
  userEmail.emailId
, users.username;
 But, this does not function as I would like. (The GROUP BY is performed before the sorting, so the ORDER BY userEmail.emailId has nothing to do). So my question is: Is it possible to write the first query without making use of the subqueries? I've searched and read the other questions on stackoverflow, but none seems to answer the question about this query pattern.
@CODE:userId username etc emailId userId email FIRST ORDER BY userEmail.emailId DESC 
THEN GROUP BY userEmail.userId SELECT 
  users.userId
, users.username
, (
     SELECT 
       userEmail.email
     FROM userEmail
     WHERE userEmail.userId = users.userId
     ORDER BY userEmail.emailId DESC
     LIMIT 1
  ) AS email
FROM users
ORDER BY users.username; SELECT

According to the documentation the "filters are executed in the order they are defined" but it is unclear what that definition refers to. I am familiar with how that works for Java EE ServletFilters, where the sequence is declared by the order of corresponding tags in the web.xml, but as the deployment is handled automatically in Grails, I am not really sure where I could influence the order in which the filters are set up. Is that possible at all in Grails, and if so, how? Update If several filters are declared within one class, it's obvious that they'll be executed in the order that they were declared. I am more concerned with filters defined in different classes and the sequence that those classes will be considered in.

@TITLE:Should I use (otherwise optimal) class names that conflict with the .NET BCL's names?
@CONTENT:This situation probably is not entirely uncommon to some of you: you have some functionality to put in a class but the perfect name (*) for that class is taken by one of the classes in the System namespace or other namespace/class that's not yours but you're using/importing. (*) By perfect I mean small, concise and clear names. For instance I have an Utils class that has a Diagnostics (mostly debug utils) class and a Drawing class. I could: have a DrawingUtils class and a DiagnosticsUtils class, but that just smells like bad structure. pick a thesaurus and be done with an worse, longer or awkward name that's casually still not taken. Write class names in my native language instead of English. Ask the smart guys at StackOverflow. I think options 1-3 aren't promising :( EDIT: Since my chosen answer doesn't address the problem definitively (neither I do), what I'd recommend for people facing the same situation is to ask yourselves: Will you frequently use the conflicting BCL class/namespace? If no, then let your name conflict (as I did with Diagnostics). If yes, add a word that limits the possibilities of your class/namespace. In practice, this means: "Drawing": Something that draws. "MyCustomControlDrawing": Something that draws only on MyCustomControl. e.g.: "WidgetDrawing". EDIT2: Another solution to take a look next time: Extension Methods (courtesy of Lawnmower).

@LINK:/questions/3391510/asp-mvc-friendly-urls-and-relative-path-images
@TITLE:ASP MVC Friendly URL's and Relative Path Images
@CONTENT:I have an ASP.NET MVC page, where I am trying to show friendly URL's. So, I have a Category View in the Home Controller, that accepts a categoryKey value to get the content of the page. For instance: http://localhost/Home/Category/Bikes gets the bike content. in my Global.asax.cs, i have the following to handle this: public static void RegisterRoutes(RouteCollection routes)
{
  routes.IgnoreRoute("{resource}.axd/{*pathInfo}");

  routes.MapRoute(
      "Category",
      "{controller}/{action}/{categoryKey}",
      new { controller = "Home", action = "Category", categoryKey = "" });

  routes.MapRoute(
      "Default", // Route name
      "{controller}/{action}/{id}", // URL with parameters
      new { controller = "Home", action = "Index", id = UrlParameter.Optional } // Parameter defaults
  );
}
 This works just fine, and it gets the content, however, I am getting the content from a Content Management system, for easy editing. When you add an image on the content management, it adds the image with a relative path: <img src="../AdminUploadContent/bikes.gif" alt="Bikes" />
 Now, if i goto "http://localhost/Home/Category", and that image tag is on the base page, it will pull up the image. However, if i goto "http://localhost/Home/Category/", or add the actual category of "/Home/Category/Bikes"/, the image doesn't show up. The properties of the image is pointing to "http://localhost/Home/AdminUploadContent/bikes.gif". Is there anything I can put in my Global.aspx.cs file to handle the relative path? Even if i manually edit the content management to add ../../AdminUploadContent/bikes.gif, it is chopping off the first ../, since it is doing some validation.
@CODE:public static void RegisterRoutes(RouteCollection routes)
{
  routes.IgnoreRoute("{resource}.axd/{*pathInfo}");

  routes.MapRoute(
      "Category",
      "{controller}/{action}/{categoryKey}",
      new { controller = "Home", action = "Category", categoryKey = "" });

  routes.MapRoute(
      "Default", // Route name
      "{controller}/{action}/{id}", // URL with parameters
      new { controller = "Home", action = "Index", id = UrlParameter.Optional } // Parameter defaults
  );

@TITLE:Can eclipse convert/refactor a method to a class?
@CONTENT:This seems like it should be fairly straight-forward, but I can't see anything obvious. What I basically want to do it to point at a method and refactor->extract class. This would take the method in question to a new class with that method as top level public API. The refactoring would also drag any required methods and variables along with it to the new class, deleting them from the old class if nothing else in the old class is using it. This is a repetitive task I often encounter when refactoring legacy code. Anyway, I'm currently using Eclipse 3.0.2, but would still be interested in the answer if its available in a more recent version of eclipse. Thanks!

@TITLE:c#, Excel + csv: how to get the correct encoding?
@CONTENT:I've been trying this for quite a while now, but can't figure it out. I'm trying to export data to Excel via a *.csv file. It works great so far, but I have some encoding problems when opening the files in Excel. (original string on the left, EXCEL result on the right): Messwert(?m / m) ==> Messwert(??m / m)

D?mme M?ss?ng ==> D??mme M??ss??ng
 Notepad++ tells me that the file is encoded "ANSI as UTF8"(WTF?) So here are different ways I tried to get a valid result: obvious implementation: tWriter.Write(";Messwert(?m /m)");
 more sophisticated one (tried probably a dozen or more encoding combinations:) tWriter.Write(Encoding.Default.GetString(Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes(";Messwert(?m /m)")));
tWriter.Write(Encoding.ASCII.GetString(Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes(";Messwert(?m /m)")));
 and so on Whole source code for the method creating the data:     MemoryStream tStream = new MemoryStream();
    StreamWriter tWriter = new StreamWriter(tStream);
    tWriter.Write("\uFEFF");

    tWriter.WriteLine(string.Format("{0}", aMeasurement.Name));
    tWriter.WriteLine(aMeasurement.Comment);
    tWriter.WriteLine();
    tWriter.WriteLine("Zeit in Minuten;Messwert(?m / m)");

    TimeSpan tSpan;
    foreach (IMeasuringPoint tPoint in aMeasurement)
    {
        tSpan = new TimeSpan(tPoint.Time - aMeasurement[0].Time);
        tWriter.WriteLine(string.Format("{0};{1};", (int)tSpan.TotalMinutes, getMPString(tPoint)));

@TITLE:Formatting strings in ASP.NET Razor
@CONTENT:I am currently writing a small templating system in ASP.NET to allow users to add content. For example, the user can enter the string (variable type is string). topHeader[x] = "They think it's all over. It is now!";
 However, one change that's needed is the ability to add some basic HTML tags within this content, so the following can be done topHeader[x] = "They think it's all over. <strong>It is now!</strong>";
 or topHeader[x] = "They think it's all over. <a title="Football News" href="URL">It is now!</a>";
 If you add such things into strings now they are not formatted as HTML, but I want to somehow escape them so that they can be. Naturally I've looked on the Internet for the answer, but as Razor is fairly new there's not much out there to help me out. Anyone have an idea of how to do this?

@LINK:/questions/3322136/two-loop-bodies-or-one-result-identical
@TITLE:Two loop bodies or one (result identical)
@CONTENT:I have long wondered what is more efficient with regards to making better use of CPU caches (which are known to benefit from locality of reference) - two loops each iterating over the same mathematical set of numbers, each with a different loop body, or having one loop that "concatenates" the two bodies into one, and thus accomplishes identical total result, but all in itself? In my opinion, having two loops would introduce fewer cache misses and evictions because more instructions and data used by the loop fit in the cache. Am I right? Assuming: Cost of f and g each is negligible compared to cost of completing the entire loop containing each f and g use most of the cache each by itself, and so the cache will be invalidated by one being called after another (which would be the case with a single-loop-body version) Intel Core Duo CPU C language source code gcc compiler, no switches The set being iterated over is a mathematical set, not a container of numbers in memory like a vector or a list. See the example below. Please no answers of the "premature optimization is evil" character :-) An example of the two-loops version that I am advocating for: int j = 0, k = 0;

for(int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++)

    j += f(i);
}

for(int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++)

@CODE:<td> item </td><td> order code </td><td> price </td> $.each($('.productList tbody tr'), function() {
    var orderCode = $(this).find('td:eq(1)').html().trim();
    // do stuff
}); <td colspan="3"> There are no products to display </td> colspan="1" colspan is not set

@TITLE:Is there any limit on number of html elements, that browser can display without problems?
@CONTENT:Basically I've got a huge table, which gets even bigger as user scrolls down (auto preloading subsequent rows). At some point browser becomes sluggish, it starts to hang for a moment as I click around or try to scroll and more sluggish it becomes, the more rows it gets. I wonder if there is any limit on number of elements that page can hold? Or maybe it's just my javascript leaking somewhere (although I've got only one event handler, attached to the tbody of the table - and a script that parses bubbled mousedown events). Update: Delay becomes noticeable after a thousand of loaded rows. The speed of scroll itself is pretty bearable, but for example highlighting of the clicked row (with the help of single event handler on tbody) is painful (it takes at least 2-3 seconds and delay grows with the number of rows). I observe delay on all browsers. It's not only me, but almost everyone who visits the page, so I guess at some extent it affects every platform. Update: I came up with simple example here: http://client.infinity-8.me/table.php?num=1000 (you can pass whatever number you want to num), basically it renders a table with num rows and has a single event handler attached to a parent table. I should conclude from this, that there actually is no noticeable dropdown in performance, caused by number of child elements. So it's probably a leak somewhere else :(

 and I define the function outside of a class, how is this function an object? I realize that I can call foo.class
 And I get NilClass. Does this mean that foo is an instance of NilClass? And if it is, what does it mean exactly when I call foo "hello world"
 If foo is an object, what method am I calling when I make the statement as above. Also, if it an object, does that mean I can modify it and add another method to it (say bar) where I could possibly make the following statment: foo.bar(some variables)
 Sorry, I'm just a little confused on this point. Any clarification is very much appreciated! Thanks!

@TITLE:Switch case assembly level code
@CONTENT:I am programming C on cygwin windows. After having done a bit of C programming and getting comfortable with the language, I wanted to look under the hood and see what the compiler is doing for the code that I write. So I wrote down a code block containing switch case statements and converted them into assembly using: gcc -S foo.c  
 Here is the C source: switch(i)
{
    case 1:
    {
        printf("Case 1\n");
        break;
    }
    case 2:
    {           printf("Case 2\n");
        break;
    }
    case 3:
    {
        printf("Case 3\n");
        break;
    }
    case 4:
    {
        printf("Case 4\n");
        break;
    }
    case 5:
    {
        printf("Case 5\n");
        break;
    }
    case 6:
    {
        printf("Case 6\n");
        break;
    }
    case 7:
    {
        printf("Case 7\n");
        break;
    }
    case 8:
    {
        printf("Case 8\n");
        break;
    }
    case 9:
    {
        printf("Case 9\n");
        break;
    }
    case 10:
    {
        printf("Case 10\n");
        break;
    }
    default:
    {
        printf("Nothing\n");
        break;
    }
}  
 Now the resultant assembly for the same is: movl    $5, -4(%ebp)

 Now, in the assembly, the code is first checking the last case (i.e. case 10) first. This is very strange. And then it is copying 'i' into 'eax' and doing things that are beyond me. I have heard that the compiler implements some jump table for switch..case. Is it what this code is doing? Or what is it doing and why? Because in case of less number of cases, the code is pretty similar to that generated for if...else ladder, but when number of cases increases, this unusual-looking implementation is seen. Thanks in advance.

 [Update 06/10/2010] The xml file is a complex file. Included thousands of gids. But for each of Xpath, the gid is unique. I load the xml file to a TreeView control. this.treeView1.AfterSelect += new System.Windows.Forms.TreeViewEventHandler(this.treeView1_AfterSelect);. When treeView1_AfterSelect event occurred, the e.Node.FullPath will return as a String Value. I parse the string Value e.Node.FullPath. Then I got the member of XPath Above. Then I tried to find which gid item was selected. I need find the gid value as a return value indeed.

@LINK:/questions/3000812/varchar-columns-nullable-or-not
@TITLE:Varchar columns: Nullable or not
@CONTENT:The database development standards in our organization state the varchar fields should not allow null values. They should have a default value of an empty string (""). I know this makes querying and concatenation easier, but today, one of my coworkers questioned me about why that standard only existed for varchar types an not other datatypes (int, datetime, etc). I would like to know if others consider this to be a valid, defensible standard, or if varchar should be treated the same as fields of other data types? I believe this standard is valid for the following reason: I believe that an empty string and null values, though technically different, are conceptually the same. An empty, zero length string is a string that does not exist. It has no value. However, a numeric value of 0 is not the same as NULL. For example, if a field called OutstandingBalance has a value of 0, it means there are $0.00 remaining. However, if the same field is NULL, that means the value is unknown. On the other hand, a field called CustomerName with a value of "" is basically the same as a value of NULL because both represent the non-existence of the name. I read somewhere that an analogy for an empty string vs. NULL is that of a blank CD vs. no CD. However, I believe this to be a false analogy because a blank CD still phyically exists and still has physical data space that does not have any meaningful data written to it. Basically, I believe a blank CD is the equivalent of a string of blank spaces (" "), not an empty string. Therefore, I believe a string of blank spaces to be an actual value separate from NULL, but an empty string to be the absense of value conceptually equivalent to NULL. Please let me know if my beliefs regarding variable length strings are valid, or please enlighten me if they are not. I have read several blogs / arguments regarding this subject, but still do not see a true conceptual difference between NULLs and empty strings.

@LINK:/questions/2992295/correct-use-of-a-for-in-loop-in-javascript
@TITLE:Correct use of a forKin loop in javascript?
@CONTENT:before I ask my question I wanted to let everybody know that I appreciate the fact that there's always somebody out there willing to help, and on my end I'll try to give back to the community as much as I can. Thanks Now, I would like to get some pointers as to how to properly take advantage of the "for...in" loop in JavaScript, I already did some research and tried a couple things but it is still not clear to me how to properly use it. Let's say I have a random number of "select" tags in an HTML form, and I don't require the user to select an option for all of them, they can leave some untouched if they want. However I need to know if they selected none or at least one. The way I'm trying to find out if the user selected any of them is by using the "for...in" loop. For example: var allSelected = $("select option:selected");
var totalSelected = $("select option:selected").length;
 The first variable produces an array of all the selected options. The second variable tells me how many selected options I have in the form (select tags could be more than one and it changes every time). Now, in order to see if any has been selected I loop through each element (selected option), and retrieve the "value" attribute. The default "option" tag has a value="0", so if any selected option returns a value greater than 0, I know at least one option has been selected, however it does not have to be in order, this is my loop so far: for(var i = 0; i < totalSelected; i++){
  var eachOption = $(allSelected[i]).val();
  var defaultValue = 0;
  if(eachOption == defaultValue){
    ...redirect to another page
  }else if(eachOption > defaultValue){
    ... I display an alert
  }
}
 My problem here is that as soon as the "if" matches a 0 value, it sends the user to the next page without testing the rest of the elements in the array, and the user could have selected the second or third options. What I really want to do is check all the elements in the array and then take the next action, in my mind this is how I could do it, but I'm not getting it right: var randomValue = 25;  
for(randomValue in allSelected){
  var found = true;
  var notFound = false
  if(found){
    display an alert
  }else{
    redirect to next page
  }
}
 This loop or the logic I'm using are flawed (I'm pretty sure), what I want to do is test all the elements in the array against a single variable and take the next action accordingly. I hope this makes some sense to you guys, any help would be appreciated. Thanks, JC
@CODE:var allSelected = $("select option:selected");
var totalSelected = $("select option:selected").length; for(var i = 0; i < totalSelected; i++){
  var eachOption = $(allSelected[i]).val();
  var defaultValue = 0;
  if(eachOption == defaultValue){
    ...redirect to another page
  }else if(eachOption > defaultValue){
    ... I display an alert
  }
} var randomValue = 25;  
for(randomValue in allSelected){
  var found = true;
  var notFound = false
