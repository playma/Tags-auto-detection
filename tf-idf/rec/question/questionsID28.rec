@CONTENT:You'll have to admit, to a newbie to rails and databases, the official explanation on rubyonrails.org makes all four of these tasks sound exactly the same. Quote: rake db:test:clone  Recreate the test database from
                    the current environment¡¦s database schema

rake db:test:clone_structure    Recreate the test database from the
                                development structure

rake db:test:load   Recreate the test database from the current schema.rb

rake db:test:prepare    Check for pending migrations and load the test schema
 I don't even know the difference between structure and schema. And what's the difference between loading the current environment's schema and just loading schema.rb? Just how similar (or different) are these tasks?
@CODE:rake db:test:clone  Recreate the test database from

@TITLE:Why is there no Tree<T> class in .NET?
@CONTENT:The base class library in .NET has some excellent data structures for collections (List, Queue, Stack, Dictionary), but oddly enough it does not contain any data structures for binary trees. This is a terribly useful structure for certain algorithms, such as those that take advantage of different traversal paths. I'm looking for a correctly written, free implementation. Am I simply blind, and not finding it... is it buried somewhere in the BCL? If not, can someone recommend a free or open-source C#/.NET library for binary trees? Preferably one that employs generics. EDIT: To clarify what I'm looking for. I'm not interested in ordered dictionary collections that internally use a tree. I'm actually interested in a binary tree - one that exposes its structure so that you can do things like extract subtrees, or perform post-fix traversal on the nodes. Ideally such a class could be extended to provide the behaviors of specialized trees (ie. Red/Black, AVL, Balanced, etc).

@TITLE:Issue with adding common code as git submodule: ¡§already exists in the index¡¨
@CONTENT:I'm new to git and would appreciate help with adding submodules. I've received two projects sharing some common code. The shared code was just copied into the two projects. I created a separate git repo for the common code and removed it from the projects with the plan to add it as a git submodule. I used the path option of git submodule add to specify the folder: git submodule add url_to_repo projectfolder
 but then got the error: 'projectfolder' already exists in the index"
 This is the desired structure of my repository: repo
|-- projectfolder
    |-- folder with common code
 It is possible to add the git submodule directly in the repo or into a new folder there, but not in the projectfolder. The problem is that it really need to be in the projectfolder.. What can I do about this and what have I misunderstood about the path option of git submodule add?

@CONTENT:As many of us know (and many, many more don't), C++ is currently undergoing final drafting for the next revision of the International Standard, expected to be published in about 2 years. Drafts and papers are currently available from the committee website. All sorts of new features are being added, the biggest being concepts and lambdas. There is a very comprehensive Wikipedia article with many of the new features. GCC 4.3 and later implement some C++0x features. As far as new features go, I really like type traits (and the appropriate concepts), but my definite leader is variadic templates. Until 0x, long template lists have involved Boost Preprocessor usually, and are very unpleasant to write. This makes things a lot easier and allows C++0x templates to be treated like a perfectly functional language using variadic templates. I've already written some very cool code with them already, and I can't wait to use them more often! So what features are you most eagerly anticipating?

@LINK:/questions/11163436/are-there-any-real-alternatives-to-restructuredtext-for-python-documentation
@TITLE:Are there any real alternatives to reStructuredText for Python documentation?
@CONTENT:I'm starting an open source Python project shortly and I'm trying to decide in advance how to write my docstrings. The obvious answer would be using reStructuredText and Sphinx with autodoc, because I really like the idea of simply properly documenting my code in my docstrings then have Sphinx automatically construct an API doc for me. The problem is the reStructuredText syntax it uses - I think it's completely unreadable before it's rendered. For instance: 
:param path: The path of the file to wrap
:type path: str
:param field_storage: The :class:`FileStorage` instance to wrap
:type field_storage: FileStorage
:param temporary: Whether or not to delete the file when the File instance
    is destructed
:type temporary: bool
 You have to really slow down and take a minute to make any sense out of that syntactic jumble. I like much more the Google way (Google Python Style Guide), which counterpart to the above looks like this: 
Args:
    path (str): The path of the file to wrap
    field_storage (FileStorage): The FileStorage instance to wrap
    temporary (bool): Whether or not to delete the file when the File
        instance is destructed
 Way nicer! But of course, Sphinx will have none of that and renders all the text after "Args:" in one long line. So to summarize - before I go and defile my code base with this reStructuredText syntax I would like to know if there are any real alternatives to using it and Sphinx, short of just writing my own API doc. For instance, is there an extension for Sphinx that handles Google Style Guide's docstring style?

topMenuView.clipsToBounds = YES;
UIToolbar *topMenuViewBar = [[UIToolbar alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, -4, self.view.frame.size.width, TOP_BAR_ORIG_HEIGHT + 4)];
topMenuViewBar.barStyle = UIBarStyleDefault;
topMenuViewBar.barTintColor = [BSFunctions getColorFromHex:@"1ea6ff"];
const CGFloat statusBarHeight = 20;

UIView *underlayView = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, -statusBarHeight, topMenuViewBar.frame.size.width, topMenuViewBar.frame.size.height + statusBarHeight)];

 A few questions: Does this structure make sense? What are the best practises when structuring this code? (I am coming from C# and java, and there it is easier in a sense) I don't like the fact that I have to list all the files from the src folder in the test/CMakeLists.txt file. If this was a library project, I would just link the library. Is there a way to avoid listing all the cpp files from the other project? What are the lines enable_testing() and add_test(MyTest test) doing? I haven't seen any effect. How can I run the tests from CMake (or CTest)? So far I just ran cmake . in the root folder, but his created a mess with temporary files everywhere. How can I get the compilation results in a reasonable structure?

@TITLE:How to Practice Unix Programming in C?
@CONTENT:After five years of professional Java (and to a lesser extent, Python) programming and slowly feeling my CS education slip away, I decided I wanted to broaden my horizons / general usefulness to the world and do something that feels more (to me) like I really have an influence over the machine. I chose to learn C and Unix programming since I feel like that is where many of the most interesting problems are. My end goal is to be able to do this professionally, if for no other reason than the fact that I have to spend 40-50 hours per week on work that pays the bills, so it may as well also be the type of coding I want to get better at. Of course, you don't get hired to do things you haven't dont before, so for now I am ramping up on my own. To this end, I started with K&R, which was a great resource in part due to the exercises spread throughout each chapter. After that I moved on to Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective, followed by ten chapters of Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment. When I am done with this book, I will read Unix Network Programming. What I'm missing in the Stevens books is the lack of programming problems; they mainly document functionality and provide examples, with a few end-of-chapter questions following. I feel that I would benefit much more from being challenged to use the knowledge in each chapter ala K&R. I could write some test program for each function, but this is a less desirable method as (1) I would probably be less motivated than if I were rising to some external challenge, and (2) I will naturally only think to use the function in the ways that have already occurred to me. So, I'd like to get some recommendations on how to practice. Obviously, my first choice would be to find some resource that has Unix programming challenges. I have also considered finding and attempting to contribute to some open source C project, but this is a bit daunting as there would be some overhead in learning to use the software, then learning the codebase. The only open-source C project I can think of that I use regularly is Python, and I'm not sure how easy that would be to get started on. That said, I'm open to all kinds of suggestions as there are likely things I haven't even thought of.

@CONTENT:I have multiple SVGs, some of them rather large (11MB) and they're created from a PDF using pdf2svg. The problem is, that the SVG is too big, takes long time to open, and is unnecessarily complex. It contains mostly text and some images (think newspaper), and the text is split into little chunks of characters, not even words. I need to optimize it, first to reduce size, and also to reduce the amount of elements to make it load faster. The only thing I thought of so far is looking at characters which are at one line, and join them in a single <tspan>. This should reduce the amount of text elements by quite a significant margin, because it looks like it's mostly groups of 1-5 letters. But I am looking for some more things I can do to the SVG to reduce the size. There's also a main font, which is used for about 95% of the text, but as it is right now, all of the text is defined as glyphs (rendered shapes). Is it possible to just embed the font, so the text is rendered as text, and not as shapes? Also if you know of any better library for converting PDFs to SVG, I'd appreciate any input. The only requirement is that it the SVG output should look exactly the same as the PDF. I'd also like to note that speed isn't really important. It doesn't matter how long the conversion takes, as long as it produces the required result.

@CONTENT:I have a very simple HTML page with this META tag for the iPhone: <meta name="viewport" content="height=device-height,width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,user-scalable=no" />
 Using the iPhone Safari, when the page loads in portrait mode it looks fine and the width fits the screen.

I want the iPhone to set it back to the right width automatically, just like it did for the landscape mode. I don't think this should involve orientation listeners because it is all done automatically and I don't have any special styling for the different modes. Why doesn't the iPhone resize the web page back in portrait mode? How do I fix this? UPDATE I managed to get the iPhone to auto resize down but with a strange phenomenon of doing it only after an even number of rotations... Very very strange. I use this META tag: <meta name="viewport" content="height=device-height, width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no" />
 Here's what I have to do to get it auto resized: 1. On load in portrait -> looks good. 2. Rotate to landscape -> resized to fit screen. 3. Rotate back to portrait -> no resize back. 4. Rotate to landscape -> still in size for landscape. 5. Rotate to portrait -> resized down to fit portrait screen. Can someone explain this behavior?? I still want to know how to fix this and appreciate any assistance. Thanks! Tom.

@TITLE:Idiomatic construction to check whether a collection is ordered
@CONTENT:With the intention of learning and further to this question, I've remained curious of the idiomatic alternatives to explicit recursion for an algorithm that checks whether a list (or collection) is ordered. (I'm keeping things simple here by using an operator to compare and Int as type; I'd like to look at the algorithm before delving into the generics of it) The basic recursive version would be (by @Luigi Plinge): def isOrdered(l:List[Int]): Boolean = l match {
  case Nil => true
  case x :: Nil => true
  case x :: xs => x <= xs.head && isOrdered(xs)
}
 A poor performing idiomatic way would be: def isOrdered(l: List[Int]) = l == l.sorted
 An alternative algorithm using fold: def isOrdered(l: List[Int]) =
  l.foldLeft((true, None:Option[Int]))((x,y) =>
    (x._1 && x._2.map(_ <= y).getOrElse(true), Some(y)))._1
 It has the drawback that it will compare for all n elements of the list even if it could stop earlier after finding the first out-of-order element. Is there a way to "stop" fold and therefore making this a better solution? Any other (elegant) alternatives?
@CODE:def isOrdered(l:List[Int]): Boolean = l match {
  case Nil => true
  case x :: Nil => true
  case x :: xs => x <= xs.head && isOrdered(xs)
} def isOrdered(l: List[Int]) = l == l.sorted def isOrdered(l: List[Int]) =
  l.foldLeft((true, None:Option[Int]))((x,y) =>

@TITLE:The real (or hidden) difference/s between Twitter bootstrap and Angular.js
@CONTENT:I've just been comparing these 2 frontend frameworks and from what I can tell, they seem to do the exact same thing in terms of providing the dev with an HTML, CSS and JS frontend. Boostrap: Sleek, intuitive, and powerful front-end framework for faster and easier web development. (over 53 000 starred on GitHub) Angular.js: AngularJS is a structural framework for dynamic web apps. (12 000 starred on GitHub) The ratings mean nothing, but I just thought I'd put it in there to show that this isn't some 'quickie' question that I didn't research. From what I've understood of Angular through wikipedia, it aims to completely separate the frontend design/layout/ui from the backend - where the database is, the web server is and where the business logic happens. From what I understand of bootstrap (with its JS) you can achieve this exact same thing. The angular site mentions: Other frameworks deal with HTML¡¦s shortcomings by either abstracting away HTML, CSS, and/or JavaScript or by providing an imperative way for manipulating the DOM. Neither of these address the root problem that HTML was not designed for dynamic views. Now I'm not sure if they're taking potshots at something like backbone or maybe even bootstrap (and if you get offended easily, then ignore the potshots comment), but to me, I just can't make out what real and true differences there are between the 2. Maybe there's some advanced info about the DOM or some other minute/tiny aspect/s of JS or HTML that make the 2 different, but I just don't see it. PS. No SOF question like this exists, nor do any blogs speak about it (unless it is ranked very low or I'm asking the wrong way). I also discovered that some people are working on porting over aspects of bootstrap to angular. Edit: Thinking about it, I realized that bootstrap offers that resizing option for different screen views, I'm not sure if angular does. If not, is that the only difference?

@LINK:/questions/10131856/push-notification-handling
@TITLE:push notification handling
@CONTENT:I'm reading Apple's docs on Handling Local and Remote Notifications and it looks to me to have conflicting statements. Can someone clear up these confusion points? Let's speak strictly of remote notification (versus local) for now. The docs say that if the action button on the notification is pressed, it calls application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions and passes in the notification payload. Later it says if the app is running in the foreground, it delivers the notification via application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:. This implies to me that when the app is backgrounded or not running, then application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions is called. Otherwise, application:didReceiveRemoteNotification: is called. Later, there is an iOS Note saying the following: "iOS Note: In iOS, you can determine whether an application is launched as a result of the user tapping the action button or whether the notification was delivered to the already-running application by examining the application state. In the delegate¡¦s implementation of the application:didReceiveRemoteNotification: or application:didReceiveLocalNotification: method, get the value of the applicationState property and evaluate it. If the value is UIApplicationStateInactive, the user tapped the action button; if the value is UIApplicationStateActive, the application was frontmost when it received the notification." This implies to me that application:didReceiveRemoteNotification: is called both when the app is already foregrounded and if the user presses the action button (or slides the action slider in iOS 5) to foreground/launch the app. The source of my confusion might be with the first portion where the docs imply the notification payload is sent with the application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: method or with a misunderstanding of what a "running" application is (is a backgrounded app considered "running"?). The documentation for application:didReceiveRemoteNotification: states it is called for "running" applications. So, to summarize, could I get clarification on: 1) Is application:didReceiveRemoteNotification: always called when the app is foregrounded or when the user selects to "act" on the notification? If not, how do we make sense of the iOS Note on determining the Application State being active or inactive? 2) Is a backgrounded app "running", at least in the sense of the docs claiming application:didReceiveRemoteNotification is called for running apps? 3) For completion, is a backgrounded app UIApplicationStateInactive or Active?

When I use mogenerator to generate/update my machine and human files, the machine files for the entity containing this attribute always type the attribute to NSObject. In order for Core Data to use my custom value transformer, this type needs to be the type the transformer understands. Right now, I manually do this in the human file by redefining the property with the proper type. This does the job and gets the transformer working. However, I end up with several compile warnings regarding redefinition of the attribute. One of the more recent releases of mogenerator specified in the release notes that transformable attributes are now supported. However, I haven't found any example syntax to enable this feature.

My problem is that I am getting a warning that says *** WARNING: Unable to verify checksum for C:\TheProgram\SomeSubfolder\AnotherSubfolder\MyDll.dll This warning I think is the reason why I am getting the following type of messages in the call stack: MyDll!AClass::AFunction+SomeHexAddress My file structure looks something like this: The exe: C:\TheProgram\program.exe The calling dll: C\TheProgram\SomeSubfolder\caller.??? My DLL that I want to debug: C:\TheProgram\SomeSubfolder\AnotherSubfolder\MyDll.dll Note: I set Symbol File path and the Source file path to where the debug DLL was generated, in my workspace on a different drive from the exe.. But I did copy the pdb + map files and put it on the dll that I wanted to debug..

@TITLE:Testing $resource services in AngularJS
@CONTENT:I am trying to begin writing unit tests for my angular application and hit a stopping block pretty quick as I am unsure of how exactly to mock my service in a testable way. Is there a way to mock the REST call otherwise it would seem like I need to mirror everything within my service in my tests which doesn't seem right to me, but I am rather new to test writing so maybe this is how it is supposed to be accomplished. Any help would be greatly appreciated. My service is as follows: angular.module('resources.users', ['ngResource']).
    factory('User', function($resource) {
var resource = $resource('/api/index.php/users/:username', {}, {
    'update': {method: 'PUT'}

resource.getUser = function(username, successCb) {
    return resource.query(
         {username: username}, 
          successCb
    );
};

return resource;
});
 My test consists thus far of: describe('User', function() {
var mockUserResource;
beforeEach(module('resources.users'));
beforeEach(function() {
    mockUserResource = sinon.stub({
        getUser: function(username) {

@TITLE:Hacking and exploiting - How do you deal with any security holes you find?
@CONTENT:Today online security is a very important factor. Many businesses are completely based online, and there is tons of sensitive data available to check out only by using your web browser. Seeking knowledge to secure my own applications I've found that I'm often testing others applications for exploits and security holes, maybe just for curiosity. As my knowledge on this field has expanded by testing on own applications, reading zero day exploits and by reading the book The Web Application Hacker's Handbook: Discovering and Exploiting Security Flaws, I've come to realize that a majority of online web applications are really exposed to a lot of security holes. So what do you do? I'm in no interest of destroying or ruining anything, but my biggest "break through" on hacking I decided to alert the administrators of the page. My inquiry was promptly ignored, and the security hole has yet not been fixed. Why wouldn't they wanna fix it? How long will it be before someone with bad intentions break inn and choose to destroy everything? I wonder why there's not more focus on this these days, and I would think there would be plenty of business opportunities in actually offering to test web applications for security flaws. Is it just me who have a too big curiosity or is there anyone else out there who experience the same? It is punishable by law in Norway to actually try break into a web page, even if you just check the source code and find the "hidden password" there, use it for login, you're already breaking the law.

@CONTENT:How do we model classic many-to-many relationships with CQRS/DDD? I know that both DDD and CQRS implementations and solutions tend to be domain-specific, so it may be difficult to come up with a general answer to this question. However, let's assume we have the familiar relationship between Book and Author. This is a classic many-to-many relationship. To me, it seems most natural that Book and Author are two different Entities that each belong in their own Aggregate Root. Thus, explicitly modeling the many-to-many relationship between them is not the way to go. How do we model an AddBookCommand? We want to be able to add a book to our library, and also somehow state that a particular Author wrote this Book. How do we model (and persist) such a relationship? Neither Book nor Author seem like good candidates for Value Objects...

So I've been reading about how cool and powerful TDD is in .NET, Java with all the available frameworks. I've even tested NUnit before and I kind of like it. You can write the test once and use it pretty much forever. I was wondering if there is an easy way to implement TDD for our case too with Perl? What I want to do is to have some automated way to manage my unit test, and to be able to easily run the unit test with just one click or something. Edit I've found this chapter on TDD to be very useful as well as helping me design the test, and best of all it's free :) And if you can afford it then get this book too: Perl Testing: a developer's notebook. It's really good in the sense that it break down into all the potential stuff that we need to do and it's in a tutorial based format. Added a Perl testing reference card here. So now I'm eager to look for some good resources, .pm, open source Perl projects which I can use to better learn how to write unit tests, etc. Can anyone recommend some here?

@LINK:/questions/27968909/how-to-get-cabal-and-nix-work-together
@TITLE:How to get cabal and nix work together
@CONTENT:As far as I understood, NIX is altnertative for cabal sandbox. I (finally) manage to install NIX but I still don't understand how it can replace a sanbox. I understand you don't need cabal using NIX and the wrapped version of GHC, however if you want to publish a package you'll need at some point to package it using cabal. Therefore you need to be able to write and test your cabal configuration within NIX. How do you do that ? Ideally, I would like an environment similar to cabal sandbox but "contained" within NIX, is that possible ? (In fact what I really would like is the equivalent of nested sandboxes as I usuall work on a project made of multiple packages). Update about my current workflow At the moment I work on 2 or 3 independants projects (P1,P2,P3) which are each composed of 2 or 3 cabal modules/packages , lets say for P1 : L11,L12 (libraries) and E11 (executlables ).E11 depends on L12 which depends on L11. I mainly split the executables from the library because they are private and kept on a private git repo. In theory,each project could have this own sandbox (shared between its submodules). I tried that (having a common sandbox for L11 L12 and E11) but it's quickly annoying because , if you modifiy L11, you can't rebuild it because E11 depends on it, so I have to uninstall E11 first in order to recompile L11. It might be no exactly the case but I encounter similar problem. This would be fine if I was occasiannally modifying L11, but in practice, I modified it more that E11. As the shared sandbox doesn't really work, I went back to the one sandbox for every package solution. It's working but is less than ideal. The main problem is if I modify L11, I need to compile it twice (once in L11, and then again in E11). Also, each time I'm starting a new sandbox, as everybody knows, I need to wait a while to get everything package downloaded and recompiled. So by using Nix, I'm hopping to be able to set up separate cabal "environments" per project, which solves all the issue aboves. Hope this is clearer

I know some PHP, MySQL, c/c++, Java, Bash scripting, Visual Basic 6, VBScripting, Perl, JavaScript. Can anyone provide an example of metamorphic code in any of these languages. I would like to see a working example, even where the output of the program is just "Hello World", to understand through example how this is happening (I am struggling to theorise how these techniques can be achieved through mental thought alone). Any language would do really, those are just preferred ones. Additionally, searching the Internet has only returned a limited number of examples in c/c++ (not even complete working examples, more partial snippets of code), is that because the other languages I have suggested aren't low level enough to have the power/flexibility required to make metamorphic code?

@TITLE:What is the most efficient way to select a set of variable names from an R data.frame?
@CONTENT:The problem: I often need to select a set of variables from a data.frame in R. My research is in the social and behavioural sciences, and it is quite common to have a data.frame with several hundreds of variables (e.g., there'll be item level information for a range of survey questions, demographic items, performance measures, etc., etc.). As part of analyses, I'll often want to select a subset of variables. For example, I might want get: descriptive statistics for a set of variables correlation matrix on a set of variables factor analysis on a set of variables predictors in a linear model Now, I know that there are many ways to write the code to select a subset of variables. Quick-r has a nice overview of common ways of extracting variable subsets from a data.frame. e.g., myvars <- c("v1", "v2", "v3")
newdata <- mydata[myvars]
 However, I'm interested in the efficiency of this process, particularly where you might need to extract 20 or so variables from a data.frame. The naming convention of variables is often not intuitive, especially where you've inherited a dataset from someone else, so you might be left wondering, was the variable Gender, gender, sex, GENDER, gender1, etc. Multiply this by 20 variables that need to be extracted, and the task of memorising variable names becomes more complicated than it needs to be. Concrete example To make the following discussion concrete, I'll use the bfi data.frame in the psych package. library(psych)
data(bfi)
df <- bfi
head(df, 1)
      A1 A2 A3 A4 A5 C1 C2 C3 C4 C5 E1 E2 E3 E4 E5 N1 N2 N3 N4 N5 O1 O2 O3 O4
61617  2  4  3  4  4  2  3  3  4  4  3  3  3  4  4  3  4  2  2  3  3  6  3  4
      O5 gender education age
61617  3      1        NA  16
 How can I efficiently select an arbitrary set of variables, which for concreteness, I'll choose A1, A2, A3, A5, C2, C3, C5, E2, E3, gender, education, age? My current strategy I currently have a range of strategies that I use. Of course sometimes I can exploit things like the numeric position of the variables or the naming convention and use either grep to select or paste to construct. But sometimes I need a more general solution. I've used the following over the while: 1. names(df) In the early days, I used to call names(df), copy the quoted variable names and then edit until I have what I want. 2. Use a database Sometimes I'll have a separate data.frame that stores each variable as a row, and has columns for variable names, variable labels, and it has a column which indicates whether the variable should be retained for a particular analysis. I can then filter on that include variable and extract a vector of variable names. I find this particularly useful when I'm developing a psychological test and for various iterations I want to include or exclude certain items. 3. dput(names(df)) As Hadley Wickham once pointed out to me dput is a good option; e.g., dput(names(df)) is better than names(df) in that it outputs a list that is already in the c("var1", "var2", ...) format: dput(names(df))
c("A1", "A2", "A3", "A4", "A5", "C1", "C2", "C3", "C4", "C5", 
"E1", "E2", "E3", "E4", "E5", "N1", "N2", "N3", "N4", "N5", "O1", 
"O2", "O3", "O4", "O5", "gender", "education", "age")
 this can then be copied into the script and edited. But can it be more efficient I guess dput is a pretty good variable selection strategy. The efficiency of the process largely depends on how proficient you are in copying the text into your script and then editing the list of names down to those desired. However, I still remember the efficiency of GUI based systems of variable selection. For example, in SPSS when you interact with a dialogue box you can point and click with the mouse the variables you want from the dataset. You can shift-click to select a range of variables, you can hold shift and press the down key to select one or more variables, and so on. And then you can press Paste and the command with extracted variable names is pasted into your script editor. So, finally the core question Is there a simple no frills GUI device that permits the selection of variables from a data.frame (e.g., something like guiselect(df) opens a gui window for variable selection), and returns a vector of variable names selected c("var1", "var2", ...)? Is dput the best general option for selecting a set of variable names in R? Or is there a better way?

 Hers's the original codepen I'm working from. `updated fiddle with image outside function update(): It currently seems to actually fill the cells as well as applying it as a background image. is there any way to stop it becoming a background image and only apply it to fill the grid? I've tried this: ctx.fillStyle = ptrn; and removing line 260: ctx.strokeStyle = ptrn; but it seems to remove the background image just displaying it as a black grid... thank you again for the patience

@CONTENT:I've been looking at using Redis Pub/Sub as a replacement to RabbitMQ. From my understanding Redis's pub/sub holds a persistent connection to each of the subscribers, and if the connection is terminated, all future messages will be lost and dropped on the floor. One possible solution is to use a list (and blocking wait) to store all the message and pub/sub as just a notification mechanism. I think this gets me most of the way there, but I still have some concerns about the failure cases. what happens when a subscriber dies, and comes back online, how should it process all it's pending messages? when a malformed message comes though the system, how do you handle those exceptions? DeadLetter Queue? is there a standard practice to implementing a retry policy?

@TITLE:How to implement segment trees with lazy propagation?
@CONTENT:I have searched on internet about implementation of Segment trees but found nothing when it came to lazy propagation. There were some previous questions on stack overflow but they were focused on solving some particular problems of SPOJ. Though I think this is the best explanation of segment trees with pseudocode but I need to implement it with lazy propagation. I found following links : http://community.topcoder.com/tc?module=Static&d1=tutorials&d2=lowestCommonAncestor#Segment_Trees In addition to the above link, some blogs were also there but they all were giving reference to the same thread. Example An example of the application of this data structure would be something like, say I have been given a range of numbers from 1 to n. Now I perform some operations like adding some constant number to a particular range or subtracting some constant number from a particular range. After performing operations I'm supposed to tell the minimum and maximum number in the given number. An obvious solution would be to perform addition or subtraction to each number in the given range one by one. But this can't be feasible in a situation in which no of operations performed are large. A better approach would be using Segment Trees with lazy propagation technique. It says instead of performing the update operation on each number individually, just keep track of all the operations until all operations are done. Then finally perform update operation to get the minimum and maximum number in the range. Example with real data Suppose I have given the range [1,10] which means numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. Now suppose I perform an operation which decreases the numbers in the range [3,6] by 4 ,so now numbers will look like 1,2,-1,0,1,2,7,8,9,10. Now I perform another operation which increases the numbers in the range [5,9] by 1, so the number will now look like 1,2,-1,0,2,3,8,9,10,10. Now if I ask you to tell me the maximum and minimum number then the answer will be : Maximum = 10

Minimum = -1
 This is just a simple example.The actual problem might contain thousands of such addition/subtraction operations.I hope it's clear now. This is what I have understood so far but I guess there is no unified link on Internet which explains the concept and implementation in a better way. Can anyone give some good explanation including pseudocode for lazy propagation in segment trees? Thanks.

@LINK:/questions/9906965/session-expire-design-pattern
@TITLE:Session expire design pattern
@CONTENT:I have often had to cope with sessions / access tokens expiring in an iOS app design and have never really quite found a design that I am 100% comfortable with, so I am asking this here to see if anyone can come up with a better design than I currently use. The problem You have an app that logs in with a username and password. The server returns an access token that should be used for future requests to authenticate that user. At some point in the future (unknown time) the server will expire that token and any request sent with that token will return an authentication failure. After failure due to the session expiring, the app should re-login using the original credentials and get back a fresh access token. It can then retry the original request. Example So imagine you have an API to get a list of news articles that requires authentication. The flow might go like this: User logs in and app receives token. View controller refreshes list of news articles. API request is made with token attached. API request successful and view is updated with new articles. App is closed and some time passes. App is opened at which point the view controller wants to refresh the list of news articles. API request is made with token attached. API request is unsuccessful because token has expired. View controller requests a refresh of the token and waits patiently. Once token has been refreshed, API request is retried. Now imagine that this is done from more than one place in the app. How I currently solve it What I usually do is store the credentials in NSUserDefaults (if I am not concerned with security of those credentials - obviously better to be using the keychain) and then have a method on a global manager object (singleton) which refreshes the login using these credentials when I notice that the session has expired. This global manager fires off notifications when the login state changes so that other parts of the app can know when they should retry a request after failure due to the session expiring. What I don't feel is right Well, I just never have liked the state machine handling of the manager object. Every place that performs a request needs to save some state to know that a login refresh is going on and to retry the request after the login has been refreshed. There's also the problem of what to do if the refresh fails because the password is wrong now (the user changed it maybe) - you probably don't want to log out completely and destroy all user state of the app, because you might just be able to ask for the new password and carry on as before. But the global manager doesn't really relate to UI so it's hard to it to handle the UI of asking for the new login. What I want to know in answers I understand that this question is particularly vague and conceptual (I still think it's OK to be on StackOverflow though?) but I'd really just like to know how other people solve this kind of problem. Just an explanation of how you go about handling the session expiration, retrying the failed requests from all over the app and asking the user for new credentials if refreshing didn't work. I guess the crux of the whole thing is this question: Where to put the retry logic of requests that failed due to session expiring. I see these places are options: At the view controller level (i.e. keep a flag to say we need to retry the last request once login refresh has finished). At the API request level (i.e. encapsulate the API request in an object that knows to retry after the login has been refreshed). At the global login manager level (i.e. perhaps take a block in when refreshLogin is called that is executed once the login has been refreshed).

@TITLE:C++11: How do I implement convenient logging without a Singleton?
@CONTENT:My current implementation, simplified: #include <string>
#include <memory>

class Log
{
  public:
    ~Log() {
      // closing file-descriptors, etc...
    }
    static void LogMsg( const std::string& msg )
    {

    }
  private:
    Log() { }
    void logMsg( const std::string& msg ) {
      // do work
    }
};
 In general, I am satisfied with this implementation because: lazy instantiation means I don't pay unless I use it use of unique_ptr means automatic cleanup so valgrind is happy relatively simple, easy-to-understand implementation However, the negatives are: singletons aren't conducive to unit-testing dissonance in the back of my mind for introducing a pseudo-global (a bit of a code smell) So here are my questions directed towards those developers who are successful in exorcising all singletons from their C++ code: What kind of non-Singleton implementation do you use for application-wide logging? Is the interface as simple and accessible as a Log::LogMsg() call above? I want to avoid passing a Log instance all over my code, if at all possible - note: I am asking because, I, too, want to exorcise all Singletons from my code if there is a good, reasonable alternative.

#include <memory>

@CONTENT:Note bene: I realize this is an immensely complicated question with about a million levels of nuance that I'm trying to reduce to a single number... I'm about to undertake a large video encoding project using H.264 encoding. We are trying to create multiple bitrate profiles in order to accommodate streaming across internet connections, processors, devices, etc. Generally speaking, what kind of compression ratio should I be expecting to see (while staying within a reasonable level of quality)? For example, a 640x360 (16:9) pixel video file @ 24 frames per second and 16-bit color should yield an uncompressed file that is approximately 33 MB/s. I've been told that, for that file, 500 Kbits/second (or 62 KB/s) is not an unreasonable video bitrate. That seems insane - more than 530:1 compression? That's 99.8% compression. Is my math wrong? I'm just looking for a rough outer guide for quality, like "more than 500x compression is crazy" or "less than 400x is a waste of bandwidth". I've looked everywhere, and nothing gives me any kind of expected compression...

@CONTENT:Why is a Func<> created from an Expression<Func<>> via .Compile() considerably slower than just using a Func<> declared directly ? I just changed from using a Func<IInterface, object> declared directly to one created from an Expression<Func<IInterface, object>> in an app i am working on and i noticed that the performance went down. I have just done a little test, and the Func<> created from an Expression takes "almost" double the time of an Func<> declared directly.

int counter1 = 0;

Stopwatch s1 = new Stopwatch();
s1.Start();
for (int i = 0; i < 300000000; i++)
{
 counter1 += test1(i).Value;
}
s1.Stop();
var result1 = s1.Elapsed;



// Expression . Compile()

@TITLE:How can I send authorization information back to my client app when using AngularJS, WebAPI 2 and Oauth 2?
@CONTENT:I have a AngularJS client application that uses javascript (not coffeescript or typescript) Oauth2 to authenticate against a WebAPI 2 application using the latest Identity 2. All the software in my application is the very latest and is based on this example. My client browser targets are IE9 and above. Note that I made some minor changes from the example above in that I do not urlencode all of the data sent to the server using the transform. Instead I urlencode only in the authenticate method below: user.authenticate = function (userName, password, rememberMe, successCallback, errorCallback) {
    var config = {
        method: 'POST',
        url: '/Token',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' },
        data: 'grant_type=password&username=' + encodeURIComponent(userName) + '&password=' + encodeURIComponent(password),
    };
 I am developing with VS2013 Update 2 and on the server, I use C#, the latest Entity Framework and SQL Server 2012. To login my client calls a /Token method to the WebAPI and passes the userid and password. The WebAPI then responds with a token to the client which I store. With each request to the WebAPI the token is sent back and authenticated: $http.defaults.headers.common.Authorization = 'Bearer ' + user.data.bearerToken;
 This works very well so far but as it stands the application is unable to tell the difference between users that have different roles assigned to them. Some of the WebAPI methods can only be executed by users who have a certain role. I would like to adjust the menus of my front-end AngularJS application so that only if the user has this role then the appropriate links will appear visible. I do realize that this would not stop a user from checking the HTML and posting but I am not concerned about this as I will still have method decoration to limit the ability of users not in a role to perform actions. Can someone give me an example of how I can do this using just the suite of products mentioned above that I mention in the question plus JavaScript Web Tokens if they help make bring the solution up to date. From what I understand roles are handled by claims but I do not understand how to add these and send them back to the client with tokens. I have done a lot of research on the internet but I've not been able to find any good examples as I think most of this is very new and not many people have had the chance to explore how a SPA can use these very latest software components. When answering this question please note that I am not looking for an answer that can tell the community how to set up roles on the server or an answer that explains about how important it is to provide role checks on the server. I think almost everyone is aware of this. What I really think will be of use is some very detailed technical suggestions with sample code and an explanation. To keep the answer focused it would probably be of help to everyone if answers that do not meet this need are not posted as suggested answers. Thank you in advance.

@TITLE:Sending custom PyQt signals?
@CONTENT:I'm practicing PyQt and (Q)threads by making a simple Twitter client. I have two Qthreads. Main/GUI thread. Twitter fetch thread - fetches data from Twitter every X minutes. So, every X minutes my Twitter thread downloads a new set of status updates (a Python list). I want to hand this list over to the Main/GUI thread, so that it can update the window with these statuses. I'm assuming that I should be using the signal / slot system to transfer the "statuses" Python list from the Twitter thread, to the Main/GUI thread. So, my question is twofold: How do I send the statuses from the Twitter thread? How do I receive them in the Main/GUI thread? As far as I can tell, PyQt can by default only send PyQt-objects via signals / slots. I think I'm supposed to somehow register a custom signal which I can then send, but the documentation on this that I've found is very unclear to a newbie like me. I have a PyQt book on order, but it won't arrive in another week, and I don't want to wait until then. :-) I'm using PyQt 4.6-1 on Ubuntu Update: This is an excert from the code that doesn't work. First, I try to "connect" the signal ("newStatuses", a name I just made up) to the function self.update_tweet_list in the Main/GUI thread: QtCore.QObject.connect(self.twit_in,
                       QtCore.SIGNAL("newStatuses (statuses)"),
                       self.update_tweet_list)
 Then, in the Twitter thread, I do this: self.emit(SIGNAL("newStatuses (statuses)"), statuses)
 When this line is called, I get the following message: QObject::connect: Cannot queue arguments of type 'statuses'
(Make sure 'statuses' is registered using qRegisterMetaType().)
 I did a search for qRegisterMetaType() but I didn't find anything relating to Python that I could understand.
@CODE:QtCore.QObject.connect(self.twit_in,
                       QtCore.SIGNAL("newStatuses (statuses)"),
                       self.update_tweet_list) self.emit(SIGNAL("newStatuses (statuses)"), statuses) QObject::connect: Cannot queue arguments of type 'statuses'
(Make sure 'statuses' is registered using qRegisterMetaType().)

@TITLE:Packing, caching, JS and CSS in PHP that differentiate between development and production environment
@CONTENT:I am trying to make development easy and have highly optimized output in production. The goals of what I am trying to do is: Make production pages fast! I would like that the Google Page Speed and YSlow return the best scores. This means: Combine and compress JS files and CSS and position the group in the right place (bottom or top of the page) in the HTML. For .js Google Closure seems the best choice. .JS and .CSS are smartly cached but be sure that they get reloaded when of the .JS or CSS componet is updated. 301 File not changed etc. Cache type: I think cache on disk is fine. Consider APC and Memcache or Redis if they significantly improve speed. Capable to specify and use lazy load of .JS when necessary or at least not to block the page rendering. (Optional) Compress the HTML too. Make website development easy: Use short command in the .php file when you want to include .js or .css and compress them only in the production environment Use syntax like pack_js(['first.js', 'second.js' 'third.js']) and pack_css(['first.less', 'second.less' 'third.css'], true) It is easy to configure develpment or production environment. Maybe just a call to SetDebug(true or false). Default production Easy to set up cache folders and source folders Use of LESS to make CSS development sucks less. Automatically compile LESS files in CSS in production but use of LESS.js in development so that each time you change the .less file in development it is updated on the server. (optional) In development it includes a JS and a LESS console similar to the shell at https://www.squarefree.com/bookmarklets/webdevel.html Note: it is OK to use Apachee modules and .htaccess files if they significantly speed up the process. But it should be able to set them up quicky, ideally with just a setup command. Is there something that do this? Or what are the best resources to start? I would prefer a solution that consists of a PHP script (eventually few .php files, .htaccess and compressing executables) that compresses the .JS with the Google Closure Compiler and compress/compile the CSS/LESS files stripping out useless comments and white spaces. A special cookie could be used on production server to output the development version. I would like to have: A php function usable like this: pack_js(['first.js', 'second.js', 'third.js']) that write something like: On developments servers: <script type="text/javascript" src="static/js/first.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="static/js/second.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="static/js/third.js"></script>
 On production servers (if the special cookie is not present): <script type="text/javascript" src="cache/12a42323bfe339ea9w.js"></script>
 Another function: pack_css(['first.less', 'second.less', 'third.css'], true) that write something like: On developments servers: <link rel="stylesheet/less" href="/static/css/first.less" type="text/css" />
<link rel="stylesheet/less" href="/static/css/second.less" type="text/css" />
<link href="/static/css/third.css" type="text/css" />
<script src="http://lesscss.googlecode.com/files/less-1.0.21.min.js"></script>

<script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8">
    less.env = "development";
    less.watch();
</script>
 On production servers (if the special cookie is not present): <link href="/cache/46537a8b8e876f7a8e7.css" type="text/css" />
 the second parameter specify if the less.js should be output on the development server Obviously 12a42323bfe339ea9w.js and 46537a8b8e876f7a8e7.css are the optimized, packed and compiled version of the script. This solution should be able to detect when a source file change and recompile the scripts for production. It should be configurable to regarding locations of the script and type of caching (disk is fine). Ideally the pack_js should probably have an option to make possible lazy load of the js in production. Every suggestion is welcomed.

I found a lot of helpful but simple examples like this. Also the most comprehensive guide that I found until now is this one. Before I start writing my own library, I want to check if anyone already wrote it If your solution does not fit into the observations below thats not a problem. I would like also to read it so it can help me out if decide to write my own solution My main concerns/observations: Needs to be safe. Want to avoid garbage output as not all terminals or pagers/editors (like less, more, vim, and so on) support colored output or more styled output (bold, blinked, italic, etc) Needs to be easy and readable. Using ANSI escape codes directly is horrible: echo -e '\033[32mthis is ugly and \033[1;32mvery green\033[0m' Needs to give me access to the whole color palette and styles for foreground and background text. Most of the examples I found uses only the basic colors for foreground text only. Its preferable to use only simple commands like bash or simpler shells built in commands and/or common commands that can be found on most operating systems. For instance I can use colorize but I would need ruby (that's somewhat ok) and the colorize gem installed (not ok) Tput seems to be a good option as it can manipulate the shell cursor quite well, but it is somewhat simpler/less flexible Edit After some research on terminal control and output formatting, I am writing this gist that tries to accomplish this. So far it is doing quite well

@LINK:/questions/6659489/design-pattern-for-managing-multiple-asynchronous-javascript-operations
@TITLE:Design pattern for managing multiple asynchronous JavaScript operations
@CONTENT:I'm looking for a good design pattern for keeping track of a bunch of different asynchronous JavaScript activities (images loading, multiple AJAX calls, sequenced AJAX calls, etc¡K) that's better than just a lot of custom callbacks and custom state variables. What would you suggest I use? Is there any type of queue system with the ability to have logic beyond just sequencing? Example Problem I have a startup sequence that involves a number of asynchronous processes (loading images, waiting for timers, making some ajax calls, doing some initialization). Some of the asynch processes can be launched to run at the same time (loading of images, AJAX calls) and some have to be sequenced (run AJAX call #1, then AJAX call #2). Right now, I've got everything running off callback functions and a bunch of global state that keeps track of what has or hasn't completed. It works, but it's quite messy and I've had a few bugs because of the complication of making sure you handle all the sequencing possibilities right and error conditions. When you have problems, it's also quite a pain to debug because it's like the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. As soon as you set a breakpoint anywhere in the sequence, everything changes. You have to put all sorts of debugging statements in the code to try to discern what's happening. Here's a more specific description: There are three images loading. As soon as one specific image is loaded, I want to display it. Once it's been displayed for a certain amount of time, I want to display the second image. The third one goes in a queue for later display. There are three AJAX calls that must happen in consecutive order (the output of one is used as part of the input of the next). When the AJAX calls are done, there's a bunch of JS processing of the results to do and then two more images need to get loaded. When those two images are loaded, there's some more display stuff to do. When all that is done, you examine how long one of the images has been displayed and if enough time has passed, display the next image. If not, wait some more time before displaying the next image. Each step has both success and error handlers. Some of the error handlers kick off alternate code that can still continue successfully. I don't expect anyone to follow the exact process here, but just to give folks an idea of the type of logic between the steps. Edit: I came across YUI's AsyncQueue which isn't a complete solution for the type of problem I have, but is in the same space. It seems to be more for sequencing or ordering a bunch of async operations, but I don't see how it helps with the type of decision making I have.

@TITLE:Serving Images with on-the-fly resize
@CONTENT:my company has recently started to get problems with the image handling for our websites. We have several websites (adult entertainment) that display images like dvd covers, snapshots and similar. We have about 100'000 movies and for each movie we have an average of 30 snapshots + covers. Almost every image has an additional version with blurring and overlay for non-members, this results in about 50 images per movie or a total of 5 million base images. Each of the images is available in several versions, depending on where it's placed on the page (thumbnail, original, small preview, not-so-small preview, small image in the top-list, etc.) which results in more images than i cared to count. Now i had the idea to use a server to generate the images on-the-fly since it became quite clumsy to generate all the different images for all the different pages (as different pages sometimes even need different image sizes for basically the same task). Does anyone know of an image processing server that can scale down images on-the-fly so we only need to provide the original images and the web guys can just request whatever size they need? Requirements: Very High performance (Several thousand users per day) On-the-fly blurring and overlay creation On-the-fly resize (with and without keeping aspect ratio) Can handle millions of images Must be able to read JPG, GIF, PNG and BMP and convert between them Security is not that much of a concern as i.e. the unblurred images can already be reached by URL manipulation and more security would be nice but it's not required and frankly i stopped caring (After failing to get into my coworkers heads why (for our small reseller page) it's a bad idea to use http://example.com/view_image.php?filename=/data/images/01020304.jpg to display the images). We tried PHP scripts to do this but the performance was too slow for this many users. Thanks in advance for any suggestions you have.

@TITLE:Best approach to send data from a server to an Android device
@CONTENT:I am developing an Android app that needs to communicate bi-directionally with a server. By that, I mean either the server or the device can send a message at any time, with an arbitrary amount of time in between messages. Sending data from the device to the server is a common and I think well understood task, but I'm not as sure what the best approach is to go in the opposite direction from the server to the device. I think having the device periodically poll the server may be a bad idea due to latency and the drain on the battery, but I'd be willing to consider this option. My plan at the moment is to send text messages from the server via an email-to-SMS bridge, and to have my app run a service to receive and handle these messages. The question I have is if there are any best practices for this scenario, and if using text messages has some downsides that I have failed to consider. For the sake of this question, I want to assume that users have an unlimited text data plan, so paying per text won't be an issue.

This has created a desire in me to take my understanding to a lower level. I have no problems with the low level understanding like assembly how ever bytecode and the JVM confound me. How object oriented code gets broken down on a low level is lost to me. I was wondering if anyone had any suggestion on how to learn about the JVM, bytecode and the lower level functioning of Java. Are there any utilities out there that allow you to write and run bytecode directly as I believe hands on experience with something is the best way to grow in understanding of it? Additionally and reading suggestions on this topic would be appreciated. Edit: Secondary question. So I have a kinda sub question, the answers gave me an interesting idea to learn about the jvm, what would the plausibility of writing a really simple language like brainf**k or Ook only in a readable syntax (maybe I could even develop it to support oo eventually) that compiles into bytecode be?

@TITLE:Bluetooth Low Energy - updating a characteristic value repeatedly
@CONTENT:Follow-Up question on Electrical Engineering Stackexchange I want to write the value of a Bluetooth Low Energy characteristic repeatedly in a short amount of time (as a possible use case, imagine a mouse). The characteristic with a 128bit UUID is 20 bytes long. Therefore, it can be written in a single Low Energy transaction. Writes occur at a rate of 50 Hz, that is equal to a write once every 20ms. Therefore, 20 * 50 * 8 = 8 kbit/s are written. I am using the Command / Write without response mode to write the characteristic. Therefore, no acknowledgments happen on the attribute layer. No other Bluetooth or Bluetooth Low Energy devices are connected. Nothing is performed over WLAN. No other characteristics are read or written during the tests. I test the program by sending packets containing sequence numbers from an iPhone 4S. The sequence number is incremented by one after each sent packet. On the receiving side, a programmable development board, that incorporates a CSR1000 BLE chip, is used that receives the packets and prints the received sequence numbers to the serial connection. My problems are the following: After some time, packets start getting dropped. The first ~100 packets work fine @ 50 Hz. From then on, packets start getting dropped.            0x00 - 0x46   received
            0x47, 0x48   missing
0x49, 0x4a, 0x4b, 0x4c   received
                  0x4d   missing
0x4e, 0x4f, 0x50, 0x51   received
                  0x52   missing
0x53, 0x54, 0x55, 0x56   received
                  0x57   missing
...
 Most often, a pack of four packets is transmitted fine (rarely, only 2 packets). Then, 1-7 packets are missing. When I reduce the characteristic value size, the problem still persists. When I write at 100Hz instead of at 50Hz, the picture is the same - only that the drops start occuring after around 35 packets and that 5-7 packets are dropped between the successful transmission of four packets. With the lost packets, the resulting transmission rate is around 5 kbit/s, regardless of the frequency of writes. This is clearly below the ~305 kbit/s that should be technically possible over Bluetooth Low Energy. The problem also occurs into the opposite direction, when I am sending packets from the development board to the iPhone 4S. Again, 5 kbit/s is the maximum that I am getting. The Notification mechanism is used for this scenario. Again, no acknowledgments happen on the attribute layer. When I try to send in both directions simultaneously, things start to blow up to the point where I have to reset both the development board and the iPhone 4S. Questions: May this be a problem of the Bluetooth Low Energy chip, that is used on the development board? If yes, why does the problem also occur into the opposite direction, where the iPhone acts as the receiver? Are there any development boards on the market that support high-frequency access to characteristics? What could be the origin of the problem? Please also try to reference parts of the Bluetooth Spec / presentation slides / articles in addition to assumptions. There exist Bluetooth Low Energy mice on the market. Mice have typical polling rates of 125 Hz and have to at least send two 16 byte values plus additional HID overhead per tick. Therefore, a solution for my problem should be available. Update The LE Connection Complete Event is described in Bluetooth Specification Version 4.0 Vol 2 Part E Section 7.7.65.1.

@CONTENT:I have an iPhone application using UINavigationController and would like to customize the elements with custom background images. I was able to do this for the UINavigationController's UINavigationBar pretty easily using Objective-C categories as below: http://foobarpig.com/iphone/uinavigationbar-with-solid-color-or-image-background.html I'd like to do the same for the UINavigationController's UIToolbar, but the same approach doesn't seem to work (although I have absolutely no idea why not.) I've looked around and people seem to suggest subclassing UIToolbar, but this isn't possible for the UINavigationController's toolbar, which is a read-only UIToolbar. I want to use the UINavigationController's toolbar instead of just making a subview toolbar because I'm using the slide-in setToolbarHidden animation. Anyone have any idea if it's possible to apply a background image to this UINavigationController toolbar (most likely by somehow overriding the drawRect method)?

@CONTENT:This example does pretty much what I would like to port in Angular-js: HTML5 File API. I have been trying to google some example of directives however I found old example that do massive use of DOM or are not written for Angular 1.0.4. Basically this is the pure js code: var holder = document.getElementById('holder'),
    state = document.getElementById('status');

if (typeof window.FileReader === 'undefined') {
  state.className = 'fail';
} else {
  state.className = 'success';
  state.innerHTML = 'File API & FileReader available';

holder.ondragover = function () { this.className = 'hover'; return false; };
holder.ondragend = function () { this.className = ''; return false; };
holder.ondrop = function (e) {

  e.preventDefault();

  var file = e.dataTransfer.files[0],
      reader = new FileReader();
  reader.onload = function (event) {
    console.log(event.target);
    holder.style.background = 'url(' + event.target.result + ') no-repeat center';
  };
  console.log(file);
  reader.readAsDataURL(file);

  return false;
};
 The only possible way I can think of is creating a directive that does edo.directive('fileDrag', function () {
  return {
    restrict: 'A',
    link: function (scope, elem) {
      elem.bind('ondrop', function(e){
        e.preventDefault();
        var file = e.dataTransfer.files[0], reader = new FileReader();

        console.log(file);
        reader.readAsDataURL(file);

        return false;
      });
    }
  };
});

@TITLE:Integrating gyro and accelerometer readings [duplicate]
@CONTENT:Possible Duplicate: Combine Gyroscope and Accelerometer Data I have read a number of papers on Kalman filters, but there seem to be few good publically accessible worked examples of getting from mathematical paper to actual working code. I have a system containing a three-axis accelerometer and a single gyro measuring rotation around one of the accelerometer axes. The system is designed to be held by a human, and much of the time the gyro will be measuring rotation about the gravity vector or close to it. (People working in the same industry will likely recognise what I am talking about from that ;)) I realise this is underconstrained. The gyros appear to have a near-constant bias that is slightly different for each instance of the system. How would I go about coding a filter to use the accelerometer readings to calibrate the gyro at times when the system is tilted so the gyro axis is not collinear with gravity, and is being rotated about the gyro axis? It seems like there should be enough information to do that, but being told that there isn't and why would be an answer too :)

@TITLE:bit vector implementation of set in Programming Pearls, 2nd Edition
@CONTENT:On Page 140 of Programming Pearls, 2nd Edition, Jon proposed an implementation of sets with bit vectors. We'll turn now to two final structures that exploit the fact that our sets represent integers. Bit vectors are an old friend from Column 1. Here are their private data and functions: enum { BITSPERWORD = 32, SHIFT = 5, MASK = 0x1F };
int n, hi, *x;
void set(int i)  {        x[i>>SHIFT] |=  (1<<(i & MASK)); }
void clr(int i)  {        x[i>>SHIFT] &= ~(1<<(i & MASK)); }
int  test(int i) { return x[i>>SHIFT] &=  (1<<(i & MASK)); }
 As I gathered, the central idea of a bit vector to represent an integer set, as described in Column 1, is that the i-th bit is turned on if and only if the integer i is in the set. But I am really at a loss at the algorithms involved in the above three functions. And the book doesn't give an explanation. I can only get that i & MASK is to get the lower 5 bits of i, while i>>SHIFT is to move i 5 bits toward the right. Anybody would elaborate more on these algorithms? Bit operations always seem a myth to me, :(

@LINK:/questions/5262224/how-are-reddit-and-hacker-news-ranking-algorithms-used
@TITLE:How are Reddit and Hacker News ranking algorithms used?
@CONTENT:I've been looking at ranking algorithms recently, specifically those used by Reddit and Hacker News. The algorithms themselves are simple enough, but I don't quite understand how they are used. One thing that I could do is implement the algorithm straight in SQL, so that every time a user goes to a page displaying ranked posts, something like this would run: SELECT thing1, thing2 FROM table
ORDER BY ranking_algorithm DESC
LIMIT page*20, 20
 There are several similar questions on SO, but the only answer given is to put the ranking algorithm inside the SQL query. Then the thread dies... Putting the algorithm in the SQL query fine on a smaller scale, but what if the website has a large number of users and a very large number of posts? That means that the every time any user opens a page that displays ranked posts, that query will be run. That can't be very efficient. Now, Reddit and Hacker News don't run their ranking algorithms in as SQL queries, but in python and ark respectively. So how and when exactly are they used? One possible solution is to take all the relevant info from every post and store it in some data structure on the web server. Then rank and sort this data structure. Every time someone opens a page that shows the ranked posts, you just go to the data structure, retrieve the correct range of posts, and display them. Then every half hour or so, you retrieve the most up to date information from the server, rank it, sort it, and update the data structure. Other less expensive queries, such as retrieving and displaying all the info from a specific post, or displaying the newest posts (as opposed to the best scored) could be done in SQL every time the relevant page is opened. The advantage is that your database is being hit (for the expensive ranking query) only once every half hour. The disadvantage is that you need to have a duplicate of a large chunk of your database.

It is NOT about memorizing .NET libraries, it is rather to understand how does the execution environment (in which those libraries live on runtime) work. My question was directly inspired by John Robbins the author of "Debugging Applications for Microsoft? .NET" book (which I recommend) and colleague of here cited Jeffrey Richter at Wintellect. In one of introductory chapters he is saying that "...any .NET programmer should know what is probing and how assemblies are loaded into runtime". Do you think there are other such things?

   function index()

      $this->load->view('header');
      $this->load->view('menu');
      $this->load->view('content', $data);
      $this->load->view('footer');
   }

}
 or calling the single view file, and calling the header and footer views from there: //controller file    
class Page extends Controller {

   function index()
   {
      $data['page_title'] = 'Your title';
      $this->load->view('content', $data);

   }

}

//view file

<?php $this->load->view('header'); ?>

<p>The data from the controller</p>

<?php $this->load->view('footer'); ?>
 I've seen it done both ways, but want to choose now before I go too far down a path.
@CODE:class Page extends Controller {

   function index()
   {
      $data['page_title'] = 'Your title';
      $this->load->view('header');
      $this->load->view('menu');
      $this->load->view('content', $data);
      $this->load->view('footer');
   }

} //controller file    
class Page extends Controller {

   function index()
   {
      $data['page_title'] = 'Your title';
      $this->load->view('content', $data);

@TITLE:How to design redis pub/sub for an instant messaging system?
@CONTENT:I am new to redis pub/sub. I have a chat facility in the system which is like IM. So I would like to use redis pub/sub. As I have examined the samples most of them are designed based on a chat room. In my system I will have multiple chat rooms between users like; A:B
A:C
D:C
E:F
 So, the lines above are the rooms. And I have implemented the server with node.js like below; var store = redis.createClient();
var pub = redis.createClient();
io.sockets.on('connection', function (socket) {
    var sub = redis.createClient();

    sub.on("message", function(pattern, data){
            data = JSON.parse(data);
        socket.send(JSON.stringify({ type: "chat", key: pattern, nick: data.nickname, message: data.text }))
        }
    });

    socket.on('message', function (messageData) {
        store.incr("messageNextId", function(e, messageId) {
        var room = ""
        var from = messageData.clientId > socket.nickname ? socket.nickname : messageData.clientId;
        var to = messageData.clientId < socket.nickname ? socket.nickname : messageData.clientId;   
            room = from + ":" + to;

        var message = { id: messageId, nickname: socket.nickname, text: messageData.text };
        store.rpush("rooms:" + room, JSON.stringify(message), function(e, r) {  
             pub.publish(room, JSON.stringify(message))
        });
    });
});
 As you can see I am creating a new redis subscriber for each connection. In other chat room samples redis subscriber client is created globally. And there exists only three connections all the time and that solves their problem because when a publisher publishes a message all connected clients should get it. But I have a constraint here. I want to open a chat session between two users and only these users should be the subscribers. The code above works as I would like to but I do not know if it is OK for redis to create a new subscriber client for each connection. It would be great to hear your suggestions. Thanks in advance.
@CODE:A:B
A:C
D:C
E:F var store = redis.createClient();
var pub = redis.createClient();

    sub.on("message", function(pattern, data){
            data = JSON.parse(data);
        socket.send(JSON.stringify({ type: "chat", key: pattern, nick: data.nickname, message: data.text }))
        }
    });

    socket.on('message', function (messageData) {
        store.incr("messageNextId", function(e, messageId) {
        var room = ""
        var from = messageData.clientId > socket.nickname ? socket.nickname : messageData.clientId;

@TITLE:Spring MVC + Hibernate: data validation strategies
@CONTENT:We all know, that Spring MVC integrate well with Hibernate Validator and JSR-303 in general. But Hibernate Validator, as someone said, is something for Bean Validation only, which means that more complex validations should be pushed to the data layer. Examples of such validations: business key uniqueness, intra-records dependence (which is usually something pointing at DB design problems, but we all live in an imperfect world). Even simple validations like string field length may be driven by some DB value, which makes Hibernate Validator unusable. So my question is, is there something Spring or Hibernate or JSR offers to perform such complex validations? Is there some established pattern or technology piece to perform such a validation in a standard Controller-Service-Repository setup based on Spring and Hibernate? UPDATE: Let me be more specific. For example, there's a form which sends an AJAX save request to the controller's save method. If some validation error occurs -- either simple or "complex" -- we should get back to the browser with some json indicating a problematic field and associated error. For simple errors I can extract the field (if any) and error message from BindingResult. What infrastructure (maybe specific, not ad-hoc exceptions?) would you propose for "complex" errors? Using exception handler doesn't seem like a good idea to me, because separating single process of validation between save method and @ExceptionHandler makes things intricate. Currently I use some ad-hoc exception (like, ValidationException): public @ResponseBody Result save(@Valid Entity entity, BindingResult errors) {
    Result r = new Result();
    if (errors.hasErrors()) {
        r.setStatus(Result.VALIDATION_ERROR);     
        // ...   
    } else {
        try {
            dao.save(entity);
            r.setStatus(Result.SUCCESS);
        } except (ValidationException e) {
            r.setStatus(Result.VALIDATION_ERROR);
            r.setText(e.getMessage());
        }
    }
    return r;
}
 Can you offer some more optimal approach?
@CODE:save BindingResult save @ExceptionHandler ValidationException public @ResponseBody Result save(@Valid Entity entity, BindingResult errors) {
    Result r = new Result();
    if (errors.hasErrors()) {
        r.setStatus(Result.VALIDATION_ERROR);     
        // ...   
    } else {
        try {
            dao.save(entity);
            r.setStatus(Result.SUCCESS);
        } except (ValidationException e) {
            r.setStatus(Result.VALIDATION_ERROR);
            r.setText(e.getMessage());
        }

Till now I have been using SQL_NO_CACHE, but sometimes the results of such tests also show caching behaviour - taking much longer to execute on the first run and taking less time on subsequent runs. If someone can explain this behaviour in full detail I might stick to using SQL_NO_CACHE; I do believe that it might be due to file system cache and/or caching of indexes used to execute the query, as this post explains. It is not clear to me when Buffer Pool and Key Buffer get invalidated or how they might interfere with testing. So, short of restarting mysql server, how would you recommend to setup an environment that would be reliable in determining if one query performs better then the other?

I can not find one that gives a good, down to earth, introduction to Agile development for those who know nothing about. Can anyone provide such a link? Thanks in Advance.

@TITLE:How does HTTP Adaptive Bitrate Streaming work on the iPhone?
@CONTENT:Apple has included HTTP Adaptive Bitrate Streaming in the iPhone OS 3.0, in particular Safari handles this automatically. I'd like to play with this in a low cost manner, but I expect it'll require a custom HTTP server in the worst case, and interesting PHP/etc scripting in the best case. But first I need to know what the protocol differences or standard is. HTTP is reasonably simple as a protocol, but adaptive bitrate means the file size is different, the chunk locations are different at different bitrates, etc. For instance, does the client tell the server anything special about the stream as it's downloading, or is it all handled on the server side? Eliminating buffering pauses for the end user is very attractive for both live and pre-recorded video streams, and doing both over HTTP is even better given many networks and governments are limiting non port 80 traffic. What are the technical details for HTTP adaptive bitrate streaming, especially Apple's implementation? Where is this best implemented - part of the HTTP server itself, part of a mod, in a script...? What changes are required for the client side, if one were to implement this in an application?

 Of course there's no such thing as $host.Exit(). There is $host.SetShouldExit(), but this actually closes the console window, which is not what I want. What I need is something equivalent to Python's sys.exit() that will simply stop execution of the current script without further adieu. Edit: Yeah, it's just exit. Duh.

@CONTENT:I was trying to figure out hands-on how tail calls are handled by the C# compiler. (Answer: They're not. But the 64bit JIT(s) WILL do TCE (tail call elimination). Restrictions apply.) So I wrote a small test using a recursive call that prints how many times it gets called before the StackOverflowException kills the process. class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Rec();
    }

    static int sz = 0;
    static Random r = new Random();
    static void Rec()
    {
        sz++;

        //uncomment for faster, more imprecise runs
        //if (sz % 100 == 0)
        {
            //some code to keep this method from being inlined
            var zz = r.Next();  
            Console.Write("{0} Random: {1}\r", sz, zz);
        }

        //uncommenting this stops TCE from happening
        //else
        //{
        //    Console.Write("{0}\r", sz);
        //}

        Rec();
    }
 Right on cue, the program ends with SO Exception on any of: 'Optimize build' OFF (either Debug or Release) Target: x86 Target: AnyCPU + "Prefer 32 bit" (this is new in VS 2012 and the first time I saw it. More here.) Some seemingly innocuous branch in the code (see commented 'else' branch). Conversely, using 'Optimize build' ON + (Target = x64 or AnyCPU with 'Prefer 32bit' OFF (on a 64bit CPU)), TCE happens and the counter keeps spinning up forever (ok, it arguably spins down each time its value overflows). But I noticed a behaviour I can't explain in the StackOverflowException case: it never (?) happens at exactly the same stack depth. Here are the outputs of a few 32-bit runs, Release build: 51600 Random: 1778264579

Process is terminated due to StackOverflowException.
 The stack size is constant (defaults to 1 MB). The stack frames' sizes are constant. So then, what can account for the (sometimes non-trivial) variation of stack depth when the StackOverflowException hits? UPDATE Hans Passant raises the issue of Console.WriteLine touching P/Invoke, interop and possibly non-deterministic locking. So I simplified the code to this: class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Rec();
    }
    static int sz = 0;
    static void Rec()
    {
        sz++;
        Rec();
    }
}
 I ran it in Release/32bit/Optimization ON without a debugger. When the program crashes, I attach the debugger and check the value of the counter. And it still isn't the same on several runs. (Or my test is flawed.) UPDATE: Closure As suggested by fejesjoco, I looked into ASLR (Address space layout randomization). It's a security technique that makes it hard for buffer overflow attacks to find the precise location of (e.g.) specific system calls, by randomizing various things in the process address space, including the stack position and, apparently, its size. The theory sounds good. Let's put it into practice! In order to test this, I used a Microsoft tool specific for the task: EMET or The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit. It allows setting the ASLR flag (and a lot more) on a system- or process-level. (There is also a system-wide, registry hacking alternative that I didn't try) In order to verify the effectiveness of the tool, I also discovered that Process Explorer duly reports the status of the ASLR flag in the 'Properties' page of the process. Never saw that until today :) Theoretically, EMET can (re)set the ASLR flag for a single process. In practice, it didn't seem to change anything (see above image). However, I disabled ASLR for the entire system and (one reboot later) I could finally verify that indeed, the SO exception now always happens at the same stack depth.

@TITLE:Profiling Android apps with Eclipse plugin TPTP instead of traceview
@CONTENT:The standard way to profile an Android application in Eclipse is using the plugin DDMS and creating a trace file with all the information inside. If you want to view this information you can use "traceview". I didn't like my first experience with this application because you can't filter the results. You have a lot of method calls for starting your application and you cannot filter only your code. I have been looking for an alternative method. I found this tutorial Using Eclipse* TPTP to Visualize Google* Android* Profiling Data that explains how you can use the Eclipse Test & Performance Tools Platform (TPTP) Profiling tool to visualize Android profiling data. Thanks to this previous post Permission to write to the SD card I managed to take my trace file from the Android Emulator into my file systems. The next step is converting this .trace file into a TPTP .trcxml file. I didn't find this converter they talk about. Anyone knows where I can find this converter? Do you know another way to analyze this trace file with TPTP or with another more mature FREE profiler tool? Do you know another way to profile Android application? Thanks in advance Edit 1: I found some interesting tool you can use to analyze Android apps memory usage. In order to get memory usage from Eclipse you have to "Dump HPROF file" from the DDMS prospective. Before doing that you have to choose in the DDMS preference panel, when it says "HPROF Action", the "Save to disk" action. So from now on when you dump HPROF file you'll be asked where you want to save your .hprof file. You have to convert this file with the Android tool "hprof-conv" you can find in your Android SDK installation under the directory "./tools". Finally now you can use the Eclipse MAT plugin to view the memory usage stats. I hope it will help someone else. If anyone knows something else about profiling Android apps it will appreciated.

@LINK:/questions/3884121/haskell-function-application-and-currying
@TITLE:Haskell function application and currying
@CONTENT:I am always interested in learning new languages, a fact that keeps me on my toes and makes me (I believe) a better programmer. My attempts at conquering Haskell come and go - twice so far - and I decided it was time to try again. 3rd time's the charm, right? Nope. I re-read my old notes... and get disappointed :-( The problem that made me lose faith last time, was an easy one: permutations of integers. i.e. from a list of integers, to a list of lists - a list of their permutations: [int] -> [[int]]
 This is in fact a generic problem, so replacing 'int' above with 'a', would still apply. From my notes: I code it first on my own, I succeed. Hurrah! I send my solution to a good friend of mine - Haskell guru, it usually helps to learn from gurus - and he sends me this, which I am told, "expresses the true power of the language, the use of generic facilities to code your needs". All for it, I recently drank the kool-aid, let's go: permute :: [a] -> [[a]]
permute = foldr (concatMap.ins) [[]]
   where ins x []     = [[x]]
         ins x (y:ys) = (x:y:ys):[ y:res | res <- ins x ys]
 Hmm. Let's break this down: bash$ cat b.hs
ins x []     = [[x]]
ins x (y:ys) = (x:y:ys):[ y:res | res <- ins x ys]

bash$ ghci
Prelude> :load b.hs
[1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( b.hs, interpreted )
Ok, modules loaded: Main.

*Main> ins 1 [2,3]
[[1,2,3],[2,1,3],[2,3,1]]
 OK, so far, so good. Took me a minute to understand the second line of "ins", but OK: It places the 1st arg in all possible positions in the list. Cool. Now, to understand the foldr and concatMap. in "Real world Haskell", the DOT was explained... (f . g) x
 ...as just another syntax for... f (g x) 
 And in the code the guru sent, DOT was used from a foldr, with the "ins" function as the fold "collapse": *Main> let g=concatMap . ins
*Main> g 1 [[2,3]]
[[1,2,3],[2,1,3],[2,3,1]]
 OK, since I want to understand how the DOT is used by the guru, I try the equivalent expression according to the DOT definition, (f . g) x = f (g x) ... *Main> concatMap (ins 1 [[2,3]])

<interactive>:1:11:
     Couldn't match expected type `a -> [b]'
            against inferred type `[[[t]]]'
     In the first argument of `concatMap', namely `(ins 1 [[2, 3]])'
     In the expression: concatMap (ins 1 [[2, 3]])
     In the definition of `it': it = concatMap (ins 1 [[2, 3]])
 What!?! Why? OK, I check concatMap's signature, and find that it needs a lambda and a list, but that's just a human thinking; how does GHC cope? According to the definition of DOT above... (f.g)x = f(g x), 
 ...what I did was valid, replace-wise: (concatMap . ins) x y = concatMap (ins x y)
 Scratching head... *Main> concatMap (ins 1) [[2,3]]
[[1,2,3],[2,1,3],[2,3,1]]
 So... The DOT explanation was apparently too simplistic... DOT must be somehow clever enough to understand that we in fact wanted "ins" to get curri-ed away and "eat" the first argument - thus becoming a function that only wants to operate on [t] (and "intersperse" them with '1' in all possible positions). But where was this specified? How did GHC knew to do this, when we invoked: *Main> (concatMap . ins) 1 [[2,3]]
[[1,2,3],[2,1,3],[2,3,1]]
 Did the "ins" signature somehow conveyed this... "eat my first argument" policy? *Main> :info ins
ins :: t -> [t] -> [[t]]        -- Defined at b.hs:1:0-2
 I don't see nothing special - "ins" is a function that takes a 't', a list of 't', and proceeds to create a list with all "interspersals". Nothing about "eat your first argument and curry it away". So there... I am baffled. I understand (after an hour of looking at the code!) what goes on, but... God almighty... Perhaps GHC makes attempts to see how many arguments it can "peel off"?   let's try with no argument "curried" into "ins",
  oh gosh, boom, 
  let's try with one argument "curried" into "ins",
  yep, works,
  that must be it, proceed)
 Again - yikes... And since I am always comparing the languages I am learning with what I already know, how would "ins" look in Python? a=[2,3]
print [a[:x]+[1]+a[x:] for x in xrange(len(a)+1)]

[[1, 2, 3], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1]]
 Be honest, now... which is simpler? I mean, I know I am a newbie in Haskell, but I feel like an idiot... Looking at 4 lines of code for an hour, and ending up assuming that the compiler... tries various interpretations until it finds something that "clicks"? To quote from Lethal weapon, "I am too old for this"...

@TITLE:Rails 3.1, RSpec: testing model validations
@CONTENT:I have started my journey with TDD in Rails and have run into a small issue regarding tests for model validations that I can't seem to find a solution to. Let's say I have a User model, class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates :username, :presence => true
end
 and a simple test it "should require a username" do
  User.new(:username => "").should_not be_valid
end
 This correctly tests the presence validation, but what if I want to be more specific? For example, testing full_messages on the errors object.. it "should require a username" do
  user = User.create(:username => "")
  user.errors[:username].should ~= /can't be blank/
end
 My concern about the initial attempt (using should_not be_valid) is that RSpec won't produce a descriptive error message. It simply says "expected valid? to return false, got true." However, the second test example has a minor drawback: it uses the create method instead of the new method in order to get at the errors object. I would like my tests to be more specific about what they're testing, but at the same time not have to touch a database. Anyone have any input?
@CODE:class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates :username, :presence => true
end it "should require a username" do
  User.new(:username => "").should_not be_valid
end it "should require a username" do
  user = User.create(:username => "")
  user.errors[:username].should ~= /can't be blank/
end

@TITLE:What's the difference between a Resource, URI, URL, Path and File in Java?
@CONTENT:I'm looking at a piece of Java code right now, and it takes a path as a String and gets its URL using URL resource = ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader().getResource(pathAsString);, then calls String path = resource.getPath() and finally executes new File(path);. Oh, and there are also calls to URL url = resource.toURI(); and String file = resource.getFile(). I'm totally confused right now - mostly because of the terminology, I guess. Can someone please walk me through the differences, or provide a few links to Dummy-proof material? Especially URI to URL and Resource to File? To me, it feels like they should be the same thing, respectively... The difference between getFile() and getPath() is explained here: What's the difference between url.getFile() and getpath()? (Interestingly they both seem to return Strings, which probably adds a whole lot to my state of mind...) Now, if I have a locator that references a class or package in a jar file, will those two (i.e. path an file strings) differ? resource.toString() would give you jar:file:/C:/path/to/my.jar!/com/example/, after all (note the exclamation mark). Is the difference between URI and URL in Java that the former doesn't encode spaces? Cf. Files, URIs, and URLs conflicting in Java (This answer explains the general, conceptual difference between the two terms fairly well: URIs identify and URLs locate;) Lastly - and most importantly - why do I need File object; why isn't a Resource (URL) enough? (And is there a Resource object?) Sorry if this question is a bit unorganized; it just reflects the confusion I have... :)

@TITLE:Why use JAX-RS / Jersey?
@CONTENT:Sorry, this questions sounds silly, but after developing some of my RESTful services using Jersey, I asked myself the question -- If REST is just an architecture, and not a protocol like SOAP, why do we need a specification like JAX-RS? I actually googled for questions like "What is the difference between servlets and RESTful services over HTTP" and to sum up the community answers, I got: RESTful service development (on Jersey) is an architecture, which inherently uses servlets. JAX-RS compliant tools like Jersey provide easy marshalling-unmarshalling of XML/JSON data, helping the developers. REST helps us use GET/POST/PUT/DELETE in a fashion that is far efficient than normal servlets. According to these answers, I guess if I write a servlet which uses JAXB (for dealing with automatic serialization), and I efficiently use GET/POST/PUT/DELETE in my servlet code, I don't use a tool like Jersey, and hence JAX-RS. I know I am terribly wrong passing this statement, please correct me. PS: This doubt actually came in when I had to develop some RESTful services in PHP. After going on through some of the RESTful PHP codes, I realized they are just the same old PHP scripts, with some helper methods for handling XML/JSON.

@TITLE:Unit testing handling of degraded network stack, file corruption, and other imperfections
@CONTENT:I'm primarily a C++ coder, and thus far, have managed without really writing tests for all of my code. I've decided this is a Bad Idea(tm), after adding new features that subtly broke old features, or, depending on how you wish to look at it, introduced some new "features" of their own. But, unit testing seems to be an extremely brittle mechanism. You can test for something in "perfect" conditions, but you don't get to see how your code performs when stuff breaks. A for instance is a crawler, let's say it crawls a few specific sites, for data X. Do you simply save sample pages, test against those, and hope that the sites never change? This would work fine as regression tests, but, what sort of tests would you write to constantly check those sites live and let you know when the application isn't doing it's job because the site changed something, that now causes your application to crash? Wouldn't you want your test suite to monitor the intent of the code? The above example is a bit contrived, and something I haven't run into (in case you haven't guessed). Let me pick something I have, though. How do you test an application will do its job in the face of a degraded network stack? That is, say you have a moderate amount of packet loss, for one reason or the other, and you have a function DoSomethingOverTheNetwork() which is supposed to degrade gracefully when the stack isn't performing as it's supposed to; but does it? The developer tests it personally by purposely setting up a gateway that drops packets to simulate a bad network when he first writes it. A few months later, someone checks in some code that modifies something subtly, so the degradation isn't detected in time, or, the application doesn't even recognize the degradation, this is never caught, because you can't run real world tests like this using unit tests, can you? Further, how about file corruption? Let's say you're storing a list of servers in a file, and the checksum looks okay, but the data isn't really. You want the code to handle that, you write some code that you think does that. How do you test that it does exactly that for the life of the application? Can you? Hence, brittleness. Unit tests seem to test the code only in perfect conditions(and this is promoted, with mock objects and such), not what they'll face in the wild. Don't get me wrong, I think unit tests are great, but a test suite composed only of them seems to be a smart way to introduce subtle bugs in your code while feeling overconfident about it's reliability. How do I address the above situations? If unit tests aren't the answer, what is? Edit: I see a lot of answers that say "just mock it". Well, you can't "just mock it", here's why: Taking my example of the degrading network stack, let's assume your function has a well defined NetworkInterface, which we'll mock. The application sends out packets over both TCP, and UDP. Now, let's say, hey, let's simulate 10% loss on the interface using a mock object, and see what happens. Your TCP connections increase their retry attempts, as well as increasing their back-off, all good practice. You decide to change X% of your UDP packets to actually make a TCP connection, lossy interface, we want to be able to be able to guarantee delivery of some packets, and the others shouldn't lose too much. Works great. Meanwhile, in the real world.. when you increase the number of TCP connections (or, data over TCP), on a connection that's lossy enough, you'll end up increasing your UDP packet loss, as your TCP connections will end up re-sending their data more and more and/or reducing their window, causing your 10% packet loss to actually be more like 90% UDP packet loss now. Whoopsie. No biggie, let's break that up into UDPInterface, and TCPInterface. Wait a minute.. those are interdependent, testing 10% UDP loss and 10% TCP loss is no different than the above. So, the issue is now you're not simply unit testing your code, you're introducing your assumptions into the way the operating system's TCP stack works. And, that's a Bad Idea(tm). A much worse idea than just avoiding this entire fiasco. At some point, you're going to have to create a Mock OS, which behaves exactly like your real OS, except, is testable. That doesn't seem like a nice way forward. This is stuff we've experienced, I'm sure others can add their experiences too. I hope someone will tell me I'm very wrong, and point out why! Thanks!

@CONTENT:So I have some plugins and libraries I want to use in my angular app and (currently) I am simply referencing those functions/methods as they were intended in 99% of apps in a way that completely ignores dependency injection. I have (for example) the javascript library "MomentJS" which deals with formatting and validating dates and I have uses for it throughout my app in controllers, services and filters. The way that I've learned (using AngularJS) is to create a service that references the function (and it's methods) and inject that service into my controllers, which works great. The problem is that I really need to reference this library in all different kinds of components from services to filters to controllers and everything else. So, I guess my question is how do you do dependency injection in filters, services and everything else that isn't a controller? Is this possible? Is this even beneficial?

@CONTENT:Does anyone have any good guidance on when to use which level for application logging? These levels are (roughly) based on the old syslog message levels: 0 Emergency: system is unusable 1 Alert: action must be taken immediately 2 Critical: critical conditions 3 Error: error conditions 4 Warning: warning conditions 5 Notice: normal but significant condition 6 Informational: informational messages 7 Debug: debug-level messages Nowadays I have also seen TRACE as a distinct level, usually at a level of detail finer even than DEBUG. At the higher extremes (error, alert, emergency) the distinctions are easier to make. The key place for guidance to me is in what is INFO versus DEBUG (and even TRACE). My take on this is that INFO is for coarse-grained, and especially for externally significant events (entity CRUDs, access events, scheduled process events and the like). The DEBUG level would only be for Pre-Production and diagnostic uses and would be at a finer-grained, internal application machinery level. The TRACE level would be lower still. Thoughts?

Most of the concepts in Python and Perl match nicely: Python dictionary=Perl hash; Python tuple=Perl list; Python list=Perl array; etc. Question: Is there a Perl version of the Python form of an Iterator / Generator? An example: A Classic Python way to generate the Fibonacci numbers is: #!/usr/bin/python

def fibonacci(mag):
     a, b = 0, 1
     while a<=10**mag:
         yield a
         a, b = b, a+b

for number in fibonacci(15):  
     print "%17d" % number
 Iterators are also useful if you want to generate a subsection of a much larger list as needed. Perl 'lists' seem more static - more like a Python tuple. In Perl, can foreach be dynamic or is only based on a static list? The Python form of Iterator is a form that I have gotten used to, and I do not find it documented in Perl... Other than writing this in loops or recursively or generating a huge static list, how do I (for ex) write the Fibonacci subroutine it in Perl? Is there a Perl yield that I am missing? Specifically -- how do I write this: #!/usr/bin/perl
use warnings; use strict; # yes -- i use those!

sub fibonacci {
   # What goes here other than returning an array or list? 
}

foreach my $number (fibonacci(15)) { print $number . "\n"; }
 Thanks in advance to being kind to the newbie...

If you're using a layout - and why wouldn't you? - it also renders that. This is fine for normal Web pages, but when you're sending an AJAX response you don't want all that. How do you prevent Zend from auto-rendering on an action-by-action basis?

@CONTENT:Recently I've been doing lots of weekend coding, and have began to really need a bugtracker as things are gaining speed. This is probably the worst case scenario because I basically have to let things cool down over the week,so I simply can't remember the bugs in my head. So far I've been using a text file to jot down bugs,but I'd rather use something a bit better. The biggest points here are ease of use and very little setup time.Don't want to spend more than an hour learning the basics and trying to install something. Also in my case I'm on a Mac so that would help, but solutions for other platforms are welcomed as they will likely help others.

@LINK:/questions/11756269/choosing-a-scala-web-framework
@TITLE:Choosing a Scala web framework [closed]
@CONTENT:I am about to start a project for a web application that should run on a Tomcat server. I have decided to go for Scala - the other alternative where I work being Groovy - essentially for type safety. I am now faced with the task of choosing the right tools for the job. The project I will need to develop will be accessed only through a JSON API. It will interact both with its own database and with two external services, which expose respectively a JSON and XML API. I will also need to be able to schedule periodic jobs where my application will execute various synchronization tasks with these external services. For the database, I would like to be able to define my models in Scala and automatically generate the schema. If the need arises to change my models, I would like to have migrations to handle it. For this application, I am trying to evaluate Lift, Play! 2 and Scalatra. Lift was my first choice. It is the most mature of the three projects, and seems to be considered highly secure (I do not want to compromise on security). Moreover it features what seems to be the best JSON handling library in Scala. Still, after dabbling a bit with it, I am not sure this would be the right choice. The documentation is not exactly the best I have seen. Moreover, Record + Squeryl seems to me a better abstraction than Mapper, but documentation for this use is even more scarce. Finally, although Lift can certainly be used to create a web service, it seems that its real strength lies in the state handling, and so I am not convinced that the additional complexity is needed for my project. Play! 2 seems to have a better documentation, and looks more familiar to me (I come from a Django background). Again, its default database abstraction does not really appease me: ANORM relies on SQL, which does not help with type checking. I would have to use Squeryl anyway, and I am not sure whether the documentation for this use case is as good. Moreover, deploying Play! 2 applications is at the moment moer complicated than I'd like. One has to install Play! on the production server, and I am not sure this is an option where I work. Otherwise, there is a plugin to to make it work with servlets containers, but it is very new and I am not sure how stable/reliable it is. Finally there is the option of using Scalatra. Scalatra seems very easy to set up, and it is designed exactly to create web services. The compromise is that Scalatra does not offer much functionality. It does not integrate with existing ORMs or suggest how to organize the model part of the application, and it does not help in designing cron or command line tasks. I am also not sure about the long term future of the project. What do you think would be the best choice for my task?

@CONTENT:There is a lot of information about composition vs inheritance online, but I haven't found decent examples with JavaScript. Using the below code to demonstrate inheritance: function Stock( /* object with stock names and prices */ ) {
    for (var company_name in arguments[0]) {
        // copy the passed object into the new object created by the constructor
        this[company_name] = arguments[0][company_name];

}

// example methods in prototype, their implementation is probably redundant for

Stock.prototype =  {
    list: function () {
        var company_list = [];
        for (var company_name in this)
            company_list.push(company_name);

portfolio.list();  // MSFT,YHOO,AMZN
portfolio.total(); // $215.19
 (To make the code smaller, you can leave out the method implementations, like: Stock.total = function(){ /* code */ } I just put them in there to be fancy). If composition is favored for a lot of situations in OOP, how come most people using JavaScript seem to only use prototypes and inheritance? I did not find a lot of information about composition in JavaScript online, only in other languages. Can someone give me an example using the above code to demonstrate composition and aggregation?

@TITLE:Storing Credit Card Numbers in SESSION - ways around it?
@CONTENT:I am well aware of PCI Compliance so don't need an earful about storing CC numbers (and especially CVV nums) within our company database during checkout process. However, I want to be safe as possible when handling sensitive consumer information and am curious how to get around passing CC numbers from page to page WITHOUT using SESSION variables if at all possible. My site is built in this way: Step 1) collect Credit Card information from customer - when customer hits submit, the information is first run through JS validation, then run through PHP validation, if all passes he moves to step 2. Step 2) Information is displayed on a review page for customer to make sure the details of their upcoming transaction are shown. Only the first 6 and last 4 of the CC are shown on this page but card type, and exp date are shwon fully. If he clicks proceed, Step 3) The information is sent to another php page which runs one last validation, sends information through secure payment gateway, and string is returned with details. Step 4) If all is good and well, the consumer information (personal, not CC) is stored in DB and redirected to a completion page. If anything is bad, he is informed and told to revisit the CC processing page to try again (max of 3 times). Any suggestions? EDIT I have received a lot of really good response on this question - majority seem to agree on the following: taking POST variables after validation is run encrypting ccnum and cvv (not sure you are allowed to store cvv in DB at all though) Storing in temporary DB Access DB immediately after 'review' page is OK'd decrypt details from DB send information to processor receive response terminate DB I think this makes sense overall. Does anybody have good method for the encryption/decryption along with best way to create temp DB info that is automatically deleted on later call? I am programming in PHP and MySQL DB EDIT #2 I came across Packet General which seems like an ideal solution but REALLY don't want to pay for another software license to accomplish this goal. http://www.packetgeneral.com/pcigeneralformysql.html EDIT #3 - Sample Code I have now posted some example code I put together trying to make sense of the encryption/decryption/key and storage mentioned in this post. Hopefully, the already helpful contributors can validate and others are able to use similar functionality.

@TITLE:Use a handheld bluetooth printer with android
@CONTENT:I have a bluetooth Handheld printer that I am able to communicate to using a SPP connection from my Mac(using Coolterm). When I'm trying to do the same from Android (using platform 7) I am running into multiple issues: The printer doesn't seem to support/need PIN Authentication. When connecting from OSX, I just selected the option that said "Do not use a pin" and it got paired. In Android, when I use device.createRfcommSocketToServiceRecord(), it always ends up asking me for a PIN/Key(which I don't have/need). I solved this using the reflection trick: Method m = device.getClass().getMethod("createInsecureRfcommSocket", new Class[] {int.class});
BluetoothSocket connection = (BluetoothSocket) m.invoke(device, 1);
 I am unsure whether this actually worked, but the blinking LED on the printer stops blinking, which makes me believe it did. Once I have the socket, I try to write byte data to the stream using: byte[] buffer = new byte[3];
buffer[0] = (byte) 0x8A;
buffer[1] = (byte) 0xC1;
buffer[2] = (byte) 0x04;
outStream.write(buffer);
int response = inStream.read();
mySocket.close();
 Sending the same three-byte sequence from Coolterm on OSX printed a test page from the printer. However, this seems to make the thread hang on Android(the read). Is there something I am missing out here? EDIT: This seems to work only when I set channel to 1. So that means I am on to something here.

I understand that all delegates and outlets - in fact any reference to a "parent" object, to be a good citizen and think about the object graph for a minute - should be zeroing weak references. Due to the nature of zeroing weak pointers automatically dropping to nil on the referenced object's retain count reaching zero, does this mean that setting IBOutlets to nil in viewDidUnload is now unnecessary? So, if I declare my outlet like so: @property (nonatomic, weak) IBOutlet UILabel *myLabel;
 Does the following code have any effect? - (void)viewDidUnload
{
    self.myLabel = nil;

    [super viewDidUnload];
}
@CODE:viewDidUnload @property (nonatomic, weak) IBOutlet UILabel *myLabel; - (void)viewDidUnload
{
    self.myLabel = nil;

    [super viewDidUnload];
}

@TITLE:Why use Glassfish instead of Apache? What's it strengths and weaknesses?
@CONTENT:Sorry for my ignorance here, but when I hear the word webserver, I immediately imagine Apache, although I know people use Microsoft's IIS too. However since I've been hanging out here at Stackoverflow I've noticed lots of people use Glassfish. Which made me wonder, why would I want to use Glassfish (in the sense that I'm interested, but I don't really understand why it might make my life easier). From what I read it's Sun's open-source derivate of Apache's Tomcat, thus I imagine it's a good (or great) quality product. But since I don't know its strengths and weaknesses, I don't know when it would be wise to choose Glassfish over another server. Could anyone elaborate ?

With the old one, I just ran sbt in a new folder and there was a guided wizard that led me through the setup." The accepted answer does not explain how to create a new project, it just points to the documentation, which also doesn't explicitly say how to create a new project -- only how to write a build.sbt file. So I tried first writing a build.sbt and then running sbt in the directory with the build.sbt file, but I still don't see a src directory to work with. Could someone post a simple step-by-step (I'm assuming there are like 3 steps at most) guiding how to create a new project under sbt 0.10.X?

@LINK:/questions/20586143/css-animation-vs-transition
@TITLE:CSS: Animation vs. Transition
@CONTENT:So, I understand how to perform both CSS3 transitions and animations. What is not clear, and I've googled, is when to use which. For example, if I want to make a ball bounce, it is clear that animation is the way to go. I could provide keyframes and the browser would do the intermediates frames and I'll have a nice animation going. However, there are cases when a said effect can be achieved either way. A simple and common example would be implement the facebook style sliding drawer menu: This effect can be achieved through transitions like so: .sf-page {
    -webkit-transition: -webkit-transform .2s ease-out;
}

.sf-page.out {
    -webkit-transform: translateX(240px);
}
 http://jsfiddle.net/NwEGz/ Or, through animations like so: .sf-page {
    -webkit-animation-duration: .4s;
    -webkit-transition-timing-function: ease-out;
}

.sf-page.in {
    -webkit-animation-name: sf-slidein;
    -webkit-transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0);
}

.sf-page.out {
    -webkit-animation-name: sf-slideout;
    -webkit-transform: translateX(240px);
}

@-webkit-keyframes sf-slideout {
    from { -webkit-transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0); }
    to { -webkit-transform: translate3d(240px, 0, 0); }
}

@-webkit-keyframes sf-slidein {
    from { -webkit-transform: translate3d(240px, 0, 0); }
    to { -webkit-transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0); }
}
 http://jsfiddle.net/4Z5Mr/ With HTML that looks like so: <div class="sf-container">
    <div class="sf-page in" id="content-container">
        <button type="button">Click Me</button>
    </div>
    <div class="sf-drawer">
    </div>
</div>
 And, this accompanying jQuery script: $("#content-container").click(function(){
    $("#content-container").toggleClass("out");
    // below is only required for css animation route
    $("#content-container").toggleClass("in");
});
 What I'd like to understand is what are the pros and cons of these approaches. One obvious difference is that animating is taking a whole lot more code. Animation gives better flexibility. I can have different animation for sliding out and in Is there something that can be said about performance. Do both take advantage of h/w acceleration? Which is more modern and the way going forward Anything else you could add?
@CODE:.sf-page {
    -webkit-transition: -webkit-transform .2s ease-out;

@LINK:/questions/7322943/c-sharp-asynchronous-options-for-processing-a-list
@TITLE:C# Asynchronous Options for Processing a List
@CONTENT:I am trying to better understand the Async and the Parallel options I have in C#. In the snippets below, I have included the 5 approaches I come across most. But I am not sure which to choose - or better yet, what criteria to consider when choosing: Method 1: Task (see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd321439.aspx) Calling StartNew is functionally equivalent to creating a Task using one of its constructors and then calling Start to schedule it for execution. However, unless creation and scheduling must be separated, StartNew is the recommended approach for both simplicity and performance. TaskFactory's StartNew method should be the preferred mechanism for creating and scheduling computational tasks, but for scenarios where creation and scheduling must be separated, the constructors may be used, and the task's Start method may then be used to schedule the task for execution at a later time. // using System.Threading.Tasks.Task.Factory
void Do_1()
{
    var _List = GetList();
    _List.ForEach(i => Task.Factory.StartNew(_ => { DoSomething(i); }));
}
 Method 2: QueueUserWorkItem (see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.threadpool.getmaxthreads.aspx) You can queue as many thread pool requests as system memory allows. If there are more requests than thread pool threads, the additional requests remain queued until thread pool threads become available. You can place data required by the queued method in the instance fields of the class in which the method is defined, or you can use the QueueUserWorkItem(WaitCallback, Object) overload that accepts an object containing the necessary data. // using System.Threading.ThreadPool
void Do_2()
{
    var _List = GetList();
    var _Action = new WaitCallback((o) => { DoSomething(o); });
    _List.ForEach(x => ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(_Action));
}
 Method 3: Parallel.Foreach (see: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.tasks.parallel.foreach.aspx) The Parallel class provides library-based data parallel replacements for common operations such as for loops, for each loops, and execution of a set of statements. The body delegate is invoked once for each element in the source enumerable. It is provided with the current element as a parameter. // using System.Threading.Tasks.Parallel
void Do_3()
{
    var _List = GetList();
    var _Action = new Action<object>((o) => { DoSomething(o); });
    Parallel.ForEach(_List, _Action);
}
 Method 4: IAsync.BeginInvoke (see: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc190824.aspx) BeginInvoke is asynchronous; therefore, control returns immediately to the calling object after it is called. // using IAsync.BeginInvoke()
void Do_4()
{
    var _List = GetList();
    var _Action = new Action<object>((o) => { DoSomething(o); });
    _List.ForEach(x => _Action.BeginInvoke(x, null, null));
}
 Method 5: BackgroundWorker (see: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.componentmodel.backgroundworker.aspx) To set up for a background operation, add an event handler for the DoWork event. Call your time-consuming operation in this event handler. To start the operation, call RunWorkerAsync. To receive notifications of progress updates, handle the ProgressChanged event. To receive a notification when the operation is completed, handle the RunWorkerCompleted event. // using System.ComponentModel.BackgroundWorker
void Do_5()
{
    var _List = GetList();
    using (BackgroundWorker _Worker = new BackgroundWorker())
    {
        _Worker.DoWork += (s, arg) =>
        {
            arg.Result = arg.Argument;
            DoSomething(arg.Argument);
        };
        _Worker.RunWorkerCompleted += (s, arg) =>
        {
            _List.Remove(arg.Result);
            if (_List.Any())
                _Worker.RunWorkerAsync(_List[0]);
        };
        if (_List.Any())
            _Worker.RunWorkerAsync(_List[0]);
    }
}
 I suppose the obvious critieria would be: Is any better than the other for performance? Is any better than the other for error handling? Is any better than the other for monitoring/feedback? But, how do you choose? Thanks in advance for your insights.

I have tried different oauth libraries such as oauth, oauth2 and djanog-oauth but I cannot get it to work (including the provided examples). For debugging Oauth I use Google's Oauth Playground and I have studied the API and the Oauth documentation With some libraries I am struggling with getting a right signature, with other libraries I am struggling with converting the request token to an authorized token. What would really help me if someone can show me a working example for the Google API using one of the above-mentioned libraries.

@TITLE:Hashes of Hashes Idiom in Ruby?
@CONTENT:Creating hashes of hashes in Ruby allows for convenient two (or more) dimensional lookups. However, when inserting one must always check if the first index already exists in the hash. For example: h = Hash.new
h['x'] = Hash.new if not h.key?('x')
h['x']['y'] = value_to_insert
 It would be preferable to do the following where the new Hash is created automatically: h = Hash.new
h['x']['y'] = value_to_insert
 Similarly, when looking up a value where the first index doesn't already exist, it would be preferable if nil is returned rather than receiving an undefined method for '[]' error. looked_up_value = h['w']['z']
 One could create a Hash wrapper class that has this behavior, but is there an existing a Ruby idiom for accomplishing this task?
@CODE:h = Hash.new
h['x'] = Hash.new if not h.key?('x')
h['x']['y'] = value_to_insert h = Hash.new
h['x']['y'] = value_to_insert looked_up_value = h['w']['z']

@CONTENT:I've been looking all over but have had little luck. Are there any well documented .NET binding implementations for OpenCL? (I'd take something for CUDA if I had to). I've run into a variety of implementations, CUDA.NET, OpenCL.NET, OpenTK / Cloo (I know, they are mentioned often of stackoverflow), but they all seem to either be in alpha stage or have absolutely no available examples. CUDA.NET has some help files, but it's just a library reference, which doesn't really help you get started. What I'm hoping to find is a mature library for GPU programming in .NET. Eventually I need to be able to write the code in F#, but I would take any .NET compliant language as I could always just convert it later and use whatever examples are included to get up and running. Probably a long shot since I've searched all over, but I'm hoping this is just one of those case where I don't know the right thing to search for. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

@CONTENT:I have always loved the idea of AI and evolutionary algorithms. Unfortunately as we all know the field hasnt developed nearly as fast as expected in the early days. What I am looking for are some examples that have the wow factor: Self directed learning systems that adapted in unexpected ways. Game agents that were particularly dynamic and produced unexpected strategies Symbolic representation systems that actually produced some meaningful and insightful output Interesting emergent behaviour in multiple agent systems. Lets not get into the semantics of what defines AI. If it looks or sounds like AI, lets hear about it. I'll go first with a story from 1997. Dr Adrian Thompson is trying to use genetic algorithms to create a voice recognition circuit in an FPGA. After a few thousand generations he succeeds in having the device distinguish between 'stop' and 'go' voice commands. He examines the structure of the device and finds that some active logic gates are disconnected from the rest of the circuit. When he disables these supposedly useless gates, the circuit stops working... http://www.damninteresting.com/on-the-origin-of-circuits Dr Adrian Thompson: http://www.cogs.susx.ac.uk/users/adrianth/ade.html edit: Can we try and keep the discussion to techniques/algorithms that produced something impressive?

@TITLE:NSNull handling for NSManagedObject properties values
@CONTENT:I'm setting values for properties of my NSManagedObject, these values are coming from a NSDictionary properly serialized from a JSON file. My problem is, that, when some value is [NSNull null], I can't assign directly to the property:     fight.winnerID = [dict objectForKey:@"winner"];
 this throws a NSInvalidArgumentException "winnerID"; desired type = NSString; given type = NSNull; value = <null>;
 I could easily check the value for [NSNull null] and assign nil instead: fight.winnerID = [dict objectForKey:@"winner"] == [NSNull null] ? nil : [dict objectForKey:@"winner"];
 But I think this is not elegant and gets messy with lots of properties to set. Also, this gets harder when dealing with NSNumber properties: fight.round = [NSNumber numberWithUnsignedInteger:[[dict valueForKey:@"round"] unsignedIntegerValue]]
 The NSInvalidArgumentException is now: [NSNull unsignedIntegerValue]: unrecognized selector sent to instance
 In this case I have to treat [dict valueForKey:@"round"] before making an NSUInteger value of it. And the one line solution is gone. I tried making a @try @catch block, but as soon as the first value is caught, it jumps the whole @try block and the next properties are ignored. Is there a better way to handle [NSNull null] or perhaps make this entirely different but easier?

@CONTENT:I have noticed that a recurring question is: ¡§What is a good network graph library for language X¡¨. I have played with quite a few of the libraries and I can share my experiences with you. Python: NetworkX is a robust library which has built-in visualization but also has an interface to Graphviz using pyGraphviz. (pyGraphviz and NetworkX are written by the same author). NetworkX is open source and a very easy to use. Perl: Circos is developed to visualize genomes and other highly complex datasets. It will always use a circular layout but that it often the most appropriate layout if your network is really large and its ¡¥modularity¡¦ score is low. Circos is open source. .Net: NodeXL is developed by Microsoft Research and is both an add-on for Excel and a .Net 3.5 library. It¡¦s pretty open (for Microsoft¡¦s standards) and uses Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm for visualization. Java: JUNG2 has recently been released and is also a robust library. Has extended visualization and key metrics support. JUNG2 is open source. UbiGraph: UbiGraph has interfaces to different languages including Python (and NetworkX has UbiGraph support), Ruby, PHP, Java, C, C++, C#, Haskell, and OCaml. It has very neat 3D visualization of network graphs using an XML-RPC server. The basic version is free, you have to pay for the professional version. Standalone: You can always use an off-the-shelf package such as: Graphviz (Win, Linux, OSX), Pajek (Win), UCINET (Win), or even Visio (Win). I am sure there are many more packages, but these are the ones that I have used myself. What other libraries or packages are available?

 The thing is, I've done exactly what I've done in previous Ubuntus (was running 12.04 LTS), in short, edited the server.xml to port 80 and also changed authbind in /etc/default/tomcat7 to yes, so basically everything you have to do to run tomcat on port 80. Doing those steps on a 12.04LTS works fine, just on the 14.04LTS it now throws this "file or directory not found" error. Also when upgrading a 12.04LTS (on which tomcat runs fine on port 80) to 14.04LTS, it suddenly throws the error above, while all configuration are identical to what worked in 12.04LTS.

@TITLE:Spring Java Config: how do you create a prototype-scoped @Bean with runtime arguments?
@CONTENT:Using Spring's Java Config, I need to acquire/instantiate a prototype-scoped bean with constructor arguments that are only obtainable at runtime. Consider the following code example (simplified for brevity): @Autowired
private ApplicationContext appCtx;

public void onRequest(Request request) {
    //request is already validated
    String name = request.getParameter("name");
    Thing thing = appCtx.getBean(Thing.class, name);

    //System.out.println(thing.getName()); //prints name
}
 where the Thing class is defined as follows: public class Thing {

    private final String name;

    @Autowired
    private SomeComponent someComponent;

    @Autowired
    private AnotherComponent anotherComponent;

    public Thing(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return this.name;
    }
}
 Notice name is final: it can only be supplied via a constructor, and guarantees immutability. The other dependencies are implementation-specific dependencies of the Thing class, and shouldn't be known to (tightly coupled to) the request handler implementation. This code works perfectly well with Spring XML config, for example: <bean id="thing", class="com.whatever.Thing" scope="prototype">
    <!-- other post-instantiation properties omitted -->
</bean>
 How do I achieve the same thing with Java config? The following does not work: @Bean
@Scope("prototype")
public Thing thing(String name) {
    return new Thing(name);
}
 Now, I could create a Factory, e.g.: public interface ThingFactory {
    public Thing createThing(String name);
}
 But that defeats the entire point of using Spring to replace the ServiceLocator and Factory design pattern, which would be ideal for this use case. If Spring Java Config could do this, I would be able to avoid: defining a Factory interface defining a Factory implementation writing tests for the Factory implementation That's a ton of work (relatively speaking) for something so trivial that Spring already supports via XML config.

@TITLE:Pane Title in Tmux
@CONTENT:On my local machine I've got 3 node.js instances running simultaneously. Each has it's own pane in a tmux window called "servers". The problem is that it's not that easy to figure out which node is running in which pane, 'cause their logs are similar. What I need is a title for every pane. As I got, tmux itself doesn't have the feature: it has only titles for windows and not for panes. Launching a separate tmux session inside every pane for every node.js instance looks like an overkill. So is there some small program that launches a command, wrapping its output with a specified status bar? Thanks in advance

@TITLE:Alternative to the visitor pattern?
@CONTENT:I am looking for an alternative to the visitor pattern. Let me just focus on a couple of pertinent aspects of the pattern, while skipping over unimportant details. I'll use a Shape example (sorry!): You have a hierarchy of objects that implement the IShape interface You have a number of global operations that are to be performed on all objects in the hierarchy, e.g. Draw, WriteToXml etc... It is tempting to dive straight in and add a Draw() and WriteToXml() method to the IShape interface. This is not necessarily a good thing - whenever you wish to add a new operation that is to be performed on all shapes, each IShape-derived class must be changed Implementing a visitor for each operation i.e. a Draw visitor or a WirteToXml visitor encapsulates all the code for that operation in one class. Adding a new operation is then a matter of creating a new visitor class that performs the operation on all types of IShape When you need to add a new IShape-derived class, you essentially have the same problem as you did in 3 - all visitor classes must be changed to add a method to handle the new IShape-derived type Most places where you read about the visitor pattern state that point 5 is pretty much the main criteria for the pattern to work and I totally agree. If the number of IShape-derived classes is fixed, then this can be a quite elegant approach. So, the problem is when a new IShape-derived class is added - each visitor implementation needs to add a new method to handle that class. This is, at best, unpleasant and, at worst, not possible and shows that this pattern is not really designed to cope with such changes. So, the question is has anybody come across alterative approaches to handling this situation?

However, it also talks about using a form for the response which the user must submit (although it does talk about using JavaScript to automatically submit the form). Is this the standard way of doing this? Using redirects and JavaScript for form submission? Does anyone know of any other good resources about how to go about implementing SSO between a Windows Domain and a J2EE web application. The web application is on a separate network/domain.

@CONTENT:I recently tried switching from using python-mode.el to python.el for editing python files in emacs, found the experience a little alien and unproductive, and scurried back. I've been using python-mode.el for something like ten years, so perhaps I'm a little set in my ways. I'd be interested in hearing from anyone who's carefully evaluated the two modes, in particular of the pros and cons they perceive of each and how their work generally interacts with the features specific to python.el. The two major issues for me with python.el were Each buffer visiting a python file gets its own inferior interactive python shell. I am used to doing development in one interactive shell and sharing data between python files. (Might seem like bad practice from a software-engineering perspective, but I'm usually working with huge datasets which take a while to load into memory.) The skeleton-mode support in python.el, which seemed absolutely gratuitous (python's syntax makes such automation unnecessary) and badly designed (for instance, it has no knowledge of "for" loop generator expressions or "<expr 1> if <cond> else <expr 2>" expressions, so you have to go back and remove the colons it helpfully inserts after insisting that you enter the expression clauses in the minibuffer.) I couldn't figure out how to turn it off. There was a python.el variable which claimed to control this, but it didn't seem to work. It could be that the version of python.el I was using was broken (it came from the debian emacs-snapshot package) so if anyone knows of an up-to-date version of it, I'd like to hear about it. (I had the same problem with the version in CVS emacs as of approximately two weeks ago.)

I've decided to bring it up once again hoping there might be new thoughts and ideas around this issue and other workarounds are proposed. At least I'm just curious why this operation takes so long time to run. Well, the problem is: I have to update 30K entities into database (EF 4.1, POCO). The entity type is quite simple containing integer Id + other 4 integer properties with no relations to other types. 2 cases: all them are new records. Running context.Entities.Add(entity) one by one for every entity takes 90 seconds with Cntx.Configuration.AutoDetectChangesEnabled=false (true value makes it run forever). Then SaveChanges takes just a second. Other approach: attaching it to the context like this takes the same 90 sec: Cntx.Entities.Attach(entity);
Cntx.Entry(entity).State = EntityState.Added;
 all them are existing records with some changes. In the case it takes just few milliseconds to attach it to existing data context like this: Cntx.Entities.Attach(entity);
Cntx.Entry(entity).State = EntityState.Modified;
 See the difference? What is behind the scene of Add method that makes it work so incredibly slow?
@CODE:Cntx.Entities.Attach(entity);
Cntx.Entry(entity).State = EntityState.Added; Cntx.Entities.Attach(entity);

@LINK:/questions/666216/decorator-classes-in-python
@TITLE:Decorator classes in Python
@CONTENT:I want to construct classes for use as decorators with the following principles intact: It should be possible to stack multiple such class decorators on top off 1 function. The resulting function name pointer should be indistinguishable from the same function without a decorator, save maybe for just which type/class it is. Ordering off the decorators should not be relevant unless actually mandated by the decorators. Ie. independent decorators could be applied in any order. This is for a Django project, and the specific case I am working on now the method needs 2 decorators, and to appear as a normal python function: @AccessCheck
@AutoTemplate
def view(request, item_id) {}
 @AutoTemplate changes the function so that instead of returning a HttpResponse, it just returns a dictionary for use in the context. A RequestContext is used, and the template name is inferred from the method name and module. @AccessCheck adds additional checks on the user based on the item_id. I am guessing it's just to get the constructor right and copy the appropriate attributes, but which attributes are these? The following decorator won't work as I describe: class NullDecl (object):
    def __init__ (self, func):
        self.func = func
    def __call__ (self, * args):
        return self.func (*args)
 As demonstrated by the following code: @NullDecl
@NullDecl
def decorated():
    pass

def pure():
    pass

# results in set(['func_closure', 'func_dict', '__get__', 'func_name',
# 'func_defaults', '__name__', 'func_code', 'func_doc', 'func_globals'])
print set(dir(pure)) - set(dir(decorated));
 Additionally, try and add "print func.name" in the NullDecl constructor, and it will work for the first decorator, but not the second - as name will be missing. Refined eduffy's answer a bit, and it seems to work pretty well: class NullDecl (object):
    def __init__ (self, func):
        self.func = func
        for n in set(dir(func)) - set(dir(self)):
            setattr(self, n, getattr(func, n))

@CONTENT:I'm looking for a database matching these criteria: May be non-persistent; Almost all keys of DB need to be updated once in 3-6 hours (100M+ keys with total size of 100Gb) Ability to quickly select data by key (or Primary Key) This needs to be a DBMS (so LevelDB doesn't fit) When data is written, DB cluster must be able to serve queries (single nodes can be blocked though) Not in-memory ¡V our dataset will exceed the RAM limits Horizontal scaling and replication Support full rewrite of all data (MongoDB doesn't clear space after deleting data) C# and Java support Here's my process of working with such database: We've got an analytics cluster that produces 100M records (50GB) of data every 4-6 hours. The data is a "key - array[20]". This data needs to be distributed to users through a front-end system with a rate of 1-10k requests per second. In average, only ~15% of the data is requested, the rest of it will be rewritten in 4-6 hours when the next data set is generated. What i tried: MongoDB. Datastorage overhead, high defragmentation costs. Redis. Looks perfect, but it's limited with RAM and our data exceeds it. So the question is: is there anything like Redis, but not limited with RAM size?

@TITLE:How can I use UIModalTransitionStylePartialCurl on a UIView that does NOT take up the whole screen?
@CONTENT:In Apple's official Maps app for the iPhone, there is a small 'page curl' button in the lower-right corner. When you press it, the map itself peels back to reveal some options. I would like to duplicate this effect in my own app. I'm trying to use UIModalTransitionStylePartialCurl (Added in SDK 3.2). In terms of its layout, my app resembles Apple's official Maps app almost exactly. I can easily get the ENTIRE screen to peel back, revealing another view underneath, but I don't want this. I want ONLY the map view to peel back. In order to create this effect, you must have a UIViewController that will perform the transition. If I set this UIViewController's view to a small subview somewhere on the screen that does not take up the entire screen, I can get just that subview to peel back. That's great! However, after the second part of the transition (when the page falls back into place), the views are never where they started. Either the view that peeled back will have moved from its original position, or the view that was revealed will have expanded to take up the entire screen. Is there any obvious mistake that I'm making? I would really appreciate any help! The code I'm using is really simple. It's basically just: underMapViewController.modalTransitionStyle = UIModalTransitionStylePartialCurl;

[curlableMapViewController presentModalViewController:underMapViewController animated:YES];
@CODE:underMapViewController.modalTransitionStyle = UIModalTransitionStylePartialCurl;

@TITLE:Improving Your Build Process
@CONTENT:Or, actually establishing a build process when there isn't much of one in place to begin with. Currently, that's pretty much the situation my group faces. We do web-app development primarily (but no desktop development at this time). Software deployments are ugly and unwieldy even with our modest apps, and we've had far too many issues crop up in the two years I have been a part of this team (and company). It's past time to do something about that, and the upshot is that we'll be able to kill two Joel Test birds with one stone (daily builds and one-step builds, neither of which exists in any form whatsoever). What I'm after here is some general insight on the kinds of things I need to be doing or thinking about, from people who have been in software development for longer than I have and also have bigger brains. I'm confident that will be most of the people currently posting in the beta. Relevant Tools: Visual Build Source Safe 6.0 (I know, but I can't do anything about whether or not we use Source Safe at this time. That might be the next battle I fight.) Tentatively, I've got a Visual Build project that does this: Get source and place in local directory, including necessary DLLs needed for project. Get config files and rename as needed (we're storing them in a special sub directory that isn't part of the actual application, and they are named according to use). Build using Visual Studio Precompile using command line, copying into what will be a "build" directory Copy to destination. Get any necessary additional resources - mostly things like documents, images, and reports that are associated with the project (and put into directory from step 5). There's a lot of this stuff, and I didn't want to include it previously. However, I'm going to only copy changed items, so maybe it's irrelevant. I wasn't sure whether I really wanted to include this stuff in earlier steps. I still need to coax some logging out of Visual Build for all of this, but I'm not at a point where I need to do that yet. Does anyone have any advice or suggestions to make? We're not currently using a Deployment Project, I'll note. It would remove some of the steps necessary in this build I presume (like web.config swapping).

@TITLE:Make Ad-hoc builds in Xcode 6 without signing in to developer account
@CONTENT:Before Xcode 6, it was sufficient to provide only a *.p12 certificate and *.mobileprovision file to Xcode in order to export an *.ipa file for Ad Hoc builds. Xcode 6 opens the Organizer as usual when the archive is ready, but when I press the "Export" button, the Organizer asks to select a Development Team. It does not allow me to proceed without one even though I have *.p12 and *.mobileprovision installed. To save for Ad Hoc Development, select a Development Team to use for provisioning: I know that a developer account could be exported from Xcode accounts pane, but there is a problem with that. It exports all certificates and mobileprovision files associated with it. This includes other profiles that I don't want to include (because I want to share the resulting export with a project team and don't want to include non-relevant profiles). Is there any way to avoid this "helpful" feature and just export the relevant *.p12 and *.mobileprovision?

 I omitted the code used for styling. You can see all of it in the pen. The above works, but when the content area's content overflows, it makes the whole page scroll. I only want the content area itself to scroll, so I added overflow: auto to the content div. The problem with this now is that the columns themselves don't extend beyond their parents height, so the borders are cut off there too. Here's the pen showing the scrolling issue. How can I set the content area to scroll independently, while still having its children extend beyond the content box's height?

@TITLE:Good Ways to Visualize Longitudinal Categorical Data in R
@CONTENT:[Update: Although I've accepted an answer, please add another answer if you have additional visualization ideas (whether in R or another language/program). Texts on categorical data analysis don't seem to say much about visualizing longitudinal data, while texts on longitudinal data analysis don't seem to say much about visualizing within-subject changes over time in category membership. Having more answers to this question will make it a better resource on an issue that doesn't get much coverage in standard references.] A colleague just gave me a longitudinal categorical data set to look at and I'm trying to figure out how to capture the longitudinal aspect in a visualization. I'm posting here, because I'd like to do this in R, but please let me know if it makes sense to also cross-post to Cross-Validated, since cross-posting is generally discouraged. Quick background: The data track the academic standing from term to term for students who went through an academic advising program. The data are in long format and have five variables: "id", "cohort", "term", "standing", and "termGPA". The first two identify the student and the term in which they were in the advising program. The last three are the terms when the student's academic standing and GPA were recorded. I've pasted in some sample data below using dput. I've created a mosaic plot (see below) that groups students by cohort, standing, and term. This shows what fraction of students were in each academic-standing category in each term. But this doesn't capture the longitudinal aspect--the fact that individual students are tracked over time. I'd like to track the path that groups of students with a given academic standing take over time. For example: Of students with standing "AP" (academic probation) in Fall 2009 ("F09"), what fraction were still AP in future terms, and what fraction moved into other categories (e.g., GS, "good standing")? Are there differences between cohorts in terms of movement between categories with time since entry into the advising program? I couldn't quite figure out how to capture this longitudinal aspect in an R graphic. The vcd package has facilities for visualizing categorical data, but doesn't seem to address longitudinal categorical data. Are there "standard" methods for visualizing longitudinal categorical data? Does R have packages designed for this? Is long format appropriate for this type of data or would I be better off with wide format? I would appreciate suggestions for solving this particular problem and also suggestions for articles, books, etc. for learning more about visualizing longitudinal categorical data. Here's the code I used to make the mosaic plot. The code uses the data listed below with dput. library(RColorBrewer)

# create a table object for plotting
df1.tab = table(df1$cohort, df1$term, df1$standing,
            dnn=c("Cohort\nAcademic Standing", "Term", "Standing"))

# create a mosaic plot
plot(df1.tab, las=1, dir=c("h","v","h"), 
     col=brewer.pal(8,"Dark2"),
     main="Fall 2009 and Fall 2010 Cohorts")
 Here's the mosaic plot (side question: is there any way to make the columns for the F10 cohort sit directly under and have the same width as the columns for the F09 cohort, even when there's no data for some terms in the F10 cohort?): And here's the data used to create the table and the plot: df1 =

@TITLE:MySQL `FORCE INDEX` use cases?
@CONTENT:Almost everywhere I read the use of FORCE INDEX is highly discouraged and I perfectly understand and know why - there are immensely huge chances that MySQL knows better what indexes to choose than the (average) developer. However, recently I have found a case where FORCE INDEX improved my execution times in the range of hundred of times: JOIN on 4 tables first table has about 500 000 records 2 of the INNER JOINed table have more than 1 milion records first table has a field called published_date, stored as varchar in YMD format (could not changed to datetime) needed a range on published_date of at most 5 000 records some other GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses on the first table on different fields than published_date were needed for this query Although I've rewritten the query in many ways, I was not able to get execution times smaller than 130 seconds (with highest being over 700 ). After using FORCE INDEX with published_date, the execution time dropped below 5 seconds. It took me a few days to remember about the infamous FORCE INDEX option. Questions: What are other use cases you found where FORCE INDEX saved you? Do you have some best practices when you consider using FORCE INDEX? Edit - Obsevations: I created this blog post with the question here also. All the answer you provide will appear there too - whith credits and all the stuff you want. Edit 2 I applied the suggestions I received in your comments (ANALYZE TABLE and OPTIMIZE TABLE), below is the output of EXPLAIN applied on query - unfortunately the index selection is not at all better: 1. without FORCE INDEX on table with alias a: id  select_type table   type    possible_keys   key key_len ref rows    Extra

@CONTENT:So I know you can get Vim autocompletion with Ctrl-X, Ctrl-O but I'm wondering if you could rework it so it works with just pressing Tab (more like Textmate's snippets), or even just how I could remap it to something a bit shorter (even if I can't get fancy tab completion), as I find Ctrl-X, Ctrl-O a bit awkward.

@TITLE:Understanding how JS Module Pattern works
@CONTENT:I'm trying to understand js module patterns in use with jQuery. I've edited this a couple of times and will try to end up with a good practice for my skill level (a couple of months fresh on jquery). There's no direct question in this post. I'm more aiming for feedback and inputs on how to properly use the module pattern (together with jquery) in a large scale website.

 Trying to understand what's happening (Feel free to provide corrections or better explanations): Company.AppName = (function ($) { ...
 Here the namespace Company.AppName is created. I set ($) inside so I can use the $ without it conflicting with any other libraries that might use $. })(jQuery); 
 As far as I know, the methods and variables are returned to the namespace here ...})(); and by adding jQuery inside () it'll tell it that the $ means jQuery. Initializing I'm not sure what's best practice here, but I'll add what I know so far. Initializing within js file: jQuery(function() { 
    AppLaunch.Admin.init();
});
 Initializing from a file: <script type="text/javascript">
// Shorthand for jQuery(document).ready(function() { ... }

jQuery(function($) { 
    AppLaunch.Admin.init($('#someSelector'));     
});

@TITLE:Understanding the Domain object + Data mapper pattern?
@CONTENT:I've always worked with various ORM's in the past and placed all my logic inside my models regardless of it's nature - SQL, MongoDB queries & even fetching of remote JSON objects. But when it's necessary to ensure loose couplings to allow a high level of testability, the issues of this methodology quickly appears. Today I've read about separating models into two parts, Domain objects & Data mappers. If I understood it completely, Domain objects are completely unaware of the storage used, and instead exists to handle business logic. Data mappers on the other hand takes care of storing the data set in the Domain objects to a set data storage. I do however find it a bit hard to find a good, easy-to-understand example online on how to work with the DomainObjects & DataMappers in a real world example. Would this (below shown code) be the appropriate way to work with DomainObjects & DataMappers in my code to store Users or have I gotten it all wrong in my head? $user = new User_DO;
$userSave = new User_DM;
$userSave->store( $user->add(array('name' => 'John Doe')) );

I am thinking of using the the following strategy (taken from http://www.techrepublic.com/article/developing-a-css-strategy/5437796/) which seems logical to me... you might have one CSS file devoted to sitewide styles and separate CSS files for identifiable subsets of site pages (such as pages for a specific department or pages with a different layout style). For styles that are unique to a specific page, use a separate CSS file for each page (if there are too many styles to fit comfortably in the document header). You link or import the appropriate CSS files for each page, so that you load all the styles needed to display that page, but very few unnecessary styles that only appear on other pages. Is this a good way to proceed? What are the alternatives?

@LINK:/questions/6525905/how-does-scheduleswitch-to-functions-from-linux-kernel-actually-work
@TITLE:How does schedule()+switch_to() functions from linux kernel actually work?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to understand how the schedule process in linux kernel actually works. My question is not about the scheduling algorithm. Its about how the functions schedule() and switch_to() work. I'll try to explain. I saw that: When a process runs out of time-slice, the flag need_resched is set by scheduler_tick(). The kernel checks the flag, sees that it is set, and calls schedule() (pertinent to question 1) to switch to a new process. This flag is a message that schedule should be invoked as soon as possible because another process deserves to run. Upon returning to user-space or returning from an interrupt, the need_resched flag is checked. If it is set, the kernel invokes the scheduler before continuing. Looking into the kernel source (linux-2.6.10 - version that the book "Linux Kernel Development, second edition" is based on), I also saw that some codes can call the schedule() function voluntarily, giving another process the right to run. I saw that the function switch_to() is the one that actually does the context switch. I looked into some architecture dependent codes, trying to understand what switch_to() was actually doing. That behavior raised some questions that I could not find the answers for : When switch_to() finishes, what is the current running process? The process that called schedule()? Or the next process, the one that was picked to run? When schedule() gets called by an interrupt, the selected process to run starts to run when the interrupt handling finishes (after some kind of RTE) ? Or before that? If the schedule() function can not be called from an interrupt, when is the flag- need_resched set? When the timer interrupt handler is working, what stack is being used? I don't know if I could make myself clear. If I couldn't, I hope I can do this after some answers (or questions). I already looked at several sources trying to understand that process. I have the book "Linux Kernel Development, sec ed", and I'm using it too. I know a bit about MIPs and H8300 architecture, if that help to explain. I'm sorry for my poor english.

@TITLE:Value Objects in CQRS - where to use
@CONTENT:Let's say we have CQRS-inspired architecture, with components such as Commands, Domain Model, Domain Events, Read Model DTOs. Of course, we can use Value Objects in our Domain Model. My question is, should they also be used in: Commands Events DTOs I haven't seen any examples where Value Objects (VO) are used in the components mentioned above. Instead, primitive types are used. Maybe it's just the simplistic examples. After all, my understanding of VOs use in DDD is that they act as a glue for the whole application. My motivation: Commands. Let's say user submits a form which contains address fields. We have Address Value Object to represent this concept. When constructing command in the client, we should validate user input anyway, and when it is well-formed, we can create Address object right there and initialize Command with it. I see no need to delegate creation of Address object to command handler. Domain Events. Domain Model already operates in terms of Value Objects, so by publishing events with VOs instead of converting them to primitive types, we can avoid some mapping code. I'm pretty sure it's alright to use VOs in this case. DTOs. If our query-side DTOs can contain Value Objects, this allows for some more flexibility. E.g., if we have Money object, we can choose whether to display it in EUR or USD, no need to change Read Model.

@TITLE:Speeding Up the First Page Load in django
@CONTENT:When I update the code on my website I (naturally) restart my apache instance so that the changes will take effect. Unfortunately the first page served by each apache instance is quite slow while it loads everything into RAM for the first time (5-7 sec for this particular site). Subsequent requests only take 0.5 - 1.5 seconds so I would like to eliminate this effect for my users. Is there a better way to get everything loaded into RAM than to do a wget x times (where x is the number of apache instances defined by ServerLimit in my http.conf) Writing a restart script that restarts apache and runs wget 5 times seems kind of hacky to me. Thanks!

@CONTENT:Update: I deleted my motivation because it seems to distract readers. This is not about "why don't you make your window smaller". See the screenshots and you will see obstructed text because of fixed width. See my reference to "em/ex" notation in CSS. I would like to have a real discussion here. Thank you. Now I would like to ask real experts on this topic -- I'm not a web designer -- why fixed width layout are still that popular and if there are really good reasons for it. (you are welcome to point out reasons against it as well.) Is it too hard to design your layout relatively (from start on)? It seems some people even forgot how to do it. Do you have real reasons like readability and just don't know how to deal with it correctly? Here I'm referring to pieces of wisdom, like it's harder to read longer lines (that's why newspapers use columns) -- but then, width should be given using em and ex. Are you forced by some old guidelines? In the dark old age of HTML, people did a lot of things wrong; now everybody finally uses CSS, but perhaps this one just sticked. Or are you like me, wondering why everybody is doing it "wrong"? To illustrate the issue, I want to give screenshots of negative examples first: StackOverflow (here I can't even see what would make it any hard to fix it) Filmstarts (a german website which renders itself unreadable-if I don't take a reading-glass with me) And here is a positive example.

@LINK:/questions/12516/expression-evaluation-and-tree-walking-using-polymorphism-ala-steve-yegge
@TITLE:Expression Evaluation and Tree Walking using polymorphism? (ala Steve Yegge)
@CONTENT:This morning, I was reading Steve Yegge's: When Polymorphism Fails, when I came across a question that a co-worker of his used to ask potential employees when they came for their interview at Amazon. As an example of polymorphism in action, let's look at the classic "eval" interview question, which (as far as I know) was brought to Amazon by Ron Braunstein. The question is quite a rich one, as it manages to probe a wide variety of important skills: OOP design, recursion, binary trees, polymorphism and runtime typing, general coding skills, and (if you want to make it extra hard) parsing theory. At some point, the candidate hopefully realizes that you can represent an arithmetic expression as a binary tree, assuming you're only using binary operators such as "+", "-", "*", "/". The leaf nodes are all numbers, and the internal nodes are all operators. Evaluating the expression means walking the tree. If the candidate doesn't realize this, you can gently lead them to it, or if necessary, just tell them. Even if you tell them, it's still an interesting problem. The first half of the question, which some people (whose names I will protect to my dying breath, but their initials are Willie Lewis) feel is a Job Requirement If You Want To Call Yourself A Developer And Work At Amazon, is actually kinda hard. The question is: how do you go from an arithmetic expression (e.g. in a string) such as "2 + (2)" to an expression tree. We may have an ADJ challenge on this question at some point. The second half is: let's say this is a 2-person project, and your partner, who we'll call "Willie", is responsible for transforming the string expression into a tree. You get the easy part: you need to decide what classes Willie is to construct the tree with. You can do it in any language, but make sure you pick one, or Willie will hand you assembly language. If he's feeling ornery, it will be for a processor that is no longer manufactured in production. You'd be amazed at how many candidates boff this one. I won't give away the answer, but a Standard Bad Solution involves the use of a switch or case statment (or just good old-fashioned cascaded-ifs). A Slightly Better Solution involves using a table of function pointers, and the Probably Best Solution involves using polymorphism. I encourage you to work through it sometime. Fun stuff! So, let's try to tackle the problem all three ways. How do you go from an arithmetic expression (e.g. in a string) such as "2 + (2)" to an expression tree using cascaded-if's, a table of function pointers, and/or polymorphism? Feel free to tackle one, two, or all three. [update: title modified to better match what most of the answers have been.]

@TITLE:Learning to understand plyr, ddply
@CONTENT:I've been attempting to understand what and how plyr works through trying different variables and functions and seeing what results. So I'm more looking for an explanation of how plyr works than specific fix it answers. I've read the documentation but my newbie brain is still not getting it. Some data and names: mydf<- data.frame(c("a","a","b","b","c","c"),c("e","e","e","e","e","e")
                  ,c(1,2,3,10,20,30),
                  c(5,10,20,20,15,10))
colnames(mydf)<-c("Model", "Class","Length", "Speed")
mydf
 Question 1: Summarise versus Transform Syntax So if I Enter: ddply(mydf, .(Model), summarise, sum = Length+Length) I get: `Model ..1
1     a   2
2     a   4
3     b   6
4     b  20
5     c  40
6     c  60
 and if I enter: ddply(mydf, .(Model), summarise, Length+Length) I get the same result. Now if use transform: ddply(mydf, .(Model), transform, sum = (Length+Length)) I get:   Model Class Length Speed sum
1     a     e      1     5   2
2     a     e      2    10   4
3     b     e      3    20   6
4     b     e     10    20  20
5     c     e     20    15  40
6     c     e     30    10  60
 But if I state it like the first summarise : ddply(mydf, .(Model), transform, (Length+Length))   Model Class Length Speed
1     a     e      1     5
2     a     e      2    10
3     b     e      3    20
4     b     e     10    20
5     c     e     20    15
6     c     e     30    10
 So why does adding "sum =" make a difference? Question 2: Why don't these work? ddply(mydf, .(Model), sum, Length+Length) #Error in function (i) : object 'Length' not found ddply(mydf, .(Model), length, mydf$Length) #Error in .fun(piece, ...) : 
 2 arguments passed to 'length' which requires 1 These examples are more to show that somewhere I'm fundamentally not understanding how to use plyr. Any anwsers or explanations are appreciated.

@TITLE:Beagleboard bare metal programming
@CONTENT:I just got my BeagleBoard-Xm and I'm wondering if there is any detailed step by step tutorials on how to get a very simple bare metal software running on the hardware? The reason I ask is I want to deeply understand how the hardware architecture works, everything from the bootloader, linkers, interrupts, exceptions, MMU etc. I figured the best way is to get a simple hello world program to execute on the beagleboard xm without an OS. Nothing advanced, just start up the board and get a "hello world" output on the screen. thats it! The next step would be getting an tiny OS to run, that can schedule some very simple tasks. No filesystem needed, just to understand the basics of the OS. Any help appreciated! Best Regards Mr Gigu

@TITLE:How to use PendingIntent to communicate from a Service to a client/Activity?
@CONTENT:I have been reading the following text on the Android Developers Site, specifically under the Framework Topics -> Services -> Starting a Service. There it states the following : If the service does not also provide binding, the intent delivered with startService() is the only mode of communication between the application component and the service. However, if you want the service to send a result back, then the client that starts the service can create a PendingIntent for a broadcast (with getBroadcast()) and deliver it to the service in the Intent that starts the service. The service can then use the broadcast to deliver a result. I have a couple of questions regarding this : Does this text both apply to Services and IntentServices ? How (codewise) should this be achieved from within the Service; The service can then use the broadcast to deliver a result. and also where would the mentioned broadcast deliver the result to the original client/activity? Is there some method that should be overwritten (like onActivityResult()) or something?

@TITLE:Which Java thread is hogging the CPU?
@CONTENT:Let's say your Java program is taking 100% CPU. It has 50 threads. You need to find which thread is guilty. I have not found a tool that can help. Currently I use the following very time consuming routine: Run jstack <pid>, where pid is the process id of a Java process. The easy way to find it is to run another utility included in the JDK - jps. It is better to redirect jstack's output to a file. Search for "runnable" threads. Skip those that wait on a socket (for some reason they are still marked runnable). Repeat steps 1 and 2 a couple of times and see if you can locate a pattern. Alternatively, you could attach to a Java process in Eclipse and try to suspend threads one by one, until you hit the one that hogs CPU. On a one-CPU machine, you might need to first reduce the Java process's priority to be able to move around. Even then, Eclipse often isn't able to attach to a running process due to a timeout. I would have expected Sun's visualvm tool to do this. Does anybody know of a better way?

Database.Initialize(true);
WebSecurity.InitializeDatabaseConnection(DEFAULTCONNECTION, "UserProfile", "UserId", "UserName", autoCreateTables: true);

@TITLE:Pattern to manage views in backbone
@CONTENT:Coming from GWT, Backbone seems to miss a built-in solution on how to handle the life-cycle of a view. In GWT, every activity, which is more or less the equivalent to a View in Backbone, is managed by an ActivityManager which calls onStart/onStop on the activity, passing the eventBus and the element where the Activity can be rendered in. On stop, the ActivityManager will unbind all events the activity has bind to the eventbus and remove the view from the DOM. In Backbone, it's easy to bind the events to model and collection but you have to remove them manually and there is no common api method where you will do this. So I'm looking for best practice pattern on how to manage views to ensure no killed or disabled views are listening unnecessary to events.

@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: Client-server synchronization pattern / algorithm? 4 answers I am starting to setup the core data model for a large scale app, and was hoping for some feedback on proper synchronization methods/techniques when it comes to server database and offline capabilities. I use PHP and mySQL for my web server / database. I already know how to connect, receive data, store to core data, etc etc. I am looking more for help with the methodologies and particular instances of tracking data changes to: A) Ensure the app and server are in sync during online and offline use (i.e. offline activity will get pushed up once back online). B) Optimize the speed of saving data to the app. My main questions are: What is the best way to check what new/updated data in the app still needs to be synchronized (after offline use)? (i.e. In all my Core Data Entities I put a 'isSynchronized' attribute of BOOL type. Then update to 'YES' once successfully submitted and response is sent back from server). Is this the best way? What is the best way to optimize speed of saving data from server to core data? (i.e. How can I only update data in Core Data that is older than what is on server database without iterating through each entity and just updating every single time)? Is it possible without adding a server database column for tracking update timestamps to EVERY table? Again, I already know how to download data and store it to Core Data, I am just looking for some help with best practices in ensuring synchronization across app and server databases while ensuring optimized processing time.

All of our apps use iCloud and Push notifications so wildcard is not an option. How do you organize this inside Xcode? Do you create two different targets or are you able to manage this with a new Project Configuration? What about iCloud entitlements?

@CONTENT:I am trying to understand how CPU cache is operating. Lets say we have this configuration (as an example). Cache size 1024 bytes Cache line 32 bytes 1024/32 = 32 cache lines all together. Singel cache line can store 32/4 = 8 ints. 1) According to these configuration length of tag should be 32-5=27 bits, and size of index 5 bits (2^5 = 32 addresses for each byte in cache line). If total cache size is 1024 and there are 32 cache lines, where is tags+indexes are stored? (There is another 4*32 = 128 bytes.) Does it means that actual size of the cache is 1024+128 = 1152? 2) If cache line is 32 bytes in this example, this means that 32 bytes getting copied in cache whenerever CPU need to get new byte from RAM. Am I right to assume that cache line position of the requested byte will be determined by its adress? This is what I mean: if CPU requested byte at [FF FF 00 08], then available cache line will be filled with bytes from [FF FF 00 00] to [FF FF 00 1F]. And our requseted single byte will be at position [08]. 3) If previous statement is correct, does it mean that 5 bits that used for index, are technically not needed since all 32 bytes are in the cache line anyway? Please let me know if I got something wrong. Thanks

@CONTENT:I'm trying to streamline some of our tasks at my place of work, and it seems that quite a lot of our developers' time is spent doing semi-mechanical tasks on the web (specifically, editing online stores that use web-based interfaces). As such, I've been looking into some solutions that will allow these tasks to be done by scripts since I figure that could save us quite a bit of time per task. So before I really started digging into any of these, I was just wondering if the Stack Overflow community had any recommendations about which web scripting/macro solution would be the best. Here are the requirements: Must be able to interact with web forms (not just downloading a page and scraping the file - the script must edit controls within a web form and then submit that form) The forms we have to edit are secure forms, so the scripting solution must be able to handle that (ie it's of no use for us to have an incredibly powerful scripting solution if a human being will have to sit there and watch it and manually re-login every few minutes) It would be really, really, really preferable if it could read local files and do some basic string replacement/manipulation on them (e.g. it would be nice to have a list of variables or some HTML code in a text file and then have the script replace the token "STORENAME" with that particular store's name before it inserts the code into the form) Here are the scripting solutions that are on my radar so far (I haven't really looked into any of these, although I have played around with Chickenfoot): Chickenfoot iMacros for Firefox libwww-perl libwww for unix and C (while searching for libwww for perl I came across this, which I did not know existed until now) a more "general" macro solution like AutoHotKey Has anyone here on Stack Overflow tried any of these solutions? If so, what did you like or dislike about them? Can anyone recommend one that is not on the list? (This is by no means an exclusive or exhaustive list). I would really love to automate a lot of our mechanical processes, and I hope the Stack Overflow community can help us out so we can hopefully avoid that much of the mind-numbing part of the work :). Thanks in advance! edit: Re: platform - We have primarily WindowsXP terminals at work, but 1) we do have a few Mac test PCs, so OS X is a viable option, and 2) if it would mean automating a lot of these tasks, I'll build a Linux box if that is necessary.

Over the last few days I've tried to determine my position in a room. I use the relative distance (accuracy) from three beacons and gave every beacon a fixed position in my room.

I understand that the layout viewport can be changed by setting the meta viewport tag, but that also changes the visual viewport--why is that? It says that the visual viewport is the part of the page that¡¦s currently shown on-screen, so my understanding was that the visual viewport should not be affected by the meta viewport setting.

@CONTENT:Considering the code below: Dataview someView = new DataView(sometable)
someView.RowFilter = someFilter;

if(someView.count > 0) {  ¡K. }
 Quite a number of articles which say Datatable.Select() is better than using DataViews, but these are prior to VS2008. Solved: The Mystery of DataView's Poor Performance with Large Recordsets Array of DataRecord vs. DataView: A Dramatic Difference in Performance Googling on this topic I found some articles/forum topics which mention Datatable.Select() itself is quite buggy(not sure on this) and underperforms in various scenarios. On this(Best Practices ADO.NET) topic on msdn it is suggested that if there is primary key defined on a datatable the findrows() or find() methods should be used insted of Datatable.Select(). This article here (.NET 1.1) benchmarks all the three approaches plus a couple more. But this is for version 1.1 so not sure if these are valid still now. Accroding to this DataRowCollection.Find() outperforms all approaches and Datatable.Select() outperforms DataView.RowFilter. So I am quite confused on what might be the best approach on finding rows in a datatable. Or there is no single good way to do this, multiple solutions exist depending upon the scenario?

@TITLE:Overlay animated images with transparency over a static background image using ffmpeg?
@CONTENT:I'm looking to create a video using a set of png images that have transparency merged with a static background. After doing a lot of digging I seems like it's definitely possible by using the filters library. My initial video making without including the background is: ffmpeg -y -qscale 1 -r 1 -b 9600 -loop -i bg.png -i frame_%d.png -s hd720 testvid.mp4
 Using -vf I can apply the background as overlay: ffmpeg -y -qscale 1 -r 1 -b 9600 -i frame_%d.png -vf "movie=bg.png [wm];[in][wm] overlay=0:0 [out]" -s hd720 testvid.mp4
 However the problem is it's overlaying the background over the input. According libacfilter I can split the input and play with it's content. I'm wondering if I can somehow change the overlay order? Any help greatly appreciated! UPDATE 1: I'm trying to make the following filter work but I'm getting the movie without the background: ffmpeg -y -qscale 1 -r 1 -b 9600 -i frame_%d.png -vf "movie=bg.png [bg]; [in] split [T1], fifo, [bg] overlay=0:0, [T2] overlay=0:0 [out]; [T1] fifo [T2]" -s hd720 testvid.mp4
 UPDATE 2: Got video making using -vf option. Just piped the input slit it applied image over it and overlayed the two split feeds! Probably not the most efficient way... but it worked! ffmpeg -y -r 1 -b 9600 -i frame_%d.png -vf "movie=bg.png, scale=1280:720:0:0 [bg]; [in] format=rgb32, split [T1], fifo, [bg] overlay=0:0, [T2] overlay=0:0 [out]; [T1] fifo [T2]" -s hd720 testvid.mp4

@TITLE:Better solution for nested Backbone.js collections
@CONTENT:Many of my Backbone models often deal with nested models and collections, so far I'm using a combination of defaults, parse and toJSON manually to achieve nesting: ACME.Supplier = Backbone.Model.extend({
    defaults: function() {
        return {
            contacts: new ACME.Contacts(),
            tags: new ACME.Tags(),
            attachments: new ACME.Attachments()
        };
    },

    parse: function(res) {
        if (res.contacts) res.contacts = new ACME.Contacts(res.contacts);
        if (res.tags) res.tags = new ACME.Tags(res.tags);
        if (res.attachments) res.attachments = new ACME.Attachments(res.attachments);

        return res;
    }
});

ACME.Tag = Backbone.Model.extend({
    toJSON: function() {
        return _.pick(this.attributes, 'id', 'name', 'type');
    }
});
 I've looked at a few plugins out there that basically does the same as above but with a lot less control and more boilerplate, so I'm wondering if anyone has a more elegant solution to this common Backbone.js problem. Edit: I ended up with the following approach: ACME.Supplier = Backbone.Model.extend({
    initialize: function(options) {
        this.tags = new ACME.Tags(options.tags);
    },

    parse: function(res) {
        res.tags && this.tags.reset(res.tags);

        return res;
    }
});

ACME.Tag = Backbone.Model.extend({
    toJSON: function() {
        return _.pick(this.attributes, 'id', 'name', 'type');
    }
});
 It is worth noting that later I discovered that you'll need to pass nested model/collection data from the constructor into the constructor of the nested model via the options object.
@CODE:defaults parse toJSON ACME.Supplier = Backbone.Model.extend({
    defaults: function() {
        return {

        if (res.attachments) res.attachments = new ACME.Attachments(res.attachments);

        return res;

Here is what I have done: FFmpeg command line(s): ffmpeg -i test.mp4 test.mp4
ffmpeg -i test.mp4 test.ogg
ffmpeg -i test.mp4 test.webm

 It would be great if someone could send me the required parameters for ffmpeg to convert the video to the 3 required formats and an example of how they setting the source in the video tag to display them again. And any other advise would be great like how to set the quality up etc when doing the conversion. Thanks in advance.

@CONTENT:I need advise on designing an AngularJS application with multiple complex modules and based upon the user role the module gets loaded after authentication & authorization. Some users could have access to one simple module and some could have dashboard and some could have access to 2+ modules. There are lot of directives we have identified which can be reused across different modules. During the design phase we have identified the following things that should exist and we have answers for some of the below items, but we still need advice from experts: A Module could have Partials Controllers Directive Services Exception handling (HTTP Status code or Business errors) Logging (With line number, from which function) May also need to save the logged info in the server Should have the ability to turn on and off logging custom widgets via factory class (Reused in other modules) Shared Directives (isolated scope) Shared Modules Shared Utilities (sorting, filtering, etc.) Enumerators as per master data Constants via singleton Authentication (CSRF) offline storage REST services Event handling for dispatching from one module and handling it in other UI of the application looks like, a fixed menu bar on the top of the page with a drop down navigation on top left with multiple links depending on the user's role. When the user clicks on a link the corresponding module should get loaded in the page. There has to be an empty project which is manually bootstrapped and loads the other modules at run-time. Our approach is to have the following folder structure: app assets css lib js images common components directives utilities authentication Service proxy to hold the $resource calls Enums Constants Model entity json (example customer, product, etc.) business Module A Partials Directives Services Controllers business Module B business Module C index.html Requirejs config file So my questions are: How can a service inside a module talk to other module? Module should be developed and run independently? How the communication between module can be handled with transferring data? How to integrate all the above elements, particularly exception handling, logging? Developers should understand the convention we have defined? What method to call for logging, sending info between module?

@CONTENT:Unlike Mysql, I found it quite challenging trying to sync MongoDB files - They can not be piped back, since they don't send the data to stdout (If I understand correctly). So, I'm trying to find another way, that doesn't involve two ssh calls. What needs to be done is this: Log into the ssh server Export all MongoDB files Compress them to gzip Send them back to the local machine Extract and import The key thing here, though, is leaving no trace behind - I don't want the compressed files stay in the remote machine, which would usually require me for another ssh login. So something along the lines of "move files into archive" is the ideal solution, if that could be later piped back to the local machine seamlessly. I realize MongoDB has a method to connect to a server credentials using mongodump, but the port is closed atm, so I need the SSH method. Any other ideas would be welcome, BTW. Edit - 11.06.14 Since this questions seems to be somewhat popular, I'd care to share a script that evolved from this questions' answers, and other resources during the last year (credit is where credit is due).

@CONTENT:I'm working on some code that uses an NSOperation to import data. I'd like for the user to be able to undo the NSManagedObject instances that are created during the import operation. From what I can tell, it's impossible to use the NSManagedObjectContext -undoManager for any operations that are performed off of the main thread. From the Core Data Programming Guide section on Use Thread Confinement to Support Concurrency, we have these two conditions: Only objectID should be passed between managed object contexts (on separate threads) Managed objects must be saved in a context before the objectID can be used. This makes sense since the managed objects need to be moved from private storage (NSManagedObjectContext) to public storage (NSPersistentStore) before they can be shared. Unfortunately, the -save: message also causes any managed objects in the undo stack to be removed. From the Memory Management Using Core Data section of the same guide: Managed objects that have pending changes (insertions, deletions, or updates) are retained by their context until their context is sent a save:, reset , rollback, or dealloc message, or the appropriate number of undos to undo the change. I've tried several things to work around this limitation, and everything eventually leads back to bulk of the work happening on the main thread (and spinning beach balls.) Any clues to getting undo working with objects created off the main thread would be very much appreciated. -- An enhancement Radar has been submitted: rdar://problem/8977725

@TITLE:Visual viewport vs Layout viewport on mobile devices
@CONTENT:I've just read a nice article on viewport which left me with a couple questions regarding Visual viewport vs Layout viewport on mobile devices. the width and the height of the layout viewport are equal to whatever can be shown on the screen in the maximally zoomed-out mode I did not quite understand what that means. When they say "maximally zoomed-out mode", does that mean that the layout viewport is different for different HTMLs (and not specific to different devices like iPad, Xoom, etc)? Secondly, I've created a demo page to measure these two viewports. (Please view this on an iPhone/iPad to get the correct values.) I understand that the layout viewport can be changed by setting the meta viewport tag, but that also changes the visual viewport--why is that? It says that the visual viewport is the part of the page that¡¦s currently shown on-screen, so my understanding was that the visual viewport should not be affected by the meta viewport setting.

@CONTENT:Considering the code below: Dataview someView = new DataView(sometable)

 Quite a number of articles which say Datatable.Select() is better than using DataViews, but these are prior to VS2008. Solved: The Mystery of DataView's Poor Performance with Large Recordsets Array of DataRecord vs. DataView: A Dramatic Difference in Performance Googling on this topic I found some articles/forum topics which mention Datatable.Select() itself is quite buggy(not sure on this) and underperforms in various scenarios. On this(Best Practices ADO.NET) topic on msdn it is suggested that if there is primary key defined on a datatable the findrows() or find() methods should be used insted of Datatable.Select(). This article here (.NET 1.1) benchmarks all the three approaches plus a couple more. But this is for version 1.1 so not sure if these are valid still now. Accroding to this DataRowCollection.Find() outperforms all approaches and Datatable.Select() outperforms DataView.RowFilter. So I am quite confused on what might be the best approach on finding rows in a datatable. Or there is no single good way to do this, multiple solutions exist depending upon the scenario?

@TITLE:Overlay animated images with transparency over a static background image using ffmpeg?
@CONTENT:I'm looking to create a video using a set of png images that have transparency merged with a static background. After doing a lot of digging I seems like it's definitely possible by using the filters library. My initial video making without including the background is: ffmpeg -y -qscale 1 -r 1 -b 9600 -loop -i bg.png -i frame_%d.png -s hd720 testvid.mp4
 Using -vf I can apply the background as overlay: ffmpeg -y -qscale 1 -r 1 -b 9600 -i frame_%d.png -vf "movie=bg.png [wm];[in][wm] overlay=0:0 [out]" -s hd720 testvid.mp4
 However the problem is it's overlaying the background over the input. According libacfilter I can split the input and play with it's content. I'm wondering if I can somehow change the overlay order? Any help greatly appreciated! UPDATE 1: I'm trying to make the following filter work but I'm getting the movie without the background: ffmpeg -y -qscale 1 -r 1 -b 9600 -i frame_%d.png -vf "movie=bg.png [bg]; [in] split [T1], fifo, [bg] overlay=0:0, [T2] overlay=0:0 [out]; [T1] fifo [T2]" -s hd720 testvid.mp4
 UPDATE 2: Got video making using -vf option. Just piped the input slit it applied image over it and overlayed the two split feeds! Probably not the most efficient way... but it worked! ffmpeg -y -r 1 -b 9600 -i frame_%d.png -vf "movie=bg.png, scale=1280:720:0:0 [bg]; [in] format=rgb32, split [T1], fifo, [bg] overlay=0:0, [T2] overlay=0:0 [out]; [T1] fifo [T2]" -s hd720 testvid.mp4

@TITLE:Better solution for nested Backbone.js collections
@CONTENT:Many of my Backbone models often deal with nested models and collections, so far I'm using a combination of defaults, parse and toJSON manually to achieve nesting: ACME.Supplier = Backbone.Model.extend({
    defaults: function() {
        return {
            contacts: new ACME.Contacts(),
            tags: new ACME.Tags(),
            attachments: new ACME.Attachments()
        };
    },

    parse: function(res) {
        if (res.contacts) res.contacts = new ACME.Contacts(res.contacts);
        if (res.tags) res.tags = new ACME.Tags(res.tags);
        if (res.attachments) res.attachments = new ACME.Attachments(res.attachments);

        return res;
    }
});

ACME.Tag = Backbone.Model.extend({
    toJSON: function() {
        return _.pick(this.attributes, 'id', 'name', 'type');
    }
});
 I've looked at a few plugins out there that basically does the same as above but with a lot less control and more boilerplate, so I'm wondering if anyone has a more elegant solution to this common Backbone.js problem. Edit: I ended up with the following approach: ACME.Supplier = Backbone.Model.extend({
    initialize: function(options) {
        this.tags = new ACME.Tags(options.tags);
    },

    parse: function(res) {
        res.tags && this.tags.reset(res.tags);

        return res;
    }
});

ACME.Tag = Backbone.Model.extend({
    toJSON: function() {
        return _.pick(this.attributes, 'id', 'name', 'type');
    }
});
 It is worth noting that later I discovered that you'll need to pass nested model/collection data from the constructor into the constructor of the nested model via the options object.
@CODE:defaults parse toJSON ACME.Supplier = Backbone.Model.extend({
    defaults: function() {
        return {

        if (res.contacts) res.contacts = new ACME.Contacts(res.contacts);
        if (res.tags) res.tags = new ACME.Tags(res.tags);
        if (res.attachments) res.attachments = new ACME.Attachments(res.attachments);

        return res;

ffmpeg -i test.mp4 test.ogg
ffmpeg -i test.mp4 test.webm

 It would be great if someone could send me the required parameters for ffmpeg to convert the video to the 3 required formats and an example of how they setting the source in the video tag to display them again. And any other advise would be great like how to set the quality up etc when doing the conversion. Thanks in advance.

@CONTENT:I need advise on designing an AngularJS application with multiple complex modules and based upon the user role the module gets loaded after authentication & authorization. Some users could have access to one simple module and some could have dashboard and some could have access to 2+ modules. There are lot of directives we have identified which can be reused across different modules. During the design phase we have identified the following things that should exist and we have answers for some of the below items, but we still need advice from experts: A Module could have Partials Controllers Directive Services Exception handling (HTTP Status code or Business errors) Logging (With line number, from which function) May also need to save the logged info in the server Should have the ability to turn on and off logging custom widgets via factory class (Reused in other modules) Shared Directives (isolated scope) Shared Modules Shared Utilities (sorting, filtering, etc.) Enumerators as per master data Constants via singleton Authentication (CSRF) offline storage REST services Event handling for dispatching from one module and handling it in other UI of the application looks like, a fixed menu bar on the top of the page with a drop down navigation on top left with multiple links depending on the user's role. When the user clicks on a link the corresponding module should get loaded in the page. There has to be an empty project which is manually bootstrapped and loads the other modules at run-time. Our approach is to have the following folder structure: app assets css lib js images common components directives utilities authentication Service proxy to hold the $resource calls Enums Constants Model entity json (example customer, product, etc.) business Module A Partials Directives Services Controllers business Module B business Module C index.html Requirejs config file So my questions are: How can a service inside a module talk to other module? Module should be developed and run independently? How the communication between module can be handled with transferring data? How to integrate all the above elements, particularly exception handling, logging? Developers should understand the convention we have defined? What method to call for logging, sending info between module?

@CONTENT:Unlike Mysql, I found it quite challenging trying to sync MongoDB files - They can not be piped back, since they don't send the data to stdout (If I understand correctly). So, I'm trying to find another way, that doesn't involve two ssh calls. What needs to be done is this: Log into the ssh server Export all MongoDB files Compress them to gzip Send them back to the local machine Extract and import The key thing here, though, is leaving no trace behind - I don't want the compressed files stay in the remote machine, which would usually require me for another ssh login. So something along the lines of "move files into archive" is the ideal solution, if that could be later piped back to the local machine seamlessly. I realize MongoDB has a method to connect to a server credentials using mongodump, but the port is closed atm, so I need the SSH method. Any other ideas would be welcome, BTW. Edit - 11.06.14 Since this questions seems to be somewhat popular, I'd care to share a script that evolved from this questions' answers, and other resources during the last year (credit is where credit is due).

@CONTENT:I'm working on some code that uses an NSOperation to import data. I'd like for the user to be able to undo the NSManagedObject instances that are created during the import operation. From what I can tell, it's impossible to use the NSManagedObjectContext -undoManager for any operations that are performed off of the main thread. From the Core Data Programming Guide section on Use Thread Confinement to Support Concurrency, we have these two conditions: Only objectID should be passed between managed object contexts (on separate threads) Managed objects must be saved in a context before the objectID can be used. This makes sense since the managed objects need to be moved from private storage (NSManagedObjectContext) to public storage (NSPersistentStore) before they can be shared. Unfortunately, the -save: message also causes any managed objects in the undo stack to be removed. From the Memory Management Using Core Data section of the same guide: Managed objects that have pending changes (insertions, deletions, or updates) are retained by their context until their context is sent a save:, reset , rollback, or dealloc message, or the appropriate number of undos to undo the change. I've tried several things to work around this limitation, and everything eventually leads back to bulk of the work happening on the main thread (and spinning beach balls.) Any clues to getting undo working with objects created off the main thread would be very much appreciated. -- An enhancement Radar has been submitted: rdar://problem/8977725

I read that a stateless session bean is for implementing your business logic that operates on the entities and managed beans are for interacting with the web-based front-end, by having the webpage call methods on the managed bean, and having the managed bean call business methods on the session bean. So in my example, the RegistrationController would feature a +register(String carRegistration) method that the webpage would call. The RegistrationController would in turn instantiate a Car and call +create(Car car) on the session bean, which would persist it. Is this correct?

@CONTENT:Recently our team is working on a new project with node.js. It is not difficult to start working with node.js. But now we're all just start to use this new technique and have little experience in such event-based development.

@TITLE:Javascript Sandbox?
@CONTENT:Would it be possible to sandbox user-submitted Javascript by overriding various functions such as alert, window.location, and eval? I'm not looking for a perfect solution. I'm sure some people would still find a way to rearrange divs to spell out swear words or something malicious, but if I could disable page redirects 100% reliably I would be mostly happy. I tried in Chrome, and doing something like context={}; //use this to prevent `this` from being `window`
context.f=function(){
  var window=null,location=null,eval=function(){};
  console.log(window); //also the other two
};
context.f();
 seems promising. If I replace the console line with user-submitted code (checking for paren balancing), would that be an absurdly bad idea or a mildly bad idea? On Chrome I can still break things by going through this to Function and redefining things, but that would be acceptable to me.
@CODE:alert window.location eval context={}; //use this to prevent `this` from being `window`
context.f=function(){
  var window=null,location=null,eval=function(){};

Unfortunately, this option enables iCloud but does not transfer any of the local data to iCloud. I can't seem to get migratePersistentStore:toURL:options:withType:error: to work either. I provide the persistent store, its URL, iCloud options, etc. and it still will not migrate the existing local data to iCloud.

    if (store) NSLog(@"[CoreData Manager] Store was successfully migrated");
    else NSLog(@"[CoreData Manager] Error migrating persistent store: %@", error);
} 
 The local storage remains separate from the iCloud storage. If possible, I'd like to move the local Core Data to iCloud without manually transferring each entity. Any ideas? I can find lots of articles, tutorials, and posts about moving back to local storage from iCloud - but I want to move from local storage to iCloud.

Update Thanks to @jcesar for providing the link and also to @konstantin pribluda to provide valuable information and guide. I am able to convert images in to proper black and white form (almost). and so the recognition is better for all images :) Need help with proper binarization of images. Any Idea will be appreciated

@CONTENT:I have been struggling for the past few hours thinking about which route I should go. I have a Notification model. Up until now I have used a notification_type column to manage the types but I think it will be better to create separate classes for the types of notifications as they behave differently. Right now, there are 3 ways notifications can get sent out: SMS, Twitter, Email Each notification would have: id
subject
message
valediction
sent_people_count
deliver_by
geotarget
event_id
list_id
processed_at
deleted_at
created_at
updated_at
 Seems like STI is a good candidate right? Of course Twitter/SMS won't have a subject and Twitter won't have a sent_people_count, valediction. I would say in this case they share most of their fields. However what if I add a "reply_to" field for twitter and a boolean for DM? My point here is that right now STI makes sense but is this a case where I may be kicking myself in the future for not just starting with MTI? To further complicate things, I want a Newsletter model which is sort of a notification but the difference is that it won't use event_id or deliver_by. I could see all subclasses of notification using about 2/3 of the notification base class fields. Is STI a no-brainer, or should I use MTI?

@TITLE:GCD Poor Performance
@CONTENT:As you may remember, I am trying to use GCD to speed up some of my code, namely a collision detection and resolution engine. However, I am clearly doing something wrong because all of my GCD code is significantly slower and less consistent than my serial code (between 1.4x and 10x slower). Allow me to give you an example: I am iterating over an array in a bubble-sort fashion to determine all possible collisions among objects in that array: - (double) detectCollisionsInArray:(NSArray*)objects
{   
    int count = [objects count];
    if (count > 0)
    {       
        double time = CFAbsoluteTimeGetCurrent();
        for (int i = 0; i < count; i++)
        {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < count; j++)
            {
                /** LOTS AND LOTS OF WORK FOR EACH OBJECT **/
            }
        }

        return CFAbsoluteTimeGetCurrent() - time;
    }

    return 0;
}
 Pretty straightforward, and it seems to perform well given the constraints of the problem. However, I would like to take advantage of the fact that the state of each object is not modified in the code section and use GCD to parallelize this work. To do this I am trying something like this: - (double) detectCollisionsInArray:(NSArray*)objects
{   
    int count = [objects count];
    if (count > 0)
    {
        NSOperationQueue* opQueue = [[NSOperationQueue alloc] init];

@TITLE:How do you use usercontrols in asp.net mvc that display an ¡§island¡¨ of data?
@CONTENT:I am trying to find out how to use usercontrols in asp.net mvc. I know how to add a usercontrol to a view and how to pass data to it. What I haven't been able to figure out is how do you do this without having to retrieve and pass the data in every single controller? For example, if I have a user control that displays the most recent posts on several but not all the pages in the site, how do I write the Controllers so that I get data for that usercontrol and pass it to the user control from only one place in the web site instead of getting and passing data in each of the different controllers that the user control is used in? I'm not sure if this makes sense or not. Is there a better or recommended way to handle an "island" of data that you want to display on several pages? I'm coming from web forms where I could just write a user control that got its own data and displayed data independently from the rest of whatever page it is used on.

@CONTENT:I have a project in subversion, which I'm developing using Eclipse. I did the original checkout from the svn repository from inside Eclipse. All was well for some weeks then for some unknown reason, Eclipse (specifically: subclipse in Ganymede) no longer recognizes my project as being under svn control. The team context-menu only shows the basic "apply patch" / "share this project" menu options. From the shell, I can still update the project using the svn command line tools, so I know that the svn credentials still work. Other projects under subversion in the same copy of Eclipse still work. I realise that I can delete the local copy and check it out again, but I'd rather understand what has gone wrong - fix the problem, rather than mask the symptoms. Where does Eclipse store its knowledge of which projects are under version control? I looked at the .project file and the .settings directory, but couldn't see any obvious mention of svn nature or anything similar, even in the projects that are still working properly.

For example, if you type in the command prompt "notepad", Notepad will launch, but you can still execute other commands. However, if you open a utility such as more.com, ping.exe, or another utility, it will wait for the executing program to finish before letting you execute another command. How does the command prompt know when to wait for exit, and how can this behavior be emulated in C#?

@CONTENT:Maybe a way to alter the colors locally (as in application dependant)? A background color of eclipse is white, the same white of windows' active window background color. If I change the color on the theme, eclipse changes to the color. I want to change this software's color without changing the whole theme (because then every program gets weird colors). Is this possible? I thought that maybe there was a way to apply different windows themes to different programs, or something. I'm using windows XP, classic windows theme.

@CONTENT:Accidentally, by using a GUI as opposed to CLI, I removed every file in a Mercurial project. I recovered with Revert ok and lost some work, which as I have time machine I could easily get back. But is there a way of un-remove/undelete such files? Trawled through the manual and googled but cannot see anything. Any plugins? I am probably answering my own question here but the files were gone from the directory and were not in the trash to recover so I am assuming Remove is irrevocable? p.s. I know that hg forget or hg remove -Af will remove without deleting from the directory but my question has to do with the error I made as opposed to cool thinking the action through.

@LINK:/questions/1377719/padding-within-inputs-breaks-width-100
@TITLE:Padding within inputs breaks width 100%
@CONTENT:Ok, so we know that setting padding to an object causes its width to change even if it is set explicitly. While one can argue the logic behind this, it causes some problems with some elements. For most cases, you just add a child element and add padding to that one instead of the one set to 100%, but for form inputs, that's not a possible step. Take a look at this: http://sandman.net/test/formcss.html The second input has its padding set to 5px which I very much prefer to the default setting. But unfortunately that makes the input grow 10px in all directions, including adding 10px to the 100% width. Problem here is that I can't add a child element inside the input so I can't fix it. So the question is: Is there any way to add padding inside the input while still keeping the width 100%? It need to be 100% since the forms will render in different width parents so I don't know beforehand the width of the parent.

@LINK:/questions/32479188/whats-the-difference-between-rgba0-0-0-0-and-transparent
@TITLE:What's the difference between rgba(0,0,0,0) and transparent?
@CONTENT:In one of my other questions, the solution to fixing a rendering issue was by using the value rgba(255, 255, 255, 255) instead of transparent. We tested using rgba(0, 0, 0, 0) and this still corrected the problem, meaning that it is the definition of transparent that causes the error. However, looking at the W3C CSS3 Specification (and MDN reference) for transparent reveals that rgba(0, 0, 0, 0) and transparent should be equal: transparent Fully transparent. This keyword can be considered a shorthand for transparent black, rgba(0,0,0,0), which is its computed value. So what gives? Why can two, seemingly, identical values produce different results? I've looked into the formatting of RGBA, and looked for similar questions (to no avail). Every question/answer that mentions the conversion from transparent to rgba(0,0,0,0) always has the words 'should' or 'according' in. (For example here). What is the actual difference, and why does it change the output so much? N.B: This occurs in most, if not all, versions of Internet Explorer. We also know that it occurs in some versions of Firefox. However Chrome and Safari do not display this behaviour, leading us to believe that there is some sort of patch for this in -webkit. To be able to submit this as a bug we need to reproduce the problem using the minimal amount of code. So, transferred from my other question, here is a comparison of using transparent vs rgba(0,0,0,0), and what happens when we use both. Transparent @keyframes spin{
	0% {transform:rotateZ(0deg);}
	50% {transform:rotateZ(360deg);border-radius:60%;}

} <div class="spinme"></div> RGBA(0,0,0,0) @keyframes spin{
	0% {transform:rotateZ(0deg);}

}
.spinme{
	display:inline-block;
	position:relative;

	border-radius:0%;
	outline: 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0);
	transform:rotateZ(0deg);
	animation: spin infinite 4s;
} <div class="spinme"></div> Both As pointed out by @andyb, there is strange behaviour when using both on separate elements. You would expect only one to wobble, however they both do. As demonstrated: @keyframes spin{
  0% {transform:rotateZ(0deg);}
  50% {transform:rotateZ(360deg);border-radius:60%;}
  100%{transform:rotateZ(720deg);}
}
.spinme{
  display:inline-block;
  position:relative;
  left:0;
  top:0;
  margin:0.2rem;
  width:0.8rem;
  height:0.8rem;
  border:0.2rem solid black;
  border-radius:0%;
  outline: 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0);
  transform:rotateZ(0deg);
  animation: spin infinite 4s;
}
.spinme:nth-of-type(2){
  outline: 1px solid transparent;
} <div class="spinme"></div>
<div class="spinme"></div> For those who can't test this in Internet Explorer, here is an animated .gif of the problem: This is with transparent on the left, rgba in the middle, and both on the right. As pointed out by @Abhitalks I misread the reference, however I will leave the below in the question to show that we've already considered this possibility, or in case something was missed/overlooked. Thanks to @juan-c-v's answer I decided to attempt to create a test to find the computed value for transparent in each browser, and came up with the following: $('p').text($('p').css("background-color")); p{background-color:transparent;} <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
<p></p> If you are viewing this in Chrome/Safari, then you will most likely see (comment if you don't) rgba(0,0,0,0). However in IE, you will probably see transparent still. I was reading the MSDN reference and found that: The transparent keyword is not supported. Which explains why the browsers display different results. However it doesn't explain anywhere what their version of transparent is actually defined as. I looked through the old CSS1 and CSS2 w3c specs and couldn't find an old definition. What does transparent mean?

@CONTENT:Is there a simple way to delete all local branches which do not have a remote equivalent? Example: Branches (local and remote) master origin/master origin/bug-fix-a origin/bug-fix-b origin/bug-fix-c Locally, I only have a master branch. Now I need to work on bug-fix-a, so I check it out, work on it, and push changes to the remote. Next I do the same with bug-fix-b. Branches (local and remote) master bug-fix-a bug-fix-b origin/master origin/bug-fix-a origin/bug-fix-b origin/bug-fix-c Now I have local branches master, bug-fix-a, bug-fix-b. The Master branch maintainer will merge my changes into master and delete all branches he has already merged. So the current state is now: Branches (local and remote) master bug-fix-a bug-fix-b origin/master origin/bug-fix-c Now I would like to call some command to delete branches (in this case bug-fix-a, bug-fix-b), which are no longer represented in the remote repository. It would be something like the existing command git remote prune origin, but more like git local prune origin.

 I've tested it both in the Chrome browser and in Node.js and I've got absolutely no clue why would it happen. The effect lasts till I refresh the current page or restart Node REPL. What could be a source of such significant (~12 times worse) performance? PS. Since it seems to work only in some environemnts please write the environment You're using to test it. Mine were: OS: Ubuntu 14.04 Node v0.10.37 Chrome 43.0.2357.134 (Official Build) (64-bit) /Edit On Firefox 39 it takes ~5500 ms for each test regardless of the order. It seems to occur only on specific engines. /Edit2 Inlining the function to the test function makes it run always the same time. Is it possible that there is an optimization that inlines the function parameter if it's always the same function?

@TITLE:Metaprogramming in C++ and in D
@CONTENT:The template mechanism in C++ only accidentally became useful for template metaprogramming. On the other hand, D's was designed specifically to facilitate this. And apparently it's even easier to understand (or so I've heard). I've no experience with D, but I'm curious, what is it that you can do in D and you cannot in C++, when it comes to template metaprogramming?

@TITLE:Can't compile project when I'm using Lombok under IntelliJ IDEA
@CONTENT:I'm trying to use Lombok in my project that I'm developing using IntelliJ IDEA 11. I've installed 3rd-party plugin for IDEA and it seems working fine because IDEA sees all autogenerated methods/fields. So I have a class that uses Slf4j. I annotated it like this import lombok.extern.slf4j.Slf4j;

@Slf4j
public class TestClass
{
    public TestClass()
    {
        log.info("Hello!");
    }
}
 But when I build my project compiler spits: cannot find symbol variable log. Could you please tell me what I'm missing here ? Update: It turned out it's RequestFactory annotation process that fails. input files: {com.zasutki.courierApp.server.TestServlet, com.mine.courierApp.server.model.DatastoreObject}

 Any ideas on workarounds ? Update2: Perhaps it's not something readers want to hear but I ended up switching to Scala.

@TITLE:TFS Code Reviews - Show updated files in response to comments
@CONTENT:We are beginning to use the code review functionality built-in to VS 2012 and VS 2013 preview. Requesting the review and adding comments seem pretty straightforward. If someone adds comments requesting the code to be changed, then how does the requester make these changes and show them? So the process would flow like this: Person 1 requests a code review. Person 2 adds comments and selects "Needs Work." Person 1 makes the necessary changes. How does Person 1 now show these changes to Person 2? You can add comments and send them, but the files don't change. I'm assuming the files are from the changeset created when the original review was requested. Should Person 1 close this review, and request a second review? Creating a second review doesn't seem optimal, because you lose the history of your conversation of why you were making the changes. There are ton of websites showing how to use the basic functionality of the code reviews, but are there any sites that show the best practices? For instance, who should be clicking the check boxes next to files?

@TITLE:jQuery: Clearing Form Inputs
@CONTENT:I have tried to different ways to clear a form: <form action="service.php" id="addRunner" name="addRunner" method="post">
First Name: <input type="text" name="txtFirstName" id="txtFirstName" /><br />
Last Name:  <input type="text" name="txtLastName" id="txtLastName" /><br />
Gender: <select id="ddlGender" name="ddlGender"><option value="">--Please Select--</option>
<option value="f">Female</option>
<option value="m">Male</option>
</select><br />
Finish Time:
<input type="text" name="txtMinutes" id="txtMinutes" size="10" maxlength="2">(Minutes)
<input type="text" name="txtSeconds" id="txtSeconds" size="10" maxlength="2">(Seconds)
<br />
<button type="submit" name="btnSave" id="btnSave">Add Runner</button>
<input type="hidden" name="action" value="addRunner" id="action">
</form>
 jQuery #1: function clearInputs(){
$("#txtFirstName").val('');
$("#txtLastName").val('');
$("#ddlGender").val('');
$("#txtMinutes").val('');
$("#txtSeconds").val('');
}
 This works perfectly. jQuery #2: function clearInputs(data){
$("#addRunner :input").each(function(){
$(this).val('');
});
 This clears the form but does not let me submit any more any information to it. I try and click the button again and it does nothing. Here's the button click handler: $("#btnSave").click(function(){
    var data = $("#addRunner :input").serializeArray();
    $.post($("#addRunner").attr('action'), data, function(json){
        if (json.status == "fail"){
            alert(json.message);
        }
        if (json.status == "success"){
            alert(json.message);
            clearInputs();
        }
    }, "json");
});
 PHP Post code: <?php
if($_POST){ 
    if ($_POST['action'] == 'addRunner') {
        $fname = htmlspecialchars($_POST['txtFirstName']);
        $lname = htmlspecialchars($_POST['txtLastName']);
        $gender = htmlspecialchars($_POST['ddlGender']);
        $minutes = htmlspecialchars($_POST['txtMinutes']);
        $seconds = htmlspecialchars($_POST['txtSeconds']);
        if(preg_match('/[^\w\s]/i', $fname) || preg_match('/[^\w\s]/i', $lname)) {
            fail('Invalid name provided.');
        }
        if( empty($fname) || empty($lname) ) {
                fail('Please enter a first and last name.');
        }
        if( empty($gender) ) {
            fail('Please select a gender.');
        }
        if( empty($minutes) || empty($seconds) ) {
            fail('Please enter minutes and seconds.');
        }
        $time = $minutes.":".$seconds;

    $query = "INSERT INTO runners SET first_name='$fname', last_name='$lname', gender='$gender', finish_time='$time'";
    $result = db_connection($query);

        success($msg);
    } else {
        fail('Insert failed.');
    }
    exit;
}
 } If I use jQuery method #2, I get this error in the console: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'status' of null
 Why does this happen? I forgot to include this key information: function fail ($message){
    die(json_encode(array('status'=>'fail', 'message'=>$message)));
}

function success ($message){
    die(json_encode(array('status'=>'success', 'message'=>$message)));
 This sends the message back to the AJAX function in jQuery. It looks like after I submit the form once using method #2 the success/fail messages are blanked out.

 Obviously the above does not work because in the $ function, the second argument is the context, not another element. So how can I attach the event to both the elements at one go ?

@TITLE:CRITICAL_STRUCTURE_CORRUPTION BSOD Windows 8.1 with Intel HAXM Android Emulator installed
@CONTENT:I've had frequent "Critical Structure Corruption" BSODs ever since installing Windows 8.1. I even bought a new computer thinking it was just Windows 8.1 being more sensitive to a potential hardware fault. But the BSODs kept coming in thick and fast while doing pretty much nothing at all, not even running an emulator. I had a kernel problem panic on my mac with the recent Mavericks and it led me to put two and two together and it seems that simply having Intel HAXM installed on Win8.1 was causing BSODs. Uninstalling Intel HAXM stops the BSODs. Ultimately, this question I'm guessing would be resolved when Intel or MS make an update that fixes the BSODs.

                              # latest version before 1.0.
 However, based on the Bundler docs it sounded to me like it would be better to nail down the exact version like this... gem "haml-rails", "0.3.4"
 So there's your haml-rails gem and all its dependencies won't drift forward. If you check out the project on a different machine a few weeks later and run $ bundle install you'll have precisely the same versions of everything you specified. I've seen point releases break stuff, and I thought part of the whole idea of Bundler was to "Bundle.lock" all your gem versions. But on rubygems.org they use "~>" a lot so maybe I'm missing something? Any clarification would be very helpful to me in understanding Bundler and gem management.
@CODE:gem "haml-rails", "~> 0.3.4"  # "$ bundle install" will acquire the 
                              # latest version before 1.0. gem "haml-rails", "0.3.4" $ bundle install Bundle.lock

@CONTENT:I'm looking for a command to run against the MSBuild.exe that just takes a MVC 4 project and publishes it to a given directory. For example, MSBuild <solution>/<project>.csproj -publish -output=c:/folder
 This is obviously incorrect syntax. I'm trying to simplify my question. This question talks of a build XML, but I'm not trying to do anything with that much detail. I'm simply trying to do a deploy. Further down in that question, someone speaks of "MSDeploy". I can look into that, but is it the only option? I do not have the ability to install web deploy on the server. In which case, all I really need to do is "Publish" and send the contents of the published project to a given directory on the server/file-system. Does anyone have a one liner I can use? Do I have to use MSDeploy? Does MSDeploy require web deploy to be installed on the server? Doesn't setting up web deploy on the server require setting up some ports, permissions, and installing some IIS add-ons? I'd love to just execute something simple.

@LINK:/questions/13568337/no-warning-or-error-or-runtime-failure-when-contravariance-leads-to-ambiguity
@TITLE:No warning or error (or runtime failure) when contravariance leads to ambiguity
@CONTENT:First, remember that a .NET String is both IConvertible and ICloneable. Now, consider the following quite simple code: //contravariance "in"
interface ICanEat<in T> where T : class
{
  void Eat(T food);
}

class HungryWolf : ICanEat<ICloneable>, ICanEat<IConvertible>
{
  public void Eat(IConvertible convertibleFood)
  {
    Console.WriteLine("This wolf ate your CONVERTIBLE object!");
  }

  public void Eat(ICloneable cloneableFood)
  {
    Console.WriteLine("This wolf ate your CLONEABLE object!");
  }
}
 Then try the following (inside some method): ICanEat<string> wolf = new HungryWolf();
wolf.Eat("sheep");
 When one compiles this, one gets no compiler error or warning. When running it, it looks like the method called depends on the order of the interface list in my class declaration for HungryWolf. (Try swapping the two interfaces in the comma (,) separated list.) The question is simple: Shouldn't this give a compile-time warning (or throw at run-time)? I'm probably not the first one to come up with code like this. I used contravariance of the interface, but you can make an entirely analogous example with covarainace of the interface. And in fact Mr Lippert did just that a long time ago. In the comments in his blog, almost everyone agrees that it should be an error. Yet they allow this silently. Why? --- Extended question: Above we exploited that a String is both Iconvertible (interface) and ICloneable (interface). Neither of these two interfaces derives from the other. Now here's an example with base classes that is, in a sense, a bit worse. Remember that a StackOverflowException is both a SystemException (direct base class) and an Exception (base class of base class). Then (if ICanEat<> is like before): class Wolf2 : ICanEat<Exception>, ICanEat<SystemException>  // also try reversing the interface order here
{
  public void Eat(SystemException systemExceptionFood)
  {
    Console.WriteLine("This wolf ate your SYSTEM EXCEPTION object!");
  }

  public void Eat(Exception exceptionFood)
  {
    Console.WriteLine("This wolf ate your EXCEPTION object!");
  }
}
 Test it with: static void Main()
{
  var w2 = new Wolf2();
  w2.Eat(new StackOverflowException());          // OK, one overload is more "specific" than the other

  ICanEat<StackOverflowException> w2Soe = w2;    // Contravariance
  w2Soe.Eat(new StackOverflowException());       // Depends on interface order in Wolf2
}
 Still no warning, error or exception. Still depends on interface list order in class declaration. But the reason why I think it's worse is that this time someone might think that overload resolution would always pick SystemException because it's more specific than just Exception. Status before the bounty was opened: Three answers from two users. Status on the last day of the bounty: Still no new answers received. If no answers show up, I shall have to award the bounty to Moslem Ben Dhaou.

@TITLE:New to unit testing, how to write great tests? [closed]
@CONTENT:I'm fairly new to the unit testing world, and I just decided to add test coverage for my existing app this week. This is a huge task, mostly because of the number of classes to test but also because writing tests is all new to me. I've already written tests for a bunch of classes, but now I'm wondering if I'm doing it right. When I'm writing tests for a method, I have the feeling of rewriting a second time what I already wrote in the method itself. My tests just seems so tightly bound to the method (testing all codepath, expecting some inner methods to be called a number of times, with certain arguments), that it seems that if I ever refactor the method, the tests will fail even if the final behavior of the method did not change. This is just a feeling, and as said earlier, I have no experience of testing. If some more experienced testers out there could give me advices on how to write great tests for an existing app, that would be greatly appreciated. Edit : I would love to thank Stack Overflow, I had great inputs in less that 15 minutes that answered more of the hours of online reading I just did.

@LINK:/questions/2933126/what-are-good-cli-tools-for-json
@TITLE:What are good CLI tools for JSON?
@CONTENT:General Problem Though I may be diagnosing the root cause of an event, determining how many users it affected, or distilling timing logs in order to assess the performance and throughput impact of a recent code change, my tools stay the same: grep, awk, sed, tr, uniq, sort, zcat, tail, head, join, and split. To glue them all together, Unix gives us pipes, and for fancier filtering we have xargs. If these fail me, there's always perl -e. These tools are perfect for processing CSV files, tab-delimited files, log files with a predictable line format, or files with comma-separated key-value pairs. In other words, files where each line has next to no context. XML Analogues I recently needed to trawl through Gigabytes of XML to build a histogram of usage by user. This was easy enough with the tools I had, but for more complicated queries the normal approaches break down. Say I have files with items like this: <foo user="me">
    <baz key="zoidberg" value="squid" />
    <baz key="leela"    value="cyclops" />
    <baz key="fry"      value="rube" />
</foo>
 And let's say I want to produce a mapping from user to average number of <baz>s per <foo>. Processing line-by-line is no longer an option: I need to know which user's <foo> I'm currently inspecting so I know whose average to update. Any sort of Unix one liner that accomplishes this task is likely to be inscrutable. Fortunately in XML-land, we have wonderful technologies like XPath, XQuery, and XSLT to help us. Previously, I had gotten accustomed to using the wonderful XML::XPath Perl module to accomplish queries like the one above, but after finding a TextMate Plugin that could run an XPath expression against my current window, I stopped writing one-off Perl scripts to query XML. And I just found out about XMLStarlet which is installing as I type this and which I look forward to using in the future. JSON Solutions? So this leads me to my question: are there any tools like this for JSON? It's only a matter of time before some investigation task requires me to do similar queries on JSON files, and without tools like XPath and XSLT, such a task will be a lot harder. If I had a bunch of JSON that looked like this: {
  "firstName": "Bender",
  "lastName": "Robot",
  "age": 200,
  "address": {
    "streetAddress": "123",
    "city": "New York",
    "state": "NY",
    "postalCode": "1729"
  },
  "phoneNumber": [
    { "type": "home", "number": "666 555-1234" },
    { "type": "fax", "number": "666 555-4567" }
  ]
}
 And wanted to find the average number of phone numbers each person had, I could do something like this with XPath: fn:avg(/fn:count(phoneNumber))
 Questions Are there any command-line tools that can "query" JSON files in this way? If you have to process a bunch of JSON files on a Unix command line, what tools do you use? Heck, is there even work being done to make a query language like this for JSON? If you do use tools like this in your day-to-day work, what do you like/dislike about them? Are there any gotchas? I'm noticing more and more data serialization is being done using JSON, so processing tools like this will be crucial when analyzing large data dumps in the future. Language libraries for JSON are very strong and it's easy enough to write scripts to do this sort of processing, but to really let people play around with the data shell tools are needed.

@TITLE:Keeping the contentOffset in a UICollectionView while rotating Interface Orientation
@CONTENT:I'm trying to handle interface orientation changes in a UICollectionViewController. What I'm trying to achieve is, that I want to have the same contentOffset after an interface rotation. Meaning, that it should be changed corresponding to the ratio of the bounds change. Starting in portrait with a content offset of {bounds.size.width * 2, 0} ¡K ¡K should result to the content offset in landscape also with {bounds.size.width * 2, 0} (and vice versa). Calculating the new offset is not the problem, but don't know, where (or when) to set it, to get a smooth animation. What I'm doing so fare is invalidating the layout in willRotateToInterfaceOrientation:duration: and resetting the content offset in didRotateFromInterfaceOrientation:: - (void)willRotateToInterfaceOrientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation)toInterfaceOrientation
                                duration:(NSTimeInterval)duration;
{
    self.scrollPositionBeforeRotation = CGPointMake(self.collectionView.contentOffset.x / self.collectionView.contentSize.width,
                                                    self.collectionView.contentOffset.y / self.collectionView.contentSize.height);
    [self.collectionView.collectionViewLayout invalidateLayout];
}

- (void)didRotateFromInterfaceOrientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation)fromInterfaceOrientation;
{
    CGPoint newContentOffset = CGPointMake(self.scrollPositionBeforeRotation.x * self.collectionView.contentSize.width,
                                           self.scrollPositionBeforeRotation.y * self.collectionView.contentSize.height);
    [self.collectionView newContentOffset animated:YES];
}
 This changes the content offset after the rotation. How can I set it during the rotation? I tried to set the new content offset in willAnimateRotationToInterfaceOrientation:duration: but this results into a very strange behavior. An example can be found in my Project on GitHub.
@CODE:willRotateToInterfaceOrientation:duration: didRotateFromInterfaceOrientation: - (void)willRotateToInterfaceOrientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation)toInterfaceOrientation

@TITLE:How do experienced Haskell developers approach laziness at *design* time?
@CONTENT:I'm an intermediate Haskell programmer with tons of experience in strict FP and non-FP languages. Most of my Haskell code analyzes moderately large datasets (10^6..10^9 things), so laziness is always lurking. I have a reasonably good understanding of thunks, WHNF, pattern matching, and sharing, and I've been able to fix leaks with bang patterns and seq, but this profile-and-pray approach feels sordid and wrong. I want to know how experienced Haskell programmers approach laziness at design time. I'm not asking about easy items like Data.ByteString.Lazy or foldl'; rather, I want to know how you think about the lower-level lazy machinery that causes runtime memory problems and tricky debugging. How do you think about thunks, pattern matching, and sharing during design time? What design patterns and idioms do you use to avoid leaks? How did you learn these patterns and idioms, and do you have some good refs? How do you avoid premature optimization of non-leaking non-problems? (Amended 2014-05-15 for time budgeting): Do you budget substantial project time for finding and fixing memory problems? Or, do your design skills typically circumvent memory problems, and you get the expected memory consumption very early in the development cycle?

@LINK:/questions/21105748/sequelize-js-how-to-use-migrations-and-sync
@TITLE:Sequelize.js: how to use migrations and sync
@CONTENT:I'm close to having my project ready to launch. I have big plans for after launch and the database structure is going to change -- new columns in existing tables as well as new tables, and new associations to existing and new models. I haven't touched migrations in Sequelize yet, since I've only had testing data which I don't mind wiping out every time the database changes. To that end, at present I'm running sync force: true when my app starts up, if I have changed the model definitions. This deletes all the tables and makes them from scratch. I could omit the force option to have it only create new tables. But if existing ones have changed this in not useful. So once I add in migrations how do things work? Obviously I don't want existing tables (with data in them) to be wiped out, so sync force: true is out of the question. On other apps I've helped develop (Laravel and other frameworks) as part of the app's deployment procedure we run the migrate command to run any pending migrations. But in these apps the very first migration has a skeleton database, with the database in the state where it was some time early in development -- the first alpha release or whatever. So even an instance of the app late to the party can get up to speed in one go, by running all migrations in sequence. How do I generate such a "first migration" in Sequelize? If I don't have one, a new instance of the app some way down the line will either have no skeleton database to run the migrations on, or it will run sync at the start and will make the database in the new state with all the new tables etc, but then when it tries to run the migrations they won't make sense, since they were written with the original database and each successive iteration in mind. My thought process: at every stage, the initial database plus each migration in sequence should equal (plus or minus data) the database generated when sync force: true is run. This is because the model descriptions in the code describe the database structure. So maybe if there is no migration table we just run sync and mark all the migrations as done, even though they weren't run. Is this what I need to do (how?), or is Sequelize supposed to do this itself, or am I barking up the wrong tree? And if I'm in the right area, surely there should be a nice way to auto generate most of a migration, given the old models (by commit hash? or even could each migration be tied to a commit? I concede I am thinking in a non-portable git-centric universe) and the new models. It can diff the structure and generate the commands needed to transform the database from old to new, and back, and then the developer can go in and make any necessary tweaks (deleting/transitioning particular data etc). When I run the sequelize binary with the --init command it gives me an empty migrations directory. When I then run sequelize --migrate it makes me a SequelizeMeta table with nothing in it, no other tables. Obviously not, because that binary doesn't know how to bootstrap my app and load the models. I must be missing something. TLDR: how do I set up my app and its migrations so various instances of the live app can be brought up to date, as well as a brand new app with no legacy starting database?

We need to find the solution in log n time. It is easy to find the solution in O(n) time, but it looks pretty tricky to perform in log n time.

@TITLE:Convert an array into an index hash in Ruby
@CONTENT:I have an array, and I want to make a hash so I can quickly ask "is X in the array?". In perl, there is an easy (and fast) way to do this: my @array = qw( 1 2 3 );
my %hash;
@hash{@array} = undef;
 This generates a hash that looks like: {
    1 => undef,
    2 => undef,
    3 => undef,
}
 The best I've come up with in Ruby is: array = [1, 2, 3]
hash = Hash[array.map {|x| [x, nil]}]
 which gives: {1=>nil, 2=>nil, 3=>nil}
 Is there a better Ruby way? EDIT 1 No, Array.include? is not a good idea. Its slow. It does a query in O(n) instead of O(1). My example array had three elements for brevity; assume the actual one has a million elements. Let's do a little benchmarking: #!/usr/bin/ruby -w
require 'benchmark'

array = (1..1_000_000).to_a
hash = Hash[array.map {|x| [x, nil]}]

I need O(1) to find all values for a given key, O(N) is OK for removal, but O(logN) would be preferred.

@TITLE:How to Troubleshoot Intermittent SQL Timeout Errors
@CONTENT:We've been having a few instances per day where we get a slew of SQL Timeout errors from multiple applications (System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException: Timeout expired. The timeout period elapsed prior to completion of the operation or the server is not responding.) We have over 100 different applications on our network, both web and desktop apps. Everything from VB6 and Classic ASP to .NET 4. I can find all kinds of data that show the side effects but can't pinpoint what is causing this. Our DBA says nothing is wrong with the SQL server, and IT says there's nothing wrong with the web servers or network, so of course I'm left in the middle trying to troubleshoot this. I'm really just looking for suggestions on what other troubleshooting I can do to try and track this down. We're running SQL Server 2008 R2 in a cluster. There's a handful of different servers that connect to it, ranging from Windows server 2003 to 2008 of different varieties. Here's what I've done so far: Run SQL trace of long running queries and deadlocks. This shows no deadlocks at the times of the problems, and long running queries all coincide with our timeout errors, but look to be a side effect, and not the cause. Queries that are very basic that typically return instantly end up taking 30, 60 or 120 seconds to run at times. This happens for a few minutes then everything picks up and works fine after that. Use performance monitor to track connection pool connections. This sometimes shows some spikes in the number of connections near the times of the timeouts, but still not even halfway to the default 100 connection limit. Again, nothing here that seems to point to a cause. Separate web applications into different App Pools. We tried to narrow down the apps we thought may be the main problem (most chatty, etc) and put them in separate Application Pools but that doesn't seem to affect anything or help us narrow down anything. Monitor disk usage on SQL Server. We've done some monitoring on the SQL server and see no spikes or any signs of problems when these timeouts are occurring. Verified TempDB was not the cause of the problem. I'll come back and add more if I think of what else we've tried. Please let me know some ideas on what to troubleshoot next.

This works well for the most part, except for when it comes to custom xml namespaces in layout files. So this: <ScrollView xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:custom="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/com.mycompany.myapp" />
 will stop working as soon as package name is replaced with com.mycompany.myapp.test. Because of that, I have to replace com.mycompany.myapp value each time during prebuilt. And since all this files should be in vcs, and should not conflict every time one person switches configuration and them merges, I had to move layout files into specific config folder, where they would look like: <ScrollView xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:custom="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/@CONFIG.PACKAGENAME@" />
 Now this files are stored in vcs, and @CONFIG.PACKAGENAME@ is replaced during prebuilt and then the file is copied from ./config/file.xml to ./res/layout/file.xml. This is extremely inconvinient and doesn't really scale well (I can't imagine mentioning every one of like 50 files in build script). So my question is: is there a way to automatically use current package name in namespace declaration? Or at least modife layout files (or build files?) so that I wont have to replace com.mycompany.myapp every time I change package name.
@CODE:<ScrollView xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:custom="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/com.mycompany.myapp" /> <ScrollView xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"

val indexed = xs zipWithIndex

@TITLE:vim regex replace multiple consecutive spaces with only one space
@CONTENT:I often work with text files which have a variable amount of whitespaces as word separators (text processors like Word do this, to distribute fairly the whitespace amount due to different sizes of letters in certain fonts and they put this annoying variable amount of spaces even when saving as plain text). I would like to automate the process of replacing these sequences of whitespaces that have variable length with single spaces. I suspect a regex could do it, but there are also whitespaces at the beginning of paragraphs (usually four of them, but not always), which I would want to let unchanged, so basically my regex should also not touch the leading whitespaces and this adds to the complexity. I'm using vim, so a regex in the vim regex dialect would be very useful to me, if this is doable. My current progress looks like this: :%s/ \+/ /g
 but it doesn't work correctly. I'm also considering to write a vim script that could parse text lines one by one, process each line char by char and skip the whitespaces after the first one, but I have a feeling this would be overkill.

@TITLE:Converting an array of objects to ActiveRecord::Relation
@CONTENT:I have an array of objects, let's call it an Indicator. I want to run Indicator class methods (those of the def self.subjects variety, scopes, etc) on this array. The only way I know to run class methods on a group of objects is to have them be an ActiveRecord::Relation. So I end up resorting to adding a to_indicators method to Array. def to_indicators
  # TODO: Make this less terrible.
  Indicator.where id: self.pluck(:id)
end
 At times I chain quite a few of these scopes to filter down the results, within the class methods. So, even though I call a method on an ActiveRecord::Relation, I don't know how to access that object. I can only get to the contents of it through all. But all is an Array. So then I have to convert that array to a ActiveRecord::Relation. For example, this is part of one of the methods: all.to_indicators.applicable_for_bank(id).each do |indicator|
  total += indicator.residual_risk_for(id)
  indicator_count += 1 if indicator.completed_by?(id)
end
 I guess this condenses down to two questions. How can I convert an Array of objects to an ActiveRecord::Relation? Preferably without doing a where each time. When running a def self.subjects type method on an ActiveRecord::Relation, how do I access that ActiveRecord::Relation object itself? Thanks. If I need to clarify anything, let me know.
@CODE:Indicator def self.subjects to_indicators Array def to_indicators
  # TODO: Make this less terrible.
  Indicator.where id: self.pluck(:id)
end all all all.to_indicators.applicable_for_bank(id).each do |indicator|
  total += indicator.residual_risk_for(id)

@TITLE:Authentication for users on a Single Page App?
@CONTENT:I have developed a single page app prototype that is using Backbone on the front end and going to consume from a thin RESTful API on the server for it's data. Coming from heavy server side application development (php and python), I have really enjoyed the new different design approach with a thick client side MVC but am confused on how best to restrict the app to authenticated users who log in. I prefer to have the app itself behind a login and would also like to implement other types of logins eventually (openid, fb connect, etc) in addition to the site's native login. I am unclear how this is done and have been searching - however unsuccessful in finding information that made it clear to me. In the big picture, what is the current best practice for registering users and requiring them to login to use your single page app? Once a user is logged in, how are the api requests authenticated? Can I store a session but how do I detect for this session in the API calls or is there a token I have to pass in every single API call? Any answers to this would be much appreciated!

@LINK:/questions/5952387/adding-favicon-to-javascript-bookmarklet-uses-window-open
@TITLE:Adding favicon to javascript Bookmarklet (uses window.open)
@CONTENT:I have a bookmarklet that launches a window.open javascript function to open a small window with my bookmarklet -- an external feature used to communicate between any visted site and my server. I'd like for a favicon to show up when the bookmarklet is added to the bookmark toolbar. I realize that the bookmarklet is javascript, there is no domain tied to it so it's going to be either difficult or impossible to achieve this goal. My understanding of the problem: Favicons are easy to understand, a link within the head of an HTML doc. The browser can pull this when bookmarking an actual site by reference. However, as you see my bookmarklet is ran off a javascript launch code where there exists no HTML, therefor no link to a favicon. I'm not ready to give up yet though, I feel that there's some injection that can be made... As of now, the bookmarklet launch code looks like this: Current Script -- bookmarklet, no favicon (note all code is formated with line breaks -- won't work in all browsers, normally its one line) javascript:void(window.open(
        'http://mydomain.com/bookmarklet/form?u='
        +encodeURIComponent(location.href)+
        't='+encodeURIComponent(document.title),
        'test','status=0,toolbar=0,location=0,menubar=0,
         resizable=false,scrollbars=false,height=379,width=379'
        ));
 The closest thing I've found to a solution is as follows, but it doesn't open a new window -- just creates a new tab with the html as the page: Working favicon, no bookmarklet window javascript:'<!DOCTYPE html>
    <html><head>
    <title>Hello World</title>
    <link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="http://www.tapper-ware.net/devel/js/JS.Bookmarklets/icons/next.png" />
    </head>
    <body>Hello World</body>
    </html>';
 I have tried a combination of the two but it didn't seem to use the icon. I'd be curious to know if anyone can see a type of workaround.. I think it could be possible, I just don't think it's set up correctly as I've been trying. My hybrid of the two -- bookmarklet but no favicon javascript:'<!DOCTYPE html>
    <html><head>
    <title>Hello World</title>
    <link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="http://www.tapper-ware.net/devel/js/JS.Bookmarklets/icons/next.png" />
    </head><body>Hello World</body></html>';
    window.open('http://mydomain.com/bookmarklet/form?u='
    +encodeURIComponent(location.href)+
    '&t='+encodeURIComponent(document.title),
    'test',
    'status=0,toolbar=0,location=0,menubar=0,resizable=false,
     scrollbars=false,height=379,width=379').void(0);
 What I did was use the html structure before firing window.open(), this successfully opened my bookmarklet in a new window, but no favicon showed up for the bookmark icon. Logical Solution: My thoughts on this would be to have the bookmarklet point to a page that is simply an HTML file with a favicon link and the launch script in the <head>. However, I don't want this opening in a new tab with a blank HTML file that then launches a popup.. Workaround..? There exists a similar question but I did not seem to find the answer I'm looking for: How to have favicon / icon set when bookmarklet dragged to toolbar?

I've done some initial work based on existing products, but I felt this would be a good place to ask: what exactly do you WANT from a profiler? I come from real time graphics and games, so it's important to me that a profiler be as fast as possible. Otherwise, the game becomes unplayable and profiling an unplayable slow game tends not to be very enlightening. I'm willing to sacrifice some accuracy as a result. I don't even care about exceptions. But I'm not very familiar with what developers for other types of applications are interested in. Are there any make or break features for you? Where do existing tools fall down?

@TITLE:What of Eclipse project .metadata can I safely ignore in Git/Mercurial?
@CONTENT:We have the code for an Eclipse RCP application in an Eclipse workspace containing multiple Java projects. We are using Mercurial with a simple .hgignore just *.class (but the same issue would pertain to Git). Even a small change to the code can result in many of the files in .metadata getting changed. I'd like to exclude some or all of the .metadata from version control. If we exclude it completely, the workspace is lost. Does anyone know what we can safely exclude? Alternatively, how can we recreate it if we pull the code down to a fresh computer?

@CONTENT:Little bit confused... I am trying to track mailto links being clicked, but constantly 'pageTracker is not defined' is shown. I have the following code just before my end body tag () <script type="text/javascript">

 When I look into the error, I see a funny thing here, that is the .ssh/id_rsa was not tried, just .ssh/identity and .ssh/id_dsa were tried. How can I fix this error? Thanks

@CONTENT:I have started work on a local app for myself that runs through the browser. Having recently gone through the django tutorial I'm thinking that it might be better to use django rather than just plain python. There's one problem, I have at least 20 models and each will have many functions. Quite simply it's going to create one huge models file and probably huge views too, how do I split them up? The models are all related so I cant's simply make them into separate apps can I?

@TITLE:React-Native - Custom navigation with Navigator component
@CONTENT:I'm exploring possibilities of React Native while developing a demo app with custom navigation between views with the help of Navigator component - http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/navigator.html#content The main app class renders navigator and inside renderScene returns passed component: class App extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <Navigator
                initialRoute={{name: 'WelcomeView', component: WelcomeView}}
                configureScene={() => {
                    return Navigator.SceneConfigs.FloatFromRight;
                }}
                renderScene={(route, navigator) => {
                    // count the number of func calls
                    console.log(route, navigator); 

                    if (route.component) {
                        return React.createElement(route.component, { navigator });
                    }
                }}
             />
        );
    }
}
 For now app contains 2 views: class FeedView extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <View style={styles.container}>
                <Text>
                    Feed View!
                </Text>
            </View>
        );
    }
}

class WelcomeView extends React.Component {
    onPressFeed() {
        this.props.navigator.push({
            name: 'FeedView',
            component: FeedView
        });
    }

    render() {
        return (
            <View style={styles.container}>
                <Text style={styles.welcome}>
                    Welcome View!
                </Text>

                <Text onPress={this.onPressFeed.bind(this)}>
                    Go to feed!
                </Text>
            </View>
        );
    }
}
 What I want to figure out is - I see in logs that when pressing "go to feed" renderScene is called several times though the view renders correctly once. Is it how the animation works? index.ios.js:57 Object {name: 'WelcomeView', component: function}
index.ios.js:57 Object {name: 'FeedView', component: function}
// renders Feed View
 Generally does my approach conforms the React way, or it can be done better? What I want to achieve is something similar to NavigatorIOS but without navigation bar (however some views will have their own custom navigation bar).
@CODE:renderScene class App extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <Navigator
                initialRoute={{name: 'WelcomeView', component: WelcomeView}}
                configureScene={() => {
                    return Navigator.SceneConfigs.FloatFromRight;
                }}
                renderScene={(route, navigator) => {
                    // count the number of func calls
                    console.log(route, navigator); 

                    if (route.component) {
                        return React.createElement(route.component, { navigator });
                    }
                }}
             />
        );
    }
} class FeedView extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <View style={styles.container}>
                <Text>
                    Feed View!
                </Text>
            </View>
        );
    }
}

class WelcomeView extends React.Component {
    onPressFeed() {
        this.props.navigator.push({

@LINK:/questions/19879747/vagrant-provisioning-shell-vs-puppet-vs-chef
@TITLE:Vagrant provisioning shell vs puppet vs chef
@CONTENT:I have the following setup: Many different projects which are separate git repositories, but all have mostly the same server configuration Each project in turn depends on many other projects and we use the composer dependency manager to get them together (PHP language here). I want to use Vagrant and include a Vagrant file in each repository, so my team members can clone a repository, run vagrant up and be ready to go. My question is now directed towards the provisioning. I need to install several tools and packages like apache, git, mysql and several php packages, then download some files (like a recent development db dump), set everything up in /var/www and run the composer install command. So one option to do this is using a manager using recipes like chef or puppet. The alternative would be to write a bash file and use shell provisioning. I have not much experience with chef / puppet, so naturally, it seems easier to use the shell option, but I want to understand if this is not a good / viable option in the long run. Why to me it seems a bad approach to go with puppet / chef: I understand that I will have to use several different recipes and will almost always use the same recipes for my different repositories, so I would have to include all of them in all the repositories. Consider having 20 repos and needing 10 recipes, that means that I will need to add 200 recipes as a git-submodule or alike (also each team member needs to clone the repository, then clone 10 recipe repositories and only then run vagrant up for each project). In contrast, I would just need to have a small repo with my shell script and clone it 20 times. I am probably missing something, so please advice whether I should opt for chef / puppet and why it makes sense even if my repositories all have a very similar server setup.

@TITLE:iOS 7 Table view fail to auto adjust content inset
@CONTENT:I am transiting my project to iOS7. I am facing a strange problem related to the translucent navigation bar. I have a view controller and it has a tableview as subview (let's call it ControllerA) . I init a new uinavigationcontroller with the controllerA and present it modally using presentviewcontroller. The presented view controller's table view is blocked by the navigation bar. I set the automaticallyAdjustsScrollViewInsets to YES but the result did not change. I knew I can set the edgesForExtendedLayout to UIRectEdgeNone, but it will make the navigation bar no more translucent. After that, I tried to create a new view controller for testing. It contains almost the same elements. But the result is much different. The table view content does not get blocked. Conclusion Two View Controllers' automaticallyAdjustsScrollViewInsets set to YES The project is not using storyboard The first one is created at Xcode 4.6, The second one is newly created on Xcode 5 I have compared two classes xib and code, not much different

@CONTENT:What is the advantage of using Condition interface/implementations over the conventional wait notify mechanism ?Here i quote the comments written by Doug Lea :- Condition factors out the Object monitor methods (wait, notify and notifyAll) into distinct objects to give the effect of having multiple wait-sets per object, by combining them with the use of arbitrary Lock implementations. Where a Lock replaces the use of synchronized methods and statements, a Condition replaces the use of the Object monitor methods. I see this is a more Object Oriented way of implementing wait/notify mechanism. But is there a sound advantage over the former ?

@CONTENT:This might be trivial, but I don't understand why the default implementation of Selection Sort is not stable? At each iteration you find the minimum element in the remaining array. When finding this minimum, you can choose the first minimum you find, and only update it when an element is actually smaller than it. So, the chosen element at each iteration is the first minimum - meaning, it's first on the previous sort order. So, to my understanding, the current sort will not destroy an order generated by a previous sort on equal elements. What am I missing?

@TITLE:Java Dependency injection: XML or annotations
@CONTENT:Annotations becoming popular. Spring-3 supports them. CDI depends on them heavily (I can not use CDI with out of annotations, right?) My question is why? I heard several issues: "It helps get rid of XML". But what is bad about xml? Dependencies are declarative by nature, and XML is very good for declarations (and very bad for imperative programming). With good IDE (like idea) it is very easy to edit and validate xml, is not it? "In many cases there is only one implementation for each interface". That is not true! Almost all interfaces in my system has mock implementation for tests. Any other issues? And now my pluses for XML: You can inject anything anywhere (not only code that has annotations) What should I do if I have several implementations of one interface? Use qualifiers? But it forces my class to know what kind of injection it needs. It is not good for design. XML based DI makes my code clear: each class has no idea about injection, so I can configure it and unit-test it in any way. What do you think?

@TITLE:Minesweeper master from Google Code Jam(2014) Qualification round
@CONTENT:This is a problem from Google Code Jam qualification round (which is over now). How to solve this problem? Note: If you have a different method from the ones discussed in answers, please share it so we can expand our knowledge of the different ways to solve this problem. Problem Statement: Minesweeper is a computer game that became popular in the 1980s, and is still included in some versions of the Microsoft Windows operating system. This problem has a similar idea, but it does not assume you have played Minesweeper. In this problem, you are playing a game on a grid of identical cells. The content of each cell is initially hidden. There are M mines hidden in M different cells of the grid. No other cells contain mines. You may click on any cell to reveal it. If the revealed cell contains a mine, then the game is over, and you lose. Otherwise, the revealed cell will contain a digit between 0 and 8, inclusive, which corresponds to the number of neighboring cells that contain mines. Two cells are neighbors if they share a corner or an edge. Additionally, if the revealed cell contains a 0, then all of the neighbors of the revealed cell are automatically revealed as well, recursively. When all the cells that don't contain mines have been revealed, the game ends, and you win. For example, an initial configuration of the board may look like this ('*' denotes a mine, and 'c' is the first clicked cell): *..*...**.
....*.....
..c..*....
........*.
..........
 There are no mines adjacent to the clicked cell, so when it is revealed, it becomes a 0, and its 8 adjacent cells are revealed as well. This process continues, resulting in the following board: *..*...**.
1112*.....
00012*....
00001111*.
00000001..
 At this point, there are still un-revealed cells that do not contain mines (denoted by '.' characters), so the player has to click again in order to continue the game. You want to win the game as quickly as possible. There is nothing quicker than winning in one click. Given the size of the board (R x C) and the number of hidden mines M, is it possible (however unlikely) to win in one click? You may choose where you click. If it is possible, then print any valid mine configuration and the coordinates of your click, following the specifications in the Output section. Otherwise, print "Impossible". My Tried Solution: So for the solution, you need to make sure that each non-mine node is in a 3x3 matrix with other non-mine nodes, or a 3x2 or 2x2 matrix if the node is on an edge of the grid; lets call this a 0Matrix. So any node in a 0Matrix have all non-mine neighbors. Firstly, Check whether less mines are required, or less empty nodes if(# mines required < 1/3 of total grid size)
    // Initialize the grid to all clear nodes and populate the mines
    foreach (Node A : the set of non-mine nodes)
        foreach (Node AN : A.neighbors)
            if AN forms a OMatrix with it's neighbors, continue
            else break;
        // If we got here means we can make A a mine since all of it's neighbors 
        // form 0Matricies with their other neighbors
    // End this loop when we've added the number of mines required

else
    // We initialize the grid to all mines and populate the clear nodes
    // Here I handle grids > 3x3; 
    // For smaller grids, I hard coded the logic, eg: 1xn grids, you just populate in 1 dimension

    // Now we know that the # clear nodes required will be 3n+2 or 3n+4
    // eg: if a 4x4 grid need 8 clear nodes : 3(2) + 2

    For (1 -> num 3's needed)
        Add 3 nodes going horizontally
        When horizontal axis is filled, add 3 nodes going vertically
           When vertical axis is filled, go back to horizontal then vertical and so on.

    for(1 -> num 2's needed)
        Add 2 nodes going horizontally or continuing in the direction from above
        When horizontal axis is filled, add 2 nodes going vertically
 For example, say we have an 4x4 grid needing 8 clean nodes, here are the steps: // Initial grid of all mines
* * * *
* * * *
* * * *
* * * *

// Populating 3's horizontally
. * * *
. * * *
. * * *
* * * *     

. . * *
. . * *
. . * *
* * * *    

// Populating 2's continuing in the same direction as 3's
. . . *
. . . *
. . * *
* * * *        
 Another Example: 4x4 grid with 11 clear nodes needed; output: . . . .

* * * * 
 Another Example: 4x4 grid with 14 clear nodes needed; output: // Insert the 4 3's horizontally, then switch to vertical to insert the 2's
. . . .
. . . .
. . . .
. . * *  
 Now here we have a grid that is fully populated and can be solved in one click if we click on (0, 0). My solution works for most cases, but it didn't pass the submission (I did check an entire 225 cases output file), so I'm guessing it has some problems, and I'm pretty sure there are better solutions.

@TITLE:The difference between initrd and initramfs?
@CONTENT:As far as I know, initrd acts as a block device, thus requiring a filesystem driver (such as ext2). The kernel must have at least one built-in module for detecting filesystem of initrd. In this article, Introducing initramfs, a new model for initial RAM disks, it is written that: But ramdisks actually waste even more memory due to caching. Linux is designed to cache all files and directory entries read from or written to block devices, so Linux copies data to and from the ramdisk into the "page cache" (for file data), and the "dentry cache" (for directory entries). The downside of the ramdisk pretending to be a block device is it gets treated like a block device. What's page cache and dentry cache? In the paragraph, does it mean the data got duplicated because ramdisk is treated as a block device, thus all the data is cached? In constrast, ramfs: A few years ago, Linus Torvalds had a neat idea: what if Linux's cache could be mounted like a filesystem? Just keep the files in cache and never get rid of them until they're deleted or the system reboots? Linus wrote a tiny wrapper around the cache called "ramfs", and other kernel developers created an improved version called "tmpfs" (which can write the data to swap space, and limit the size of a given mount point so it fills up before consuming all available memory). Initramfs is an instance of tmpfs. These ram based filesystems automatically grow or shrink to fit the size of the data they contain. Adding files to a ramfs (or extending existing files) automatically allocates more memory, and deleting or truncating files frees that memory. There's no duplication between block device and cache, because there's no block device. The copy in the cache is the only copy of the data. Best of all, this isn't new code but a new application for the existing Linux caching code, which means it adds almost no size, is very simple, and is based on extremely well tested infrastructure. In sum, ramfs is just file opened and loaded into memory, isn't it? Both initrd and ramfs are zipped at compile time, but the difference is, initrd is a block device unpacked to be mounted by the kernel at booting, while ramfs is unpacked via cpio into memory. Am I correct? Or is ramfs a very minimal file system? Finally, up until this day, the initrd image is still presented in the latest kernel. However, is that initrd actually the ramfs used today and the name is just for historical purpose?

@TITLE:Achieving polymorphism in functional programming
@CONTENT:I'm currently enjoying the transition from an object oriented language to a functional language. It's a breath of fresh air, and I'm finding myself much more productive than before. However - there is one aspect of OOP that I've not yet seen a satisfactory answer for on the FP side, and that is polymorphism. i.e. I have a large collection of data items, which need to be processed in quite different ways when they are passed into certain functions. For the sake of argument, let's say that there are multiple factors driving polymorphic behaviour so potentially exponentially many different behaviour combinations. In OOP that can be handled relatively well using polymorphism: either through composition+inheritance or a prototype-based approach. In FP I'm a bit stuck between: Writing or composing pure functions that effectively implement polymorphic behaviours by branching on the value of each data item - feels rather like assembling a huge conditional or even simulating a virtual method table! Putting functions inside pure data structures in a prototype-like fashion - this seems like it works but doesn't it also violate the idea of defining pure functions separately from data? What are the recommended functional approaches for this kind of situation? Are there other good alternatives?

@TITLE:Optimizing queries for the next and previous element
@CONTENT:I am looking for the best way to retrieve the next and previous records of a record without running a full query. I have a fully implemented solution in place, and would like to know whether there are any better approaches to do this out there. Let's say we are building a web site for a fictitious greengrocer. In addition to his HTML pages, every week, he wants to publish a list of special offers on his site. He wants those offers to reside in an actual database table, and users have to be able to sort the offers in three ways. Every item also has to have a detail page with more, textual information on the offer and "previous" and "next" buttons. The "previous" and "next" buttons need to point to the neighboring entries depending on the sorting the user had chosen for the list. Obviously, the "next" button for "Tomatoes, Class I" has to be "Apples, class 1" in the first example, "Pears, class I" in the second, and none in the third. The task in the detail view is to determine the next and previous items without running a query every time, with the sort order of the list as the only available information (Let's say we get that through a GET parameter ?sort=offeroftheweek_price, and ignore the security implications). Obviously, simply passing the IDs of the next and previous elements as a parameter is the first solution that comes to mind. After all, we already know the ID's at this point. But, this is not an option here - it would work in this simplified example, but not in many of my real world use cases. My current approach in my CMS is using something I have named "sorting cache". When a list is loaded, I store the item positions in records in a table named sortingcache. name (VARCHAR)             items (TEXT)

offeroftheweek_unsorted    Lettuce; Tomatoes; Apples I; Apples II; Pears
offeroftheweek_price       Tomatoes;Pears;Apples I; Apples II; Lettuce
offeroftheweek_class_asc   Apples II;Lettuce;Apples;Pears;Tomatoes
 obviously, the items column is really populated with numeric IDs. In the detail page, I now access the appropriate sortingcache record, fetch the items column, explode it, search for the current item ID, and return the previous and next neighbour. array("current"   => "Tomatoes",
      "next"      => "Pears",
      "previous"  => null
      );
 This is obviously expensive, works for a limited number of records only and creates redundant data, but let's assume that in the real world, the query to create the lists is very expensive (it is), running it in every detail view is out of the question, and some caching is needed. My questions: Do you think this is a good practice to find out the neighbouring records for varying query orders? Do you know better practices in terms of performance and simplicity? Do you know something that makes this completely obsolete? In programming theory, is there a name for this problem? Is the name "Sorting cache" is appropriate and understandable for this technique? Are there any recognized, common patterns to solve this problem? What are they called? Note: My question is not about building the list, or how to display the detail view. Those are just examples. My question is the basic functionality of determining the neighbors of a record when a re-query is impossible, and the fastest and cheapest way to get there. If something is unclear, please leave a comment and I will clarify. Starting a bounty - maybe there is some more info on this out there.

@CONTENT:Are there any Event Driven Architecture jQuery plugins? Step 1: Subscribing The subscribers subscribe to the event handler in the middle, and pass in a callback method, as well as the name of the event they are listening for... i.e. The two green subscribers will be listening for p0 events. And the blue subscriber will be listening for p1 events. Step 2: The p0 event is fired by another component to the Event Handler A p0 event is fired to the Event Handler The event handler notifies it's subscribers of the event, calling the callback methods they specified when they subscribed in Step 1: Subscribing. Note that the blue subscriber is not notified because it was not listening for p0 events. Step 3: The p1 event is fired a component to the Event Handler The p1 event is fired by another component Just as before except that now the blue subscriber receives the event through its callback and the other two green subscribers do not receive the event. Images by leeand00, on Flickr I can't seem to find one, but my guess is that they just call it something else in Javascript/jquery Also is there a name for this pattern? Because it isn't just a basic publisher/subscriber, it has to be called something else I would think.

@LINK:/questions/2009063/are-disk-sector-writes-atomic
@TITLE:Are disk sector writes atomic?
@CONTENT:Clarified Question: When the OS sends the command to write a sector to disk is it atomic? i.e. Write of new data succeeds fully or old data is left intact should the power fail immediately following the write command. I don't care about what happens in multiple sector writes - torn pages are acceptable. Old Question: Say you have old data X on disk, you write new data Y over it, and a tree falls on the power line during that write. With no fancy UPS or battery backed disk controller, you can end up with a torn page, where the data on disk is part X and part Y. Can you ever end up with a situation where the data on disk is part X, part Y, and part garbage? I've been trying to understand the design of ACID systems like databases, and to my naive thinking, it seems firebird, which does not use a write-ahead log, is relying that a given write will not destroy old data (X) - only fail to fully write new data (Y). That means that if part of X is being overwritten, only the part of X that is being overwritten can be changed, not the part of X we intend to keep. To clarify, this means if you have a page sized buffer, say 4096 bytes, filled with half Y, half X that we want to keep - and we tell the OS to write that buffer over X, there is no situation short of serious disk failure where the half X that we want to keep is corrupted during the write.

@TITLE:GPS: How NTP time injection works
@CONTENT:I've recently known about a gps.conf file in the /system/etc/ directory. Seems that tweaking NTP_SERVER values to NTP servers nearer to the usual location improves TTFF. Reading the source code in the LocationProvider class, seems that at boot, time is retrieved from NTP server and "injected" in the calculations. AFAIK each GPS sat has a very accurate atomic clock, and every one in the constellation is synchronized to the so called "GPS time". Once the receiver has got 4 or more satellites, it solves (by some method) an equation where there are four unknowns: x,y,z,b; where (x,y,z) is the receiver location, and b is the time difference between the receiver internal clock and the (correct) GPS time. Once it has a a fix, the receiver clock is synced with the correct time. (Please correct me if I'm wrong). So far, I've some questions regarding the way NTP time injection works: GPS Time is roughly TAI (International Atomic Time) plus an offset. Those two times do not depend on the Earth rotation, however UTC does. Given that NTP servers return UTC time, it is possible to infer GPS Time from UTC time? How does retrieving NTP time from a nearer server improve the "quality" of the GPS time approximation? Assuming that we have an initial GPS Time value (inferred from NTP time somehow), what is the injection about? Is this time value taken as correct to solve the equation with only x,y,z as unknowns? If so, then the first fix is also just an approximation, isn't it? How does a higher quality initial approximation for GPS time improve TTFF? Is it because with a lower quality NTP time the first fixes are considered not acceptable and discarded? Does having an approximate initial position help retrieving the next correct fix (like listening only to a subset of sats)?

@CONTENT:I'm trying to split my rails project in a front-end for regular users and a back-end for admins. Therefore i have created a namespace 'admin' so that i can easily control admin specific controller methods/layouts/authentication in the map admin. I'm using Devise to register/authenticate my admins only. Because it is only used for admins only i'm trying to move Devise to the admin namespace. I could not find exactly what i was looking for in the documentation of Devise but i tried something like this in routes.rb: namespace 'admin'do 
  devise_for :admins
end
 I also tried to make a custom Devise::Sessions controller but that too didn't seem to work out. Does anyone know how to do this? Should i just use the regular routes for devise with a custom(admin) layout?

@TITLE:How to deploy OSGi apps and dependencies?
@CONTENT:OSGi seems to have an excellent benefit of having small deployable artifacts by not wrapping dozens of JAR dependencies into a lib directory. However, I can't find anything that tells me an easy, reliable way to deploy dependencies to a container. For instance, I have an application that uses CXF and several Spring subprojects. If I need to deploy this application to a new Glassfish server, what would be the best way to do so, ensuring that all dependencies get installed? I'm using Maven, and it would seem that there could be some way to have a hook that looks at the META-INF/maven directory and pulls the dependency list from the pom.xml and goes and fetches the required libs (probably from a local repo). Is there a way to do that? The Pax plugin sort of sounds like it's doing this, but it seems to be based around boostrapping a Felix container? Which is not what I want, I am dealing with an already running, remote container. Is there any shot such a thing exists as command line tool as opposed to GUI as well?

@LINK:/questions/1595492/blocks-send-input-to-python-subprocess-pipeline
@TITLE:blocks - send input to python subprocess pipeline
@CONTENT:I'm testing subprocesses pipelines with python. I'm aware that I can do what the programs below do in python directly, but that's not the point. I just want to test the pipeline so I know how to use it. My system is Linux Ubuntu 9.04 with default python 2.6. I started with this documentation example. from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
p1 = Popen(["grep", "-v", "not"], stdout=PIPE)
p2 = Popen(["cut", "-c", "1-10"], stdin=p1.stdout, stdout=PIPE)
output = p2.communicate()[0]
print output
 That works, but since p1's stdin is not being redirected, I have to type stuff in the terminal to feed the pipe. When I type ^D closing stdin, I get the output I want. However, I want to send data to the pipe using a python string variable. First I tried writing on stdin: p1 = Popen(["grep", "-v", "not"], stdin=PIPE, stdout=PIPE)
p2 = Popen(["cut", "-c", "1-10"], stdin=p1.stdout, stdout=PIPE)
p1.stdin.write('test\n')
output = p2.communicate()[0] # blocks forever here
 Didn't work. I tried using p2.stdout.read() instead on last line, but it also blocks. I added p1.stdin.flush() and p1.stdin.close() but it didn't work either. I Then I moved to communicate: p1 = Popen(["grep", "-v", "not"], stdin=PIPE, stdout=PIPE)
p2 = Popen(["cut", "-c", "1-10"], stdin=p1.stdout, stdout=PIPE)
p1.communicate('test\n') # blocks forever here
output = p2.communicate()[0]
 So that's still not it. I noticed that running a single process (like p1 above, removing p2) works perfectly. And passing a file handle to p1 (stdin=open(...)) also works. So the problem is: Is it possible to pass data to a pipeline of 2 or more subprocesses in python, without blocking? Why not? I'm aware I could run a shell and run the pipeline in the shell, but that's not what I want. UPDATE 1: Following Aaron Digulla's hint below I'm now trying to use threads to make it work. First I've tried running p1.communicate on a thread. p1 = Popen(["grep", "-v", "not"], stdin=PIPE, stdout=PIPE)
p2 = Popen(["cut", "-c", "1-10"], stdin=p1.stdout, stdout=PIPE)
t = threading.Thread(target=p1.communicate, args=('some data\n',))
t.start()
output = p2.communicate()[0] # blocks forever here
 Okay, didn't work. Tried other combinations like changing it to .write() and also p2.read(). Nothing. Now let's try the opposite approach: def get_output(subp):
    output = subp.communicate()[0] # blocks on thread
    print 'GOT:', output

p1 = Popen(["grep", "-v", "not"], stdin=PIPE, stdout=PIPE)
p2 = Popen(["cut", "-c", "1-10"], stdin=p1.stdout, stdout=PIPE)
t = threading.Thread(target=get_output, args=(p2,)) 
t.start()
p1.communicate('data\n') # blocks here.
t.join()
 code ends up blocking somewhere. Either in the spawned thread, or in the main thread, or both. So it didn't work. If you know how to make it work it would make easier if you can provide working code. I'm trying here. UPDATE 2 Paul Du Bois answered below with some information, so I did more tests. I've read entire subprocess.py module and got how it works. So I tried applying exactly that to code. I'm on linux, but since I was testing with threads, my first approach was to replicate the exact windows threading code seen on subprocess.py's communicate() method, but for two processes instead of one. Here's the entire listing of what I tried: import os
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
import threading

def get_output(fobj, buffer):
    while True:
        chunk = fobj.read() # BLOCKS HERE
        if not chunk:
            break
        buffer.append(chunk)

p1 = Popen(["grep", "-v", "not"], stdin=PIPE, stdout=PIPE)
p2 = Popen(["cut", "-c", "1-10"], stdin=p1.stdout, stdout=PIPE)

b = [] # create a buffer
t = threading.Thread(target=get_output, args=(p2.stdout, b))
t.start() # start reading thread

for x in xrange(100000):
    p1.stdin.write('hello world\n') # write data
    p1.stdin.flush()
p1.stdin.close() # close input...
t.join()
 Well. It didn't work. Even after p1.stdin.close() was called, p2.stdout.read() still blocks. Then I tried the posix code on subprocess.py: import os
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
import select

p1 = Popen(["grep", "-v", "not"], stdin=PIPE, stdout=PIPE)
p2 = Popen(["cut", "-c", "1-10"], stdin=p1.stdout, stdout=PIPE)

numwrites = 100000
to_read = [p2.stdout]
to_write = [p1.stdin]
b = [] # create buffer

while to_read or to_write:
    read_now, write_now, xlist = select.select(to_read, to_write, [])
    if read_now:
        data = os.read(p2.stdout.fileno(), 1024)
        if not data:
            p2.stdout.close()
            to_read = []
        else:
            b.append(data)

    if write_now:
        if numwrites > 0:
            numwrites -= 1
            p1.stdin.write('hello world!\n'); p1.stdin.flush()
        else:
            p1.stdin.close()
            to_write = []

print b
 Also blocks on select.select(). By spreading prints around, I found out this: Reading is working. Code reads many times during execution. Writing is also working. Data is written to p1.stdin. At the end of numwrites, p1.stdin.close() is called. When select() starts blocking, only to_read has something, p2.stdout. to_write is already empty. os.read() call always returns something, so p2.stdout.close() is never called. Conclusion from both tests: Closing the stdin of the first process on the pipeline (grep in the example) is not making it dump its buffered output to the next and die. No way to make it work? PS: I don't want to use a temporary file, I've already tested with files and I know it works. And I don't want to use windows.

@TITLE:what is the difference between set and unordered_set in C++?
@CONTENT:Came across this good question, which is similar but not at all same since it talks about Java, which has different implementation of hash-tables, by virtue of having synchronized accessor /mutators Differences between HashMap and Hashtable? So what is the difference in C++ implementation of set and unordered_set ? This question can be ofcourse extended to map vs unordered_map and so on for other C++ containers. Here is my initial assessment set : While standard doesnt explicitly asks it to be implemented as trees, the time-complexity constraint asked for its operations for find/insert, means it will always be implemented as tree. Usually as RB tree (as seen in GCC 4.8), which is height-balanced. Since they are height balanced, they have predictable time-complexity for find() Pros : Compact (compared to other DS in comparison) Con : Access time complexity is O(lg n) unordered_set : While standard doesnt explicitly asks it to be implemented as trees, the time-complexity constraint asked for its operations for find/insert, means it will always be implemented as hash-table. Pros : Faster (promises amortized O(1) for search) Easy to convert basic primitives to thread-safe, as compared to tree-DS Cons : Look up not guaranteed to be O(1) Therotical worst case is O(n) Not as compact as tree. (for practical purposes load factors is never 1) Note : The O(1), for hashtable comes from the assumption that there are no collision. Even with load-factor of .5, every second variable insertion is leading to collision. It could be observed that the load-factor of hash-table is inversely proportional to the number of operations required for accessing a element in it. More we reduce #operations, sparser hash-table. When the element stored are of size comparable to pointer, then overhead is quite significant. Edit : Since most are saying question contains sufficient answer in it, I am changing the question to "Did I miss any difference between map/set for performance analysis that one should know ??"

@LINK:/questions/3971218/techniques-for-profiling-memory-in-safari-desktop-and-ios
@TITLE:Techniques for profiling memory in Safari desktop and iOS?
@CONTENT:Updated 10/21: Changed title and question in order to possibly get an answer (other than "no"). We're experiencing leaks in Safari (confirmed in Windows and Mac, suspected in iOS). Are there any Safari extensions that lets one profile JavaScript/DOM memory usage to discover potential leaks? Better yet, is there any tool that can be used on iOS or in the Apple iOS emulator? What are suggested techniques for discovering what may be causing memory leaks in JavaScript/DOM in Safari? And does anyone know of ANY way to access memory information for iOS? Background We're developing an iOS Safari web application that uses the single-page app paradigm, loading 100s of full-screen images. We've bypased the normal 6.5 MB iOS Safari image limit by resetting the source for the image tags, but now we're running into what I believe is a memory leak in iOS Safari. After loading ~250-300 images iOS Safari simply stops loading the images, due to what we suspect is a memory leak. Not surprising, given that the same leak appears both in Safari for Windows and Safari for Mac - on Windows it is especially bad; for every new full-screen high res image, another 10-15 MB of memory is consumed, if we switch to lower res images it still gobbles up ~5 MB per image. In Windows we've isolated the leak to the simple act of rendering the image in the browser viewport - we have a carousel of images, and even with zero DOM manipulation, by simply translating (3d) the image through the viewport, memory is allocated and never released. On Windows, memory consumption can quickly escalate to ~1.5 GB, at which point Safari simply crashes. On Mac it's not as bad, but memory easily jumps from 100 MB at the start to 500MB and beyond. In comparison, a Chrome tab/process hosting the same page grows from about 33MB to ~120MB and then stabilizes. Attempted Workarounds We have tried deleting the individual image tags and replacing them with the placeholder image rather than resetting them, but this does not seem to alleviate the problem, and also causes performance problems, presumably due to DOM churn. Interestingly, deleting/detaching ALL the images does work - as soon as the command executes, the memory is released. However this causes its own problems, managing the UI state, and building the carousel back up also takes a noticeable amount of time. Refreshing the page is another workaround, but that causes even more UX disruption. Update 04/10: Just an update on what we ended up doing: iOS 4.2 introduced a limitation that cuts off a 3D transformed Div at 122,900 pixels. Not sure why, but it forced us to re-architect and go with a dynamic carousel instead of our previous static filmstrip. Second, we found that using divs with background images work better than images themselves. This seems like a yet another bug in Safari, or at best an inconsistent limitation implementation. end update Thoughts? If you have encountered suspected leaks in Safari, what has been your approach to work around them?

@TITLE:Improving OFFSET performance in PostgreSQL
@CONTENT:I have a table I'm doing an ORDER BY on before a LIMIT and OFFSET in order to paginate. Adding an index on the ORDER BY column makes a massive difference to performance (when used in combination with a small LIMIT). On a 500,000 row table, I saw a 10,000x improvement adding the index, as long as there was a small LIMIT. However, the index has no impact for high OFFSETs (i.e. later pages in my pagination). This is understandable: a b-tree index makes it easy to iterate in order from the beginning but not to find the nth item. It seems that what would help is a counted b-tree index, but I'm not aware of support for these in PostgreSQL. Is there another solution? It seems that optimizing for large OFFSETs (especially in pagination use-cases) isn't that unusual. Unfortunately, the PostgreSQL manual simply says "The rows skipped by an OFFSET clause still have to be computed inside the server; therefore a large OFFSET might be inefficient."

@TITLE:rails - Choosing captcha plugin [closed]
@CONTENT:There are a lot of captchas plugins in Rails and also many types of solutions for preventing spamming and flooding. So it isn't only Rails question. Let's see what types of plugins do we have: 1. Classic image captcha (zendesk's Captcha, Simple_captcha, Validates_captcha, winton's Captcha, Raptcha). positive: Can be effective to prevent automatic decrypt (not sure about Simple_captcha, but it seems that both zendesk's and winton's captchas don't achieve that, as they use pre-generated images (instead of on-demand), so our possible spam bots can be learned on that images). negative: Require DB table (at least Simple Captcha. Not so bad, but do they clean it after use?). Require RMagick or similar (not so actual for me, as I already have it on my site). Fail manual decrypt ($2/1000 images as I know). Annoying to users and can hurts conversion rates. 2. ReCaptcha (Recaptcha, Rack-recaptcha). positive: Can be effective to prevent automatic decrypt. Don't require Rmagick and DB table. negative: Make api-calls to 3rd-party site. Fail manual decrypt. Even more annoying than previous. 3. Honey pots (Negative-captcha, Trap_door, Reverse_captcha, Honeypot-captcha, Bouncy_bots, invisible_captcha). positive: User doesn't know about captcha presense. Don't require Rmagick and DB table. negative: May fail automatic decrypt (are there any bots that can recognize this plugins?). Fail manual decrypt. 4. Text-base (Humanizer, Brain_buster, Gotcha). positive: Don't require Rmagick and DB table (except of Brain_buster). negative: May fail automatic decrypt. Fail manual decrypt. Little bit annoying (can be localized). 5. Other (Acts_as_snook) positive: User doesn't know about captcha presense. Don't require Rmagick and DB table. negative: Don't know if there any because it's very unusual. But I think it may cause problems in case of flooding, as it can require post's moderation in some times. 6. Akismet-like solutions (don't know about their efficiency). positive: User doesn't know about captcha presense. Don't require Rmagick and DB table. negative: Make api-calls to 3rd-party site. Deliver user's details to 3rd-party site (very, very bad). I also should say a few words about my site. Users can see protected form only after an ajax request (after putting something to cart for example). Are modern bots have abilities to do ajax requests and storing cookies? P.s. I can't post many links as my rating is very low and also sorry for my bad English.

@TITLE:Generating Java from WSDL for use on Android with ksoap2-android SOAP client?
@CONTENT:I have to access a existing SOAP webservice from an Android application. I have been provided some WSDL files describing the webservice. Reading some other answers here on SO, it seems ksoap2-android is the way to go, with respect to which SOAP client to use. The next issue is then how to generate the Java classes needed from the WSDL files, and this is where I am coming up short. As far as I can see there are the following options: AXIS2 code generator WSDL2ksoap JAX-WS wsimport tool I initially tried #1, with the AXIS2 eclipse plugin for wsdl2code generator. The wizard did successfully generate a lot of Java code, however it also changed my android project to some kind of webservice project, and I was never able to get anything that was generated to compile, let alone work with ksoap2-android. Has anybody has success with this? I am not able to run wsdl2ksoap successfully, as it seems to require a running webservice, and all I have at the current point in time is WSDL files. Likewise from reading the webpage, it seems to be a project in its initial stages, and not really ready for prime time. JAX-WS wsimport I have not had a chance to try yet. However I am unsure if what it generates will work with ksoap2-android? Question: How can I generate Java files from WSDL files, for use on Android with ksoap2-android SOAP client library? Thanks a lot in advance. (PS: Yes, the choice is SOAP, it is suboptimal for Android use, but I cannot change that.)

@TITLE:How to show a waitcursor when the WPF application is busy databinding
@CONTENT:I have a WPF application using the MVVM pattern that sometimes have to show a waitcursor when it is busy doing something the user has to wait for. Thanks to a combination of answers on this page: display Hourglass when application is busy, I have a solution that almost works (although it is not really MVVM in spirit). Whenever I do something time-consuming in my viewmodels I do this: using (UiServices.ShowWaitCursor())
{
.. do time-consuming logic
this.SomeData = somedata;
}
 (ShowWaitCursor() returns a IDisposable that shows the waitcursor until it is being disposed of) The last line in my example is where I set some property. This property is bound in my XAML, e.g. like this: <ItemsControl ItemsSource="{Binding SomeData}" /> 
 However, since this could be a long list of objects and sometimes with complex datatemplates, etc. the actual binding and rendering sometime takes a considerable amount of time. Since this binding takes places outside of my using statement the waitcursor will go away before the actual wait is over for the user. So my question is how to do a waitcursor in a WPF MVVM application that takes databinding into account?

@TITLE:MVC3 App/Service Layer/Repository Layer/POCO Classes/EF4 - Questions!
@CONTENT:I am new to this whole design concept, and in reading for the last few weeks I have gathered a lot of information, but it seems scattered and conflicted. Terms are mixed, and I am just having a hard time wrapping my mind around this. The pattern I am using is like this and assume the flow as follows: MVC Application The controller(s) process the request/response from the client for a given view. Inside the controllers action methods, they contact the services (Service Layer) and either request objects to build the view models, and sen the objects from the view models back. View Models I am using strongly typed view models to and from the views. Are view models DTO's? Should they contain just simple properties like Name, AddressLine1, Address City, etc, or should they contain complex properties, multiple objects, etc. Is the validation in the view model. If so would it be validation like required fields, field length, etc. Then validation like user name already exists, or where you would need to interact with other objects in the service layer? Can the view models just contain the POCO classes returned from EF, or should I be using the AutoMapper? If using AutoMapper and DTO, are DTO's clones of the POCO classes? Would you map in the controller, view model, or in the service layer below? Services To me, the service(s) are objects that contact the repository(s) to get POCO objects back from the EF. This is where all of my business logic is. Once the service hands an object back to a repository to be persisted to the EF, they are considered valid objects. Is this correct? Repositories There is no business logic in them, they are just used to transport objects between the service(s) and the EF. Is this correct? I am implementing Interfaces here with generic repository. Then you could extend the generic repository for special needs? Questions About Terminology 1) Is a business object equal to a domain object? How much logic should a domain object contain? 2) Is the domain model the EF model? I am using the Model-First approach. 3) Dependency Injection - Should I be using this? I understand how it works, just don't get the real benefit. I was playing with Ninject. I think the community would benefit from some sort of wiki that contained all the best practices with code samples. Is there something like that out there? A lot of the samples out there are very simple, and a lot of the Microsoft samples do not use this pattern even when claiming to. Thanks in advance to everyone who has and will help me with this. BTW - I think StackOverflow needs a little, "Buy Me A Beer" button next to the "Accept Answer" checkbox :)

@TITLE:Windows batch file to delete .svn files and folders
@CONTENT:In order to delete all ".svn" files/folders/subfolders in "myfolder" I use this simple line in a batch file: FOR /R myfolder %%X IN (.svn) DO (RD /S /Q "%%X")
 This works, but if there are no ".svn" files/folders the batch file shows a warning saying: "The system cannot find the file specified." This warning is very noisy so I was wondering how to make it understand that if it doesn't find any ".svn" files/folders he must skip the RD command. Usually using wild cards would suffice, but in this case I don't know how to use them, because I don't want to delete files/folders with .svn extension, but I want to delete the files/folders named exactly ".svn", so if I do this: FOR /R myfolder %%X IN (*.svn) DO (RD /S /Q "%%X")
 it would NOT delete files/folders named exactly ".svn" anymore. I tried also this: FOR /R myfolder %%X IN (.sv*) DO (RD /S /Q "%%X")
 but it doesn't work either, he deletes nothing.

 Please let me know in case you recognizing anything I should change in my code, or help with a complete code which can support all Android devices and OS for displaying embedded (In-App) Youtube video with high quality. UPDATE: Pay attention, the solution I'm looking for should display high resolution video. I got it work on the different devices and OS using VideoView class but the video quality isn't good enough. So any solution including VideoView or WebView or any other way will be accepted only if it makes high quality YouTube video to be displayed. Thanks to all the responders!

 As the document points out, query or db will be deconstructed automatically. But is that efficient ? Well , if i cache db inside a class , like the following: class Dummy {

 Sometimes i could see warnings like: QSqlDatabasePrivate::removeDatabase: connection 'BLABLA' is still in use, all queries will cease to work.
 Even if i didn't call run().
@CODE:{

@CONTENT:Evolutionary programming seems to be a great way to solve many optimization problems. The idea is very easy and the implementation does not make problems. I was wondering if there is any way to evolutionarily create a program in ruby/python script (or any other language)? The idea is simple: Create a population of programs Perform genetic operations (roulette-wheel selection or any other selection), create new programs with inheritance from best programs, etc. Loop point 2 until program that will satisfy our condition is found But there are still few problems: How will chromosomes be represented? For example, should one cell of chromosome be one line of code? How will chromosomes be generated? If they will be lines of code, how do we generate them to ensure that they are syntactically correct, etc.? Example of a program that could be generated: Create script that takes N numbers as input and returns their mean as output. If there were any attempts to create such algorithms I'll be glad to see any links/sources.

@CONTENT:I am getting ready to test developer productivity tools for our team (Coderush, Resharper, JustCode, etc). We're planning to roll the tool out the same time as we deploy Visual Studio 2010 and TFS. I've seen several posts discussing the merits of one tool versus another. However, I haven't been able to find any discussion of a methodology self evaluating. One approach I've seen is to use each tool for a month or so and decide which one you like best. This seems completely reasonable if I were evaluating it for myself, but since I'm evaluating for others as well, I'd like to do something more rigorous. I'm hoping to collect some ideas on how to do that. As a starting point, my thinking was to come up a list of 10-20 crucial features to compare, then prepare a matrix where I can compare the relative strengths of each product. Once the matrix is complete, we can make a well informed decision about which product aligns with out needs. Since I'm not a user of any product now, it's been difficult to figure out which features are critical and which are less so. Thank you!

@LINK:/questions/783934/where-to-store-application-settings-state-in-a-mvvm-application
@TITLE:Where to store application settings/state in a MVVM application
@CONTENT:I'm experimenting with MVVM for the first time and really like the separation of responsibilities. Of course any design pattern only solves many problems - not all. So I'm trying to figure out where to store application state and where to store application wide commands. Lets say my application connects to a specific URL. I have a ConnectionWindow and a ConnectionViewModel that support gathering this information from the user and invoking commands to connect to the address. The next time the application starts, I want to reconnect to this same address without prompting the user. My solution so far is to create an ApplicationViewModel that provides a command to connect to a specific address and to save that address to some persistent storage (where it's actually saved is irrelevant for this question). Below is an abbreviated class model. The application view model: public class ApplicationViewModel : INotifyPropertyChanged
{
    public Uri Address{ get; set; }
    public void ConnectTo( Uri address )
    { 
        // Connect to the address
        // Save the addres in persistent storage for later re-use
        Address = address;
    }

    ...
}
 The connection view model: public class ConnectionViewModel : INotifyPropertyChanged
{
    private ApplicationViewModel _appModel;
    public ConnectionViewModel( ApplicationViewModel model )
    { 
        _appModel = model; 
    }

    public ICommand ConnectCmd
    {
        get
        {
        	if( _connectCmd == null )
        	{
        		_connectCmd = new LambdaCommand(
        			p => _appModel.ConnectTo( Address ),
        			p => Address != null
        			);
        	}
        	return _connectCmd;
        }
    }    

    public Uri Address{ get; set; }

    ...
}
 So the question is this: Is an ApplicationViewModel the right way to handle this? How else might you store application state? EDIT: I'd like to know also how this affects testability. One of the primary reasons for using MVVM is the ability to test the models without a host application. Specifically I'm interested in insight on how centralized app settings affect testability and the ability to mock out the dependent models.
@CODE:public class ApplicationViewModel : INotifyPropertyChanged
{
    public Uri Address{ get; set; }
    public void ConnectTo( Uri address )
    { 
        // Connect to the address
        // Save the addres in persistent storage for later re-use
        Address = address;
    }

    ...
} public class ConnectionViewModel : INotifyPropertyChanged
{
    private ApplicationViewModel _appModel;
    public ConnectionViewModel( ApplicationViewModel model )
    { 
        _appModel = model; 
    }

    public ICommand ConnectCmd
    {
        get
        {
        	if( _connectCmd == null )
        	{
        		_connectCmd = new LambdaCommand(
        			p => _appModel.ConnectTo( Address ),
        			p => Address != null
        			);
        	}
        	return _connectCmd;
        }
    }    

    public Uri Address{ get; set; }

@TITLE:Replacing a full ORM (JPA/Hibernate) by a lighter solution : Recommended patterns for load/save?
@CONTENT:I'm developing a new Java web application and I'm exploring new ways (new for me!) to persist the data. I mostly have experience with JPA & Hibernate but, except for simple cases, I think this kind of full ORM can become quite complex. Plus, I don't like working with them that much. I'm looking for a new solution, probably closer to SQL. The solutions I'm currently investigating : MyBatis JOOQ Plain SQL/JDBC, potentially with DbUtils or some other basic utility libraries. But there are two use cases I'm worrying about with those solutions, compared to Hibernate. I'd like to know what are the recommended patterns for those use cases. Use Case 1 - Fetching an entity and accessing some of its associated children and grandchildren entities. Let's say I have a Person entity. This Person has an associated Address entity. This Address has an associated City entity. This City entity has a name property. The full path to access the name of the city, starting from the person entity, would be : person.address.city.name
 Now, let's say I load the Person entity from a PersonService, with this method : public Person findPersonById(long id)
{
    // ...
}
 Using Hibernate, the entities associated to the Person could be lazily loaded, on demand, so it would be possible to access person.address.city.name and be sure I have access to this property (as long as all the entities in that chain are not nullable). But using anyone of the 3 solutions I'm investigating, it's more complicated. With those solutions, what are the recommended patterns to take care of this use case? Upfront, I see 3 possible patterns: All the required associated children and grandchildren entities could be eagerly loaded by the SQL query used. But the issue I see with this solution is that there may be some other code that needs to access other entities/properties paths from the Person entity. For example, maybe some code will need access to person.job.salary.currency. If I want to reuse the findPersonById() method I already have, the SQL query will then need to load more information! Not only the associated address->city entity but also the associated job->salary entity. Now what if there are 10 other places that need to access other information starting from the person entity? Should I always eagerly load all the potentially required information? Or maybe have 12 different service methods to load a person entity? : findPersonById_simple(long id)

findPersonById_withAdressCity(long id)

findPersonById_withJob(long id)

findPersonById_withAdressCityAndJob(long id)

...
 But then everytime I would use a Person entity, I would have to know what has been loaded with it and what hasn't... It could be quite cumbersome, right? In the getAddress() getter method of the Person entity, could there be a check to see if the address has already been loaded and, if not, lazily load it? It this a frequently used pattern in real life applications? Are there other patterns that can be used to make sure I can access the entities/properties I need from a loaded Model? Use Case 2 - Saving an entity and making sure its associated and modified entities are also saved. I want to be able to save a Person entity using this PersonService's method : public void savePerson(Person person)
{
    // ...
}
 If I have a Person entity and I change person.address.city.name to something else, how can I make sure the City entity modifications will be persisted when I save the Person? Using Hibernate, it can be easy to cascade the save operation to the associated entities. What about the solutions I'm investigating? Should I use some kind of dirty flag to know what associated entities also have to be saved when I save the person? Are there any other known patterns useful to deal with this use case? Thank you very much in advance for any help! Update : There is a discussion about this question on the JOOQ forum.
@CODE:Person Person Address Address City City name person.address.city.name PersonService public Person findPersonById(long id)
{
    // ...
} Person person.address.city.name Person person.job.salary.currency findPersonById() address->city job->salary findPersonById_simple(long id)

findPersonById_withAdressCity(long id)

findPersonById_withJob(long id)

findPersonById_withAdressCityAndJob(long id)

... Person getAddress() Person Person PersonService public void savePerson(Person person)

@TITLE:Levenshtein distance: how to better handle words swapping positions?
@CONTENT:I've had some success comparing strings using the PHP levenshtein function. However, for two strings which contain substrings that have swapped positions, the algorithm counts those as whole new substrings. For example: levenshtein("The quick brown fox", "brown quick The fox"); // 10 differences
 are treated as having less in common than: levenshtein("The quick brown fox", "The quiet swine flu"); // 9 differences
 I'd prefer an algorithm which saw that the first two were more similar. How could I go about coming up with a comparison function that can identify substrings which have switched position as being distinct to edits? One possible approach I've thought of is to put all the words in the string into alphabetical order, before the comparison. That takes the original order of the words completely out of the comparison. A downside to this, however, is that changing just the first letter of a word can create a much bigger disruption than a changing a single letter should cause. What I'm trying to achieve is to compare two facts about people which are free text strings, and decide how likely these facts are to indicate the same fact. The facts might be the school someone attended, the name of their employer or publisher, for example. Two records may have the same school spelled differently, words in a different order, extra words, etc, so the matching has to be somewhat fuzzy if we are to make a good guess that they refer to the same school. So-far it is working very well for spelling errors (I am using a phoenetic algorithm similar to metaphone on top of this all) but very poorly if you switch the order of words around which seem common in a school: "xxx college" vs "college of xxx".

@TITLE:How do you organize your Backbone files?
@CONTENT:I'm looking to implement backbone into a large web project with multiple "apps" that will be using it and I'm trying to figure out a good way to organize my files. The two I've come up with so far are: js

 I'm leaning towards the latter as it has clearer lines between sections of the website and keeps the apps together but our current structure of the back-end framework is much more like the former.

@TITLE:How to efficiently do many tasks a ¡§little later¡¨ in Python?
@CONTENT:I have a process, that needs to perform a bunch of actions "later" (after 10-60 seconds usually). The problem is that those "later" actions can be a lot (1000s), so using a Thread per task is not viable. I know for the existence of tools like gevent and eventlet, but one of the problem is that the process uses zeromq for communication so I would need some integration (eventlet already has it). What I'm wondering is What are my options? So, suggestions are welcome, in the lines of libraries (if you've used any of the mentioned please share your experiences), techniques (Python's "coroutine" support, use one thread that sleeps for a while and checks a queue), how to make use of zeromq's poll or eventloop to do the job, or something else.

@LINK:/questions/5877497/storing-images-and-thumbnails-on-s3-in-django
@TITLE:Storing images and thumbnails on s3 in django
@CONTENT:I'm trying to get my images thumbnailed and stored on s3 using django-storages, boto, and sorl-thumbnail. I have it working, but it's very slow, even with small images. I don't mind it being slow when I save the form and upload the images to s3, but I'd like it to display the image quickly after that. The answer to this SO question explains that the thumbnail won't be created until first access, but that you can use get_thumbnail() to create it beforehand. Django + S3 (boto) + Sorl Thumbnail: Suggestions for optimisation I'm doing that, and now it seems that all entries into the thumbnail_kvstore table are created when uploading the image, rather than when it is displayed. The problem is that the page displaying the image is still really slow. Looking at the logging panel in the debug toolbar, it looks like there is still lots of communication with s3. It seems like after the image and thumbnails are uploaded and cached, page should render quickly without communicating with s3. What am I doing wrong? Thanks! Update: weak hack seems to have gotten it working, but I'd love to know how to do this properly: https://github.com/asciitaxi/sorl-thumbnail/commit/545cce3f5e719a91dd9cc21d78bb973b2211bbbf Update: more information for @sorl I'm working with 2 views: ADD VIEW: In this view I submit the form to create the model with the image in it. The image is uploaded to s3. In a post_save signal, I call get_thumbnail() to generate the thumbnail before it's needed: im = get_thumbnail(instance.image, '360x360')
 DISPLAY VIEW: In this view I display the thumbnail generated in the add view:     {% thumbnail object.image "360x360" as im %}
    <img src="{{ im.url }}" width="{{ im.width }}" height="{{ im.height }}">
    {% endthumbnail %}
 Without the patch: ADD VIEW: creates 3 entries in the kvstore table, accesses the cache 10 times (6 sets, 4 gets), logging tab of debug toolbar says "establishing HTTP connection" 12 times DISPLAY VIEW: still just 3 entries in the kvstore table, just 1 get from cache, but debug toolbar says "establishing HTTP connection" 3 times still With only the change on line 122: ADD VIEW: same as above, except the logging only says "establishing HTTP connection" 2 times DISPLAY VIEW: same as above, except the logging only says "establishing HTTP connection" 1 time Also adding the change on line 118: ADD VIEW: same as above, but now we are down to 2 "establishing HTTP connection" messages DISPLAY VIEW: same as above, with no logging messages at all UPDATE: It looks like storage._setup() is called twice, and storage.url() is called once. Based on the timing, I'd say each one makes connections to s3: 1304711315.4
_setup
1304711317.84
1304711317.84
_setup
1304711320.3
1304711320.39

 This seems to be reflected by the boto logging, which says "establishing HTTP connection" 3 times.

@TITLE:SVN Synchronize vs Update to Head (subclipse)
@CONTENT:I'm fairly new to both Subversion and Subclipse and am seeing some issues that lead me to believe there is a difference between updating to head, and synchronizing. Specifically I find that when I try to revert (using the subclipse history), I often get a message saying "Cannot reverse merge a range from a path's own future history, try updating first". My synchronize should ensure that I have the 'head' version of all the files in my branch on the REPO, but doing an "Update to head" does fix the issue... so what gives? I've tried to check the SVN console to see what's changing, but it's not very verbose. Ideas? I have a second question, but I'm assuming the answer to the first will shed light on it. If you are curious and have time to read, I'll type it up as well. Here's the scenario... I've branched all my files from a "Production" tag, and have begun to work on my project. After a few commits, I check a changed file's history and notice that the 'bolded' version (according to documentation, this should be head) is below all my commits. It's as if what I have isn't head. But head is just the latest version of the project right? So what am I missing. Thanks for your response and taking the time to read this!

@TITLE:How to do robust SerialPort programming with .NET / C#?
@CONTENT:I'm writing a Windows Service for communication with a Serial Mag-stripe reader and a relay board (access control system). I run into problems where the code stops working (i get IOExceptions) after another program has "interrupted" the process by opening the same serial port as my service. Part of the code is as follows: public partial class Service : ServiceBase
{
	Thread threadDoorOpener;
	public Service()
	{
		threadDoorOpener = new Thread(DoorOpener);
	}
	public void DoorOpener()
	{
		while (true)
		{
			SerialPort serialPort = new SerialPort();
			Thread.Sleep(1000);
			string[] ports = SerialPort.GetPortNames();
			serialPort.PortName = "COM1";
			serialPort.BaudRate = 9600;
			serialPort.DataBits = 8;
			serialPort.StopBits = StopBits.One;
			serialPort.Parity = Parity.None;
			if (serialPort.IsOpen) serialPort.Close();
			serialPort.Open();
			serialPort.DtrEnable = true;
			Thread.Sleep(1000);
			serialPort.Close();
		}
	}
	public void DoStart()
	{
		threadDoorOpener.Start();
	}
	public void DoStop()
	{
		threadDoorOpener.Abort();
	}
	protected override void OnStart(string[] args)
	{
		DoStart();
	}
	protected override void OnStop()
	{
		DoStop();
	}
}
 My sample program successfully starts the work-thread, and the opening/closing and raising of DTR causes my Mag-stripe reader to power up (wait 1sec), shut down (wait 1 sec) and so on. If I launch HyperTerminal and connects to the same COM port, HyperTerminal tells me the port is currently in use. If i repeatedly press ENTER in HyperTerminal, to try to reopen the port it will succeed after a few retries. This has the effect of causing IOExceptions in my work-thread, which is expected. However, even if I close down HyperTerminal, i still get the same IOException in my work-thread. The only cure is actually to restart the computer. Other programs (which is not using .NET libraries for port-access) seem to work normally at this point. Any ideas as to what is causing this?
@CODE:public partial class Service : ServiceBase
{
	Thread threadDoorOpener;
	public Service()
	{
		threadDoorOpener = new Thread(DoorOpener);
	}
	public void DoorOpener()

@CONTENT:I'm looking to learn about embedded programming (in C mainly, but I hope to brush up on my ASM as well) and I was wondering what the best platform would be. I have some experience in using Atmel AVR's and programming them with the stk500 and found that to be relatively easy. I especially like AVR Studio and the debugger that lets you view that state of registers. However, If I was to take the time to learn, I would rather learn about something that is prevalent in industry. I am thinking ARM, that is unless someone has a better suggestion. I would also be looking for some reference material, I have found the books section on the ARM website and if one is a technically better book than another I would appreciate a heads up. The last thing I would be looking for is a prototyping/programming board like the STK500 that has some buttons and so forth. Thanks =]

@TITLE:Linked Docker Containers with Mesos/Marathon
@CONTENT:I'm having great success so far using Mesos, Marathon, and Docker to manage a fleet of servers, and the containers I'm placing on them. However, I'd now like to go a bit further and start doing things like automatically linking an haproxy container to each main docker service that starts, or provide other daemon based and containerized services that are linked and only available to the single parent container. Normally, I'd start up the helper service first with some name, then when I started the real service, I'd link it to the helper and everything would be fine. How does this model fit in to Marathon and Mesos though? It seems for now at least that the containerization assumes a single container. I had one idea to start the helper service first, on whatever host it could find, then add a constraint to the real service that the hostname = helper service's hostname, but that seems like it'd cause issues with resource offers and race conditions for those resources. I've also thought to provide an "embed", or "deep-link" functionality to docker, or to the executor scripts that start the docker containers. Before I head down any of these paths, I wanted to find out if someone else had solved this problem, or if I was just horribly over thinking things. Thanks!

@CONTENT:When text is selected, by default a UIMenuController pops up with cut/copy/paste etc. I'd like to replace this with my own custom view (similar looking, but twice as high so that I can have two rows of buttons/custom views). How can I do this? I know there's no easy way. I'm expecting that if there's an easy solution, it won't be very elegant. The code can't use any private API either. I'd really, really rather not have to implement my own text view, reimplement text selection and input, and reimplement the magnifying view just so I can write my own UIMenuController clone if there's any way to avoid it. It's pretty important to the app's interface that I can replace the UIMenuController, so if there's no other answer then I may end up doing this. I'll be VERY grateful if anyone can save me a decent chunk of time and propose another, easier way of doing this!

@TITLE:Best form for constructors? Pass by value or reference?
@CONTENT:I'm wondering the best form for my constructors. Here is some sample code: class Y { ... }

class X
{
public:
  X(const Y& y) : m_y(y) {} // (a)
  X(Y y) : m_y(y) {} // (b)
  X(Y&& y) : m_y(std::forward<Y>(y)) {} // (c)

  Y m_y;
}

Y f() { return ... }

int main()
{
  Y y = f();
  X x1(y); // (1)
  X x2(f()); // (2)
}
 From what I understand, this is the best the compiler can do in each situation. (1a) y is copied into x1.m_y (1 copy) (1b) y is copied into the argument of the constructor of X, and then copied into x1.m_y (2 copies) (1c) y is moved into x1.m_y (1 move) (2a) result of f() is copied into x2.m_y (1 copy) (2b) f() is constructed into the argument of the constructor, and then copied to x2.m_y (1 copy) (2c) f() is created on the stack, and then moved into x2.m_y (1 move) Now a few questions: On both counts, pass by const reference is no worse, and sometimes better than pass by value. This seems to go against the discussion on "Want Speed? Pass by Value.". For C++ (not C++0x), should I stick with pass by const reference for these constructors, or should I go pass by value? And for C++0x, should I do pass by rvalue reference over pass by value? For (2), I'd prefer if the temporary was constructed directly into x.m_y. Even the rvalue version I think requires a move which, unless the object allocates dynamic memory, is as much work as a copy. Is there any way to code this so the compiler is permitted to avoid these copies and moves? I've made a lot of assumptions in both what I think the compiler can do best and in my questions themselves. Please correct any of these if they are incorrect.
@CODE:class Y { ... }

class X
{
public:
  X(const Y& y) : m_y(y) {} // (a)
  X(Y y) : m_y(y) {} // (b)

  Y m_y;
}

 The code doesn't take advantage of Erlang's concurrency but is just a prototype. I only want to test if I can send the push in the most simple way. I think the problem is in the packet being sent to the APNs. This is the binary format of a push notification: How should I create such a packet in Erlang? Could someone please take a look at my code and tell me where the problem is? Also I used Erlang's SSL application to create the connection and send the data and I don't know if this is the problem or the packet. Thanks!

@TITLE:Pros and cons of MPMoviePlayerController versus launching UIWebView to stream movie
@CONTENT:I have a client who has video content for the web in Flash format. My task is to help them show the videos in an iPhone app. I realize that step one is to get these videos into the appropriate Quicktime format for the iPhone. Then I'm going to have to help the client figure out how or where to host these files. If that's tricky I assume they can be hosted at YouTube. My chief concern, though, is which approach to take to stream the video. What are the pros and cons of MPMoviePlayerController versus launching UIWebView with the URL of the stream? Is there any difference? Is one of them more or less forgiving? Is one of them a better user experience? Any gotchas I might expect to run into? I'm assuming playing video is pretty easy on the iPhone. Is it reasonable to try both and have one available as a fallback, or would that be a waste of time? I'm trying to schedule this out a bit, so I'd love to hear real-world experiences from anyone who's done this.

@TITLE:Most performant way to graph thousands of data points with WPF?
@CONTENT:I have written a chart that displays financial data. Performance was good while I was drawing less than 10.000 points displayed as a connected line using PathGeometry together with PathFigure and LineSegments. But now I need to display up to 100.000 points at the same time (without scrolling) and it's already very slow with 50.000 points. I was thinking of StreamGeometry, but I am not sure since it's basically the same as a PathGeometry stroring the information as byte stream. Does any one have an idea to make this much more performant or maybe someone has even done something similar already? EDIT: These data points do not change once drawn so if there is potential optimizing it, please let me know (line segments are frozen right now). EDIT: I tried StreamGeometry. Creating the graphic took even longer for some reason, but this is not the issue. Drawing on the chart after drawing all the points is still as slow as the previous method. I think it's just too many data points for WPF to deal with. EDIT: I've experimented a bit and I noticed that performance improved a bit by converting the coordinates which were previously in double to int to prevent WPF anti-aliasing sub-pixel lines. EDIT: Thanks for all the responses suggesting to reduce the number of line segments. I have reduced them to at most twice the horizontal resolution for stepped lines and at most the horizontal resolution for simple lines and the performance is pretty good now.

@TITLE:Prerequisites Needed to Read Books on Neural Networks (and understand them)
@CONTENT:I've been trying to learn about Neural Networks for a while now, and I can understand some basic tutorials online, and I've been able to get through portions of Neural Computing - An Introduction but even there, I'm glazing over a lot of the math, and it becomes completely over my head after the first few chapters. Even then its the least book "math-y" I can find. Its not that I'm afraid of the math or anything, its just I haven't learned what I need, and I'm not sure what I need exactly. I'm currently enrolled at my local university, working on catching up on classes I need to enter the MS in Comp. Sci program (my BA is in Business/Info. Sys.) and I haven't gotten very far. According to the university's little course descriptions, NN's are actually covered in a Electrical Engineering course on Pattern Recognition (seems odd to me that this course is EE), which has a few EE prereq's that I don't need to get into the MS Comp. Sci. Program. I'm extremely interested in this topic, and know I eventually want to learn a lot more about it, the problem is, I don't know what I need to know first. Here are topics I think I might need, but this is just speculation from ignorance: Single Variable Calculus (I've had Calc I and II, so I think I'm covered here, just listing for completeness) Multi Variable Calculus Linear Algebra (I've not taken this formally yet, but can actually understand many of the concepts from what I've managed to grok on Wikipedia and other sites) Discrete Mathematics (Another I've not taken formally, but learned a portion of on my own Graph Theory Probability Theory Bayesian Statistics Circuit Design Other maths? Other comp sci topics Obviously there is a neuroscience component here as well, but I actually haven't had any trouble understanding books when they talk about it as applied to NN's, largely because its conceptual In short, Can someone lay out a semi-clear path that one needs to really understand, read book on and eventually implement Neural Networks?

@TITLE:How to change behavior of dict() for an instance
@CONTENT:So I'm writing a class that extends a dictionary which right now uses a method "dictify" to transform itself into a dict. What I would like to do instead though is change it so that calling dict() on the object results in the same behavior, but I don't know which method to override. Is this not possible, or I am I missing something totally obvious? (And yes, I know the code below doesn't work but I hope it illustrates what I'm trying to do.) from collections import defaultdict

class RecursiveDict(defaultdict):
    '''
    A recursive default dict.

    >>> a = RecursiveDict()
    >>> a[1][2][3] = 4
    >>> a.dictify()

        return dict([(k, (v.dictify() if isinstance(v, dict) else v))

>>> b
defaultdict(<class '__main__.RecursiveDict'>, {1: defaultdict(<class '__main__.RecursiveDict'>, {2: defaultdict(<class '__main__.RecursiveDict'>, {3: 4})})})

@TITLE:Scrapy - parse a page to extract items - then follow and store item url contents
@CONTENT:I have a question on how to do this thing in scrapy. I have a spider that crawls for listing pages of items. Every time a listing page is found, with items, there's the parse_item() callback that is called for extracting items data, and yielding items. So far so good, everything works great. But each item, has among other data, an url, with more details on that item. I want to follow that url and store in another item field (url_contents) the fetched contents of that item's url. And I'm not sure how to organize code to achieve that, since the two links (listings link, and one particular item link) are followed differently, with callbacks called at different times, but I have to correlate them in the same item processing. My code so far looks like this: class MySpider(CrawlSpider):
    name = "example.com"
    allowed_domains = ["example.com"]
    start_urls = [
        "http://www.example.com/?q=example",
    ]

    rules = (
        Rule(SgmlLinkExtractor(allow=('example\.com', 'start='), deny=('sort='), restrict_xpaths = '//div[@class="pagination"]'), callback='parse_item'),
        Rule(SgmlLinkExtractor(allow=('item\/detail', )), follow = False),
    )


    def parse_item(self, response):
        main_selector = HtmlXPathSelector(response)
        xpath = '//h2[@class="title"]'

        sub_selectors = main_selector.select(xpath)

        for sel in sub_selectors:
            item = ExampleItem()
            l = ExampleLoader(item = item, selector = sel)
            l.add_xpath('title', 'a[@title]/@title')
            ......

@TITLE:Distributed issue tracker for git with usable Eclipse Mylyn support?
@CONTENT:I'm using git for version control but I'm currently lacking a good issue/bug/ticket tracker with Eclipse Mylyn integration. The features I'm looking for: Open source implementation (so that I can add the features I need in the future. GPL, LGPL, MIT or BSD license preferred). Distributed (the issues must be stored in git the repository, I'm open for suggestions for trackers that store issues in the same or separate branch to the code). Must have Eclipse Mylyn support (so that I can open and close issues through mylyn interface, I think a sensible implementation could provide a localhost HTTP server in a specific port and mylyn would use "web template" connector to speak with the issue tracker). Preferably the Mylyn would automatically see issues opening and closing as I switch branches but I'm okay with this being less smart. Able to track issues between branches, example: I have branches X and Y with a common parent commit Z. the commit Z has an open issue Z1. the branch Y has a fix (commit Y4) and closes the issue in Y. the branch Y has a new issue (commit Y2) the branch Y is merged in X. the issue tracker automatically knows that the issue Z1 is fixed in X but there's now a new issue from commit Y2. Able to deal with the case where multiple repositories open, modify and close same or different issues (the distributed part, I'm just making this explicit). Must be runnable on 64 bit and 32 bit linux (ubuntu 10.04 for now) Preferably implemented in bash, c/c++, python or perl (possibly java or ruby, too). Secondary features (would be nice but I can live without): Small enough to be included in the project's source code: preferrably a single file with an executable bit set (e.g. a single bash or python script with full implementation) Some kind of web user interface so that people without Eclipse Mylyn can at least add new issues and add comments to existing ones (no need to be able to set priorities or even close issues) Can you suggest anything? Update: As of 2012-09-13 no suitable tool has been found. Summary of the best matches this far: Bugs Everywhere - no Mylyn support, the status has been "Adrian Wilkins would like to see a Mylyn connector for BE" in the "Plannet features" for the last two years. Otherwise the project keeps going. git-issues - this project seems to be dead. Original author stopped making commits about two years ago and other authors have done less than ten commits in about last two years. git-case - this project seems to be dead. The original author stopped making commits three years ago. stick - this project seems to be dead. I couldn't even find public repository anymore. TicGit this project seems to be dead. All repositories I could find have disclaimer that the project is no longer developed. TigGit-NG - this projects seems to have died multiple times but this far, somebody has always adopted the project again. No Mylyn support here either. Requires pretty recent Ruby environment to run. TicGit.net - this project seems to be win32/.Net specific fork of TicGit written in C#. Does not match my needs.

@TITLE:Fuzzy matching of product names
@CONTENT:I need to automatically match product names (cameras, laptops, tv-s etc) that come from different sources to a canonical name in the database. For example "Canon PowerShot a20IS", "NEW powershot A20 IS from Canon" and "Digital Camera Canon PS A20IS" should all match "Canon PowerShot A20 IS". I've worked with levenshtein distance with some added heuristics (removing obvious common words, assigning higher cost to number changes etc), which works to some extent, but not well enough unfortunately. The main problem is that even single-letter changes in relevant keywords can make a huge difference, but it's not easy to detect which are the relevant keywords. Consider for example three product names: Lenovo T400 Lenovo R400 New Lenovo T-400, Core 2 Duo The first two are ridiculously similar strings by any standard (ok, soundex might help to disinguish the T and R in this case, but the names might as well be 400T and 400R), the first and the third are quite far from each other as strings, but are the same product. Obviously, the matching algorithm cannot be a 100% precise, my goal is to automatically match around 80% of the names with a high confidence. Any ideas or references is much appreciated

@TITLE:How do I form a good predicate delegate to Find() something in my List<T>?
@CONTENT:After looking on MSDN, it's still unclear to me how I should form a proper predicate to use the Find() method in List using a member variable of T (where T is a class) For example: public class Car
{
   public string Make;
   public string Model;
   public int Year;
}

{  // somewhere in my code
   List<Car> carList = new List<Car>();
   // ... code to add Cars ...

   Car myCar = new Car();

   // Find the first of each car made between 1980 and 2000
   for (int x = 1980; x < 2000; x++)
   {
       myCar = carList.Find(byYear(x));
       Console.Writeline(myCar.Make + myCar.Model);
   }
}
 What should my "byYear" predicate look like? (The MSDN example only talks about a List of dinosaurs and only searches for an unchanging value "saurus" -- It doesn't show how to pass a value into the predicate...) EDIT: I'm using VS2005/.NET2.0, so I don't think Lambda notation is available to me... EDIT2: Removed "1999" in the example because I may want to "Find" programatically based on different values. Example changed to range of cars from 1980 to 2000 using for-do loop.
@CODE:public class Car
{
   public string Make;
   public string Model;
   public int Year;
}

{  // somewhere in my code
   List<Car> carList = new List<Car>();

If I do a netstat -an it looks like udp port 514 is listening. However, if I scan the server from my laptop using nmap then I don't see udp 514. It's likely the port is being blocked somewhere.

@TITLE:Looking for a license key algorithm [closed]
@CONTENT:There are a lot of questions relating to license keys asked on Stack Overflow. But they don't answer this question. Can anyone provide a simple license key algorithm that is technology independent and doesn't required a diploma in mathematics to understand? The license key algorithm is similar to public key encryption. I just need something simple that can be implemented in any platform .NET/Java and uses simple data like characters. Answers written as Pseudo code are perfect. So if a person presents a string, a complementary string can be generated that is the authorisation code. Below is a common scenario that it would be used for. Customer downloads software which generates a unique key upon initial startup/installation. Software runs during trial period. At end of trial period an authorisation key is required. Customer goes to designated web-site, enters their code and get authorisation code to enable software, after paying :) Don't be afraid to describe your answer as though you're talking to a 5yr old as I am not a mathematician.

@TITLE:Running multiple sites from the same rails codebase?
@CONTENT:I have a client that wants to take their Rails app that has been successful in one niche and apply it to another similar niche. This new instance of the app is going to start out very similar: all the same functionality, different logo and colors. However, if the new site is successful it will inevitably need significant customizations that shouldn't be applied to the original site. At the same time, if bugs are fixed and improvements are made to one app, then both apps should be able to share those improvements. Can anyone suggest strategies or resources that address this issue? How do I keep changes that apply to both apps from taking significantly longer to test and implement? Yes, I know the answer involves SCM, plugins, gems, and Rails engines. These tools will and are being used. but I want to know when and how to use these tools towards solving this problem. Links are also welcome. This question is not the same as: Multiple websites running on same codebase? In my question, I'm not running the exact same app with different settings. How do you sync changes between multiple codebases? I'm asking a similar question, but I'm specifically asking about Rails apps.

@TITLE:How to keep up to date on latest computer science? [closed]
@CONTENT:I was re-reading some of my Steve McConnell books and this quote got me thinking 'scientists build in order to learn, engineers learn in order to build'. On the vein of 'learning in order to build' I was wondering: How are the software engineers keeping up to date on the latest technologies and research? It would seem that publications through the ACM or IEEE are the main avenue of publication for researchers, but given the closed nature of this information does anyone actually use it outside of the research community? This form of research is also very new, and very risky, so an additional question is where do you draw the line in risk? Is it worth looking at bleeding edge research or better to wait until it makes it to paperback. EDIT: I'm not a total noob. I've just noticed that (some) older developers are completely unaware of new technologies and can even be antagonistic to new tech. A healthy bit of skepticism is always useful, but willful ignorance is dangerous. In an effort to prevent this from happening to myself, I'm interested in how developers are staying up to date on new trends.

 There are instances to convert from C to B and from B to A. Yet, GHC typechecks the former, but fails for the latter. Upon inspection, seems like it isn't able to infer a generic enough type for get: get :: (Convert A b, Convert B b, Convert C b) => D -> b

@LINK:/questions/20414667/cocktail-party-algorithm-svd-implementation-in-one-line-of-code
@TITLE:cocktail party algorithm SVD implementation ¡K in one line of code?
@CONTENT:In a slide within the introductory lecture on machine learning by Stanford's Andrew Ng at Coursera, he gives the following one line Octave solution to the cocktail party problem given the audio sources are recorded by two spatially separated microphones: [W,s,v]=svd((repmat(sum(x.*x,1),size(x,1),1).*x)*x');
 At the bottom of the slide is "source: Sam Roweis, Yair Weiss, Eero Simoncelli" and at the bottom of an earlier slide is "Audio clips courtesy of Te-Won Lee". In the video, Professor Ng says, "So you might look at unsupervised learning like this and ask, 'How complicated is it to implement this?' It seems like in order to build this application, it seems like to do this audio processing, you would write a ton of code, or maybe link into a bunch of C++ or Java libraries that process audio. It seems like it would be a really complicated program to do this audio: separating out audio and so on. It turns out the algorithm to do what you just heard, that can be done with just one line of code ... shown right here. It did take researchers a long time to come up with this line of code. So I'm not saying this is an easy problem. But it turns out that when you use the right programming environment many learning algorithms will be really short programs." The separated audio results played in the video lecture are not perfect but, in my opinion, amazing. Does anyone have any insight on how that one line of code performs so well? In particular, does anyone know of a reference that explains the work of Te-Won Lee, Sam Roweis, Yair Weiss, and Eero Simoncelli with respect to that one line of code? UPDATE To demonstrate the algorithm's sensitivity to microphone separation distance, the following simulation (in Octave) separates the tones from two spatially separated tone generators. % define model 
f1 = 1100;              % frequency of tone generator 1; unit: Hz 
f2 = 2900;              % frequency of tone generator 2; unit: Hz

       1/dFar*sin(2*pi*f2*(t-dFar/c));

 After about 10 minutes of execution on my laptop computer, the simulation generates the following three figures illustrating the two isolated tones have the correct frequencies. However, setting the microphone separation distance to zero (i.e., dMic = 0) causes the simulation to instead generate the following three figures illustrating the simulation could not isolate a second tone (confirmed by the single significant diagonal term returned in svd's s matrix). I was hoping the microphone separation distance on a smartphone would be large enough to produce good results but setting the microphone separation distance to 5.25 inches (i.e., dMic = 0.1333 meters) causes the simulation to generate the following, less than encouraging, figures illustrating higher frequency components in the first isolated tone.

@LINK:/questions/16659326/simple-javascript-inheritance-using-extend-and-module-pattern
@TITLE:Simple javascript inheritance using $.extend and module pattern
@CONTENT:I have wondered for a couple years now what people think of doing inheritance with a module-pattern-esque constructor pattern and WITHOUT normal prototypal inheritance. Why do programmers not use a module pattern for non-singleton js classes? For me the advantages are: Very clear public and private scope (easy to understand the code and the api) No needing to track the 'this' pointer via $.proxy(fn, this) in callbacks No more var that = this, etc. with event handlers, etc. Whenever I see a 'this', I know it is context that is being passed into a callback, it is NOT something I am tracking to know my object instance. Disadvantages: Small perf degradation Risk possible "wag of the finger" from Doug Crockford? Consider this (just run in any js console) var Animal = function () {
    var publicApi = {
        Name: 'Generic',
        IsAnimal: true,
        AnimalHello: animalHello,
        GetHelloCount:getHelloCount
    };

    var helloCount = 0;

    function animalHello() {
        helloCount++;
        console.log(publicApi.Name + ' says hello (animalHello)');
    }

    function getHelloCount(callback) {
        callback.call(helloCount);
    }

    return publicApi;
};

var Sheep = function (name) {
    var publicApi = {
        Name: name || 'Woolie',
        IsSheep: true,
        SheepHello: sheepHello
    };

    function sheepHello() {
        publicApi.AnimalHello();
        publicApi.GetHelloCount(function() {
            console.log('i (' + publicApi.Name + ') have said hello ' + this + ' times (sheepHello anon callback)');
        });
    }

    publicApi = $.extend(new Animal(), publicApi);
    return publicApi;
};

var sheepie = new Sheep('Sheepie');
var lambie = new Sheep('Lambie');

sheepie.AnimalHello();
sheepie.SheepHello();
lambie.SheepHello();
 My question is what are the drawbacks to this approach that I am not seeing? Is this a good approach? Thanks! [update] Thanks for the great responses. Wish I could give everyone the bounty. It was what I was looking for. Basically what I thought. I would never use module pattern to construct more than a few instances of something. Usually only a couple. The reason I think it has its advantages is whatever small perf degradation you see is recaptured in the simplicity of the coding experience. We have a LOT of code to write these days. We also have to reuse other peoples' code and personally I appreciate when someone has taken the time to create a nice elegant pattern rather than dogmatically adhering to prototypal inheritance when it makes sense.

    var publicApi = {
        Name: 'Generic',

    };

    var helloCount = 0;

    function animalHello() {
        helloCount++;
        console.log(publicApi.Name + ' says hello (animalHello)');
    }

    function getHelloCount(callback) {
        callback.call(helloCount);
    }

    return publicApi;
};

var Sheep = function (name) {
    var publicApi = {
        Name: name || 'Woolie',
        IsSheep: true,
        SheepHello: sheepHello
    };

    function sheepHello() {

@TITLE:Comparing SIFT features stored in a mysql database
@CONTENT:I'm currently extending an image library used to categorize images and i want to find duplicate images, transformed images, and images that contain or are contained in other images. I have tested the SIFT implementation from OpenCV and it works very well but would be rather slow for multiple images. Too speed it up I thought I could extract the features and save them in a database as a lot of other image related meta data is already being held there. What would be the fastest way to compare the features of a new images to the features in the database? Usually comparison is done calculating the euclidean distance using kd-trees, FLANN, or with the Pyramid Match Kernel that I found in another thread here on SO, but haven't looked much into yet. Since I don't know of a way to save and search a kd-tree in a database efficiently, I'm currently only seeing three options: * Let MySQL calculate the euclidean distance to every feature in the database, although I'm sure that that will take an unreasonable time for more than a few images. * Load the entire dataset into memory at the beginning and build the kd-tree(s). This would probably be fast, but very memory intensive. Plus all the data would need to be transferred from the database. * Saving the generated trees into the database and loading all of them, would be the fastest method but also generate high amounts of traffic as with new images the kd-trees would have to be rebuilt and send to the server. I'm using the SIFT implementation of OpenCV, but I'm not dead set on it. If there is a feature extractor more suitable for this task (and roughly equally robust) I'm glad if someone could suggest one.

@TITLE:How to read an SQLite DB in android with a cursorloader?
@CONTENT:I'm setting up my app so that people can create groups of their friends. When a group is created, it writes 2 tables to the SQL database. The first table has a group name and a group id. The second table has 2 columns, a group id and a user id. This is working fine. However, now I want to be able to read from the database. I'm using a listview fragment with a cursorloader but I'm having trouble getting the information to display. I want to list all the group names from the first table in my list view. My problem is that, when I first used the cursorloader to list my contacts, I was using a Uri from the content provider in the onCreateLoader method. Specifically I had CONTENT_URI from the ContactsContracts.Contacts class. Example of cursorloader with contentprovider: @Override
public Loader<Cursor> onCreateLoader(int i, Bundle bundle) {
    Uri contentUri = ContactsContract.Contacts.CONTENT_URI;
    return new CursorLoader(getActivity(),contentUri,PROJECTION,SELECTION,ARGS,ORDER);
}
 However, without using a content provider, I don't know what to put in the onCreateLoader method because return new CursorLoader(...) requires a Uri in the second argument. Any suggestion on how I might be able to display my database data in a listview? fragment class code: public class GroupListFragment extends ListFragment implements LoaderManager.LoaderCallbacks<Cursor> {

@TITLE:Use of MBProgressHUD Globally + make it singleton
@CONTENT:In a Project I each of the user interaction events make a network call (Which is TCP, not HTTP). A need Activity Indicator to be global to show from a random UIViewController and hide from NetworkActivityManager Class (a custom class to handle network activities, Which is not a subclass of UIViewController or UIView). After searching the web I found out that MBProgressHUD is used for the same purpose, but I wasn't able to find out an example on how would I use it globally. (By saying global I mean a singleton object of MBProgressHUD and class methods to SHOW and HIDE it.) Following is what I have tried yet, but, failed: In AppDelegate.h: @property (nonatomic, retain) MBProgressHUD *hud; In AppDelegate.m: @synthesize hud; In some random UIViewController object: appDelegate.hud = [MBProgressHUD showHUDAddedTo:appDelegate.navigationController.topViewController.view animated:YES];
appDelegate.hud.labelText = @"This will take some time.";
 And while hiding it, from NetworkActivityManager Class: [MBProgressHUD hideHUDForView:appDelegate.navigationController.topViewController.view animated:YES];
 This makes the project to crash after some time (due to memory issues.) I am using ARC in my project and also, I am using the ARC version of MBProgressHUD. Am I missing something? Important Question: Can I make MBProgressHUD work like UIAlertView? (Saying that I mean implementation of MBProgressHUD independent of UIView -- sa it uses showHUDAddedTo: to present itself) ??? Please Note: In the above code of hiding MBProgressHUD, View may be changed from what it was when showing MBProgressHUD. Any Help greatly appreciated.

Does anyone know how to do this, or can anyone point me towards some documentation or sample code? EDIT ONE: I guess a start would be finding the location of the existing icons, and any related code. I noticed that Dropbox has files in Library/DropboxHelperTools/Dropbox_u501 called mach_inject_bundle_stub.bundle and FinderLoadBundle which might be doing the magic. Dropbox is also putting the 'tick' badge on Finder icons. This code might be involved: github.com/rentzsch/mach_star EDIT TWO: A Dropbox talk by Rian Hunter about the process is here, at around 15:30 http://blip.tv/pycon-us-videos-2009-2010-2011/pycon-2011-how-dropbox-did-it-and-how-python-helped-4896698 Looking in the DropboxBundle file in the Dropbox_u501 shows the icons and some compiled code. The code suggests that Rian Hunter is the author: http://twitter.com/timeserena Rian has his own version of the Mach Star code on his github - https://github.com/rianhunter/mach_star - tho it seems much older EDIT THREE There was a 'Code Injection Workshop' at Stanford a few weeks ago - http://stanfordacm.com/past/ - hosted by Rian. If anyone has notes from this please let me know!

@TITLE:Emacs Lisp Function Guide?
@CONTENT:I have been using Emacs for more than three years now but it still takes me days to write even small functions in Lisp. I've looked through GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual but it's huge and structured completely opposite from JavaDoc, not from functions to descriptions but the other way around. What will make my life much easier is some sort of small JavaDoc like document with most commonly used Emacs internal functions and they quick description. 
    (point) - returns current position in buffer
    (save-excursion (p)) - saves current position in buffer before 
                           executing (p) and restores it afterward.
 Does anyone know where I can find something like that?

@TITLE:Creating mask with CGImageMaskCreate is all black (iphone)
@CONTENT:I'm trying to create an image mask that from a composite of two existing images. First I start with creating the composite which consists of a small image that is the masking image, and a larger image which is the same size as the background: UIImage * BaseTextureImage = [UIImage imageNamed:@"background.png"];
UIImage * MaskImage = [UIImage imageNamed:@"my_mask.jpg"];
UIImage * ShapesBase = [UIImage imageNamed:@"largerimage.jpg"];
UIImage * MaskImageFull;

CGSize finalSize = CGSizeMake(480.0, 320.0);
UIGraphicsBeginImageContext(finalSize);
[ShapesBase drawInRect:CGRectMake(0, 0, 480, 320)];
[MaskImage drawInRect:CGRectMake(150, 50, 250, 250)];
MaskImageFull = UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext();
UIGraphicsEndImageContext();
 I can output this UIImage (MaskImageFull) and it looks right, it is a fullsize background size and it is a white background with my mask object in black, in the right place on the screen. I then pass the MaskImageFull UIImage through this: CGImageRef maskRef = [maskImage CGImage];
CGImageRef mask = CGImageMaskCreate(CGImageGetWidth(maskRef),
	CGImageGetHeight(maskRef),
	CGImageGetBitsPerComponent(maskRef),
	CGImageGetBitsPerPixel(maskRef),
	CGImageGetBytesPerRow(maskRef),
	CGImageGetDataProvider(maskRef), NULL, false);

CGImageRef masked = CGImageCreateWithMask([image CGImage], mask);
UIImage* retImage= [UIImage imageWithCGImage:masked];
 The problem is that the retImage is all black. If I send a pre-made UIImage in as the mask it works fine, it is just when I try to make it from multiple images that it breaks. I thought it was a colorspace thing but couldn't seem to fix it. Any help is much appreciated!

@LINK:/questions/15980963/opinion-on-asp-net-mvc-onion-based-architecture
@TITLE:Opinion on ASP.NET MVC Onion-based architecture
@CONTENT:What is your opinion on the following 'generic' code-first Onion-inspired ASP.NET MVC architecture: The layers, explained: Core - contain the Domain model. e.g. that's the business objects and their relationship. I am using Entity Framework to visually design the entities and the relations between them. It lets me generate a script for a database. I am getting automatically-generated POCO-like models, which I can freely refer to in the next layer (Persistence), since they are simple (i.e. they are not database-specific). Persistence - Repository interface and implementations. Basically CRUD operations on the Domain model. BusinessServices - A business layer around the repository. All the business logic should be here (e.g. GetLargestTeam(), etc). Uses CRUD operations to compose return objects or get/filter/store data. Should contain all business rules and validations. Web (or any other UI) - In this particular case it's an MVC application, but the idea behind this project is to provide UI, driven by what the Business services offer. The UI project consumes the Business layer and has no direct access to the Repository. The MVC project has its own View models, which are specific to each View situation. I am not trying to force-feed it Domain Models. So the references go like this: UI -> Business Services -> Repository -> Core objects What I like about it: I can design my objects, rather than code them manually. I am getting code-generated Model objects. UI is driven/enforced by the Business layer. Different UI applications can be coded against the same Business model. Mixed feelings about: Fine, we have a pluggable repository implementation, but how often do you really have different implementations of the same persistence interface? Same goes for the UI - we have the technical ability to implement different UI apps against the same business rules, but why would we do that, when we can simply render different views (mobile, desktop, etc)? I am not sure if the UI should only communicate with the Business Layer via View models, or should I use Domain Models to transfer data, as I do now. For display, I am using view models, but for data transfer I am using Domain models. Wrong? What I don't like: The Core project is now referenced in every other project - because I want/have to access the Domain models. In classic Onion architecture, the core is referenced only by the next layer. The DbContext is implemented in the .Core project, because it is being generated by the Entity Framework, in the same place where the .edmx is. I actually want to use the .EDMX for the visual model design, but I feel like the DbContext belongs to the Persistence layer, somewhere within the database-specific repository implementation. As a final question - what is a good architecture which is not over-engineered (such as a full-blown Onion, where we have injections, service locators, etc) but at the same time provides some reasonable flexibility, in places where you would realistically need it? Thanks

@TITLE:Building FFMPEG library for iOS6.0 ARMv7 Processor
@CONTENT:WARNING: I was just informed by another user that there are some legal issues revolving around using FFMPEG for iOS, leaving the link here http://multinc.com/2009/08/24/compatibility-between-the-iphone-app-store-and-the-lgpl/ I cleaned up my question a little bit, when I wrote it the first time I was flustered. Now I can be more clear after taking a small break. Edit: learned that you have to build for ARMv7, ARMv7s and iOS6.0 I'm trying to use the FFMPEG library in an XCode 4.5.1 project. And I'm trying to build it for ARMv7. What I'm looking for is the exact process, and some explanation. I understand that this is not a well documented problem. But I know that other pople have had the same problem as me. What I have been able to do. I have been able to build the library for testing. 1) I have been able to clone ffmpeg. For beginners this will get you started by creating a directory with the ffmpeg source. (Kudos to the guys who wrote it) git clone git://source.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.git ffmpeg 2) I have been able to write a config file that doesn't have any errors. We will go back to this part later. This is the command I attach to ./configure ./configure --disable-doc --disable-ffmpeg --disable-ffplay --disable-ffserver --enable-cross-compile --arch=arm --target-os=darwin --cc=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/usr/llvm-gcc-4.2/bin/arm-apple-darwin10-llvm-gcc-4.2 --as='gas-preprocessor/gas-preprocessor.pl /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/usr/llvm-gcc-4.2/bin/arm-apple-darwin10-llvm-gcc-4.2' --sysroot=/applications/xcode.app/contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneOS6.0.sdk --cpu=cortex-a8 --extra-ldflags='-arch=armv7 -isysroot /applications/xcode.app/contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneOS6.0.sdk' --enable-pic --disable-bzlib --disable-gpl --disable-shared --enable-static --disable-mmx --disable-debug --disable-neon --extra-cflags='-pipe -Os -gdwarf-2 -isysroot /applications/xcode.app/contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneOS5.1.sdk -m${thumb_opt:-no-thumb} -mthumb-interwork' These are some things to note. I had to download ( https://github.com/yuvi/gas-preprocessor ) copy the file gas-preprocessor.pl at /usr/local/bin. Set permissions to read write (777) Make sure I'm using the right GCC compiler: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/usr/llvm-gcc-4.2/bin/arm-apple-darwin10-llvm-gcc-4.2 Make sure I'm using the right SDK: /applications/xcode.app/contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneOS6.0.sdk --extra-cflags="-arch armv7" causes: error: unrecognized command line option ¡§-arch¡¨ Here in lies the problem. I can include the library like so libavcodec/avcodec.h But when I started to write the encoder. I received this warning, and countless errors. ignoring file /Users/Jimmy/Development/source.ffmpeg/Library/libavutil.a, file was built for archive which is not the architecture being linked (armv7s): /Users/Jimmy/Development/source.ffmpeg/Library/libavutil.a That means that I didn't build the right binary. What I'm looking for is someone whose done it before, to walk all of us through the process of building FFMPEG for iOS6.0 and ARMv7 and the majority of things to look out for. Thanks a ton.

@TITLE:How to publish from iOS application to facebook wall without user amending message
@CONTENT:I'm writing an iPhone game and want to publish the user's score to their facebook feed. I've managed to knock together an example where the user agrees with the authorisation and then a dialog appears which they can confirm to publish on their wall, or not publish. This is almost ideal, except that the text is an editable field - so the user could amend their score and then publish. Ideally, I want the exact same mechanism, but without the ability to amend the message. I'm assuming to do this, I would need to ask publish_stream permissions, followed by a Graph api call to post the message. I sourced this, but get an error 'An active access token must be used to query information about the current user.'. I'll happily take a point in the right direction over the actual code change - any help much appreciated. This is my first stackOverflow post, so be gentle please.

@TITLE:Do I need to use virtualenv with Vagrant?
@CONTENT:I was used VirtualBox manual setups with virtualenvs inside them to run Django projects on my local machine. Recently I discovered Vagrant and decided to switch to it, because it seems very easy and useful. But I can not figure - do I need still use virtualenv Vagrant VM, is it encouraged practice or forbidden?

@LINK:/questions/12033080/use-of-mbprogresshud-globally-make-it-singleton
@TITLE:Use of MBProgressHUD Globally + make it singleton
@CONTENT:In a Project I each of the user interaction events make a network call (Which is TCP, not HTTP). A need Activity Indicator to be global to show from a random UIViewController and hide from NetworkActivityManager Class (a custom class to handle network activities, Which is not a subclass of UIViewController or UIView). After searching the web I found out that MBProgressHUD is used for the same purpose, but I wasn't able to find out an example on how would I use it globally. (By saying global I mean a singleton object of MBProgressHUD and class methods to SHOW and HIDE it.) Following is what I have tried yet, but, failed: In AppDelegate.h: @property (nonatomic, retain) MBProgressHUD *hud; In AppDelegate.m: @synthesize hud; In some random UIViewController object: appDelegate.hud = [MBProgressHUD showHUDAddedTo:appDelegate.navigationController.topViewController.view animated:YES];
appDelegate.hud.labelText = @"This will take some time.";
 And while hiding it, from NetworkActivityManager Class: [MBProgressHUD hideHUDForView:appDelegate.navigationController.topViewController.view animated:YES];
 This makes the project to crash after some time (due to memory issues.) I am using ARC in my project and also, I am using the ARC version of MBProgressHUD. Am I missing something? Important Question: Can I make MBProgressHUD work like UIAlertView? (Saying that I mean implementation of MBProgressHUD independent of UIView -- sa it uses showHUDAddedTo: to present itself) ??? Please Note: In the above code of hiding MBProgressHUD, View may be changed from what it was when showing MBProgressHUD. Any Help greatly appreciated.
@CODE:UIViewController NetworkActivityManager @property (nonatomic, retain) MBProgressHUD *hud; @synthesize hud; appDelegate.hud = [MBProgressHUD showHUDAddedTo:appDelegate.navigationController.topViewController.view animated:YES];

@TITLE:Adding buttons to Finder toolbar?
@CONTENT:Dropbox has the option of adding a button to the Finder toolbar. It even appears in the 'Customize Toolbar...' window. ? I can't find any documentation on how this sort of thing is done.... Does anyone know how to do this, or can anyone point me towards some documentation or sample code? EDIT ONE: I guess a start would be finding the location of the existing icons, and any related code. I noticed that Dropbox has files in Library/DropboxHelperTools/Dropbox_u501 called mach_inject_bundle_stub.bundle and FinderLoadBundle which might be doing the magic. Dropbox is also putting the 'tick' badge on Finder icons. This code might be involved: github.com/rentzsch/mach_star EDIT TWO: A Dropbox talk by Rian Hunter about the process is here, at around 15:30 http://blip.tv/pycon-us-videos-2009-2010-2011/pycon-2011-how-dropbox-did-it-and-how-python-helped-4896698 Looking in the DropboxBundle file in the Dropbox_u501 shows the icons and some compiled code. The code suggests that Rian Hunter is the author: http://twitter.com/timeserena Rian has his own version of the Mach Star code on his github - https://github.com/rianhunter/mach_star - tho it seems much older EDIT THREE There was a 'Code Injection Workshop' at Stanford a few weeks ago - http://stanfordacm.com/past/ - hosted by Rian.

I've looked through GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual but it's huge and structured completely opposite from JavaDoc, not from functions to descriptions but the other way around. What will make my life much easier is some sort of small JavaDoc like document with most commonly used Emacs internal functions and they quick description.

    (save-excursion (p)) - saves current position in buffer before

@TITLE:Creating mask with CGImageMaskCreate is all black (iphone)
@CONTENT:I'm trying to create an image mask that from a composite of two existing images. First I start with creating the composite which consists of a small image that is the masking image, and a larger image which is the same size as the background: UIImage * BaseTextureImage = [UIImage imageNamed:@"background.png"];
UIImage * MaskImage = [UIImage imageNamed:@"my_mask.jpg"];
UIImage * ShapesBase = [UIImage imageNamed:@"largerimage.jpg"];
UIImage * MaskImageFull;

CGSize finalSize = CGSizeMake(480.0, 320.0);
UIGraphicsBeginImageContext(finalSize);
[ShapesBase drawInRect:CGRectMake(0, 0, 480, 320)];
[MaskImage drawInRect:CGRectMake(150, 50, 250, 250)];
MaskImageFull = UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext();
UIGraphicsEndImageContext();
 I can output this UIImage (MaskImageFull) and it looks right, it is a fullsize background size and it is a white background with my mask object in black, in the right place on the screen. I then pass the MaskImageFull UIImage through this: CGImageRef maskRef = [maskImage CGImage];
CGImageRef mask = CGImageMaskCreate(CGImageGetWidth(maskRef),
	CGImageGetHeight(maskRef),
	CGImageGetBitsPerComponent(maskRef),
	CGImageGetBitsPerPixel(maskRef),
	CGImageGetBytesPerRow(maskRef),
	CGImageGetDataProvider(maskRef), NULL, false);

CGImageRef masked = CGImageCreateWithMask([image CGImage], mask);
UIImage* retImage= [UIImage imageWithCGImage:masked];
 The problem is that the retImage is all black. If I send a pre-made UIImage in as the mask it works fine, it is just when I try to make it from multiple images that it breaks. I thought it was a colorspace thing but couldn't seem to fix it. Any help is much appreciated!

@LINK:/questions/15980963/opinion-on-asp-net-mvc-onion-based-architecture
@TITLE:Opinion on ASP.NET MVC Onion-based architecture
@CONTENT:What is your opinion on the following 'generic' code-first Onion-inspired ASP.NET MVC architecture: The layers, explained: Core - contain the Domain model. e.g. that's the business objects and their relationship. I am using Entity Framework to visually design the entities and the relations between them. It lets me generate a script for a database. I am getting automatically-generated POCO-like models, which I can freely refer to in the next layer (Persistence), since they are simple (i.e. they are not database-specific). Persistence - Repository interface and implementations. Basically CRUD operations on the Domain model. BusinessServices - A business layer around the repository. All the business logic should be here (e.g. GetLargestTeam(), etc). Uses CRUD operations to compose return objects or get/filter/store data. Should contain all business rules and validations. Web (or any other UI) - In this particular case it's an MVC application, but the idea behind this project is to provide UI, driven by what the Business services offer. The UI project consumes the Business layer and has no direct access to the Repository. The MVC project has its own View models, which are specific to each View situation. I am not trying to force-feed it Domain Models. So the references go like this: UI -> Business Services -> Repository -> Core objects What I like about it: I can design my objects, rather than code them manually. I am getting code-generated Model objects. UI is driven/enforced by the Business layer. Different UI applications can be coded against the same Business model. Mixed feelings about: Fine, we have a pluggable repository implementation, but how often do you really have different implementations of the same persistence interface? Same goes for the UI - we have the technical ability to implement different UI apps against the same business rules, but why would we do that, when we can simply render different views (mobile, desktop, etc)? I am not sure if the UI should only communicate with the Business Layer via View models, or should I use Domain Models to transfer data, as I do now. For display, I am using view models, but for data transfer I am using Domain models. Wrong? What I don't like: The Core project is now referenced in every other project - because I want/have to access the Domain models. In classic Onion architecture, the core is referenced only by the next layer. The DbContext is implemented in the .Core project, because it is being generated by the Entity Framework, in the same place where the .edmx is. I actually want to use the .EDMX for the visual model design, but I feel like the DbContext belongs to the Persistence layer, somewhere within the database-specific repository implementation. As a final question - what is a good architecture which is not over-engineered (such as a full-blown Onion, where we have injections, service locators, etc) but at the same time provides some reasonable flexibility, in places where you would realistically need it? Thanks

@TITLE:Building FFMPEG library for iOS6.0 ARMv7 Processor
@CONTENT:WARNING: I was just informed by another user that there are some legal issues revolving around using FFMPEG for iOS, leaving the link here http://multinc.com/2009/08/24/compatibility-between-the-iphone-app-store-and-the-lgpl/ I cleaned up my question a little bit, when I wrote it the first time I was flustered. Now I can be more clear after taking a small break. Edit: learned that you have to build for ARMv7, ARMv7s and iOS6.0 I'm trying to use the FFMPEG library in an XCode 4.5.1 project. And I'm trying to build it for ARMv7. What I'm looking for is the exact process, and some explanation. I understand that this is not a well documented problem. But I know that other pople have had the same problem as me. What I have been able to do. I have been able to build the library for testing. 1) I have been able to clone ffmpeg. For beginners this will get you started by creating a directory with the ffmpeg source. (Kudos to the guys who wrote it) git clone git://source.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.git ffmpeg 2) I have been able to write a config file that doesn't have any errors. We will go back to this part later. This is the command I attach to ./configure ./configure --disable-doc --disable-ffmpeg --disable-ffplay --disable-ffserver --enable-cross-compile --arch=arm --target-os=darwin --cc=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/usr/llvm-gcc-4.2/bin/arm-apple-darwin10-llvm-gcc-4.2 --as='gas-preprocessor/gas-preprocessor.pl /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/usr/llvm-gcc-4.2/bin/arm-apple-darwin10-llvm-gcc-4.2' --sysroot=/applications/xcode.app/contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneOS6.0.sdk --cpu=cortex-a8 --extra-ldflags='-arch=armv7 -isysroot /applications/xcode.app/contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneOS6.0.sdk' --enable-pic --disable-bzlib --disable-gpl --disable-shared --enable-static --disable-mmx --disable-debug --disable-neon --extra-cflags='-pipe -Os -gdwarf-2 -isysroot /applications/xcode.app/contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneOS5.1.sdk -m${thumb_opt:-no-thumb} -mthumb-interwork' These are some things to note. I had to download ( https://github.com/yuvi/gas-preprocessor ) copy the file gas-preprocessor.pl at /usr/local/bin. Set permissions to read write (777) Make sure I'm using the right GCC compiler: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/usr/llvm-gcc-4.2/bin/arm-apple-darwin10-llvm-gcc-4.2 Make sure I'm using the right SDK: /applications/xcode.app/contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneOS6.0.sdk --extra-cflags="-arch armv7" causes: error: unrecognized command line option ¡§-arch¡¨ Here in lies the problem. I can include the library like so libavcodec/avcodec.h But when I started to write the encoder. I received this warning, and countless errors. ignoring file /Users/Jimmy/Development/source.ffmpeg/Library/libavutil.a, file was built for archive which is not the architecture being linked (armv7s): /Users/Jimmy/Development/source.ffmpeg/Library/libavutil.a That means that I didn't build the right binary. What I'm looking for is someone whose done it before, to walk all of us through the process of building FFMPEG for iOS6.0 and ARMv7 and the majority of things to look out for. Thanks a ton.

@TITLE:How to publish from iOS application to facebook wall without user amending message
@CONTENT:I'm writing an iPhone game and want to publish the user's score to their facebook feed. I've managed to knock together an example where the user agrees with the authorisation and then a dialog appears which they can confirm to publish on their wall, or not publish. This is almost ideal, except that the text is an editable field - so the user could amend their score and then publish. Ideally, I want the exact same mechanism, but without the ability to amend the message. I'm assuming to do this, I would need to ask publish_stream permissions, followed by a Graph api call to post the message. I sourced this, but get an error 'An active access token must be used to query information about the current user.'.

 The above code is using the current HttpContext to fake a new Context and render the page with RenderPartial, we shouldn't have to do this.

@TITLE:How do I check that user already authenticated from tastypie?
@CONTENT:When user authenticates in Django, how do I check that from tastypie? Once user logs on, the view includes some JS that pulls data from API, which is backed by tastypie. I have basic authentication/djangoauthorisation set up on my resources, so the browser pops up http auth window. Is there any way to avoid this? My idea so far is to extend BasicAuthentication so that it first checks session data and when it doesn't find it, it falls back to http auth? AFAIK AJAX calls include session cookies, so this in theory should work? Has anybody done something similar?

@CONTENT:Has anyone managed successfully using cscope with Python code? I have VIM 7.2 and the latest version of cscope installed, however it doesn't get my code's tags correctly (always off by a couple of lines). I tried the pycscope script but its output isn't supported by the modern version of cscope. Any ideas? Or an alternative for browsing Python code with VIM?

@TITLE:How to debug a program without a debugger? [closed]
@CONTENT:Interview question- Often its pretty easier to debug a program once you have trouble with your code.You can put watches,breakpoints and etc.Life is much easier because of debugger. But how to debug a program without a debugger? One possible approach which I know is simply putting print statements in your code wherever you want to check for the problems. Are there any other approaches other than this? As its a general question, its not restricted to any specific language.So please share your thoughts on how you would have done it? EDIT- While submitting your answer, please mention a useful resource (if you have any) about any concept. e.g. Logging This will be lot helpful for those who don't know about it at all.(This includes me, in some cases :) UPDATE: Michal Sznajderhas put a real "best" answer and also made it a community wiki.Really deserves lots of up votes.

@TITLE:How to structure a Node, Express, Connect-Auth and Backbone application on the server-side?
@CONTENT:I'm a client-side guy that just stepped into the world of server-side javascript. I've got this idea about how I think I want to build my first Nodejs application. I want a server-side that pretty much only serves an empty shell and lots of JSON. I want to put the rest of the logic in a Backbone.js-equipped front-end. So I quick whipped up a small application (code in the bottom) and I've got a few questions. Are session variables safe? Can I use session variables to store an user identifier that I later read to fetch sensitive date. Is it possible to modify sessions variables so that, in my case, one user could get hold of another user's data? Does it make sense to serve JSON in the way I'm doing it on my '/profile' route. In my application there will be a lot of routes just like that one. Routes that fetch something from the database and serves them as JSON to the client. Looking at my code, do you have any tips or tricks? Things I should do differently. Modules I probably should have a look at? Does my idea of an almost JSON-only backend makes sense?

@TITLE:Working in sync with SVN upstream [closed]
@CONTENT:I'm working on a project that is using code from an OpenSource project. One of the requirements is to push as much code back to upstream as possible. The remote project is using Subversion (not very well). My current setup looks like this: [Remote SVN] (git svn fetch)-> [My public Git] <-(push/pull)-> [My dev. Git]
                                    VV
                                  (pull)
                                    VV
                               [Testing grid]
 EDIT 11.7. - reformulated the question My issue is the coexistence of my local public repo and the svn upstream. I have to provide 3 public branches: conservative stable experimental stable development These branches are now linear (development becomes experimental stable and experimental becomes conservative), but the target is a standard 3 headed approach with merging. Due to their public nature I can't rebase these branches. Now completely orthogonal to this I'm trying to somehow make sending patches to upstream easier. Digging them out from my branches is slow and prone to errors. My typical current workflow is: implement some feature on top development branch test & fix feature test & fix other features broken by this new feature (actually happens a lot) determine if this is something that could be accepted in upstream or not (30:60 yes:no) do something about it (I usually just write a new TODO) Another problem with the upstream is that they accept patches into different branches (my public branches are based on their stable branch). Once the patches reach stable branch I can simply forget that they exist, but until that happens I need to still keep them locally.

@TITLE:Is this a good use-case for Redis on a ServiceStack REST API?
@CONTENT:I'm creating a mobile app and it requires a API service backend to get/put information for each user. I'll be developing the web service on ServiceStack, but was wondering about the storage. I love the idea of a fast in-memory caching system like Redis, but I have a few questions: I created a sample schema of what my data store should look like. Does this seems like it's a good case for using Redis as opposed to a MySQL DB or something like that? How difficult is the setup for persisting the Redis store to disk or is it kind of built-in when you do writes to the store? (I'm a newbie on this NoSQL stuff) I currently have my setup on AWS using a Linux micro instance (because it's free for a year). I know many factors go into this answer, but in general will this be enough for my web service and Redis? Since Redis is in-memory will that be enough? I guess if my mobile app skyrockets (hey, we can dream right?) then I'll start hitting the ceiling of the instance.

@TITLE:Programming hire test - Test a developers knowledge in C# / ASP.NET [closed]
@CONTENT:We're hiring a .NET developer soon, and I was assigned to create a test, which would take aprox: 1h to solve. A test which would test the programmers knowledge in (mainly) C# and ASP.NET. This is what i've come up with so far: Use project #1 to read data(HTML) from the specified URL and output all links(anchors) containing anchor name ¡§xxxxxxxxx¡¨. You are free to use 3rd party libraries. My main thought here was to test how the developer would go about solving the problem. For example: Create a regex which would parse all the data needed. Create a DOM-tree and use XPATH to find all anchor nodes. Iterate the whole string and perform manual string compares. Create a new solution where you demonstrate the usage of .NET masterpages. Connect the solution to the ** database. And output all customers from the ¡§**_customers¡¨ table. Create a new button which refreshes all users using AJAX. Pretty basic stuff. Though, I also added the one below. Mainly to test the developers OO knowledge. Do you think this is too "overkill", or what kind of test would you suggest? If you were to hire a ASP.NET developer, what would your main focus be? ADO.NET? IO? string handling? Create an interface/abstract class implementation demonstrating the functionallity of either the Factory, Factory Method, Command or Decorator pattern. You wont need to implement any functionallity, just use comments in your abstract class. Thanks in advance!

@TITLE:UIImagePickerController editing allowed locks UIImage to max size of 320x320
@CONTENT:Update: With iPhone OS 3.0+, the whole UIImagePickerController API has changed. This question and answer should be considered 2.2. legacy code. When using the UIImagePickerController and you allow editing of the image. The iPhone allows the user to resize and pan the image. However, the max size of an edited image is capped at 320x320. As an example, I took an iPhone screenshot and placed it in the photo library, which is a 480x320 png. When I use a UIImagePickerController to select that image, even if I do NOT scale or pan the image, it is cropped to 320x320 before it is returned from the UIImagePickerController. However, if I turn editing off, the image is returned the proper 480x320 size. My theory: Very subtly, the iPhone displays 2 nonstandard translucent tool bars that overlay over the image. These toolbars leave an innocuous 320x320 "window" over the photo. It appears to me that this window effectively clips the underlying photo. Note: The callback also returns an editing dictionary with the original image and the clipping rect, but of course the rect is also max 320x320. Any ideas on how to allow images larger than 320x320 to be scaled and panned? Some code: - (void)imagePickerController:(UIImagePickerController *)picker didFinishPickingImage:(UIImage *)img editingInfo:(NSDictionary *)editInfo {

        self.myImageView.userInteractionEnabled=YES;
        CGRect imageFrame = myImageView.frame;

@TITLE:How to make Node.js Multi-tenant for websites on port 80?
@CONTENT:My end goal is to make node.js more cost effective per each server instance. I'm not running a game or chat room but rather simple websites for customers. I would like to house multiple clients on a single server yet have multiple websites running off of port 80 using host header mapping. I would like to still use express as I'm doing but have it be more like a routing thing from port 80 to the other node apps if that is even possible. Node can be cheaper if its done in this way but currently its more expensive for my purposes as each customer would need their own box if running on port 80. Also, my motivation is to focus on node development but there must be a reason to do so in terms of cost. I do this quite a lot for ASP.NET in Windows as IIS supports this out of the box and I know this is something normal for Apache as well. Feel free to move this to another forum in stack exchange if this is not the right question or give constructive criticism rather than a random downvote. Thanks.

One of the first things this reusable VC needs to do is pop up a UIActionSheet. In order to do this, I create a default (blank) view in my VC to show the action sheet from. However, this looks bad because, when the modal vc pops up, the parent vc is hidden. Thus it looks like the action sheet is floating over a blank background. It'd be better if the action sheet could appear to pop over the original (parent) vc. Is there a way to achieve this?

@TITLE:Fastest exit strategy for a Panic Button in Crisis/Abuse Websites? [closed]
@CONTENT:I am doing a website for a Women's Abuse Resource Center. A lot of centers like this have what is referred to by the centers as a "Panic Button". An example of a basic one is found here at the top of every page in the green bar. The idea of the link or button is for if a women was looking at this website for help, and their abuser or someone they didn't want to know walked in the room, it allows for a fast escape. Sometimes a link is much faster then closing a browser window and that can be suspicious. The problem I see is that most buttons I see doing this just send you to google or something like that. I am going to do something like this: <a href="http://www.msn.com/#news" rel="noreferrer">LEAVE WEBSITE NOW!</a>
 or <a href='data:text/html;charset=utf-8, <html><meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;URL=&#39;http://www.msn.com/#news/&#39;"></html>'>LEAVE WEBSITE NOW!</a>
 A link like that will scroll you to some actual content. Its not a blank Google search but is also not a very specific thing that could be seen as suspicious. I know that blocking the referrer is good but even with that solution you can hit the back button on your browser and your caught. For this problem I thought I could do something this: HTML <a href="javascript:goNewWin()" rel="noreferrer">LEAVE WEBSITE NOW!</A>
 JavaScript function goNewWin() {
    window.open("backbuttonnewpage.html",'TheNewpop','toolbar=1,location=1,directories=1,status=1,menubar=1,scrollbars=1,resizable=1'); 
    self.close()
}
 I am posting because there are lives at risk with this and I need something that is as close to a total solution as can be. How would you do this? ? UPDATE- 3-26-14: I ran some of the educational ideas posted here by the resource center I am working with and here was their answer. "It takes extreme courage for our users to even come on our website. When they come they are looking for a fast easy resource to get out of a possibly life threatening situation. They would not have the time or the mental capacity in most cases to educate themselves on a safe way to browse our website. When presented with the idea of a "panic button", when done properly, has seemed to be a resource that is always asked for by most victims that we treat." After reading a lot of the ideas here it seems like a total solution would be a large button that floats in a constant position on left hand side. When the page loads it loads another site in the background (maybe an ajax call) so that clicking the button just removes the overlaying frame. This will mean no load time when clicked. To avoid a back button press of the browser it seems like telling the browser not to cache is necessary as well as possibly using replaceState on every page change to disable a back button that reveals this site. This is still very much a technical question. The debate helps very much but I still need a working technical solution. Anyone think they are able to get all these ideas together into something functional? Ill be working on it right away myself and will post anything I come up with. Thanks all.

@LINK:/questions/26330425/what-makes-java-easier-to-parse-than-c
@TITLE:What makes Java easier to parse than C?
@CONTENT:I'm acquainted with the fact that the grammars of C and C++ are context-sensitive, and in particular you need a "lexer hack" in C. On the other hand, I'm under the impression that you can parse Java with only 2 tokens of look-ahead, despite considerable similarity between the two languages. What would you have to change about C to make it more tractable to parse? I ask because all of the examples I've seen of C's context-sensitivity are technically allowable but awfully weird. For example, foo (a);
 could be calling the void function foo with argument a. Or, it could be declaring a to be an object of type foo, but you could just as easily get rid of the parantheses. In part, this weirdness occurs because the "direct declarator" production rule for the C grammar fulfills the dual purpose of declaring both functions and variables. On the other hand, the Java grammar has separate production rules for variable declaration and function declaration. If you write foo a;
 then you know it's a variable declaration and foo can unambiguously be parsed as a typename.

@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: Which version of Perl should I use on Windows? [closed] 11 answers I'm totally new to Perl but I'd like to try it out. I read about two rival distributions available for Windows platform (I guess there's just Perl on other OSes :). Wikipedia says that Strawberry comes with additional dev tools to compile CPAN modules if necessary. Sounds pretty good to me. It also says that ActivePerl has a lot of prepackaged modules which are easier to install with PPM. Sounds great too! There's a clear trade-off between those two. And I wonder what should I pick to get started? If I pick one how hard is it to migrate to the other? Edit: I gave both distributions a run for a couple of weeks. I actually liked both which is a good thing! One can't go wrong with either of these. I ended up going with ActivePerl simply because it comes with offline documentation(in HTML) - a great life-savior for those who are on the road or just not always connected. It was super-easy for me to get started with Perl language while I was on vacation when I wasn't always online. Strawberry is at least as great if not greater. So I can totally recommend it, too. And I have to say one should just learn Perl - it's a very beautiful language. Give it a try!

For consistency with the UTC time strings returned elsewhere, the desired format is 2011-11-03 11:07:04 (followed by +00:00, but that's not germane).

 I'll add the best option that's occurred to me as a possible answer, but there may well be a more elegant solution. Edit: I should mention that I'm not actually printing the current time ¡V I used datetime.now to provide a quick example. So the solution should not assume that any datetime instances it receives will include microsecond components.

I thought that the buffer will be allocated on the stack, but that is not true. According to the C++ Standard this buffer is actually not temporary. What advantages does this function have over the global function ::operator new, which doesn't construct the objects either. Am I right that the following statements are equivalent? int* x;
x = std::get_temporary_buffer<int>( 10 ).first;
x = static_cast<int*>( ::operator new( 10*sizeof(int) ) );
 Does this function only exist for syntax sugar? Why is there temporary in its name? One use case was suggested in the Dr. Dobb's Journal, July 01, 1996 for implementing algorithms: If no buffer can be allocated, or if it is smaller than requested, the algorithm still works correctly, It merely slows down.

Once HomeScreen is started, I want to prevent the users to be able to return login or sign up screens with pressing BACK key. I tried using Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NO_HISTORY but since the application has Facebook integration, when the 'Login with Facebook' is used, Facebook should return to initial login screen, therefore I should keep a history of these activities.

}

@CONTENT:My team has been using the Enable Package Restore option since Nuget 1.5 to keep packages out of our source control. When Nuget 1.6 was released we noticed an issue where it wasn't pulling the packages down, and tracked it down to the Nuget.exe in the .nuget folder needed to updated to 1.6 to match the Package Manager. What's the best way to update a solution once Nuget has been udpated? I don't see an easy way from studio to tell which version of nuget is in the solution folder. So far we blow away the .nuget folder and re-run the Enable Package Restore command.

@TITLE:Left and Right Folding over an Infinite list
@CONTENT:I have issues with the following passage from Learn You A Haskell (Great book imo, not dissing it): One big difference is that right folds work on infinite lists, whereas left ones don't! To put it plainly, if you take an infinite list at some point and you fold it up from the right, you'll eventually reach the beginning of the list. However, if you take an infinite list at a point and you try to fold it up from the left, you'll never reach an end! I just don't get this. If you take an infinite list and try to fold it up from the right then you'll have to start at the point at infinity, which just isn't happening (If anyone knows of a language where you can do this do tell :p). At least, you'd have to start there according to Haskell's implementation because in Haskell foldr and foldl don't take an argument that determines where in the list they should start folding. I would agree with the quote iff foldr and foldl took arguments that determined where in the list they should start folding, because it makes sense that if you take an infinite list and start folding right from a defined index it will eventually terminate, whereas it doesn't matter where you start with a left fold; you'll be folding towards infinity. However foldr and foldl do not take this argument, and hence the quote makes no sense. In Haskell, both a left fold and a right fold over an infinite list will not terminate. Is my understanding correct or am I missing something?

 I need this for color conversion. Users provide their data in the form 0xARGB, and I need to convert it to 0xAARRGGBB. And yes, there could be millions, because each could be a pixel. 1000x1000 pixels equals to one million. The actual case is even more complicated, because a single 32-bit value contains both foreground and background colors. So 0xARGBargb become: [ 0xAARRGGBB, 0xaarrggbb ] Oh yes, one more thing, in a real application I also negate alpha, because in OpenGL 0xFF is non-transparent and 0x00 is most transparent, which is inconvenient in most cases, because usually you just need an RGB part and transparency is assumed to be non-present.

@CONTENT:We are looking to develop a data intensive application for mobile devices. Our central problem is We will have to store quite a lot of data on the client The client wants the app to work offline Our skill set is very much web development C# ASP.Net. Definitely not Objective C We have thought of three possibilities for dev Web application using HTML5 local storage leveraging the offline application cache. We are on a 5MB limit for local storage but this might be down to 2.5MB for certain browsers Web application through PhoneGap to create a native app. Big advantage here is that we can use the file system for storage. The down side is that it will have to go through App Store (for iOS especially) - 30% chuck of revenue for a subscription app to Apple We build out the app using MonoTouch for Android and iOS. Good - C# and .Net we can do this. Bad - no Blackberry Question I'm struggling to see any genuine advantages of using MonoTouch over PhoneGap in this instance. What are they? Are they any? As an example in this instance it would be really useful to save data onto the file system but I believe that phone gap can do this through the File object. Obviously monoTouch would leverage System.IO. Is there instances where there is definite additional functionality in MonoTouch - particularly functions that are useful to mobile dev e.g. Geolocation or camera type functions?. Or does phone gap pretty much have all these covered. Cheeky Additional Questions Is there any other options I have missed or any other major advantages/disadvantages for the three approaches I have outlined that I have forgotten about?

@TITLE:How to safely read a line from an std::istream?
@CONTENT:I want to safely read a line from an std::istream. The stream could be anything, e.g., a connection on a Web server or something processing files submitted by unknown sources. There are many answers starting to do the moral equivalent of this code: void read(std::istream& in) {
    std::string line;
    if (std::getline(in, line)) {
        // process the line
    }
}
 Given the possibly dubious source of in, using the above code would lead to a vulnerability: a malicious agent may mount a denial of service attack against this code using a huge line. Thus, I would like to limit the line length to some rather high value, say 4 millions chars. While a few large lines may be encountered, it isn't viable to allocate a buffer for each file and use std::istream::getline(). How can the maximum size of the line be limited, ideally without distorting the code too badly and without allocating large chunks of memory up front?
@CODE:std::istream void read(std::istream& in) {
    std::string line;

@LINK:/questions/16786656/gwt-and-google-cloud-endpoints
@TITLE:GWT and Google Cloud Endpoints
@CONTENT:A few days ago I've started developing a Backend for Mobile Applications using Google App Engine and Google Cloud Endpoints. This tutorial shows how the endpoints are getting generated automatically, as well as the client library for Android. So we have our Entity: @Entity
public class Person implements IsSerializable{

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Key key;

    private String name;
//...
} 
 And the endpoint for this class: @Api(name = "personendpoint")
public class PersonEndpoint {

    @ApiMethod(name = "getPerson")
    public Person getPerson(@Named("id") Long id) {
...
 Besides, using the generated Android Endpoint Library (that uses the REST API) I would like to add a User Interface on the Server, build with Google Web Toolkit (GWT). But how should I manipulate the date on Server Side? I can see different approaches... Option A1: Adding an RPC Service in GWT public interface PersonServiceAsync {

    void insertPerson(Person person, AsyncCallback<Person> callback);

}

@RemoteServiceRelativePath("api")
public interface PersonService extends RemoteService {

    public Person insertPerson(Person person);

}
public class PersonServiceImpl extends RemoteServiceServlet implements PersonService{
    public Person insertPerson(Person person) {
        EntityManager mgr = getEntityManager();
        try {
            if (containsPerson(person)) {
                throw new EntityExistsException("Object already exists");
            }
            mgr.persist(person);
        } finally {
            mgr.close();
        }
        return person;
    }

        //...
}
 But now my PersonServiceImpl and PersonEndpoint do roughly the same. So we didn't follow DRY :) Besides, that Person is not allowed to have com.google.appengine.api.datastore.Key so we would have to change our Entities. Option A2: Service calls endpoint class @Override
public Person insertPerson(Person person) {
    return new PersonEndpoint().insertPerson(person);
}
 Should work , but still no com.google.appengine.api.datastore.Key Type in the Entity and since Endpoints are using CollectionResponse<Person> we would have to transform this into an Collection<Person> in case of listPerson(). Option B1: Using the Java Endpoint Client Library We could split the GWT Client from our App Engine API Backend and use the generated Endpoint Client Libraries for Java. So we call the REST/Endpoint-API from within a RemoteServiceServlet. But wouldn't this end up in two Requests, even if the GWT client and Endpoints are on the same server or even in the same project? GWT Client --(RPC)--> GWT Server --(HTTP Request)--> App Engine Backend Server Option B2: Using the JavaScript Endpoint Client Library Might be the best approach but would end up in massive JSNI. So what's best practice? I can't find any example projects using Google Cloud Endpoints AND GWT in one project :)

@TITLE:OpenGL ES 2.0 Multiple Programs or Multiple Shaders or what? How does it work?
@CONTENT:The Problem (TL;DR) My problem, fundamentally, is that I do not know how OpenGL ES 2.0 expects me to write and use multiple shaders; or if it is even advisable/expected that a person will do so. The fundamental question here is: if I have an apple, a glowing rock and a fuzzy mesh, all in the same 3D world, all best drawn with different shader programs but using the same mvpMatrix then how would I go about using all of them in the same OpenGL render such that they all use their most appropriate shaders that I have written? What Have I done So I have written a basic OpenGL ES 2.0 program for my Android Game that works perfectly in that it can draw the outline of the objects to the screen. But it does nothing else; pretty much because the shaders look like this: Vertex Shader uniform mat4 uMVPMatrix;
attribute vec4 aPosition;

void main() {
    gl_Position = uMVPMatrix * aPosition;
}
 Fragment Shader void main() {
    gl_FragColor = vec4(1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0);
}
 Now they are pretty basic. The reason that I have not gone further is because I cannot figure out if I am supposed to write one shader to apply to all of my different objects or if I am supposed to use multiple shaders. And if I am supposed to use multiple shaders to draw multiple different objects then how do I go about doing that in an efficient way? I get the feeling that this must be basic knowledge to anybody that does OpenGL ES 2.0 day in and day out so I am hoping that somebody can answer my question or point me in the right direction. I have: Looked at multiple tutorials; none of which use anything but the most basic shaders. Read the entire OpenGL ES 2.0 GLSL Spec (none of which mentioned how it was intended to be used; it was just about what everything did rather than how it fits together). Tried to modify my shaders a bit. So I'm hoping that I am close to understanding the OpenGL workflow but I don't seem to be there yet. Edit: I found this well afterwards: If your application is written for OpenGL ES 2.0, do not create a single shader with lots of switches and conditionals that performs every task your application needs to render the scene. Instead, compile multiple shader programs that each perform a specific, focused task. That is from the iOS OpenGL ES 2.0 guidelines.
@CODE:uniform mat4 uMVPMatrix;
attribute vec4 aPosition;

void main() {
    gl_Position = uMVPMatrix * aPosition;
} void main() {
    gl_FragColor = vec4(1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0);

@TITLE:Settings.settings vs. app.config in .NET desktop app [duplicate]
@CONTENT:Possible Duplicate: What is the difference between app.config file and XYZ.settings file? I am quite confused by the apparent redundancy of these two mechanisms in Visual Studio to store and manage desktop application settings: You can use the XML app.config file, adding items to the <appSettings> section. These can be retrieved from code using the ConfigurationManager class. Alternatively, you can use the Settings.settings file to add individual settings through an editor. Visual Studio will generate a Settings class for type-safe retrieval of settings at run-time. These two mechanisms seem to serve the same (or nearly the same) purpose. I am aware there are some differences, but I am also puzzled by the overlap and its consequences. For example, when I use Visual Studio to add settings to the Settings.settings file, all the information that I put in ends up as entries in the app.config file as well. Apparently, a synchronisation mechanism exists: if I change a setting in the app.config file, Visual Studio prompts me to update the Settings.settings file next time I open it up in the editor. My questions are: Why two mechanisms and not just one? What are the most common scenarios for using app.config over Settings.settings, and vice versa? What happens if my app is using Settings.settings and I change a value in app.config after it's been deployed? No syncronisation of Settings.settings can happen since it's already been compiled and distributed. Note. I have searched for questions on this topic, but I am even more confused. For example, answers to this question here are quite contradictory and do not shed much light. Note 2. I am aware that app.config is a design-time file name, and I am familiar with the dynamics of Visual Studio copying and renaming it to the executable folder.

In the directed case, I of course care about directed distance (the shortest directed path from one vertex to another). Is there a better approach than computing all-pairs shortest paths? Edit: By "as far apart as possible", I of course mean the "longest shortest path" -- that is, the maximum over all pairs of vertices of the shortest distance from one to the other.

@TITLE:Sort rows in data.table (R)
@CONTENT:Let's say I have the following data.table in R:   library(data.table)
  DT = data.table(x=rep(c("b","a","c"),each=3), y=c(1,3,6), v=1:9)
 I want to order it by two columns (say columns x and v). I used this:  DT[order(x,v)] # sorts first by x then by v (both in ascending order)
 But now, I want to sort it by x (in decreasing order) and have the following code:   DT[order(-x)] #Error in -x : invalid argument to unary operator
 Therefore, I think this error is due to the fact that class(DT$x)=character. Could you give me any suggestion in order to solve this issue? I know I can use DT[order(x,decreasing=TRUE)], but I want to know the syntax to sort by several columns using both ways (some decreasing, some increasing) at the same time. Note that if you use DT[order(-y,v)] the result is ok, but if you use DT[order(-x,v)] there is an error. So, my question is: how to solve this error?

@LINK:/questions/8389253/correct-http-status-code-for-resource-which-requires-authorization
@TITLE:Correct http status code for resource which requires authorization
@CONTENT:There seems to be a lot of confusion about the correct http status code to return if the user tries to access a page which requires the user to login. So basically what status code will be send when I show the login page? I'm pretty sure we need to use a status code in the 4xx range. I'm not talking about HTTP authentication here, so that's at least 1 status code we aren't going to use (401 Unauthorized). Now what should we use? The answers (also here on SO) seem to vary: According to the answer here we should use 403 Forbidden. But in the description of the status code is: Authorization will not help and the request SHOULD NOT be repeated. Well that doesn't look like the right one. Since authorization WOULD help. So let?s check out some other answer. The answer here even doesn't use the 4xx range at all but rather uses 302 Found The description of the 302 Found status code: The requested resource resides temporarily under a different URI. Since the redirection might be altered on occasion, the client SHOULD continue to use the Request-URI for future requests. This response is only cacheable if indicated by a Cache-Control or Expires header field. I think that also isn't what I want. Since it is not the requested resource which resides under a different URI. But rather a completely different resource (login page vs authenticated content page). So I moved along and picked another answer surprisingly with yet another solution. This answer suggest we choose 400 Bad Request. The description of this status code is: The request could not be understood by the server due to malformed syntax. The client SHOULD NOT repeat the request without modifications. I think the server understood the request just fine, but just refuses to give access before the user is authenticated. Another answer also says a 403 response is correct, however it ends with: If this is a public facing website where you are trying to deny access based on a session cookie [that's what I do], 200 with an appropriate body to indicate that log in is needed or a 302 temporary redirect to a log in page is often best. So 403 is correct, but 200 or 302 is THE BEST. Hey! That's what I am looking for: THE BEST solution. But shouldn't the best be the same as the correct one? And why would it be the best? Thanks to all who have made it this far into this question :) I know I shouldn't worry too much about it. And I think this question is more hypothetical (not really, but used it because of lack of a better word). But this question is haunting me for some time now. And if I would have been a manager (who just picked up some cool sounding words as they always do) I would have said: but, but, but, but restfulness is important. :-) So: what is the right way? of using a status code in the above situation (if any)? tl;dr What is the correct http status code response when a user tries to access a page which requires login?
@CODE:4xx 401 Unauthorized 403 Forbidden 4xx 302 Found 302 Found 400 Bad Request 403 403 200 302 the right way? 412 Precondition Failed 403 Forbidden

@LINK:/questions/8273845/modernizr-with-respond-js
@TITLE:Modernizr with Respond.js
@CONTENT:I am carefully assessing the best way to utilize Modernizr and Respond.js for responsive design and have a couple of questions for the community. Firstly, it is my understanding that when bundling Modernizr with Respond.js, no other coding or tests are required for media query support in IE8 and below. In other words, when Respond.js is bundled with Modernizr I merely have to load Modernizr in my source to get Respond.js active. Correct? Secondly, do you believe this is the most efficient way to achieve support for media queries in IE8 and below? In essence, I would be including a larger Modernizr script than is needed for browsers that already support media queries. Wouldn't it be more efficient to separate the two scripts and only load Respond.js if a test for media queries fails? Third, if I would like to separate the two scripts, what do you believe is the best way to load Respond.js if needed? One option would be to use an IE specific conditional comment to load Respond. Another option is to use yepnope and Modernizr to test for media query support and load Respond if needed. Which would be more efficient and fault-proof. Lastly, if I choose to separate the two scripts and use Modernizr to load Respond if needed I have encountered the two following techniques: <script>
        yepnope({
    test : Modernizr.mq('(only all)'),
    nope : ['js/libs/respond.min.js']
});
</script>
 OR <script>Modernizr.mq('(min-width:0)') || document.write('<script src="js/libs/respond.min.js"><\/script>')</script>
 I have found that the second crashes IE8, but must just need rewriting. Which technique would you recommend? Thanks for all the help.
@CODE:<script>
        yepnope({
    test : Modernizr.mq('(only all)'),
    nope : ['js/libs/respond.min.js']
});
</script> <script>Modernizr.mq('(min-width:0)') || document.write('<script src="js/libs/respond.min.js"><\/script>')</script>

<appender name="myLogAppender" type="log4net.Appender.RollingFileAppender" >
    <file value="Logs\myLog.log" />
    <layout type="log4net.Layout.PatternLayout">

    </layout>
</appender>

<logger name="myLog">
    <level value="All"></level>
    <appender-ref ref="myLogAppender" />
</logger>
 And then when I want to write something in log, I can do the following: ILog log = LogManager.GetLogger("myLog");
log.Info("message");
 Another way to use it is to configure root to be as detailed as I want: <!-- language: xml -->

<root>
    <level value="Error" />
    <appender-ref ref="myLogAppender" />
</root>
 And in this case I can log messages like this: ILog log = LogManager.GetLogger(typeof(Bar));
log.Info("message");
 The benefits of second approach is that you can enable or disable some messages on the fly. But the problem is that I'm developing in EPiServer CMS and it has its own logging system that uses log4net and if I enable info logging at root level, then a lot of system logs will be written. How do you use log4net? Each part of a system writes in its own logger, or everything is written in default logger, and configuration decides what to do next?
@CODE:<!-- language: xml -->

<appender name="myLogAppender" type="log4net.Appender.RollingFileAppender" >
    <file value="Logs\myLog.log" />
    <layout type="log4net.Layout.PatternLayout">
        <conversionPattern value="%date %level - %message%n" />
    </layout>
</appender>

<logger name="myLog">
    <level value="All"></level>
    <appender-ref ref="myLogAppender" />
</logger> ILog log = LogManager.GetLogger("myLog");
log.Info("message"); <!-- language: xml -->

<root>
    <level value="Error" />

@LINK:/questions/5257002/mvvm-light-how-to-unregister-messenger
@TITLE:MVVM Light: how to unregister Messenger
@CONTENT:I love the MVVM Light's Messenger and its flexibility, however I'm experiencing memory leaks when I forget to explicitly unregister the recipients (in Silverlight 4). The cause is explained here, but I'm fine with it as I believe it's a good practice to explicitly unregister the recipients anyways rather than relying on the Messenger's use of weak references. The problem is that is easier said than done. ViewModels are easy: you usually have full control over their lifecycle and can just Cleanup() them when they are not needed anymore. Views on the other hand are trickier because they are instantiated and destroyed via DataTemplates. For ex. you can think of an ItemsControl with MyView as DataTemplate, bound to an ObservableCollection<MyViewModel>. The MyView controls are created/collected by the binding engine and you have no good way to manually call Cleanup() on them. I have a solution in mind but would like to know if it's a decent pattern or there are better alternatives. The idea is to send a specific message from the ViewModel to tell the associated View(s) to dispose: public class MyViewModel : ViewModelBase
{
    ...

    public override void Cleanup()
    {
        // unregisters its own messages, so that we risk no leak
        Messenger.Default.Unregister<...>(this);

        // sends a message telling that this ViewModel is being cleaned
        Messenger.Default.Send(new ViewModelDisposingMessage(this));

        base.Cleanup();
    }
}

public class MyView : UserControl, ICleanup
{
    public MyView()
    {
         // registers to messages it actually needs
         Messenger.Default.Register<...>(this, DoSomething);

         // registers to the ViewModelDisposing message
         Messenger.Default.Register<ViewModelDisposingMessage>(this, m =>
             {
                 if (m.SenderViewModel == this.DataContext)
                     this.Cleanup();
             });
    }

    public void Cleanup()
    {
        Messenger.Default.Unregister<...>(this);
        Messenger.Default.Unregister<ViewModelDisposingMessage>(this);
    }
}
 So when you call Cleanup() on a viewModel all the views that use it as DataContext will exeute their local Cleanup() as well. What do you think? Am I missing something obvious?
@CODE:Cleanup() ItemsControl MyView ObservableCollection<MyViewModel> MyView public class MyViewModel : ViewModelBase
{
    ...

    public override void Cleanup()
    {
        // unregisters its own messages, so that we risk no leak
        Messenger.Default.Unregister<...>(this);

        // sends a message telling that this ViewModel is being cleaned
        Messenger.Default.Send(new ViewModelDisposingMessage(this));

        base.Cleanup();
    }
}

public class MyView : UserControl, ICleanup
{
    public MyView()
    {
         // registers to messages it actually needs
         Messenger.Default.Register<...>(this, DoSomething);

         // registers to the ViewModelDisposing message
         Messenger.Default.Register<ViewModelDisposingMessage>(this, m =>
             {
                 if (m.SenderViewModel == this.DataContext)
                     this.Cleanup();
             });
    }

    public void Cleanup()
    {
        Messenger.Default.Unregister<...>(this);
        Messenger.Default.Unregister<ViewModelDisposingMessage>(this);
    }
}

@TITLE:Can Mercurial be made to preserve file permissions?
@CONTENT:I've seen a number of blog posts, and have experienced for myself, that Mercurial does not preserve the permissions on files pushed from one repo to another. Does anyone know of a Mercurial extension that would preserve the permissions? I'm assuming it can't be done with a hook, because what does a hook know about permissions at the originating repo? Requested elaboration: If the only change to a file is a change in permissions (e.g., chmod o+r filename), attempts to commit the file fail with a message saying that the file has not changed. If I commit a file with permissions 600 (rw-------), then clone the repo, the same file in the clone has permissions 664 (rw-rw-r--): : nr@yorkie 6522 ; hg clone one two
updating working directory
1 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved
: nr@yorkie 6523 ; ls -l one two
one:
total 4
-rw------- 1 nr nr 8 Aug 18 21:50 foo

two:
total 4
-rw-rw-r-- 1 nr nr 8 Aug 18 21:51 foo
 This examples shows that hg clone does not preserve permissions, but hg push does not preserve them either. In my application, one repo is on a publically accessible path, and it's of major importance that Multiple users have the right to change the repo Files in the public repo become readable only when explicitly made readable.
@CODE:chmod o+r filename : nr@yorkie 6522 ; hg clone one two

1 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved

The docs basically say it's a more optimized way of doing setTimeout, but that doesn't help much. I used to do a lot of ActionScript, so the idea of "waiting until the next frame" to execute code makes sense on some level - if you're running an animation you can have it update every frame rather than every millisecond for example. It also makes sense when you want to coordinate setting a bunch of variables - you change the variables in frame 1, and apply the changes in frame 2. Flex implemented something like this in their component lifecycle. My question is, what should I be using this for in server-side JavaScript? I don't see any places right off the bat where you'd need this kind of fine-tuned performance/flow control. Just looking for a point in the right direction.

@LINK:/questions/16838148/is-there-a-pattern-for-dealing-with-cancel-in-angularjs-modal-dialogs
@TITLE:Is there a pattern for dealing with ¡§Cancel¡¨ in AngularJS modal dialogs?
@CONTENT:Note: This is not about showing a modal dialog with AngularJS, that topic has plenty of questions and answers! This question is about how to react to both OK and Cancel within a modal dialog on a page. Let's say you've got a scope with just one variable in it: $scope.description = "Oh, how I love porcupines..."
 If I provide you with a modal dialog on the page and use ng-model="description" within that dialog, all of the changes you make are actually made in real time to the description itself as you type. That's bad, because then how do you cancel out of that dialog? There's this question that says to do what I explain below. The accepted answer for it is the same "solution" I came up with: AngularJS: Data-bound modal - save changes only when "Save" is clicked, or forget changes if "Cancel" is clicked I can see how to do it if clicking the button to bring up a modal goes back to a function in the back and that creates a temporary copy of the relevant data for the modal and then pops up the modal. Then "OK" (or "Save" or whatever) could copy the temporary values to the actual model values. main.js (excerpt): $scope.descriptionUncommitted = $scope.description;

$scope.commitChanges = function () {
  $scope.description = $scope.descriptionUncommitted;
}
 main.html (excerpt): <input type="text" ng-model="descriptionUncommitted"/>

<button ng-click="commitChanges()">Save</button>
 The problem with that is it's not declarative! In fact, it's nothing like AngularJS anywhere else. It's almost as though we need an ng-model-uncommitted="description" where they could make all the changes they want but they only get committed when we trigger with another declaration. Is there such a thing in a plugin somewhere or is AngularJS itself adding it? Edit: It seems that an example of a different way of doing it might be in order. main.js: $scope.filename = "panorama.jpg";
$scope.description = "A panorama of the mountains.";

$scope.persist = function () { // Some function to hit a back end service. };
 main.html: <form>
  <input type="text" ng-model-uncommitted="filename"/>
  <input type="text" ng-model-uncommitted="description"/>

  <button ng-commit ng-click="persist()">Save</button>
  <button ng-discard>Cancel</button>
</form>
 I stuck a form tag around it because I don't know how you would group the items so it was clear it was all part of the same "transaction" (for lack of a better word). But there would need to be some way that this could all happen automatically and the cloned copies of the model variables are used for initial values, used for input and updated automatically, validated, etc. and then finally discarded or copied to the same value that initially was used to create them if the user decides to commit. Isn't something like this easier than code in the controller to do that work over and over again for 20 modals in a big website? Or am I nuts?
@CODE:$scope.description = "Oh, how I love porcupines..." $scope.descriptionUncommitted = $scope.description;

$scope.commitChanges = function () {
  $scope.description = $scope.descriptionUncommitted;
} <input type="text" ng-model="descriptionUncommitted"/>

<button ng-click="commitChanges()">Save</button> $scope.filename = "panorama.jpg";
$scope.description = "A panorama of the mountains.";

$scope.persist = function () { // Some function to hit a back end service. }; <form>

@LINK:/questions/9317460/bitmap-performance-optimization-patterns
@TITLE:Bitmap Performance-Optimization Patterns
@CONTENT:I found several patterns for optimizing Bitmaps handling in WPF. I do not, however, understand when to use each patterns. As I think this is a common problem, I summarized what I understand and what I guess and ask for your help. If you can add patterns, explain how they differ, explain if they use the CPU or the GPU, and teach when to use each and how to combine them, it¡¦d be a tremendous help! Context ¡V the Images "Grid" Scenario: My application has to display many bitmap images. The images are displayed on the screen in a rows-and-columns grid-like organization (not necessarily the Grid or UniformGrid classes, think Window Media Player¡¦s Album view). Images might move between different grid cells. Some images at arbitrary cells may be replaced by others. Images should be clickable, should provide a context menu, should be selectable, drag-able etc. In other words, ¡§combine the little buggers into one big bitmap¡¨ is not applicable, at least not naively. Pattern 0: The Hack Do combine the little buggers into a bitmap (how? drawing context?), and use this as the background. Overlay this with images with empty content that will handle the hits, context menus, events etc. The advantage is that we're only speaking about two bitmaps here: The currently displayed one and the one that should replace it. This should be really fast. However, my years of experience raise the red flag of danger. Your comments? Pattern 1: Reduce Image Size This is a no-brainer when you know in advance the image size to resize to, and when you¡¦re prepared to lose details (color) for performance: Reduce the bitmap size using BitmapImage.DecodePixelWidth Reduce the color information using FormatConvertedBitmap.DestinationFormat Set the control¡¦s scaling behavior setting Image.Stretch to Stretch.None Set the SetBitmapScalingMode for the image to LowQuality. Freeze the bugger See code here. Pattern 2: Background pre-fetch This pattern is applicable when you think you can take advantage of the user gazing at the images on the screen, and prepare ahead the next images to display. The cons for your project, in addition to the memory overhead, is that it has to support the .Net Framework 4 target and not just the client profile, so it might incur an installation on the client¡¦s. You yourself will have to suffer the async programming pain. In this pattern you create exactly the required number of Image controls. When bitmaps need to be added, moved or deleted you only modify the Image controls' BitmapSource(s). A BackgroundWorker task is responsible for pre-fetching the BitmapSource(s) (possibly using the ¡§Reduce Image Size¡¨ pattern above) and inserting them into MemoryCache. For this to work you have to set the BitmapImage¡¦s CacheOption to OnLoad, so that the work is off-loaded to the background worker. Pattern 3: Drawing Context This was suggested by Sheldon Ziao from Microsoft Support on the MSDN WPF forum here. See page 494, Chapter 15 ¡§2D Graphics¡¨ in Adam Nathan¡¦s WPF 4 Unleashed for a description of DrawingContext. I can¡¦t say I understand it. According to the answer here, I would assume this would improve handling of Geometry drawings, not bitmaps. Next, I don¡¦t think this will support the focus and events requirements for the images (my bad for not explaining the requirements better at the forum) Moreover, I¡¦m worried by the book¡¦s summary sentence: ¡§Note that the use of DrawingContext doesn¡¦t change the fact that you¡¦re operating within a retained-mode system. The specified drawing doesn¡¦t happen immediately; the commands are persisted by WPF until they are needed.¡¨ This means that once our even handler re we can¡¦t take advantage of parallelism as in ¡§Background pre-fetch¡¨. Pattern 4: Writeable Bitmaps The MSDN documentation here describes it as a dual buffer system: Your UI thread updates the buffer; the WPF¡¦s render thread moves this to video memory. The intended usage (see here) is for bitmaps that change a lot such in a video movie like display. I¡¦m not sure, but possible this could be hacked and combined with the Background Pre-fetch pattern and used in the grid scenario. Pattern 5: Cached Bitmap Not much info on the MSDN (here). On the WPF forum archive (here) it¡¦s explained that ¡§The BitmapCache API is designed to cache your content (when rendering in hardware) in video memory, meaning it stays resident on your GPU. This saves you the cost of re-rendering that content when drawing it to the screen.¡¨ This seems like a great idea. I¡¦m not sure, however, what are the pitfalls and how to use it. Pattern 6: RenderTargetBitmap The RenderTargetBitmap converts a Visual to a bitmap. I¡¦m not sure if it¡¦s relevant here. See here. Edit: Regarding Paul Hoenecke question: I've written that "My application has to display many bitmap iages". I failed to mentions that I need to display about 800 images concurrently. One can read about the performance issues involved at my SO questions WPF Bitmap performance and How can I make displaying images on WPF more ¡§snappy¡¨? I've modified the description of pattern 1 to highlight the concept that the image controls aren't created or deleted (unless we want to display a larger or smaller grid). Only their Sources are set to different, new or null BitmapSources. Edit: This question as posted on the WPF support forum, with some answers from MS personnel.

@LINK:/questions/5655439/net-4-memorycache-leaks-with-concurrent-garbage-collection
@TITLE:.Net 4 MemoryCache Leaks with Concurrent Garbage Collection
@CONTENT:I'm using the new MemoryCache in .Net 4, with a max cache size limit in MB (I've tested it set between 10 and 200MB, on systems with between 1.75 and 8GB of memory). I don't set any time based expiration on the objects, as I'm using the cache simply as a high performance drive, and as long as there is space, I want it used. To my surprise, the cache refused to evict any objects, to the point that I would get SystemOutOfMemory exceptions. I fired up perfmon, wired up my application to .Net CLR Memory\#Bytes In All Heaps, .Net Memory Cache 4.0, and Process\Private Bytes -- indeed, the memory consumption was out of control, and no cache trims were being registered. Did some googling and stackoverflowing, downloaded and attached the CLRProfiler, and wham: evictions everywhere! The memory stayed within reasonable bounds based upon the memory size limit I had set. Ran it in debug mode again, no evictions. CLRProfiler again, evictions. I finally noticed that the profiler forced the application to run without concurrent garbage collection (also see useful SO Concurrent Garbage Collection Question). I turned it off in my app.config, and, sure enough, evictions! This seems like at best an outrageous lack of documentation to not say: this only works with non-concurrent garbage collection -- though I image since its ported from ASP.NET, they may not have had to worry about concurrent garbage collection. So has anyone else seen this? I'd love to get some other experiences out there, and maybe some more educated insights. Update 1 I've reproduced the issue within a single method: it seems that the cache must be written to in parallel for the cache evictions not to fire (in concurrent garbage collection mode). If there is some interest, I'll upload the test code to a public repo. I'm definitely getting toward the deep end of the the CLR/GC/MemoryCache pool, and I think I forgot my floaties... Update 2 I published test code on CodePlex to reproduce the issue. Also, possibly of interest, the original production code runs in Azure, as a Worker Role. Interesting, changing the GC concurrency setting in the role's app.config has no effect. Possibly Azure overrides GC settings much like ASP.NET? Further, running the test code under WPF vs a Console application will produce slightly different eviction results.

@TITLE:Nginx rewrite non-www-prefixed domain to www-prefixed domain
@CONTENT:I see the Nginx HttpRewriteModule documentation has an example to rewrite a www-prefixed domain to a non-www-prefixed domain: if ($host ~* www\.(.*)) {
  set $host_without_www $1;
  rewrite ^(.*)$ http://$host_without_www$1 permanent; # $1 contains '/foo', not 'www.mydomain.com/foo'
}
 How can I do the reverse-- rewrite a non-www-prefixed domain to a www-prefixed domain? I thought maybe I could do something like the following but Nginx doesn't like the nested if statement. if ($host !~* ^www\.) {                       # check if host doesn't start with www.
    if ($host ~* ([a-z0-9]+\.[a-z0-9]+)) {    # check host is of the form xxx.xxx (i.e. no subdomain)
        set $host_with_www www.$1;
        rewrite ^(.*)$ http://$host_with_www$1 permanent;
    }
}
 Also I wanted this to work for any domain name without explicitly telling Nginx to rewrite domain1.com -> www.domain1.com, domain2.com -> www.domain2.com, etc. since I have a large number of domains to rewrite.
@CODE:if ($host ~* www\.(.*)) {
  set $host_without_www $1;
  rewrite ^(.*)$ http://$host_without_www$1 permanent; # $1 contains '/foo', not 'www.mydomain.com/foo'
} if ($host !~* ^www\.) {                       # check if host doesn't start with www.
    if ($host ~* ([a-z0-9]+\.[a-z0-9]+)) {    # check host is of the form xxx.xxx (i.e. no subdomain)
        set $host_with_www www.$1;

@TITLE:Why use Macros in C? [duplicate]
@CONTENT:Possible Duplicate: What are C macros useful for? Every few months I get an itch to go learn some bit of C that my crap college programming education never covered. Today it's macros. My basic understanding of macros is they're a simple search and replace that happens on your code prior to it being compiled. I'm having trouble understanding why you'd use macros. Most of the basic examples I'm looking at are something like TEST(a,%d);
#define TEST(a,b) printf(" The value of " #a " = " #b " \n", a)

//which expands to 
printf(" The value of a = %d \n",a);
 (example from here) From my newbie point of view, it seems like defining a new function would give you the same results. I can see how historically macros would be useful for modifying a lot of source quickly in the days before easy search and replace, but something tells me I'm missing some bigger point. So what kind of useful things can macros do for you?
@CODE:TEST(a,%d);
#define TEST(a,b) printf(" The value of " #a " = " #b " \n", a)

@LINK:/questions/908256/getting-template-metaprogramming-compile-time-constants-at-runtime
@TITLE:Getting template metaprogramming compile-time constants at runtime
@CONTENT:Background Consider the following: template <unsigned N>
struct Fibonacci
{
    enum
    {
    	value = Fibonacci<N-1>::value + Fibonacci<N-2>::value
    };
};

template <>
struct Fibonacci<1>
{
    enum
    {
    	value = 1
    };
};

template <>
struct Fibonacci<0>
{
    enum
    {
    	value = 0
    };
};
 This is a common example and we can get the value of a Fibonacci number as a compile-time constant: int main(void)
{
    std::cout << "Fibonacci(15) = ";
    std::cout << Fibonacci<15>::value;
    std::cout << std::endl;
}
 But you obviously cannot get the value at runtime: int main(void)
{
    std::srand(static_cast<unsigned>(std::time(0)));

    // ensure the table exists up to a certain size
    // (even though the rest of the code won't work)
    static const unsigned fibbMax = 20;
    Fibonacci<fibbMax>::value;

    // get index into sequence
    unsigned fibb = std::rand() % fibbMax;

    std::cout << "Fibonacci(" << fibb << ") = ";
    std::cout << Fibonacci<fibb>::value;
    std::cout << std::endl;
}
 Because fibb is not a compile-time constant. Question So my question is: What is the best way to peek into this table at run-time? The most obvious solution (and "solution" should be taken lightly), is to have a large switch statement: unsigned fibonacci(unsigned index)
{
    switch (index)
    {
    case 0:
    	return Fibonacci<0>::value;
    case 1:
    	return Fibonacci<1>::value;
    case 2:
    	return Fibonacci<2>::value;
    .
    .
    .
    case 20:
    	return Fibonacci<20>::value;
    default:
    	return fibonacci(index - 1) + fibonacci(index - 2);
    }
}

int main(void)
{
    std::srand(static_cast<unsigned>(std::time(0)));

    static const unsigned fibbMax = 20;    

    // get index into sequence
    unsigned fibb = std::rand() % fibbMax;

    std::cout << "Fibonacci(" << fibb << ") = ";
    std::cout << fibonacci(fibb);
    std::cout << std::endl;
}
 But now the size of the table is very hard coded and it wouldn't be easy to expand it to say, 40. The only one I came up with that has a similiar method of query is this: template <int TableSize = 40>
class FibonacciTable
{
public:
    enum
    {
    	max = TableSize
    };

    static unsigned get(unsigned index)
    {
    	if (index == TableSize)
    	{
    		return Fibonacci<TableSize>::value;
    	}
    	else
    	{
    		// too far, pass downwards
    		return FibonacciTable<TableSize - 1>::get(index);
    	}
    }
};

template <>
class FibonacciTable<0>
{
public:
    enum
    {
    	max = 0
    };

    static unsigned get(unsigned)
    {
    	// doesn't matter, no where else to go.
    	// must be 0, or the original value was
    	// not in table
    	return 0;
    }
};

int main(void)
{
    std::srand(static_cast<unsigned>(std::time(0)));

    // get index into sequence
    unsigned fibb = std::rand() % FibonacciTable<>::max;

    std::cout << "Fibonacci(" << fibb << ") = ";
    std::cout << FibonacciTable<>::get(fibb);
    std::cout << std::endl;
}
 Which seems to work great. The only two problems I see are: Potentially large call stack, since calculating Fibonacci<2> requires we go through TableMax all the way to 2, and: If the value is outside of the table, it returns zero as opposed to calculating it. So is there something I am missing? It seems there should be a better way to pick out these values at runtime. A template metaprogramming version of a switch statement perhaps, that generates a switch statement up to a certain number? Thanks in advance.

@LINK:/questions/194534/using-dependency-injection-frameworks-for-classes-with-many-dependencies
@TITLE:Using Dependency Injection frameworks for classes with many dependencies
@CONTENT:I have been looking at various dependency injection frameworks for .NET as I feel the project I am working on would greatly benefit from it. While I think I have a good grasp of the capabilities of these frameworks, I am still a little unclear on how best to introduce them into a large system. Most demos (understandably) tend to be of quite simple classes that have one or two dependencies. I have three questions... First, how do you deal with those common but uninteresting dependencies, e.g. ILog, IApplicationSettings, IPermissions, IAudit. It seems overkill for every class to have these as parameters in their constructor. Would it be better to use a static instance of the DI container to get these when they are needed? MyClass(ILog log, IAudit audit, IPermissions permissions, IApplicationSettings settings)
// ... versus ...
ILog log = DIContainer.Get<ILog>();
 Second, how do you approach dependencies that might be used, but may be expensive to create. Example - a class might have a dependency on an ICDBurner interface but not want the concrete implementation to be created unless the CD Burning feature was actually used. Do you pass in interfaces to factories (e.g. ICDBurnerFactory) in the constructor, or do you again go with some static way of getting directly to the DI Container and ask for it at the point it is needed? Third, suppose you have a large Windows Forms application, in which the top level GUI component (e.g. MainForm) is the parent of potentially hundreds of sub-panels or modal forms, each of which may have several dependencies. Does this mean that MainForm should be set up to have as dependencies the superset of all the dependencies of its children? And if you did so, wouldn't this end up creating a huge self-inflating monster that constructs every single class it could ever need the moment you create MainForm, wasting time and memory in the process?
@CODE:MyClass(ILog log, IAudit audit, IPermissions permissions, IApplicationSettings settings)
// ... versus ...
ILog log = DIContainer.Get<ILog>();

@LINK:/questions/15829657/mvc-authentication-and-antiforgery-token-with-durandal-spa-template
@TITLE:MVC Authentication and Antiforgery token with Durandal SPA template
@CONTENT:Some areas of my SPA need to be open to all users, and some areas require authentication. In these areas, it's the data loaded via AJAX that I want to protect. I have an authentication service (see below), which I add as a dependency in my durandal main.js. The service is called: authentication
 In my main.js I call authentication.handleUnauthorizedAjaxRequest(function () {
        app.showMessage('You are not authorized, please login')
        .then(function () {
            router.navigateTo('#/user/login');
        });
    });
 It warns the user they are not authorized, and navigates user to a login view/viewmodel where they can enter details and try logging in. Some questions that come to mind when building this authentication viewModel: Are there any obvious concerns with what I'm doing? Is this how I'm 'meant' to do things in Durandal? Am I re-inventing the wheel? I couldn't see anything like this within Durandal. Most people seem to be creating seperate cshtml pages; one for login (if the user is not authenticated), and the usual index.cshtml Is there any good reasons for me to switch to that method? My login action on my the server-side 'user controller' has the [ValidateAntiForgeryToken] attribute I need to send that as well. I also have an 'antiforgery' service (see below) which I also add as a dependency in my main.js viewModel file then (also in my main.js). antiforgery.addAntiForgeryTokenToAjaxRequests();
 This intercepts all ajax requests (along with content), and adds the MVC AntiForgeryToken value to the data. Seems to work exactly as I want it to. Please let me know if there's any errors/mistakes. Complete authentication service below. // services/authentication.js

            </form>

            2) in  main.js ensure that this module is added as a dependency

            3) in main.js add the following line

@CONTENT:I was wondering what you should set the Context pointer in KVO when you are observing a property. I'm just starting to use KVO and I haven't gleaned too much from the documentation. I see on this page: http://www.jakeri.net/2009/12/custom-callout-bubble-in-mkmapview-final-solution/ the author does this: [annView addObserver:self
forKeyPath:@"selected"
options:NSKeyValueObservingOptionNew
context:GMAP_ANNOTATION_SELECTED];
 And then in the callback, does this: - (void)observeValueForKeyPath:(NSString *)keyPath
ofObject:(id)object
change:(NSDictionary *)change
context:(void *)context{

NSString *action = (NSString*)context;


if([action isEqualToString:GMAP_ANNOTATION_SELECTED]){
 I'm assuming in this scenario, the author just creates a string to be identified later in the callback. Then in iOS 5 Pushing the Limits book, I see he does this: [self.target addObserf:self forKeyPath:self.property options:0 context:(__bridge void *)self];
 callback: if ((__bridge id)context == self) {
}
else {
   [super observeValueForKeyPath .......];
}
 I was wondering if there is a standard or best practices to pass into the context pointer? Thanks!

@CONTENT:I have started work on FP recently after reading a lot of blogs and posts about advantages of FP for concurrent execution and performance. My need for FP has been largely influenced by the application that I am developing, My application is a state based data injector into another subsystem where timing is very crucial (close to a 2 million transactions per sec). I have a couple of such subsystems which needs to be tested. I am seriously considering using FP for its parallelism and want to take the correct approach, many posts on SO talk about disadvantages and advantages of Scala, Haskell and Clojure wrt language constructs, libraries and JVM support. From a language point of view I am ok to learn any language as long as it will help me achieve the result. Certain posts favor Haskell for pattern matching and simplicity of language, JVM based FP lang have a big advantage with respect to using existing java libraries. JaneStreet is a big OCAML supporter but I am really not sure about developer support and help forums for OCAML. If anybody has worked with handling such large data, please share your experience.

@TITLE:Implementation of achievement systems in modern, complex games
@CONTENT:Many games that are created these days come with their own achievement system that rewards players/users for accomplishing certain tasks. The badges system here on stackoverflow is exactly the same. There are some problems though for which I couldn't figure out good solutions. Achievement systems have to watch out for certain events all the time, think of a game that offers 20 to 30 achievements for e.g.: combat. The server would have to check for these events (e.g.: the player avoided x attacks of the opponent in this battle or the player walked x miles) all time. How can a server handle this large amount of operations without slowing down and maybe even crashing? Achievement systems usually need data that is only used in the core engine of the game and wouldn't be needed out of there anyway if there weren't those nasty achievements (think of e.g.: how often the player jumped during each fight, you don't want to store all this information in a database.). What I mean is that in some cases the only way of adding an achievement would be adding the code that checks for its current state to the game core, and thats usually a very bad idea. How do achievement systems interact with the core of the game that holds the later unnecessary information? (see examples above) How are they separated from the core of the game? My examples may seem "harmless" but think of the 1000+ achievements currently available in World of Warcraft and the many, many players online at the same time, for example.

I don't have the time or knowledge of the system needed to create a Selenium script. Besides, I don't want to check a specific use case - I want to verify every link and page on the site. I would like to create an automated system test that will spider through a site and check for broken links and crashes. Ideally, there would be a tool that I could use to achieve this. It should have as many as possible of the following features, in descending order of priority: Triggered via script Does not require human interaction Follows all links including anchor tags and links to CSS and js files Produces a log of all found 404s, 500s etc. Can be deployed locally to check sites on intranets Supports cookie/form-based authentication Free/Open source There are many partial solutions out there, like FitNesse, Firefox's LinkChecker and the W3C link checker, but none of them do everything I need. I would like to use this test with projects using a range of technologies and platforms, so the more portable the solution the better. I realise this is no substitute for proper system testing, but it would be very useful if I had a convenient and automatable way of verifying that no part of the site was obviously broken.

 I'd like to move around and edit this file using familiar vim movements. For instance, using (, ), [[, ]], {, } or deleting/yanking/changing text using commands like di}. In other languages (like C++, Java, C#, etc) you've got curly brackets abound, so using a movement like di} can easily find a matching curly brace and act on that block. And in fact if I am on the 'b' character on the above text and do a di) in vim, it successfully deletes the text between the two parens. The issue is in python's detection of code blocks, I think. Using (, ), [[, ]], {, or } as movements all pretty much do the same thing, bringing you to the start (above or on the def line) or end (after the last line of the function) of the function. And there is no way, as far as I know, to easily tell vim "select everything for this indentation block." In the above example, I'd like to be on in 'i' of the if line, type di} and have it delete the entire if block (to the end of this particular function). I'm sure it should be possible to tell vim to operate on an indentation basis for such movements (well, maybe not that particular movement, but some user defined action). Any thoughts on how to accomplish this?

@TITLE:When do you start additional Elasticsearch nodes?
@CONTENT:I'm in the middle of attempting to replace a Solr setup with Elasticsearch. This is a new setup, which has not yet seen production, so I have lots of room to fiddle with things and get them working well. I have very, very large amounts of data. I'm indexing some live data and holding onto it for 7 days (by using the _ttl field). I do not store any data in the index (and disabled the _source field). I expect my index to stabilize around 20 billion rows. I will be putting this data into 2-3 named indexes. Search performance so far with up to a few billion rows is totally acceptable, but indexing performance is an issue. I am a bit confused about how ES uses shards internally. I have created two ES nodes, each with a separate data directory, each with 8 indexes and 1 replica. When I look at the cluster status, I only see one shard and one replica for each node. Doesn't each node keep multiple indexes running internally? (Checking the on-disk storage location shows that there is definitely only one Lucene index present). -- Resolved, as my index setting was not picked up properly from the config. Creating the index using the API and specifying the number of shards and replicas has now produced exactly what I would've expected to see. Also, I tried running multiple copies of the same ES node (from the same configuration), and it recognizes that there is already a copy running and creates its own working area. These new instances of nodes also seem to only have one index on-disk. -- Now that each node is actually using multiple indices, a single node with many indices is more than sufficient to throttle the entire system, so this is a non-issue. When do you start additional Elasticsearch nodes, for maximum indexing performance? Should I have many nodes each running with 1 index 1 replica, or fewer nodes with tons of indexes? Is there something I'm missing with my configuration in order to have single nodes doing more work? Also: Is there any metric for knowing when an HTTP-only node is overloaded? Right now I have one node devoted to HTTP only, but aside from CPU usage, I can't tell if it's doing OK or not. When is it time to start additional HTTP nodes and split up your indexing software to point to the various nodes?

Since the core of the profiler is in JavaScript, JQuery.tmpl and Less it seems that porting the back-end to Rails would be fairly straight forward, the front-end is already done. The front end architecture allows for POST and AJAX request profiling by attaching profiling ids to every request in a custom header (X-MiniProfiler-Ids). There is a similar port for Python and GAE. Even though Rack Bug is fairly interesting, the UI is not as rich - POST and AJAX support is not there, there is no API for profiling blocks and use in production is not recommended. Similarly, NewRelic in dev mode is not supported in production and does not have the famous MiniProfiler "chicklet" rendered on each page. Is there a port of MiniProfiler in Rails?

@CONTENT:I've been doing web application development for the last 3 years in PHP. I'm now on the verge to give Java a go. My last use of the language was nearly 8 years ago and was mostly academic. I'm reasonably well acquainted with PHP's object model (version 5) and I have almost exclusively been coding in OO. I would now like to transport that experience and use it to develop in Java. Where I'm coming from: linux as a desktop and server Vim/gVim + plugins as an editor MySql for db apache httpd experience with a bunch of PHP frameworks, Zend+Doctrine being the ones I use most What I've garnered so far about a move to Java: I need an IDE: IntellijIDEA, NetBeans or Eclipse I need to pick a development framework. Some recurrent names: Spring MVC, stripes, wicket. Now I need some insight that could help make this transition smoother. But from the way people talk about it, Java seems to be an entirely new beast with its own ecosystem. It sounds as though moving to Ruby or Python would actually be easier, which is curious since, when I look at it, Java conceptually seems the closest to PHP, albeit stricter and precompiled. As weird as this may sound, very few people have publicly documented their experience of such moves. I have searched google, amazon and stackoverflow for similar questions and the results leave to desire. I just can't believe that I would need to start the same as a newbie if I wanted to be productive as a web developer in Java fast. Anybody is welcome to respond, but I somewhat think that people with some valuable experience in both languages would enrich this discussion the most. What helped you get going quickly in Java? What concepts are omnipresent in Java and absent from PHP and vice versa? Some gotchas for PHP developers going Java. How long before you felt the transition was complete?

Changes in module A suddenly break module B. There are always these parts of code that no one can understand except for the person who wrote it. Changing infrastructure is impossible and backwards compatibility issues prevent good features to get in. Half of the time you just want to rewrite everything from scratch.

@TITLE:Monads with Join() instead of Bind()
@CONTENT:Monads are usually explained in turns of return and bind. However, I gather you can also implement bind in terms of join (and fmap?) In programming languages lacking first-class functions, bind is excruciatingly awkward to use. join, on the other hand, looks quite easy. I'm not completely sure I understand how join works, however. Obviously, it has the [Haskell] type 
join :: Monad m => m (m x) -> m x
 For the list monad, this is trivially and obviously concat. But for a general monad, what, operationally, does this method actually do? I see what it does to the type signatures, but I'm trying to figure out how I'd write something like this in, say, Java or similar. (Actually, that's easy: I wouldn't. Because generics is broken. ;-) But in principle the question still stands...) Oops. It looks like this has been asked before: Monad join function Could somebody sketch out some implementations of common monads using return, fmap and join? (I.e., not mentioning >>= at all.)

@CONTENT:NOTE: I have now created a jQuery plugin which is my attempt of a solution to this issue. I am sure that it could be improved and i've probably overlooked lots of use cases, so if anyone wants to give feedback feel free :-) https://github.com/WickyNilliams/ReadyBinder I don't have a problem as such, but thought this would be an interesting point for discussion, and i hope people have some interesting ideas for this. Basically, i work on a large-scale website and increasingly we are writing more and more JavaScript. This is fine, i enjoy JS' unique approach and i find the quirkiness in some of the darker annals of the language to be endearing ;-) However one thing that has always bugged me is how to manage document ready events as they get increasingly large over time (and as a result less focused/specific to the page being served) The problem is that we have one JS file (merged & minified, though that's kind of inconsequential for my questions). Most of the JS is written using the revealing module pattern, and jQuery is our framework of choice. So all our JS funcitonality is logically grouped into methods, namespaced, and then right at bottom of the script file we have this $(function(){
    //lots of code here, usually calling encapsulated methods 
    //on our namespaced revealing module
});
 The problem is that not all of the code in this document ready handler pertains to every page. For instance, on one page only 10% of it might be relevant, on another perhaps 80% might be relevant. To me, this feels incredibly wrong, i feel i should only execute the code i need per page, mainly for efficiency, but also maintainability. I've searched google for approaches to this issue, but cannot find anything, maybe i'm just searching for the wrong thing! Anyway, so my questions are: Has anybody ever thought about this issue? Is it actually an issue in other people's opinion? Do you have a large, all-encompassing document ready handler in your code or is it more focused for the type of page being served? If the latter, how do you manage this? Multiple handlers which get switched in JS or dynamically spitting out the document ready handler server-side? Look forward to people's thoughts on the matter. Cheers

@CONTENT:I'm looking for a Java Profiler for use in a very high demand production environment, either commercial or free, that meets all of the following requirements: Lightweight integration with code (no recompile with special options, no code hooks, etc). Dropping some profiler specific .jars alongside the application code is ok. Should be able to connect/disconnect to the JVM without restarting the application. When profiling is not active, no impact to performance When profiling is active, negligible impact to performance. Very slight degradation is acceptable. Must do all the 'expected' stuff a profiler does - time spent in each method to find hotspots, object allocation/memory profiling, etc. Essentially I need something that can sit dormant in production when everything is fine without anyone knowing or caring that it is there, but then be able to connect to it hassle (and performance degradation) free to pinpoint the hard to find problems like hotspots and synchronization issues.

@TITLE:Git vs Mercurial vs SVN [duplicate]
@CONTENT:Possible Duplicates: For home projects, can Mercurial or Git (or other DVCS) provide more advantages over Subversion? What are the relative strengths and weaknesses of Git, Mercurial, and Bazaar? What are some of the differences between these source control system? Which one is the best for a small 2 people project?

@LINK:/questions/3172542/are-erlang-otp-messages-reliable-can-messages-be-duplicated
@TITLE:Are Erlang/OTP messages reliable? Can messages be duplicated?
@CONTENT:Long version: I'm new to erlang, and considering using it for a scalable architecture. I've found many proponents of the platform touting its reliability and fault tolerance. However, I'm struggling to understand exactly how fault-tolerance is achieved in this system where messages are queued in transient memory. I understand that a supervisor hierarchy can be arranged to respawn deceased processes, but I've been unable to find much discussion of the implications of respawning on works-in-progress. What happens to in-flight messages and the artifacts of partially-completed work that were lost on a dying node? Will all producers automatically retransmit messages that are not ack'd when consumer processes die? If not, how can this be considered fault-tolerant? And if so, what prevents a message that was processed -- but not quite acknowledged -- from being retransmitted, and hence reprocessed inappropriately? (I recognize that these concerns are not unique to erlang; similar concerns will arise in any distributed processing system. But erlang enthusiasts seem to claim that the platform makes this all "easy"..?) Assuming messages are retransmitted, I can easily envision a scenario where the downstream effects of a complex messaging chain could become very muddled after a fault. Without some sort of heavy distributed transaction system, I don't understand how consistency and correctness can be maintained without addressing duplication in every process. Must my application code always enforce constraints to prevent transactions from being executed more than once? Short version: Are distributed erlang processes subject to duplicated messages? If so, is duplicate-protection (ie, idempotency) an application responsibility, or does erlang/OTP somehow help us with this?
