@TITLE:Unable to start debugging on the web server. Could not start ASP.NET debugging VS 2010, II7, Win 7 x64
@CONTENT:I am running Visual Studio 2010 (as Admin), IIS 7 on Windows 7 x64. I am able to run the ASP.NET web site in IIS 7 without debugging just fine, but when I press F5 to debug it, I get: Unable to start debugging on the web server. Could not start ASP.NET debugging. More information may be available by starting the project without debugging. Unfortunately the help link is not helping me much and leads down a heck of a large tree of things. I checked the following: Security requirements ¡X I don't recall having to do anything special before. The worker process in IIS7 is w3wp.exe. It says that if it's running as ASPNET or NETWORK SERVICE I must have Administrator privileges to debug it. How do I find out if I need to change something here? Web site Property Pages > Start Options > Debuggers > ASP.NET is checked. Use custom server is set to the URL of the site (which works fine without debugging). Debugging is enabled in web.config. Application is using ASP.NET 3.5 (I want to move to 4.0 eventually but I have some migration to deal with). Application pool: Classing .NET AppPool (also tried DefaultAppPool). Any ideas where I can check next? Surely it shouldn't be that hard to install IIS, VS, create a web site, and start testing it? Thanks in advance.

@LINK:/questions/10867506/dragleave-of-parent-element-fires-when-dragging-over-children-elements
@TITLE:'dragleave' of parent element fires when dragging over children elements
@CONTENT:Overview I have the following HTML structure and I've attached the dragenter and dragleave events to the <div id="dropzone"> element. <div id="dropzone">
    <div id="dropzone-content">
        <div id="drag-n-drop">
            <div class="text">this is some text</div>
            <div class="text">this is a container with text and images</div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
 Problem When I drag a file over the <div id="dropzone">, the dragenter event is fired as expected. However, when I move my mouse over a child element, such as <div id="drag-n-drop">, the dragenter event is fired for the <div id="drag-n-drop"> element and then the dragleave event is fired for the <div id="dropzone"> element. If I hover over the <div id="dropzone"> element again, the dragenter event is again fired, which is cool, but then the dragleave event is fired for the child element just left, so the removeClass instruction is executed, which is not cool. This behavior is problematic for 2 reasons: I'm only attaching dragenter & dragleave to the <div id="dropzone"> so I don't understand why the children elements have these events attached as well. I'm still dragging over the <div id="dropzone"> element while hovering over its children so I don't want dragleave to fire! jsFiddle Here's a jsFiddle to tinker with: http://jsfiddle.net/yYF3S/2/ Question So... how can I make it such that when I'm dragging a file over the <div id="dropzone"> element, dragleave doesn't fire even if I'm dragging over any children elements... it should only fire when I leave the <div id="dropzone"> element... hovering/dragging around anywhere within the boundaries of the element should not trigger the dragleave event. I need this to be cross-browser compatible, at least in the browsers that support HTML5 drag-n-drop, so this answer is not adequate. It seems like Google and Dropbox have figured this out, but their source code is minified/complex so I haven't been able to figure this out from their implementation.
@CODE:dragenter dragleave <div id="dropzone"> <div id="dropzone">
    <div id="dropzone-content">

After all, its name already says what it is intended to do. However, a colleague of mine recently told me had been taught to use compareTo() == 0 instead of equals(). This feels unnatural (as compareTo() is meant to provide an ordering and not compare for equality) and even somewhat dangerous (because compareTo() == 0 does not necessarily imply equality in all cases, even though I know it does for Strings) to me. He did not know why he was taught to use compareTo() instead of equals() for strings, and I could also not find any reason why. Is this really a matter of personal taste, or is there any real reason for either method?

My first call was to use bcp but unfortunately it doesn't produce valid CSV - strings aren't encapsulated, so you can't deal with any row that has a string with a comma in it (or whatever you use as a delimiter) and I would still have to hand write all of the create table statements, as obviously CSV doesn't tell you anything about the data types. What would be better is if there was some tool that could connect to both SQL Server and MySQL, then do a copy. You lose views, stored procedures, trigger, etc, but it isn't hard to copy a table that only uses base types from one DB to another... is it? Does anybody know of such a tool? I don't mind how many assumptions it makes or what simplifications occur, as long as it supports integer, float, datetime and string. I have to do a lot of pruning, normalising, etc. anyway so I don't care about keeping keys, relationships or anything like that, but I need the initial set of data in fast!

@CONTENT:You can use a device modifier (i.e., ~ipad) to provide a device-specific key in Info.plist, and to specify a device-specific launch image (Default.png for iPhone, and Default~ipad.png for iPad, for example). Those two things are specifically mentioned in Apple Docs, but they don't say that this will work for any other kinds of files. I've discovered (quite by accident) that this works for loading .xib files via initWithNibName:bundle:. So for example, I can have MyView.xib and MyView~ipad.xib, and this code: MyViewController *viewController = [[MyViewController alloc] 
                                     initWithNibName:@"MyView" bundle:nil];
 ... will totally load MyView~ipad.xib on an iPad, and MyView.xib on other devices. So, 1) Is this documented somewhere? I sure couldn't find it any any Apple docs. It's sure handier than checking UI_USER_INTERFACE_IDIOM() and hardcoding two different nib names everywhere, but I kinda don't trust it if it isn't documented. And, 2) Does anyone know what version of iOS this started working in? I've only tried it in 4.2, and it works there. Device modifiers in general (even for the documented things listed above) are 4.0 minimum.

@TITLE:Can dplyr summarise over several variables without listing each one?
@CONTENT:dplyr is amazingly fast, but I wonder if I'm missing something: is it possible summarise over several variables. For example: library(dplyr)
library(reshape2)

(df=dput(structure(list(sex = structure(c(1L, 1L, 2L, 2L), .Label = c("boy", 
"girl"), class = "factor"), age = c(52L, 58L, 40L, 62L), bmi = c(25L, 
23L, 30L, 26L), chol = c(187L, 220L, 190L, 204L)), .Names = c("sex", 
"age", "bmi", "chol"), row.names = c(NA, -4L), class = "data.frame")))

   sex age bmi chol
1  boy  52  25  187
2  boy  58  23  220
3 girl  40  30  190
4 girl  62  26  204

dg=group_by(df,sex)
 With this small dataframe, it's easy to write summarise(dg,mean(age),mean(bmi),mean(chol))
 And I know that to get what I want, I could melt, get the means, and then dcast such as dm=melt(df, id.var='sex')
dmg=group_by(dm, sex, variable); 
x=summarise(dmg, means=mean(value))
dcast(x, sex~variable)
 But what if I have >20 variables and a very large number of rows. Is there anything similar to .SD in data.table that would allow me to take the means of all variables in the grouped data frame? Or, is it possible to somehow use lapply on the grouped data frame? Thanks for any help
@CODE:library(dplyr)
library(reshape2)

(df=dput(structure(list(sex = structure(c(1L, 1L, 2L, 2L), .Label = c("boy",

@TITLE:How to prevent Javascript injection attacks within user-generated HTML
@CONTENT:I am saving user-submitted HTML (in a database). I must prevent Javascript injection attacks. The most pernicious I have seen is the script in a style="expression(...)". In addition to this, a fair amount of valid user content will include special characters and XML constructs, so I'd like to avoid a white-list approach if possible. (Listing every allowable HTML element and attribute). Examples of Javascript attack strings are: 1) "Hello, I have a <script>alert("bad!")</script> problem with the <dog> element..." 2) "Hi, this <b style="width:expression(alert('bad!'))">dog</b> is black." Is there a way to prevent such Javascript, and leave the rest intact? The only solution I have so far is to use a regular expression to remove certain patterns. It solves case 1, but not case 2. Edit: Sorry, forgot to mention environment - it's essentially the MS stack: SQL Server 2005 C# 3.5 (ASP.NET) Javascript (obviously) and jQuery. I would like the chokepoint to be the ASP.NET layer - anyone can craft a bad HTTP request. Edit 2: Thanks for the links everyone. Assuming that I can define my list (he content will include many mathematical and programming constructs, so a whitelist is going to be very annoying) I still have a question here: What kind of parser will allow me to just remove the "bad" parts? The bad part could be an entire element, but then what about these scripts that reside in the attributes. I can't remove < a hrefs > willy-nilly.

@LINK:/questions/3514548/creating-viewholders-for-listviews-with-different-item-layouts
@TITLE:Creating ViewHolders for ListViews with different item layouts
@CONTENT:I have a ListView with different layouts for different items. Some items are separators. Some items are different because they hold different kinds of data, etc. I want to implement ViewHolders to speed up the getView process, but I'm not quite sure how to go about it. Different layouts have different pieces of data (which makes naming difficult) and different numbers of Views I want to use. How should I go about doing this? The best idea I can come up with is to create a generic ViewHolder with X items where X is the number of Views in an item layout with the highest number of them. For the other views with a small number of Views, I'll just use a subsection of those variables in the ViewHolder. So say I have 2 layouts I use for 2 different items. One has 3 TextViews and the other has 1. I would create a ViewHolder with 3 TextView variables and only use 1 of them for my other item. My problem is that this can get really ugly looking and feels really hacky; especially when an item layout may have many Views of many different types. Here is a very basic getView: @Override
public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent) {

    MyHolder holder;

    View v = convertView;
    if (v == null) {
        LayoutInflater vi = (LayoutInflater)getContext().getSystemService(Context.LAYOUT_INFLATER_SERVICE);
        v = vi.inflate(R.layout.layout_mylistlist_item, parent, false);

        holder = new MyHolder();
        holder.text = (TextView) v.findViewById(R.id.mylist_itemname);
        v.setTag(holder);
    }
    else {
        holder = (MyHolder)v.getTag();
    }

    MyListItem myItem = m_items.get(position);

    // set up the list item
    if (myItem != null) {
        // set item text
        if (holder.text != null) {
            holder.text.setText(myItem.getItemName());
        }
    }

    // return the created view
    return v;
}
 Suppose I had different types of row layouts, I could have a ViewHolder for each type of row. But what type would I declare "holder" to be at the top? Or would I declare a holder for each type and then use the one for the type of row I'm on.
@CODE:@Override
public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent) {

    MyHolder holder;

    View v = convertView;
    if (v == null) {
        LayoutInflater vi = (LayoutInflater)getContext().getSystemService(Context.LAYOUT_INFLATER_SERVICE);
        v = vi.inflate(R.layout.layout_mylistlist_item, parent, false);

        holder = new MyHolder();
        holder.text = (TextView) v.findViewById(R.id.mylist_itemname);
        v.setTag(holder);
    }
    else {
        holder = (MyHolder)v.getTag();
    }

    MyListItem myItem = m_items.get(position);

    // set up the list item
    if (myItem != null) {
        // set item text
        if (holder.text != null) {
            holder.text.setText(myItem.getItemName());

@CONTENT:Seems to be a lot of confusing, sometimes conflicting, information with regards to making a .net HTTPListener https capable. My understanding is as follows: One's c# code needs an https prefix (ex. https://*:8443) in order for the listener to understand that it needs to service SSL requests at this port. The actual SSL handshake happens under the covers and is handled by http.sys (buried somewhere on the Windows machine); The C# code doesn't have to explicitly manage the ssl handshake, because it happens under the covers. One needs to have a "x509 trusted certificate" on the httpListener machine, and somehow that certificate needs to be bound to port 8443 (in this example) Is my understanding above correct? If not, please educate me. Regarding x509 certificates, my understanding is: Use makecert to create a x509 certificate. This certificate gets stored in the personal store and needs to get moved over to the Trusted Store (this is where the http listener will look). Seems I can use certMgr to perform the move, or I can use mmc to effect the move. Seems there is more than 1 x509 cert format (DER,Base64,pks,pswd protected pks private etc).. Is there a preferred format I should use? Once I get the cert into the trusted store, I need to bind it to the tcp port. I am on Win7: should I be using httpcfg or netsh? Any tips/advice would be appreciated.

@TITLE:JUnit confusion: use 'extend Testcase' or '@Test'?
@CONTENT:I've found the proper use (or at least the documentation) of JUnit very confusing. This question serves both as a future reference and as a real question. If I've understood correctly, there are two main approaches to create and run a JUnit test: Approach A (JUnit 3-style): create a class that extends TestCase, and start test methods with the word test. When running the class as a JUnit Test (in Eclipse), all methods starting with the word test are automatically run. import junit.framework.TestCase;
public class DummyTestA extends TestCase {

    public void testSum() {
        int a = 5;
        int b = 10;
        int result = a + b;
        assertEquals(15, result);
    }
}
 Approach B (JUnit 4-style): create a 'normal' class and prepend a @Test annotation to the method. Note that you do NOT have to start the method with the word test. import org.junit.*;
import static org.junit.Assert.*;

public class DummyTestB {

    @Test
    public void Sum() {
        int a = 5;
        int b = 10;
        int result = a + b;
        assertEquals(15, result);
    }
}
 Mixing the two seems not to be a good idea, see e.g. this stackoverflow question: Now, my questions(s): What is the preferred approach, or when would you use one instead of the other? Approach B allows for testing for exceptions by extending the @Test annotation like in @Test(expected = ArithmeticException.class). But how do you test for exceptions when using approach A? When using approach A, you can group a number of test classes in a test suite like this: TestSuite suite = new TestSuite("All tests"); suite.addTestSuite(DummyTestA.class); suite.addTestSuite(DummyTestAbis.class); But this can't be used with approach B (since each testclass should subclass TestCase). What is the proper way to group tests for approach B? Edit: I've added the JUnit versions to both approaches
@CODE:test test import junit.framework.TestCase;
public class DummyTestA extends TestCase {

    public void testSum() {
        int a = 5;
        int b = 10;
        int result = a + b;
        assertEquals(15, result);
    }
} @Test test import org.junit.*;
import static org.junit.Assert.*;

public class DummyTestB {

    @Test
    public void Sum() {
        int a = 5;
        int b = 10;
        int result = a + b;
        assertEquals(15, result);
    }
} @Test(expected = ArithmeticException.class) TestSuite suite = new TestSuite("All tests"); suite.addTestSuite(DummyTestA.class); suite.addTestSuite(DummyTestAbis.class);

@TITLE:How to autosize and right-align GridViewColumn data in WPF?
@CONTENT:How can I: right-align the text in the ID column make each of the columns auto size according to the text length of the cell with the longest visible data? Here is the code: <ListView Name="lstCustomers" ItemsSource="{Binding Path=Collection}">
    <ListView.View>
        <GridView>
            <GridViewColumn Header="ID" DisplayMemberBinding="{Binding Id}" Width="40"/>
            <GridViewColumn Header="First Name" DisplayMemberBinding="{Binding FirstName}" Width="100" />
            <GridViewColumn Header="Last Name" DisplayMemberBinding="{Binding LastName}"/>
        </GridView>
    </ListView.View>
</ListView>
 partial answer: Thanks Kjetil, the GridViewColumn.CellTemplate works well and the Auto Width works of course but when the ObservativeCollection "Collection" is updated with longer-than-column-width data, the column sizes do not update themselves so that is only a solution for the initial display of data: <ListView Name="lstCustomers" ItemsSource="{Binding Path=Collection}">
    <ListView.View>

@TITLE:How do I escape a string inside JavaScript code inside an onClick handler?
@CONTENT:Maybe I'm just thinking about this too hard, but I'm having a problem figuring out what escaping to use on a string in some JavaScript code inside a link's onClick handler. Example: <a href="#" onclick="SelectSurveyItem('<%itemid%>', '<%itemname%>'); return false;">Select</a>
 The <%itemid%> and <%itemname%> are where template substitution occurs. My problem is that the item name can contain any character, including single and double quotes. Currently, if it contains single quotes it breaks the JavaScript code. My first thought was to use the template language's function to JavaScript-escape the item name, which just escapes the quotes. That will not fix the case of the string containing double quotes which breaks the HTML of the link. How is this problem normally addressed? Do I need to HTML-escape the entire onClick handler? If so, that would look really strange since the template language's escape function for that would also HTMLify the parentheses, quotes, and semicolons... This link is being generated for every result in a search results page, so creating a separate method inside a JavaScript tag is not possible, because I'd need to generate one per result. Also, I'm using a templating engine that was home-grown at the company I work for, so toolkit-specific solutions will be of no use to me.

@TITLE:Can I serve JSPs from inside a JAR in lib, or is there a workaround?
@CONTENT:I have a web application deployed as a WAR file in Tomcat 7. The application is build as a multi-module project: core - packaged as JAR, contains most of the backend code core-api - packaged as JAR, contains interfaces toward core webapp - packaged as WAR, contains frontend code and depends on core customer-extensions - optional module, packaged as JAR Normally, we can put our JSP files in the webapp project, and reference them relative to the context: /WEB-INF/jsp/someMagicalPage.jsp
 The question is what we do about JSP files that are specific to the customer-extensions project, that should not always be included in the WAR. Unfortunately, I cannot refer to JSPs inside JAR files, it appears. Attempting classpath:jsp/customerMagicalPage.jsp results in a file not found in the JspServlet, since it uses ServletContext.getResource(). Traditionally, we "solved" this having maven unpack the customer-extensions JAR, locate the JSPs, and put them in the WAR when building it. But an ideal situation is where you just drop a JAR in the exploded WAR in Tomcat and the extension is discovered - which works for everything but the JSPs. Is there anyway to solve this? A standard way, a Tomcat-specific way, a hack, or a workaround? For example, I've been thinking of unpacking the JSPs on application startup...

@TITLE:Android: Adding static header to the top of a ListActivity
@CONTENT:Currently I have a class that is extending the ListActivity class. I need to be able to add a few static buttons above the list that are always visible. I've attempted to grab the ListView using getListView() from within the class. Then I used addHeaderView(View) to add a small layout to the top of the screen. Header.xml <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<LinearLayout  xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"

        android:text="Income" 
        android:textSize="15dip"
        android:layout_weight="1" />
</LinearLayout>
 Before I set the adapter I do: ListView lv = getListView();
lv.addHeaderView(findViewById(R.layout.header));
 This results in nothing happening to the ListView except for it being populated from my database. No buttons appear above it. Another approach I tried as adding padding to the top of the ListView. When I did this it successfully moved down, however, if I added any above it, it pushed the ListView over. No matter what I do it seems as though I cannot put a few buttons above the ListView when I used the ListActivity. Thanks in advance. synic, I tried your suggestion previously. I tried it again just for the sake of sanity, and the button did not display.

There doesn't seem to be any direct way to do this using jQuery's built in methods, and after selecting the row with jQuery, I haven't found a way to then move it. Also, in my case, making the rows draggable (which I have done with a plugin previously) isn't an option.

@TITLE:Correct way of declaring pointer variables in C/C++ [closed]
@CONTENT:I noticed some people use the following notation for declaring pointer variables. (a) char* p;
 instead of (b) char *p;
 I use (b). What is the rational behind the notation (a)? Notation (b) makes more sense to me because character pointer is not a type itself. Instead the type is character and the variable may be a pointer to the character. char* c;
 This looks like there is a type char* and the variable c is of that type. But in fact the type is char and *c (the memory location pointed by c) is of that type (char). If you declare multiple variables at once this distinction becomes obvious. char* c, *d;
 This looks weird. Both c and d are same kind of pointers that point to a character. In this since the next one looks more natural. char *c, *d;
 Thanks.

@TITLE:How to make a PHP SOAP call using the SoapClient class
@CONTENT:I'm used to writing PHP code, but do not often use Object-Oriented coding. I now need to interact with SOAP (as a client) and am not able to get the syntax right. I've got a WSDL file which allows me to properly set up a new connection using the SoapClient class. However, I'm unable to actually make the right call and get data returned. I need to send the following (simplified) data: Contact ID Contact Name General Description Amount There are two functions defined in the WSDL document, but I only need one ("FirstFunction" below). Here is the script I run to get information on the available functions and types: $client = new SoapClient("http://example.com/webservices?wsdl");
var_dump($client->__getFunctions()); 
var_dump($client->__getTypes()); 
 And here is the output it generates: array(
  [0] => "FirstFunction Function1(FirstFunction $parameters)",
  [1] => "SecondFunction Function2(SecondFunction $parameters)",
);

array(
  [0] => struct Contact {
    id id;
    name name;
  }
  [1] => string "string description"
  [2] => string "int amount"
}
 Say I want to make a call to the FirstFunction with the data: Contact ID: 100 Contact Name: John General Description: Barrel of Oil Amount: 500 What would be the right syntax? I've been trying all sorts of options but it appears the soap structure is quite flexible so there are very many ways of doing this. Couldn't figure it out from the manual either... UPDATE 1: tried sample from MMK: $client = new SoapClient("http://example.com/webservices?wsdl");

$params = array(
  "id" => 100,
  "name" => "John",
  "description" => "Barrel of Oil",
  "amount" => 500,
);
$response = $client->__soapCall("Function1", array($params));
 But I get this response: Object has no 'Contact' property. As you can see in the output of getTypes(), there is a struct called Contact, so I guess I somehow need to make clear my parameters include the Contact data, but the question is: how? UPDATE 2: I've also tried these structures, same error. $params = array(
  array(
    "id" => 100,
    "name" => "John",
  ),
  "Barrel of Oil",
  500,
);
 As well as: $params = array(
  "Contact" => array(
    "id" => 100,
    "name" => "John",
  ),
  "description" => "Barrel of Oil",
  "amount" => 500,
);
 Error in both cases: Object has no 'Contact' property`
@CODE:$client = new SoapClient("http://example.com/webservices?wsdl");
var_dump($client->__getFunctions()); 
var_dump($client->__getTypes()); array(
  [0] => "FirstFunction Function1(FirstFunction $parameters)",
  [1] => "SecondFunction Function2(SecondFunction $parameters)",
);

array(
  [0] => struct Contact {
    id id;
    name name;
  }
  [1] => string "string description"
  [2] => string "int amount"
} $client = new SoapClient("http://example.com/webservices?wsdl");

@CONTENT:I'd like to make a view in my Android app that flips between multiple views on a swipe/fling. I'd like it to behave more or less like the Android Launcher behaves when flipping between views. In particular, It should flip views on swipe. Generally a swipe will flip between one view and the next. It should not fling across all of the views. If you swipe slowly, you should see the views dragging as you're swiping, eg. the way the Launcher does it. I tried using a ViewFlipper with a GestureOverlayView as per Romain Guy's blog post here, but there's no indicator to the user as they're swiping. This makes discoverability difficult, which is presumably why Launcher does it the way they do. I tried using a Gallery object, but when I swipe from left to right, there's a certain amount of momentum that flings the users through all the views rather than just taking them to the next view. Is there a good way to accomplish what I'm trying to do?

@CONTENT:I'm trying to find a way to implement both a custom QuerySet and a custom Manager without breaking DRY. This is what I have so far: class MyInquiryManager(models.Manager):
    def for_user(self, user):
        return self.get_query_set().filter(
                    Q(assigned_to_user=user) |

    assigned_to_group = models.ForeignKey(Group, blank=True, null=True)
    objects = MyInquiryManager()
 This works fine, until I do something like this: inquiries = Inquiry.objects.filter(status=some_status)
my_inquiry_count = inquiries.for_user(request.user).count()
 This promptly breaks everything because the QuerySet doesn't have the same methods as the Manager. I've tried creating a custom QuerySet class, and implementing it in MyInquiryManager, but I end up replicating all of my method definitions. I also found this snippet which works, but I need to pass in the extra argument to for_user so it breaks down because it relies heavily on redefining get_query_set. Is there a way to do this without redefining all of my methods in both the QuerySet and the Manager subclasses?

@TITLE:How to correctly use Google Plus Sign In with multiple activities?
@CONTENT:tl;dr What would be a good/recommended way of tying up the Google+ api client life cycle with the flow of a multi-activity app? Make the activities depend on the onConnected api client method to trigger its functionality, use it as a one-time only "activation" thing, or maybe something else entirely? I am currently struggling to understand how to correctly use the Google+ sign in in my Android app, which has more than one activity. The idea is, in a first phase, to use the G+ sign in just to authenticate the user and be able to get her email, to send notifications and stuff like that. Eventually I plan to roll out other Google functionality like maybe Maps or other Google Play services, so I think it's useful to implement it already. However, my app is not behaving as expected, and I have narrowed down the issue to the fact that I have not yet understood the G+ sign in app cycle when more than one activity is present. What is the correct or recommended way to implement this auth method? is there maybe a pattern of sorts that could guide me in the right direction? For example, I have found a very simple diagram of the life cycle of the api client, but how does this relate to the app flow? Initially I have a Login Activity, where I put the sign in button. Following Google's guide I am able to sign in, and when the onConnected method is called, I start the Home Activity (kinda like the dashboard or main screen of the app). This works somewhat. For example, what would be a good way of handling the onStart and onStop for each activity? should I re-connect and re-authenticate the api client every time for every activity? So maybe its a good idea to have a BaseActivity to implement all this. Another issue is, should I use the same api client object and pass it around somehow, or maybe store it in the Base Activity class? or should I be creating and initializing a new api client object every time? How about just using the Login Activity to authenticate with G+ and then just get the email and store it in a local database, and flag the user as "authenticated" or "active" or something. That would prevent me from having to re-authenticate every time the app is closed or connection is suspended, even allowing for some battery savings. The app is not really using G+ posting or any other functionality like that. Ideally it should work well offline, and only need connection for stuff like initial authentication or other one-time only things. Any suggestions or pointers in the right direction are very much appreciated. Edit: I have read every guide and tutorial I could find, that uses Google+, and every one of them addresses this from a single activity perspective. I would think this is a common enough problem that it would benefit from a pattern or at least a general guideline.

@TITLE:How do I route images using ASP.Net MVC routing?
@CONTENT:I upgraded my site to use ASP.Net MVC from traditional ASP.Net webforms. I'm using the MVC routing to redirect requests for old .aspx pages to their new Controller/Action equivalent:         routes.MapRoute(
            "OldPage",
            "oldpage.aspx",
            new { controller = "NewController", action = "NewAction", id = "" }
        );
 This is working great for pages because they map directly to a controller and action. However, my problem is requests for images - I'm not sure how to redirect those incoming requests. I need to redirect incoming requests for http://www.domain.com/graphics/image.png to http://www.domain.com/content/images/image.png. What is the correct syntax when using the .MapRoute() method?
@CODE:routes.MapRoute(
            "OldPage",
            "oldpage.aspx",

@TITLE:How to compress an image via Javascript in the browser?
@CONTENT:TL;DR; Is there a way to compress an image (mostly jpeg, png and gif) directly browser-side, before uploading it ? I'm pretty sure JavaScript can do this, but I can't find a way to achieve it. Here's the full scenario I would like to implement: the user goes to my website, and choose an image via an input type="file" element, this image is retrieved via JavaScript, we do some verification such as correct file format, maximum file size etc, if every thing is OK, a preview of the image is displayed on the page, the user can do some basic operations such as rotate the image by 90¢X/-90¢X, crop it following a pre-defined ratio, etc, or the user can upload another image and return to step 1, when the user is satisfied, the edited image is then compressed and "saved" locally (not saved to a file, but in the browser memory/page),- the user fill a form with data like name, age etc, the user click on the "Finish" button, then the form containing datas + compressed image is sent to the server (without AJAX), The full process up to the last step should be done client side, and should be compatible on latest Chrome and Firefox, Safari 5+ and IE 8+. If possible, only JavaScript should be used (but I'm pretty sure this is not possible). I've not code anything right now, but I've thought about it already. File reading locally is possible via File API, image previewing and editing could be done using Canvas element, but I can't find a way to do the image compression part. According to html5please.com and caniuse.com, supporting those browser is quite hard (thanks to IE), but could be done using polyfill such as FlashCanvas and FileReader. Actually, the goal is to reduce file size, so I see image compression as a solution. But, I know that uploaded images are going to be displayed on my website, every time at the same place, and I know the dimension of this display area (eg. 200x400). So, I could resize the image to fit those dimensions, thus reducing file size. I have no idea what would be the compression ratio for this technique. What do you think ? Do you have any advice to tell me ? Do you know any way to compress an image browser-side in JavaScript ? Thanks for your replies.

@TITLE:What is the best way to open a file for exclusive access in Python?
@CONTENT:What is the most elegant way to solve this: open a file for reading, but only if it is not already opened for writing open a file for writing, but only if it is not already opened for reading or writing The built-in functions work like this >>> path = r"c:\scr.txt"
>>> file1 = open(path, "w")
>>> print file1
<open file 'c:\scr.txt', mode 'w' at 0x019F88D8>
>>> file2 = open(path, "w")
>>> print file2
<open file 'c:\scr.txt', mode 'w' at 0x02332188>
>>> file1.write("111")
>>> file2.write("222")
>>> file1.close()
 scr.txt now contains '111'. >>> file2.close()
 scr.txt was overwritten and now contains '222' (on Windows, Python 2.4). The solution should work inside the same process (like in the example above) as well as when another process has opened the file. It is preferred, if a crashing program will not keep the lock open.
@CODE:>>> path = r"c:\scr.txt"
>>> file1 = open(path, "w")
>>> print file1
<open file 'c:\scr.txt', mode 'w' at 0x019F88D8>
>>> file2 = open(path, "w")
>>> print file2
<open file 'c:\scr.txt', mode 'w' at 0x02332188>

@LINK:/questions/6039309/when-does-an-associated-object-get-released
@TITLE:When does an associated object get released?
@CONTENT:I'm attaching object B via associative reference to object A. Object B observes some properties of object A through KVO. The problem is that object B seems to be deallocated after object A, meaning its too late to remove itself as a KVO observer of object A. I know this because I'm getting NSKVODeallocateBreak exceptions, followed by EXEC_BAD_ACCESS crashes in object B's dealloc. Does anyone know why object B is deallocated after object A with OBJC_ASSOCIATION_RETAIN? Do associated objects get released after deallocation? Do they get autoreleased? Does anyone know of a way to alter this behavior? I'm trying to add some things to a class through categories, so I can't override any existing methods (including dealloc), and I don't particularly want to mess with swizzling. I need some way to de-associate and release object B before object A gets deallocated. EDIT - Here is the code I'm trying to get working. If the associated objects were released prior to UIImageView being completely deallocated, this would all work. The only solution I'm seeing is to swizzle in my own dealloc method, and swizzle back the original in order to call up to it. That gets really messy though. The point of the ZSPropertyWatcher class is that KVO requires a standard callback method, and I don't want to replace UIImageView's, in case it uses one itself.

@CONTENT:So I've spent a lot of time reading and re-reading the ending of chapter 9 in The Little Schemer, where the applicative Y combinator is developed for the "length" function. I think my confusion boils down to a single statement that contrasts two versions of length (before the combinator is factored out): A:
  ((lambda (mk-length)
     (mk-length mk-length))
   (lambda (mk-length)
     (lambda (l)
       (cond
         ((null? l) 0 )
         (else (add1

             (else (add1 (length (cdr l)))))))
       (mk-length mk-length))))
 Page 170 (4th ed.) states that A "returns a function when we applied it to an argument" while B "does not return a function," thereby producing an infinite regress of self-applications. I'm stumped by this. If B is plagued by this problem, I don't see how A avoids it.

@TITLE:Android JSON HttpClient to send data to PHP server with HttpResponse
@CONTENT:I am currently trying to send some data from and Android application to a php server (both are controlled by me). There is alot of data collected on a form in the app, this is written to the database. This all works. In my main code, firstly I create a JSONObject (I have cut it down here for this example): JSONObject j = new JSONObject();
j.put("engineer", "me");
j.put("date", "today");
j.put("fuel", "full");
j.put("car", "mine");
j.put("distance", "miles");
 Next I pass the object over for sending, and receive the response: String url = "http://www.server.com/thisfile.php";
HttpResponse re = HTTPPoster.doPost(url, j);
String temp = EntityUtils.toString(re.getEntity());
if (temp.compareTo("SUCCESS")==0)
{
    Toast.makeText(this, "Sending complete!", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
}
 The HTTPPoster class: public static HttpResponse doPost(String url, JSONObject c) throws ClientProtocolException, IOException 
{
    HttpClient httpclient = new DefaultHttpClient();
    HttpPost request = new HttpPost(url);
    HttpEntity entity;
    StringEntity s = new StringEntity(c.toString());
    s.setContentEncoding(new BasicHeader(HTTP.CONTENT_TYPE, "application/json"));
    entity = s;
    request.setEntity(entity);
    HttpResponse response;
    response = httpclient.execute(request);
    return response;
}
 This gets a response, but the server is returning a 403 - Forbidden response. I have tried changing the doPost function a little (this is actually a little better, as I said I have alot to send, basically 3 of the same form with different data - so I create 3 JSONObjects, one for each form entry - the entries come from the DB instead of the static example I am using). Firstly I changed the call over a bit: String url = "http://www.myserver.com/ServiceMatalan.php";
Map<String, String> kvPairs = new HashMap<String, String>();
kvPairs.put("vehicle", j.toString());
// Normally I would pass two more JSONObjects.....
HttpResponse re = HTTPPoster.doPost(url, kvPairs);
String temp = EntityUtils.toString(re.getEntity());
if (temp.compareTo("SUCCESS")==0)
{
    Toast.makeText(this, "Sending complete!", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
}
 Ok so the changes to the doPost function: public static HttpResponse doPost(String url, Map<String, String> kvPairs) throws ClientProtocolException, IOException 
{
    HttpClient httpclient = new DefaultHttpClient();
    HttpPost httppost = new HttpPost(url);
    if (kvPairs != null && kvPairs.isEmpty() == false) 
    {
        List<NameValuePair> nameValuePairs = new ArrayList<NameValuePair>(kvPairs.size());
        String k, v;
        Iterator<String> itKeys = kvPairs.keySet().iterator();
        while (itKeys.hasNext()) 
        {
            k = itKeys.next();
            v = kvPairs.get(k);
            nameValuePairs.add(new BasicNameValuePair(k, v));
        }             
        httppost.setEntity(new UrlEncodedFormEntity(nameValuePairs));
    }
    HttpResponse response;
    response = httpclient.execute(httppost);
    return response;
}
 Ok So this returns a response 200 int statusCode = re.getStatusLine().getStatusCode();
 However the data received on the server cannot be parsed to a JSON string. It is badly formatted I think (this is the first time I have used JSON): If in the php file I do an echo on $_POST['vehicle'] I get the following: {\"date\":\"today\",\"engineer\":\"me\"}
 Can anyone tell me where I am going wrong, or if there is a better way to achieve what I am trying to do? Hopefully the above makes sense!
@CODE:JSONObject j = new JSONObject();
j.put("engineer", "me");
j.put("date", "today");
j.put("fuel", "full");
j.put("car", "mine");
j.put("distance", "miles"); String url = "http://www.server.com/thisfile.php";
HttpResponse re = HTTPPoster.doPost(url, j);
String temp = EntityUtils.toString(re.getEntity());
if (temp.compareTo("SUCCESS")==0)
{
    Toast.makeText(this, "Sending complete!", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
} public static HttpResponse doPost(String url, JSONObject c) throws ClientProtocolException, IOException 
{
    HttpClient httpclient = new DefaultHttpClient();
    HttpPost request = new HttpPost(url);
    HttpEntity entity;
    StringEntity s = new StringEntity(c.toString());
    s.setContentEncoding(new BasicHeader(HTTP.CONTENT_TYPE, "application/json"));
    entity = s;
    request.setEntity(entity);
    HttpResponse response;
    response = httpclient.execute(request);
    return response;
} String url = "http://www.myserver.com/ServiceMatalan.php";
Map<String, String> kvPairs = new HashMap<String, String>();
kvPairs.put("vehicle", j.toString());
// Normally I would pass two more JSONObjects.....

String temp = EntityUtils.toString(re.getEntity());

@CONTENT:I have recently started to read Effective Java by Joshua Bloch. I found the idea of the Builder pattern [Item 2 in the book] really interesting. I tried to implement it in my project but there were compilation errors. Following is in essence what I was trying to do: The class with multiple attributes and its builder class: public class NutritionalFacts {
    private int sodium;
    private int fat;
    private int carbo;

    public class Builder {
        private int sodium;

        public Builder fat(int f) {

            return this;
        }

        public Builder carbo(int c) {
            this.carbo = c;
            return this;
        }

        this.sodium = b.sodium;
        this.fat = b.fat;
        this.carbo = b.carbo;
    }
}

        NutritionalFacts n = 
            new NutritionalFacts.Builder(10).carbo(23).fat(1).build();
    }
}
 I am getting the following compiler error: an enclosing instance that contains effectivejava.BuilderPattern.NutritionalFacts.Builder is required NutritionalFacts n = new NutritionalFacts.Builder(10).carbo(23).fat(1).build(); I do not understand what the message means. Please explain. The above code is similar to the example suggested by Bloch in his book.

@CONTENT:I am using Backbone.js and the Tornado web server. The standard behavior for receiving collection data in Backbone is to send as a JSON Array. On the other hand, Tornado's standard behavior is to not allow JSON Array's due to the following vulnerability: http://haacked.com/archive/2008/11/20/anatomy-of-a-subtle-json-vulnerability.aspx A related one is: http://haacked.com/archive/2009/06/25/json-hijacking.aspx It feels more natural for me to not have to wrap up my JSON in an object when it really is a list of objects. I was unable to reproduce these attacks in modern browsers (i.e. current Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and IE9). At the same time I was unable to confirm anywhere that modern browsers had addressed these issues. To ensure that I am not mislead by any possible poor programming-skills nor poor googling-skills: Are these JSON Hijacking attacks still an issue today in modern browsers? (Note: Sorry for the possible duplicate to: Is it possible to do 'JSON hijacking' on modern browser? but since the accepted answer does not seem to answer the question - I thought it was time to ask it again and get some clearer explanations.)

 and the following view: <script type="text/javascript" src="@Scripts.Url(BundlePaths.CanvasScripts)"></script>
 where BundlePaths.CanvasScripts is "~/bundles/scripts/canvas". It renders this: <script type="text/javascript" src="/bundles/scripts/canvas?v=UTH3XqH0UXWjJzi-gtX03eU183BJNpFNg8anioG14_41"></script>
 So far so good, except ~/Scripts/Shared/achievements.js is the first script in the bundled source. It depends on every script included before it in the ScriptBundle. How can I ensure that it honors the order in which I add include statements to the bundle? Update This was a relatively new ASP.NET MVC 4 application, but it was referencing the optimization framework pre release package. I removed it and added the RTM package from http://nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNet.Web.Optimization. With the RTM version with debug=true in web.config, @Scripts.Render("~/bundles/scripts/canvas") renders the individual script tags in the correct order. With debug=false in web.config, the combined script has the achievements.js script first, but since its a function definition (object constructor) that's called later, it runs without error. Perhaps the minifier is smart enough to figure out dependencies? I also tried the IBundleOrderer implementation that Darin Dimitrov suggested with RTM with both debug options and it behaved the same. So the minified version is not in the order I expect, but it works.
@CODE:public class BundleConfig
{
    public static void RegisterBundles(BundleCollection bundles)
    {
        // shared scripts
        Bundle canvasScripts =
            new ScriptBundle(BundlePaths.CanvasScripts)

Using an account which is not enabled for testing will lead to another error message: E/GameAgent: Unable to retrieve 1P application 547xxxxxx457 from network
E/CheckGameplayAcl: Unable to load metadata for game
 Solution by Hartok! Hartok's solution helped me a lot to fix this issue. I've never visited the Google APIs Console before. It's important to know, that the OAuth Client ID is not deleted when you remove a linked app from your game or even delete a game (in the Dev Console). You have to visit the APIs Console and remove it manually. The auto-selected SHA1 fingerprint is (always) wrong! You have to lookup your own: keytool -exportcert -alias <your-alias> -keystore <path-to-keystore> -list -v
 The new client id of my (correctly) linked app looked like 89xxxxxxxx73-2u6mXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX8903.apps.goo..., not just 12 digits as before. I finally figured out that you have to exclude the dash and alphanumeric stuff and have to use the 12 digits only. Thanks for helping me out!

Settings are pretty useful, but I had to do a whole bunch of digging to figure out what was going on (coming from the Python world, not something I am used too).

@CONTENT:I've never really understood why C++ needs a separate header file with the same functions as in the .cpp file. It makes creating classes and refactoring them very difficult, and it adds unnecessary files to the project. And then there is the problem with having to include header files, but having to explicitly check if it has already been included. C++ was ratified in 1998, so why is it designed this way? What advantages does having a separate header file have? Follow up question: How does the compiler find the .cpp file with the code in it, when all I include is the .h file? Does it assume that the .cpp file has the same name as the .h file, or does it actually look through all the files in the directory tree?

@TITLE:Enter key press behaves like a Tab in Javascript
@CONTENT:I'm looking to create a form where pressing the enter key causes focus to go to the "next" form element on the page. The solution I keep finding on the web is...  <body onkeydown="if(event.keyCode==13){event.keyCode=9; return event.keyCode}">
 Unfortunately, that only seems to work in IE. So the real meat of this question is if anybody knows of a solution that works for FF and Chrome? Additionally, I'd rather not have to add onkeydown events to the form elements themselves, but if that's the only way, it will have to do. This issue is similar to question 905222, but deserving of it's own question in my opinion. Edit: also, I've seen people bring up the issue that this isn't good style, as it diverges from form behavior that users are used to. I agree! It's a client request :(

@TITLE:How do I filter all HTML tags except a certain whitelist?
@CONTENT:This is for .NET. IgnoreCase is set and MultiLine is NOT set. Usually I'm decent at regex, maybe I'm running low on caffeine... Users are allowed to enter HTML-encoded entities (<lt;, <amp;, etc.), and to use the following HTML tags: u, i, b, h3, h4, br, a, img
 Self-closing <br/> and <img/> are allowed, with or without the extra space, but are not required. I want to: Strip all starting and ending HTML tags other than those listed above. Remove attributes from the remaining tags, except anchors can have an href. My search pattern (replaced with an empty string) so far: <(?!i|b|h3|h4|a|img|/i|/b|/h3|/h4|/a|/img)[^>]+>
 This seems to be stripping all but the start and end tags I want, but there are three problems: Having to include the end tag version of each allowed tag is ugly. The attributes survive. Can this happen in a single replacement? Tags starting with the allowed tag names slip through. E.g., "<abbrev>" and "<iframe>". The following suggested pattern does not strip out tags that have no attributes. </?(?!i|b|h3|h4|a|img)\b[^>]*>
 As mentioned below, ">" is legal in an attribute value, but it's safe to say I won't support that. Also, there will be no CDATA blocks, etc. to worry about. Just a little HTML. Loophole's answer is the best one so far, thanks! Here's his pattern (hoping the PRE works better for me): static string SanitizeHtml(string html)
{
    string acceptable = "script|link|title";
    string stringPattern = @"</?(?(?=" + acceptable + @")notag|[a-zA-Z0-9]+)(?:\s[a-zA-Z0-9\-]+=?(?:([""']?).*?\1?)?)*\s*/?>";
    return Regex.Replace(html, stringPattern, "sausage");
}
 Some small tweaks I think could still be made to this answer: I think this could be modified to capture simple HTML comments (those that do not themselves contain tags) by adding "!--" to the "acceptable" variable and making a small change to the end of the expression to allow for an optional trailing "\s--". I think this would break if there are multiple whitespace characters between attributes (example: heavily-formatted HTML with line breaks and tabs between attributes). Edit 2009-07-23: Here's the final solution I went with (in VB.NET):  Dim AcceptableTags As String = "i|b|u|sup|sub|ol|ul|li|br|h2|h3|h4|h5|span|div|p|a|img|blockquote"
 Dim WhiteListPattern As String = "</?(?(?=" & AcceptableTags & _
      ")notag|[a-zA-Z0-9]+)(?:\s[a-zA-Z0-9\-]+=?(?:([""']?).*?\1?)?)*\s*/?>"
 html = Regex.Replace(html, WhiteListPattern, "", RegExOptions.Compiled)
 The caveat is that the HREF attribute of A tags still gets scrubbed, which is not ideal.
@CODE:u, i, b, h3, h4, br, a, img <(?!i|b|h3|h4|a|img|/i|/b|/h3|/h4|/a|/img)[^>]+> </?(?!i|b|h3|h4|a|img)\b[^>]*> static string SanitizeHtml(string html)

    string acceptable = "script|link|title";
    string stringPattern = @"</?(?(?=" + acceptable + @")notag|[a-zA-Z0-9]+)(?:\s[a-zA-Z0-9\-]+=?(?:([""']?).*?\1?)?)*\s*/?>";

@LINK:/questions/1962629/contravariance-explained
@TITLE:Contravariance explained
@CONTENT:First of, I have read many explanations on SO and blogs about covariance and contravariance and a big thanks goes out to Eric Lippert for producing such a great series on Covariance and Contravariance. However I have a more specific question that I am trying to get my head around a little bit. As far as I understand per Eric's explanation is that Covariance and Contravariance are both adjectives that describe a transformation. Covariant transformation is that which preserves the order of types and Contravariant transformation is one that reverses it. I understand covariance in such a manner that I think most developers understand intuitively. //covariant operation
Animal someAnimal = new Giraffe(); 
//assume returns Mammal, also covariant operation
someAnimal = Mammal.GetSomeMammal();
 The return operation here is covariant as we are preserving the size in which both Animal is still bigger than Mammal or Giraffe. On that note most return operations are covariant, contravariant operations would not make sense.   //if return operations were contravariant
  //the following would be illegal
  //as Mammal would need to be stored in something
  //equal to or less derived than Mammal
  //which would mean that Animal is now less than or equal than Mammal
  //therefore reversing the relationship
  Animal someAnimal =  Mammal.GetSomeMammal();
 This piece of code of course would not make sense to most developers. My confusion lies in Contravariant argument parameters. If you had a method such as bool Compare(Mammal mammal1, Mammal mammal2);
 I have always learned that input parameters always force contravariant behavior. Such that if the type is used as an input parameter its behavior should be contravariant. However what is the difference between the following code Mammal mammal1 = new Giraffe(); //covariant
Mammal mammal2 = new Dolphin(); //covariant

Compare(mammal1, mammal2); //covariant or contravariant?
//or
Compare(new Giraffe(), new Dolphin()); //covariant or contravariant?
 By the same token that you can't do something like this you can't do    //not valid
   Mammal mammal1 = new Animal();

   //not valid
   Compare(new Animal(), new Dolphin());
 I guess what I am asking is, what makes method argument passing a contravariant transformation. Sorry for the long post, maybe I am understand this incorrectly. EDIT: Per some conversation below, I understand that for instance using a delegate layer can clearly show contravariance. Consider the following example //legal, covariance
Mammal someMammal = new Mammal();
Animal someAnimal = someMammal;

// legal in C# 4.0, covariance (because defined in Interface)
IEnumerable<Mammal> mammalList = Enumerable.Empty<Mammal>();
IEnumerable<Animal> animalList = mammalList;

//because of this, one would assume
//that the following line is legal as well

void ProcessMammal(Mammal someMammal);

Action<Mammal> processMethod = ProcessMammal;
Action<Animal> someAction = processMethod;
 Of course this is illegal because someone can pass any Animal to someAction, where as the ProcessMammal expects anything thats Mammal or more specific ( lesser than Mammal ). Which is why someAction has to only be Action or anything more specific (Action) However this is introducing a layer of delegates in the middle, is it necessary that for a contravariant projection to happen there has to be a delegate in the middle? And if we were to define Process as an interface we would declare the argument parameter as a contravariant type only because we wouldn't want someone to be able to do what I had shown above with delegates? public interface IProcess<out T>
{
    void Process(T val);
}
@CODE://covariant operation
Animal someAnimal = new Giraffe(); 
//assume returns Mammal, also covariant operation
someAnimal = Mammal.GetSomeMammal(); //if return operations were contravariant
  //the following would be illegal
  //as Mammal would need to be stored in something
  //equal to or less derived than Mammal
  //which would mean that Animal is now less than or equal than Mammal
  //therefore reversing the relationship
  Animal someAnimal =  Mammal.GetSomeMammal(); bool Compare(Mammal mammal1, Mammal mammal2); Mammal mammal1 = new Giraffe(); //covariant
Mammal mammal2 = new Dolphin(); //covariant

Compare(mammal1, mammal2); //covariant or contravariant?
//or
Compare(new Giraffe(), new Dolphin()); //covariant or contravariant? //not valid
   Mammal mammal1 = new Animal();

   //not valid
   Compare(new Animal(), new Dolphin()); //legal, covariance
Mammal someMammal = new Mammal();
Animal someAnimal = someMammal;

// legal in C# 4.0, covariance (because defined in Interface)
IEnumerable<Mammal> mammalList = Enumerable.Empty<Mammal>();
IEnumerable<Animal> animalList = mammalList;

//because of this, one would assume
//that the following line is legal as well

@TITLE:How to start a process from windows service into currently logged in user's session
@CONTENT:I need to start a program from Windows Service. That program is a user UI application. Moreover that application should be started under specific user account. The problem is that a Window Services run in session #0, but a logged in user sessions are 1,2 etc. So the question is: how to start a process from a window service in such a way that it run in currently logged in user's session? I'd emphasis on that the question is not about how to start a process under specific account (it's obvious - Process.Start(new ProcessStartInfo("..") { UserName=..,Password=..})). Even if I install my windows to run under current user account the service will run in session #0 anyway. Setting "Allow service to interact with desktop" doesn't help. My windows service is .net-based. UPDATE: first of all, .NET has nothing to do here, it's actually pure Win32 thing. Here's what I'm doing. The following code is in my windows service (C# using win32 function via P/Inkove, I skipped import signatures, they're all here - http://www.pinvoke.net/default.aspx/advapi32/CreateProcessWithLogonW.html):     var startupInfo = new StartupInfo()
        {
            lpDesktop = "WinSta0\\Default",
            cb = Marshal.SizeOf(typeof(StartupInfo)),
        };
    var processInfo = new ProcessInformation();
    string command = @"c:\windows\Notepad.exe";
    string user = "Administrator";
    string password = "password";
    string currentDirectory = System.IO.Directory.GetCurrentDirectory();
    try
    {
        bool bRes = CreateProcessWithLogonW(user, null, password, 0,
            command, command, 0,
            Convert.ToUInt32(0),
            currentDirectory, ref startupInfo, out processInfo);
        if (!bRes)

    GetExitCodeProcess(processInfo.hProcess, ref exitCode);
    writeToEventLog("Notepad has been started by WatchdogService. Exitcode: " + exitCode);

    CloseHandle(processInfo.hProcess);
    CloseHandle(processInfo.hThread);
 The code goes to the line "Notepad has been started by WatchdogService. Exitcode: " + exitCode. Exitcode is 3221225794. And there's no any new notepad started. Where am I wrong?

@TITLE:Responding to the onmousemove event outside of the browser window in IE
@CONTENT:In Internet Explorer 7 body onmousemove or document.onmousemove events only seem to fire while the mouse is inside the browser window, not when it's outside. Yet in Firefox the onmousemove event is called correctly when I move outside of the browser window. How can I setup an event to be called outside of the browser window in IE? Google Maps does this in IE. If you hold the mouse button down and move the mouse outside of the browser window you can see that the map still moves.

@CONTENT:According to Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X, 3rd Edition, on page 202 (chapter 13): You will be registering, reading, and setting defaults in several classes in your application. To make sure that you always use the same name, you should declare those strings in a single file and then simply #import that file into any file in which you use the names. There are several ways to do this. For example, you could use the C preprocessor¡¦s #define command, but most Cocoa programmers use global variables for this purpose. Is this really the correct best practice? Global variables? That seems insane to me ¡V counter to everything I¡¦ve ever been taught. Would a better design be a simple Singleton class with these defined? Or is it really the correct best practice to go global? Is there a better pattern than either, given that many people consider Singletons to be globals in a pretty dress?

@LINK:/questions/4449565/getting-displacement-from-accelerometer-data-with-core-motion
@TITLE:Getting displacement from accelerometer data with Core Motion
@CONTENT:I am developing an augmented reality application that (at the moment) wants to display a simple cube on top of a surface, and be able to move in space (both rotating and displacing) to look at the cube in all the different angles. The problem of calibrating the camera doesn't apply here since I ask the user to place the iPhone on the surface he wants to place the cube on and then press a button to reset the attitude. To find out the camera rotation is very simple with the Gyroscope and Core Motion. I do it this way: if (referenceAttitude != nil) {
    [attitude multiplyByInverseOfAttitude:referenceAttitude];
}

CMRotationMatrix mat = attitude.rotationMatrix;

GLfloat rotMat[] = {
    mat.m11, mat.m21, mat.m31, 0,
    mat.m12, mat.m22, mat.m32, 0,
    mat.m13, mat.m23, mat.m33, 0,
    0, 0, 0, 1
};

glMultMatrixf(rotMat);
 This works really well. More problems arise anyway when I try to find the displacement in space during an acceleration. The Apple Teapot example with Core Motion just adds the x, y and z values of the acceleration vector to the position vector. This (apart from having not much sense) has the result of returning the object to the original position after an acceleration. (Since the acceleration goes from positive to negative or vice versa). They did it like this: translation.x += userAcceleration.x;
translation.y += userAcceleration.y;
translation.z += userAcceleration.z;
 What should I do to find out displacement from the acceleration in some istant? (with known time difference). Looking some other answers, it seems like I have to integrate twice to get velocity from acceleration and then position from velocity. But there is no example in code whatsoever, and I don't think that is really necessary. Also, there is the problem that when the iPhone is still on a plane, accelerometer values are not null (there is some noise I think). How much should I filter those values? Am I supposed to filter them at all?
@CODE:if (referenceAttitude != nil) {
    [attitude multiplyByInverseOfAttitude:referenceAttitude];
}

CMRotationMatrix mat = attitude.rotationMatrix;

GLfloat rotMat[] = {
    mat.m11, mat.m21, mat.m31, 0,
    mat.m12, mat.m22, mat.m32, 0,
    mat.m13, mat.m23, mat.m33, 0,
    0, 0, 0, 1
};

glMultMatrixf(rotMat); translation.x += userAcceleration.x;
translation.y += userAcceleration.y;
translation.z += userAcceleration.z;

The problem is when I then retrieve the image later on it is in landscape orientation (the picture has been rotated 90 degrees anti-clockwise) I don' want to force the user to use the camera in a certain orientation.

@TITLE:How do I release a CGImageRef in iOS
@CONTENT:I am writing this method to calculate the average R,G,B values of an image. The following method takes a UIImage as an input and returns an array containing the R,G,B values of the input image. I have one question though: How/Where do I properly release the CGImageRef? -(NSArray *)getAverageRGBValuesFromImage:(UIImage *)image
{
    CGImageRef rawImageRef = [image CGImage];

    //This function returns the raw pixel values
    const UInt8 *rawPixelData = CFDataGetBytePtr(CGDataProviderCopyData(CGImageGetDataProvider(rawImageRef)));

    NSUInteger imageHeight = CGImageGetHeight(rawImageRef);
    NSUInteger imageWidth = CGImageGetWidth(rawImageRef);

    //Here I sort the R,G,B, values and get the average over the whole image
    int i = 0;
    unsigned int red = 0;
    unsigned int green = 0;
    unsigned int blue = 0;

    for (int column = 0; column< imageWidth; column++)
    {
        int r_temp = 0;
        int g_temp = 0;
        int b_temp = 0;

        for (int row = 0; row < imageHeight; row++) {
            i = (row * imageWidth + column)*4;
            r_temp += (unsigned int)rawPixelData[i];
            g_temp += (unsigned int)rawPixelData[i+1];
            b_temp += (unsigned int)rawPixelData[i+2];

        }

        red += r_temp;
        green += g_temp;
        blue += b_temp;

    }

    NSNumber *averageRed = [NSNumber numberWithFloat:(1.0*red)/(imageHeight*imageWidth)];
    NSNumber *averageGreen = [NSNumber numberWithFloat:(1.0*green)/(imageHeight*imageWidth)];
    NSNumber *averageBlue = [NSNumber numberWithFloat:(1.0*blue)/(imageHeight*imageWidth)];


    //Then I store the result in an array
    NSArray *result = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:averageRed,averageGreen,averageBlue, nil];


    return result;
}
 I tried two things: Option 1: I leave it as it is, but then after a few cycles (5+) the program crashes and I get the "low memory warning error" Option 2: I add one line CGImageRelease(rawImageRef) before the method returns. Now it crashes after the second cycle, I get the EXC_BAD_ACCESS error for the UIImage that I pass to the method. When I try to analyze (instead of RUN) in Xcode I get the following warning at this line "Incorrect decrement of the reference count of an object that is not owned at this point by the caller" Where and how should I release the CGImageRef? Thanks!

 ...and ultimately to ch.qos.logback | logback-classic | 0.9.22
ch.qos.logback | logback-core | 0.9.22
 so my app can log through logback via its slf4j API while the old library code can log into the same location via the redirection. Alas, this results in java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.slf4j.spi.LocationAwareLogger.log(Lorg/slf4j/Marker;Ljava/lang/String;ILjava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/Throwable;)V

+------+------+-------+------+------+
 The problem lies with the fact that when a field is empty in the raw data and is not defined, MySQL for some reason does not use the columns default value (which is NULL) and uses zero. NULL is used correctly when the field is missing alltogether. Unfortunately, I have to be able to distinguish between NULL and 0 at this stage so any help would be appreciated.

@TITLE:What's the -practical- difference between a Bare and non-Bare repository?
@CONTENT:I've been reading about the bare and non-bare / default repositores in Git. I haven't been able to understand quite well (theoretically) about the differences between them, and why I should "push" to a bare repository. Here's the deal: Currently, I'm the only one working on a project on 3 different computers, but there will be more people involved in it later, so I'm using Git for the version control. I clone the bare repo on all computers, and when I finish my modifications on one of them, I commit and push the changes to the bare repo. From what I've read, the bare repository does NOT have a "working tree", so if I clone the bare repo, I won't have a "working tree". I'm guessing that the working tree stores the commit information, branches, etc. from the project. That wouldn't appear in the bare repo. So it seems better for me to "push" the commits to the repo with the working tree. Then, why should I use the bare repository and why not? What's the practical difference? That would not be beneficial to more people working on a project, I suppose. What are your methods for this kind of work? Suggestions?

@TITLE:HintPath vs ReferencePath in Visual Studio
@CONTENT:What exactly is the difference between the HintPath in a .csproj file and the ReferencePath in a .csproj.user file? We're trying to commit to a convention where dependency DLLs are in a "releases" svn repo and all projects point to a particular release. Since different developers have different folder structures, relative references won't work, so we came up with a scheme to use an environment variable pointing to the particular developer's releases folder to create an absolute reference. So after a reference is added, we manually edit the project file to change the reference to an absolute path using the environment variable. I've noticed that this can be done with both the HintPath and the ReferencePath, but the only difference I could find between them is that HintPath is resolved at build-time and ReferencePath when the project is loaded into the IDE. I'm not really sure what the ramifications of that are though. I have noticed that VS sometimes rewrites the .csproj.user and I have to rewrite the ReferencePath, but I'm not sure what triggers that. I've heard that it's best not to check in the .csproj.user file since it's user-specific, so I'd like to aim for that, but I've also heard that the HintPath-specified DLL isn't "guaranteed" to be loaded if the same DLL is e.g. located in the project's output directory. Any thoughts on this?

Should the .on() click handlers always be inside document.ready? Performance: Is it more performant to keep various javascript/jQuery objects inside or outside document.ready (also, is the performance difference significant?)? Object scope: AJAX-loaded pages can't access objects that were inside the prior page's document.ready, correct? They can only access objects which were outside document.ready (i.e., truly "global" objects)? Update: To follow a best practice, all my javascript (the jQuery library and my app's code) is at the bottom of my HTML page and I'm using the defer attribute on the jQuery-containing scripts on my AJAX-loaded pages so that I can access the jQuery library on these pages.

 No @property, no @synthesize, just the declaration above. Also I know Apple adds a _inFrontOfTheirPrivateInstanceVariables, but they said somewhere that they don't like to see others doing that because they might override accidently hidden instance variables when doing that. What's the trick here?

@TITLE:In MATLAB, how do I plot to an image and save the result without displaying it?
@CONTENT:This question kind of starts where this question ends up. MATLAB has a powerful and flexible image display system which lets you use the imshow and plot commands to display complex images and then save the result. For example: im = imread('image.tif');
f = figure, imshow(im, 'Border', 'tight');
rectangle('Position', [100, 100, 10, 10]);
print(f, '-r80', '-dtiff', 'image2.tif');
 This works great. The problem is that if you are doing a lot of image processing, it starts to be real drag to show every image you create - you mostly want to just save them. I know I could start directly writing to an image and then saving the result. But using plot/rectangle/imshow is so easy, so I'm hoping there is a command that can let me call plot, imshow etc, not display the results and then save what would have been displayed. Anyone know any quick solutions for this? Alternatively, a quick way to put a spline onto a bitmap might work...
@CODE:im = imread('image.tif');
f = figure, imshow(im, 'Border', 'tight');
rectangle('Position', [100, 100, 10, 10]);

@LINK:/questions/8790321/why-do-the-order-of-media-queries-matter-in-css
@TITLE:Why do the order of media queries matter in CSS?
@CONTENT:Of late, I've been designing sites that are more responsive and I've been using these media queries pretty frequently. One pattern I noticed is that the order in which the media queries are defined actually matters. I didn't test it in every single browser, but just on Chrome. Is there an explanation for this behaviour? Sometimes it gets frustrating when your site doesn't work as it should and you are unsure if its the query or the order of the query. Here's an example: HTML <body>
<div class="one"><h1>Welcome to my website</h1></div>
<div class="two"><a href="#">Contact us</a></div>
</body>
 CSS: body{
font-size:1em; /* 16px */
}

.two{margin-top:2em;}



/* Media Queries */

@media (max-width: 480px) {
    .body{font-size: 0.938em;}

}
/* iphone */
@media only screen and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) {
    body {font-size: 0.938em;}
}
/*if greater than 1280x800*/
@media (min-width: 1200px) {
       .two{margin-top:8em;}
            }
/*1024x600*/
@media (max-height: 600px) {
       .two{margin-top:4em;}
}
/*1920x1024*/
@media (min-height: 1020px) {
       .two{margin-top:9em;}
}
/*1366x768*/
@media (min-height: 750px) and (max-height: 770px) {
       .two{margin-top:7em;}
}
 However, If I wrote the query for 1024x600 in the last, the browser would ignore it and apply the margin value specified in the starting of the CSS (margin-top:2em). /* Media Queries - Re-arranged version */

@media (max-width: 480px) {
    .body{font-size: 0.938em;}
}
/* iphone */
@media only screen and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) {
    body {font-size: 0.938em;}
}
/*if greater than 1280x800*/
@media (min-width: 1200px) {
       .two{margin-top:8em;}
}
/*1920x1024*/
@media (min-height: 1020px) {
       .two{margin-top:9em;}
}
/*1366x768*/
@media (min-height: 750px) and (max-height: 770px) {
       .two{margin-top:7em;}
}
 /*1024x600*/
@media (max-height: 600px) {
       .two{margin-top:4em;}
}
 If my understanding of media queries are correct, the order shouldn't matter, but it seems it does. What could be the reason?
@CODE:<body>
<div class="one"><h1>Welcome to my website</h1></div>
<div class="two"><a href="#">Contact us</a></div>
</body> body{
font-size:1em; /* 16px */
}

.two{margin-top:2em;}



/* Media Queries */

@media (max-width: 480px) {
    .body{font-size: 0.938em;}

}
/* iphone */
@media only screen and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) {
    body {font-size: 0.938em;}
}
/*if greater than 1280x800*/

@TITLE:Launching activity from widget
@CONTENT:I'm trying to do something which really ought to be quite easy, but it's driving me crazy. I'm trying to launch an activity when a home screen widget is pressed, such as a configuration activity for the widget. I think I've followed word for word the tutorial on the Android Developers website, and even a few unofficial tutorials as well, but I must be missing something important as it doesn't work. Here is the code: public class VolumeChangerWidget extends AppWidgetProvider {

public void onUpdate(Context context, AppWidgetManager appWidgetManager, int[] appWidgetIds){
	final int N = appWidgetIds.length;

	for (int i=0; i < N; i++) {
		int appWidgetId = appWidgetIds[i];

		Log.d("Steve", "Running for appWidgetId " + appWidgetId);
		Toast.makeText(context, "Hello from onUpdate", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT);
		Log.d("Steve", "After the toast line");

		Intent intent = new Intent(context, WidgetTest.class);

		PendingIntent pendingIntent = PendingIntent.getActivity(context, 0, intent, 0);

		RemoteViews views = new RemoteViews(context.getPackageName(), R.layout.widget);
		views.setOnClickPendingIntent(R.id.button, pendingIntent);

		appWidgetManager.updateAppWidget(appWidgetId, views);
	}
}
 } When adding the widget to the homescreen, Logcat shows the two debugging lines, though not the Toast. (Any ideas why not?) However, more vexing is that when I then click on the button with the PendingIntent associated with it, nothing happens at all. I know the "WidgetTest" activity can run because if I set up an Intent from within the main activity, it launches fine. In case it matters, here is the Android Manifest file: <manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"

 Is there a way to test where the fault is? I.e. is the fault that the button isn't linked properly to the PendingIntent, or that the PendingIntent or Intent isn't finding WidgetTest.class, etc? Thanks very much for your help! Steve

@LINK:/questions/18970458/redis-actioncontrollerlive-threads-not-dying
@TITLE:Redis + ActionController::Live threads not dying
@CONTENT:Background: We've built a chat feature in to one of our existing Rails applications. We're using the new ActionController::Live module and running Puma (with Nginx in production), and subscribing to messages through Redis. We're using EventSource client side to establish the connection asynchronously. Problem Summary: Threads are never dying when the connection is terminated. For example, should the user navigate away, close the browser, or even go to a different page within the application, a new thread is spawned (as expected), but the old one continues to live. The problem as I presently see it is that when any of these situations occur, the server has no way of knowing whether the connection on the browser's end is terminated, until something attempts to write to this broken stream, which would never happen once the browser has moved away from the original page. This problem seems to be documented on github, and similar questions are asked on StackOverflow here (pretty well exact same question) and here (regarding getting number of active threads). The only solution I've been able to come up with, based on these posts, is to implement a type of thread / connection poker. Attempting to write to a broken connection generates an IOError which I can catch and properly close the connection, allowing the thread to die. This is the controller code for that solution: def events
  response.headers["Content-Type"] = "text/event-stream"

  stream_error = false; # used by flusher thread to determine when to stop

  redis = Redis.new

  # Subscribe to our events
  redis.subscribe("message.create", "message.user_list_update") do |on| 
    on.message do |event, data| # when message is received, write to stream
      response.stream.write("messageType: '#{event}', data: #{data}\n\n")
    end

    # This is the monitor / connection poker thread
    # Periodically poke the connection by attempting to write to the stream
    flusher_thread = Thread.new do
      while !stream_error
        $redis.publish "message.create", "flusher_test"
        sleep 2.seconds
      end
    end
  end 

  rescue IOError
    logger.info "Stream closed"
    stream_error = true;
  ensure
    logger.info "Events action is quitting redis and closing stream!"
    redis.quit
    response.stream.close
end
 (Note: the events method seems to get blocked on the subscribe method invocation. Everything else (the streaming) works properly so I assume this is normal.) (Other note: the flusher thread concept makes more sense as a single long-running background process, a bit like a garbage thread collector. The problem with my implementation above is that a new thread is spawned for each connection, which is pointless. Anyone attempting to implement this concept should do it more like a single process, not so much as I've outlined. I'll update this post when I successfully re-implement this as a single background process.) The downside of this solution is that we've only delayed or lessened the problem, not completely solved it. We still have 2 threads per user, in addition to other requests such as ajax, which seems terrible from a scaling perspective; it seems completely unattainable and impractical for a larger system with many possible concurrent connections. I feel like I am missing something vital; I find it somewhat difficult to believe that Rails has a feature that is so obviously broken without implementing a custom connection-checker like I have done. Question: How do we allow the connections / threads to die without implementing something corny such as a 'connection poker', or garbage thread collector? As always let me know if I've left anything out. Update Just to add a bit of extra info: Huetsch over at github posted this comment pointing out that SSE is based on TCP, which normally sends a FIN packet when the connection is closed, letting the other end (server in this case) know that its safe to close the connection. Huetsch points out that either the browser is not sending that packet (perhaps a bug in the EventSource library?), or Rails is not catching it or doing anything with it (definitely a bug in Rails, if that's the case). The search continues... Another Update Using Wireshark, I can indeed see FIN packets being sent. Admittedly, I am not very knowledgeable or experienced with protocol level stuff, however from what I can tell, I definitely detect a FIN packet being sent from the browser when I establish the SSE connection using EventSource from the browser, and NO packet sent if I remove that connection (meaning no SSE). Though I'm not terribly up on my TCP knowledge, this seems to indicate to me that the connection is indeed being properly terminated by the client; perhaps this indicates a bug in Puma or Rails. Yet another update @JamesBoutcher / boutcheratwest(github) pointed me to a discussion on the redis website regarding this issue, specifically in regards to the fact that the .(p)subscribe method never shuts down. The poster on that site pointed out the same thing that we've discovered here, that the Rails environment is never notified when the client-side connection is closed, and therefore is unable to execute the .(p)unsubscribe method. He inquires about a timeout for the .(p)subscribe method, which I think would work as well, though I'm not sure which method (the connection poker I've described above, or his timeout suggestion) would be a better solution. Ideally, for the connection poker solution, I'd like to find a way to determine whether the connection is closed on the other end without writing to the stream. As it is right now, as you can see, I have to implement client-side code to handle my "poking" message separately, which I believe is obtrusive and goofy as heck.
@CODE:IOError def events
  response.headers["Content-Type"] = "text/event-stream"

  stream_error = false; # used by flusher thread to determine when to stop

  redis = Redis.new

  # Subscribe to our events

@TITLE:Elasticsearch, Tire, and Nested queries / associations with ActiveRecord
@CONTENT:I'm using ElasticSearch with Tire to index and search some ActiveRecord models, and I've been searching for the "right" way to index and search associations. I haven't found what seems like a best practice for this, so I wanted to ask if anyone has an approach that they think works really well. As an example setup (this is made up but illustrates the problem), let's say we have a book, with chapters. Each book has a title and author, and a bunch of chapters. Each chapter has text. We want to index the book's fields and the chapters' text so you can search for a book by author, or for any book with certain words in it. class Book < ActiveRecord::Base
  include Tire::Model::Search
  include Tire::Model::Callbacks

  has_many :chapters

  mapping do
    indexes :title, :analyzer => 'snowball', :boost => 100
    indexes :author, :analyzer => 'snowball'
    indexes :chapters, type: 'object', properties: {
      chapter_text: { type: 'string', analyzer: 'snowball' }
    }
  end
end

class Chapter < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :book
end
 So then I do the search with: s = Book.search do
  query { string query_string }
end
 That doesn't work, even though it seems like that indexing should do it. If instead I index: indexes :chapters, :as => 'chapters.map{|c| c.chapter_text}.join('|'), :analyzer => 'snowball'
 That makes the text searchable, but obviously it's not a nice hack and it loses the actual associated object. I've tried variations of the searching, like: s = Book.search do
  query do
    boolean do
      should { string query_string }
      should { string "chapters.chapter_text:#{query_string}" }
    end
  end
end
 With no luck there, either. If anyone has a good, clear example of indexing and searching associated ActiveRecord objects using Tire, it seems like that would be a really good addition to the knowledge base here. Thanks for any ideas and contributions.

@TITLE:Why is Graphics.MeasureString() returning a higher than expected number?
@CONTENT:I'm generating a receipt and am using the Graphics object to call the DrawString method to print out the required text. graphics.DrawString(string, font, brush, widthOfPage / 2F, yPoint, stringformat);
 This works fine for what I needed it to do. I always knew what I was printing out, so I could manually trim any strings so it would fit properly on 80mm receipt paper. Then I had to add an extra bit of functionality that would make this more flexible. The user could pass in strings that would be added to the bottom. Since I didn't know what they were going to put, I just created my own word wrap function that takes in a number of characters to wrap at and the string itself. In order to find out the number of characters, I was doing something like this: float width = document.DefaultPageSettings.PrintableArea.Width;
int max = (int)(width / graphics.MeasureString("a", font).Width);
 Now the width is returning me 283, which in mm is about 72, which makes sense when you account for margins on 80mm paper. But the MeasureString method is returning 10.5 on a Courier New 8pt font. So instead of getting around what I expected to be 36 - 40, I'm getting 26, resulting in 2 lines of text being turned into 3-4. The units for PrintableArea.Width are 1/100th of an inch, and the PageUnit for the graphics object is Display (which says is typically 1/100th of an inch for printers). So why am I only getting 26 back?
@CODE:graphics.DrawString(string, font, brush, widthOfPage / 2F, yPoint, stringformat); float width = document.DefaultPageSettings.PrintableArea.Width;
int max = (int)(width / graphics.MeasureString("a", font).Width);

Does anybody know or have a already coded, simple solution that reliably splits such a file into single queries (there could be multi-line statements) and runs the query. I would like to avoid to start fiddling with it myself due to the many gotchas that I'm likely to come across (How to detect whether a field delimiter is part of the data; how to deal with line breaks in memo fields; and so on). There must be a ready made solution for this.

@CONTENT:I'm a beginner in Objective-C, and I decided to try to write some simple application, so I'm trying to make an app which would measure CPU usage and such. Is there a simple way to get information such as the CPU percent usage using Objective-C in a Cocoa application? I have found this question Determine Process Info Programmatically in Darwin/OSX which is similar, but not exactly the same. Mainly, I want the CPU percent usage of the whole system, not just my process, and I would actually prefer an Objective-C solution whereas in that question the poster wanted something else.

@TITLE:My HTML5 Application Cache Manifest is caching everything
@CONTENT:UPDATE: ** I posted this question when this feature was really new, I realize now that this feature should not be used this way unless it is used via JavaScript. but seems like this hack is a great solution for most beginners who make the same mistake and misuse of this feature. If you want to cache everything except your HTML this should be done with JS or you could use the solution below ** I guess my question boils down to this: If the file referencing the manifest using the manifest attribute of the HTML tag falls under the MASTER CACHE ENTRIES how could you have a dynamic page use the manifest. My file looks like this: CACHE MANIFEST

 Now the problem is once I browse a page not in the manifest, my actual dynamic php files like index.php, when I first see the page and there in no cache chrome goes: Adding master entry to Application Cache with manifest http://208.109.248.197/manifest.appcache

 So far so good until I actually load a page, and chrome goes: Application Cache UpdateReady event
Adding master entry to Application Cache with manifest http://mydomain.com/manifest.appcache
 now as you can see in the last line it adds index.php to my application cache and I have verified this by going to url: chrome://appcache-internals/ It says: Flags   URL Size (headers and data)
Explicit,   http://mydomain/JAVASCRIPT/header_javascript.js 57.5 kB
Master, http://mydomain/home.php 51.2 kB
Master, http://mydomain/index.php   53.5 kB
Master, Fallback,   http://mydomain/offline.php 49.4 kB
 where things like index.php and home.php are not supposed to be cached. I would like to tell it to not cache any html extensions if possible. But here is what I have learned from various RFC I believe: An online whitelist wildcard flag, which is either open or blocking. The open state indicates that any URL not listed as cached is to be implicitly treated as being in the online whitelist namespaces; the blocking state indicates that URLs not listed explicitly in the manifest are to be treated as unavailable.
 well I would like to use one of these online white-list wildcard flags and set it to blocking but I can not find any explanations or examples further more. I also read: zero or more URLs that form the online whitelist namespaces.

These are used as prefix match patterns, and declare URLs for which the user agent will ignore the application cache, instead fetching them normally (i.e. from the network or locale HTTP cache as appropriate).
 I would also like to use some pattern like this but then again I can find no documentation. Why is there no sign of appcache manifest documentation and no other website I've been to is using it , since my chrome appcache directory shows none!?!? Thank you for your time!

@TITLE:How to make embedded hasMany relationships work with ember data
@CONTENT:I can't get embedded hasMany to work correctly with ember data. I have something like this App.Post = DS.Model.extend({
  comments: DS.hasMany('App.Comment')
});

App.Comment = DS.Model.extend({
  post: DS.hasMany('App.Post'),
  name: attr('string')
});
 And my API returns the following for GET /post: [
  {
   id: 1
   comments: [{name: 'test'}, {name: 'test2'}]
  },
  ...
]
 I need to send this with POST /post: [
  {
    comments: [{name: 'test'}, {name: 'test2'}]
  },
  ...
]
 I want to work with Ember models and have them make the appropriate requests: var post = App.store.createRecord(App.Post, hash_post_without_comments);
post.get('comments').createRecord(hash_comment);

App.store.commit(); // This should call the POST api 
 and var posts = App.store.find(App.Post); // This should call the GET api 
 When I try something like post: DS.hasMany('App.Post', {embedded: true}), the GET is working but the POST is trying to make a POST for the two records not only the parent one. EDIT : My Real use case 1- I've just built ember data from master 2- My adapter: RESTAdapter 3- The serializer: JSONSerializer 4- I added App.MyAdapter.map('App.Join', {
    columns: { embedded: 'always' }
});
 5- My Models are: App.Join = DS.Model.extend({
    rowCount: DS.attr('number'),
    columns: DS.hasMany('App.JoinColumn'),
});

App.JoinColumn = DS.Model.extend({
    join: DS.belongsTo('App.Join')
});
 6- When: var a = App.Join.find(1);
a.get('columns').createRecord({});
App.store.commit();
 a POST for joincolumn is sent and the parent is not dirty What am i missing?
@CODE:embedded hasMany App.Post = DS.Model.extend({

Allow a maximum of 5 download tasks, other tasks have to wait Users can cancel the download task, and remove this task from the ListView The ListView is in the download activity. Users can change to another activity. When they leave, continue downloading in the background. When they come back, display the current progress and status of the download tasks. Keep the completed download tasks until users want to remove them. I tried to use the ThreadPoolExcutor in a Service. For each download task, I can get the percentage complete, but I don't know how to broadcast them to an adapter to display progress. And I don't know how to keep all the tasks running in the background and then post progress when the activity containing the ListView is active and keep the completed tasks It would be great if there were any library or example which can solve my problems.

Please provide complete cut-n-paste ready code fragments with your response!

@CONTENT:I set the page to scroll to top when a button is clicked. But first I used an if statement to see if the top of the page was not set to 0. Then if it's not 0 I animate the page to scroll to the top. var body = $("body");
var top = body.scrollTop() // Get position of the body

if(top!=0)
{
  body.animate({scrollTop:0}, '500');

 The tricky part now is animating something AFTER the page has scrolled to the top. So my next thought is, find out what the page position is. So I used console log to find out. console.log(top);  // the result was 365
 This gave me a result of 365, I'm guessing that is the position number I was at just before scrolling to the top. My question is how do I set the position to be 0, so that I can add another animation that runs once the page is at 0? Thanks!

@TITLE:Locking binary files using git version control system
@CONTENT:For one and a half years, I have been keeping my eyes on the git community in hopes of making the switch away from SVN. One particular issue holding me back is the inability to lock binary files. Throughout the past year I have yet to see developments on this issue. I understand that locking files goes against the fundamental principles of distributed source control, but I don't see how a web development company can take advantage of git to track source code and image file changes when there is the potential for binary file conflicts. To achieve the effects of locking, a "central" repository must be identified. Regardless of the distributed nature of git, most companies will have a "central" repository for a software project. We should be able to mark a file as requiring a lock from the governing git repository at a specified address. Perhaps this is made difficult because git tracks file contents not files? Do any of you have experience in dealing with git and binary files that should be locked before modification? NOTE: It looks like Source Gear's new open source distributed version control project, Veracity, has locking as one of its goals.

 In other threads about similar problems the reason seems to be that the onPostExecute method is called before the onResume() method is called. But I get the exception even though onResume() is called before. Does someone knows what's wrong? The Activity looks like this: public class MyFragmentActivity extends FragmentActivity implements OnFriendSelectedListener, OnFriendAddedListener, OnFriendOptionSelectedListener, LoaderCallbacks<Cursor> {

@Override
public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    Log.v("MyFragmentActivity", "onCreate");
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.fragment_activity_layout);
    FragmentManager fm = getSupportFragmentManager();
    FragmentTransaction ft = fm.beginTransaction();
    FriendListFragment friendListFragment = (FriendListFragment)fm.findFragmentById(R.id.friend_list_fragment_layout);
    if (friendListFragment == null) {
        friendListFragment = new FriendListFragment(); 
        ft.add(R.id.friend_list_fragment_layout, friendListFragment);
        ft.commit();
        fm.executePendingTransactions();
        startService(new Intent(this, MyIntentService.class));
        getSupportLoaderManager().initLoader(CHECK_EMPTY_DATABASE, null, this);
    }
}

    @Override
public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu) {
    super.onCreateOptionsMenu(menu);
    getMenuInflater().inflate(R.menu.fragment_activity_options_menu, menu);
    return true;
}

@Override
public boolean onOptionsItemSelected(MenuItem item) {
    super.onOptionsItemSelected(item);
    switch (item.getItemId()) {
    case R.id.add_friend_menu_item:
        AddFriendDialogFragment addFriendDialogFragment = AddFriendDialogFragment.newInstance();
        addFriendDialogFragment.show(getSupportFragmentManager(), "add_friend_dialog_fragment");
        return true;
    default:
        return false;
    }
}

@Override
public void onFriendAdded(String name) {
    name = name.trim();
    if (name.length() > 0) {
        new onFriendAddedAsyncTask().execute(name);
    }
}
 When using commitAllowingStateLoss() I get the following exception: 01-06 14:54:29.548: E/AndroidRuntime(18020): FATAL EXCEPTION: main

 I get the same IllegalStateExeption when I implement the AsynTask as follows, because the findFragmentById() method returns a null pointer. private class onFriendAddedAsyncTask extends AsyncTask<String, Void, String> {

    protected void onPreExecute() {
        Log.v("MyFragmentActivity", "onFriendAddedAsyncTask/onPreExecute");
        FragmentManager fm = getSupportFragmentManager();
        FragmentTransaction ft = fm.beginTransaction();
        DummyFragment dummyFragment = DummyFragment.newInstance();
        ft.add(R.id.dummy_fragment_layout, dummyFragment);
        ft.commit();
    }

    protected void onPostExecute(String result) {
        Log.v("MyFragmentActivity", "onFriendAddedAsyncTask/onPostExecute");
        FragmentManager fm = getSupportFragmentManager();
        FragmentTransaction ft = fm.beginTransaction();
        DummyFragment dummyFragment = (DummyFragment) fm.findFragmentById(R.id.dummy_fragment_layout);
        ft.remove(dummyFragment);
        ft.commitAllowingStateLoss();
    }
 In the next step I use a handler for the adding and removing the DummyFragment. Additionally I've added some more debug output. private class onFriendAddedAsyncTask extends AsyncTask<String, Void, String> {

    @Override
    protected void onPreExecute() {
        Log.v("MyFragmentActivity", "onFriendAddedAsyncTask/onPreExecute " + getSupportFragmentManager());
        Log.v("MyFragmentActivity", "onFriendAddedAsyncTask/onPreExecute " + getSupportFragmentManager().findFragmentById(R.id.dummy_fragment_layout));
        Log.v("MyFragmentActivity", "onFriendAddedAsyncTask/onPreExecute " + getSupportFragmentManager().findFragmentById(R.id.friend_list_fragment_layout));

        new Handler().post(new Runnable() {
            public void run() {
                Log.v("MyFragmentActivity", "onFriendAddedAsyncTask/onPreExecute " + getSupportFragmentManager());
                Log.v("MyFragmentActivity", "onFriendAddedAsyncTask/onPreExecute " + getSupportFragmentManager().findFragmentById(R.id.dummy_fragment_layout));
                Log.v("MyFragmentActivity", "onFriendAddedAsyncTask/onPreExecute " + getSupportFragmentManager().findFragmentById(R.id.friend_list_fragment_layout));
                FragmentManager fm = getSupportFragmentManager();
                FragmentTransaction ft = fm.beginTransaction();
                DummyFragment dummyFragment = DummyFragment.newInstance();
                ft.add(R.id.dummy_fragment_layout, dummyFragment);
                ft.commit();
            }
        });

    @Override
    protected void onPostExecute(String result) {
        Log.v("MyFragmentActivity", "onFriendAddedAsyncTask/onPostExecute " + getSupportFragmentManager());
        Log.v("MyFragmentActivity", "onFriendAddedAsyncTask/onPostExecute " + getSupportFragmentManager().findFragmentById(R.id.dummy_fragment_layout));
        Log.v("MyFragmentActivity", "onFriendAddedAsyncTask/onPostExecute " + getSupportFragmentManager().findFragmentById(R.id.friend_list_fragment_layout));

        new Handler().post(new Runnable() {
            public void run() {
                Log.v("MyFragmentActivity", "onFriendAddedAsyncTask/onPostExecute " + getSupportFragmentManager());
                Log.v("MyFragmentActivity", "onFriendAddedAsyncTask/onPostExecute " + getSupportFragmentManager().findFragmentById(R.id.dummy_fragment_layout));
                Log.v("MyFragmentActivity", "onFriendAddedAsyncTask/onPostExecute " + getSupportFragmentManager().findFragmentById(R.id.friend_list_fragment_layout));
                FragmentManager fm = getSupportFragmentManager();
                FragmentTransaction ft = fm.beginTransaction();
                DummyFragment dummyFragment = (DummyFragment) fm.findFragmentById(R.id.dummy_fragment_layout);
                ft.remove(dummyFragment);
                ft.commitAllowingStateLoss();
            }
        });
 I get following LogCut: 01-07 19:00:17.273: V/MyFragmentActivity(4124): onFriendAddedAsyncTask/onPreExecute FragmentManager{45e384a8 in MyFragmentActivity{45e38358}}

 In onPreExecute() the FriendListFragment has the id=0x7f0a0002. Inside the handler the DummyFragment is created with id=0x7f0a0004. In onPostExecute() both IDs are null. In onPreExecute() the address of MyFragmentActivity is 45e38358. but in onPostExecute() it's null. But in both methods the FragmentManager address is 45e384a8. I guess onPostExecute uses an invalid FragmentManager. But why?

@TITLE:UITableView with static cells does not appear
@CONTENT:I have created a new Xcode project using Storyboards (tab view template). I added a couple of view controllers to my storyboard, and wanted to use a UITableView with static cells for one. I created it, but when I run in the simulator the cells don't appear. I haven't changed anything in the project except for this storyboard file. I am showing screenshots of the storyboard editor and the simulator running. The label shows up, so the view is loading correctly. I set the background color to gray so I can see the talbeview is loading. All cells are set to visible. I changed their style to Basic and edited the label, and added a disclosure indicator, that's all.

@LINK:/questions/86105/how-can-i-supress-the-browsers-authentication-dialog
@TITLE:How can I supress the browser's authentication dialog?
@CONTENT:My web application has a login page that submits authentication credentials via an AJAX call. If the user enters the correct username and password, everything is fine, but if not, the following happens: The web server determines that although the request included a well-formed Authorization header, the credentials in the header do not successfully authenticate. The web server returns a 401 status code and includes one or more WWW-Authenticate headers listing the supported authentication types. The browser detects that the response to my call on the XMLHttpRequest object is a 401 and the response includes WWW-Authenticate headers. It then pops up an authentication dialog asking, again, for the username and password. This is all fine up until step 3. I don't want the dialog to pop up, I want want to handle the 401 response in my AJAX callback function. (For example, by displaying an error message on the login page.) I want the user to re-enter their username and password, of course, but I want them to see my friendly, reassuring login form, not the browser's ugly, default authentication dialog. Incidentally, I have no control over the server, so having it return a custom status code (i.e., something other than a 401) is not an option. Is there any way I can suppress the authentication dialog? In particular, can I suppress the Authentication Required dialog in Firefox 2 or later? Is there any way to suppress the Connect to [host] dialog in IE 6 and later? Edit Additional information from the author (Sept. 18): I should add that the real problem with the browser's authentication dialog popping up is that it give insufficient information to the user. The user has just entered a username and password via the form on the login page, he believes he has typed them both correctly, and he has clicked the submit button or hit enter. His expectation is that he will be taken to the next page or perhaps told that he has entered his information incorrectly and should try again. However, he is instead presented with an unexpected dialog box. The dialog makes no acknowledgment of the fact he just did enter a username and password. It does not clearly state that there was a problem and that he should try again. Instead, the dialog box presents the user with cryptic information like "The site says: '[realm]'." Where [realm] is a short realm name that only a programmer could love. Web broswer designers take note: no one would ask how to suppress the authentication dialog if the dialog itself were simply more user-friendly. The entire reason that I am doing a login form is that our product management team rightly considers the browsers' authentication dialogs to be awful.

 Which one should I integrate as I think only 1 is necessary ? [actually can you only integrate one or ?] Frankly, IMHO - I think OpenGraph is "less intrusive" to the total codebase - as it's easier to implement Partial Views [using ASP.NET MVC] whereas the Schema.org protocol requires [at least in my opinion] disruptive HTML add-ins across your code ? Edit: Seems I ended up integrating both - not sure whether this is allowed but the documentation on Schema.org is unclear. Notably, this link doesn't provide much info Q: How does schema.org relate to Facebook Open Graph? Facebook Open Graph serves its purpose well, but it doesn't provide the detailed information search engines need to improve the user experience. A single web page may have many components, and it may talk about more than one thing. If search engines understand the various components of a page, we can improve our presentation of the data. Even if you mark up your content using the Facebook Open Graph protocol, schema.org provides a mechanism for providing more detail about particular entities on the page. For example, a page about a band could include any or all of the following: A list of albums A price for each album A list of songs for each album, along with a link to hear samples of each song A list of upcoming shows Bios of the band members So I assume that they are compatible together.

For example, a request for "myhost.com/css/global.css" would return a 404, even though the resource exists as Spring intercepts the request.

@CONTENT:In a comment on this answer of another question, the commenter says: don¡¦t use kill?-9 unless absolutely necessary! SIGKILL can¡¦t be trapped so the killed program can¡¦t run any shutdown routines to e.g.?erase temporary files. First try HUP?(1), then INT?(2), then QUIT?(3) I agree in principle about SIGKILL, but the rest is news to me. Given that the default signal sent by kill is SIGTERM, I would expect it is the most-commonly expected signal for graceful shutdown of an arbitrary process. Also, I have seen SIGHUP used for non-terminating reasons, such as telling a daemon "re-read your config file." And it seems to me that SIGINT (the same interrupt you'd typically get with Ctrl-C, right?) isn't as widely supported as it ought to be, or terminates rather ungracefully. Given that SIGKILL is a last resort ¡X Which signals, and in what order, should you send to an arbitrary process, in order to shut it down as gracefully as possible? Please substantiate your answers with supporting facts (beyond personal preference or opinion) or references, if you can. Note: I am particularly interested in best practices that include consideration of bash/Cygwin. Edit: So far, nobody seems to mention INT or QUIT, and there's limited mention of HUP. Is there any reason to include these in an orderly process-killing?

@CONTENT:I'd like to use the new CardView widget that was introduced with the new Android L Developer Preview Support Library (As mentioned here), which seems to be part of a new revision of the v7 support library. I have now updated my SDK version, downloaded the newest Support Library package, but I still cannot find the new CardView widget. I already searched the web and the official docs, but could not get any hints on where I can get the new support library. Any help is highly appreciated! EDIT: I'm using ADT/Eclipse

@TITLE:Well, how does the custom deleter of std::unique_ptr work?
@CONTENT:According to N3290 std::unique_ptr accepts a deleter argument in its constructor. However, I can't get that to work with Visual C++ 10.0 or MinGW g++ 4.4.1 in Windows, nor with g++ 4.6.1 in Ubuntu. I therefore fear that my understanding of it is incomplete or wrong, I can't see the point of a deleter argument that's apparently ignored, so can anyone provide a working example? Preferably I'd like to see also how that works for unique_ptr<Base> p = unique_ptr<Derived>( new Derived ). Possibly with some wording from the standard to back up the example, i.e. that with whatever compiler you're using, it actually does what it's supposed to do?

@CONTENT:After reading already asked question on the subject and a lot of googling I am still not able to have a clear view of -Xms option My question is: what's the difference between java -Xms=512m -Xmx=512m and java -Xms=64m -Xmx=512m? For now I have the following answer: The only difference is in the number of garbage collections that will be run during my application's run and the number of memory allocations. Am I right ? Here are my reasons for this answer: Setting the -Xms option to 512m doesn't result in my application using really 512M of physical memory after startup. I guess this is related to modern OS virtual memory management and lazy pages allocations. (I noticed that setting -Xms to 512M or to 64M doesn't change at all the initial used memory reported either by top on Linux or by the task manager on windows) Can someone help me to understand the impact of this Xms option or point me to links that will help me to understand it?

@TITLE:With ARC, what's better: alloc or autorelease initializers?
@CONTENT:Is it better (faster & more efficient) to use alloc or autorelease initializers. E.g.: - (NSString *)hello:(NSString *)name {
    return [[NSString alloc] initWithFormat:@"Hello, %@", name];
}
 OR - (NSString *)hello:(NSString *)name {
    return [NSString stringWithFormat:@"Hello, %@", name];
//    return [@"Hello, " stringByAppendingString:name]; // even simpler
}
 I know that in most cases, performance here shouldn't matter. But, I'd still like to get in the habit of doing it the better way. If they do exactly the same thing, then I prefer the latter option because it's shorter to type and more readable. In Xcode 4.2, is there a way to see what ARC compiles to, i.e., where it puts retain, release, autorelease, etc? This feature would be very useful while switching over to ARC. I know you shouldn't have to think about this stuff, but it'd help me figure out the answer to questions like these.
@CODE:alloc autorelease - (NSString *)hello:(NSString *)name {
    return [[NSString alloc] initWithFormat:@"Hello, %@", name];
} - (NSString *)hello:(NSString *)name {

@CONTENT:I have a well-formed tree that represents a mathematical expression. For example, given the string: "1+2-3*4/5", this gets parsed into: subtract(add(1,2),divide(multiply(3,4),5))
 Which is expressed as this tree: What I'd like to be able to do is take this tree and reduce it as much as possible. In the case above, this is pretty simple, because all of the numbers are constants. However, things start to get trickier once I allow for unknowns (denoted with a $ followed by an identifier): "3*$a/$a" becomes divide(multiply(3,$a), $a) This should simplify to 3, since the $a terms should cancel each other out. The question is, "how do I go about recognizing this in a generic manner?" How do I recognize that min(3, sin($x)) is always going to be sin($x)? How do I recognize that sqrt(pow($a, 2)) is abs($a)? How do I recognize that nthroot(pow(42, $a), $a) (the ath root of 42 to the ath power) is 42? I realize this question is pretty broad, but I've been beating my head against this for a while and haven't come up with anything satisfactory enough.

@TITLE:VS2008 Setup Project: Shared (By All Users) Application Data Files?
@CONTENT:fellow anthropoids and lily pads and paddlewheels! I'm developing a Windows desktop app in C#/.NET/WPF, using VS 2008. The app is required to install and run on Vista and XP machines. I'm working on a Setup/Windows Installer Project to install the app. My app requires read/modify/write access to a SQLCE database file (.sdf) and some other database-type files related to a third-party control I'm using. These files should be shared among all users/log-ins on the PC, none of which can be required to be an Administrator. This means, of course, that the files can't go in the program's own installation directory (as such things often did before the arrival of Vista, yes, yes!). I had expected the solution to be simple. Vista and XP both have shared-application-data folders intended for this purpose. ("\ProgramData" in Vista, "\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data" in XP.) The .NET Environment.GetFolderPath(SpecialFolder.CommonApplicationData) call exists to find the paths to these folders on a given PC, yes, yes! But I can't figure out how to specify the shared-application-data folder as a target in the Setup project. The Setup project offers a "Common Files" folder, but that's intended for shared program components (not data files), is usually located under "\Program Files," and has the same security restrictions anything else in "\Program files" does, yes, yes! The Setup project offers a "User's Application Data" folder, but that's a per-user folder, which is exactly what I'm trying to avoid, yes, yes! Is it possible to add files to the shared-app-data folder in a robust, cross-Windows-version way from a VS 2008 setup project? Can anyone tell me how?

@TITLE:What is the most efficient method to groupby on a javascript array of objects?
@CONTENT:What is the most efficient way to groupby objects in an array? For example, given this array of objects: [ 
    { Phase: "Phase 1", Step: "Step 1", Task: "Task 1", Value: "5" },
    { Phase: "Phase 1", Step: "Step 1", Task: "Task 2", Value: "10" },

    { Phase: "Phase 2", Step: "Step 2", Task: "Task 2", Value: "40" }
]
 I'm displaying this information in a table. I'd like to groupby different methods, but I want to sum the values. I'm using underscore.js for its groupby function, which is helpful, but doesn't do the whole trick, because I don't want them "split up" but "merged", more like the SQL group-by method. What I'm looking for would be able to total specific values (if requested). So if I did groupby Phase, I'd want to receive: [
    { Phase: "Phase 1", Value: 50 },
    { Phase: "Phase 2", Value: 130 }
]
 And if I did groupy Phase / Step, I'd receive: [
    { Phase: "Phase 1", Step: "Step 1", Value: 15 },
    { Phase: "Phase 1", Step: "Step 2", Value: 35 },
    { Phase: "Phase 2", Step: "Step 1", Value: 55 },
    { Phase: "Phase 2", Step: "Step 2", Value: 75 }
]
 Is there a helpful script for this, or should I stick to using underscore.js, and then looping through the resulting object to do the totals myself?

    { Phase: "Phase 1", Step: "Step 1", Task: "Task 1", Value: "5" },

Yes, I have a structure which keeps track of a set of windows placed on the screen. I also have a grid which keeps track of all the areas between each edge, whether they are empty or filled, and the pixel position of their left or top edge. I think there is some modified form which would take advantage of this property. Do you know of any?

I have seen there is a question here Hashing function used in Java Language. But it doesn't answer the question, and I think the marked answer for that question is wrong. It says that hashCode() let you do your own hashing function for Hashtable, but I think it is wrong. The integer returned by hashCode() is the real key for Hashtble, then Hashtable uses a hashing function to hash the hashCode(). What this answer implies is that Java give you a chance to give Hashtable a hashing function, but no, it is wrong. hashCode() gives the real key, not the hashing function. So what exactly the hashing function does Java use?

@CONTENT:So I'm trying to make a very basic node.js server that with take in a request for a string, randomly select one from an array and return the selected string. Unfortunately I'm running into a few problems. Here's the front end: function newGame()
{
   guessCnt=0;
   guess="";
   server();
   displayHash();
   displayGuessStr();
   displayGuessCnt();
}

function server()
{
   xmlhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();

   xmlhttp.open("GET","server.js", true);
   xmlhttp.send();

   string=xmlhttp.responseText;
}
 This should send the request to server.js: var http = require('http');

var choices=["hello world", "goodbye world"];

console.log("server initialized");

http.createServer(function(request, response)
{
    console.log("request recieved");
    var string = choices[Math.floor(Math.random()*choices.length)];
    console.log("string '" + string + "' chosen");
    response.on(string);
    console.log("string sent");
}).listen(8001);
 So clearly there are several things going wrong here: I get the feeling the way I am "connecting" these two files isn't correct both in the xmlhttp.open method and in using response.on to send the string back to the front end. I'm a little confused with how I call this page on localhost. The front end is named index.html and the sever posts to 8001. What address should I be go to on localhost in order to access the initial html page after I have initialized server.js? Should I change it to .listen(index.html) or something like that? are there other obvious problems with how I am implementing this (using .responsetext etc.) (sorry for the long multi-question post but the various tutorials and the node.js source all assume that the user already has an understanding of these things.)

@TITLE:How to I serialize a large graph of .NET object into a SQL Server BLOB without creating a large buffer?
@CONTENT:We have code like: ms = New IO.MemoryStream
bin = New System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
bin.Serialize(ms, largeGraphOfObjects)
dataToSaveToDatabase = ms.ToArray()
// put dataToSaveToDatabase in a Sql server BLOB
 But the memory steam allocates a large buffer from the large memory heap that is giving us problems. So how can we stream the data without needing enough free memory to hold the serialized objects. I am looking for a way to get a Stream from SQL server that can then be passed to bin.Serialize() so avoiding keeping all the data in my processes memory. Likewise for reading the data back... Some more background. This is part of a complex numerical processing system that processes data in near real time looking for equipment problems etc, the serialization is done to allow a restart when there is a problem with data quality from a data feed etc. (We store the data feeds and can rerun them after the operator has edited out bad values.) Therefore we serialize the object a lot more often then we de-serialize them. The objects we are serializing include very large arrays mostly of doubles as well as a lot of small ¡§more normal¡¨ objects. We are pushing the memory limit on a 32 bit system and make the garage collector work very hard. (Effects are being made elsewhere in the system to improve this, e.g. reusing large arrays rather then create new arrays.) Often the serialization of the state is the last straw that courses an out of memory exception; our peak memory usage is while this serialization is being done. I think we get large memory pool fragmentation when we de-serialize the object, I expect there are also other problem with large memory pool fragmentation given the size of the arrays. (This has not yet been investigated, as the person that first looked at this is a numerical processing expert, not a memory management expert.) Are customers use a mix of Sql Server 2000, 2005 and 2008 and we would rather not have different code paths for each version of Sql Server if possible. We can have many active models at a time (in different process, across many machines), each model can have many saved states. Hence the saved state is stored in a database blob rather then a file. As the spread of saving the state is important, I would rather not serialize the object to a file, and then put the file in a BLOB one block at a time. Other related questions I have asked How to Stream data from/to SQL Server BLOB fields? Is there a SqlFileStream like class that works with Sql Server 2005?

@TITLE:To pass a parameter to event listener in AS3 the simple way¡K does it exist?
@CONTENT:Expected / pseudo example: stage.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, onClick.someWayToPassParameters(true, 123, 4.56, "string"));
function onClick(e:MouseEvent):void {
    trace("Received " + someWayToRetrieveParameters().b/i/n/s + ".");
}
 For many years (3~4), on every website, forum, blog, wherever I searched, people tell me there's no simple way to do this. They usually suggest to: Add the listener to a dynamic object, where you can set the value to an extra property and reference it (e.target.property / e.currentTarget.property) in the function. Not all classes are dynamic. It won't work on a Sprite, for example. Extend the class of the object with a custom class to add property or to just make it dynamic. You'll have to create a whole new tweak class everytime. Use an anonymous function as the event handler. There's no reference (and it's ugly). To remove the listener to free resources you're forced to do it from inside the function itself with arguments.callee. Call another function, using the parameter, inside the event handler. And where in the event handler call does the parameter go? Keep the event handler in the same scope as the parameter. Breach to a total semantic mess. Encapsulate both event handler definition and addEventListener call in a function receiving the target and parameters. It can mix scopes, but it's a close one. You have to be careful, though. ...Among many other suggested workarounds. All I want is just to pass an argument to the event handler so I can use it inside its function, just like any normal function! Am I asking for too much?

The specific reason I'm looking for this is because I have a collection of shapes on screen defined as paths, and I want to figure out which one the user clicked on. If there is a better way to be approaching this such as using different UI elements rather than doing it "the hard way" myself, I'm open to suggestions.

@CONTENT:I am just trying to start development in Android. So, the problem is that when I try to launch an emulator by issuing the command emulator @A2 , an emulator comes up on the screen. But even after waiting for as long as 2-3 hrs, all it shows is a black screen. Not even the android home screen or the android logo. Just a black screen. And while initially "adb devices" shows the emulator as offline.after 2-3 minutes the list of attached devices becomes blank. I searched all over net and tried all the steps mentioned there like kill and restart adb, install java/android in a directory without spaces, but to no avail. My Jdk and Android installations are in following folders: C:\Java32BitInstallation C:\AndroidSdkInstallation Here's the list of stuff I have downloaded/installed for it: Android SDK Tools, revision 13 Android SDK platforms tools, revision 10 SDK platform Android 4.0.3, API 15, revsion 1 Jdk jdk-7u3-windows-i586 In my path variable, I have added *C:\AndroidSdkInstallation\android-sdk\platform-tools\;C:\AndroidSdkInstallation\android-sdk\tools\;C:\Java32BitInstallation\;C:\Java32BitInstallation\bin* Also after reading somewhere from net I have added JAVA_HOME variable with its value as C:\Java32BitInstallation\ But still no use. I have both IntelliJ and Eclipse installed on my system. But since for starting the emulator, I am not using any of these, I dont suspect any foulplay with these. So, can anyone please help me with this stuff that's driving me crazy. I am trying for past 10-12 days and have not been able to start the emulator, let alone write my first "Hello world" program. Additional notes: My system is a windows 7 (64 bit) machine. Earlier I had installed 64 bit version of jdk, but the problem was present that time too. Now after searcching on internet, I uninstalled that and installed 32 bit version of Java. But, again no use. One thing, though, this 32 bit version of java (jdk 7 update 3), first install jre as part of jdk installation and then installs jre 7 . So now I have 2 folders: jre and jre7 in the C:\Java32BitInstallation directory. Could this have to do anthing with my emulator not turning up. Do I need to specify aditional environmetal variables or modify the existing one? Kindly help. BTW, did I mention the logcat shows nothing.

For instance to install Mechanize, I'm just supposed to put the Mechanize folder in C:\Python24\Lib\site-packages according to INSTALL.txt, but runnning the tests does not work. Can someone help shed some light on this? Thanks!

 jQuery will try to find an item with both the ID of content and the ID of Module, which is not what I am looking for. I should add that I am working with an old code base where these two word ids are used extensively, so going through and changing all the IDs would be bad.

@CONTENT:I was developing a web page, where I was laying out a board for a Chess-like game, along with a couple of piece trays. It's all done using HTML (with jQuery for dynamic updating as the game is played). Somewhere I'd got the notion that using absolute positioning of elements within a page was considered a bad practice, and that it was preferable to use relative positioning. After struggling with relative positioning for too long, I realized that absolute positioning of the board elements would be much, much easier to get right... and it was. Is anyone aware of a reason that relative positioning is preferable over absolute? Are there any guidelines or rules of thumb that you apply when deciding which approach to take?

@CONTENT:It appears that when you make an XMLHttpRequest from a script in a browser, if the browser is set to work offline or if the network cable is pulled out, the request completes with an error and with status = 0. 0 is not listed among permissible HTTP status codes. What does a status code of 0 mean? Does it mean the same thing across all browsers, and for all HTTP client utilities? Is it part of the HTTP spec or is it part of some other protocol spec? It seems to mean that the HTTP request could not be made at all, perhaps because the server address could not be resolved. What error message is appropriate to show the user? "Either you are not connected to the internet, or the website is encountering problems, or there might be a typing error in the address"? I should add to this that I see the behavior in FireFox when set to "Work Offline", but not in Microsoft Internet Explorer when set to "Work Offline". In IE, the user gets a dialog giving the option to go online. FireFox does not notify the user before returning the error. I am asking this in response to a request to "show a better error message". What Internet Explorer does is good. It tells the user what is causing the problem and gives them the option to fix it. In order to give an equivalent UX with FireFox I need to infer the cause of the problem and inform the user. So what in total can I infer from Status 0? Does it have a universal meaning or does it tell me nothing?

    fig.set_cmap('hot')
    fig.axes.get_xaxis().set_visible(False)

 It successfully removes the axis of the figure, but the figure saved presents a white padding and a frame around the actual image. How can I remove them (at least the white padding)? Thanks

@TITLE:MySQL: ALTER IGNORE TABLE gives ¡§Integrity constraint violation¡¨
@CONTENT:I'm trying to remove duplicates from a MySQL table using ALTER IGNORE TABLE + an UNIQUE KEY. The MySQL documentation says: IGNORE is a MySQL extension to standard SQL. It controls how ALTER TABLE works if there are duplicates on unique keys in the new table or if warnings occur when strict mode is enabled. If IGNORE is not specified, the copy is aborted and rolled back if duplicate-key errors occur. If IGNORE is specified, only the first row is used of rows with duplicates on a unique key. The other conflicting rows are deleted. Incorrect values are truncated to the closest matching acceptable value. When I run the query ... ALTER IGNORE TABLE table ADD UNIQUE INDEX dupidx (field)
 ... I still get the error #1062 - Duplicate entry 'blabla' for key 'dupidx'. Thx for your help!

@TITLE:JavaScript loop performance - Why is to decrement the iterator toward 0 faster than incrementing
@CONTENT:In his book Even Faster Web Sites Steve Sounders writes that a simple way to improve the performance of a loop is to decrement the iterator toward 0 rather than incrementing toward the total length (actually the chapter was written by Nicholas C. Zakas). This change can result in savings of up to 50% off the original execution time, depending on the complexity of each iteration. For example: var values = [1,2,3,4,5];
var length = values.length;

for (var i=length; i--;) {
   process(values[i]);
}
 This is nearly identical for the for loop, the do-while loop, and the while loop. I'm wondering, what's the reason for this? Why is to decrement the iterator so much faster? (I'm interested in the technical background of this and not in benchmarks proving this claim.) EDIT: At first sight the loop syntax used here looks wrong. There is no length-1 or i>=0, so let's clarify (I was confused too). Here is the general for loop syntax: for ([initial-expression]; [condition]; [final-expression])
   statement
 initial-expression - var i=length This variable declaration is evaluated first. condition - i-- This expression is evaluated before each loop iteration. It will decrement the variable before the first pass through the loop. If this expression evaluates to false the loop ends. In JavaScript is 0 == false so if i finally equals 0 it is interpreted as false and the loop ends. final-expression This expression is evaluated at the end of each loop iteration (before the next evaluation of condition). It's not needed here and is empty. All three expressions are optional in a for loop. The for loop syntax is not part of the question, but because it's a little bit uncommon I think it's interesting to clarify it. And maybe one reason it's faster is, because it uses less expressions (the 0 == false "trick").
@CODE:var values = [1,2,3,4,5];
var length = values.length;

for (var i=length; i--;) {
   process(values[i]);
} for do-while while length-1 i>=0 for ([initial-expression]; [condition]; [final-expression])
   statement var i=length i-- false 0 == false i 0 false 0 == false i-- i--

@TITLE:Updating nested arrays in mongodb
@CONTENT:I have a document in mongodb with 2 level deep nested array of objects that I need to update, something like this: {
    id: 1,
    items: [
        {
            id: 2,
            blocks: [
                {
                    id: 3

                }
            ]
        }
    ] 
}
 If there was only one level deep array I could use positional operator to update objects in it but for second level the only option I've came up is to use positional operator with nested object's index, like this: db.objects.update({'items.id': 2}, {'$set': {'items.$.blocks.0.txt': 'hi'}})
 This approach works but it seems dangerous to me since I'm building a web service and index number should come from client which can send say 100000 as index and this will force mongodb to create an array with 100000 indexes with null value. Are there any other ways to update such nested objects where I can refer to object's ID instead of it's position or maybe ways to check if supplied index is out of bounds before using it in query?
@CODE:{
    id: 1,
    items: [

@TITLE:Check for private API ¡§usage¡¨ yourself?
@CONTENT:So, we all know Apple forbids using private or undocumented APIs in iOS apps. I have no problem with this, as there are sound technical reasons for why this is a good idea. However, twice now I've had an app rejected for using private APIs, when this was not actually the case. It's not difficult -- the private APIs include symbols like connectionState, setThumbnail, setOrder and so on. Any calls you make to methods named as such will be flagged as a private API use, even if the method being called is something you have defined yourself. For a program doing something with connections, thumbnails or the order of things, the above mentioned method names aren't all that unlikely. Getting rejected for this and having to rename a method and resubmit delays everything by at least a week while you wait for a new review. So is there a way, using nm, class dumps of the iOS frameworks, etc to find out for yourself if your method names conflicts with anything in there? If so, we could have a chance of correcting this before release and avoiding unnecessary rejection.

@TITLE:How to write regular expressions in Objective C (NSRegularExpression)?
@CONTENT:I have this regex working when I test it in PHP but it doesn't work in Objective C: (?:www\.)?((?!-)[a-zA-Z0-9-]{2,63}(?<!-))\.?((?:[a-zA-Z0-9]{2,})?(?:\.[a-zA-Z0-9]{2,})?)
 I tried escaping the escape characters but that doesn't help either. Should I escape any other character? This is my code in Objective C: NSMutableString *searchedString = [NSMutableString stringWithString:@"domain-name.tld.tld2"];
NSError* error = nil;

NSRegularExpression* regex = [NSRegularExpression regularExpressionWithPattern:@"(?:www\\.)?((?!-)[a-zA-Z0-9-]{2,63}(?<!-))\\.?((?:[a-zA-Z0-9]{2,})?(?:\\.[a-zA-Z0-9]{2,})?)" options:0 error:&error];
NSArray* matches = [regex matchesInString:searchedString options:0 range:NSMakeRange(0, [searchedString length])];
for ( NSTextCheckingResult* match in matches )
{
    NSString* matchText = [searchedString substringWithRange:[match range]];
    NSLog(@"match: %@", matchText);
}
 -- UPDATE -- This regex returns (in PHP) the array with values "domain-name" and "tld.tld2" but in Objective C i get only one value: "domain-name.tld.tld2" -- UPDATE 2 -- This regex extracts 'domain name' and 'TLD' from the string: domain.com = (domain, com) domain.co.uk = (domain, co.uk) -test-domain.co.u = (test-domain, co) -test-domain.co.uk- = (test-domain, co.uk) -test-domain.co.u-k = (test-domain, co) -test-domain.co-m = (test-domain) -test-domain-.co.uk = (test-domain) it takes the valid domain name (not starting or ending with '-' and between 2 and 63 characters long), and up to two parts of a TLD if the parts are valid (at least two characters long containing only letters and numbers) Hope this explanation helps.

@LINK:/questions/5639870/simple-java-name-based-locks
@TITLE:Simple Java name based locks?
@CONTENT:MySQL has a handy function: SELECT GET_LOCK("SomeName")
 This can be used to create simple, but very specific, name based locks for an application. However, it requires a database connection. I have many situations like: someMethod() {
    // do stuff to user A for their data for feature X
}
 It doesn't make sense to simply synchronize this method, because, for example, if this method is called for user B in the meantime, user B does not need to wait for user A to finish before it starts, only operations for the user A and feature X combination need to wait. With the MySql lock I could do something like: someMethod() {
    executeQuery("SELECT GET_LOCK('userA-featureX')")
    // only locked for user A for their data for feature X
    executeQuery("SELECT RELEASE_LOCK('userA-featureX')")
}
 Since Java locking is based on objects, it seems like I would need to create a new object to represent the situation for this lock and then put it in a static cache somewhere so all the threads can see it. Subsequent requests to lock for that situation would then locate the lock object in the cache and acquire its lock. I tried to create something like this, but then the lock cache itself needs synchronization. Also, it is difficult to detect when a lock object is no longer being used so that it can be removed from the cache. I have looked at the Java concurrent packages, but nothing stands out as being able to handle something like this. Is there an easy way to implement this, or am I looking at this from the wrong perspective? Edit: To clarify, I am not looking to create a predefined pool of locks ahead of time, I would like to create them on demand. Some pseudo code for what I am thinking is: LockManager.acquireLock(String name) {
    Lock lock;  

    synchronized (map) {
        lock = map.get(name);

        // doesn't exist yet - create and store
        if(lock == null) {
            lock = new Lock();
            map.put(name, lock);
        }
    }

    lock.lock();
}

LockManager.releaseLock(String name) {
    // unlock
    // if this was the last hold on the lock, remove it from the cache
}
@CODE:SELECT GET_LOCK("SomeName") someMethod() {
    // do stuff to user A for their data for feature X
} someMethod() {
    executeQuery("SELECT GET_LOCK('userA-featureX')")
    // only locked for user A for their data for feature X
    executeQuery("SELECT RELEASE_LOCK('userA-featureX')")
} LockManager.acquireLock(String name) {
    Lock lock;  

    synchronized (map) {
        lock = map.get(name);

        // doesn't exist yet - create and store
        if(lock == null) {
            lock = new Lock();
            map.put(name, lock);
        }
    }

    lock.lock();
}

LockManager.releaseLock(String name) {
    // unlock
    // if this was the last hold on the lock, remove it from the cache

@CONTENT:I'm trying to understand how the order() function works in R. I was under the impression that it returned a permutation of indices, which when sorted, would sort the original vector. For instance, > a <- c(45,50,10,96)

[1] 3 1 2 4
 I would have expected this to return c(2, 3, 1, 4), since the list sorted would be 10 45 50 96. Can someone help me understand the return value of this function? Thank you.

@CONTENT:I've looked at a lot of tutorials for making a ListView have the alphabetical letters on the side (like the Contacts list), but they all seem to using a ListActivity class and/or data from a database while I'm just using a ListView (no special Activity) and an ArrayList of data.

Sorry for posting it something like 9 months overdue. class AlphabeticalAdapter extends ArrayAdapter<String> implements SectionIndexer

        ArrayList<String> sectionList = new ArrayList<String>(sectionLetters);
        Collections.sort(sectionList);

        for (int i = 0; i < sectionList.size(); i++)
            sections[i] = sectionList.get(i);

        return 0;
    }

    public Object[] getSections()
    {

}
 Edit : getSectionForPosition is important if you want your scroller appear in the right place while you are scrolling. Returning only 1 (or 0) tells that you are just scrolling in the first (or second) section which will result in scroller's wrong position (mostly goes out of screen). Added code returns the appropriate section so scroller can know where it actually is.

@TITLE:How to improve the Performance of FtpWebRequest?
@CONTENT:I have an application written in .NET 3.5 that uses FTP to upload/download files from a server. The app works fine but there are performance issues: It takes a lot of time to make connection to the FTP server. The FTP server is on a different network and has Windows 2003 Server (IIS FTP). When multiple files are queued for upload, the change from one file to another creates a new connection using FTPWebRequest and it takes a lot of time (around 8-10 seconds). Is is possible to re-use the connection? I am not very sure about the KeepAlive property. Which connections are kept alive and reused. The IIS-FTP on Windows Server 2003 does not support SSL so anyone can easily see the username/password through a packet sniffer such as WireShark. I found that windows Server 2008 supports SSL over FTP in its new version if IIS 7.0. I basically want to improve the upload/download performance of my application. Any ideas will be appreciated. ** Please note that 3 is not an issue but I would like people to have comments on it

@LINK:/questions/21641373/how-to-implement-uipageviewcontroller-that-utilizes-multiple-viewcontrollers
@TITLE:How to implement UIPageViewController that utilizes multiple ViewControllers
@CONTENT:I've been working on a simple test app to learn the ins and outs of the UIPageViewController. I have it working but I'm not convinced my execution is the best way. I hope some of you can point me in the right direction. To get a basic understanding I used this tutorial as a starting point. http://www.appcoda.com/uipageviewcontroller-storyboard-tutorial/ The tutorial creates an app that uses one viewController for each of the pages presented by the UIPageViewController. However I need to utilize the UIPageViewController to scroll thru pages that have completely different layouts. Therefore to take the tutorial a step further I created an master-detail application that uses the UIPageViewController in the detail view to display three different view controllers. I stuck with just displaying images and labels for this test app, but the app I am currently building has three viewControllers that will contain either a tableview, imageView and textViews, or some textFields. Here is the storyboard for my test app. I use the DetailViewController as the data source for the PageViewController. In viewDidLoad of the DVC I establish the labels and images that will be used in the three content view controllers firstViewController, secondViewController, and thirdViewController in this manner. if ([[self.detailItem description] isEqualToString:@"F14's"]) {
    //Here the page titles and images arrays are created 
    _pageTitles = @[@"Grim Reapers", @"Breakin the Barrier!", @"Top Gun"];
    _pageImages = @[@"F14_Grim.jpg", @"F14boom.jpg", @"F14_topgun.jpg"];

    //Here I call a method to instantiate the viewControllers 
    FirstController *selectedController = [self viewControllerAtIndex:0];
    SecondController *nextController = [self viewControllerAtIndex:1];
    ThirdController *lastController = [self viewControllerAtIndex:2];
    [_vc addObject:selectedController];
    [_vc addObject:nextController];
    [_vc addObject:lastController];
    _vc1 = @[selectedController];


} else if ([[self.detailItem description] isEqualToString:@"F35's"]){
    //code is above is repeated
 Below is the method to instantiate the viewControllers - (UIViewController *)viewControllerAtIndex:(NSUInteger)index
{
    if (([self.pageTitles count] == 0) || (index >= [self.pageTitles count])) {
        return nil;
    }

    // Create a new view controller and pass suitable data.
    if (index == 0) {
        FirstController *fvc = [self.storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@"FirstPageController"];
        fvc.imageFile = self.pageImages[index];
        fvc.titleText = self.pageTitles[index];
        fvc.pageIndex = index;
        if ([_vc count]) {
             //Here I have to replace the viewController each time it is recreated
             [_vc replaceObjectAtIndex:0 withObject:fvc];
        }
        return fvc;
    } else if (index == 1) {
//Code is repeated for remaining viewControllers
 The code in viewDidLoad is one area I feel I am doing unnecassary work. I don't believe I need to instantiate all three view controllers upon loading the DVC, but I didn't know how else to provide an array for the UIPageViewControllerDataSource protocol methods (viewControllerBeforeViewController and viewControllerAfterViewController). Here is the viewControllerBefore.. method. - (UIViewController *)pageViewController:(UIPageViewController *)pageViewController viewControllerBeforeViewController:(UIViewController *)viewController
{

    NSUInteger index = [_vc indexOfObject:viewController];

    if ((index == 0) || (index == NSNotFound)) {
        return nil;
    }

    index--;

    //notice here I call my instantiation method again essentially duplicating work I have already done!
    return [self viewControllerAtIndex:index];
}
 In summary it seems that I am unnecassarily recreating the view controllers with every swipe from from one page to another. Is this just how the pageViewController works or have I way over complicated the process. Any input would be great! SOLUTION Matt suggested an incredibly simple solution in using identifiers. In my Storyboard i simply checked the box that uses my already implemented Storyboard identifier as the Restoration Identifier Then in viewDidLoad rather than creating an array of viewControllers, simply create an array of strings that match the restoration identifiers. if ([[self.detailItem description] isEqualToString:@"F14's"]) {
    _pageTitles = @[@"Grim Reapers", @"Breakin the Barrier!", @"Top Gun"];
    _pageImages = @[@"F14_Grim.jpg", @"F14boom.jpg", @"F14_topgun.jpg"];
    FirstController *selectedController = [self viewControllerAtIndex:0];
    [_vc addObject:@"FirstPageController"];
    [_vc addObject:@"SecondPageController"];
    [_vc addObject:@"ThirdPageController"];
    _vc1 = @[selectedController];
 Finally to determine the index in the delegate methods do this rather than what I was doing before: NSString * ident = viewController.restorationIdentifier;
NSUInteger index = [_vc indexOfObject:ident];
 It now works without having to unnecessarily instantiate the view controllers. As a last note if anyone is using exactly what I have here you can get rid of the following snippet from the viewControllerAtIndex: method. if ([_vc count]) {
     //Here I have to replace the viewController each time it is recreated
     [_vc replaceObjectAtIndex:0 withObject:fvc];
}

@TITLE:Alternative to regex: match all instances not inside quotes
@CONTENT:From this q/a, I deduced that matching all instances of a given regex not inside quotes, is impossible. That is, it can't match escaped quotes (ex: "this whole \"match\" should be taken"). If there is a way to do it that I don't know about, that would solve my problem. If not, however, I'd like to know if there is any efficient alternative that could be used in JavaScript. I've thought about it a bit, but can't come with any elegant solutions that would work in most, if not all, cases. Specifically, I just need the alternative to work with .split() and .replace() methods, but if it could be more generalized, that would be the best. For Example: An input string of: +bar+baz"not+or\"+or+\"this+"foo+bar+ replacing + with #, not inside quotes, would return: #bar#baz"not+or\"+or+\"this+"foo#bar#
@CODE:"this whole \"match\" should be taken" +bar+baz"not+or\"+or+\"this+"foo+bar+ #bar#baz"not+or\"+or+\"this+"foo#bar#

@TITLE:Is it possible, in principle, for an Android device to interface with an iPhone over Bluetooth/GameKit?
@CONTENT:(I am not interested in pure theory, but as a practical near or mid-term possibility, say within 12-24 months.) As a developer familiar with (but not specializing in) two major smartphone platforms, should I expect an Android library to come out which can spoof itself onto an iPhone app's GameKit-based network. It seems reasonable that a Bluetooth interface between platforms might square the opportunity to make useful applications, in the same way that modems benefited PC/Mac platforms via Metcalfe's Law. I am looking for one of two answers: Is this obviously not likely (e.g. because of encryption)? If so, what is the reason? Is it possible in principle, but requiring years of reverse-engineering (like SMB/CIFS/Samba)? Or is it a no-brainer and just a matter of time? Please give evidence supporting your reason. Is there an alternative way to have direct peer-to-peer networking besides GameKit? For example, a hand-rolled network using Bluetooth or ad-hoc WiFi? It would be nice to spoof an Android device into an existing iPhone app but my main question is, can the devices speak with each other at all!

@TITLE:PHP exec() as Background Process (Windows Wampserver Environment)
@CONTENT:I'm trying to setup a php trigger file that will set off a background process. (see this question) I'm doing this on a Windows Wampserver environment. So for example I have trigger.php that runs the exec function that calls for my backgroundProcess.php to be parsed and executed. However the problem is that my trigger.php file is waiting for the exec() command to finish running backgroundProcess.php before it stops. The background process runs for about 20-30 seconds, and trigger.php is waiting all that time until backgroundProcess.php has fully finished. Is that making sense? Here is the trigger.php file that runs the exec() command exec('C:\wamp\bin\php\php'.phpversion().'\php.exe -f C:\path\to\backgroundProcess.php > C:\wamp\bin\php\php'.phpversion().'\dev\null &');
 Basically, I'm wanting trigger.php to just trigger off the backgroundProcess and not wait around for it to finish. EDIT Problem solved with the following command: $WshShell = new COM("WScript.Shell");
$oExec = $WshShell->Run("C:\wamp\bin\php\phpVERSIONNUMBER\php-win.exe -f C:/wamp/www/path/to/backgroundProcess.php", 0, false);

@CONTENT:I've been a PHP developer but recently need to work on some project using Google App Engine (Java). In PHP I can do something like this (in term of MVC model): // controllers/accounts.php
$accounts = getAccounts();
include "../views/accounts.php";

// views/accounts.php
print_r($accounts);
 I take a look at some demos of Google App Engine Java using Servlet and JSP. What they're doing is this: // In AccountsServlet.java
public class AccountsServlet extends HttpServlet {

  @Override
  protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp) throws ServletException, IOException {
    String action = req.getParameter("accountid");
    // do something
    // REDIRECT to an JSP page, manually passing QUERYSTRING along.
    resp.sendRedirect("/namedcounter.jsp?name=" + req.getParameter("name"));
  }
}
 Basically in the Java case it's 2 different HTTP requests (the second one being automatically forced), right? So in JSP file I can't make use of the data calculated in the Servlet. Is there some way I can do it similar to the PHP way?

@TITLE:Hosting CLR in Delphi with/without JCL - example
@CONTENT:Can somebody please post here an example how to host CLR in Delphi? I have read similar question here but I cannot use JCL as I want to host it in Delphi 5. Thank you. EDIT: This article about hosting CLR in Fox Pro looks promising but I don't know how to access clrhost.dll from Delphi. Edit 2: I give up on Delphi 5 requirement. Now I'm trying JCL with Delphi 7. But again I am unable to find any example. Here is what I have till now: My C# assemply: namespace DelphiNET
{
    public class NETAdder
    {
        public int Add3(int left)
        {
            return left + 3;
        }
    }
}
 I have compiled it to DelphiNET.dll. Now I want to use this assemply from Delphi: uses JclDotNet, mscorlib_TLB;

procedure TForm1.Button1Click(Sender: TObject);
var
  clr: TJclClrHost;
  ads: TJclClrAppDomainSetup;
  ad: TJclClrAppDomain;
  ass: TJclClrAssembly;
  obj: _ObjectHandle;
  ov: OleVariant;
begin
  clr := TJclClrHost.Create();
  clr.Start;
  ads := clr.CreateDomainSetup;
  ads.ApplicationBase := 'C:\Delhi.NET';
  ads.ConfigurationFile := 'C:\Delhi.NET\my.config';
  ad := clr.CreateAppDomain('myNET', ads);
  obj := (ad as _AppDomain).CreateInstanceFrom('DelphiNET.dll', 'DelphiNET.NETAdder');
  ov := obj.Unwrap;
  Button1.Caption := 'done ' + string(ov.Add3(5));
end;
 This ends with error: EOleError: Variant does not reference an automation object I have not worked with Delphi for a long time so I am stuck here... Solution: There was problem in COM visibility which is not by default. This is the correct .NET assembly: namespace DelphiNET
{
    [ComVisible(true)]
    public class NETAdder
    {
        public int Add3(int left)
        {
            return left + 3;
        }
    }
}
 Important note: When working with .NET from Delphi, it is important calling Set8087CW($133F); at the begining of your program (i.e. before Application.Initialize;). Delphi has enabled floating point exceptions by default (see this) and the CLR doesn¡¦t like them. When I had them enabled, my program weirdly freezed.
@CODE:namespace DelphiNET
{
    public class NETAdder
    {
        public int Add3(int left)
        {
            return left + 3;
        }
    }
} DelphiNET.dll uses JclDotNet, mscorlib_TLB;

@TITLE:Automatic clean and SEO friendly URL (slugs)
@CONTENT:Definition From Wikipedia: A slug is the part of a URL which identifies a page using human-readable keywords. To make the URL easier for users to type, special characters are often removed or replaced as well. For instance, accented characters are usually replaced by letters from the English alphabet; punctuation marks are generally removed; and spaces (which have to be encoded as %20 or +) are replaced by dashes (-) or underscores (_), which are more aesthetically pleasing. Context I developed a photo-sharing website on which users can upload, share and view photos. All pages are generated automatically without my grip on the title. Because the title of a photo or the name of a user may contain accented characters or spaces, I needed a function to automatically create slugs and keep readable URLs. I created the following function which replaces accented characters (??????), removes punctuation and bad characters (#@&~^!) and transforms spaces in dashes. Questions What do you think about this function? Do you know any other functions to create slugs? Code php: function sluggable($str) {

????$before = array(
        '?????????????????????????????',
        '/[^a-z0-9\s]/',
????????array('/\s/', '/--+/', '/---+/')
????);
?
????$after = array(
        'aaaaaaooooooeeeeeciiiiuuuunsz',
        '',
        '-'
    );

????$str = strtolower($str);
????$str = strtr($str, $before[0], $after[0]);
????$str = preg_replace($before[1], $after[1], $str);
????$str = trim($str);
????$str = preg_replace($before[2], $after[2], $str);
?
????return $str;

@LINK:/questions/20530152/need-help-deciding-between-httpclient-and-webclient
@TITLE:Need help deciding between HttpClient and WebClient
@CONTENT:Our web app is running in .Net Framework 4.0. The UI calls controller methods through ajax calls. We need to consume REST service from our vendor. I am evaluating the best way to call REST service in .Net 4.0. The REST service requires Basic Authentication Scheme and it can return data in both XML and JSON. There is no requirement for uploading/downloading huge data and I don't see anything in future. I took a look at few open source code projects for REST consumption and didn't find any value in those to justify additional dependency in the project. Started to evaluate WebClient and HttpClient. I downloaded HttpClient for .Net 4.0 from NuGet. I searched for differences between WebClient and HttpClient and this site mentioned that single HttpClient can handle concurrent calls and it can reuse resolved DNS, cookie config and authentication. I am yet to see practical values that we may gain due to the differences. I did a quick performance test to find how WebClient (sync calls), HttpClient (sync and async) perform. and here are the results: Using same HttpClient instance for all the requests (min - max) WebClient sync: 8 ms - 167 ms HttpClient sync: 3 ms - 7228 ms HttpClient async: 985 - 10405 ms Using a new HttpClient for each request (min - max) WebClient sync: 4 ms - 297 ms HttpClient sync: 3 ms - 7953 ms HttpClient async: 1027 - 10834 ms Code public class AHNData

 My Questions The REST calls return in 3-4s which is acceptable. Calls to REST service are initiated in controller methods which gets invoked from ajax calls. To begin with, the calls run in a different thread and doesn't block UI. So, can I just stick with sync calls? The above code was run in my localbox. In prod setup, DNS and proxy lookup will be involved. Is there any advantage of using HttpClient over WebClient? Is HttpClient concurrency better than WebClient ? From the test results, I see WebClient sync calls perform better. Will HttpClient be a better design choice if we upgrade to .Net 4.5? Performance is the key design factor.

@TITLE:Undo changes in entity framework entities
@CONTENT:this might be a trivial question but: Since ADO.NET entity framework automatically tracks changes (in generated entities) and therefore keeps the original values, how can I rollback changes made to the entity objects? I have a form which allows the user to edit a set of "Customer" entities in a grid view. Now I have two buttons "Accept" and "Revert": if "Accept" is clicked, I call Context.SaveChanges() and the changed objects are written back to the database. If "Revert" is clicked, I would like for all objects to get their original property values. What would be the code for that? Thanks

@TITLE:Spinner does not wrap text ¡X is this an Android bug?
@CONTENT:If the text of a Spinner item is too long to fit into a single line, the text is not wrapped but cut off. This is only the case for API level >= 11. Here are screenshots of Android 4.2.2 (left) which shows the wrong behavior and Android 2.3.3 (right) where it looks as expected. android:singleLine="false" simply gets ignored here. So as all other tries like android:lines, android:minLines, etc. The TextView somehow seems to be much wider than the window width. I saw other people having the same problem, but no one could find a solution. So, is this a system bug? I don't think this inconsistency between the OS versions can be intended. Please note: There were some answers suggesting relatively simple solutions. Writing a custom Adapter and overriding getView() as well as getDropDownView(). This is not the solution here, because at this point, there is still the original problem: How does the layout have to look like to handle proper line wrapping? Wrapping the TextView of the drop down view into a parent ViewGroup. Does not work with android:layout_width="match_parent" because the width of the parent strangely seems to be unlimited. Giving the drop down view a fixed width. This is not suitable with the different widths the Spinner can have. And of course, no solution is to manually insert \ns anywhere into the text.

 This has stumped me, and any coworkers I've bugged for more than a day now. Just to cull the answers, for now at least, third party solutions to this are probably out due to licensing restrictions and company policies (e.g.: tools for creating exe's or packaging up jars). The ultimate goal is to create a jar that can be copied from my development Windows box to a Linux server (with any dependent jars) and used to populate a database (so classpaths may wind up being different between development and deployment environments). Any clues to this mystery would be greatly appreciated!

@TITLE:How to get an X11 Window from a Process ID?
@CONTENT:Under Linux, my C++ application is using fork() and execv() to launch multiple instances of OpenOffice so as to view some powerpoint slide shows. This part works. Next I want to be able to move the OpenOffice windows to specific locations on the display. I can do that with the XMoveResizeWindow() function but I need to find the Window for each instance. I have the process ID of each instance, how can I find the X11 Window from that ? UPDATE - Thanks to Andy's suggestion, I have pulled this off. I'm posting the code here to share it with the Stack Overflow community.

@LINK:/questions/13886338/use-of-floating-point-in-the-linux-kernel
@TITLE:Use of floating point in the Linux kernel
@CONTENT:I am reading Robert Love's "Linux Kernel Development", and I came across the following passage: No (Easy) Use of Floating Point When a user-space process uses floating-point instructions, the kernel manages the transition from integer to floating point mode. What the kernel has to do when using floating-point instructions varies by architecture, but the kernel normally catches a trap and then initiates the transition from integer to floating point mode. Unlike user-space, the kernel does not have the luxury of seamless support for floating point because it cannot easily trap itself. Using a floating point inside the kernel requires manually saving and restoring the floating point registers, among other possible chores. The short answer is: Don¡¦t do it! Except in the rare cases, no floating-point operations are in the kernel. I've never heard of these "integer" and "floating-point" modes. What exactly are they, and why are they needed? Does this distinction exist on mainstream hardware architectures (such as x86), or is it specific to some more exotic environments? What exactly does a transition from integer to floating point mode entail, both from the point of view of the process and the kernel?

 I know this is similar to other questions (such as this one), but in my case, the answer of "don't worry about it" won't be sufficient, as it is causing problems for me. I have CI server which regularly updates this application, and after 6-10 reloads, the CI server will hang because Tomcat is out of memory. I need to be able to clear up these orphaned threads so I can run my CI server more reliably. Any help would be appreciated!

@TITLE:Core-Data iPhone: could not locate an NSManagedObjectModel
@CONTENT:I am using Apple's CoreDataBooks sample project as a learning aid for core data. I modified the app so that when the app loads I show a menu page first - not the Books tableview (RootViewController). I have done the following: I created a menu page in interface builder (just a view with a button on it) The CoreDataBooksAppDelegate.h now looks like this: // for the menu
@class MenuViewController;

@interface CoreDataBooksAppDelegate : NSObject <UIApplicationDelegate> {

NSManagedObjectModel *managedObjectModel;
NSManagedObjectContext *managedObjectContext;     
NSPersistentStoreCoordinator *persistentStoreCoordinator;

UIWindow *window;
UINavigationController *navigationController;

MenuViewController *viewController;
}

@property (nonatomic, readonly) NSString *applicationDocumentsDirectory;

@property (nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet UIWindow *window;
@property (nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet UINavigationController *navigationController;

@end
 The CoreDataBooksAppDelegate.m looks like this: #import "CoreDataBooksAppDelegate.h"
#import "RootViewController.h"
// for the menu
#import "MenuViewController.h"


@implementation CoreDataBooksAppDelegate

@synthesize window;
@synthesize navigationController;

// for the menu
@synthesize viewController;


#pragma mark -

- (void)applicationDidFinishLaunching:(UIApplication *)application {

RootViewController *rootViewController = (RootViewController   *)[navigationController  topViewController];
rootViewController.managedObjectContext = self.managedObjectContext;

// for the menu
[window addSubview:viewController.view];

// Configure and show the window
[window makeKeyAndVisible];
}
 The rest of CoreDataAppDelegete.m remains unchanged. In the MenuViewController when the button is clicked, the following action takes place: RootViewController *modalViewController1 = [[[RootViewController alloc] initWithNibName:nil bundle:nil] autorelease];  
[self presentModalViewController:modalViewController1 animated:YES];
 In IB I changed the MainWindow.xib to call the MenuViewController rather than the RootViewController. So, the app loads and the menu is displayed properly with the button. Upon clicking the button the application crashes inside of the RootViewController's viewDidLoad. It crashes right here: - (void)viewDidLoad {
[super viewDidLoad];
NSLog(@"1 START viewDidLoad RootViewController");
self.title = @"Books";
// Set up the edit and add buttons.
self.navigationItem.leftBarButtonItem = self.editButtonItem;

NSLog(@"2 setup button viewDidLoad RootViewController");
// Configure the add button.
UIBarButtonItem *addButton = [[UIBarButtonItem alloc]   initWithBarButtonSystemItem:UIBarButtonSystemItemAdd target:self   action:@selector(addBook)];
self.navigationItem.rightBarButtonItem = addButton;
[addButton release];  

NSLog(@"3 viewDidLoad RootViewController");

  // Update to handle the error appropriately.
  NSLog(@"Unresolved error %@, %@", error, [error userInfo]);
  abort();  // Fail
 }
 NSLog(@"END viewDidLoad RootViewController");
}
 In the console I receive the following: Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInternalInconsistencyException', reason: '+entityForName: could not locate an NSManagedObjectModel for entity name 'Book''
 I have read about this exception but I do not know the proper steps to resolve it. Any help would be appreciated. Thank-you for your time, Vivas

@TITLE:How can I pass data from Python (Flask framework) to Javascript?
@CONTENT:I am using Flask for a small personal project. Said project makes a call to an API that then returns a dictionary. I want to pass information from this dict to Javascript in the view. I am using the Google Maps API in the JS, specifically, so I'd like to pass it a list of tuples with the long/lat information. Below is some example code. from flask import Flask
from flask import render_template
app = Flask(__name__)

import foo_api

api = foo_api.API('API KEY')

@app.route('/')
def get_data():
    events = api.call(get_event, arg0, arg1)
    geocode = event['latitude'], event['longitude']
    return render_template('get_data.html', geocode=geocode)
 I know that render_template will pass these variables to the view so they can be used in HTML, but how could I pass them to javascript in the view?
@CODE:from flask import Flask
from flask import render_template
app = Flask(__name__)

import foo_api

@TITLE:What is GIT_WORK_TREE, why have I never needed to set this ENV var, why now?
@CONTENT:I'm using Git under Ubuntu Linux to sync and deploy my projects. I have Repo on my local Linux working machine and two repos on my server, one bare repo and the one as a deployed app. It always worked fine, but now I created another repo for my other website and now I get this error: root@vserver5:/var/www/ninethsky# git pull origin master
fatal: /usr/lib/git-core/git-pull cannot be used without a working tree.
 So I have to set a GIT_WORKING_TREE ENV-Var, but what is this exactly, where to set it? This is my repo's .git/config: [core]
        repositoryformatversion = 0
        filemode = true
        bare = false
        logallrefupdates = true
[remote "origin"]
        url = /home/git/ninethsky/.git
        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
 There is another repo with bare = true and a repo on my local working machine. Then I removed all the repos, but the initial one, now I get: root@vserver5:/var/www/ninethsky# git init
fatal: GIT_WORK_TREE (or --work-tree=<directory>) not allowed without specifying GIT_DIR (or --git-dir=<directory>)
root@vserver5:/var/www/ninethsky# git init --git-dir=/var/www/ninethsky

 I solved the git init problem by unsetting GIT_WORK_TREE, which was set to blank. GIT_WORK_TREE and GIT_DIR are unset. git init works again, still there is a problem with git add . and so on when it comes to git actions in the cloned repo, which was set to bare. Thanks, Joern.

@TITLE:MongoDB aggregation comparison: group(), $group and MapReduce
@CONTENT:I am somewhat confused about when to use group(), aggregate with $group or mapreduce. I read the documentation at http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Aggregation for group(), http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/aggregation/group/#_S_group for $group.. Is sharding the only situation where group() won't work? Also, I get this feeling that $group is more powerful than group() because it can be used in conjunction with other pipeline operators from aggregation framework.. How does $group compare with mapreduce? I read somewhere that it doesn't generate any temporary collection whereas mapreduce does. Is that so? Can someone present an illustration or guide me to a link where these three concepts are explained together, taking the same sample data, so I can compare them easily? EDIT: Also, it would be great if you can point out anything new specifically in these commands since the new 2.2 release came out.. Thanks in advance! :)

@TITLE:Using Hibernate's ScrollableResults to slowly read 90 million records
@CONTENT:I simply need to read each row in a table in my MySQL database using Hibernate and write a file based on it. But there are 90 million rows and they are pretty big. So it seemed like the following would be appropriate: ScrollableResults results = session.createQuery("SELECT person FROM Person person")
            .setReadOnly(true).setCacheable(false).scroll(ScrollMode.FORWARD_ONLY);
while (results.next())
    storeInFile(results.get()[0]);
 The problem is the above will try and load all 90 million rows into RAM before moving on to the while loop... and that will kill my memory with OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space exceptions :(. So I guess ScrollableResults isn't what I was looking for? What is the proper way to handle this? I don't mind if this while loop takes days (well I'd love it to not). I guess the only other way to handle this is to use setFirstResult and setMaxResults to iterate through the results and just use regular Hibernate results instead of ScrollableResults. That feels like it will be inefficient though and will start taking a ridiculously long time when I'm calling setFirstResult on the 89 millionth row... UPDATE: setFirstResult/setMaxResults doesn't work, it turns out to take an unusably long time to get to the offsets like I feared. There must be a solution here! Isn't this a pretty standard procedure?? I'm willing to forgo Hibernate and use JDBC or whatever it takes. UPDATE 2: the solution I've come up with which works ok, not great, is basically of the form: select * from person where id > <offset> and <other_conditions> limit 1
 Since I have other conditions, even all in an index, it's still not as fast as I'd like it to be... so still open for other suggestions..
@CODE:ScrollableResults results = session.createQuery("SELECT person FROM Person person")
            .setReadOnly(true).setCacheable(false).scroll(ScrollMode.FORWARD_ONLY);
while (results.next())

However, I've tried both relative and absolute paths to the image, and I still get a broken image icon displayed in the Web page. For example, if I have an image in my home directory and use this tag in my template: <img src="/home/tony/london.jpg" />
 The image doesn't display. If I save the Web page as a static HTML file, however, the images display, so the path is correct. Maybe the default Web server that comes with Django will display images only if they're on a particular path?

        when('/login', { templateUrl: 'views/login.html', controller: PageStartCtrl.Controller }).
        otherwise({ redirectTo: '/login' });

 So the only thing user can do is to log in. After the user logs in, I would like to register additional routes like this: $http
  .post('api/Users/Login', {   User: userName, Password: userPassword })
  .success(function (response : any) {

  });
 However, I suppose I should call .config method only once, because the $routeProvider is brand new instance that knows nothing about /login route.

 When you run this in IE7 you'll see that the "footer" element stays after modifying the CSS for "panel". The same example tested in IE8, FF and Chrome behaves exactly as expected. I've already tried updating the element's class but this does not work if the browser's window has been opened maximized and no further size changes were made to the window (which is about 90% of the use cases we have for our product.... :( ) I'm stuck with a CSS-based solution however I think that I can make an exception in this case if it can easily be made IE7-specific (which means that other browsers will behave in a standard way with this). Please help!

@LINK:/questions/282176/waitpid-equivalent-with-timeout
@TITLE:Waitpid equivalent with timeout?
@CONTENT:Imagine I have a process that starts several child processes. The parent needs to know when a child exits. I can use waitpid, but then if/when the parent needs to exit I have no way of telling the thread that is blocked in waitpid to exit gracefully and join it. It's nice to have things clean up themselves, but it may not be that big of a deal. I can use waitpid with WNOHANG, and then sleep for some arbitrary time to prevent a busy wait. However then I can only know if a child has exited every so often. In my case it may not be super critical that I know when a child exits right away, but I'd like to know ASAP... I can use a signal handler for SIGCHLD, and in the signal handler do whatever I was going to do when a child exits, or send a message to a different thread to do some action. But using a signal handler obfuscates the flow of the code a little bit. What I'd really like to do is use waitpid on some timeout, say 5 sec. Since exiting the process isn't a time critical operation, I can lazily signal the thread to exit, while still having it blocked in waitpid the rest of the time, always ready to react. Is there such a call in linux? Of the alternatives, which one is best? EDIT: Another method based on the replies would be to block SIGCHLD in all threads with pthread \ _sigmask(). Then in one thread, keep calling sigtimedwait() while looking for SIGCHLD. This means that I can time out on that call and check whether the thread should exit, and if not, remain blocked waiting for the signal. Once a SIGCHLD is delivered to this thread, we can react to it immediately, and in line of the wait thread, without using a signal handler.

@TITLE:Stemmers vs Lemmatizers
@CONTENT:Natural Language Processing (NLP), especially for English, has evolved into the stage where stemming would become an archaic technology if "perfect" lemmatizers exist. It's because stemmers change the surface form of a word/token into some meaningless stems. Then again the definition of the "perfect" lemmatizer is questionable because different NLP task would have required different level of lemmatization. E.g. Convert words between verb/noun/adjective forms. Stemmers [in]: having
[out]: hav
 Lemmatizers [in]: having
[out]: have
 So the question is, are English stemmers any useful at all today? Since we have a plethora of lemmatization tools for English If not, then how should we move on to build robust lemmatizers that can take on nounify, verbify, adjectify and adverbify preprocesses? How could the lemmatization task be easily scaled to other languages that have similar morphological structures as English?

@TITLE:Can't assign multiple Buttons to UINavigationItem when using Storyboard with iOS 5
@CONTENT:I'm a iOS developer with a lot experience in developing the UI by code. I'm now testing the Storyboard functionality, because I testing to switch to "design" the UI rather then implementing it. In the past I stuck with to much limits using nib/xib's and therefore I never succeed with the switch. So here comes a new try with storyboading :) Now my question - I'm designing an iPad Storyboard which has a Navigation Controller and a Tableview Controller. I want to add multiple UIBarButtonItems, but I can just add one for each side with the Interface Builder. The code would look like: UIBarButtonItem *b = [[UIBarButtonItem alloc] initWithBarButtonSystemItem:UIBarButtonSystemItemBookmarks target:nil action:nil];

UIBarButtonItem *spacer = [[UIBarButtonItem alloc] initWithBarButtonSystemItem:UIBarButtonSystemItemFixedSpace target:nil action:nil];
spacer.width = 20;

self.navigationItem.rightBarButtonItems = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:self.editButtonItem, spacer, b, nil];
 But why can't I add multiple buttons using the IB? There are only outlets for leftBarButtonItem, rightBarButtonItems, backBarButtonItems... This is driving me crazy??? Thanks!

Well, after googling, I was trying to setup an alarm and then forcing later the app to exit with exit(0);
 My bad, apple seems not to like this and prevent developer from using it... I guess I'm not pointing in the right direction. Finally despite all the problem I could meet I would like to discuss about that. Any hints ? Thanks ! G ===================EDIT, infos from APPLE============================================ In general, you should not change the iOS system language (via use of the AppleLanguages pref key) from within your application. This goes against the basic iOS user model for switching languages in the Settings app, and also uses a preference key that is not documented, meaning that at some point in the future, the key name could change, which would break your application. If you want to switch languages in your application, you can do so via manually loading resource files in your bundle. You can use NSBundle:pathForResource:ofType:inDirectory:forLocalization: for this purpose, but keep in mind that your application would be responsible for all loading of localized data. Regarding the exit(0) question, Apple DTS cannot comment on the app approval process. You should contact appreview@apple.com to get an answer for this question. Well, I have to choose sofar.

Like every other WYSIWYG editor, this one too overlays an iframe over an existing textbox. And serialize ignores the iframe and looks only into the textbox for content, which, of course, it doesn't find, thus returning a blank content body. My approach to this is to create a hook onto the onchange event of CKEditor and concurrently update the textbox (CKEDITOR.instances.[textboxname].getData() returns the content) or some other hidden field with any changes made in the editor. However, since CKEditor is still in it's beta stage and severely lacks documentation, I can't find a suitable API call that'll enable me to do so. Does anyone have any idea on how to go about this?

@TITLE:More efficient way to handle $(window).scroll functions in jquery?
@CONTENT:In the code below, I'm checking to see if the window is being scrolled past a certain point and if it is, change an element to use fixed position so that it doesn't scroll off the top of the page. The only problem is that is seems to be HIGHLY client-side-memory intensive (and really bogs down the scrolling speed) because at every single scroll pixel I am updating the style attributes over and over on the element. Would checking if the attr is already there before attempting to update it make a significant difference? Is there a completely different and more efficient practice to get the same result? $(window).scroll(function () {
    var headerBottom = 165;
    var fcHeight = $("#pnlMainNavContainer").height();

    var ScrollTop = $(window).scrollTop();
    if (ScrollTop > headerBottom) {
        $("#HeaderContentBuffer").attr("style", "margin-top:" + (fcHeight) + "px;");
        $("#AddFieldsContainer").attr("style", "position:fixed;width:320px;top:70px;left:41px;");
    } else {
        $("#HeaderContentBuffer").attr("style", "margin-top: 0px;");
        $("#AddFieldsContainer").removeAttr("style");
    }
});
 As I'm typing this, I notice that StackOverflow.com using the same type of functionality with their yellow "Similar Questions" and "Help" menus on the right hand side of this page. I wonder how they do it.
@CODE:$(window).scroll(function () {
    var headerBottom = 165;
    var fcHeight = $("#pnlMainNavContainer").height();

    var ScrollTop = $(window).scrollTop();
    if (ScrollTop > headerBottom) {
        $("#HeaderContentBuffer").attr("style", "margin-top:" + (fcHeight) + "px;");
        $("#AddFieldsContainer").attr("style", "position:fixed;width:320px;top:70px;left:41px;");

@TITLE:Getting the battery current values for the Android Phone
@CONTENT:I am trying to collect power usage statistics for the Android G1 Phone. I am interested in knowing the values of Voltage and Current, and then able to collect statistics as reported in this PDF. I am able to get the value of Battery voltage through registering for an intent receiver to receive the Broadcast for ACTION_BATTERY_CHANGED. But the problem is that Android does not expose the value of current through this SDK interface. One way I tried is via sysfs interface, where I can view the battery current value from adb shell, using the following command $cat /sys/class/power_supply/battery/batt_current
449 
 But that too works only if the phone is connected via USB interface. If I disconnect the phone, I see the value of batt_current as '0'. I am not sure why the value of current reported is zero. It should be more than zero, right? Any suggestion / pointers for getting battery current value? Also please correct me if I am wrong.

@TITLE:Computing x,y coordinate (3D) from image point
@CONTENT:I have a task to locate an object in 3D coordinate system. Since I have to get almost exact X and Y coordinate, I decided to track one color marker with known Z coordinate that will be placed on the top of the moving object, like the orange ball in this picture: First, I have done the camera calibration to get intrinsic parameters and after that I used cv::solvePnP to get rotation and translation vector like in this following code: std::vector<cv::Point2f> imagePoints;
std::vector<cv::Point3f> objectPoints;
//img points are green dots in the picture
imagePoints.push_back(cv::Point2f(271.,109.));
imagePoints.push_back(cv::Point2f(65.,208.));
imagePoints.push_back(cv::Point2f(334.,459.));
imagePoints.push_back(cv::Point2f(600.,225.));

//object points are measured in millimeters because calibration is done in mm also
objectPoints.push_back(cv::Point3f(0., 0., 0.));
objectPoints.push_back(cv::Point3f(-511.,2181.,0.));
objectPoints.push_back(cv::Point3f(-3574.,2354.,0.));
objectPoints.push_back(cv::Point3f(-3400.,0.,0.));

cv::Mat rvec(1,3,cv::DataType<double>::type);
cv::Mat tvec(1,3,cv::DataType<double>::type);
cv::Mat rotationMatrix(3,3,cv::DataType<double>::type);

cv::solvePnP(objectPoints, imagePoints, cameraMatrix, distCoeffs, rvec, tvec);
cv::Rodrigues(rvec,rotationMatrix);
 After having all matrices, this equation that can help me with transforming image point to wolrd coordinates: where M is cameraMatrix, R - rotationMatrix, t - tvec, and s is an unknown. Zconst represents the height where the orange ball is, in this example it is 285 mm. So, first I need to solve previous equation, to get "s", and after I can find out X and Y coordinate by selecting image point: Solving this I can find out variable "s", using the last row in matrices, because Zconst is known, so here is the following code for that: cv::Mat uvPoint = cv::Mat::ones(3,1,cv::DataType<double>::type); //u,v,1
uvPoint.at<double>(0,0) = 363.; //got this point using mouse callback
uvPoint.at<double>(1,0) = 222.;
cv::Mat tempMat, tempMat2;
double s;
tempMat = rotationMatrix.inv() * cameraMatrix.inv() * uvPoint;
tempMat2 = rotationMatrix.inv() * tvec;
s = 285 + tempMat2.at<double>(2,0); //285 represents the height Zconst
s /= tempMat.at<double>(2,0);
std::cout << "P = " << rotationMatrix.inv() * (s * cameraMatrix.inv() * uvPoint - tvec) << std::endl;
 After this, I got result: P = [-2629.5, 1272.6, 285.] and when I compare it to measuring, which is: Preal = [-2629.6, 1269.5, 285.] the error is very small which is very good, but when I move this box to the edges of this room, errors are maybe 20-40mm and I would like to improve that. Can anyone help me with that, do you have any suggestions?

@TITLE:Full screen videoview without stretching the video
@CONTENT:I wonder if I can get a way to let video run via videoview in full screen? I searched a lot and tried many ways such as: Apply theme in manifest: android:theme="@android:style/Theme.NoTitleBar.Fullscreen"
 but that does not force the video to be in full screen. Apply in activity itself: requestWindowFeature(Window.FEATURE_NO_TITLE);  
getWindow().setFlags(WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_FULLSCREEN,  
    WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_FULLSCREEN);
 also does not force the video to be in full screen. The only way force video to full screen is: <VideoView android:id="@+id/myvideoview"
    android:layout_width="fill_parent"
    android:layout_alignParentRight="true"
    android:layout_alignParentLeft="true" 
    android:layout_alignParentTop="true"

The dialog box offered to create all the new methods of the new interface as "abstract" methods. What would be the benefit of that? I thought that the fact that you were allowed to declare interface methods as abstract was a superfluous and harmless feature of the language that is not particularly encouraged. Why would Eclipse support such a style, or why would someone voluntarily choose to do so? Clarification: I am not asking why interface methods are abstract, that is obvious. I am asking why one would explicitly choose to mark them as abstract since if they're in an interface they are abstract anyway.

@TITLE:Correct Bash and shell script variable capitalization
@CONTENT:I run across many shell scripts with variables in all caps, and I've always thought that there is a severe misunderstanding with that. My understanding is that, by convention (and perhaps by necessity long ago), environment variables are in all-caps. But in modern scripting environments like Bash, I have always prefered the convention of lower-case variables for temporary variables, and upper-case variables only for exported (i.e. environment) variables. For example: #!/usr/bin/env bash
year=`date +%Y`
echo "It is $year."
export JAVA_HOME="$HOME/java"
 That has always been my take on things. Are there any authoritative sources which either agree or disagree with this approach, or is it purely a matter of style?

@LINK:/questions/494550/how-does-transactionscope-roll-back-transactions
@TITLE:How does TransactionScope roll back transactions?
@CONTENT:I'm writing an integration test where I will be inserting a number of objects into a database and then checking to make sure whether my method retrieves those objects. My connection to the database is through NHibernate...and my usual method of creating such a test would be to do the following: NHibernateSession.BeginTransaction();

//use nhibernate to insert objects into database
//retrieve objects via my method
//verify actual objects returned are the same as those inserted

NHibernateSession.RollbackTransaction();
 However, I've recently found out about TransactionScope which apparently can be used for this very purpose... Some example code I've found is as follows: public static int AddDepartmentWithEmployees(Department dept)
{

    int res = 0;

    DepartmentAdapter deptAdapter = new DepartmentAdapter();
    EmployeeAdapter empAdapter = new EmployeeAdapter();
    using (TransactionScope txScope = new TransactionScope())
    {

        res += deptAdapter.Insert(dept.DepartmentName);
        //Custom method made to return Department ID 
        //after inserting the department "Identity Column"
        dept.DepartmentID = deptAdapter.GetInsertReturnValue();
        foreach(Employee emp in dept.Employees)
        {

            emp.EmployeeDeptID = dept.DepartmentID;
            res += empAdapter.Insert(emp.EmployeeName, emp.EmployeeDeptID);

        }
        txScope.Complete();

    }
    return res;

}
 I believe that if I don't include the line txScope.Complete() that the data inserted will be rolled back. But unfortunately I don't understand how that is possible... how does the txScope object keep a track of the deptAdapter and empAdapter objects and their transactions on the database. I feel like I'm missing a bit of information here...am I really able to replace my BeginTransaction() and RollbackTransaction() calls by surrounding my code using TransactionScope? If not, how then does TransactionScope work to roll back transactions?
@CODE:NHibernateSession.BeginTransaction();

//use nhibernate to insert objects into database
//retrieve objects via my method
//verify actual objects returned are the same as those inserted

NHibernateSession.RollbackTransaction(); public static int AddDepartmentWithEmployees(Department dept)
{

    int res = 0;

    DepartmentAdapter deptAdapter = new DepartmentAdapter();
    EmployeeAdapter empAdapter = new EmployeeAdapter();
    using (TransactionScope txScope = new TransactionScope())
    {

        res += deptAdapter.Insert(dept.DepartmentName);
        //Custom method made to return Department ID 
        //after inserting the department "Identity Column"
        dept.DepartmentID = deptAdapter.GetInsertReturnValue();
        foreach(Employee emp in dept.Employees)
        {

            emp.EmployeeDeptID = dept.DepartmentID;
            res += empAdapter.Insert(emp.EmployeeName, emp.EmployeeDeptID);

        }

@TITLE:Why do stacks typically grow downwards?
@CONTENT:I know that in the architectures I'm personally familiar with (x86, 6502, etc), the stack typically grows downwards (i.e. every item pushed onto the stack results in a decremented SP, not an incremented one). I'm wondering about the historical rationale for this. I know that in a unified address space, it's convenient to start the stack on the opposite end of the data segment (say) so there's only a problem if the two sides collide in the middle. But why does the stack traditionally get the top part? Especially given how this is the opposite of the "conceptual" model? (And note that in the 6502 architecture, the stack also grows downwards, even though it is bounded to a single 256-byte page, and this direction choice seems arbitrary.)

Sorry I don't think I worded this correctly, I can get the correct script to run (meaning the PATH to the script in crontab is not the problem here), it's just when that script is running I run a build and this uses the PATHs set in .bashrc. When I run the script when I'm logged in, the .bashrc PATHs are pulled in. Since cron doesn't run in a shell per say it does not pull in .bashrc.

@CONTENT:After checking if a cell value exists in a column, I need to get the value of the cell next to the matching cell. For instance, I check if the value in cell A1 exists in column B, and assuming it matches B5, then I want the value in cell C5. To solve the first half of the problem, I did this... =IF(ISERROR(MATCH(A1,B:B, 0)), "No Match", "Match")

 So naturally, to get the value of the next cell, I tried... =IF(ISERROR(MATCH(A1,B:B, 0)), "No Match", C&MATCH(A1,B:B, 0))
 ...and it doesn't work. What am I missing? How do I append the column number to the row number returned to achieve the desired result?

@TITLE:Looping Through All a Server's Sessions in PHP
@CONTENT:Is there a way in PHP to get a list of all sessions (and the variables within each) on the server? Basically, we have a maintenance function which needs to know which users are currently logged into the site. We already store data for each user in a session variable, but I am hoping that I can loop through each of these sessions and pluck out the data I need. MY PHP is very limited (I am a .Net developer ussually) but if anyone knows if this is even possible (and how to do it) I'd be very grateful. I googled this, and the results I found tended to inidcate that it WASN'T possible, but I find this very hard to accept. Still, If you can't you can't but I thought my buddies on StackOverflow could give me a definitive answer!

@TITLE:Possible bug in ASP.NET MVC with form values being replaced
@CONTENT:I appear to be having a problem with ASP.NET MVC in that, if I have more than one form on a page which uses the same name in each one, but as different types (radio/hidden/etc), then, when the first form posts (I choose the 'Date' radio button for instance), if the form is re-rendered (say as part of the results page), I seem to have the issue that the hidden value of the SearchType on the other forms is changed to the last radio button value (in this case, SearchType.Name). Below is an example form for reduction purposes. <% Html.BeginForm("Search", "Search", FormMethod.Post); %>
  <%= Html.RadioButton("SearchType", SearchType.Date, true) %>
  <%= Html.RadioButton("SearchType", SearchType.Name) %>
  <input type="submit" name="submitForm" value="Submit" />
<% Html.EndForm(); %>

<% Html.BeginForm("Search", "Search", FormMethod.Post); %>
  <%= Html.Hidden("SearchType", SearchType.Colour) %>
  <input type="submit" name="submitForm" value="Submit" />
<% Html.EndForm(); %>

<% Html.BeginForm("Search", "Search", FormMethod.Post); %>
  <%= Html.Hidden("SearchType", SearchType.Reference) %>
  <input type="submit" name="submitForm" value="Submit" />
<% Html.EndForm(); %>
 Resulting page source (this would be part of the results page) <form action="/Search/Search" method="post">
  <input type="radio" name="SearchType" value="Date" />
  <input type="radio" name="SearchType" value="Name" />
  <input type="submit" name="submitForm" value="Submit" />
</form>

<form action="/Search/Search" method="post">
  <input type="hidden" name="SearchType" value="Name" /> <!-- Should be Colour -->
  <input type="submit" name="submitForm" value="Submit" />
</form>

<form action="/Search/Search" method="post">
  <input type="hidden" name="SearchType" value="Name" /> <!-- Should be Reference -->
  <input type="submit" name="submitForm" value="Submit" />
</form>
 Please can anyone else with RC1 confirm this? Maybe it's because I'm using an enum. I don't know. I should add that I can circumvent this issue by using 'manual' input () tags for the hidden fields, but if I use MVC tags (<%= Html.Hidden(...) %>), .NET MVC replaces them every time. Many thanks. Update: I've seen this bug again today. It seems that this crops its head when you return a posted page and use MVC set hidden form tags with the Html helper. I've contacted Phil Haack about this, because I don't know where else to turn, and I don't believe that this should be expected behaviour as specified by David.

If I set the buttons to userInteractionEnabled = NO, then the scrolling works as expected, but of course, then the buttons don't work at all. This app worked fine in iOS 7 and before. It seems to be a iOS 8 "feature". I did notice that I can catch the button's drag event, but I don't know how to redirect it back to the scrollView. I'm thinking I'll need to replace my buttons with UIViews and manage the events myself but I'd be grateful if someone has other ideas or solutions.

@CONTENT:I read in another post that you can submit the app without the binary but I based on what I have seen this is no longer possible. It seems you cannot submit without the binary and the binary is submitted through the application loader. Is there any other known way to get the itunes/app store link to my app before I submit the binary?

@CONTENT:I feel like I spend a lot of time writing code in Python, but not enough time creating Pythonic code. Recently I ran into a funny little problem that I thought might have an easy, idiomatic solution. Paraphrasing the original, I needed to collect every sequential pair in a list. For example, given the list [1,2,3,4,5,6], I wanted to compute [(1,2),(3,4),(5,6)]. I came up with a quick solution at the time that looked like translated Java. Revisiting the question, the best I could do was l = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
[(l[2*x],l[2*x+1]) for x in range(len(l)/2)]
 which has the side effect of tossing out the last number in the case that the length isn't even. Is there a more idiomatic approach that I'm missing, or is this the best I'm going to get?

I then want to put the string values into an in-memory table with one column, so I can work with the data. I don't know if this can be done in MySQL. Maybe dirty workarounds are needed.

@TITLE:What pseudo-operators exist in Perl 5?
@CONTENT:I am currently documenting all of Perl 5's operators (see the perlopref GitHub project) and I have decided to include Perl 5's pseudo-operators as well. To me, a pseudo-operator in Perl is anything that looks like an operator, but is really more than one operator or a some other piece of syntax. I have documented the four I am familiar with already: ()= the countof operator =()= the goatse/countof operator ~~ the scalar context operator }{ the Eskimo-kiss operator What other names exist for these pseudo-operators, and do you know of any pseudo-operators I have missed? =head1 Pseudo-operators

There are idioms in Perl 5 that appear to be operators, but are really a
combination of several operators or pieces of syntax. These pseudo-operators
have the precedence of the constituent parts.

=head2 ()= X

=head3 Description

This pseudo-operator is the list assignment operator (aka the countof
operator).  It is made up of two items C<()>, and C<=>.  In scalar context
it returns the number of items in the list X.  In list context it returns an
empty list.  It is useful when you have something that returns a list and
you want to know the number of items in that list and don't care about the
list's contents.  It is needed because the comma operator returns the last
item in the sequence rather than the number of items in the sequence when it
is placed in scalar context.

It works because the assignment operator returns the number of items
available to be assigned when its left hand side has list context.  In the
following example there are five values in the list being assigned to the
list C<($x, $y, $z)>, so C<$count> is assigned C<5>.

    my $count = my ($x, $y, $z) = qw/a b c d e/;

The empty list (the C<()> part of the pseudo-operator) triggers this
behavior.

=head3 Example

    sub f { return qw/a b c d e/ }

    my $count = ()= f();              #$count is now 5

    my $string = "cat cat dog cat";

    my $cats = ()= $string =~ /cat/g; #$cats is now 3

    print scalar( ()= f() ), "\n";    #prints "5\n"

=head3 See also

L</X = Y> and L</X =()= Y>

=head2 X =()= Y

This pseudo-operator is often called the goatse operator for reasons better
left unexamined; it is also called the list assignment or countof operator.
It is made up of three items C<=>, C<()>, and C<=>.  When X is a scalar
variable, the number of items in the list Y is returned.  If X is an array
or a hash it it returns an empty list.  It is useful when you have something
that returns a list and you want to know the number of items in that list
and don't care about the list's contents.  It is needed because the comma
operator returns the last item in the sequence rather than the number of
items in the sequence when it is placed in scalar context.

It works because the assignment operator returns the number of items
available to be assigned when its left hand side has list context.  In the
following example there are five values in the list being assigned to the
list C<($x, $y, $z)>, so C<$count> is assigned C<5>.

    my $count = my ($x, $y, $z) = qw/a b c d e/;

The empty list (the C<()> part of the pseudo-operator) triggers this
behavior.

=head3 Example

    sub f { return qw/a b c d e/ }

    my $count =()= f();              #$count is now 5

    my $string = "cat cat dog cat";

    my $cats =()= $string =~ /cat/g; #$cats is now 3

=head3 See also

L</=> and L</()=>

=head2 ~~X

=head3 Description

This pseudo-operator is named the scalar context operator.  It is made up of
two bitwise negation operators.  It provides scalar context to the
expression X.  It works because the first bitwise negation operator provides
scalar context to X and performs a bitwise negation of the result; since the
result of two bitwise negations is the original item, the value of the
original expression is preserved.

With the addition of the Smart match operator, this pseudo-operator is even
more confusing.  The C<scalar> function is much easier to understand and you
are encouraged to use it instead.

=head3 Example

    my @a = qw/a b c d/;

    print ~~@a, "\n"; #prints 4

=head3 See also

L</~X>, L</X ~~ Y>, and L<perlfunc/scalar>

=head2 X }{ Y

=head3 Description

This pseudo-operator is called the Eskimo-kiss operator because it looks
like two faces touching noses.  It is made up of an closing brace and an
opening brace.  It is used when using C<perl> as a command-line program with
the C<-n> or C<-p> options.  It has the effect of running X inside of the
loop created by C<-n> or C<-p> and running Y at the end of the program.  It
works because the closing brace closes the loop created by C<-n> or C<-p>
and the opening brace creates a new bare block that is closed by the loop's
original ending.  You can see this behavior by using the L<B::Deparse>
module.  Here is the command C<perl -ne 'print $_;'> deparsed:

    LINE: while (defined($_ = <ARGV>)) {
        print $_;
    }

Notice how the original code was wrapped with the C<while> loop.  Here is
the deparsing of C<perl -ne '$count++ if /foo/; }{ print "$count\n"'>:

    LINE: while (defined($_ = <ARGV>)) {
        ++$count if /foo/;
    }
    {
        print "$count\n";
    }

Notice how the C<while> loop is closed by the closing brace we added and the
opening brace starts a new bare block that is closed by the closing brace
that was originally intended to close the C<while> loop.

=head3 Example

    # count unique lines in the file FOO
    perl -nle '$seen{$_}++ }{ print "$_ => $seen{$_}" for keys %seen' FOO

    # sum all of the lines until the user types control-d
    perl -nle '$sum += $_ }{ print $sum'

With the addition of the Smart match operator, this pseudo-operator is even
more confusing.  The C<scalar> function is much easier to understand and you
are encouraged to use it instead.

=head3 Example

    my @a = qw/a b c d/;

    print ~~@a, "\n"; #prints 4

=head2 X }{ Y

=head3 Description

This pseudo-operator is called the Eskimo-kiss operator because it looks
like two faces touching noses.  It is made up of an closing brace and an
opening brace.  It is used when using C<perl> as a command-line program with
the C<-n> or C<-p> options.  It has the effect of running X inside of the
loop created by C<-n> or C<-p> and running Y at the end of the program.  It
works because the closing brace closes the loop created by C<-n> or C<-p>
and the opening brace creates a new bare block that is closed by the loop's
original ending.  You can see this behavior by using the L<B::Deparse>
module.  Here is the command C<perl -ne 'print $_;'> deparsed:

    LINE: while (defined($_ = <ARGV>)) {
        print $_;
    }

Notice how the original code was wrapped with the C<while> loop.  Here is
the deparsing of C<perl -ne '$count++ if /foo/; }{ print "$count\n"'>:

    LINE: while (defined($_ = <ARGV>)) {
        ++$count if /foo/;
    }
    {
        print "$count\n";
    }

Notice how the C<while> loop is closed by the closing brace we added and the
opening brace starts a new bare block that is closed by the closing brace
that was originally intended to close the C<while> loop.

=head3 Example

    # count unique lines in the file FOO
    perl -nle '$seen{$_}++ }{ print "$_ => $seen{$_}" for keys %seen' FOO

    # sum all of the lines until the user types control-d
    perl -nle '$sum += $_ }{ print $sum'

@TITLE:Alternatives to System.Drawing for use with ASP.NET?
@CONTENT:After several days of tracking down bizarre GDI+ errors, I've stumbled across this little gem on MSDN: Classes within the System.Drawing namespace are not supported for use within a Windows or ASP.NET service. Attempting to use these classes from within one of these application types may produce unexpected problems, such as diminished service performance and run-time exceptions. I don't know whether "ASP.NET service" means "web application" in this context, but "diminished service performance" certainly seems to cover the random assortment of "A generic error occurred in GDI+" and "Out of memory" errors that my app is throwing - intermittent, non-reproducible errors reading and writing JPEG images that - in many cases - were actually created by System.Drawing.Imaging in the first place. So - if GDI+ can't read and write JPEG files reliably in a Web app, what should I be using instead? I want users to be able to upload images (JPEG required, other formats nice-to-have), resample them reliably, and display useful error messages if anything goes wrong. Any ideas? Are the System.Media namespaces from WPF worth considering? Thanks, Dylan EDIT: Yeah, I know GDI+ works "most of the time". That's not good enough, because when it fails, it does so in a way that's impossible to isolate or recover from gracefully. I am not interested in examples of GDI+ code that works for you: I am looking for alternative libraries to use for image processing.

@TITLE:¡§Launch Failed. Binary Not Found.¡¨ Snow Leopard and Eclipse C/C++ IDE issue
@CONTENT:Not a question, I've just scoured the internet in search of a solution for this problem and thought I'd share it with the good folks of SO. I'll put it in plain terms so that it's accessible to newbs. :) (Apologies if this is the wrong place -- just trying to be helpful.) This issue occurs with almost any user OS X Snow Leopard who tries to use the Eclipse C/C++ IDE, but is particularly annoying for the people (like me) who were using the Eclipse C/C++ IDE in Leopard, and were unable to work with Eclipse anymore when they upgraded. The issue occurs When users go to build/compile/link their software. They get the following error: Launch Failed. Binary Not Found. Further, the "binaries" branch in the project window on the left is simply nonexistent. THE PROBLEM: is that GCC 4.2 (the GNU Compiler Collection) that comes with Snow Leopard compiles binaries in 64-bit by default. Unfortunately, the linker that Eclipse uses does not understand 64-bit binaries; it reads 32-bit binaries. There may be other issues here, but in short, they culminate in no binary being generated, at least not one that Eclipse can read, which translates into Eclipse not finding the binaries. Hence the error. One solution is to add an -arch i686 flag when making the file, but manually making the file every time is annoying. Luckily for us, Snow Leopard also comes with GCC 4.0, which compiles in 32 bits by default. So one solution is merely to link this as the default compiler. This is the way I did it. THE SOLUTION: The GCCs are in /usr/bin, which is normally a hidden folder, so you can't see it in the Finder unless you explicitly tell the system that you want to see hidden folders. Anyway, what you want to do is go to the /usr/bin folder and delete the path that links the GCC command with GCC 4.2 and add a path that links the GCC command with GCC 4.0. In other words, when you or Eclipse try to access GCC, we want the command to go to the compiler that builds in 32 bits by default, so that the linker can read the files; we do not want it to go to the compiler that compiles in 64 bits. The best way to do this is to go to Applications/Utilities, and select the app called Terminal. A text prompt should come up. It should say something like "(Computer Name):~ (Username)$ " (with a space for you user input at the end). The way to accomplish the tasks above is to enter the following commands, entering each one in sequence VERBATIM, and pressing enter after each individual line. cd /usr/bin
rm cc gcc c++ g++
ln -s gcc-4.0 cc
ln -s gcc-4.0 gcc
ln -s c++-4.0 c++
ln -s g++-4.0 g++
 Like me, you will probably get an error that tells you you don't have permission to access these files. If so, try the following commands instead: cd /usr/bin
sudo rm cc gcc c++ g++
sudo ln -s gcc-4.0 cc
sudo ln -s gcc-4.0 gcc
sudo ln -s c++-4.0 c++
sudo ln -s g++-4.0 g++
 Sudo may prompt you for a password. If you've never used sudo before, try just pressing enter. If that doesn't work, try the password for your main admin account. OTHER POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS You may be able to enter build variables into Eclipse. I tried this, but I don't know enough about it. If you want to feel it out, the flag you will probably need is -arch i686. In earnest, GCC-4.0 worked for me all this time, and I don't see any reason to switch now. There may be a way to alter the default for the compiler itself, but once again, I don't know enough about it. Hope this has been helpful and informative. Good coding!

@LINK:/questions/1481853/technique-or-utility-to-minimize-java-warm-up-time
@TITLE:Technique or utility to minimize Java ¡§warm-up¡¨ time?
@CONTENT:I am supporting a Java messaging application that requires low latency (< 300 microseconds processing each message). However, our profiling shows that the Sun Java Virtual Machine runs slowly at first, and speeds up after the first 5,000 messages or so. The first 5,000 messages have latency of 1-4 milliseconds. After about the first 5,000, subsequent messages have ~250 microseconds latency, with occasional outliers. It's generally understood that this is typical behavior for a Java application. However, from a business standpoint it's not acceptable to tell the customer that they have to wait for the JVM to "warm-up" before they see the performance they demand. The application needs to be "warmed-up" before the first customer message is processed The JVM is Sun 1.6.0 update 4. Ideas for overcoming this issue: JVM settings, such as -XX:CompileThreshold= Add a component to "warm-up" the application on startup, for example by sending "fake messages" through the application. Statically load application and JDK classes upon application startup, so that classes aren't loaded from JARs while processing customer messages. Some utility or Java agent that accomplishes either or both of the above two ideas, so that I don't have to re-invent the wheel. NOTE: Obviously for this solution I'm looking at all factors, including chip arch, disk type and configuration and OS settings. However, for this question I want to focus on what can be done to optimize the Java application and minimize "warm up" time.

@TITLE:CUDA and Classes
@CONTENT:I've searched all over for some insight on how exactly to use classes with CUDA, and while there is a general consensus that it can be done and apparently is being done by people, I've had a hard time finding out how to actually do it. I have a class which implements a basic bitset with operator overloading and the like. I need to be able to instantiate objects of this class on both the host and the device, copy between the two, etc. Do I define this class in a .cu? If so, how do I use it in my host-side C++ code? The functions of the class do not need to access special CUDA variables like threadId; it just needs to be able to be used host and device side. Thanks for any help, and if I'm approaching this in completely the wrong way, I'd love to hear alternatives.

@TITLE:Is there any way to determine if the iphone is roaming?
@CONTENT:I am working on an iPhone application and would really like to determine if the device is roaming so that I can intelligently avoid costing my users expensive connections if out of their home network. The application I am writing is for jailbroken phones, however I would prefer to use standard SDKs if possible. Here is what I've already found: 1. Apple SDKs: In the apple documentation, I found the promise in Apple's SCNetworkReachability API. The API provides access to such things as whether you are on a WIFI or a cell phone network, whether a network connection is currently established, etc. However searching the SCNetworkReachability API reference pdf for 'roam' or 'roaming' both turn up nil. So does their sample code. 2. Grep of a Jailbroken iPhone FS: The preferences -> general -> networking tab is where users can turn on or off their roaming. Looking in the plist file for this ("/Applications/Preferences/Network.plist") I was able to find the following references:         PostNotification = "com.apple.commcenter.InternationalRoamingEDGE.changed";
        cell = PSSwitchCell;
        default = 1;
        defaults = "com.apple.commcenter";
        key = InternationalRoamingEDGE;
        label = "EDGE_ROAMING_TOGGLE";
        requiredCapabilities =             (
            telephony
        );
 This is certainly a lead, as it appears I can sign up for notifications that the user has changed the InternationalRoaming settings. Still, I'm not certain how to turn this into the knowledge that they are in fact, presently roaming. 3. Check the class dumped sources of SpringBoard: I've dumped the classes of SpringBoard using class-dump. I was unable to find any references to 'roam' or 'roaming' 4. Obviously I started by checking at SO for this: Couldn't find anything related. Further steps: Does anyone have any advice here? I know this is possible. Apple clearly has made it very difficult to find however. I highly doubt this is possible without using a private framework. (such as CoreTelephony). As this is a jailbroken app, I may resort to screen-scraping the the carrier name with injected code in the SpringBoard, but I would really rather prefer not to go that route. Any advice much appreciated. Thanks.
@CODE:PostNotification = "com.apple.commcenter.InternationalRoamingEDGE.changed";

    logger.log(Level.SEVERE, "Welcome Home");
    logger.log(Level.SEVERE, "Hello, World");
    logger.log(Level.SEVERE, "Welcome Home");
  }
}
 now the question is if I run "java LogServer" on the server, it will open the application and waiting for input stream and if I open my site, it will start streaming the log. But if I open one more using other computer/network, the second site does not log the stream. seems like it's because the first one still bind to port 5000. How do I handle this? How does socket actually work with multiple client / one server?

@TITLE:Image manipulation and texture mapping using HTML5 Canvas?
@CONTENT:In a 3D engine I'm working on I've succesfully managed to draw a cube in 3D. The only method to fill the sides is using either a solid color or gradient as far as I'm concerned. To make things more exciting, I'd really love to implement texture mapping using a simple bitmap. The point is that I can hardly find any articles or code samples on the subject of image manipulation in JavaScript. Moreover, image support in HTML5 canvas seems to be restricted to cropping. How could I go about stretching a bitmap so that a rectangular bitmap can fill up a unregular cube face? In 2D, a projected square cube face is, due to perspective, not of a square shape, so I'll have to stretch it to make it fit in any quadrilateral. Hopefully this image clarifies my point. The left face is now filled up with a white/black gradient. How could I fill it with a bitmap, after it has been texture-mapped? Does anyone have any tips on perspective texture mapping (or image manipulation at all) using JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas? Edit: I got it working, thanks to 6502! It is, however, rather CPU intensive so I'd love to hear any optimization ideas. Result using 6502's technique - Texture image used

@CONTENT:Various WPF applications of mine display FlowDocument's. I'm able to print them, using the approach described in the answer to Printing a WPF FlowDocument. Now I'd like to add a "print preview" capability. In the normal case, I am printing the FlowDocument that is displayed in the Window, and so I wouldn't need a Print Preview then. But in some cases the FlowDocument to print is constructed on-the-fly in memory. And in these cases I'd like to display it before printing. Now, I can certainly pop a new window and display the FlowDocument, but I want the preview to really feel like it is part of the printing operation, and not just another Window in the app. I don't want a normal FlowDocument in a FlowDocumentScrollViewer. Rather than being "any size" it needs to be constrained to the size of the paper, a specific HxW ratio, and paginated. Suggestions? should I just use a standard Window, and in that case, how to I ensure the FlowDocument is at the proper ratio? is there a more "integrated" way to do the preview within the scope of the PrintDialog UI that is part of Windows?

@CONTENT:I'm playing around with list comprehensions and I came across this little snippet on another site: return ''.join([`num` for num in xrange(loop_count)])
 I spent a few minutes trying to replicate the function (by typing) before realising the `num` bit was breaking it. What does enclosing a statement in those characters do? From what I can see it is the equivalent of str(num). But when I timed it: return ''.join([str(num) for num in xrange(10000000)])
 It takes 4.09s whereas: return ''.join([`num` for num in xrange(10000000)])
 takes 2.43s. Both give identical results but one is a lot slower. What is going on here? EDIT: Oddly... repr() gives slightly slower results than `num`. 2.99s vs 2.43s. Using Python 2.6 (haven't tried 3.0 yet).

@CONTENT:I am a new comer to the android world and with a .NET background. I am trying to install the Android Studio but I am having a mismatch on Android.com about the JDK version required for developing Android applications. From the SDK web page it states that JDK 6 is required (under system requirements section). Jim Wilson also insist in his course on Pluralsight (which is quite new, from last May) that using version 7 with the Android SDK will create a lot of headache and makes it clear to only use JDK 6. Although in the Android studio page (Under installing step 2) they explain how to set an environment variable indicating the correct JDK location. In here they use a path of JDK 7 Select Start menu > Computer > System Properties > Advanced System Properties. Then open Advanced tab > Environment Variables and add a new system variable JAVA_HOME that points to your JDK folder, for example C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_21. I am pretty sure both the ADT & Eclipse bundle and the Android Studio bundle are using the same SDK but now I am confused about which JDK version I need to install. My sole purpose is to avoid problems as much as possible while getting my first steps into the android development. Disclaimer: I am not related by any mean to Pluralsight. I am just a normal user following the courses.

@TITLE:Effect of a Bitwise Operator on a Boolean in Java
@CONTENT:The bitwise operators are supposed to travel variables and operate on them bit by bit. In the case of integers, longs, chars this makes sense. These variables can contain the full range of values enforced by their size. In the case of booleans, however, a boolean can contain only two values. 1 = true or 0 = false. But the size of the boolean isn't defined. It can be as big as a byte or as small a bit. So what's the effect of using a bitwise operator on a boolean? Does the JVM essentially translate it to a normal logical operator and move on? Does it treat the boolean as a single bit entity for the purpose of the operation? Or is the result undefined along with the size of a boolean?

@TITLE:Unmanaged DLLs fail to load on ASP.NET server
@CONTENT:This question relates to an ASP.NET website, originally developed in VS 2005 and now in VS 2008. This website uses two unmanaged external DLLs which are not .NET and I do not have the source code to compile them and have to use them as is. This website runs fine from within Visual Studio, locating and accessing these external DLLs correctly. However, when the website is published on a webserver (runnning IIS6 and ASP.NET 2.0) rather than the development PC it cannot locate and access these external DLLs, and I get the following error: Unable to load DLL 'XYZ.dll': The specified module could not be found. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x8007007E) The external DLLs are located in the bin directory of the website, along with the managed DLLs that wrap them and all the other DLLs for the website. Searching this problem reveals that many other people seem to have the same problem accessing external non.NET DLLs from ASP.NET websites, but I haven't found a solution that works. I have tried the following: Running DEPENDS to check the dependencies to establish that the first three are in System32 directory in the path, the last is in the .NET 2 framework. I put the two DLLs and their dependencies in System32 and rebooted the server, but website still couldn't load these external DLLs. Gave full rights to ASPNET, IIS_WPG and IUSR (for that server) to the website bin directory and rebooted, but website still couldn't load these external DLLs. Added the external DLLs as existing items to the projects and set their "Copy to Output" property to "Copy Always", and website still can't find the DLLs. Also set their "Build Action" property to "Embedded resource" and website still can't find the DLLs. Any assistance with this problem would be greatly appreciated!

@CONTENT:I would like to understand better how Gridview works, in particular auto_fit. Here is the XML layout: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

 And it works fine with a series of six thumbnails (48*48 pixels). In portrait mode, it displays one row, six columns. What I don't understand is why the line android:columnWidth="60dp" is necessary, because auto_fit is expected to find the right number of columns.

@TITLE:SQLite parameter substitution problem
@CONTENT:Using SQLite3 with Python 2.5, I'm trying to iterate through a list and pull the weight of an item from the database based on the item's name. I tried using the "?" parameter substitution suggested to prevent SQL injections but it doesn't work. For example, when I use: for item in self.inventory_names:
    self.cursor.execute("SELECT weight FROM Equipment WHERE name = ?", item)
    self.cursor.close()
 I get the error: sqlite3.ProgrammingError: Incorrect number of bindings supplied. The current statement uses 1, and there are 8 supplied. I believe this is somehow caused by the initial creation of the database; the module I made that actually creates the DB does have 8 bindings. cursor.execute("""CREATE TABLE Equipment 
    (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, 
    name TEXT,
    price INTEGER, 
    weight REAL, 
    info TEXT, 
    ammo_cap INTEGER, 
    availability_west TEXT,
    availability_east TEXT)""")
 However, when I use the less-secure "%s" substitution for each item name, it works just fine. Like so: for item in self.inventory_names:
    self.cursor.execute("SELECT weight FROM Equipment WHERE name = '%s'" % item)

@TITLE:What's the _ underscore representative of in Swift References?
@CONTENT:In the reference section of Apple's docs there's lots of instances of this sort of thing: func runAction(_action: SKAction!) The Objective-C 'equivalent' of this is: - (void)runAction:(SKAction *)action It strikes me that it's probably important that (in the Swift reference) there's a space after the underscore and "action" is written in italics. But I can't figure out what this is trying to convey. So perhaps the question is... is there a reference for the conventions used in the references? -- here's the page I'm referencing in this reference to the underscore use: https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/SpriteKit/Reference/SKNode_Ref/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/SKNode/runAction:

@TITLE:Cabal not installing dependencies when needing profiling libraries?
@CONTENT:I want to compile my program with profiling, so I run: $ cabal configure --enable-executable-profiling
...
$ cabal build
...
    Could not find module 'Graphics.UI.GLUT':
      Perhaps you havent installed the profiling libraries for package 'GLUT-2.2.2.0'?

$ # indeed I have not installed the prof libs for GLUT, so..
$ cabal install -p GLUT --reinstall
...
    Could not find module 'Graphics.Rendering.OpenGL':
      Perhaps you havent installed the profiling libraries for package 'OpenGL-2.4.0.1'?
...
 So, the problem is, that unlike cabal's usual welcome behavior, cabal doesn't resolve the dependencies and install them when needing profiling libraries. I can work around it by resolving the dependencies manually (by following errors that appear after a while of compiling): $ cabal install -p OpenGLRaw --reinstall
$ cabal install -p StateVar --reinstall
$ cabal install -p Tensor --reinstall
$ cabal install -p ObjectName --reinstall
$ cabal install -p GLURaw --reinstall
$ cabal install -p OpenGL --reinstall
$ cabal install -p GLUT --reinstall
 And then repeat for my next dependency.. Is there a better way to do this? i.e do make cabal do the work on its own as it does for normal libraries?
@CODE:$ cabal configure --enable-executable-profiling
...
$ cabal build
...
    Could not find module 'Graphics.UI.GLUT':

@TITLE:Fix Node Position in D3 Force-Directed Layout
@CONTENT:I want some of the nodes in my force-directed layout to ignore the force and stay in fixed positions based on the attribute of the node, while still being able to be dragged and exert repulsion on other nodes and maintain their link lines. I thought it would be as simple as this:     force.on("tick", function() {
        vis.selectAll("g.node")
            .attr("transform", function(d) {
                return (d.someAttribute == true) ?
                    "translate(" + d.xcoordFromAttribute + "," + d.ycoordFromAttribute +")" :
                    "translate(" + d.x + "," + d.y + ")"
            });
     });
 I have also tried to manually set the node's x and y attributes on-tick, but then the links continue to float out to where the node would be if it was affected by the force. Obviously I have a basic misunderstanding of how this is supposed to work, so could somebody point me to an example where some nodes are fixed in their position (but still draggable) and the rest of the nodes are floating around force-directed-like, and all the links are still working?
@CODE:force.on("tick", function() {

@TITLE:Android: Getting a file Uri from a content Uri?
@CONTENT:So in my app the user is to select an audio file which the app then handles. The problem I am having is that in order for the app to do what I want it to do with the audio files, I need the Uri to be in file format. When I use Android's native music player to browse for the audio file in the app, the Uri is a Content uri, which looks like this: content://media/external/audio/media/710 However, using the popular file manager application Astro, I get the following: file:///sdcard/media/audio/ringtones/GetupGetOut.mp3 The latter is much more accessible for me to work with, but of course I want the app to have functionality with the audio file the user chooses regardless of the program they use to browse their collection. So my question is, is there a way to convert the content:// style Uri into a file:// Uri? Otherwise, what would you recommend for me to solve this problem? Here is the code which calls up the chooser, for reference: Intent ringIntent = new Intent();
            ringIntent.setType("audio/mp3");
            ringIntent.setAction(Intent.ACTION_GET_CONTENT);
            ringIntent.addCategory(Intent.CATEGORY_OPENABLE);
            startActivityForResult(Intent.createChooser(ringIntent, "Select Ringtone"), SELECT_RINGTONE);
 Thank you very much! Please let me know if I can provide more code to help with answering. I do the following with the content Uri: m_ringerPath = m_ringtoneUri.getPath(); File file = new File(m_ringerPath); Then some FileInputStream stuff with said file.
@CODE:content://media/external/audio/media/710 file:///sdcard/media/audio/ringtones/GetupGetOut.mp3 Intent ringIntent = new Intent();

@CONTENT:I would like to programatically disable hardware prefetching. From Optimizing Application Performance on Intel? Core? Microarchitecture Using Hardware-Implemented Prefetchers and How to Choose between Hardware and Software Prefetch on 32-Bit Intel?

@TITLE:Why should I use int instead of a byte or short in C#
@CONTENT:I have found a few threads in regards to this issue. Most people appear to favor using int in their c# code accross the board even if a byte or smallint would handle the data unless it is a mobile app. I don't understand why. Doesn't it make more sense to define your C# datatype as the same datatype that would be in your data storage solution? My Premise: If I am using a typed dataset, Linq2SQL classes, POCO, one way or another I will run into compiler datatype conversion issues if I don't keep my datatypes in sync across my tiers. I don't really like doing System.Convert all the time just because it was easier to use int accross the board in c# code. I have always used whatever the smallest datatype is needed to handle the data in the database as well as in code, to keep my interface to the database clean. So I would bet 75% of my C# code is using byte or short as opposed to int, because that is what is in the database. Possibilities: Does this mean that most people who just use int for everything in code also use the int datatype for their sql storage datatypes and could care less about the overall size of their database, or do they do system.convert in code wherever applicable? Why I care: I have worked on my own forever and I just want to be familiar with best practices and standard coding conventions.

 The calculated value 'BalanceDue' that is set as a variable in the list of selected columns cannot be used in the WHERE clause. Is there a way that it can? In this related question (Using a variable in MySQL Select Statment in a Where Clause), it seems like the answer would be, actually, no, you would just write out the calculation (and perform that calculation in the query) twice, none of which is satisfactory.

@TITLE:Using HttpClient and HttpPost in Android with post parameters
@CONTENT:I'm writing code for an Android application that is supposed to take data, package it as Json and post it to a web server, that in turn is supposed to respond with json. Using a GET request works fine, but for some reason using POST all data seems to get stripped and the server does not receive anything. Here's a snippet of the code: HttpParams params = new BasicHttpParams();
HttpConnectionParams.setConnectionTimeout(params, 5000);
HttpConnectionParams.setSoTimeout(params, 5000);        
DefaultHttpClient httpClient = new DefaultHttpClient(params);
BasicCookieStore cookieStore = new BasicCookieStore();
httpClient.setCookieStore(cookieStore);

String uri = JSON_ADDRESS;
String result = "";
String username = "user";
String apikey = "something";
String contentType = "application/json";

JSONObject jsonObj = new JSONObject();

try {
    jsonObj.put("username", username);
    jsonObj.put("apikey", apikey);
} catch (JSONException e) {
    Log.e(TAG, "JSONException: " + e);
}

HttpPost httpPost = new HttpPost(uri);
List<NameValuePair> postParams = new ArrayList<NameValuePair>();
postParams.add(new BasicNameValuePair("json", jsonObj.toString()));
HttpGet httpGet = null;
try {
    UrlEncodedFormEntity entity = new UrlEncodedFormEntity(postParams);
    entity.setContentEncoding(HTTP.UTF_8);
    entity.setContentType("application/json");
    httpPost.setEntity(entity);

    httpPost.setHeader("Content-Type", contentType);
    httpPost.setHeader("Accept", contentType);
} catch (UnsupportedEncodingException e) {
    Log.e(TAG, "UnsupportedEncodingException: " + e);
}

try {
    HttpResponse httpResponse = httpClient.execute(httpPost);
    HttpEntity httpEntity = httpResponse.getEntity();

    if (httpEntity != null) {
        InputStream is = httpEntity.getContent();
        result = StringUtils.convertStreamToString(is);
        Log.i(TAG, "Result: " + result);
    }
} catch (ClientProtocolException e) {
    Log.e(TAG, "ClientProtocolException: " + e);
} catch (IOException e) {
    Log.e(TAG, "IOException: " + e);
}

return result;
 I think I have followed the general guidelines on how to create the parameters and post them, but apparently not. Any help or pointers to where I can find a solution, are very welcome at this point (after spending a few hours realizing no post data was ever sent). The real server is running Wicket on Tomcat, but I've also tested it out on a simple PHP page, with no difference.

@LINK:/questions/3270409/how-do-i-get-multiple-icons-to-launch-different-activities-in-one-application
@TITLE:How do I get multiple icons to launch different activities in one application?
@CONTENT:I have an application with two activities and I'd like to be able to have two icons appear in the launcher, each launching the respective activity within the app. Specifically, I want one icon to launch my main app, and another icon to launch my settings activity. Is this possible? Here is what I've tried so far:     <activity android:label="MyApp" android:name=".MyApp">
        <intent-filter>
            <action android:name=".MyApp"/>
            <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN"/>
            <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER"/>
        </intent-filter>
    </activity>


    <activity android:label="Settings" android:name=".Settings">
        <intent-filter>
            <action android:name=".Settings"/>
            <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN"/>
            <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER"/>
        </intent-filter>
    </activity>
 This creates two launcher icons, but they both run my main app instead of the second icon running my settings app. I've tried just having the launcher category but then I don't get an icon so it looks like I need the main action as well. Is this the right approach or should I be declaring two applications in the manifest instead?
@CODE:<activity android:label="MyApp" android:name=".MyApp">
        <intent-filter>
            <action android:name=".MyApp"/>
            <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN"/>
            <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER"/>
        </intent-filter>

@LINK:/questions/2758608/window-focus-not-working-in-google-chrome
@TITLE:window.focus() not working in Google Chrome
@CONTENT:Just wondering if Google Chrome is going to support window.focus() at some point. When I mean support, I mean have it work. The call to it doesn't fail, it just doesn't do anything. All other major browsers do not have this problem: FireFox, IE6-IE8 and Safari. I have a client-side class for managing browser windows. When I first create a window the window comes into focus, but subsequent attempts to bring focus to the window do not work. From what I can tell, this appears to be a security feature to avoid annoying pop-ups and it does not appear to be a WebKit issue as it works in Safari. I know one idea someone brought forward was to close the window then reopen it, but this is a horrible solution. Googling shows that I do not appear to be the only person frustrated with this. And just to be 100% clear, I mean new windows, not tabs (tabs cannot be focused from what I've read) and all the windows being opened are in the same domain. Any ideas, workarounds aside from the bad one I mention above? There is a bug logged on the Chromium project about this, check it out here. Thanks for posting that Rich. MyCompany = { UI: {} }; // Put this here if you want to test the code. I create these namespaces elsewhere in code.

MyCompany.UI.Window = new function() {
    // Private fields
    var that = this;
    var windowHandles = {};

    // Public Members
    this.windowExists = function(windowTarget) {
        return windowTarget && windowHandles[windowTarget] && !windowHandles[windowTarget].closed;
    }

    this.open = function(url, windowTarget, windowProperties) {

@CONTENT:after some confusion in the comments to Is it safe to have 1 letter class names in PHP, e.g A, B, C I thought I make into a question. According to the PHP manual, a valid class name should match against [a-zA-Z_\x7f-\xff][a-zA-Z0-9_\x7f-\xff]*. But apparently, this is not enforced, nor does it apply for anything else: define('£k', pi());
var_dump(£k);

class ? {
    private $? = TRUE;
    public function ?()
    {
        return $this->?;
    }
}

$? = new ?;
var_dump($? );
var_dump($?->?());
 works fine (even though my IDE cannot show ?). Can some erudite person clear this up for me? Can we use any Unicode? And if so, since when? Not that I would actually want to use anything but A-Za-z_ but I'm curious. Clarification: I am not after a Regex to validate class names, nor do I know if PHP internally uses the Regex it suggests in the manual. The thing that confused me (and apparently the other guys in the linked question) is why things like $? = 1 can be used in PHP at all. PHP6 was suppposed to be the Unicode release but PHP6 is in hiatus. But if there is no Unicode support, why can I do this then?

For g++, make and gdb I installed msys and mingw according to this tutorial: http://wiki.wxwidgets.org/HowTo:_Install_MSYS_and_MinGW_for_use_with_Eclipse_CDT The versions are: make: GNU make 3.81 g++: 4.5.0 gdb: 7.1 So it should be compatible with my 64-bit CPU. However when I try to run a very simple program with eclipse, I see nothing on the console. The source code is: #include <iostream>

 using namespace std;

    int i;

    cout << "Enter an integer: " << endl;
    cin >> i;
    cout << endl << "i is " << i << endl;

    return 0;
 }
 The build is fine and when I launch the .exe with command (windows console) the behavior is as expected. But with the Eclipse console I see nothing with run and with debug the output is just: "Enter an integer: ", then when I type in a number and hit enter it does nothing. Does anyone know how to fix this please? Thanks, Guillaume PS: I use the toolchain "Linux GCC", with "MinGW GCC" I have nothing at all in the console.

@TITLE:How do YOU manage Perl modules when using a package manager?
@CONTENT:A recent question here on SO got me thinking. On most Linux distributions that I tried, some Perl modules would be available through the package manager. Others, of course, not. For quite a while I would use my package manager whenever I needed to install some CPAN module to find out whether a package was available or not and to install it when it was. The obvious advantage is that you get your modules updated whenever a new version of the package becomes available. However, you get in trouble when the module is not available in pre-packaged form and there are dependencies for that module that are. Firing up your package manager every time the cpan shell asks whether it should follow a dependency can be quite tiring. Often, another drawback is the version of the pre-packaged module. If you are running Debian or Ubuntu you will soon find out that you will not be able to live on the bleeding edge, like many CPAN module authors seem to do. How do other Perl people on Linux handle that problem? Do you just ignore what your package managers have to offer? Are there any tools that make apt (for example) and cpan better team mates? Or do you simply not install anything via the cpan shell?

@LINK:/questions/535464/when-not-to-use-prepared-statements
@TITLE:When *not* to use prepared statements?
@CONTENT:I'm re-engineering a PHP-driven web site which uses a minimal database. The original version used "pseudo-prepared-statements" (PHP functions which did quoting and parameter replacement) to prevent injection attacks and to separate database logic from page logic. It seemed natural to replace these ad-hoc functions with an object which uses PDO and real prepared statements, but after doing my reading on them, I'm not so sure. PDO still seems like a great idea, but one of the primary selling points of prepared statements is being able to reuse them¡K which I never will. Here's my setup: The statements are all trivially simple. Most are in the form SELECT foo,bar FROM baz WHERE quux = ? ORDER BY bar LIMIT 1. The most complex statement in the lot is simply three such selects joined together with UNION ALLs. Each page hit executes at most one statement and executes it only once. I'm in a hosted environment and therefore leery of slamming their servers by doing any "stress tests" personally. Given that using prepared statements will, at minimum, double the number of database round-trips I'm making, am I better off avoiding them? Can I use PDO::MYSQL_ATTR_DIRECT_QUERY to avoid the overhead of multiple database trips while retaining the benefit of parametrization and injection defense? Or do the binary calls used by the prepared statement API perform well enough compared to executing non-prepared queries that I shouldn't worry about it? EDIT: Thanks for all the good advice, folks. This is one where I wish I could mark more than one answer as "accepted" ¡X lots of different perspectives. Ultimately, though, I have to give rick his due¡K without his answer I would have blissfully gone off and done the completely Wrong Thing even after following everyone's advice. :-) Emulated prepared statements it is!

@CONTENT:As far as I know, most recursive functions can be rewritten using loops. Some maybe harder than others, but most of them can be rewritten. So the question is, under which conditions does it become impossible to rewrite a recursive function using a loop (if such conditions exist)? Clarification: I know how to convert a recursive function to use a loop, but I am asking whether there are (corner) cases where this is impossible.

@TITLE:How to open a second activity on click of button in android app
@CONTENT:I am learning to build android applications and I need some specific help. I can't seem to get my head around which bits of template code I am required to change, and which bits are static. In the LAYOUT folder I have my ACTIVITY_MAIN.XML which reads  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
 <LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
 xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
 android:layout_width="match_parent"
 android:layout_height="match_parent"
 android:orientation="horizontal">

 <Button
    android:id="@+id/button1"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:text="@string/main_buttons_photos" />

 </LinearLayout>
 Next, I have my second activity ACTIVITY_SEND_PHOTOS.XML which is  <RelativeLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
 xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
 android:layout_width="match_parent"
 android:layout_height="match_parent" >

 <TextView
    android:id="@+id/textView2"
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:layout_centerHorizontal="true"
    android:layout_centerVertical="true"
    android:text="@string/hello_world"
    tools:context=".SendPhotos" />

 <TextView
    android:id="@+id/textView1"
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:layout_alignParentLeft="true"
    android:layout_alignParentTop="true"
    android:text="@string/title_activity_send_photos"
    android:textAppearance="?android:attr/textAppearanceLarge" />

 </RelativeLayout>
 I then have my MainActivity.java (is this the .class?) this reads package com.example.assent.bc;  import android.os.Bundle;
 import android.app.Activity;
 import android.view.Menu;
 import android.view.View;

 public class MainActivity extends Activity {

 @Override
 public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
     super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
     setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
 }

 @Override
 public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu) {
     getMenuInflater().inflate(R.menu.activity_main, menu);
     return true;
 }
 /** Called when the user clicks the Send button */
 public void sendMessage(View view) {
     // Do something in response to button
 }
 }
 and then my SendPhotos.java file which is;  package com.example.assent.bc;

 import android.os.Bundle;
 import android.app.Activity;
 import android.view.Menu;
 import android.view.MenuItem;
 import android.support.v4.app.NavUtils;

 public class SendPhotos extends Activity {

 @Override
 public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_send_photos);
    getActionBar().setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabled(true);
 }

 @Override
 public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu) {
    getMenuInflater().inflate(R.menu.activity_send_photos, menu);
    return true;
 }


 @Override
 public boolean onOptionsItemSelected(MenuItem item) {
    switch (item.getItemId()) {
        case android.R.id.home:
            NavUtils.navigateUpFromSameTask(this);
            return true;
    }
    return super.onOptionsItemSelected(item);
 }

 }
 I would like the button in my main activity to link through to my sendphotos activity, simply opening up that activity, nothing fancy, not sending any data or anything. I know that somewhere I need my  Intent i = new Intent(FromActivity.this, ToActivity.class);
 startActivity(i);
 but I have no idea what to replace ToActivity.class with or what else I need where.

@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: How do I tell git to always select my local version for conflicted merges on a specific file? 1 answer I have two branches, A and B. Branch A have a directory examples with some files that are tracked by git, and these files should not appear on branch B. In my workflow, I do merge changes made in A into B often, which is a problem every time that there is some changes on examples. For the moment I am doing this manually: erasing the files after the merge or solving conflicts when there was a change to a file that I had already erased. Is it possible to ignore these files during a merge? (Or is it possible to keep some files restricted to one branch (A) or away from one branch (B)?) Let me try to explain why I am doing this: A is a skeleton of a blog (template, scripts, etc), B is my blog (A filled with my own posts, images, drafts, etc). A is public and I am trying to make it generic to others look and use it, but because of this I need some posts there as a showcase/tests (the examples directory). Every change in A and is later merged into B to have this changes on my blog instance -- this way all new examples appear in B and all deleted examples in B that have been changed in A since last merge results in a conflict.

    Root<T> root = criteria.from(entityClazz);

}
 And the error is: The method select(Selection<? extends T>) in the type CriteriaQuery<T> is not applicable for the arguments (Path<Object>). How should I change that? I want to get a type T object that has only ID and VERSION fields, and all others are null. Type T extends AbstractEntity which has those 2 fields. entityClazz is T.class.

The approach I am considering is for each string look at all other strings and find the common characters and where differing characters are, trying to find sets of strings that have the most in common, but I fear that this is not very efficient and may give false positives. Note that this is not the same as 'How do I detect groups of common strings in filenames' because that assumes that a string will always have a series of digits following it.

@TITLE:Retrieve latitude and longitude of a draggable pin via Google Maps API V3
@CONTENT:I will explain. I managed to have a draggable pin on a map. I want to retrieve the coordinates of this point and put them into two fields: Latitude and Longitude. These coordinates will later be send to a SQL table via PHP. Here is an example of what I intend to do, but instead of several pins, it's just one and it's draggable. The problem is: I'm not even able to display the coordinates of the initial point. And of course when the user moves the pin, I want the coordinates to change as well in the fields. I hope I made myself clear. What did I do wrong? Should I use the Geocoding service? Here goes the JS: <script type="text/javascript">
  var map;
  function initialize() {
  var myLatlng = new google.maps.LatLng(40.713956,-74.006653);

@CONTENT:I would like to define globals in a "programmatic" way. Something similar to what I want to do would be: definitions = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 123.4}
for definition in definitions.items():

 Specifically, I want to create a module fundamentalconstants that contains variables that can be accessed as fundamentalconstants.electron_mass, etc., where all values are obtained through parsing a file (hence the need to do the assignments in a "programmatic" way). Now, the exec solution above would work. But I am a little bit uneasy with it, because I'm afraid that exec is not the cleanest way to achieve the goal of setting module globals.

@LINK:/questions/19048985/angularjs-better-way-to-watch-for-height-change
@TITLE:AngularJS: Better way to watch for height change
@CONTENT:I'm having the old variable height navigation problem: A position: fixes navigation on top and a content with margin-top: $naviHeight below. The navigation can change height when data is loaded asynchronously and so the content's margin has to change with it. I want this to be self contained. So no code where the data is loaded but only in the involved html-elements/directives. Currently I'm doing it in AngularJS 1.2.0 with a timer like this: /*
* Get notified when height changes and change margin-top
 */
.directive( 'emHeightTarget', function(){
    return {
        link: function( scope, elem, attrs ){

            scope.$on( 'heightchange', function( ev, newHeight ){

                elem.attr( 'style', 'margin-top: ' + (58+newHeight) + 'px' );
            } );
        }
    }
})

/*
* Checks this element periodically for height changes
 */
.directive( 'emHeightSource', ['$timeout', function( $timeout ) {

    return {
        link: function( scope, elem, attrs ){

            function __check(){

                var h = elem.height();

                if( h != scope.__height ){

                    scope.__height = h;
                    scope.$emit( 'heightchange', h );
                }
                $timeout( __check, 1000 );
            }
            __check();
        }
    }

} ] )
 This has the obvious drawback of using the timer (which i feel kind of ugly) and a certain delay after the navigation resized until the content is moved. Is there a better way to do this?
@CODE:position: fixes margin-top: $naviHeight /*
* Get notified when height changes and change margin-top

.directive( 'emHeightTarget', function(){
    return {
        link: function( scope, elem, attrs ){

                elem.attr( 'style', 'margin-top: ' + (58+newHeight) + 'px' );
            } );
        }
    }
})

/*

 */
.directive( 'emHeightSource', ['$timeout', function( $timeout ) {

    return {
        link: function( scope, elem, attrs ){

            function __check(){

                var h = elem.height();

                if( h != scope.__height ){

                    scope.__height = h;

                }
                $timeout( __check, 1000 );
            }
            __check();
        }
    }

} ] )

At the moment, the easiest way I know of doing this involves manually pushing to the two (gitlab and the other) repository, but this is time consuming and error prone. The greatest problem is that a mirror can resynchronize is two users concurrently push changes to the two different repositories. The best method I can come up with to prevent this issue is to ensure users can only push to one of the repositories.

@TITLE:Using the Python NLTK (2.0b5) on the Google App Engine
@CONTENT:I have been trying to make the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) work on the Google App Engine. The steps I followed are: Download the installer and run it (a .dmg file, as I am using a Mac). copy the nltk folder out of the python site-packages directory and place it as a sub-folder in my project folder. Create a python module in the folder that contains the nltk sub-folder and add the line: from nltk.tokenize import * Unfortunately, after launching it I get this error (note that this error is raised deep within NLTK and I'm seeing it for my system installation of python as opposed to the one that is in the sub-folder of the GAE project):  <type 'exceptions.ImportError'>: No module named nltk

 Note: this is how the error looks in the logs when uploaded to GAE. If I run it locally I get the same error (except it seems to originate inside my site-packages instance of NLTK ... so no difference there). And "xxxx" signifies the project name. So in summary: Is what I am trying to do even possible? Will NLTK even run on the App Engine? Is there something I missed? That is: copying "nltk" to the GAE project isn't enough? EDIT: fixed typo and removed unnecessary step

After a few weeks I figured it out and wanted to share an extensive example since I couldn't find one. My goal is to give a thorough, instructive example of Video Toolbox introduced in WWDC 513. My code will not compile or run since it needs to be integrated with an elementary H.264 stream (like a video read from a file or streamed from online etc) and needs to be tweaked depending on the specific case. I should mention that I have very little experience with video en/decoding except what I learned while googling the subject. I don't know all the details about video formats, parameter structure etc. so I've only included what I think you need to know.

@TITLE:How to implement a ContentObserver for call logs
@CONTENT:I'd like to know if there is a way to know if the content provider of callings has changed. I mean, if I make a call, or I answer a call, it returns a "flag" that a new log has been added to the call log, or the place where Android store informations about callings. Because, when I make a call, Android stores the number, the contact name (if exists), the hour of the calling, the duration, ..., all in the content provider. So is there a way to capture this "flag" that says the content provider of callings is bigger, I mean, that a new data has been inserted on the content provider CallLog.Calls. So, I still have a lot of doubts related to this issue. I don't know where to register the content observer. My intention is, when something changes in the CallLog content provider, the insert method of the code will be used. I mean, the code won't do anything unless new data has been added to the CallLog content provider. If some data has been added to the CallLog content provider, then the code will query the new data, and then will insert. I wanna do this, because without a content observer the application was inserting data in the database that was already inserted every time I run the application, got it? So here is my code.

@TITLE:Fast transcendent / trigonometric functions for Java
@CONTENT:Since the trigonometric functions in java.lang.Math are quite slow: is there a library that does a quick and good approximation? It seems possible to do a calculation several times faster without losing much precision. (On my machine a multiplication takes 1.5ns, and java.lang.Math.sin 46ns to 116ns). Unfortunately there is not yet a way to use the hardware functions. UPDATE: The functions should be accurate enough, say, for GPS calculations. That means you would need at least 7 decimal digits accuracy, which rules out simple lookup tables. And it should be much faster than java.lang.Math.sin on your basic x86 system. Otherwise there would be no point in it. For values over pi/4 Java does some expensive computations in addition to the hardware functions. It does so for a good reason, but sometimes you care more about the speed than for last bit accuracy.

@TITLE:ld linker question: the --whole-archive option
@CONTENT:The only real use of the --whole-archive linker option that I have seen is in creating shared libraries from static ones. Recently I came across Makefile(s) which always use this option when linking with in house static libraries. This of course causes the executables to unnecessarily pull in unreferenced object code. My reaction to this was that this is plain wrong, am I missing something here ? The second question I have has to do with something I read regarding the whole-archive option but couldn't quite parse. Something to the effect that --whole-archive option should be used while linking with a static library if the executable also links with a shared library which in turn has (in part) the same object code as the static library. That is the shared library and the static library have overlap in terms of object code. Using this option would force all symbols(regardless of use) to be resolved in the executable. This is supposed to avoid object code duplication. This is confusing, if a symbol is refereed in the program it must be resolved uniquely at link time, what is this business about duplication ?

 But I haven't any clue of how to change the text color to black. Because after setting white drawable the problem is that text isn't visible because is white on white background.

@TITLE:Difference in JSON objects using Javascript/JQuery
@CONTENT:I have two JSON objects in Javascript, identical except for the numerical values. It looks like this: var data = {
  "eth0":{"Tx":"4136675","Rx":"13232319"},
  "eth1":{"Tx":"4","Rx":"0"},
  "lo":{"Tx":"471290","Rx":"471290"}
}

var old = {
  "eth0":{"Tx":"4136575","Rx":"13232219"},
  "eth1":{"Tx":"4","Rx":"0"},
  "lo":{"Tx":"471290","Rx":"471290"}
}
 One object called "data" has the current values, another object called "old" has the same values from 1 second ago. I'd like to output a JSON object with only the change in values so I can calculate data throughput on the network interfaces. var throughput = {
  "eth0":{"Tx":"100","Rx":"100"},
  "eth1":{"Tx":"0","Rx":"0"},
  "lo":{"Tx":"0","Rx":"0"}
}
 I'm not sure how to go about traversing the JSON data - it could be for any number of interfaces. Can anyone please lend me a hand? Thanks in advance

@CONTENT:I am trying to build a task killer type of app in android. I can show the list of currently running task using ActivityManager but facing problem in killing the task. Here is what i am doing to get the list of currently running task : ActivityManager am = (ActivityManager) context.

                appName=(String)     pack.getApplicationLabel(pack.getApplicationInfo(packageName,PackageManager.GET_META_DATA));

            } catch (NameNotFoundException e) {

                icons.add(d);               //arraylist of icons
        }
 It worked for me But now as I am trying to kill the task using killBackgroundProcesses : am.killBackgroundProcesses(package name);
 It did not work . Also killBackgroundProcesses method is available in API level 2.2 then how can i perform the same task in previous API level such as 1.6 etc. Is there any other way to show the currently active apps and kill them . Please help . Thanks a lot.

@TITLE:How to capture current view screenshot and reuse in code? (iPhone SDK)
@CONTENT:I am attemting to transition from one UIView to another, when the user rotates the device. This, in of itself, is not difficult. However, since I am displaying completely different content after the rotation, the default animation provided by UIKit (rotating the currently displayed view) is inappropriate conceptually. Simply disabling the animation and swapping the views suddenly is tolerable, but is far below the polish I'm building into the rest of the app. What I would prefer to do is this: When shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation: is called, I would like to grab an opaque view snapshot, a screenshot if you will, of the user view before rotation. Then after the rotation is completed and the system has applied the view transforms etc, I can show the snapshot view I saved and animate a transition of my choice to my new view. After it is completed, I can release my snapshot and move on. Is there a way to do this that is not expensive? The only other option I can think of is to return NO on all orientations other than my default one, and then react by applying my own animations and transforms. I'd prefer to use the system to do this however, as I feel it is likely doing it myself could cause "undefined" keyboard behavior in the manually rotated view, etc. Thoughts?

@TITLE:Capturing Sound for Analysis and Visualizing Frequencies in Android
@CONTENT:I'm new in Android and I'm trying to make a program which captures an audio sound and then displays the frequencies that exist within it. I found an example that draws the graphic portion of a graphic equalizer. In this example it is used an object of type AudioRecord to capture audio sound. The technique used to break an audio signal down into component frequencies employs a mathematic transformation called a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and to perform DFT it is used a fast Fourier transform (FFT). This example use a package which implements the FFT. The package is linked here www.netlib.org/fftpack/jfftpack.tgz. The problem is that after I run this example the graphic equalizer doesn't appear on the display after I press the start button.

@TITLE:how to show lines in common (reverse diff)?
@CONTENT:I have a series of text files for which I'd like to know the lines in common rather than the lines which are different between them. Command line unix or windows is fine. foo: linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007fffccffe000)

 So, given these two files above the output of the desired utility would be akin to file1:line_number, file2:line_number == matching text (just a suggestion, I really don't care what the syntax is): foo:1, bar:3 == linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007fffccffe000)

@CONTENT:By default, IIS6 does not serve .json (no wildcard MIME type). Therefore a 404 not found is thrown. I then add a new MIME type (.json, text/plain or application/x-javascript or application/json) which works fine. However, when you then add a new mapping (Home Directory -> Configuration -> Add) with .json, C:\WINDOWS\system32\inetsrv\asp.dll, "GET,POST" and try to browse to the file, you get a 404. If you remove the mapping and try and POST or GET to it, you get a 405. ... Suggestions?

@TITLE:Entity Framework code first many-to-many mapping table
@CONTENT:From examples that I have seen online and in a Programming Entity Framework CodeFirst book, when you have a collection on both classes EF would create a mapping table such as MembersRecipes and the primary key from each class would link to this table. However when I do the below, I instead get a new field in the Recipes table called Member_Id and a Recipe_Id in the Members table. Which only creates two one-to-many relationships, but not a many-to-many so I could have Member 3 linked to Recipes (4,5,6) and Recipe 4 linked to Members (1,2,3) etc. Is there a way to create this mapping table? and if so how do you name it something else such as "cookbooks" ? Thanks     public abstract class Entity {
        [Required]
        public int Id { get; set; }
    }   

    public class Member : Entity {

        public virtual Member Author { get; set; }

            ....

        public virtual IList<Member> Members { get; set; }
    }
 UPDATE: Below is another approach I have tried which doesn't use the Fluent API and replaces the AuthorId & Author on Recipe with an owner flag, I have also renamed the below example from Cookbooks to MembersRecipes, this also fixes my issue similar to the answer but as mentioned has further implications. public class MembersRecipes {

    [Key, Column(Order = 0)]
    [ForeignKey("Recipe")]
    public int RecipeId { get; set; }
    public virtual Recipe Recipe { get; set; }

    [ForeignKey("Member")]
    public int MemberId { get; set; }
    public virtual Member Member { get; set; }

    public bool Owner { get; set; }
}
 and in Recipe & Member classes I changed the collections to public virtual IList<MembersRecipes> MembersRecipes { get; set; }
@CODE:MembersRecipes Recipes Member_Id Recipe_Id Members public abstract class Entity {
        [Required]
        public int Id { get; set; }

 the font size and the orientation of the tick label is changed. However, if try: label.set_text('Foo')
 the tick label is not modified. Also if I do: print label.get_text()
 nothing is printed. Here's some more strangeness. When I tried this:  from pylab import *
 axes = figure().add_subplot(111)

 s = sin(2*pi*t)
 axes.plot(t, s)

 Only empty strings are printed, but the plot contains ticks labeled as '0.0', '0.5', '1.0', '1.5', and '2.0'.

 This works but contravenes Joshua Bloch's advice from Effective Java 2nd Edition (Item 57: Use exceptions only for exceptional conditions).

@CONTENT:In my iPhone OS application I want (need) to watch for changes in the device orientation in order to rearrange certain portions of the screen. The approach I used was to use CGRect frame = [UIScreen mainScreen].applicationFrame to get the screen size, and from there calculate the size and / or positioning of other controls (I also tried self.view.frame). All testing was done so far in Portrait mode, so I could focus on programming the main features and later on just do some adjustments for Landscape. And here enters the problem: In -(void) didRotateFromInterfaceOrientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation)fromInterfaceOrientation I added some logging to check the sizes before proceeding, but apparently the values for Width and Height are "wrong" (I say "wrong" because at a first glance the values does not make sense to me). Here's the output of some logging: Rotation: Landscape [w=300.000000, h=480.000000] Rotation: Portrait [w=320.000000, h=460.000000] The values for "w" and "h" in Landscape seem inverted to me - I was expecting that w=480 and h=300. What am I doing wrong? The code I used to debug is below. -(void) didRotateFromInterfaceOrientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation)fromInterfaceOrientation {

 Then I need to get back a list like this:  windows B is at (210,40)
 windows A is at (120,20)
 windows C is at (0,0)
 Then if the user (or the OS) brings the window A to the front, it becomes:  +------------------------------------------+

             |             |
             +-------------+
 And I get (ideally) a callback giving me this: windows A is at (120,20)
windows B is at (210,40)
windows C is at (0,0)
 Doing this under OS X requires the use of amazingly weird hacks (like mandating the user to turn on "Enable Access for assistive device"!) but I've done it under OS X and it works (under OS X, I didn't manage to get a callback everytime some window changes occurs, so I'm polling, but I got it to work). Now I want to do this under Windows (I really do, no question about it) and I've got a few questions: can this be done? are there well documented Windows APIs (and working as per their specs) allowing to do that? is it easy to register a callback everytime a window changes? (if it is resized, moved, brought to back/front or if a new window pops-up, etc.) what would the gotchas be? I know this question is not specific, which is why I've tried to describe my problem as clearly as possible (including nice ASCII art for which you can upvote this): for now I'm looking at the "big picture". I want to know what doing such a thing involves under Windows. Bonus question: imagine you'd need to write a tiny .exe writing the windows names/position/size to a temporary file everytime there's a window change on screen, how long would such a program be approximately in your language of choice and how long would you need to write it? (once again, I'm trying to get the "big picture" to understand what is at work here)

@TITLE:What kind of prefix do you use for member variables?
@CONTENT:No doubt, it's essential for understanding code to give member variables a prefix so that they can easily be distinguished from "normal" variables. But what kind of prefix do you use? I have been working on projects where we used m_ as prefix, on other projects we used an underscore only (which I personally don't like, because an underscore only is not demonstrative enough). On another project we used a long prefix form, that also included the variable type. mul_ for example is the prefix of a member variable of type unsigned long. Now let me know what kind of prefix you use (and please give a reason for it). EDIT: Most of you seem to code without special prefixes for member variables! Does this depend on the language? From my experience, C++ code tends to use an underscore or m_ as a prefix for member variables. What about other languages?

@CONTENT:I'm attempting to create an <iframe> using JavaScript, then append a <script> element to that <iframe>, which I want to run in the context of the <iframe>d document.

Edit: following the response from @John Saunders I attempted to alter my code to use a wsHttpBinding var wsHttpBinding = new WSHttpBinding(SecurityMode.Transport);
wsHttpBinding.Security.Transport.ClientCredentialType =
                                         HttpClientCredentialType.Basic;
 Using this binding the SOAP message becomes <s:Envelope xmlns:s="http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope" xmlns:a="http://www.w3.org/2005/08/addressing">
  <s:Header>

 This adds the Header element, as opposed to the wsse:UsernameToken element for reference the original soap message using the BasicHttpBinding is <s:Envelope xmlns:s="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">

 This seems to be very close however this appears to have actually encrypted the body of the soap message which is something I do NOT want to happen. If I specify wsHttpBinding.Security.Message.ClientCredentialType = MessageCredentialType.UserName; with only using SecurityMode.Transport it goes back to where it says its anonymous. What is the final hurdle I'm not able to clear on this? Final Solution: Figured I'd post this incase it helps someone, there's not really much different here other the UserToken object is wrapped in a Security node which is what my service provider required and seems to be how it's output from my previous examples from what I could get generated. <system.serviceModel>

@TITLE:Fastest way to clamp a real (fixed/floating point) value?
@CONTENT:Is there a more efficient way to clamp real numbers than using if statements or ternary operators? I want to do this both for doubles and for a 32-bit fixpoint implementation (16.16). I'm not asking for code that can handle both cases; they will be handled in separate functions. Obviously, I can do something like: double clampedA;
double a = calculate();
clampedA = a > MY_MAX ? MY_MAX : a;
clampedA = a < MY_MIN ? MY_MIN : a;
 or double a = calculate();
double clampedA = a;
if(clampedA > MY_MAX)
    clampedA = MY_MAX;
else if(clampedA < MY_MIN)
    clampedA = MY_MIN;
 The fixpoint version would use functions/macros for comparisons. This is done in a performance-critical part of the code, so I'm looking for an as efficient way to do it as possible (which I suspect would involve bit-manipulation) EDIT: It has to be standard/portable C, platform-specific functionality is not of any interest here. Also, MY_MIN and MY_MAX are the same type as the value I want clamped (doubles in the examples above).
@CODE:double clampedA;
double a = calculate();
clampedA = a > MY_MAX ? MY_MAX : a;
clampedA = a < MY_MIN ? MY_MIN : a; double a = calculate();
double clampedA = a;
if(clampedA > MY_MAX)
    clampedA = MY_MAX;
else if(clampedA < MY_MIN)

@TITLE:Invoking Java main method with parameters from Eclipse
@CONTENT:During development (and for debugging) it is very useful to run a Java class' public static void main(String[] argv) method directly from inside Eclipse (using the Run As context menu). Is there a similarily quick way to specify command line parameters for the run? What I do now is go to the "Run Dialog", click through the various settings to the tab where I can specify VM and program arguments and enter them there. Too many steps, plus I do not want to mix the more permanent runtime configuration settings with the one-off invokation parameters. What I want instead is to check a box somewhere (or have a separate menu item "Run as Java application with command line") and then be prompted for the commandline every time (with a nice history).

@TITLE:Argument-parsing helpers for C/UNIX
@CONTENT:I know of the following: the venerable getopt(3) the extended getopt_long glibc's argp parser for unix-style argument vectors popt from the GNOME project (or its spiritual successor in Glib) I'm sure there's more that I haven't used or even heard of; a quick Google search reveals Gopt, argtable, and Optlist. Personally, I like argp best, and every program I wrote using getopt/getopt_long (beyond a certain baseline of complexity) has been converted to use argp. It's more widely available than popt, more powerful than getopt_long, well-documented, consistent with all the GNU-style conventions, and very flexible. On the downside, it's far from the easiest to use (thanks to being so flexible), and the code to support it is quite verbose (as are many things in C). What do you use, and why? Edit Yes, I mean C rather than C++. There's a ton of C++ parsers, but I don't use C++. John Millikin notes that popt is no longer maintained. I list it because many programs still use it -- including AbiWord, rpm, rsync, and samba -- despite Gnome's efforts to migrate away. But I've added a link to Glib's argument parser now, too. For C++ argument parsing, see the question What parameter parser libraries are there for C++?

Contravariance allows a "smaller" (more specific) type to be substituted in an API where the original type is only used in an "input" position. i know it has to do with type safety. about the in/out thing. can i say i use in when i need to write to it, and out when its read only. and in means contra-variance, out co-variance. but from the explanation above... and here For example, a List<Banana> can't be treated as a List<Fruit> because list.Add(new Apple()) is valid for List but not for List<Banana>. so shouldn't it be, if i were to use in/ am going to write to the object, it must be bigger more generic. i know this question has been asked but still very confused.

@TITLE:Pattern ¡§One activity, multiple views¡¨: Advantages and disadvantages
@CONTENT:This pattern is similar to the pattern Main Servlet (the Front Controller) that is used for developing web applications. The main idea of this pattern: we have one Activity that manages multiple views and this activity is responsible for representing current content. Not all views need functional of activity (e.g. life-cycle methods) so the main question is: if I can go without activity why do I have to use it? I have found the following disadvantages of using this pattern: Official source doesn't recommend to Overload a Single Activity Screen but they don't explain why. We cannot use TabActivity, ListActivity, MapActivity. But there are some tricks to go without them. If different screens have different menu it's a problem to make that without activities. It is necessary to keep history by ourselves. But it's not so difficult to develop. I have found the following advantages of using this pattern: It's faster to change the content of current activity than to start another activity We are free to manage history as we want If we have only one activity-context it's simpler to find and solve problems with memory leaks What do you think about this pattern ? Could you provide any other advantages/disadvantages ?

@CONTENT:The "party model" is a "pattern" for relational database design. At least part of it involves finding commonality between many entities, such as Customer, Employee, Partner, etc., and factoring that into some more "abstract" database tables. I'd like to find out your thoughts on the following: What are the core principles and motivating forces behind the party model? What does it prescribe you do to your data model? (My bit above is pretty high level and quite possibly incorrect in some ways. I've been on a project that used it, but I was working with a separate team focused on other issues). What has your experience led you to feel about it? Did you use it, and if so, would you do so again? What were the pros and cons? Did the party model limit your choice of ORMs? For example, did you have to eliminate certain ORMs because they didn't allow for enough of an "abstraction layer" between your domain objects and your physical data model? I'm sure every response won't address every one of those questions ... but anything touching on one or more of them is going to help me make some decisions I'm facing. Thanks.

@TITLE:Why a non-final ¡§local¡¨ variable cannot be used inside an inner class, and instead a non-final field of the enclosing class can?
@CONTENT:There are some topics on Stack Overflow on the compiler error Cannot refer to a non-final variable message inside an inner class defined in a different method and the solution is "declare it as final and you're done", but with this theoretical question I would like to inspect what is the logical reason why this code cannot compile: private void updateStatus(String message) {
    Runnable doUpdateStatus = new Runnable() {
         public void run() {
             /* do something with message */
         }
    }
    /* do something with doUpdateStatus, like SwingUtilities.invokeLater() */
}
 (solution: declare message as final) whereas this one does: private String enclosingClassField;
private void updateStatus() {
    Runnable doUpdateStatus = new Runnable() {
         public void run() {
             /* do something with enclosingClassField */
         }
    }
    /* do something with doUpdateStatus, like SwingUtilities.invokeLater() */
}
 I'm really confused. enclosingClassField is not final, it can change every time many times, whereas the poor message argument of updateStatus can only change within its method body, and is instead blamed by the compiler ;) Even the compiler error is misleading to me. Cannot refer to a non-final variable message inside an inner class defined in a different method: Different from what? Isn't message defined in the same method as the inner class? Isn't enclosingClassField instead defined outside the method? Uhm... Can someone point me to the correct interpretation of this matter? Thanks.

@TITLE:WPF Treeview Databinding Hierarchal Data with mixed types
@CONTENT:I have a bit of a complex situation with WPF Treeview Binding. I have spent the last 2 days trying Google it, and this is the closed I came up with, but it doesn't solve the issue. Here is the situation: I have an object that looks like this: public class Category
{
  public string Name { get; set; }
  public List<Category> Categories { get; set; }
  public List<Product> Products { get; set; }
}

public class Product
{
  public string Name { get; set;
}
 Each Category can have a list of objects, and child categories. I have a reason for doing this that makes complete sense to me, and the app I am writing. The actual object construction may look Something like this: Category - Pharmacy
  |-Product - Aspirin
  |-Product - Tylenol
  |-Category - Tooth Paste
  |  |-Product - Crest
  |  |-Product - Colgate
  |-Category - Paper Products
   |-Category - Toilet Paper
   |  |-Product - NoName
   |  |-Product - Charmin
   |-Category - Facial Tissue
      |-Product - Kleenex
Category - Household
  |-Product - Pinesol Cleaner
  |-Product - Garbage Bags
 Now, I am trying to databind this relationship to a treeview. I would like the TreeView to look almost identical to the above object construct. So far I have my XAML Treeview look like this:   <TreeView x:Name="CategoryList" Margin="8" Grid.Row="2" Grid.RowSpan="2" ItemsSource="{Binding Path=Categories}">
            <TreeView.Resources>
                <HierarchicalDataTemplate DataType="{x:Type src:Category}" ItemsSource="{Binding Products}">
                    <StackPanel>
                        <TextBlock Text="{Binding Path=Name}" />
                    </StackPanel>
                </HierarchicalDataTemplate>
                <HierarchicalDataTemplate DataType="{x:Type src:Product}">
                    <StackPanel>
                        <TextBlock Text="{Binding Path=Name}" />
                    </StackPanel>
                </HierarchicalDataTemplate>
            </TreeView.Resources>
        </TreeView>
 This works great for the main list of Categories, and each of it's sub products. But it doesn't go deeper and display the sub categories under each category. Is there any way to do this directly with Templates so that each item (category or product) is selected? I am using an MVVM pattern and don't want to resort to using the code behind, but will if it is necessary.

{
  public string Name { get; set; }
  public List<Category> Categories { get; set; }

@TITLE:Listing available com ports with Python
@CONTENT:I am searching for a simple method to list all available com port on a PC. I have found this method but it is windows specific : Listing serial (COM) ports on Windows? I am using python 3 with pyserial on an win7 (windows seven) PC. I have found in the pyserial API (http://pyserial.sourceforge.net/pyserial_api.html) a function serial.tools.list_ports.comports() that lists com ports (exactly what I want). import serial.tools.list_ports
print(list(serial.tools.list_ports.comports()))
 But it seems that it doesn't work fine. When my USB to COM gateway is connected to the PC (I see the COM5 in the Device Manager), I haven't this COM port. I have just the COM4 wich seems to be connected to a modem (I don't see it in the COM&LPT section of Device Manager!!) Do you know why it doesn't work ? Have you got another solution wich is not system specific ? Thanks

@TITLE:Proper DataGrid search from TextBox in WPF using MVVM
@CONTENT:I apologize in advanced if this is not a good question, this is my first post on this forum. I have been researching this for a few days, but there seem to be so many opinions on MVVM, and I don't have the experience to chose the "correct" one. I am new to the MVVM pattern, and a little confused on when, and when not to use Code Behind. I have a very simple form right now, that includes one TextBox, and one DataGrid. What I would like is to be able to have the DataGrid change its selected item based on the TextBox. I have done this in Code Behind and it works fine using the following code: private void textBox1_TextChanged(object sender, TextChangedEventArgs e)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < dataGrid1.Items.Count; i++)
    {
        string cellContent = dtReferral.Rows[i][0].ToString();
        try
        {
            if (cellContent != null && cellContent.Substring(0, textBox1.Text.Length).Equals(textBox1.Text))
            {
                object item = dataGrid1.Items[i];
                dataGrid1.SelectedItem = item;
                dataGrid1.ScrollIntoView(item);
                //row.MoveFocus(new TraversalRequest(FocusNavigationDirection.Next));
                break;
            }
        }
        catch { }
    }
}
 Now, if I understand correctly (which I probably do not), then I should keep my code behind clean. I can do this with a ICollectionView for filtering, however I don't want filtering, I just want to highlight the Item in the Datagrid that starts with text in textbox, and allow the user to press a button to edit selected item. My question is, is it Ok to have this logic in the Code Behind file, since it is only manipulating the UI, or would I need to do this through some sort of binding. If I should do this through the View Model with Binding, any direction would be appreciated. Thank you.
@CODE:private void textBox1_TextChanged(object sender, TextChangedEventArgs e)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < dataGrid1.Items.Count; i++)
    {
        string cellContent = dtReferral.Rows[i][0].ToString();

        {
            if (cellContent != null && cellContent.Substring(0, textBox1.Text.Length).Equals(textBox1.Text))

I'm using the Apache POI library to write an Excel file with a large data set retrieved from a ResultSet object. The data could range from a few thousand records to about 1 million; not sure how this translates into file system bytes in Excel format. The following is a test code I wrote to check out the time taken to write such a large result set and also the performance implication w.r.t CPU & Memory. protected void writeResultsetToExcelFile(ResultSet rs, int numSheets, String fileNameAndPath) throws Exception {

        Cell cell = heading.createCell(x+1);
        cell.setCellValue(rsmd.getColumnLabel(x+1));
    }

    int rowNumber = 2;
    int sheetNumber = 0;

    while(rs.next()) {

        if(rowNumber == 65001) {

        Row row = wb.getSheetAt(sheetNumber).createRow(rowNumber);

        rowNumber++;
    }

    //wb.write(bos);

    bos.close();
}
 Not much luck with the above code. The file which is created seems to grow rapidly (~70Mb per sec). So I stopped the execution after about 10 minutes (killed the JVM when the file reaches 7Gb) and tried to open the file in Excel 2007. The moment I open it, the file size becomes 8k(!) and only the header and the first row are created. Not sure what I'm missing here. Any ideas?

@TITLE:Is there a browser equivalent to IE's ClearAuthenticationCache?
@CONTENT:I have a few internal .net web application here that require users to "log out" of them. I know this may seem moot on an Intranet application, but nonetheless it is there. We are using Windows authentication for our Intranet apps, so we tie in to our Active Directory with Basic Authentication and the credentials get stored in the browser cache, as opposed to a cookie when using .net forms authentication. In IE6+ you can leverage a special JavaScript function they created by doing the following: document.execCommand("ClearAuthenticationCache", "false")
 However, for the other browsers that are to be supported (namely Firefox at the moment, but I strive for multi-browser support), I simply display message to the user that they need to close their browser to log out of the application, which effectively flushes the application cache. Does anybody know of some commands/hacks/etc. that I can use in other browsers to flush the authentication cache?

@CONTENT:I have the following table in a SQL Server 2008 database: Id  Name       ParentFolder
--  ----       ------------
1   Europe     NULL
2   Asia       NULL
3   Germany    1
4   UK         1
5   China      2

 ParentFolder is a FK to Id in the same table. I would like to create a view that results in something like this: Id  Name       FullName
--  ----       --------
1   Europe     Europe
2   Asia       Asia
3   Germany    Europe/Germany
4   UK         Europe/UK
5   China      Asia/China
6   India      Asia/India
7   Scotland   Europe/UK/Scotland
 As you can see, I need to build the FullName values by recursively using the ParentFolder relationship an arbitrary number of times until a NULL is found. Edit. Each row in the table "knows" what other row is its parent, but does not know its absolute position in the hierarchy. For this reason, a lineage system where each row stores its absolute location in the hierarchy tree would not be appropriate. I am aware of the hierarchyid feature of SQL Server 2008 but, as far as I know, it only works with a fixed number of recursion levels. In my case, however, you never know how many levels you will find, and they may change from row to row. I have also seen similar questions to this posted here. However, I think that nobody asked about building "paths" for each row in a table. Sorry if I missed it. Many thanks.

@TITLE:Validate object based on external factors (ie. data store uniqueness)
@CONTENT:Description My solution has these projects: DAL = Modified Entity Framework DTO = Data Transfer objects that are able to validate themselves BL = Business Layer Services WEB = presentation Asp.net MVC application DAL, BL and WEB all reference DTO which is great. The process usually executes this way: A web request is made to the WEB WEB gets DTOs posted DTOs get automagically validated via custom ActionFilter validation errors are auto-collected (Validation is OK) WEB calls into BL providing DTOs BL calls into DAL by using DTOs (can either pass them through or just use them) DTO Validation problem then... My DTOs are able to validate themselves based on their own state (properties' values). But right now I'm presented with a problem when this is not the case. I need them to validate using BL (and consequently DAL). My real-life example: User registers and WEB gets a User DTO that gets validated. The problematic part is username validation. Its uniqueness should be checked against data store. How am I supposed to do this? There's additional info that all DTOs implement an interface (ie. User DTO implements IUser) for IoC purposes and TDD. Both are part of the DTO project. Impossible tries I can't reference BL in DTO because I'll get circular reference. Compilation error I can't create an additional DTO.Val project that would reference partial DTO classes and implement their validation there (they'd reference BL + DTO). Partial classes can't span assemblies. Possible tries Create a special ActionFilter that would validate object against external conditions. This one would be created within WEB project thus seeing DTO and BL that would be used here. Put DTOs in BL and keep DTO interfaces as actual DTOs referenced by other projects and refactor all code to use interfaces instead of concrete classes. Don't handle external dependant validation and let external dependencies throw an exception - probably the worst solution to this issue What would you suggest?

@TITLE:Android multiple databases open
@CONTENT:I am making a IM client for android and I am working with databases for storing the contacts and other info's... In my app I have an activity and one service. I need to open three databases in the same time both on the service and on the activity. I use three database because I want the databases to be managed more easily without having problems with the synchronization of writing in them. (as far as I know I need to write in the database synchronously because it may crush). To manage the databases from the service and from the activity in the same time, I thought that a singleton or a static class of DatabaseHelper could help me... So I have started to make a test by making two databasehelper global objects in the activity, each one opens a diferent database, after running the project i've noticed that the last opened database remains opened in both objects :((, why is this happening? Can somebody sugest me how can i make this work? Thank you! L.E.: after more tests, I made a Static object of databasehelper, open a service from which I take the database object from activity and in the same time i made two for statements, one in activity and one in service that run from 0 to 3000 and adds some values into the same database and then it reads the database. After this run i noticed that the database is still in feet and running without errors. The strange thing is that the service for is running only after the activity for finishes the job. Why is that? Thank you!

One of the more discouraging messages was: Exceptions.DontSwallowErrorsCatchingNonspecificExceptionsRule  : 2106 defects
 The developers assure me they had good reason for all the empty catch blocks, that sometimes the try with empty catch blocks are just there to ignore useless exceptions and keep the application from crashing. I feel this is a cop out and complete BS. Some of the examples I actually looked up were database calls where the record was being saved to the database, and in this case, if an exception was ignored, the user would get back an okay prompt, think everything was okay, and continue on with their work. In reality, their work was never saved. I think this is absolutely the most horrible kind of error. In this case, they are completely wrong in throwing that code in a try with an empty catch block. But my question is, "Is this EVER acceptable in ANY situation?" I think not, but I've been known to be wrong.

@TITLE:Why can't I convert 'char**' to a 'const char* const*' in C?
@CONTENT:The following code snippet (correctly) gives a warning in C and an error in C++ (using gcc & g++ respectively, tested with versions 3.4.5 and 4.2.1; MSVC does not seem to care): char **a;
const char** b = a;
 I can understand and accept this. The C++ solution to this problem is to change b to be a const char * const *, which disallows reassignment of the pointers and prevents you from circumventing const-correctness (C++ FAQ). char **a;
const char* const* b = a;
 However, in pure C, the corrected version (using const char * const *) still gives a warning, and I don't understand why. Is there a way to get around this without using a cast? To clarify: 1) Why does this generate a warning in C? It should be entirely const-safe, and the C++ compiler seems to recognize it as such. 2) What is the correct way to go about accepting this char** as a parameter while saying (and having the compiler enforce) that I will not be modifying the characters it points to? For example, if I wanted to write a function: void f(const char* const* in) {
  // Only reads the data from in, does not write to it
}
 And I wanted to invoke it on a char**, what would be the correct type for the parameter? Edit: Thank you to those who have responded, particularly those who addressed the question and/or followed up on my responses. I've accepted the answer that what I want to do cannot be done without a cast, regardless of whether or not it should be possible.

@TITLE:Javascript: find the time left in a setTimeout()?
@CONTENT:I'm writing some Javascript that interacts with library code that I don't own, and can't (reasonably) change. It creates Javascript timeouts used for showing the next question in a series of time-limited questions. This isn't real code because it is obfuscated beyond all hope. Here's what the library is doing: ....
// setup a timeout to go to the next question based on user-supplied time
var t = questionTime * 1000
test.currentTimeout = setTimeout( showNextQuestion(questions[i+1]), t );
 I want to put a progress bar onscreen that fills towards questionTime * 1000 by interrogating the timer created by setTimeout. The only problem is, there seems to be no way to do this. Is there a getTimeout function that I'm missing? The only information on Javascript timeouts that I can find is related only to creation via setTimeout( function, time) and deletion via clearTimeout( id ). I'm looking for a function that returns either the time remaining before a timeout fires, or the time elapsed after a timeout has been called. My progress bar code looks like this: var  timeleft = getTimeout( test.currentTimeout ); // I don't know how to do this
var  $bar = $('.control .bar');
while ( timeleft > 1 ) {
    $bar.width(timeleft / test.defaultQuestionTime * 1000);
}
 tl;dr: How do I find the time remaining before a javascript setTimeout()? Here's the solution I'm using now. I went through the library section that's in charge of tests, and unscrambled the code (terrible, and against my permissions). // setup a timeout to go to the next question based on user-supplied time
var t = questionTime * 1000
test.currentTimeout = mySetTimeout( showNextQuestion(questions[i+1]), t );
 and here's my code: // wrapper for setTimeout
function mySetTimeout( func, timeout ) {
    timeouts[ n = setTimeout( func, timeout ) ] = {
        start: new Date().getTime(),
        end: new Date().getTime() + timeout
        t: timeout
    }
    return n;
} This works pretty spot-on in any browser that isn't IE 6. Even the original iPhone, where I expected things to get asynchronous.
@CODE:....
// setup a timeout to go to the next question based on user-supplied time
var t = questionTime * 1000
test.currentTimeout = setTimeout( showNextQuestion(questions[i+1]), t ); questionTime * 1000 setTimeout getTimeout setTimeout( function, time) clearTimeout( id ) var  timeleft = getTimeout( test.currentTimeout ); // I don't know how to do this
var  $bar = $('.control .bar');
while ( timeleft > 1 ) {
    $bar.width(timeleft / test.defaultQuestionTime * 1000);
} // setup a timeout to go to the next question based on user-supplied time

@TITLE:std::vector, default construction, C++11 and breaking changes
@CONTENT:I ran today against a quite subtle issue I'd like to have your opinion on. Consider the following garden-variety shared-body-idiom class: struct S
{
    S() : p_impl(new impl) {}
private:
    struct impl;
    boost::shared_ptr<impl> p_impl;
};
 The fun appears when you try to put those into vectors in the following way: std::vector<S> v(42);
 Now, with MSVC 8 at least, all the elements in v share the same impl member. Actually, what causes this is the vector constructor: template <typename T, typename A = ...>
class vector
{
    vector(size_t n, const T& x = T(), const A& a = A());
    ...
};
 Under the scenes, only one S object gets default constructed, the n elements of the vector are copied from it. Now, with C++11, there are rvalue references. So it cannot work like this. If a vector is constructed as std::vector<S> v(42);
 then most likely, implementations will chose to default construct the n objects inside the vector, since copy construction may not be available. This would be a breaking change in this case. My question is: Does the C++03 standard mandates that std::vector must have a constructor defined as above, ie. with a default argument ? In particular is there a guarantee that the entries of the vector object get copied instead of default constructed ? What does the C++11 standard say about this same point ? I see this as a possibility for a breaking change between C++03 and C+11. Has this issue been investigated ? Solved ? PS: Please no comments about the default constructor of the class S above. It was this or implementing some form of lazy construction.
@CODE:struct S
{
    S() : p_impl(new impl) {}
private:
    struct impl;
    boost::shared_ptr<impl> p_impl;
}; std::vector<S> v(42); v impl vector template <typename T, typename A = ...>
class vector
{
    vector(size_t n, const T& x = T(), const A& a = A());
    ...
}; S n vector vector std::vector<S> v(42); n std::vector S

@CONTENT:I saw a function declaration in our code that looked as follows void error(char const *msg, bool showKind = true, bool exit);
 I thought first that this is an error because you cannot have default arguments in the middle of functions, but the compiler accepted this declaration. Has anyone seen this before? I'm using GCC4.5. Is this a GCC extension? The weird thing is, if I take this out in a separate file and try to compile, GCC rejects it. I've double checked everything, including the compiler options used.

@LINK:/questions/2175080/sscanf-in-python
@TITLE:sscanf in Python
@CONTENT:I'm looking for an equivalent to sscanf() in Python. I want to parse /proc/net/* files, in C I could do something like this: int matches = sscanf(
        buffer,
        "%*d: %64[0-9A-Fa-f]:%X %64[0-9A-Fa-f]:%X %*X %*X:%*X %*X:%*X %*X %*d %*d %ld %*512s\n",
        local_addr, &local_port, rem_addr, &rem_port, &inode);
 I thought at first to use str.split, however it doesn't split on the given characters, but the sep string as a whole: >>> lines = open("/proc/net/dev").readlines()
>>> for l in lines[2:]:
>>>     cols = l.split(string.whitespace + ":")
>>>     print len(cols)
1
 Which should be returning 17, as explained above. Is there a Python equivalent to sscanf (not RE), or a string splitting function in the standard library that splits on any of a range of characters that I'm not aware of?

@LINK:/questions/8474100/where-you-can-and-cannot-declare-new-variables-in-c
@TITLE:Where you can and cannot declare new variables in C?
@CONTENT:I heard (probably from a teacher) that one should declare all variables on top of the program/function, and that declaring new ones among the statements could cause problems. But then I was reading K&R and I came across this sentence: "Declarations of variables (including initializations) may follow the left brace that introduces any compound statement, not just the one that begins a function". He follows with an example: if (n > 0){
    int i;
    for (i=0;i<n;i++)
    ...
}
 I played a bit with the concept, and it works even with arrays. For example: int main(){
    int x = 0 ;

    while (x<10){
        if (x>5){
            int y[x];
            y[0] = 10;
            printf("%d %d\n",y[0],y[4]);
        }
        x++;
    }
}
 So when exactly I am not allowed to declare variables? For example, what if my variable declaration is not right after the opening brace? Like here: int main(){
    int x = 10;

    x++;
    printf("%d\n",x);

    int z = 6;
    printf("%d\n",z);
}
 Could this cause trouble depending on the program/machine?
@CODE:if (n > 0){
    int i;
    for (i=0;i<n;i++)
    ...
} int main(){
    int x = 0 ;

    while (x<10){
        if (x>5){
            int y[x];
            y[0] = 10;
            printf("%d %d\n",y[0],y[4]);
        }
        x++;
    }
} int main(){
    int x = 10;

    x++;
    printf("%d\n",x);

    int z = 6;
    printf("%d\n",z);

 I see three types of situations that cause scrolling in a browser. The user performs some action. For example, uses mousewheel, arrow keys, page up/down keys, home/end keys. The browser scrolls automatically. For example, when using the back button in your browser it will jump to the last known scroll position automatically. Javascript scrolls. For example, element.scrollTo(x,y).

@CONTENT:This isn't a design question, really, though it may seem like it. (Well, okay, it's kind of a design question). What I'm wondering is why the C++ std::fstream classes don't take a std::string in their constructor or open methods. Everyone loves code examples so: #include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <string>

int main()
{
    std::string filename = "testfile";      
    std::ifstream fin;

    fin.open(filename.c_str()); // Works just fine.
    fin.close();

    //fin.open(filename); // Error: no such method.
    //fin.close();
}
 This gets me all the time when working with files. Surely the C++ library would use std::string wherever possible?
@CODE:std::fstream std::string #include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <string>

int main()
{
    std::string filename = "testfile";

@TITLE:Is Google's Android OpenGL tutorial teaching incorrect linear algebra?
@CONTENT:After helping another user with a question regarding the Responding to Touch Events Android tutorial, I downloaded the source code, and was quite baffled by what I saw. The tutorial seems to not be able to decide whether it wants to use row vectors or column vectors, and it looks all mixed up to me. On the Android Matrix page, they claim that their convention is column-vector/column-major, which is typical of OpenGL. Am I right, or is there something I am missing? Here are the relevant bits of it: Start out by creating a MVPMatrix by multiplying mProjMatrix * mVMatrix. So far so good.     // Set the camera position (View matrix)
    Matrix.setLookAtM(mVMatrix, 0, 0, 0, -3, 0f, 0f, 0f, 0f, 1.0f, 0.0f);

    // Calculate the projection and view transformation
    Matrix.multiplyMM(mMVPMatrix, 0, mProjMatrix, 0, mVMatrix, 0)
 Next they are appending a rotation to the left hand side of the MVPMatrix? This seems a little weird.     // Create a rotation for the triangle
    Matrix.setRotateM(mRotationMatrix, 0, mAngle, 0, 0, -1.0f);

    // Combine the rotation matrix with the projection and camera view
    Matrix.multiplyMM(mMVPMatrix, 0, mRotationMatrix, 0, mMVPMatrix, 0)
 Uploading in non-transposed order.     GLES20.glUniformMatrix4fv(mMVPMatrixHandle, 1, false, mvpMatrix, 0);
 Finally in their shader, a vector*matrix multiplication?     // the matrix must be included as a modifier of gl_Position
    "  gl_Position = vPosition * uMVPMatrix;" 
 Adding this all together, we get: gl_Position = vPosition * mRotation * mProjection * mView;
 Which is not correct by any stretch of my imagination. Is there any explanation that I'm not seeing as to what's going on here?
@CODE:// Set the camera position (View matrix)
    Matrix.setLookAtM(mVMatrix, 0, 0, 0, -3, 0f, 0f, 0f, 0f, 1.0f, 0.0f);

    // Calculate the projection and view transformation

@TITLE:Apache HttpClient 4.0.3 - how do I set cookie with sessionID for POST request
@CONTENT:can you tell me how to store jsessionid in cookie, so it can be passed to the servlet with post request? I'm using Apache HttpClient version 4.0.3. All the solutions I've found explains how to do this with HttpClient 3.1. I've read tutorial and tried this, but it isn't working. HttpPost httppost = new HttpPost(postData);
CookieStore cookieStore = new BasicCookieStore();
BasicClientCookie cookie = new BasicClientCookie("JSESSIONID", getSessionId());
cookieStore.addCookie(cookie);
client.setCookieStore(cookieStore);
response = client.execute(httppost);
 Edit - further explanations I'm connecting to servlets written by friend. I've logged in and obtained jsessionid. Now I want to send another request and need to pass jsessionid for authorization purpose. Servlet works fine because I used java HttpURLConnection, set the cookie, passed it and it worked. Now with HttpClient I get no exceptions but the return code from friend's servlet indicates that there was no sessionid in the request. Another Edit - I've got one solution I set the parameter of request header and it worked. Servlet recognized sessionid. httppost.setHeader("Cookie", "JSESSIONID="+ getSessionId()); Now my question is: Is this method correct?
@CODE:HttpPost httppost = new HttpPost(postData);
CookieStore cookieStore = new BasicCookieStore();
BasicClientCookie cookie = new BasicClientCookie("JSESSIONID", getSessionId());
cookieStore.addCookie(cookie);
client.setCookieStore(cookieStore);
response = client.execute(httppost); jsessionid httppost.setHeader("Cookie", "JSESSIONID="+ getSessionId());

@TITLE:Can I specify my explicit type comparator inline?
@CONTENT:So .NET 3.0/3.5 provides us with lots of new ways to query, sort, and manipulate data, thanks to all the neat functions supplied with LINQ. Sometimes, I need to compare user-defined types that don't have a built-in comparison operator. In many cases, the comparison is really simple -- something like foo1.key ?= foo2.key. Rather than creating a new IEqualityComparer for the type, can I simply specify the comparison inline using anonymous delegates/lambda functions? Something like: var f1 = ...,
    f2 = ...;
var f3 = f1.Except(
           f2, new IEqualityComparer(
             (Foo a, Foo b) => a.key.CompareTo(b.key)
           ) );
 I'm pretty sure the above doesn't actually work. I just don't want to have to make something as "heavy" as a whole class just to tell the program how to compare apples to apples.
@CODE:var f1 = ...,
    f2 = ...;
var f3 = f1.Except(
           f2, new IEqualityComparer(
             (Foo a, Foo b) => a.key.CompareTo(b.key)

@TITLE:C# .Equals(), .ReferenceEquals() and == operator
@CONTENT:My understanding of these three was: .Equals() tests for data equality (for the lack of a better description). .Equals() can return True for different instances of the same object, and this is the most commonly overridden method. .ReferenceEquals() tests whether or not two objects are the same instance and cannot be overridden. == is the same as the ReferenceEquals() by default, but this CAN be overridden. But C# station states: In the object class, the Equals and ReferenceEquals methods are semantically equivalent, except that the ReferenceEquals works only on object instances. The ReferenceEquals method is static. Now I don't get it. Can anyone shed some light on this?

@TITLE:SQL Server: Isolation level leaks across pooled connections
@CONTENT:As demonstrated by previous Stack Overflow questions (TransactionScope and Connection Pooling and How does SqlConnection manage IsolationLevel?), the transaction isolation level leaks across pooled connections with SQL Server and ADO.NET (also System.Transactions and EF, because they build on top of ADO.NET). This means, that the following dangerous sequence of events can happen in any application: A request happens which requires an explicit transaction to ensure data consistency Any other request comes in which does not use an explicit transaction because it is only doing uncritical reads. This request will now execute as serializable, potentially causing dangerous blocking and deadlocks The question: What is the best way to prevent this scenario? Is it really required to use explicit transactions everywhere now? Here is a self-contained repro. You will see that the third query will have inherited the Serializable level from the second query. class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        RunTest(null);
        RunTest(IsolationLevel.Serializable);
        RunTest(null);
        Console.ReadKey();
    }

    static void RunTest(IsolationLevel? isolationLevel)
    {
        using (var tran = isolationLevel == null ? null : new TransactionScope(0, new TransactionOptions() { IsolationLevel = isolationLevel.Value }))
        using (var conn = new SqlConnection("Data Source=(local); Integrated Security=true; Initial Catalog=master;"))
        {
            conn.Open();

            var cmd = new SqlCommand(@"

Note: header and footer have to be set to a fixed height in pixels (50px is ok). The main problem I'm having is that I cannot get that "big box" in the middle to behave like it does when it's done with tables.

@CONTENT:I have a SQLAlchemy query object and want to get the text of the compiled SQL statement, with all its parameters bound (e.g. no %s or other variables waiting to be bound by the statement compiler or MySQLdb dialect engine, etc). Calling str() on the query reveals something like this: SELECT id WHERE date_added <= %s AND date_added >= %s ORDER BY count DESC
 I've tried looking in query._params but it's an empty dict. I wrote my own compiler using this example of the sqlalchemy.ext.compiler.compiles decorator but even the statement there still has %s where I want data. I can't quite figure out when my parameters get mixed in to create the query; when examining the query object they're always an empty dictionary (though the query executes fine and the engine prints it out when you turn echo logging on). I'm starting to get the message that SQLAlchemy doesn't want me to know the underlying query, as it breaks the general nature of the expression API's interface all the different DB-APIs. I don't mind if the query gets executed before I found out what it was; I just want to know!

@LINK:/questions/4023320/how-to-implement-memmove-in-standard-c-without-an-intermediate-copy
@TITLE:How to implement `memmove` in standard C without an intermediate copy?
@CONTENT:From the man page on my system: void *memmove(void *dst, const void *src, size_t len); DESCRIPTION The memmove() function copies len bytes from string src to string dst. The two strings may overlap; the copy is always done in a non-destructive manner. From the C99 standard: 6.5.8.5 When two pointers are compared, the result depends on the relative locations in the address space of the objects pointed to. If two pointers to object or incomplete types both point to the same object, or both point one past the last element of the same array object, theycompare equal. If the objects pointed to are members of the same aggregate object, pointers to structure members declared later compare greater than pointers to members declared earlier in the structure, and pointers to array elements with larger subscript values compare greater than pointers to elements of the same array with lower subscript values. All pointers to members of the same union object compare equal. If the expression P points to an element of an array object and the expression Q points to the last element of the same array object, the pointer expression Q+1 compares greater than P. In all other cases, the behavior is undefined. The emphasis is mine. The arguments dst and src can be converted to pointers to char so as to alleviate strict aliasing problems, but is it possible to compare two pointers that may point inside different blocks, so as to do the copy in the correct order in case they point inside the same block? The obvious solution is if (src < dst), but that is undefined if src and dst point to different blocks. "Undefined" means you should not even assume that the condition returns 0 or 1 (this would have been called "unspecified" in the standard's vocabulary). An alternative is if ((uintptr_t)src < (uintptr_t)dst), which is at least unspecified, but I am not sure that the standard guarantees that when src < dst is defined, it is equivalent to (uintptr_t)src < (uintptr_t)dst). Pointer comparison is defined from pointer arithmetic. For instance, when I read section 6.5.6 on addition, it seems to me that pointer arithmetic could go in the direction opposite to uintptr_t arithmetic, that is, that a compliant compiler might have, when p is of type char*: ((uintptr_t)p)+1==((uintptr_t)(p-1)
 This is only an example. Generally speaking very little seems to be guaranteed when converting pointers to integers. This is a purely academic question, because memmove is provided together with the compiler. In practice, the compiler authors can simply promote undefined pointer comparison to unspecified behavior, or use the relevant pragma to force their compiler to compile their memmove correctly. For instance, this implementation has this snippet: if ((uintptr_t)dst < (uintptr_t)src) {
            /*
             * As author/maintainer of libc, take advantage of the
             * fact that we know memcpy copies forwards.
             */
            return memcpy(dst, src, len);
    }
 I would still like to use this example as proof that the standard goes too far with undefined behaviors, if it is true that memmove cannot be implemented efficiently in standard C. For instance, no-one ticked when answering this SO question.
@CODE:P Q+1 P dst src char if (src < dst) src dst if ((uintptr_t)src < (uintptr_t)dst) src < dst (uintptr_t)src < (uintptr_t)dst) uintptr_t p char* ((uintptr_t)p)+1==((uintptr_t)(p-1) memmove memmove if ((uintptr_t)dst < (uintptr_t)src) {
            /*
             * As author/maintainer of libc, take advantage of the
             * fact that we know memcpy copies forwards.
             */
            return memcpy(dst, src, len);
    } memmove

We had TSV file with a list of integers, with an int each line. The first line was the number of lines the list had. We also had a c file with a very simple "readfile". The first line was read to n, the number of lines, then there was an initialization of: int list[n]
 and finally a for loop of n with a fscanf. For small n's (till ~100.000), everything was fine. However, we've found that when n was big (10^6), a segfault would occur. Finally, we changed the list initialization to int *list = malloc(n*sizeof(int))
 and everything when well, even with very large n. Can someone explain why this occurred? what was causing the segfault with int list[n], that was stopped when we start using list = malloc(n*sizeof(int))?

When no more hard references are kept of a bitmap object, the garbage collector will automatically collect it. Now, if I understand correctly, the method Bitmap.recycle() must always be called to free a Bitmap. I think this is because Bitmap objects have special memory management. Is that correct?

    var selectList = listOfCategories.Select(x =>new SelectListItem{Text = x.Name, Value = x.Id.ToString(), Selected = x.Id.Equals(blogToEdit.Category.Id)}).ToList();
    selectList.Insert(0, new SelectListItem{Text = Messages.SelectAnItem, Value = Messages.SelectAnItem});

    var viewModel = new BlogModel
                        {
                            BlogId = blogToEdit.Id,
                            Active = blogToEdit.Actief,
                            Content = blogToEdit.Text,
                            Title = blogToEdit.Titel,
                            Categories = selectList //at this point i see the expected item being selected
                            //Categories = new IEnumerable<SelectListItem>(listOfCategories, "Id", "Naam", blogToEdit.CategorieId)
                        };
    return View(viewModel);
}
 When i set a breakpoint just before the view is being returned, i see that the selectlist is filled as i expected. So at this point everything seems to be okay. The viewmodel is filled entirely correct. Then in my view (i'm using Razor) i've got the following two rules which are supposed to render the selectlist for me. @Html.LabelFor(m => m.Categories) @Html.DropDownListFor(model=>model.Categories, Model.Categories, Model.CategoryId)
@Html.ValidationMessageFor(m => m.Categories)
 When I run the code and open the view to edit my blog, I can see all the correct data. Also the selectlist is rendered correctly, but the item i want to be selected lost it's selection. How can this be? Until the point the viewmodel is being returned with the view everything is okay. But when i view the webpage in the browser, the selectlist is there only with out the correct selection. What am I missing here? Or doing wrong?
@CODE:/// <summary>
/// The List of categories
/// </summary>
[Display(Name = "Categorie")]
public IEnumerable<SelectListItem> Categories { get; set; } public ActionResult Edit(Guid id)
{
    var blogToEdit = _blogService.First(x => x.Id.Equals(id));
    var listOfCategories = _categorieService.GetAll();
    var selectList = listOfCategories.Select(x =>new SelectListItem{Text = x.Name, Value = x.Id.ToString(), Selected = x.Id.Equals(blogToEdit.Category.Id)}).ToList();
    selectList.Insert(0, new SelectListItem{Text = Messages.SelectAnItem, Value = Messages.SelectAnItem});

    var viewModel = new BlogModel
                        {
                            BlogId = blogToEdit.Id,
                            Active = blogToEdit.Actief,
                            Content = blogToEdit.Text,
                            Title = blogToEdit.Titel,
                            Categories = selectList //at this point i see the expected item being selected
                            //Categories = new IEnumerable<SelectListItem>(listOfCategories, "Id", "Naam", blogToEdit.CategorieId)
                        };
    return View(viewModel);

@CONTENT:In SQL Server, how can I get the referenced table + column name from a foreign key? Note: Not the table/column where the key is in, but the key it refers to. Example: When the key [FA_MDT_ID] in table [T_ALV_Ref_FilterDisplay]. refers to [T_AP_Ref_Customer].[MDT_ID] such as when creating a constraint like this: ALTER TABLE [dbo].[T_ALV_Ref_FilterDisplay]  WITH CHECK ADD  CONSTRAINT [FK_T_ALV_Ref_FilterDisplay_T_AP_Ref_Customer] FOREIGN KEY([FA_MDT_ID])
REFERENCES [dbo].[T_AP_Ref_Customer] ([MDT_ID])

@TITLE:Design pattern for handling multiple message types
@CONTENT:I've got the GOF sitting on my desk here and I know there must be some kind of design pattern that solves the problem I'm having, but man I can't figure it out. For simplicities sake, I've changed the name of some of the interfaces that I'm using. So here's the problem, on one side of the wire, I've got multiple servers that send out different types of messages. On the other side of the wire I have a client that needs to be able to handle all the different types of messages. All messages implement the same common interface IMessage. My problem is, when the client gets a new IMessage, how does it know what type of IMessage its received? I supposed I could do something like the following, but this just FEELS awful. TradeMessage tMessage = newMessage as TradeMessage;
if (tMessage != null)
{
    ProcessTradeMessage(tMessage);
}

OrderMessage oMessage = newMessage as OrderMessage;
if (oMessage != null)
{
    ProcessOrderMessage(oMessage);
}
 The second thought, is to add a property to IMessage called MessageTypeID, but that would require me to write something like the following, which also FEELS awful. TradeMessage tMessage = new TradeMessage();
if (newMessage.MessageTypeID == tMessage.MessageTypeID)
{
    tMessage = newMessage as TradeMessage;
    ProcessTradeMessage(tMessage); 
}

OrderMessage oMessage = new OrderMessage();
if (newMessage.MessageTypeID == oMessage.MessageTypeID)
{
    oMessage = newMessage as OrderMessage;
    ProcessOrderMessage(oMessage);
}
 I know this general problem has been tackled a million times, so there has to be a nicer way of solving the problem of having a method that takes an interface as a parameter, but needs different flow control based on what class has implemented that interface.
@CODE:TradeMessage tMessage = newMessage as TradeMessage;
if (tMessage != null)
{
    ProcessTradeMessage(tMessage);
}

OrderMessage oMessage = newMessage as OrderMessage;
if (oMessage != null)
{
    ProcessOrderMessage(oMessage);
} TradeMessage tMessage = new TradeMessage();
if (newMessage.MessageTypeID == tMessage.MessageTypeID)
{
    tMessage = newMessage as TradeMessage;
    ProcessTradeMessage(tMessage); 
}

OrderMessage oMessage = new OrderMessage();
if (newMessage.MessageTypeID == oMessage.MessageTypeID)
{
    oMessage = newMessage as OrderMessage;
    ProcessOrderMessage(oMessage);
}

@TITLE:Parsing JSON in Spring MVC using Jackson JSON
@CONTENT:Ok, so I've been looking at this for a little while now and am no further on. I've got a Spring MVC servlet that I need to accept JSON from a JavaScript front end web app. To parse the JSON I need to use Jackson. I need to take the values within the JSON and store them into a List in the order they appear in the JSON. I've tried using the JsonFactory with the JsonParser and JsonNode objects but can quite get it to work. I've also tried to just open a BufferedReader and iterate through the request body line by line but again can't quite get this either. I've looked at a couple of related questions on here, but none so far have worked for me. Could anyone in the know point me in the right direction here please, a web page with an example would be great!
