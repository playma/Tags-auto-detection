@TITLE:NVarchar Prefix causes wrong index to be selected
@CONTENT:I have an entity framework query that has this at the heart of it: SELECT 1 AS dummy
FROM   [dbo].[WidgetOrder] AS widgets
WHERE  widgets.[SomeOtherOrderId] = N'SOME VALUE HERE'
 The execution plan for this chooses an index that is a composite of three columns. This takes 10 to 12 seconds. However, there is an index that is just [SomeOtherOrderId] with a few other columns in the "include". That is the index that should be used. And when I run the following queries it is used: SELECT 1 AS dummy
FROM   [dbo].[WidgetOrder] AS widgets
WHERE  widgets.[SomeOtherOrderId] = CAST(N'SOME VALUE HERE' AS VARCHAR(200))

SELECT 1 AS dummy
FROM   [dbo].[WidgetOrder] AS widgets
WHERE  widgets.[SomeOtherOrderId] = 'SOME VALUE HERE'
 This returns instantly. And it uses the index that is just SomeOtherOrderId So, my problem is that I can't really change how Entity Framework makes the query. Is there something I can do from an indexing point of view that could cause the correct index to be selected?
@CODE:SELECT 1 AS dummy
FROM   [dbo].[WidgetOrder] AS widgets
WHERE  widgets.[SomeOtherOrderId] = N'SOME VALUE HERE' SELECT 1 AS dummy
FROM   [dbo].[WidgetOrder] AS widgets
WHERE  widgets.[SomeOtherOrderId] = CAST(N'SOME VALUE HERE' AS VARCHAR(200))

SELECT 1 AS dummy
FROM   [dbo].[WidgetOrder] AS widgets
WHERE  widgets.[SomeOtherOrderId] = 'SOME VALUE HERE' SomeOtherOrderId SomeOtherOrderId SomeOtherOrderId

 An empty row is added as oTable.fnAddData(['&nbsp;', '&nbsp;', '&nbsp;']);
 However, this adds to the bottom of the table. Is there a way we can add exactly below / above the selected row.

@TITLE:Tkinter Popup Keyboard Library
@CONTENT:Before I go reinventing the wheel. Is there a (more or less) standard library for a popup keyboard for Tkinter? I need both a popup number pad (0-9,.,...ect) and a full keyboard (a-Z,A-Z,0-9,.,...etc). I currently have a nice number pad, but (as usual) my client told me after I got it done that they want a full keyboard as well. In sort of a second question but same topic. What is the correct way to pop between these two sibling windows so that they both return to the original parent no mater how many times you flip back and forth.

@CONTENT:This comes from my previous question on getting the average time interval over a specified data set, [located here][1]. I'll post the entire function again: function getATBData($siteID, $fromDate, $toDate)
{
    global $pdo;

    $ATBarray = array();
    $maxATB;
    $minATB;
    $avgATB;

    $totalEvents=0;
    $timetable;

    $stmt->bindParam(":siteID", $siteID);
    $stmt->bindParam(":fromDate", $fromDate);

    foreach ($stmt as $row)
    {
        $timeDiff = date_diff(new DateTime($row['start_time']),new DateTime($row['end_time']), true); //force absolute
        if(!isset($maxATB) OR dateIntervalInSeconds($timeDiff) > dateIntervalInSeconds($maxATB))
            $maxATB = $timeDiff;
        if(!isset($minATB) OR dateIntervalInSeconds($timeDiff) < dateIntervalInSeconds($minATB))
            $minATB = $timeDiff;
        $totalATB->add($timeDiff);
        echo "added " . $timeDiff->format("%H:%I:%S") . " total is now: " . $totalATB->format("H:i:s") . "<br />";
        $totalEvents++;
    }

    if($totalEvents!=0)
    {
        $avgATB = average_time($totalATB->format("H:i:s"),$totalEvents,0);
    }
    else
    {
        $avgATB=0;
        $maxATB=new DateInterval('PT0S');
        $minATB=new DateInterval('PT0S');
    }
    //$avgSeconds = new DateInterval("PT" . $avgATB . "S");
    $ATBarray['max'] = $maxATB->format("%H:%I:%S");
    $ATBarray['min'] = $minATB->format("%H:%I:%S");
    $ATBarray['avg'] = $avgATB;
    $ATBarray['total'] = $totalATB->format("H:i:s");
    $ATBarray['events'] = $totalEvents;

    return $ATBarray;

}
 Given this function, I have added an output statement to try to debug why I was getting such a large time interval for my total time (when most of the values are a small number of seconds) and this is what it's outputting: added 00:00:02 total is now: 01:00:02
added 00:00:00 total is now: 02:00:02
added 00:00:01 total is now: 03:00:03
added 00:00:01 total is now: 04:00:04
added 00:00:00 total is now: 05:00:04
added 00:00:02 total is now: 06:00:06
added 00:00:00 total is now: 07:00:06
 and so on. So it seems like, despite the time to be added only being a couple seconds, it adds an hour every time. The call to add() on $timeDiff above is how I'm adding. So the question is - is there a different way to call the add() function such that it will only add the seconds? Am I calling it incorrectly?

@TITLE:Android bluetooth connect() throwing error
@CONTENT:I have a project requirement wherein we have a product that contains two components -an android tablet and a PCB(containing an RN42 bluetooth chip).These two components are inside a plastic casing hence always will be in close proximity to each other.Both these devices would be paired once initially, hence the pairing info is present in the tablet forever. Problem : In my code I make use of a function which initializes the bluetooth socket and gets access to the DataOut and DataIn ports using which the data can be exchanged between the tablet and pcb. Case1: This piece of code has worked 100% of the time when I use Samsung S2(4.1.2) and the pcb, Case2: BUT when I use my tablet(iball 3G 7271(4.1.2)) along with the pcb then most of the time I have issue while connecting to the socket.I have got errors stating-  -Service discovery failed,
 -Connection is not created (failed or aborted).
 -Resource is busy
 on most occasions. What I tried: Tried using reflection ,but in vain. Have used the generic UUID - 00001101-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB,but no use. I do not understand why the code works fine when I use samsung S2 with RN42 chip,but throws error when I use iball tablet with RN42 chip.On digging further I came across this post http://redacacia.me/2012/07/17/overcoming-android-bluetooth-blues-with-reflection-method/#comment-1414 according to which Chinese devices(iball being one) uses MTK processors,and there have been bluetooth connectivity issues in them.

@LINK:/questions/22377259/upload-multiple-files-in-form-with-ruby-mechanize
@TITLE:Upload multiple files in form with ruby mechanize
@CONTENT:I can successfully upload a single file using a Mechanize form like this: def add_attachment(form, attachments)
   attachments.each_with_index do |attachment, i|
     form.file_uploads.first.file_name = attachment[:path]
   end
end
 where form is a mechanize form. But if attachments has more than one element, the last one overwrites the previous ones. This is obviously because I'm using the first accessor which always returns the same element of the file_uploads array. To fix this, I tried this, which results an error, because there is only one element in this array. def add_attachment(form, attachments)
   attachments.each_with_index do |attachment, i|
     form.file_uploads[i].file_name = attachment[:path]
   end
end
 If I try to create a new file_upload object, it also doesn't work: def add_attachment(form, attachments)
   attachments.each_with_index do |attachment, i|
     form.file_uploads[i] ||=  Mechanize::Form::FileUpload.new(form, attachment[:path])
     form.file_uploads[i].file_name = attachment[:path]
   end
end
 Any idea how I can upload multiple files using Mechanize?
@CODE:def add_attachment(form, attachments)
   attachments.each_with_index do |attachment, i|
     form.file_uploads.first.file_name = attachment[:path]
   end
end form first def add_attachment(form, attachments)
   attachments.each_with_index do |attachment, i|
     form.file_uploads[i].file_name = attachment[:path]
   end
end def add_attachment(form, attachments)
   attachments.each_with_index do |attachment, i|
     form.file_uploads[i] ||=  Mechanize::Form::FileUpload.new(form, attachment[:path])
     form.file_uploads[i].file_name = attachment[:path]

@TITLE:CDN Cname Cross domain issue in jwplayer caption
@CONTENT:I am using Jwplayer 6.8 and having my jwplayer setup in some server www.example.com.I am loading subtitles in vtt format from CDN d2cdnserver.cloudfront.com( cname - example.amazon.com, I am loading my subtitle using cname ) , It is throwing cross domain error. Source Link : Jwplayer crossdomain Issue I have to added response header in server end, in httpd.conf, php.ini and htaccess file but it does not seems to work. I was accessing my files through cname example.amazon.com, When I change this cname to my amazon S3 url ("https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.abcdef.com/files/myfiles"), it works and cross domain issue is not coming even without setting the access-control-allow-origin in cdn but if I use cloudfront cname then it always shows crossdomain error and file is not loaded. How to resolve this problem in CDN and CNAME? Is there some way to allow access-control-allow-origin for cname? BTW, I have tried allow access-control-allow-origin for CDN . It didn`t help for cloudfront cname. My AWS CORS Configuration At First, Both https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.abcdef.com/files/myfiles and cname example.amazon.com throws cross domain error But when I tried default configuration below <CORSConfiguration>

I have come to know that Textview can be created in two way. ie.1 using xml tag and 2. using Java code. By default I have one Textview saying Hello world in my sample project. I want to create a text view using Java code and display some message on it. I have searched a lot, but unable to understand the steps and layout setting mentioned in the code.

import android.view.Menu;
import android.view.ViewGroup;
import android.widget.*;
import android.view.View;

public class MainActivity extends Activity {

    @Override

        getMenuInflater().inflate(R.menu.activity_main, menu);
        return true;
    }

}
 Further I don't know how to add this textview in addView(). This is my activity_main.xml <RelativeLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    tools:context=".MainActivity" >


</RelativeLayout>
 A step by step solution would be helpful for me and any good tutorial link would be appreciable. Thank you in advance!
@CODE:import android.app.Activity;
import android.view.Menu;
import android.view.ViewGroup;
import android.widget.*;
import android.view.View;

public class MainActivity extends Activity {

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        LinearLayout.LayoutParams params = 
                new LinearLayout.LayoutParams( 
                   ViewGroup.LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT, 
                   ViewGroup.LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT, 0.0F);

        TextView tx= new TextView(this);

@TITLE:Unable to Obtain Table Information in Enterprise Architect - MySQL
@CONTENT:I'm using Sparx Enterprise Architect version 9.2 to import a database schema from a MySQL database using the ODBC connection. When I test the ODBC connection using the ODBC Data Source Administrator (Windows 7), the connection tests successfully. I'm using the MySQL ODBC 5.1 driver. In Enterprise Architect when I try to use this ODBC connection to import the schema I get a message saying, "Unable to obtain table information". Am I missing something? Any ideas?

@CONTENT:I have: MyClass <- setRefClass("MyClass" , fields = list(data="numeric")) Let's initialize an object of MyClass: OBJ <- MyClass(data=1:4) ... and print it on screen: OBJ Reference class object of class "MyClass"
Field "data":
[1] 1 2 3 4
 I would like to change the way it gets printed so I wrote this method: print.MyClass <- function(x) { cat("This is printed representation: ") print(x$data) } Now this works: print(OBJ) This is printed representation: [1] 1 2 3 4
 this doesn't: OBJ Is there any way to implement my print method with just typing OBJ? I have tried also show, or (OBJ), but no love for me.

@TITLE:Android Activity Recognition not working with Nexus 5
@CONTENT:I had a code working that was using Google's Activity Recognition Updates. Now all of a sudden these seem to send updates either several times per second or never although requested every 20 seconds.

 UPDATE: I believe canopi identified the correct problem. When the device is still with high confidence, it doesn't fire recognition intents at all. This was definitely different a year ago (on other devices). To detect if the device is still I log the last incoming activity with its timestamp and check periodically for that. An old timestamp signals that the device has been still for that time.

Other than writing JS for each field set is there a method to reload the form or collapse all form elements? A good example for a list view However this is for individual lists. I will need this code to apply to all form elements (collapsible fieldsets)
@CODE:$("[data-role=collapsible]").collapsible("collapse");

@CONTENT:I've been tasked with creating a Google Chrome extension. So far, everything works fine. However, I would like to be able to use multiple background scripts (what I mean is "background" : {"scripts" : ["background.js"]}, if what I'm talking about is unclear) rather than creating multiple extensions.

I wonder if it is possible to initialize the model exactly at the steady state? I read something about the homotopy command, but I was not even sure if it is something that I was looking for due to lack of examples, so I am not able to implement it to my model.

doStep('b')
doStep('c')
 and loop this 10 times doStep('x')
doStep('y')
doStep('z')
 and repeat everything 3 times (nesting).

@TITLE:How was Object.create() with second parameter accomplished prior to ECMAScript 5?
@CONTENT:When dealing with Object.create() I came across this question and in summary it mentions: polyfill that was used to retrofit IE8 with Object.create functionality, however this polyfill doesn't support a second parameter shim which requires inclusion of es5-shim with various trains of thought on how to best accomplish this. Here's my relevant code I am using: //json_string variable is passed via php

var arrayOfOptions = jQuery.parseJSON(json_string);

var template = {
     // my instance that I want to initialize based on the properties provided
};

var instance = Object.create(template, {'options':{value:arrayOfOptions, enumerable: true}});
 My question is how did programmers accomplish this task prior to ES5, and more specifically what would be a better/alternative implementations of initializing an object based on on a set of passed properties without utilizing the second parameter?

@TITLE:Returning dynamically allocated memory back to OS without terminating the program
@CONTENT:I am working on a program where I am using large but limited amount of memory. Memory is allocated and freed on run time on different threads. However, I noticed that the memory usage of the program would not remain within specified bounds. It would increase as time passed on. I wrote the following sample program to check whether memory is being freed back to the OS. Half the allocated memory was freed to check if the memory usage went down. int main() {     char *p[COUNT];

    for (int i = 0; i < COUNT ;i++ ) {

            p[i] = new char[1048576];

            memset (p[i], 0, 1048576);

            printf("%p\n", p[i]);
    }

    printf ("done allocating ... \n");

    sleep(10);

    printf("Freeing\n");
    for (int i; i < COUNT; i++ ) {

            delete[] p[i];
    }

    while(1)
            sleep(1);
 } After running the program, it seemed that the OS would not reclaim the freed pages. The memory usage remains the same as seen in "top" command in linux, after allocating and after freeing. It simply marks the pages as free for reuse by the same program. In my program, malloc and free are running on different threads. This poses memory management problem when malloc is called a lot more frequently than free and the process data segment grows very large, causing OS to swap pages to disk. This makes the program and OS, slow and unresponsive. Is there any way for the OS to reclaim freed memory ?

It seems that when the focus is on a drop down menu, the up and left arrows select the previous item and right / down arrows select the next item.

 Que #1 Is Code Snippet #2 a better way of handling exceptions in my case? For Next Question: So, I understood that if I have to display something using the exception object, I can do something like following inside the catch block: System.out.println("SQLException: " + ex.getMessage());
System.out.println("SQLState: " + ex.getSQLState());
System.out.println("VendorError: " + ex.getErrorCode());
 However, in my case, I am using an existing opened connection inside the catch block as shown above, and I am wondering: Que #2) Whether the code inside the catch block will start executing automatically as soon as an exception is caught ? I am confused because, in my System.out.println statements, I am using ex object to display all the messages and I am not using this object anywhere in the JDBC connection following it. Que #3 Is it okay if I use break statement at the end and get out of catch block? Since break is used for loops I believe control will automatically come out of the original catch block? Clarifications for Que #1: I am basically comparing two approaches keeping error handling in mind , either of one I am planning to use. In Code Snippet #1 , I have not added any additional try-catch block inside the catch block and vice versa in Code Snippet #2. I am basically using two connections inside catch block. The Connection #1 will be a connectionswhich will be used to insert some records in one database and same with the Connection #2. Since I have added additional try-catch block inside the catch block, I wanted to know is this approach good to proceed? Just wondering since I have more error handling code here, this approach should be better than theone presented in Code Snippet #1?

@TITLE:Directives with Isolated scope versions conflict
@CONTENT:In my Angular app, i have a directive "editable". It written on Angular version 1.2.0-rc.2 and worked well, but when I upgraded framework to version 1.2.13 - directive broke. I checked capability with other versions, and was confused, because directive works only with three versions: 1.2.0rc1, 1.2.0-rc.2 and 1.2.0-rc.3 In new versions this directive works only with two ugly edits: 1. directive's property "terminal" set to "true" 2. compile element in "link" function Directive have simple logic: show previously savedValue click on button "EDIT" -> show input for new value click on button "OK" to save value - > show new savedValue Here is the code: this version works: http://plnkr.co/edit/VHZVzk?p=preview this version broken: http://plnkr.co/edit/NffdDj?p=preview this version works with new insertions: http://plnkr.co/edit/7msiY0?p=preview So, i have a questions: Why it's all happens? What differences between 1.2.0-rc* versions and other, that brake down directive. Is there a way, better than compile directive and adding TERMINAL property to repair directive, because many other directives broken too?

@TITLE:Error 1004 when trying to get AutoFilter criteria of date filtering
@CONTENT:I'm working on a piece of VBA code which should save & restore the current AutoFilter state in Excel. I've been using the code here for a looong time without any issues, but now I've run into a pretty serious one. Let me illustrate that... Assume you have a (very simple) table setup with date filtering: If you would like to get the filtering criteria used programmatically, it will fail: This is happening for me in Excel 2010. Does anyone know a workaround for this? A link for the same issue described by someone else on Microsoft TechNet: Excel VBA AutoFilter criteria when Operator is xlFilterValues for Dates This points to Jon von der Heyden's site for a solution, but the site mentions: Unknown (likely date TreeView filter): To-date I am unable to find a way to capture date filters where the criteria is based on selection from the Tree View control in the Filter drop-down. These criteria are not stored in the Criteria1 or Criteria2 properties. I imagine working out the criteria will involve looping the Range_Field values. Although this would first require that all other field filters be turned-off, something not do-able from a worksheet function and would involve a timer to trigger a sub-routine. Again, I chose to avoid the extra complexity.

@LINK:/questions/22305470/using-boostthread-to-start-stop-logging-data-2nd-update
@TITLE:Using boost::thread to start/stop logging data (2nd update)
@CONTENT:I'm currently trying to log real-time data by using boost::thread and a check box. When I check the box, the logging thread starts. When I uncheck, the logging thread stops. The problem arises when I check/uncheck repeatedly and very fast (program crashes, some files aren't logged, etc.). How can I write a reliable thread-safe program where these problems don't occur when repeatedly and quickly checking/unchecking? I also don't want to use join() since this temporarily stops the data input coming from the main thread. In the secondary thread, I'm opening a log file, reading from a socket into a buffer, copying this into another buffer, and then writing this buffer to a log file. I'm thinking that maybe I should use mutex locks for reading/writing. If so, what specific locks should I use? Below is a code snippet: //Main thread

What kind of bugs? What does rs.close means? Does it mean that the connection to the database is kept open for as long as the rs isn't closed?
@CODE:rs.close Set rs = Nothing rs.close rs

@TITLE:getLastKnownLocation returning null in Android
@CONTENT:I know this has been talked about many times but nothing has helped me fix the problem that getLastKnownLocation is returning null. My Activity implement LocationListener: public class MainActivity extends Activity implements
    GooglePlayServicesClient.ConnectionCallbacks,
    GooglePlayServicesClient.OnConnectionFailedListener, LocationListener {
 I have this in my onCreate method:   LocationManager lm = (LocationManager) getSystemService(LOCATION_SERVICE);
  lm.requestLocationUpdates(LocationManager.GPS_PROVIDER, 0, 0, this);
 And i then try to get the user location like so (also in onCreate):     // Getting the Co-ordinates of the users current location
    Location location = lm
            .getLastKnownLocation(LocationManager.GPS_PROVIDER);

    if(location != null){
        longitude = location.getLongitude();
        latitude = location.getLatitude();
    }
 I tried then: @Override
public void onLocationChanged(Location location) {      
    longitude = location.getLongitude();
    latitude = location.getLatitude();
}
 Am I missing something? EDIT: Still not working but code I have tried:     if (lm.isProviderEnabled(LocationManager.GPS_PROVIDER)) {
    while (location == null) {
        if (counter > MAX_TIME) {   
        }
        else {
            try {
                 location = lm.getLastKnownLocation(LocationManager.GPS_PROVIDER);
                Thread.sleep(1000);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
            counter += 1000;
        }
    }
    }

@LINK:/questions/22300739/wrong-memory-locations-when-debugging-in-qemu-with-gdb
@TITLE:wrong memory locations when debugging in qemu with gdb
@CONTENT:I'm writing a little kernel in assembler. I'm running it in QEMU and have some problems with some bugs. Now I want to debug the kernel with dbg. So I assembled it like so: $ nasm -g -f elf -o myos.elf myos.asm
$ objcopy --only-keep-debug myos.elf myos.sym
$ objcopy -O binary myos.elf myos.bin
 Then I run it in QEMU with: $ qemu-system-i386 -s -S myos.bin
 Then I connect with gdb: $ gdb
(gdb) target remote localhost:1234
Remote debugging using localhost:1234
0x0000fff0 in ?? ()
symbol-file myos.sym
Reading symbols from /home/sven/Projekte/myos/myos.sym...done.
 I have a label named welcome in my kernel that points to a string. While testing I tried to look at that string, which gave the following result: (gdb) x/32b welcome
0x1e <welcome>: 0x00    0xf0    0xa5    0xfe    0x00    0xf0    0x87    0xe9
0x26:   0x00    0xf0    0x6e    0xc9    0x00    0xf0    0x6e    0xc9
0x2e:   0x00    0xf0    0x6e    0xc9    0x00    0xf0    0x6e    0xc9
0x36:   0x00    0xf0    0x57    0xef    0x00    0xf0    0x6e
 The label is defined like this: welcome: db "System started. Happy hacking!", 10, 0
 So you can see, gdb is pretending welcome starts with a null byte but by definition it's not. However the kernel uses the label correctly, so it doesn't seem like a poblem with my code. Examining other parts of the memory doesn't match the loaded kernel at all. Does anyone know why the memory of the virtual machine doesn't match the loaded kernel, while the machine still behaves corectly?

@TITLE:Force bars to start from a lower value than 0 in ggplot geom_bar in R
@CONTENT:I want to plot bar plots using ggplot. I used scale_y_log10 to rescale the y axis. When use the script below, I get bars that are in both directions (upward and downward) and the bars start from 1. I understand that it is because, log10(1)=0. ggplot (data=dat, aes(x=Col2,y=Col4,fill=Col3,group=Col1))+

theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=45,hjust=1,vjust=1))
 Now, I want to force the bars to start from a lower value (say 0.1 or 0.01) and make all the bars in upward direction. How can I do that? Tried to find related posts and info but had no luck. Can someone direct me if there are such info already? Edit: I want to use scale_y_log10 because most of the bars are low and some are extremely high. If I use scale_y_continuous, the shorter bars are not visible properly.

@TITLE:How to make a Django-Rest-Framework API that takes POST data?
@CONTENT:I'm building a Django application with Django-Rest-Framework APIs. I have built an API endpoint as follows. I want to be able to POST data from my browser. I want to retrieve an object model from my Database that has the matching primary as given in the URL. And I want to operate on that retrieved object based on the data posted by the browser. If I could just grab the posted data from with my ViewSet, I would be done. But I don't know how to get to execute that viewset's update() function when I do a POST. From my urls.py file: router.register(r'replyComment', views.ReplyComment, base_name="replyComment")
 From my views.py file: class ReplyComment(viewsets.ViewSet):
    def update(self,request,pk=None):
        try: 
            origComment = Comment.objects.get(pk=pk)
            # Do something here that modifies the state of origComment and saves it.
            return Response(
                json.dumps(True), 
                status=status.HTTP_200_OK,

            logger.error(exception)
            return Response(status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)
 I'm using the Advanced Rest Client (ARC) tool in my Chrome browser. When I point the ARC tool to http://127.0.0.1:3001/api/replyComment/2/ using the POST method, I get the error: {
    detail: "CSRF Failed: CSRF token missing or incorrect". 
}
 See the screenshot here. It seems like I'm doing something wrong here with my POST. Can someone please advise how to do this properly? How can I get around my CSRF issue? I'm a newbie to Django Rest Frameworks. So if you can provide clear details, it would be most appreciated. Please let me know what changes I need to make to ensure my POST works as I intend it to? I need a bit more help than simply referring me to the manual. (I tried that but still couldn't make it work)

@CONTENT:I've got a JFrame with two separate JPanels. One of the JPanels is filled with JButtons while the other has a couple of text fields. I added mouse listeners to the buttons via the JFrame and I want to make it so that when an event is fired from the first JPanel, the text fields in the second JPanel are changed. The two panels have their own classes. How would I go about doing this?

@TITLE:stat outputting the wrong values for files in a directory
@CONTENT:I am trying to create a function that will take an inputted directory path (filrOrDir) and output info for each file in the directory: file name, size, and last access date. The program compiles and prints everything. It prints the right file names but, for each file, the size and last access date are wrong. I thought maybe it was because of my variable declarations being in the while loop but I moved them around and still go the same results. Can somebody please give me a hint or a tip on what I am doing wrong? Below is my code: void dirInfo(char *fileOrDir)
{
  DIR *d;
  struct dirent *dir;
  d = opendir(fileOrDir);

  while((dir = readdir(d)) !=NULL)
  {
    struct stat *buffer = (struct stat *)malloc(sizeof(struct stat));
    char accessString[256];
    char *name = (char *)malloc(sizeof(char));
    struct tm *tmAccess;
    int size = 0;

    name = dir->d_name;

@CONTENT:I'm building a website using the Flask Framework, in which I've got a folder in which I have some python files and an __init__.py script (I guess you would call this folder a module?). In the init.py file I've got a line saying: db = Database(app)
 I now want to use db in a different script which is in this folder. Normally I would do this using from __init__ import db, but that just doesn't seem right to do, let alone pythonic. Furthermore, since it is in the __init__.py file, I suppose it should somehow be initialised for the whole folder/module. Does anybody know how I can use db from the __init__.py file? All tips are welcome!

@TITLE:Show/Hide Panel when checkbox is selected
@CONTENT:I'd like to show a panel when a checkbox is selected or hide the same when the checkbox is not selected. Following code works fine when the value of the checkbox changed. However, initially (when building the web page) the panel is always shown. Since the checkbox is deselected the outputLabel ("hallo") should not be displayed. Only after selecting the checkbox, the text should be displayed. So, something goes wrong here... Here is the code: <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"

@TITLE:Logic to select a specific set from Cartesian set
@CONTENT:I'm making a password brute forcing tool as a learning exercise, and I want it to be resumable. So, what I want is to be able to say, this is the set of possible characters, if I computed the Cartesian set of every possible combination of this set up to length n, what is the set at point x? However, I want to do this without computing the entire set. I've seen similar logic in one place online but I was unable to generalise this to fit. Any help would be fantastic, thanks! I'm fluent in C# if that helps. Edit: Here's the question I mentioned earlier: How to select specific item from cartesian product without calculating every other item Edit: here's an example of what I mean: Char set = [abcd]

Length n = 4

Permutations:

[aaaa]
[aaab]
[aaac]
[aaad]
[aaba]
....
[dddd]
 So if I'm searching for the set at 4, I'd get [aaad]. But if I'm searching for element 7000, then it takes a long time to get to that point.

Length n = 4

$(document).scrollTop()

$(this).scrollTop()
 This is my code before my fix when it's only working for IE9+ & FF & Chrome var offset = 220;
var duration = 500;
jQuery(window).scroll(function() {

});

jQuery('.back-to-top').click(function(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    jQuery('html, body').animate({scrollTop: 0}, duration);
    return false;
})
 And the CSS: .back-to-top {
    position: fixed;

@TITLE:A TreeSet or TreeMap that allow duplicates
@CONTENT:I need a Collection that sorts the element, but does not removes the duplicates. I have gone for a TreeSet. Since TreeSet actually adds the values to a backed TreeMap: public boolean add(E e) { return m.put(e, PRESENT)==null; } And the TreeMap removes the duplicates using the Comparators compare logic I have written a Comparator that returns 1 instead of 0 in case of equal elements. Hence in the case of equal elements the TreeSet with this Comparator will not overwrite the duplicate and will just sort it. I have tested it for simple String objects, but I need a Set of Custom objects. public static void main(String[] args)
{       
        List<String> strList = Arrays.asList( new String[]{"d","b","c","z","s","b","d","a"} );      
        Set<String> strSet = new TreeSet<String>(new StringComparator());       
        strSet.addAll(strList);     
        System.out.println(strSet); 
}

class StringComparator implements Comparator<String>
{
    @Override
    public int compare(String s1, String s2)
    {
        if(s1.compareTo(s2) == 0){
            return 1;
        }
        else{
            return s1.compareTo(s2);
        }
    }
}
 Is this approach fine or is there a better way to achieve this? EDIT Actually I am having a ArrayList of the following class: class Fund 
{
    String fundCode;
    BigDecimal fundValue;
    .....

    public boolean equals(Object obj) {

@TITLE:Is it possible to use QAbstractTableModel with TableView from QtQuick.Controls?
@CONTENT:Im trying to implement following thing: There is 2d table with values. I need to implement UI for viewing data and editing it. To simplify synchronisation between edits from UI and table updates coming from the back-end, I want model to store uncommitted edited values and expose a couple of methods to accept/reject pending changes. From what I understand this is reasonably easy to do with QtWidgets + models: Base model on QAbstractTableModel. Add a few extra roles for storing/querying pending changes, etc. Use QTableView with custom item delegate, which can query model whether cell is editable, show uncommitted changes, etc. But Im puzzled about how to implement it QtQuick.Controls.TableView. From my experiments, TableView doesnt work with QAbstractTableModel X it iterates over the first column of the model and uses roles to simulate second dimension. Is there a way to make TableView work with QAbstractTableModel correctly? As an alternative X I can change model to use roles for columns, but Im not sure how to handle other aspects of cell data (modified flag, uncommited value, etc.). The only idea I have so far is to return composite (dictionary) value for each cell. E.g. return QMap or QJsonObject as a value of cell and interpret it on QML side. Are there any other ways to do it? Whats more effective if I decide to implement my second solution X QMap or QJsonObject?

@CONTENT:Locally on my computer I have created a game in HTML5 (html+javascript). Its one html file that lies on my desktop and runs in Chrome and edit in notepad :). What I want to do is to connect to Azure as I want to store player score in my game. As I mentioned it runs in chrome, locally right now (file:///path/to/file.html) but in the end I want to release this game to Windows Phone and Android, where I might wrap it in Phonegap, if possible ill drop it if I dont really need it. So, I have my file on the desktop here and added the link to MobileServices.Web-1.1.0.min.js, and call var client = new WindowsAzure.MobileServiceClient('https://asd123.azure-mobile.net/', 'foo');
 When I run this, I get the errormessage: Login is only supported from http:// or Https:// URLs. Please host your page in a web server.
 Now, I can solve this by running this in IIS rather from my desktop, but I then wonder, what will happen when I push the application onto a device, like Windows Phone? Would it work? Or would I get the same problem there, as I guess the phone HTML5 application is not an webserver and runs the page in a webserver?
@CODE:var client = new WindowsAzure.MobileServiceClient('https://asd123.azure-mobile.net/', 'foo'); Login is only supported from http:// or Https:// URLs. Please host your page in a web server.

 I've tried to do all sorts of things with the certificates for weeks now but I failed to succeed to setup a completely running service. Can anyone please help me through the certificate handling step by step, because following the manual apparently has no success for some reason. Remark : I don't have an iOS certificate and I generated all my certificates with openSSL by following the wso2 manual. I executed this command to generate this specific (KEYSTORE)p12 file for import in wso2carbon.jks. Do I first need to manually delete all jks files in that folder, or should I import into the existing files for one? What else might I be doing wrong? Thanks for the support.

2013-3-2 Saturday
 If I want to choose the entry: select * from datetoday where weekday='Friday'
 to change it from text to character varying. It seems that the length is fixed is not according to each word length. For example 'Friday' should have length 6 and Wednesday length 9. How can I change this, let the length be the actual length of the word? Because later I will compare this table's weekday column to another table's weekday column. Like where a.weekday=b.weekday
 The other weekday is from user from jsp, so the length varies. Now the length is fixed, the comparison fails.

@CONTENT:I'm trying to implement the Application.Find command for the WPF richtextbox. Let's say I'm searching for "expert". Sounds easy enough. But due to the nature of wpf, if every other letter in "expert" is bolded, then the richtextbox contains e*x*p*e*r*t* and that means six runs exist. I have a starting textPointer. What I'm trying to figure out is how to get the ending textPointer so that I can create a TextRange that I can use to create the Selection. In this example, the starting textpointer is in the first run, and the ending textpointer should be in the last run. Is there a simple way to generate a textpointer if you know the run and the offset within the run? I tried generating it using a offset from the first textpointer but that did not work because the offset was not within the first run. As a relative newbie to the WPF richtextbox, this one has me stumped. I imagine that this problem has already been tackled and solved. I did find one partial solution but it only worked on a single run and does not address the multiple run situation.

@TITLE:Disable CSS transitions on page load only
@CONTENT:I have a div styled to have smooth transitions on background-color when hovered. This div is displayed in many pages (including homepage) but in homepage it has a different background-color. div {
    border:1px solid;
    background-color:#fff;
    display:inline-block;
    width:100%;
    height:100px;
    -webkit-transition: 0.5s;
    -moz-transition:    0.5s;
    -o-transition:      0.5s;
    transition:         0.5s;
}

div.homepage {
    background-color:#777;
}

div:hover, div.homepage:hover {
    background-color:#f00;
}
 Since this div is included with a PHP snippet on each page, the idea (to keep code clean) is to output a generic div with PHP and then add a "homepage" class on homepage only, via jQuery. $('div').addClass("homepage");
 Unfortunately, this causes an undesired transition on page load (see fiddle, for sake of clarity click "Run" after loading). How can I disable CSS transitions on page load only, without affecting normal behaviour (when div is hovered)?
@CODE:div {
    border:1px solid;
    background-color:#fff;
    display:inline-block;
    width:100%;
    height:100px;
    -webkit-transition: 0.5s;
    -moz-transition:    0.5s;
    -o-transition:      0.5s;
    transition:         0.5s;
}

div.homepage {
    background-color:#777;
}

div:hover, div.homepage:hover {
    background-color:#f00;
} $('div').addClass("homepage");

@CONTENT:I m having audio wav.I plot a graph of audio wav vs time of audio wav. I have some points for ex: 4 points .I plotted a vertical line on the graph at this 4 points. from this 4 points on graph I made 5 segment.audio file start time is 1,and end time is 10; a=[1 4 7 9];

s=
     start-time    end-time
s1      1             4

s3      7             9
s4      9             10
 Now i want to play the segment at the same time line should move synchronously from start-time of segment and stop at end-point of segment.
@CODE:a=[1 4 7 9];

s=
     start-time    end-time
s1      1             4

@TITLE:Why does node.js, http-server, show that there are two request coming?
@CONTENT:I have the following simple http-server setup using node.js: var http = require('http');
var port = 12311

http.createServer(function (req, res) {

    console.log("Incomming request from " + req.connection.remoteAddress);

    res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
    res.end("test string");


}).listen(port);
console.log("Listening on " +  port);
 As you can see, when a request comes in, I log it to the console. Now when I browse to localhost:12311 the console shows that two connections have come in: "E:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe" hello-world-server.js
Listening on 12311
Incomming request from 127.0.0.1
Incomming request from 127.0.0.1
 Why is this?

 I've tried to do all sorts of things with the certificates for weeks now but I failed to succeed to setup a completely running service. Can anyone please help me through the certificate handling step by step, because following the manual apparently has no success for some reason. Remark : I don't have an iOS certificate and I generated all my certificates with openSSL by following the wso2 manual. I executed this command to generate this specific (KEYSTORE)p12 file for import in wso2carbon.jks. Do I first need to manually delete all jks files in that folder, or should I import into the existing files for one? What else might I be doing wrong? Thanks for the support.

 It gives me the weekday info as text type. Then I use: select date::date, weekday::varchar from datetoday;
 Now the table is like 2013-3-1 Friday
2013-3-2 Saturday
 If I want to choose the entry: select * from datetoday where weekday='Friday'
 to change it from text to character varying. It seems that the length is fixed is not according to each word length. For example 'Friday' should have length 6 and Wednesday length 9. How can I change this, let the length be the actual length of the word? Because later I will compare this table's weekday column to another table's weekday column. Like where a.weekday=b.weekday
 The other weekday is from user from jsp, so the length varies. Now the length is fixed, the comparison fails.

@CONTENT:I'm trying to implement the Application.Find command for the WPF richtextbox. Let's say I'm searching for "expert". Sounds easy enough. But due to the nature of wpf, if every other letter in "expert" is bolded, then the richtextbox contains e*x*p*e*r*t* and that means six runs exist. I have a starting textPointer. What I'm trying to figure out is how to get the ending textPointer so that I can create a TextRange that I can use to create the Selection. In this example, the starting textpointer is in the first run, and the ending textpointer should be in the last run. Is there a simple way to generate a textpointer if you know the run and the offset within the run? I tried generating it using a offset from the first textpointer but that did not work because the offset was not within the first run. As a relative newbie to the WPF richtextbox, this one has me stumped. I imagine that this problem has already been tackled and solved. I did find one partial solution but it only worked on a single run and does not address the multiple run situation.

div.homepage {

div:hover, div.homepage:hover {

 Since this div is included with a PHP snippet on each page, the idea (to keep code clean) is to output a generic div with PHP and then add a "homepage" class on homepage only, via jQuery. $('div').addClass("homepage");
 Unfortunately, this causes an undesired transition on page load (see fiddle, for sake of clarity click "Run" after loading). How can I disable CSS transitions on page load only, without affecting normal behaviour (when div is hovered)?
@CODE:div {
    border:1px solid;
    background-color:#fff;
    display:inline-block;
    width:100%;
    height:100px;
    -webkit-transition: 0.5s;
    -moz-transition:    0.5s;
    -o-transition:      0.5s;
    transition:         0.5s;
}

div.homepage {
    background-color:#777;
}

div:hover, div.homepage:hover {
    background-color:#f00;
} $('div').addClass("homepage");

@CONTENT:I am passing variable data from res.render like this res.render('employment/employment', { title: 'Sheet | Employee',username:

 The above is first render. And in my angularjs have a route like this $routeProvider
.when('/employeeTimeSheet',{
controller:'MainCtrl',
templateUrl:'/partials/employeeTimeSheet.html'
})
.when('/employeeLogin',{
controller:'MainCtrl',
templateUrl:'/employeeDashboard'
})
.otherwise({redirectTo:'/employeeLogin'});

});
 So it redirects to employeeLogin. Here I have a partial and the route for this is like this on expressjs app.get('/employeeDashboard', function(req, res){
res.render('employelogin/employeeDashboard');
});
 Here the problem is the partial keeps on loading..many times and I need to pass data from one render to another render.
@CODE:res.render('employment/employment', { title: 'Sheet | Employee',username:    
req.session.name,DateTime:result-date,time-sheet:time-sheet}); $routeProvider

@TITLE:how to find local maxima in image
@CONTENT:The question is about feature detection concept. I'm stuck after I finding the corner of image and I want to know how to finding the feature point within the computed corners. Suppose I have grayscale image that have data like this A = [ 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1;
      1 3 3 3 1 1 4 1;
      1 3 5 3 1 4 4 4;
      1 3 3 3 1 4 4 4; 
      1 1 1 1 1 4 6 4;
      1 1 1 1 1 4 4 4]
 if I use B = imregionalmax(A);
 the result would be like this B = [ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0;
      0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0;
      0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1;
      0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1;
      0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1;
      0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1]
 The question is how do I pick the highest peak inside max local region (in sample how did I chose 5 from 3 and 6 from 4)? My idea was using B to detect each region and use imregionalmax() again but I'm not good at coding and I need some advice or other ideas.
@CODE:A = [ 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1;

@CONTENT:I am trying to use linear SVMs for multi-class object category recognition. So far what I have understood is that there are mainly two approaches used- one-vs-all(OVA) and one-vs-one(OVO). But I am having difficulty understanding its implementation. I mean the steps that I think is used are: First the feature descriptors are prepared from let's say SIFT. So I have a 128XN feature vector. Next to prepare a SVM classifier model for a particluar object category(say car), I take 50 images of car as the positive training set and total 50 images of rest categories taking randomly from each category (Is this part correct?). I prepare such models for all such categories (say 5 of them). Next when I have an input image, do I need to input the image into all the 5 models and then check their values (+1/-1) for each of these models? I am having difficulty understanding this part.

@CONTENT:Im writing a wxPython application that will be doing quite a bit of data analysis and display. The way Ive written it so far has led to problems when two threads try to change something in the GUI at the same time. What I want to do is to set up my own simple queue running on the main thread so that I can ensure that UI updates happen one at a time. Im having trouble getting my head around how Id set up my event loop, though. In general youd do something like while True:
    try:
        callback = queue.get(False)
    except Queue.Empty:
        break
    callback()
 I assume that if I run that code as-is then WX will not be able to do its thing because it will never receive any events or anything because control never leaves my infinite loop. How can I make this kind of structure coexist with the WX event loop? Or more generally, in a WX application how can I ensure that a certain task is only ever run on the main thread?

@TITLE:Change HTML email body font type and size in VBA
@CONTENT:I have a VBA script that that generates and email when a VBA button is pushed in a given worksheet. The script currently generates the email in a relatively small font. I was wondering if there is a way to set the font to Calibri, and the text sive to exactly 11. Here is the current VBA script: Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()

Dim OutApp As Object
Dim OutMail As Object
Dim strbody As String
Dim strUser As String
Dim signature As String
Dim sTo As String
Dim sCC As String
    'For To field
    Set emailRng = Worksheets("Send Email").Range("D3:I6")

    For Each cl In emailRng
        sTo = sTo & ";" & cl.Value
    Next

    sTo = Mid(sTo, 2)

    'For CC field
    Set emailRngCC = Worksheets("Send Email").Range("D8:I11")

    For Each cl In emailRngCC
        sCC = sCC & ";" & cl.Value
    Next

    sCC = Mid(sCC, 2)


Set OutApp = CreateObject("Outlook.Application")
Set OutMail = OutApp.CreateItem(0)
    With OutMail
    .Display
    End With
        signature = OutMail.HTMLBody


    strbody = "<FONT SIZE = 3>Good Morning;<p>We have completed our main aliasing process for today.  All assigned firms are complete.  Please feel free to respond with any questions.<p>Thank you."

    With OutMail
        .SentOnBehalfOfName = ""
        .To = sTo
        .CC = sCC
        .BCC = ""
        .Subject = "Data Morning Alias Process - COMPLETE"
        .HTMLBody = strbody & signature
        .Display
    End With
End Sub
 I know that this portion of the code: strbody = "<FONT SIZE = 3.5>Good Morning;<p>We have completed our main aliasing
 is the portion that relates to the email body text size. But a setting of 3 is to small, and a setting of 4 is too big. So I was just wondering if there is some way I can set the font to be exactly size 11, and the text to be formatted as Calibri? Thank you!

@TITLE:Are there properties that differ in parameters and return type?
@CONTENT:I have a class call CalcArray that has an array of doubles called Amounts(), and two ints, StartPeriod and EndPeriod. The user almost always wants to interact with the items in the array, not the Periods or the object itself. So ideally, I'd like: property AnAmount() as CalcArray 'So the user can talk to the object if they need to
property AnAmount(i as Integer) as Double 'So the user can just get the value directly
 This seems to work sometimes and not others. Is this simply a syntax issue? or is such an overload not possible?

@TITLE:Can someone walk me through serving gzipped files from Cloudfront via S3 origin?
@CONTENT:I've been through quite a few suggestions given on this topic from other posts on Stackoverflow, but I'm still not successfully getting it to work. The website origin is on S3, it is being served via Cloudfront. Going through the other posts and Amazon docs, I'm seeing suggestions such as: 1) Gzip the necessary files, remove the .gz from the files name, but on uploading, still set the meta to gzip. This isn't working for me. Safari just downloads the gzipped file(s) instead of serving as a webpage. 2) Amazon docs suggest uploading both a gzipped and none-compressed version of the file, but it makes no reference as to how that works. For example, do you link to both style.css and style.css.gz in the sites html? If so, is that not defeating the object of gzipping to speed up the site as it seems two requests would be made instead of one? Also, when you set the document Cloudfront is meant to retrieve, e.g. index.html, if you have both a gzipped and non-compressed file, which do you set as the document to retrieve? When I set the document as index.html.gz, the browser again just downloads the file. I'm getting speed ratings in the 70-80% margins, which, fair does could be worse, but it could be better too. I'm not a beginner, but I'm a million miles away from being an expert at this stuff, so I'm hoping I can get a step by step walk through on here. There must be something I'm not getting quite right. Thanks in advance for any help.

@TITLE:How to automate and import files that are located in date sequential folders into SAS?
@CONTENT:I currently have 700 folders that are all sequentially named. The naming convention of the folders are as follows:- 2011-08-15_2011-08-15    
2011-08-16_2011-08-16
2011-08-17_2011-08-17
...
2013-09-20_2013-09-20
 There are 10 txt files within each folder that have the same naming convention. With the txt files all being the same, what I am trying to achieve is to automate the infile and then use the name of the folder, eg 2011-08-15_2011-08-15 or part of eg. 2011-08-15 to then be the name of the created data set. I can successfully import all the txt files so there is no issue there, the issue is i don't want to be changing the folder name each time in the infile step. 'C:\SAS data\Extract\2011-08-17_2011-08-17\abc.txt'
 Is there an easier way to read these files in? I can find code for sequential txt/csv files but can find nothing to reference a folder and then rename the data set.

@TITLE:How to write the content of an array into text file? c++
@CONTENT:How to write the content of an array to a text file? Is it possible? Below is my code: x=0;

    for(i=nTCol; i>=0 ; i--){
        nPanelMap[nRow][x] = nTempMap[i];

@TITLE:iTextSharp Re-use Font Embedded In Acrofield
@CONTENT:There are tips in "iText In Action" that cover setting fonts, as well as the "FontFactory.RegisterDirectories" method (which is, as the book says...an expensive call). However, in my case, the font that I want to use for new fields is already embedded in the document (in an existing Acrofield). With no guarantee that the same font will exist on the user's machine (or on a web server)....is there a way that I can register that already-embedded font, so that I can re-use it for other objects? In the code below, Acrofield "TheFieldIWantTheFontFrom" has the font that I want to re-use for a field named "my_new_field". Any help would be greatly appreciated!         using (MemoryStream output = new MemoryStream())

@TITLE:Transparent picture box on top of another picture box is not working. How to fix this?
@CONTENT:I want to create two picture boxes, overlapping. The first Picturebox is used as the background, the picture of the screen. using this method: public void BckShow()
{
     Rectangle rect = Screen.GetBounds(this);
     gBackImg = Graphics.FromImage(bBackImg);
     gBackImg.CopyFromScreen(0,0,0,0,
               Screen.PrimaryScreen.Bounds.Size,
               CopyPixelOperation.SourceCopy);
}
 The second picturebox is above the first one, a transparent picture box that can be drawn using this mouse event: public void Draw(bool draw, Point sp, Point ep)
        {
            if (draw)
            {
                gCanvas.SmoothingMode = System.Drawing.Drawing2D.SmoothingMode.AntiAlias;
                pen = new Pen(new SolidBrush(ColorName), BrushSize);
                if (toolPen.Checked)
                {
                    gCanvas.DrawLine(pen, sp, ep);
                }
                else if (toolEreser.Checked)
                {
                    Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(ep.X, ep.Y, BrushSize*5, BrushSize*5);
                    gCanvas.DrawEllipse(pen, rect);
                    gCanvas.FillEllipse(new SolidBrush(ColorName), rect);
                }
                bCanvas.MakeTransparent(Color.White);
                pbxCanvas.Refresh();
                dirty = true;
                toolSave.Enabled = true;
            }
        }

        private void pbxCanvas_MouseDown(object sender, MouseEventArgs e)
        {
            sp = e.Location;
            if (e.Button == MouseButtons.Left)
            {
                ActivePaint = true;
            }
        }

        private void pbxCanvas_MouseUp(object sender, MouseEventArgs e)
        {
            ActivePaint = false;
        }

        private void pbxCanvas_MouseMove(object sender, MouseEventArgs e)
        {
            ep = e.Location;
            Draw(ActivePaint, sp, ep);
            sp = ep;
        }
 but when i run the program, the second PictureBox does not draw anything when the mouse event was fired. how i can fix this? I do this because I just want to save the image in the second picture box. Unlike PrintScreen but seemed to make notes on the screen and save the image apart from the screen image. Is there another way to do this? like using controls other than picture box, or may directly use the screen as a background but still can save the image in the transparent PictureBox separately. This is the example I want to achieve: when drawing: results stored images: I hope you all will help me to fix this. sorry for poor explanation. this the document outline window for more detail:

@TITLE:How to access braintree functionality from Meteor server
@CONTENT:I'm trying to use Braintree in my Meteor application, and I've made a local package of this Braintree packaging, following the instructions of this blog post on the subject, and the install went fine. Now though, I have this code: // defined in server/fixtures.js
Gateway = braintree.connect({
    environment: braintree.Environment.Sandbox,
    merchantId: "secret",
    publicKey: "secret",
    privateKey: "secret"
});
 and it's throwing this error: ReferenceError: braintree is not defined
(etc....)
 I then tried throwing in this line as recommended by the Braintree documentation, but it simply throws an error that "require" isn't defined. var braintree = require("braintree");
 The Braintree docs uses Express methodologies to make everything happen, but that's not a lot of help here. The package I referenced earlier defines it's server.js with this single line: Braintree = Npm.require("braintree");
 so I tried changing my references to Braintree rather than braintree, but this was undefined the exact same way. How do I get at Braintree to use it? Thanks in advance!
@CODE:// defined in server/fixtures.js
Gateway = braintree.connect({
    environment: braintree.Environment.Sandbox,

@TITLE:Split string into multiple columns with bigquery
@CONTENT:I have a table in BigQuery with millions of rows, and I want to split adx_catg_id column to multiple new columns. Please note that the adx_catg_id column contains an arbitrary number of words separated by space. This example of Query below can split the adx_catg_id to multiple columns if the string contains only less than five words. I can extend it to support more number of words, but I need to automate it. SELECT

 Changes in database: I have tried many changes in ViewModel and XAML files and now it got messed up. So, if I post those codes then also it will not be useful to anybody. I hope I have mentioned everything correctly in question. Update First of all I am sorry. My internet connection was down for the whole day. I have read your messages just now. Now, I have got something. I can get data from database in Design_Master_MenuItems. See the Image below: But still Binding does not work correctly. I mean my ListBoxes inside ItemsControl are not being populated. Here is my current XAML: <ItemsControl ItemsSource="{Binding MenuCategories}" >

    <ItemsControl.ItemsPanel>
        <ItemsPanelTemplate>
            <StackPanel IsItemsHost="True" Orientation="Horizontal" />
        </ItemsPanelTemplate>
    </ItemsControl.ItemsPanel>

    <ItemsControl.ItemTemplate>
        <DataTemplate>
            <Grid >
                <Grid.RowDefinitions>
                    <RowDefinition Height="Auto" />
                    <RowDefinition Height="*" />
                </Grid.RowDefinitions>

                <TextBlock Text="{Binding Title}" FontSize="30" />

                <ListBox Grid.Row="1" x:Name="lst"
                         ItemsSource="{Binding Design_Master_TileItems}" DisplayMemberPath="Title">

                </ListBox>
            </Grid>
        </DataTemplate>

</ItemsControl>

 Yes, and I will not be available for next 10 hours. If you find any mistake in the above code you may comment. Thanks for a big helping hand.

@TITLE:IndexError: too many indices in numpy python
@CONTENT:I know many people asked this question, but I could not get an appropriate answer that can solve my problem. I have an array X::     X=
    [1. 2. -10.]
 Now I am trying to make a matrix Y reading this X array. My code is:: #   make Y matrix

Y=np.matrix(np.zeros((len(X),2)))
i=0

while i < len(load_value):
    if X[i,1] % 2 != 0:
        Y[i,0] = X[i,0]*2-1
    elif X[i,1] % 2 == 0:
        Y[i,0] = X[i,0] * 2
    Y[i,1] = X[i,2]
    i = i + 1
print('Y=')
print(Y)
 Now if I run this, it gives following error::     Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "C:\Users\User\Desktop\Code.py", line 251, in <module>
        if X[i,1] % 2 != 0:
    IndexError: too many indices
 here, my array has only 1 row. If I make array X with 2 or more rows, it does not give me any error. It gives me error only when X array has 1 row. Now, in my case, array X can have any number of rows. It can have 1 row or 5 rows or 100 rows. I want to write a code which can read array X with any number of rows without any error. How can I solve this problem? Thanks in advance....

@TITLE:How to efficiently hold a key in Pygame?
@CONTENT:[EDIT] I've posted the solution down there. [/EDIT] I've found two related questions: Pygame hold key down causes an infinite loop pygame - on hold button down But I want to be specific. How to? while not done:
    for e in event.get():
        if e.type == KEYDOWN:
            keys = key.get_pressed()
            if e.type == QUIT or keys[K_ESCAPE]:
                done = True
            if keys[K_DOWN]:
                print "DOWN"
 When I press the down arrow, it prints, but it prints just once. If I want to print it another time, I need to press it again. If I use the while keyword instead, while keys[K_DOWN]:
    print "DOWN"
 I get an infinite loop for some obscure reason. This logical alternative is also useless: if ((e.type == KEYDOWN) and keys[K_DOWN]):
    print "DOWN"
 And there is this other one that somehow cleans the events and you can use while: while not done:
    for e in event.get():
        if e.type == KEYDOWN:
            keys = key.get_pressed()
            if e.type == QUIT or keys[K_ESCAPE]:
                done = True
            while keys[K_DOWN]:
                print "DOWN"
                event.get()
                keys = key.get_pressed()
 But you press the down key for less than one second and it prints thousands of times. (Moving a player would be impossible, and adjusting clock for this does not seem to be the right way to deal with it (And I've tried and I've failed miserably.)). To press and execute the block thousands of times is useless. What I want, is to press the key and keep going with the action while I don't release it, within the defined game clock speed.
@CODE:while not done:
    for e in event.get():
        if e.type == KEYDOWN:
            keys = key.get_pressed()
            if e.type == QUIT or keys[K_ESCAPE]:
                done = True
            if keys[K_DOWN]:
                print "DOWN" while keys[K_DOWN]:
    print "DOWN" if ((e.type == KEYDOWN) and keys[K_DOWN]):
    print "DOWN" while not done:

@TITLE:Background task when apns received
@CONTENT:After reading APNS documentation, I have implemented apns into my app. Everything works fine, but I have a question. I don't know if it is possible, but I would like to do a task when my app is in background and I receive a apns notification. This is my dictionary inside the notification: aps =
{
  alert = "message";
  sound = "default";
};
 If my app is in foreground, I execute this code: - (void)application:(UIApplication*)application didReceiveRemoteNotification:(NSDictionary*)userInfo
{     
    [HTTPConnection sendGetToUrl:[NSURL URLWithString:stringUrl]];

    NSLog(@"Received notification: %@", userInfo);  
}
 But apns does not execute "didReceiveRemoteNotification" when the app is in background, so I would like to execute the method: [HTTPConnection sendGetToUrl:[NSURL URLWithString:stringUrl]];
 if I receive an apns notification in background. Is there any way to do it? Thanks so much!

@CONTENT:I want to get First column value as we can achieve in Jtable using swing. below is my code and image for jtable. String Table_Clicked = jTable1.getModel().getValueAt(row, 0).toString();
 As you can see in image when i click to the Name column value eight it gives me first column value like 8. But I select Name Column So how to achieve this in JavaFX with TableView Componenet. I get the selected Value from the TableView as you can see in image below with the code.    tableview.getSelectionModel().selectedItemProperty().addListener(new ChangeListener() {
        @Override
        public void changed(ObservableValue observableValue, Object oldValue, Object newValue) {
         if(tableview.getSelectionModel().getSelectedItem() != null)

                TableViewSelectionModel selectionModel = tableview.getSelectionModel();
                ObservableList selectedCells = selectionModel.getSelectedCells();
                TablePosition tablePosition = (TablePosition) selectedCells.get(0);
                Object val = tablePosition.getTableColumn().getCellData(newValue);
                System.out.println("Selected value IS :" + val);
            }

         }

@TITLE:Get Java class bytecode from memory(After multiple transforms)
@CONTENT:I'm working on a coremod for Minecraft, and transform a lot of the classes as they are loaded. The problem however is that there are multiple coremods which also transform the same classes that I am, and I am getting some strange behavior that I want to look into. Then comes the problem, how do I inspect the bytecode after it has been transformed multiple times? When I transform it I just get an byte[] input that I run trough ASM and then return my modified bytecode. My idea was to just to dump the class bytecode to a .class file after the class was loaded, and inspect it from there. But I can't seem to find any way to actually get the bytecode after the class is loaded. The closest I can find is getResource, but that returns the bytecode as it was BEFORE it was transformed, not what I want. TLDR: How do I get the bytecode of a class AFTER it has been modified and loaded? -Can't use ClassLoader.getResource as it returns unmodified version. -Can't get it during load time as I want to catch transforms happening after my own. Is there some external program that can dump the in-memory bytecode or something? Hoping someone can help me with this =)

@CONTENT:Any recommendations for receiving UDP data from an app running on Google Glass? I need to integrate with an existing system. This system does UDP broadcasts to the local subnet. The Glass will be on the same subnet and the app running on the Glass just needs to listen on a port for UDP packets and then display information contained in them to the user. I'm integrating with an existing system which I don't have the freedom to change at this point and so want to just receive UDP (as opposed to using other, perhaps better, higher level frameworks). Looking around the docs I see network related topics pointing me to higher level stuff for interoperating, but I'm really just looking for a low level UDP receiving socket and wondering what would be recommended for doing this on Glass. Any suggestions?

@TITLE:php Namespace Cannot Find SQLite3 Class
@CONTENT:I have searched and read through many posts here regarding PHP namespaces and accessing class members. I still can't reference the SQLite3 class when wrapped in a custom class and contained within a namepace. Example below: sqlite3_data_broker.php namespace DataAccess\SQLiteDb;

class SQLiteBroker {

    private $db, $db_pathname;

    public function __construct ($dbPathName) {
        $this->db_pathname = $dbPathName;
    }

    public function Open() {

    public function getPathName() {
        return $this->db_pathname;
    }

}
 some_other_class.php include('sqlite3_data_broker.php');

$the_db = new \DataAccess\SqliteDb\SQLiteBroker('K:\Path\To\Db\the_data.db');

echo 'Database Full Name: ' . $the_db->getPathName();

$the_db->Open();
 Will yield the following: Database Full Name: K:\Path\To\Db\the_data.db Fatal error: Class 'DataAccess\SQLite3Db\SQLite3' not found in sqlite3_data_broker.php on line... Using a namespace I can reference class members but not SQLite3 class wrapped in the open() function. If I remove the namespace and references to it, that is call the broker class like this: $the_db = new SQLiteBroker('K:\Path\To\Db\the_data.db'), all works fine. Is there something I'm missing or not considering in wrapping the SQLite3 class? If it comes down to it I'll remove the namespace, though it would be nice to have it. PHP Version 5.4.6.

@TITLE:Convert python decimal to string in deeply nested and unpredictable list
@CONTENT:I am trying to loop through every value in a deeply nested/mixed list and convert any Decimal instances to string so that I can store them in mongo. My attempt at recursion reached the max depth. I would like to solve this iteratively or in a performant manner. This doesn't seem to work but is my latest attempt: def convert_decimals(root_obj):
    objs_to_convert = [root_obj]

    while objs_to_convert:
        obj = objs_to_convert.pop(0)
        for k, v in enumerate(obj):

            if len(v):
                objs_to_convert.append(v)
            elif isinstance(v, Decimal):
                obj[k] = str(v)
 Sample Input: [
    {
        'Payments': {
            'Payment': Decimal('495.64'),
            'IsCapped': True,
            'OtherFees': Decimal('0'),
            'CapCostTotal': Decimal('27900'),
            'Name': 'TestData',
            'Program': {
                'ProgramName': u'AST',
                'Description': None
            },
            'Rate': Decimal('0.0254'),
            'APR': Decimal('2.54'),
            'AppliedIds': [

            ],
            'Tax': Decimal('0')
        }
    }
]
 After conversion, the decimal instances should be strings
@CODE:def convert_decimals(root_obj):
    objs_to_convert = [root_obj]

    while objs_to_convert:
        obj = objs_to_convert.pop(0)
        for k, v in enumerate(obj):

            if len(v):
                objs_to_convert.append(v)
            elif isinstance(v, Decimal):
                obj[k] = str(v) [
    {
        'Payments': {
            'Payment': Decimal('495.64'),
            'IsCapped': True,
            'OtherFees': Decimal('0'),
            'CapCostTotal': Decimal('27900'),

                'Description': None
            },
            'Rate': Decimal('0.0254'),
            'APR': Decimal('2.54'),
            'AppliedIds': [

            ],

@TITLE:format phone number in csv using pandas
@CONTENT:Python/pandas n00b. I have code that is processing event data stored in csv files. Data from df["CONTACT PHONE NUMBER"] is outputting the phone number as `5555551212.0' Obviously, the ".0" is a problem, but added because it's an integer, I imagine? Anyhoo, I decided that I should format the phone number for usability's sake. The number comes from the csv file, unformatted. The number will always be ten digits: 5555551212, but I would like to display it as (555)555-1212. import glob
import os
import pandas as pd
import sys

csvfiles = os.path.join(directory, '*.csv')
for csvfile in glob.glob(csvfiles):
    df = pd.read_csv(filename)
    #formatting the contact phone
    phone_nos = df["CONTACT PHONE NUMBER"]
    for phone_no in phone_nos:
        contactphone = "(%c%c%c)%c%c%c-%c%c%c%c" % tuple(map(ord,phone_no))
 The last line gives me the following error: not enough arguments for format string But maybe this isn't the pandas way of doing this. Since I'm iterating through an array, I also need to save the data in its existing column or rebuild that column after the phone numbers have been processed.
@CODE:df["CONTACT PHONE NUMBER"] import glob
import os
import pandas as pd
import sys

csvfiles = os.path.join(directory, '*.csv')
for csvfile in glob.glob(csvfiles):
    df = pd.read_csv(filename)
    #formatting the contact phone
    phone_nos = df["CONTACT PHONE NUMBER"]
    for phone_no in phone_nos:
        contactphone = "(%c%c%c)%c%c%c-%c%c%c%c" % tuple(map(ord,phone_no)) not enough arguments for format string

 I have tried to set gradle properties in ~/.gradle/gradle.properties file: systemProp.http.proxyHost=proxy.mycompany.com
systemProp.http.proxyPort=80
 ... but it not seems to be a great idea as I have a warning in HTTP Proxy settings (those settings are obsolete). I have ask people from network to snif what happens, and there are access failure on URLs like http://dl-ssl.google.com (same that are used in Android SDK manager), or EC2 on Amazon (possibly used by crashlytics, isn't it?). Of course all this runs perfectly when I'm directly connected in my company's LAN. Any idea of what could happen? Any workaround? Thanks for support. Jean EDIT: Solution is to set https proxy server and port in ~/.gradle/gradle.properties file. In my case, http parameters seems useless. systemProp.https.proxyHost=proxy.mycompany.com
systemProp.https.proxyPort=80
 Thanks for you help!

 I am having a problem in receiving the notification. Server side code is working correctly. My log cat says: {"multicast_id":5884981605957538237,"success":1,"failure":0,"canonical_ids":0,"results":[{"message_id":"0:1393495991926450%978fee92f9fd7ecd"}]}
 The major problem is that, if device has the example app it get notification in that application rather than my customized application. And if I remove that application i don't get any notification. So i am confused that notification has to be received in my app rather than that of androidhive application but push notification is displayed in androidhive application. Please help me to solve this issue. Thanks in advance.

 I also tried pip install scrapy without sudo, also failed with the same error. I checked the similar issue on S.O, and found this I followed the solution there ln -s  /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.9.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/Tk.framework/Versions/8.5/Headers/X11 /usr/local/include/X11
 No such file or directory. I'm new to Mac os. could you give some suggestions? or another convenient way to install scrapy? I used anaconda before, but it doesn't have scrapy incorporated. And I heard there's a package manager called homebrew..but I have no idea how to use it. Thanks a lot!

@TITLE:Overriding methods values in App.xaml.cs
@CONTENT:I am working on Windows 8 Phone application,I have 2 things here one is Library project and other is normal app,Let me first explain my code: In Library project     class A
    {
      public static string empName ="ABC";
      public static int empID = 123;

      public virtual List<string> ListOfEmployees()
      {
           List<string> empList = new List<string>
           empList.Add("Adam");
           empList.Add("Eve");
           return empList;
      }

}
 I have referenced the library project in my child project, My child and Library project are in 2 different solution. In Child application class Properties : A
{

 public void setValues(){
       empName ="ASDF"
       ListOfEmployees();
}
  public override List<string> ListOfEmployees()
          {
               List<string> empList = new List<string>
               empList.Add("Kyla");
               empList.Add("Sophia");
               return empList;
          }
      }
 Now in every Child Application we App.xaml.cs which is the entry point of each project. In this App.xaml.cs file i am creating an object of this Properties and calling setValues method. What i see here is only static variables values are overridden but the methods are not overridden.Why so ? am i doing anything wrong here ? I get the ASDF and list with Adam and Eve as output But i need ASDF and list with Kyla and Sophia as output. How to achieve this ? EDIT How i am using these values: In my Base : class XYZ : A

    {
      // now i can get empName as weel as the ListOfEmployees()
       string employeeName = null;

       public void bind()
       {
         employeeName = empName ; 
         ListOfEmployees(); // here is the bug where i always get Adam and Eve and not the Kyla and sophia
       }
    }
@CODE:class A
    {
      public static string empName ="ABC";
      public static int empID = 123;

      public virtual List<string> ListOfEmployees()
      {
           List<string> empList = new List<string>
           empList.Add("Adam");
           empList.Add("Eve");
           return empList;
      }

} class Properties : A
{

 public void setValues(){
       empName ="ASDF"
       ListOfEmployees();
}
  public override List<string> ListOfEmployees()
          {
               List<string> empList = new List<string>
               empList.Add("Kyla");
               empList.Add("Sophia");
               return empList;
          }
      } App.xaml.cs App.xaml.cs Properties and calling setValues method. class XYZ : A

@TITLE:Javascript function to convert decimal years value into years, months and days
@CONTENT:I need a function to transform decimal values of years in years, months and days. Ex: 1.5 years = 1 year, 6 month. 2.2527397260273973 years = 2 years, 3 months and 1 day. I started with this function: function yearsToYearsMonthsDays(value){
var years = Math.floor(value);
var months =  Math.floor( (value - years) /(1/12) );
var days = Math.floor ( ( (value - years) /(1/12) - Math.floor((value - years) /(1/12)) ) / (1/365) );
var result = years + " years, " + months + " months, " + days + " days";
    Logger.log(result);
}
 But sometimes it doesn't work (ex: 0.75 doesn't produces 9 months). Any help?
@CODE:function yearsToYearsMonthsDays(value){
var years = Math.floor(value);
var months =  Math.floor( (value - years) /(1/12) );

@TITLE:How to get the relative of a folder from two different projects
@CONTENT:I have two projects and one shared library that loads images from this folder: "C:/MainProject/Project1/Images/" Project1's folder: "C:/MainProject/Project1/Files/Bin/x86/Debug" (where there is project1.exe) Project2's folder: "C:/MainProject/Project2/Bin/x86/Debug" (where there is project2.exe) When I call the shared library function to load images, I need to obtain the relative path of "Images" folder, because I will call the function from either project1 or project2. Also I will move my MainProject in other computers, so I can't use absolute paths. From Project1 I would do: Directory.GetParent(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory()).Parent.Parent.Parent.FullName + @"\Images";
 From Project2 I would do: Directory.GetParent(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory()).Parent.Parent.Parent.FullName + @"Project1\Images";
 How can I obtain the relative path by both projects folders?
@CODE:"C:/MainProject/Project1/Images/" "C:/MainProject/Project1/Files/Bin/x86/Debug" "C:/MainProject/Project2/Bin/x86/Debug" Directory.GetParent(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory()).Parent.Parent.Parent.FullName + @"\Images"; Directory.GetParent(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory()).Parent.Parent.Parent.FullName + @"Project1\Images";

@TITLE:Select time between two times mysql
@CONTENT:I have to check if a specific time is between two times (opening and closing time). The opening and closing times are saved in a database as "start" and "end" related to a weekday id and not to a date. So my problem is, that I have two different cases first case is that the end-time is bigger than start time like if end=19:00:00 and start=09:00:00 but it also can be end=06:00:00 and start=20:00:00 So what is a performance way to check if a time is between the two times? My sql looks like this: SELECT * 
      FROM opening
      WHERE weekday_id = :weekday
      AND start <=  :time
      AND end >=  :time
@CODE:SELECT * 
      FROM opening
      WHERE weekday_id = :weekday
      AND start <=  :time
      AND end >=  :time WHERE WHERE (start < end AND (:time < end AND :time >= start)) OR (start > end AND (:time >= start OR :time < end))

 However when i see it in my browser it looks like : As you see it breaks up undesirably.As a result when i parse it in my android app i get an exception value <br of type java.lang.String can't be converted to JSONArray which i believe because of this linebreak issue only. what I have tried I tried many things including preg_replace,str_replace etc in order to escape \r\n or <br> etc but couldn't get it work for me.Finally i have a function which i am using like this : function parse($text) {

$text = str_replace("\r\n", "\n", $text);
$text = str_replace("\r", "\n", $text);
$text = trim( preg_replace( '/\s+/', '<br/>', $text));
// JSON requires new line characters be escaped
 $text = str_replace("\n", "\\n", $text);
return $text;
 } I am writing a query to retrieve data from postgresql database.Hence running the following loop. for ($i=0; $i<$rows; $i++)

@LINK:/questions/22049289/confused-on-java-threadpool
@TITLE:Confused on Java ThreadPool
@CONTENT:It is my first time to use Java Thread Pool for my new project, after I came across this link http://www.javacodegeeks.com/2013/01/java-thread-pool-example-using-executors-and-threadpoolexecutor.html, I am more confused on this, here is the code from the page, package com.journaldev.threadpool;

public class WorkerThread implements Runnable {

    private String command;

    public WorkerThread(String s){
        this.command=s;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName()+' Start. Command = '+command);
        processCommand();
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName()+' End.');
    }

    private void processCommand() {
        try {
            Thread.sleep(5000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    @Override
    public String toString(){
        return this.command;
    }
}


package com.journaldev.threadpool;

import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class SimpleThreadPool {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            Runnable worker = new WorkerThread('' + i);
            executor.execute(worker);
          }
        executor.shutdown();
        while (!executor.isTerminated()) {
        }
        System.out.println('Finished all threads');
    }

}
 in the code, a fixed size pool is created and 10 worker threads are created, am I right? The thread pool is supposed to decrease the burden of a system, on the contrary, in the above code, I think it increases the burden by creating the pool in addition to the worker threads. why bother to use the thread pool? Can anyone explain? Thanks I also read this post on StackOverflow http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19765904/how-threadpool-re-use-threads-and-how-it-works it did not help me either.

        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName()+' Start. Command = '+command);
        processCommand();
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName()+' End.');
    }

    private void processCommand() {
        try {

@TITLE:multiple files upload using single file tag
@CONTENT:I Have seen many posts about everyone is using this approach <form action="" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">    
  <input type="file" name="files" id="file1" />
  <input type="file" name="files" id="file2" />    
  <input type="submit"  />
</form>
 And then in controller the use [HttpPost]
public ActionResult Upload(IEnumerable<HttpPostedFileBase> files)
{
    foreach(var file in files)
    {
            file.SaveAs("myPath");
    }     
    return RedirectToAction("Index");
}
 I tried and succeeded this way. But when I do it with <form action="" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">    
  <input type="file" name="files" id="file" multiple />   
  <input type="submit"  />
</form>
 This selects multiple files at the client end but If I use the same above(controller's) code in controller., I am able to upload only one file. What cud be the solution (the controller code) If I want to facilitate user to select all desired image once (suppose he/has them in same folder/directory) means using single file tag. Unlike (these many articles) http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/442515/Uploading-and-returning-files-in-ASP-NET-MVC http://haacked.com/archive/2010/07/16/uploading-files-with-aspnetmvc.aspx/ and http://demos.devexpress.com/MVCxFileManagerAndUploadDemos/UploadControl/MultiFileUpload
@CODE:<form action="" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">    
  <input type="file" name="files" id="file1" />
  <input type="file" name="files" id="file2" />    
  <input type="submit"  />
</form> [HttpPost]
public ActionResult Upload(IEnumerable<HttpPostedFileBase> files)
{
    foreach(var file in files)
    {
            file.SaveAs("myPath");
    }     
    return RedirectToAction("Index");
} <form action="" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">    
  <input type="file" name="files" id="file" multiple />   
  <input type="submit"  />
</form> return RedirectToAction("Create") foreach(var file in files)

@TITLE:shuffle two arrays in java
@CONTENT:Sorry, I am beginner in java. I have defined two arrays. one of the types is string and the other is integer. now, i want to shuffle them.Assume id = {12, 45, 78, 23} and name = {"math", "physic", "art", "computer"}. for example after shuffling the arrays will become id = {78,45,23,12} and name = {"physic", "art", "math", "computer"}. i wrote the below code which does not work. how can i fix it? public class RandomNumber {

@LINK:/questions/22035176/how-can-i-make-this-into-a-loop
@TITLE:How can I make this into a loop?
@CONTENT:Writing an LSH program in Java, during this first part I read through 5 different text files and pulled out all the unique words. Then created 5 different shuffling of the words. Now, the code I came up with works, obviously, but I know anytime you copy paste the same block of code a bunch of times, you generally could have done it cleaner using a loop. I just, in this instance, can't figure out how. I feel like its bad practice to do it the way I did, so in the future I'd love to avoid this. Can someone help me figure out how to loop Java variable names? (or some similiar fix for copy/pasting blocks of code like this) UPDATE: I need to be able to access each uniquely shuffled List later in my program, so I can't simply throw it in a for loop that iterates 5 times overwriting the previous List. I also do not need to output the lists, that was just for testing the shuffles, sorry that wasn't clear. I updated my comments. import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;

                words.add(line);

@TITLE:do i need to permit my virtual attributes also..?
@CONTENT:till now i thought, i have to permit only those attributes which i required to save in database. but recently i used Jcrop to crop my User avatar and it has 4 virtual attributes which will sent after crop, here is my model class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  mount_uploader :avatar, AvatarUploader
  attr_accessor :crop_x, :crop_y, :crop_w, :crop_h

  after_update :crop_avatar

  def crop_avatar
    avatar.recreate_versions! if crop_x.present?
  end
end
 but when i submit after crop, my console log says unpermitted params: crop_x, crop_y, crop_h, crop_w
 and the image is not croped. while if i permit these params.require(:user).permit(:avatar,:crop_x,:crop_y,:crop_h,:crop_w)
 then image croped successfully. so the question is why do i need to permit these virtual attributes, even if this is not saved in database?

@CONTENT:By "visual development environment", I do not mean Microsoft Visual Studio. I'm looking for a node-based IDE in which programs are constructed graphically and converted to plain text at compile time. The content of functions would still have to be typed out, of course, but everything else would be visual. Sort of like a flow chart that you type your code into directly. I feel like this should exist but I can't seem to find anything like it.

@TITLE:Unix: How to clear the serial port I/O buffer?
@CONTENT:I am working on a "high level" C++ interface for the standard PC serial port. When I open the port, I would like to clear the input and output buffers in order not to receive or send data from previous usage of the port. To do that, I use the tcflush function. However, it does not work. How can that be? My "port opening" code can be seen below. Yes I use C++ exceptions but none are getting thrown. That indicates that tcflush returns 0 but it does not clear the buffer. The only way I can clear the input buffer is to read bytes from it until there is none left. This usually takes a couple of seconds and I do not think of it as a solution. Thanks in advance :-) fd = ::open(port.c_str(), O_RDWR | O_NOCTTY);

 The problem can be reduced to the following script, which I have saved as chrometest.py (as seen in the above stacktrace): from selenium import webdriver
browser = webdriver.Chrome()
browser.get("http://www.google.co.uk")
browser.quit()
 This script successfully opens Chrome and navigates to Google. The .quit() then causes the above crash, leaving a dead ChromeDriver instance lying around. What could be causing this, and how can I prevent it? Research has turned up a lot of answers that aren't quite relevant, overcomplicate things or claim it's an issue that was already fixed.

 This are 10 charcters for Chrome 1234

 The problem comes when trying to validate the form. If I have for example the following text 012345
678
 In Firefox the validation passes and the data is saved, but when I try to do the same in Chrome it shows a warning, and prevents it from sending the form. "Please shorten this text to 10 characters or less(you are currently using 11 characters)". I think this validation messages are new in Chrome or at least I haven't see them before Here is an JSFiddle example. To reproduce it in Chrome, you should write a string with 10 charcters then delete 1 and press enter to add a new line. Here is an example of how JavaScript counts JSFiddle length count with js. Don't know which one is the correct value for new line (1 or 2). But since the database (Postgres in my case) and JavaScript consider it as "1" character, I would like to know if there is a way to make Chrome to do the same.

@TITLE:Convert dll to csproj ou sln
@CONTENT:I work on a existing ASP.NET MVC project. The solution uses the FluentNHibernate component(v 1.0.0). Someone in the former team (solution was MVC2) that worked on it modified the component sources (in order to change a behavior). That modified and compiled dll was included in the MVC solution. Now, I converted the solution to the MVC 5, and updated the existing libraries via NuGet packages. Unfortunately, I can't do it the same with FluentNHibernate component, because if I update it, it looses the modified behavior, and produces errors if I use a newer version. The sources of the modified component aren't available. What can I do? I decided to obtain the FluentNHibernate version 1.0.0 from the gitHub, compare the project files, note the differences, and include it in the actual (v 1.4.0.0) FluentNHibernate code. In order to compare the differences, I need to obtain the original code from the (modified) dll. Is there a add-in or something that could convert a dll to a project? I know (and I use) the RedGate's Reflector, but I would like to obtain all necessary c# files from the dll, and not just view a class definition code.

@CONTENT:I'm creating a browser-based game that uses layered canvases and sprite images, and for visual and performance reasons I would like to disable imageSmoothingEnabled by default. It's my understanding that imageSmoothingEnabled isn't available in all browsers, but there are vendor-prefixed versions. I am trying to find an elegant way to disable this attribute by default across all my canvases (in as many browsers as possible). So far, this is my method: context1.imageSmoothingEnabled = false;
context1.mozImageSmoothingEnabled = false;

context1.webkitImageSmoothingEnabled = false;

context2.imageSmoothingEnabled = false;

context3.imageSmoothingEnabled = false;
context3.mozImageSmoothingEnabled = false;
context3.oImageSmoothingEnabled = false;
context3.webkitImageSmoothingEnabled = false;

 Is there a more elegant approach? Is it perhaps possible to change the context's API to default to false, before actually creating each canvas context?

depth (Node n x1 x2) = 1 + max (depth x1) (depth x2)
 How can I modify this for general trees? General trees contain a list of trees, and that is where I am encountering difficulty. Secondly, I want to turn the tree into a list (so I can do operations such as calculating the sum, etc.) Again, I can figure it out for binary trees but not for general trees. --tree into a list.

treeToList:: Tree a -> [a]

    )

[1] => Array

@TITLE:Linq to Entities performance and pregenerating views
@CONTENT:We are taking a long time on first runs of our linq to EF queries. I was surprised to see no difference after pre-generating views. I ran across the following claim on stackoverflow View generation only helps for "standard" queries (e.g., when you call someObject.RelatedEnd.Load() or MyContext.SomeSetName(). It doesn't help for ad hoc queries with LINQ or ESQL, for obvious reasons. Use CompiledQuery to optimize those. When he says "for obvious reasons" I have to say, "Well,not obvious to me yet". If I understand this correctly he is claiming Linq to SQL queries are not affected by pregenerating EF views. I had thought entity views were generic mappings between entities and tables, and bore no relation to any specific query. Is this mistaken? I can see huge amounts of time being used in the first run of our Linq to Entities queries, with dramatically smaller times thereafter, so I assumed views were being generated for the relevant entities and tables. If it isn't an EF view that can be pregenerated taking all that first run time, then what is it? So my question has three parts: Are EF views generated for each query, or do they just relate tables to entities regardless of the queries made? Is the above claim that pregenerating EF views makes no difference in Linq to EF queries correct? Does one have to use CompileQueries instead? What are the "obvious reasons" referred to above? Note: I wouldn't even ask but there are quite a few recommendations on the internet (including msdn) to pregenerate views if you are using EF. This is the only place I have seen it suggested that if you use Linq to Entities then pregenerating is irrelevant to your queries.

I have another plot using a different .txt file, inside these text files is basically this graph but rotated 90 degrees in the x-y plane which DOESN'T give me this weird z = 0 plane of lines.

@TITLE:when to opt for caching in the Lookup component in SSIS
@CONTENT:In SSIS Look up there are 3 types of Caches.. Full Partial and No cache. In our solution it has always been used the default one(Full).Is there any particular scenarios,where it can go for Partial cache/No Cache? In our solutions lockup tables are always small(example:-we have been looking at small tables to get the types or to get description).That might be the reason it has been configure in default(Full cache) mode? Please let me know the valuable suggestions and opinion.

@TITLE:Outputting the contents of a list of a custom data type
@CONTENT:I have a custom data type Movie = String Int [(String,Int)] (Movie Name Year [(Fan,Rating)] and want to do a couple of things: First I want to make a function that averages the Ints from the list of tuples and just outputs that number. So far I have this incomplete function: avgRating :: [DataType] -> Int avgRating [(Movie a b [(fan,rating)])] = sumRatings / (length [<mylist>]) Here I need a function sumRatings to recurse through the list and sum all the ratings, but i'm not sure where to start. The other issue I have here is that i'm not sure what to put where <mylist> is as I would normally give the list a variable name and then use it there, but since I have split the list up to define other variables I can't name it. I hope that makes sense, thanks.

@TITLE:SQL view with dynamic count of columns
@CONTENT:I know it is impossible directly, but maybe with help of sql functions it is possible to create view with dynamic column count? What exactly I want to do is - Create view which's columns would be username (first table's values), date (second table's values), and multiple columns for properties (each third table's row would be column).User table structure - ID and username, Date table structure - ID and datetime, Property table structure - ID, property name, property value, fk user ID (plus one table to relate tables). Result should look something like that (columns): |username| date | property 1|....|property n| Can anyone could show any simple sample ?

@CONTENT:I have a table in mySQL with the following columns: CUSTOMER_CODE | TRANS_TYPE | TRANS_VALUE
 TRANS_TYPE could be either "DRINV" (a sale) or "DRCDT" (a credit). I want to get the total sales per customer, so my query so far is: SELECT CUSTOMER_CODE, SUM(TRANS_VALUE) as SALES FROM DR_TRANS GROUP BY CUSTOMER_CODE
 Problem is this is totaling the sales and credits, instead of giving be sales minus credits. I want the results to be SUM(TRANS_VALUE) where TRANS_TYPE = "DRINV" - SUM(TRANS_VALUE) where TRANS_TYPE = "DRCDT".
 Is it possible to do this in a SQL query?

@LINK:/questions/21976070/custom-map-function-how-does-it-work
@TITLE:Custom map function - how does it work?
@CONTENT:I apologize for the unclear topic title. I have this function in scheme which is a custom implementation of the map function. It works fine, but I got lost trying to understand it. (define (my-map proc . ls)
  (letrec ((iter (lambda (proc ls0)
                   (if (null? ls0)
                       '()
                       (cons (proc (car ls0)) (iter proc (cdr ls0))))))
           (map-rec (lambda (proc ls0)
                     (if (memq '() ls0)
                         '()
                         (cons (apply proc (iter car ls0)) (map-rec proc (iter cdr ls0)))))))
    (map-rec proc ls)))
 The problem lays in cons (proc (car ls0)). If I'm correct, when passing (1 2 3) (4 5 6) to the ls parameter the actual value of it will be ((1 2 3) (4 5 6)). Therefore iter car ls0 in map-rec will pass (1 2 3) to iter. Hence proc (car ls0) in iter will have the form: (car (car (1 2 3))), but this is impossible, right? I know my thinking is flawed somewhere, but I can't figure out where.
@CODE:scheme map (define (my-map proc . ls)
  (letrec ((iter (lambda (proc ls0)
                   (if (null? ls0)
                       '()
                       (cons (proc (car ls0)) (iter proc (cdr ls0))))))
           (map-rec (lambda (proc ls0)
                     (if (memq '() ls0)
                         '()
                         (cons (apply proc (iter car ls0)) (map-rec proc (iter cdr ls0)))))))
    (map-rec proc ls))) cons (proc (car ls0)) (1 2 3) (4 5 6) ls ((1 2 3) (4 5 6)) iter car ls0 map-rec (1 2 3) iter proc (car ls0) iter (car (car (1 2 3))) map map

@TITLE:SELECT2 -> Add data without replacing content
@CONTENT:I've had a look at some other threads but nothing quite as specific. It's not really something that I would assume is hard but I'm not sure how about to do it. Currently I'm using Select2 for a tagging system and next to it I have suggested tags which users would be able to click on and it will add to the box. Instead, each tag is replacing the content and adding itself. I need the adding to be appended into the box without replacing what's already in there. Here's my code: $(document).on('click', ".tag1", function () {
      var value = $(".tag1").html();
      console.log(value);
      $("#selectPretty").val([value]).trigger("change");
});
$(document).on('click', ".tag2", function () {
      var value = $(".tag2").html();
      console.log(value);
      $("#selectPretty").val([value]).trigger("change");
});
 The data is being pulled through via AJAX with a span around each suggested tag. Hope I'm clear enough. Summary: I want to be able to click on each 'tag' and for it to be added, instead it replaces what was already in the box. Thanks
@CODE:$(document).on('click', ".tag1", function () {
      var value = $(".tag1").html();

});

@TITLE:how to fix ArithmeticException error in android
@CONTENT:Actually i dont know where the problem is.I think that it must be in creating TableLayout. I dont know how to fix the error and make the app to work. This program shows the error "java.lang.ArithmeticException : divide by zero" error The program has EditText(edText) which asks for input from user. Its type is NUMBER.(here r is the value from edText) Below the EditText there is a Button(bt) which displays the edText value. Below the button (bt) there is another Button(bt1) which again displays the edText Value. This button must also displays r rows and 4 columns of EditText views i.e, user must enter r*4 input data in EditText. I cant clear the error and i dont know how to clear that error. public class Ybus_Activity extends Activity {

@TITLE:Is this an overflow arithmetic calculation?
@CONTENT:So when I read the book and it says that overflow can't occur when add different signs and subtraction of the same sign. But I have question when I do this: 185 - 122 I converted binary of 122 to 2s complement and did the addition, which is different signs: 185+(-122) and when I add them together, I got the sign bit overflow to 100111111. But if I cut off the MSB on the left, it is the correct answer. Is it an overflow?

@TITLE:Adding threading and email subscriptions to comments [closed]
@CONTENT:I've built a simple rails app with three models, Posts, Users, and Comments. I've tried every commenting gem out there and they all have some shortfall. So I build my own comments system. Users can comment on Posts. Every comment is votable (using acts_as_votable gem). A users score is made up by the sum total votes they have received on their comments. Here is what I have in my schema for the comments:  create_table "comments", force: true do |t|
    t.text     "body"
    t.datetime "created_at"
    t.datetime "updated_at"
    t.integer  "user_id"
    t.integer  "post_id"
  end
 In my user model: class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :comments
  acts_as_voter
end
 In my post model: class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :comments
end
 In my comment model: class Comment < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :post
  belongs_to :user
  acts_as_votable
end
 In my comments controller: class CommentsController < ApplicationController
  def create
    post.comments.create(new_comment_params) do |comment|
      comment.user = current_user
    end
    respond_to do |format|
    format.html {redirect_to post_path(post)}
    end
  end


  def upvote
  @post = Post.find(params[:post_id])
  @comment = @post.comments.find(params[:id])
  @comment.liked_by current_user

<% end %>
 In the user profile views: (this shows the users score <%= (@user.comments.map{|c| c.votes.count}.inject(:+))%>
 How do I implement threading?(at one level, I'm assuming multiple levels just makes it really messy) How do I make the threaded comments votable?(both the parents and children) What has to be done with the routes? How do I ad a simple email notification a user can subscribe to to receive a simple message saying that a new comment has been posted to their thread? How do I pull the users score calculated by all votes received on comments made by the user including child comments?

@TITLE:Setting Loaded GIF as a Background
@CONTENT:Situation: I have a JFrame and I have managed to import the GIF and display it in the Main Panel however it moves all of my other panels down, causing my GUI to be in disarray. Question: How should I go about making the GIF the background instead of adding to the Main Panel Like I am doing? Note: The code is simply making a Jframe ,setting it's details, adding the panels then displaying the GIF as a Jlabel. If you need the code I can display it below.

@TITLE:Error (org.codehaus.mojo) when adding persistence to Maven-Java-project?
@CONTENT:When adding persistence to my Maven-Java-project I can successfully build and compile ("Clean and Build Project" in Netbeans, I suppose it does mvn site) the project, but I won't be able to start it afterwards ("Run Project" in Netbeans). I have been trying around for some time without success. For instance I have tried to delete the org.codehaus.mojo plugin in the pom.xml though there was no changement in my success. Does anyone know this problem? Is there any wrong configuration with my settings for the MySQL database? Or is there an error in the pom.xml? Or in the persistence.xml? Error from NetBeans IDE: cd /home/myuser/NetBeansProjects/mavenglasses; JAVA_HOME=/home/myuser/jdk1.7.0_51 /home/myuser/netbeans-7.4/java/maven/bin/mvn "-Dexec.args=-jar ${basedir}/target/mavenglasses-1.0.jar" -Dexec.executable=/home/myuser/jdk1.7.0_51/bin/java org.codehaus.mojo:exec-maven-plugin:1.2.1:exec

@TITLE:How to display Dropbox files in a listview in android?
@CONTENT:I've been browsing answers on here for a while and have employed most of the answers in my code but it still doesn't seem to work. I just want to display a listview of the content in a dropbox account and also give the user an option to download a file/folder. My MainActivity used to crash right after opening it, surrounding my onPostExecute content with a try/catch statement handling NullPointerException solved the crashing. But the app still fails to display the contents in Dropbox. At the most basic stage with just a MainActivity and a DLFiles (AsyncTask) class, how do I make this work? I've been at this for days, please help! Thanks in advance. MainActivity.java public class MainActivity extends Activity {

@CONTENT:So I'm doing this in my AppView var flowerModel = new app.DataModel({title: "flower", values: ["tulip","rose","dandelion"], dataToShow:["tulip", "rose", "dandelion"], data: data});
    var timelineModel = new app.TimeChartModel({data: flowerModel.getDisplayedData(), titlesToShow: flowerModel.get('dataToShow')});


    tableCollection.add(flowerModel);

    this.centerView = new app.TimeChartView({model: flowerModel, el : timechart});
    this.rightView = new app.TableView({model: flowerModel});
 In my TimeChartView init method I do this- initialize: function(){
        this.model.bind('change','render');
            //other, irrelevant things
 } and in my flowerModel I have this method, which works when a checkbox is ticked - events: {
    'click .data-type' : 'collapseDatum',
    'click .show-datum' : 'addDatumToShow',
},

addDatumToShow: function(e){
        var test = $(this.$el).find(".datum-list").find(":checked");
        newDataToShow = [];
        _.each(test, function(value,key,list){
            var title = $(value).data("title");
            newDataToShow.push(title);
        });
        this.model.set("dataToShow", newDataToShow);
    },
 The error happens on the this.model.set('dataToShow', newDataToShow). I'm really not sure why and any advice on how to debug would be helpful. I don't think I'm doing anything crazy, or unusual here.

@TITLE:How to generate an array of 256 distinct numbers
@CONTENT:I have this: #include <iostream>    
using namespace std;   
int main()
{
    int a[256];
    int b;
    int k;
    for (int i = 0; i < 256; i ++){

    k = 0;

    if (k == 0){a[i] = b;}
    if (k==1){i--;}
    }

    return 0;
}
 This generates an array of integers from 0 to 255. Each integer only occur once in the array. My problem is that this code takes quite a while to execute because for each new random integer I check whether or not the integer is already in the array. So I have to wait until all the integers from 0 to 255 have showed up as a random number. My question is: Is there is a better way to do this?
@CODE:#include <iostream>    
using namespace std;   
int main()
{
    int a[256];
    int b;

    b = rand()%256;
    k = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j< i; j ++)
        {
            if (a[j] == b){k = 1;}  
        }
    if (k == 0){a[i] = b;}

@TITLE:Neo4j 2.0 Merge with unique constraints performance bug?
@CONTENT:Here's the situation: I have a node that has a property ContactId which is set as unique and indexed. The node label is :Contact (node:Contact {ContactId:1}) I have another node similar to that pattern for Address: (node2:Address {AddressId:1}) I now try to add a new node that (among other properties, includes ContactId (for referencing)) (node3:ContactAddress {AddressId:1,ContactId:1}) When I run a merge command for each, the time for adding a node that contains a property that is set as unique in another node type seems to make the process much slower. The ContactAddress node only contains relational properties between the Contact and Address nodes. Contact and Address nodes contain up to 10 properties each. Is this a bug, where Neo4j is check the property key -> value -> then node label? Code and screenshot below: string strForEach = string.Format("(n in {{{0}}} |  
MERGE (c:{1} {{{2} : n.{2}}}) SET c = n)", propKey, label, PK_Field);

@TITLE:Dependency injection: how to use/implement PicoContainer Framework in R
@CONTENT:Questions General question How would you go about starting to implement the PicoContainer-Framework in R? Specific question How would the "pico registry (mechanism)" actually look like? I came up with a "poor man's version" that only works for a single registration process (see class DefaultPicoContainer in the example below; at this point method getComponentInstance() doesn't actually make use of the information getRefClass("MovieLister") to find registered components) Example AFAIU, there aren't any implementations of the PicoContainer-Framework in R yet, so I thought about how this might look like. This is what I could come up with so far. It's inspired by Martin Fowler's article on dependency injection. 1. Example for Business Logic Layer Interface (class) MovieFinder setRefClass(
    Class="MovieFinder",

        initialize=function(finder=NULL) {
            callSuper(finder=finder)
        },
        moviesDirectedBy=function(arg) {
            allMovies <- finder$findAll()
            out <- lapply(seq(along=nrow(allMovies)), function(ii) {
                movie <- allMovies[ii,]
                out   <- movie
                if (movie$director != arg) {
                    out <- NULL
                }
                return(out)
            })
            out
        }
    )
)
 Class ColonMovieFinder setRefClass(
    Class="ColonMovieFinder",
    contains=c("MovieFinder"),  ## Implements the 'MovieFinder' interface
    fields=list(
        filename="character"
    ),

@TITLE:How to determine whether file share server is online? [duplicate]
@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: Fast way to check if a server is accessible over the network in C# 4 answers If I want to check server availability but I don't know about its shares, I can type its UNC name (or IP address) into Windows Explorer window even without server share directory: How I can use this programatically in .NET to verify whether server is online? I'm trying My.Computer.FileSystem.DirectoryExists(UNCPath)
 but this works only for UNC paths like \\MY_SERVER\Users, it is not inteded to use with \\MY_SERVER. I would like to avoid Ping and stick with functionality which works when file system works because some servers can have ICMP_ECHO disabled due to security reasons. (In case if you wish to post some code, feel free to choose VB or C#.)

@LINK:/questions/21923438/how-to-allow-addons-content-script-access-javascript-variables-from-the-current
@TITLE:How to allow addon's content script access Javascript variables from the current tab?
@CONTENT:Supposed my add-on has to access a Javascript variable from a webpage. Let's take https://mozilla.org. There is a global variable called optimizelyCode. My addon will only work if this variable is accessible. How do I let my pageMod do that? To experiment, here are some tutorial scripts: var widgets = require("sdk/widget");
var tabs = require("sdk/tabs");

var widget = widgets.Widget({
  id: "mozilla-link",
  label: "Mozilla website",
  contentURL: "http://www.mozilla.org/favicon.ico",
  onClick: function() {
    tabs.activeTab.attach({
      contentScriptWhen: 'end',
      contentScript:
        'console.log(optimizelyCode)'
        })
    }
});
 and var pageMod = require("sdk/page-mod");

pageMod.PageMod({
  include: "*.mozilla.org",
  contentScriptWhen: 'end',
  contentScript: 'console.log(optimizelyCode);'
});
 I get Reference/Undefined error because optimizelyCode is not avaiaible to addon. In this example I am not even using content script file. As far as I know, I can only access basic DOM stuff like getElementById that kind of methods. How can I access these webpage local JS variables? Reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/Guides/Content_Scripts/Loading_Content_Scripts
@CODE:optimizelyCode var widgets = require("sdk/widget");
var tabs = require("sdk/tabs");

var widget = widgets.Widget({

  onClick: function() {
    tabs.activeTab.attach({

    }

@LINK:/questions/21920910/why-is-a-line-shape-on-a-canvas-drifting-away-while-dragging
@TITLE:Why is a Line shape on a Canvas drifting away while dragging?
@CONTENT:I see a strange behaviour dragging in Line shape over a Canvas that I cannot explain. The Line shape is in a Thumb DataTemplate like so: <DataTemplate DataType="{x:Type vm:MyLine}">
    <Thumb DragDelta="Thumb_DragDelta">
        <Thumb.Template>
            <ControlTemplate TargetType="Thumb">
                <Line Fill="LightBlue" StrokeThickness="2" Y1="{Binding Y1}" Y2="{Binding Y2}" X1="{Binding X1}" X2="{Binding X2}" Stroke="LightBlue" x:Name="Line"/>
            </ControlTemplate>
        </Thumb.Template>
    </Thumb>
</DataTemplate>
 The Canvas is ItemsPanelTemplate of a ListBox. In the ListBox.ItemContainerStyle there is no Canvas.Top or Canvas.Left Binding or Setter. Also no Binding for Width and Height. The Line on the Canvs is dragging but it drifts away from the mouse position. Fairly wild and quick. In code behind the dragging has the effect: line.X1 += e.HorizontalChange; line.X2 += e.HorizontalChange;
line.Y1 += e.VerticalChange; line.Y2 += e.VerticalChange;
 The setters for X..Y raise PropertyChanged otherwise the Line wouldn't move. What should I do for a proper dragging behaviour for Line and why? Binding Mode=OneWay makes no difference.
@CODE:<DataTemplate DataType="{x:Type vm:MyLine}">
    <Thumb DragDelta="Thumb_DragDelta">
        <Thumb.Template>
            <ControlTemplate TargetType="Thumb">
                <Line Fill="LightBlue" StrokeThickness="2" Y1="{Binding Y1}" Y2="{Binding Y2}" X1="{Binding X1}" X2="{Binding X2}" Stroke="LightBlue" x:Name="Line"/>
            </ControlTemplate>
        </Thumb.Template>
    </Thumb>
</DataTemplate> ItemsPanelTemplate ListBox ListBox.ItemContainerStyle Canvas.Top Canvas.Left line.X1 += e.HorizontalChange; line.X2 += e.HorizontalChange;

 (This is then repeted to EOF, with intervals[3 to n] for n Item (layer of annotation) in a file. Somebody proposed a solution using rPython R package. Unfortunately : I don't have a good knowledge of Python The version of rPython is not available for R.3.0.2 (which I am using). My aim is to develop this parser for my analysis exclusively under R environment. Right now my aim is to segment this file into multiple data frame. Each dataframe should contain one item (layer of annotation). # Load the Data
txtgrid <- read.delim("./xxx_01_xx.textgrid", sep=c("=","\n"), dec=".", header=FALSE)
# Erase White spaces (use stringr package)
txtgrid[,1] <- str_trim(txtgrid[,1])
# Convert row.names to numeric 
num.row<- as.numeric(row.names(txtgrid))
# Redefine the original textgrid and add those rows (I want to "keep them in case for later process)
txtgrid <- data.frame(num.row,txtgrid)
colnames(txtgrid) <- c("num.row","object", "value")
head(txtgrid)
 The output of head(txtgrid) is very raw, so here is the first 20 lines of the textgrid txtgrid[1:20,]:    num.row          object                value

 Now that I pre-processed it, I can : # Find the number of the rows where I want to split (i.e. Item)
tier.begining <- txtgrid[grep("item", txtgrid$object, perl=TRUE), ]
# And save those numbers in a variable
x <- as.numeric(row.names(tier.begining))
 This variable x gives me the numbers-1 where my Data should be splitted in several dataframes. I have 18 items -1 (the first item is item[] and include all the other items. So vector x is :      x

[18] 45018
 How can I tell to R : to segment this dataframe in multiple dataframes textgrids$nameoftheItem in such a way that I get as many data frame as I have of items?, for example : textgrid$phones
         item [1]:
            class = "IntervalTier"

 I wanted to use txtgrid.new <- split(txtgrid, f=x)
 But this message is right : Warning message: In split.default(x = seq_len(nrow(x)), f = f, drop = drop, ...) : data length is not a multiple of split variable
 I don't get the desired outputed, it seems that row numbers don't follow each other and that the file is all mixed up. I have also tried some which, daply (from plyr) & subset functions but never got them to work properly! I am welcoming any idea to structure this data properly & efficiently. Ideally I should be able to link items (layers of annotation) between them (xmin & xmax of different layers), as well as multiple textgrid files, this is just the beginning.

@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: android.os.NetworkOnMainThreadException 30 answers I've an activity (MainActivity) that is supposed to do a version check of my up with a server and allow the users to login into accounts. the problem is that both the functions use network connection (obvously), they work with a 3g connection but i try to use a wifi connection the app throws NetworkOnMainThread exception. the even more strange thing (to me at least) is that this problem only occurs with this activity, all other activity can access both 3g and wifi and they uses the same Class as MainActivity. how can it be?

@LINK:/questions/21911323/stdin-stdout-python-how-to-reuse-the-same-input-file-twice
@TITLE:stdin stdout python: how to reuse the same input file twice?
@CONTENT:I am quite new to Python and even newer to stdin stdout method. Nevertheless I need to make my script usable for UNIX commands, in order to make it possible for example to process 2 input files at once with my script. This script works perfectly well with command line arguments: newlist = []
def f1()
 .... 
def f2(input_file):
  vol_id = sys.argv[3]
  for line in input_file:
  if ... :
    line = line.replace('abc','def')
    line = line.replace('id', 'id'+vol_id)
  ....
  newlist.append(line)
return newlist

def main():
 if len(sys.argv) < 4:
   print 'usage: ./myscript.py [file_in... file_out... volume_id]'
   sys.exit(1)

 else:

    filename = sys.argv[1]
    filename_out = sys.argv[2]


    tree = etree.parse(filename)
    extract(tree)

    input_file = open(filename, 'rU')
    change_class(input_file)

    file_new = open(filename_out, 'w')
    for x in newlist:

        if '\n' in x:                   
           x = x.replace('\n', '')                
        print>>file_new, x
 When I tried to add stdin stdout to it, I first had a problem with reading the same input file first, and for this reason made some chages so that it would be actually open only once. Here is my modified main():             filename = sys.argv[1]
            filename_out = sys.argv[2]

            if filename == '-':
               filename = sys.stdin
            else:
                input_file = open(filename, 'rU')


            if filename_out == '-':
                filename_out = sys.stdout
                file_new = filename_out
            else:
                file_new = open(filename_out, 'w')

            input_file = open(filename, 'rU')
            tree = etree.fromstring(input_file)
            extract(tree)

            change_class(input_file)

            for x in newlist:

                if '\n' in x:                   
                   x = x.replace('\n', '')                
                print>>file_new, x
 Then I ran my script like this: ./myscript.py - - volumeid < inputfile > outputfile And I got this error message: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./myscript.py", line 191, in <module>
    main()
  File "./myscript.py", line 175, in main
    input_file = open(filename, 'rU')

@TITLE:Broadcasting using the protocol Zab in ZooKeeper
@CONTENT:Good morning, I am new to ZooKeeper and its protocols and I am interested in its broadcast protocol Zab. Could you provide me with a simple java code that uses the Zab protocol of Zookeeper? I have been searching about that but I did not succeed to find a code that shows how can I use Zab. In fact what I need is simple, I have a MapReduce code and I want all the mappers to update a variable (let's say X) whenever they succeed to find a better value of X (i.e. a bigger value). In this case, the leader has to compare the old value and the new value and then to broadcast the actual best value to all mappers. How can I do such a thing in Java? Thanks in advance, Regards

@CONTENT:I am all new to the android push world and I have been struggling a little, for couple of days now. I created and implemented the GCM client side of it without a problem. I also created my google cloud project, enabled android push notif.s and got my Project Number, Project ID and API Key. So far so good, then I wanted to get to the implementing the server side of it but for some reason I have no idea what I should do, where should I write the code? Is it going to be a web service like restful? I have been digging the http://developer.android.com/google/gcm/ccs.html but I got no good outcome of what I should do. I haven't found a proper tutorial about this on the internet too, they are all about the deprecated versions of push like C2DM. I'd really appreciate the help. Regards. Note: I'm using Mssql.

@TITLE:Convert QDate to seconds
@CONTENT:I take date from QDateTimeEdit and convert it to seconds like this: import time
from datetime import datetime

date = self.__ui.dateTimeEdit.date().toString("dd/MM/yy")
dateString = str(date)

seconds = time.mktime(datetime.strptime(dateString, "%d/%m/%y").timetuple()) 
 This works well, but since it looks to long to me, my question is: Is it possible to convert self.__ui.dateTimeEdit.date() directly, without those string conversions? EDIT1 Unfortunately toMSecsSinceEpoch() as falsetru suggested, doesn't work for me. AttributeError: 'QDateTime' object has no attribute 'toMSecsSinceEpoch'
 I'm using PyQt 4.7.1 for Python 2.6 EDIT2 based on jonrsharpe's answer I've escaped string conversions:     date = self.__ui.dateTimeEdit.date().toPyDate()
    seconds = time.mktime(date.timetuple()) 
 result is the same. EDIT3 even shorter solution based on falsetru's comment: self.__ui.dateTimeEdit.dateTime().toTime_t()
@CODE:QDateTimeEdit import time
from datetime import datetime

date = self.__ui.dateTimeEdit.date().toString("dd/MM/yy")
dateString = str(date)

seconds = time.mktime(datetime.strptime(dateString, "%d/%m/%y").timetuple()) self.__ui.dateTimeEdit.date() toMSecsSinceEpoch() AttributeError: 'QDateTime' object has no attribute 'toMSecsSinceEpoch' date = self.__ui.dateTimeEdit.date().toPyDate()

@TITLE:Oracle - Function not working
@CONTENT:Oracle - Function not working So I got no idea what i'm doing wrong. I've been at it for hours and i'd really appreciate some help. So basically I have 2 tables, one is called student and it's a list of students with student_no being the primary key, and the other table called enrol which basically has the list of programs that the student is enrolled into. So i've written a function that compares the logged in student's username, which in this case is the student_no, to the list of students and makes sure that the logged in user is a student. Then it compares the student_no with the enrol table to seek out any programs the user is enrolled into. So that in essence when I SELECT * FROM yaser.enrol (the table owner is yaser) I should see only a few records from the enrol list. Instead I get the error: failed to execute policy function. Here is my Function: -- Create policy function to be called when 'ENROL' table is accessed
create or replace function f_policy_enrol (schema in varchar2, tab in varchar2)
-- Function will return a string that is used as a WHERE clause                       
return varchar2
as
 v_student_no     varchar2(10);
 is_student       number:=0;
 v_user           varchar2(100);
 out_string       varchar2(400) default '1=2 ';

begin
  -- get session user
  v_user := lower(sys_context('userenv','session_user'));

  -- Is the user a student?
  begin
    select student_no into v_student_no from student where lower(student_no) = v_user;
    is_student:=1;
  exception
    when no_data_found then
    v_student_no := 0;
  end;

  -- If it's a student, then they are only allowed to see their record only.
  if is_student = 1 then
     out_string := out_string||'or student_no = '||v_student_no||' ';
  end if;

  return out_string;
end;
/
 And this is the Policy that I invoke: begin
dbms_rls.add_policy('yaser',
                    'enrol',
                    'accesscontrol_enrol',
                    'yaser',
                    'f_policy_enrol',
                    policy_type => dbms_rls.context_sensitive);
end;
/
 As said before..I'm not sure where i'm going wrong. Whether in the policy or function. ANY HELP would be greatly appreciated! If you have any questions, i'm happy to answer just as soon as I get some free time at work! Thanks in advance! Yaser

@CONTENT:I'd like to force a specific heap allocation to return an address that's 64-byte aligned, because that's a cache line boundary. I thought I could do it like this int *p = new alignas(64) int;
 but none of my compilers seem to give p an address that's a multiple of 64. Here's how I'm checking: #include <iostream>

int main()
{
  int *p = new alignas(64) int;
  std::cout << long(p) % 64 << '\n';    // should print 0
}
 I must be doing something wrong. But what?

@TITLE:a textview in a listview' s row cannot click after setting descendantFocusability=blocksDescendants
@CONTENT:I write a customized item layout for a listview. The layout has many widgets and some will have its own clicklistener. When I click the row, sometimes the listview' s onListItemClick work, but sometimes not. After I spent some time searching, I find a way, setting android:descendantFocusability="blocksDescendants" in the layout' s root. It works, but only one textview cannot work,(the clickable, fucusable attr have been tried). In the list' s adapter, I set the textview' s onClickListener, it works. But that' s not nature, does anyone know how to solve it? btw, is there a way to distinguish diffderent widget' click? Now, no matter what I click(except that textview), the whole row' s background selector got changed. many thanks! // my list row layout root <LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"

@CODE:127.0.0.1       localhost domain.dev site1.domain.dev site2.domain.dev $site_addr sed -i'.bak' '7i7 $site_addr.domain.dev' /etc/hosts 7i7

@TITLE:Serial block doesn't work with simulink coder
@CONTENT:I receive some data signals from Serial Port using Serial Receive block (and Serial Configuration block of course). I use it to move a marker in a video. It works during simulation but when I generate .exe file using Simulink Coder marker doesn't move during execution. It would seem that it does not receive data from serial. *EDIT:*The original data is an int16 but the "source" is built on Arduino Mega2560 using Target Support Package and so using an Arduino serial send block it generates the source on USB COM port with a baud rate of 9600. Because Arduino serial block wants only uint8 I used a byte pack block before Arduino Serial block. The parameters of byte pack block are: 1)Input port data types = {'int16'} 2)Byte Alignment = 2 In model that receives I use Serial Receive block from instrument control toolbox with: (Serial Configuration Block:) Baud Rate = 9600;
Data Bits = 8;
Stop Bits = 1;
Byte Order  = LittleEndian;
Flow Control = none;
Time Out = 10;
Header = none;
Terminator = none;
Data size = [2 1];
Data Type = uint8;
Enable blocking mode = flag;
Action when data is unavailable = output last received value;
Block sample time = (same sample time setted in the model built on Arduino)
I have connected this Serial Receive Block to a Byte Unpack block with:
Output dimensions = {[1]};
Output Port Data types = {'int16'} (data type of original signal)
 Suggestions?

@TITLE:load osmdroid offline custom maptiles faster
@CONTENT:I've a mapView which loads custom mapTiles from a local storage through *.zip package. I'm using a customMapSource class which implements ITileSource Now I want my mapTiles to be loaded faster and properly, is there any effective technique to so? Can this be runned as a thread or a AsynTask which can load/cache mapTiles in the background? The reason I'm asking this is I'm using multiple fragments in my application. And when I return to this mapView fragment, it tries to load the tiles over and over again, and everytime system.gc is being called multiple times. I sense there is something wrong in my design. And more over, I'm not even adding Fragment to backStack which saves the state (basically this restoring state is quite confusing, I'm unable to achieve this; that's why I'm using replace transaction and every transaction is new which makes my mapView load everytime I tap on the navigational drawer list).

@LINK:/questions/21871027/rotating-in-itextsharp-while-preserving-comment-location-orientation
@TITLE:Rotating in Itextsharp while preserving comment location & orientation
@CONTENT:To summarize, I'm using Itextsharp to import specific pages from a PDF, possibly rotate, resize or otherwise alter that page, and exporting it into a new PDF. To this end I'm using the PDFWriter class from Itext. The problem I'm running into is that when using the writer class, it doesn't appear to be including the visible annotations that appear on the source page (in my case it's a comment) in the output page. Interestingly it does include the embedded OCR without issue. Additionally, when using the Itext PDFcopy class it does work just as I want it to (copying comments properly to source), unfortunately PDFcopy doesn't have a lot of easily accessible functionality for the sorts of things I need to do with the page (e.g. resizing pages). So I am looking for one of two solutions: -Preferably I'd like to continue to use the writer class, but need it to copy/duplicate any visible annotations etc. from the source pages and include them in the output. -Need some example code of using the PDFCopy class to resize a page. There is a pdfcopy.Setpagesize function (which doesn't work, which I suspect means I'm doing it wrong), but I have basically no idea how to properly scale the source page when it needs to be resized. Here's some pseudo code to give you an idea of where I'm at in terms of using the PDFWriter class:       '...

Dim MS As New MemoryStream()
Dim document As New Document
Dim WriterPDF As PdfWriter = PdfWriter.GetInstance(document, MS)
Dim reader As PdfReader = Nothing
Dim cb As PdfContentByte = WriterPDF.DirectContent
reader = New PdfReader(New MemoryStream(File.ReadAllBytes(FilePathList.Item(ItemNum))))

For Each PageItem As Integer In PageNumList
   Dim page As PdfImportedPage = WriterPDF.GetImportedPage(reader, PageItem)
   Dim PageSizeStandard As Rectangle = PageSize.LETTER
  document.SetPageSize(PageSizeStandard)

   Dim tm = New System.Drawing.Drawing2D.Matrix()

        'code to resize, rotate etc... tm.scale, tm.rotate, etc.

   cb.AddTemplate(page, tm)
   document.NewPage()

next
 As the alternative, the PDFCopy code I'm using for rotation involves:  Dim MasterCopy As PdfCopy = New PdfCopy(document, New FileStream(outputPath, FileMode.Create))
      '...
 Dim PageDict As PdfDictionary = reader.GetPageN(PageItem)
' can get current rotation with this... 
' Dim Rot As PdfNumber = PageDict.Get(PdfName.ROTATE)

      '...
Dim RotatedPageSizeHeight As Single = reader.GetPageSizeWithRotation(PageItem).Height
Dim RotatedPageSizeWidth As Single = reader.GetPageSizeWithRotation(PageItem).Width

If RotatedPageSizeWidth > RotatedPageSizeHeight Then
     PageDict.Put(PdfName.ROTATE, New PdfNumber(90))
     'there is a Pdfname.Size, but no idea if that's even what I need or how to use it.
     'with the writer class I use a matrix to scale the page, works fine. 
End If

      '... 
MasterCopy.AddPage(page)

@CONTENT:My question is simple: How can I do multi-targeting in command line compiler (csc.exe), especially to .Net 4 Client Profile? edit: Ok, Is my question too simple? The compiler, targeting to .net 4.5, is %windir%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\csc.exe. When I run csc source.cs, the output is targeting to .net 4.5. I want to target to .net 4 client profile in command line compiler(csc.exe), such as csc /targetFramework="v4.0;Profile=Client" source.cs. (Of course, there's no option /targetFramework...)

@TITLE:Move assignment operator not being called
@CONTENT:I've just been doing some exercises with move semantic, and I can't seem to figure out why my move assignment operator is not being called My class is as follows (please ignore any bad practice that is not relevant to the question): private:
    int sz;
    double* elems;

public:
    Vector(int size):sz(size), elems(new double[size])
    {
         for(int i=0; i!=sz; ++i)
         {
             elems[i] = i;
         }
    }

    ~Vector()
    {
         std::cout << "Destruct " << std::endl; delete [] elems;
    }

    double& operator[](int i)
    {
        return elems[i];
    }
    const double& operator[](int i)const 
    {
         return elems[i];
    }

    //operator+ to add vectors
    friend Vector operator+(const Vector& a, const Vector& b)
    {

        Vector ret(a.sz);
        if(a.sz!=b.sz)
            return 0;
        std::cout << "Adding" << std::endl;
        for(int i=0; i!=a.sz; ++i)
        {
            ret[i] = a[i] + b[i];
        }

        return ret;
     }

     //move constructor
     Vector(Vector&& a): sz(a.sz),elems(a.elems)
     {
          std::cout << "Move constructor"<< std::endl;
          a.elems = nullptr;
          a.sz = 0;
     }

     //move assignment
     Vector& operator=(Vector&& a)
     {
        std::cout << "Moveeee" << std::endl;
        delete [] elems;
        elems = a.elems;
        sz = a.sz;
        a.elems = nullptr;
        a.sz = 0;

        return *this;
     }
 Now my test case is as follows: Vector v1(3);
Vector v2(3);
Vector v3(3);
Vector v4 = v1+v2;
 The output is as follows: Adding
Move constructor
Destruct
Destruct
Destruct
Destruct
Destruct
 What I expect is line Vector v4 = v1+v2; to call the move assignment, but it doesn't. Instead it calls the move constructor. I even tried Vector v4 = std::move(v2);, but that also didn't work and called the move constructor. Any idea why the move assignment is not being called?
@CODE:private:
    int sz;
    double* elems;

         }
    }

    ~Vector()
    {
         std::cout << "Destruct " << std::endl; delete [] elems;
    }

    double& operator[](int i)
    {

@CONTENT:I am working in a Excel VSTO project with C#. For certain columns, I have set the NumberFormat to Text using someCell.EntireColumn.NumberFormat = "@";
 But when numbers do happen to be in these columns, Excel shows a green arrow with warning "Number Stored as Text". I want to suppress this warning message. I know how to do that in Excel: Options -> Formulas -> in Error checking rules, uncheck "Numbers formatted as text or preceded by an apostrophe". Is it possible to do this in C# code, and only to certain cells/ranges? Thanks!

@LINK:/questions/21862753/log-exceptions-handled-in-try-catch-with-elmah
@TITLE:Log exceptions handled in try..catch with Elmah
@CONTENT:I'm trying to log with Elmah exceptions handled in try...catch blocks. I have added a global handle error filter on Global.axax: public static void RegisterGlobalFilters(GlobalFilterCollection filters)
{
    filters.Add(new ElmahHandledErrorLoggerFilter());
    filters.Add(new HandleErrorAttribute());
}
 This is my ElmahHandledErrorLoggerFilter: public class ElmahHandledErrorLoggerFilter : IExceptionFilter
{
    public void OnException(ExceptionContext context)
    {
        if (context.ExceptionHandled)
            ErrorSignal.FromCurrentContext().Raise(context.Exception);
    }
}
 It will only log the Exception as in try{ ... }catch{ throw new Exception(); }. But that's not the problem, the problem is that I have a method with a try-catch called from the code already inside another try-catch. In this case although I put throw new Exception() inside the catch of the inner-method it doesn't log the exception, it goes back to the catch in the first method without logging the Exception. For example: public void MainMethod()
{
    try
    {
        SecondMethod();
    }
    catch
    {
       ....second method jump here.....
    }
}

public void SecondMethod()
{
    try
    {
        int a =0;
        int b =;
        int result = b/a;
    }
    catch
    {
        throw new Exception();
    }
}
 The exception thrown by SecondMethod is not being logged by Elmah. It goes back to the main method catch. If the main method catch also has a throw new Exception() code then it logs the exception. However it will be logged with the stack trace pointing to MainMethod and not to the SecondMethod. What I wanted what was that every time it reaches a catch without rethrowing a new Exception, Elmah would log the exception. This is because I have many try-catch blocks in my application and I want to log these exceptions without manually logging on each try-catch. However if you tell me how can I log the exception from SecondMethod that would be fine.
@CODE:try...catch Global.axax public static void RegisterGlobalFilters(GlobalFilterCollection filters)
{
    filters.Add(new ElmahHandledErrorLoggerFilter());
    filters.Add(new HandleErrorAttribute());
} ElmahHandledErrorLoggerFilter public class ElmahHandledErrorLoggerFilter : IExceptionFilter
{
    public void OnException(ExceptionContext context)
    {
        if (context.ExceptionHandled)
            ErrorSignal.FromCurrentContext().Raise(context.Exception);
    }
} try{ ... }catch{ throw new Exception(); } throw new Exception() public void MainMethod()
{
    try
    {
        SecondMethod();
    }
    catch
    {
       ....second method jump here.....
    }
}

public void SecondMethod()
{
    try
    {
        int a =0;
        int b =;
        int result = b/a;
    }
    catch
    {
        throw new Exception();
    }
} SecondMethod throw new Exception() MainMethod SecondMethod SecondMethod

Here is the code showing how I am doing it. It's still in development. So all it is meant to do for now is send a dummy email message with a picture of a bumble bee embedded in it. Yet when I receive the email in my Gmail inbox, I see only the following text-based email. The various Mime parts of the email show up in the payload of the email as text. I clicked the "Show Original" button in Gmail and cut-n-pasted the entire email below so you can see what I get. Can someone suggest what I'm doing wrong here? And a possible solution?

@CONTENT:I seem to be have a great deal of trouble with a simple issue. Yes I'm new to c# but I try to learn what I can without jumping to post a question. In this case I just think I'm not asking the right question. No code samples will help here because I'm talking about the basics ( implementation ). I have not really coded anything yet, just use the visual builder to create my windows forms and menus. The issue I'm having is when I select a menu item (call it: set paths ) I want that list view on my main form to load from the path selected when I hit ok on form2. So I did a simple find folder dialog and I have my new path stored on form2 in a text box. When I hit ok on that form2 I want my listview form1 to populate. I know how to do all of this but I can not for the life of me access form1 from form2 or vice versa. I tried making a call back function but I get that non-static variable cannot be referenced... error because my form1 is static, so I can't create any non static methods. I looked in to EventArgs but that just seems like an over kill for such a common request. So what is the general way to do this?

@TITLE:How to Read and Mark(Highlight) a pdf file using C#
@CONTENT:I have a pdf file which i am Reading as string page by page.Now from page 4 onwards my pdf contains billing information.These Billing information are under section for Example :- say one is Local Billing information and other is STD billing information etc.Now as per my requirement if user wants to validate Local Billing information my code should read all the Local Billing data and validate it,in case any data(row) validation gets failed it should highlight that row of the PDF File. Here is my Code in c# public static string ReadPdfFile(string fileName)
    {

@TITLE:How to send Inline images in Email with Python/Django?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to send an email with an inline image using Python/Django. Here is the code showing how I am doing it. It's still in development. So all it is meant to do for now is send a dummy email message with a picture of a bumble bee embedded in it. Yet when I receive the email in my Gmail inbox, I see only the following text-based email. The various Mime parts of the email show up in the payload of the email as text. I clicked the forward button and cut-n-pasted the entire email below so you can see what I get. Can someone suggest what I'm doing wrong here? And a possible solution?

@TITLE:dynamically specifying floating point number size in a function-enclosed sscanf statement
@CONTENT:I have a structured data file consisting of header lines interspersed with blocks of data. I am reading each block of data (as defined by the header line) into a separate cell of a cell array. For instance, suppose that after loading the data with textscan, I have a cell array x and an array of indices of header lines and EOF (headerIdx) of the following form: x={'header line 1';'98.78743';'99.39717';'99.93578';'100.40125';'100.79166';'101.10525';'101.34037';'101.49553';'101.56939';'101.56072';'101.4685';'101.29184';'101.03002';'100.68249';'header line 2';'100.24887';'99.72897';'99.12274';'98.43036';'97.65215';'96.78864';'95.84054';'header line 3';'3.2';'4.31';'2.7';'4.6';'9.3'};
headerIdx=[1;16;24;30];
 I then attempt to extract each block of data below a header line into a separate element of a cell array using sscanf and str2mat (as suggested by this post). Initially, this approach failed because the elements within a given block of data were of different length. This can be solved by including a numerical flag for the '%f' argument to help sscanf know where to delimit the input data (as suggested by this post). One can then use a strategy such as the following to effect the conversion of structured data to a cell array of block-specific double arrays: extract_data = @(n) sscanf(str2mat(x(headerIdx(n)+1:headerIdx(n+1)-1)).',['%' num2str(size(str2mat(x(headerIdx(n)+1:headerIdx(n+1)-1)).',1)) 'f']);
extracted_data = arrayfun(extract_data,1:numel(headerIdx)-1,'UniformOutput',false);
 The numerical flag of the format string can either be set to something arbitrarily large to encompass all the data, or can be set on a block-specific basis as I have done in the example above. The latter approach leads to redundant evaluation of str2mat (once for the input to sscanf and once for the input to the '%f' string generator. Can this redundancy be avoided without using loop statements that store the output of the str2mat command in a temporary variable? Note that one cannot simply take the output of the size command applied to the output of str2mat(x).' on the entire data set because the header lines are generally going to be the lines with the greatest number of characters. Finally, I have constructed the x matrix above to reflect the fact that some blocks of data may have different precision than other blocks. This is the reason to set the format string in a block-specific manner. My testing has shown that despite accurate construction of a block-specific format string (['%' num2str(size(str2mat(x(headerIdx(n)+1:headerIdx(n+1)-1)).',1)) 'f']), the data in all elements of the resulting cell array (extracted_data) are ultimately forced to have the same precision (see below). Why is this the case, and how can it be corrected? extracted_data{:}

@LINK:/questions/21838758/what-false-true-really-mean-for-ipreinserteventlisteners
@TITLE:What false/true really mean for IPreInsertEventListeners?
@CONTENT:I recently have found out how to audit instances with the IPreDeleteEventListener, IPreInsertEventListener and IPreUpdateEventListener in the NHibernate.Event namespace. However, it still confuses me what shall these event return either on successful or unsuccessful finality. For example, let's take a look at Ayende's blog article found here: NHibernate IPreUpdateEventListener & IPreInsertEventListener Following his example, one could implement the interfaces as following: public class AuditEventListener : IPreInsertEventListener {
    public bool OnPreInsert(OnPreInsert @event) {
        var audit = @event.Entity as IHaveAuditInformation;
        if (audit == null) return false;

        var time = DateTime.Now;
        var name = WindowsIdentity.GetCurrent().Name;

        Set(@event.Persister, @event.State, "CreatedAt", time);
        Set(@event.Persister, @event.State, "CreatedBy", name);

        audit.CreatedAt = time;
        audit.CreatedBy = name;

        return false;
    }
}
 What odes it actually mean to return either true or false as return value, since I have another example where true is returned instead of false as Ayende wrote. Soft Deletes With NHibernate Which seems to return true instead of false. public class SoftDeletableListener : IPreDeleteEventListener {
    public void Register(Configuration cfg) {
        cfg.EventListeners.PreDeleteEventListeners = 
            new IPreDeleteEventListener[] { this }
                .Concat(cfg.EventListeners.PreDeleteEventListeners)
                .ToArray();
    }

    public Boolean OnPreDelete(PreDeleteEvent @event) {
        ISoftDeletable softDeletable = @event.Entity as ISoftDeletable;

        if (softDeletable == null) return true;

        EntityEntry entry = @event.Session
            .GetSessionImplementation()
            .PersistenceContext
            .GetEntry(@event.Entity);
        entry.Status = Status.Loaded;

        softDeletable.Deleted = true;

        Object id = @event.Persister
            .GetIdentifier(@event.Entity, @event.Session.EntityMode);
        Object [] fields = @event.Persister
            .GetPropertyValues(@event.Entity, @event.Session.EntityMode);
        Object version = @event.Persister
            .GetVersion(@event.Entity, @event.Session.EntityMode);

        @event.Persister.Update(id
            , fields
            , new Int32[1]
            , false
            , fields
            , version
            , @event.Entity
            , null
            , @event.Session.GetSessionImplementation());

        return true;
    }
}
 So I wonder, what false/true actually tells NHibernate depending on the listener dealt with.
@CODE:IPreDeleteEventListener IPreInsertEventListener IPreUpdateEventListener NHibernate.Event NHibernate IPreUpdateEventListener & IPreInsertEventListener public class AuditEventListener : IPreInsertEventListener {
    public bool OnPreInsert(OnPreInsert @event) {
        var audit = @event.Entity as IHaveAuditInformation;
        if (audit == null) return false;

        var time = DateTime.Now;
        var name = WindowsIdentity.GetCurrent().Name;

        Set(@event.Persister, @event.State, "CreatedAt", time);
        Set(@event.Persister, @event.State, "CreatedBy", name);

        audit.CreatedAt = time;
        audit.CreatedBy = name;

        return false;
    }
} true false true false Soft Deletes With NHibernate true false public class SoftDeletableListener : IPreDeleteEventListener {
    public void Register(Configuration cfg) {
        cfg.EventListeners.PreDeleteEventListeners = 
            new IPreDeleteEventListener[] { this }
                .Concat(cfg.EventListeners.PreDeleteEventListeners)

    }

        ISoftDeletable softDeletable = @event.Entity as ISoftDeletable;

        if (softDeletable == null) return true;

@CONTENT:I just wanted to add an image to my app. As advised, I used the ng-src directive: <img ng-src="{{app.imgBig}}" alt="lorem ipsum" height="100" width="200" title="lorem ipsum" />
 It works fine on most browsers but it doesn't on IE8. The image is not loaded as instead of adding the absolute url to the file name, it returns the relative path and adds "unsafe:" before it. Actually, it's trying to load: unsafe:img/test.jpg Instead of: http://url_of_my_site.com/img/test.jpg So you know, it may be related to the fact I had to completely disable SCE to support IE7: $sceProvider.enabled(false);
 A quick fix was to create a base path constant and to add it at the beginning of the image path but it's not the best as the app shouldn't be dependent from this base path. Any idea ?
@CODE:<img ng-src="{{app.imgBig}}" alt="lorem ipsum" height="100" width="200" title="lorem ipsum" /> $sceProvider.enabled(false); unsafe: $sceProvider.enabled(false) $sanitize var myApp = angular.module('myApp', [], function ($compileProvider) { $compileProvider.imgSrcSanitizationWhitelist(/^\s*((https?|ftp|mailto):)|#/); });

 But when i tried to build the dll I get an undefined reference for mciSendString. What is the proper way to link to winmm from gcc?

@TITLE:runjags object is too big
@CONTENT:I am trying to run JAGS using a new package runjags, because R2jags has a bug (the full model code is in the question http://stats.stackexchange.com/q/62006/5509): require("runjags")
out <- run.jags("Poisson.OD.t.test.txt", params, win.data, nc, inits,
      nb*4/5, ni, nb*1/5)
plot(out2, layout = c(4, 2))
 It works as a charm, but the drawbacks of this package is that the runjags object returned by the run.jags function is already bundled with prepared charts and outputs and is too big. Just for comparison, the sizes of corresponding .Rdata files (2 chains, each of 500 saved iterations, 1000 iterations in total): runjags object - 1.2 MB R2jags object - 212 kB mcmc.list object - 33 kB The runjags object is enormous, but I have to store it to be able to use runjags interface on the model later. Any workaround for this issue?

@TITLE:C# Drag and Drop Image within Canvas
@CONTENT:I tried to Google how to make drag & drop for UIElements on a Canvas, but couldn't find anything that I'm looking for. I got a C# WPF application with a Window. Inside the Window I got a Canvas where I can add Images to. What I want is to be able to Drag & Drop the Images, while staying within the Canvas' borders. I also want this to be in code, so not in the xaml. I got this in the function where I add/update the Images to the Canvas. The TODO's should be replaced for the Drag & Drop events. Image img = ImageList[i].Image;
img.Name = "Image" + i;

// TODO: Drag and Drop event for Image

// TODO: Check if Left and Top are within Canvas (minus width / height of Image) 

Canvas.SetLeft(img, Left); // Default Left when adding the image = 0
Canvas.SetTop(img, Top); // Default Top when adding the image = 0

MyCanvas.Children.Add(img);
OnPropertyChanged("MyCanvas");
 PS: Though this is for later, if someone has code to drag and drop multiple images at once as an additional bonus, I would appreciate it. Thanks in advance for the help.

@CONTENT:I seem to be have a great deal of trouble with a simple issue. Yes I'm new to c# but I try to learn what I can without jumping to post a question. In this case I just think I'm not asking the right question. No code samples will help here because I'm talking about the basics ( implementation ). I have not really coded anything yet, just use the visual builder to create my windows forms and menus. The issue I'm having is when I select a menu item (call it: set paths ) I want that list view on my main form to load from the path selected when I hit ok on form2. So I did a simple find folder dialog and I have my new path stored on form2 in a text box. When I hit ok on that form2 I want my listview form1 to populate. I know how to do all of this but I can not for the life of me access form1 from form2 or vice versa. I tried making a call back function but I get that non-static variable cannot be referenced... error because my form1 is static, so I can't create any non static methods. I looked in to EventArgs but that just seems like an over kill for such a common request. So what is the general way to do this?

@TITLE:How to send Inline images in Email with Python/Django?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to send an email with an inline image using Python/Django. Here is the code showing how I am doing it. It's still in development. So all it is meant to do for now is send a dummy email message with a picture of a bumble bee embedded in it. Yet when I receive the email in my Gmail inbox, I see only the following text-based email. The various Mime parts of the email show up in the payload of the email as text. I clicked the forward button and cut-n-pasted the entire email below so you can see what I get. Can someone suggest what I'm doing wrong here? And a possible solution?

@TITLE:dynamically specifying floating point number size in a function-enclosed sscanf statement
@CONTENT:I have a structured data file consisting of header lines interspersed with blocks of data. I am reading each block of data (as defined by the header line) into a separate cell of a cell array. For instance, suppose that after loading the data with textscan, I have a cell array x and an array of indices of header lines and EOF (headerIdx) of the following form: x={'header line 1';'98.78743';'99.39717';'99.93578';'100.40125';'100.79166';'101.10525';'101.34037';'101.49553';'101.56939';'101.56072';'101.4685';'101.29184';'101.03002';'100.68249';'header line 2';'100.24887';'99.72897';'99.12274';'98.43036';'97.65215';'96.78864';'95.84054';'header line 3';'3.2';'4.31';'2.7';'4.6';'9.3'};
headerIdx=[1;16;24;30];
 I then attempt to extract each block of data below a header line into a separate element of a cell array using sscanf and str2mat (as suggested by this post). Initially, this approach failed because the elements within a given block of data were of different length. This can be solved by including a numerical flag for the '%f' argument to help sscanf know where to delimit the input data (as suggested by this post). One can then use a strategy such as the following to effect the conversion of structured data to a cell array of block-specific double arrays: extract_data = @(n) sscanf(str2mat(x(headerIdx(n)+1:headerIdx(n+1)-1)).',['%' num2str(size(str2mat(x(headerIdx(n)+1:headerIdx(n+1)-1)).',1)) 'f']);
extracted_data = arrayfun(extract_data,1:numel(headerIdx)-1,'UniformOutput',false);
 The numerical flag of the format string can either be set to something arbitrarily large to encompass all the data, or can be set on a block-specific basis as I have done in the example above. The latter approach leads to redundant evaluation of str2mat (once for the input to sscanf and once for the input to the '%f' string generator. Can this redundancy be avoided without using loop statements that store the output of the str2mat command in a temporary variable? Note that one cannot simply take the output of the size command applied to the output of str2mat(x).' on the entire data set because the header lines are generally going to be the lines with the greatest number of characters. Finally, I have constructed the x matrix above to reflect the fact that some blocks of data may have different precision than other blocks. This is the reason to set the format string in a block-specific manner. My testing has shown that despite accurate construction of a block-specific format string (['%' num2str(size(str2mat(x(headerIdx(n)+1:headerIdx(n+1)-1)).',1)) 'f']), the data in all elements of the resulting cell array (extracted_data) are ultimately forced to have the same precision (see below). Why is this the case, and how can it be corrected? extracted_data{:}

@LINK:/questions/21838758/what-false-true-really-mean-for-ipreinserteventlisteners
@TITLE:What false/true really mean for IPreInsertEventListeners?
@CONTENT:I recently have found out how to audit instances with the IPreDeleteEventListener, IPreInsertEventListener and IPreUpdateEventListener in the NHibernate.Event namespace. However, it still confuses me what shall these event return either on successful or unsuccessful finality. For example, let's take a look at Ayende's blog article found here: NHibernate IPreUpdateEventListener & IPreInsertEventListener Following his example, one could implement the interfaces as following: public class AuditEventListener : IPreInsertEventListener {
    public bool OnPreInsert(OnPreInsert @event) {
        var audit = @event.Entity as IHaveAuditInformation;
        if (audit == null) return false;

        var time = DateTime.Now;
        var name = WindowsIdentity.GetCurrent().Name;

        Set(@event.Persister, @event.State, "CreatedAt", time);
        Set(@event.Persister, @event.State, "CreatedBy", name);

        audit.CreatedAt = time;
        audit.CreatedBy = name;

        return false;
    }
}
 What odes it actually mean to return either true or false as return value, since I have another example where true is returned instead of false as Ayende wrote. Soft Deletes With NHibernate Which seems to return true instead of false. public class SoftDeletableListener : IPreDeleteEventListener {
    public void Register(Configuration cfg) {
        cfg.EventListeners.PreDeleteEventListeners = 
            new IPreDeleteEventListener[] { this }
                .Concat(cfg.EventListeners.PreDeleteEventListeners)
                .ToArray();
    }

    public Boolean OnPreDelete(PreDeleteEvent @event) {
        ISoftDeletable softDeletable = @event.Entity as ISoftDeletable;

        if (softDeletable == null) return true;

        EntityEntry entry = @event.Session
            .GetSessionImplementation()
            .PersistenceContext
            .GetEntry(@event.Entity);
        entry.Status = Status.Loaded;

        softDeletable.Deleted = true;

        Object id = @event.Persister
            .GetIdentifier(@event.Entity, @event.Session.EntityMode);
        Object [] fields = @event.Persister
            .GetPropertyValues(@event.Entity, @event.Session.EntityMode);
        Object version = @event.Persister
            .GetVersion(@event.Entity, @event.Session.EntityMode);

        @event.Persister.Update(id
            , fields
            , new Int32[1]
            , false
            , fields
            , version
            , @event.Entity
            , null
            , @event.Session.GetSessionImplementation());

        return true;
    }
}
 So I wonder, what false/true actually tells NHibernate depending on the listener dealt with.
@CODE:IPreDeleteEventListener IPreInsertEventListener IPreUpdateEventListener NHibernate.Event NHibernate IPreUpdateEventListener & IPreInsertEventListener public class AuditEventListener : IPreInsertEventListener {
    public bool OnPreInsert(OnPreInsert @event) {
        var audit = @event.Entity as IHaveAuditInformation;
        if (audit == null) return false;

        var time = DateTime.Now;
        var name = WindowsIdentity.GetCurrent().Name;

        Set(@event.Persister, @event.State, "CreatedAt", time);
        Set(@event.Persister, @event.State, "CreatedBy", name);

        audit.CreatedAt = time;
        audit.CreatedBy = name;

        return false;
    }
} true false true false Soft Deletes With NHibernate true false public class SoftDeletableListener : IPreDeleteEventListener {
    public void Register(Configuration cfg) {
        cfg.EventListeners.PreDeleteEventListeners = 
            new IPreDeleteEventListener[] { this }
                .Concat(cfg.EventListeners.PreDeleteEventListeners)

    }

    public Boolean OnPreDelete(PreDeleteEvent @event) {
        ISoftDeletable softDeletable = @event.Entity as ISoftDeletable;

        if (softDeletable == null) return true;

        EntityEntry entry = @event.Session

@CONTENT:I just wanted to add an image to my app. As advised, I used the ng-src directive: <img ng-src="{{app.imgBig}}" alt="lorem ipsum" height="100" width="200" title="lorem ipsum" />
 It works fine on most browsers but it doesn't on IE8. The image is not loaded as instead of adding the absolute url to the file name, it returns the relative path and adds "unsafe:" before it. Actually, it's trying to load: unsafe:img/test.jpg Instead of: http://url_of_my_site.com/img/test.jpg So you know, it may be related to the fact I had to completely disable SCE to support IE7: $sceProvider.enabled(false);
 A quick fix was to create a base path constant and to add it at the beginning of the image path but it's not the best as the app shouldn't be dependent from this base path. Any idea ?
@CODE:<img ng-src="{{app.imgBig}}" alt="lorem ipsum" height="100" width="200" title="lorem ipsum" /> $sceProvider.enabled(false); unsafe: $sceProvider.enabled(false) $sanitize var myApp = angular.module('myApp', [], function ($compileProvider) { $compileProvider.imgSrcSanitizationWhitelist(/^\s*((https?|ftp|mailto):)|#/); });

Inside the Window I got a Canvas where I can add Images to. What I want is to be able to Drag & Drop the Images, while staying within the Canvas' borders. I also want this to be in code, so not in the xaml. I got this in the function where I add/update the Images to the Canvas. The TODO's should be replaced for the Drag & Drop events. Image img = ImageList[i].Image;
img.Name = "Image" + i;

// TODO: Drag and Drop event for Image

// TODO: Check if Left and Top are within Canvas (minus width / height of Image) 

Canvas.SetLeft(img, Left); // Default Left when adding the image = 0
Canvas.SetTop(img, Top); // Default Top when adding the image = 0

MyCanvas.Children.Add(img);
OnPropertyChanged("MyCanvas");
 PS: Though this is for later, if someone has code to drag and drop multiple images at once as an additional bonus, I would appreciate it. Thanks in advance for the help.
@CODE:Image img = ImageList[i].Image;
img.Name = "Image" + i;

// TODO: Drag and Drop event for Image

// TODO: Check if Left and Top are within Canvas (minus width / height of Image) 

Canvas.SetLeft(img, Left); // Default Left when adding the image = 0
Canvas.SetTop(img, Top); // Default Top when adding the image = 0

MyCanvas.Children.Add(img);
OnPropertyChanged("MyCanvas");

@CONTENT:I have an e-mail application, which shows the content in an UIWebView inside an UISplitViewController. Everything works fine until i rotate the device, when already zoomed in/out in the UIWebView. When rotating the device, i adjust the frame of the UIWebView in - (void)willAnimateRotationToInterfaceOrientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation)toInterfaceOrientation duration:(NSTimeInterval)duration The problem is, when i zoomed in/out in the UIWebViewand then rotate the device.

And If i could just see a template of code that says "\write code for action here", that would be super helpful!!! ( it's for iPad IOS7 ) This is as far as I can get...

@TITLE:Regarding post increment
@CONTENT:int get()
   {
      static i = 1;
      return i++;
   }

  int main(int argc, char *argv[])
  {
      printf("%d %d %d\n", get(), get(), get());
      return 0;
  } 
 Output: 3 2 1 (Order depends upon compiler) Question: But why is the value before increment returned of the static variable (file scope). What is the thumb rule of post/pre increment? I never get it correct. Please help. Okay, let me be more specific, all the examples that I read are like, a = i++; or a = ++i; these are the expressions to increment then assign or assign then increment. But what kind of expressions are these, return i++; func(a++); I read it like this "after i++ nothing to assign, so return the final incremented value" (correct me here)
@CODE:int get()
   {
      static i = 1;
      return i++;
   }

  int main(int argc, char *argv[])
  {
      printf("%d %d %d\n", get(), get(), get());
      return 0;
  } a = i++; or a = ++i; return i++; func(a++);

@LINK:/questions/21801819/servicestack-validation-and-database-access
@TITLE:ServiceStack - Validation and Database Access
@CONTENT:I'm implementing an Api with ServiceStack. One of the key aspects of my solution is an aggressive validation strategy. I use ServiceStack's ValidationFeature, meaning that if there is an IValidator< ReqDto > (or its descendant: AbstractValidator< ReqDto >) registered in the app container, validation will automatically run prior to the service. By aggressive validation, what I mean is that I check all possible error scenarios, and logic validations at the validator level. As a result my service logic is extremely clean and short. This independance of Service Logic from Service Validation is something really nice from the practical point of view, because it provides for very easy to read and reason about Service logic/implementation. However, I'm starting to think that FluentValidation's Rules and RuleSets are better suited for simple format validations, and not direct at Database accesses like I am doing (mainly to test for 404 errors originated from ids pulled from the request). Questions: 1: Is it incorrect conceptually for the validation logic to access the database? 2: From what I saw so far, including SS source, I didn't find a form to define a FluentValidation rule for cases such as: pull an Id from the request, access the database retrieve an entity, and throw a 404 if an entry was not found. I only use FV's rules to define basic format validations such as: RuleFor(x => x.UserName).NotEmpty();
RuleFor(x => x.Password).NotEmpty();
 The rest I do manually. Anyone with a solution to this problem? NOTE: This is not a question about how to transform a ValidationResult / ValidationError into an HttpResult/HttpError. I that have covered, by using ValidationFeature's ErrorResponseFilter that was introduced in SS 3.9.44. Thanks

@CONTENT:I tried searching for a solution, but I couldn't find anything of the sort. My quest is: is it possible to have a non-rectangular TextView? I need to put a TextView and an ImageView inside a fragment. Would look something like this: I was thinking of maybe having two TextViews (lets call them tv1 and tv2) and an ImageView (Img1). I could align the tv1 to the bottom of img1 and align the top of tv2 with img1. SOMEHOW play with the text in the TextViews to split it in both TextViews?

@CONTENT:I am trying to validate user input from the command line with argc and argv but am running into a segmentation fault and am not sure why. I want to validate the user has entered a positive int (so argc =2 and argv is positive). Here is my code: int main (int argc, string argv[])
{
    int k = atoi(argv[1]);
    if (argc != 2 && k <1)
    {
          return 1;
    }
}
 The k < 1 part of my code seems to be working fine, but I get segmentation errors every time I try to run without the program name and an argument (agrc !=2). EDIT: More clear description of the error handling problem: If I run ./myprogram -2 then I get my return 1 as expected. If I run ./myprogram hjdksfhdsk then I get my return 1 as expected. If I run ./myprogram then I get a segmentation fault. It is this behaviour that makes me think my handling of the argc value is at fault, but I am not sure why I cannot just test argc !=2.
@CODE:int main (int argc, string argv[])
{
    int k = atoi(argv[1]);
    if (argc != 2 && k <1)

@TITLE:applying a function with arguments to a cell using cellfun
@CONTENT:Suppose one has a cell array of characters that one wishes to convert to a vector of numbers. This could be accomplished using str2num or str2double. For instance, x={'0.17106'; '2.11462'; '4.13938'; '6.24203'}
cellfun(@str2num,x)
str2double(x)
 These functions are somewhat slow compared to sscanf. However, sscanf requires additional arguments, the specification of which seems not to be possible using the ordinary cellfun syntax, e.g., cellfun(sscanf(>variable usually goes here<,'%f'),x)
 How does one apply sscanf to each element of a cell array, or more generally, how does one apply any function requiring an ordered series arguments using cellfun?
@CODE:str2num str2double x={'0.17106'; '2.11462'; '4.13938'; '6.24203'}

@CONTENT:There is a simple POJO - Category with Set<Category> as subcategories inside. Nesting might be quite deep as each of subcategories may contain sub-subcategories and so on. I would like to return Category as REST resource via jersey, serialized to json (by jackson). The problem is, I can't really limit depth of serialization thus all the category tree gets serialized. Is there any way to stop jackson serializing object just right after first level is completed (ie. Category with its first-level subcategories)?

@TITLE:JavaFX: Binding TextArea to element of selected TreeItem (contained in TreeView)
@CONTENT:I'm building the following JavAFX and I'm pretty new to it altogether. Here's what it looks like: http://i.imgur.com/nfzQzIY.png As you can see there's a TreeView on the left as well as some TextAreas in the centre. Please ignore the rest. The alphanumeric Strings on the left TreeView are PlugTreeItem class objects, which I've built to extend TreeItem and have an additional holder for a Plug item, like so: public class PlugTreeItem<T> extends TreeItem{

    private Plug plugItem = null;

    //########################### PROCS ########################################

    public PlugTreeItem(Object t, Plug pl) {
        super(t);
        plugItem = pl;
    }

    public PlugTreeItem(Object t, Node node, Plug pl) {
        super(t, node);
        plugItem = pl;
    }

    public void setPlugItem(Plug plugItem) {
        this.plugItem = plugItem;
    }

    public Plug getPlugItem() {
        return plugItem;
    }
}
 And the TreeView is built by reading Plugs off an SQL DB, creating PlugTreeItem objects, linking the plug to the PlugTreeItem then adding that to the tree's root node (which was created initially, as a dummy), out of which we make the TreeView: NOTE: result_set contains the SQL result matrix. MAC is the field that contains the addresses you see in left of the screenshot. treeItemRoot = new PlugTreeItem<>("Active Plugs", new Plug());          //Root of the tree, contains a dummy Plug object.
selectedTreeItem = treeItemRoot;  //Holder of our currently selected TreeItem, see Listener below.

TreeView<String> treeView = new TreeView<>(treeItemRoot);

while(result_set.next()){
    Plug pl = null;                                         
    pl = new Plug(result_set.getString("SIHUid"), result_set.getString("sensorID"), result_set.getString("Location"), result_set.getString("Appliance"), result_set.getString("Type"), result_set.getString("connection"));
    PlugTreeItem<String> pti = new PlugTreeItem(pl.getMAC(),pl);
    treeItemRoot.getChildren().add(pti);
}
 Finally, I've got some TextAreas as you see in the screenshot of the app. I want those to reflect the elements of the selected PlugTreeItem in the TreeView, let's just start with the Plug MAC TextArea that I want to reflect the same value that you see on the left. I've added the following listener to selectedTreeItem so that every time the user clicks on a TreeItem, the selectedTreeItem gets updated and holds a reference to that specific PlugTreeItem: treeView.getSelectionModel().selectedItemProperty().addListener( new ChangeListener() {     
            @Override
            public void changed(ObservableValue observable, Object oldValue, Object newValue) { 
                selectedTreeItem = (PlugTreeItem<String>) newValue;
                System.out.println("Selection plug MAC: " + selectedTreeItem.getPlugItem().getMAC());           //MARKER: REMOVE
                // do what ever you want 
            }
        });
 Hopefully this does what I think it is. The System.out command confirms that whenever I click on different items on the tree, the MAC address that I clicked on gets printed. How can I tell my TextAreas to "hey, listen to selectedTreeItem. Whenever it changes, get a specific value and set it as your text"? I've tried adding a second Listener on a specific field of Plug that I've changed from String to StringProperty so that it becomes an ObservableValue. However, even after binding the TextArea's textProperty with the StringProperty, it doesn't change its contents. I know I may have worded my question incorrectly due to its size. Please do not hesitate to ask me for any additional info or code I may have omitted or you deem imoprtant.

@TITLE:WCF wsdualhttpbinding client without elevation
@CONTENT:I've created a Windows Service (server) and a WPF (client) that uses WCFs wsdualhttpbinding callback functionality. Everything between the two pieces of software works correctly but the problem I'm having is that the client needs to run elevated to administrator privileges to work (which is understandable because it has to open ports in order to communicate with the server) Is there any way to configure the client to work without elevation? Or perhaps create a one-time permanent connection so that the client doesn't need to be elevated at all times? I'm running out of ideas and google search terms.. UPDATE I've found a solution. Please correct me if there is another best practice I could follow! I've added an 'Enable' and 'Disable' buttons to the client application that runs netsh to open (or close) and reserve a port. Enable Process process = new Process();
process.StartInfo = new ProcessStartInfo("netsh", @"http add urlacl url=http://+:" + PortNumber + @"/ user=DOMAIN\username");
process.StartInfo.Verb = "runas";

@TITLE:Windows Phone xaudio2
@CONTENT:Hej I am using a library for playing audio in Windows Phone found here. Which works fine. I am then trying to add a new .wav file to this system. And I get a memory error. Searching around on the internet gives me that I have to encode the audio using AdpcmEncode command-line tool. However using this tool cannot convert my .wav files. Can anyone help here, regarding encoding to get the audio working? Furthermore just for my information how big can my audio files be? I think I read some place 20 mb, but unsure.

 All my colleagues get the same error. Can you tell me what version should I use? UPDATE: ResteasyJackson2Provider class from jar resteasy-jackson2-provider extends JacksonJaxbJsonProvider from jar jackson-jaxrs-json-provider and calls method   protected JsonEndpointConfig _configForWriting(ObjectMapper mapper, Annotation[] annotations)
 in jackson-jaxrs-json-provider-2.2.1 it is OK, but in jackson-jaxrs-json-provider-2.3.0 this method has different arguments:   protected JsonEndpointConfig _configForWriting(ObjectWriter writer, Annotation[] annotations)
 I think this is an official bug.

 I When i press createExcelButon in MainProgramWindow GUI, sql1.createExcel() method succesfully eecuted and begin working also my progressbar appear. But only jframe of progresbar coming not filled with bpar and waiting until sql1.createExcel() fully complete. When sql1.createExcel() fully complete and create excel file under defined location, progressbar jframe filled with pbar but bar not progressed. But i feed pbar with progressbar.updateBar(newvalueforpbar); after each while statement end. P.S: If i remove pbar calling from my button, my program working succesfully and create excel file with wanted format. My problem is progressbar feeding. Thanks in advance.

@TITLE:How to trigger an update of NgComponent when child property changes
@CONTENT:I am a complete beginner to AngularDart (and Dart); I followed the tutorials but this is something I can't seem to find a answer to. I have two NgComponents that work perfectly:  <colorImage car-color="ctrl.car.color"></colorImage>
 <carImage car="ctrl.car"></carImage>
 My controller "ctrl" has a property named "car" and "car" has a property named "color". When "car.color" changes, the colorButton NgComponent updates, but the carImage NgComponent does not. How can I trigger an update of carImage when "car.color" changes? Thanks!!

 My understanding is that in Ruby all function arguments are passed by reference, so arr += [value] should still be operating on the passed array and append the value. This is not the case, which tells me I don't understand the difference between += and << in this context. Please enlighten me! Thanks so much.

@TITLE:Broadcasting and receiving extra doubles
@CONTENT:I'm attempting to broadcast extras in an am broadcast in adb shell. In my BroadcastReceiver in android, I'm subscribed to the broadcast and pull the extras out of the Bundle. My trouble lies with doubles. I assumed that a broadcast could include a double since the Bundle class has a getDouble method, e.g.: double percentComplete = bundle.getDouble("percent_complete");
 However, the am broadcast command in adb shell doesn't seem to support doubles, only floats. When I send the float, the Bundle.getDouble() method throws an internal exception, logged at the warning level, indicating that it fails to cast Float to Double. Can I send doubles, or am I forced to use floats? Here are the flags for specifiying extras that I am aware of, as reported by am. <INTENT> specifications include these flags and arguments:

@LINK:/questions/21721569/how-to-synchronize-my-perl-script-with-mysql-query
@TITLE:How to synchronize my Perl script with MySQL query
@CONTENT:I am new in coding in every sense of the word so kindly bear with me. I have created a Perl script that communicates with my PHP application but am stuck on the final hurdle of synchronizing them with MySQL queries. I want the Perl script to read table Syncorderrelation in my database, and to auto respond only once, sending a text message by posting the 'Auto Response' on my 'Outgoing Table') to any new entries that meets the following criteria: The entry to have an updatetype of 1, which means the new entry is a new individual who has subscribed to a product. The Perl script to read the new entry of DEST_MSISDN which is a field on the same Syncorderrelation table (just a phone number) and to reply to the number with an automated response (just a welcome message). This is done by only posting the 'Auto Response' on the 'Outgoing Table', where my PHP application takes over and sends the response on its own. So my question is this: how do I go about creating a query whereby the Perl script will auto reply only to new entries in the Syncorderrelation table from The current time onwards. As currently, there are hundreds of other entries of which I don't want to trigger a response to. But only send a reply to the New DEST_MSISDN (phone number) and only reply to this phone number and only do so once, and thus not keep resending the same welcome message, to the same number again and again. Note: The only way that the script can know it is a new entry, will be through the ID Field. This is a unique field that is auto-generated every time a new entry enters into the Syncorderrelation table (which will now have increased from its current number of '440' to '441'). The script I have created posts correctly all the requisite fields from Syncoderrelation table to Outgoing table, but am unable to read the new Dest_Msisdn (phone number) from Syncorderrelation table and post the phone number to the Outgoing table. Without it the PHP application will not know where to send the welcome message to. use strict;

My personal preference is to avoid ViewBags and build Robust Models containing all the data the view requires: Approach 1: MODEL A: 
- List of Employees
- Nullable integer, indicating which item from the list is currently selected
- string firstName (empty if index is null)
- string lastname (empty if index is null)
 Approach 2: MODEL A: 
- List of Employees

ViewBag:
- ViewBag.Index (indicating which item from the list is currently selected)
- ViewBag.FirstName
- ViewBag.LastName
 Can anyone think of an argument why Approach2 would be better than approach 1? thanks for your input

>>> 
 Note: I quoted all the items correctly. The "Orange"closing quotes don't show correctly here on Stack Overflow but they display fine in the terminal window. UPDATE: I have added a bounty to this question. I am looking for a solution that can be implemented without too much additional code and without using external libraries. It should also work with python 2.7+ and 3.x (conditionals that test for versions and apply different fixes would be fine). Also it should not require any additional system configuration or changing of fonts or changing any terminal settings of a standard Debian/Ubuntu installation.
@CODE:>>> items = "Apple tree", "Banana plant", "Orange ??", "Goodbye"
>>> values = 100, 200, 300, 400
>>> for i, v in zip(items, values):
...     print "%-15s : %-4s" % (i, v)
... 
Apple tree      : 100 
Banana plant    : 200 
Orange ??   : 300 
Goodbye         : 400 
>>> "Orange" len(i) i.ljust(15) '{:<15}'.format(i) print i.ljust(15), v map(len, items) [10, 12, 13, 7] '{:<15}'.format(i) str.decode("utf8")

@TITLE:Create Writes and Format of Case Class
@CONTENT:For this case class: case class People(names: Set[Int]) Travis Brown explained how to create PeopleReads: Reads[People] at this answer: implicit val PeopleReads = 
       (__ \ "names").read[Set[Id]].map(People)
 But, I'm trying to implement PeopleWrites: Writes[People]:  implicit val PeopleWrites: Writes[People] = 
    (JsPath \  "names").write[Set[Int]].map(unlift(x => Some((x.names)))
 with the following compile-time error: scala> People( Set(1,2,3))
res5: People = People(Set(1, 2, 3))

scala>  implicit val PeopleWrites: Writes[People] = 
      (JsPath \  "names").write[Set[Int]].map(unlift(x => Some((x.names))))
<console>:21: error: value map is not a member of 
                play.api.libs.json.OWrites[Set[Int]]

                                      map(unlift(x => Some((x.names)))
 How can I resolve this error? Also, how can I write Format[People] where I get/define both Reads and Writes: val peopleFormat: Format[People] = ...?

@TITLE:Consuming the Valence API as an application
@CONTENT:According to the Valence Docs, Valence Learning Framework API calls are all made in isolation, by a known application, and by a known LMS user. If I want to build an application that has admin access, I'm guessing that I would have to make a "service account" that has admin access, and have my application use the API as that user. How would I go about obtaining a userId and userKey for users that aren't real people, and only exist for the application to connect to the valence API?

@TITLE:Worklight 6.1 Android Applicaiton renders all views with no widgets
@CONTENT:I've developed a hybrid application using Worklight 6.1 + Dojo 1.8. The application tests out fine using Chrome "Common & Android". When I deploy the device to my Nexus-7 Tablet running 4.3 all of my views appear together, and the dojo widget are simply text content. I reviewd a previous post titled : "Worklight mobile app doesn't load dojo mobile widgets on android 4.x devices" I'm experiencing the same situation, and I also, have followed the steps mentioned in several posting found across the Web. ?Make sure to have all dojo required files under www folder...
?Uncheck "Provide Library Resources" option from Dojo Library Request console before the 
 project building...
?Reeplace core-web-layer_ROOT.js and mobile-ui-layer_ROOT.js from www/dojo/nls/ with the ones 
  in toolkit/dojo/dojo/nls
 My device is set to the language English(US) I've seen the suggestion to move "dojo/nls/core-web-layer_en-us.js" to my dojo project, but the DojoLib project created by Worklight does not have a "en" bundle. My impression is that "en-us" local should be a default and no other files would need to be copied. If this file "dojo/nls/core-web-layer_en-us.js" is required to be part of my project I'm not sure where to retrieve it from. I will attach the logcat content here showing the application deployment to the device as well as the application startup. I apprecaite any help you can provide to resolve this issue:: 02-11 14:25:41.892: I/CordovaLog(7468): Changing log level to DEBUG(3)

@TITLE:Leaflet panTo (or setview) function?
@CONTENT:I want to create a panTo -function. When I click a link the map pans to the coordinates. But im not sure how to pass the value to the function. I'm starting with giving the link the Pointfield (pt) value like this: <a href="#" class="marker" value="{{ mymodel.pt }}">Link</a>
 Then I've been trying this: $("#dialog").on("click", ".marker", function(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    map.panTo($(this).attr("value"));
    });
 That didn't work. I think it's a scope-issue where the function cant read the 'map' variable because it's not under the initial map script. So my next idea is to create a "panTo"- function and place it under the inital map script (which would be the right scope) and call that function from the click event instead. Not sure it would work but Im wondering how to pass it the "value" from the link? Thanks for your answers!
@CODE:<a href="#" class="marker" value="{{ mymodel.pt }}">Link</a> $("#dialog").on("click", ".marker", function(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    map.panTo($(this).attr("value"));

@TITLE:Placing a scrollable div below a fixed div of variable height
@CONTENT:This is with respect to a mobile page in jquery mobile I have 2 divs as follows within a parent div(data-role=header) <div data-role="header">
<div class="inner-topHeader-panel"></div>
<div class="inner-centercontent"></div>
</div>
 I want "inner-topHeader-panel" to be a fixed in position(note: it is of variable height) and "inner-centercontent" to be placed below "inner-topHeader-panel" and be scrollable. When scrolled, parts of it that is scrolled up should be hidden behind the "inner-topHeader-panel" div. Current CSS is as follows. .inner-topHeader-panel{ 
    width:100%; 
    height:auto; 
    margin:0; 
    background:#fff; 
    border-bottom:none;
    float:left;
    position:fixed !important; 
    top:0;
}

.inner-centercontent{
  width:100%;
float:left;
 padding-bottom: 50px;
 }
 solution: Thanks @LessQuesar,@ezanker and @mainguy, I set second div's css as follows and it worked! .inner-centercontent{ 
width:100%; 
height:100px;
overflow: hidden;
overflow-y: auto;
float:left;  
position:fixed !important;  
padding-bottom: 50px;
}
 and i set the .inner-centercontent's top position using jQuery according to the height of .inner-topHeader-panel
@CODE:<div data-role="header">
<div class="inner-topHeader-panel"></div>
<div class="inner-centercontent"></div>
</div> .inner-topHeader-panel{ 
    width:100%;

    margin:0; 
    background:#fff; 
    border-bottom:none;
    float:left;
    position:fixed !important;

}

.inner-centercontent{
  width:100%;

@CONTENT:I'm working on an iOS application which is developed for all devices (retina and non-retina) The size of the app is too big now to have compromise for all devices. (Why should iphone 3gs suffer size where it does not get quality?) Now, I would like to know if there is a way to optimize the size of game installed on the device. Specifically, is there a way in itunes submission process where we can have additional downloadable content on the server and can download it based on the device ? We can have assets broken based on the devices and still can save some size on each device.

What I want to achieve is that documents that are created by you are only visible to yourself on viewA. I tried the following formula in viewA 'View Selection': SELECT (form = "formA" & @UserName =_author). Even though I know that these two variables have the same values when I read it from the document's properties, the condition is not satisfied and I do not see a single document. If I delete everything after "&", the view shows all documents. All is hosted on a server which handles users.

@TITLE:Regex for DocumentFilter to match all decimal number but also number with just a decimal at the end
@CONTENT:Qestion First: I need to regex to match 111 or 111. or 111.111 (just aritrarty numbers) for a DocumentFilter. I need the user to be able to input 111. with a decimal and nothing afterwards. Can't seem to get it right. All the Regexes I find all match just all decimal numbers i.e. 12343.5565
32.434
32
 Like this regex ^[0-9]*(\\.)?[0-9]+$
 Problem is, I need the regex for a DocumentFilter so the input can only be numbers with/without a decimal point. But the catch is it also needs to match 1223.
 So the user can input the decimal into the text field. So basically I need to regex to match 11111         // all integer
11111.        // all integers with one decimal point and nothing after
11111.1111    // all decimal numbers
 The pattern I have so far is the one above. Here is a test program (For Java users) The patter can be input in the this line  Pattern regEx = Pattern.compile("^[0-9]*(\\.)?[0-9]+$");
 If the regex fits the bill, then you will be able to input 111 or 111. or 111.111. Run it :) import java.awt.GridBagLayout;

 EDIT: My original assumption that the str passed to the methods were the entire document String, so I was confused about why the answers didn't work. I realized it was only the attempted inserted portion of the String that is passed. That said, the answers work perfect, if you get the entire document String from the FilterBypass and check the regex against the entire document String. Something like @Override
public void insertString(DocumentFilter.FilterBypass fb, int off, String str, AttributeSet attr)
        throws BadLocationException {

    String text = fb.getDocument().getText(0, fb.getDocument().getLength() - 1);
    Matcher matcher = regEx.matcher(text);
    if (!matcher.matches()) {
        return;
    }
    super.insertString(fb, off, str, attr);

@LINK:/questions/21691579/uninitialised-jsonserializer-in-breeze-savebundletosavemap-sample
@TITLE:Uninitialised JsonSerializer in Breeze SaveBundleToSaveMap sample
@CONTENT:I'm attempting to use the SaveBundleToSaveMap snippet linked below to implement custom save handling on the server side of a breeze web api implementation. SaveBundleToSaveMap This sample does not work as is? (see below); their is a null reference exception which could use some attention. The SaveWorkState(provider, entitiesArray) constructor calls the ContextProvider.CreateEntityInfoFromJson(...) method which then calls (the class scoped) JsonSerializer.Deserialize(new JTokenReader(jo), entityType) method. The issue is that JsonSerializer is uninitialised and we get a null reference exeption. For e.g. I added this test hack to get the code running: protected internal EntityInfo CreateEntityInfoFromJson(dynamic jo, Type entityType) {
      //temp fix to init JsonSerializer if SaveChanges has NOT been called
      if(JsonSerializer==null) JsonSerializer = CreateJsonSerializer();

      var entityInfo = CreateEntityInfo();

      entityInfo.Entity = JsonSerializer.Deserialize(new JTokenReader(jo), entityType);
      entityInfo.EntityState = (EntityState)Enum.Parse(typeof(EntityState), (String)jo.entityAspect.entityState);
      entityInfo.ContextProvider = this;
 This issue does not occur in the standard release bits as CreateEntityInfoFromJson is always? called downstream from a SaveChanges() call which means the JsonSerializer gets initialised. However, things would be better structured if an initialised JsonSerializer was passed to CreateEntityInfoFromJson as a parameter to avoid potential future null reference issues? Alternately, is there a way to get the SaveBundleToSaveMap snippet to init the JsonSerializer? Its got a private setter :( UPDATE Implemented a very hacky stopgap solution. If anyone at IdeaBlade is watching, would be great to have a public API to convert to and from json saveBundle <-> saveMap. /// <summary>

@CONTENT:Is it possible to click an element through selenium by a partial value of an onclick element? There are multiple input items on a page, and I only need to select one with a specific string. Examples would be: <input name="booksubmit" type="button" class="searchAvailBtnSelect" value="Select" onclick="setTimeout('disableSelect()',1);bookNowSubmit('0165','1BD','000000452014022703S000016500010708F ','101400','156000','3','02/27/2014','false','false','false','false','true','false','false','EXPRESS','63','1 Bedroom Deluxe','false','AC')">

 If you notice towards the end, there is a "1 Bedroom Deluxe", "2 Bedroom Deluxe", and "1 Bedroom Presidential". Since it is an input item, there isn't any text that I would be able to filter by, but I need to only select a specific item, such as the 2 Bedroom Deluxe. Is there anything I could do in the sense of: buttons = driver.find_elements_by_name('booksubmit')
for button in buttons:
    if button ........
 something or another? I'm currently using beautifulsoup4 to also parse the html on the page and retrieve text that is associated with the item, so i don't know if that could be incorporated at all. Visually, the page is an HTML table that is in the format of: +--------------------------------------------------------------------+
|    1 Bedroom Deluxe    |   $25   |   [button i don't care about]   |
|------------------------+---------+---------------------------------|

|------------------------+---------+---------------------------------|
| 1 Bedroom Presidential |   $50   |   [button i don't care about]   |

What signal should I connect handlers to? If I use QAbstractItemView.clicked, I can receive the index of column, but can't determine the mouse button, cause it doesn't receive the event. One the other hand, if I use QAbstractScrollArea.mousePressEvent, I can get event.button(), but it's not clear, how to recover the cell's index. Qt kinda remind of Schr?dinger's indeterminacy here :)

@TITLE:How to get ng-class with $dirty working in a directive?
@CONTENT:I have the following html which works and changes the class of the div when the input is changed using the $dirty: <div class="text-input" ng-class="{typing : (loginForm.test.$dirty || loginForm.test.length > 0)}">

  <input type="text" name="test" ng-model="user.name" placeholder="test">

@TITLE:Issue with JAXB: nameXmlTransform typeName prefix not working
@CONTENT:I wish to convert several schemas into Java Code. The schemas are all similar; for example, each one has a TXLife root object. It would be easier to manage the code if each schema generated code with unique class-names. I can use the "package" binding to put the code from each schema into its own package, but when I try to use the "prefix" binding to change the class names, it ignores it. Here is my schema_bindings.xml file: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<jaxb:bindings xmlns:jaxb="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/jaxb" xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" jaxb:version="2.0">
   <jaxb:bindings schemaLocation="schemas/HI_Request.xsd" node="/xsd:schema">

            <jaxb:typeName prefix="Hi_"/>
         </jaxb:nameXmlTransform>
      </jaxb:schemaBindings>
   </jaxb:bindings>
</jaxb:bindings> When I run the xjc command I get (I had to modify the classpath inside the xjc.bat file in order to get it to work): C:\test>\progs\Java\jaxb-ri-2.2.7\bin\xjc.bat -extension -d src -b schema_bindings.xml schemas

com\mycompany\hi\TransSubType.java
com\mycompany\hi\TransType.java What I was hoping for is that each java file (and the class inside) would be named "Hi_<name>". Jaxb seems to be completely ignoring my "prefix" specification. I have tried several variations on the bindings file. I have also tried the same bindings using the Ant xjc task, all with the same results. I can work with these results, but it would mean that code that processes input from one schema and produces output to another schema would have to use fully-qualified class names to refer to the objects, which is awkward.

@TITLE:How to dynamically display tabs for routes in Durandal?
@CONTENT:This is a two part question. Am very new to durandal and knockout. Using the HTML Starter Kit example for Durandal 2.0.1. I add a route for customers/:id with my own vm and view with nav = false  { route: 'customer/:id', moduleId: 'viewmodels/customer/customer', nav: false }
 Because nav is false, it doesn't get used when buildNavigationModel() is called. So the shell.html doesn't show a tab entry for it. So far so good. When I navigate to c:\temp\index.html#customer/123 I can see the page, but it doesn't get included in the tabs at the top of the page. When I look at shell.html it uses data-bind to get the routes to display in those tabs. So shouldn't it display this new route I just moved to? If I set the routes, nav to true, would that be enough to refresh the shell display? Or am I failing at my first attempt to understand ko? So I have a route for customer/:id. If I go to index#customer/123 I want to see a new tab as of part 1 above. If I navigate to index#customer/234, I want to see a new tab for that as well. The user should then be able to move between the two tabs. Can this work, or is it really only recording the customer/:id route and I will only ever see one tab button?

@TITLE:Cloud Service deployment rolled back
@CONTENT:we had a strange issue a couple of times now with our Azure service. We have a cloud service installed that has a web application running on it. The service was created sometime around beginning of december and he first deployment was done that time as well. After that we did multiple deployments to the cloud service, but (it happens a couple of times now) sometime the Azure decides to roll back the deployment to initial one - the one that was made 2 months ago. This happened this midnight once again and we see that the files creation date on the "restored" or "rolled back" instance is 12/5/2013, which seems to be the date when we did an initial deployment. A question: 1) Why does that happen? 2) How can we determine what caused this rollback? 3) How can we prevent the rollback? or 4) How can we make a "snapshot" of the cloud service so when the Rollback happens, it actually rolls back to the latest stable image?

        {


            OrderStatus os; 
            PaymentStatus? ps;

            int recordsToReturn = 999; 
            int orderBy = 1;
            int groupBy = 1;



            int? paymentStatusId = null;
            if (ps.HasValue)
                paymentStatusId = (int)ps.Value;

                CreatedOnUtc = DateTime.Today.AddDays(-1),

            };




            var query1 = from opv in _opvRepository.Table
                         join o in _orderRepository.Table on opv.OrderId equals o.Id

@CONTENT:I have an array of random values, and a target value. #!/bin/bash
objective='50'
declare -a values=(1 2 2 6 8 14.5 15 28.7 .. 42)
 I need to find a way to extract any combination of numbers in the array 'values' that add up to 50 The array has duplicates, and floating point integers. A solution set might look like: 50 = 42 + 8
50 = 42 + 6 + 2
 Initially I started in bash with some nested for loops, however I'm quickly realizing that this will grow exponentially with my array length. I took a couple of java classes in college, but I'm still inexperienced in programming. I'm starting to think this may require recursion. Can anyone with more programming experience point me in the right direction? Besides nested for loops, how else could you approach this problem?
@CODE:#!/bin/bash
objective='50'
declare -a values=(1 2 2 6 8 14.5 15 28.7 .. 42) 50 = 42 + 8
50 = 42 + 6 + 2

@TITLE:Find and click an item from 'onclick' partial value
@CONTENT:Is it possible to click an element through selenium by a partial value of an onclick element? There are multiple input items on a page, and I only need to select one with a specific string. Examples would be: <input name="booksubmit" type="button" class="searchAvailBtnSelect" value="Select" onclick="setTimeout('disableSelect()',1);bookNowSubmit('0165','1BD','000000452014022703S000016500010708F ','101400','156000','3','02/27/2014','false','false','false','false','true','false','false','EXPRESS','63','1 Bedroom Deluxe','false','AC')">

 If you notice towards the end, there is a "1 Bedroom Deluxe", "2 Bedroom Deluxe", and "1 Bedroom Presidential". Since it is an input item, there isn't any text that I would be able to filter by, but I need to only select a specific item, such as the 2 Bedroom Deluxe. Is there anything I could do in the sense of: buttons = driver.find_elements_by_name('booksubmit')
for button in buttons:
    if button ........
 something or another? I'm currently using beautifulsoup4 to also parse the html on the page and retrieve text that is associated with the item, so i don't know if that could be incorporated at all. Visually, the page is an HTML table that is in the format of: +--------------------------------------------------------------------+
|    1 Bedroom Deluxe    |   $25   |   [button i don't care about]   |
|------------------------+---------+---------------------------------|
|    2 Bedroom Deluxe    |   $50   |   [button i'm trying to click]  |
|------------------------+---------+---------------------------------|
| 1 Bedroom Presidential |   $50   |   [button i don't care about]   |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
 EDIT: I guess posted this too soon. Right after, a coworked came up and suggested finding the element by Xpath with: driver.find_element_by_xpath('//input[contains(@onclick,"1 Bedroom Deluxe")]')

@TITLE:Issue with JAXB: nameXmlTransform typeName prefix not working
@CONTENT:I wish to convert several schemas into Java Code. The schemas are all similar; for example, each one has a TXLife root object. It would be easier to manage the code if each schema generated code with unique class-names. I can use the "package" binding to put the code from each schema into its own package, but when I try to use the "prefix" binding to change the class names, it ignores it. Here is my schema_bindings.xml file: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<jaxb:bindings xmlns:jaxb="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/jaxb" xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" jaxb:version="2.0">
   <jaxb:bindings schemaLocation="schemas/HI_Request.xsd" node="/xsd:schema">
      <jaxb:schemaBindings>
         <jaxb:package name="com.mycompany.hi"/>
         <jaxb:nameXmlTransform>
            <jaxb:typeName prefix="Hi_"/>
         </jaxb:nameXmlTransform>
      </jaxb:schemaBindings>
   </jaxb:bindings>
</jaxb:bindings> When I run the xjc command I get (I had to modify the classpath inside the xjc.bat file in order to get it to work): C:\test>\progs\Java\jaxb-ri-2.2.7\bin\xjc.bat -extension -d src -b schema_bindings.xml schemas

com\mycompany\hi\TransMode.java
com\mycompany\hi\TransSubType.java
com\mycompany\hi\TransType.java What I was hoping for is that each java file (and the class inside) would be named "Hi_<name>". Jaxb seems to be completely ignoring my "prefix" specification. I have tried several variations on the bindings file. I have also tried the same bindings using the Ant xjc task, all with the same results. I can work with these results, but it would mean that code that processes input from one schema and produces output to another schema would have to use fully-qualified class names to refer to the objects, which is awkward.

@TITLE:How to dynamically display tabs for routes in Durandal?
@CONTENT:This is a two part question. Am very new to durandal and knockout. Using the HTML Starter Kit example for Durandal 2.0.1. I add a route for customers/:id with my own vm and view with nav = false  { route: 'customer/:id', moduleId: 'viewmodels/customer/customer', nav: false }
 Because nav is false, it doesn't get used when buildNavigationModel() is called. So the shell.html doesn't show a tab entry for it. So far so good. When I navigate to c:\temp\index.html#customer/123 I can see the page, but it doesn't get included in the tabs at the top of the page. When I look at shell.html it uses data-bind to get the routes to display in those tabs. So shouldn't it display this new route I just moved to? If I set the routes, nav to true, would that be enough to refresh the shell display? Or am I failing at my first attempt to understand ko? So I have a route for customer/:id. If I go to index#customer/123 I want to see a new tab as of part 1 above. If I navigate to index#customer/234, I want to see a new tab for that as well. The user should then be able to move between the two tabs. Can this work, or is it really only recording the customer/:id route and I will only ever see one tab button?

@TITLE:Cloud Service deployment rolled back
@CONTENT:we had a strange issue a couple of times now with our Azure service. We have a cloud service installed that has a web application running on it. The service was created sometime around beginning of december and he first deployment was done that time as well. After that we did multiple deployments to the cloud service, but (it happens a couple of times now) sometime the Azure decides to roll back the deployment to initial one - the one that was made 2 months ago. This happened this midnight once again and we see that the files creation date on the "restored" or "rolled back" instance is 12/5/2013, which seems to be the date when we did an initial deployment. A question: 1) Why does that happen? 2) How can we determine what caused this rollback? 3) How can we prevent the rollback? or 4) How can we make a "snapshot" of the cloud service so when the Rollback happens, it actually rolls back to the latest stable image?

 I have read about CONNECT_BY_ISLEAF which returns 1 if it is a leaf, but I cannot query CONNECT_BY_ISLEAF like the Oracle example, and I don?t get any result. Even though I don?t know exactly how to make the query exactly with this function (Using case condition for example?) Thank you too much!

@TITLE:Save to isolated storage directly in WP8
@CONTENT:I want to save a zip file directly to isolated storage from server , But the problem i am facing was when i try to save using the below code , i get out of memory exception since my file size is > 150 MB some times. So i posted a question here and the suggestion was you can download such a file directly to IsolatedStorage, but if you want to put that into Memory - there can be a problem. So how can i save a file from server directly to isolated storage without saving to memory . The code i used is posted here client = new WebClient();

@TITLE:How to find if any values in array add up to n
@CONTENT:I have an array of random values, and a target value. #!/bin/bash
objective='50'
declare -a values=(1 2 2 6 8 14.5 15 28.7 .. 42)
 I need to find a way to extract any combination of numbers in the array 'values' that add up to 50 The array has duplicates, and floating point integers. A solution set might look like: 50 = 42 + 8
50 = 42 + 6 + 2
 Initially I started in bash with some nested for loops, however I'm quickly realizing that this will grow exponentially with my array length. I took a couple of java classes in college, but I'm still inexperienced in programming. I'm starting to think this may require recursion. Can anyone with more programming experience point me in the right direction? Besides nested for loops, how else could you approach this problem?
@CODE:#!/bin/bash

@TITLE:excel: check for duplicate rows based on 3 columns and keep one row
@CONTENT:This might be a bit much to ask but I'm wondering if the following is possible. this is all based on my initial question on Excel VBA Copy Range and Paste Values in another Sheet's specific Range I have a sheet that contains approximately 12 columns where the same type of data is copied to which means that two or more rows could contains the exact same data, however if I could check for duplicates it would be based on 3 specific columns. I don't want to use AutoFilter or Conditional Formatting for this task because the sheet can contain hundreds to thousands of rows and I want to be able to locate duplicates, delete them and keep just one original. I have also read other posts on here about Removing Duplicates based on column conditions but so far none has worked for me. The Range of data is from A thru P and down and the 3 columns that would identify a duplicate are A (which is numeric, an ID), B (which is a date), and P (which is a Text string). Where this data comes from, it will always have the same format and will always be placed in the same columns which is why if A,B,P are the same, then it is considered a duplicate. Thanks for the help in advance.

 I found this question which seems quite similar to my problem. He describes his solution as I had yet another bean validator jar in the class path. But not from maven, so i didn't realize it. Removing that solved the problem. I think my problem is the same. On http://hibernate.org/validator/documentation/getting-started/ it says: This transitively pulls in the dependency to the Bean Validation API (javax.validation:validation-api:1.1.0.Final) That must be causing this issue, since reverting to an older version (4.3.1.Final) fixes the issue. Is there a way to force Hibernate to not pull in the Bean Validation API? Edit: I've tried to exclude the javax-validation api:     <dependency>
      <groupId>org.hibernate</groupId>
      <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
      <version>5.0.3.Final</version>

@TITLE:Applying neural network to MFCCs for variable-length speech segments
@CONTENT:I'm currently trying to create and train a neural network to perform simple speech classification using MFCCs. At the moment, I'm using 26 coefficients for each sample, and a total of 5 different classes - these are five different words with varying numbers of syllables. While each sample is 2 seconds long, I am unsure how to handle cases where the user can pronounce words either very slowly or very quickly. E.g., the word 'television' spoken within 1 second yields different coefficients than the word spoken within two seconds. Any advice on how I can solve this problem would be much appreciated!

@TITLE:Android - SQLite AUTOINCREMENT not incrementing primary key
@CONTENT:I've searched around stack overflow and couldn't find a solution for this. This is my onCreate code for SQLite. public void onCreate(SQLiteDatabase database) {
    String query = "CREATE TABLE cards (cardID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, question VARCHAR, answer VARCHAR, subject VARCHAR)";
    database.execSQL(query);
}
 I use this to insert from the adapter (DbTools) public void insertCard(HashMap<String, String> queryValues) {

    SQLiteDatabase database = this.getWritableDatabase();
    ContentValues values = new ContentValues();
    values.put("question", queryValues.get("question"));
    values.put("answer", queryValues.get("answer"));
    values.put("subject", queryValues.get("subject"));

    database.insert("cards", null, values);
    database.close();

}
 This is the way I am inserting data into the database. HashMap<String, String> Values = new HashMap<String, String>(); 
Values.put("question", newQuestion);
Values.put("answer", newAnswer);
Values.put("subject", newSubject);
dbTools.insertCard(Values);
 Where newQuestion, newAnswer and newSubject are variables that define the user input from an edittext field. When I check the database by calling a toast, everything is inserted except the cardID which is inserted as Null. Doubting my toast check, I downloaded a database viewer and also found that the cardID was null. Any suggestions?

@CONTENT:I'm trying to loop through a list on a timer (currently 1 second but I want it faster). The problem is that the current value isn't being updated visually & I can't see why. When I loop through with Firebug it works as intended but without firebug it's not showing the text change...is it skipping the text update somehow?

 How in clojure do I access a random element in a vector of vectors? I keep seeing people say online that one of the benefits to using a vector over a list is that you get random access instead of having to recurse through a list but I haven't been able to find the function that allows me to do this. I'm used to in c++ where I could do matrix[1][1] and it would return the second element of the second vector. Am I stuck having to loop one element at a time through my vector or is there an easier way to access specific elements?

@TITLE:Extract piece of lambda for expression in select
@CONTENT:I can extract and reuse entire expression like that: Expression<Func<User, int>> userExpression = x => x.Roles.Count()
 but is it possible to extract some how only x.Roles.Count() part and use that in context of Expression<Func<User, T>> Thing that I am trying to achieve is reuse that part across different selects like: users.Select(x => new AnotherClass { RoleCount = roleCountPartOfExpression})
 and users.Select(x => new OneMoreAnotherClass 
              { 
                 AnotherProperty = roleCountPartOfExpression
              });
 So what roleCountPartOfExpression is supposed to be in this case should be supported in LINQ to Entities (so creating a method where I will pass User where will be return user.Roles.Count() will not work) also I cant create expression for select like Expression<Func<User, AnotherClass>> because in that case I will need to create Expression<Func<User, OneMoreAnotherClass>> and that will break my "reusability" goal.
@CODE:Expression<Func<User, int>> userExpression = x => x.Roles.Count() x.Roles.Count() Expression<Func<User, T>> users.Select(x => new AnotherClass { RoleCount = roleCountPartOfExpression}) users.Select(x => new OneMoreAnotherClass 
              { 
                 AnotherProperty = roleCountPartOfExpression
              }); roleCountPartOfExpression return user.Roles.Count() Expression<Func<User, AnotherClass>> Expression<Func<User, OneMoreAnotherClass>> Func<User, int> x

@CONTENT:I am currently trying to get Python to work within a Cocoa App. My first step is to include Python so that Xcode can link against it.

Do I have to set up some linker flags manually?

What is the UI mean 1st textblock: the response json will display here 3 buttons: [refresh JSON]: use API1 to refresh the threads list [New Post]: use API2 to post a new thread in the forum, title and text will display below [IE]: open json in IE use API1 Thread information: the thread you've just post use [New Post] button What does the JSON mean only need to focus 2 parts count: 244 ---> total threads count in the forum "57923" ---> the title of the 1st thread (the field "data" is a array of the threads list) What is the test procedure 1. open the app 2. click [refresh JSON] to get the list 3. remember the "count" part and the "title" of the 1st thread 4. click [New Post] to post a new thread, the title of the thread will display below 5. click [refresh JSON] to see the latest threads list 6. expected: the "count" accumulate by 1 and the "title" part should be the same as below Problem: 1. after clicking the [New Post], No matter how many times you hit [refresh JSON], the count will not accumulate! 2. but open the url in Chrome(Desktop), you will find that the JSON has already been updated! 3. close the app and reopen it, hit [refresh JSON], the JSON will updated as expected, but when you post a new thread, the problem occurs again Why and How to solve it?

@TITLE:Why is the Json.NET Parser automatically localizing the dates it's parsing?
@CONTENT:I'm running into problems with the Json.NET Parser. According to the documentation, simply using ToString() with no special converters should leave the Json unaltered. My Json string, however, is getting modified is having its date automatically localized, and it's causing all sorts of problems for me. For example, when I feed it the following string: {"_type": "Basic", "id": "44902a0f-7842-3a2d-83bf-a874ce0b47a1", "description": "TestBasicDescription", "participation": 1.000000000000000, "inception_date": "2014-02-06T20:34:00.925000+00:00", "expiry_date": "0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00"} I expect the code Newtonsoft.Json.Linq.JObject.Parse(content).ToString(Formatting.None);
 to produce a string that is virtually identical. What I get, however, is this: {"_type":"Basic","id":"44902a0f-7842-3a2d-83bf-a874ce0b47a1","description":"TestBasicDescription","participation":1.0,"inception_date":"2014-02-06T16:34:00.925-04:00","expiry_date":"0001-01-01T20:00:00-04:00"} As you can see, my dates have been localized. What makes this even worse is that in the case of a boundary date (like DateTime.MinValue as illustrated above) this automatically localized value is actually wrong. The timezone offset has caused the hour value to wrap around, and since the date cannot go any lower, it doesn't change, effectively turning the date into DateTime.MinValue plus 1 day: when it's converted back to UTC time (as it was originally) the date becomes "0001-01-02T00:00:00+00:00". Cue unit tests blowing up. Why isn't Json.Net behaving like it says it should? Is there any way to just parse the input Json then ToString() it exactly as it was?
@CODE:ToString() {"_type": "Basic", "id": "44902a0f-7842-3a2d-83bf-a874ce0b47a1", "description": "TestBasicDescription", "participation": 1.000000000000000, "inception_date": "2014-02-06T20:34:00.925000+00:00", "expiry_date": "0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00"} Newtonsoft.Json.Linq.JObject.Parse(content).ToString(Formatting.None); {"_type":"Basic","id":"44902a0f-7842-3a2d-83bf-a874ce0b47a1","description":"TestBasicDescription","participation":1.0,"inception_date":"2014-02-06T16:34:00.925-04:00","expiry_date":"0001-01-01T20:00:00-04:00"} DateTime.MinValue DateTime.MinValue "0001-01-02T00:00:00+00:00" ToString()

@TITLE:contenteditable put caret outside inserted span
@CONTENT:http://jsfiddle.net/VzbYJ/86/ Please have a look at this link. As it clears that it is going to insert a span node at the caret place. Problem is,after inserting the node if I am pressing any character its color is also green. because it is also coming inside the span element. So how can I put the caret after the span so that the color of next inserted node remains normal. I tried to find the selected node (based on to caret position), set the range after the element and used collapse(false). But I could not get the desired output. Code for find the node :   function findNode(event)
  {
    if (event.type == 'click')
    par = event.target;

    else if (event.type == 'keyup'){        
        if (document.selection)
        par = document.selection.createRange().parentElement();
    else if (window.getSelection){
        var range = window.getSelection().getRangeAt(0);
        par = range.commonAncestorContainer.parentNode;
    }
  }
 and next I set the boundary using setEndAfter() ant collapse(false). I am new in this field so I am not sure that what extend I am right. So any suggestion is very much appreciable. Thanks in advance.

@TITLE:Scale and center matrix on arbitrary point
@CONTENT:I'm using a custom ImageView to display a rather large bitmap. The bitmap display is being handled by a matrix that transforms it to what the user sees. I'm trying to implement a "double-tap-to-zoom" but I can't quite get it right. I'm trying to have the image zoom on the point where the user touched with this point ending up in the center of the screen at the end. I worked through a lot of the matrix math and transformations and basically the following transformation is what I need to do float dx = centerX - focusX;
float dy = centerY - focusY;

Matrix m = new Matrix( baseMatrix );
m.postTranslate( -focusX, -focusY );
m.postScale( scale, scale );
m.postTranslate( focusX + dx, focusY + dy );
 Which if I was just swapping the matrices would be fine but I need to animate from the baseMatrix to this new one. Is there a way I can interpolate between these two matrices? I tried to interpolate the scale and translation separately but that didn't work out well for me (quite possible that I did it wrong and it is the correct way to go). The way I am currently interpolating just for the scale is below. I've tried adding a translation interpolation in the handler as well and it just didn't work out mHandler.post( new Runnable() {

  @Override
  public void run() {
    mZooming = true;

    long now = System.currentTimeMillis();
    float currentMs = Math.min( durationMs, now - startTime );
    float newScale = (float) mEasing.easeInOut( currentMs, 0, deltaScale, durationMs );

    zoomTo( oldScale + newScale, destX, destY );

    if ( currentMs < durationMs ) {
      mHandler.post( this );
    } else {
      onZoomAnimationCompleted( getScale() );
      scrollBy( dx, dy, durationMs )
    }
  }
});
 Has anyone done something like this before? Am I approaching it completely wrong? Thanks in advance

@CONTENT:I want to apply Trade gothic font to my pdf text using PDFsharp, I have installed the font and use below line of code to apply XPdfFontOptions options = new XPdfFontOptions(PdfFontEncoding.Unicode, PdfFontEmbedding.Always);
// var options = new XPdfFontOptions(PdfFontEmbedding.Always);
XFont font = new XFont("TRADE GOTHIC BOLD CONDENSED NO. 20", 20, XFontStyle.Bold, options);
 But it does not work!!. Also I wanted to know in production I'm using Windows server 2008, is there a way I can dynamically add this font in production server even it is not there?

LoadPrivateFont(privateFontCollection, fontUri, "./#TradeGothicNo.20-Condensed"); 
 I tried all possible combination of path and file name , the name as mentioned in .ttf file but still getting exception .

@TITLE:VB.Net retrieve data from sql database according to user input textbox
@CONTENT:I have created a SQL Database with a VB application. I have got a form that allows users to insert new records. Each new record has a unique ID number. I want the user to be able to search for a record using the ID number. I have got one page with a text box that allows them to insert their ID number. Then they click submit. So the database is queried; if the ID number does not exist they get a message box with an error. If the ID number does exist a new page is displayed and the record is displayed. I assume the database connection would begin on the first page when the user inputs their ID number. I have got two tables for orders so I need to query both tables. This is the code I have for the first page.     Try

 It identifies when a record does not exist and displays the message box but when the right ID number is input it doesn't do anything, what am I doing wrong?

        var bb = mult_s(1.1,2.2);

 I got (with Haxe 3.01): Main.hx:xx: characters 48-49 : mult_s.T should be Int
Main.hx:xx: characters 50-51 : mult_s.A should be Int
 Can anyone please explain why T and A should be Int instead of Float? A more puzzling example is this: class Main {
    public static function min<T:(Int,Float)>(t:T, t2:T):T { return t < t2 ? t : t2; }
    static function main() {
        var a = min(1.1,2.2); //compile error
        var b = min(1,2); //ok
    }

 I can't see why t<t2 implies that either t or t2 is Int. But Haxe seems prefer Int: min is fine if called with Int's but fails if called with Float's. Is this reasonable? Thanks,

@LINK:/questions/21518067/modify-main-windows-locale-after-user-changes-settings-in-control-panel-region
@TITLE:Modify main window's locale after user changes settings in Control Panel->Regional and Language Options
@CONTENT:INTRODUCTION AND RELEVANT INFORMATION: I have MS Access 2007 database which I fill using ADO. Among other data types ( string, integer...) I also have a double. Since I work on Windows XP and use pure Win32 API to create GUI, I collect data from edit controls with GetDlgItemText API and then I convert that text into double using _wtof_l. PROBLEM: Everything works well if the user sets English or Serbian ( we use European notation for decimal and group separator ) locale and then starts the program, but the problem occurs when user changes locale settings while the program is working. Let me demonstrate this on a small example: Let us assume that user has English locale set. Then user starts my application. Then user decides to change the locale ( Control Panel->Regional and Language Settings for Windows XP ) before he hits the "Save" button. After the changes apply he then enters data and then hits "save". The error in converting text to double must occur ( _wtof_l will now truncate 1.25 to 1 ), since my program uses default ANSI "C" locale and did not adapt it to reflect users modification. MY EFFORTS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM: To prevent this I need to adapt my program to the possibility described above-I need to set my locale to the one user selected before executing query. To do so I use message from answer to my previous question to detect when user changes settings in Control Panel->Regional and Language Options. Then I use _wsetlocale(LC_ALL,"") to set my applications locale to the one selected by the user. However, wrong conversion from text to decimal number described above still occurs. This only happens when I change the locale during my program's work. If I leave locale untouched ( as 99.9% of users will ) everything seems to work fine. To further help the community I have made a demo application that illustrates the problem. It will be presented in the APPENDIX section at the end of this post. QUESTION: How can I respond to WM_SETTINGCHANGE message to set my application's locale to the one currently selected by the user so my "save" button handler can perform proper conversion from string to double with _wtof_l function? Thank you. Best regards. APPENDIX: Steps to create the demo application that illustrates my problem: 1.Create default Win32 project in Visual Studio. 2.Add the following WM_CREATE handler: case WM_CREATE:
    {
        _wsetlocale( LC_ALL, L"" ); //set current locale at window creation

        INITCOMMONCONTROLSEX iccex;
        memset( &iccex, 0, sizeof(INITCOMMONCONTROLSEX) );
        iccex.dwSize = sizeof(INITCOMMONCONTROLSEX);
        iccex.dwICC = ICC_STANDARD_CLASSES | ICC_TAB_CLASSES | ICC_BAR_CLASSES;
        InitCommonControlsEx( &iccex );

        // text

        HWND hEdit = CreateWindowEx( 0, L"Edit", L"",

@LINK:/questions/21517909/schedule-running-a-bash-shell-script-in-windows
@TITLE:schedule running a bash shell script in windows
@CONTENT:Apreciate any help and excuse me if my terminology is incorrect. this is a script(*.sh file) that: 1-goes to a specific dir A 2-copies files from another dir B to dir A 3-#comented out# it also unzips the files in dir A and its subdirectories 4-#comented out# it also removes rows 1-6 and the last row of all *.csv files in dir A #!/bin/bash

# Configure bash so the script will exit if a command fails.
set -e 

#cd to the dir you want to copy to:
cd /cygdrive/c/path/I/want/to/copy/to
#echo Hello

#cp the files i want 
#include the subdirectories 
cp -r /cygdrive/c/path/I/want/to/copy/from/* .

# This will unzip all .zip files in all subdirectories under this one.
# -o is required to overwrite everything that is in there
#find -iname '*.zip' -execdir unzip -o {} \;

#find ./ -iname '*.csv' -exec sed -i '1,6d;$ d' '{}' ';'
 Now I can get this script to work in cygwin by going to the dir where the file is stored and giving the following commands: ./filename.sh
 or /cygdrive/c/path/where/the/file/is/filename.sh
 or bash filename.sh
 I can also do this in CMD/Windows DOS by doing the following: C:\cygwin\bin\bash.exe -l 
 to get into a bash terminal and then give the following command: /cygdrive/c/path/where/the/file/is/filename.sh
 In task scheduler(in Windows) I have tried to schedule the following: C:\cygwin\bin\bash.exe -l /cygdrive/c/path/where/the/file/is/filename.sh
 but this does not work, even though the seperate commands work in CMD/Windows DOS as I have said above Now what I want to do is be able to schedule this script(filename.sh) like I would a .vbs or .bat file in windows using task scheduler? Can anyone advise on this? Note I have tried to write a Windows batch file(.bat) to do this(see below), but I could not get my unzip and sed commands to work,see here. So I have tried to write the Bash shell script above. chdir C:\pointA
C:\cygwin\bin\cp.exe /cygdrive/v/pointB/* .
::find -iname *.zip -execdir unzip {} \;
::find ./ -iname '*.csv' -exec sed -i '1,6d;$ d' '{}' ';'

@TITLE:Getting validation errors from PHP via AJAX
@CONTENT:As of right now, I have created a simple contact form. Currently, I need to reload the page if I want to validate anything with PHP (I already have Client side validation in place). However, I want to do this without reloading my page. Since I have no experience with ajax I was confused by all the examples I saw on the internet. I would also like to use jQuery $.post() if possible, but I think ajax does the same. Here is the simple markup: <form id="myForm" method="POST" action="">

    <input name="name" class="<? if($errorsArray['email']) {echo "error";} ?>" type="email" required><br>
    <input name="comment" class="<? if($errorsArray['name']) {echo "error";} ?> " type="text" required><br>

    <input name="submit" type="submit" value="Send">

</form>
 My PHP: $requiredFields = array('name', 'comment');
foreach ($requiredFields as $field) {
    $errorsArray[$field] = true;
}
 I echo "error" in the class attribute to signify an error. However, this requires me to reload the page, which I do not want to do. (I also do the same way to keep the already submitted values is there is an error). How would I use ajax to give each field (with errors) the class addition: error? If you need any more code, I will be more than happy to give it, just give me a comment.
@CODE:$.post() <form id="myForm" method="POST" action="">

    <input name="name" class="<? if($errorsArray['email']) {echo "error";} ?>" type="email" required><br>
    <input name="comment" class="<? if($errorsArray['name']) {echo "error";} ?> " type="text" required><br>

    <input name="submit" type="submit" value="Send">

</form> $requiredFields = array('name', 'comment');
foreach ($requiredFields as $field) {
    $errorsArray[$field] = true;

@CONTENT:Today I ported my old memory benchmark from Borland C++ builder 5.0 to BDS2006 Turbo C++ and found out weird thing exe from BCB5 runs OK and stable exe from BDS2006 measure OK only before main Form is started (inside its constructor) if the benchmark is started again after main form is Activated or even after any VCL component change (for example Caption of main form) then the speed of benchmark thread is strongly affected does not mater if test is inside thread or not process/thread priority,affinity does not affect this hide of any window (Visibility,Enabled) does not affect this call the test form OnIdleEvent does not affect this does not mater if time is measured by RDTSC or PerformanceCounter My conclusion is that VCL library runs some code/thread on the background so my questions are: 1.Is there a way to temporarily pause VCL code/stuff ? ideal something like Application->Pause(); and Application->Resume(); or just Forms 2.what else could cause this behavior and how to avoid it ? PS. test application has no VCL components other than main form benchmark is just a few memory transfers by rep stosd with different block sizes (no funny stuff) source is here http://stackoverflow.com/a/21509808/2521214 I know BDS2006 is out-dated but I am not looking for upgrade right now so please skip any comments about that they are not help-full tested on Windows7 pro x64, 32bit Application

@LINK:/questions/21500947/android-activity-slow-on-4-3-device
@TITLE:Android Activity slow on 4.3 device
@CONTENT:I developed an app that would stream videos from the web. I have an activity that lists the videos including their icons, titles and status (newly updated). For every row, there is a thumbnail for the video, the video title, and then a "fresh" icon to indicate it's a new upload. In the emulator, this works relatively fine. In a 2.3 and 4.0.3 HTC Evo devices, it works great. On an HTC One 4.3 device, this activity is really slow. Clicking an item on the list, which takes you to another activity, works fine. Other activities are OK except the list activity. Here's what I've experimented so far. I have removed the "fresh" icon from the xml, and it worked great. So I assumed it has something to do with this icon. The image is quite large (1000x900px) but only rendered in 50x50dp. I haven't tried downsizing this image to see the performance. But if this is the problem, how come the older HTC phones can render it perfectly. Only other difference from HTC One and the older HTC phones is that HTC One has an action bar and the older phones use the dedicated menu key in the device. Is there a way to check the memory usage or processes while running an app in a device to see why it's taking so slow? UPDATE: I have resized the image to 100x100px, and it's definitely faster. But I still notice there is some lag. Here's the layout for that list row: <RelativeLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"

@TITLE:RestKit RKMappingTest JSON array
@CONTENT:I'm using RestKit ~> 0.20.3 and RestKit/Testing ~> 0.20.3. So this is an example of my mapping: RKObjectMapping *mapping = [RKObjectMapping mappingForClass:[PlayerVO class]];
[mapping addAttributeMappingsFromArray:@[@"firstName", @"middeName", @"lastName", @"dob", @"sex"]];
 This is my mock data: NSDictionary *data = @{@"players": @[@{@"firstName": @"Ahmed", @"middleName": @"Ahmed", @"lastName": @"Ahmed", @"dob": @"100", @"sex": @"m"}]};
 This is my mappingTest: RKMappingTest *mappingTest = [RKMappingTest testForMapping:mapping sourceObject:data destinationObject:nil];
 And finally my expectation: RKPropertyMappingTestExpectation *expectation = [RKPropertyMappingTestExpectation expectationWithSourceKeyPath:@"players.firstName" destinationKeyPath:@"firstName" evaluationBlock:^BOOL(RKPropertyMappingTestExpectation *expectation, RKPropertyMapping *mapping, id mappedValue, NSError *__autoreleasing *error) {
    BOOL expect = [mappedValue length] > 0;

    XCTAssertTrue(expect);

    return expect;
}];

[mappingTest addExpectation:expectation];

XCTAssertTrue([mappingTest evaluate]);
XCTAssertNoThrow([mappingTest verify]);
 So this test fails as there doesn't seem to be a way I can specify a key path to follow as the data is an array. This is the error I get: testPlayerServiceGetPlayers] : (([mappingTest verify]) does not throw) failed: throwing "0x8e7d770: failed with error: (null)
RKMappingTest Expectations: (
    "map 'players.firstName' to 'firstName' satisfying evaluation block"
)
Events: (
) during mapping from {
    players =     (
                {
            dob = 100;
            firstName = Ahmed;
            lastName = Ahmed;
            middleName = Ahmed;
            sex = m;
        }
    );
} to (null) with mapping <RKObjectMapping:0x8e6aad0 objectClass=PlayerVO propertyMappings=(
    "<RKAttributeMapping: 0x8e6b880 firstName => firstName>",
    "<RKAttributeMapping: 0x8e61df0 middeName => middeName>",
    "<RKAttributeMapping: 0x8e2f580 lastName => lastName>",
    "<RKAttributeMapping: 0x8e67a60 dob => dob>",
    "<RKAttributeMapping: 0x8e2c120 sex => sex>"
)>"
 If I change my data to: NSDictionary *data = @{@"firstName": @"Ahmed", @"middleName": @"Naseer", @"lastName": @"Nuaman", @"dob": @"524534400", @"sex": @"m"};
 And the expectation's expectationWithSourceKeyPath to @"firstName", the tests pass. So this leads me to believe the issue is clearly relative to setting the key path. Now in my app that's done using: RKResponseDescriptor *responseDescriptor = [RKResponseDescriptor responseDescriptorWithMapping:mapping method:RKRequestMethodAny pathPattern:nil keyPath:@"players" statusCodes:statusCodes];
 However I can't find a way of setting the keyPath for a RKMappingTest or RKPropertyMappingTestExpectation, any ideas on how I can achieve this? Update So I had a look throughRKMappingTest.h and found the rootKeyPath. I set the following: mappingTest.rootKeyPath = @"players";
 And still was having problems regarding the mappedValue in the RKPropertyMappingTestExpectation. So I also changed my data to this: NSDictionary *data = @{@"players": @{@"firstName": @"Ahmed", @"middleName": @"Ahmed", @"lastName": @"Ahmed", @"dob": @"100", @"sex": @"m"}};
 And now I can see that mappedValue is now set to Ahmed and updated the RKPropertyMappingTestExpectation to the following: RKPropertyMappingTestExpectation *expectation = [RKPropertyMappingTestExpectation expectationWithSourceKeyPath:@"firstName" destinationKeyPath:@"firstName" evaluationBlock:^BOOL(RKPropertyMappingTestExpectation *expectation, RKPropertyMapping *mapping, id mappedValue, NSError *__autoreleasing *error) {
    return [mappedValue isEqualToString:@"Ahmed"];
}];
 But this is using an object rather than an array. Any more suggestions?

@TITLE:Upgrade to Play Framework 2.2 Securesocial problems
@CONTENT:Hi I am trying to upgrade to Play 2.2 and am having some problems getting securesocial to work. I am using the latest snapshot as was suggested in the forums but get the error below. The verify error indicates compiled source incompatibility somewhere between binaries and the version I am using. I have tried switching between java 1.6 and 1.7 but get the same issue.

@TITLE:How to include or bootstrap the paypal-core-sdk php
@CONTENT:I've downloaded the paypal-core-sdk for php from GitHub manually, my server does not have 'composer' and I've just manually copied the files to an include directory outside the document root. Problem is when I go call on some of the classes the server borks and doesn't know what I'm talking about ... i.e. Fatal error: Class 'PPApiContext' not found in /home/rctoronto/public_html/start.php on line 143
 if I include once on the file providing PPApiContext, it moves along to another error and so on eventually proceeds when I've included all the ones it complains about. But then the sdk has internal dependency issues. How do I formally declare the sdk library so my app can use it - I've scoured the web and haven't managed to find a good answer to this question. I've tried manually altering my include_path using my php.ini and still it can't use the classes of the sdk. I don't have access to /usr/lib/php or /usr/local/lib/php as I am on a shared server. this is the 'getAuthorize' url for paypal (which I've gotten to work with manually include_once on the files... $apicontext = new PPApiContext(array('mode' => 'live'));
$clientId = PP_CLIENTID;
$clientSecret = PP_SECRET;
$scope = array('openid', 'email'); 
$redirectUri = 'https://maskedurl.ca/login?ltype=pp&loginSubmit=true';
$pp_authUrl = PPOpenIdSession::getAuthorizationUrl($redirectUri, $scope , $clientId,       $apicontext); 
 But how do we properly declare the sdk library in whole?

@LINK:/questions/21494085/python-beautifulsoup-getting-a-column-from-table-indexerror-list-index-out-of
@TITLE:Python BeautifulSoup Getting a column from table - IndexError List index out of range
@CONTENT:Python newbie here. Python 2.7 with beautifulsoup 4. I am trying to get parse a webpage to get columns using BeautifulSoup. The webpage has tables inside tables; but table 4 is the one that I want, it does not have any headers or th tag. I want to get the data into column. from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import urllib2

url = 'http://finance.yahoo.com/q/op?s=aapl+Options'
htmltext = urllib2.urlopen(url).read()
soup = BeautifulSoup(htmltext)

#Table 8 has the data needed; it is nested under other tables though
# specific reference works as below:
print soup.findAll('table')[8].findAll('tr')[2].findAll('td')[2].contents

# Below loop erros out:
for row in soup.findAll('table')[8].findAll('tr'):
    column2 = row.findAll('td')[2].contents
    print column2

# "Index error: list index out of range" is what I get on second line of for loop.
 I saw this as a working solution in another example but didnt work for me. Also tried iterating around tr: mytr = soup.findAll('table')[8].findAll('tr')

for row in mytr:
    print row.find('td') #works but gives only first td as expected
    print row.findAll('td')[2]
 which gives an error that row is a list which is out of index. So: First findAll('table') - works second findAll('tr') - works third findAll('td') - works only if ALL [ ] are numbers and not variables. e.g. print soup.findAll('table')[8].findAll('tr')[2].findAll('td')[2].contents
 Above works as it is specific reference but not through variables. But I need it inside a loop to get full column.
@CODE:from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import urllib2

url = 'http://finance.yahoo.com/q/op?s=aapl+Options'
htmltext = urllib2.urlopen(url).read()
soup = BeautifulSoup(htmltext)

#Table 8 has the data needed; it is nested under other tables though
# specific reference works as below:
print soup.findAll('table')[8].findAll('tr')[2].findAll('td')[2].contents

# Below loop erros out:
for row in soup.findAll('table')[8].findAll('tr'):
    column2 = row.findAll('td')[2].contents
    print column2

# "Index error: list index out of range" is what I get on second line of for loop. mytr = soup.findAll('table')[8].findAll('tr')

for row in mytr:
    print row.find('td') #works but gives only first td as expected
    print row.findAll('td')[2] print soup.findAll('table')[8].findAll('tr')[2].findAll('td')[2].contents

@TITLE:How to check intersection of two images that aren't rectangular?
@CONTENT:New user to the site, but I have used it in the past so I felt it best to ask my question here, for the best chance of getting a response. What I'm dealing with is one object, this being the sprite for my latest app, which I need to check for when it comes in to contact with another object, in this case, a tunnel which will curve. Now, I'm aware of CGRectIntersectsRect, however I can't see that being helpful, as if I've got 2 UIImages, that being the top and bottom of a "mountain", and said pieces curving, there's no doubt that the sprite would touch the "rectangle". What I need is something to trigger when the sprite hits the actual wall, however my limited knowledge of Objective-C isn't helping my case. I imagine someone out there will know what I can do to resolve this, as for all I know it could be a simple solution. Thank you in advance everyone!

@CONTENT:I want to create flash multiplayer game for Facebook. I already done with game's code, just I don't know how to integrate AppWarp correctly.

            WarpClient.getInstance().setRoomRequestListener(listener);  
            WarpClient.getInstance().setNotificationListener(listener);  
}
 I got errors (in AppWarpListener.as file): 1045: Interface ConnectionRequestListener was not found.
1045: Interface RoomRequestListener was not found.
1045: Interface NotificationListener was not found.
 I followed this tutorial and I downloaded this SDK. Inside SDK folder are many versions of swc, so I installed latest: V_1.5.2 here is file AppWarpLib.swc I imported It to Adobe Flash CC in 2 ways: By clicking Preferences (CTRL + U) > Code Editor > Action Script 3.0 Settings > Library path (I put here path to swc);

And By clicking publish settings SWC > Output file (here I select that swc)
 But the same, still I got these errors. Maybe that because I need to keep code files on FTP? I'm testing It from my PC. Also after I set path in Preferences I got many warnings like that: `Line 1, Column 1   Warning: 5002: The frame scripts of the symbol 'Symbol 116' have been ignored because a compiled clip contains a definition for Game__fla.Symbol116_26. To override the Game__fla.Symbol116_26 definition, place a custom class file within your classpath.`
 Also in SDK folder which link I wrote before is sample folder, but inside only .as files and I don't know how to try It without .fla file. So have you ideas? Thanks.

@TITLE:Getting validation errors from PHP via AJAX
@CONTENT:As of right now, I have created a simple contact form. Currently, I need to reload the page if I want to validate anything with PHP (I already have Client side validation in place). However, I want to do this without reloading my page. Since I have no experience with ajax I was confused by all the examples I saw on the internet. I would also like to use jQuery $.post() if possible, but I think ajax does the same. Here is the simple markup: <form id="myForm" method="POST" action="">

    <input name="name" class="<? if($errorsArray['email']) {echo "error";} ?>" type="email" required><br>
    <input name="comment" class="<? if($errorsArray['name']) {echo "error";} ?> " type="text" required><br>

    <input name="submit" type="submit" value="Send">

</form>
 My PHP: $requiredFields = array('name', 'comment');
foreach ($requiredFields as $field) {
    $errorsArray[$field] = true;
}
 I echo "error" in the class attribute to signify an error. However, this requires me to reload the page, which I do not want to do. (I also do the same way to keep the already submitted values is there is an error). How would I use ajax to give each field (with errors) the class addition: error? If you need any more code, I will be more than happy to give it, just give me a comment.
@CODE:$.post() <form id="myForm" method="POST" action="">

    <input name="name" class="<? if($errorsArray['email']) {echo "error";} ?>" type="email" required><br>
    <input name="comment" class="<? if($errorsArray['name']) {echo "error";} ?> " type="text" required><br>

    <input name="submit" type="submit" value="Send">

@TITLE:Benchmarking affected by VCL
@CONTENT:Today I ported my old memory benchmark from Borland C++ builder 5.0 to BDS2006 Turbo C++ and found out weird thing exe from BCB5 runs OK and stable exe from BDS2006 measure OK only before main Form is started (inside its constructor) if the benchmark is started again after main form is Activated or even after any VCL component change (for example Caption of main form) then the speed of benchmark thread is strongly affected does not mater if test is inside thread or not process/thread priority,affinity does not affect this hide of any window (Visibility,Enabled) does not affect this call the test form OnIdleEvent does not affect this does not mater if time is measured by RDTSC or PerformanceCounter My conclusion is that VCL library runs some code/thread on the background so my questions are: 1.Is there a way to temporarily pause VCL code/stuff ? ideal something like Application->Pause(); and Application->Resume(); or just Forms 2.what else could cause this behavior and how to avoid it ? PS. test application has no VCL components other than main form benchmark is just a few memory transfers by rep stosd with different block sizes (no funny stuff) source is here http://stackoverflow.com/a/21509808/2521214 I know BDS2006 is out-dated but I am not looking for upgrade right now so please skip any comments about that they are not help-full tested on Windows7 pro x64, 32bit Application

@CONTENT:I am creating a Qt/C++ console application which successfully forks. When I call QCoreApplication::applicationPid() before fork, and then after fork (in the child), I get the same pid. I realize I could just use the return value from fork() but I'm trying to do things the Qt way. Is there a better/right way to get the PID of the child (from within the child) in Qt? And out of curiosity, why isn't QCoreApplication::applicationPid() providing the new PID? I assume it's now providing the ppid....

@TITLE:Develop a Chrome extension that overrides SSL certificate exception for a self signed certificate
@CONTENT:I frequently access a trusted website that uses a self signed certificate. Every time I access it I need to click - through the SSL error page. I know that it is possible to do some manual settings and add the certificate to the list of Chrome's trusted certificate list. As a self learning fun exercise, I decided to create an extension that does the same thing on a click. I have already gone through Chrome Developer's guide at http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/devguide.html and have read a couple of other blogs, but I am unable to get an idea on how to implement this extension. I want to know appropriate JavaScript Classes/ Chrome developer tools/ learning resources/ tutorials that can be used to implement this. I would like to point out that I am an undergraduate student and the concept of SSL/TLS errors and extension development is new to me. Any help would be appreciated!

@LINK:/questions/21500947/android-activity-slow-on-4-3-device
@TITLE:Android Activity slow on 4.3 device
@CONTENT:I developed an app that would stream videos from the web. I have an activity that lists the videos including their icons, titles and status (newly updated). For every row, there is a thumbnail for the video, the video title, and then a "fresh" icon to indicate it's a new upload. In the emulator, this works relatively fine. In a 2.3 and 4.0.3 HTC Evo devices, it works great. On an HTC One 4.3 device, this activity is really slow. Clicking an item on the list, which takes you to another activity, works fine. Other activities are OK except the list activity. Here's what I've experimented so far. I have removed the "fresh" icon from the xml, and it worked great. So I assumed it has something to do with this icon. The image is quite large (1000x900px) but only rendered in 50x50dp. I haven't tried downsizing this image to see the performance. But if this is the problem, how come the older HTC phones can render it perfectly. Only other difference from HTC One and the older HTC phones is that HTC One has an action bar and the older phones use the dedicated menu key in the device. Is there a way to check the memory usage or processes while running an app in a device to see why it's taking so slow? UPDATE: I have resized the image to 100x100px, and it's definitely faster. But I still notice there is some lag. Here's the layout for that list row: <RelativeLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"

@TITLE:RestKit RKMappingTest JSON array
@CONTENT:I'm using RestKit ~> 0.20.3 and RestKit/Testing ~> 0.20.3. So this is an example of my mapping: RKObjectMapping *mapping = [RKObjectMapping mappingForClass:[PlayerVO class]];
[mapping addAttributeMappingsFromArray:@[@"firstName", @"middeName", @"lastName", @"dob", @"sex"]];
 This is my mock data: NSDictionary *data = @{@"players": @[@{@"firstName": @"Ahmed", @"middleName": @"Ahmed", @"lastName": @"Ahmed", @"dob": @"100", @"sex": @"m"}]};
 This is my mappingTest: RKMappingTest *mappingTest = [RKMappingTest testForMapping:mapping sourceObject:data destinationObject:nil];
 And finally my expectation: RKPropertyMappingTestExpectation *expectation = [RKPropertyMappingTestExpectation expectationWithSourceKeyPath:@"players.firstName" destinationKeyPath:@"firstName" evaluationBlock:^BOOL(RKPropertyMappingTestExpectation *expectation, RKPropertyMapping *mapping, id mappedValue, NSError *__autoreleasing *error) {
    BOOL expect = [mappedValue length] > 0;

    XCTAssertTrue(expect);

    return expect;
}];

[mappingTest addExpectation:expectation];

XCTAssertTrue([mappingTest evaluate]);
XCTAssertNoThrow([mappingTest verify]);
 So this test fails as there doesn't seem to be a way I can specify a key path to follow as the data is an array. This is the error I get: testPlayerServiceGetPlayers] : (([mappingTest verify]) does not throw) failed: throwing "0x8e7d770: failed with error: (null)

    "map 'players.firstName' to 'firstName' satisfying evaluation block"

    players =     (
                {
            dob = 100;
            firstName = Ahmed;
            lastName = Ahmed;
            middleName = Ahmed;
            sex = m;
        }
    );
} to (null) with mapping <RKObjectMapping:0x8e6aad0 objectClass=PlayerVO propertyMappings=(

    "<RKAttributeMapping: 0x8e67a60 dob => dob>",
    "<RKAttributeMapping: 0x8e2c120 sex => sex>"
)>"
 If I change my data to: NSDictionary *data = @{@"firstName": @"Ahmed", @"middleName": @"Naseer", @"lastName": @"Nuaman", @"dob": @"524534400", @"sex": @"m"};
 And the expectation's expectationWithSourceKeyPath to @"firstName", the tests pass. So this leads me to believe the issue is clearly relative to setting the key path. Now in my app that's done using: RKResponseDescriptor *responseDescriptor = [RKResponseDescriptor responseDescriptorWithMapping:mapping method:RKRequestMethodAny pathPattern:nil keyPath:@"players" statusCodes:statusCodes];
 However I can't find a way of setting the keyPath for a RKMappingTest or RKPropertyMappingTestExpectation, any ideas on how I can achieve this? Update So I had a look throughRKMappingTest.h and found the rootKeyPath. I set the following: mappingTest.rootKeyPath = @"players";
 And still was having problems regarding the mappedValue in the RKPropertyMappingTestExpectation. So I also changed my data to this: NSDictionary *data = @{@"players": @{@"firstName": @"Ahmed", @"middleName": @"Ahmed", @"lastName": @"Ahmed", @"dob": @"100", @"sex": @"m"}};
 And now I can see that mappedValue is now set to Ahmed and updated the RKPropertyMappingTestExpectation to the following: RKPropertyMappingTestExpectation *expectation = [RKPropertyMappingTestExpectation expectationWithSourceKeyPath:@"firstName" destinationKeyPath:@"firstName" evaluationBlock:^BOOL(RKPropertyMappingTestExpectation *expectation, RKPropertyMapping *mapping, id mappedValue, NSError *__autoreleasing *error) {
    return [mappedValue isEqualToString:@"Ahmed"];
}];
 But this is using an object rather than an array. Any more suggestions?

@TITLE:Searching DataGridView and Selecting Match
@CONTENT:How would I search a DataGridView's first column for a Value and select the row IF the Value is there? -- Much like a WHERE Clause in SQL. I've been looking around for an answer in threads but I can't seem to find one. DataGridView1 is the DataGridView and My.Settings.CurrentUserID is the Value I want to search for. Any help would be appreciated. Note; There can only be one occurrence of the Value in the table, so there is no concern for multiple returns/matches. {Edit 1} Steves solution seems to only highlight the row and not actually select it as the Black arrow doesn't move onto it. The value the code's looking for is 4, notice how it finds it and highlights it, but the arrow doesn't move. The code does this: I need it to do this:

@TITLE:How to include or bootstrap the paypal-core-sdk php
@CONTENT:I've downloaded the paypal-core-sdk for php from GitHub manually, my server does not have 'composer' and I've just manually copied the files to an include directory outside the document root. Problem is when I go call on some of the classes the server borks and doesn't know what I'm talking about ... i.e. Fatal error: Class 'PPApiContext' not found in /home/rctoronto/public_html/start.php on line 143
 if I include once on the file providing PPApiContext, it moves along to another error and so on eventually proceeds when I've included all the ones it complains about. But then the sdk has internal dependency issues. How do I formally declare the sdk library so my app can use it - I've scoured the web and haven't managed to find a good answer to this question. I've tried manually altering my include_path using my php.ini and still it can't use the classes of the sdk. I don't have access to /usr/lib/php or /usr/local/lib/php as I am on a shared server. this is the 'getAuthorize' url for paypal (which I've gotten to work with manually include_once on the files... $apicontext = new PPApiContext(array('mode' => 'live'));
$clientId = PP_CLIENTID;
$clientSecret = PP_SECRET;
$scope = array('openid', 'email'); 
$redirectUri = 'https://maskedurl.ca/login?ltype=pp&loginSubmit=true';
$pp_authUrl = PPOpenIdSession::getAuthorizationUrl($redirectUri, $scope , $clientId,       $apicontext); 
 But how do we properly declare the sdk library in whole?

The webpage has tables inside tables; but table 4 is the one that I want, it does not have any headers or th tag. I want to get the data into column. from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import urllib2

url = 'http://finance.yahoo.com/q/op?s=aapl+Options'
htmltext = urllib2.urlopen(url).read()
soup = BeautifulSoup(htmltext)

#Table 8 has the data needed; it is nested under other tables though
# specific reference works as below:
print soup.findAll('table')[8].findAll('tr')[2].findAll('td')[2].contents

# Below loop erros out:
for row in soup.findAll('table')[8].findAll('tr'):
    column2 = row.findAll('td')[2].contents
    print column2

# "Index error: list index out of range" is what I get on second line of for loop.
 I saw this as a working solution in another example but didnt work for me. Also tried iterating around tr: mytr = soup.findAll('table')[8].findAll('tr')

for row in mytr:
    print row.find('td') #works but gives only first td as expected
    print row.findAll('td')[2]
 which gives an error that row is a list which is out of index. So: First findAll('table') - works second findAll('tr') - works third findAll('td') - works only if ALL [ ] are numbers and not variables. e.g. print soup.findAll('table')[8].findAll('tr')[2].findAll('td')[2].contents
 Above works as it is specific reference but not through variables. But I need it inside a loop to get full column.
@CODE:from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import urllib2

url = 'http://finance.yahoo.com/q/op?s=aapl+Options'
htmltext = urllib2.urlopen(url).read()
soup = BeautifulSoup(htmltext)

#Table 8 has the data needed; it is nested under other tables though
# specific reference works as below:
print soup.findAll('table')[8].findAll('tr')[2].findAll('td')[2].contents

# Below loop erros out:
for row in soup.findAll('table')[8].findAll('tr'):
    column2 = row.findAll('td')[2].contents
    print column2

# "Index error: list index out of range" is what I get on second line of for loop. mytr = soup.findAll('table')[8].findAll('tr')

for row in mytr:
    print row.find('td') #works but gives only first td as expected
    print row.findAll('td')[2] print soup.findAll('table')[8].findAll('tr')[2].findAll('td')[2].contents

@TITLE:How to check intersection of two images that aren't rectangular?
@CONTENT:New user to the site, but I have used it in the past so I felt it best to ask my question here, for the best chance of getting a response. What I'm dealing with is one object, this being the sprite for my latest app, which I need to check for when it comes in to contact with another object, in this case, a tunnel which will curve. Now, I'm aware of CGRectIntersectsRect, however I can't see that being helpful, as if I've got 2 UIImages, that being the top and bottom of a "mountain", and said pieces curving, there's no doubt that the sprite would touch the "rectangle". What I need is something to trigger when the sprite hits the actual wall, however my limited knowledge of Objective-C isn't helping my case. I imagine someone out there will know what I can do to resolve this, as for all I know it could be a simple solution. Thank you in advance everyone!

@TITLE:How to successfully integrate AppWarp to ActionScript 3 code?
@CONTENT:I want to create flash multiplayer game for Facebook. I already done with game's code, just I don't know how to integrate AppWarp correctly. I've created app on AppHq, have Api and secret keys, also created room an I have room's ID. When In my main class ActionScript 3.0 code I try to use this:     public class Script extends MovieClip
    {
        public var roomID:String = "my room id";  
        private var apiKey:String = "my api key"  
        private var secretKey:String = "my secret"; 
        private var listener:AppWarpListener;
    }
            public function Script()
        {
            WarpClient.initialize(apiKey, secretKey);      
            WarpClient.getInstance().setConnectionRequestListener(listener);  
            WarpClient.getInstance().setRoomRequestListener(listener);  
            WarpClient.getInstance().setNotificationListener(listener);  
}
 I got errors (in AppWarpListener.as file): 1045: Interface ConnectionRequestListener was not found.
1045: Interface RoomRequestListener was not found.
1045: Interface NotificationListener was not found.
 I followed this tutorial and I downloaded this SDK. Inside SDK folder are many versions of swc, so I installed latest: V_1.5.2 here is file AppWarpLib.swc I imported It to Adobe Flash CC in 2 ways: By clicking Preferences (CTRL + U) > Code Editor > Action Script 3.0 Settings > Library path (I put here path to swc);

And By clicking publish settings SWC > Output file (here I select that swc)
 But the same, still I got these errors. Maybe that because I need to keep code files on FTP? I'm testing It from my PC. Also after I set path in Preferences I got many warnings like that: `Line 1, Column 1   Warning: 5002: The frame scripts of the symbol 'Symbol 116' have been ignored because a compiled clip contains a definition for Game__fla.Symbol116_26. To override the Game__fla.Symbol116_26 definition, place a custom class file within your classpath.`
 Also in SDK folder which link I wrote before is sample folder, but inside only .as files and I don't know how to try It without .fla file. So have you ideas? Thanks. Also in SDK folder which link I wrote before is sample folder, but inside only .as files and I don't know how to try It without .fla file.

Here is my code snippet: .xaml file  <ListBox HorizontalAlignment="Left" Name="listbox1" ItemsSource="{Binding}" Margin="9,10,0,0" SelectionChanged="listBox1_SelectionChanged">
              <ListBox.ItemTemplate>

                                 <TextBlock Text="{Binding AttractionName}" Foreground="Yellow" Margin="120,-110,0,0""/>

@TITLE:How to accomplish inheritance effectively using proto-buffers
@CONTENT:I have a base class message message Animal {
     optional string name = 1;
     optional int32 age = 2;  
}
 and the sub-class which extends animal message Dog{
     optional string breed = 1;
}
 So while building a dog message , i should be able to set all the fields of Animal. I know the round about way of doing it (declaring all the animal fields once again in dog message)but is it possible simply and effectively using protobuffers? Also i learnt about extensions and i understood that it is just used to add a new field to the already existing message and so it should not be misconstrued to be the possible solution for achieving inheritance. Is it possible to achieve the above simple design using protobuffers's extensions?
@CODE:message Animal {
     optional string name = 1;
     optional int32 age = 2;  
} message Dog{
     optional string breed = 1;

@TITLE:Click table, update line, hover over line, update table
@CONTENT:I'm new to D3, but loving it so far. But I know my solutions lack... elegance. I am trying to have 2 controls, a table and a graph displaying the data represented by the cells of the table. If you click on a cell on the table, the associated line should be highlighted. If you hover over a line the associate table cell will change color. Eventually there will be a third control showing detail data specific to that cel. Unfortunately I've only managed to make this work if I use static calls to the update function. If I try to be clever and dynamic the whole thing breaks. I've tried to minimize my example as much as I can below. The click table->update line works because the calls to SelectData() that updates everything uses constant data. However the mouseover on the lines doesn't work. Eventually I need the table to be more dynamic too, but for now, how do I fix this? <!DOCTYPE html>

 The mouseclick on the table effects the lines, the mouseover on the lines does not effect the table. Also I will accept any berating on my elegance and pointers to fixing them.

 I tried the above using 2 that did not work with and without the curly brackets, etc. I know some would say, well just do it the way it works? .. The problem is I am porting an exising application from an IIS Server using the sqlsrv_query library to a Linux server. All of the database calls in the app are written in functions that use this method: {call wcweb_UserInfo(?)} .. None of the parameter names are specified, so I would have to modify every database call to include the parameter names. I was under the impression that the PDO library for PHP5 can do those same kind of calls? Help! Is there something I am doing wrong or is it just that PDO can't make those kinds of calls?

@TITLE:Flip normals in three.js on sphere
@CONTENT:I have been searching around and haven't found any really good answer to my question yet.. The thing is that I have this sphere.. just a basic sphere, and I want to flip the normals so the sphere gets the sort of "hollow/carved effect" and then plater on apply my textures to the "inside" of the sphere. any ideas of how to flip the normals? Also.. if its not possible to do this in three.js.. would it be possible to import a model where the normals are already flipped and get the effect I'm looking for?

@TITLE:Evaluate item defined in msbuild task via C#
@CONTENT:I am trying to generate a directed graph (dot format) of targets that will be called with an MSBuild project file path as an input. This is same as grand-ui from ggtools.net (except that I'm trying for a read only image to start with). There are 3 cases that I wish to handle: 1) A target has the DependsOnTargets attribute 2) A target calls MSBuild using the Exec task 3) A target calls the MSBuild task and passes an ItemGroup I believe I have mostly handled #1 and #2 in the code below. However, I'm unable to figure out how to get a reference to the ItemGroup. Sample MSBuild project: <Project xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003" ToolsVersion="4.0" DefaultTargets="Build">
    <Target Name="Build" DependsOnTargets="PrepareEnvironmentForBuild;MapDrives">
        <Exec Command="$(MSBuildBinPath)\msbuild /nologo /clp:Verbosity=quiet $(MSBuildThisFileFullPath) /t:TargetWithConfidentialSteps"/>
        <ItemGroup>
            <StepsToRunInParallel Include="$(MSBuildThisFileFullPath)">
                <Properties>TargetToInvoke=ParallelTarget1</Properties>
            </StepsToRunInParallel>
            <StepsToRunInParallel Include="$(MSBuildThisFileFullPath)">
                <Properties>TargetToInvoke=ParallelTarget2</Properties>
            </StepsToRunInParallel>
        </ItemGroup>
        <MSBuild Projects="@(StepsToRunInParallel)" BuildInParallel="true" StopOnFirstFailure="true" Targets="InvokeInParallelWithinThisProject"/>

    </Target>
    <Target Name="InvokeInParallelWithinThisProject">
        <MSBuild Projects="$(MSBuildThisFileFullPath)" Targets="$(TargetToInvoke)" StopOnFirstFailure="true"/>
    </Target>
    <Target Name="ParallelTarget1">
        <Message Text="Hello from ParallelTarget1"/>
    </Target>
    <Target Name="ParallelTarget2">
        <Message Text="Hello from ParallelTarget2"/>
    </Target>
    <Target Name="PrepareEnvironmentForBuild">
        <Message Text="Hello from PrepareEnvironmentForBuild"/>
    </Target>
    <Target Name="MapDrives">

    </Target>
    <Target Name="TargetWithConfidentialSteps">
        <Message Text="Hush! Verbosity on the wrapper does not affect the Exec call." Importance="High"/>

 The problem is with the "Could not handle" section. What I'm trying to generate: digraph Build {
subgraph cluster_C__temp_proj {
Build->PrepareEnvironmentForBuild;
Build->MapDrives;
Build->TargetWithConfidentialSteps;
Build->InvokeInParallelWithinThisProject;
InvokeInParallelWithinThisProject->ParallelTarget1;
InvokeInParallelWithinThisProject->ParallelTarget2;
InvokeInParallelWithinThisProject;
ParallelTarget1;
ParallelTarget2;
PrepareEnvironmentForBuild;
MapDrives;
TargetWithConfidentialSteps;
}
}
 Can someone help me get a reference to ItemGroup "StepsToRunInParallel" from the above example? I also thought of registering a logger that would simply record: 1) Project file name to generate clusters/subgraphs 2) Target name And then consume the event without executing anything. Any ideas in that direction too are welcome.

@LINK:/questions/21445532/event-stoppropagation-not-working-in-firefox
@TITLE:event.stopPropagation Not Working in Firefox
@CONTENT:I am building a sidebar vertical menu that contains Main Menu items and one level of sub-menu items. I am using Javascript and CSS so that when the user clicks a top-level menu item, its sub-menu items will toggle their visibility - i.e. Click a main item and its sub items will appear. Click the main item again and the sub items disappear. To avoid the sub-menu from toggling when the user clicks a sub-menu item, I used the event.stopPropagation() method. The desired result works in Chrome, Safari, and Dolphin, but does not work in Firefox 26.0 nor Android Firefox 26.0.1. If you run this example (JSBin), you will notice that you can click Menu 2 and/or Menu 3 and a sub-menu will be displayed. That part is fine in all browsers. However, if you click a sub-menu item (i.e. Menu 3.1) in Firefox, the sub-menu will disappear - which is not the desired effect I want. If you click a sub-menu item in Chrome/Safari, the sub-menu stays visible - which is what I want to occur. I read on Mozilla Developer Network that the event.stopPropagation() is supported in Chrome, Firefox (Gecko), IE9, Opera, and Safari (WebKit). So, I'm confused as to why the stopProp method is not working in my case. Can you take a look at my JS example and tell me what's up? Here's the Javascript that I'm running (also at JSBIN): function goTo(id) {
     event.stopPropagation();
     location.href = id;
 }

 function toggleChildDisplay(parentElement) {
     var children = parentElement.children;
     var displayStyle = "";
     for (var i = 0; i < children.length; i++) {
         displayStyle = children[i].style.display;
         if (displayStyle.toLowerCase() === "none" || displayStyle === "") 
             children[i].style.display = "list-item";
         else 
             children[i].style.display = "none";
     }
}
 ... and here's the HTML: <ul class="level1">
    <li onclick="toggleChildDisplay(this)">Menu 1</li>
    <li onclick="toggleChildDisplay(this)">Menu 2
        <ul class="level2">
            <li onclick="goTo('#')">Menu 2.1</li>
            <li onclick="goTo('#')">Menu 2.2</li>
            <li onclick="goTo('#')">Menu 2.3</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li onclick="toggleChildDisplay(this)">Menu 3
        <ul class="level2">
            <li onclick="goTo('#')">Menu 3.1</li>
            <li onclick="goTo('#')">Menu 3.2</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
 P.S. The environment that I'm developing on will not allow me to use jQuery.

@TITLE:Start/stop youtube iframe when modal is shown/hidden through the api and Jquery events
@CONTENT:This is a bit of a repost, but none of the accepted answer uses the api in conjunction with JQuery events, if the do then the answer is incomplete. Past answer: Twitter Bootstrap Modal stop Youtube video I wonder how to to get a Youtube Iframe to start playing automatically, when a bootstrap modal is opened through a link. The video should stop playing when the modal is dismissed. I looked at many of the answers, but none shows me a next to complete answer. So how do you use JQuery events from bootstrap (show.bs.modal/hide.bs.modal) to start/stop the video?

@TITLE:Why does ByteArrayOutputStream use int?
@CONTENT:Maybe someone can help me understand because I feel I'm missing something that will likely have an effect on how my program runs. I'm using a ByteArrayOutputStream. Unless I've missed something huge, the point of this class is to create a byte[] array for some other use. However, the "plain" write function on BAOS takes an int not a byte (ByteArrayOutputStream.write). According to this(Primitive Data Types) page, in Java, an int is a 32-bit data type and a byte is an 8-bit data type. If I write this code... int i = 32;
byte b = i;
 I get a warning about possible lossy conversions requiring a change to this... int i = 32;
byte b = (byte)i;
 I'm really confused about write(int)...
@CODE:int i = 32;
byte b = i; int i = 32;
byte b = (byte)i; OutputStream.write ByteArrayOutputStream byte byte[] short

@CONTENT:Well I am stuck at a point where I need to distribute a value across multiple rows. Since I do not know the specific term, I would put it in the form of example below for better understanding: Assuming the value of x to be 20, I need to distribute/subtract it to rows in descending order. TABLE: ID        Value1 
1          6             
2          5
3          4
4          3
5          9
 Result should look like: (x=20) ID        Value1     Answer
1          6           14    
2          5           9
3          4           5
4          3           2
5          9           0
 Can anyone just give me an idea how I could go with this? I hope my question is clear enough. If not please let me know. Thanks. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

@TITLE:importing variable from module in python makes copy?
@CONTENT:It seems like doing from foo import i makes a copy of i rather than importing i into the current namespace. Is that possible? foo.py: i=0
 bar.py: import foo
from foo import i

foo.i = 999

print i
print foo.i
 This prints: 0
999
 but I expected it them both to be 999 (just aliases for the same memory as it were). What am I missing?

@CONTENT:i'm working on an assignment that i have to find the most four frequent characters in a string. i write this so far. import java.util.Scanner;

      String input;
      String example = "how to find the most frequent character in a big string using    java?";

      {
         int mostFrequent =0;

         for( int j = 0; j < example.length(); j++)

 Here is the output for this example. a is showing 5 times b is showing 1 times c is showing 2 times d is showing 1 times e is showing 4 times f is showing 2 times g is showing 3 times h is showing 3 times i is showing 5 times j is showing 1 times k is showing 0 times l is showing 0 times m is showing 1 times n is showing 5 times o is showing 3 times p is showing 0 times q is showing 1 times r is showing 4 times s is showing 3 times t is showing 6 times u is showing 2 times v is showing 1 times w is showing 1 times x is showing 0 times y is showing 0 times in this examle : t, a,i,n I DON"T NEED SOMEONE TO COMPLETE THE PROGRAM FOR ME, however i need some ideas how to find the most four frequent character in this example.

@CONTENT:Based on this question, though I felt this warranted its own question: Google pagedown AngularJS directive Following the example from this question, it seems to work, however I am running into issues when I try to append a directive to the page. Here is the code I have in the linking function:   scope.editor_id = null;

  if(attrs.id == null) {
    scope.editor_id = nextID++;
  } else {
    scope.editor_id = attrs.id;

  )(scope);


  element.find('.wmd-panel').append(editor_html);


  var editor = new Markdown.Editor(editor_converter, "-" + scope.editor_id);
  editor.run();
 However, when I append one of these to the document, I get the following error: TypeError: Cannot read property 'attachEvent' of null
 This error tends to crop up when the wmd-input is not present in the HTML. however, I am adding it with the $compile function, and it works on page load, but not when it is appended. What am I doing wrong here?

 so it looks as if this has nothing to do with eclipse messing things up, but the script misbehaving. edit: i just fired up msys, navigated to the same path eclipse suposedly does (2-environment-cd D:/work/ludum-dare/Debug), set the same parameters (except 5-enable-pretty-printing since gdb-python doesnt seem to know that setting) and finally sourced .gdbinit It didnt even wince at doing that. no errors at all. does anyone know how to find out what eclipse is trying to run when i click on debug? Also i just tried the "standard create process launcher" which at first went smoothly, but scrolling up in the traces console, i saw it simply skips over the errors encountered in the python file. edit: i just realized that not setting 5-enable-pretty-printing doesnt set _use_gdb_pp in printers.py, so it wont run the same way as in eclipse anyhow. I guess pretty printing is broken in mingw+eclipse cdt after following these steps: http://stackoverflow.com/a/14266862/3239702 i am facing the following output in eclipse: 610,711 2-environment-cd D:/work/ludum-dare/Debug

 i have searched the web for other people who have this problem but it looks like i got the jackpot. i got: Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers Version: Kepler Service Release 1 Build id: 20130919-0819 my mingw installer is all updated, and gdb-python27 is installed from: gdb-python-7.5.1-mingw32-bin.tar.lzma
 python 2.7.6 32bit User Environment Variables: PYTHONHOME = C:\Python27
PYTHONPATH = C:\Python27\Lib
PATH = c:\mingw\bin
 Global Environment Variables: contains much more, i only post the relevant part: PATH = C:\Python27\;
 edit: i just tried the python scripts from svn ( svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/trunk/libstdc++-v3/python ) of course i changed the path in my .gdbinit accordingly. the output in the "gdb traces" console is mostly the same, except for a couple of line numbers which differ, but the errors in those lines are identical, so i supose there just was some refactoring or something like that going on. and also my .gdbinit file as it is now. before the svn checkout, the commented line was used instead of line 4: python
import sys
# sys.path.insert(0, 'C:/MinGW/share/gcc-4.8.1/python')
sys.path.insert(0, 'D:/work/libstdc++-v3/python')
from libstdcxx.v6.printers import register_libstdcxx_printers
register_libstdcxx_printers (None)
end
 edit: tried to debug that printers.py script: i added some prints to the register_libstdcxx_printers function: def register_libstdcxx_printers (obj):
    "Register libstdc++ pretty-printers with objfile Obj."
    global _use_gdb_pp
    global libstdcxx_printer
    print("initialy obj: " + str(obj))
    print("_use_gdb_pp: " + str(_use_gdb_pp))
    if _use_gdb_pp:
        gdb.printing.register_pretty_printer(obj, libstdcxx_printer)
    else:
        if obj is None:
            obj = gdb
        obj.pretty_printers.append(libstdcxx_printer)
    print("after gdb.printing.register_pretty_printer(obj, libstdcxx_printer): obj: " + str(obj))
    register_type_printers(obj)
 the output of this is: 559,740 ~"initialy obj: None\n"
559,740 ~"_use_gdb_pp: True\n"
559,740 ~"after gdb.printing.register_pretty_printer(obj, libstdcxx_printer): obj: None\n"
 i cant really blame it to not find the attribute 'type_printers' on None, now can i? i suppose that None comes from line 6 in my .gdbinit : register_libstdcxx_printers (None)

@TITLE:Enforcing / Securing POST parameters
@CONTENT:My title is probably vague so please check my situation below. I have a web application to manage a list of employees. The application is set up in a hub-spoke pattern where clicking an employee from the employee list redirects to a new window showing the chosen employee's personal details for possible updates. The application uses HTTPS. The employee list and details are retrieved via GET while the details are updated via POST. The application uses HTTPS and all users (there are only a few of us) have the authority to retrieve and update employee details. My question is, will it still be required or suggested to check the employee ID (the primary key) during update/post operations? A sophisticated user can theoretically change the employee ID before the POST and update another employee's details even without pulling out the 2nd employee's record. Still, even if that user somehow fools the interface, any of his "hacks" would simply be acceptable since the user can retrieve and update any employee anyway. So in my case, would you still consider it necessary to enforce a mechanism so that only the currently shown record is updateable? If yes, what are the accepted practices for implementing this? Thanks

@TITLE:JS - Property Name Access
@CONTENT:I previously posted a version of this question (JS - Constructor referencing) and found out the answer within the duplicates, especially Access / process (nested) objects, arrays or JSON. From here, I'm still having a ridiculous amount of time getting this to work as intended. Given the following example code:     function f1(args) {
        this.defaults = {
            param1 : 100,
            param2 : 900;
        }
        this.ranges = {
            param1 : { min : 0, max : 500 },
            param2 : { min : 0, max : 1000 };
        }
        this.steps = {
            param1 : 50,
            param2 : 100;
        }
    var myF1 = new f1();
 I've read up on the previous duplicates and learning accessing the unknown property names by:     for (var propertyName in myF) {
        newName = propertyName;
    }
 What I need to do is cycle through the function (or any function) and build HTML5 range inputs for the function (keep in mind that the parameter names will be greatly different or random, so I assume I need to loop for the key itself. So, in the case of f1/myF1, the generated HTML5 would be:     param1: <input type="range" name="param1" min="0" max="500" steps="50" />
    param2: <input type="range" name="param2" min="0" max="1000" steps="100" />
 Note: The values for range=, name=, min=, max= and step= are all dynamically generated from the function's properties. I've tried looping for keys, calling for values and pretty much any other research and attempt I can, but I always end up with variables overwriting themselves and I'm guessing this is just more in the deep end than this amateur swimmer can figure out. Also, realize that each parameter will have a defaults, ranges and steps, so it is not like we have to worry about THAT level of randomization or variation. Thank you SO-JS gurus!

 I've really no clue where I should start with this one. I don't know how to call this so searching for it is difficult. I think I need to split up my problem in 2 - ordering the items so they go in the flow like in the scheme.
- scrolling horizontally.

I have relatively large dataset (daily weather data for several hundreds stations) I did some sliding window average calculation and I got the intermediate output like this. data frame of 10481441 row by 11 column but my row names are consist of series of numbers with identifiable prefix. For example, X1.1
X1.2
X1.3
...
X1.11659
X2.1
X2.2
X2.3
...
X2.11659
X3.1
...
X899.11659
 Then what I want to do is get mean values of 11 columns by same prefix of row numbers For example: for 11 columns mean(X1.1,X2.1,X3.1,...X899.1) (X1.2,X2.2,X3.2,...X899.2) and thus expect to have a output table as 899 set of 11659 row by 11 column I got some help here to have jumping average at n-th row when I have as.Date row names but wasn't able to modify the desired format to run. I appreciate your time.
@CODE:10481441 row 11 column X1.1
X1.2
X1.3
...
X1.11659
X2.1
X2.2
X2.3
...
X2.11659
X3.1
...
X899.11659 11 columns 11 columns mean(X1.1,X2.1,X3.1,...X899.1) (X1.2,X2.2,X3.2,...X899.2) 899 11659 row 11 column as.Date

@TITLE:Can I write a javascript file that optionally uses require.js to specifies dependencies when it is available?
@CONTENT:I need to write a javascript plugin that can be used both as an AMD module and as a non-AMD (synchronously loaded) javascript file. It has a dependency on the "Jockey.js" and jquery libraries. In other words, I'd like to structure the file so that it doesn't fail when its used in a traditional non-async html structure (loaded via a script tag, after its dependencies are loaded via script tags), but so that it will also be able to work as an AMD module without shim, and specify its dependencies. Can this be done, or is shim the only way to do this?

@CONTENT:The below code won't work, I wanted to know how I can dynamically cast an instance to a type determined at runtime? Convert.ChangeType() returns an Object that still needs to be cast. So does all attempts to Invoke() a GetConstructor() or Activator.CreateInstance(), see below. At some point I need to explicitly cast in code, I'm hoping to avoid it or push it out as far as possible. Type type = Type.GetType ("RandomChildClass");
Object obj = Activator.CreateInstance (type, new Object[]{ "argument" });
var instance = (type)obj;
 I know I can create a method to accept < T >, but I'd still have the same problem of not knowing how to call it with a dynamic random type Casting a variable using a Type variable

 Data is populating perfectly fine. Now, i want users to select a value. As is mentioned in Github, i tried this: Try adding ignore: '', in the line directly above rules:.

});
 But they both are not working for me. What is the proper way of doing this?

@CONTENT:I am very new to JavaScript and trying to learn to do some functional things. I'm trying to get more comfortable with arrays. In this, I want the onClick in the HTML to cycle to EACH array value (color) and style the <p> with each one. Currently it just goes to the end, and I understand why it does that, but I don't know how to produce the result I want. My (relevant) HTML: <p id="pg">Hi, this is a string of text.</p>

        x=document.getElementById("pg"); // Find the element
        x.style.color=colors[i];          // Change the style
    }
}
 Should I even use loops for this? Thank you for any help.

@TITLE:Registration-free Interop between a 64-bit COM dll and a C#/.Net application
@CONTENT:I am trying to get registration-free COM interop between a 64-bit COM dll and a C# app to work. In the answers to a previous question of mine, I got help that allowed me to successfully call a HelloWorld method on the 64-bit COM dll for C#. However, this was only possible by registering the COM dll globally using regsrv32.exe. Based on this answer to a related question, I think that I need to set the Isolated flag on the reference of the COM dll to true. However, this leads to the following build error: Problem isolating COM reference 'ComLibInteropLib': 
    No registered classes were detected for this component.
 The answer to a question on MSDN social seems to indicate that there is a solution for this problem if one can compile a 32-bit version of the dll. However, my COM interop library needs to link to a 'normal' C++ dll, for which I do not have the source and that is only available as x64. So my question is: How can I enable the Isolated flag (or otherwise get side-by-side to work) between a 64-bit COM dll and a C# application? I am happy to use regsrv32.exe on my machine or other developer's machine, but we cannot register any COM dlls on production machines, where the final application must run.

@LINK:/questions/21329668/jumping-from-one-firmware-to-another-in-mcu-internal-flash
@TITLE:Jumping from one firmware to another in MCU internal FLASH
@CONTENT:I am currently working on a bootloader firmware application targeted to STM32F030C8. I specified in my scatter file that the bootloader app will occupy main memory location 0x08000000 to 0x08002FFF (sector 0 to sector 2). I also wrote a main firmware application that is stored from 0x08003000 to 0x0800C800. After downloading both firmware to the MCU internal FLASH, I lauched the main app from the bootloader using the code below: /************************************************************//**
* \brief Start the main application if available and correct
*****************************************************************/
void INTFLASH_execute_main_app(const char mode)
{
  MyFunc_ptr AppEntry;
  uint32_t temp[1];
  IRQn_Type index;

  memcpy(temp, (void*)&NVIC->ISER, sizeof(NVIC->ISER));  //Save enabled interrupts

  for( index = (IRQn_Type)0; index<= (IRQn_Type)28; index++) //Disable all interrupts
    NVIC_DisableIRQ(index);

  AppEntry = (MyFunc_ptr) INTFLASH_calculate_page_addr(IAP_APP_START_PAGE);

  if( mode || intflash_check_main_app() )
  {
    Main_App_ptr = (uint8_t*)AppEntry;
    if( (*Main_App_ptr != 0xFF) &&  (Main_App_ptr) )
    {
      AppEntry();
    }
  }           
  memcpy( (void*)&NVIC->ISER, temp, sizeof(NVIC->ISER) ); //Restore interrupts
}
 For some reason, when it executes AppEntry(), it jumps to the code below and does not execute the main app at location 0x08003000: HardFault_Handler\
                PROC
                EXPORT  HardFault_Handler              [WEAK]
                B       .
                ENDP
 I have used this sort of logic before on ARM7 MCU and it works fine, I cannot quite figure out why it doesnt work on this cortex M0 based MCU. Any help would be greatly appreciated. See Scatter files for bootloader and main app below: LR_IROM1 0x08000000 0x00003000  {    ; load region size_region

@TITLE:RequireJS modules referencing each other
@CONTENT:Im using requirejs to load several modules of a web app im building but am struggling to understand something. I have my main module requiring it dependancies but the other defined modules all reference each other in someway. so lets say the 'project/func' module may call a save function in the 'project/save' module. Now most of my code has resulted in undefined being errored. From reading online maybe Ive hit something known as a circular reference?? Im not quite sure. I guess I need to know what Im doing wrong and how I should be doing it. Ive tried to put an example below with the main file calling the bootstrap method in one of the modules but that module calls another module at some point. This is just a small example. the real app has many many more modules and they all need to run functions inside each others if that makes sense. //main require

    proFunc.bootstrap();

NOTE: I do not want to use DatabaseMetadata and its getPrimaryKeys() function as it will take an additonal hit into External Database. Also, the ResultSetMetadata object is already having the primary key Information which i just need to fetch.

@TITLE:SQL: Query Entire Schema for Specific Value and Return Table Names
@CONTENT:more adventures of my having to embed SQL in VBA code to get info from the company's database... Our database has probably a couple thousand database tables, so if you are looking for something in-particular, you have to do a lot of poking around (especially if the name of the table isn't as intuitive as something like "ITEMS"). I had a general idea of what the column header I was looking for was called, and came across this code to find it: SELECT DISTINCT TABLE_NAME
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'DATABASE'
AND COLUMN_NAME LIKE '%MFGR%';
 This returned the names of all the tables with columns containing %MFGR%... Found the table I needed pretty quick.... much quicker than arbitrarily importing tables that look like they might be it. Anyway, what would be better is to have a query that returned the names of all the tables containing a certain value in any column. Usually I have no clue what the column is named, but know what one of the values is. I just want to know what tables contain it so I can look at them. This kept coming up as a result: http://vyaskn.tripod.com/search_all_columns_in_all_tables.htm Sounds like it will probably work, but is there a simpler way? I haven't tried putting it into VBA code yet. EDIT: Looking at the code, it looks like it involves manipulating the database (creating procedures, creating tables, etc.) which I don't have the access to do. Anyway to do this just as a query?

 The panel is added to a JFrame that is made visible prior to calling panel.draw(). This approach is not working for me and, although I already know how to paint custom components by inheriting from JPanel and overriding public void paintComponent(Graphics g), I did not want to inherit from JPanel.
@CODE:single inheritance paint JPanel Panel Graphics JComponent JPanel getGraphics() this public void paintComponent(Graphics g) private class Panel

      private JPanel panel;
      private Grahics g;

      public Panel()
      {
           panel = new JPanel();
      }

      public void draw()
      {
           g = panel.getGraphics();
           g.setColor(Color.CYAN);
           g.draw(Some Component);
           panel.repaint();
      }
} JFrame panel.draw() JPanel public void paintComponent(Graphics g) JPanel getGraphics

@TITLE:Python - Strange behavior with dicts in list [duplicate]
@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: Python list multiplication: [[K]]*3 makes 3 lists which mirror each other when modified [duplicate] 4 answers Python initializing a list of lists [duplicate] 1 answer I just noticed some strange behavior with dicts in lists while using python. For example I have this code: n_of_elems = 2
n_of_dicts = 3

lst = [{'foo': [0] * n_of_elems, 'bar': [0] * n_of_elems}] * n_of_dicts

print(lst)
 The first print statement gives me the expected empty list: [{'foo': [0, 0], 'bar': [0, 0]}, {'foo': [0, 0], 'bar': [0, 0]}, {'foo': [0, 0], 'bar': [0, 0]}] But if i start to fill some elements with values in the lists within the dicts, like this... lst[0]['foo'][0] = 23
lst[0]['bar'][-1] = 42

print(lst)
 ... I get a rather unexpected result ... [{'foo': [23, 0], 'bar': [0, 42]}, {'foo': [23, 0], 'bar': [0, 42]}, {'foo': [23, 0], 'bar': [0, 42]}] ... instead of the expected: [{'foo': [23, 0], 'bar': [0, 42]}, {'foo': [0, 0], 'bar': [0, 0]}, {'foo': [0, 0], 'bar': [0, 0]}] Why is this, and how can I solve this? This happens both using python2 and python3 Thank you in advance for your help and knowledge.
@CODE:n_of_elems = 2

@TITLE:Read csv file with hidden or invisible character ^M
@CONTENT:I am attempting unsuccessfully to read a *.csv file containing hidden or invisible characters. The file contents are shown here: my.data2 <- read.table(text = '

Brent.Goose, Branta.bernicla, AAC, rr
', header = TRUE, sep=',', stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
 Note that the above read.table command reads the data correctly. However, read.csv cannot read the file correctly because in many lines there is a hidden character following the second blank space. In some lines there is also a hidden character after the first blank space. In some lines there are no hidden characters. For example: setwd('c:/users/mmiller21/simple R programs')

my.data <- read.csv('invisible.delimiter2.csv', header = TRUE)
my.data
 returns:             Common.name    Scientific.name Stuff1 Stuff2

 More specifically, if I open the *.csv file in Notepad and use the right-arrow key to move the cursor along the first line of data I have to press the right-arrow key twice to move past the first A in AAC. The following line does not solve the problem: my.data <- read.csv('invisible.delimiter2.csv', sep=',', header = TRUE)
 In my experience tabs are a fairly common hidden character or delimiter. However, I have tried searching for and replacing tabs and that does not help. I have also tried converting the *.csv file to a *.txt file, but that returns the following: > my.data3 <- read.table('invisible.delimiter2.txt', sep=',', header = TRUE)
Error in scan(file, what, nmax, sep, dec, quote, skip, nlines, na.strings,  : 
  line 1 did not have 4 elements
> my.data3
Error: object 'my.data3' not found
 I am not familiar with other possible solutions. The file is too large to manually search every space for a hidden character and remove it. Thank you for any advice on how to read a file like this or on how to find and remove hidden characters prior to reading the file into R. If it helps, I originally obtained the data by copying a table from Wikipedia. Perhaps that might help identify the hidden character. EDIT Thanks to comments below I opened the example data file using gVim 7.3. That software displays the hidden character and reveals it to be ^M. Unfortunately, I have not been able to remove that character from the data file with a simple find and replace within gVim 7.3. If and when I figure out how to remove the ^M I will post the approach here. Here is a post on how to remove ^M with Perl. In Perl, how to do you remove ^M from a file? Hopefully I can figure out how to remove it with R or a text editor Here is a link where the example *.csv file is stored. https://github.com/markwmiller/Rcode/blob/93d07bd2e389e516b6da92017e025a1e97173db0/invisible.delimiter2.csv and an alternative link to the same file on the same site: https://github.com/markwmiller/Rcode

@TITLE:Cycling through all variables
@CONTENT:I started to learn SAS here fairly recently and am getting the basics down pretty well, but have a question regarding something that is a little outside of my current realm of knowledge. Does anyone happen to know of a way to cycle through all variables in a SAS dataset? I know how to run a do loop/array on variables in a range (x1-x99), but ideally would like to look at every variable without having to rename any variables. Basically, I'm looking to run through a dataset and change variable values when the current value = 'True'/'False'. My guess is that I'll need to use proc contents in someway here, but not really sure how to go about using it correctly. Any tips/insight would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

 Nhibernate loads the relations as I intended. But two parts of the Mapping seem a bit weird (either that or my expectations are weird). First:  CostStructure structure = new CostStructure() { CardTemplate = template };
 template.CostStructures.Add(structure);
 Session.Save(template);
 Session.Flush();
 This does not save the new CostStructure instance. Why? Second one: Assuming I have loaded a CardTemplate having a CostStructure containing three CostStructureComponent entities. Now I want to remove one of those CostStructureComponents from the CostStructure. I tried the following : costStructure.CostComponents.Remove(component);
component.CostStructure = null;
session.Save(template)
 Now, I know that explicitly deleting explicitly works, but shouldn't the DeleteOrphan part also assert that the component, now without CostStructure to reference, is deleted? Instead, NHibernate tries to perform the following update: UPDATE CostStructureComponent 
SET amount = @p0, 
     coststructure_id = @p1, 
     resourcetype_id = @p2
WHERE id = @p3;

@p0 = 1 [Type: Int32 (0)], 
@p1 = NULL [Type: Int64 (0)], 
@p2 = 5 [Type: Int64 (0)], 
@p3 = 13 [Type: Int64 (0)]
 Could it be Equals / GetHashCode have been implemented the wrong way? Sorry, it's late, been a long day and so forth...If I'm talking gibberish, please let me know...

 This code is giving me an output like this on my xml file: <?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8' standalone='yes' ?>
<root>
  <code>ACT445</code>
  <price>110.00</price>
  <quantity>4</quantity>
  <totalcost>440.0</totalcost>
</root><root><code>ACT430</code><price>110.00</price><quantity>5</quantity><totalcost>550.0</totalcost></root>
 where as I want the output xml file to be like this: <?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8' standalone='yes' ?>
    <root>
      <code>ACT445</code>
      <price>110.00</price>
      <quantity>4</quantity>
      <totalcost>440.0</totalcost>

      <code>ACT430</code>
      <price>110.00</price>
      <quantity>5</quantity>
      <totalcost>550.0</totalcost>
    </root>
 Please suggest changes I need to make to get the output the way I want above. Any help will be appreciated. Thanks in advance. *****************UPDATE***************** After making changes the way Sandster mentioned. Now it can easily enter two entries to the xml without a problem. But when I try to write the third entry it gets written with some extra character like this: <?xml version='1.0' standalone='yes' ?>
<root>
  <item>
    <code>ACT358</code>
    <price>110.00</price>
    <quantity>3</quantity>
    <totalcost>330.0</totalcost>
  </item>

<item>
  <code>ACT443</code>
  <price>110.00</price>
  <quantity>5</quantity>
  <totalcost>550.0</totalcost>
</item>
<
<item>
  <code>ACT388</code>
  <price>110.00</price>
  <quantity>4</quantity>
  <totalcost>440.0</totalcost>
</item>
</root>
 As you see after the second time there is an extra < thats get written. I cant seem to find out as to why. My new code is as follows: public class SingleItemView extends Activity {

    String utcost;
    String desc;

    String flag;
    String toolscat;
    String tan;
    int number;
    String numberOfItems;

    Bitmap bmImg = null;
    ImageView addToCartButton;
    final Context context = this;

        // Get the view from singleitemview.xml
        setContentView(R.layout.singleitemview);
        // Execute loadSingleView AsyncTask
        toolscat=getIntent().getExtras().getString("toolscat");
        tan=getIntent().getExtras().getString("tan");
        new loadSingleView().execute();

        if (!newxmlfile.exists()){
            try{
                newxmlfile.createNewFile();
            }catch(IOException e){

@TITLE:Sorting People into Groups based on Votes
@CONTENT:I have a problem with finding a algorithm for sorting a dataset of people. I try to explain as detailed as possible: The story starts with a survey. A bunch of people, lets say 600 can choose between 20-25 projects. They make a #1-wish, #2-wish and #3-wish, where #1 is the most wanted project they want to take part and wish 3 the "not-perfect-but-most-acceptable-choose". These project are limited in their number of participants. Every project can join around 30 people (based on the number of people and count of projects). The algorithm puts the people in the different projects and should find the best possible combination. The problem is that you can't just put all the people with their number 1 wish X in the certain project and stuff all the other with also number 1 wish X in there number 2 wish because that would not be the most "happiest" situation for everybody. You may can think of what I mean when you imagine that for everybody who get his number 1 wish you get 100 points, for everybody who get his number 2 wish 60 points, number 3 wish 30 points and who get not in one of his wishes 0 points. And you want to get as most points as possible. I hope you get my problem. This is for a school-project day. Is there something out there that could help me? Do you have any idea? I would be thankful for every tipp!! Kind regards

@TITLE:Threads: Busy Waiting - Empty While-Loop [duplicate]
@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: Is this starvation? 2 answers During our lessons in the university, we learned about Threads and used the "Busy Waiting" method for an example of a Car waiting at a TrafficLight. For this task we build three classes: TrafficLight (implements Runnable) Car (implements Runnable) Main In our Main class we start two Threads, one of Car, and one of TrafficLight. The Car has the boolean attribute hasToWait. The run() method in this class works the way, that it works through a while loop as long as hasToWait == true. To change this, we have the notifyCar() method in the Car class, which is used by the TrafficLight. The run() method in TrafficLight runs through a Thread.sleep() to simulate a certain time of waiting. Everything works fine at my Prof's but eventually I have serious problems with it. As long as the while loop in the Car class is empty. When I put in a System.out.println() - which is not empty, it works. But if the Syso is empty, the result is no displaying of the Text of the Run method. Also it's working when the Thread.sleep() in TrafficLight is 0. Than it works with an empty while loop. Here is my code: Car.java: package trafficlight;

public class Car implements Runnable {

    private boolean hasToWait = true;

    public void run() {
        this.crossTrafficLight();
    }

    public void crossTrafficLight() {
        while(hasToWait){ for(int i = 0; i<20; i++){System.out.println("123");}} // Busy waiting
        System.out.println("Auto f?hrt ?ber Ampel");
    }

    public void notifyCar() {
        this.hasToWait = false;
        System.out.println("Test");
    }
}
 TrafficLight.java: package trafficlight;

public class TrafficLight implements Runnable {
    private Car car;

    public TrafficLight(Car car) {
        this.car = car;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        try {
            Thread.sleep(100);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        this.car.notifyCar();
    }
}
 Main.java: package trafficlight;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args){
        Car car = new Car();
        TrafficLight tl = new TrafficLight(car);

        new Thread(car).start();
        new Thread(tl).start();
    }

}
 Where is the problem? Why does it work at my profs but not at my computer? I got the code 1:1 in my Eclipse Juno, using JRE 1.7
@CODE:Threads Car TrafficLight TrafficLight (implements Runnable) Car (implements Runnable) Main Main Thread Car TrafficLight Car hasToWait run() while hasToWait == true notifyCar() Car TrafficLight run() TrafficLight Thread.sleep() while Car System.out.println() Run Thread.sleep() TrafficLight 0 while package trafficlight;

public class Car implements Runnable {

    private boolean hasToWait = true;

    public void run() {
        this.crossTrafficLight();
    }

    public void crossTrafficLight() {
        while(hasToWait){ for(int i = 0; i<20; i++){System.out.println("123");}} // Busy waiting
        System.out.println("Auto f?hrt ?ber Ampel");
    }

    public void notifyCar() {
        this.hasToWait = false;
        System.out.println("Test");
    }
} package trafficlight;

public class TrafficLight implements Runnable {

        }

 And at this time the when i refresh the Adapter using notifydatasetChanged() without changing data, the ViewHolder that i get by calling getTag() was returning wrong tags. It was working like If the position is 1 the holder object was of the view at position 0. ie; the previous object was returned.. Atlast I found a post which is not the same but with the same method and the solution works for me .. I don't know how .. The Solution was setting the width of ListView to MATCH_PARENT in xml, In the post it was height. Does any one know , What is the reason for such a behaviour ? There is no logic that i can find behind this issue

 I need to capture these databse errors and just show messages like say The item you are trying to delete is associated with other records 
 How do we deal with this. i have found a refernce here : http://stackoverflow.com/a/8842963/576523 but i dont want to do a count check. When we use the debug_kit plugin we can see that they have captured these values under the variables tab. I need a way to do this or access these data from the debug_kit plugin. Thankz.

// Bind Event Listeners
bindEvents: function() {

    document.addEventListener('deviceready', this.onDeviceReady, false);

onDeviceReady: function() {

    var pushNotification = window.plugins.pushNotification;
    pushNotification.register(app.tokenHandler,app.errorHandler,{"badge":"true","sound":"true","alert":"true","ecb":"app.onNotificationAPN"});

},


errorHandler:function(error) { 
    //alert('in errorHandler');
    //alert(error);
},

 * For iOS
 */        
tokenHandler:function(status) {

    //save the status to server

},


onNotificationAPN: function(event) {

//display alert

},

};
 In tokenHandler, I want to call a model I have defined as a Require.js module. So, I integrated index.js with Require.js. Index.html became this: <script type="text/javascript" src="cordova.js"></script> 
<script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="PushNotification.js"></script>

<script data-main="js/app" src="js/require.js"></script>
 The index.js file now looks like this: define(function (require) {

var app = {
    // Application Constructor
    initialize: function() {
    this.bindEvents();
    },


    // Bind Event Listeners
    bindEvents: function() {

    document.addEventListener('deviceready', this.onDeviceReady, false);
    },


    onDeviceReady: function() {

    var pushNotification = window.plugins.pushNotification;
    pushNotification.register(app.tokenHandler,app.errorHandler,{"badge":"true","sound":"true","alert":"true","ecb":"app.onNotificationAPN"});

    },


    errorHandler:function(error) { 
    //alert('in errorHandler');
    //alert(error);
    },

    /*
     * 
     * For iOS
     */        
    tokenHandler:function(status) {

        //save the status to server

    },


    onNotificationAPN: function(event) {

    //display alert

    },

};

return app;
});
 The in app.js, I do: ... ... ... require(['jquery', 'backbone', 'app/router', 'app/index'], function ($, Backbone, Router, Index) {

var router = new Router();
Index.initialize();

Backbone.history.start();

});
 The problem occurs in the callback to pushNotification.register(), which is app.onNotificationAPN. With the loading of the index.js as a Require module, this leads to an error: processMessage failed: Error
 When i user an anonymous function in place of the call to app.onNotificationAPN, I also get the same error. What should the correct callback be?
@CODE:<script type="text/javascript" src="cordova.js"></script> 
<script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="PushNotification.js"></script>

<script type="text/javascript" src="js/app/index.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">

@TITLE:Draw a path with variable width in iOS
@CONTENT:I am working on a writing application, My writing is working fine, but what I want to implement is variable stroke width, so that the writing is very realistic and intuitive, as done by "BAMBOO" and "PENULTIMATE" application. Firstly I want to tell you what I have tried. 1) In iOS, their is no pressure detection, or velocity detection according to my research. For velocity detection, I have to use OPENGL. 2) Due to these limitations, I tried using the method given in this tutorial which is pretty straight forward.Here is the link http://mobile.tutsplus.com/tutorials/iphone/ios-sdk-advanced-freehand-drawing-techniques/ 3) This works fine, But here what happens is that, the width increases as I move faster and decreases, as I move slower. But I want is the opposite effect, that is the width should increase as I move slower and when I move fast, the thickness should only be seen only at the edges and for the whole line. Here are the screenshot of the BAMBOO app and my app. 1)BAMBOO app In the above image, the line is drawn with speed and you will see that the thickness is only at edges. 2) MY APP Here you will see that the line is thinner at edges and thick every where else. So, here are my doubts 1) Is their any better approach to fulfil my requirement, other than what I have tried. 2) If what I have tried, is correct approach to tackle the problem, then what changes I need to make to achieve the desired effect.

@LINK:/questions/21273437/adding-constructor-to-boost-python-subclass-causes-argument-mismatch-error
@TITLE:Adding constructor to Boost.Python subclass causes argument mismatch error
@CONTENT:I'm trying to use Python as a scripting language for a C++ project of mine, so I reached for Boost.Python to make the task less tedious. I have a C++ class (ScriptSystem) which is responsible for holding references to and executing Python scripts. namespace py = boost::python;

class ScriptSystem : public System
{
    public:
    virtual void execute_scripts() override;

    void addToPyGlobals(const OtherSystemsPtr&);
    void addScript(IScript*);

    private:
    std::vector<IScript *> scripts;
    py::dict python_globals;        
};
 The Python scripts are supposed to be subclasses of a wrapped C++ interface named IScript. class IScript
{
    public:
    virtual ~IScript() {}

    // This function is meant to be overridden. It prints
    // to the console for debugging purposes only.
    virtual void tick() const {
        cout << "Default Implementation." << endl;
    }
};
 I managed to expose the ScriptSystem class and the IScript interface to Python, and it almost sorta kinda works. I can create new instances of IScript and pass them to ScriptSystem without any trouble. I can create subclasses which override tick(self) and as long as they don't define a constructor I'm good to go. namespace py = boost::python;

class ScriptWrapper : public Script::IScript, public py::wrapper<Script::IScript>
{
    public:
    void tick()const override
    {
        // Check for Python override
        if(py::override f = this->get_override("tick")) {
            std::cout << "Found Python override"
                      << std::endl;
            f();
            return;
        }

        // If there is no override, call the default implementation
        std::cout << "No Python override found, calling C++ implementation." 
                  << std::endl;
        this->Script::IScript::tick();
        return;
    }

    void default_tick() const {
        return this->Script::IScript::tick();
    }
};


BOOST_PYTHON_MODULE(_script)
{
    py::class_<ScriptSystem, boost::noncopyable>("ScriptSystem")
        .def("add_script", &ScriptSystem::addScript);

    py::class_<ScriptWrapper, boost::noncopyable>("Script")
        .def("tick", &Script::IScript::tick, &ScriptWrapper::default_tick);

    py::implicitly_convertible<ScriptWrapper*, Script::IScript*>();
}
 I can add data attributes to the class, but adding __init__(self) causes problems. For example, this code snippet executes just fine: (RemoteShell)
>>> from script import Script
>>> class One(Script):
...     def tick(self):
...             print "I'm a script!"
...             print "My value is {}".format(One.value)
... 
>>> One.value = 5
>>> one = One()              
>>> script_system.add_script(one)
 But this code fails: (RemoteShell)
>>> from script import Script
>>> class Two(Script):
...     def __init__(self):
...             self.count = 0
...     def tick(self):
...             if self.count % 2 == 0:
...                     print "Tick"
...             else:
...                     print "Tock"
...             self.count += 1
... 
>>> two = Two()
>>> script_system.add_script(two)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<console>", line 1, in <module>
ArgumentError: Python argument types in
    ScriptSystem.add_script(ScriptSystem, Two)
did not match C++ signature:
    add_script(ScriptSystem {lvalue}, Script::IScript*)
 So, I guess my question is: What is happening here?! I don't understand why adding a constructor to a Python subclass of Script (the python wrapper for IScript) causes an argument mismatch error.

@TITLE:Cross Compiling Linux Arm Kernel with new driver module
@CONTENT:I am trying to include a driver for use on my arch linux arm machine. I tried using these steps to include the driver module, but my cross-compiled kernel with the added driver doesn't load. 1) Include the driver I want to add by making it have < M > beside it's 
   name in make ARCH=arm menuconfig

2) run: make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=/home/z3/bin/arm-   (the path for my cross-compiling toolchain)

3) run: make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=/home/z3/bin/arm- modules

4) run: make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=/home/z3/bin/arm- install

5) run: make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=/home/z3/bin/arm- modules_install

6) copy my uImage from: arch/arm/boot 
   to my boot location: /tftpboot/
 Then when my embedded linux arm tries to load the kernel uImage, it hangs with: EDIT: Changed the entry point address to 80008000, so now it hangs with: Filename '/tftpboot/uImage'.

@TITLE:PHP $_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME'] is wrong when loading PHP via mod_fcgid
@CONTENT:I'm using Apache 2.4.7 and PHP 5.5.7. I have a test.php file in C:\web\vhosts\Symfony\web. The value of $_SERVER['SCRIPT_FILENAME'] is correct: C:/web/vhosts/Symfony/web/test.php
 However the value of $_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME'] depends on how I load PHP: If I load PHP as an Apache module, the value of $_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME'] is: /test.php
 I'm a bit surprised that it isn't the same as SCRIPT_FILENAME, but at least it's a correct value, I guess. Here's how I loaded PHP: LoadModule php5_module "C:/web/php-5.5.7-Win32-VC11-x86/php5apache2_4.dll"
AddHandler application/x-httpd-php .php 
PHPIniDir "C:/web/php-5.5.7-Win32-VC11-x86"
 If I load PHP using mod_fcgid, the value of $_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME'] is: C:/test.php
 Which is just wrong... Here's how I loaded PHP (based on a tutorial from ApacheLounge): LoadModule fcgid_module modules/mod_fcgid.so

 Why is it so? I have declared the character array of length 4 ( char a[4] ). Please explain. Does this mean the character array is dynamic?
@CODE:#include<stdio.h>

int main()
{
char a[4];
printf("Enter the name : ");
gets(a);

printf("\nThe name enterd is : %s",a);
printf("\nLength of string is : %d",strlen(a));

getch();
return 0;
} Enter the name : melwinsunny

The name entered is : melwinsunny

length of string is : 11 int i1=5; char a[4]; int i2=6; printf("i1, i2 are %i, %i\n", i1, i2); gets(a); printf("i1, i2, a are %i, %i, %s\n", i1, i2, a);

@TITLE:Download data when internet connectivity is detected
@CONTENT:I want to download some data including json and image(binary data) whenever internet connectivity is available. I have a full working code which can do that. The problem is I have written that code in custom application class. which downloads it and saves locally.But when app is launched the internet connectivity may not be available at that point of time. So what I want to do is send the request and download the data whenever internet connectivity is detected and use that data by saving it in content provider locally. And the app will work even without an internet connection. I am thinking of using broadcast receiver to download the same. But then it will be heavy task for a broadcast receiver to download the data. So now what I am finding out is I can check out internet connectivity in broadcast receiver and I will download the data from some other component. Which is the best practice to do so? Is broadcast receiver stays around even when application is not on?

@TITLE:instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier in xcode 5
@CONTENT:I'm working on a storyboard in xcode 5. I have a navigation controller, and am trying to establish the transitions to other scenes in my storyboard. I first tried using: - (IBAction)handleTap:(UITapGestureRecognizer *)sender {
NSLog(@"Image clicked");

_detailPage = [[MPDetailPageViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"MPDetailPageViewController" bundle:nil];
_detailPage.product = _curProduct;

//Bring to detail page
[self.navigationController pushViewController:self.detailPage animated:YES];
}
 This would bring me to a black screen. Searching on stackoverflow I found this post from Feb 2013 which suggested using instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier So I tried: - (IBAction)handleTap:(UITapGestureRecognizer *)sender {
NSLog(@"Image clicked");

_detailPage = [self.storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@"MPDetailPageViewController"];
_detailPage.product = _curProduct;

//Bring to detail page
[self.navigationController pushViewController:self.detailPage animated:YES];
}
 However, this gave me an error Storyboard () doesn't contain a view controller with identifier 'MPDetailPageViewController' I tried figuring out how to find/ set the identifier and saw posts referencing Storyboard ID, but when I look on my screen I only see Restoration ID and I can only see that when I click on the View and not the ViewController itself. When I click on the ViewController, I don't see Restoration ID nor Storyboard ID Any help would be greatly appreciated!
@CODE:- (IBAction)handleTap:(UITapGestureRecognizer *)sender {
NSLog(@"Image clicked");

_detailPage = [[MPDetailPageViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"MPDetailPageViewController" bundle:nil];
_detailPage.product = _curProduct;

//Bring to detail page
[self.navigationController pushViewController:self.detailPage animated:YES];
} instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier - (IBAction)handleTap:(UITapGestureRecognizer *)sender {

@TITLE:What replaces the now-deprecated Carbon.File.FSResolveAliasFile in Python on OSX?
@CONTENT:In Python 2, I can use the following code to resolve either a MacOS alias or a symbolic link: from Carbon import File
File.FSResolveAliasFile(alias_fp, True)[0].as_pathname()
 where alias_fp is the path to the file I'm curious about, stored as a string (source). However, the documentation cheerfully tells me that the whole Carbon family of modules is deprecated. What should I be using instead? EDIT: I believe the code below is a step in the right direction for the PyObjC approach. It doesn't resolve aliases, but it seems to detect them. from AppKit import NSWorkspace
def is_alias (path):
    uti, err = NSWorkspace.sharedWorkspace().typeOfFile_error_(
        os.path.realpath(path), None)

 (source) Unfortunately I'm not able to get @Milliways's solution working (knowing nothing about Cocoa) and stuff I find elsewhere on the internet looks far more complicated (perhaps it's handling all kinds of edge cases?).

 like thisG IEApp.Document.getElementById("profile_content").getElementByTagName("a").Item(1) 
 but I got an error something like unsupported method. What I can do is just to get the element by id in vbscript. I haven't found anything valued for solving my question. So I'm here. I've already asked a similar question which is put on hold. My reputation has been decreased by 2 for that. I cannot believe there's no one can help me. Thanks

@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: Why is it frowned upon to use a null layout in Swing? 4 answers Bonjour. Upon spending countless hours around this site looking for code to drag a component around the screen, I noticed an odd trend growing in the answers. ...being that everyone shudders at the sound of the null layout. So I ask, what's the problem everyone has with it? I've been coding for no more than three months, using Swing for no more than one, and the layout has been a breeze to use with endless customisation possible. Why is it bad practice?

@CONTENT:Hi! I am trying to write a program where I need to report the position of every mouse motion. I have called the XSelectInput() function with a PointerMotionMask mask. Everything seems to work alright but the numbers after printing don't appear after every movement, they appear in blocks and also the numbers in event.xmotion.x and event.xmotion.y are very high, in the hundred thousands.

@TITLE:Android: EditText focus jumps to another inside ScrollView
@CONTENT:I have multiple fragments horizontally adjacent using a ViewPager. Each fragment has a ScrollView that contains a table with many EditText views. When I click on a EditText, it gains focus and then loses it to some other EditText in the leftmost fragment. Sometimes the focus switch happens immediately, sometimes while I am typing into a EditText. Usually, the topmost EditText in the leftmost fragment steals focus. I don't see the problem when a EditText in the leftmost fragment is clicked, even if it is not the topmost one. Its like Android doesn't like focusing on a TextView that is not along the left edge. Does this sound familiar? I have unsuccessfully tried overriding the findFocus() method in ScrollView as suggested by Skip in randomly-jumping.

@TITLE:Gradle multiproject optional subproject's transitive dependency should be resolved to an existing subproject
@CONTENT:suppose the following project. the master project is a multi-project, however every part of the larger project can be developed individually or mixed in: /master/build.gradle
/m1/build.gradle
/m2/build.gradle
/m3/build.gradle
 suppose m3 uses m2 and m2 uses m1 ( m1 <- m2 <- m3 ) the presence of m2 is optional a multi-project with the following layout also reasonable /master/build.gradle
/m1/build.gradle
/m3/build.gradle
 but in this case m2 would be pulled in from the artifact repository which is fine...however m1 was a transitive dependency of m2 which is good, but how can i tell gradle to use the local version of m1 instead of the baked artifact? I'm stuck with this, every place i have access to override these thing gradle gives me "just" ModuleVersionSelector level access, how can i add a DefaultProjectDependency according to the downloaded artifact transitive dependencies? i may have an alternative if i can access the full dependency graph of the archived artifacts, and put in some overrides/excludes. EDIT: the best i've come up with is using a filter using resolutionStrategy, i've created an example by further developing the 'elastic-deps' project https://github.com/kgyrtkirk/elastic-deps

@CONTENT:I cannot get this regex to work: "4.  182 ex" (number, period, 2 blank spaces, 3 numbers, blank space, 2 characters"
 The regex syntax should return "4182" and remove period, blank spaces, and characters. Can you help me please? EDIT!!! Thanks everyone but I missed the key question: a) the regex shall only find the value (4182) when the same line contains a specific text for example "magic", so for example: "Magic 4. 182 ex" b) the regex shall "only" find the value (4182) when the table contains a specific text for example "Magic": "Magic 4. 182 ex Lisefeo 2. 123 fg Nioos 3. 124 df" specific text = exact match or contains those charachters My regex that I've tried so far but does it work for a whole table (not just a line) ?

The form id matches in the html and javascript. The PHP is linked in the Javascript and I have the javascript linked in the head of my html. What am I missing? I've tried other codes I found online as well and nothing.. The issue is that no email ever gets sent through.

@LINK:/questions/21222629/imitate-messagebox-waiting-for-users-choice
@TITLE:Imitate MessageBox - waiting for user's choice
@CONTENT:I'm working mostly with Windows Phone and I'm trying to create something similar to MessageBox - small window that apperas and waits for user's choice (the Thread that invoked window waits). I found three ways how I can achive this goal: FIRST - TaskCompletionSource In this case my Task looks like this: TaskCompletionSource<bool> taskComplete = new TaskCompletionSource<bool>();
private async Task myTask1()
{
   window.Show(); // Show window
   await taskComplete.Task;
   //some job run after User's choice
   MessageBox.Show("Job finished");
}
 And my window's Closed event: private void WindowClosedEvent1(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
   taskComplete.SetResult(true);
}
 SECOND - SemaphoreSlim My Task and event: private SemaphoreSlim mySemaphore = new SemaphoreSlim(0, 1);
private async Task myTask2()
{
    window.Show(); // Show window
    await mySemaphore.WaitAsync();
    //some job run after User's choice
    MessageBox.Show("Job finished");
}

private void WindowClosedEvent2(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    mySemaphore.Release();
}
 THIRD - EventWaitHandle: My Task and Event: EventWaitHandle waitForUser = new EventWaitHandle(false, EventResetMode.AutoReset, "myEventName");
private async Task myTask3()
{
    window.Show(); // Show window
    await Task.Run(() => waitForUser.WaitOne());
    //some job run after User's choice
    MessageBox.Show("Job finished");
}

private void WindowClosedEvent3(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    waitForUser.Set();
}
 All three methods work, but I cannot decide which to use. I'm mostly thinking that 1) or 2) will be the best choice. Can any of those three methods cause troubles in some circumstances? Has anybody tried something like this?
@CODE:TaskCompletionSource<bool> taskComplete = new TaskCompletionSource<bool>();
private async Task myTask1()
{
   window.Show(); // Show window
   await taskComplete.Task;
   //some job run after User's choice
   MessageBox.Show("Job finished");
} private void WindowClosedEvent1(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
   taskComplete.SetResult(true);
} private SemaphoreSlim mySemaphore = new SemaphoreSlim(0, 1);
private async Task myTask2()
{
    window.Show(); // Show window
    await mySemaphore.WaitAsync();
    //some job run after User's choice
    MessageBox.Show("Job finished");
}

private void WindowClosedEvent2(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    mySemaphore.Release();
} EventWaitHandle waitForUser = new EventWaitHandle(false, EventResetMode.AutoReset, "myEventName");
private async Task myTask3()
{
    window.Show(); // Show window
    await Task.Run(() => waitForUser.WaitOne());
    //some job run after User's choice
    MessageBox.Show("Job finished");
}

private void WindowClosedEvent3(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    waitForUser.Set();
} MessageDialog Popup

@TITLE:The number of characters of comments in a file (C programming)
@CONTENT:I can't seem to get it right, tried everything, but.. int commentChars() {
char str[256], fileName[256];
FILE *fp;
int i;


do{
    long commentCount=0;
    fflush(stdin);
    printf("%s\nEnter the name of the file in %s/", p, dir);
    gets(fileName);

    if(!(fp=fopen(fileName, "r"))) {
            printf("Error! File not found, try again");
                return 0;
    }

    while(!feof(fp)) {
            fgets(str,sizeof str,fp);
            for(int i=0;i<=sizeof str;i++) {
                if(str[i] == '/' && str[i+1] == '/') {
                        commentCount += (strlen(str)-2);
                }
            }
    }

    fclose(fp);

        printf("All the chars, contained in a comment: %ld\n", commentCount);
        puts(p);
        printf("Do you want to search for another file?<Y/N>: ");
        i=checker();


}while(i);}
 The result is "All the chars, containted in a comment: 0", even though I have comments. And my second question was.. Analogically, how can I do the same for comments, containing /* */, seems like an impossible job for me.

    gets(fileName);

    if(!(fp=fopen(fileName, "r"))) {
            printf("Error! File not found, try again");
                return 0;
    }

            for(int i=0;i<=sizeof str;i++) {

        puts(p);
        printf("Do you want to search for another file?<Y/N>: ");
        i=checker();

@TITLE:android.database.CursorWindowAllocationException when moving a Cursor
@CONTENT:I'am using an SQLite database and I regularly get runtime errors I can't find the origin of. After a query, I use moveToFirst to point one the first record retrieved and this sometimes triggers an android.database.CursorWindowAllocationException exception. Added to this exception is the following sentence : "Cursor window allocation of 2048kb failed.# open Cursors=736 (#cursors opendby this proc=736)". In the Android documentation, I haven't found anything related to this exception yet. Does anyone know it's cause and a way to avoid it?

@TITLE:Game in linux terminal: Changing images: printing over already printed text
@CONTENT:Well, I'm simply implementing pretty easy card game in linux terminal. What I want to achieve is an effect of changing images, basically trick printing over already printed text(which I guess I cannot do except reprinting same line with \r). What I was thinking to do is to get the terminal height, and then print newlines till the lower edge of the terminal, then position the cursor in terminal, so that the last line printed would be on top. Are there any nice ways to do this? I've just found library called Ncurses. Seems it can do that. Is it a good option?

@LINK:/questions/21216389/termination-check-on-unionwith
@TITLE:Termination check on unionWith
@CONTENT:I'm having a problem with termination checking, very similar to the one described in this question and also this Agda bug report/feature request. The problem is convincing the compiler that the following unionWith terminates. Using a combining function for duplicate keys, unionWith merges two maps represented as lists of (key, value) pairs sorted by key. The Key parameter of a finite map is a (non-tight) lower bound on the keys contained in the map. (One reason for defining this data type is to provide a semantic domain into which I can interpret AVL trees in order to prove various properties about them.) open import Function
open import Relation.Binary renaming (IsEquivalence to IsEq)
open import Relation.Binary.PropositionalEquality as P using (__)

module FiniteMap
   {k v ? ?}
   {Key : Set k}
   (Value : Set v)
   {_<_ : Rel Key ?}
   (isStrictTotalOrder : IsStrictTotalOrder __ _<_)
   {_?_ : Rel Value ?}
   (isEquivalence : IsEq _?_)
   where

   open import Algebra.FunctionProperties
   open import Data.Product
   open IsStrictTotalOrder isStrictTotalOrder
   open import Level

   KV : Set (k ? v)
   KV = Key  Value

   data FiniteMap (l : Key) : Set (k ? v ? ?) where
      [] : FiniteMap l
      _?_ : (kv : KV)  let k = proj? kv in l < k  (m : FiniteMap k)  FiniteMap l

   unionWith : ? {l}  Op? Value  Op? (FiniteMap l)
   unionWith _ [] [] = []
   unionWith _ [] m = m
   unionWith _ m [] = m
   unionWith __ (_?_ (k , v) k<l m) (_?_ (k , v) k<l m) with compare k k
   ... | tri< k<k _ _ = _?_ (k , v) k<l (unionWith __ m (_?_ (k , v) k<k m))
   ... | tri? _ kk _ rewrite P.sym kk = {!!} --_?_ (k , v  v) k<l (unionWith __ m m)
   ... | tri> _ _ k<k = _?_ (k , v) k<l (unionWith __ (_?_ (k , v) k<k m) m)
 I've been unable to generalise the solutions discussed in the referenced question to my setting. For example if I introduce an auxiliary function unionWith', defined mutually recursively with unionWith, which is invoked from the latter in the k' < k case:    unionWith : ? {l}  Op? Value  Op? (FiniteMap l)
   unionWith : ? {l}  Op? Value  (kv : KV)  let k = proj? kv in l < k  FiniteMap k  Op? (FiniteMap l)

   unionWith _ [] [] = []
   unionWith _ [] m = m
   unionWith _ m [] = m
   unionWith __ (_?_ (k , v) k<l m) (_?_ (k , v) k<l m) with compare k k
   ... | tri< k<k _ _ = _?_ (k , v) k<l (unionWith __ m (_?_ (k , v) k<k m))
   ... | tri? _ kk _ rewrite P.sym kk = {!!} --_?_ (k , v  v) k<l (unionWith __ m m)
   ... | tri> _ _ k<k = _?_ (k , v) k<l (unionWith __ (k , v) k<k m m)

   unionWith _ (k , v) l<k m [] = _?_ (k , v) l<k m
   unionWith __ (k , v) l<k m (_?_ (k , v) k<l m) with compare k k
   ... | tri< k<k _ _ = {!!}
   ... | tri? _ kk _ = {!!}
   ... | tri> _ _ k<k = _?_ (k , v) k<l (unionWith __ (k , v) k<k m m)
 then as soon as I tie the recursive knot by replacing the first missing case in unionWith' with the required call to unionWith, it fails to termination-check. I also tried introducing additional with patterns, but that's complicated by need to use the result of compare in the recursive calls. (If I use nested with clauses that doesn't seem to help the termination checker.) Is there a way to use with patterns or auxiliary functions to get this compiling? It seems like a straightforward enough situation, so I'm hoping it just a case of knowing the right trick. (Maybe the new termination checker in the Agda development branch can deal with this, but I'd like to avoid installing a development version unless I have to.)

@TITLE:QFile.write( myStruct ) - how?
@CONTENT:I'm beginning with Qt and am stuck with a problem supposedly for quite a long time now. I'm sure it's just something I don't see in C++. Anyway, please look at the following simple code and point me what am I doing wrong: typedef struct FILEHEADER {
    char udfSignature[8];
    char fileName[64];
    long fileVersion;
    UNIXTIME fileCreation;
    UNIXTIME lastRebuild;
    FILEPOINTER descriptor;
} fileheader;

QFile f("nanga.dat");
    if(f.open(QIODevice::ReadWrite));

f.write(fileheader);
 Qt 5.2.0 trows me the following error message: C:\sw\udb\udb\main.h:113: error: no matching function for call to
'QFile::write(FILEHEADER&)'
         file.write(header);
                          ^
 Any suggestion on how I can write this struct to a QFile? Thanks

@LINK:/questions/21197879/updated-swf-doesnt-start-in-chrome-pepper-flash
@TITLE:(Updated) SWF doesn't start in Chrome (Pepper Flash)
@CONTENT:Update: I've narrowed it down to Chrome's Pepper Flash. Disabling it (which forces Chrome to use the installed version of Flash that everything else uses), fixes it. But most Chrome users won't have it disabled, so I'm still looking for a solution. I have a simple game that works fine in Firefox and when debugging in FlashDevelop, but in Chrome, fails to start. It seems to be embedded properly; the white rectangle appears, and gives the Flash options if you right click it. But it doesn't display the graphics or start the game, it just sits there. The strange thing is, if I do anything else with the page-- for example, if I minimize it and then maximize it again, or switch tabs then switch back-- the game will suddenly appear as it should. I'm not sure what to make of this, other than both of those things would cause the page to be re-rendered (I think). If I press any key (the game has a keyboard listener), it pops into existence also. So the SWF is definitely there and waiting for commands as it should be, it's just not displaying the initial state. My first thought was that I'm not loading it properly, but I'm using the standard loading code that FlashDevelop inserts: public function Main():void {
    if (stage) init();
    else addEventListener(Event.ADDED_TO_STAGE, init);
}

private function init(e:Event = null):void {
    removeEventListener(Event.ADDED_TO_STAGE, init);
   // program entry point

 None seem to have any effect. Finally, it behaves the same whether it's on my local computer or on a web server. I've also noticed that, once in a while, it doesn't happen, which is more puzzling, and makes me wonder if it's a cache issue. But it usually does. Updated with more information

@TITLE:External Storage Permission Issue with MediaProvider / Ring Tones
@CONTENT:Some of my users have reported to Google Play the following error when trying to select a ringtone in my app. (there's more to it, but it's not relevant) java.lang.SecurityException: Permission Denial: 
reading com.android.providers.media.MediaProvider 
uri content://media/external/audio/media 
from pid=5738, uid=10122 requires android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
 I assume this issue is happening due to certain tones that are on external storage. I don't want to include the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission in my app unless I absolutely have to. Is there a way to circumvent the issue and just exclude any tones that may be on the external storage? Note: I'm getting ringtones with RingtoneManager and convert them between String and Uri. No other code is touching the user's media. Also, I do not have a line number since the stacktrace is from obfuscated code and re-mapping the stack trace did not provide line number.

@TITLE:UIPageControl - Change page on click of button
@CONTENT:I am using UIPageControl along with UISwipeGestureRecognizer to switch between view controllers. The pages are changed using swipe. I also need to change the page when a UIButton is pressed on one of the view controllers. Here is how the swipe is used to change the views: - (void)swipeRightToLeftGesture:(UIGestureRecognizer *)gestureRecognizer {
    if (self.pageControl.currentPage == 0) { 
       [UIView animateWithDuration:1
                 animations:^{

                     for (UIViewController *vc in self.childViewControllers) {
                         CGRect frame = vc.view.frame;
                         frame.origin.x -= self.view.frame.size.height;
                         vc.view.frame = frame;
                 }
      }];
      self.pageControl.currentPage = 1;
   }
}
 I hope the question is clear. I tried my best to make it clear.

@TITLE:After applying CCITT compression on my Tiff File, it produces an image with a solid black background
@CONTENT:Creating tiff file, with LZW compression (default):- System.Drawing.Bitmap bitmap = new System.Drawing.Bitmap(800, 1000); 
Graphics g = Graphics.FromImage(bitmap);
g.DrawString("Name: " + Name.Text, outputFont, Brushes.Black, new PointF(0, 20));
g.DrawString("Date Of Birth: " + Date_Of_Birth.Text, outputFont, Brushes.Black, new PointF(0, 40));
g.DrawString("Address: " + Address.Text, outputFont, Brushes.Black, new PointF(0, 60));
g.DrawString("City: " + City.Text, outputFont, Brushes.Black, new PointF(0, 80));
g.DrawString("State: " + State.Text, outputFont, Brushes.Black, new PointF(0, 100));
g.DrawString("Zip Code: " + Zip_Code.Text, outputFont, Brushes.Black, new PointF(0, 120));
g.DrawString("Phone: " + Phone.Text, outputFont, Brushes.Black, new PointF(0, 140));
g.DrawString(" ID: " + ID.Text, outputFont, Brushes.Black, new PointF(0, 160));
fileName = saveDirectory + id + ".tif";
bitmap.Save(fileName, ImageFormat.Tiff);
 So I am trying to change its compression to CCITT:- Bitmap myBitmap;
myBitmap = new Bitmap(fileName);
ImageCodecInfo myImageCodecInfo;
myImageCodecInfo = GetEncoderInfo("image/tiff");
System.Drawing.Imaging.Encoder myEncoder;
myEncoder = System.Drawing.Imaging.Encoder.Compression;
EncoderParameters myEncoderParameters;
myEncoderParameters = new EncoderParameters(1);
EncoderParameter myEncoderParameter;      
myEncoderParameter = new EncoderParameter(myEncoder,(long)EncoderValue.CompressionCCITT4);
myEncoderParameters.Param[0] = myEncoderParameter;
myBitmap.Save(new_fileName, myImageCodecInfo, myEncoderParameters);

private static ImageCodecInfo GetEncoderInfo(String mimeType)
{
  int j;
  ImageCodecInfo[] encoders;
  encoders = ImageCodecInfo.GetImageEncoders();
  for (j = 0; j < encoders.Length; ++j)
    {
        if (encoders[j].MimeType == mimeType)
        return encoders[j];
    }
  return null;
}
 The process works and I can see that the compression type of my tiff file has correctly been modified to CCITT (by right clicking on the output file and checking properties). However when I try to open it, the whole image in black.. nothing is on it. When I change the compression type to LZW or None or RLE then the tiff file is once again a viewable image. Unfortunately I need the CCITT format only. Can anyone help me figure this out? Update: Even though the method now works on my windows 7 32 bit OS using Visual studio 2010.. Once published to the Windows 2008 server, the solution doesn't work (only for CCITT compression techniques). The following link explains why. http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/vstudio/en-US/1585c562-f7a9-4cfd-9674-6855ffaa8653/parameter-is-not-valid-for-compressionccitt4-on-windows-server-2003-and-2008?forum=netfxbcl As per this article, this is what I am trying but can't get the compression to apply to the original image:-         int width = 800;
        int height = 1000;
        int stride = width/8;
        byte[] pixels = new byte[height*stride];

        // Try creating a new image with a custom palette.
        List<System.Windows.Media.Color> colors = new List<System.Windows.Media.Color>();
        colors.Add(System.Windows.Media.Colors.Red);
        colors.Add(System.Windows.Media.Colors.Blue);
        colors.Add(System.Windows.Media.Colors.Green);
        BitmapPalette myPalette = new BitmapPalette(colors);

        // Creates a new empty image with the pre-defined palette

        BitmapSource image = BitmapSource.Create(
            width,
            height,
            96,
            96,
            System.Windows.Media.PixelFormats.BlackWhite,
            myPalette, 
            pixels, 
            stride);


FileStream stream = new FileStream(Original_File, FileMode.Create);
TiffBitmapEncoder encoder = new TiffBitmapEncoder();
encoder.Compression = TiffCompressOption.Ccitt4;
encoder.Frames.Add(BitmapFrame.Create(image));
encoder.Save(stream);
 However, my end result is a file with the correct compression, but a solid black background. Deja Vu.

@LINK:/questions/21191620/websocket-not-sending-data
@TITLE:WebSocket not sending data
@CONTENT:I've got a bit of a problem with my websocket code intermittently not sending data... As it stands I've written a small C# server which handles the websocket and prints a label. When running the code on my computer it works fine every time but when I tried it on two other computers I had problems. I set up some packet sniffing software and what I seem to see as follows: When the application works... The browser creates a connection to the server which completes the hand shake. Once completed the websocket.onopen event fires. During this event I send data to the server (which I can see in Network Monitor) and then check for buffered data before closing the websocket. When the application doesn't work... Exactly the same thing happens, however I can't see the data in Network Monitor. The handshake is there, and the onopen event fires and closes the connection but no data is sent over the network... I installed Network Monitor on both the client and server machine and neither machine can see the missing the data. Can anyone see any problems in my code below? Failing that does anyone know if this is a bug? The code I wrote is as follows: var _socket;
function sendXmlToLabelPrinter(strXML)
{
if (_socket == null)
{
console.log("creating socket");
_socket = new WebSocket("ws://127.0.0.1:50/"); // LOCAL

@TITLE:Is there a C# equivalent to Java CompletionService to react to completed threads?
@CONTENT:There are lots of examples of how to wait for all 'worker' jobs to finish, but what about reacting as each worker completes in the same way as Java's CompletionService? I've hacked together something that works, but this seems fragile: int completedWorkers = 0;
while (completedWorkers < workerCount)
{
     int eventId = WaitHandle.WaitAny(eventArray);
     events[eventId].Reset();
     completedWorkers++;
     Console.WriteLine("Worker {0} has completed. {1} have now completed.", eventId, completedWorkers);
}
Console.WriteLine("All threads have finished");
 This relies on an array of ManualResetEvent instances ('eventArray' in my example), similar to that shown in the Microsoft example, http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/3dasc8as.aspx (however their code uses WaitAll() to wait for all workers to finish, not reacting as each worker finishes). Edit: I've accepted Douglas's answer using the TPL, but for reference, Delegates give us this functionality out of the box: IAsyncResult result = caller.BeginInvoke(
                new AsyncCallback(CallbackMethod),
                "The call executed on thread {0}, with return value \"{1}\".");

void CallbackMethod(IAsyncResult ar) 
{
    // 'react' to async delegates completing
}

while (completedWorkers < workerCount)
{
     int eventId = WaitHandle.WaitAny(eventArray);

@LINK:/questions/21184271/how-to-work-with-char-types-in-dart-print-alphabet
@TITLE:How to work with char types in Dart? (Print alphabet)
@CONTENT:I am trying to learn the Dart language, by transposing the exercices given by my school for C programming. The very first exercice in our C pool is to write a function print_alphabet() that prints the alphabet in lowercase; it is forbidden to print the alphabet directly. In POSIX C, the straightforward solution would be: #include <unistd.h>

void    print_alphabet(void)
{
    char    c;

    c = 'a';
    while (c <= 'z')
    {
        write(STDOUT_FILENO, &c, 1);
        c++;
    }
}

int     main(void)
{
    print_alphabet();
    return (0);
}
 However, as far as I know, the current version of Dart (1.1.1) does not have an easy way of dealing with characters. The farthest I came up with (for my very first version) is this: void  print_alphabet()
{
  var c = "a".codeUnits.first;
  var i = 0;

  while (++i <= 26)
  {
    print(c.toString());
    c++;
  }
}

void main() {
  print_alphabet();
}
 Which prints the ASCII value of each character, one per line, as a string ("97" ... "122"). Not really what I intendedK I am trying to search for a proper way of doing this. But the lack of a char type like the one in C is giving me a bit of a hard time, as a beginner!
@CODE:print_alphabet() #include <unistd.h>

void    print_alphabet(void)
{
    char    c;

    c = 'a';
    while (c <= 'z')
    {
        write(STDOUT_FILENO, &c, 1);
        c++;
    }
}

int     main(void)
{
    print_alphabet();
    return (0);
} void  print_alphabet()
{
  var c = "a".codeUnits.first;
  var i = 0;

  while (++i <= 26)
  {
    print(c.toString());
    c++;
  }
}

void main() {
  print_alphabet();
} char

} else {

 The problem here is that $_POST['email'] has a value of NULL. Why is $_POST['email'] null when console.log() for emailData returns a value. Can anyone help? I think the prob is in the appending part. (Not sure) Please no jQuery. I know how to do this in jQuery but I want to learn how to do this in javascript. So yeah thanks

The height should change based on the aspect ratio of the background image. The dimensions of the background image is 1500x406. Here's the sample code: HTML <div id="wrapper" class="clearfix">
    <div id="bg_img"></div>
</div>
 CSS .clearfix {
    width: 100%;
    position: relative;
    display: block;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    border: 0;
    line-height: 1.5;
}

#bg_img {
    background: url('http://rndimg.com/ImageStore/OilPaintingBlue/999x400_OilPaintingBlue_19aa91c1b6e142f288fe69eb2a160a2b.jpg') no-repeat;
    position: absolute;
    z-index: 100;
    top: 9em;
    width: 100%;
    height: 406px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    display: inline;
}
 The working JSFiddle
@CODE:<div id="wrapper" class="clearfix">
    <div id="bg_img"></div>
</div> .clearfix {
    width: 100%;
    position: relative;
    display: block;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    border: 0;
    line-height: 1.5;
}

#bg_img {
    background: url('http://rndimg.com/ImageStore/OilPaintingBlue/999x400_OilPaintingBlue_19aa91c1b6e142f288fe69eb2a160a2b.jpg') no-repeat;
    position: absolute;
    z-index: 100;
    top: 9em;
    width: 100%;
    height: 406px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    display: inline;
} background-size: cover; background: url('http://rndimg.com/ImageStore/OilPaintingBlue/999x400_OilPaintingBlue_19aa91??c1b6e142f288fe69eb2a160a2b.jpg') repeat

@LINK:/questions/21172044/lack-of-autorelease-optimization-under-arc-compiler
@TITLE:Lack of autorelease optimization under ARC compiler
@CONTENT:I was just wondering, why is there no autorelease pool optimization under the ARC compiler, where it would retain an object in the innermost scope, remove it from the autorelease pool and release once the object is no longer in use? To quote a very impractical example from another question, for(NSUInteger i = 0; i < 10000; i++)
{
    for(NSUInteger j = 0; j < 10000; j++)
    {
        NSNumber* n = [NSNumber numberWithUnsignedInteger:j];
        //NSLog(@"%@", n); //Disabled this to increase memory bloat faster.
    }
}
 Without @autoreleasepool { ... } wrapping, memory grows and grows. Wrapping with @autoreleasepool, memory remains low: for(NSUInteger i = 0; i < 10000; i++)
{
    for(NSUInteger j = 0; j < 10000; j++)
    {
        @autoreleasepool {
            NSNumber* n = [NSNumber numberWithUnsignedInteger:j];
            //NSLog(@"%@", n); //Disabled this to increase memory bloat faster.
        }
    }
}
 But why can't the compiler optimize cases like these, where the objects will not be needed beyond the innermost scope and remove the need of the @autoreleasepool wrapping? Is there a technical reason this is not possible or has not been done yet? Edit To clarify, why can't the compiler output a code like the following: for(NSUInteger i = 0; i < 10000; i++)
{
    for(NSUInteger j = 0; j < 10000; j++)
    {
        NSNumber* n = [NSNumber numberWithUnsignedInteger:j];
        objc_retain(n);
        objc_removeFromAutoreleasePool(n);
        NSLog(@"%@", n);
        objc_release(n);
    }
}

@TITLE:How to reload the screen when changing languages? in JavaFX?
@CONTENT:Well, I'm beginner with java and fxml. I creating a application and need to change language of the screen. I have the file with internationalized keys but i no have idea as reload the screen with the changed language. The application have a menu where have the language available. I want just refresh screen when the user change language. change is still manual, as you can see on code: (Main.java): public class Main extends Application {

private Locale locale = new Locale("en", "US");
private Image icon = new Image("picture.jpg");

@Override
public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {
    Parent root = FXMLLoader.load(getClass().getResource("Home.fxml"), ResourceBundle.getBundle("label", locale));
    Scene scene = new Scene(root);
    stage.setTitle("GUI");
    stage.getIcons().add(icon);
    stage.setScene(scene);
    stage.show();
}
public static void main(String[] args) {
    launch(args);
}
 This code is on the controller, when change language:     @FXML
private void btnMenuLanguageEnglishAction(ActionEvent event) {
    this.locale = new Locale("en", "US");
}

@FXML
private void btnMenuLanguagePortuguesAction(ActionEvent event) {
    this.locale = new Locale("pt", "BR");
}
 how to send this locale to main and refresh the screen? as will be the method that I use? I've tried some that I saw here on the site but no one answered my question.
@CODE:public class Main extends Application {

private Locale locale = new Locale("en", "US");
private Image icon = new Image("picture.jpg");

@Override
public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {
    Parent root = FXMLLoader.load(getClass().getResource("Home.fxml"), ResourceBundle.getBundle("label", locale));
    Scene scene = new Scene(root);
    stage.setTitle("GUI");
    stage.getIcons().add(icon);
    stage.setScene(scene);
    stage.show();
}
public static void main(String[] args) {
    launch(args);
} @FXML
private void btnMenuLanguageEnglishAction(ActionEvent event) {
    this.locale = new Locale("en", "US");
}

@FXML
private void btnMenuLanguagePortuguesAction(ActionEvent event) {
    this.locale = new Locale("pt", "BR");

@LINK:/questions/21170525/cant-connect-to-database-to-execute-identity-functions
@TITLE:Can't connect to Database to execute Identity functions
@CONTENT:I've created a new application with ASP.NET MVC5, using Individual User Accounts for security and Code-First Migrations for the Models/Database modeling. All options are default. I want to setup custom Users and Roles to it, so i created a Seed using RoleManager and UserManager just to populate the Database. It works fine, create 3 Users, 3 Roles and set each User's Role correctly. I can log in to the application correctly. The problem is that i can't execute any Identity method using the User, which is the logged User, the only things that i can get is the User.Identity.IsAuthenticated value, and the User.Identity.Name, which are correct. Every other method like Roles.GetRolesForUser("John"), or User.IsInRole("Student"), always generates this exception: ProviderException : The Role Manager feature has not been enabled. So okay, as in this article, i managed to insert the the <roleManager enabled="true" /> in the Web.config, and now it takes a really long time to respond, and generates Exceptions like: Referring to: Roles.IsUserInRole("Student")
 Generates: HttpException
 Referring to: Roles.GetRolesForUser(User.Identity.Name)
 Generates: NullReferenceException
 Accessing the About page with a User in Student role logged in: [Authorize(Roles="Teacher")]
public ActionResult About()
{
    ViewBag.Message = "Your application description page.";

    return View();
}
 Generates: SqlException
HttpException
 It's like i have no connection to the Database at all, which is LocalDB, automatically generated and i could populate in the Seed Method and even make Login to the application. I could even load data from the AspNetUsers table and show it in the View using the code below: using (Models.ApplicationDbContext db = new Models.ApplicationDbContext())
{
    List<Models.ApplicationUser> Users = db.Users.ToList();

    ViewBag.Users = Users;
}

return View();
 PLEASE HELP :'( Here's the Seed code, that works fine, so it can connect to the Database using the Identity engine. protected override void Seed(LocalBDAuthTest.Models.ApplicationDbContext context)

@TITLE:Indexing float values in Python
@CONTENT:I have a list of floats generated from a data structure which is a list of dictionaries - i.e. I've iterated over the whole list and selected for certain values in the given dictionary. Now, I want to actually do something with these data points, for which I need some reference to the original position. I tried to simply use the data point as a key, but after trying and failing I did some digging and realized that floats aren't precisely represented due to the way computers work. So, what I need is some way to assign a unique value to each dictionary in the list, e.g: list = [...]
vallist = []
index = {}
for i in range(0, len(list)):
value = i+0.123
vallist.append(value)
index[value] = i
 Except I evidently need to assign each value a unique item to be able to point back to their position in the list object. I'm imagining I could possibly create a new object called "valuelist" or something and then int over that, but this seems like something that probably has an obvious workaround that I'm just too thick to figure out. To reiterate, what I want is a way to make the values point back to their original position in the list - in my data structure, my list contains a ton of dictionaries, and the way I handle it is somewhat more complicated, so I'm sort of stuck with my possibly impractical structure. Thanks!

@TITLE:Items disappears from combo box when I read them from model
@CONTENT:I have QComboBox and I set QStandardItemModel because I need multi-select check-boxes in it. Problem is that when I read text value and check state of items in comboBox, they disappear from combo. This is how I set model to comboBox: areas = ["Area one", "Area two", "Area three", "Area four"]
model = QtGui.QStandardItemModel(4, 1)# 4 rows, 1 col
for i,area in enumerate(areas):
    item = QtGui.QStandardItem(area)
    item.setFlags(QtCore.Qt.ItemIsUserCheckable | QtCore.Qt.ItemIsEnabled)
    item.setData(QtCore.Qt.Unchecked, QtCore.Qt.CheckStateRole)
    model.setItem(i, 0, item)
self.ui.comboBox.setModel(model)
 This is how I read data from comboBox: modelColumn = self.ui.comboBox.model().takeColumn(0)
for item in modelColumn:
   print item.text(),"---", item.checkState()
 Here is a screenshot before and after I read data from combo box: ...and result I get, as expected: Area one --- 0
Area two --- 2
Area three --- 2
Area four --- 0
 Also, is there simple way not to show "Area one" when comboBox is inactive (I want to see only arrow in right corner like on second picture) or to set other text to be shown, like "choose area"?

@CONTENT:I'm setting up a Jenkins server for a project of my company. I configured the security realm to use LDAP and had no problem until we decided to hire external development team along with our devs. We cannot create LDAP accounts for them for some reasons, however it is essential to use CI server together to collaborate and to get benefits of using CI server. Is it possible to add external users who are not in LDAP? I can think of only one solution so far. use 'Jenkins's own user database' instead of 'LDAP' and create all users manually. Any other solutions for this situations?

@TITLE:Redering SVG file in html page
@CONTENT:I have one SVG file that I have to show it in webpage. SVG files contains some links, on clicking links, page should be opened in new window. 1) If I use img tag like <img id="zoom_mw" src="NC_013929_Annotation_details.svg" alt="The CRISPRmap" 
     data-zoom-image="NC_013929_Annotation_details.svg">
 I am not able to click the links. 2) To overcome this problem I am using <object type="image/svg+xml" data="NC_013929_Annotation_details.svg"></object>
 I am able to click links. But here the problem comes, Image should be rendered into a div of width 815px and height 815px. If I use img tag it is perfectly rendering but if I use object tag, full image is loading. Image is normally huge file may be 4500px width and height. I will use zoom feature to show user image clearly. I need to solution to render SVG into a div of height and width 815px and links in svg file should be clickable. I am using HTML4, I cannot upgrade to HTML5.

@CONTENT:I have a local file in which I try to load texture like this: var texture = THREE.ImageUtils.loadTexture( 'image.jpg' );
var cubeGeo = new THREE.CubeGeometry( 50, 50, 50 );
var cubeMat = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial( { map: texture } );
var cube = new THREE.Mesh( cubeGeo, cubeMat );
scene.add( cube );
 The image doesn't show (the cube is black). When I move the whole folder to a server, and load it from there, the image is displayed. My question is, why does it work when the files are on a server and not when they are on my computer? All files have been copied so it is not a problem with missing files. I also tried with absolute path but still no result. Do I have to change some settings on my computer? I am trying this on Windows 7 with Chrome 32.0.1700.76 m (latest version at the time of writing this) and I am using THREE.js r64. No other libraries are used.

@TITLE:Can you permanently add to an array in Javascript?
@CONTENT:Forgive me, I'm very new to programming in general, especially Javascript. I've basically got an array as shown simplified below. var recipes = [
    { "recipeName":"Recipe1" , "ingredient1":"Recipe1Ingredient1" , "ingredient2":"Recipe1Ingredient2" , "ingredient3":"Recipe1Ingredient3"},
    { "recipeName":"Recipe2" , "ingredient1":"Recipe2Ingredient1" , "ingredient2":"Recipe2Ingredient2" , "ingredient3":"Recipe2Ingredient3"},
];
 On one page, users can search for recipes. On another, they can add recipes to the array via an HTML form. I have the following which pushes the new data to the array. recipes.push({"recipeName":newRecipeName , "ingredient1":newIngredient1 , "ingredient2":newIngredient2 , "ingredient3":newIngredient3});
 This works fine initially, but if I refresh the page or go back to the find page, the new recipe is removed from the array. I want the new recipe to be added permanently to the array. I'm guessing the solution for this isn't so simple, but I've been looking into this for a while and done a lot of searching to no avail. Can anybody point me in the right direction? Again apologies for my inexperience, I'm very new to programming.

    { "recipeName":"Recipe1" , "ingredient1":"Recipe1Ingredient1" , "ingredient2":"Recipe1Ingredient2" , "ingredient3":"Recipe1Ingredient3"},

I know for a fact that for some particular dates, the files are missing on the website. Subsequently my code stops at that point. I then have to manually reset the date index (increment it by 1) and re-run the code. Since I have to download more than 1500 files, I was wondering if I can somehow capture the 'absence of the file' and instead of the code stopping, it continues with the next date in the array. Below is the dput of a part of the date array: dput(head(fnames,10))
c("20060102.trd", "20060103.trd", "20060104.trd", "20060105.trd", 
"20060106.trd", "20060109.trd", "20060110.trd", "20060112.trd", 
"20060113.trd", "20060116.trd")
 This file has 1723 dates. Below is the code that I am using: for (i in 1:length(fnames)){
file <- paste(substr(fnames[i],7,8), substr(fnames[i],5,6), substr(fnames[i],1,4), sep = "")
URL <- paste("http://xxxxx_",file,".zip",sep="")
download.file(URL, paste(file, "zip", sep = "."))
unzip(paste(file, "zip", sep = "."))}
 The program works fine, till it encounters a particular date for which the file is missing, and it stops. Is there a way to capture this, and print the missing file name (the variable 'file'), and move on to the next date in the array? Please help. I apologize that I have not shared the exact URL. In case it becomes difficult to simulate the issue, then please let me know. * Trying to incorporate @Paul's suggestion. I worked on a smaller dataset. dput(testnames) is c("20120214.trd", "20120215.trd", "20120216.trd", "20120217.trd", "20120221.trd") I know that file corresponding to the date '20120216' is missing from the website. I altered my code to incorporate the tryCatch function. Below it is: tryCatch({for (i in 1:length(testnames)){
        file <- paste(substr(testnames[i],7,8), substr(testnames[i],5,6), substr(testnames[i],1,4), sep = "")
        URL <- paste("http://xxxx_",file,".zip",sep="")
        download.file(URL, paste(file, "zip", sep = "."))
        unzip(paste(file, "zip", sep = "."))}
},
error = function(e) {cat(file, '\n')
                     i=i+1},
warning = function(w) {message('cannot unzip')
                       i=i+1}
)
 It runs fine for the first two dates, and as expected, throws an error for the 3rd one. I am facing 2 issues: When I 'exclude' the warning block, it gives me the missing file name file as coded in the error block. But when I 'include' the warning block, it only issues the warning, and somehow doesnt execute the error block. Why is that? In either case, the code stops after reading "20120216.trd" and doesnt proceed ahead with the next file, which is desirable. Is incrementing the variable i not sufficient for that purpose? Please advise.

@LINK:/questions/21129737/how-do-i-interpret-the-output-of-php-uname
@TITLE:How do I interpret the output of php_uname
@CONTENT:From the manual I got the information: mode is a single character that defines what information is returned:

    'a': This is the default. Contains all modes in the sequence "s n r v m".
    's': Operating system name. eg. FreeBSD.
    'n': Host name. eg. localhost.example.com.
    'r': Release name. eg. 5.1.2-RELEASE.
    'v': Version information. Varies a lot between operating systems.
    'm': Machine type. eg. i386.
 So I created a function function interpret_php_uname(){
    $release_info["os_name"] = php_uname('s');
    $release_info["uname_version_info"] = php_uname('v');
    $release_info["machine_type"] = php_uname('m');
    $release_info["php_uname"] = php_uname();
    return $release_info;
}
 is there a way to get more useful information from my uname on Ubuntu? Linux geisterhaufen 3.11.0-15-generic #23-Ubuntu SMP Mon Dec 9 18:17:04 UTC 2013 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
 especially find out the distribution (saucy "Ubuntu 13.10") from the part "uname_version_info" which is this on my machine: #23-Ubuntu SMP Mon Dec 9 18:17:04 UTC 2013

@TITLE:Reading a float value from standard input and using in time.sleep
@CONTENT:I'm currently struggling with simple code, it works with seconds but I want to allow users to use minutes instead, which is much easier. Here it is: import time
import os
import math
import subprocess

input1 = raw_input("Broj minuta:")
min = input1 * 60
min1 = float(min)
print min1
time.sleep(min1)
os.system("shutdown")
 I get this error: Broj minuta:2
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "timer.py", line 8, in <module>
    time.sleep(min)
TypeError: a float is required
 When I try to convert it to float using code below, it says that sleep time is big, and it is, if I choose 2 minutes I get: min = input1 * 60
min1 = float(min)

Broj minuta:2
2.22222222222e+59

@TITLE:Calculate sum of 1+(1/2!)+K+(1/n!) n number in C language
@CONTENT:Like the title say, how I calculate the sum of n number of the form: 1+(1/2!)+?(1/n!)? I already got the code for the harmonic series: #include <stdio.h>

int main( void )
{
    int v=0,i,ch;
    double x=0.;

    printf("Introduce un n?mero paracalcular la suma: ");
    while(scanf("%d",&v)==0 || v<=0)
    {

        while((ch=getchar())!='\n')
            if(ch==EOF)
                return 1;
    }
    for (i=v; i>=1; i--)
        x+=1./i;

    printf("EL valor de la serie es %f\n", x);
    getch();
    return 0;
}
 The question here is.. I already got the sum as the fraction, but how make the variable "i" factorial? Note: I?m programming in language C, with DEV -C++ 4.9.9.2
@CODE:#include <stdio.h>

@TITLE:How does Java call object's function?
@CONTENT:From what I read before, after .java file compiles to .class files, every object is simply Object after erasure. Such as Foo f = new Foo();
 Compiles to .class file, and decompile, it becomes: Object f = new Foo();
 So how does JRE call the function of an object when running? Where is the function stored in the memory? Inside the object? Or with a hierarchy of class structure and does lookup up the hierarchy?
@CODE:.java .class Object Foo f = new Foo(); .class Object f = new Foo(); Foo f = new Foo(); class

@TITLE:TreeMap<Integer, Integer> remove not working
@CONTENT:I'm trying to get the top 10 elements of a TreeMap by executing this loop:         TreeMap<Integer, Integer> sortedMap = sortMap(m);
        String outString = "";
        int count = 10;
        while (count > 0) {
            count--;
            Integer k = sortedMap.firstKey();
            outString += String.valueOf(k);
            sortedMap.remove(k);
            if (count != 0) {
                outString += ",";
            }
        }

        System.out.println("outVal is " + outVal);

           TreeMap<Integer,Integer> sorted_map = new TreeMap<Integer,Integer>(bvc);
           sorted_map.putAll(map);
           return sorted_map;
        }

class ValueComparator implements Comparator<Integer> {
    java.util.Map<Integer, Integer> base;
    public ValueComparator(java.util.Map<Integer, Integer> base) {
        this.base = base;
    }

    // Note: this comparator imposes orderings that are inconsistent with equals.    
    public int compare(Integer a, Integer b) {
        if (base.get(a) >= base.get(b)) {
            return -1;
        } else {
            return 1;

@TITLE:Listening to two ports simultaneously in Java server using multithreading
@CONTENT:I am building a simple Java server which simultaneously listens for client request on two ports simultaneously using two ServerSocket instances. Here is the code for Server: import java.io.PrintWriter;
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.net.ServerSocket;
import java.net.Socket;

class Socket1 implements Runnable
{
    public void run()
    {
        try
        {
            ServerSocket serverSock=new ServerSocket(5000);
            while(true)
            {
                Socket sock=serverSock.accept();
                PrintWriter writer=new PrintWriter(sock.getOutputStream());
                String text="Welcome to Port 5000";
                writer.println(text);
            }
        }
        catch(Exception e)
        {
            System.out.println("Error");
        }
    }
}

class Socket2 implements Runnable
{
    public void run()
    {
        try
        {
            ServerSocket serverSock=new ServerSocket(3000);
            while(true)
            {
                Socket sock=serverSock.accept();
                PrintWriter writer=new PrintWriter(sock.getOutputStream());
                String text="Welcome to Port 3000";
                writer.println(text);
            }
        }
        catch(Exception e)
        {
            System.out.println("Error");
        }
    }
}

public class Server
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Socket1 s1=new Socket1();
        Socket2 s2=new Socket2();
        Thread t1=new Thread(s1);
        Thread t2=new Thread(s2);
        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
} 
 Now code for Client1: import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.net.Socket;

public class Client1
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        try
        {
            Socket s=new Socket("127.0.0.1", 5000);
            InputStreamReader streamReader=new InputStreamReader(s.getInputStream());
            BufferedReader reader=new BufferedReader(streamReader);
            String text=reader.readLine();
            System.out.println(text);
            reader.close();
        }
        catch(Exception e)
        {
            System.out.println("Error");
        }
    }
}
 Client2 contains the same code as Client1, the only difference being that it tries to connect to port 3000. Now, I execute Server.java first using command prompt. While the server blocks, I open two separate command prompts and execute Client1.java on one command prompt and Client2.java on the other command prompt. But, both clients go to blocking state and I get no output. Any idea how to solve this ?

 I've also tried using history.go(-1) as well. Problem is, the browser doesn't navigate back in history in Safari on iOS, or when the app is saved to the home screen as a web app. One thing i find weird however is that it works fine in Chrome on Safari, as Chrome actually is the Safari browser engine. I know it have worked before, but doesn't anymore for some reason. The iPad is running iOS 7.0.4.

@TITLE:Using jaxws-maven-plugin with -clientjar option
@CONTENT:I'm using jaxws-maven-plugin to execute wsimport for a web service consumer app. I'm using the -clientjar option on wsimport which was introduced with JAX-WS 2.2.2 RI in 2010. I do this because I want to bundle the WSDL within the jar. I don't have a problem crafting the pom. For plugin configuration I do something like: <configuration>
    ...
    <args>
        <arg>-clientjar</arg>
        <arg>bundled-wsdl.jar</arg>
    </args>
</configuration>
 When I execute a build my created jar, lets call it myapp.jar, has file bundled-wsdl.jar within it. Inside the bundled-wsdl.jar's META-INF directory I find the wsdl and xsd just as I like them. I'm also quite happy with the generated java code that come as a result of using the -clientjar option. So far so good. But this stuff should be in myapp.jar's META-INF, right? The fact that it sits within bundled-wsdl.jar's META-INF doesn't help me a lot. The funny thing is that I do in fact get a wsdl file in myapp.jar's META-INF which makes the application actually work. How it gets there I don't know. Also the xsd file isn't there, only in bundled-wsdl.jar's META-INF. The basic question is how to correctly use wsimport -clientjar option in a Maven project ? Java 1.7.0_45.
@CODE:-clientjar <configuration>
    ...
    <args>
        <arg>-clientjar</arg>

I am receiving the following error message: nvcc : fatal error : nvcc cannot find a supported version of Microsoft Visual Studio. Only the versions 2008, 2010, and 2012 are supported
 I have seen precedent of people getting VC2010 Express compiling with CUDA Toolkit 5.0, e.g., in this thread https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/535527/?comment=3762165 Therefore, I cannot understand what critical difference there would be, just because it's CUDA 5.5 and not 5.0. Would it make a difference that it's VC Express and not VC Professional? Why would that matter where compiling is concerned? Do Pro and Express really use very different compilers?

Adding zero to it ? +0 also does nothing.

@TITLE:Combine custom authentication filter with spring-security-kerberos
@CONTENT:I'm using spring-security-kerberos to authenticate the remote users - this works well. The problem that I have is that sometimes users do not have the kerberos ticket in place and I need to use another form of authentication. I've wrote my own Authentication Provider (myCusomAuthenticationProvider) for this purpose. This custom provider should ask the user for BASIC authentication and uses several LDAP servers to authenticate the user based on username and password. The problem that I see is that my custom authentication manager always gets KerberosServiceRequestToken as the authentication token and I don't manage to get UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken. How can I make the server return both "Negotiate" and "Basic" methods to the browser and have my own provider handle the basic authentication? I've found a way to do it with some tweaks to the spring-security-kerberos code but I'm trying to find a better way to do this. web.xml: http://pastebin.com/embed.php?i=ZidnBMwZ root-context-with-krb.xml: http://pastebin.com/c8vfUZfV

@TITLE:Blank PNG / Tainted canvases may not be exported (not using images)
@CONTENT:I am trying to export a fairly simple html to canvas and then png. To do so, I am using rasterizeHTML (http://cburgmer.github.io/rasterizeHTML.js/). The problem that I am facing is that I get a warning like if I was loading an external image/resource, but I am not. This is what I have tried: HTML: <canvas height="500" width="500" id="rasterizer"></canvas>
 Javascript var canvas=document.getElementById("rasterizer");
rasterizeHTML.drawHTML('<div width="300px" height="300px" > <div style="width: 200px;height: 200px;position: absolute;top: 50%;left: 50%;margin: -100px 0 0 -100px;"><div style="width: 100%;height: 100%;border-radius: 50%;position: absolute;top: 0;left: 0;margin: 0;z-index: 1;background: #e4f1ea; ">            </div>            <div style="border-radius: 50%;position: absolute;top: 50%;left: 50%;z-index: 3;background: #b6cfe1;width:73.997475122531%; height:73.997475122531%; margin:-36.998737561265% 0 0 -36.998737561265%"></div>        </div></div>',canvas);
canvas.toDataURL("image/png");
 The html just renders 2 circles, one above the other. Rasterizer is able to show this in the canvas with no problem, but then when I try to run .toDataURL I end up with one of two issues: A blank image (if it is the first time I run the code) the same size as the canvas. SecurityError: Failed to execute 'toDataURL' on 'HTMLCanvasElement': tainted canvases may not be exported. I am out of ideas, since this should happen with external resources, not with fully inline-d html. Anyone know why this could happen? Thanks.
@CODE:<canvas height="500" width="500" id="rasterizer"></canvas> var canvas=document.getElementById("rasterizer");

I am stuck at the moment trying to pass the value of a defined parameter into findOneByIndex. So if I do the following $script = $repository->findOneByIndex(1); it works perfectly. But if I do the following $script = $repository->findOneByIndex($user); it fails to search with the value of user.

Rather than provide a UI for these I was told to just set up a blank config and if the values weren't set provide a message to say where the config was and to go set them. This turned out to be remarkably difficult! The things I needed to be able to do were as follows: get the path to the config save a blank config with stubs for the relevant properties The tool was being released using CC.net and an msi created using wix.

@TITLE:How to get devise to work with multiple models or roles? (Preferably with CanCan and rolify)
@CONTENT:Using devise, what is the best way to have multiple models or roles? Here are the models or roles I need in my app: -Author: can upload content to the site
-Customer: pays a monthly fee to access the content
 A user can be both an Author and a Customer. I think they can share the same login form because they will both log in with their email address. I have tried using CanCan and rolify, but couldn't figure out how to add different roles during registration. When a user registers as an Author, he should be given the "author" role and when a user registers by paying the monthly fee, he should be given the "customer" role. I don't want to use a checkbox for the roles either. There is a nav link called "Authors" that will allow authors to register and then there is a link for users to register by going through the payment and billing form. Based on which link is clicked, should determine which role is given. Should I pass in a role parameter in the url during registration like "user/sign_up/index?role=customer"? If so, how do I get devise to use this in the registration process? Using devise, CanCan, and rolify, how can I solve this? I thought it might be better to have a User class and then have Customer and Author extend from User, but from reading many similar questions on StackOverflow it seems rolify is easier. I know what I am trying to do is very basic, I just haven't figured it out yet. I have been trying to find a solution for this all day. Update: Danny's answer below pushed me in the right direction and I have managed to get the roles added properly during registration by passing in a parameter in the URL "users/sign_up?role=customer" or "users/sign_up?role=author". I don't know if this is the best way, but that's what I have so far. One question I have though is how will my has_many relations work now? Here is what I have: class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    rolify
    devise :database_authenticatable, :registerable,
         :recoverable, :rememberable, :trackable, :validatable

    has_one :plan
    has_many :files

end
 has_one :plan is for the customer's subscription plan and has_many :files is for the author who can upload many files that the customer can download The problem is that I would also like to keep track of the user's file downloads so I would like to put has_many :downloads or probably has_many :files, :through => :downloads Does it matter if I put these in the User model knowing that an author who is not a customer is not allowed to download files and that a customer who is not an author cannot upload files?

@TITLE:How to convert strings to variables for import? python
@CONTENT:I can use the following code to change a string to a variable and then call function of the library that was previously imported. >>> import sys
>>> x = 'sys'
>>> globals()[x]
<module 'sys' (built-in)>
>>> globals()[x].__doc__
 Without first importing the module, I have an string to variable but I can't use the same globals()[var] syntax with import: >>> y = 'os'
>>> globals()[y]
<module 'os' from '/usr/lib/python2.7/os.pyc'>
>>> import globals()[y]
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    import globals()[y]
                  ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

>>> z = globals()[y]
>>> import z
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: No module named z
 Is it possible for a string input and import the library that has the same name as the string input? If so, how? @ndpu and @paulobu has answered that __import__() allows string to library access as a variable. But is there a problem with using the same variable name rather than using an alternate for the library? E.g.: >>> x = 'sys'
>>> sys = __import__(x)
@CODE:>>> import sys
>>> x = 'sys'
>>> globals()[x]
<module 'sys' (built-in)>
>>> globals()[x].__doc__ globals()[var] import >>> y = 'os'
>>> globals()[y]
<module 'os' from '/usr/lib/python2.7/os.pyc'>
>>> import globals()[y]
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    import globals()[y]
                  ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

>>> z = globals()[y]
>>> import z
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: No module named z __import__() >>> x = 'sys'
>>> sys = __import__(x)

@TITLE:What is the hostname while invoking GetAddrInfo(K) in Bonjour 1.0
@CONTENT:I scanned through my local home network using Bonjour 1.0(.NET) for services with regtype = "_http._tcp":  DNSSDService service = new DNSSDService();

@TITLE:overlaying a basemap on contours
@CONTENT:This question is a follow-up to an earlier question and from @JoeKington here. Both of these solutions work excellently for my needs. However I have been trying to overlay a basemap on the contours. Going by the example here http://matplotlib.org/basemap/users/examples.html, I do not seem to get it right. I think my basic problem is to convert the contour x,y values into map coordinates. I reproduce below the codes for 1) contours (as given by @usethedeathstar, which works very well) and 2) the map object and the plotting. #!/usr/bin/python

        for i, l in enumerate(A1):
            li = l.split()
            A[i,0] = float(li[0])
            A[i,1] = float(li[1])
            A[i,2] = float(li[2])
        self.Lon = A[:,0]
        self.Lat = A[:,1]
        self.Z = A[:,2]

 Any assistance will be appreciated I would like to thank all those who have looked at my problem and may have tried to work on it. By consistent trying, it has come to my attention that the overlaying of the basemap on the contours actually works with the following lines After the map object definition m = Basemap(projection = 'merc',llcrnrlon = 21, llcrnrlat = -18, urcrnrlon = 34, urcrnrlat = -8, resolution='h')
 I have x, y = m(xi, yi)
fig=plt.figure(figsize=(8,4.5))
cs = m.contour(x,y,zi,colors='b',linewidths=1.)
 Contour(x,y,zi) plots the contours on the map. Since I was using contourf, I still have to find out why contourf does not give me the filled contours. Thank you very much all for the patience and tolerance.

@CONTENT:This is part 2 of a problem that was already answered by peterm on this board. Thanks again peterm! So I have code that will return the top 3 test scores for a given student. My table looks like the following: StudentID, Test ID, Score 1,1, 95 1, 2, 90 1, 3, 90 1, 4, 90 2, 1, 99 2, 2, 95 2, 3, 90 2, 4, 90 Thanks to peterm, I have the following code which will do this for me: SELECT StudentID, TestID, TestScore
  FROM MyTable t
 WHERE TestID IN
(
  SELECT TOP 3 TestID 
    FROM MyTable
   WHERE StudentID = t.StudentID 
   ORDER BY TestScore DESC, TestID
)
 ORDER BY StudentID, TestScore DESC, TestID;
 My new problem is now I need to add two new fields to the table for Subject and Year, so I need to find the top 3 scores for each Subject-Student-Year combination. Once I have the top 3 scores for each combination, I need to average them so that I will have one averaged score of the top 3 scores for each student-subject-year combination. Hopefully, I've explained this clearly enough without having to mock up another table. Thanks in advance.
@CODE:SELECT StudentID, TestID, TestScore
  FROM MyTable t
 WHERE TestID IN
(
  SELECT TOP 3 TestID 
    FROM MyTable
   WHERE StudentID = t.StudentID 
   ORDER BY TestScore DESC, TestID
)
 ORDER BY StudentID, TestScore DESC, TestID;

@CONTENT:Is there any Adb command to set the volume to a particular value? I know that we can do adb shell input keyevent 
 for volume up and down but i want to set it to a particular value. If I change it it DB then I have to reboot the device for the changes to be reflected so i do not want to go that path. Isn't there any API where I can change the value without having to restart it and having to be dependent on Volume up and Down?

Button ok;
EditText name;

@Override
public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

 so please how would i reuse this?

@TITLE:how to preserve pandas dataframe identity when extracting a single row
@CONTENT:I am extracting a subset of my dataframe by index using either .xs or .loc (they seem to behave the same). When my condition retrieves multiple rows, the result stays a dataframe. When only a single row is retrieved, it is automatically converted to a series. I don't want that behavior, since that means I need to handle multiple cases downstream (different method sets available for series vs dataframe). In [1]: df = pd.DataFrame({'a':range(7), 'b':['one']*4 + ['two'] + ['three']*2,
 'c':range(10,17)})

In [2]: df.set_index('b', inplace=True)

In [3]: df.xs('one')
Out[3]:
     a   c
b
one  0  10
one  1  11
one  2  12
one  3  13

In [4]: df.xs('two')
Out[4]:
a     4
c    14
Name: two, dtype: int64

In  [5]: type(df.xs('two'))
Out [5]: pandas.core.series.Series
 I can manually convert that series back to a dataframe, but it seems cumbersome and will also require case testing to see if I should do that. Is there a cleaner way to just get a dataframe back to begin with?

@TITLE:2d array, pushing to one array shows up in all arrays?
@CONTENT:I'm new to ruby so I'm clearly misunderstanding something. I intended to create an array of size 2, where each element is itself an array, then push items to one or the other sub-array: #!/usr/bin/env ruby

@TITLE:python: Convert a for loop into a recursion function
@CONTENT:First of all, I'm still a newb to python so please take it easy on me. I've done my research and I have a basic understanding of how to write a recursive function, but I'm totally confused at the task ahead of me. I would really like some tips and pointers so I can do this myself to really understand. Here's the task: Iterate through a dictionary check if there is a 'children' key if true, do something repeat Here's the issue, The 'option' key is nested in another key called 'children'. There for I would like to iterate through each 'children' key until they exist no more. Here's what the code looks like without recursion. Of course it fails because its too explicate, too rigid. #level(one/two/three) refer to the level of nesting, easier for me to know where I am     in the loop.
#qdf_v2 is a particular type of file which is essentially a dictionary 

for levelone in qdf_v2['children']:
    if 'children' in levelone:
        store = options
        for leveltwo in levelone['children']:
            if 'children' in leveltwo:
                store = options
                for levelthree in leveltwo['children']:
                    if 'children' in levellevel:
                        repeat....
 I would like to loop through the dictionary and it's 'children' key until they don't exist anymore. Here's some JSON you can copy and past this in http://www.jsoneditoronline.org/ to see what I'm working with. {

@LINK:/questions/21048886/how-do-i-avoid-the-service-locator-pattern-should-i
@TITLE:How do I avoid the service locator pattern? Should I?
@CONTENT:I'm currently working on a WinForms system (I know) where there's a lot of Constructor Injection when creating forms, but if those forms/views need to open another form, I find the DI container has been injected too so that we can locate the implementation of the desired view interface at runtime. e.g. public partial class MyView : Form, IMyView
{
    private readonly IDIContainer _container;

    public MyView(IDIContainer container)
    {
        InitializeComponent();

        _container = container;
    }

    public OpenDialogClick(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        var dialog = container.Resolve<IDialogView>();
        dialog.ShowDialog(this);
    }
}
 I'm aware that this is basically using the container as a service locator. I've been repeatedly told that this is considered an anti-pattern so I'd like to avoid this usage. I could probably inject the view as part of the constructor like this : public partial class MyView : Form, IMyView
{
    private readonly IDialogView _dialog;

    public MyView(IDialogView dialog)
    {
        InitializeComponent();

        _dialog = dialog;
    }

    public OpenDialogClick(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        dialog.ShowDialog(this);
    }
}
 But what if the dialog view is quite expensive to instantiate? It's been suggested that we create some kind of form factory which internally uses the DI container, but to me this seems like simply creating a wrapper around another service locator. I know that at some point, something has to know how to create an IDialogView, so I'm thinking that either it's resolved when the composite root is created (probably not ideal if there are many forms and some or all are expensive to create), or the composite root itself has a way to resolve the dependency. In which case the composite root has to have a service-locator-like dependency? But then how would child forms create dialogs like this? Would they call up to the composite via, say, events, to open dialogs like this? One particular problem I keep running up against is that the container is almost impossible to mock easily. This is partly what keeps me thinking about the form factory idea, even though it would just be a wrapper around the container. Is that a sensible reason? Have I thought myself into a knot? Is there a simple way through this? Or do I just cut the knot and find something that works for me?
@CODE:Constructor Injection public partial class MyView : Form, IMyView
{
    private readonly IDIContainer _container;

    public MyView(IDIContainer container)
    {
        InitializeComponent();

        _container = container;
    }

    public OpenDialogClick(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        var dialog = container.Resolve<IDialogView>();
        dialog.ShowDialog(this);
    }
} public partial class MyView : Form, IMyView
{
    private readonly IDialogView _dialog;

    public MyView(IDialogView dialog)
    {
        InitializeComponent();

        _dialog = dialog;
    }

    public OpenDialogClick(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        dialog.ShowDialog(this);
    }

@TITLE:Symfony2 Container Aware Form Type
@CONTENT:Is there a way to make a form type container aware? As an example I have 3 entities Account, User and Event. Users have ManyToMany relationship in order to associate many users with many other users (called approvers), reason for this is so that an Event created by a User can have a list of Users who area able approve it. In the User edit form where I have an approvers multiple select field the list needs to be filtered by Account so I need my form type to be container aware in order to filter the list of available Users by Account ID. Am I right in thinking that making the form type container aware is the right way to go? I'd like to use the entity manager to filter a list of Users by Account.

@TITLE:How to use Firebase rules to only give permission to certain leaf nodes
@CONTENT:My basic question is how do you setup Firebase rules to only allow access certain leaf nodes from their parent? Lets say I have data that looks like this: root: {
  posts: {
    post1: {
      user: "foo",
      post: "this is a post",
      restricted: false
    },
    post2: {
      user: "bar",
      post: "this is another post",
      restricted: true
    },
    post3: {
      user: "bar",
      post: "this is my final post",
      restricted: false
    }
  }
}
 I want to $bind to the posts node and get all the posts which that user is allowed to get. I might want the admin to access all of the posts but non-admins to only be able to access post1 and post3. Note: I'm using angularFire's $bind to synchronize nodes. I don't believe this is possible but I would like to be able to set up my rules kinda like this: {
  "rules": {
    "posts": {
      ".read": "auth.admin || $post.hasChild('restricted').val() !== true",
      "$post": {
      }
    }
  }
}
 How are other users accomplishing this? Thanks.
@CODE:root: {
  posts: {
    post1: {
      user: "foo",
      post: "this is a post",

    post2: {
      user: "bar",
      post: "this is another post",
      restricted: true
    },
    post3: {
      user: "bar",
      post: "this is my final post",
      restricted: false
    }
  }
} $bind {
  "rules": {

      "$post": {
      }

@TITLE:X264 Error message when capturing video
@CONTENT:I'm writing a program to save some webcam video to a file. I'm using the x264 codec found here x264 When I try writing frames to a file I get this error message poping up. x264vfw [warning]: Few frames probably would be lost. Ways to fix this: x264vfw [warning]: -if you use VirtualDub or its fork than you can enable 'VirtualDub Hack' option x264vfw [warning]: -you can enable 'File' output mode x264vfw [warning]: -you can enable 'Zero Latency' option I found this VirtualDub Hack but then I'm not using virtual dub. I'm not sure what the File output mode and zero latency mean. I think the problem is related to the codec since when I change to using a different codec, everything works fine.

@TITLE:passing arguments to function with a view to plotting with ggplot stat_function
@CONTENT:I have a function and a list of arguments. F <- function(a,b,...) {a^b+b/a}
L <- list("a" = 5, "b" = 2, "c" = 0)
 I want to replace one of the arguments ("a", "b" or "c") with an unknown x (or "x") and plot with ggplot's stat_function. These computations are part of a shiny app, where the user will 1) select a parameter from a drop-down list, say "a", to be the unknown, and 2) use sliders to select values of the other parameters. The numbers 5, 2, 0 in L are the default parameter values, to be used before user interaction. There are several such functions. Here the list of parameters L has an element not used in F. I've been stuck on this for so long that I can't think straight anymore. Of the many things I've tried, here's one: # select a parameter to vary:
Y <- "a"
f1 <- function(f = F, l = L, y = Y, x, ...){
  l[y] <- x # replace "a" with x
  do.call(f, l, ...)
}

# make a stat_function ggplot:
library("ggplot2")
df <- data.frame(x = c(0,10))
p <- ggplot(df, aes(x))
p <- p + stat_function(fun = f1)
print(p)
 This returns the following error: Error in (function (f = F, l = L, y = Y, x, ...)  : 
  argument "x" is missing, with no default
Error in as.environment(where) : 'where' is missing
 I have tried several variants, including: setting l[y] <- "x" and using aes_string instead of aes. I have also tried backquotes around x. I have read through the documentation about environments, so I've tried defining an environment, wrapping x and just about everything around eval or quote. I've even tried voodoo. I've lost count of how many hours I've spent on this. A suggestion to read the manual or a hint without an explanation will kill me. 8-) If my question is unclear, please let me know and I will clarify. Thanks!

@CONTENT:I am using prepared statements to prevent sql injection. I want to know if i am in right track or not to prevent sql injection using prepared statement. Below is an example html form. <form action="" method="post" name="ff" id="ff">
<input type="text" name="input1">
<input type="text" name="input2">
<input type="submit" value="submit" name="submit">
</form>
 Now when submitting the above form then i am using the following php code with prepared statements. if(isset($_POST["submit"]))
{
    $query = "insert INTO table (input1,input2) VALUES (?,?)";
    $stmt = mysqli_prepare($link, $query);
    mysqli_stmt_bind_param($stmt, "ss", $_REQUEST["input1"], $_REQUEST["input2"]);
    $result = mysqli_stmt_execute($stmt);
    if ( false===$result ) {
        die('Statement failed: '.$stmt->error);
    }

 Please tell me if the above php code with prepared statement is fine or not to prevent sql injection thing. Also please confirm that i'm using user input as a parameter for prepared statement and not building the SQL command by joining strings together.

self.region.notifyEntryStateOnDisplay = YES;

 So this is the basic setup and for my test app i want to show a local notification when my phone is in immediate proximity of the beacon. My problem is that it won't work unless i include the line below. [self.locationManager startUpdatingLocation];
 Can anyone explain why that is or if i'm missing something about iBeacons?

 I don't have any style in the manifest as my app takes Theme.Sherlock directly. My ABS version is the last 4.4.0 and I am trying to run my app in an API 11 emulator (API 8 leads to the same result). API 18 works fine. After a little debugging in Eclipse, it looks that the following returns both null views (ActionBarView.java): @Override
protected void onFinishInflate() {
    mUpView = findViewById(R.id.abs__up);
    mIconView = (ImageView) findViewById(R.id.abs__home);
}
 and of course the subsequent calls are returning the NPE. It also looks like I have some warning in my LogCat: 01-08 22:54:20.093: I/dalvikvm(626): Could not find method com.actionbarsherlock.internal.nineoldandroids.widget.NineFrameLayout.onHoverEvent, referenced from method com.actionbarsherlock.internal.widget.ActionBarContainer.onHoverEvent

 What can be my problem? PS.: I use Eclipse + Maven and include both android-v4 support 19.0.1 and NineOldAndroids 2.4.0. EDIT After some other debugging it looks like the generated resource numbers in ActionBarSherlock and R.txt (target/ folder generated by Maven) are not the same. Checking in the debugger, I have: R.txt -> int layout abs__action_bar_home 0x7f030000 | Debug -> same
R.txt -> int id abs__up 0x7f07000b | Debug -> ox7f04000b
R.txt -> int id abs__home 0x7f07000a | Debug -> 0x7f04000a
 UPDATE It looks like there is a problem while importing apklibs...something goes wrong with the R compilation. The workaround is to remove the the custom resources that misalign the ids of abs__* ones and mess up the numbering. For instance I did the following: I checked where ActionBarSherlock was failing, for me it was while loading the resource R.id.abs__up. I have got the resource number from my R.java file and note it down (0x7f07XXXX); I removed all the resources before 0x7f07XXXX, cleaned the project, regenerated R. I wanted to align back R.id.abs__up to its apklib number (0x7f04000b). I had to remove three folders (anim/, xml/ , raw/) and three actual resources from my string xml. Now R.id.abs__up had the correct number in my compiled R.java. See discussion here.

@TITLE:How to create HttpWebRequest without interrupting async/await?
@CONTENT:I have a bunch of slow functions that are essentially this: private async Task<List<string>> DownloadSomething()
{
    var request = System.Net.WebRequest.Create("https://valid.url");

    ...

    using (var ss = await request.GetRequestStreamAsync())
    { 
        await ss.WriteAsync(...);
    }

    using (var rr = await request.GetResponseAsync())
    using (var ss = rr.GetResponseStream())
    {
        //read stream and return data
    }

}
 This works nicely and asynchronously except for the call to WebRequest.Create - this single line freezes the UI thread for several seconds which sort of ruins the purpose of async/await. I already have this code written using BackgroundWorkers, which works perfectly and never freezes the UI. Still, what is the correct, idiomatic way to create a web request with respect to async/await? Or maybe there is another class that should be used? I've seen this nice answer about asyncifying a WebRequest, but even there the object itself is created synchronously.
@CODE:private async Task<List<string>> DownloadSomething()
{
    var request = System.Net.WebRequest.Create("https://valid.url");

    ...

    using (var ss = await request.GetRequestStreamAsync())

    }

    using (var rr = await request.GetResponseAsync())
    using (var ss = rr.GetResponseStream())
    {
        //read stream and return data
    }

} WebRequest.Create BackgroundWorker WebRequest

@TITLE:Three js rotation of objects around a sphere
@CONTENT:I am using a particle system to evenly distribute points on a sphere. That works great. I then place instances of a given geometry on those points. This part also works. I would now like to rotate those geometries to match the surface angle of the sphere. Here is the function so far : function placeGeometryAtPlatonicPoints (points) {
  var len = points.length -1,
    x, y, z,
    geometry,
    // subgroup a group to apply the rotations to
    subgroup = new THREE.Object3D(),

    }),
    r,
    theta,
    varphi;

  // I wait to append this group because I am waiting for the 
  // particles to settle into there positions
  scene.add(group);

  for (len; len >= 0; len -= 1) {
    // Geometry could be any geometry I am just using a cube to test.
    geometry = new THREE.CubeGeometry( 25, 25, 25, 1, 1, 1 );
    x = points[len].x;
    y = points[len].y;
    z = points[len].z;

    // Move the geometry to the point on the sphere. 
    geometry.applyMatrix( new THREE.Matrix4().makeTranslation(x, y, z) );

    mesh = new THREE.Mesh( geometry, material );
    subgroup.add(mesh);

    // This next portion is just some guess work about 
    // polar and azimuth coordinates
    r = Math.sqrt(Math.pow(x,2) + Math.pow(y,2) + Math.pow(z,2));
    theta = Math.acos(z/r);
    varphi = Math.atan(y/x);

    theta = theta * (180/Math.PI);
    varphi = varphi * (180/Math.PI);

    console.log({
      theta : theta,
      varphi : varphi
    });

    // This would be the implementation of the rotation degrees.
    subgroup.rotation.x = 0;
    subgroup.rotation.y = 0;
    subgroup.rotation.z = 0;

    group.add(subgroup);
  }
}
 I am new to Three js, so if there is a better way to do all of this please let me know. Here is my WIP. You will have to give it a second to place the particle correctly before rendering the geometry. I could speed this up but i like the animation : )

 Now the problem is that the size of the controls on the column 0 is diminishing when i pull the gridsplitter to the RIGHT, on the other hand the size of the controls of the column 0 is increasing while pulling the gridsplitter to the left. I already found this link on stack that suggested to change the first column's width to Auto. The problem is : if i do that, the controls does not resize anymore. How can i do so that my controls get all the width available ? (with the expected gridsplitter behaviour) ?

@TITLE:Fetch Data from HTML Website using VBA - FREEMAPTOOLS.COM
@CONTENT:I am trying to input a post code into this website and pull the results into Excel using VBA http://www.freemaptools.com/find-uk-postcodes-inside-radius.htm In short you input a post code and set a radius either in miles or KM and it gives you all the post codes within that area. As you can imagine this tool would be very useful! This is what I have so far: Set ie = CreateObject("InternetExplorer.Application")
ie.Visible = 0

url = "http://www.freemaptools.com/find-uk-postcodes-inside-radius.htm" 
ie.Navigate url


state = 0
Do Until state = 4
DoEvents
state = ie.readyState
Loop
 It would be good if say cell A1 had the post code and cell A2 had the distance in KM. This script would then look at this as the variable. I am not 100% sure put I think I then need to Parse the result to put them each into there own cell. Any help with this would be incredible!

@CONTENT:I want to have one table which will display half the rows, then wrap and display the other half of the rows next to it horizontally instead of having one long vertical table. I'm using angular and want to be able to bind one array of data to one table but have it span two sections horizontally like described. Two tables is an option but it means I'll have to add much more logic which I'd prefer to avoid if possible. i.e. For sorting Id have to join the datasets back together and sort them, before splitting again. Any pointers appreciated.

@TITLE:R - multiple nested loops
@CONTENT:I am trying to write a nested loop code to simulate 10 columns of data in a data frame with 101 rows. The first row of data has been assigned as starting values. Each column should be different as my matrix r is generated from random normals; however, the resulting values in each column are exactly the same. To give some context for the looping indices: tmax=100; ncol(pop_sims) = 12 (so a total of 10 iterations, 3-12); ncol(r) = 10

for (i in 1:tmax){
 for (j in 3:ncol(pop_sims)){

@TITLE:Showing m.bing.com in the WP8 WebBrowser control
@CONTENT:I'm having a problem getting bing.com to load in a WebBrowser control on Windows Phone 8. It seems that doing that will launch the WP8 Search App (same as pressing the Search button on the phone). The problem is, once you click a result in that search app, it doesn't take you back to your original app - it goes to IE to show the result. This isn't going to work for me and seems to be a massive flaw (IMO) in the WebBrowser behavior. There does seem to be a few apps out there that have succeeded in being able to show bing.com without launching the phone's search app - for example Image Downloader Free. There was another one, but I can't remember what it was... After some research, I've found that the WebBrowser_Navigating event gets fired 3 times when going to bing.com: first request to the user-entered URL (www.bing.com), it then gets redirected to http://wp.m.bing.com/?mid=10006, then it redirects to bing://home/?mid=10006. Preventing it from forwarding to the Bing search app is quite simple, just add this to the Navigating event: e.Cancel = (e.Uri.Scheme == "bing");
 The problem is, it then only shows the Bing search page place holder which says "Bing Search" and has a link that says "Back to Bing search" which does nothing (it would typically relaunch the Bing Search app). I have a few thoughts, but I'm not sure how feasible they are. In the WP8 WebBrowser control, is it possible to fake the User Agent? Can one of the items in the WebBrowser.Uri.Flags property be removed or added to affect the way Bing.com handles the request? If none of those work, I can simply create a dummy page on my web server, redirect all bing.com requests to it, and have it grab the m.bing.com front page with a card-coded user-agent. I really would like to avoid having to do this option though. From an End-User perspective, they would never know, but I just added a whole new layer of overhead, maintenance and resource-wise. If you're interested, attached are the diff's for the EventArgs object between the 3 requests that occur in the WebBrowser.Navigating event: Request 1 (bing.com) -> Request 2 (forwarded to wp.m.bing.com/?mid=10006) Request 2 (forwarded to wp.m.bing.com/?mid=10006) -> Request 3 (forwarded to bing://home/?mid=10006) tl;dr Does anyone know of a way to prevent www.bing.com from causing the search app to launch in the WebBrowser control in my application? Thank you!

@TITLE:Win 32 C++, Drawing a draggable rectangle to the screen
@CONTENT:This is a problem I've been having for a while now. I'm trying to have a draggable rectangle to show the user an area that they've selected in my screenshot program. The reason I want this is for users to be able to select a portion of the screen that they want to take a screenshot of. I have tried the following method with little success: void drawRect(){
HDC screenDC = ::GetDC(0);
::Rectangle(screenDC, 200, 200, 300, 300);
::ReleaseDC(0, screenDC);
}
 Now, to give this method due credit, it does draw a rectangle to the screen in a way that I'd expect however once the dragging has stopped the rectangle persists. I've looked at ways of getting rid of this such as updating the windows where the rectangle continues to be shown however I haven't managed to remove it. Further to this problem since you must redraw the rectangle every monitor refresh and the rectangles persist, I am left with lots of rectangles being drawn all over the screen and I then have to mouse over or click on any windows these are drawn over to remove them.
@CODE:void drawRect(){
HDC screenDC = ::GetDC(0);
::Rectangle(screenDC, 200, 200, 300, 300);

 If I use newdata <- na.omit(data) where data is the above table loaded via R, then I get only two data points. I get that since it will filter all instances of NA. What I want to do is to filter for each A and B so that I get three data points for A and only two for B. Clearly, my main data set is much larger than that and the numbers are different but neither should not matter. How can I achieve that?
@CODE:date       A  B
2014-01-01 2  3
2014-01-02 5  NA
2014-01-03 NA NA
2014-01-04 7  11 newdata <- na.omit(data) data A B A B

@TITLE:Can't define ++ operator in C++, what's the issue here?
@CONTENT:I'm working through Bjarne Stroustrup's The C++ Programming Language and I'm stuck on one of the examples. Here's the code, and aside from whitespace differences and comments my code is identical to what's in the book (p.51). enum class Traffic_light { green, yellow, red};
int main(int argc, const char * argv[])
{
    Traffic_light light = Traffic_light::red;
//    DEFINING OPERATORS FOR ENUM CLASSES
//    enum classes don't have all the operators, must define them manually.
    Traffic_light& operator++(Traffic_light& t) {
        switch (t) {
            case Traffic_light::green:
                return t = Traffic_light::yellow;
            case Traffic_light::yellow:
                return t = Traffic_light::red;
            case Traffic_light::red:
                return t = Traffic_light::green;
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
 Yet when I compile it with clang++ -std=c++11 -stdlib=libc++ -Weverything main.cpp on Mac OS X 10.9 I get the following errors: main.cpp:24:9: error: expected expression
        switch (t) {
        ^
main.cpp:32:6: error: expected ';' at end of declaration
    }
     ^
     ;
 The real baffeler is the expected expression error, but the expected ; is problematic as well. What have I done?

@LINK:/questions/20960331/bounding-box-doesnt-rotate-when-the-sprite-rotates
@TITLE:Bounding box doesn't rotate when the sprite rotates
@CONTENT:Working on a simple Java 2D game. A tank is controlled by the user. It can be rotated in any angle, and it moves in the direction of that angle. I'm making a bounding box for the tank, so later I can add collision detection. Currently, I have the box following the sprite wherever it goes, but it doesn't rotate when the sprite rotates. I tried to add code to make the box rotate with the sprite, but adding this code simply makes the bounding box go crazy. It doesn't appear as a box anymore, more like a line just flickering and moving around. (Obviously the bounding box should be invisible, but for now I'm drawing it on the screen to check for problems). xcoo[] and ycoo[] are both of type double and hold four values each. These values are the coordinates of the four vertices of the bounding box (a rectangle-shaped Path2D). (Please note that an actual bounding box is only created when it needs to be drawn on the screen, or in collision detection which I haven't written yet. Most of the time, it's just coordinates.) The Tank's move() method is called every cycle of the game-loop. The move() method updates the location of the sprite, and the location of the bounding box. This works fine. But as I said, trying to rotate the bounding box in that method (aka manipulate it's vertices using the rotation matrix), makes it go Here is the Tank's move() method: public void move(){

    // Updates the location of the sprite. (works)
    x += dx;
    y += dy;

    bbCenterX += dx;
    bbCenterY += dy;

    // Updates the location of the bounding box. (works)    
     for(int i=0;i<4;i++){
        xcoo[i] += dx;
        ycoo[i] += dy;
    } 

    // Should rotate the bounding box (aka, manipulate it's coordinates
    // so when it is created with these coordinates, it's rotated).
    // (Doesn't work).
    for(int z=0;z<4;z++){

        xcoo[z] = xcoo[z] - bbCenterX;
        ycoo[z] = ycoo[z] - bbCenterY;

        xcoo[z] = ((xcoo[z] * Math.cos(angle)) - (ycoo[z] * Math.sin(angle)));
        ycoo[z] = ((xcoo[z] * Math.sin(angle)) + (ycoo[z] * Math.cos(angle)));

        xcoo[z] = xcoo[z] + bbCenterX;
        ycoo[z] = ycoo[z] + bbCenterY;

    }

}
 What's wrong with my rotation? I suspect that that's the part of the code where the problem is, but if you think differently, please tell me to post more code. Thanks a lot

 This is weird to me because I've added that directory to my PYTHONPATH and can import project.settings from the Python prompt. At least it's calling my code, but I can't figure out this system path issue. Any ideas?

@LINK:/questions/20954605/firefoxdriver-webdriver-load-strategy-unstable-findelements-getting-elements-fro
@TITLE:FirefoxDriver webdriver.load.strategy unstable findelements getting elements from the wrong page
@CONTENT:I am using FirefoxDriver in an application that rapidly moves through several similar but not identical pages. To speed up the execution (I need to use FF), I set the webdriver.load.strategy property to 'unstable.' This does indeed speed things up by not completely loading pages, but I found a very strange error. In examining the file with the list of pages and the data on them, I found that some pages were matched up with the wrong data. When I debugged, everything worked fine while stepping, but as soon as I let the program run for even a few pages, it started getting data from the wrong page again. (To clarify, e.g. if I do a driver.get(www.google.com) , followed by driver.get(www.stackoverflow.com), and then do driver.findElements() to get StackOverflow's page title, it will return "Google.") When closely watching the browser running, it appeared to me that there was a mismatch between the urls in the url box and the pages actually being displayed. The urls were changing much faster than the page. I suspect that what is happening is that the driver is not waiting until the page is fully loaded before calling findElements and therefore gets elements from the previous page, which have the same class names. This makes some sense given what webdriver.load.strategy 'stable' is supposed to do, but I set a Wait on an element on the page and it doesn't seem to be waiting. Can it be because every page has the same element, so the element was visible already? I can't wait on anything else because all the pages have the same setup - it's only the individual text that's different, and I don't know what that will be in advance. Has anyone encountered this problem? Does my assumption about what's causing the problem correct? Is there anything I can do about it short of removing the unstable load strategy? Thanks, bsg EDIT I am adding some code, even though the code works perfectly when webdriver.load.strategy 'stable' is not set. for(String url : urllist)
{
  driver.get(url);
  WebElement header = (new WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(ExpectedConditions.presenceOfElementLocated(By.tagName("h1")));
  elements = driver.findElements(By.className(elementclassname));
}
 Note that there is an h1 and several elements with class=elementclassname on each page.
@CODE:driver.get(www.google.com) driver.get(www.stackoverflow.com) driver.findElements() for(String url : urllist)
{
  driver.get(url);

@CONTENT:I am sorry for asking this. But I am having huge problems understanding how to do so. I have a JTable. For that JTable I have my own AbstractTableModel that returns a custom object for getValueAt. Additionally I also have my own TableCellRenderer that uses a lot of colors, and uses column value to extract specified values from object that is given by getValueAt. However I would like to be able to sort values. So how would I go about sorting? I would like to be able to receive the two objects, and the column, and sort based on that. I tried reading bunch of tutorials but they show how to sort either based on string, or just sort without knowing the column. Also should I be doing sorting in the class where I create the JTable, or in AbstractTableModel or in TableCellRenderer? Any help or pointing to good tutorial will be greatly appreciated. I am sorry but I really suck at this worsting and have never done it.

@TITLE:How to check and redirect audio between wired headset and speaker phone?
@CONTENT:I am developing a simple app , that should toggle between speaker phone and wired headset to play audio on a button click event. I am trying to make use of isWiredHeadsetOn() function, but it says that this is deprecated for Android API lvl 5 onwards. So how do I check if currently audio is playing or not through wired headset so that I can redirect it to the phone speaker? Note: I start my app with the headphone plugged to the 3.5mm jack of the phone. This is my attempt at the code so far: protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_audio_re_direct);
    redirect = (Button)findViewById(R.id.redirect);
    final AudioManager audio =(AudioManager)getApplicationContext().getSystemService(AUDIO_SERVICE);

    redirect.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {

        @SuppressWarnings("deprecation")
        @Override
        public void onClick(View v) {
            // TODO Auto-generated method stub
            if(audio.isWiredHeadsetOn())
            {
                audio.setWiredHeadsetOn(false);
                audio.setSpeakerphoneOn(true);
                Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(), "SpeakerPhone On", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
                redirect.setText("Turn on headset");

            }
            else 
            {
                audio.setSpeakerphoneOn(false);
                audio.setWiredHeadsetOn(true);
                Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(), "Wired Headset On", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
                redirect.setText("Turn off headset");
            }

            }

    });
        }
 But the app is not toggling at all. Initially it detects that the wired headset is present, shows the Toast message SpeakerPhone On and that's it. It does not toggle between the two. Someone please help me to make this work. Thanks.

@TITLE:Loading and Passing JScript Arrays from/to C# (not C) COM Component
@CONTENT:I have looked at tutorials on jscript arrays, but not seeing it yet. I saw something similar asked but involving Win32 code not .NET. Wondering, how do I pass arrays back and forth between JScript and a C# COM component? For example, I have two properties defined in my C# COM that returns string and integer arrays as: string[] HeaderLines { get; set; }
int[] ImagePixels { get; set; }
 In my test.js file: ...

var T = new ActiveXObject("Imager.Reader"); 
...    
var headerLines = T.HeaderLines;
WScript.StdOut.WriteLine("First HeaderLine:" + headerLines[0]);
var pixels = T.ImagePixels;
WScript.StdOut.WriteLine("First Pixel: " + pixels[0]);
 The error is where headerLines[0] is written out: C:\temp\test.js(12, 1) Microsoft JScript runtime error: 'headerLines.0' is null or not an object If I remove the headerLines in test.js, then I get this error (essentially the same but for the integer array): C:\temp\test.js(12, 1) Microsoft JScript runtime error: 'pixels.0' is null or not an object I can get results from non-array properties just fine as well as passing values to other methods, but not with arrays. I also need to pass in string and integer arrays into a method defined in my C# COM component as: bool Write(string filename, string[] headerLines, int[] pix, int width, int height);
 I am using Visual Studio Express 2012 for Desktop for creating the COM piece in C#. If any other information is needed, just let me know.
@CODE:string[] HeaderLines { get; set; }
int[] ImagePixels { get; set; } ...

var T = new ActiveXObject("Imager.Reader"); 
...    
var headerLines = T.HeaderLines;
WScript.StdOut.WriteLine("First HeaderLine:" + headerLines[0]);
var pixels = T.ImagePixels;
WScript.StdOut.WriteLine("First Pixel: " + pixels[0]); bool Write(string filename, string[] headerLines, int[] pix, int width, int height); length

@CONTENT:I want to create a form where I can edit a field of my class TagHandler. So I decided to pass as a paramter to form's constructor TagHandler tag where tag - is a tag I want to edit. In my form I've got a field tag which I edit and then get its data. For example in my main form I've got a listbox with MouseDoubleClick method void listBox1_MouseDoubleClick(object sender, MouseEventArgs e)
{
    int index = listBox1.SelectedIndex;
    TagHandler tg = listData[index];

    EditTag edit = new EditTag(tg);
    if (edit.ShowDialog() == System.Windows.Forms.DialogResult.OK)
    {
        listData[index] = edit.Tag as TagHandler;
    }
}
 Where EditTag is a form public partial class EditTag : Form
{
    public TagHandler tag { set; get; }
    public EditTag(TagHandler tag)
    {
        InitializeComponent();
        this.CenterToParent();
        this.FormBorderStyle = System.Windows.Forms.FormBorderStyle.FixedDialog;

@CONTENT:Is there a standard definition for the size of the __DATE__ and __TIME__ strings in ANSI C? The motivation behind this question is: I have two applications running on two different CPUs. During runtime, app #1 receives date and time (as part of version-info) from app #2. Of course, app #2 takes them from the preprocessor __DATE__ and __TIME__ definitions. So I would like to know whether or not I can statically allocate in app #1 an array, into which I can copy the info received from app #2. Thanks

@CONTENT:I am stuck with this very strange problem. In the client I am passing in objects like try{
    oos.writeObject(new GameStartSerializedObject());
    oos.flush();
}
catch(Exception e){
    e.printStackTrace();
}
 and in the server I am reading the object try{
    //Its my turn
    thrown_message = player_reader.readObject();
}
catch(Exception e){
 My question is why am i getting EOF exception. My understanding of object input stream is when i call readObject() i should block until i get an object so how does it know if the eof is reached? Please help! This is how I create object streams ois = new ObjectInputStream(socket.getInputStream());
oos = new ObjectOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream());
oos.flush();
 Also, after i write object and flush should i close the stream. I am not closing it since the objects are written pretty regularly from different parts of the code one after another.
@CODE:try{
    oos.writeObject(new GameStartSerializedObject());
    oos.flush();
}
catch(Exception e){
    e.printStackTrace();

@LINK:/questions/20911174/associating-object-names
@TITLE:Associating object names
@CONTENT:I'm trying to create a system that teaches people language. The user will type in a given sentence in the target language, and it will check to see if they've typed it correctly. I want to give them a word bank for the current task (aka sentence) they are given. The words in the word bank should be associated with the current task. In the image, the words boxed in green are part of sentence one, and red is part of sentence two. To do this, I've put the tasks in an object. The keys are the task names, and values are the sentences. var tasks = {
    "task1" : "Ni Hao. Wo Shi Dan.",
    "task2" : "Xie Xie. Bu Ke Qi."
}
 The wordbank words are stored in an object... I'm trying to associate each wordbank set with the respective task name. But I also need to use the keys as the foreign language, and the values as the English. So I cannot use the task name as the key... So I'm having trouble associating the correct word bank to the given task by key name. var words = {
    "task1" :
    {
        'Ni'    : 'you',
        'Wo'    : 'I',
        'Hao'   : 'good',
        'Shi'   : 'am'  
    },
    "task2" :
    {
        'Xie Xie' : 'Thanks',
        'Bu' : 'No',
        'Ke Qi' : 'Manners'
    }
}

var phrases = {
    "task1" :
    {
        'Ni Hao'    : 'Hello',
        'Wo Shi'    : 'I am'    
    },
    "task2" :
    {
        'Xie Xie' : 'Thanks',
        'Bu Ke Qi' : 'You are welcome'
    }
}
 To move to the next task once the user has successfully typed in the first sentence, I've stored the task names in a taskQueue by task name... var taskQueue = [];
taskQueue.push("task1", "task2");
var i = 0;

//Match the task name from taskQueue with the correct task
function task() {
    for (key in tasks) {
        return tasks[taskQueue[i]];
    }
}
 My goal here is to match the current task name in the taskQueue with the appropriate key in the words object... but like I said, I'm already using the keys for this to store the Foreign language. function bank() {
    $(".wordBank_Words").empty();
    $(".wordBank_Hint").empty();
    for (obj in words) {
        for (key in words[obj]) {
            if (words[obj] == taskQueue[i]) {
                $(".wordBank_Words").append("<li><b>" + key + "</b>: " + words[obj][key] + "</li>");
            }
        }
    }
    for (obj in phrases) {
        for (key in phrases[obj]) { 
            $(".wordBank_Hint").append("<li><b>" + key + "</b>: " + phrases[obj][key] + "</li>");
        }
    }
}
 Here, once the user's input matches the task key's value (the sentence), i is incremented to move on to the next sentence: function playerResponse(input) {
    bank();
    if (input == task()) {  
        i++;
        $("#responseVerify").html("Great job");
        document.getElementById('response').value = '';
    }
    else {
        $("#responseVerify").html("Keep going...");
    }
}
 So how can I associate these keys by name so that the tasks object and wordBank object's keys match up for the given task? Sorry if this is confusing. Thanks!

@TITLE:Is there a way to set up a fallback for the <input> formAction attribute in HTML5?
@CONTENT:I have a form that is supposed to dynamically change where it is submitted to. I am doing this by bringing in a submit button using ajax that has the formAction attribute set to where I want the form to submit to (I'm bringing in a number of other things as well that are dependent on the user input, but as far as I can tell have no bearing on this question). Here's an example of my submit button: <input type="submit" value="Edit" name="save" id="save" formAction="http://example.com" />
 The URL in formAction is dynamically generated based on user input in the initial form. Everything is working as I expected in both chrome and firefox, but despite the fact that IE 11 supposedly has support for formAction, it appears to be ignoring it. Regardless, I'd like to have the same functionality work with IE 9, which I know doesn't support formAction, so I'm trying to create a fallback. I've used Modernizr in the past, but looking at the documentation indicates to me that it does not check for the formAction attribute. Is there a way to use the html 5 functionality of formAction while having a fallback option? I like to try to code to html 5 standards whenever possible.

I've completed the chapter but now when running the app only shows a Blank screen. Any help appreciated. This is the code: public class MainActivity extends Activity {

@TITLE:Replacing file using regex
@CONTENT:i tried to replace inner text of the month tag i.e month names should be replaced with their specified month number. i tried this,  Dim strFile As String = File.ReadAllText(TextBox1.Text & "\" & parentFolder & ".xml")
    strFile = Regex.Replace(strFile, "<conf-start iso-8601-date=""([0-9-]+)""><day>([0-9]+)</day><month>March</month>", "<conf-start iso-8601-date=""([0-9-]+)""><day>([0-9]+)</day><month>03</month>")
    File.WriteAllText(TextBox1.Text & "\" & parentFolder & ".xml", strFile)
 now the problem is that if the line is like this, <conf-start iso-8601-date="2011-03-06"><day>06</day><month>March</month><year>2011</year></conf-start>
 here the above expression is catching the data and replaces it with, <conf-start iso-8601-date=""([0-9-]+)""><day>([0-9-]+)</day><month>03</month><year>2011</year></conf-start>
 instead it should replace <conf-start iso-8601-date="2011-03-06"><day>06</day><month>03</month>
 any help will be really aprreciated

@LINK:/questions/20895880/how-to-efficiently-load-images-in-uitableview
@TITLE:How to efficiently load images in UITableView?
@CONTENT:I have a UITableView that will contain a high number of images. Each cell will have 5 images, that are loaded randomly from Parse.com. My query code, right now, is in cellForRowAtIndexPath. This causes a few issues: 1.) There's some lag/delay when scrolling the table. 2.) The images, now for some odd reason, are not showing in the proper location. 3.) The images reload/change every time the table is scrolled. I'd like for the images to be "loaded" just once when on this UIView, in the correct place, and with smooth scrolling. What's the best way to handle this? Here's the code for how I am loading the images: - (UITableViewCell *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath
{

    // set up the cell here

    // query and display random images from parse.com
    PFQuery * query = [PFUser query];
    [query whereKey:@"category" equalTo:self.cell.label.text];
    [query findObjectsInBackgroundWithBlock:^(NSArray *objects, NSError *error) {

        if (error)
        {
            NSLog(@"Error: %@ %@", error, [error userInfo]);
        }
        else
        {
            for (int i = 0; i < objects.count; i++)
            {
                self.profilePicObject = [objects objectAtIndex:i];

                int imgRandom = arc4random() % [objects count];

                self.randomProfilePicObject = [objects objectAtIndex:imgRandom];

                self.imageFile = [self.randomProfilePicObject objectForKey:@"imageFile"];
                NSURL * imageFileURL = [[NSURL alloc] initWithString:self.imageFile.url];
                NSData * imageData = [NSData dataWithContentsOfURL:imageFileURL];
                UIImage * aImage = [[UIImage alloc] initWithData:imageData];

                self.cell.profilePicOne.image = aImage;
            }
    }

    return self.cell;

}
 EDIT: I'm using SDWebImage and the table now scrolls smoothly and images are displaying. The new issue: Images are loading in wrong cells. I'm querying the table and matching the label text to the proper string in my Parse table and using that to display the proper image. Initially, some images load in the correct cell and some do not. When I scroll, images appear all over the place. What's the best way to fix this? Here is how I am setting up the cells: static NSString * cellIdentifier = @"FilterSelectCell";

self.cell = (FilterSelectCell *)[tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:cellIdentifier];

    if (self.cell == nil)
    {
        NSArray * nib = [[NSBundle mainBundle] loadNibNamed:@"FilterSelectCell" owner:self options:nil];
        self.cell = [nib objectAtIndex:0];

        self.cell.profilePicOne.clipsToBounds = YES;
        self.cell.profilePicOne.layer.cornerRadius = 20.0;

        self.cell.profilePicTwo.clipsToBounds = YES;

        self.cell.profilePicFive.clipsToBounds = YES;
        self.cell.profilePicFive.layer.cornerRadius = 20.0;
    }

    self.cell.label.text = [self.myArray objectAtIndex:indexPath.row];

 I used rekursions to read all frames... the only question I have now is if there is a way to store a handler for the frame just like a windowsHandler..like: WebDriver driver = new HtmlUnitDriver();
driver.get(Constant.URL);
WebDriver fooDriver = driver.switchTo().frame("myFrame");
String handler = fooDriver.getWindowHandle();
 My intention is that I could easily navigate to the frame once the focus is lost, otherwise I have to iterate again over all frames to get the one I want to pick.

@LINK:/questions/20885797/iteratively-parse-json-file
@TITLE:Iteratively parse JSON file
@CONTENT:I have 1000+ JSON files that look like {
    "name": "Some name",
    "part_num": "123456",

    "other_config": {
        // Large amount of objects
    },
    "some more": {
        // Large amount of objects
    }
    // etc
}
 When my program starts up, it has to scan the directory with all these JSON files, load each one, and extract the "name" and "part_num" values and populates a list view with these values. The user then selects one and that config is then re-parsed and the proper actions taken then. The problem is reading that many files takes a while. I've mitigated it somewhat by using multiprocessing to throw the work on all available cores in the background, then populating the list view once done, but I'm still bounded by IO. Since I know this code will be running on computers with slower processors and hard drives than mine, this speed is not acceptable. The average case scenario is that the values I need are at the beginning of the file, but I can't assume that in the worst case. Is there a way to iteratively parse a JSON file so that I can load what I need from these files faster? I could resort to regex, but I'd really prefer not to.
@CODE:{
    "name": "Some name",
    "part_num": "123456",

    "other_config": {
        // Large amount of objects
    },
    "some more": {
        // Large amount of objects
    }
    // etc
} "name" "part_num" multiprocessing [{stuff from file1},{stuff from file2},....] sqlite name part_num

@TITLE:How to use fmdb for a login page?
@CONTENT:I have a login page that has 2 textfields for username & password and a few buttons. I want to know that how I can use fmdb for checking if the username/password combination exists in my database? I also have another viewcontroller used for the user registeration page, having 4 textfields for username, password, email, contact number and a button to input the entered text into the database. How can I save the entered text in 4 fields to the database? Thanks in advance. Here is my code: I succeeded in entering the data into the database,in the registerViewController but I want to enter code into the "btnforgot"(forgot Password) action if the user forgets the password and/or username. I've been successful somewhat in the loginViewController too,as far as checking if the username & password match the same in the database or not,but i guess i am missing something(some code) in between.

@TITLE:iOS 7 Changing UINavigationBar titleView alpha
@CONTENT:So I am using the UINavigationBar component of iOS7, but not the UINavigationController itself. When I push a new view with my custom navigation controller, I want to change the title's alpha to 0.0 and then back, but I can't seem to get it work. I am trying to do this vc1.navBar.topItem.titleView.alpha = 0.1;
 It doesn't seem to have any effect. Am I missing something here, is there a correct way to achieve this?

@TITLE:Arduino at 11.0592MHz. Modify Timer0, delayMicroseconds()
@CONTENT:I am using the ATMega328P at 11.0592MHz with the Arduino environment. I recognized that the delayMicroseconds() function is about 27% too fast. The reason is, that the code in wiring.c assumes that the clock peed is now 8MHz. Now I try to fix it. I found different posts but I am not sure what is the most Arduino compatible way. What can you recommend? Multiply the variable "us" in wiring.c with 1.27 if the F_CPU is 11.0592MHz? Easy but only affects delayMicroseconds and not millis(), micros(), delay(), etc. Change the prescale factor maybe from 64 to ??? Other ideas or guides? Thank you in advance. Felix

@CODE:$_SESSION['ids'] = array('strawberry', 'banana', 'apple'); array_push($_SESSION['ids'], 'orange'); $_SESSION['ids'][] = 'orange'; array_push() will raise a warning if the first argument is not an array. This differs from the $var[] behaviour where a new array is created.

@TITLE:Cast() exception: LINQ to Entities only supports casting EDM primitive or enumeration types
@CONTENT:I want to display some entity named CriminalEvent in a general-purpose MVC view I wrote. The view requires that the Model pass to it shall implement the IDataModel interface. Now, CriminalEvent has the properties to implement this interface but under a different name and I cannot change it. So in my code I inherited CriminalEvent and my derived class (also called CriminalEvent, stupid I guess but allows me to avoid many code changes...) has explicit interface code: Using ViewApp;
public interface IDataModel
{
    int ID { get; set; }
    int CriminalEventID { get; set; }
}

public class ViewCriminalEvent : AIM.Police.DB.CriminalEvent, IDataModel
{
    int IDataModel.ID
    {
        get { return CriminalEventID; }
        set { CriminalEventID = value; }
    }
}
 (I know, in this case the interface's ID property equals CriminalEventID, it's Ok) I expected to be able to read the AIM.Police.DB.CriminalEvent Entities and populate my view model by Linq to Entities Cast()ing them to the derived CriminalEvent, like this: The view model (I need to populate the CriminalEvents property): Using ViewApp;
public class CriminalEventMainViewModel
{
    public IEnumerable<IDataModel> CriminalEvents { get; set; }
    public IDataModel SelectedEntity { get; set; }

    public string SubEntityDisplayName { get; set; }

    public IEnumerable<IDataModel> SubEntityCollection { get; set; }
    public IDataModel SelectedSubEntity { get; set; }
}
 and the Controller code: Using ViewApp;    
private ViewResult CriminalEventIndexView(CriminalEvent selectedCriminalEvent = null)
{
    CriminalEventMainViewModel viewModel =
        new CriminalEventMainViewModel();

    using (var db1 = new AIM.Police.DB.InvestigationContext(lazyLoadingEnabled: false))
    {
        viewModel.CriminalEvents = db1.CriminalEvents.Cast<ViewCriminalEvent>().ToList(); // THIS LINE THROWS THE EXCEPTION
        viewModel.SelectedEntity = selectedCriminalEvent;
    }
    return View("Index", (object)viewModel);
}
 Note both the original CriminalEvent class and the InvestigationContext are found in the AIM.Police.DB dll that I cannot touch The Error: Unable to cast the type 'AIM.Police.DB.CriminalEvent' to type 'InvestigationSimulator.Models.CriminalEvent'. LINQ to Entities only supports casting EDM primitive or enumeration types. Why do I get this error? Remarks on my approach are always welcome..
@CODE:CriminalEvent IDataModel CriminalEvent CriminalEvent Using ViewApp;
public interface IDataModel
{
    int ID { get; set; }
    int CriminalEventID { get; set; }
}

public class ViewCriminalEvent : AIM.Police.DB.CriminalEvent, IDataModel

Code: template<template<class> class C, typename T> void print(C<T>& c) {

 It seems something is wrong about definition or my compiler but i tested this code with both g++ and clang++ in order to be sure about there is not any compiler dependent problem. Both of them raises same error. I really appreciate any meaningful comments which aim to make clarification for this problem. Thank you

I saw similar question somewhere to do this? So I am not sure if it is possible or not? If not in JS is it possible in other languages like C, Java, Python ? My understanding is that all these languages are only able to add some functionality for new objects and even those new objects can only have operators and syntax that a language itself already have? So am I correct or this is possible to add new syntax to these langauges?

@TITLE:XMPPFramework - Which XMPPRoster function to use to send a friend request?
@CONTENT:I am trying to implement an Instant Messaging App where users can chat as well as add other users to their roster and accept buddy requests. So, far I have been able to implement the chat and I am also able to receive and accept/reject friend requests. For accepting/rejecting a subscription request, the code is as follows: - (void)xmppStream:(XMPPStream *)sender didReceivePresence:(XMPPPresence *)presence
{
    NSString *presenceType = [presence type]; // online / offline
    NSString *myUsername = [[sender myJID] user];
    NSString *presenceFromUser = [[presence from] user];
    NSString *presencefromStr=[presence fromStr];

    if  ([presenceType isEqualToString:@"subscribe"]) {
        if(buttonIndex==1) { // For accept button
            [xmppRoster acceptPresenceSubscriptionRequestFrom:[tmpPresence from] andAddToRoster:YES];
    }
    else { // For reject button
        [xmppRoster rejectPresenceSubscriptionRequestFrom:[tmpPresence from]];
    }
}
 However, now I am stuck with the problem of not being able to send a friend request. Can anyone guide me on which function of XMPPRoster to use? I tried using the subscribePresenceToUser function, but, it didn't work. Any help will be highly appreciated. Also, can someone tell if the way I am going with this XMPPRoster subscription mechanism is right or is there a better way to handle the friend requests in XMPPFramework? Thanks in advance.

// Here i can access the keychain as usually

 Well the bundle code inside does not use the keychain. May be this is some kind of security logic? Any clues?

@CONTENT:I have a managed Hive table, which contains only one 150MB file. I then do "select count(*) from tbl" to it, and it uses 2 mappers. I want to set it to a bigger number. First I tried 'set mapred.max.split.size=8388608;', so hopefully it will use 19 mappers. But it only uses 3. Somehow it still split the input by 64MB. I also used 'set dfs.block.size=8388608;', not working either. Then I tried a vanilla map-reduce job to do the same thing. It initially uses 3 mappers, and when I set mapred.max.split.size, it uses 19. So the problem lies in Hive, I suppose. I read some of the Hive source code, like CombineHiveInputFormat, ExecDriver, etc. can't find a clue. What else settings can I use?

 While running the above code I am getting SyntaxError: missing ; before statement error. I read somewhere Access-Control-Allow-Origin should be used to solve problem. But I don't find a good documentation anywhere about how to use with Jira. "UPDATE" The above error I am getting if I have already loggedin in jira. If I logout in jira and then run the above code then getting error "NetworkError: 401 Unauthorized - http://myjira.com/rest/api/2/issue/MA-6614/comment?callback=jQuery1102010440085066514837_1388216960965&_=1388216960966" It seems the above code has two problem. 1. It is not able to authenticate in jira. 2. if we already authenticate in jira (that means browser has cookies)and make the request then syntax error is shown because of jsonp.

@TITLE:How to generate an un-biased random number within an arbitrary range using the fewest bits
@CONTENT:Because of the pigeon hole principle, you can't just use output = min + (rand() % (int)(max - min + 1))
 to generate an unbiased, uniform, result. This answer to a similar question provides one solution but it is highly wasteful in terms of random bits consumed. For example, if the random range of the source is low, then the chances of having to generate a second value from the source can be quite high. Alternative, using a larger source range is inherently wasteful too. While I'm sure an optimal source range size could be derived, that doesn't address the question that there may be a better algorithm, rather than optimizing this one. [EDIT] The my idea has been shown in the answers to produce biased results. An approach that occurs to me is Consume the minimum number of bits necessary to cover the desired range. If that value is outside the desired range only throw away one bit and consume one more. Repeat as necessary.
@CODE:output = min + (rand() % (int)(max - min + 1)) rand() min + (int) (((double) rand() / (RAND_MAX + 1.0)) * (max - min + 1)) rand() [0, 1) [min, max) rand()

@TITLE:Need to pull 2 nodes and combine the information in LibXML
@CONTENT:I have an problem I could sure use some help with. First, be gentle. I am new to both perl and LibXML. I have been parsing a document and placing elements into an array that is then written to a speadsheet column. Durring testing it was discovered that some nodes have more than one child node of the same name. I need to combine the text from each of these child nodes into one element of the array. The (very simplified) format of the xml is: <Group>
    <title>
    <description>
    <reference>
    <fixtext>
    <check>
        <check-content> "Some text I want to pull"
 But occasionally it is like this: <Group>
    <title>
    <description>
    <reference>
    <fixtext>
    <check>
        <check-content> "Some text I want to pull"
        <check-content> "Some more text I want to pull and join to the first"
 I can pull all the text from "check-contents", but if there is more than one it throws off the row of data in the spreadsheet. I need to be able to say something like: If there are 2 or more "check-content" join the data an push into the array. If not, just push the data into the array. Any help would be greatly appreciated. What I have been doing is this. my @Check_Content;

@TITLE:Qt 5.2.0 The camera service is missing
@CONTENT:I have a Logitech HD Webcam C270. I want to write a simple webcam application and so I tried to compile the Qt camera example (Qt\Qt5.2.0\5.2.0\msvc2010_opengl\examples\multimediawidgets\camera). My dev system is a Windows 7 x64 SP1 Virtual Machine. If the webcam is connected to this VM the example runs very well. Qt and the windows device manager detect the webcam as "USB Video device". When I try to run the compiled binary on my non-virtual system (which is also Win7 x64 SP1) the application says "the camera service is missing" (yes, I disconnected the camera from the virtual machine). On this system the camera is detected as "Logitech HD Webcam C270 " I also have a second notebook with Win7 x64 SP1 - same problem here. When I test the webcam with another tool (dorgem.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/dorgem/Dorgem/) I can see, that the webcam works. What can I do to resolve the problem? Am I missing some library or 3rd party tool? Qt isn't installed on my "real" systems. I copied all DLLs the application complained about to the same directory as the exe file: icudt51.dll

@TITLE:Database FK Constraints vs Programmatic FK Constraints
@CONTENT:Although I am targeting MySQL/PHP, for the sake of my questions, I'd like to just apply this generally to any relational database that is being used in conjunction with a modern programming language. Another assumption would be that the language is leveraging a modern framework, which, on some level would handle foreign key constraints implicitly or have a means to do so explicitly. My questions: What are the pros and cons of creating FK constraints in the database itself as opposed to managing them at the application level? From a design standpoint, should they ever both be used together or would that cause conflict? If they should not be used together, what is considered the "best practice" in regards to which approach to use? Note: This is a design theory question. Because of the wide variety of technology that could be used to satisfy an implementation, I'm not really interested in any specifics regarding an implementation.

@LINK:/questions/20769150/getting-a-uri-with-escaped-slashes-on-mono
@TITLE:Getting a Uri with escaped slashes on mono
@CONTENT:Update: A fix has now made it's way into mono. This is good news! Updated: Added logic to fix fragment handling. I am trying to send a request with an encoded slash on Mono using the Uri class. This is basically the Mono equivalent of this question: GETting a URL with an url-encoded slash The issue is that Mono similar to .NET will unescape any slashes it finds in the Uri when it is constructed. This logic was originally put in in place in order to remove vulnerabilities that could occur if paths were escape encoded and not detected. In the previous post there is a hack which shows setting flags on the underlying Uri class via reflection which force the escaped slashes to be left alone. This behavior has been fixed in .NET 4.5 and by default the escaped slashes are allowed (as I mentioned in the comments). I tried to do the same on Mono, but it fails as the internals of the Uri class are different. I came up with this approach to achieve what I want, which works but it is TERRIBLY hacky. class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { var uri = new Uri("http://www.yahoo.com/%2F?Foo=Bar%2F#frag"); UriHelper.ForceCanonicalPathAndQuery(uri); Console.WriteLine ("uri.ToString() - " + uri.ToString ()); Console.WriteLine ("uri.AbsoluteUri - " + uri.AbsoluteUri); Console.WriteLine ("uri.Host - " + uri.Host); Console.WriteLine ("uri.Query - " + uri.Query); Console.WriteLine ("uri.PathAndQuery - " + uri.PathAndQuery); Console.WriteLine ("uri.AbsolutePath - " + uri.AbsolutePath); Console.WriteLine ("uri.Fragment - " + uri.Fragment); } public class UriHelper {
  private static Type uriType = typeof(Uri);
  private static FieldInfo sourceField;
  private static FieldInfo queryField;
  private static FieldInfo pathField;
  private static FieldInfo cachedToStringField;
  private static FieldInfo cachedAbsoluteUriField;

  static UriHelper ()
  {
    sourceField = uriType.GetField ("source", BindingFlags.NonPublic | BindingFlags.Instance);
    queryField = uriType.GetField ("query", BindingFlags.NonPublic | BindingFlags.Instance);
    pathField = uriType.GetField ("path", BindingFlags.NonPublic | BindingFlags.Instance);
    cachedToStringField = uriType.GetField ("cachedToString", BindingFlags.NonPublic | BindingFlags.Instance);
    cachedAbsoluteUriField = uriType.GetField ("cachedAbsoluteUri", BindingFlags.NonPublic | BindingFlags.Instance);
  }

  public static void ForceCanonicalPathAndQuery(Uri uri)
  {
    var source = (string) sourceField.GetValue (uri);
    cachedToStringField.SetValue (uri, source);
    cachedAbsoluteUriField.SetValue (uri, source);
    var fragPos = source.IndexOf ("#");
    var queryPos = source.IndexOf ("?");
    var start = source.IndexOf (uri.Host) + uri.Host.Length;
    var pathEnd = queryPos == -1 ? fragPos : queryPos;
    if (pathEnd == -1)
      pathEnd = source.Length+1;
    var path = queryPos > -1 ? source.Substring (start, pathEnd - start) : source.Substring (start);
    pathField.SetValue (uri, path);
    queryField.SetValue(uri, fragPos > -1 ? source.Substring(queryPos, fragPos - queryPos) : source.Substring(queryPos));
  }
}
 } When you run this, it outputs the following: uri.ToString() - http://www.yahoo.com/%2F?Foo=Bar%2F#frag
uri.AbsoluteUri - http://www.yahoo.com/%2F?Foo=Bar%2F#frag
uri.Host - www.yahoo.com
uri.Query - ?Foo=Bar%2F
uri.PathAndQuery - /%2F?Foo=Bar%2F
uri.AbsolutePath - /%2F
uri.Fragment - #frag
 I don't at all feel good about it, but it does work, at least for the basic scenario of taking a Uri and issuing a query. I might be missing something in the Uri class, so if you have a better / less hacky way to do what I am doing here, I'd really appreciate it.

 I don't understand the error, but in case it's related to my custom filter, here it is: app.filter('dateToISO', function() {
  return function(input) {
    input = new Date(input).toISOString();
    return input;
  };
});
 Update When I remove the | dateToISO | it works. So it appears connected to the custom filter.

@TITLE:can I start a service from another service in android?
@CONTENT:I am developing an app which will keep track of the time when a user's phone is "not used". Basically, an app which gets activated as soon as a user presses unlock or in the event of an incoming call. I have written a BroadcastReceiver which notifies a background service to start keeping track of time during which the phone is not being used, and will show the activity as soon as the user presses to lock. My problem is that the services sometimes gets shut down without notifying. Can I write one more service which can periodically check whether the master service is running and toggle it in case it's shutdown? Or is there any other better way to do so?

@CONTENT:Locally, it appears that I have Postgresql 9.2.4 installed. I am guessing based off the last error message I received that I do not have the latest version: pg_dump: server version: 9.3.1; pg_dump version: 9.2.4
pg_dump: aborting because of server version mismatch
 On other posts here, what was told to do was to add the following the the .profile and then run the command: export PATH="/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/MacOS/bin:$PATH"
. ~/.profile
 which did not work. 2 weeks ago, I installed Postgresql with the simple command: brew install postgresql
 and that gave me the version I currently have. It appears as I don't have the latest version then. How can I a) upgrade to 9.3.1 (which is what the server version looks to be) or b) do one of these fixes like the one I attempted above which did not work. I am very new to Postgresql so a step by step would be very helpful for me.

@CONTENT:I have this DbContext object which consists of - - Employee

Note: one Employee can have many CompanyAddress
 Records are added to CompanyAddress table only if some address doesn't exists in CompanyAddress table. If I have two DBContext objects from database say Snapshot1, Snapshot2. Say when both these snapshots were taken, there were no records in CompanyAddress table. When changes were made to Snapshot1 and saved - records are written to CompanyAddress table. When changes were made to Snapshot2 and saved using mydataContext.SaveChanges();
 exception occurs: System.Data.Entity.Infrastructure.DbUpdateException: An error occurred while updating the entries
System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException: Violation of PRIMARY KEY constraint 'PK_CompanyAddress'. Cannot insert duplicate key in object 'dbo.CompanyAddress'
 It seems saving of Snapshot1 made Snapshot2 dirty because when they are saved back to database, both had same CompanyAddress records. What other call/settings I can make on dbContext object to avoid this error? Thank you!

@TITLE:Parsing URL query in PHP
@CONTENT:Assuming a url of www.domain.org?x=1&y=2&z=3, what would be a smart method to separate out the query elements of a url in php without using GET or REQUEST?   $url = parse_url($url);
  echo $url[fragment];    
 I don't think it's possible to return query parts separately is it? From what I can tell the query will just say x=1&y=2&z=3 but please let me know if I am wrong. Otherwise, what would you do to parse the $url[query]? Edit: Fragment should be Query instead. Sorry for the confusion, I am learning!
@CODE:www.domain.org?x=1&y=2&z=3 $url = parse_url($url);
  echo $url[fragment]; x=1&y=2&z=3 $url[query] $url[fragment] fragment $url $url['fragment'] # ? # $_GET['x'] ? $_GET[] $url

@TITLE:How to detect when ssh connection (over a QProcess) has finished?
@CONTENT:I am running an ssh tunnel from an application using a QProcess: QProcess* process = new QProcess();
process->start("ssh", QStringList()<<"-L"<<"27017:localhost:27017"<<"example.com");
 So far it works great, the only problem being that there is no way for me to see when the port has actually been created. When I run the command on a shell, it takes about 10 seconds to connect to the remote host after which the forwarded port is ready for usage. How do I detect it from my application? EDIT: As suggested by vahancho, I used the fact that post-connection there is some output on the terminal that can be used to detect that the connection has succeeded. However, there is a line which is run instantly after launch Pseudo-terminal will not be allocated because stdin is not a terminal, which probably would give a false alarm. The correct output is available in the second signal, emitted a bit later (which is a true indicator of the port having being opened). To get rid of the first message, I am now running ssh using ssh -t -t to force an stdin allocation. So, the only question left is, can anyone help me without any concerns in this approach?
@CODE:QProcess QProcess* process = new QProcess();
process->start("ssh", QStringList()<<"-L"<<"27017:localhost:27017"<<"example.com"); Pseudo-terminal will not be allocated because stdin is not a terminal ssh -t -t

@TITLE:Iterators over same collection in for-loop
@CONTENT:Assume i want to generate all combinations of subsets of a Set. Since subset returns an iterator I don't want to convert it to something strict. def gen(A: Set[Int]) = {
  val it0 = A.subsets
  val it1 = A.subsets
  for(a <- it0; b <- it1) yield (a,b)
}
 but it does not what I want. For Example gen(Set(1,2,3)).foreach(println) returns: (Set(),Set())
(Set(),Set(1))
(Set(),Set(2))
(Set(),Set(3))
(Set(),Set(1, 2))
(Set(),Set(1, 3))
(Set(),Set(2, 3))
(Set(),Set(1, 2, 3))
 It seems only the second iterator iterates over all subsets. Why does it behave like that and is there a nice way to avoid this?

  val it0 = A.subsets
  val it1 = A.subsets

@LINK:/questions/20733087/how-to-include-product-images-in-magento-apis-product-list-method-result
@TITLE:How to include product images in Magento Api's product list method result
@CONTENT:I want to minimize the number of Api calls for a mobile application which connects to Magento based shop to display products. right now we have to call catalog_product_attribute_media.list method for each product in order to get image Urls and it really slows down the app. I found out in this answer that it is possible to extend the result of an Api Call by editing certain scripts. I tried to use the same approach to include images in product list by editing app/code/core/Mage/Catalog/Model/Category/Api.php line 440: $storeId = $this->_getStoreId($store);
$collection = $category->setStoreId($storeId)->getProductCollection()
->addAttributeToSelect('brand')
->addAttributeToSelect('media_gallery_images');
($storeId == 0)? $collection->addOrder('position', 'asc') : $collection->setOrder('position', 'asc');;

$result = array();

foreach ($collection as $product) {
    $result[] = array(
        'product_id' => $product->getId(),
        'type'       => $product->getTypeId(),
        'set'        => $product->getAttributeSetId(),
        'sku'        => $product->getSku(),
        'position'   => $product->getCatIndexPosition(),
        'brand'      => $product->getData('brand'),
    'media'      => $product->getMediaGalleryImages()
    );
}

return $result;
 I also edited html/app/code/core/Mage/Catalog/etc/wsdl.xml to include the new 'media' property line: 255     <complexType name="catalogAssignedProduct">
        <all>
            <element name="product_id" type="xsd:int"/>
            <element name="type" type="xsd:string"/>
            <element name="set" type="xsd:int"/>
            <element name="sku" type="xsd:string"/>
            <element name="position" type="xsd:int"/>

            <element name="media" type="typens:catalogProductImageEntityArray"/>
        </all>
    </complexType>
 but when I call the catalog_category.assignedProducts it always returns null for the 'media' property, I wonder why this doesn't work? is it the xml type or something else?
@CODE:catalog_product_attribute_media.list $storeId = $this->_getStoreId($store);
$collection = $category->setStoreId($storeId)->getProductCollection()
->addAttributeToSelect('brand')
->addAttributeToSelect('media_gallery_images');
($storeId == 0)? $collection->addOrder('position', 'asc') : $collection->setOrder('position', 'asc');;

$result = array();

foreach ($collection as $product) {

        'position'   => $product->getCatIndexPosition(),
        'brand'      => $product->getData('brand'),
    'media'      => $product->getMediaGalleryImages()
    );

@TITLE:Error undefined method `to_key' for [xxx] :Array when trying to use array data on Active Admin table_for (Rails, Postgresql, postgres_ext gem)
@CONTENT:I'd like to have use the data I manage to get inside an array of array to put them inside a table(table_for) on one of my Dashboards on Active Admin My app is a Daily Deal app built to learn more Ruby on Rails. Thanks to help on SO, I now manage to get all the data i need inside an Array: Count occurrence of values in a serialized attribute(array) in Active Admin dashboard (Rails, Active admin 1.0, Postgresql database, postgres_ext gem) The array's data I want to use looks like (it's actually an array of array) But what i'd like is something looking like the image below, so i want to use Active Admin's table_for (to have all the export features later on): My current code on my Dashboard page is columns do 

  column do

    data = Deal.connection.select_rows(
        %q{ with expanded_deals(id, goal) as (
        select id, unnest(deal_main_goal)
        from deals)

        select goal, count(*) n

    panel "Top Goals" do

      table_for data do
          #code
      end

    end  

  end
end  
 Even without putting any code inside table_for data, I already get the error: undefined method `to_key' for ["Acquisition (website or newsletter opt-ins)", "3"]:Array
 How can I use the array's data to put them inside a standard table_for with my basic columns "goal"/"number of deals"? I might have stumbled upon a ticket on AA that says it might not be possible: https://github.com/gregbell/active_admin/issues/1713 Would anybody know how to do that?

@CONTENT:I have a textbox where user can enter any number of characters, But i want its width to be increased dynamically with respect to the characters entered into it. I have done a workaround shown below and it works partially, it will increase width dynamically but not so precise and it will hide past entered characters after a while because of my poor logic applied in it. I just given a wild cutoff of 17 character count to start the increment. It should start the width increment only if the character count reaches the end of textbox. UPDATE: I am looking to make visible all the characters entered in field, where in default the text box hide past entered characters to left. FIDDLE DEMO HTML <input type="text" id="txtbox" />

@TITLE:routing and clean path (no hashtag) not working in angularJS
@CONTENT:Guys this is driving me crazy, been fighting for hours on this, and couldn't find a solution! I know that in order to clean the hashtag from the URL path, i need to use the $locationProvider.html5Mode(true); But for some reason this is not working well for me, I'm using tomcat 7 btw to run this. These are my HTML imports, both AngularJS stuff are v1.2.6:     <script type="text/javascript" src="angular/angular.min.js"></script> 
    <!-- Angular Libraries -->
    <script type="text/javascript" src="angular/angular-route.js"></script>
    <!-- This one handles the alert notifications -->
    <script type="text/javascript" src="angular/angular-flash.min.js"></script>

    <!-- App related libraries -->
    <script type="text/javascript" src="js/services/portfolioServices.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="js/controllers/myWorkControllers.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="js/controllers/navController.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="js/controllers/aboutController.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="js/controllers/contactController.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="js/directives/portfolioDirectives.js"></script>
 Then this is my Service javascript with the config portfolioApp = angular.module('portfolioApp', ['ngRoute']);

portfolioApp.config(['$routeProvider', '$locationProvider', function($routeProvider, $locationProvider) {
    $routeProvider
        .when('/mywork', {
            templateUrl: 'partials/mywork.htm',
            controller: 'myWorkController'
        })
        .when('/about', {
            templateUrl: 'partials/about.htm',
            controller: 'aboutController'
        })
        .when('/contact', {
            templateUrl: 'partials/contact.htm',
            controller: 'contactController'
        })
        .otherwise({redirectTo: '/mywork'});    
        $locationProvider.html5Mode(true);
}]);
 Each of those controllers is only defined, nothing special, the name and the function injecting the $scope. Nothing in them. Basically, the URL without using the html5Mode is http://localhost:8080/template/#/
 I would like to be: http://localhost:8080/mywork
http://localhost:8080/about
http://localhost:8080/contact
 Now, i could make it work... by accessing to http://localhost:8080/template it gets redirected to those url's above... but when i refresh the page with Ctrl+F5, i get a 404 Not Found from Tomcat! :S how come?? the path shouldn't be solved by angular? Please what am I doing wrong in here?

@LINK:/questions/20725770/chrome-extension-content-scripts-custom-ui
@TITLE:Chrome extension content scripts custom ui
@CONTENT:I'm in the process of writing a chrome extension which displays some custom UI in multiple web pages via script injection. The script which I am injecting into the page appends some Dom items onto the document's body which can be interacted with by the user. The problem is, the items' styles are being affected by the page's css. I have solved this for the most part by applying css to each item as it's inserted into the dom. $('item').css({....});
 The problem with this is, I end up with huge blocks of styling that look like this: $('.item').css({
            '-webkit-box-sizing' : 'border-box',
            'box-sizing' : 'border-box',
            'resize' : 'both',
            'overflow' : 'hidden',
            'position' : 'absolute',
            'padding-top' : '.2em',
            'padding-right' : '.2em',
            'padding-left' : '.2em',
            'padding-bottom' : '.4em',
            'opacity' : '.8',
            'background' : 'rgba(0,0,0,.5)',
            'background-image' : '-webkit-gradient(linear, 0 0, 0 100%, from(#444444), to(#111111))',
            'background-image' : '-webkit-linear-gradient(#444444, #111111)',
            'background-image' : 'linear-gradient(#444444, #111111)',
            'border-radius' : '4px',
            'box-shadow' : '3px 2px 4px 1px #111111',
        });
        this.$el.children(".default").css({
            'font-size':'medium',
            '-webkit-box-sizing' : 'border-box',
            'box-sizing' : 'border-box',
            'resize' : 'none',
            'overflow' : 'auto',
            'display' : 'inherit',
            'position' : 'relative',
            'padding' : '.25em',
            'width' : '100%',
            'height' : '90%',
            'background' : '#efefef',
            'border-radius' : '2px',
        });
 This whole method is going to become a problem because: First: any property which I don't apply here is applied to my items by the page's css, this changes the style and usability of my elements. Second: I feel like this method is inefficient. Third: My content script contains jquery and some others which i'm afraid will also interfere with the page and it's own version of these Is there a better way to display these dom elements, inject these scripts, and style them? I would like as little clash with the parent page as possible. An idea that I came up with was covering the entire page in a transparent iframe and injecting everything into that, but I don't believe the items would display since the iframe would be transparent.
@CODE:$('item').css({....}); $('.item').css({
            '-webkit-box-sizing' : 'border-box',
            'box-sizing' : 'border-box',

@TITLE:Is dp based on the physical size of the screen? (dp =1/160 of an inch)
@CONTENT:Is this definition correct? dp Density-independent Pixels - 1/160 of an inch based on the physical size of the screen. I have found conflicting information: The official documentation assumes scaled proportionally in equation px = dp * (dpi / 160). Also here (3:02) Roman Nurik says scaled proportionally But in official documentation: px Pixels - corresponds to actual pixels on the screen. in Inches - based on the physical size of the screen. mm Millimeters - based on the physical size of the screen. pt Points - 1/72 of an inch based on the physical size of the screen. dp Density-independent Pixels - An abstract unit that is based on the physical density of the screen. These units are relative to a 160 dpi (dots per inch) screen, on which 1dp is roughly equal to 1px. When running on a higher density screen, the number of pixels used to draw 1dp is scaled up by a factor appropriate for the screen's dpi. Likewise, when on a lower density screen, the number of pixels used for 1dp is scaled down. The ratio of dp-to-pixel will change with the screen density, but not necessarily in direct proportion. If my definition is correct, Why introduce a new physical size measure if we already have the well-known mm, in and pt?

 I have learned that it was either one of those two. But it seems here that it passes an user-defined constructor method, e.g. Runnable(). It seems they want to run the thread at a later time, but when? And is this even legal, I assume it is, but I never heard of such a thing in my Java class.

@TITLE:How do you Resolve signalR v2.0 with StructureMap v2.6
@CONTENT:In Application_Start of Global.asax i have the following  ObjectFactory.Initialize(cfg => {
     cfg.For<IDependencyResolver>().Singleton().Add<StructureMapDependencyResolver>    ();
 });
 My Interface for the Hub is public interface IDashboardHub
{
    void Initialize();
}
 and my hub is as follows: public class DashboardHub : Hub, IDashboardHub
{
    private readonly ICpeAccountService _accountService;

    public DashboardHub(ICpeAccountService service)
    {
        _accountService = service;
    }

    [Authorize]
    public void Initialize()
    {
        Clients.All.UpdateStatus("Hello World!!!");
    }
}
 If I remove the injected constructor and the Resolver then I get the "Hello World" signal and the JavaScript display the value. If I just remove the resolver then signalR no longer finds a parameterless constructor and the Initialize methods does not get called. If I include the StructureMap dependency resolver (which is working and injecting around 40 other classes right now) then i get the following exception message StructureMap configuration failures: Error:  104

 Also if I try to just resolve this all in startup.cs, like this: public void Configuration(IAppBuilder app)
{
    ObjectFactory.Initialize(cfg =>
    {
            cfg.For<IDependencyResolver>()
               .Singleton()
               .Add<StructureMapDependencyResolver>();
        });

    app.MapSignalR();
}
 I also get the same error. Has anyone been able to resolve this issue?

@TITLE:Parameters of a custom ember block helper
@CONTENT:I'm writing a simple restaurant menu and I need to check if two values are equal inside of handlebars template. To be more specific, I have bunch of dish models which have a category_id field. So I need to show a dish if it has the same category_id as category in which we are now. And I have the following helper: Em.Handlebars.registerHelper 'ifEqual', (v1, v2) -> 
  # debugging
  console.log v1, v2
  return v1 == v2
 and I use it this way: .categories
  =hb 'each c in categories' do
    %ul
      %li=hb 'c.name'
        =hb 'each d in dishes' do
          %ul
            =hb 'ifEqual d.category_id c.id' do
              %li=hb 'd.name'
 (Sorry for hamlbars and coffeescript, but it should be pretty clear) The problem is that console.log outputs strings "d.category_id" and "c.id" and I have no idea why it work this way. On the other hand following non-block helper works pretty nice and outputs actual values Em.Handlebars.helper 'console-log', (v1, v2) -> 
  console.log typeof(v1), v1
  console.log typeof(v2), v2
 Any ideas why it works this way and what I've done wrong?

 The contents of /tmp/HelloWorld' areHELLO WORLD`. Here is what index.php looks like: <?php
echo empty($_FILES); 
print_r($_REQUEST);

print_r($_GET);

 The output looks like this, which seems to imply that the file contents are sent into $_REQUEST and $_POST, rather than $_FILES 1

@TITLE:Can someone explain redis setbit command?
@CONTENT:> setbit mykey 1 1
> setbit mykey 7 1
 When I store string value 1 and 7 into "mykey", what was exactly stored in redis? And how the getbit works inside redis? Does anyone try to loop the bit inside this value? I know bitcount will give me number 2, but I also want to get the exact string value 1 and 7 from it, is it possible? -- I doing some experiment by using erlang redis client to read the output. > setbit mykey 1 1
 erlang output: <<"@">>
 Then I delete this entry: > del mykey
 I do the same thing to offset 2 4 8, here you can see the mapping: When offset is 1, the output is <<"@">>;
When offset is 2, the output is <<" ">>;
When offset is 4, the output is <<"\b">>;
When offset is 8, the output is <<0,128>>;
 Honestly, I am more confused now. Or someone can explain this "bitops.c" -- updates --- Maybe I should mention the reason why I want to do this to make the question more clear. We all know it will be cool to use bitmap to store online users. What I am trying to do is get the exactly user id who is online from what redis stored. Just finished a quick version to extract offsets from redis. Please feel free to improve it.

@TITLE:Controlling mouse when Java window is out of focus
@CONTENT:I'm interested in writing a program that will assist me in marking exam papers online. I would like to use the keyboard to control the mouse eg if I press '1' then the mouse will be sent to a specified location and click there. This will double my work output at least. The problem is marking is done through Internet Explorer so the Java program will be out of focus. From searching this site I found that someone has written a library that can receive keyboard input out of focus but I couldn't find any such thing for mice (I don't think Java Robot works out of focus). Does anyone know whether such a program is possible in Java using standard libraries?

@TITLE:Android Camera API - Weird zoom effect [closed]
@CONTENT:I am using the android camera API for a project I am working on at the moment and I came across a rather strange behavior. When I change the preview size to go to a higher resolution, I indeed get a much better quality preview but there is also this annoying zoom effect that occurs: Say I am holding my device at 5 cm from a object in 1024x512, I can see it entirely. But if I change to 1920x1080, It's like I've zoomed into the object and I need to go further away to capture it entirely. Now that's a bit disappointing as I want a higher resolution to get more details of my object but if I have to go further away from it then the sensor is not sensible enough to get those details. Is there something I misunderstood with the Camera API maybe?

 Configuration: Jenkins 1.509.2 job using Maven 2.2.1. Jenkins is running under Tomcat 7.0.11. Jenkins Sonar plugin version 2.1. Sonar XML plugin version 1.0.1. SonarQube 4.0 analysis using XML language profile. I tried initiating the Sonar analysis from the Jenkins job using both a) SonarQube runner 2.3 via Maven post-build step; and b) directly using a Sonar post-build action. Both give the same result. Note that the SonarQube analysis still completes and I can see the results in SonarQube. I also tried running the job using Maven 3.0.3. Same result.

@TITLE:ignoring file lib.a, file was built for archive which is not the architecture being linked (x86_64)
@CONTENT:I'm trying to code a printf clone. I've built a library file called "libftprintf.a" but when I try to use it, I get the following error, on Mac OSX 10.8.5: ld: warning: ignoring file ./libftprintf.a, file was built for archive which is not the architecture being linked (x86_64): ./libftprintf.a
 Strangely this works fine (but I need only one lib called libftprintf, so this is not acceptable): gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -I libft/includes/ -o ft_printf_test.bin -L libft -lft -L. -lftprintf ft_printf_test.c
 I suspect I have misused the ar command to link both libs together. But I don't se my mistake yet. What could be the cause of that? Everything seems to compile just fine until I try to use the libftprintf.a file with the make test command. I've searched for a solution on Google, but most answers relate to XCode only. According to lipo -info, the files are x86_64. My GCC version: $> gcc --version

 I'm not really sure what I do in the controller though?

@TITLE:Eclipse gradle project's spring xml validation
@CONTENT:I have a gradle project in my Eclipse with a number of spring-integration context XMLs. These context XML files used to validate okay against the spring-integration schemas but now, for some reason, they are showing 'cvc-complex-type' errors. e.g. I have an element with an error-channel attribute. But on validation, it has started saying: "cvc-complex-type.3.2.2: Attribute 'error-channel' is not allowed to appear in element 'int:gateway'." Now, looking in my Eclipse preferences' General -> Network Connections -> Cache, I can see that only spring-integration-1.0.xsd is in the cache (which wouldn't know anything about an error-channel attribute in gateway element), so I can see why the validation error appears. But, my project's classpath is working with spring-integration-core-2.2.0 so I would expect the spring context XMLs to validate against spring-integration-2.2.xsd schema, but it no longer does, for some unknown reason. My spring context XMLs, have the following namespace declaration: http://www.springframework.org/schema/integration http://www.springframework.org/schema/integration/spring-integration.xsd.
 Any ideas why the validation is not happening against spring-integration-2.2.xsd schemas any more? And what may have caused it? The project itself, still compiles and runs okay as the project itself is aware of the 2.2 xsd schema, but not Eclipse. Thanks for any help on this matter, PM.

 The question is: What has changes and how can I make the intent work again? The expected behaviour: In selecting a file with *.pf extension in a file-manger (like Astro) my application should be started and the file should be opened. Also the file-manger should use us the provided icon to visualize the file.

@TITLE:How to make Segue Pass Data AND ONLY execute if certain criteria is met
@CONTENT:I have a Login page with a button. When I click on it, IF and ONLY IF the login was successful, I want to pass data to another class (using properties). I have tried using a Segue on the Button to pass the data, but the problem is that this Segue always goes to the next View, EVEN when the login is unsuccessful, in which case it should NOT.  -(void) prepareForSegue:(UIStoryboardSegue *)segue sender:(id)sender {            
if ([[segue identifier] isEqualToString:@"gotoMainPage"] ) {
MainPageController *mpc = [segue destinationViewController];     
mpc.username = @"TEST";    }
 How can I make the Segue ONLY go to the destinationController, if the login is successful ? I am aware that there are other ways to go to another ViewController, such as setting an IBAction on the button, and when login is successful, use instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier and presentViewController, and I HAVE tried with those too, but the issue here is that, it does NOT pass the data to another class. Help is appreciated. Thanks

@TITLE:How to run silent installer in C#
@CONTENT:I have the following C# code: string desktopPath = Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.Desktop);
Process.Start("cmd.exe", "/c" + desktopPath + "\\" + "MyInstaller_7.1.51.14.exe Vs Vv Vqn");
 The first line gets the path of my desktop where the .exe is located. The string desktopPath is used in the second line. The second line is supposed to start the installer in silent mode, so that the process runs in the background and the installation wizard does NOT appear at all. Running the string result of desktopPath + "\\" + "MyInstaller_7.1.51.14.exe Vs Vv Vqn" in the command prompt works just fine, and the installer runs in silent mode. In case anyone is wondering, the string result of desktopPath + "\\" + "MyInstaller_7.1.51.14.exe Vs Vv Vqn" is C:\Users\ME\Desktop\MyInstaller_7.1.51.14.exe -s -v -qn and running this in the command prompt runs the installation in silent mode. Unfortunately, triggering the same command in C# code as this: Process.Start("cmd.exe", "/c" + desktopPath + "\\" + "MyInstaller_7.1.51.14.exe Vs Vv Vqn");
 does not run the installer in silent mode. Instead, the wizard comes up, visible to the user. Does anyone know how I can modify this: string desktopPath = Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.Desktop);
Process.Start("cmd.exe", "/c" + desktopPath + "\\" + "MyInstaller_7.1.51.14.exe Vs Vv Vqn");
 so that the installer actually runs in silent mode, without the installer UI showing?? SIDE NOTE: Vs Vv Vqn are switches for running in silent mode.
@CODE:string desktopPath = Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.Desktop);
Process.Start("cmd.exe", "/c" + desktopPath + "\\" + "MyInstaller_7.1.51.14.exe Vs Vv Vqn"); desktopPath desktopPath + "\\" + "MyInstaller_7.1.51.14.exe Vs Vv Vqn" desktopPath + "\\" + "MyInstaller_7.1.51.14.exe Vs Vv Vqn" C:\Users\ME\Desktop\MyInstaller_7.1.51.14.exe -s -v -qn Process.Start("cmd.exe", "/c" + desktopPath + "\\" + "MyInstaller_7.1.51.14.exe Vs Vv Vqn"); string desktopPath = Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.Desktop);

@TITLE:winapi BN_CLICKED how to identify which button was clicked?
@CONTENT:I'm creating a simple win32 program using c++, although I think i'm only using c in this app. I need to determine which HWND button was pressed on the app. I've searched msdn reference and it only told me HIWORD is the notification code, and LOWORD is the identifier, for the BN_CLICKED message. I've managed to get as far as determining when a button is clicked, but it only applies for all buttons. All my buttons are created in the WM_CREATE message. This is what i managed to whip up so far: case: WM_CREATE:
    HWND hPlus = CreateWindowEx( 0, L"BUTTON", L"+", WS_CHILD | WS_VISIBLE, 130, 240, 35, 30, hwnd, ( HMENU )IDC_MENU, GetModuleHandle( NULL ), NULL );
    HWND hEquals = CreateWindowEx( 0, L"BUTTON", L"=", WS_CHILD | WS_VISIBLE, 170, 205, 65, 65, hwnd, ( HMENU )IDC_MENU, GetModuleHandle( NULL ), NULL );
break;

case WM_COMMAND:
    switch( HIWORD( wParam ) )
    {
        case BN_CLICKED:
            MessageBox( hwnd, L"OK", "OK", MB_OK );
            break;
    }
    break;
 I've tried comparing hEquals to LOWORD( wParam ) but that gave me an error when compiling. I think I also tried comparing it to HIWORD and LOWORD of lParam as well, which also didn't compile. Now I'm clueless for what to do next.
@CODE:case: WM_CREATE:

@CONTENT:I created a module then use upgrade script to add a multiselect attribute. the attribute is using 'source' to get it values dynamically. the code is the following: Add Attribute: $installer = Mage::getResourceModel('catalog/setup', 'catalog_setup');

$installer->startSetup();

$productEntityId = $installer->getEntityTypeId('catalog_product');

$allAttributeSetIds = $installer->getAllAttributeSetIds($productEntityId);

$installer->addAttribute('catalog_product', 'badge',array(
        'label' => 'Badge', 
        'type' => 'varchar', 
        'input' => 'multiselect', 
        'backend' => 'eav/entity_attribute_backend_array',

$attributeId= $installer->getAttributeId($productEntityId, 'badge');

//add to General Group of all attribute sets
foreach($allAttributeSetIds as $attributeSetId) {
    $installer->addAttributeToSet($productEntityId, $attributeSetId, 'General',  $attributeId);
}

$installer->endSetup();
 The Source is: class Module_Model_Entity_Attribute_Source_Superbadge_Config extends Mage_Eav_Model_Entity_Attribute_Source_Boolean
{
    /**
     * Retrieve all attribute options

     public function getAllOptions()
    {
        if (!$this->_options) {
            $superbadge = array();
            $badges = Mage::getModel('module/rule')->getCollection()->getSuperBadge();
            foreach ($badges as $badge){
                $superbadge[] = array('label' => $badge->getName(),
                        'value' =>  $badge->getId());

            $this->_options = $superbadge;
        }
        return $this->_options;
    }

}
 The code is working fine am able to retrieve the value dynamically but the problem when the module is disable it is throwing an error directory could not found when am creating a new product in admin. error: Warning: include(Mage\Module\Model\Entity\Attribute\Source\Superbadge\Config.php) [function.include]: failed to open stream: No such file or directory  in C:\Sites\project\development\lib\Varien\Autoload.php on line 93
 Is there a way to prevent this error when the module is disable? i dont want to do uninstall as i will lost all data in my db. Thanks for any guide or help you may provide me..

 I'd like the fields [period] and [Value] to be pivoted somehow based on their [indicator] and [scenario_code] fields. There are three indicator values (2,3,4) and three scenario codes (7,16,17). I'm looking to group the rows by scenario_code and have each corresponding indicator value as it's own field. The result, three rows, should look like this. {[Scernario_code], [Period 2], [Value 2], [Period 3], [Value 3], [Period 4], [Value 4], [Area Code], [Release code]} 7, '2000-06-13', 1000, '2000-01-12', 1300, '2000-06-12', 600, 'OP014', 17 16, '2000-09-12', 1100, '2000-06-17', 500, '2000-12-12', 650, 'OP014', 17 17, '2002-06-22', 1200, '2008-05-04', 550, '2013-06-12', 150, 'OP014', 17 The period and value columns have been spread across, based on their three indicator values(2,3,4) which are bound to one [scenario_code]. I've suffixed the columns with the indicator value it was pivoted on. Ideally I will alias them as something else. Thoughts This is obviously screaming pivot or unpivot (Or even both) but my text books don't have something where I need to consider two columns for the spreading element [period] & [Value]. I need data to be rotated by indicator value so they are columns, but grouped on the same line as it's scenario code. Maybe a concatenation would help...? I've seen CROSS APPLY with a Pivot which looks promising but I haven't been able to get it to work as I don't fully understand how this is utilised. I've recently started using SQL Server 2012.

@LINK:/questions/20630888/widget-does-not-works-after-clear-memory
@TITLE:Widget does not works after Clear Memory
@CONTENT:The problem is that after I use the built in Task Manager's Clean Memory/Ram, My widget stops working .I guess this is related to the Task Manager's method of cleaning RAM.After a lot of research and some attempts, I found that i need BroadcastReciever to listen to package changes and updates: So i implemented but its not working because document says that the Restarted/Cleared package does not receive this broadcast register receiver in the manifest file: <receiver android:name="com.app.lab.receiver.onRestartReciever">
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.PACKAGE_REPLACED" />
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.PACKAGE_RESTARTED" />
         <action android:name="android.intent.action.PACKAGE_DATA_CLEARED"/>
        <data android:scheme="package"  />
    </intent-filter>
 PACKAGE_REPLACED - called in particular to notify application update. PACKAGE_RESTARTED - called when most memory cleaners are cleaning memmory. the "data" row is used to monitor action applied for the specific package. public class onRestartReciever extends BroadcastReceiver {
@Override
public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
// TODO Auto-generated method stub
Log.d("DEBUG", "onRestartReciever");//I am not getting this log on clearing memory from task manager



}
}
 I tried to use dummy service to get its lifecycle ie to check when onDestroy is called but what I found it not a reliable way ,onDestroy may not be called when application is killed by Task Manager. So finally, my question : Is there any way to tell the android system to reStart appWidgets when Task manager or OS cleans memory . Note: My widget contains only one button that launches an Activity.It works most of the time but stops responding if OS itself cleans memory or user forcefully do it from task manager.I've downloaded some of the widget it seem to continue working fine after cleaning memory also. Update: To under my problem no need of going through complete code it is simple Application . My application dose not contain any Activty or Service. It contains only widget with one button which gives toast message.There is only two class in my application(WidgetProvider and onRestartReciever) thats it Widget class WidgetProvider.class  public class WidgetProvider extends AppWidgetProvider {

private RemoteViews remoteViews;
private ComponentName watchWidget;
PendingIntent pi;
@Override
public void onUpdate(Context context, AppWidgetManager appWidgetManager,
        int[] appWidgetIds) {
    remoteViews = new RemoteViews(context.getPackageName(),
            R.layout.touchwidget);
   Intent toggleClickPlayer = new Intent(context.getApplicationContext() ,WidgetProvider.class);
    toggleClickPlayer.setAction("PLAYER");
    PendingIntent toggleIntentPlayer = PendingIntent.getBroadcast(context,0, toggleClickPlayer,endingIntent.FLAG_CANCEL_CURRENT);
    remoteViews.setOnClickPendingIntent(R.id.player, toggleIntentPlayer);
    appWidgetManager.updateAppWidget(appWidgetIds, remoteViews);
}

@Override
public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
    super.onReceive(context, intent);
    watchWidget = new ComponentName(context,WidgetProvider.class);
    remoteViews = new RemoteViews(context.getPackageName(),R.layout.touchwidget);
Toast.makeText(context, " Player started",Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
(AppWidgetManager.getInstance(context)).updateAppWidget(watchWidget, remoteViews);
        }
    } 
 }
@CODE:that the package does not receive this broadcast <receiver android:name="com.app.lab.receiver.onRestartReciever">

         <action android:name="android.intent.action.PACKAGE_DATA_CLEARED"/>

@LINK:/questions/20624105/mysql-export-piped-to-another-mysql-server-using-a-custom-query
@TITLE:Mysql export piped to another mysql server using a custom query
@CONTENT:I am trying to do an export of a table in 1 mysql server and pipe the data directly to the new sql server. Lets say that I have a User Table that has 2 groups of users group = 1 or group = 2 What i want to do is something like: SELECT * FROM `User` WHERE `User`.`group`=1 | mysql -h newhost.com -u root -p dbname newTable
 Some of these queries will have joins if that makes a difference I have tried: mysql -e"SELECT * FROM `User` WHERE `User`.`group`=1" -u root -pxxxxxxx dbname| mysql -h newhost.com -u root -pxxxxxxxxx newDbName NewUserTable
 This for some reason just throws tons of errors. It looks like it opens the mysql terminal then it just shows usage info. Heres a closer example to what I am trying to do: mysqldump -u root -pxxxxxxxx dbname Article --no_create_info --max-allowed-packet=1073741824 --lock-all-tables --where 'article_id in (SELECT article_id FROM Article LEFT JOIN Client on Article.client = Client.client_id LEFT JOIN Company on Client.company = Company.company_id WHERE Company.name="Company1")' | mysql -h rds.amazonaws.com -u root -pxxxxxxxx newdbname Article
 When i run this in the terminal i get the mysql usage options output followed by: mysqldump: Got errno 32 on write SOLUTION Using mysqldump i was able to use a custom where statement that had a nested select that selected the ids of the table i was looking to move. NOTE: When using nested SELECT you must include the table name with the column name. IE Table1.column1. Also make sure that all of your options come before your database name. And finally when piping the data to the mysql server do not include the table name after the database. Final working command: mysqldump -u root -pxxxxxxxx --no_create_info --max-allowed-packet=1073741824 --lock-all-tables --where 'article_id in (SELECT Article.article_id FROM Article LEFT JOIN Client on Article.client = Client.client_id LEFT JOIN Company on Client.company = Company.company_id WHERE Company.name="Company1")' dbname Article | mysql -h rds.amazonaws.com -u root -pxxxxxxxx newdbname
@CODE:User group = 1 group = 2 SELECT * FROM `User` WHERE `User`.`group`=1 | mysql -h newhost.com -u root -p dbname newTable mysql -e"SELECT * FROM `User` WHERE `User`.`group`=1" -u root -pxxxxxxx dbname| mysql -h newhost.com -u root -pxxxxxxxxx newDbName NewUserTable mysqldump -u root -pxxxxxxxx dbname Article --no_create_info --max-allowed-packet=1073741824 --lock-all-tables --where 'article_id in (SELECT article_id FROM Article LEFT JOIN Client on Article.client = Client.client_id LEFT JOIN Company on Client.company = Company.company_id WHERE Company.name="Company1")' | mysql -h rds.amazonaws.com -u root -pxxxxxxxx newdbname Article mysqldump: Got errno 32 on write mysqldump -u root -pxxxxxxxx --no_create_info --max-allowed-packet=1073741824 --lock-all-tables --where 'article_id in (SELECT Article.article_id FROM Article LEFT JOIN Client on Article.client = Client.client_id LEFT JOIN Company on Client.company = Company.company_id WHERE Company.name="Company1")' dbname Article | mysql -h rds.amazonaws.com -u root -pxxxxxxxx newdbname WHERE mysqldump CREATE TABLE sometablename AS SELECT ...some complex query... mysqldump

 } And the following code in the Server: String username = inp.readUTF();
System.out.println(username);
out.writeBoolean(false);

System.out.println("wrote boolean, waiting for fn/ln/un");
fn = inp.readUTF();
System.out.println("got fn");
ln = inp.readUTF();
un = inp.readUTF();
 But when the button that calls SBListener is clicked, the program freezes when it gets to the point where the Server is waiting for fn/ln/username. I added a bunch of system.out statements for debugging and I get up to the one that says "wrote boolean, waiting for fn/ln/un". Basically, I'm trying to update the screen after the Server returns a false value. Specifically, I want to add two text fields for first & last name. I then want to send those values to the server. Can anyone tell me how to fix this? Thanks in advance for any help!
@CODE:public class SBListener implements ActionListener{
  public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e){
     try{
        outToServer.writeUTF(usn.getText().trim());
        System.out.println("sent username to server");
        playerExists = inToClient.readBoolean();
        System.out.println("past getting player");
        System.out.println("player exists = " + playerExists);
     }catch(IOException a){
        System.err.println(a);
     }
     if(playerExists == false){
        JButton submitInfo = new JButton("submit info");
        submitInfo.addActionListener(new SBNewInfoListener());
        init.add(new JLabel(""));//dummy element to get the right alignment

        add(init, BorderLayout.WEST);
        init.setVisible(true);
        init.revalidate();
        init.repaint();
     }

  } String username = inp.readUTF();
System.out.println(username);
out.writeBoolean(false);

@LINK:/questions/20606084/neo4j-implementing-soft-delete-with-optional-relationships
@TITLE:Neo4j: implementing soft delete with optional relationships
@CONTENT:I'm trying to implement a soft delete in Neo4j. The graph described in Cypher from Alice's viewpoint is as such: (clyde:User)<-[:FOLLOWS]-(alice:User)-[:LIKES]->(bob:User)
 Instead of actually deleting a node and its relationships, I'm changing its label so it can no longer be looked up directly, i.e. dropping its User label and adding a _User label (notice the underscore) replacing its relationships so it can't be reached anymore by my normal queries, e.g. deleting its :FOLLOWS relationships and replacing it with :_FOLLOWS relationships. So this is basically the equivalent of moving a row to an archiving table in a relational database. I figured this is a pretty efficient approach because you're effectively never visiting the parts of the graph that have been soft-deleted. Also, you don't have to modify any of your existing queries. The result of soft-deleting Alice should be this: (clyde:User)<-[:_FOLLOWS]-(alice:_User)-[:_LIKES]->(bob:User)
 My first attempt at the query was this: match (user:User {Id: 1})
optional match (user)-[follows:FOLLOWS]->(subject)
remove user:User set user:_User
delete follows
create (user)-[:_FOLLOWS]->(subject);
 The problem is that when this user is not following anyone, the query tries to create a relationship between user and null because the second match is optional, so it gives me this error: Other node is null. My second attempt was this: match (user:User {Id: 1})
remove user:User set user:_User
optional match (user)-[follows:FOLLOWS]->(subject)
foreach (f in filter(f in collect({r: follows, n: subject}) where f.r is not null) | delete f.r create (user)-[:_FOLLOWS]->(f.n));
 So I'm putting the relationship and the subject into a map, collecting these maps in a collection, throwing every "empty" map away and looping over the collection. But this query gives me this error: SyntaxException: Invalid input '.': expected an identifier character, node labels, a property map, whitespace or ')' (line 1, column 238)
 Does anyone know how I can fix this? Thanks, Jan

@TITLE:Clang linker reports symbol not found, despite 'nm -m' revealing that the name exists in a library that is being linked against
@CONTENT:On OS X (clang), during linkage stage, a symbol (boost::filesystem::portable_posix_name) in my code is not being found. Here is a brief code snippet that contains the function I am calling in my code: if (boost::filesystem::is_directory(settings.parent_path())
 && boost::filesystem::portable_posix_name(settings.filename().string()))
{ ... }
 (Please let me know if more context in my code snippet is required.) The linker command line, used when the program compiles and links, contains the following: -L/Users/administrator/boost_1_54_0/lib -lboost_filesystem ... And the path and filename indicated (both libboost_filesystem.a and libboost_filesystem.dylib) exist at the path indicated. The linker cannot find the Boost function boost::filesystem::portable_posix_name(std::string const &): Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64: "boost::filesystem::portable_posix_name(std::__1::basic_string<char, std::__1::char_traits<char>, std::__1::allocator<char> > const&)" However, I do see that this function exists in both the .a and .dylib files in question: nm -m ./libboost_filesystem.a reveals 00000000000090f0 (__TEXT,__text) external __ZN5boost10filesystem19portable_posix_nameERKSs, and running the mangled function name __ZN5boost10filesystem19portable_posix_nameERKSs line through the demangler reveals: _boost::filesystem::portable_posix_name(std::string const&) ... I trust that the underscore that precedes the name is correct, because other functions that ARE found also have the preceding underscore. (The .dylib file also contains the same mangled string). I have confirmed that the architecture of both the .a and .dylib files are correct: otool -hv ./libboost_filesystem.a shows 'x86_64' through-and-through (and ditto for the .dylib). Just to be sure the library was actually being found and linked, I changed the name of the library in the compile command line as follows: -L/Users/administrator/boost_1_54_0/lib -lboost_filesystemm (notice the double mm at the end of the filename), just to confirm that that a "library not found" error was returned, and it was: ld: library not found for -lboost_filesystemm. I have also confirmed that the only occurrences in the file system of the libboost_filesystem.a and .dylib files are those within the given Boost directory tree (one in the /lib directory, and another one of the same size and almost identical creation date/time in the /bin.v2 subdirectory); also, changing the -L/Users/administrator/boost_1_54_0/lib line to make it junk causes a ld: library not found for -lboost_filesystem error to appear. Oddly, when I grep the nm -m output for the presence of boost::filesystem::is_directory, no results appear in the symbol table for the library for the latter function, even though there is no linker error for this function. This seems awfully backwards to me (the function that does not appear in the library links fine, but the function that does appear in the library gives a linker error?) - but that question is for another day (and, perhaps, there actually would be an undefined symbol error for this function, but it's not being shown due to the first undefined symbol error). My question is: Why is this symbol not found, despite the fact that the correct library, with the correct architecture, with the correct external symbol, is being linked? In response to @Sebastian's answer, I am here pasting the full command line for the linker. This command line is created by Qt (this is a Qt project). Note that the -lboost_filesystem argument appears after all object files have been listed. /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/clang++ -headerpad_max_install_names -Wl,-syslibroot,/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.9.sdk -stdlib=libc++ -mmacosx-version-min=10.7 -o NewGene.app/Contents/MacOS/NewGene main.o newgenemainwindow.o newgenecreateoutput.o newgeneselectvariables.o newgenevariablesummary.o newgenetabwidget.o newgenevariablegroup.o newgenevariables.o newgenevariablegroupsscrollarea.o newgenevariablestoolboxwrapper.o newgenevariablestoolbox.o newgenevariablesummaryscrollarea.o newgenevariablesummarygroup.o kadcolumnselectionbox.o timerangebox.o newgenewidget.o uisettingsmanager.o uimodelmanager.o uidocumentmanager.o uistatusmanager.o globals.o uimanager.o settingchangeresponseindicator.o settingchangerequestindicator.o settingchangeindicator.o projectsettingchangeindicator.o globalsettingchangeindicator.o settingchangeresponseitem.o settingchangerequestitem.o settingchangeitem.o projectsettingchangeitem.o globalsettingchangeitem.o globalsettingchangerequestindicator.o globalsettingchangeresponseindicator.o globalsettingchangerequestitem.o globalsettingchangeresponseitem.o projectsettingchangerequestindicator.o projectsettingchangeresponseindicator.o projectsettingchangerequestitem.o projectsettingchangeresponseitem.o modelchangeresponse.o modelchangerequest.o modelchangeindicator.o modelchangeresponseitem.o modelchangerequestitem.o modelchangeitem.o uiprojectmanager.o newgenefilenames.o uiloggingmanager.o newgeneapplication.o uiallsettings.o uisetting.o uimessager.o uiinputproject.o uioutputproject.o uiinputmodel.o uioutputmodel.o uiallprojectsettings.o uimodel.o uiproject.o uiinputprojectsettings.o uioutputprojectsettings.o uiallglobalsettings.o uiallglobalsettings_list.o uiinputprojectsettings_list.o uioutputprojectsettings_list.o uithreadmanager.o uitriggermanager.o uimodelsettings.o uiinputmodelsettings.o uioutputmodelsettings.o eventloopthreadmanager.o workqueuemanager.o outputprojectworkqueue_base.o inputprojectworkqueue_base.o inputprojectworkqueue.o outputprojectworkqueue.o inputmodelworkqueue_base.o outputmodelworkqueue_base.o inputmodelworkqueue.o outputmodelworkqueue.o inputprojectsettingsworkqueue_base.o outputprojectsettingsworkqueue_base.o globalsettingsworkqueue_base.o inputmodelsettingsworkqueue_base.o outputmodelsettingsworkqueue_base.o globalsettingsworkqueue.o inputmodelsettingsworkqueue.o outputmodelsettingsworkqueue.o inputprojectsettingsworkqueue.o outputprojectsettingsworkqueue.o uiuidatamanager.o uiuiactionmanager.o uimodelactionmanager.o uiprojectmanagerworkqueue_base.o uiprojectmanagerworkqueue.o uiwidgetdatarefresh.o uimessagersingleshot.o modelworkqueue.o uiaction.o variablegroupsetmemberselectionchange.o kadwidgetsscrollarea.o kadspinbox.o kadcountchange.o generateoutput.o newgenedatetimewidget.o timerangechange.o newgenegenerateoutput.o generaloptions.o qrc_NewGeneResources.o moc_newgenemainwindow.o moc_newgenecreateoutput.o moc_newgeneselectvariables.o moc_newgenevariablesummary.o moc_newgenetabwidget.o moc_newgenevariablegroup.o moc_newgenevariables.o moc_newgenevariablegroupsscrollarea.o moc_newgenevariablestoolboxwrapper.o moc_newgenevariablestoolbox.o moc_newgenevariablesummaryscrollarea.o moc_newgenevariablesummarygroup.o moc_kadcolumnselectionbox.o moc_timerangebox.o moc_uisettingsmanager.o moc_uimodelmanager.o moc_uidocumentmanager.o moc_uistatusmanager.o moc_globalsettingchangerequestindicator.o moc_globalsettingchangeresponseindicator.o moc_globalsettingchangerequestitem.o moc_globalsettingchangeresponseitem.o moc_projectsettingchangerequestindicator.o moc_projectsettingchangeresponseindicator.o moc_projectsettingchangerequestitem.o moc_projectsettingchangeresponseitem.o moc_modelchangeresponse.o moc_modelchangerequest.o moc_modelchangeindicator.o moc_modelchangeresponseitem.o moc_modelchangerequestitem.o moc_modelchangeitem.o moc_uiprojectmanager.o moc_uiloggingmanager.o moc_newgeneapplication.o moc_uimessager.o moc_uiinputproject.o moc_uioutputproject.o moc_uiinputmodel.o moc_uioutputmodel.o moc_uiinputprojectsettings.o moc_uioutputprojectsettings.o moc_uiallglobalsettings.o moc_uithreadmanager.o moc_uitriggermanager.o moc_uiinputmodelsettings.o moc_uioutputmodelsettings.o moc_workqueuemanager.o moc_uiuidatamanager.o moc_uiuiactionmanager.o moc_uimodelactionmanager.o moc_kadwidgetsscrollarea.o moc_kadspinbox.o moc_newgenedatetimewidget.o moc_newgenegenerateoutput.o -F/Users/administrator/Qt/5.1.1/clang_64/lib -L/Users/administrator/newgene/NewGeneUI/NewGene/../../NewGeneBackEnd/OSX/NewGene/DerivedData/NewGene/Build/Products/Debug -lNewGene -L/Users/administrator/boost_1_54_0/lib -lboost_filesystem -framework QtWidgets -framework QtGui -framework QtCore -framework OpenGL -framework AGL

@CONTENT:I added an opt-in form/freebie sign up in the header area on the following site: http://www.clearcreativecoaching.com/ This site is using the Mantra Wordpress theme. When you minimize your browser window you will see that the opt-in form moves out of place. Is there a code I can put in to make the opt-in form responsive so that it stays in its proper place on any sized screen/window. Before I got this project, a plugin was installed to create a mobile site for this website. I don't believe it adds "responsive" code to the site because it specifically creates a mobile app looking site on mobile devices. The plugin is called Duda Mobile and the header area is totally different on mobile sites using this plugin, the opt-in doesn't even show. So I don't think that this has anything to do with my problem. I need specific code that will speak to the header opt-in as it is seen on regular computers/laptops and I want it to stay in its proper place no matter how big or small the screen or browser window is. Is this possible? I've searched for answers to this in two different Mantra and Wordpress forums with no help yet. Any advice you can give will be greatly appreciated.

@TITLE:Finding all cycles in a directed graph using recursive backtracking
@CONTENT:I am working on finding cycles in directed graph using recursive backtracking. There is a suggested pseudocode for this here, which is here: dfs(adj,node,visited):  
  if (visited[node]):  
    if (node == start):  
      "found a path"  
    return;  
  visited[node]=YES;  
  for child in adj[node]:  
    dfs(adj,child,visited)
  visited[node]=NO;
 Call the above function with the start node: visited = {}
dfs(adj,start,visited)
 While this is not the most efficient algorithm when compared to Tarjans algorithm, this is simple enough me for me to understand. Currently, this code does not have a count of number cycles detected. I implemented this in Java: //this is the main method that calls the helper DFS which runs on each node
public int allCyclesDirectedmain(){
    //this initializes all vertices
    clearAll();
    int[] count = new int[1];
    for (Vertex v: vertexMap.values()){
        //System.out.println(v.name);
        //clearAll();
        dfs(v,v,count);
    }
    return count[0];
}

//start and v are same when the method first fires.
public void dfs(Vertex start, Vertex v,int[] count){
   if (v.isVisited){
       if (start==v){
           //found a path
           count[0]++;
       }
       return ;
   }
   v.setVisited(true);
   for (Edge e : v.adj){
       Vertex next = e.target;
       dfs(start,next,count);
   }
   v.setVisited(false);
}
 For the graph with following edges: (1 2),(2 3),(3 1),(2 5),(5 6),(6 2)-- I get 6 cycles as output. (1 2),(2 3),(3 4),(4,1),(2 5),(5 6),(6 2) -- I get 7 cycles as output. I can see that my current code does cycle detection for each vertex that are already part of a previously detected cycle (e.g.: a cycle with three nodes gives me three cycles for each individual nodes while this must be one). I need some tips here as to what is going wrong and some fix.
@CODE:dfs(adj,node,visited):  
  if (visited[node]):  
    if (node == start):

@TITLE:Change icon on state change using Qt stylesheet
@CONTENT:I'm trying to support theming for my application, and I'm coming across a problem where I have to change icons based on the state of the QPushButton (default, hover, pressed, etc.). Here is what I use to set the icon for a QPushButton: QPushButton#playButton {
    qproperty-icon: url(":/light/icons/play_light.png");
}
 Because the hover state uses a background that requires an icon from my dark theme, I tried to change it to the other using this: QPushButton#playButton:hover {
    qproperty-icon: url(":/dark/icons/play_dark.png");
}
 When I do this, the play_light.png displays as it should, but it doesn't change to play_dark.png on state change. In my Python code, the play button changes to a stop button on playback, so in my style, I set it to that icon using a custom property: QPushButton#playButton[isPlaying="true"] {
    qproperty-icon: url(":/light/icons/stop_light.png");
}
 This wouldn't change for me either. So, I found some code online to reset the style for the button, which looks like this: self.ui.playButton.setProperty('isPlaying', not isEnable)
self.ui.playButton.setStyle(qApp.style())
 I don't want to use this workaround for every single button for every single state change. Have you guys ran into this problem before? Thanks for your time looking at this.

@TITLE:lexical scope in R
@CONTENT:I recently learned that R has both lexical and dynamical scoping available, but that it uses lexical scope by default. The next case really confused me: > x <- 1
> f <- function(y) { x + y }
> f(5)  # we expect 6    
[1] 6
> x <- 10
> f(5)  # shouldn't we again expect 6?
[1] 15
 Shouldn't f be evaluated using the environment where (and at the time!) it was defined and not where it was called ? How is this lexical scope? Thanks!
@CODE:> x <- 1
> f <- function(y) { x + y }
> f(5)  # we expect 6    
[1] 6
> x <- 10
> f(5)  # shouldn't we again expect 6?
[1] 15 f

@CONTENT:I just started using chef and don't know much about ruby. I have problems understanding the language-syntax used in recipes. Say, I create a directory in a cookbook in recipes/default.rb like: directory "/home/test/mydir" do

  action :create
  recursive true
end
 I assume this is part of a valid ruby script. What do lines like owner "test" mean? Is this a function call, a variable assignment or something else entirely?

@TITLE:UICollectionView images not showing
@CONTENT:I have an issue with the images not showing, even though they are loading. I have tried this several different ways and the same result... no images. I do get white rectangles that are the size and color specified in the Storyboard. I get the correct number of rectangles in the popover. The log shows the names and ids correctly. If I call the array directly, I get the same result... white rectangles. My target is iOS7. Running Xcode 5.0.2. Images are coming from a SQL database. This is a live app, which I am updating to full iOS7 and where I am swapping out a custom grid layout for UICollectionView. Using a CollectionViewController, embedded into a NavigationController, which is accessed via a UIButton. As you can see, there is no custom cell. The images are to show in a popover and are then selectable by the user to change the background of the underlying view. - (UICollectionViewCell *)collectionView:(UICollectionView *)collectionView cellForItemAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath
{
    UICollectionViewCell *cell = [collectionView dequeueReusableCellWithReuseIdentifier:@"BckgndCell" forIndexPath:indexPath];

    NSDictionary * tempDict = [_arrayOfBckgnds objectAtIndex:indexPath.row];
    NSNumber *buttonTagNumber = (NSNumber *)[tempDict objectForKey:@"id"];
    int buttonTag = [buttonTagNumber intValue];
    NSString *tempImage = [tempDict objectForKey:@"fileName"];

    NSLog(@"Filename: %@", tempImage);
    NSLog(@"ButtonTagNumber: %@", buttonTagNumber);
    UIImageView *image = [[UIImageView alloc]init];
    image.image = [UIImage imageNamed:tempImage];
    NSLog(@"Image.image: %@", image.image);

    // needed for selecting the background in didSelectItemAtIndexPath
    _bgtag = buttonTag;

    return cell;
}
 The fix which includes actually naming the BackgroundCell (duh) in the cellForItemAtIndexPath method and creating a small method in the BackgroundCell controller to set the image. - (UICollectionViewCell *)collectionView:(UICollectionView *)collectionView cellForItemAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath
{
    BackgroundCell *cell = (BackgroundCell *)[collectionView dequeueReusableCellWithReuseIdentifier:@"BckgndCell" forIndexPath:indexPath];

    NSDictionary * tempDict = [_arrayOfBckgnds objectAtIndex:indexPath.row];

    [cell setImage:[UIImage imageNamed:tempImage]];

@CONTENT:I have to create post to facebook with image from my application. Image stored in application.

Create post and send to Facebook with: Request(session, "me/feed", postParams, HttpMethod.POST, callback). In postParams I also put postParams.putString("object_attachment", photoId) where photoId = "637590962949508" Response is: {

I want to achieve something similar to this: I wanted to do so using RDFList, adding the necessary properties in to the list and then call method createUnionClass (or createIntersectionClass) and combine it together.

rdfList.addProperty(ExampleResource1);
rdfList.addProperty(ExampleResource2); 
UnionClass uc = ontModel.createUnionClass(null, rdfList);
ExampleClass.addSuperClass(uc);
 But the result was not the subClassOf the union of both stated before, but only subClassOf nil. Any help would be appreciated.

rdfList.addProperty(ExampleResource1);
rdfList.addProperty(ExampleResource2);

 I've looked around and found this slightly related question, but it has rows that look like this: <row>
  <field name="personal_number">539</field>
  <field name="firstname">Name</field>
  <field name="lastname">Surname</field>

  <field name="employee_category">1,2,4,5,22,37,38,39,41,43,44</field>
</row>
 Where each row has an XML element for each field - instead of a single element for each row with the content specified as attributes, as I have. How can I import this into MySQL? I can make do with just about any technique, but I'd prefer to stay away from anything requiring Windows.

@TITLE:Translate JQuery Mobile widgets
@CONTENT:Using i18next, how can I translate JQuery Mobile widgets? Specifically, I'd like to know how to do that without resorting to using data-i18n-target to modify generated inner elements, because that is brittle since future widget versions may change the generated code. Is there a specific page lifecycle event I can subscribe to in order to be able to have i18next modify the DOM before the widget transformation happens? In this example (see jsfiddle), some markup is correctly translated, but homeBtn and submitBtn are not: HTML: <div id="home_page" data-role="page">
    <div data-role="header">
        <a id="homeBtn" href="/" data-icon="home" data-i18n>app.home</a>

@LINK:/questions/20543055/overlay-winforms-controls-on-directx-content
@TITLE:Overlay WinForms controls on DirectX content
@CONTENT:I'm trying to create a graphics library with graphics control. The control enables adding overlay controls. The graphics on the control uses DirectX and is part of the library, while the overlay controls are provided by end users of the library which are not graphics experts. Thus stability and convenient API are the most important issues. For technical reasons I need to show the graphics by DirectX directly on the control and cannot host the DirectX scene using another framework as WPF (For more information see my previous question: Stereoscopic 3D on WPF). I think the most problematic issues are: Transparency (and semi-transparency...) within the area of the control itself. Animations on the overlay control: That's why control rasterization (e.g. by WPF) is not an option. My tries until now: Following the lot of posts discussed similar issues I decided to use WS_EX_TRANSPARENT. I was surprised to see that although the Airspace issue, I can see the DirectX content under the transparent regions of the overlay control. However the overlay control was not shown except for when I resized the window - then it blinks and disappears again. Here is the code of the overlay control: class GDIGraphicsControl : UserControl
{
  private const int WS_EX_TRANSPARENT = 0x20;

  protected override CreateParams CreateParams
  {
    get
    {
      CreateParams p = base.CreateParams;
      p.ExStyle |= WS_EX_TRANSPARENT;
      return p;
    }
  }

  public GDIGraphicsControl()
  {
    this.Dock = DockStyle.Fill;
  }

  protected override void OnPaintBackground(PaintEventArgs e)
  {
    // Do nothing
  }

  protected override void OnPaint(PaintEventArgs e)
  {
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
    {
      int alpha = 25 * i;
      int yPos = 10 * i;
      e.Graphics.FillRectangle(
        new SolidBrush(Color.FromArgb(alpha, Color.Green)),
        5, 5 + yPos, 100, 10);
    }
    e.Graphics.FillEllipse(new SolidBrush(Color.Red), 110, 5, 100, 100);
  }
}
 To analyze the blinking problem I tried to make things simpler. First for debugging purpose I tried to use GDI rendering instead of DirectX. I implemented it such that it will be very similar to the DirectX rendering - especially the Form.SetStyle and the Invalidate() call in every OnPaint() which I thought to be the cause to the problem. The problem do exist also in GDI-only rendering. Here is the GDI-rendering parent control code: public partial class RenderingForm : Form
{
  public RenderingForm()
  {
    InitializeComponent();

    ControlStyles styles =
      ControlStyles.AllPaintingInWmPaint |
      ControlStyles.OptimizedDoubleBuffer |
      ControlStyles.ResizeRedraw |
      ControlStyles.UserPaint |
      ControlStyles.Opaque;
    this.SetStyle(styles, true);

    Button button = new Button()
    {
      Text = "Just a button",
      Left = 5,
      Top = 210,
      Width = 200
    };

    this.Controls.Add(button);
    this.Controls.Add(new GDIGraphicsControl());
  }

  protected override void OnPaintBackground(PaintEventArgs e)
  {
    // Do nothing
  }

  protected override void OnPaint(PaintEventArgs e)
  {
    e.Graphics.Clear(Color.Blue);

    this.Invalidate();

    base.OnPaint(e);
  }
}
 I tried to add a simple overlay Button to check if the problem exist when no transparency is used (see in the above code). The button doesn't blink, but instead of the button I see garbage on the screen until resizing the control first time - then the button appears correctly. I tried to invalidate the child overlay controls but it has no effect. I tried to invalidate it both in parent's OnPaint and in the child OnPaint to create the message-pump rendering effect and it has no effect. Setting the control's style as in parent rendering control didn't resolve the problem and caused the background to blink in black. I also performed some tries using WPF but the question is long enough for now without hard Airspace issue... Now for the questions: Can someone explain how does GDI overlay over DirectX graphics work? Especially I don't understand it because I know that WinForms transparency is working by that the children controls render on the parent's Device Context - and DirectX has a hardware rendering context. Does it mean that the DirectX texture is copied back to software? Why does overriding the CreateParams causes the Control to blink and how to prevent it? What are performance cost do those transparency methods (overriding CreateParams, BackColorTransparency = True, Control.SetStyle+override OnPainBackground)? It is of high importance that the underlying graphics will be rendered efficiently but I don't care about the overlay performance (except for lightweight animation).
@CODE:class GDIGraphicsControl : UserControl
{
  private const int WS_EX_TRANSPARENT = 0x20;

  protected override CreateParams CreateParams
  {
    get
    {
      CreateParams p = base.CreateParams;
      p.ExStyle |= WS_EX_TRANSPARENT;
      return p;
    }
  }

  public GDIGraphicsControl()
  {
    this.Dock = DockStyle.Fill;
  }

  protected override void OnPaintBackground(PaintEventArgs e)
  {
    // Do nothing
  }

  protected override void OnPaint(PaintEventArgs e)
  {
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
    {
      int alpha = 25 * i;
      int yPos = 10 * i;
      e.Graphics.FillRectangle(
        new SolidBrush(Color.FromArgb(alpha, Color.Green)),
        5, 5 + yPos, 100, 10);
    }
    e.Graphics.FillEllipse(new SolidBrush(Color.Red), 110, 5, 100, 100);

Please see server.log for more details. I've got only one JRE on my system (1.6.0_43), so it's not possible that I wrongly compiled my classes with another JDK version. I checked that my settings were right under Window > Preferences > Java > Compiler > Compiler compliance level > 1.6. My project classes are copy-pasted from another project, but I tried to write them from scratch and the result is the same. What am I missing here?

However, when I refresh the page onDisconnect() on server side doesn't fire until 30 seconds later. Is there any settings in the Hub I can do to make it response upon the disconnect event immediately? My Observation: Note that delay issue only happens with I refresh page, not when I am closing the browser. The onDisconnect() fires instantly when closing the browser. Strange thing @_@ Version Limitation: I am using SignalR 1.1.3 (The latest version before 2.x.x happened) because we don't have vs2013 in our company and I couldn't get 2.x.x to work with vs2013 express on my pc anyway.

@TITLE:In what order does execution on WHERE and ON clauses work?
@CONTENT:I was reading this page about APPLY: http://sqlblog.com/blogs/alexander_kuznetsov/archive/2009/07/07/using-cross-apply-to-optimize-joins-on-between-conditions.aspx And I read this article about Logical Query Processing: http://blog.sqlauthority.com/2009/04/06/sql-server-logical-query-processing-phases-order-of-statement-execution/ So I can understand how this query takes a long time. SELECT s.StartedAt, s.EndedAt, c.AirTime 
FROM dbo.Commercials s JOIN dbo.Calls c  
  ON c.AirTime >= s.StartedAt AND c.AirTime < s.EndedAt 
WHERE c.AirTime BETWEEN '20080701' AND '20080701 03:00'
 The join goes through all the rows, then the WHERE clauses filters the results. But why is this query lightning fast? SELECT s.StartedAt, s.EndedAt, c.AirTime 
FROM dbo.Commercials s JOIN dbo.Calls c  
  ON c.AirTime >= s.StartedAt AND c.AirTime < s.EndedAt 
WHERE c.AirTime BETWEEN '20080701' AND '20080701 03:00' 
AND s.StartedAt BETWEEN '20080630 23:45' AND '20080701 03:00'
 I get that the WHERE clauses are filtering the results of both tables. But that filtering happens after the JOIN, not before it. Now if it somehow, actually happens before the JOIN, then I definitely understand why it's so fast. But, if I go by the LOE in second link, this shouldn't be the case. Right?
@CODE:SELECT s.StartedAt, s.EndedAt, c.AirTime 
FROM dbo.Commercials s JOIN dbo.Calls c  
  ON c.AirTime >= s.StartedAt AND c.AirTime < s.EndedAt

@TITLE:Activity or Fragment which is better way to use for performance and reliable? [duplicate]
@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: Android - Activity vs FragmentActivity? [duplicate] 3 answers I'm new to android and i have developing an android app that is starting now. It is kinds of saveable user input information with specific Date/Time. And reviewable previous stored data to user. And also store some setting information. This may be look simple but it will cost a lot of UI components. I recently learned Activity and Fragment and preferred to use one Main Activity class and the rests are will build with Fragments. My understanding is, Fragment is corporate with Activity Life cycle and intend to use as reusable for other Activities. But the thing that i want to know is as i mentioned in question, Is that cost performance for using Activity per UI View ? If using with Fragment for UI View, it may be more good in performance but reliability (such as : manually maintaining data states while rotation with Activity and Fragment each other, but if used Activity it will more less custom maintenance) is more sure for using Fragment ? I want some advice of my question.

@TITLE:Why does java use void? [closed]
@CONTENT:I am well aware that the void keyword is used to indicate in a method declaration that the method will return no value. My question is not about - to use an analogy - how to use the car, but rather about what's underneath the hood. I would like to know why void actually needs to be specified, i.e. does Java reserve an internal variable of some sort to keep track of return types? Will setting a method to void make it so that it doesn't have to do this? Another way to put it is to ask why, exactly, can't Java omit the void keyword and assume that if there is no returned type than the method is void? I think that there is something to do with how Java might "prepare" to handle the return type, and possibly something to do with optimization... please use full detail.

@TITLE:Draw a curved line from an arc edge
@CONTENT:Here's the screenshot of what I am doing. Currently, I'm stuck from drawing a curved borders into this rectangle. My first solution was: draw a quartered circle behind the rectangle, but if I adjust the opacity of the shape, as you can see, the quartered circle gets shown. I know this is pretty basic for you guys but I'm not really good at math. I did try to reuse the computed edges of the arc and add the size of border but I got this as a result. I also think of bezier curves as a replacement but I think it is more efficient to just reuse the computed vertices and add all the missing ones. Also, I don't know how to compute for the curved points of bezier curves and finding the right amount of t would be very computationally expensive so I don't implement it.

@TITLE:converting date string to date format
@CONTENT:I have tried out as many suggestions as I've found on Stackoverflow, but not getting the desired result. Any help would be much appreciated. My date string is "04-Dec-2013 14:14:02.143" and I want to convert this exactly as into DateTime format. This was the last suggestion I tried: String MyString;                            
MyString = "04-Dec-2013 14:14:02.143";

DateTime MyDateTime;

MyDateTime = DateTime.ParseExact(MyString, "dd-MMM-yyyy HH:mm:ss.fff",
                                           null);
 However, I keep getting the undesired result of "04/12/2013 14:14:02" rather want it to be "04-Dec-2013 14:14:02.143". Any suggestions?

@TITLE:Bootstrap ScrollSpy skips section when no more scrollable area
@CONTENT:I am having an issue with Bootstrap ScrollSpy in regards to the scrolling position of a selected element. The issue occurs at the bottom of the page, I have multiple relatively short sections of content through out the page. They are collapsed and expand onClick, (so yes, if I choose to have all open then there seem to be no problem) and when I reach the bottom of page before all have been selected by scrollspy it jumps to the last element on nav. It seems to be a issue with no more scrollable area. (Also adding extra white space padding to kill design is not an option) I have added scrollspy to body, my body has no height values added, offset has no effect other then starting the highlighted element was to early. Here is a JSFiddle of my code: http://jsfiddle.net/Abuu/sAUee/     $( document ).ready(function() {
    $('body').scrollspy({ 'target': '#nav', 'offset': 10 });
});
 I have only found one similar question here on So, but it has not been answered: Bootstrap - Scrollspy scrolling skipping second to last section Thanks in advance.

@TITLE:StAXSource not accepted by validator in JBoss EAP 6.1
@CONTENT:Issue while Validating StAXSource in JBoss Server, What I Tried: I try to do parsing and validation at a time using StAX. As described in this example. I am able to execute the program as standalone application, but when I try it as a web application in JBoss EAP 6.1 server got below exception. Exception: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Source parameter of type      
javax.xml.transform.stax.StAXSource' is not accepted by this validator.
at org.apache.xerces.jaxp.validation.ValidatorImpl.validate(Unknown Source)
 There are multiple frame works modified from StAXSource to StreamSource, TEIID-2046, activiti..etc. I am not sure, Why JBoss is not supporting StAXSource, any clues?

@TITLE:How to handle exceptions when programming with Java? [closed]
@CONTENT:I am studying Java these days, and I have realized that it is important to handle exceptions in my codes. I just what to ask how to handle exceptions with various methods? Is it to examine the method I use to see what exception the method has thrown? In the example below I have to see what exception method m() throws. try {
    m();
} catch(SomeException e) {
    ...;
}
 Is there any train of thought to handle exceptions when programming with Java?
@CODE:try {
    m();
} catch(SomeException e) {
    ...;

@TITLE:PHP - proper check if $_POST['variable'] is posted
@CONTENT:I want to check if $_POST['submit'] is posted. My original code was: if ($_POST['submit']) { }
 But I have a PHP notice with this code - "Undefined index: submit in..." So to remove the notice I have to write this: if (isset($_POST['submit'])) { }
 But this is pointless because $_POST array is global and it return always true. Also if I want to check if $_POST['submit'] is not 0 without PHP notice I have to write this: if (isset($_POST['submit']) && $_POST['submit'] != 0) { }
 In this particular case I prefer: if ($_POST['submit']) {}
 But here I get the PHP notice. So which way is the most proper/accepted? Thank you
@CODE:if ($_POST['submit']) { } if (isset($_POST['submit'])) { } if (isset($_POST['submit']) && $_POST['submit'] != 0) { } if ($_POST['submit']) {} $_POST isset($_POST['submit'] if (isset($_POST['submit']) && $_POST['submit'] != 0) { } if ($_POST['submit']) {} $_POST

@TITLE:How do i replace/overwrite the text in text file for updating information ? Not append text
@CONTENT:This is the code now: using (StreamWriter sw = File.CreateText(file))
                {
                    sw.WriteLine("Image Width: " + imageWidth.ToString());
                    sw.WriteLine("Image Height: " + imageHeight.ToString());
                    sw.WriteLine("Original Factor: " + originalFactor.ToString());
                    sw.WriteLine("Current Factor: " + currentFactor.ToString() + Environment.NewLine);
                    for (int i = 0; i < points.Count; i++)
                    {
                        sw.WriteLine("Coordinate " + i + ": " + points[i].ToString());
                    }
                }
            }
            using (StreamWriter sw = File.AppendText(file))
            {

            }
 If i will use the AppendText it will add new lines. What i want is that if i changed the imageWidth for example of the originalFactor so it will update the value of it in the same line it was written on the first place. And if the List of points for example had 12 indexs(points) and now i added more points and the List have 20 points now so append the points to those exist do not overwrite them but add the new ones. All the first 4 lines i want to change/update the values of it and only the List of points to append. In form1 i have a button click event that is calling a Save method in the new class there im writing the values to the text file. EDIT** For the points List matter i did use AppendText: using (StreamWriter sw = File.AppendText(file))
            {
                for (int i = 0; i < points.Count; i++)
                {
                    sw.WriteLine("Coordinate " + i + ": " + points[i].ToString());
                }
            }
 But i want to check each time if the points.Count is updated i mean when i click the button to Save again i dont want it to Append the same List of points each time only if the Count of the List was changed bigger then what it was last time. How can i do it ?
@CODE:using (StreamWriter sw = File.CreateText(file))
                {
                    sw.WriteLine("Image Width: " + imageWidth.ToString());
                    sw.WriteLine("Image Height: " + imageHeight.ToString());
                    sw.WriteLine("Original Factor: " + originalFactor.ToString());
                    sw.WriteLine("Current Factor: " + currentFactor.ToString() + Environment.NewLine);
                    for (int i = 0; i < points.Count; i++)
                    {
                        sw.WriteLine("Coordinate " + i + ": " + points[i].ToString());

@TITLE:<c:choose><c:when> in JSF page does not work, seems to always evaluate false
@CONTENT:In my JSF page I use <c:choose><c:when> tag to conditionally display content. However, it does not work as it seems to always evaluate false. E.g. <h:outputText value="#{pollInfo.active} -" />
<c:choose>
    <c:when test="#{pollInfo.active}">
        <h:outputText value="Active" />
    </c:when>
    <c:otherwise>
        <h:outputText value="Deactive" />
    </c:otherwise>
</c:choose>
 There are for sure a few items with active=true, which is confirmed by <h:outputText>, but it just prints Deactive for all items. You can see the actual output in the following picture: How is this caused and how can I solve it?
@CODE:<c:choose><c:when> false <h:outputText value="#{pollInfo.active} -" />
<c:choose>
    <c:when test="#{pollInfo.active}">

@TITLE:Infinite Scroll in both directions
@CONTENT:I've been working on a small website and I want it to be scrollable and looped both upwards and downwards. I made a jsfiddle to show my problem. Currently I'm working with this method: $(document).ready(function(){
        $(window).scroll(function() {
            if ( $(window).scrollTop() >= ($('body').height() - $(window).height()) ) {
                $(window).scrollTop(1);

            }    
        });
    });
 http://jsfiddle.net/2LDFA/ My problem is, that there is no transition, this method only works if the content at the top and bottom is exactly the same. Any Ideas how I can add the same div to top and bottom every time the user reaches the end?
