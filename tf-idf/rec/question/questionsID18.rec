@TITLE:Xcode ¡V Removing unused frameworks?
@CONTENT:Over time when you develop an application you add new libraries to it, new frameworks needed for the libraries to work. Then you remove libraries and if you are like me you have forgotten to remove the frameworks that you initially added. Is there a way to find out what frameworks are needed for my code to function?

@TITLE:Android NFC start service
@CONTENT:I'm curious if Android NFC service allows the developer to start a Service (or IntentService for that matter) when NFC tag is scanned? From Android Developers: When a device scans a tag that has NDEF data on it, but could not be mapped to a MIME or URI, the tag dispatch system tries to start an activity with the ACTION_TECH_DISCOVERED intent. It appears that only a new Activity can be launched, not Service, although it could receive the same Intent filter.

@TITLE:OnMouseMove does not fire on canvas in WPF
@CONTENT:I have done my custom chart control and I want to draw a simple cross following the cursor. The chart is implemented as a PolyLine over a Canvas and I'm drawing two lines changing their coordinates at the OnMouseMove event of the Canvas. The surprise was to found that the event get called only each 10 seconds or so event when the MainGUI thread is idle (the UI is completely responsive and if I pause the application the main thread is at the App mainForm.ShowDialog()). Any idea on how to find why is this happening? I get the same performance using the OnMouseMove or the PreviewOnMouseMove. EDIT: This is how I paint the cross (anyway if I put a breakpoint at the OnMouseMove it only stops from time to time).

@TITLE:LOG4J: Modify logged message using custom appender
@CONTENT:For security reasons, I need to look at every logged message in my app and possibly modify it before it goes to the log file. I figured I could write a custom appender (extending DailyRollingFileAppender) and override subAppend(LoggingEvent event). Problem is, there's no setter for the message text in LoggingEvent, and the message is a private attribute. I could create a new LoggingEvent with my modified message, but the API doesn't make it easy to copy over the rest of the original LoggingEvent. It all seems designed to discourage meddling with the message in a custom appender. The only other option I can see is to modify hundreds of logging statements to call a new global method that can modify the text first and then make the Log4J call. I'd rather not! Has anyone else had the need to modify the logged message in a custom appender?

@TITLE:Understanding MySQL key_len in Explain Statement
@CONTENT:According to MySQL website, the key_len column indicates the length of the key that MySQL decided to use. The length is NULL if the key column says NULL. Note that the value of key_len enables you to determine how many parts of a multiple-part key MySQL actually uses. Using an example from my previous question, I have an EXPLAIN SELECT statement that shows MySQL using an Index with key_len: 6. Below shows the composition of the index and columns used. `Type` char(1) NOT NULL,
`tn` char(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'l',
`act` tinyint(1) unsigned NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
`flA` mediumint(6) unsigned NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
KEY `Index` (`Type`, `tn`, `act`, `flA`)
 So how does the value of key_len allows me to determine that my query uses the first three parts of a multiple-part key?
@CODE:key_len NULL NULL Index key_len: 6 `Type` char(1) NOT NULL,
`tn` char(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'l',
`act` tinyint(1) unsigned NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',

@TITLE:Ninject working with WCF Web API Preview 5
@CONTENT:Can anybody point me in the right direction to get Ninject working with WCF Web API Preview 5? I have it successfully up and running in my ASP.NET MVC 3 project and also in another internal WCF Service using the Ninject.Extensions.Wcf library. However I cannot get it to work when creating a new MVC 3 project and getting the WebApi.All library from NuGet. I have looked at this stackoverflow post Setting up Ninject with the new WCF Web API but cannot get it working which I believe could be to do with some of the changes in the latest release. I am also unsure which Ninject Libraries to reference beyond the main one. Do I use the Ninject.MVC3 , Ninject.Extensions.Wcf. Any help on this would be much appreciated. **UPDATE Code I am using which is from the answer in the question mentioned above. I have this in its own class file.    public class NinjectResourceFactory : IResourceFactory
    {
        private readonly IKernel _kernel;

        public NinjectResourceFactory(IKernel kernel)
        {
            _kernel = kernel;
        }

        public object GetInstance(Type serviceType, InstanceContext instanceContext, HttpRequestMessage request)
        {
            return _kernel.Get(serviceType);

        public void ReleaseInstance(InstanceContext instanceContext, object service)
        {
            // no op
        }
    }
 This I have in my global.asax: var configuration = HttpConfiguration.Create().SetResourceFactory(new NinjectResourceFactory());
RouteTable.Routes.MapServiceRoute<myResource>("resource", configuration);
 The issue I am having is that the IResourceFactory interface is not recognised and that the HttpConfiguration.Create() no longer exists so I need to set the SetResourceFactory some other way which I have tried to do using the HttpConfiguration().CreateInstance method but no joy.
@CODE:public class NinjectResourceFactory : IResourceFactory

Currently, there are other implementation that I am seeing, the Primefaces, RichFaces and Icefaces. But I cant find a good article that discusses which among the three are the best. I have used Spring MVC before but I use JqueryUI for those widget. Now that I am into component based framework, I would like to use the best JSF Implementation.

@LINK:/questions/7301744/unwanted-scrolling-when-animating-zoomscale-in-uiscrollview
@TITLE:Unwanted scrolling when animating zoomScale in UIScrollView
@CONTENT:Executive Summary: At times UIScrollView makes an unwanted change to the value of contentOffset, thus causing the app to display the wrong location in the document being viewed. The unwanted change happens in conjunction to an animated change to the scroll view's zoomScale. The Details: I'm having trouble when zooming out with CATiledLayer in a UIScrollView. The CATiledLayer holds a pdf, and when contentOffset is within a certain range, when I zoom out, the contentOffset is changed (that's the bug) before the zooming occurs. The contentOffset seems to be changed in Apple's code. To illustrate the problem, I modified Apple's sample app, ZoomingPDFViewer. The code is on github: https://github.com/DirkMaas/ZoomingPDFViewer-bug A tap will cause zoomScale to be changed to 0.5, using animateWithDuration, thus zooming out. If the UIScrollView's contentOffset.y is less than about 2700 or greater than 5900, the zoomScale animation works fine. If the tap happens when contentOffset.y is between those two values, the contentOffset.y will jump (not animated) to about 2700, and then the zoomScale animation will occur, but scrolling will occur at the same time, so that when the animation is done, the contentOffset.y is where it should be. But where does the jump come from? For example, say the contentOffset.y is 2000 when the screen is tapped: the zoomScale animation works just fine; contentOffset.y is not changed. But if the contentOffset.y is 4000 when the screen is tapped: the contentOffset.y will jump, without animation, to about 2700, and then zooming and scrolling will begin from that point and occur at the same time. When the animation is done, it looks as if we zoomed straight back from 4000, so we end up in the right place, but the behavior is wrong. A note on the UI: the text can be scrolled vertically in the normal way the text can be zoomed in and out by pinching in the normal way a single tap will cause the zoomScale to be set to 0.5; the change is animated I've noticed that if zoomScale is greater than 0.5, the jump is not so big. Also, if I use setZoomScale:animated: instead of animateWithDuration, the bug disappears, but I can't use it because I need to chain animations. Here is a summary of what I did (the code in github includes these changes): Downloaded ZoomingPDFViewer from http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#samplecode/ZoomingPDFViewer/Introduction/Intro.html and opened it in XCode Changed Build Settings | Architectures | Base SDK to Latest iOS (iOS 4.3) changed Build Settings | GCC 4.2 - Language | Compile Sources As to Objective-C++ removed TestPage.pdf from the project added "whoiam 5 24 cropped 3-2.pdf" to the project in its place added PDFScrollView *scrollView; to ZoomingPDFViewerViewController class changed loadView in ZoomingPDFViewerViewController to initialize scrollView instead of sv added viewDidLoad, handleTapFrom:recognizer and zoomOut to ZoomingPDFViewerViewController in PDFScrollview.m commented out scrollViewDidEndZooming:withView:atScale and scrollViewWillBeginZooming:withView: because they do stuff in the image background that distracts from the issue at hand Thanks so much for bearing with me, and any and all help!

@CONTENT:For some reason, Python seems to be having issues with BOM when reading unicode strings from a UTF-8 file. Consider the following: with open('test.py') as f:
   for line in f:
      print unicode(line, 'utf-8')
 Seems straightforward, doesn't it? That's what I thought until I ran it from command line and got: UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character u'\ufeff' in position 0: character maps to <undefined> A brief visitation to Google revealed that BOM has to be cleared manually: import codecs
with open('test.py') as f:
   for line in f:
      print unicode(line.replace(codecs.BOM_UTF8, ''), 'utf-8')
 This one runs fine. However I'm struggling to see any merit in this. Is there a rationale behind above-described behavior? In contrast, UTF-16 works seamlessly.
@CODE:with open('test.py') as f:
   for line in f:
      print unicode(line, 'utf-8') <undefined> import codecs

@TITLE:What would cause Chrome autofill to stop working?
@CONTENT:I've got a new site we're working that uses HTML5. Everything validates except for the LESS stylesheets and the Facebook tags. However, Chrome will not autofill properly. If I type 'chr' in the first name field, I get the standard Autofill drop down beneath it, but highlighting, clicking, or otherwise selecting the autofill option does not complete the form as it should. The autofill dropdown merely goes away. I'm guessing there's something in my HTML that is confusing the autofill code, but I can't seem to find any information on the web about Chrome's autofill implementation and things to look for when it doesn't work. Edit: I know Autofill is working properly because it works on other sites, even other sites we've developed. It's got to be something specific to the HTML on this site.

 The first thing I tried was to overload NilClass's missing_method to simply return a nil. This is the behaviour I want except I don't want to be this intrusive. I'd love it if I could do something like this SafeNils.a.b.c("d").e
 So it's like a clean way to locally overload the NilClass's behaviour. I'd love to hear some ideas or great resources for digging in on this. I'm also quite open to other approaches as long as it's fairly clean. Thank you very much.

@TITLE:Memory Model Guarantees in Double-checked Locking
@CONTENT:I recently came across the following post on the Resharper website. It was a discussion of double-checked locking, and had the following code: public class Foo
{
    private static volatile Foo instance;
    private static readonly object padlock = new object();

    public static Foo GetValue()
    {
        if (instance == null)
        {
            lock (padlock)
            {
                if (instance == null)
                {
                    instance = new Foo();
                    instance.Init();
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
     }

     private void Init()
     {
        ...
     }
}
 The post then makes the claim that If we assume that Init() is a method used to intialize the state of Foo, then the above code may not function as expected due to the memory model not guaranteeing the order of reads and writes. As a result, the call to Init() may actually occur before the variable instance is in a consistent state. Here are my questions: It was my understanding that .NET memory model (at least since 2.0) has not required that instance be declared as volatile, since lock would provide a full memory fence. Is that not the case, or was I misinformed? Isn't read/write reordering only observable with respect to multiple threads? It was my understanding that on a single thread, the side effects would be in a consistent order, and that the lock in place would prevent any other thread from observing something to be amiss. Am I off-base here as well?
@CODE:public class Foo
{
    private static volatile Foo instance;
    private static readonly object padlock = new object();

    public static Foo GetValue()
    {
        if (instance == null)

        }

 throws the following exception: Exception in thread "main" java.io.NotSerializableException: TestInnerClass
 I guess the inner class has a TestInnerClass.this field that allows it private access to TestInnerClass's fields and methods. Declaring the inner class static solves it, but what if InnerClass needs this access? Is there a way to serialize a non-static inner class without the enclosing class, e.g. by making the reference to the outer class transient? edit: for example, access to the outer class could be needed only before serialization. OK, the compiler cannot know that, but I thought that's why the transient keyword exists.

 This works fine in all browsers except (you guessed it) IE.

I tried different versions of jQuery (I initially started with 1.6.1) and have also read about problems like this on this site but could not find any answer yet. Also it does not seem to be a cache related problem as busting it (or appending a random querystring to the image source) did not make a difference.

@LINK:/questions/7125179/java-inner-class-extends-outer-class
@TITLE:Java Inner Class extends Outer Class
@CONTENT:There are some cases in Java where an inner class extends an outer class. For example, java.awt.geom.Arc2D.Float is an inner class of java.awt.geom.Arc2D, and also extends Arc2D. (c.f. http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/awt/geom/Arc2D.Float.html) Also, sun.org.mozilla.javascript.internal.FunctionNode.Jump extends sun.org.mozilla.javascript.internal.Node, which is a superclass of FunctionNode. (sorry... cannot find a link to the javadoc) To me, this seems odd. Could you then create these? new Arc2D.Float.Float() //n.b. I couldn't get this to compile in Intellij IDEA;

new FunctionNode.Jump.Jump.Jump(1); // I could get this to compile
 What purpose does it serve to have a subclass nested as an inner class of the superclass? I wondered whether it was to access something in the superclass, but if you wanted to access any variables/methods in the parent, you could use super.variable;
 or super.method();
 Edit 1: jjnguy has suggested it's to keep the logic in the same place. In which case, why wouldn't you write a file com.mypackage.AbstractTest: abstract class AbstractTest {
  abstract String getString();
}

class ExtensionTest extends AbstractTest {
  @Override
  String getString() {
    return "hello world";
  }
}
 ... rather than: abstract class AbstractTest {
  abstract String getString();

  class ExtensionTest extends AbstractTest {
    @Override
    String getString() {
      return "hello world";
    }
  }
}
 Edit 2: It has rightly been pointed out that the suggestion in my previous edit was flawed, as couldn't construct ExtensionTest outside of the package. However, I've had a further think about this over the weekend, so what about the following: abstract class Test {
  public class ExtensionTest extends AbstractTest {
    @Override
    String getString() {
      return "hello world";
    }
  }

  private abstract class AbstractTest {
    abstract String getString();
  }
} 
 In essence, the best answer I've seen so far is that having an inner class extend its outer class allows the logic to be grouped together. However, I think that this can be done without the extension. In my mind, it seems like bad design to have a class that can have an infinite number of the same subclasses nested within it. (Context: this came up whilst trying to produce a dictionary for a code completion utility, and threw a StackOverflowException. I found a workaround, but I just cannot understand why it had been designed that way.)
@CODE:new Arc2D.Float.Float() //n.b. I couldn't get this to compile in Intellij IDEA;

new FunctionNode.Jump.Jump.Jump(1); // I could get this to compile super.variable; super.method(); abstract class AbstractTest {

@TITLE:span background-color & padding problems
@CONTENT:I have a design I want to implement that involves title text appearing with its own background color, padded by 10px, over an image, par example: http://i.stack.imgur.com/E7EpS.png The first example in this picture works well, and is simple: .greenbox {width:520px; height:261px; position:relative;}
.greenbox span { padding:0 10px; background:#000; position:absolute; left:0; bottom:40px; }
 Trouble arises when the text overflows onto another line, then the span elements padding does not effect the text on the line breaks, it renders like so: http://i.stack.imgur.com/pY18f.png Anyone know of an alternative, or how they would set this design out so that the background color & padding was consistent? Thanks in advance Edit: I had simplified the code to make it concise, but had missed a vital part. Actually it's like this: .greenbox {width:520px; height:261px; position:relative;}
.greenbox a {position:absolute; left:0; bottom:40px; }
.greenbox span { padding:0 10px; background:#000; }
 With the html as: <div class="greenbox">

    <a href="link"><span>The Title Goes Here</span></a>

</div>
 Thus the span remains inline, wrapped in a absolute position anchor.
@CODE:.greenbox {width:520px; height:261px; position:relative;}
.greenbox span { padding:0 10px; background:#000; position:absolute; left:0; bottom:40px; } .greenbox {width:520px; height:261px; position:relative;}
.greenbox a {position:absolute; left:0; bottom:40px; }
.greenbox span { padding:0 10px; background:#000; } <div class="greenbox">

@CONTENT:such as the code: view.opaque = YES;

 any one who can explain something about this? EDIT: as the document shows: Declare Views as Opaque Whenever Possible UIKit uses the opaque property of each view to determine whether the view can optimize compositing operations. Setting the value of this property to YES for a custom view tells UIKit that it does not need to render any content behind your view. Less rendering can lead to increased performance for your drawing code and is generally encouraged. Of course, if you set the opaque property to YES, your view must fills its bounds rectangle completely with fully opaque content. opaque property is used for determining whether the view can optimize compositing operations. so the question is: if i set view.opaque = YES and view.backgroundColor = [UIColor clearColor]¡Athe former increased performance¡Ahow about the latter?

@TITLE:Is there any Visual Studio extension to ¡§favorite¡¨ folders and files?
@CONTENT:I'm working on a middle-sized project that contains several class libraries, database model and an ASP .NET MVC website project. However, even though there are less than 15 projects in the solution, I often find myself collapsing and expanding endless folders to find a certain class or view. While looking for class is mostly solved by Resharper type navigation feature, I often want to switch to a certain view in MVC project. I don't remember the file name and it wouldn't solve the problem either because there are many views with same file name (e.g. Message\ViewSingle.cshtml, Product\ViewSingle.cshtml). What I'd rather want is an ability to ¡§favorite¡¨ certain files, projects or folders so they are displayed on a separate Solution Explorer-like window for quick access. Is there such an extension available (for free)? Update @samy pointed out that Sergey Vlasov's Favorite Documents extension allows for quick access via the menubar, I usually tend to hide it and would prefer a dockable window solution so I'm still looking. I wrote Sergey to find out if he plans to work on this functionality. Update (Aug 4th) I just received a letter from Sergey in which he points me to Favorite Documents 1.1 got a dedicated window. Therefore I accept samy's answer. Kudos to Sergey!

@TITLE:VS10 debugger error: Test host process exited unexpectedly
@CONTENT:I have been having some problems with the test debugger in VS10. All tests are running without error, but when debugging it aborts when I try to read the object data. Afterwards, this error is displayed in the summary: Test host process exited unexpectedly. I'm unable to see anymore details about the error. How do I access/generate test-log files? Or, even better: Has anyone experienced a similar problem? And found a solution? Additional information: The runtime-test-data is available on objects from same libary assembly, it's just one class I can't get access to in runtime mode. If I use breakpoints at: every line that affects the object: - I can see the runtime-data and the test passes only one place: - the test will abort and no data is visible no breakpoints: - the test runs and passes. The test used to work fine until recently. Just before the problem occurred when I made some solution changes with dividing the projects into solution folders. I didn't make any changes that should affect the code. Moving the projects back to their original folder don't solve the problem, So I wonder - Is this a bug in Visual Studio itself? Here is what I've tried so far: Rebuilding and cleaning the solution. Closing Visual Studio and rebooting my system. Installing VS10 Service Pack 1 Reinstalling Visual Studio 10 Testing on VS10 Ultimate and Premium Removing and regenerating solutions files Removing all break points TraceAndTestImpact/Local.testsettings: Testing Timeout > timeout and setting abort to 30 minutes.

@CONTENT:I notice that the first time a user visits my site the Wicket-generated URLs contain a jsessionid, rather than relying on the cookie for session information. The cookie does get set successfully, and if the user simply reloads the page, the jsessionid is no longer appended to the URLs. You can test this out here: pixlshare.com. Hovering over any of the image links will show a URL with a jsessionid; reload the page, and the jsessionids will be removed. From previous experience with the Wicket SEO page I know how to remove the jsessionid to hide it from bots, but employing this technique for regular users seems like a hack. It will also break the site for those people paranoid enough to have cookies disabled. This is happening after a recent move to Tomcat from Glassfish, though I can't say for certain that that's the cause. Also, I'm using Apache's mod_proxy in front of Tomcat.

And one of the ways to achieve that is by rewriting the most critical parts of the program in C. By using GAE are we losing this possibility forever? Since Google's GO language is now (or it will be as soon as it is compiled more efficiently) the fastest language in GAE, will there be a way to mix Python and GO in the same app?

@TITLE:Property / Method inlining and impact on Reflection
@CONTENT:My answer to one of the question on SO was commented by Valentin Kuzub, who argues that inlining a property by JIT compiler will cause the reflection to stop working. The case is as follows: class Foo
{
    public string Bar { get; set; }

    public void Fuzz<T>(Expression<Func<T>> lambda)
    {
    }
}

Fuzz(x => x.Bar);
 Fuzz function accepts a lambda expression and uses reflection to find the property. It is a common practice in MVC in HtmlHelper extensions. I don't think that the reflection will stop working even if the Bar property gets inlined, as it is a call to Bar that will be inlined and typeof(Foo).GetProperty("Bar") will still return a valid PropertyInfo. Could you confirm this please or my understanding of method inlining is wrong?
@CODE:class Foo
{
    public string Bar { get; set; }

@TITLE:Sending email using Smtp.mail.microsoftonline.com
@CONTENT:The context: We¡¦re a small company that does not have an Exchange Server (or anyone dedicated to it) yet we still need to have/send emails. We¡¦ve decided to use Microsoft Online Services (MOS) The Objective: We have a web server (Windows Server 2003 R2 with IIS 6.0) and have deployed a C# ASP.Net MCV application. The web application needs to send emails each time a user creates an account. According to the documentation we need to use port (587) and make sure Transport Layer Security (TLS) enable. In addition, the FROM address being used must be of type ¡§Authoritative¡¨ which it is when I double check via the Microsoft Online Administration Center The code: The C# code I have should be trivial and is the following: SmtpClient server = new SmtpClient("Smtp.mail.microsoftonline.com");
server.Port = 587;
server.EnableSsl = true;
server.Credentials = new System.Net.NetworkCredential("xxx@domain.com", "123abc");
server.UseDefaultCredentials = false;

MailMessage mail = new MailMessage();
mail.From = new MailAddress("xxx@domain.com");
mail.To.Add("johndoe@domain.com");
mail.Subject = "test subject";
mail.Body = "this is my message body";
mail.IsBodyHtml = true;

try
{
    server.Send(mail);
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    throw ex;
}
 The error: I¡¦ve created a simple winform application with the above code to test the sending of emails¡K I¡¦ve tested the winform application locally on my computer (Windows XP) and on the Server. In both attempt, I keep receiving the following error message: The SMTP server requires a secure connection or the client was not authenticated. The server response was: 5.7.1 Client was not authenticated. After Googling for a while I still haven¡¦t found the reason why¡KIn addition, most of the answers I¡¦ve found are making a reference to the Exchange Management Console which we don¡¦t seem to have (or installed) hence why we are using Microsoft Online Services¡K Questions: 1) As a paying customer of MOS, my initial understanding is that I shouldn¡¦t have to install (or have) an Exchange Management Console on our server¡Kin fact, this should be completely irrelevant in order to achieve my task. 2) I¡¦ve also tried enabling TLS inside our IIS 6.0 but to no avail¡K 3) We are grasping at straws here because what we seem to do looks like something amazingly trivial¡K 4) Should we simply abandon the idea of using MOS¡¦s SMTP server and use another one? Such as Gmail¡¦s ? If so¡Kthen why bother paying a monthly fee for MOS? If any one has any help/advice that can help me shed some light on this, that would be great! Sincerely Vince WOW¡KI believe we¡¦ve found the culprit!!! By commenting this line of code: //server.UseDefaultCredentials = false;
 Everything started to work! I¡¦m now able to send emails inside and outside our domain¡K What puzzles me the most is that, according to the documentation, the default value of this UseDefaultCredentials property is set to false So¡Kwhen I manually set it to false it doesn¡¦t work but when I comment the line (which also set¡¦s it to false because of its default value) it works!

@TITLE:Thread-safety of BlockingQueue's drainTo() method
@CONTENT:Documentation of BlockingQueue says bulk operations are not thread-safe, though it doesn't explicitly mention the method drainTo(). BlockingQueue implementations are thread-safe. All queuing methods achieve their effects atomically using internal locks or other forms of concurrency control. However, the bulk Collection operations addAll, containsAll, retainAll and removeAll are not necessarily performed atomically unless specified otherwise in an implementation. So it is possible, for example, for addAll(c) to fail (throwing an exception) after adding only some of the elements in c. Documentation of drainTo() method specifies that the collection, to which the elements of BlockingQueue are drained to, cannot be modified in thread-safe fashion. But, it doesn't mention anything about drainTo() operation being thread-safe. Removes all available elements from this queue and adds them to the given collection. This operation may be more efficient than repeatedly polling this queue. A failure encountered while attempting to add elements to collection c may result in elements being in neither, either or both collections when the associated exception is thrown. Attempts to drain a queue to itself result in IllegalArgumentException. Further, the behavior of this operation is undefined if the specified collection is modified while the operation is in progress. So, is drainTo() method thread-safe? In other words, if one thread has invoked drainTo() method on a blocking queue and other one is calling add() or put() on the same queue, is the queue's state consistent at the end of both the operations?

@TITLE:Javascript object get code as string
@CONTENT:First off, I am sorry if this is a duplicate, but every time I googled for 'object' and 'code' I got tutorial pages. I want to know if there is any easy way to get the code associated with an object. Something like function A(){
  this.name = 'Kaiser Sauze';
}
a = new A();
console.log(a.displayCode());
//OUTPUT
"function A(){ this.name = 'Kaiser Sauze';}"
 I want to be able to view the code, modify it and reload the function, all from within the browser. I wanted to know if there was some way to do this, or if I have to prime the pump by doing something like this: function A(){
  this.name = 'Kaiser Sauze';
  this.code = "function A(){ this.name = 'Kaiser Sauze';}"
}
 then every time the user loads up the text editor to view this.code I connect the onchange to update this.code. EDIT turns out yankee suggested a simple solution to this function A(x){
  this.x = x ;
}
console.log(A.toString());
//OUTPUT
"function A(x){
  this.x = x ;
}"
 but in my implementation the variable 'x' can be a function (actually a complicated object with variables, functions and sub objects which I mix in via a call to dojo.mixin), so what I really want is to know the code when instantiated, something like so function A(x){
  this.x = x ;
}
var a = new A(function(){/*DO SOMETHING*/);
console.log(a.toString());
//OUTPUT
"var a = new A(function(){/*DO SOMETHING*/);"
 but, as most of you already know, all that gets output is something like "Object". I have almost found a way around this, by putting the initialization in a function like so function A(x){
  this.x = x ;
}
function _A(){
  var a = new A(function(){/*DO SOMETHING*/);
}
console.log(_A.toString());
//OUTPUT
"function _A(){
  var a = new A(function(){/*DO SOMETHING*/);
}"
 but that is confusing, and then I have to go in and start parsing the string which I do not want to do. EDIT: The reason I ask all of this is b/c I want to make code that is both dynamically executable and highly modular. I am dealing with the canvas. I want the user to be able to click on a, for example, rectangle, view its code, and modify and then load/execute it. I have a series of rules but basically I have a shape class and everything that defines that shape (color, transparency, fills, strokes...) has to get passed as a parameter to the object cosntructor, something like: rect = new Shape({color : 'rgba(0,0,0,1)' , 
  x : 0 , 
  y : 0 , 
  w : 100 , 
  h : 100 ,
  draw : function() {ctx.fillStyle = this.color;
    ctx.fillRect(this.x,this.y,this.w,this.h);
  }
});
 This way the code is automatically modular, I don't have to worry about the color being defined at the top of the page, and then the height being defined half way down the page, and so on. Now the only thing I need is to somehow, pass as a parameter, the entire above string representation of the initialization. I could wrap it in a function and call toString on that, like so function wrapper(){
  rect = new Shape({color : 'rgba(0,0,0,1)' , 
        x : 0 , 
        y : 0 , 
        w : 100 , 
        h : 100 ,
        draw : function() {ctx.fillStyle = this.color;
          ctx.fillRect(this.x,this.y,this.w,this.h);
        },
        code : wrapper.toString()
      });
  }
 but then there are two problems. 1) I have to manually remove the function wrapper() and trailing } as well as moving every line to the left by one tab. 2) there is no guarantee that a user will remember to include the wrapper function as it is totally unecessary for purposes of drawing. I am trying to think of a way where the wrapper would seem natural, but I can't think of any. But then again I haven't slept in over 30 hours.
@CODE:function A(){
  this.name = 'Kaiser Sauze';

  this.name = 'Kaiser Sauze';
  this.code = "function A(){ this.name = 'Kaiser Sauze';}"
} this.code this.code function A(x){
  this.x = x ;
}
console.log(A.toString());
//OUTPUT

@CONTENT:I've been doing this the whole time in my JSP code: <c:out value="${myVar}"/>
 Today I just realized for the first time that I seem to be able to use this shorter version just as well: ${myVar}
 It works without <c:out>! Perhaps this is because my page is declared like this: <%@ page language="java" contentType="text/html; 
charset=utf-8" pageEncoding="utf-8" isELIgnored="false" %>
 So, my question is, can I replace <c:out> in my code with this shorter version? Is there any reason to keep using <c:out>? Or are there places where I might still need it?

 This was resolved by including a font folder with helveticab.php and other php files related to other fonts But the Error FPDF error: Could not include font metric file is still there. On searching the net the possible reasons were font directory missing Doesnt have access permissions for the font files. I am not sure what permission need to given to the font folder or files in the folder. Any help in this regard would be of great help.

@CONTENT:I have a web app with a JavaScript file using code like the following: var foo = {a:'b',c:'d',e:'f',};
 On my computer, IE9 (9.0.8112.16421) works correctly; the JavaScript is parsed and executed as on Chrome/FF/Safari. Another user claims to have the same version of IE, yet gets this error in the Developer Tools Console: SCRIPT1028: Expected identifier, string or number

 Column 136 is the trailing comma/closing brace for the object literal. I've 'fixed' the code so the user should have no more problems, but I'm wondering: What could make the same version of IE on two different computers treat the JavaScript differently?

@TITLE:Is it possible to recompile the DataSnap packages in Delphi XE with a new/different version of Indy?
@CONTENT:Okay -- we have an interesting problem. Some background: Our main application uses Indy 10. However, we take the Indy 10 source and fix bugs in it, recompile, and install our own set of Indy components. We are migrating to Delphi XE and want to start using DataSnap. DataSnap requires the "official, shipping" version of Indy which is incompatible with our customized version of Indy. Our DataSnap servers will be separate applications, but since we have our own Indy installed in the IDE, we can't "cross the streams". Okay, therefore, we are unable to use Delphi XE's DataSnap out of the box because of this compatibility issue. So my questions is this: Is it possible to recompile the DataSnap packages in Delphi XE with a new/different version of Indy? Your thoughts gratefully accepted.

I have followed the documentation explicitly and have a successful managed to implement the protocol. However with mixed success I am experiencing some issues with the NFC lower level libraries beyond the control of my code. I have implemented the following: Foreground dispatching of a Pending Intent. The intent has a tech filter for IsoDep.class and action: ACTION_TAG_DISCOVERED Once the I then extract the Tag from the Intent Extra Issue APDU commands and process the responses The issue is that I have noticed a couple of things: On the Nexus S the position of the card is dependent on a successful communication flow, if it is not in the sweet spot I will receive an IOException If I get too many IOExceptions because the card has moved or not remained in the RF field I start to see the following excpetions (see below) I was wondering if anyone else had seen these issues?

@TITLE:How to establish a secure connection by using Synapse?
@CONTENT:I'm testing Synapse and want to know how can I establish a secure connection. I noticed it supports SSL, but I'm not sure whether it suits my needs. I don't have a certificate from CA. I just want to encrypt all data between my server program and client program. Sure, I can encrypt the data myself before sending out. But if SSL can encrypt the data, maybe I can just use it. From what I know, SSL is for "encryption" and "authentication". What I need is only "encryption". Is it possible with Synapse? UPDATE: Thanks for helping from daemon_x and the author of Synapse, Lukas Gebauer, I think I finally make it work. Here are what I did: Server Side: 1) Uses ssl_openssl in your unit and put 'libeay32.dll' and 'ssleay32.dll' to the same directory of the exe file 2) After a connection is accepted, add following lines of code for the newly created socket. fclient.SSLAcceptConnection;
 Client side: 1) Uses ssl_openssl in your unit and put 'libeay32.dll' and 'ssleay32.dll' to the same directory of the exe file 2) After connected to the server, add following line. fclient.SSLDoConnect;
 If no error occurred, the connection is secure now. But when you run your code, as said in document of Synapse, you may notice that the SSLAcceptConnection takes some time to return. So if you want to speed things up, you better create a certificate file and private key file upfront. And add following code before SSLAcceptConnection   fclient.SSL.CertificateFile := 'bs-cert';
  fclient.SSL.PrivateKeyFile := 'bs-privatekey';
 If you don't have a certificate and private key, please refer to "CreateSelfSignedCert" in ssl_openssl for getting a self-signed certificate and private key. You can save, by WriteStrToStream for example, FCertificate and FPrivatekey to files and use them later.
@CODE:fclient.SSLAcceptConnection; fclient.SSLDoConnect; fclient.SSL.CertificateFile := 'bs-cert';
  fclient.SSL.PrivateKeyFile := 'bs-privatekey';

@LINK:/questions/6333445/replacing-case-class-inheritance-with-extractors-preserving-exhaustiveness-check
@TITLE:Replacing case class inheritance with extractors preserving exhaustiveness checks in Scala
@CONTENT:I have a simple class hierarchy that represents a graph-like structure with several distinct types of vertexes implemented using case classes: sealed trait Node

sealed abstract case class Vertex extends Node
case class Arc extends Node

case class VertexType1 (val a:Int) extends Vertex
case class VertexType2 (val b:Int) extends Vertex
 This allows me to write match blocks like this: def test (x: Node) = x match {
  case _ : Arc => "got arc"
  case _ : Vertex => "got vertex"
}
 or like this: def test (x: Node) = x match {
  case _ : Arc => "got arc"
  case c : Vertex => c match {
    case _ : VertexType1(a) => "got type 1 vertex " + a
    case _ : VertexType2(a) => "got type 2 vertex " + a
  }
}
 Note that this implementation has the following properties: 1) It allows writing match blocks that differentiate between arcs and vertices, but not between specific vertex types, but also match blocks that do differentiate between vertex types. 2) In both vertex-type-specific and non-vertex-type-specific match blocks the exhaustiveness of pattern matching is checked. However, inheritance from case classes is deprecated, and the compiler suggests to use extractors instead to support matching on non-leaf nodes (i.e., in the above example, to differentiate between arcs and vertices, but not between vertex types). The question: is it possible to implement a similar class hierarchy without using case class inheritance, but still having pattern exhaustiveness checks performed by the compiler in both use cases shown above? EDIT: I have added a constructor parameter to the VertexType classes so that the match is not performed only on types. My current implementation without the case classes is as follows: sealed trait Node

sealed abstract class Vertex extends Node
class Arc extends Node

class VertexType1 (val a:Int) extends Vertex
class VertexType2 (val b:Int) extends Vertex

object VertexType1 {
  def unapply (x : VertexType1) : Some[Int] = Some(x.a)
}

object VertexType2 {
  def unapply (x : VertexType2) : Some[Int] = Some(x.b)
}
 And the test code: def test (x: Node) = x match {
  case _ : Arc => "got arc" 
  case v : Vertex => v match {
    case VertexType1(a) => "got vertex type 1 " + a 
  }
}
 I expect a warning about non-exhaustive match in the second block (VertexType2 is never matched), but there isn't one. Actually, Scala compilers before 2.9.0-RC3 produce a warning that I expect to see, but versions starting with RC3 (including 2.9.0 and 2.9.0-1) do not, which is rather confusing.

} def test (x: Node) = x match {

  case c : Vertex => c match {

    case _ : VertexType2(a) => "got type 2 vertex " + a

@TITLE:JQuery animate border without moving div
@CONTENT:I want to animate a div by first making it's border thicker by 5px on mouseenter, then decreasing the border by 5px on mouseleave, the tricky part is that I don't want the div to look like it's moving (if you just animate the borders, the whole div will look like it shifts, not just the border getting thicker/thinner). I'm very close, but I'm stuck on the last part: mouseleave. What I have so far is: $("#thumbdiv<%=s.id.to_s%>").bind({
            mouseenter: function(){
                $(this).animate({
                    borderRightWidth: "25px",
                    borderTopWidth: "25px",
                    borderLeftWidth: "25px",
                    borderBottomWidth: "25px",

                    margin: "-5px"
                }, 500);
            },
            mouseleave: function(){

                $(this).animate({
                    borderRightWidth: "20px",
                    borderTopWidth: "20px",
                    borderLeftWidth: "20px",
                    borderBottomWidth: "20px",

                    margin: "0px"
                }, 500);
            }
        });
 I set the border to be 20px somewhere before this, and the margin is not set, so it's 0px. The div animates just fine on mouseenter, I can make the border thicker without the div actually moving out of place, but when the mouseleave is triggered, the div will first relocate itself to the position as if the "margin -5px" was never called, and then decrease it's border slowly and it seems like the "magin: '0px'" isn't actually being called. I'm not sure if my description makes sense, I can put up a prototype if needed.
@CODE:$("#thumbdiv<%=s.id.to_s%>").bind({
            mouseenter: function(){
                $(this).animate({
                    borderRightWidth: "25px",
                    borderTopWidth: "25px",
                    borderLeftWidth: "25px",
                    borderBottomWidth: "25px",

                    margin: "-5px"
                }, 500);
            },
            mouseleave: function(){

                $(this).animate({

@TITLE:In Entity Framework, getting the value of an identity column after inserting
@CONTENT:I'm using EF4. I want to insert a new MyObject into the database. MyObject has two fields: Id: int (Identity) and Name: string As I've seen in documentation Entity Framework is supposed to set MyObject.Id to the value generated by database after the call to SaveChanges() but in my case that doesn't happen. using (var context = new MyEntities())
{
    var myObject = MyObjects.CreateMyObject(0, "something"); // The first parameter is identity "Id"
    context.MyObjects.AddObject(myObject);
    context.SaveChanges();
    return myObject.Id; // The returned value is 0
}
 UPDATE: This happens in one of my entities and others work fine. By the way, I checked and the DB column is identity and StoreGeneratedPattern is set to Identity. Here is the SSDL. I don't see any difference. The first one isn't working right:     <EntityType Name="OrgUnit">
      <Key>
        <PropertyRef Name="Srl" />
      </Key>
      <Property Name="Srl" Type="int" Nullable="false" StoreGeneratedPattern="Identity" />
      <Property Name="TypeId" Type="smallint" Nullable="false" />
      <Property Name="Name" Type="varchar" Nullable="false" MaxLength="80" />      
    </EntityType>

    <EntityType Name="OrgType">
      <Key>
        <PropertyRef Name="Srl" />
      </Key>
      <Property Name="Srl" Type="smallint" Nullable="false" StoreGeneratedPattern="Identity" />
      <Property Name="Title" Type="varchar" Nullable="false" MaxLength="120" />
      <Property Name="Options" Type="int" Nullable="false" />

 The update is done successfully in the database and the identity is generated but the entity object is not updated with the new identity.
@CODE:using (var context = new MyEntities())
{
    var myObject = MyObjects.CreateMyObject(0, "something"); // The first parameter is identity "Id"

@CONTENT:Is it valid if I need to send the form data in the HTTP PUT request? If you could point me to a spec then that would be great. [updating] I have gone through the HTTP 1.1 spec. But I did not find whether PUT requests can have Form data or not. I am using Java for creating and accessing RESTful webservices. POST supports application/x-www-form-urlencoded as the Content-Type. From the specification, I understand that POST is for creating a new resource (a subresource to the resource identified by the request URI) and PUT is for create or update a resource. But my doubt is whether PUT method also can have form data in it? I trying to find out whether it is fine according to the spec. And I can't find anything about this in the HTTP 1.1 spec.

For example, if Firefox sends a request to some server's port 80 and is waiting for the answer. Is it possible then to find Firefox listening port and trick Firefox into showing ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED or something similar. I would like a solution that does not prevent the data flow and lets the application handle this situation in its way, but rather close the socket or the TCP/IP connection (which should be possible as the socket is something the OS is responsible for I think? Is the connection also a OS property or just something the application does?) so the application would react immediately.

 Unfortunately, there was a bug somewhere, because what we wanted was: CONSTRAINT `fk_conversation_tags_tags` FOREIGN KEY (`tag_id`) REFERENCES `tags` (`id`)

@TITLE:Is subclassing a User model really bad to do in Rails?
@CONTENT:I am getting lots of push back from Rails because I have subclassed User into many different subclasses. In my application, not all users are equal. There's actually a lot of model objects and not every User type has access to them. I also need a way to do polymorphic behaviour. For example, many methods will behave differently depending on the type. Isn't that what polymorphism is for? But the thing is, I am always getting push back from Rails. The defaults - especially the way forms submit to parameter hashes - seem to work like non-subclassed models. Links and parameter hashes are just two ways in which the defaults really bite you. What is the "right" way to handle complex logic for different types of Users in Rails? In Java, the subclassing model works - you don't have to go through hoops to get it to work the way you want to. But in Rails, it's hard to get subclasses to work with REST conventions, it punishes you when you forget to include :as => :user, or it punishes you when you put a subclassed object in links, such as edit_user_path(@user) <- bad idea! There's one other area which is also very hard to deal with. Let's say I have a Company model and it has many Users. These users can be directors, instructors, trainees, etc - all different subclasses. When we create the account, we might want to use accepts_nested_attributes_for :users. However, if we use this, we can't specify the classes that it creates. Bloody hell! It seems like everything in Rails is designed to not want you to subclass your models. If you don't subclass, everything 'just works'. But if you subclass, you are in for hell. What is the solution?

@CONTENT:I installed the windows phone 7 mango sdk in order to experiment with multitasking and some other mango-only features. I upgraded my project to 7.1 only to realize that there is not an update for the developer phone also. Since I need to test on the actual phone to prove things to my teacher, I need to downgrade to 7.0. I removed all Mango-only code, but now cannot downgrade the project. How can I manually downgrade the project to 7.0? I tried to create a new project and move over the code, but there is a lot of stuff that does not work correctly. I also tried setting some XML files to 7.0, but it does not build. What files are changed when upgrading?

@TITLE:Does a modern JVM optimize simple inline anonymous class allocation?
@CONTENT:I got a code review remark today to extract this anonymous class into a field, to avoid allocating it over and over again: Collections.transform(new Function<Foo, Bar>(){
  Bar apply(Foo foo) {
    // do some simple local transform of foo into a Bar.
  }
});
 I replied that "it doesn't matter, the JVM optimizes it". While I know for a fact that this "optimization" won't affect the performance in any way and I think the added value of having the code accessible inline is worth it, I'm curious if I was right about the JVM optimization. So, my question is - it the proposed refactoring absolutely a no-op, because the JVM will optimize it anyway, or is there some minuscule theoretical perf gain here?

@CONTENT:Microsoft Windows 2000 and later versions expose the Data Protection API (DPAPI) that encrypts data for a per-user or per-system context. The caller does not provide a key with which to encrypt the data. Rather, the data is encrypted with a key derived from the user or system credentials. This API is conveniently exposed in .NET via the ProtectedData class: // Encrypts the data in a specified byte array and returns a byte array
// that contains the encrypted data.
public static byte[] Protect(
    byte[] userData,
    byte[] optionalEntropy,

@TITLE:Inherited test class from generic base is ignored in MSTest
@CONTENT:When creating a generic base test class in MSTest, and inheriting from it, I'm unable to run the tests of all the inheriting classes. BaseDependencyPropertyFactoryTest is located in the Whathecode.PresentationFramework.Tests assembly. It is the generic base class. (BaseDependencyPropertyFactoryTest<TTestClass>) Both assemblies have a test inheriting from this base class, called DependencyPropertyFactoryTest. All the inherited class does is passing a specific type argument. [TestClass]
public class DependencyPropertyFactoryTest
    : BaseDependencyPropertyFactoryTest<ASpecificClass>
{
}
 Only the inheriting test located in the same assembly as the base class seems to run. The inherited test in the Whathecode.PresentationFramework.Aspects.Tests assembly seems to be ignored entirely. What am I doing wrong? When desired I could upload all the required source code, but you will need PostSharp for the aspects assembly. As a test, I tried adding a test to the inherited test class in the aspects assembly, which calls all the tests in the base test class. [TestMethod]
public void AllBaseTests()
{
    ClrGetterSetterTest();
    DependencyPropertyGetterSetterTest();
}
 This gives the following result. Strangely enough this test is executed! For now this might work as a way to at least run them, but of course I don't want to edit this test each time I add extra tests in the base class. Why are those base tests skipped, and why the indication 'Aborted'?

@LINK:/questions/5899274/shuffle-list-with-some-conditions
@TITLE:Shuffle list with some conditions
@CONTENT:I have a list of elements which can be easily compared using Equals(). I have to shuffle the list, but the shuffle must satisfy one condition: The i'th element shuffledList[i] must not equal elements at i +/- 1 nor elements at i +/- 2. The list should be considered circular; that is, the last element in the list is followed by the first, and vice versa. Also, if possible, I would like to check if the shuffle is even possible. Note: I'm using c# 4.0. EDIT: Based on some responses, I will explain a little more: The list wont have more than 200 elements, so there isn't a real need for good performance. If it takes 2 secs to calculate it it's not the best thing, but it's not the end of the world either. The shuffled list will be saved, and unless the real list changes, the shuffled list will be used. Yes, it's a "controlled" randomness, but I expect that severals run on this method would return different shuffled lists. I will make further edits after I try some of the responses below. EDIT 2: Two sample list that fails with Sehe's implementation (Both have solutions): Sample1: `List<int> list1 = new List<int>{0,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,10};`
 Possible solution: List<int> shuffledList1 = new List<int> {9,3,1,4,7,9,2,6,8,1,4,9,2,0,6,5,7,8,4,3,10,9,6,7,8,5,3,9,1,2,7,8} Sample 2: `List<int> list2 = new List<int> {0,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,10};`
 Verify: I'm using this method, that it's not the most eficient nor elegant piece of code I've made, but it does it's work: public bool TestShuffle<T>(IEnumerable<T> input)

@TITLE:Optimize LINQ for IList
@CONTENT:A while ago I wrote an IList extension method to enumerate across part of a list by using the indices. While refactoring I realized a similar query could be performed by calling Skip(toSkip).Take(amount). While benchmarking this I noticed that Skip isn't optimized for IList. With a bit of googling I ended up at a Jon Skeet post, discussing why optimizing methods like Skip is dangerous. As far as I understand the article, the problem is no exception is thrown in the optimized methods when the collection is modified, but as a comment states the msdn documentation conflicts itself. In IEnumerator.MoveNext(): If changes are made to the collection, such as adding, modifying, or deleting elements, the enumerator is irrecoverably invalidated and the next call to MoveNext or Reset throws an InvalidOperationException. In IEnumerator.GetEnumerator(): If changes are made to the collection, such as adding, modifying, or deleting elements, the enumerator is irrecoverably invalidated and its behavior is undefined. I see merit in both conventions, and am a bit lost whether or not to optimize. What is a proper solution? I've been considering an IList.AssumeImmutable() approach along the lines of AsParallel() as mentioned by Kris Vandermotten in the comments. Does any implementation already exist, or is it a bad idea?

@TITLE:How and why does PyCharm alter Python's import logic?
@CONTENT:I have a PyCharm 1.2.1 on Windows. I have to edit different branches of the same project - somewhat heavy branches, because they live in different folders on disk - say it to be c:\apps\alpha and c:\apps\beta. For each such folder PYTHONPATH variable should be adjusted to point to appropriate vendor libraries which live somewhere inside project root folder (c:\alpha\vendor,...). I managed to work around this issue by starting PyCharm from cmd batch file which sets necessary PYTHONPATH variable value before starting PyCharm (so I have PyCharm.cmd inside alpha and PyCharm.cmd inside beta directories). Problem: when I open PyCharm for editing beta folder, import statement imports modules from alpha folder! When I start python.exe interpreter from command line everything works as expected - the problem seems to be only with PyCharm. Second strange investigation: executing print sys.path code from PyCharm and from external python.exe interpreter give different results - from PyCharm it do not show my PYTHONPATH modules. I'm a newcomer in Python and PyCharm, but this behavior looks very strange and inconsistent. Finally I've found some settings in PyCharm IDE that looks like should allow me to resolve this issue - File -> Settings -> Python Interpreter. There I've found all paths for both alpha and beta folders. There is no way to clear this paths list, only to disable some elements. But even disabling works somewhat stupidly - I should disable/re-enable them separately for each time I edit alpha or beta "solution folders". So final question: how one can with PyCharm edit separate projects (folders) and force PyCharm not to import modules from wrong locations?

@CONTENT:The simple thing of calling FB.init (right before </body>) and then FB.getLoginStatus(callback) doesn't fire the callback function. After some debugging, I think the SDK is stuck in the "loading" (i.e. FB.Auth._loadState == 'loading') phase and never gets to "loaded", so all callbacks are queued until the SDK has loaded. If I force-fire the "loaded" event during debugging - with FB.Event.fire('FB.loginStatus', 'loaded') in case you're intersted - then the callbacks are invoked correctly. Extra details that might be relevant: My app is a facebook iframe app (loaded via apps.facebook.com/myapp) I'm using IE9. The same behavior happens in Chrome The app is hosted in http://localhost What's going on? Why is the SDK never gets to loaded? Thanks UPDATE: Just tried it on Chrome and it worked (not sure why it didn't work before). Still doesn't work in IE

@CONTENT:The question is stated in the subject: are the advantages of Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern worth the overhead? In many cases, implementing the view model involves quite significant overhead of duplicating the Model properties and sometimes synchronization between Model and ViewModel data members. For example, currently in Silverlight 4 & WCF RIA, View Models are not generated (if the developer follows the MVVM pattern, it is up to him to create the view models, often duplicating the corresponding Model's properties at ViewModel, that do nothing significant but refer to Model as the storage). Why not extending the Model class, providing additional properties to make it easy to be consumed by the View instead?

@TITLE:Ordering method return values with Rhino-Mock stubs
@CONTENT:I've started experimenting with Rhino-Mocks (3.6) while reading Roy Osherove's The Art of Unit Testing. He has an example that demonstrates that a mocked method can be scripted to return different results when called twice with the same parameter:    [Test]
    public void ReturnResultsFromMock()
    {
        MockRepository repository = new MockRepository();
        IGetRestuls resultGetter = repository.DynamicMock<IGetRestuls>();
        using(repository.Record())
        {
            resultGetter.GetSomeNumber("a");
            LastCall.Return(1);

            resultGetter.GetSomeNumber("a");
            LastCall.Return(2);

            resultGetter.GetSomeNumber("b");
            LastCall.Return(3);

        }

        int result = resultGetter.GetSomeNumber("b");
        Assert.AreEqual(3, result);

        int result2 = resultGetter.GetSomeNumber("a");
        Assert.AreEqual(1, result2);

        int result3 = resultGetter.GetSomeNumber("a");
        Assert.AreEqual(2, result3);
    }
 This works fine. But when I try the same thing with a Stub, and a method that accepts and returns a string, I am not able to generate the second return value:     [Test]
    public void StubMethodWithStringParameter_ScriptTwoResponses_SameResponseReceived()
    {
        MockRepository mocks = new MockRepository();
        IMessageProvider stub = mocks.Stub<IMessageProvider>();

        using (mocks.Record())
        {
            stub.GetMessageForValue("a");
            LastCall.Return("First call");
            stub.GetMessageForValue("a");
            LastCall.Return("Second call");
        }

        Assert.AreEqual("First call", stub.GetMessageForValue("a"));
        Assert.AreEqual("Second call", stub.GetMessageForValue("a"));
    }
}

public interface IMessageProvider
{
    string GetMessage();
    string GetMessageForValue(string value);
}
 This test is failing, because "First Call" is received for both calls. I've tried several wrinkles of syntax (Using mocks.Ordered(), SetResult, Expect etc.), but am still unable to get the second result to appear. Am I doing something wrong, or is this a limitation with Rhino-Mocks? I've checked this blog post, but the suggested syntax did not resolve my issue.
@CODE:[Test]

@TITLE:Are the advantages of Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern worth the overhead?
@CONTENT:The question is stated in the subject: are the advantages of Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern worth the overhead? In many cases, implementing the view model involves quite significant overhead of duplicating the Model properties and sometimes synchronization between Model and ViewModel data members. For example, currently in Silverlight 4 & WCF RIA, View Models are not generated (if the developer follows the MVVM pattern, it is up to him to create the view models, often duplicating the corresponding Model's properties at ViewModel, that do nothing significant but refer to Model as the storage). Why not extending the Model class, providing additional properties to make it easy to be consumed by the View instead?

@TITLE:Ordering method return values with Rhino-Mock stubs
@CONTENT:I've started experimenting with Rhino-Mocks (3.6) while reading Roy Osherove's The Art of Unit Testing. He has an example that demonstrates that a mocked method can be scripted to return different results when called twice with the same parameter:    [Test]
    public void ReturnResultsFromMock()
    {
        MockRepository repository = new MockRepository();
        IGetRestuls resultGetter = repository.DynamicMock<IGetRestuls>();
        using(repository.Record())
        {
            resultGetter.GetSomeNumber("a");
            LastCall.Return(1);

            resultGetter.GetSomeNumber("a");
            LastCall.Return(2);

            resultGetter.GetSomeNumber("b");
            LastCall.Return(3);

        }

        int result = resultGetter.GetSomeNumber("b");
        Assert.AreEqual(3, result);

        int result2 = resultGetter.GetSomeNumber("a");
        Assert.AreEqual(1, result2);

        int result3 = resultGetter.GetSomeNumber("a");
        Assert.AreEqual(2, result3);
    }
 This works fine. But when I try the same thing with a Stub, and a method that accepts and returns a string, I am not able to generate the second return value:     [Test]
    public void StubMethodWithStringParameter_ScriptTwoResponses_SameResponseReceived()
    {
        MockRepository mocks = new MockRepository();
        IMessageProvider stub = mocks.Stub<IMessageProvider>();

        using (mocks.Record())
        {
            stub.GetMessageForValue("a");
            LastCall.Return("First call");
            stub.GetMessageForValue("a");
            LastCall.Return("Second call");
        }

        Assert.AreEqual("First call", stub.GetMessageForValue("a"));
        Assert.AreEqual("Second call", stub.GetMessageForValue("a"));
    }
}

public interface IMessageProvider
{
    string GetMessage();
    string GetMessageForValue(string value);
}
 This test is failing, because "First Call" is received for both calls. I've tried several wrinkles of syntax (Using mocks.Ordered(), SetResult, Expect etc.), but am still unable to get the second result to appear. Am I doing something wrong, or is this a limitation with Rhino-Mocks? I've checked this blog post, but the suggested syntax did not resolve my issue.

@TITLE:TimeSpan ¡§pretty time¡¨ format in C#
@CONTENT:Typing in the title to this question brought me to this question. I'm looking for the same thing, but something perhaps less statically formatted if you get what I mean? I'm writing a quick program that will be taking a TimeSpan duration of two DateTime objects and outputting them for printing to paper. The format that would be preferred is: XX days, YY hours, ZZ minutes (seconds are irrelevant; as are days because I don't expect the timespan to incorporate more than a few hours). Say the following code (as an example): DateTime start = DateTime.Now;
DateTime end = DateTime.Now.AddMinutes(135);
TimeSpan duration = (end - start);

// output duration as XX hours, YY minutes
 Thanks, Zack P.S. I also ran across "PrettyTime.NET", but it output things like "3 days ago", etc. Every other topic I found on google to format time duration strings like the above examples lead me to a Java-based solution. :\ UPDATE 2014-09-08: To follow-up after 3 years, I've found an awesome library on NuGet and Github called "Humanizer" which would solve this issue I was having. I haven't used it that much, but I did try it and it works beautifully. It's quite large of a library though (it emits a whole ton of folders for different cultures to your project's build path (I'm sure there's a way to to customize it)).

@CONTENT:I'm using rails 3.0.5, rspec2 with latest capybara. Routes setup like: scope "(:locale)", :locale => /de|fr|it|en/ do

 In application_controller I have this: def default_url_options(options={})
  options[:locale] = "es"

end
 So in my views I can use link_to 'test', dossier_path(1)
 without any problems. But when I do the same in capybara's visit it tries to use the 1 for the locale and not for the id. It only works when I use visit dossier_path(nil, 1)
 or visit dossier_path(:id => 1)
 But both are ugly and looks like a dirty hack. So why do I need to use this dirty hack and what do I jave to do, so that I can use the path methods just like in the views (so without the dirty hack of having to add nil or explicitly pass :id => ...)? :)

@TITLE:How do you access the roles of the currentItem from a listview in QML?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to access a role from a ListView in QML. Essentially, I have this in my QML: ListView {
    id: myId
    model: myModel
    delegate: Item {
        Text {
            text: model.text
        }
        Text {
            text: model.moreText
        }
    }
}
 myModel is a QAbstractListModel implementation. The QML portion of this is a reusable component, so the model could have any number of different roles with various data types. What I would like to do is bind to the value of a given role of the currentItem property of the ListView. In other words, I'd like to have some other Component on the page that could bind a property to the currently selected item in the ListView as follows: Text {
    text: myId.currentItem.text // Or myId.currentItem.model.text (or something similar)
}
 Please keep in mind that I need this generically available, as I'll be doing this a lot for a number of model types and I'm trying not to write that kind of custom code for each model and ListView. It seems like it should be simple to access a property of the currently selected item, but as far as I can tell it is not possible. The problem is complicated further by the fact that models appear to be treated differently when there is only one role. By this I mean that sometimes you access your roles via model.roleName whereas when there is only one role you use modelData. If anybody has any suggestions, I would truly appreciate it. Thanks so much! EDIT I found this: http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lib.qt.qml/1778 However, this doesn't appear to work for me. I'm getting type errors when I try to use the data in my QML scripts, and there is no type casting available so I'm not sure what to do. Any suggestions are welcome! Thanks! Jack

 If I open up my Junit jar file that I'm using, under junit/textui I only have a class called TestRunner. This makes me think IntelliJ is trying to use the wrong version (i.e., not 3.7) What can I try? I've Googled this but haven't had much luck

@TITLE:Rails: Save collection of updated records all at once
@CONTENT:As I understand it, the build method can be used to build up a collection of associated records before saving. Then, when calling save, all the child records will be validated and saved, and if there are validation errors the parent record will have an error reflecting this. First question is, is this correct? But my main question is, assuming the above is valid, is it possible to do the same thing with updates, not creates? In other words, is there a way to update several records in a collection associated with a parent record, then save the parent record and have all the updates take place at once (with an error in the parent if there are validation errors in the children)? Edit: So to summarize, I'm wondering the right way to handle a case where a parent record and several associated child records need to be updated and saved all at once, with any errors aborting the whole save process.

@TITLE:Is the gcc insane optimisation level (-O3) not insane enough?
@CONTENT:As part of answering another question, I wanted to show that the insane level of optimisation of gcc (-O3) would basically strip out any variables that weren't used in main. The code was: #include <stdio.h>
int main (void) {
   char bing[71];
   int x = 7;
   bing[0] = 11;
   return 0;
}
 and the gcc -O3 output was:     .file "qq.c"
    .text
    .p2align 4,,15
.globl main
    .type main, @function
main:
    pushl %ebp
    xorl %eax, %eax
    movl %esp, %ebp
    popl %ebp
    ret
    .size main, .-main
    .ident "GCC: (Ubuntu 4.4.3-4ubuntu5) 4.4.3"
    .section .note.GNU-stack,"",@progbits
 Now I can see it's removed the local variables but there's still quite a bit of wastage in there. It seems to me that the entire:     pushl %ebp
    xorl %eax, %eax
    movl %esp, %ebp
    popl %ebp
    ret
 section could be replaced with the simpler:     xorl %eax, %eax
    ret
 Does anyone have any idea why gcc does not perform this optimisation? I know that would save very little for main itself but, if this were done with normal functions as well, the effect of unnecessarily adjusting the stack pointer in a massive loop would be considerable. The command used to generate the assembly was: gcc -O3 -std=c99 -S qq.c
@CODE:gcc -O3 #include <stdio.h>
int main (void) {
   char bing[71];
   int x = 7;
   bing[0] = 11;
   return 0;
} gcc -O3 .file "qq.c"
    .text
    .p2align 4,,15

    .type main, @function

@CONTENT:I need to create a horizontal navigation menu with a changing number of items (this is important - I can't hard-code widths into the CSS and I don't want to calculate them with JS) that fill up to a certain width, let's say 800px. With tables, <table width="800" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tr>

 Note that longer items take up more space and I can add items into the HTML without changing anything in CSS and the menu items shrink to accommodate additional items - the whole menu never being shorter or longer than 800px. As a menu isn't a semantically correct use of a table, can this be done with say a list and pure CSS?

@CONTENT:I am having trouble figuring out something with the Entity Framework Code First stuff in CTP 5. It is doing caching of objects and I don't want it to. For example, I load a page (working with an ASP.NET MVC site) which loads an object. I then go change the database. I re-load the page and the changes are not reflected. If I kill the site and rerun it then it obviously re-fetches. How do I, either generally for a type, or even for a particular query, tell it to always go get a new copy. I think it might have something to do with MergeOption but I'm having trouble finding examples that work with CTP 5. Thanks.

@CONTENT:Is it possible to have a CollectionElementCollection with a number of different by type CollectionElements, e.g.: <collection>
    <add type="MyType1, MyLib" Type1SpecificProp="1" />
    <add type="MyType2, MyLib" Type2SpecificProp="2" />
</collection
 I have all classes required for such solution: class MyCollection : ConfigurationElementCollection { }
class MyElement : ConfigurationElement { }
class MyType1 : MyElement { }
class MyType2 : MyElement { }
...
etc
 but when I start my application I'm getting next predictable error: Unrecognized attribute 'Type1SpecificProp'. because Type1SpecificProp is defined in MyType1 not MyElement, especially if MyCollection has next method: protected override ConfigurationElement CreateNewElement()
{
    return new MyElement(); // but I want instantiate not the base class but by a type given
}
 i.e. returns base class thus OnDeserializeUnrecognizedAttribute() in child classed are never been called. So the question is: how to let child classes to resolve unknown elements by their self?
@CODE:<collection>
    <add type="MyType1, MyLib" Type1SpecificProp="1" />

@LINK:/questions/4872707/calling-a-method-in-constructor
@TITLE:Calling a Method in Constructor
@CONTENT:Herb Sutter mentions in one of his http://www.gotw.ca articles that an object is constructed(has valid existence) only if the constructor executes completes.ie to put it in a crude way control passes beyond its final brace. Now consider the following code class A
{
  public:
  A() 
  { 
      f();
  }

  void f() 
  { 
      cout << "hello, world"; 
  }

}; 

int main()
{
   A a;
}
 Now from what Herb says, can't we say that since A is not completely constructed inside its constructor Calling f() inside the constructor is invalid as the "this" ptr is not ready yet. Still there is indeed a valid "this" inside the constructor and f() does get called. I don't think Herb is saying something incorrect... but guess i am interpreting it incorrectly....can some explain to me what exactly that is? Here is the link to the article : http://www.gotw.ca/gotw/066.htm It talks about exceptions from constructors. Specifically here is the extract from it on which my question is based: -When does an object's lifetime begin? When its constructor completes successfully and returns normally. That is, control reaches the end of the constructor body or an earlier return statement. -When does an object's lifetime end? When its destructor begins. That is, control reaches the beginning of the destructor body. Important point here is that the state of the object before its lifetime begins is exactly the same as after its lifetime ends -- there is no object, period. This observation brings us to the key question: We might summarize the C++ constructor model as follows: Either:

(a) The constructor returns normally by reaching its end or a return statement, and the object exists.

Or:

(b) The constructor exits by emitting an exception, and the object not only does not now exist, but never existed.
@CODE:class A
{
  public:
  A() 
  { 
      f();
  }

  void f() 
  { 
      cout << "hello, world"; 
  }

}; 

int main()
{
   A a;
} Either:

(a) The constructor returns normally by reaching its end or a return statement, and the object exists.

Or:

(b) The constructor exits by emitting an exception, and the object not only does not now exist, but never existed.

@TITLE:Applying CQRS - Is unit testing the thin read layer necessary?
@CONTENT:Given that some of the advice for implementing CQRS advocates fairly close-to-the-metal query implementation, such as ADO.NET queries directly against the database (or perhaps a LINQ-based ORM), is it a mistake to try and unit test them? I wonder if it's really even necessary? My thoughts on the matter: The additional architectural complexity to provide a mockable "Thin Read Layer" seems opposite to the very nature of the advice to keep the architectural ceremony to a minimum. The number of unit tests to effectively cover every angle of query that a user might compose is horrendous. Specifically I'm trying CQRS out in an ASP.NET MVC application and am wondering whether to bother unit testing my controller action methods, or just test the Domain Model instead.

Here is what I am trying to do. Create a Razor helper Compile helper Run compiled helper, passing in a ViewModel Get the output of the helper as some sort of HTML/XML/tree structure The reason that I want to do this is so that I can test for specific parts of the output. The helper will likely spit out HTML that includes various output gunk. What I want to do is to see if there is a Checkbox with a particular value (for example). If you have seen Selenium tests, it is similar to what I would like to do, except not as server driven tests. Is there some way to get compiled Razor (or other view engine) views to emit something other than strings?

@CONTENT:I'm having a very hard time trying to get a unidirectional one-to-one relationship to work with JPA (Provider: Hibernate). In my opinion this should not be too much of a hassle but apparently JPA / Hibernate disagrees on that ;-) The problem is that I have to map a legacy schema which I cannot change and that this schema uses a shared primary key between two entities which at the same time is the foreign key for one entity. I created a simple TestCase: DB looks as follows: CREATE TABLE PARENT (PARENT_ID Number primary key, Message varchar2(50));

CREATE TABLE CHILD (CHILD_ID Number primary key, Message varchar2(50),
CONSTRAINT FK_PARENT_ID FOREIGN KEY (CHILD_ID )REFERENCES PARENT (PARENT_ID));

CREATE SEQUENCE SEQ_PK_PARENT START WITH 1 INCREMENT BY 1 ORDER;
 The parent(=owning side of one-to-one) looks as follows: @Entity
@Table(name = "PARENT")
public class Parent implements java.io.Serializable {       
    private Long parentId;
    private String message;
    private Child child;

    @Id
    @Column(name = "PARENT_ID", unique = true, nullable = false, precision = 22, scale = 0)
    @SequenceGenerator(name="pk_sequence", sequenceName="SEQ_PK_PARENT")
    @GeneratedValue(generator="pk_sequence", strategy=GenerationType.SEQUENCE)
    public Long getParentId() {
        return this.parentId;
    }

    public void setParentId(Long parentId) {
        this.parentId = parentId;
    }

    @Column(name = "MESSAGE", length = 50)
    public String getMessage() {
        return this.message;
    }

    public void setMessage(String message) {
        this.message = message;
    }

    @OneToOne (cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
    @PrimaryKeyJoinColumn(name="PARENT_ID", referencedColumnName="CHILD_ID")
    public Child getTestOneToOneChild() {
        return this.child;
    }

    public void setTestOneToOneChild(Child child) {
        this.child = child;
    }
}
 The child: @Entity
@Table(name = "TEST_ONE_TO_ONE_CHILD", schema = "EXTUSER")
public class Child implements java.io.Serializable {    
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
    private Long childId;       

    private String message;

    public Child() {
    }

    public Child(String message) {
        this.message = message;
    }

    @Id
    @Column(name = "CHILD_ID")    
    public Long getChildId() {
        return this.childId;
    }

    public void setChildId(Long childId) {
        this.childId = childId;
    }

    @Column(name = "MESSAGE", length = 50)
    public String getMessage() {
        return this.message;
    }

    public void setMessage(String message) {
        this.message = message;
    }
}
 I totally see the problem that JPA does not know how to assign the id for the child. However I also tried using Hibernates "foreign" key Generator with also no success because that one needs to have a back reference to the parent from child which is not desirable. This problem does not seem too uncommon to me, so what am I missing here? Is there a solution at all? I can also use hibernate extensions if pure JPA does not provide a solution. My expectations for a correct behavior would be: If I try to persist the parent with a child attached: get ID from sequence, set it on the parent persist parent set parent's ID on child persist child If I try to persist a "standalone" child (e.g. entityManager.persist(aChild)) I would expect a RuntimeException. Any help is greatly appreciated!

@CONTENT:Quite often I see people explicitly calling super() in a class that doesn't explicitly extend anything. public class Foo
{
  public Foo()

    super();

  }
}
 Now I know this is perfectly legal and if omitted the call is added by the compiler but I still think its bad practice. Whenever I see this I wonder if the programmer has some misunderstanding of inheritance and the fact that all classes implicitly extend Object. Should I add this to our coding standards/best practice and should I pull up the other devs in my team when I see them do it? Its a personal bug-bear of mine but I don't know if I'm just being picky or not.

@LINK:/questions/4635655/embedding-ironpython-built-in-help-command-my-clr-objects
@TITLE:Embedding IronPython, built-in help command, my CLR objects
@CONTENT:I'm embedding IronPython (2.6.1) in a C# assembly and exposing several objects to scripts which are executed with PythonEngine.ExecuteFile. I expose them either with scope.SetVariable("SomeObject", new SomeObject())
 or engine.Execute("from MyNamespace import SomeObject", scope)
 depending on how the scripts use them. My application assembly is added to the engine with engine.Runtime.LoadAssembly(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly())
 Now a script can execute help(SomeObject) and dump the nice little help info(*), however it's incomplete. None of the object's events or properties (public of course) show up and many of the 'built-in' members are missing as well. Here's the odd part; If I fire up ipy.exe and execute the following: import sys
sys.path.append('<location of my app>')
import clr
clr.AddReferenceToFile('myapp.exe')
from MyNamespace import SomeObject
help(SomeObject)
 I get a different dump, complete with all the missing members! Why do the two differ? Bonus question: Assuming I get it working correctly, is it possible to add descriptive text on my CLR objects to the output of help()? Like you can from within the script, on your python-native types? My first guess was the DescriptionAttribute, but that didn't work. (*) Obviously a final, working script wouldn't do this but it is exceedingly helpful while writing/testing the script.

@TITLE:Is there any way to force a JVM to use swap no matter how big the memory requirement is?
@CONTENT:Here is my situation: I have a task at hand that requires lots of memory. I do not have enough ram, and no matter what I tried (Jrockit with /3gb switch etc), I can't give JVM enough ram and the operation is terminated with an exception, telling me I need more heap space. Is there any way I can force the JVM to use the OS's swapping mechanism so that it won't run out of memory? This is Windows xp 32 bit It would take ages, but I would not care, I just need this operation to be completed. I've run out of options, and I have no control over any of the variables here.. This is a required edit, since I am having the same response from pretty much everyone :) This is not my code. Someone has written a tool that reads an xml file into a repository. The tool uses EMF, and loads the whole model at once. All I can do is to feed it the XML file. In case of native code running under Windows or Linux etc, the OS provides memory to it, using virtual memory/swap space, and the app does not know about it. I was wondering if it is possible to do the same with the JVM. Under Windows 32 bit, -Xmx can go up to a certain amount, but that is not enough. Going out and buying new hardware is not an option for me for the moment. So I was wondering if it is possible to make the JVM work like native processes. Slow, but still working. Apparently that is not possible, and I am out of luck. I just need to know if I'm really out of options.

@TITLE:Can't Deserialize GoogleMaps DirectionsResult Object
@CONTENT:I'm using the GoogleMaps API v3.0 and trying to save a DirectionsResult to my database and then retrieve it later to use on a map. My problem is that when I try to re-hydrate the saved object by pulling its JSON representation from my database, the object is just dumb JSON, it doesn't have the original methods and functions of its constituent objects. So, I built a fix routine that takes the dumbalt text JSON and rebuilds it by reconstructing all the LatLng and LatLngBound objects. But, something is still missing because my fixed object doesn't work like the original, the two points show up on my map but the purple line between them is missing.

@CONTENT:I'm trying to understand how to get a public key imported from PEM format (sample included in the code below) across XP, Vista and Windows 7. The sample code will import the key on both XP and Windows Vista/7, but not the same way. On Windows XP, the string "(Prototype)" is required in the cryptographic provider's name, and allows the call to CryptImportPublicKeyInfo to pass. On Windows 7, the "(Prototype)" provider is apparently present, but does not support the call to CryptImportPublicKeyInfo, which is confusing. What might a correct implementation look like between these operating systems? Is it necessary to detect XP and request the name with "(Prototype)", and without it for other operating systems? Is it possible that that will still fail on some XP systems? Or, is there a way to detect this confusing behavior and select whichever cryptographic provider will support the necessary call?

@TITLE:how to force linker to use shared library instead of static library?
@CONTENT:This is a quote from Linux programming book: % gcc -o app app.o -L. ¡Vltest Suppose that both libtest.a and libtest.so are available.Then the linker must choose one of the libraries and not the other.The linker searches each directory (first those specified with -L options, and then those in the standard directories).When the linker finds a directory that contains either libtest.a or libtest.so, the linker stops search directories. If only one of the two variants is present in the directory, the linker chooses that variant. Otherwise, the linker chooses the shared library version, unless you explicitly instruct it otherwise.You can use the -static option to demand static archives. For example, the following line will use the libtest.a archive, even if the libtest.so shared library is also available: % gcc -static -o app app.o -L. ¡Vltest Since if the linker encounters the directory that contains libtest.a it stops search and uses that static library, how to force the linker to search only for shared library, and not for static? % gcc -o app app.o -L. libtest.so ?

It is likely that you have attempted to include in an application the core library (or a part thereof) from a desktop virtual machine. This will most assuredly not work. At a minimum, it jeopardizes the compatibility of your app with future versions of the platform. It is also often of questionable legality. If you really intend to build a core library -- which is only appropriate as part of creating a full virtual machine distribution, as opposed to compiling an application -- then use the "--core-library" option to suppress this error message. If you go ahead and use "--core-library" but are in fact building an application, then be forewarned that your application will still fail to build or run, at some point. Please be prepared for angry customers who find, for example, that your application ceases to function once they upgrade their operating system. You will be to blame for this problem. If you are legitimately using some code that happens to be in a core package, then the easiest safe alternative you have is to repackage that code. That is, move the classes in question into your own package namespace. This means that they will never be in conflict with core system classes. If you find that you cannot do this, then that is an indication that the path you are on will ultimately lead to pain, suffering, grief, and lamentation.

@CONTENT:I'm jumping into rails programming for the first time and while looking at the code for some libraries I've downloaded, I occasionally notice the code: class << self
  def func

 I've tried searching the web for an explanation, but the << gets stripped from most useful search engines, so it ends up just searching for class self, which isn't very useful. Any insight would be appreciated.

@TITLE:maven can't add files in generated-sources for compilation phase
@CONTENT:I use Apache Thrift to generate code in target/generated-sources. The Thrift compiler produces a directory named gen-java which contains all the Java code. When I execute mvn compile, the code is generated correctly in target/generated-source/gen-java, but in compilation phase, it complains can't find the classes which defined in gen-java. In my understanding, Maven 2 automatically adds generated sources, is that right? And what if my testing code also depends on the generated-sources, do I have to manually specified the compiler includes?

@TITLE:Is it poor form for a C# class to subscribe to its own published events?
@CONTENT:I'm probably just being neurotic, but I regularly find myself in situations in which I have class that publishes an event, and I find it convenient to subscribe to this event from within the class itself (e.g. in the constructor), rather than only subscribing from external classes. This sounds reasonable to me, but I can't help the nagging feeling that it's a poor practice, for the simple reason that I'm always faced with the question: "Why not perform the actions that you'd provide in the event handler in the code which fires the event?" public class Button
{
   public Button()
   {
      this.Click += someHandler; // bad practice?
   }

   public event EventHandler Click;

   public void HandleInput()
   {
      if (someInputCondition)
      {
         // Perform necessary actions here rather than 
         // subscribing in the constructor?
         this.Click(this, ...);
      }
   }
}
 Are there any drawbacks to subscribing to your own events?

Loop through the list items; find the <a> tags and change their color and background Upon exiting the loop, change the color and the background of the HTML element that caused the event. Now, I can't seem to get to the part located in the for loop. I think I am making a mistake by calling GetElementsByTagName() method. Could you help me out? Thanks.

@TITLE:Java blocking issue: Why would JVM block threads in many different classes/methods?
@CONTENT:Update: This looks like a memory issue. A 3.8 Gb Hprof file indicated that the JVM was dumping-its-heap when this "blocking" occurred. Our operations team saw that the site wasn't responding, took a stack trace, then shut down the instance. I believe they shut down the site before the heap dump finished. The log had no errors/exceptions/evidence of problems--probably because the JVM was killed before it could generate an error message. Original Question We had a recent situation where the application appeared --to the end user--to hang. We got a stack trace before the application restart and I found some surprising results: of 527 threads, 463 had thread state BLOCKED. In the Past In the past blocked thread usually had this issue: 1) some obvious bottleneck: e.g. some database record lock or file system lock problem which caused other threads to wait. 2) All blocked threads would block on the same class/method (e.g. the jdbc or file system clases) Unusual Data In this case, I see all sorts of classes/methods blocked, including jvm internal classes, jboss classes, log4j, etc, in addition to application classes (including jdbc and lucene calls) The question what would cause a JVM to block log4j.Hierarchy.getLogger, java.lang.reflect.Constructor.newInstance?

    "weather.${currentStatus}", this, new Model<String>(ws)));
 But I want something really simple, and couldn't find a good example of that. Consider this kind of UI message in a .properties file: msg=Value is {0}
 Specifically, I wouldn't want to create a model object (with getters for the values to be replaced; like WeatherStation in the above example) only for this purpose. That's just overkill if I already have the values in local variables, and there is otherwise no need for such object. Here's a stupid "brute force" way to replace the {0} with the right value: String value = ... // contains the dynamic value to use
add(new Label("message", getString("msg").replaceAll("\\{0\\}", value)));
 Is there a clean, more Wicket-y way to do this (that isn't awfully much longer than the above)?
@CODE:WeatherStation ws = new WeatherStation();
add(new Label("weatherMessage", new StringResourceModel(
    "weather.${currentStatus}", this, new Model<String>(ws))); msg=Value is {0} String value = ... // contains the dynamic value to use
add(new Label("message", getString("msg").replaceAll("\\{0\\}", value)));

@TITLE:How can I expire all my sessions in Tomcat?
@CONTENT:I would like to expire all my sessions in Tomcat. We test our product under Fitnesse and some sessions remain and the end of the session causes dependency between the tests. I do it by hand with the following code, but some sessions remain (I can check it with the http://localhost:8080/manager/html/list url) public static void expireAllSessions() {
    String[] applications = { "a", "b", "c", "d",  "e" };
    for (String application : applications) {
        try {
            expireAllSessions(application);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            logger.error(e);
        }
    }
}

private static void expireAllSessions(final String application) throws Exception {
    // cf doc http://hc.apache.org/httpclient-3.x/authentication.html
    HttpClient client = new HttpClient();
    client.getParams().setAuthenticationPreemptive(true);
    Credentials userPassword = new UsernamePasswordCredentials("tomcat", "tomcat");
    client.getState().setCredentials(AuthScope.ANY, userPassword);

    String url = "http://localhost:8080/manager/html/expire";
    NameValuePair[] parametres = new NameValuePair[] {
            new NameValuePair("path", "/" + application),
            new NameValuePair("idle", "0")
    };
    HttpMethod method = new GetMethod(url);
    method.setQueryString(parametres);
    client.executeMethod(method);
}
 Is there a way to do it more efficiently and immediate with no remaining session ?
@CODE:public static void expireAllSessions() {
    String[] applications = { "a", "b", "c", "d",  "e" };

@CONTENT:I am using ASP.Net4 MVC2 for my application. The first person using the application usually experiences a long wait before the application responds. After that the application is pretty responsive. If the application is idle for 15 minutes, the same person or the next person using the application will experience long wait again. It looks like the application compiles after being idle for 15 minutes. Can someone tell me where I should look to trouble shoot the problem? Thanks.

@TITLE:C#: Adding context to Parallel.ForEach() in ASP.NET
@CONTENT:I have a static class with a static get property, and in this property, I do this: // property body
{
    // HttpContext.Current is NOT null
    ...

    Parallel.ForEach(files, file =>
    {
        // HttpContext.Current is null
        var promo = new Promotion();
        ...
    });
    ...

    // HttpContext.Current is NOT null
}
 This static class doesn't undergone type initialization until a view uses this property. The problem is that Promotion's static constructor, which is initialized the first time a new Promotion() is created within the Parallel.ForEach(), uses HttpContext.Current. When promo is instantiated within the scope of this Parallel.ForEach(), HttpContext.Current is null, and new Promotion() therefore causes an exception. HttpContext.Current is not null within the static get property because it's not called until the view uses it (and there is therefore a HttpContext.Current). If Promotion used HttpContext.Current in its instances instead of its static members, I could probably just pass HttpContext.Current into the new Promotion() constructor:  var context = HttpContext.Current;
 Parallel.ForEach(files, file =>
 {
     var promo = new Promotion(context);
 });
 But since static members of Promotion need HttpContext.Current, I can't. I could probably redesign the Promotion class to change the static members that need it to be instance members, but they are static for a reason--there would be a large performance penalty if all the members that were static had to be defined instead on each instance each time a new Promotion was instantiated. What are the possible workarounds for this? I didn't realize HttpContext.Current would be null within the scope of Parallel.ForEach().
@CODE:// property body

    // HttpContext.Current is NOT null

@TITLE:Why do RelayCommands typically use lazy initialization?
@CONTENT:When using Josh Smith's RelayCommand, most of the examples I've seen use lazy initialization such as: public class ViewModel
{
    private ICommand myCommand;

    public ICommand MyCommand
    {
        get
        {
            if (myCommand == null)

            return myCommand;
        }
    }
    // ... stuff ...

}
 Rather than creating the RelayCommand in the constructor, like this: public class ViewModel
{
    public ViewModel()

 What's the benefit of using lazy initialization here? It will have to call the get property when setting up the binding, so I can't seen a reason to use this method over settings things up in the constructor. Am I missing something here?
@CODE:public class ViewModel
{
    private ICommand myCommand;

    public ICommand MyCommand
    {
        get
        {
            if (myCommand == null)
            {
                myCommand = new RelayCommand(p => DoSomething() );
            }

            return myCommand;
        }
    }
    // ... stuff ...

} public class ViewModel
{
    public ViewModel()
    {
            MyCommand = new RelayCommand(p => DoSomething());
    }

@TITLE:Fastest integer type for common architectures
@CONTENT:The stdint.h header lacks an int_fastest_t and uint_fastest_t to correspond with the {,u}int_fastX_t types. For instances where the width of the integer type does not matter, how does one pick the integer type that allows processing the greatest quantity of bits with the least penalty to performance? For example, if one was searching for the first set bit in a buffer using a naive approach, a loop such as this might be considered: // return the bit offset of the first 1 bit
size_t find_first_bit_set(void const *const buf)
{
    uint_fastest_t const *p = buf; // use the fastest type for comparison to zero
    for (; *p == 0; ++p); // inc p while no bits are set
    // return offset of first bit set
    return (p - buf) * sizeof(*p) * CHAR_BIT + ffsX(*p) - 1;
}
 Naturally, using char would result in more operations than int. But long long might result in more expensive operations than the overhead of using int on a 32 bit system and so on. My current assumption is for the mainstream architectures, the use of long is the safest bet: It's 32 bit on 32 bit systems, and 64 bit on 64 bit systems.
@CODE:stdint.h int_fastest_t uint_fastest_t {,u}int_fastX_t // return the bit offset of the first 1 bit
size_t find_first_bit_set(void const *const buf)
{
    uint_fastest_t const *p = buf; // use the fastest type for comparison to zero
    for (; *p == 0; ++p); // inc p while no bits are set
    // return offset of first bit set

@TITLE:C# abstract class static field inheritance
@CONTENT:I feel like I skipped a C# class or two, but here's my dilemma: I have an abstract class from which I derive multiple child classes. I know for sure that for each of the child classes I will have a constructor that needs a certain static object as a model and this object will be different for each of the child classes. My first approach was to make a public static object in the abstract parent class and then, before I start creating any instances of the child classes, I would modify it for each of them, but it turns out that this way I actually make only ONE static object, for the abstract class, and each of it's child classes uses it. How could I solve the problem? To be more exact, here is the pseudocode: The parent abstract class:  abstract class AbstractClass
{
   static public ModelObject Model;
   ...
}
 One of the child classes: class Child : AbstractClass
{
    ...
    public Child()
    {
        this.someField = Model.someField;
    }
}
 EDIT: The Model needs to be a member of the "ModelObject" class, it should NOT be a singleton or anything else. EDIT2: To be even more exact, i chose this implementation for a game of chess: I have an abstract class for the chess pieces and the child classes represent the concrete pieces of the game: pawns, knights, et cetera. The abstract class inherits from MeshMatObject, a class that represents generic 3d objects with the basic functionality, like rotations, meshes, materials, textures and so on and it defines abstract methods for chess game pieces, like GetPossibleMoves(). The Model object I was talking about above is a member of the MeshMatObject and, in my opinion, should be defined outside the class just once and then used for all the pieces. I mean: for example all the pawns have the same mesh and texture, so I don't see the point of giving a model as a parameter every time you want to make a pawn.
@CODE:abstract class AbstractClass
{
   static public ModelObject Model;
   ...
} class Child : AbstractClass

Ideally, the algorithm should be lazy-evaluated, and not require caching more than one item from each sequence. This is not a terribly difficult problem to solve, and I¡¦ve been able to engineer a number of solutions in F#. Unfortunately, every solution I¡¦ve come up with has one of several problems. Recursive calls to subsequence generators using yield!. This produces elegant looking solutions, but the creation of a subsequence for every item is a performance killer. Really arcane and unmaintainable code with deeply-stacked match switches, multiple nearly identical blocks of code, etc. Code which forces F# into a purely procedural mode (lots of mutable values, etc.). And all of the online examples I've been able to find founder on the same shoals. Am I missing something obvious: like it's either really simple or else obviously impossible? Does anyone know of a really elegant solution that is also efficient and mostly functional? (It doesn¡¦t have to be purely functional.) If not, I may end up caching subsequences and using lists or arrays.

@TITLE:How to organize Android source code into folders
@CONTENT:I'm working on an Android app and it's up to 17 classes. I want to start organizing the .java class files into a more intuitive layout. Say I want to have a source code directory called "views". When I create that directory using Eclipse, it changes my package name to com.xyz to com.xyz.views. Since this package name (com.xyz.views) is different than the rest of my app (com.xyz) is this going to cause me to do a lot of extra work to link those packages? Will this cause problems with the fact that Android Market looks at the package name and is more or less locked to the package name?

@TITLE:Java JIT Compiler causing OutOfMemoryError
@CONTENT:An application that we have recently started sporadically crashing with a message about "java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: requested 8589934608 bytes for Chunk::new. Out of swap space?". I've looked around on the net, and everywhere suggestions are limited to revert to a previous version of Java fiddle with the memory settings use client instead of server mode Reverting to a previous version implies that the new Java has a bug, but I haven't seen any indication of that. The memory isn't an issue at all; the server has 32GB available, and Xmx is set to 20 while Xms is 10. I can't see the the JVM running out of the remaining 12GB (less the amount given to the handful of other processes on the machine). And we're stuck with server mode due to the nature of the application and environment. When I look at the memory and CPU usage for the application, I see constant memory usage for the whole day, but then suddenly right before it dies CPU usage goes up to 100% and the memory usage goes from X, to X + 2GB, to X + 4GB, to (sometimes) X + 8GB, to JVM death. It would appear that there is maybe cycle of repeated array resizing going on in the JIT compilation. I've now seen the error occur with the above 8GB request and also 16GB requests. All times, the method being compiled when this happens is the same. It is a simple method that has non-nested loops, no recursion, and uses methods on objects that return static member fields or instance member fields directly with little computation. So I have 2 questions: Does anybody have any suggestions? Can I test out whether there is a problem compiling this specific method on a test environment, without running the whole application, invoking the JIT compiler directly? Or should I start up the application and tell it to compile methods after a much smaller call count (like 2) to force it to compile the method almost instantly instead of at a random point in the day? @StephenC The JVM is 1.6.0_20 (previously 1.6.0_0), running on Solaris. I know it's the compilation that is causing a problem for a couple reasons. ps in the seconds leading up to it shows that a java thread with id corresponding to the compiler thread (from jstack) is taking up 100% of the CPU time jstack shows the issue is in JavaThread "CompilerThread1" daemon [_thread_in_native, id=34, ...] The method mentioned in jstack is always the same one, and is one we wrote. If you look at sample jstack output you will know what I mean, but for obvious reasons I can't provide code samples or filenames. I will say that it is a very simple method. Essentiall a handful of null checks, 2 for loops that do equality checks and possibly assign values, and some simple method calls after. All in all maybe 40 lines of code. This issue has happened 2 times in 2 weeks, though the application runs every day and is restarted daily. In addition, the application wasn't under heavy load any of these times.

 can we pass an array to this function by following syntax, under upcoming c++0x standards? : someFunction({1,2,3,4,5});

 Edit->after what people said: So you guys are telling that the expression between braces will be basically treated as an initializer_list and are proposing using an extra function that pulls a pointer out of that initializer_list and passes it to the intended function, but this method seems to me like a hack to be able to use my intended function with that expression as an argument, with that said I think I shouldn't use that expression as an argument at all, when my intended function parameter is a single pointer, or there might be another approach to use that expression? .

@CONTENT:I'm trying to connect various VBA projects to an Oracle 10g back end using ADO (2.8) and no TNS. After various attempts, we've decided that the simplest series of steps for a clean installation include: Set up an Oracle Instant Client Install the accompanying ODBC driver (Test the connection using EZCONNECT via SQL Plus) (Test the connection by creating a Windows DSN) Everything up to here works fine. Problem is, I cannot figure out the syntax to tell ADO to use the instant client ODBC driver, which appears in my ODBC driver list as "Oracle in MyTest" (no quotes). Using the MSFT ODBC driver with EZConnect as this post suggests does not work any better than it did prior to setting up the instant client (which is to say, not at all). But this post seems to suggest it's possible, without stating exactly how, and connectionstrings.com only tells you what the Data Source portion of the string looks like, i.e. SomeUser/SomePassword@AServer:PortNumber/InstanceName Short version: What is the exact syntax of a classic ADO connection string referencing an instant client ODBC driver? Thanks in advance for your help. Took me a stupid long time to get going with SO...

@TITLE:Most robust way to convert a CVS repository containing Eclipse projects to git?
@CONTENT:I have a situation where I have an elderly CVS repository which we would like to convert to git once and for all while keeping full history etc. All folders at the root of the repository contains Eclipse projects (either plain or dynamic web projects) including .classpath and .project. We use Team ProjectSets to check out the projects we need for a given task (where the project set is located in the project containing the main, and the rest are library projects). When the Team ProjectSet is checked out, the workspace is fully populated. This approach has worked pretty well for many years (except the project set part which came with 3.5), and we would like to work in a similar way with git if possible, but we are uncertain how. I've played somewhat with git cvs import but it failed - probably due to us not using modules. How would you suggest we do this, and how should we work with git to allow our current usage of shared library projects? Would we HAVE to introduce maven and create maven modules for our library projects? Or just ant ivy? EDIT: I've now managed to convert our CVS repository to Subversion with a suitable cvs2svn invocation and found that Eclipse recognizes the resulting Subversion repository nicely. Unfortunately after cloning http://github.com/iteman/svn2git` and trying to run bin/svn2git I get tra@Sandbox:~/cvsgit/svn2git/svn2git$ bin/svn2git

 This is with Ubuntu 10.04.1 LTS Server and I've tried various sudo things with Ruby and its gems without fully understanding what I did as I am not a Ruby programmer so I may have messed up things a bit. I'd appreciate advice - if the easiest is to install another Linux variant to do the conversion, that is fine. EDIT: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Git http://css.dzone.com/articles/subversion-git-morning Edit: My first try with the default svn2git completed successfully (after a while), and I get a nice repository where git branch -a reports roughly tra@Sandbox:~/gitroot/svnroot$ git branch -a

 We are interested in being able to check out the SV46 branch and work with it (we basically do not care about the tags, just actual branches). I have set up gitosis and pushed this repository to gitosis, and cloned it to another computer to find out how to do the "work with SV46" bit with Eclipse. THAT repository does not know of all the branches: tra@TRA ~/git/git00 (master)
$ git branch -a

 Do I need to massage the original result from svn2git to get the information into the gitosis repository? Do I need to clone with an argument? Should I redo the svn2git step with the suggested version instead of the one shipping with Ubuntu? EDIT: It turned out that publishing the svn2git generated repository with "git push --mirror" made things shown up in the gitosis repository. I now see the following inside gitosis (trimmed): tra@Sandbox:/srv/gitosis/repositories/git01.git$ git branch -a

 Trying to clone this repository with git clone gitosis@sandbox:git01 -b remotes/SV46 or git clone gitosis@sandbox:git01 -b SV46 both tell me that the remote branch is not found upstream origin, using HEAD instead. Am I barking up the wrong tree?

This has bothered me for some time, when I write a style for some HTML that would be similar to below: ...
<div id="outer">
    <span id="inner"></span>
    <span></span>
    ...
</div>
...
 Why would specificity rules make the selector "#outer span" more specific than "#inner"? ID's are unique, so when I say "#inner" I can ONLY be referring to one element, so why is it less specific? I understand the rules on determining specificity, I just wonder if this was intentional or accidental, also if anyone knows how I can ask this question to the people who write the css standards. I should note, I do understand that I COULD use #outer #inner to ensure maximum specificity, but that seems like it defeats the purpose of ID in the first place. This also is a problematic solution for when I write templates and I'm not sure that one ID will be inside of another. I'm not looking for a workaround, just a theory answer. My question is theory, entirely based on set logic. The though I have is that if you define a rule for 1 item of n possible items, isn't that as specific as you can go? Why would the creators of CSS selectors make a rule that could define m items of n possible items, where m is a subset of n as a more specific rule? My thought is that #id would be the equivalent of identifying 1 item by name, and #id elm would be identifying a group by its relation to an item by name. It's completely counter intuitive to call a named item less specific than an unnamed group with a named relation.

 and in my form email: <td><?php echo $form->input('email',array('class required email')); ?></td>
 The problem is jquery validate plugin works on the input fields attribute 'name' but cakephp names it as data[Student][email]. If I use this name in jquery its throwing an error. If I rename the field in cakephp the email value is not passed to the database. Is there any other round about way?

@TITLE:Performance of querying across two mysql databases on the same server?
@CONTENT:Is there any performance hit from querying over two (or more) databases on the same MySQL server, compared to if those databases had been merged into one? Background, I have inherited maintenance over a web application that splits its data into three different databases that runs on the same server, one for content, one for users and group information and one for user generated data. This is convenient, for example it makes it easy to set up permissions, the user data is somewhat sensitive so people who don't need to know should not have access to it. However, one of the main features of the application is providing progress reports for users or groups on the content. Which means that it has to query across two or more of the databases in order to generate the report. Is there any loss in performance doing it that way?

@CONTENT:I have a Java reader application that reads from a multicast socket on a Linux 64-bit platform (2.6.18). The socket size has been set to 2 MB. When the reader cannot read fast enough the socket "overflows", i.e. packets are dropped from the buffer. What I would like to know is how the Linux kernel drops packets out of the socket buffer. I assume that the socket buffer itself is a FIFO buffer. However, if it is full what happens? Will the next packet be discarded (and the buffer content does not change)? Or will the new packet replace an old packet in the buffer? If yes, which packet (the oldest?, the youngest?, a randomly chosen packet?)? Thanks for any insight.

@CONTENT:I am trying to send an URL-encoded post to a REST API implemented in PHP. The POST data contains two user-provided strings: WebRequest request = HttpWebRequest.Create(new Uri(serverUri, "rest"));
request.Method = "POST";
request.ContentType = "application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8";
request.Headers.Add("Content-Transfer-Encoding", "binary");

// Write the url-encoded post data into the request stream.
request.ContentLength = credentials.Length;
using (Stream requestStream = request.GetRequestStream()) {

 This sends a HTTP request to the server containing user=myusername&password=mypassword in UTF-8 as its POST data. How can I escape the user-provided strings? For example, if I had a user named big&mean, how should the ampersand be escaped so that it does not mess up the request line?

The work being threaded mostly executes in 50us but occasionally executes upwards of 500ms. The problem with cond_wait is two-fold. The mutex locking is taking comparable times to the micro second executions and I don't need locking. Second, I have many worker threads and I don't really want to make N condition variables when they need to be woken up. I know exactly which thread is waiting for which work and could just pthread_continue that thread. A thread knows when there is no more work and can easily pthread_suspend itself. This would use no locking, avoid the stampede, and be faster. Problem is....no pthread_suspend or _continue. Any ideas?

@CONTENT:Can anyone recommend a library - free, or commercial but affordable ( There are some listed here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming#Solvers_and_scripting_.28programming.29_languages ....but I am just starting out with LP and hope someone can recommend something. I am trying to basically minimize pricing for cell phone subscription services. I guess the 1st question is: is linear programming even applicable to solving this problem? A simplified example: Base Plan Options Plan A: 200 Voice minutes, 10 Text Messages, 10 MB Data = $25 Plan B: 400 Voice minutes, 25 Text Messages, 25 MB Data = $40 Plan C: 1000 Voice minutes, 50 Text Messages, 50 MB Data = $65 ... Plan F: 2500 Voice minutes, 150 Text Messages, 150 MB Data = $95 Charges for exceeding your plan (for all cases): $.10 per voice minute $.20 per text message $1.50 per MB Data Optional Add-On Packages (added to Base Plan): Free Weekends $15 Free Evenings and Weekends (after 8PM) $20 Free Evenings and Weekends (after 6PM) $35 Text Message Package #1 (50 Text Messages) $5 Text Message Package #2 (150 Text Messages) $10 Data Package #1 (20 MB Data) $20 Data Package #2 (50 MB Data) $30 Chatty User Mixed Pack #1 (100 Minutes Voice, 100 Text Messages) $15 Geeky User Mixed Pack #1 (50 Minutes Voice, 150 MB Data) $35 etc, etc etc I have a set of detailed usage data for 50 users, and want to figure out which combination of base plan (A, B, C ...

 java script to make selection by range var range = document.createRange();  // create range
var startPar = [the p node];         // starting parameter 
var endLi = [the second li node];    // ending parameter
range.setStart(startPar,13);         // distance from starting parameter.
range.setEnd(endLi,17);              // distance from ending parameter
range.select();                      // this statement will make selection
 I want to do this in invert way. I mean, assume that selection is done by user on browser (safari). My question is that How can we get starting node ( as we have 'the p node' here ) & ending node ( as we have 'the second li node' here ) and the range as well (as we have 13,17 here) ? Please help me. Thanks in advance for sharing your great knowledge. Sagar Edit : my efforts (From this question)     var sel = window.getSelection();

    if (sel.rangeCount < 1) {
        return;
    }
    var range = sel.getRangeAt(0);
    var startNode = range.startContainer, endNode = range.endContainer;

    // Split the start and end container text nodes, if necessary
    if (endNode.nodeType == 3) {
        endNode.splitText(range.endOffset);
        range.setEnd(endNode, endNode.length);

    if (startNode.nodeType == 3) {
        startNode = startNode.splitText(range.startOffset);
        range.setStart(startNode, 0);
    }
 But, yet I am confused about getting like, if selected is first paragraph or second or third, or selected is in first heading or second heading or what....

discoverableIntent.putExtra(BluetoothAdapter.EXTRA_DISCOVERABLE_DURATION, 300);
startActivity(discoverableIntent);
 This will make the device discoverable for 300 seconds (documentation). My question is: how to turn discoverability OFF before this timeout occurs? I'd like to replicate the corresponding setting in Settings|Wireless and networks|Bluetooth settings applet, that allows discoverability to be turned on and off with a click. Any help? Thanks ;)

@TITLE:Insertions into Zipper trees on XML files in Clojure
@CONTENT:I'm confused as how to idiomatically change a xml tree accessed through clojure.contrib's zip-filter.xml. Should be trying to do this at all, or is there a better way? Say that I have some dummy xml file "itemdb.xml" like this: <itemlist> 
  <item id="1">
    <name>John</name>
    <desc>Works near here.</desc>
  </item>
  <item id="2">
    <name>Sally</name>
    <desc>Owner of pet store.</desc>
  </item>
</itemlist>
 And I have some code: (require '[clojure.zip :as zip]
  '[clojure.contrib.duck-streams :as ds]
  '[clojure.contrib.lazy-xml :as lxml]
  '[clojure.contrib.zip-filter.xml :as zf]) 

(def db (ref (zip/xml-zip (lxml/parse-trim (java.io.File. "itemdb.xml")))))

;; Test that we can traverse and parse.
(doall (map #(print (format "%10s: %s\n"
       (apply str (zf/xml-> % :name zf/text))
       (apply str (zf/xml-> % :desc zf/text))))
     (zf/xml-> @db :item)))

;; I assume something like this is needed to make the xml tags
(defn create-item [name desc]
  {:tag :item
   :attrs {:id "3"}
   :contents
   (list {:tag :name :attrs {} :contents (list name)}
         {:tag :desc :attrs {} :contents (list desc)})})

(def fred-item (create-item "Fred" "Green-haired astrophysicist."))

;; This disturbs the structure somehow
(defn append-item [xmldb item]
  (zip/insert-right (-> xmldb zip/down zip/rightmost) item))

;; I want to do something more like this
(defn append-item2 [xmldb item]
  (zip/insert-right (zip/rightmost (zf/xml-> xmldb :item)) item))

(dosync (alter db append-item2 fred-item))

;; Save this simple xml file with some added stuff.
(ds/spit "appended-itemdb.xml"
    (with-out-str (lxml/emit (zip/root @db) :pad true)))
 I am unclear about how to use the clojure.zip functions appropriately in this case, and how that interacts with zip-filter. If you spot anything particularly weird in this small example, please point it out.

@LINK:/questions/2773628/better-ways-to-implement-a-modulo-operation-algorithm-question
@TITLE:Better ways to implement a modulo operation (algorithm question)
@CONTENT:I've been trying to implement a modular exponentiator recently. I'm writing the code in VHDL, but I'm looking for advice of a more algorithmic nature. The main component of the modular exponentiator is a modular multiplier which I also have to implement myself. I haven't had any problems with the multiplication algorithm- it's just adding and shifting and I've done a good job of figuring out what all of my variables mean so that I can multiply in a pretty reasonable amount of time. The problem that I'm having is with implementing the modulus operation in the multiplier. I know that performing repeated subtractions will work, but it will also be slow. I found out that I could shift the modulus to effectively subtract large multiples of the modulus but I think there might still be better ways to do this. The algorithm that I'm using works something like this (weird pseudocode follows): result,modulus : integer (n bits) (previously defined)
shiftcount : integer (initialized to zero)
while( (modulus<result) and  (modulus(n-1) != 1) ){
     modulus = modulus << 1
     shiftcount++
}
for(i=shiftcount;i>=0;i--){
     if(modulus<result){result = result-modulus}
     if(i!=0){modulus = modulus >> 1}
}
 So...is this a good algorithm, or at least a good place to start? Wikipedia doesn't really discuss algorithms for implementing the modulo operation, and whenever I try to search elsewhere I find really interesting but incredibly complicated (and often unrelated) research papers and publications. If there's an obvious way to implement this that I'm not seeing, I'd really appreciate some feedback.
@CODE:result,modulus : integer (n bits) (previously defined)
shiftcount : integer (initialized to zero)
while( (modulus<result) and  (modulus(n-1) != 1) ){
     modulus = modulus << 1
     shiftcount++
}
for(i=shiftcount;i>=0;i--){
     if(modulus<result){result = result-modulus}
     if(i!=0){modulus = modulus >> 1}
}

@TITLE:HTML - Correct way of coding a checkbox with a Label
@CONTENT:I've been using formtastic in order to generate HTML forms on rails applications. My question, however, is really HTML-related. Today I found a strange behaviour on the way formtastic generates checkboxes (fields of type :boolean on formtastic lingo). The rest of the fields (non-checkboxes) are generated this way: <li>
  <label for="my_textbox_field">My TextBox</label>
  <input id="my_textbox_field" type="text" ... >
</li>
 Checkboxes, however, are enclosed inside their <label> tags completely - like this: <li>
  <label for="my_boolean_field">
    <input id="my_boolean_field" type="checkbox" ... >
    This is my boolean field
  </label>
</li>
 Formtastic philosophy seems to be based on the Learning to Love Forms presentation. In effect, on slide 36 of that presentation this structure is suggested for checkboxes. I guess in the presentation itself the presenter explained why this was done, but it is not written on the slides. Can anyone tell me why enclosing checkboxes inside their <label> tag might be a good idea, as opposed to putting them outside, like with textboxes?

  <label for="my_textbox_field">My TextBox</label>

@TITLE:Django project models.py versus app models.py
@CONTENT:I am learning Django and I am trying to understand the use of models.py in the project versus the application. It seems from the tutorial examples that I include a model definition in the app, but when I went to apply that knowledge to my own existing database I got stuck. I took a database that I use (a copy of course) and generated the conceptual schema as a django model using inspectdb. I did this at the project level, and presumed then I could write apps using subschemas in the applications for that project. But generalizing the tutorial, they define the model in the application's model.py. If I did that, I would be repeating the model (or part of it) that's already at the project level, which seems like a mistake and a maintenance issue. So how, in Django style, do I use the project schema (or parts of it) without redefining it in the application's models.py? Thanks in advance.

@TITLE:Why can't the compiler/JVM just make autoboxing ¡§just work¡¨?
@CONTENT:Autoboxing is rather scary. While I fully understand the difference between == and .equals I can't but help have the follow bug the hell out of me:     final List<Integer> foo = Arrays.asList(1, 1000);
    final List<Integer> bar = Arrays.asList(1, 1000);
    System.out.println(foo.get(0) == bar.get(0));
    System.out.println(foo.get(1) == bar.get(1));
 That prints true
false
 Why did they do it this way? It something to do with cached Integers, but if that is the case why don't they just cache all Integers used by the program? Or why doesn't the JVM always auto unbox to primitive? Printing false false or true true would have been way better. EDIT I disagree about breakage of old code. By having foo.get(0) == bar.get(0) return true you already broke the code. Can't this be solved at the compiler level by replacing Integer with int in byte code (as long as it is never assigned null)
@CODE:== .equals final List<Integer> foo = Arrays.asList(1, 1000);
    final List<Integer> bar = Arrays.asList(1, 1000);

@TITLE:Hibernate: ordering a Set
@CONTENT:I have a class Person who has a set of Books. It is not meaningful in the particular case to have an ordered or sorted collection. Say now that I have a search page with a table showing the join of Person and Book. I want to be able to sort the results by fields from both Person AND Book, and then get a List from Hibernate, and iterate over it. Because the collection is a Set, the ordering of the Books has vanished (PersistentSet of Hibernate wraps a HashSet of Books, which is not ordered). So, with this approach I cannot have results also ordered by Book fields. If I change the collection from Set to List, my model is semantically incorrect. There is no meaning for keeping order in the model. Is there an approach to keep the ordering of Books? Perhaps there is a way for the PersistentSet to wrap a LinkedHashSet (which is ordered), where the order is defined by my search Criteria? Cheers!

@CONTENT:As a learning exercise I'm writing myself a simple extension / plugin / macro framework using IronPython - I've gotten the basics working but I'd like to add some basic debugging support to make my script editor easier to work with. I've been hunting around on the internet a bit and I've found a couple of good resources on writing managed debuggers (including Mike Stall's excellent .Net Debugging blog and the MSDN documentaiton on the CLR Debugging API) - I understand that IronPython is essentially IL however apart from that I'm a tad lost on how to get started, in particular: Are there any significant differences between debugging a dynamic language (such as IronPython) to a static one (such as C#)? Do I need to execute my script in a special way to get IronPython to output suitable debugging information? Is debugging a script running inside the current process going to cause deadlocks, or does IronPython execute my script in a child process? Am I better off looking into how to produce a simple C# debugger first to get the general idea? (I'm not interested in the GUI aspect of making a debugger for now - I've already got a pretty good idea of how this might work)

@TITLE:Validating against a Schema with JAXB
@CONTENT:I've been looking for solutions to this problem for far too long considering how easy it sounds so I've come for some help. I have an XML Schema which I have used with xjc to create my JAXB binding. This works fine when the XML is well formed. Unfortunately it also doesn't complain when the XML is not well formed. I cannot figure out how to do proper full validation against the schema when I try to unmarshall an XML file. I have managed to use a ValidationEventCollector to handle events, which works for XML parsing errors such as mismatched tags but doesn't raise any events when there is a tag that is required but is completely absent. From what I have seen validation can be done againsta schema, but you must know the path to the schema in order to pass it into the setSchema() method. The problem I have is that the path to the schema is stored in the XML header and I can't knwo at run time where the schema is going to be. Which is why it's stored in the XML file: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<DDSSettings xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="/a/big/long/path/to/a/schema/file/DDSSettings.xsd">
<Field1>1</Field1>
<Field2>-1</Field2>
 ...etc Every example I see uses setValidating(true), which is now deprecated, so throws an exception. This is the Java code I have so far, which seems to only do XML validation, not schema validation: try {
    JAXBContext jc = new JAXBContext() {
        private final JAXBContext jaxbContext = JAXBContext.newInstance("blah");

        @Override
        public Unmarshaller createUnmarshaller() throws JAXBException {
            Unmarshaller unmarshaller = jaxbContext.createUnmarshaller();
            ValidationEventCollector vec = new ValidationEventCollector() {
                @Override

@TITLE:How to pass SOAP headers into python SUDS that are not defined in WSDL file
@CONTENT:I have a camera on my network which I am trying to connect to with suds but suds doesn't send all the information needed. I need to put extra soap headers not defined in the WSDL file so the camera can understand the message. All the headers are contained in a SOAP envelope and then the suds command should be in the body of the message. I have checked the suds website and it says to pass in the headers like so: (This passes in the element as a header but I have an envelope so I'm not sure how to input this) from suds.sax.element import Element
client = client(url)
ssnns = ('ssn', 'http://namespaces/sessionid')
ssn = Element('SessionID', ns=ssnns).setText('123')
client.set_options(soapheaders=ssn) 
result = client.service.addPerson(person)
 Now, I am not sure how I would implement this. Say for example, I have the below header: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV="http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope" xmlns:SOAP
ENC="http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-encoding"
<wsa:MessageID SOAP-ENV:mustUnderstand="true">urn:uuid:43268c01-f09c6</wsa:MessageID>
 <SOAP-ENV:Header>
 Using this or a similar example does anyone know how I would pass a valid SOAP message to the targeted service? Thanks

client = client(url)
ssnns = ('ssn', 'http://namespaces/sessionid')

@CONTENT:I need to check in Java if a word consists of unique letters (case insensitive). As straight solution is boring, I came up with: For every char in a string check if indexOf(char) == lastIndexOf(char). Add all chars to HashSet and check if set size == string length. Convert a string to a char array, sort it alphabetically, loop through array elements and check if c[i] == c[i+1]. Currently I like #2 the most, seems like the easiest way.

@TITLE:Testing for a closed socket
@CONTENT:I'm trying to test for a closed socket that has been gracefully closed by the peer without incurring the latency hit of a double send to induce a SIGPIPE. One of the assumptions here is that the socket if closed was gracefully closed by the peer immediately after it's last write / send. Actual errors like a premature close are dealt with else where in the code. If the socket is still open, there will be 0 or more bytes data which I don't actually want to pull out of the socket buffer yet. I was thinking that I could call int ret = recv(sockfd, buf, 1, MSG_DONTWAIT | MSG_PEEK); to determine if the socket is still connected. If it's connected but there's no data in the buffer I'll get a return of -1 with errno == EAGAIN and return the sockfd for reuse. If it's been gracefully closed by the peer I'll get ret == 0 and open a new connection. I've tested this and it seems to work. However, I suspect there is a small window between when I recv the last bit of my data and when the peer FIN arrives in which I could get a false-positive EAGAIN from my test recv. Is this going to bite me, or is there a better way of doing this?
@CODE:SIGPIPE int ret = recv(sockfd, buf, 1, MSG_DONTWAIT | MSG_PEEK); -1 errno == EAGAIN ret == 0 FIN EAGAIN recv

@TITLE:jQuery Validation Plugin: Invoke errorPlacement function when onfocusout, keyup and click
@CONTENT:I am using the jquery validation plugin and want to use the errorPlacement function to add error messages to the fields title attribute and display just a ? next to the field. This works great when the form is submitted with the submit button but when any of the following events are triggered: - onfocusout - click - onkeyup The validation checks are run but it skips the errorPlacement function and adds the full error message after the field, like the default behaviour.

@CONTENT:I have multiple radio buttons which I want to layout using a table but also include them in a single radio group. I have the following xml layout: <RadioGroup android:layout_width="fill_parent"

        </TableRow>
      </TableLayout>
</RadioGroup>  
 But unfortunately the radio buttons inside the table seem to ignore the fact that they're inside of the RadioGroup tags and because of this you can select more than one radio button at the time. I noticed that by removing the table and just having the radio buttons it works just fine. How can I overcome this? Would it be as simple as declaring the radio group inside of the table instead of outside? Thanks for any help.

@TITLE:Setting TCP receive window in C and working with tcpdump in Linux
@CONTENT:I am running a Linux box running 2.6.9-55.ELsmp, x86_64. I am trying to set the TCP receive window by using the setsockopt() function using C. I try the following: rwnd = 1024;
setsockopt(sock, SOL_SOCKET, SO_RCVBUF, (char *)&rwnd, sizeof(rwnd));
 The code segment above is in a client program that receives data from a server. When I kick off the program to receive and observe tcpdump output, I observe window negotiation like so: 11:34:40.257755 IP clientReceiver.42464 > serverSender.8991: 
S 1742042788:1742042788(0) win 5840 
<mss 1460,sackOK,timestamp 1688222886 0,nop,wscale 2>
 We see that the client program is in fact negotiating a window different from what I have set in the client program. However, from how I can interpret Steven's text ("TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1") Section 20.4, I believe you effect what he refers to in the second block quote in Section 20.4 using the setsockopt() call I use (see above). I'd like to understand where I have gone wrong. Perhaps my interpretation of what Stevens is saying is incorrect. In that case, could you point me to the correct way of setting the receive buffer size? As a proof of my confusion, I refer the Linux TCP sockets man page at http://linux.die.net/man/7/tcp (see comment on SO_RCFBUF). What am I missing in this story? How do I control the receive buffer size (and have it show in the tcpdump output)? Please note that I allude to here a setting of the socket option SO_RCFBUF--I understand that's what shows up in the window negotiation in the SYN. Any input is appreciated.
@CODE:rwnd = 1024;

@TITLE:Enumerable.Sum() overflowing
@CONTENT:Hey, I'm using the Enumerable.Sum() extension method from LINQ to compute hash codes, and am having a problem with OverflowExceptions when the code gets big. I tried putting the call in an unchecked block, but that didn't seem to help. The MSDN documentation for the method says it will throw if the value gets too big, but I checked in reflector and this is all there is: public static int Sum(this IEnumerable<int> source) {
    if (source == null) {
        throw Error.ArgumentNull("source");
    }
    int num = 0;
    foreach (int num2 in source) {
        num += num2;
    }

 Based on this decompilation, I would expect it to either overflow or not depending on the context of the calling code. Why is it overflowing, and how can I get it to stop?

@LINK:/questions/2207881/using-a-java-socket-from-jni-c-code
@TITLE:Using a java socket from JNI / C++ code
@CONTENT:I have a java app that creates a socket to talk to a server process, eg new java.net.Socket(String host, int port). This app includes a bunch of legacy c++ code that needs to suck gobs of data from that server and process it. This is currently implemented by having the native code create its own socket and connect to the server, eg: sock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
struct hostent* hp = gethostbyname(host);
if (!hp)
{
  unsigned long addr = inet_addr(host);
  hp = gethostbyaddr((char *)&addr, sizeof(addr), AF_INET);
}

struct sockaddr_in name;
name.sin_family = AF_INET;
memcpy(&name.sin_addr, hp->h_addr, hp->h_length);
name.sin_port = htons(port);

connect(sock, (sockaddr*)&name, sizeof(name));
 On Windows vista/7 machines with multiple NICs (eg wired and wifi or vpn connections), these two sockets can end up with different local addresses. The java code appears to choose a "better" interface (the wired Gb enet = higher MTU?), the native (naive?) code gets the "default" interface (stick in a usb wifi device and it becomes your default - yuck). This causes some problems for me, I don't think the details are relevant. Two questions: Is is possible for me to re-use the java socket from the JNI code (portably? assume Sun JDK). This would avoid the issue completely, but so far I don't see any way to interact with the java.net.Socket stuff from JNI/native code. Since the answer to the first question is probably NO, how is java creating that socket (choosing the interface) ? Code snippets welcomed. I have looked around in the openjdk stuff and haven't found what I am looking for. Thanks, Chris

Same DPR, same code base, same everything, but the compiler's somehow running over about 40% more lines of code in the build cycle and nobody here knows why. Just to make things more confusing, after building, we can go to Project -> Information in the IDE and it reports 3.8M lines. In D2007, the compiler dialog and the Project -> Information dialog reported the same number. Anyone have any idea what's going on here?

@TITLE:Is a return value of 0 from write(2) in C an error?
@CONTENT:In the man page for the system call write(2) - ssize_t write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t count); it says the following: Return Value On success, the number of bytes written are returned (zero indicates nothing was written). On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately. If count is zero and the file descriptor refers to a regular file, 0 may be returned, or an error could be detected. For a special file, the results are not portable. I would interpret this to mean that returning 0 simply means that nothing was written, for whatever arbitrary reason. However, Stevens in UNP treats a return value of 0 as a fatal error when dealing with a file descriptor that is a TCP socket ( this is wrapped by another function which calls exit(1) on a short count ): ssize_t /* Write "n" bytes to a descriptor. */
writen(int fd, const void *vptr, size_t n)
{
    size_t      nleft;
    ssize_t     nwritten;
    const char  *ptr;

    ptr = vptr;
    nleft = n;
    while (nleft > 0) {
        if ( (nwritten = write(fd, ptr, nleft)) <= 0) {
            if (nwritten < 0 && errno == EINTR)
                nwritten = 0;       /* and call write() again */
            else
                return(-1);         /* error */
        }

        nleft -= nwritten;
        ptr   += nwritten;
    }
    return(n);
}
 He only treats 0 as a legit return value if the errno indicates that the call to write was interrupted by the process receiving a signal. Why?
@CODE:ssize_t write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t count); errno exit(1) ssize_t /* Write "n" bytes to a descriptor. */

 I am not quite sure why it isn't working, i've read about using a proxy, but I am not quite sure how i would use it in this case? Isn't the point of using SOAP and WSDL to avoid using CURL, Direct Connect type stuff?

@TITLE:Vim Python indentation not working?
@CONTENT:I have Vim 7 (enhanced) on CentOS 5, and it comes with all the usual Vim plugins/scripts ready to go. $ find /usr/share/vim/vim70/ -name \*python\*

 I would think that when opening a file ending in .py (vim file.py) it would automatically load these plugins, but I am not sure that is the case. What I want is: Press TAB and receive four spaces. Auto indent next line for suites, conditionals, etc. I have this working by explicitly setting tabstop, shiftwidth, etc. in my .vimrc file. Isn't this what the above Python files are for? Why do I have to set these things in my .vimrc? How do I get these features from the Vim plugins instead? Current .vimrc: syntax on

@TITLE:Tool for braceless, whitespace sensitive C syntax
@CONTENT:I'm writing some C at the moment and because I like whitespace sensitive syntax, I'd like to write it like this: #include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
  printf("Hello, world!")
  return 0
 Instead of this: #include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  printf("Hello, world!");
  return 0; 
}
 Does anybody know of a tool that will convert the former into the latter? Edit: I've really no interest in arguing with those that think this is a bad idea. By all means continue to think that, you have your reasons. But at least know this: I'm aware Python is a whitespace sensitive language but I have not used it. Why would I? I know Ruby already. Also know: I am not just learning C for the first time and I have used PHP and JavaScript for more than four years, so I am not requesting this out of some personal difficulty, lack of familiarity with block syntax, or dogmatic affiliation. I am also aware of what would be involved in writing one of these and that's not beyond my ability but I don't want this enough to justify spending the time writing one.
@CODE:#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
  printf("Hello, world!")
  return 0 #include <stdio.h>

@TITLE:How to support Multi-Languages approach in DataBase Schema?
@CONTENT:I want my database to support multi Languages for all text values in its tables. So what is the best approach to do that?. Edit1:: E.G. I've this "Person" table: ID int
FirstName  nvarchar(20)
LastName   nvarchar(20)
Notes      nvarchar(max)
BirthDate  date
...........
 So if i want my program to support new language "let say French". should i add new column every time i add new language ? So my "Person" table will look like this ID int
FirstName_en  nvarchar(20)
FirstName_fr  nvarchar(20)
LastName_en   nvarchar(20)
LastName_fr   nvarchar(20)
Notes_en      nvarchar(max)
Notes_fr      nvarchar(max)
BirthDate     date
...........
 Or should i add 2 new tables one for languages and other for "Person_Languages" values ? So this will look like : " Languages " table: ID           int
Lang-symbol  nvarchar(4)
 " Person " Table: ID         int
BirthDate  Date
 and finally " *Person_Translation* " table: LangID        int
PersonID      int
Translation   nvarchar(max)
 Or there is something better ?? .

@CONTENT:What is the best way to present the additional spacing that should come between sentences (using [X]HTML+CSS)? <p>Lorem ipsum.  Dolor sit amet.</p>
               ^^ wider than word spacing
 Since HTML and XML both require whitespace folding, the above two spaces must behave as a single space. What options are there?? There are a few obvious ones below, what others exist?? (Anything in CSS3?)? What drawbacks, if any, exist for the these, including across different browsers?? (How do the non-breaking spaces below interact with line wrapping?) ..ipsum. &nbsp;Dolor.. ..ipsum.&nbsp; Dolor.. ..ipsum.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dolor.. There's a lot of FUD on the net which claims this was invented for typewriters, but you can see it in documents such as the U.S. Declaration of Independence.? (And yes, I realize you shouldn't follow all the conventions from over two hundred years ago, the DoI is merely a handy example showing this predates typewriters and monospaced fonts.)? Or a typographer claiming that the additional space is distracting¡Xafter changing the background color so the example cannot be anything else! To put it bluntly, while I appreciate opinions and discussion on whether additional spacing should be used or not (which isn't programming related), that is not what I'm asking. Assume this a requirement, what is the best way to implement it?

@TITLE:PHP produces a completely white page, no errors, logs, or headers.
@CONTENT:While running some PHP code on my private WAMP PC I'm suddenly getting a blank response from the server - no response actually. No headers, no data, nothing in the PHP error logs, nada. I restarted APACHE and PHP but still nothing. I know php is working because I can access other PHP scripts just fine. Firebug reports no headers, ? bytes, and it only takes 163ms to "load" (so it's not a timeout). I thought about rapid memory consumption - but I monitored my PC's memory and it's not showing any spikes. Errors and Exceptions have been working fine until now. What in the world? max_execution_time = 30 ;

 :EDIT: I wouldn't touch @ with a ten-foot-pole. I think the ruby guys throw that in there so programmers would drop PHP. Anyway, I enabled xdebug and it didn't output any grind files. Then I took zombat's advice and placed a DIE() at the top of the page and it worked. I guess that I just have some very weird code that totally kills PHP. Even if errors were disabled or suppressed with @ I should still be getting back a header from the server with the empty content! If I find more I'll post back.

@TITLE:Python many-to-one mapping (creating equivalence classes)
@CONTENT:I have a project of converting one database to another. One of the original database columns defines the row's category. This column should be mapped to a new category in the new database. For example, let's assume the original categories are:parrot, spam, cheese_shop, Cleese, Gilliam, Palin Now that's a little verbose for me, And I want to have these rows categorized as sketch, actor - That is, define all the sketches and all the actors as two equivalence classes. >>> monty={'parrot':'sketch', 'spam':'sketch', 'cheese_shop':'sketch', 
'Cleese':'actor', 'Gilliam':'actor', 'Palin':'actor'}
>>> monty
{'Gilliam': 'actor', 'Cleese': 'actor', 'parrot': 'sketch', 'spam': 'sketch', 
'Palin': 'actor', 'cheese_shop': 'sketch'}
 That's quite awkward- I would prefer having something like: monty={ ('parrot','spam','cheese_shop'): 'sketch', 
        ('Cleese', 'Gilliam', 'Palin') : 'actors'}
 But this, of course, sets the entire tuple as a key: >>> monty['parrot']

Traceback (most recent call last):

KeyError: 'parrot'

Among useful patches was the request to change the famous do { ... } while(0) macro to do { ... } while(0,0).

@CONTENT:In answer to a previous question, several people suggested that I use BeautifulSoup for my project. I've been struggling with their documentation and I just cannot parse it. Can somebody point me to the section where I should be able to translate this expression to a BeautifulSoup expression? hxs.select('//td[@class="altRow"][2]/a/@href').re('/.a\w+')
 The above expression is from Scrapy. I'm trying to apply the regex re('\.a\w+') to td class altRow to get the links from there. I would also appreciate pointers to any other tutorials or documentation. I couldn't find any. Thanks for your help. Edit: I am looking at this page: >>> soup.head.title
<title>White & Case LLP - Lawyers</title>
>>> soup.find(href=re.compile("/cabel"))
>>> soup.find(href=re.compile("/diversity"))
<a href="/diversity/committee">Committee</a>
 Yet, if you look at the page source "/cabel" is there:  <td class="altRow" valign="middle" width="34%"> 
 <a href='/cabel'>Abel, Christian</a>
 For some reason, search results are not visible to BeautifulSoup, but they are visible to XPath because hxs.select('//td[@class="altRow"][2]/a/@href').re('/.a\w+') catches "/cabel" Edit: cobbal: It is still not working. But when I search this: >>>soup.findAll(href=re.compile(r'/.a\w+'))

 it returns all the links with second character "a" but not the lawyer names. So for some reason those links (such as "/cabel") are not visible to BeautifulSoup. I don't understand why.

This is my first time on this site, so I didn't have enough rep to comment I guess. I decided to just make a new question referencing the one I wanted to comment on. What is the process of selecting a core to move a thread to. Is it like the scheduler has a list of threads that need processing time and as one finishes it puts another one in? Also I was wondering if there is a reference for the statement that threads are moved between cores at all. Or is it just considered "common knowlege"? Thanks!

@TITLE:Copy and paste from external source
@CONTENT:I use vim (Actually gvim on windows) as my main text editor. In my work flow I have to copy sentences to/from various external sources, therefore I use clipboard=unnamed to save me key strokes (p instead of "*p). I copy text from an outer source and I want to paste it over two different places in vim. I mark the first one (v) and then use p to paste over it. The problem is that at this point I lose the original buffer and can't paste it in the second place. It does not exist in the unnamed buffer, the * buffer or the numbered buffers. My guess is that pasting over selection is putting the "pasted over" text in the unnamed buffer. How can I paste my original string in two locations? i.e. prevent it from getting lost from the buffers. Thanks.

@CONTENT:I am trying to build lite version of my iPhone application using AdMob. I followed the guidelines here http://www.iphonedevsdk.com/forum/iphone-sdk-development/11358-creating-lite-version-app.html and created two different targets. In the lite version I added a macro called LITEVERSION which I am checking using #ifdef and doing the appropriate things. But when I build the lite version of the app, I get a linker error ld: library not found for -lAdMobDevice collect2: ld returned 1 exit status However I am able to build the full version without any issues and also noticed that build is working fine (for the fullversion) even if I remove the #ifdef macros. This suggests that the libAdMobSimulator.a library is linking properly for the full version however it fails on the lite version. Any pointers would be greatly appreciated! Cheers Jugs

 In my table i've got around 50 rows, i'm only concerned with two fields, omId (int primary key) and omText (my xml data). What i'm trying to achieve is a way of saying, across all xml data in the whole table... give me all of the xmlElements where the title is X. Or give me a count of all items that use an imageId of 55. I'm using the XML data type VALUE and QUERY functions to retrieve the data.    select omID,
   omText.query('/things/Fruit')
   ,cast('<results>' + cast(omText.query('/things/Fruit') as varchar(max)) + '</results>' as xml) as Value
   from dbo.myTable
   where omText.value('(/things/Fruit/imageId)[1]', 'int') = 76
 Which only works where the id i'm searching for is the first one in the document. It doesn't seem to search all of the xml. Fundamentally the resultset comes back with one row for each entry in the TABLE, wheras i think i need to have one row for each matched ELEMENT... Not exactly sure how to start writing a group-by for this tho. I'm starting to feel like i'm making this harder than it needs to be...... thoughts & ideas please.

@CONTENT:I was considering what would it take (technologically) to move all the web traffic to HTTPS. I thought that computers are getting faster, and faster, so some time from now it will be possible to run all traffic via HTTPS without any noticeable cost. But then again, I thought, encryption strength will have to evolve to counter the loss of security. If computers get 10x faster, encryption will have to be 10x stronger, or it will be 10x easier to break. So, will we ever be able to encrypt all web traffic "for free"? Edit: I'm asking only about the logic of performance increases in computing vs encryption. If we can use the same crypto algorhytms and keys in 20 years, they will consume a far lower percentage of the overall computing capacity of a server (or client), and in effect, that will make it "free" to encrypt and sign everything that we transmit over networks.

@CONTENT:I'm working on a system to use a SqlServerCe with NHibernate. From my driver program, if I add the System.Data.SqlServerCe assembly as a reference, I can create and run queries against a database just fine. When trying to use NHibernate, though, I get the following exception: A first chance exception of type 'System.IO.FileNotFoundException' occurred in mscorlib.dll Additional information: Could not load file or assembly 'System.Data.SqlServerCe' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified. I've traced the exception to a call to Assembly.Load("System.Data.SqlServerCe"), which seems like it should work. The System.Data.SqlServerCe assembly is in the GAC (I've also tried to add it as a local reference with CopyLocal=true, to no avail), and I can use its members fine, so why can't I explicitly load it? When I open the assembly in Reflector, it has trouble loading the System.Transactions reference (I've also tried adding it as a local reference, again to no avail), so loading that assembly might be the problem, rather than the System.Data.SqlServerCe assembly. Is this a common problem? System misconfiguration, maybe?

        ...

</div>
 The only solution I can think about with my week of experience in ASP.Net MVC and AJAX is to put the div outside the partial view and make the partial view only contain the inside part, but then the form would refer to an id outside the view where the form is located breaking the little encapsulation I have left there. Is there any better solution?

@TITLE:Are the first 32 bits of an md5 hash just as ¡§random¡¨ as any other substring?
@CONTENT:I'm looking to create a 32-bit hash of some data objects. Since I don't feel like writing my own hash function and md5 is available, my current approach is to use the first 32 bits (i.e. first 8 hex digits) from an md5 hash. Is this acceptable? In other words, are the first 32 bits of an md5 hash just as "random" as any other substring? Or is there any reason I'd prefer, say, the last 32 bits? or perhaps XOR'ing the four 32-bit substrings together? Some preemptive clarifications: These hashes don't need to be cryptographically secure. I'm not concerned with the performance of md5--it is more than fast enough for my needs. These hashes just need to be "random" enough that collisions are rare. In this system, the number of items shouldn't exceed 10,000 (realistically it's probably not going to get half that high). So in the worst case the probability of encountering any collisions at all should be about 1% (assuming a sufficiently "random" hash is found).

@TITLE:Is Inversion of Control specific to OO languages?
@CONTENT:Another way to ask this question is: what is Inversion of Control according to you? I ask this question because the Wikipedia article on IoC has been hijacked by a non-OO explanation. This is taken from the discussion page and is from 2007: I took the liberty to completely rewrite the page, as the previous content was completely taken over by meaningless "object oriented" babble ... I don't see how Inversion of Control makes any sense outside of OO language. There are already many explanations for giving up control in procedural languages (event programming is one) and purely functional languages don't need a concept like Inversion of Control since they have higher-order functions. Also, in the article where Martin Fowler elaborates on IoC he exclusively handles OO examples. So, is IoC exclusively an OO concept, and what is it exactly? To me, IoC tries to turn functions into data within the limitations that most OO languages impose, and tries to pass those functions-as-data as arguments to other functions. That's not the only part of IoC, but there's some of that. There's also the factory design pattern, where trees of objects are being constructed and configured before being passed on. To me, IoC is exclusively an OO concept. What's your answer?

@CONTENT:I can't seem to get rid of these seemingly random compiles errors in one of my classes. I get about 4 errors such as: multiple definition of `draw_line(float, float, float, float)'
 and multiple definition of `near_far_clip(float, float, float*, float*, float*, float*, float*, float*)'
 that are flagged in the middle of the method. I also consistently get multiple definition of `stack' in the middle of another method. stack is a global variable in a totally different file. It isn't even mentioned in the file I'm getting the error in. I tried separating the error prone file into .h and .cpp files (was originally just a .cpp) and nothing about the error changed... I don't have duplicate methods. I only have one #include of lines.h and there is an #ifndef clause at the beginning. All these errors appear in the .cpp file. Any ideas what it could be? Alright, I got the code up: lines.cpp ThreeD.cpp ThreeD.h makefile The lines.cpp is a converted .c file I received from my instructor. I included the makefile just in case, because I always have problems with it. I also annotated exactly where the errors were flagged in the file, but they seem pretty random so I don't know if it's particularly important. I abandoned the .h file because it wasn't solving anything or helping. I believe it will be easier to find the mistake without it. Here is the requested main.cpp file (there is no .h). I remade the lines.h file due to and I'm still receiving the: multiple definition of `draw_line(float, float, float, float)'
 and multiple definition of `near_far_clip(float, float, float*, float*, float*, float*, float*, float*)'
 errors in the lines.cpp file, but the multiple definition of `stack' error is now in a random place in the ThreeD.cpp file (and is marked by a comment now). Update: This error has been fixed and the files have been revised to show this: lines.h lines.cpp ThreeD.cpp ThreeD.h I messed around with labeling some the global variables extern, but it didn't seem to affect anything.

@CONTENT:I'm a little surprised that there isn't some information on this on the web, and I keep finding that the problem is a little stickier than I thought. Here's the rules: You are starting with delimited/escaped data to split into an array. The delimiter is one arbitrary character The escape character is one arbitrary character Both the delimiter and the escape character could occur in data Regex is fine, but a good-performance solution is best Edit: Empty elements (including leading or ending delimiters) can be ignored The code signature (in C# would be, basically) public static string[] smartSplit(

@TITLE:IDisposable GC.SuppressFinalize(this) location
@CONTENT:I use a default IDisposable implementation template (pattern) for my code. snippet: public void Dispose()
{
    Dispose(true);

    GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
}

protected virtual void Dispose(bool isDisposing)
{
    if (!this.disposed)
    {
        if (isDisposing)
        {
            //cleanup managed resources
        }

        //cleanup unmanaged resources

        this.disposed = true;
    }
}
 My question: why is the call "GC.SuppressFinalize(this)" in the Dispose public method? I would place "GC.SuppressFinalize(this)" in the "if (isDisposing)" section of the protected method, after disposing managed resources. Like this: protected virtual void Dispose(bool isDisposing)
{
    if (!this.disposed)
    {
       if (isDisposing)
       {
           //cleanup managed resources

           GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
       }

       //cleanup unmanaged resources

       this.disposed = true;
    }
}
@CODE:public void Dispose()
{
    Dispose(true);

    GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
}

protected virtual void Dispose(bool isDisposing)
{
    if (!this.disposed)
    {
        if (isDisposing)
        {
            //cleanup managed resources
        }

        //cleanup unmanaged resources

        this.disposed = true;
    }
} protected virtual void Dispose(bool isDisposing)
{
    if (!this.disposed)
    {
       if (isDisposing)
       {
           //cleanup managed resources

           GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
       }

       //cleanup unmanaged resources

       this.disposed = true;
    }
}

@CONTENT:I'm interested in learning about tools that operate like this: Given a database schema and some data, suggest whether the schema is likely structured in any particular normal form, and then tell how the schema might be factored to produce further normalization. Basically, a static analysis tool for database schema design. Like other static analysis tools, such a database tool need not generate perfect results (I doubt such a "perfect" tool is computationally feasible), or applicable to all database systems, or free/open source, or anything else. The tool need not be stand-alone; it could be bundled as some sophisticated IDE feature. I'm just wondering what's out there.

@CONTENT:I recently implemented a class like: class TestClass : IDisposable

 If I uncomment the direct call to Dispose, I get error CS0117 ("'Microsoft.Win32.RegistryKey' does not contain a definition for 'Dispose'"). Some Googling led me to this thread, where I learned what was going on, so I now understand the mechanics of it. The MSDN documentation suggests that the author would prefer that I call Close() instead of Dispose(), but doesn't explain why. What is the purpose of this pattern (which I think I've seen it in the IO classes as well)? In light of the fact that this was an intentional decision by the class author, how bad is the code above (the call to Dispose through the IDisposable interface)? It can't be too bad - after all, it's what would happen in a using statement, right?

@LINK:/questions/314580/how-do-i-perform-a-unit-test-using-threads
@TITLE:How do I perform a Unit Test using threads?
@CONTENT:Executive Summary: When assertion errors are thrown in the threads, the unit test doesn't die. This makes sense, since one thread shouldn't be allowed to crash another thread. The question is how do I either 1) make the whole test fail when the first of the helper threads crashes or 2) loop through and determine the state of each thread after they have all completed (see code below). One way of doing the latter is by having a per thread status variable, e.g., "boolean[] statuses" and have "statuses[i] == false" mean that the thread failed (this could be extended to capture more information). However, that is not what I want: I want it to fail just like any other unit test when the assertion errors are thrown. Is this even possible? Is it desirable? I got bored and I decided to spawn a bunch of threads in my unit test and then have them call a service method, just for the heck of it. The code looks approximately like: Thread[] threads = new Thread[MAX_THREADS];
for( int i = 0; i < threads.length; i++ ) {
    threads[i] = new Thread( new Runnable() {
        private final int ID = threadIdSequenceNumber++;
        public void run() {
            try {
                resultRefs[ID] = runTest( Integer.toString( ID ) ); // returns an object
            }
            catch( Throwable t ) { 
                // this code is EVIL - it catches even
                // Errors - don't copy it - more on this below
                final String message = "error testing thread with id => "
                            + ID;
                logger.debug( message, t );
                throw new IllegalStateException( message, t ); 
                // need to wrap throwable in a 
                // run time exception so it will compile
            }
        }
    } );
}
 After this, we will loop through the array of threads and start each one. After that we will wait for them all to finish. Finally, we will perform some checks on the result references. for( Thread thread : threads )
    thread.start();

logger.debug( "waiting for threads to finish ..." );
boolean done = false;
while( !done ) {
    done = true;
    for( Thread thread : threads )
        if( thread.isAlive() )
            done = false;
}

for( int i = 0; i < resultRefs.length; i++ ) {
    assertTrue( "you've got the world messed, dawg!",
            myCondition(resultRefs[i]) );
 Here's the problem. Did you notice that nasty try-catch-throwable block? I just added that as a temporary hack so I could see what was going on. In runTest( String ) a few assertions are made, e.g., assertNotNull( null ), but since it is in a different thread, it doesn't cause the unit test to fail!!!! My guess is that we will need to somehow iterate over the threads array, check the status of each, and manually cause an assertion error if the thread terminated in a nasty way. What's the name of the method that gives this information (the stack trace of the dead thread).
@CODE:Thread[] threads = new Thread[MAX_THREADS];
for( int i = 0; i < threads.length; i++ ) {
    threads[i] = new Thread( new Runnable() {
        private final int ID = threadIdSequenceNumber++;
        public void run() {
            try {
                resultRefs[ID] = runTest( Integer.toString( ID ) ); // returns an object
            }
            catch( Throwable t ) { 
                // this code is EVIL - it catches even
                // Errors - don't copy it - more on this below

@CONTENT:I'm building some functional tests for a web site using Selenium, and I'm stuck on a bizarre browser issue where the page never seems to finish loading. The status bar reads either "Transferring data from..." or "Read...". Since the page never finishes loading, my selenium tests timeout. The issue only seems to happen on FireFox. Our tests rely on FireFox *chrome to test file-uploads, so FireFox is crucial to our testing strategy. I've checked both FireBug and Fiddler, but I don't see any incomplete long-running requests. All requests complete with normal response codes (no 404 errors). What should I look at to address this issue? Doctype? Invalid Markup? Low level FireFox setting? Registry Hack? IIS setting? Although fixing the issue for the planet would be awesome, I only really need to fix the issue for my tests. If it helps, it's a .NET 3.5 solution built on MOSS and we're using Flash with sifr. Our markup is legacy (and it's a MOSS site) so it's a bit rough on the edges.

@LINK:/questions/254673/multiple-inheritance-from-two-derived-classes
@TITLE:Multiple Inheritance from two derived classes
@CONTENT:I have an abstract base class which acts as an interface. I have two "sets" of derived classes, which implement half of the abstract class. ( one "set" defines the abstract virtual methods related to initialization, the other "set" defines those related to the actual "work". ) I then have derived classes which use multiple inheritance to construct fully defined classes ( and does not add anything itself ). So: ( bad pseudocode ) class AbsBase {
  virtual void init() = 0;
  virtual void work() = 0;
}

class AbsInit : public AbsBase {
  void init() { do_this(); }
  // work() still abs
}

class AbsWork : public AbsBase {
  void work() { do_this(); }
  // init() still abs
}

class NotAbsTotal : public AbsInit, public AbsWork {
  // Nothing, both should be defined
}
 First of all, can I do this? Can I inherit from two classes which are both derived from the same Base? (I hope so). Here is the "real problem", though (I lied a bit above to simplify the example). What I have really gone and done is add non abstract accessors methods to the base class: class AbsBase {
public:
  void init() { init_impl(); }
  void work() { work_impl(); }

private:
  virtual void init_impl() = 0;
  virtual void work_impl() = 0;
}
 Because, a common idiom is to make all virtual methods private. Unfortunately, now both AbsInit, and AbsWork inherit these methods, and so NotAbsTotal inherits "two of each" ( I realize I may be butchering what is really happening at compile time ). Anyway, g++ complains that: "request for member init() is ambiguous" when trying to use the class. I assume that, had I used my AbsBase class as a pure interface, this would have been avoided ( assuming that the top example is valid ). So: - Am I way off with my implementation? - Is this a limitation of the idiom of making virtual methods private? - How do I refactor my code to do what I want? ( Provide one common interface, but allow a way to swap out implementations for "sets" of member functions ) Edit: Seems I am not the first one: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_problem Seems Virtual Inheritance is the solution here. I have heard of virtual inheritance before, but I have not wrapped my head around it. I am still open to suggestions.

  virtual void init() = 0;
  virtual void work() = 0;

class AbsInit : public AbsBase {

@TITLE:Best practices for merging assemblies?
@CONTENT:I am wondering what are the heuristics when creating releases of libraries to be included in other projects in relation to dependencies and if I should include them or not. My problem is the following: I have a CommonUtilities library that provides as the name implies a set of utilities that can be used in more than one place. Dependencies of CommonUtilities include log4net.dll (the logging framework) and Oracle.DataAccess.dll (database driver). I have another project called MyProject that I want to include CommonUtilities in. MyProject also depends on Oracle.DataAccess. If I use ILMerge and merge CommonUtilities into a single assembly CommonUtilities.dll and reference that from MyProject everything compiles but I am sure I should explicitly reference Oracle.DataAccess from MyProject as it is a dependency and not use the assembly merged into CU. Adding a reference to Oracle.DataAccess as well results in ambiguous using statements as there are two Oracle.DataAccess assemblies referenced. Using ILMerge /Internalize in my case results in compile errors as types from the internalized Oracle.DataAccess assembly are being returned from CommonUtilities and as they are marked internal MyProject does not recognize the type returned. The only way to make this work is simply to not merge this particular assembly (Oracle.DataAccess) into CommonUtilities and only reference that from MyProject. This in turn creates a new problem: Which Oracle.DataAccess.dll should I reference - the dependency distributed with CommonUtils or not? Are there other ways to go about all this?

@TITLE:A Strategy against Policy and a Policy against Strategy
@CONTENT:When I first discovered the Strategy pattern, I was amazed of the seemingly endless possibilities it offered to me and my programs. I could better encapsulate my models' behaviour and even exchange this behaviour on the fly. But the strategy could also be used to to provide traits and payload to the containing object - data that was declared in a superclass. Life was fine. class MyMonsterAI   { float const see_radius_; virtual void attack () = 0; /* .. */ };
class ElveAI        { ElveAI() : see_radius_(150.0f) {} /* ... */ };
class CycloneAI     { CycloneAI() : see_radius_(50.0f) {} /* ... */ };
class Monster       { MyMonsterAI* ai_; };
 And along came the Policy pattern and it would allow me even greater flexibility in supplying parameters to a containing class - whole classes, outfitted however I liked, albeit dynamically exchanging the behaviour... that was not too easy (unless part of the policy was to have a strategy!). class MyMonsterTrait { typedef typename ElveAI AI; };

template< class MonsterTrait >
class Monster : public MonsterTrait::AI
{
    void idle (void) { attack(); }
};
 Both patterns seem to be very powerful to me and I like to use both, in different circumstances. But I'm not sure if there are particular/typical/more-practical applications for either at some situations. I am wondering: where do you use strategies and where policies? Where are either better suited?
@CODE:class MyMonsterAI   { float const see_radius_; virtual void attack () = 0; /* .. */ };
class ElveAI        { ElveAI() : see_radius_(150.0f) {} /* ... */ };

@LINK:/questions/168596/programmatically-triggering-events-in-javascript-for-ie-using-jquery
@TITLE:Programmatically triggering events in Javascript for IE using jQuery
@CONTENT:When an Event is triggered by a user in IE, it is set to the window.event object. The only way to see what triggered the event is by accessing the window.event object (as far as I know) This causes a problem in ASP.NET validators if an event is triggered programmatically, like when triggering an event through jQuery. In this case, the window.event object stores the last user-triggered event. When the onchange event is fired programmatically for a text box that has an ASP.NET validator attached to it, the validation breaks because it is looking at the element that fired last event, which is not the element the validator is for. Does anyone know a way around this? It seems like a problem that is solvable, but from looking online, most people just find ways to ignore the problem instead of solving it. To explain what I'm doing specifically: I'm using a jQuery time picker plugin on a text box that also has 2 ASP.NET validators associated with it. When the time is changed, I'm using an update panel to post back to the server to do some things dynamically, so I need the onchange event to fire in order to trigger the postback for that text box. The jQuery time picker operates by creating a hidden unordered list that is made visible when the text box is clicked. When one of the list items is clicked, the "change" event is fired programmatically for the text box through jQuery's change() method. Because the trigger for the event was a list item, IE sees the list item as the source of the event, not the text box, like it should. I'm not too concerned with this ASP.NET validator working as soon as the text box is changed, I just need the "change" event to be processed so my postback event is called for the text box. The problem is that the validator throws an exception in IE which stops any event from being triggered. Firefox (and I assume other browsers) don't have this issue. Only IE due to the different event model. Has anyone encountered this and seen how to fix it? I've found this problem reported several other places, but they offer no solutions: jQuery's forum, with the jQuery UI Datepicker and an ASP.NET Validator ASP.NET forums, bug with ValidatorOnChange() function

@CONTENT:I've had a look at the documentation for both of them. This question is prompted by J.F.'s comment here: Retrieving the output of subprocess.call() The current Python documentation for subprocess.call() says the following about using PIPE for subprocess.call(): Note Do not use stdout=PIPE or stderr=PIPE with this function. The child process will block if it generates enough output to a pipe to fill up the OS pipe buffer as the pipes are not being read from. Python 2.7 subprocess.call(): Note Do not use stdout=PIPE or stderr=PIPE with this function as that can deadlock based on the child process output volume. Use Popen with the communicate() method when you need pipes. Python 2.6 includes no such warnings. Also, the subprocess.call() and subprocess.check_call() don't seem to have a way to access their output, except for using stdout=PIPE with communicate(): https://docs.python.org/2.6/library/subprocess.html#convenience-functions Note that if you want to send data to the process¡¦s stdin, you need to create the Popen object with stdin=PIPE. Similarly, to get anything other than None in the result tuple, you need to give stdout=PIPE and/or stderr=PIPE too. https://docs.python.org/2.6/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen.communicate What difference between subprocess.call() and subprocess.Popen() makes PIPE less secure for subprocess.call()? More Specific: Why does subprocess.call() "deadlock based on the child process output volume.", and not Popen()?
@CODE:subprocess.call() PIPE subprocess.call() stdout=PIPE stderr=PIPE subprocess.call() stdout=PIPE stderr=PIPE subprocess.call() subprocess.check_call() stdin Popen stdin=PIPE stdout=PIPE stderr=PIPE subprocess.call() subprocess.Popen() PIPE subprocess.call() subprocess.call() Popen() // #

@TITLE:How to pre-package external libraries when using Spark on a Mesos cluster
@CONTENT:According to the Spark on Mesos docs one needs to set the spark.executor.uri pointing to a Spark distribution: val conf = new SparkConf()
  .setMaster("mesos://HOST:5050")
  .setAppName("My app")
  .set("spark.executor.uri", "<path to spark-1.4.1.tar.gz uploaded above>")
 The docs also note that one can build a custom version of the Spark distribution. My question now is whether it is possible/desirable to pre-package external libraries such as spark-streaming-kafka elasticsearch-spark spark-csv which will be used in mostly all of the job-jars I'll submit via spark-submit to reduce the time sbt assembly need to package the fat jars reduce the size of the fat jars which need to be submitted If so, how can this be achieved? Generally speaking, are there some hints on how the fat jar generation on job submitting process can be speed up? Background is that I want to run some code-generation for Spark jobs, and submit these right away and show the results in a browser frontend asynchronously. The frontend part shouldn't be too complicated, but I wonder how the backend part can be achieved.
@CODE:spark.executor.uri val conf = new SparkConf()
  .setMaster("mesos://HOST:5050")
  .setAppName("My app")
  .set("spark.executor.uri", "<path to spark-1.4.1.tar.gz uploaded above>") spark-submit sbt assembly

@CONTENT:I added the new Toolbar, Tablayout and Viewpager in my android app. I provided Fragments for my 3 Tabs and its working fine. But the problem is that when i scroll up my Toolbar does not hide. I want that when i scroll my fragment it should hide. And one more thing, i am using Webview in the fragment.

@TITLE:How to use stringByAddingPercentEncodingWithAllowedCharacters() for a URL in Swift 2.0
@CONTENT:I was using this, in Swift 1.2 let urlwithPercentEscapes = myurlstring.stringByAddingPercentEscapesUsingEncoding(NSUTF8StringEncoding)
 This now gives me a warning asking me to use stringByAddingPercentEncodingWithAllowedCharacters
 I need to use a NSCharacterSet as an argument, but there are so many and I cannot determine what one will give me the same outcome as the previously used method. An example URL I want to use will be like this http://www.mapquestapi.com/geocoding/v1/batch?key=YOUR_KEY_HERE&callback=renderBatch&location=Pottsville,PA&location=Red Lion&location=19036&location=1090 N Charlotte St, Lancaster, PA
 The URL Character Set for encoding seems to contain sets the trim my URL. i.e, The path component of a URL is the component immediately following the host component (if present). It ends wherever the query or fragment component begins. For example, in the URL http://www.example.com/index.php?key1=value1, the path component is /index.php. However I don't want to trim any aspect of it. When I used my String, for example myurlstring it would fail. But when used the following, then there were no issues. It encoded the string with some magic and I could get my URL data. let urlwithPercentEscapes = myurlstring.stringByAddingPercentEscapesUsingEncoding(NSUTF8StringEncoding) As it Returns a representation of the String using a given encoding to determine the percent escapes necessary to convert the String into a legal URL string Thanks

@TITLE:Is it too early to start an ASP.NET 5 web project?
@CONTENT:We are about to begin development on a completely new web application. It's a big project and will take years to finish and will probably have quite a long lifetime. Since ASP.NET 5 is just around the corner, but still in BETA - is it too early to start a web project using the new ASP.NET version? I can understand that we might have to face a few tricky upgrades before it hits Beta8 and RC, but the benefits of using it right away might beat the costs of upgrading later (or never). What are your thoughts?

I have set its title and it is working fine, the only problem I still have is that when you scroll, the text is lost, depending on the image in the background. What I'd like to do, is set a background to the CollapsingToolbarLayout title, but I haven't find a way to do it. Is there anyway to achieve this? Thanks!

 Setting up the CollapsingToolbarLayout title in the activity: CollapsingToolbarLayout collapsingToolbar =
            (CollapsingToolbarLayout) findViewById(R.id.collapsing_toolbar);
    collapsingToolbar.setTitle("Some title here");
 Edit: Here you can see a sequence of images when I collapse the toolbar. You can see how the title text is not readable. The problem is that I don't have controll of the images that I show, so for some images it looks ok, but for others, like this example, it doesn't look good at all and it is not readable. What I had in mind was maybe add some kind of background to the text, so there is always the same color at the back of the text and it is always readable.

@TITLE:How to group by the elements of an array in Swift
@CONTENT:Let's say that I have this code: class Stat {
   var statEvents : [StatEvents] = []
}

struct StatEvents {
   var name: String
   var date: String
   var hours: Int
}


var currentStat = Stat()

currentStat.statEvents = [
   StatEvents(name: "lunch", date: "01-01-2015", hours: 1),
   StatEvents(name: "dinner", date: "01-01-2015", hours: 1),
   StatEvents(name: "dinner", date: "01-01-2015", hours: 1),
   StatEvents(name: "lunch", date: "01-01-2015", hours: 1),
   StatEvents(name: "dinner", date: "01-01-2015", hours: 1)
]

var filteredArray1 : [StatEvents] = []
var filteredArray2 : [StatEvents] = []
 I could call as many times manually the next function in order to have 2 arrays grouped by "same name". filteredArray1 = currentStat.statEvents.filter({$0.name == "dinner"})
filteredArray2 = currentStat.statEvents.filter({$0.name == "lunch"})
 The problem is that I won't know the variable value, in this case "dinner" and "lunch", so I would like to group this array of statEvents automatically by name, so I get as many arrays as the name gets repeated. How could I do that?
@CODE:class Stat {
   var statEvents : [StatEvents] = []
}

struct StatEvents {
   var name: String
   var date: String
   var hours: Int
}

@LINK:/questions/29528599/scopes-in-dagger-2
@TITLE:Scopes in Dagger 2
@CONTENT:I probably missed something, but I thought Scopes like @Singleton are used to define "scoped lifecycles". I use Dagger 2 in an Android app (but I don't think the problem is android related at all). I have 1 Module: @Module public class MailModule {

  @Singleton @Provides public AccountManager providesAccountManager() {
    return new AccountManager();
  }

  @Singleton @Provides public MailProvider providesMailProvider(AccountManager accountManager) {
    return new MailProvider(accountManager);
  }
}
 I have two different components with @Singleton scope: @Singleton
@Component(modules = MailModule.class)
public interface LoginComponent {

  public LoginPresenter presenter();
}


@Singleton
@Component(
    modules = MailModule.class
)
public interface MenuComponent {

  MenuPresenter presenter();

}
 Both, MenuPresenter and LoginPresenter, have an @Inject constructor. While MenuPresenter expects MailProvider as parameter, LoginPresenter takes an AccountManager:   @Inject public MenuPresenter(MailProvider mailProvider) { ... }

  @Inject public LoginPresenter(AccountManager accountManager) { ... }
 But every time I use the components to create a MenuPresenter or LoginPresenter I get a fresh new instance of MailProvider and AccountManager. I thought they were in the same scope and should therefore be kind of singleton (in the same scope). Did I understand something completely wrong. How do I define a real singleton for multiple components in dagger 2?
@CODE:@Module public class MailModule {

  @Singleton @Provides public AccountManager providesAccountManager() {
    return new AccountManager();
  }

  @Singleton @Provides public MailProvider providesMailProvider(AccountManager accountManager) {
    return new MailProvider(accountManager);
  }
} @Singleton @Singleton
@Component(modules = MailModule.class)
public interface LoginComponent {

  public LoginPresenter presenter();
}


@Singleton
@Component(
    modules = MailModule.class
)
public interface MenuComponent {

  MenuPresenter presenter();

} MenuPresenter LoginPresenter @Inject MailProvider AccountManager @Inject public MenuPresenter(MailProvider mailProvider) { ... }

But they only deal with blocks of same size (in which case we can simply use MPI_Type_vector or MPI_Type_create_subarray and only one MPI_Scatterv call). So, I'm wondering what is the most efficient way in MPI to scatter a matrix to a grid of processors where each processor has a block with a specified size. P.S. I've also looked at MPI_Type_create_darray, but it seems not letting you specify block size for each processor.

@TITLE:Jacoco Code Coverage in android studio
@CONTENT:I am trying to generate Jacoco code coverage report. I have used AndroidTestCase for my test classes. I have found using testCoverageEnabled true and using default android -studio default jacoco, ./gradlew connectedCheck or createDebugCoverageReport create the percentage of successfull/fail test cases, but no coverage report. Then I have tried jacoco {toolVersion "0.7.1.201405082137"}, and task jacocoTestReport(type:JacocoReport, dependsOn: "testDebug"). I have tried to change the dependsOn value with various task.

@TITLE:Is there a way in Json.NET serialization to distinguish between ¡§null because not present¡¨ and ¡§null because null¡¨?
@CONTENT:I'm working in an ASP.NET webapi codebase where we rely heavily on the automatic support for JSON deserialization of message bodies into .NET objects via JSON.NET. As part of building out patch support for one of our resources, I'd very much like to distinguish between an optional property in the JSON object that's not present, vs. that same property that's explicitly to null. My intention is to use the first for "don't change what's there" vs. "delete this thing." Does anyone know if it's possible to mark up my C# DTOs so that when they're deserialized that JSON.NET can tell me which case it was? Right now they're just come up as null, and I can't tell why. Conversely, if anyone can come up with a better design that doesn't require me to do it this way while still supporting the patch verb, I'd love to hear your proposal. As a concrete example, consider this payload that would be passed to put: {
  "field1": "my field 1",
  "nested": {
    "nested1": "something",
    "nested2": "else"
  }
}
 Now, if I just wanted to update field1, I should be able to send this as an HTTP patch: {
  "field1": "new field1 value"
}
 and the nested values would remain untouched. However, if I sent this: {
  "nested": null
}
 I want to know this means I should explicitly remove the nested data.
@CODE:{
  "field1": "my field 1",
  "nested": {
    "nested1": "something",
    "nested2": "else"
  }
} {
  "field1": "new field1 value"
} {
  "nested": null

 Why the call to setArray() is required? I couldn't understand the comment written above that method call. Is it because we are not using synchronised block, we have to flush manually all the variable we use? In the above method they are using re-entrant locks. If they had used synchronised statement do they still need to call setArray() method?. I think no. Question2: If we end up in else, it means we didn't modified elements array, then why we need to flush the value of variable array?
@CODE:public E set(int index, E element) {
    final ReentrantLock lock = this.lock;

@TITLE:OWIN/OAuth2 3rd party login: Authentication from Client App, Authorization from Web API
@CONTENT:I am trying to create a Web API that allows the API's clients (native mobile apps) to login using a 3rd party cloud storage provider. I'm using the following general flow from Microsoft: Here is what I am trying to achieve: I am using the default ASP.NET Web API Visual Studio template with external authentication, along with the OWin.Security.Providers Nuget package for Dropbox login functionality, and the existing built-in login functionality for Google (Drive) and Microsoft (OneDrive). The issue I'm having is that the built-in functionality all seems to do the authentication and authorization as part of one flow. For example, if I set up the following in Startup.Auth.cs: DropboxAuthenticationOptions dropboxAuthOptions = new DropboxAuthenticationOptions
                                                    {
                                                        AppKey = _dropboxAppKey,
                                                        AppSecret = _dropboxAppSecret
                                                    };
app.UseDropboxAuthentication(dropboxAuthOptions);
 ... and navigate to this url from my web browser: http://<api_base_url>/api/Account/ExternalLogin?provider=Dropbox&response_type=token&client_id=self&redirect_uri=<api_base_url>
 I am successfully redirected to Dropbox to login: https://www.dropbox.com/1/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=<id>&redirect_uri=<redirect_uri>
 ... and then after I grant access, am redirected back to: http://<api_base_url>/Help#access_token=<access_token>&token_type=bearer&expires_in=1209600
 ... as you can see the token is part of that, so could be extracted. The problem is that the client needs to be the one navigating to Dropbox and returning the authorization code back up to the Web API, and the Web API would send the authorization code back to the third party to get the token which would then be returned to the client... as shown in the diagram above. I need the ExternalLogin action in the AccountController to somehow retrieve the Dropbox url and return that to the client (it would just be a json response), but I don't see a way to retrieve that (it just returns a ChallengeResult, and the actual Dropbox url is buried somewhere). Also, I think I need a way to separately request the token from the third party based on the authorization code. This post seems a little similar to what I am trying to do: Registering Web API 2 external logins from multiple API clients with OWIN Identity ... but the solution there seems to require the client to be an MVC application, which is not necessarily the case for me. I want to keep this as simple as possible on the client side, follow the flow from my diagram above, but also not reinvent the wheel (reuse as much as possible of what already exists in the OWIN/OAuth2 implementation). Ideally I don't want the client to have to reference any of the OWIN/OAuth libraries since all I really need the client to do is access an external url provided by the API (Dropbox in my example), have the user input their credentials and give permission, and send the resulting authorization code back up to the api. Conceptually this doesn't sound that hard but I have no idea how to implement it and still use as much of the existing OAuth code as possible. Please help!

@TITLE:Why am I able to use my value constructor even though I don't export it?
@CONTENT:For practice, I'm implementing a queue data type in a module called "Queue". My data type is also called "Queue", as is its only value constructor: module Queue (Queue, enq, emptyQueue) where

data Queue a = Queue {
  inbox  :: [a],
  outbox :: [a]

emptyQueue :: Queue a
emptyQueue = Queue [] []

enq :: a -> Queue a -> Queue a
enq x (Queue inb out) = Queue (x:inb) out

-- other function definitions (irrelevant here)...
 As far as I understand, because I wrote Queue, not Queue(..) or Queue(Queue) in the export statement, I don't expect the value constructor of my data type to be exported by the module. This is exactly what I want, for encapsulation purposes: users should not be able to use the value constructor directly; only emptyQueue, enq, and the other functions in my interface. However (and the solution to my problem may be obvious to seasoned Haskellers), if I load my module in GHCi, I'm able to use the value constructor directly. $ ghci Queue.hs

@TITLE:Getting the top values by group using dplyr
@CONTENT:Here's a sample data frame: d <- data.frame(
  x   = runif(90),
  grp = gl(3, 30)
) 
 I want the subset of d containing the rows with the top 5 values of x for each value of grp. Using base-R, my approach would be something like: ordered <- d[order(d$x, decreasing = TRUE), ]    
splits <- split(ordered, ordered$grp)
heads <- lapply(splits, head)
do.call(rbind, heads)

 Using dplyr, I expected this to work: d %>%
  arrange_(~ desc(x)) %>%
  group_by_(~ grp) %>%
  head(n = 5)
 but it only returns the overall top 5 rows. Swapping head for top_n returns the whole of d. d %>%
  arrange_(~ desc(x)) %>%
  group_by_(~ grp) %>%
  top_n(n = 5)
 How do I get the correct subset?

 Then I press run button, or right click the file hello.go, and then run, it gives nothing. Besides, it is also empty in bin folder. Then I press run configurations button, almost empty there with only a project name. it gives: Given Go package not found.
 This is my Preferences for Go: I noticed that both GOROOT and GOPATH are different from those listed in explorer, but once I changed them to C:\Go\src\pkg or C:\Go\src, the Apply and OK button becomes disabled. Besides, I don't have C:\Go\src\pkg folder either. I can go install or go build in command line, but I would like to use eclipse for another much larger project. It's windows 7, and the eclipse version is Luna Service Release 1 (4.4.1). Thank you. EDIT: Now I have the following configurations, and it works fine: Go is installed at c:\Go in Preferences: GOROOT:C:\Go, GOPATH: C:\Users\Tiina\go_workspace The rest in Preferences is filled in automatically. helloTest project is located at C:\Users\Tiina\go_workspace\src\helloTest hello.go is located at C:\Users\Tiina\go_workspace\src\helloTest\hello.go Maybe because I create a project from existing code, and there was something left behind, it automatically adds another GOPATH, in Preferences delete it.

@CONTENT:The help page for runApp says: Runs a Shiny application. This function normally does not return; interrupt R to stop the application (usually by pressing Ctrl+C or Esc). Does "normally" mean "always"? Is there any way to add an "exit" button and return a value to the R session that called runApp? Even if it's a hack, this would be convenient functionality. I've tried some searching but haven't found anything. I've also looked at the source for runApp, the last line is return(.globals$retval), so it looks like there should be a way. Can I set .globals$retval directly and then call some kind of interrupt? Is there a function in the shiny package that does this?

@CONTENT:I am trying to create a service account app so that I can access Google Analytics api using Python. Two things are confusing me. First, when I use the following code: `from oauth2client.client import SignedJwtAssertionCredentials
client_email = "#####client_email#######.gserviceaccount.com"
with open("XXXXXX.p12") as f:
   private_key = f.read()

 I get the following error: `oauth2client.client.CryptoUnavailableError: No crypto library available`

@LINK:/questions/27298282/android-actionbars-custom-view-not-filling-parent
@TITLE:Android ActionBar's custom view not filling parent
@CONTENT:Similar to the question here, but has some key differences. Most notably being that the accepted answer did work until the latest support library releases. Here's the custom view layout: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
              android:orientation="vertical"
              android:layout_width="match_parent"
              android:layout_height="match_parent"
              android:background="#FFDD0000">

</LinearLayout>
 Now, when you try to set just the custom view:   ActionBar actionBar = getSupportActionBar();
  actionBar.setDisplayShowCustomEnabled(true);
  actionBar.setCustomView(R.layout.actionbar);
 You end up with a custom layout that doesn't fill the entire width: To make this more interested, I have a similar setup in a different app:   ActionBar actionBar = getSupportActionBar();
  actionBar.setDisplayOptions(ActionBar.DISPLAY_SHOW_CUSTOM);
  actionBar.setCustomView(R.layout.actionbar);
  actionBar.setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabled(false);
  actionBar.setHomeButtonEnabled(false);
 This did work, until I updated the support libraries to v21. Once I did, I ended up with the same issue on apps that previously haven't had that issue. So, my question is, is there a way to make a custom view actionbar fill the width using the latest support library? Edit After doing some more tests, I found that compiling with targetSdkVersion/compileSdkVersion set to 19 and having v7:19.0.1 (or v7:19.1.0) for the library doesn't have this issue (has the home icon, which is taken care of with the later code), confirming that this is definitely an issue with the latest release.

@CONTENT:The new TestFlight integration is great but it is generating a bit of confusion, and now that my app has been in 'Waiting for Review' status for over 10 days, i'm worried i don't fully understand it. I have an app Ver 1.1 Build 567 now selected for 'Final Review for the App Store'. It is currently in the 'Waiting for Review' status. Some time later, i toggled the TestFlight Beta Testing switch for that version and invited a few Internal testers. I have to questions that should seem obvious from reading the documentation but have eluded me so far. will toggling the 'TestFlight Beta Testing' switch immediately pause the current build that was already 'Waiting for Review for Sale'? if that's not the case, and i don't have to worry about that, the follow-up relates to external testing. will clicking 'Submit for Beta App Review' pause the current build that was already 'Waiting for Review for Sale'? in other words, can you have the same build in review for both the app store and beta testing at the same time? If the answer is yes to both questions, then i'll have to upload a new Pre-Release version (1.2), and select that version for Beta Testing, which of course would force me to turn Beta Testing off for version 1.1. This should definitely allow me to have two different builds, across two different versions in parallel review states - one for the store, and one for the beta testing. Confirmation of this behaviour would be greatly appreciated. Nuno

In the console, I get the errors: Font from origin 'http://www.cyclistinsuranceaustralia.com.au' has been blocked from loading by Cross-Origin Resource Sharing policy: The 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header has a value 'http://www.cyclistinsuranceaustralia.com.au' that is not equal to the supplied origin.

@TITLE:Android camera preview is dark
@CONTENT:I am trying to create a custom camera app. I followed the Android Developer example from here with minor tweaks. However, my camera preview turns out to be rather dark. On the other hand, the stock camera gives a much brighter preview. I have tried several settings to make it work better but it seems none of them are having any impact. Relevant code is posted here. CameraActivity (Main) protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_camera);
    if(CameraHelper.checkCameraHardware(this)) {
        mHelper = new CameraHelper(this, getWindowManager().getDefaultDisplay());
    }

    FrameLayout preview = (FrameLayout) findViewById(R.id.camera_preview);
    mPreview = new CameraPreview(this, CameraHelper.camera);
    mPreview.setLayoutParams(new LayoutParams(CameraHelper.mSize.width, CameraHelper.mSize.height, Gravity.CENTER));

    preview.addView(mPreview);

}
 CameraHelper class (initialize the camera and set the default parameters)     public CameraHelper(CameraListener listener, Display display){
        mListener = listener;
        camera = getCameraInstance();

        mParameters = camera.getParameters();
        initCameraParameters();

        mSize = getPreviewSize(display);
        mParameters.setFocusMode(Parameters.FOCUS_MODE_AUTO);
        mParameters.setPictureSize(2560, 1920);

        mParameters.setAutoExposureLock(false);
        mParameters.setAutoWhiteBalanceLock(false);
        mParameters.set("iso", "ISO800"); //Tried with 400, 800, 600 (values obtained from flatten())
        mParameters.setColorEffect("none");
        mParameters.setPictureSize(2560, 1920);
        mParameters.setPreviewFrameRate(20);
        mParameters.set("scene-mode", "auto");
        mParameters.setFocusMode("auto");
        mParameters.setExposureCompensation(4);     
        camera.setParameters(mParameters);
    }
 The Camera sends the frames to SurfaceHolder.Surface from the example linked from developer pages above. See the difference here: Stock Camera App My Camera App Tried setting the ISO, etc based on upack parameters from the camera as posted here. It still didn't work.

The actual captured image is well lit and exposure compensatiion seems to be working fine. Its just the preview that is giving me a headache. Tested on i9003 running CM11 and Nexus 10 running stock android.

 I understand that it's looking for detail_fragment_container, that i don't have in portrait mode. How do i fix this? Let me know if you need the code as well. Will be glad to post..

@TITLE:iOS 8 Auto cell height - didSelectRowAtIndexPath causes UItableview to jump to top
@CONTENT:I'm currently updating an app to iOS8, and am replacing my own cell height calculations. I have a tableview with a bunch of custom cells. Each cell when selected will present/push a new view onto the navigationController. When the tableview is populated with these cells, and the user selects one near the bottom of the table, the tableview jumps to the top right before the new view is presented. This is very distracting to the user. I'm trying using self sizing cells introduced in iOS 8 here (in the viewDidLoad): self.tableView.estimatedRowHeight = 60.0;
self.tableView.rowHeight = UITableViewAutomaticDimension;
 Here's the code for when a cell is selected - (void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath {

    UIViewController *selectedViewController = [[UIStoryboard storyboardWithName:@"Trip" bundle:nil] instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@"TripDetail"];
    DetailViewController *destViewController = (id)selectedViewController;
    [destViewController setData:self.dataStore];

    [self.navigationController pushViewController:selectedViewController animated:YES];
}
 Does anyone know why this is happening? And how I can make it stop?
@CODE:self.tableView.estimatedRowHeight = 60.0;
self.tableView.rowHeight = UITableViewAutomaticDimension; - (void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath {

I tried all sorts of combinations of [[self navigationController] setNavigationBarHidden:YES animated:NO]; in viewWillAppear, viewDidAppear, viewWillDisappear... etc. // First View Controller

@implementation FirstViewController

- (void)viewWillAppear:(BOOL)animated {
    [super viewWillAppear:animated];

    [[self navigationController] setNavigationBarHidden:NO animated:NO];

}

@end
 Nothing worked. I also tried custom code to "animate" a push and pop, which works, BUT I lose the edge swipe and view panning. Before I dig deeper, just want to make sure I'm not reinventing the wheel. The Starbucks app is what I'm trying to mimic. The root view controller of the app (the dark background view) is full screen and notice how it doesn't have a UINavigationBar. But when you tap on one of the buttons, it pushes on a view controller (the light background view) WITH a UINavigationBar. From there, if you tap the "back" arrow, it view controller pops with the navigation bar. Interactive pop swipe gesture also works.

@TITLE:Upgrading to Ruby 2.1.3 on Mac OSx 10.9.5
@CONTENT:Today I upgraded to Ruby 2.1.3 from 2.0.0 on Mac OSx 10.9.5. It turned out to be more difficult than initially expected. And since I wasted a hell lot of time I thought I share my experiences plus solution in case someone else hits the problem as well. I have xcode + developer tools installed. I updated xcode this week as well - not sure if that was the reason why things suddenly didn't work. However, here are the facts: $ gcc -v

$ git version
git version 1.9.3 (Apple Git-50)
 Getting the latest version of Ruby and using it as default: $ rvm install ruby
$ rvm --default use ruby-2.1.3
 Now the issue is that if I tried to check ruby version I got the following: $ rvm --default use ruby-2.1.3

  Referenced from: /Users/georg/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.1.3/bin/ruby
  Reason: image not found
 In fact nothing was really working - I tried to reload RVM, reinstall, re-install and upgrade homebrew, etc. $ brew update && brew upgrade

$ rvm reload
 Reinstalled ruby $ rvm install ruby-2.1.3
Already installed ruby-2.1.3.
To reinstall use:

    rvm reinstall ruby-2.1.3
 And many other solutions - however, it all did not do the trick. So I checked if I have /usr/local/lib/libcloog-isl.4.dylib $ ls -la /usr/local/lib/libcloog-isl.4.dylib 
 Which didn't give anything back ...

@TITLE:Can an Ember component observe a controller property?
@CONTENT:I have a controller and a component. when the component is rendered, it is passed on in this manner: {{modal-filter feature=feature parentController=this.controller}}
 where feature is a param passed in via controller to handlebars, and parentController is the controller. Now, in the controller itself, there is an property (an array). let's call that array requiredValues. Now within a controller/component itself, we can easily set: valueObserver : function(){
     ...
}.observes('requiredValues')
 However, I need to observe this controller property from a the modal-filter component. So in the modal-filter component, what would I put as the observer function: valueObserver : function(){

 I and several others in the comments said it would not work but the OP insisted that it did and we should try. I ended up making a new Winforms project, adding a button, then putting the above code in the event handler for click and the form did indeed shake. How is the form moving when the message pump is being blocked by this method, OnPaint should not be able to be called on the form nor any of its child controls, how is this working?
@CODE:private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
    {
        this.Left += 10;
        System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(75);

@LINK:/questions/25851112/centering-modal-view-with-autolayout
@TITLE:Centering Modal View with Autolayout
@CONTENT:I'm presenting a UIViewController using presentViewController and a custom modalPresentationStyle, in an effort to implement a Facebook POP animated transition. The modal view itself is completely dynamic, defined using Autolayout constraints in code. There is no xib/storyboard to back the modal. I can't get the modal view to center on screen! Autolayout isn't sufficient, because there is no superview to add constraints on! My presenting code looks like this (taken from a FB POP code sample): - (void)animateTransition:(id <UIViewControllerContextTransitioning>)transitionContext
{
    UIView *fromView = [transitionContext viewControllerForKey:UITransitionContextFromViewControllerKey].view;
    fromView.tintAdjustmentMode = UIViewTintAdjustmentModeDimmed;
    fromView.userInteractionEnabled = NO;

    UIView *dimmingView = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:fromView.bounds];
    dimmingView.backgroundColor = [UIColor colorWithRed:(24/255.0) green:(42/255.0) blue:(15/255.0) alpha:1.0];
    dimmingView.layer.opacity = 0.0;

    UIView *toView = [transitionContext viewControllerForKey:UITransitionContextToViewControllerKey].view;
    toView.frame = CGRectMake(0,
                              0,
                              CGRectGetWidth(transitionContext.containerView.bounds) - 104.f,
                              CGRectGetHeight(transitionContext.containerView.bounds) - 320.f);
    toView.center = CGPointMake(transitionContext.containerView.center.x, -transitionContext.containerView.center.y);

    [transitionContext.containerView addSubview:dimmingView];
    [transitionContext.containerView addSubview:toView];

    POPSpringAnimation *positionAnimation = [POPSpringAnimation animationWithPropertyNamed:kPOPLayerPositionY];
    positionAnimation.toValue = @(transitionContext.containerView.center.y);
    positionAnimation.springBounciness = 10;
    [positionAnimation setCompletionBlock:^(POPAnimation *anim, BOOL finished) {
        [transitionContext completeTransition:YES];
    }];

    POPSpringAnimation *scaleAnimation = [POPSpringAnimation animationWithPropertyNamed:kPOPLayerScaleXY];
    scaleAnimation.springBounciness = 20;
    scaleAnimation.fromValue = [NSValue valueWithCGPoint:CGPointMake(1.2, 1.4)];

    POPBasicAnimation *opacityAnimation = [POPBasicAnimation animationWithPropertyNamed:kPOPLayerOpacity];
    opacityAnimation.toValue = @(0.2);

    [toView.layer pop_addAnimation:positionAnimation forKey:@"positionAnimation"];
    [toView.layer pop_addAnimation:scaleAnimation forKey:@"scaleAnimation"];
    [dimmingView.layer pop_addAnimation:opacityAnimation forKey:@"opacityAnimation"];
}
 This works beautifully, but I need the actual view size to be dynamic (sometimes the modal will have four lines of text and two buttons, etc). To accomplish this, I need to set translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints=NO in the VC subclass. This obviously negates the frame centering I'm doing in the presentation animator. The end result is a modal that's stuck to the left edge of the screen; curiously, it centers itself vertically, but not horizontally. Visually, it looks something like this (pardon the black squares, I had to do it for legal purposes): The obvious solution would be to add a view constraint that centers the view. No problem, right? But where do I add it? view.superview is nil; there is no superview. I tried creating a custom 'superview' property and setting it, but autolayout doesn't know how to handle a view that's outside of its view hierarchy (the presenting vc). This is what my view hierarchy looks like, annotated: You're apparently not supposed to access the UITransitionView directly. Constraints on the UIWindow have no effect. Does anyone have any advice? How do you guys handle this sort of thing?

@TITLE:iOS 7 webview and localStorage persistence - update
@CONTENT:I know this question has been asked both here and elsewhere, but most answers are pretty old, applying to older versions of iOS. I'm developing a hybrid app (for iOS and Android only) using PhoneGap/Cordova and AngularJS and want to use HTML5 localStorage to store content for offline access. http://caniuse.com/#search=localStorage says - "In iOS 5 & 6 localStorage data is stored in a location that may occasionally be cleared out by the OS." What is the situation with an iOS 7* webview, in what cases will localStorage persist, or get cleared out, either by the OS, or by the user? Will an update to the app clear localStorage? What about the user clearing browser history on Safari - will that apply to the webview too? Do I need to worry (or can I even control) where on the fils system the localStorage is created. I understand it should not be backed up on iCloud. * [Considering 91% of users are on iOS7 (https://developer.apple.com/support/appstore/ as of 2nd Sept '14) I'm really just concerned with 7, but welcome input about 6 too] UPDATE 8 Sept Upon further investigation, and just seeing the comment by Nicole Bieber, I'm still not 100% convinced about how persistent it is. I finally got a device (iPad) and using iExplorer I see that localStorage file is in ~/Library/Caches within the app sandbox, see image below. From the docs: https://developer.apple.com/icloud/documentation/data-storage/index.html Data that can be downloaded again or regenerated should be stored in the /Library/Caches directory. Examples of files you should put in the Caches directory include database cache files and downloadable content, such as that used by magazine, newspaper, and map applications. I am simply doing this to set data:   localStorage.setItem('foo','this is the FOO value');
  localStorage.setItem('bar','and this is the BAR value');
 Am I missing something either in the way I should store the data, or not seeing some "magic" that Cordova does?
@CODE:localStorage.setItem('foo','this is the FOO value');
  localStorage.setItem('bar','and this is the BAR value');

@TITLE:How shouldChangeCharactersInRange works in Swift?
@CONTENT:I'm using shouldChangeCharactersInRange as a way of using on-the-fly type search. However I'm having a problem, shouldChangeCharactersInRange gets called before the text field actually updates: In Objective C, I solved this using using below: -(BOOL)textField:(UITextField *)textField shouldChangeCharactersInRange:(NSRange)range replacementString:(NSString *)string
{
    NSString * searchStr = [textField.text stringByReplacingCharactersInRange:range withString:string];

    return YES;
}
 However, I've tried writing this in Swift: func textField(textField: UITextField!, shouldChangeCharactersInRange range: NSRange, replacementString string: String!) -> Bool {
    let txtAfterUpdate:NSString = self.projectSearchTxtFld.text as NSString
    txtAfterUpdate.stringByReplacingCharactersInRange(range, withString: string)

    self.callMyMethod(txtAfterUpdate)
    return true
}
 The method still gets called before I get a value?

@TITLE:Struggling with NSNumberFormatter in Swift for currency
@CONTENT:I am creating a budget app that allows the user to input their budget as well as transactions. I need to allow the user to enter both pence and pounds from separate text fields and they need to be formatted together with currency symbols. I have this working fine at the moment but would like to make it localised as currently it only works with GBP. I have been struggling to covert NSNumberFormatter examples from Objective C to Swift. My first issue is the fact that I need to set the placeholders for the input fields to be specific to the users location. Eg. Pounds and Pence, Dollars and Cents etc... The second issue is that the values inputted in each of the text fields such as 10216 and 32 need to be formatted and the currency symbol specific to the users location needs to be added. So it would become ?10,216.32 or $10,216.32 etc... Also, I need to use the result of the formatted number in a calculation. So how can I do this without running into issues without running into issues with the currency symbol? Any help would be much appreciated.

The timeout is the default of 30 seconds. It is never called even after 1 day has passed (I tried). However, the timeout works for Web Clients. It only works when I call hub.connection.stop(). The Ondisconnected method however works very well when the client is a browser. Thus, I would like to ask whether there is any way for Signal R Hub side to be able to check whether the client is still connected or has already dropped out (such as a ping)?

 How should I fix it? A quick Google search returns no solution. Update 1 The weirder thing is the following snippet works perfectly under the exactly same settings and the same HPC. I think there might be some subtle differences between them two, causing one to work and the other to fail. The working snippet: %%% assess fitness %%%

 Update 2 Suspecting [mid_dsp, right_dsp] = compute_displacement(bitmap, ['1/' num2str(PIX_NO_PER_SIDE)]); causes me trouble, I replace it with mid_dsp = rand();
right_dsp = rand();
 Then, it works! This proves that this is indeed caused by this particular line. However, I do have tested the function, and it returns two numbers correctly! Since the function returns value just as rand() does, I can't see any difference. This confuses me more.

app.listen(process.env.PORT || 8080);
 I got the following error. I dont know where i went wrong. app.use(express.basicAuth('testuser','testpassword'));
                ^
TypeError: Object function createApplication() {
  var app = function(req, res, next) {

  mixin(app, proto);
  mixin(app, EventEmitter.prototype);

  app.request = { __proto__: req, app: app };
  app.response = { __proto__: res, app: app };
  app.init();
  return app;
} has no method 'basicAuth'

 I'm very new to nodejs stuff. Any help would be seriously appreciated
@CODE:var express = require('express');
var app = express();

// Authenticator
app.use(express.basicAuth('testuser','testpassword'));

app.get('/home', function(req, res) {
 res.send('Hello World');
});

app.listen(process.env.PORT || 8080); app.use(express.basicAuth('testuser','testpassword'));

@TITLE:How to speed up communication with subprocesses
@CONTENT:I am using Python 2 subprocess with threading threads to take standard input, process it with binaries A, B, and C and write modified data to standard output. This script (let's call it: A_to_C.py) is very slow and I'd like to learn how to fix it. The general flow is as follows: A_process = subprocess.Popen(['A', '-'], stdin=subprocess.PIPE, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
produce_A_thread = threading.Thread(target=produceA, args=(sys.stdin, A_process.stdin))

B_process = subprocess.Popen(['B', '-'], stdin=subprocess.PIPE, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
convert_A_to_B_thread = threading.Thread(target=produceB, args=(A_process.stdout, B_process.stdin))

C_process = subprocess.Popen(['C', '-'], stdin=subprocess.PIPE)
convert_B_to_C_thread = threading.Thread(target=produceC, args=(B_process.stdout, C_process.stdin)) 

produce_A_thread.start()
convert_A_to_B_thread.start()
convert_B_to_C_thread.start()

produce_A_thread.join()
convert_A_to_B_thread.join()
convert_B_to_C_thread.join()

A_process.wait()
B_process.wait()
C_process.wait()
 The idea is that standard input goes into A_to_C.py: The A binary processes a chunk of standard input and creates A-output with the function produceA. The B binary processes a chunk of A's standard output and creates B-output via the function produceB. The C binary processes a chunk of B's standard output via the function produceC and writes C-output to standard output. I did profiling with cProfile and nearly all of the time in this script appears to be spent in acquiring thread locks. For instance, in a test 417s job, 416s (>99% of the total runtime) is spent on acquiring thread locks: $ python

 . Problem When there are a few hundred (or fewer) <item> elements in the XML, the query performs just fine. However, when there are 1,000 <item> elements, it takes 24 seconds to finish returning the rows in SSMS. When there are 6,500 <item> elements, it takes about 20 minutes to run the cross apply query. We could have 10-20,000 <item> elements. . Questions What makes the cross apply query perform so poorly on this simple XML document, and perform exponentially slower as the dataset grows? Is there a more efficient way to transform the XML document into the tabular dataset (in SQL)?

@TITLE:Google Analytics for iOS - Sending Custom Event Data using Dictionaries as createEventWithCategory allows only 4 parameters to be sent
@CONTENT:I decided to use Google Analytics over Flurry, as Flurry stopped updating tracking Events and nobody from Flurry Support team replied to my query. My requirement is as follows: "Whenever user clicks on tab I need to create an event which includes Tab Name, User ID, Time Stamp." A screenshot from Flurry Event log may describe it more clearly. So, in Google Analytics Event Tracking function createEventWithCategory almost does the needful but it does not allow me to add my custom parameters like User ID, Time Stamp. [tracker send:[[GAIDictionaryBuilder createEventWithCategory:@"ui_action"     // Event category (required)
                                                  action:@"button_press"  // Event action (required)
                                                   label:@"play"          // Event label
                                                   value:nil] build]];    // Event value
 I tried for two solutions and neither of them are upto my expectation which brings me with two questions regarding each approach I took: Attempt 1: Custom Dimensions: Documentation has a sample code like this : // Set the custom dimension value on the tracker using its index.

 tracker set:[GAIFields customDimensionForIndex:1]value:@"Premium user"]
[tracker set:kGAIScreenName value:@"Home screen"];

// Send the custom dimension value with a screen view.
// Note that the value only needs to be sent once, so it is set on the Map,
// not the tracker.

 [tracker send:[[[GAIDictionaryBuilder createAppView] set:@"premium"
                                              forKey:[GAIFields customDimensionForIndex:1]] build]];
 [Custom dimension values can be sent with any Google Analytics hit type, including screen views, events, ecommerce transactions, user timings, and social interactions.] So, I decided to use custom dimensions with createEventWithCategory method and ended up doing like as follows **which works but does not show data as Flurry showed. **  NSString *dimensionValue = @"USER_ID";
[tracker set:[GAIFields customDimensionForIndex:1] value:dimensionValue];
[tracker send:[[[GAIDictionaryBuilder createEventWithCategory:@"TAB_CLICK"
                                                           action:@"Tab Hit"
                                                            label:clickedTabName
                                                            value:nil]
              set:currentUserEmail forKey:[GAIFields customDimensionForIndex:1]] build]];
 Attempt 2: Setting and Sending Data using Dictionaries: I followed the documentation and tried sending NSDictionary object to - (void)send:(NSDictionary *)parameters;method declared in GAITracker.h. But I have no clue where this data will appear in dashboard. Neither in Behavior not in Real Time it shows any update.  id<GAITracker> tracker = [[GAI sharedInstance] trackerWithTrackingId:@"UA-XXXX-X"]; 
 NSDictionary *dataToSendGoogleAnalytics = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:currentTime,@"TIME_STAMP",clickedTabName,@"TAB_NAME", currentUserEmail, @"USER_ID",nil];   
 [tracker send:dataToSendGoogleAnalytics];
 Question: Can't I use something straightforward as Flurry which will give me result like in image and allow me to have event parameters like USER_EMAIL, Time_Stamp, TAB_NAME altogether with every event?: Using simple function like this which accepts NSDictionary object? [Flurry logEvent:@"TAB_CLICKED" withParameters:dataToSendFlurry timed:YES];
 Any suggestions or hint would be appreciated. Thank you.

@LINK:/questions/24081305/how-to-write-integration-tests-for-stripe-checkout-on-rails
@TITLE:How to write integration tests for Stripe checkout on Rails?
@CONTENT:I've hit the wall trying to write an integration test for Stripe's checkout.js [ https://checkout.stripe.com/checkout.js ] for my Rails 3.2 app. Stripe checkout works correctly for me when manually tested (using Stripe's testing keys), but I cannot get Capybara to detect and fill_in the email field in the Stripe checkout iframe modal. I am using poltergeist for headless javascript, though have also tested this with capybara-webkit and even selenium with the same problem. What I am trying to test is the complete subscription sign-up flow, to show that a new user can create a subscriber account after entering their payment details in Stripe - but I cannot get past the Stripe checkout pop-up. Here is my before .. do: describe "show Stripe checkout", :js => true do
  before do
    visit pricing_path
    click_button 'plan-illuminated'
    stripe_iframe = all('iframe[name=stripe_checkout_app]').last
    Capybara.within_frame stripe_iframe do        
      fill_in "email", :with => "test-user@example.com"
      fill_in "billing-name", :with => "Mr Name"
      fill_in "billing-street", :with => "test Street"
      fill_in "billing-zip", :with => 10000
      fill_in "billing-city", :with => "Berlin"
      click_button "Payment Info"
    end
  end
  it { should have_selector('button', text: "Subscribe") }
end
 Which errors with: Failure/Error: Capybara.within_frame stripe_iframe do
 Capybara::Poltergeist::TimeoutError:
   Timed out waiting for response to {"name":"push_frame","args":[null]}
 If I swap out the attempt to choose the correct iframe (suggested here: Capybara trouble filling in JS modal ) like so: # stripe_iframe = all('iframe[name=stripe_checkout_app]').last
# Capybara.within_frame stripe_iframe do  
Capybara.within_frame 'stripe_checkout_app' do
 I still get the similar: Capybara::Poltergeist::TimeoutError:
   Timed out waiting for response to {"name":"push_frame","args":["stripe_checkout_app"]}
 It appears that whichever javascript testing gem I use, rspec/capybara cannot find the Stripe checkout iframe. When I check with Selenium I see the Choose this Plan button pressed and the Checkout pop-up, but the spec times out looking for the email field to fill in. Any ideas? I've already tried: Various ways of choosing or finding the email field. Updating all my gems. Using StripeMock before this (not that it should be involved, right?). Running the same tests against Stripe's own site, which give the same errors: Testing with:   visit "https://stripe.com/docs/checkout"
  click_button 'Pay with Card'
  stripe_iframe = all('iframe[name=stripe_checkout_app]').last
  Capybara.within_frame stripe_iframe do
    fill_in 'Email', with: 'test@example.com'
    sleep 3
  end
 Depending which method I use to select the iframe I receive the same errors. Using just Capybara.within_frame 'stripe_checkout_app' do:  Failure/Error: Capybara.within_frame stripe_iframe do
 Capybara::Poltergeist::TimeoutError:
   Timed out waiting for response to {"name":"push_frame","args":[null]}
 or using Selenium with stripe_iframe = all('iframe[name=stripe_checkout_app]').last:  Failure/Error: Unable to find matching line from backtrace
 SystemStackError:
   stack level too deep
 or even just:  Failure/Error: fill_in 'Email', with: 'test@example.com'
 Capybara::ElementNotFound:
   cannot fill in, no text field, text area or password field with id, name, or label 'Email' found
 ...depending on which testing javascript gem I am using. Any help or wisdom is greatly appreciated!

@TITLE:Is it a bad idea to bind PasswordBox password?
@CONTENT:I've read that the password in a WPF PasswordBox does not have a dependency property for binding the password for security reasons. Despite this, there are ways to bind it anyway. Users of the MVVM pattern require this databinding; the viewmodel cannot touch the PasswordBox directly without breaking the pattern. One way to work with PasswordBoxes in an MVVM setting is to pass the entire PasswordBox control to the ViewModel, but this breaks the pattern anyway. Binding the Password is probably the cleanest way to work with passwords using MVVM. There is an argument against binding the Password since this would keep the plaintext password in unencrypted memory until it gets garbage collected. The way I see it, however, is that the password gets stored in unencrypted memory anyway from the moment you access the Password property. This view (or similar) seems to be seconded in this question. Of course it would be in memory for a shorter period without binding (not that login forms have a tendency of being long-lived anyway), but the risk is still there. Given these arguments, is it really a bad idea to bind the password? And why?

@CONTENT:This question can be considered related to this one, that helped me to improve the R performances in computing the mean on a big array. Unfortunately, in this case I'm trying to apply something more complex (like a quantile calculation). I have a 4-D array with more than 40 millions of elements and I want to calculate the 66th percentile on a specific dimension. Here there is the MATLAB code: > n = randn(100, 50, 100, 20);
> tic; q = quantile(n, 0.66, 4); toc
Elapsed time is 0.440824 seconds.
 Let's do something similar in R. > n = array(rnorm(100*50*100*20), dim = c(100,50,100,20))
> start = Sys.time(); q = apply(n, 1:3, quantile, .66); print(Sys.time() - start)
Time difference of 1.600693 mins
 I was aware of the better performances of MATLAB wrt R but in this case I don't know what to do. Probably I just need to wait 2 minutes instead of one second... I hope someone can suggest me any way to improve running times, anyway, thank you in advance... UPDATE I've applied some of the suggestions into the comments and I've reduced the running time: > start = Sys.time(); q = apply(n, 1:3, quantile, .66, names = FALSE); print(Sys.time() - start)
Time difference of 33.42773 secs
 We're still far from the MATLAB performances but at least I've learnt something. UPDATE I put here some advancements related to `quantile' function discussed here. The running time of same code I've shown above has passed from 33 to 5 seconds...
@CODE:> n = randn(100, 50, 100, 20);

So that class serves as the source for my adapter. I want to use SwipeRefreshLayout for refreshing the adapter and so the ListView.

public void onRefresh() {
    SynchDogs.getInstance().synchronizeWithServer();
}
 So I am supposing this is all I need to initiate the start of pull-to-refresh. If so, inside update what do I do to end the call? I also already have swipeLayout = (SwipeRefreshLayout) findViewById(R.id.swipe_container);
swipeLayout.setOnRefreshListener(this);
swipeLayout.setColorScheme(android.R.color.holo_blue_bright,

@TITLE:Why is the variable name ¡§$scope¡¨ necessary ?
@CONTENT:I'm fairly new to Javascript ( just finished the book Eloquent Javascript ), and am currently reading AngularJS from O'Reilly. And getting this small snippet of code to work from the book drove me crazy for hours and led me down rabbit holes thinking I messed up somewhere in setting up my environment. The only difference in the code provided by the AngularJS book and the code I typed up was that I left out the '$' in "$scope" in the TextController function. Putting the '$' back in allowed the code to work. Here was my reasoning for initially leaving it out: Oh, '$scope' is just a variable name local to the function. Like any other programming language such as Java or C++, because this parameter is just a local variable, I can name it whatever I want since whatever argument gets passed into the function will just get passed by value. Please correct my reasoning and explain why the name of the parameter has to be "$scope". <!doctype html>

(e.g. browser.get(url) followed by browser.getTitle() ) Is there some sort of implicit promising going on? (I don't have to manually defer resolve/fulfill) I've read through https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md and skimmed the links to the webdriver documentation and protractor api but my understanding is still a bit fuzzy.

@CONTENT:I am trying to statically embed a bokeh plot in a personal website, and am encountering some behavior I do not understand. Basically, I am generating a plot using bokeh as follows: import bokeh.plotting as bplt
import numpy as np

x=np.random.random(100)
y=np.random.random(100)

bplt.output_file("t.html")
plot=bplt.line(x,y)

##the following line refers to the bokeh installed on my home computer

#print plot.create_html_snippet(
#           static_path='/opt/anaconda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/bokeh/server/static/')
 So far so good. This produces a file that looks like (random garbage).embed.js, and a prints string containing html syntax that I manually copy into an html file I am calling testembed.html, which I have reproduced below: <html>
<body>

<h2>Simple Embed Example</h2>
<p>This is where my plot should be:</p>
<p>
<!--The next 4 lines are the output of the print statement from the python code-->
<script src="ccbd451a-6995-4dd2-b99c-e4140b362997.embed.js"

</p>

</body>
</html>
 If I have the python code reference my local python installation and copy the generated files (.html and .embed.js) to my local computer, I can see the plot in the html file. However, what I really want to do is have this run on a remote computer, and have the html file accessible through the web on my personal site. When I have static_path refer to my remote computer's python install (as shown above, commented out), I can't see the plot in the html page when I access it through the web (ie, going to http://mywebsite.com/testembed.html). I have no idea why this is happening. For reference, here is the code where the html snippet function is defined: https://github.com/ContinuumIO/bokeh/blob/master/bokeh/objects.py#L309 and I note there is an option I am not passing in create_html_snippet, ie, embed_base_url, which could have something to do with this. Thanks in advance! Mike EDIT I took bigreddot's advice, which solved the problem. The actual problem I had been having was that the webserver I was using was, for security purposes, only able to access things in my public_html directory. The workaround was to rsync the bokeh/static directory into my public_html and point to that: rsync -ax /opt/anaconda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/bokeh/server/static/ /home/myusername/public_html/bokeh-static/
 and then modify my code as follows: import bokeh.plotting as bplt
import numpy as np

x=np.random.random(100)
y=np.random.random(100)

bplt.output_file("t.html")
plot=bplt.line(x,y)


#the following line refers to the bokeh rsynced to my directory
print plot.create_html_snippet(
           static_path='http://www.my_server_website/~myusername/bokeh-static/', 
           embed_base_url = 'http://www.my_server_website/~myusername/where_.js_file_is_located')
 and then obviously copy the generated html into the testembed.html.

@TITLE:Making an adjacency list in C++ for a directed graph
@CONTENT:Hello all :) Today I am refining my skills on graph theory and data structures. I decided to do a small project in C++ because it's been a while since I've worked in C++. I want to make an adjacency list for a directed graph. In other words, something which looks like: 0-->1-->3
1-->2
2-->4
3-->
4-->
 This would be a directed graph with V0 (vertex 0) having an edge to V1 and V3, V1 having an edge to V2, and V2 having an edge to V4, like this: V0----->V1---->V2---->V4
 |
 |
 v
 V3 
 I know that in order to do this, I will need to create an adjacency list in C++. An adjacency list is basically an array of linked lists. Okay, let's see some pseudo C++ code: #include <stdio>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

struct graph{
//The graph is essentially an array of the adjList struct.  
node* List[];

};

struct adjList{
//A simple linked list which can contain an int at each node in the list.

};

struct node {
int vertex;
node* next;
};

int main() {
//insert cool graph theory sorting algorithm here
}
 As you can tell, this pseudocode is currently far from the mark. And that is what i wanted some help with -- pointers and structs in C++ have never been my strong suit. First of all, this takes care of the vertices that a vertex points to -- but what about the vertex itself? How can I keep track of that vertex? When I loop over the array, it will do me no good to only know what vertices are being pointed to, rather than also knowing what points to them. The first element in each list should probably be that vertex, and then the elements after that are the vertices it points to. But then, how can I access this first element of the list in my main program? (sorry if this is convoluted or confusing, I would happy to rephrase). I would like to be able to loop over this adjacency list to do some cool things with graphs. For example, to implement some graph theory algorithms (sorts, shortest paths, etc) using the adjacency list representation. (Also, I had a question about the adjacency list. What is different than just using a list of arrays? Why can't I just have a list with an array at each element in the list?)

@TITLE:Declaring a Javascript variable twice in same scope - Is it an issue?
@CONTENT:Would the following code cause any issues?: var a = 1;
var a = 2;
 My understanding is that javascript variables are declared at the start of the scope. For example: var foo = 'a';
foo = 'b';
var bar = 'c';
 Is processed as: var foo;
var bar;
foo = 'a';
foo = 'b';
bar = 'c';
 Therefore would my initial code snippet become: var a;
a = 1;
a = 2;
 Or would it become: var a;
var a;
a = 1;
a = 2;
 I understand that declaring a javascript variable twice in the same scope isn't good practice, but I'm more interested in the impact of doing this.
@CODE:var a = 1;
var a = 2; var foo = 'a';
foo = 'b';
var bar = 'c'; var foo;
var bar;
foo = 'a';
foo = 'b';
bar = 'c'; var a;
a = 1;
a = 2; var a;
var a;
a = 1;

@LINK:/questions/21706415/jackson-objectmapper-using-custom-serializers-and-deserializers
@TITLE:Jackson ObjectMapper using custom Serializers and Deserializers
@CONTENT:I've got a class that configures a Jackson ObjectMapper. It adds in some custom serializers and deserializers for my object types as follows: public class JsonMapperFactory {
    public static ObjectMapper createObjectMapper() {
        final SimpleModule module = new SimpleModule("customerSerializationModule", new Version(1, 0, 0, "static version"));
        addCustomDeserializersTo(module);
        addCustomSerializersTo(module);

        final ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();
        objectMapper.registerModule(module);
        return objectMapper;
    }
    private static void addCustomSerializersTo(final SimpleModule module) {
        module.addSerializer(DateTime.class, new DateTimeSerializer());
    }
    private static void addCustomDeserializersTo(final SimpleModule objectMapper) {
        objectMapper.addDeserializer(DateTime.class, new DateTimeDeserializer());
    }
}
 I've tested my customer serializers within their own test classes, so in my test of this JsonMapperFactory class, I'm trying to simply check that the ObjectMapper created has the expected serializers (or deserializers) This could be achieve by introspecting the ObjectMapper, but it doesn't seem to have any mechanisms to do this. Does anyone know of a nice way to test that? For deserializers, I have the following: private void assertThatObjectMapperUsesCorrectDeserializer(final Class<?> typeClazz, final Class<?> deserializerClazz) throws JsonMappingException {
    final  DeserializationConfig deserializationConfig = this.objectMapper.getDeserializationConfig();
    final JsonDeserializer<Object> deserializer = this.objectMapper.getDeserializerProvider().findTypedValueDeserializer(deserializationConfig, javaTypeFor(typeClazz), null);
    assertThat(deserializer, is(instanceOf(deserializerClazz)));
}
private JavaType javaTypeFor(final Class<?> clazz) {
    return TypeFactory.type(clazz); //deprecated method :(
}
 Which is quite verbose and uses deprecated methods. I'm yet to find a way to do a similar test for the serializers. So I've currently resorted to serializing an object and check it serializes correctly (essentially duplicating the serializer test) Any ideas are very welcome.
@CODE:public class JsonMapperFactory {
    public static ObjectMapper createObjectMapper() {
        final SimpleModule module = new SimpleModule("customerSerializationModule", new Version(1, 0, 0, "static version"));
        addCustomDeserializersTo(module);
        addCustomSerializersTo(module);

        final ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();
        objectMapper.registerModule(module);
        return objectMapper;
    }
    private static void addCustomSerializersTo(final SimpleModule module) {
        module.addSerializer(DateTime.class, new DateTimeSerializer());
    }
    private static void addCustomDeserializersTo(final SimpleModule objectMapper) {
        objectMapper.addDeserializer(DateTime.class, new DateTimeDeserializer());
    }
} JsonMapperFactory private void assertThatObjectMapperUsesCorrectDeserializer(final Class<?> typeClazz, final Class<?> deserializerClazz) throws JsonMappingException {
    final  DeserializationConfig deserializationConfig = this.objectMapper.getDeserializationConfig();
    final JsonDeserializer<Object> deserializer = this.objectMapper.getDeserializerProvider().findTypedValueDeserializer(deserializationConfig, javaTypeFor(typeClazz), null);
    assertThat(deserializer, is(instanceOf(deserializerClazz)));
}

    return TypeFactory.type(clazz); //deprecated method :(

@TITLE:value semantics vs output params with large data structures
@CONTENT:2013 Keynote: Chandler Carruth: Optimizing the Emergent Structures of C++ 42:45 You don't need output parameters, we have value semantics in C++. ... Anytime you see someone arguing that nonono I'm not going to return by value because copy would cost too much, someone working on an optimizer says they're wrong. All right? I have never yet seen a piece of code where that argument was correct. ... People don't realize how important value semantics are to the optimizer because it completely clarifies the aliasing scenarios. Can anyone put this in the context of this answer: http://stackoverflow.com/a/14229152 I hear that being repeated on and on but, well, for me a function returning something is a source. Output parameters by reference take that characteristic out of a function, and removing such hard coded characteristic from a function allows one to manage outside instead, how output will be stored/reused. My question is, even in the context of that SO answer, is there a way to tell, restructuring the code some other equivalent way, "ok now see, value semantics in this way doesn't lose for the output param version", or Chandler comments were specific to some contrived situations? I had even seen Andrei Alexandrescu arguing this in a talk and telling you can't escape using by ref output for better performance. For another take on Andrei's comments see Eric Niebler: Out Parameters, Move Semantics, and Stateful Algorithms.

@CONTENT:Is there an explicit equivalent command in Python's matplotlib for Matlab's hold on? I'm trying to plot all my graphs on the same axes. Some graphs are generated inside a for loop, and these are plotted separately from su and sl: import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

for i in np.arange(1,5):
    z = 68 + 4 * np.random.randn(50)
    zm = np.cumsum(z) / range(1,len(z)+1)
    plt.plot(zm)
    plt.axis([0,50,60,80])

plt.show()

n = np.arange(1,51)
su = 68 + 4 / np.sqrt(n)
sl = 68 - 4 / np.sqrt(n)

plt.plot(n,su,n,sl)

plt.axis([0,50,60,80])
plt.show()
@CODE:hold on for su sl import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

for i in np.arange(1,5):
    z = 68 + 4 * np.random.randn(50)

@TITLE:Play Framework 2 Stage Task on Windows, ¡§The input line is too long¡¨
@CONTENT:I'm trying to Play 2 application on Windows Server Server 2012 using the "stage" task, with the goal of wrapping this up in a service so the application will automatically run when the server gets restarted. However, when running the app I get the following message: The input line is too long.
The syntax of the command is incorrect.
 This is because Windows has a limit of around 8000 characters for command line instructions but it seems like the Play stage command is exceeding this by passing the classpath as an argument. Copying the "stage" folder to c:\ might fix the issue (as it'll reduce the size of the classpath) but I was hoping there would be a more elegant solution. Has anyone found a way around this? Alternatively, do people have any suggestions for running a Play application on Windows so that it will automatically run when the server is restarted. Thanks.

@CONTENT:Desired outcome: Use model first approach with Entity Framework and allow changes to deployed database/ model to be done automatically based on the changes in the model. Automatic schema difference script generation to allow smooth migrations. Is there a way to perform migrations in model first EF6? I can see code first migrations topics all over, but nothing much on Model First. Options I saw so far: Database generation power pack (seems outdated) somehow convert to code first, then use migrations (not desirable, as I like to have a visual designer) somehow piggy back on code first migrations (http://blog.amusedia.com/2012/08/entity-framework-migration-with-model.html : this is for EF5, got error that can't run migrations on Model First) some third party tools?

@TITLE:Why will two-phase lookup fail to choose overloaded version of 'swap'?
@CONTENT:I am studying this fascinating answer to a subtle question regarding the best practice to implement the swap function for user-defined types. (My question was initially motivated by a discussion of the illegality of adding types to namespace std.) I will not re-print the code snippet from the above-linked answer here. Instead, I would like to understand the answer. The answer I've linked above states, beneath the first code snippet, in regards to overloading swap in namespace std (rather than specializing it in that namespace): If your compiler prints out something different then it is not correctly implementing "two-phase lookup" for templates. The answer then goes on to point out that specializing swap in namespace std (as opposed to overloading it) produces a different result (the desired result in the case of specialization). However, the answer proceeds with an additional case: specializing swap for a user-defined template class - in which case, again, the desired result is not achieved. Unfortunately, the answer simply states the facts; it does not explain why. Can someone please elaborate on that answer, and describe the process of lookup in the two specific code snippets provided in that answer: overloading swap in namespace std for a user-defined non-template class (as in the first code snippet of the linked answer) specializing swap in namespace std for a user-defined template class (as in the final code snippet of the linked answer) In both cases, the generic std::swap is called, rather than the user-defined swap. Why? (This will shed light on the nature of two-phase lookup, and the reason for the best practice for implementing user-defined swap; thanks.)

@LINK:/questions/21329662/explanation-of-red-black-tree-based-implementation-of-treemap-in-java
@TITLE:Explanation of Red-Black tree based implementation of TreeMap in JAVA
@CONTENT:I was going through the source code of TreeMap in JAVA. As per JAVA doc: A Red-Black tree based NavigableMap implementation. The map is sorted according to the natural ordering of its keys, or by a Comparator provided at map creation time, depending on which constructor is used. This implementation provides guaranteed log(n) time cost for the containsKey, get, put and remove operations. Algorithms are adaptations of those in Cormen, Leiserson, and Rivest's Introduction to Algorithms. In the source code I found that an Inner Class Entry was used as a node. static final class Entry<K,V> implements Map.Entry<K,V> {
        K key;
        V value;
        Entry<K,V> left = null;
        Entry<K,V> right = null;
        Entry<K,V> parent;
        boolean color = BLACK;
        ....
 As for the defination of Red-Black tree. From Wikipedia I found: A red¡Vblack tree is a type of self-balancing binary search tree, a data structure used in computer science. The self-balancing is provided by painting each node with one of two colors (these are typically called 'red' and 'black', hence the name of the trees) in such a way that the resulting painted tree satisfies certain properties that don't allow it to become significantly unbalanced. When the tree is modified, the new tree is subsequently rearranged and repainted to restore the coloring properties. The properties are designed in such a way that this rearranging and recoloring can be performed efficiently. I tried to analyse the souce code but couldn't understand the following: Suppose I am already having two keys "C" and "E" in the Tree and then I am adding "D". How the nodes will be arranged (Using natural ordering). How is self-balancing of Tree is implemented in the java source code. I tried searching for detail implementationof TreeMap but was unable to find any article such as the following article I have found for HashMap Since yesterday I am hanging on this Tree :( Can someone please help me get down...
@CODE:static final class Entry<K,V> implements Map.Entry<K,V> {
        K key;
        V value;
        Entry<K,V> left = null;
        Entry<K,V> right = null;

@CONTENT:I'm using Jasmine with Karma to test my app built on Angular. I've to test a service that loads user data and I'm using $httpBackend to mock the responses. However, when I run the test, I got two errors: Error: No pending request to flush! Error: Unsatisfied requests: GET https://api.github.com/users/wilk Module: 'use strict';

app.service ('UserService', ['$resource', '$q', 'GITHUB_API_URL', function ($resource, $q, GITHUB_API_URL) {
  var userResource = $resource (GITHUB_API_URL + '/users/:user', {user: '@user'}) ,
      userModel = {};

  return {
    data: function () {
        return userModel;
    } ,
    populate: function (user) {
      var deferred = $q.defer () ,
          userRequest = userResource.get ({user: user});

      $q
          .when (userRequest.$promise)
          .then (function (data) {
              userModel = data;
              deferred.resolve (data);
          });

      return deferred.promise;
    }
  };
}]);
 Test: 'use strict';

describe ('Service: UserService', function () {
    beforeEach (module ('myApp'));

    var $appInjector = angular.injector (['myApp']) ,

        $httpBackend

            .respond ({
                login: GITHUB_USER ,
                id: 618009
            });
    }));

    afterEach (function () {
        $httpBackend.verifyNoOutstandingExpectation ();

    });

    describe ('when populate method is called', function () {
        it ('should returns user data', function () {
            $httpBackend.expectGET (GITHUB_API_URL + '/users/' + GITHUB_USER);

            UserService.populate (GITHUB_USER);
            $httpBackend.flush ();
            expect(UserService.data ()).toEqual ({
                login: GITHUB_USER ,
                id: 618009
            });

        });
    });
});
 Let's assume that GITHUB_API_URL is equal to 'https://api.github.com/' and GITHUB_USER is equal to 'wilk'. I'm running this test with Karma-Jasmine 0.1.5 and AngularJS 1.2.6 (with Angular Mocks and Scenario 1.2.6). What's wrong with this code?

      userModel = {};

  return {
    data: function () {
        return userModel;
    } ,
    populate: function (user) {
      var deferred = $q.defer () ,
          userRequest = userResource.get ({user: user});

      $q

          });

      return deferred.promise;
    }
  };

@CONTENT:Please have a look at the following code- static void Main(string[] args)
{
    // Get the task.
    var task = Task.Factory.StartNew<int>(() => { return div(32, 0); });

    // For error handling.
    task.ContinueWith(t => { Console.WriteLine(t.Exception.Message); },

    // If it succeeded.

{
    if (y == 0)
    {
        throw new ArgumentException("y");
    }
    return x / y;
}
 If I execute the code in release mode, The output is "One or more errors occurred" and once I hit the "Enter key, "Hello" is also getting displayed. If I run the code in debug mode, the output is same as release mode. But when debugging in IDE, A IDE exception message ("Unhandled exception in user code" ) appears when the control executes the line throw new ArgumentException("y"); 
 If I continue from there on, the program does not crash and displays the same output as release mode. Is this proper way to handle exception?

@TITLE:Play Framework 2 Stage Task on Windows, ¡§The input line is too long¡¨
@CONTENT:I'm trying to Play 2 application on Windows Server Server 2012 using the "stage" task, with the goal of wrapping this up in a service so the application will automatically run when the server gets restarted. However, when running the app I get the following message: The input line is too long.
The syntax of the command is incorrect.
 This is because Windows has a limit of around 8000 characters for command line instructions but it seems like the Play stage command is exceeding this by passing the classpath as an argument. Copying the "stage" folder to c:\ might fix the issue (as it'll reduce the size of the classpath) but I was hoping there would be a more elegant solution. Has anyone found a way around this? Alternatively, do people have any suggestions for running a Play application on Windows so that it will automatically run when the server is restarted. Thanks.

@TITLE:Entity Framework 6 Model First Migration
@CONTENT:Desired outcome: Use model first approach with Entity Framework and allow changes to deployed database/ model to be done automatically based on the changes in the model. Automatic schema difference script generation to allow smooth migrations. Is there a way to perform migrations in model first EF6? I can see code first migrations topics all over, but nothing much on Model First. Options I saw so far: Database generation power pack (seems outdated) somehow convert to code first, then use migrations (not desirable, as I like to have a visual designer) somehow piggy back on code first migrations (http://blog.amusedia.com/2012/08/entity-framework-migration-with-model.html : this is for EF5, got error that can't run migrations on Model First) some third party tools?

@LINK:/questions/21384604/why-will-two-phase-lookup-fail-to-choose-overloaded-version-of-swap
@TITLE:Why will two-phase lookup fail to choose overloaded version of 'swap'?
@CONTENT:I am studying this fascinating answer to a subtle question regarding the best practice to implement the swap function for user-defined types. (My question was initially motivated by a discussion of the illegality of adding types to namespace std.) I will not re-print the code snippet from the above-linked answer here. Instead, I would like to understand the answer. The answer I've linked above states, beneath the first code snippet, in regards to overloading swap in namespace std (rather than specializing it in that namespace): If your compiler prints out something different then it is not correctly implementing "two-phase lookup" for templates. The answer then goes on to point out that specializing swap in namespace std (as opposed to overloading it) produces a different result (the desired result in the case of specialization). However, the answer proceeds with an additional case: specializing swap for a user-defined template class - in which case, again, the desired result is not achieved. Unfortunately, the answer simply states the facts; it does not explain why. Can someone please elaborate on that answer, and describe the process of lookup in the two specific code snippets provided in that answer: overloading swap in namespace std for a user-defined non-template class (as in the first code snippet of the linked answer) specializing swap in namespace std for a user-defined template class (as in the final code snippet of the linked answer) In both cases, the generic std::swap is called, rather than the user-defined swap. Why? (This will shed light on the nature of two-phase lookup, and the reason for the best practice for implementing user-defined swap; thanks.)

@LINK:/questions/21329662/explanation-of-red-black-tree-based-implementation-of-treemap-in-java
@TITLE:Explanation of Red-Black tree based implementation of TreeMap in JAVA
@CONTENT:I was going through the source code of TreeMap in JAVA. As per JAVA doc: A Red-Black tree based NavigableMap implementation. The map is sorted according to the natural ordering of its keys, or by a Comparator provided at map creation time, depending on which constructor is used. This implementation provides guaranteed log(n) time cost for the containsKey, get, put and remove operations. Algorithms are adaptations of those in Cormen, Leiserson, and Rivest's Introduction to Algorithms. In the source code I found that an Inner Class Entry was used as a node. static final class Entry<K,V> implements Map.Entry<K,V> {
        K key;
        V value;
        Entry<K,V> left = null;
        Entry<K,V> right = null;
        Entry<K,V> parent;
        boolean color = BLACK;
        ....
 As for the defination of Red-Black tree. From Wikipedia I found: A red¡Vblack tree is a type of self-balancing binary search tree, a data structure used in computer science. The self-balancing is provided by painting each node with one of two colors (these are typically called 'red' and 'black', hence the name of the trees) in such a way that the resulting painted tree satisfies certain properties that don't allow it to become significantly unbalanced. When the tree is modified, the new tree is subsequently rearranged and repainted to restore the coloring properties. The properties are designed in such a way that this rearranging and recoloring can be performed efficiently. I tried to analyse the souce code but couldn't understand the following: Suppose I am already having two keys "C" and "E" in the Tree and then I am adding "D". How the nodes will be arranged (Using natural ordering). How is self-balancing of Tree is implemented in the java source code. I tried searching for detail implementationof TreeMap but was unable to find any article such as the following article I have found for HashMap Since yesterday I am hanging on this Tree :( Can someone please help me get down...
@CODE:static final class Entry<K,V> implements Map.Entry<K,V> {
        K key;
        V value;
        Entry<K,V> left = null;
        Entry<K,V> right = null;
        Entry<K,V> parent;
        boolean color = BLACK;

 Now, I would like the option to copy the generator after any number of iterations, so that the new copy will retain the internal state (will have the same 'i' in the example) but will now be independent from the original (i.e. iterating over the copy should not change the original). I've tried using copy.deepcopy but I get the error:  "TypeError: object.__new__(generator) is not safe, use generator.__new__()"   
 Obviously, I could solve this using regular functions with counters for example. But I'm really looking for a solution using generators.

@TITLE:MySQL Counting Distinct Values on Multiple Columns
@CONTENT:I wrote a script that runs each time a user logs into a computer in our domain. This script makes a record of the user as well as the computer they logged into. Any number of users can log into any number of computers. I just inherited this IT environment from a consultant who is no longer around, and I'm writing this little query so when I get a call from a user, I can search by that user's name and reasonably predict which computer they are using by the number of times they've logged into any given computer. Here's a sample of the data in the 'login' table:     COMPUTER        USER
    ncofp02         lee
    ncofp02         lee
    ncofp02         andy
    ncodc01         andy
    ncodc01         andy
    ncodc01         lee
 What I'm banging my head on is the logic to count distinct values across multiple columns. I'd like to see a result like this:     COMPUTER       USER   COUNT
    ncofp02        lee    (2)
    ncofp02        andy   (1)
    ncodc01        lee    (1)
    ncodc01        andy   (2)
 Is there a way to accomplish this with a single query within mysql, or should I start looping some php? (booooo!)
@CODE:COMPUTER        USER
    ncofp02         lee
    ncofp02         lee

@TITLE:How to properly close a client proxy (An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host)?
@CONTENT:Please don't close as duplicate until you read the question to the end; I already googled for hours without success. EDIT: Now I'm convinced it's related to the way WCF caches opened TCP connections (connection pooling). Please take a look at edit #5 at the end of he question. I basically have a WCF service that uses a netTcpBinding configuration. Even if I close the client proxy gracefully (see code below), server always logs "System.Net.Sockets.SocketException (0x80004005): An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host". I've narrowed down the issue to the most basic WCF example I could write. I'm getting the exception in the logs produced by WCF tracing every-time I close the client application. I'm not getting any exception in my own code though, which means it works as expected and I can't debug anything to see what's going wrong for WCF to add an error in my logs.

 Client-side code that consumes the service (VS2012 generated the client proxy for me using "Add service reference"): private async Task<string> TestTask()
{
    Service1Client proxy = null;

    try
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Calling service");

        proxy = new Service1Client();
        return await proxy.DoWorkAsync();
    }
    finally
    {
        if (proxy.State != System.ServiceModel.CommunicationState.Faulted)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Closing client");
            proxy.Close();
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Aborting client");
            proxy.Abort();
        }
    }
}
 Everything works fine: Calling service Closing client 12 But as soon as the application terminates, the server logs an exception. I understand I shouldn't be worried about this exception because it works as expected (exception only appears in logs) and could happen anyway in case the client is terminated abruptly before calling .Close()/.Abort(). But still, is this a normal behavior? I mean, if I correctly closes my client proxy, I expect the server to not log an exception (that is polluting my logs). I also assume some TCP connection is still established between the client and the server (unknown state) after closing the client proxy, because the server only logs the exception after the whole client application terminates. If such a connection is still opened, can't this introduce unexpected behavior (such as max number of connected clients)? Is this really expected? I found different threads about the issue: http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/vstudio/en-US/0f548f9b-7051-46eb-a515-9185f504d605/error-using-nettcpbinding-an-existing-connection-was-forcibly-closed-by-the-remote-host?forum=wcf wcf "An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host" after closing client The conclusion would be "don't care about it". Could someone confirm that with some references and explain why this exception is thrown anyway? EDIT: Log trace of the exception: <Exception>

 Thanks a lot EDIT 2: I have the same problem when hosting the service in IIS or when it's self-hosted in a Windows service EDIT 3: here's a full example to reproduce the issue: http://speedy.sh/ENB59/wcf-test.zip EDIT 4: I tried to monitor what is actually happening under the hood with the TCP connection WCF establishes for me. After closing the client proxy, I still see an opened TCP connection to my server: I assume this is related to the TCP connection to be cached for a future re-use (i.e. connection pooling), because opening a new connection to the server (after the first client proxy has been closed) doesn't create a new TCP connection. If I call Console.WriteLine(new Test().TestTask().Result); twice in my application, I still only see one opened TCP connection. I also noted this connection dies because of a timeout if I wait too long after closing the client channel. EDIT 5: OK, I found documentation on MSDN about that connection pooling: The NetTcpBinding uses TCP connection pooling based on the service¡¦s host DNS name and the port number the service is listening on. This works well when a client makes calls to different services on different ports, or services are hosted in a single process and share a port. If a single client calls multiple services sharing a port that are hosted in different processes, or are WAS/IIS hosted, the client side pooling may lead to problems where a connection to Service A is reused for Service B, resulting in an exception being thrown, the connection aborted, and a new channel created. To avoid this problem, use a CustomBinding and specify a different ConnectionPoolSettings.GroupName for each service the client communicates with. So now my question would be: if that's a normal behavior, what could I do to prevent my log to be polluted with all those exceptions?

@TITLE:NPM doesn't install module dependencies when deploying a Grunt app to heroku
@CONTENT:I'v made a static single page site using grunt. I'm now trying to deploy it to heroku using the heroku buildpack for node grunt. Below is a pic of my root directory: Here's my Gruntfile, package.json & Procfile: https://gist.github.com/callumflack/8038464 https://gist.github.com/callumflack/8038483 web: node index.html When I $ git push heroku master it gets to the Gruntfile and fails: -----> Found Gruntfile, running grunt heroku:production task
>> Local Npm module "grunt-contrib-uglify" not found. Is it installed?
 The above errors proceed to list all local NPM modules as not found. If I list all loadNpmTasks instead of using "load-grunt-tasks", I get the exact same error. When I $ heroku logs I get: Starting process with command `node web.js`
Error: Cannot find module '/app/web.js'
 Can anyone see where I've gone wrong?

@TITLE:Contrasts can be applied only to factor
@CONTENT:I have a question about R. I am using a test called levene.test to test a homogeneity of variance. I know that you need a factor variable with at least two levels in order for this to work. And from what I see, I do have at least two levels for the factor variable that I am using. But somehow I keep getting the error of: > nocorlevene <- levene.test(geno1rs11809462$SIF1, geno1rs11809462$k, correction.method = "correction.factor")

    Error in `contrasts<-`(`*tmp*`, value = contr.funs[1 + isOF[nn]]) : 
      contrasts can be applied only to factors with 2 or more levels
 I even try generate a variable from a binomial distribution: k<-rbinom(1304, 1, 0.5)
 and then use that as a factor, but is still not working. Lastly I create a variable with 3 levels: k<-sample(c(1,0,2), 1304, replace=T)
 but some how still not working and getting the same error of: nocorlevene <- levene.test(geno1rs11809462$SIF1, geno1rs11809462$k, correction.method="zero.removal") Error in `contrasts<-`(`*tmp*`, value = contr.funs[1 + isOF[nn]]) :

@TITLE:std::endl crashes Windows 8, compiled using MinGW
@CONTENT:I have 3 computers, two of which use Windows 8. Using the latest version of MinGW's g++ (4.8.1-4) my hello world program freezes whenever I compile and run on the Windows 8 computers but not in Windows 7. #include <iostream>
int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" <<std::endl;
    return 0;
}
 This compiles just fine in g++ but running a.exe will display "Hello, World!" then a window will pop up and say "a.exe has stopped working, Windows can check online for a solution to the program...." etc. Has anybody seen this problem. Also, I tried "std::cout << "Hello, World!\n" << std::flush;" and this has the same problem. It seems that every function that flushes the buffer causes a crash. Following Eric's advice, I recompiled the program and ran it in gdb and got the following output: Program received signal SIGILL, Illegal instruction.

@TITLE:AngularJS - fail resilence on $q.all()
@CONTENT:I'm trying to fill some local data resolving a series of remote calls. When every promise is resolved, I load the data and proceed. The method $q.all( [] ) does exactly this:         $q.all([
            this.getUserInfo(11)
                .then(function (r) {
                    results.push(r)
                }),

            this.getUserConns()
                .then(function (r) {
                    results.push(r)
                }),

            this.getUserCtxs()
                .then(function (r) {
                    results.push(r)

        ])
        .then(function () {
            console.log(results)
        })
 Problem is, this code is not resilient. If any of these call fails, nobody gets the fish! Wrapping the calls in a try/catch statement, simply causes $q.all() to entirely ignore the entry, even when not failing (note the console.log in the func)...         $q.all([
            this.getUserInfo2(11)
                .then(function (r) {
                    results.push(r)
                }),

            function () {
                try {
                    this.getUserGroups()
                        .then(function (r) {
                            console.log(r)
                            results.push(r)
                        })
                }
                catch (err) {
                    console.log(err)
                }
            },
        ])
        .then(function () {
            console.log(results)
        })
 Output: [Object] Any hint on how I could wrap this to be resilient? Thanks to @dtabuenc, I've gone one step further. Implementing the error callback, I can avoid the breaking of the chain, and push the values of the resolved promises. However, a nasty Exception is still displayed on the console... How can I get rid of that if I cannot try/catch on async requests? Caller code     return $q.all([

@TITLE:CSS3 simple donut chart
@CONTENT:What I'm trying to do is create a simple donut chart. I'm currently using CSS(3) only but I don't know if it's possible without javascript. What I have so far: http://jsfiddle.net/aBP5Q/ HTML: <div class="donut-container" style="background: #9C0;">

 I would like to display the green and blue colors as the precentage. So no green is 0% and full green (360 degrees) is 100%. Maybe even with a simple animation when the chart is loaded if its possible. Your help is much appreciated.

@TITLE:node.js processes with the same name in forever are closed when trying to close only one
@CONTENT:I am deploying two node.js apps on the aws, the two apps are in the paths shown as /home/ubuntu/nodes/app1/app.js
/home/ubuntu/nodes/app2/app.js
 respectively to run the node.js apps in the background, I used forever to start two apps, so like    $ sudo forever start /home/ubuntu/nodes/app1/app.js
   $ sudo forever start /home/ubuntu/nodes/app2/app.js
 so forever works well by running the two node.js apps in the background process. However, when I tried to stop one process with forever command like this.    $ sudo forever stop /home/ubuntu/nodes/app1/app.js
 unexpectedly, both node.js process are closed with info like this info:    Forever stopped process:

 I assume it is because two node.js process has the same name - app.js, how to avoid this by close only one process

@LINK:/questions/20329477/sprite-atlas-and-2x-images
@TITLE:Sprite Atlas and @2x images
@CONTENT:When using texture atlas (iPhone5) do I have to include sprite images at both normal and normal@2x sizes (even though I am only targeting retina devices). I thought I could getaway with only adding the @2x versions but sadly when I run the application the sprites come out a lot bigger than they should be (nearly 4x), I only get the right size sprites displayed when I add the normal (@1x) images to the atlas as well. EDIT: Starting a new project file in Xcode, if you want an image to fill the whole device display (iPhone5/5S at the maximum resolution) you need to use the @2x extension (in this case there is no "background_003.png" in the Xcode project so just the @2x version is fine)     // SETUP BACKGROUND FRAME IS {320, 568} POINTS
    // IMAGE "background_003@2x.png" = 640 x 1136 Pixels
    SKSpriteNode *background = [SKSpriteNode spriteNodeWithImageNamed:@"background_003"];
    [background setAnchorPoint:CGPointZero];
    [background setPosition:CGPointZero];
    [self addChild:background];
 If you add the correct sized image (640 x 1136) without the @2x Xcode takes the image and scales it incorrectly by the devices 2.0 point size, resulting in an image that is twice as big as the display.     // SETUP BACKGROUND FRAME IS {320, 568} POINTS
    // IMAGE "background_001.png" = 640 x 1136 Pixels
    SKSpriteNode *background = [SKSpriteNode spriteNodeWithImageNamed:@"background_001"];
    [background setAnchorPoint:CGPointZero];
    [background setPosition:CGPointZero];
    [self addChild:background];
 RESULT: After a little bit of testing this morning I have now realised that my problem was the result of adding sprite frames in an atlas without the @2x postfix and then renaming them to include the missing @2x. It would seem that when using folder.atlas Xcode creates a plist somewhere that references the files, I can't find this and it only seems to get updated when you first add your atlas to your project. After deleting and re-adding the atlas Xcode started correctly displaying the @2x images at the right scale. The moral of this story is therefore: if you change an atlas or its contents, make a copy, delete it from your Xcode project and re-add it again. Create all your artwork at retina resolution and add the @2x postfix to all your files, you only need none retina files (without the @2x if your targeting a none retina device) Finally when referring to art assets in code don't use the @2x postfix, so even though your monster sprite art is called "Monster_0001@2x.png" you should be referring to it in code as "Monster_0001" Xcode will work out the @2x bit for you behind the scenes, also if your using PNGs (which you should be) it will even add the ".png" for you too. // THE ART ASSET ON DISK IS CALLED: "Monster_0001@2x.png"
SKSpriteNode *spriteMonster = [SKSpriteNode spriteNodeWithImageNamed:@"Monster_0001"];
@CODE:// SETUP BACKGROUND FRAME IS {320, 568} POINTS
    // IMAGE "background_003@2x.png" = 640 x 1136 Pixels

@TITLE:Accessing webservices from a website which is running behind a proxy
@CONTENT:I am designing a website using ember and express over node. Its running in a server, say: SERVER_1. I have few webservices running in another server, say: SERVER_2. That is: website in SERVER_1 and webservices available in SERVER_2 SERVER_1 is behind a proxy server. And I am trying to access webservices from SERVER_1: SERVER_1 =====[PROXY]===> SERVER_2
 When I make AJAX webservice calls from SERVER_1, I receive: NetworkError: 500 Internal Server Error
 However, I am able to retrieve values successfully through browser. Only through AJAX code, I am retrieving Network 500 error. Also for testing, I removed my proxy server setup: SERVER_1 =====> SERVER_2
 and I was able to access all those web services successfully both via AJAX code and browser. If I have a proxy server in between them: SERVER_1 =====[PROXY]===> SERVER_2
 I am getting -- NetworkError: 500 Internal Server Error I like to know the procedures to access third-party webservices from a website which is running behind a proxy server? Additional Info: Already to fix cross domain web-service access issue (website running in one server and webservices running in some other different servers with different ports), I am using http-proxy npm and my code is as follows: var express = require('express');
var routes = require('./routes');
var http = require('http');
var path = require('path');
var httpProxy = require('http-proxy');
var endpoint  = {
    host:   'IP_ADDRESS_WHERE_MY_WEBSERVICES_RUN',
    port:   80,
    prefix: '/api'
}

var proxy = new httpProxy.RoutingProxy();
var app = express();

app.set('port', process.env.PORT || 3000);
app.set('views', path.join(__dirname, 'views'));
app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
app.use(express.favicon());
app.use(express.logger('dev'));
app.use(express.methodOverride());
app.use(express.cookieParser('xxxxx'));
app.use(express.session());
app.use(app.router);
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));
app.use(function(req, res) {
    if (req.url.indexOf(endpoint.prefix) === 0) {
        proxy.proxyRequest(req, res, endpoint);
    }
});
app.use(express.bodyParser());

if ('development' == app.get('env')) {
    app.use(express.errorHandler());
}
app.get('/', routes.index);

http.createServer(app).listen(app.get('port'), function(){
    console.log('Express server listening on port ' + app.get('port'));
});
 My AJAX call: $.ajax({
            type: 'GET',
            async: false,
            url: 'API_URL',
            success: function (data) {
                alert('success');
            },
            failure: function(error){
                alert('error');
            }
        });
 Already I using http-proxy to handle all url's request. How can I configure my proxy server's IP address and port in the above code, so that I can access all these webservices successfully? Or is there some way to have my proxy configurations in AJAX call? Can anyone please guide me? Thank you

@TITLE:Translate and Scale animation in parallel
@CONTENT:I want to move some view from any position to center of screen and scale in parallel. If that's too complicated, translate and scale sequentially is also acceptable. But neither I could achieve. I think it's the problem with the pivot point. But sorry I found no solution. Please help. Maybe it's easy to those who develop games, about which I did nothing. Below is my code: private void moveViewToScreenCenter( final View view ){
    DisplayMetrics dm = new DisplayMetrics();
    getWindowManager().getDefaultDisplay().getMetrics( dm );
    int statusBarOffset = dm.heightPixels - rootLayout.getMeasuredHeight();

    int originalPos[] = new int[2];
    view.getLocationOnScreen( originalPos );

    int xDelta = (dm.widthPixels - view.getMeasuredWidth())/2 - originalPos[0];
    int yDelta = (dm.heightPixels - view.getMeasuredHeight())/2 + statusBarOffset - originalPos[1];

    AnimationSet animSet = new AnimationSet(true);
    animSet.setFillAfter(true);
    animSet.setDuration(1000);
    animSet.setInterpolator(new BounceInterpolator());
    TranslateAnimation translate = new TranslateAnimation( 0, xDelta , 0, yDelta);
    animSet.addAnimation(translate);
    ScaleAnimation scale = new ScaleAnimation(1f, 2f, 1f, 2f, ScaleAnimation.RELATIVE_TO_PARENT, .5f, ScaleAnimation.RELATIVE_TO_PARENT, .5f);
    animSet.addAnimation(scale);
    view.startAnimation(animSet);
}

@CODE:private void moveViewToScreenCenter( final View view ){

@TITLE:Assembly binding error when building Office add-in: ¡§FindRibbons¡¨ task failed unexpectedly
@CONTENT:We're trying to set up a Jenkins (build server) job to build our Office add-in based on VSTO. However, I keep getting a strange error that fails the build process after the DLL is copied to the bin directory of the project: Error 11 The "FindRibbons" task failed unexpectedly.
System.IO.FileNotFoundException:
  Could not load file or assembly 'MyAddIn, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, 
  PublicKeyToken=null' or one of its dependencies.
  The system cannot find the file specified.
File name: 'MyAddIn, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null'
 So the problem is that the "FindRibbons" task, triggered by the Office add-in build target, has successfully identified the MyAddIn DLL as being an Office Add-In, but is not able to locate and load it! Any ideas? I'd love to be able to debug the FindRibbons task directly but hooking into and debugging the compile process seems a little extreme... Here are some observations: In our build server's Fusion logs for binding the MyAddIn assembly it looks like it's looking in the folder where MSBuild.exe lives (C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\) and nowhere else. On my dev machine, there is no Fusion log entry for MyAddIn! But the build process succeeds and Kivo works fine. On both my dev and build machines I also have Fusion log entries for WhereRefBind!Host=(LocalMachine)!FileName=(PresentationCore.dll) and ExplicitBind!FileName=(MyAddIn.dll) which show the binding succeeding. This error comes up on the build server whether I use Visual Studio or MSBuild from the command line to build the project. I've ensured that the .NET/MSBuild/VS2012 versions are identical on both my dev machine and the build server and the error still occurs. The only difference seems to be that the build server is running Windows Server 2012 (since it's Azure, and we can't spin up a Windows 7 image).

@TITLE:AngularJS/Jade Error: Argument 'MyController' is not a function, got undefined (MEAN)
@CONTENT:I know variations of this question have already been asked several times, but I've tried several suggested solutions for other OPs, haven't been able to resolve this, and would appreciate some clarification. I'm working with the basic mean todo list app (http://www.mean.io/). After implementing a simple controller I'm running into the "Error: Argument 'nameOfMyController' is not a function, got undefined." Here's where I'm at: app.js (boilerplate) window.app = angular.module('mean', ['ngCookies', 'ngResource', 'ui.bootstrap', 'ui.route', 'mean.system', 'mean.articles' ]);

angular.module('mean.system', []);
angular.module('mean.articles', []);
 I've tried modifying what's referenced here, like, for example, adding mean.controller to the array but that clearly isn't the right way to do it because it tells me the module doesn't exist. here's my taskController.js (a mean tutorial I followed made taskController a standalone function but I'm declaring it as a constructor the way angular's docs say to) var mean = angular.module('mean',[]);

mean.controller('taskController', function taskController($scope){

   $scope.todos = [];

   $scope.doneFilter = { done : true };
   $scope.notDoneFilter = { done : false };

   $scope.setTodos = function(todos){
       $scope.todos = todos;
   };

});
 I also tried angular.module('mean.system').controller('taskController', function taskController($scope){ ... }, same result. ok now for the views: included ng-app in default.jade !!! 5

@TITLE:How to use pagination on HTML tables?
@CONTENT:I am trying to use this Pagination library in my HTML table page (specifically light theme) but somehow I am not able to understand how to plugin this library in such a way in my HTML page so that I can have pagination code working in my HTML table.. Right now, I have HTML table without any pagination code working so my below HTML code will show you a table with all the rows in one page which is not what I want... I want to show 6 items in my table in one page by using above pagination javascript.. And as soon as I click on second pagination tab, it should show me next six items and keep on going until it is finished.. Below is my full HTML code in which I have tried using the same above pagination javascript but it doesn't work for me.. <html>

@TITLE:Plotting histograms from grouped data in a pandas DataFrame
@CONTENT:I need some guidance in working out how to plot a block of histograms from grouped data in a pandas dataframe. Here's an example to illustrate my question: from pandas import DataFrame
import numpy as np
x = ['A']*300 + ['B']*400 + ['C']*300
y = np.random.randn(1000)
df = DataFrame({'Letter':x, 'N':y})
grouped = df.groupby('Letter')
 In my ignorance I tried this code command: df.groupby('Letter').hist()
 which failed with the error message "TypeError: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'float' objects" Any help most appreciated.

@TITLE:Why java does not autobox int[] to Integer[]
@CONTENT:When I do the following, arrayList1 - contains one element and it is an int[]. arrayList2 - not compiling (Error : The constructor ArrayList<Integer>(List<int[]>) is undefined) arrayList3 - contains 7 elements and they are Integer objects Here's the code: int[] intArray = new int[]{2,3,4,5,6,7,8};
ArrayList arrayList1 = new ArrayList(Arrays.asList(intArray));

Integer[] integerArray = new Integer[]{2,3,4,5,6,7,8};
ArrayList<Integer> arrayList3 = new ArrayList<Integer>(Arrays.asList(integerArray));
 Question : Why doesn't the compiler auto-box the elements in the int[] to Integer and create an ArrayList<Integer>? What is the reason behind this? Is that my stupidity or some other reason?

@TITLE:Visual Studio 2013 Git Version Control - SSH Key
@CONTENT:I'm very excited that VS 2013 includes built in support for Git, but I'm having some trouble getting it to work correctly. I have authentication set up to my own private installation of Gitlab using an SSH key, but I don't see anywhere in Visual Studio 2013 to specify this SSH key. I also had to put in the global Git settings (name and e-mail) in the IDE, which means it's not actually pulling that information from the global settings I've already set up. Does anybody have any experience with this? I know the official version was just released, but I'm hoping someone may have figured this out with the RC. Thanks!

@LINK:/questions/19501584/how-to-pass-in-templateurl-via-scope-variable-in-attribute
@TITLE:How to pass in templateUrl via scope variable in attribute
@CONTENT:I'm trying to pass in the url for the template via a scope variable. The scope will not change so the template doesn't need to update based on it, but currently the scope variable is always undefined. <div cell-item template="{{col.CellTemplate}}"></div>
 Ideally the directive would be: .directive("cellItem", ["$compile", '$http', '$templateCache', '$parse', function ($compile, $http, $templateCache, $parse) {
        return {
            scope: {
                template: '@template'
            },
            templateUrl: template // or {{template}} - either way
        };
    }])
 This doesn't work however. I've tried a lot of different permutations in accomplishing the same concept, and this seems the closest, however it still doesn't work. .directive("cellItem", ["$compile", '$http', '$templateCache', '$parse', function ($compile, $http, $templateCache, $parse) {
        return {
            scope: {
                template: '@template'
            },
            link: function (scope, element, attrs) {
                var templateUrl = $parse(attrs.template)(scope);
                $http.get(templateUrl, { cache: $templateCache }).success(function (tplContent) {
                    element.replaceWith($compile(tplContent)(scope));
                });
            }
        };
    }])
 I've also tried using ng-include, but that also doesn't evaluate scope variables before compiling. The CellTemplate value is coming from a database call so is completely unknown before evaluation. Any suggestions for getting this working would be greatly appreciated! Edit: I'm using angular 1.0.8 and am not able to upgrade to a newer version.

            scope: {
                template: '@template'
            },
            templateUrl: template // or {{template}} - either way
        };
    }]) .directive("cellItem", ["$compile", '$http', '$templateCache', '$parse', function ($compile, $http, $templateCache, $parse) {
        return {
            scope: {
                template: '@template'
            },

                var templateUrl = $parse(attrs.template)(scope);

 Everything is good at this point. When I read the session like this: get '/debug' do
    session.inspect
end
 Its all there. But here comes the problem. When I go for another post request later on: post '/foo' do
    # do nothing
end
 The session is cleared. Why? Is this a bug? EDIT I have narrowed the problem down: I proxypass Sinatra through nginx, to http://app.local/backend - this is when the issue occurs. If I run Sinatra through http://localhost:4567 it all works as expected. SOLUTION Use Rack::Session::Cookie instead of the default enable :sessions: use Rack::Session::Cookie, :key => "rack.session",
:path => "/backend"
# etc
 from the Sinatra FAQ: If you need to set additional parameters for sessions, like expiration date, use Rack::Session::Cookie directly instead of enable :sessions:
@CODE:enable :sessions
set :session_secret, 'secret'

post '/login' do
        session[:loggedInUser] = jsondata['username'].to_s
        puts session[:loggedInUser] + " is the session"
end get '/debug' do
    session.inspect
end post '/foo' do
    # do nothing
end http://app.local/backend http://localhost:4567 Rack::Session::Cookie enable :sessions use Rack::Session::Cookie, :key => "rack.session",
:path => "/backend"
# etc :key => "rack.session", :path => "/backend"

@TITLE:Accepting invitation multipeer connectivity
@CONTENT:I hope I am not violating NDA by posting this question. I am using the new multipeer connectivity to send using bluetooth some files to nearby devices. I have managed to send invitations, but I don't seem to get how to display a UIAlertView where the user can accept or decline the invite. Right now when a user sends, the file is automatically saved and there is no accept/decline alert. The code is: - (void) advertiser:(MCNearbyServiceAdvertiser *)advertiser
didReceiveInvitationFromPeer:(MCPeerID *)peerID
               withContext:(NSData *)context
         invitationHandler:(void(^)(BOOL accept,
                                    MCSession *session))invitationHandler{
... save the data context
 but with the alert: - (void) advertiser:(MCNearbyServiceAdvertiser *)advertiser
didReceiveInvitationFromPeer:(MCPeerID *)peerID
                withContext:(NSData *)context
         invitationHandler:(void(^)(BOOL accept,
                                    MCSession *session))invitationHandler{


DevicePeer = [MCPeerID alloc];
DevicePeer = peerID;
ArrayInvitationHandler = [NSArray arrayWithObject:[invitationHandler copy]];

// ask the user
UIAlertView *alertView = [[UIAlertView alloc]
                          initWithTitle:@""
                          message:@""
                          delegate:self
                          cancelButtonTitle:@"NO"
                          otherButtonTitles:@"YES", nil];
[alertView show];
 alertView.tag = 2;
}
 and the alert view method:  - (void) alertView:(UIAlertView *)alertView
 clickedButtonAtIndex:(NSInteger)buttonIndex
{  
    // retrieve the invitationHandler
    // get user decision
    BOOL accept = (buttonIndex != alertView.cancelButtonIndex) ? YES : NO;
    // respond
    MCSession *session = [ArrayInvitationHandler objectAtIndex:0];

    void (^invitationHandler)(BOOL, MCSession *) = [ArrayInvitationHandler objectAtIndex:0];

    invitationHandler(accept, session);
}
 When the user press YES the app crashes and I get the error: [__NSMallocBlock__ nearbyConnectionDataForPeer:withCompletionHandler:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x14d4e3b0'
 I have looked up at the IOS developer library and there is no such method apart from - (void)nearbyConnectionDataForPeer:(id)arg1 withCompletionHandler:(id)arg2{

 which does no work. No info on the IOS developer forums. Any ideas?

@CONTENT:Windows Phone 7 or 8 PhoneGap 3 AngularJS 1.2 I have a PhoneGap app using AngularJS that works great on iOS and Android, but I'm having a problem getting it to work on Windows Phone 7 and 8. The app starts fine and I see my index.html page (which in my case is just a loading screen). Source files are loaded and my pre-boot code is running fine. Then it stops and nothing happens. I've littered "console.log" messages throughout the code and I see it gets to the point of angular.bootstrap() and then dies. I'm not familiar enough with angular to know what to do next or how to debug this further to track down what the absolute problem code might be. Inside of bootstrap() begins the maze of DI calls so the code becomes much less linear. I do see this error in the console but have no idea what it means or how to fix it: An exception of type 'System.NotSupportedException' occurred in Microsoft.Phone.ni.dll and wasn't handled before a managed/native boundary
 No other errors or any output is logged to the console. I tried delaying all of my bootstrap code by 10 seconds with a setTimeout and that error is always reported before angular.bootstrap() is called, so I don't know if it is even related. Also worth noting that I've tried the app in IE on the desktop and it works fine there. So my question is: How do I go about debugging this?

 The issue is my custom td template is not rendered at all.

@LINK:/questions/18414001/gridextra-colour-different-rows-with-tablegrob
@TITLE:gridExtra Colour different rows with tableGrob
@CONTENT:I have a question regarding tableGrob/grid.table from the gridExtra package. Using the regular parameter settings, it is straightforward to colour alternate rows. However, I was hoping that it might be feasible to get a bit more control over the colouring of the rows. For example, is it possible to colour every third row in a different colour? I suspect the grid.edit function is one way to approach this, judging by the example in this link: http://code.google.com/p/gridextra/wiki/tableGrob but I can't figure out how to apply that to my question. I believe the person who posted this question had the same in mind. Table with rows of different colors with tableGrob I am currently stuck with R 2.13 due to compatibility issues, so if there are any suggestions which don't involve later versions that would be ideal. Example code: library(gridExtra)

grid.table(mtcars[1:10, ],
           gpar.coretext = gpar(fontsize = 10),
           gpar.corefill = gpar(fill = "lightblue", alpha=0.5, col = NA),
           h.even.alpha = 0.5
           )
@CODE:library(gridExtra)

grid.table(mtcars[1:10, ],
           gpar.coretext = gpar(fontsize = 10),
           gpar.corefill = gpar(fill = "lightblue", alpha=0.5, col = NA),

@TITLE:How to make sure Rails API is secured from CSRF?
@CONTENT:I've been developing Rails app with REST API for access from mobile application. It works quite well. When user logs in from mobile application, he gets auth_token that he uses in his future requests to API. The issue is that API is also accessible from web by going to path /api/v1/... and because of this, it has to be protected from CSRF. I have BaseApiController class which inherits from ApplicationController that has protect_from_forgery "enabled". Here's example: class Api::V1::BaseApiController < ApplicationController
  # ...
end

class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  protect_from_forgery
  # ...
end
 Now, when I do non-GET requests to my API, with auth_token, my request gets completed successfully, but in the logs I can see the famous WARNING: Can't verify CSRF token authenticity. If I remove protect_from_forgery from my BaseApiController, I don't get any warnings (obviously), but then my API is vulnerable to CSRF attacks (I made a simple HTML form that successfully changes the data across domains when there's no protect_from_forgery). My question is: How to assure my API stays secure, but also remove the warning when doing non-GET requests? Here's one of the solutions I've come up with, but it looks more like a hack and executes one extra DB query: class Api::V1::BaseApiController < ApplicationController
  # ...
  def verified_request?
    super || User.where(authentication_token: params['auth_token']).count > 0
  end
end

@CONTENT:So guys, I'm trying to play a bit with Javac Cross compilation with Ant and on terminal. Locally and on an integration environment and i'm having the same problem on the very basic problem. I run this in the linux terminal (and also on my cygwin on windows and the cmd):  javac -target 1.6 -source 1.7 -bootclasspath /usr/java/jdk1.6.0_27/jre/lib/rt.jar Main.java
 with Main.java with nothing other than a System.out.println. javac -version ==> javac 1.7.0_11
 I'm getting the error message: javac: source release 1.7 requires target release 1.7
 I have roughly the same configuration on my local windows machine with the exact same results. It was my understanding that cross compilation is all about compiling some source code that is compatible with a higher version jdk using that higher version of jdk, but passing the rt.jar of the target version that is supposedly lower. if target and source are the same, it worked. target=1.7 and source=1.7 workd fine

target=1.6 and source=1.6 worked just fine
 but i want cross-compilation, so what is it that i'm doing wrong? I appreciate all the help I could get and thanks in advance.

@TITLE:Determining the ¡§optimal¡¨ common numeric type in a template parameter pack
@CONTENT:What is the best way to determine a common numeric type in a template parameter pack with: the smallest size, no loss of precision, and no risk of overflow/underflow when converting any type in the parameter pack to this "ideal" common type? The variadic template (best_common_numeric_type) could be used like so: template<typename... NumericTypes>
auto some_numeric_func(const NumericTypes&...)
-> typename best_common_numeric_type<NumericTypes...>::type;
 And have instantiations like the following: [1] best_common_numeric_type<long, unsigned long, float, double, int>::type = double
[2] best_common_numeric_type<unsigned int, unsigned long>::type = unsigned long
[3] best_common_numeric_type<signed int, signed long>::type = signed long
[4] best_common_numeric_type<signed int, unsigned int>::type = signed long
[5] best_common_numeric_type<signed int, unsigned long>::type = int128_t (maybe)
 So in case [4] for example, ::type would have to be signed long, since signed int could not hold an unsigned int without risk of overflow, and conversely unsigned int could not hold a signed int without risk of underflow. The same applies in [5], except now a signed long is no longer sufficient since it could not hold the unsigned long without risk of overflow. (The implementation might be data model specific, but you get the idea.) So what might be the best way in C++11 to achieve this?
@CODE:best_common_numeric_type template<typename... NumericTypes>
auto some_numeric_func(const NumericTypes&...)
-> typename best_common_numeric_type<NumericTypes...>::type; [1] best_common_numeric_type<long, unsigned long, float, double, int>::type = double
[2] best_common_numeric_type<unsigned int, unsigned long>::type = unsigned long
[3] best_common_numeric_type<signed int, signed long>::type = signed long
[4] best_common_numeric_type<signed int, unsigned int>::type = signed long
[5] best_common_numeric_type<signed int, unsigned long>::type = int128_t (maybe) ::type signed long signed int unsigned int unsigned int signed int signed long unsigned long std::common_type unsigned int signed long unsigned long long best_common_numeric_type <signed long long, unsigned long long> <long long, double> long signed_int_with_size_gt<...>::type

@TITLE:Access the Kanban Column (a Team-Specific Field) for a Work Item
@CONTENT:Is there a way to programmatically access the "Kanban Column" for a WorkItem using the TFS 2012 API? Using the Scrum 2.2 template, the history of a Bug or Product Backlog Item shows "[MyProject\MyTeam] Kanban Column" as a changed field whenever a work item is dragged between Kanban columns on the Board, but the field is not accessible when specifically retrieving a work item through the TFS API. It also shows up as a changed field in the WorkItemChangedEvent object when implementing the ProcessEvent method on the Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Framework.Server.ISubscriber interface. Workaround: A coworker found a blogpost about creating a read-only custom field to persist the value of the Kanban Column, taking advantage of the WorkItemChangedEvent to capture the latest value. It is then possible to query on this column. One problem with this approach is that only a single team's Kanban Column can be tracked. Update: According to this blogpost, the Kanban Column is not a field, rather a "WIT Extension". This may help lead to an answer.

@TITLE:Python Multiprocessing Process or Pool for what I am doing?
@CONTENT:I'm new to multiprocessing in Python and trying to figure out if I should use Pool or Process for calling two functions async. The two functions I have make curl calls and parse the information into a 2 separate lists. Depending on the internet connection, each function could take about 4 seconds each. I realize that the bottleneck is in the ISP connection and multiprocessing won't speed it up much, but it would be nice to have them both kick off async. Plus, this is a great learning experience for me to get into python's multi-processing because I will be using it more later. I have read Python multiprocessing.Pool: when to use apply, apply_async or map? and it was useful, but still had my own questions. So one way I could do it is: def foo():
    pass

def bar():
    pass

p1 = Process(target=foo, args=())
p2 = Process(target=bar, args=())

p1.start()
p2.start()
p1.join()
p2.join()
 Questions I have for this implementation is: 1) Since join blocks until calling process is completed...does this mean p1 process has to finish before p2 process is kicked off? I always understood the .join() be the same as pool.apply() and pool.apply_sync().get() where the parent process can not launch another process(task) until the current one running is completed. The other alternative would be something like: def foo():
    pass

def bar():
    pass
pool = Pool(processes=2)             
p1 = pool.apply_async(foo)
p1 = pool.apply_async(bar)
 Questions I have for this implementation would be: 1) Do I need a pool.close(), pool.join()? 2) Would pool.map() make them all complete before I could get results? And if so, are they still ran asynch? 3) How would pool.apply_async() differ from doing each process with pool.apply() 4) How would this differ from the previous implementation with Process?
@CODE:def foo():
    pass

def bar():
    pass

p1 = Process(target=foo, args=())
p2 = Process(target=bar, args=())

p1.start()
p2.start()
p1.join()
p2.join() def foo():
    pass

def bar():
    pass
pool = Pool(processes=2)             
p1 = pool.apply_async(foo)
p1 = pool.apply_async(bar)

@TITLE:Pass JavaScript object/hash to Handlebars helper?
@CONTENT:Is it possible to pass a JavaScript object/hash into a Handlebars helper call? I'd like to do something like this: <label>Label here</label>
{{#textField {'id':'text_field_1', 'class':'some-class', size:30} }}{{/textField}}
<p>Help text here.</p>
 Here is a jsFiddle. Currently it produces the following error Uncaught Error: Parse error on line 3:
...bel>  {{#textField {'id':'text_field_1'
----------------------^
Expecting 'CLOSE', 'CLOSE_UNESCAPED', 'STRING', 'INTEGER', 'BOOLEAN', 'ID', 'DATA', 'SEP', got 'INVALID' 
 Alternatively I could probably do this and split on ',', but I am not fond of the syntax: {{#textField "'id'='text_field_1','class'='some-class',size=30"}}{{/textField}}
 NOTE: I specifically do NOT want to pass data/attributes (id, class, size, etc.) into the template() method as a JSON object. I want everything in the template.

@TITLE:Pass by reference, constant reference, rvalue-reference, or constant rvalue-reference?
@CONTENT:I was learning passing by reference, and here is the test I did: #include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int i = 0;

//If this is uncommented, compiler gives ambiguous definition error.
//void paramCheck (string s) {
//  cout << ++i << ". Param is var.\n";
//}

void paramCheck (const string& s) {
    cout << ++i << ". Param is const ref.\n";
}

void paramCheck (string& s) {
    cout << ++i  << ". Param is non-const ref.\n";
}

void paramCheck (const string&& s) {
    cout << ++i  << ". Param is const rvalue-reference.\n";
}

void paramCheck (string&& s) {
    cout << ++i  << ". Param is non-const rvalue-reference.\n";
}


int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    //Function call test
    paramCheck("");

    paramCheck(string{""});

    string s3{""};
    paramCheck(s3);

    const string s4{""};
    paramCheck(s4);

    //Illegal
    //string& s{""};
    //paramCheck(s);

    const string& s5{s3};
    paramCheck(s5);

    string&& s6{""};
    paramCheck(s6);

    //Illegal
    //const string&& s{s1};
    //onstFP(s);

    //Reference test
    string a = s3;
    a = "a changed s3";
    cout << s3;

    {
    string& b = s3;
    b = "b changed after assigning s3\n";
    cout << "s3 is now " <<s3;

    b = s4;
    b = "b changed after assigning s4\n";
    cout << "s3 is now " <<s3;
    cout << "s4 is now " <<s4;
    }

    cin.get();
    return 0;
}
 And here is the result I get: 1. Param is non-const rvalue-reference.
2. Param is non-const rvalue-reference.
3. Param is non-const ref.
4. Param is const ref.
5. Param is const ref.
6. Param is non-const ref.
s3 is now b changed after assigning s3
s3 is now b changed after assigning s4
s4 is now
 My question is: If we pass a constant expression, it always triggers non-constant rvalue-reference? Under what condition it will trigger constant rvalue-reference (and why s6 is not trigging it?) Why non-constant reference and constant rvalue-reference are illegal? I expected a cannot change s3, but why b in the inner scope can change s3? If assigning a new object s3 to b is assigning a new reference, why when I assign s4 to it and s3 got changed and s4 is empty afterwards? Sorry for asking too many questions... I will increase the points when all questions are answered :) The reference just brings my confusion from pointer to a whole new level. I don't know how to increase the point... so will wait for 2 days till eligible for bounty then choose the answer.

@TITLE:Grails Testing with Spock - Which Mocking Framework Select?
@CONTENT:I have more general question. Which framework or implementation I should use for mocking in Grails 2.x when using Spock? I know tons of mocking style: leverage Groovy metaClass, Grails mockFor(), Groovy Mock(), Groovy closure style, etc. Each of them has its own advantages and disadvantages. But what I don't understand is that some mocking style works in certain occasions which I cannot determine (i.e. mockFor() works for certain implementation and not for the others). Currently I have two similar implementation of service method mocking. This one works: @TestFor(MyController)
@Mock([MyDevice])
class MyControllerSpec extends ControllerSpec {

void "test st."() {
      def myService = mockFor(MyService)
      myService.demand.myMethod() { def st ->
         return "test"
      }
      controller.myService = myService.createMock()
}
}
 However, this implementation doesn't work: @TestFor(MyController)
@Mock([MyDevice])
class MyControllerSpec extends ControllerSpec {

void "test st."() {
      def yourService = mockFor(YourService)
      yourService.demand.yourMethod() { def st ->
         return "test"
      }
      controller.yourService = yourService.createMock()
}
}
 The service implementation and calling from controller is quite similar. So what is the best practice of mocking in Grails? Or is there any GOOD mocking framework for Grails which would save my time figuring out how to mock? Thanks for any advice! :-) Mateo

         return "test"
      }
      controller.myService = myService.createMock()
}
} @TestFor(MyController)
@Mock([MyDevice])
class MyControllerSpec extends ControllerSpec {

void "test st."() {
      def yourService = mockFor(YourService)

         return "test"
      }

@LINK:/questions/17742379/visual-studio-character-sets-not-set-vs-multi-byte-character-set
@TITLE:Visual Studio Character Sets 'Not set' vs 'Multi byte character set'
@CONTENT:I've working with a legacy application and I'm trying to work out the difference between applications compiled with Multi byte character set and Not Set under the Character Set option. I understand that compiling with Multi byte character set defines _MBCS which allows multi byte character set code pages to be used, and using Not set doesn't define _MBCS, in which case only single byte character set code pages are allowed. In the case that Not Set is used, I'm assuming then that we can only use the single byte character set code pages found on this page: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/goglobal/bb964654.aspx Therefore, am I correct in thinking that is Not Set is used, the application won't be able to encode and write or read far eastern languages since they are defined in double byte character set code pages (and of course Unicode)? Following on from this, if Multi byte character set is defined, are both single and multi byte character set code pages available, or only multi byte character set code pages? I'm guessing it must be both for European languages to be supported. Thanks, Andy Further Reading The answers on these pages didn't answer my question, but helped in my understanding: About the "Character set" option in visual studio 2010 Research So, just as working research... With my locale set as Japanese Effect on hard coded strings char *foo = "Jap text: ???";
wchar_t *bar = L"Jap text: ???";
 Compiling with Unicode *foo = 4a 61 70 20 74 65 78 74 3a 20 83 65 83 58 83 67 == Shift-Jis (Code page 932) *bar = 4a 00 61 00 70 00 20 00 74 00 65 00 78 00 74 00 3a 00 20 00 c6 30 b9 30 c8 30 == UTF-16 or UCS-2 Compiling with Multi byte character set *foo = 4a 61 70 20 74 65 78 74 3a 20 83 65 83 58 83 67 == Shift-Jis (Code page 932) *bar = 4a 00 61 00 70 00 20 00 74 00 65 00 78 00 74 00 3a 00 20 00 c6 30 b9 30 c8 30 == UTF-16 or UCS-2 Compiling with Not Set *foo = 4a 61 70 20 74 65 78 74 3a 20 83 65 83 58 83 67 == Shift-Jis (Code page 932) *bar = 4a 00 61 00 70 00 20 00 74 00 65 00 78 00 74 00 3a 00 20 00 c6 30 b9 30 c8 30 == UTF-16 or UCS-2 Conclusion: The character encoding doesn't have any effect on hard coded strings. Although defining chars as above seems to use the Locale defined codepage and wchar_t seems to use either UCS-2 or UTF-16. Using encoded strings in W/A versions of Win32 APIs So, using the following code: char *foo = "C:\\Temp\\???\\?a.txt";
wchar_t *bar = L"C:\\Temp\\???\\?w.txt";

CreateFileA(bar, GENERIC_WRITE, 0, NULL, CREATE_ALWAYS, FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL, NULL);
CreateFileW(foo, GENERIC_WRITE, 0, NULL, CREATE_ALWAYS, FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL, NULL);
 Compiling with Unicode Result: Both files are created Compiling with Multi byte character set Result: Both files are created Compiling with Not set Result: Both files are created Conclusion: Both the A and W version of the API expect the same encoding regardless of the character set chosen. From this, perhaps we can assume that all the Character Set option does is switch between the version of the API. So the A version always expects strings in the encoding of the current code page and the W version always expects UTF-16 or UCS-2. Opening files using W and A Win32 APIs So using the following code: char filea[MAX_PATH] = {0};
OPENFILENAMEA ofna = {0};
ofna.lStructSize = sizeof ( ofna );
ofna.hwndOwner = NULL  ;
ofna.lpstrFile = filea ;
ofna.nMaxFile = MAX_PATH;
ofna.lpstrFilter = "All\0*.*\0Text\0*.TXT\0";
ofna.nFilterIndex =1;
ofna.lpstrFileTitle = NULL ;
ofna.nMaxFileTitle = 0 ;
ofna.lpstrInitialDir=NULL ;
ofna.Flags = OFN_PATHMUSTEXIST|OFN_FILEMUSTEXIST ;  

wchar_t filew[MAX_PATH] = {0};
OPENFILENAMEW ofnw = {0};
ofnw.lStructSize = sizeof ( ofnw );
ofnw.hwndOwner = NULL  ;
ofnw.lpstrFile = filew ;
ofnw.nMaxFile = MAX_PATH;
ofnw.lpstrFilter = L"All\0*.*\0Text\0*.TXT\0";
ofnw.nFilterIndex =1;
ofnw.lpstrFileTitle = NULL;
ofnw.nMaxFileTitle = 0 ;
ofnw.lpstrInitialDir=NULL ;
ofnw.Flags = OFN_PATHMUSTEXIST|OFN_FILEMUSTEXIST ;

GetOpenFileNameA(&ofna);
GetOpenFileNameW(&ofnw);
 and selecting either: C:\Temp\???\?openw.txt C:\Temp\???\?openw.txt Yields: When compiled with Unicode *filea = 43 3a 5c 54 65 6d 70 5c 83 65 83 58 83 67 5c 83 65 6f 70 65 6e 61 2e 74 78 74 == Shift-Jis (Code page 932) *filew = 43 00 3a 00 5c 00 54 00 65 00 6d 00 70 00 5c 00 c6 30 b9 30 c8 30 5c 00 c6 30 6f 00 70 00 65 00 6e 00 77 00 2e 00 74 00 78 00 74 00 == UTF-16 or UCS-2 When compiled with Multi byte character set *filea = 43 3a 5c 54 65 6d 70 5c 83 65 83 58 83 67 5c 83 65 6f 70 65 6e 61 2e 74 78 74 == Shift-Jis (Code page 932) *filew = 43 00 3a 00 5c 00 54 00 65 00 6d 00 70 00 5c 00 c6 30 b9 30 c8 30 5c 00 c6 30 6f 00 70 00 65 00 6e 00 77 00 2e 00 74 00 78 00 74 00 == UTF-16 or UCS-2 When compiled with Not Set *filea = 43 3a 5c 54 65 6d 70 5c 83 65 83 58 83 67 5c 83 65 6f 70 65 6e 61 2e 74 78 74 == Shift-Jis (Code page 932) *filew = 43 00 3a 00 5c 00 54 00 65 00 6d 00 70 00 5c 00 c6 30 b9 30 c8 30 5c 00 c6 30 6f 00 70 00 65 00 6e 00 77 00 2e 00 74 00 78 00 74 00 == UTF-16 or UCS-2 Conclusion: Again, the Character Set setting doesn't have a bearing on the behaviour of the Win32 API. The A version always seems to return a string with the encoding of the active code page and the W one always returns UTF-16 or UCS-2. I can actually see this explained a bit in this great answer: http://stackoverflow.com/a/3299860/187100. Ultimate Conculsion Hans appears to be correct when he says that the define doesn't really have any magic to it, beyond changing the Win32 APIs to use either W or A. Therefore, I can't really see any difference between Not Set and Multi byte character set.

 In Chrome you can disable plugin individually by clicking on disable individual plugin. Then if we disable plugin individually, above query works and return false. But If we block all plugin it will return true only.Hence my concern is how to detect a plugin has been blocked.

 I get an angularjs error like 'Unknown provider $cookieStore'. 'myApp' has dependenciy and 'ngCookies' and angular-cookies.min.js is laoded, so what's wrong with that code ? Is that fact that i'm doing this in .config ?
@CODE:myApp.config(['$httpProvider', function($httpProvider, $cookieStore) {

    $httpProvider.defaults.withCredentials = true;

    $httpProvider.defaults.headers.get['Authorization'] = 'Basic '+ $cookieStore.get('myToken');

    return JSON.stringify(data);

}]); myApp

@TITLE:Scala elegant list comprehension as in F#
@CONTENT:Just using the basic JDBC interface to read some data using Scala. In F# (using System.Data.SqlClient namespace) we could do something like this to return an immutable list from the database.     let rs = cmd.ExecuteReader()
    [while rs.Read() do yield rs.GetInt32(1)]
 In Scala this proves more difficult, as far as I know there is no "while" comprehension like F#. Effectively I'd like to do something close to F# in Scala without having to use mutable vars - if only because they look ugly and add to Lines of Code. Something like this seems to be commonplace in my Scala code right now:  var result = Seq.empty[Int]
 val rs = stmt.executeQuery()
 while (rs.next()) {
     result = result :+ rs.getInt(1) }
@CODE:let rs = cmd.ExecuteReader()

@TITLE:How is column width determined in browser?
@CONTENT:How is the actual width of columns in table determined? The code below looks (in Chrome) like this: My problem is that adding any more characters to the cell with "ddd..." the free space is not used, but the content of other cells gets wrapped. Sometime the problem is that texts "aaa..." and "ccc..." would not overlap. The total size of the table is fixed, but all the content is dynamic, so a fixed layout is not preferred. Update: Despite containing less text than any of the actual columns the first row (c1-c4) has quite significant (possitive) effect on the final layout. <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN">

I am trying to understand why these software is developed by Apache. I tried a lot on the internet,, but I didn't find any blog or wordpress blog, or any useful youtube video that explain all these projects. Can you explain me about these projects. Why these projects developed?

What they do ?

and more questions like this
 Previously I found the same doubt with Apache Hadoop, but all the material that I found on net is sufficient for me to get a feel of this project. This time I am struggling with Sling, Felix, Jackrabbit. I will be very thankful for you. Waiting for your kind response.

 This context file that is specified in classpath DOES NOT EXIST. I can put virtually any name I want and the code does not break. I mean the test runs just fine, as if that file really exists. If I do a small change, from : classpath* to classpath , then it beaks, saying that this file does not exist, which is the behavior I would expect in the first case also. Spring Version 3.2.3.RELEASE. Can someone explain this weird behavior? EDIT Things from logs as suggested:      20:47:26,923 INFO  [GenericApplicationContext] Refreshing org.springframework.context.support.GenericApplicationContext@3df6c65c: startup date [Fri Jun 07 20:47:26 PDT 2013]; root of context hierarchy
 I even tried to output all beans from application context:   org.springframework.context.annotation.internalConfigurationAnnotationProcessor
  org.springframework.context.annotation.internalAutowiredAnnotationProcessor
  org.springframework.context.annotation.internalRequiredAnnotationProcessor
  org.springframework.context.annotation.internalCommonAnnotationProcessor                   
  org.springframework.context.annotation.ConfigurationClassProcessor.importAwareProcessor
 Seems to me that in case of a wildcard, Spring will create a default empty Application Context
@CODE:@RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class)
 @ContextConfiguration(locations={"classpath*:/application-context-this-does-not-exist.xml"})
  public class HTMLSourceExtractorImplTest {

    @Autowired
    ApplicationContext context;

    @Test
    public void test(){
         String [] beans = context.getBeanDefinitionNames();
             for(String bean : beans){
                 System.out.println(bean);
             }
         System.out.println("Testing");
    }

@TITLE:Creating a json object using jackson
@CONTENT:How can I create a json array like the example below using jackson. I tried using ObjectMapper, but this does not seem correct.       try (DirectoryStream<Path> ds = Files.newDirectoryStream(path)) {
            for (Path file : ds) {
                System.out.println("name:"+file.getFileName()+
                        "\n"+
                        "mime:"+Files.probeContentType(file)+
                "\n"+
                "locked:"+!Files.isWritable(file));
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println(e);
        }
 Eventually I will be making a json that has the below values.  * - (int)    size    file size in b. required
 * - (int)    ts      file modification time in unix time. required
 * - (string) mime    mimetype. required for folders, others - optionally
 * - (bool)   read    read permissions. required
 * - (bool)   write   write permissions. required
 * - (bool)   locked  is object locked. optionally
 * - (bool)   hidden  is object hidden. optionally
 * - (string) alias   for symlinks - link target path relative to root path. optionally
 * - (string) target  for symlinks - link target path. optionally
 Here is an example json I was provided. "files": [

 Puts out the following json which is closer, but I can't figure out why the extra quotes before and after the {}. {"files":["{\"name\":\"32C92124-EFCF-42C1-AFD2-8B741AE6854B.jpg\"}","{\"name\":\"58D5B83F-4065-4D6E-92BE-8181D99CB6CB.jpg\"}","{\"name\":\"7B1464A0-FBA1-429E-8A39-3DE5B539FBF8.jpg\"}","{\"name\":\"888159CF-45BE-475F-8C6A-64B3E1D97278.jpg\"}"]}

@CONTENT:I have a web service controller that serves up "activity" data GET /api/activity/list

GET /api/activity/activity-slug-name
PUT /api/activity
DELETE /api/activity/1
 It also serves up some "meta" data GET /api/activity/meta/dates
GET /api/activity/meta/states
 They all work extremely well using ngResource as they all return JSON objects. However the /api/activity/meta/dates does not It returns an array of strings [
    "2013-06-02T17:05:16Z",
    "2013-06-07T17:05:16Z",
    "2013-08-17T17:05:16Z"
]
 ngResource turns this into an array of char arrays see: Invalid result from ngResource request with string array Obviously i could just split the meta functions out into some form of ActivityMetaService but i would prefer to keep it all together My question is Is there a way to stop ngResource from performing this overzealous object decomposition? Or should i rais a bug with angular? Thanks in advance * UPDATE * Thanks Mark for your comment. If you had placed it as an answer I would have accepted it, because it points to a bug in Angular and the other two answers do not fit with the current architecture. While you are technical correct, no one has though of Strings as an array of chars since the mid 80s, C/C++ programmers aside :) I have raised a ticket on github with the angular.js project, reference below https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/2664

@TITLE:How often can you update a textview without mess
@CONTENT:Suppose a textview TextView tvSum = findViewById(R.id.sumTexviewId);
 If I want to change the displayed text, I do this: tvSum.setText("?0.00");
 Now, supposing I do this regularly, say every time a button is pressed, perhaps showing the sum entered on a till. In this example, you press one, it says "1p", then you press two and it says "12p" and so on. I find that if I do this, the text becomes distorted after a while. For the sequence 12345, to start with all is good: (nothing pressed yet) ("1" pressed) (then "2" pressed) (then "3" pressed) However, after that things get messy: (then "4" pressed) (then "5" pressed) It never gets any better thereafter. I haven't posted code because the code really is very simple: a bunch of buttons and only writing one short string to one textview - nothing in the code should cause this, honest. (Yes, I've checked the string being written is correct by putting it up on Toast.) Has anyone else come across this, and if so what resolved it?

 When I run the app, I can see my rows however since my list is long and has over 200 items when i goto middle of list and click an item then returned position is wrong (it's something like 7, sometimes 4 and etc.). Now what is the mystery? If I active on item listener of list from my fragment and click on row then correct row position will be displayed while on that row if I click on button then wrong position will be displayed. listView.setOnItemClickListener(new AdapterView.OnItemClickListener() {
            @Override
            public void onItemClick(AdapterView<?> parent, View view, int position, long id) {
                Log.e(TAG, "item " + position + " clicked.");
            }
        });
 Result in logcat: 05-09 10:22:25.228: E/AddFriendsFragment(20296): item 109 clicked.

@LINK:/questions/16449813/play-audio-from-firefox-extensions-data-directory
@TITLE:Play audio from firefox extension's data directory
@CONTENT:I'm making a Firefox extension and I'm failing to play a sound that's located in add-on's data directory. The first thing I've tried was playing it in a content script this way: var soundFile = self.options.soundFile;
(new Audio(soundFile)).play();
 where self.options.soundFile is an option that refers to a resource file in data directory. But I meet security restrictions: Security Error: Content at http://example.com may not load or link to resource://jid0-a02no8rrtu2pbize7g7sszzo0z8-at-jetpack/stackoverflow-reiew-helper/data/complete.oga.
 Then I've found a way to play sounds in main.js script (here: How to play audio in an extension?): var data = require('sdk/self').data;

exports.main = function() {
        var {Cc, Ci} = require("chrome");
        var sound = Cc["@mozilla.org/sound;1"].createInstance(Ci.nsISound);
        sound.play(data.url('complete.oga'));
};
 This one fails with the following exception: NS_ERROR_XPC_BAD_CONVERT_JS: Could not convert JavaScript argument arg 0 [nsISound.play]

@TITLE:Durandal Multiple Master Pages
@CONTENT:I am working on a SPA that I would like to use multiple master views. Here is my use case: I have a user that has a profile page. Within that profile page I would like to be able to display a couple of different views, ie. details, works, contact info, etc. I need to be able to deep link to each of these views. Each of these views must display the basic user data from the master layout view. It is my understanding that I should be using compose for this and I have a bit of code that seems to work, however, I want to be able to pass data from the "secondary shell" down to the actual sub view. It seems that the splat data is not passed along to the activate method of the sub viewmodel. In my "master" viewmodel I have created an observable called activeView that contains a string corresponding to a sub viewmodel (viewmodels/user/details). I then have a knockout statement that is as follows: <!-- ko compose: {
    model: activeView(),        
    activate: true
} --><!-- /ko -->
 How can I pass data to the sub view? Or is there a better way to do this? Thanks in advance!

    model: activeView(),        
    activate: true

@TITLE:Making image positioned on textbox clickable in case of ipad (Creating HTML5 Search input type for iOS)
@CONTENT:I am trying to simulate the HTML5 input type='search' using javascript. My aim is to make something like this: First of all, I will specify why I did not use HTML5 Search input type directly. In case of iPad, the mentioned input type shows the rounded corner textbox and all other features required for a native Search Input box look alike of iOS except for the small cross (x) icon on the corner of the textbox when user types in some text into the search box. I tried everything - Putting input type search into a <form>, repositioning the type='search', etc. None seems to bring in the desired effect (only when the app is deployed on ipad - webview or mobile browser). So, I've simulated the widget using a cross icon and selectively showing/hiding it based on the content inside the search box. It works fine in all versions of desktop Safari (switching through Developer tools). However, when I try on iPad, typing inside the search box shows the cross icon as desired, but doesnt allow the touch event to be registered on it. I also know the reason for this, since the on-screen keyboard is active when user is typing, the next touch event is prevented on the search text box. Due to this, the touch on cross icon is also prevented. My code is as follows: The HTML looks like this : <form id="searchForm">
    <div>
        <input type="search" id="searchBox">
        <a id="cross_icon" >
            <img src="search.png">
        </a>
    </div>
</form>
 The jquery code looks like this: //This function will be triggered on keyup event on searchBox
showXIcon : function(){
                var search = $('#searchBox').val();
                if(search.replace(/\s/g, "") === "") {
                   $('#cross_icon').hide();
                } else {
                   $('#cross_icon').show();
                }


            },
//this function will be called on click on cross_icon
clearSearchBox: function(){
            $('#searchBox').val('');
            $('#cross_icon').hide();
        },
 Is there a way to allow touch event on cross icon without explicitely blurring the on-screen keyboard ? Any other way or workaround?
@CODE:input type='search' <form> type='search' desktop Safari <form id="searchForm">
    <div>
        <input type="search" id="searchBox">
        <a id="cross_icon" >
            <img src="search.png">
        </a>
    </div>
</form> //This function will be triggered on keyup event on searchBox
showXIcon : function(){
                var search = $('#searchBox').val();
                if(search.replace(/\s/g, "") === "") {
                   $('#cross_icon').hide();
                } else {
                   $('#cross_icon').show();
                }


            },
//this function will be called on click on cross_icon
clearSearchBox: function(){
            $('#searchBox').val('');
            $('#cross_icon').hide();

@LINK:/questions/16366059/best-way-to-override-matlabs-default-static-javaclasspath
@TITLE:Best way to override MATLAB's default static javaclasspath
@CONTENT:MATLAB is configured to search its static java class path before searching the user-modifiable dynamic path. Unfortunately, the static path contains quite a number of very old public libraries, so if you are trying to use a new version you may end up loading the wrong implementation and get errors. For instance, the static path contains an old copy of the google-collections.jar, which has long been supplanted by Google's guava library and which has some of the same class names (e.g. com.google.common.base.Objects). As a result, if you invoke a Guava method that uses a newer method of one of such a class, you will end up getting surprising NoSuchMethodErrors because the google-collections jar is found first. As of R2012b, MATLAB lets you specify additional jars to add to the static path by putting a javaclasspath.txt file in your preferences folder, but that adds jars to the end of the path, and doesn't let you override jars that are built into MATLAB. So what is the best way around this?

@TITLE:How to transfer resource files with Static Library (How to wrap resources in bundle)?
@CONTENT:I'm creating a Static Library for iOS applications. I almost completed it, but there is an issue with the resources. My Static Library uses a lot of images and sound files. How can I transfer it with my Static Library ? I know we can wrap it on a bundle and give it along the .a file. But I don't know how to wrap Images and sound files in a Bundle file. What I did: I searched a lot, but couldn't find any useful links. I got Conceptual CFBundles reference, but didn't find any solution for my problem. I checked the file templates available for XCode, but didn't saw any bundle type other than Settings Bundle.

@LINK:/questions/16291809/openssl-programatically-verify-certificate-chain-in-c-in-memory-certs
@TITLE:OpenSSL programatically verify certificate chain in C (in-memory certs)
@CONTENT:This is very similar to other questions but the ones I've looked at either don't have an answer or don't quite ask the same question. I have a self-signed CA certificate, and two other certificates that are signed with that CA certificate. I'm fairly sure the certificates are correct, because 'openssl verify' works: $ openssl verify -CAfile ca.pem server.pem
server.pem: OK
 (The above is from memory, I don't have them in front of me, so it may be slightly off). Now I want to verify the certificates programatically. I have a utility function with pseudocode below: int verify_cert(X509 *cert, X509 *cacert)
{
     int ret;
     X509_STORE *store;
     X509_STORE_CTX *ctx;

     store = X509_STORE_new();
     X590_STORE_add_cert(store, cacert);

     ctx = X509_STORE_CTX_new();
     X509_STORE_CTX_init(ctx, store, cert, NULL);

     ret = X590_verify_cert(ctx);

     /* check for errors and clean up */
}
 My problem is that the above code always returns 'failed to find issuer certificate'. What have I done wrong? I believe I am creating a new store, adding the cacert, creating a new context, and adding the child cert to be verified to the context with a pointer to the store which contains the CA. I'm pretty obviously doing something wrong, but I'm unsure what. Any ideas? Update: I'm aware I can save these certs to disk and use something like X509_LOOKUP_file or something similar. I'm looking for a solution that doesn't touch the disk unnecessarily.
@CODE:$ openssl verify -CAfile ca.pem server.pem
server.pem: OK int verify_cert(X509 *cert, X509 *cacert)
{
     int ret;
     X509_STORE *store;
     X509_STORE_CTX *ctx;

     store = X509_STORE_new();
     X590_STORE_add_cert(store, cacert);

     ctx = X509_STORE_CTX_new();
     X509_STORE_CTX_init(ctx, store, cert, NULL);

     ret = X590_verify_cert(ctx);

But the problem is when I have got onLoadingComplete() of Universal Image Loader, the ImageView is not invalidated neither automatically nor manually. Next time if I click on the same Marker, image will be displayed from Cache of Universal Image Loader. Below is my CustomInfoWindowAdapter code : private class CustomInfoWindowAdapter implements InfoWindowAdapter {

        render(marker, mWindow);
        return mWindow;
    }

    private void render(final Marker marker, View view) {

        final String url = markers.get(marker.getId()).getStrProfilePic();

                    ((ImageView) view).invalidate();
                }
            });
        } else {

@TITLE:Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64 error when linking OpenCV in Xcode
@CONTENT:I have a problem linking OpenCV in Xcode. I installed OpenCV using brew: brew tap homebrew/science
sudo brew install opencv
 I started a new Xcode commandline project, added /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/include to library and header search path. I also added the output of pkg-config --libs opencv to other linker options. But when I try to compile this small sample program: #include <opencv2/core/core.hpp>
#include <opencv2/highgui/highgui.hpp>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    cv::Mat test;
    cv::namedWindow( "Display window", CV_WINDOW_AUTOSIZE );// Create a window for display.
    cv::waitKey(0);                                          // Wait for a keystroke in the window
    return 0;
} 
 i get the following linker error: Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64:
  "cv::namedWindow(std::__1::basic_string<char, std::__1::char_traits<char>, std::__1::allocator<char> > const&, int)", referenced from:
      _main in main.o
ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64
 But I am able to compile the program on the command line using g++ `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv` prog.cpp
 So I think the problem is the way Xcode is set up. But I am not able to determine what exactly is different between the way Xcode compiles and my commandline argument. Does anyone know the reason for this error or has an idea what I could try to investigate the problem?
@CODE:brew tap homebrew/science

@TITLE:Passing arguments to Maven release build
@CONTENT:I'm trying to release a library using Maven and perform a site-deploy to sourceforge (I have create an interactive shell first). The release is done by a Jenkins job (using the Maven Release Plugin for Jenkins). I tried: -X -e -Dresume=false -Dusername=puce release:prepare release:perform -Darguments="-Dusername=puce"
 and -X -e -Dresume=false -Dusername=puce -Darguments=-Dusername=puce release:prepare release:perform
 but both times the job hangs at site:deploy of the first module:  [INFO] --- maven-site-plugin:3.2:deploy (default-deploy) @ myproject-parent ---
 [INFO] Parent project loaded from repository: myGroupId:myOtherproject-parent:pom:1.0
 [INFO] Parent project loaded from repository: myGroupId:myOtherproject-parent:pom:1.0
 Using private key: /opt/jenkins/.ssh/id_dsa
 When I stop the job, the following gets printed at end: Password for ${username}@shell.sourceforge.net: channel stopped
 which probably means that ${username} wasn't resolved. How can I resolve the ${username}? Edit: Note that the following runs fine: site-deploy -Psonatype-oss-release -Dusername=puce
 Edit 2: As part of release:perform maven executes the following command: /usr/share/maven/bin/mvn -s /tmp/release-settings7797889802430474959.xml deploy site-deploy --no-plugin-updates --batch-mode -Psonatype-oss-release -P nexus -f pom.xml
 -Dusername=puce doesn't seem to get passed to this maven command... Also note that help:effective-pom shows the following maven-release-plugin configuration: <plugin>
  <artifactId>maven-release-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>2.2.2</version>

 So 'arguments' gets defined and its value seems to reach the embedded maven command instead of the value passed on the command line...

@TITLE:Smart pointer wrapping penalty. Memoization with std::map
@CONTENT:I am currently in the middle of a project where performance is of vital importance. Following are some of the questions I had regarding this issue. Question1 My project involves plenty of boost::shared_ptr.I know creating shared pointers on the run using boost::make_shared is slow since there is a lot of overhead as it needs to track references.I wanted to know what if the boost shared pointers are already created then would these two statements have the same performance or would one be faster than the other. If the regular pointers are faster and I already have shared pointers what options do I have in order to call a method that the shared pointer points to ?  statement1: sharedptr->someMethod();  //here the pointer is a shared ptr created by boost::make_shared
 statement2: regularptr->someMethod(); //here the pointer is a regular one made with new
 Question 2 I have an instance method(s) that is rapidly called that creates a std::vector<std::string> on the stack every time. I decided to store that vector pointer in a static std::map (i.e) std::map<std::String,std::vector<std::string>*>. If a vector does not exist in the map for the key(which could be the name of the method). The valid vector address is created and added to the map.So my question is "is it worth searching a map for a vector address and returning back a valid address over just creating one on the stack like std::vector<std::string> somevector. I would also like an idea on the performance of std::map find. Any ideas regarding these concern would be appreciated.

 My manipulation on this XML depends on if <PolNumber> (its an optional element in schema) has a value or not. I'm using Mule 3.3 xpath evaluator to do this and my xpath looks this: <expression-filter expression="#[xpath('//acord:Holding/acord:Policy/acord:PolNumber').text != empty]"/> 
 This works fine as long as <PolNumber> element is present or <PolNumber/> is empty element. But if <PolNumber> is absent, above expression throws exception. I tried using xpath boolean function but it returns true for <PolNumber/>. Is there a better way of checking if an element is present and non-empty?

@LINK:/questions/15850112/redis-how-to-parse-a-list-result
@TITLE:Redis: How to parse a list result
@CONTENT:I am storing a list in Redis like this: redis.lpush('foo', [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9])
 And then I get the list back like this: redis.lrange('foo', 0, -1)
 and I get something like this: [b'[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]']
 How can I convert this to actual Python list? Also, I don't see anything defined in RESPONSE_CALLBACKS that can help? Am I missing something? A possible solution (which in my opinion sucks) can be: result = redis.lrange('foo',0, -1)[0].decode()

result = result.strip('[]')

result = result.split(', ')

# lastly, if you know all your items in the list are integers
result = [int(x) for x in result]
 UPDATE Ok, so I got the solution. Actually, the lpush function expects all the list items be passed as arguments and NOT as a single list. The function signature from redis-py source makes it clear... def lpush(self, name, *values):
    "Push ``values`` onto the head of the list ``name``"
    return self.execute_command('LPUSH', name, *values)
 What I am doing above is send a single list as an argument, which is then sent to redis as a SINGLE item. I should be unpacking the list instead as suggested in the answer: redis.lpush('foo', *[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9])
 which returns the result I expect... redis.lrange('foo', 0, -1)
[b'9', b'8', b'7', b'6', b'5', b'4', b'3', b'2', b'1']
@CODE:redis.lpush('foo', [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]) redis.lrange('foo', 0, -1) [b'[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]'] RESPONSE_CALLBACKS result = redis.lrange('foo',0, -1)[0].decode()

result = result.strip('[]')

This is immensely useful to me to ensure type compatibility especially when I am trying new things out. Is there a similar feature in IntelliJ Idea 12.1 (the latest version as of this comment)? The closest thing I could find was the type info setting. The default key binding did not even work for me on Mac OS 10.7.5. Even after tweaking, it does not work as universally as it does in Eclipse which shows a type for pretty much everything. Has any one managed to get this to work? My ideal setting would be type info on hover just like in the Eclipse. I have heard great things about the IntelliJ IDE for Scala but so far the Eclipse Scala plugin wins hands down.

@TITLE:Fastest way to count number of 1s in a register, ARM assembly
@CONTENT:So I had an interview question before regarding bit manipulation. The company is a well known GPU company. I had very little background in assembly language (weird despite being a phd student in computer architecture) and as this narrative would indicate, I botched it. The question was a simple: "Write a fast code that will count the number of 1's in a 32-bit register." Now I am in the process of studying arm assembly. So naturally I revisited this problem again and have come up with this code just by studying the ISA. For you arm experts out there, is this correct? Is there a faster way to do this? Being a beginner, I naturally think this is incomplete. The AND instruction in "xx" feels redundant but there is no other way to shift a register in ARM isa... R1 will contain the number of bits at the end while R2 is the register with bits we want to count. r6 is just a dummy register. Comments are enclosed in ()     MOV   R1, #0                (initialize R1 and R6 to zero)
    MOV   R6, #0

@TITLE:PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA-512 test vectors
@CONTENT:I have not been able to find published test vectors for PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA-512. I've built a function that (finally!) reproduces the 7 HMAC-SHA-512 test vectors in RFC 4231, and the 32-byte test vectors for PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA-256 found in this thread. Here is what it generates for PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA-512. Can anyone help me verify this output? Thanks, Fred Input:

@LINK:/questions/15524902/recursive-function-for-trees-in-python
@TITLE:Recursive function for trees in Python
@CONTENT:I'm trying to make a function in Python, that takes an arbitrary node of a tree, and populates a list of lists based on the node give. Given the following badly drawn tree: If we start at, for example, node 5, we should get: A list containing all nodes with the same parent node, including the one we started at (4 and 5) Any child nodes, but not their children (6). Parent nodes and any parent nodes with the same parent, and their parent's nodes, etc. until we get to the root node, but not including the root node (just 2 and 3 in this case, but if the tree was deeper and we started lower, there'd be more here. And the nodes should end up in a list of lists, one list for each depth. The nodes in python: nodes = [
    {'id': 1, 'parent': None},
    {'id': 2, 'parent': 1},
    {'id': 3, 'parent': 1},
    {'id': 4, 'parent': 2},
    {'id': 5, 'parent': 2},
    {'id': 6, 'parent': 5},
    {'id': 7, 'parent': 6},
    {'id': 8, 'parent': 3}
]
 We can only see parents, not children, but this is the data format I have to work with, sadly. So from this, if we take node 5, we want to end up with a node list looking something like this: nl = [
    [{'id': 6, 'parent': 5}],
    [{'id': 4, 'parent': 2}, {'id': 5, 'parent': 2}],
    [{'id': 2, 'parent': 1}, {'id': 3, 'parent': 1}],
]
 This is the code I have so far. I figure a recursive function is probably the simplest way. Unfortunately it seems to do nothing like what I think it should, and obviously I'm doing something very wrong. And this code doesn't even consider geting the child nodes which I'm not entirely sure how to deal with at all, apart from possibly handing the afterwards which would be much easier. node_list = []

def pop_list(nodes=None, parent=None, node_list=None):
    if parent is None:
        return node_list
    node_list.append([])
    for node in nodes:
        if node['parent'] == parent:
            node_list[-1].append(node)
        if node['id'] == parent:
            parent = node['parent']
    return pop_list(nodes, parent, node_list)

print pop_list(nodes, 5, node_list)
 Here is the output: [[], [{'id': 3, 'parent': 1}], []]
 Not exactly sure where I'm going wrong here.
@CODE:nodes = [
    {'id': 1, 'parent': None},
    {'id': 2, 'parent': 1},
    {'id': 3, 'parent': 1},
    {'id': 4, 'parent': 2},

    {'id': 6, 'parent': 5},
    {'id': 7, 'parent': 6},
    {'id': 8, 'parent': 3}
] nl = [
    [{'id': 6, 'parent': 5}],
    [{'id': 4, 'parent': 2}, {'id': 5, 'parent': 2}],
    [{'id': 2, 'parent': 1}, {'id': 3, 'parent': 1}],
] node_list = []

def pop_list(nodes=None, parent=None, node_list=None):
    if parent is None:
        return node_list

@LINK:/questions/15397515/stringbuilder-vs-concat-vs-operator-relative-performance-different-in-ecl
@TITLE:StringBuilder vs. .concat vs. ¡§+¡¨ Operator relative performance different in eclipse than command line?
@CONTENT:I was reading about how when possible the java compiler will compile strings concatenated with the "+" operator into instances of StringBuilder, and how this makes it better to use the simple "+" operator since they compile to the same code. (Except when you are building the string in a while loop, in which case it is clearly best to use a StringBuilder.) I've also read that the .concat method on strings is the worst choice all the time (so much so that it was made into a bug by Findbugs!). So I decided to test it myself writing a little java class in eclipse. My results surprised me a bit. What I found was that different methods were relatively faster or slower if I complied and ran them in eclipse vs. on the command line. First my eclipse results were: the total millis to concatenate with + was: 12154
the total millis to concatenate with .concat was: 8840
the total millis to concatenate with StringBuilder was: 11350
the total millis to concatenate with StringBuilder with a specified size was: 5611
 So in eclipse StringBuilder with the size specified was fastest, followed by .concat (weird), then StringBuilder and "+" concatenation were pretty much the same. My results on the command line, however, were: the total millis to concatenate with + was: 4139
the total millis to concatenate with .concat was: 8590
the total millis to concatenate with StringBuilder was: 10888
the total millis to concatenate with StringBuilder with a specified size was: 6033
 So when I compiled and ran from the commnad line the "+" operator was clearly the fastest, followed by String builder with size, then concat, and last was normal StringBuilder! This doesn't make sense to me. Obviously all the stackoverflow answers I read saying that + operators compile into normal old StringBuilder instances must be outdated. Does anyone know what's really going on here? I'm using jdk1.7.0_07, and so far as I can tell both eclipse and my command line are referencing the exact same one. The only difference I know of is eclipse is using "javaw", but from what I've read, that shouldn't make a difference. Here's my test class if you want to verify I'm not doing anything wrong, but I'm pretty sure it's solid. public class Test {

    static final int LOOPS = 100000000;
    static final String FIRST_STRING = "This is such";
    static final String SECOND_STRING = " an awesomely cool ";
    static final String THIRD_STRING = "to write string.";

@CONTENT:I have the following select statement, to grab the next scheduled item for a stream. If there is no matching row, I want it to return a default value. Here's the line I'm using: SELECT `file` FROM `show`, `schedule`

   AND `start_time` > UNIX_TIMESTAMP()-1800 AND `show`.`id` = `schedule`.`file`

 That should grab the most recently scheduled item, but not if it's older than 30 minutes before the query. However, if the user doesn't schedule anything, I want a default value, so that something actually plays on the stream. I've tried the following: SELECT COALESCE(`file`, 'default.webm') FROM `show`, `schedule`...
 And: SELECT IFNULL(`file`, 'default.webm') FROM `show`, `schedule`
 However, it always returns an empty result if no rows are found. How can I return a default value instead?

 bool comes back false every time. The file path/name is as it should be ("storage/emulated/0/Pictures/barry.png") for User #0 and the directory Pictures is there. What can make imwrite return false? I could convert the mat to a bmp and save it myself (which I do elsewhere in a non-OpenCV app) but since Highgui.imwrite is there, and this code used to work when I was writing to 2.4.0 and testing on Android 3.x, I'd like to use it if I can. Many thanks Baz

@TITLE:Consuming a multipart/form-data via RESTful CXF
@CONTENT:I've been working in a webservice that consumes and produces JSON files using Apache CXF in conjuction with Jackson. However, one of the service's methods should be able to save an uploaded image from a mobile application that makes a multipart/form-data POST request to my webservice, and I don't know how to treat this kind of content-type within my context. We usually create "Request" and "Response" objects to consume and produce the JSON, however, I'm afraid this would not work for this case. This is the Request format: Content-type: multipart/form-data
"Description": text/plain
"Path": text/plain
"Image": image/jpeg
 How to correctly consume this kind of request and save the image server-side? [EDIT] I managed to consume multipart/form-data by using this: public returnType savePicture(
                @Multipart(value = "mode", type = "text/plain") String mode,
                @Multipart(value = "type", type = "text/plain") String type,
                @Multipart(value = "path", type = "text/plain") String path
                @Multipart(value = "image", type = "image/jpeg") Attachment image
            ) 
    {
 However, when trying to consume the following POST request: Content-type: multipart/form-data, boundary=AaB03x

--AaB03x
content-disposition: form-data; name="mode"

T
--AaB03x
content-disposition: form-data; name="type"

 I'm getting the following error: javax.ws.rs.BadRequestException: org.apache.cxf.jaxrs.utils.multipart.MultipartReadException: No multipart with content id type found, request content type : multipart/form-data;boundary=AaB03x When I consume only mode, for instance, it works fine.

@TITLE:AudioTrack - short array to byte array distortion using jlayer(java mp3 decoder)
@CONTENT:I'm using jLayer to decode MP3 data, with this call: SampleBuffer output = (SampleBuffer) decoder.decodeFrame(frameHeader, bitstream);
 This call which returns the decoded data, returns an array of short[]. output.getBuffer(); When I call AudioTrack write() with that method, it plays fine as I loop through the file: at.write(output.getBuffer(), 0, output.getBuffer().length);
 However, when I convert the short[] array to byte[] array using any of the methods in this answer: http://stackoverflow.com/a/12347176/1176436 the sound gets distorted and jittery: at.write(output.getBuffer(), 0, output.getBuffer().length);
 becomes: byte[] array = ShortToByte_Twiddle_Method(output.getBuffer());
at.write(array,  0,  array.length);
 Am I doing anything wrong and what can I do to fix it? Unfortunately I need the pcm data to be in a byte array for another 3rd party library I'm using. The file is 22kHz if that matters and this is how at is being instantiated: at = new AudioTrack(AudioManager.STREAM_MUSIC, 22050, AudioFormat.CHANNEL_OUT_STEREO,
                AudioFormat.ENCODING_PCM_16BIT, 10000 /* 10 second buffer */,
                AudioTrack.MODE_STREAM);   
 Thank you so much in advance. Edit: This is how I'm instantiating the AudioTrack variable now. So for 44kHz files, the value that is getting sent is 44100, while for 22kHz files, the value is 22050. at = new AudioTrack(AudioManager.STREAM_MUSIC, decoder.getOutputFrequency(), 
                                  decoder.getOutputChannels() > 1 ? AudioFormat.CHANNEL_OUT_STEREO : AudioFormat.CHANNEL_OUT_MONO,
                                  AudioFormat.ENCODING_PCM_16BIT, 10000 /* 10 second buffer */,
                                  AudioTrack.MODE_STREAM);

at.write(array,  0,  array.length); at = new AudioTrack(AudioManager.STREAM_MUSIC, 22050, AudioFormat.CHANNEL_OUT_STEREO,
                AudioFormat.ENCODING_PCM_16BIT, 10000 /* 10 second buffer */,
                AudioTrack.MODE_STREAM); at = new AudioTrack(AudioManager.STREAM_MUSIC, decoder.getOutputFrequency(), 
                                  decoder.getOutputChannels() > 1 ? AudioFormat.CHANNEL_OUT_STEREO : AudioFormat.CHANNEL_OUT_MONO,
                                  AudioFormat.ENCODING_PCM_16BIT, 10000 /* 10 second buffer */,
                                  AudioTrack.MODE_STREAM); public byte[] decode(InputStream inputStream, int startMs, int maxMs) throws IOException {

        float totalMs = 0;
        boolean seeking = true;

        try {
            Bitstream bitstream = new Bitstream(inputStream);

            boolean done = false;
            while (!done) {
                Header frameHeader = bitstream.readFrame();

                        short[] pcm = output.getBuffer();
                        for (short s : pcm) {

@CONTENT:I've seen differences of opinion across the web on this. It has been said that starting with iOS 5.1, local data storage for HTML5 content on the iPad is no longer guaranteed to be persistent, however on Apple's current Safari developer pages (https://developer.apple.com/technologies/safari/html5.html), offline persistence is suggested to be guaranteed. Does anyone have any recent experience with this subject and able to comment on how reliable the database features of HTML5 are with Safari on iPad?

@TITLE:Change culture based on a link MVC4
@CONTENT:I have a curiosity related to culture change in MVC. I tried in 2 ways, but apparently I was wrong somewhere. In my Web.config I have :  <globalization uiCulture="auto" culture="auto" />
 This is how I tried to change the thread culture :  <li>@Html.ActionLink("Eng", "ChangeCulture", "Home", new { lang="en-US"}, new { @class = "languageSelectorEnglish" })</li>
 First method I have the following controller :     public void ChangeCulture(string lang)

        Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture = CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo(lang);

        langCookie.Value = lang;
        langCookie.Expires = System.DateTime.Now.AddDays(21);
        Response.Cookies.Add(langCookie);

        Response.Redirect(Request.UrlReferrer.ToString());
    }
 Second method     public ActionResult ChangeCulture(string lang)
    {
        Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture = CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo(lang);
        Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture = CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo(lang);

        // Split the url to url + query string
        var fullUrl= Request.UrlReferrer.ToString();
        var questionMarkIndex = fullUrl.IndexOf('?');
        string queryString = null;
        string url = fullUrl;
        if (questionMarkIndex != -1) // There is a QueryString
        {
            url = fullUrl.Substring(0, questionMarkIndex);
            queryString = fullUrl.Substring(questionMarkIndex + 1);
        }

        // Arranges
        var request = new HttpRequest(null, url, queryString);

 This action receives a movie model and updates it in the database. But I can't figure out how. The movie object isn't attached to the db, so how does entity framework know which row in the db should be updaed? I am sure that the Entry method has something to do with it, but I don't really know what this method does. I read that it provies information but I cannot understand how by just changing the State of an entry it becomes attached and tracked by the DBContext.

@CONTENT:Emacs has an optional undo-tree. You can cursor to each node, and hit return to go back in time, even along branches. Is there something similar for git, which can be accessed within the Terminal (not Emacs). So, within a git project, I could type a command and it would show the tree. I could cursor around, going back in time or even switching to another branch, then hit return and it would checkout that particular commit's whole state.

                </tbody>
            </table>
 In my view model I've the following function which I use to sort a data table using the table header. ViewModel: self.deptList = ko.observableArray(mylist);
self.sortColumn = ko.observable("id");
self.isSortAsc = ko.observable("True");

var Dept = function (id, name, description) {
            this.id = ko.observable(id);
            this.name = ko.observable(name);
            this.description = ko.observable(description);
           };

var mylist = [
            new Dept(1, "Dept 1", "D1"),
            new Dept(2, "Dept 2", "D6"),
            new Dept(3, "Dept 3", "D3"),
            new Dept(4, "Dept 4", "D4")];


self.sortFunction = function (data, event) {

                if(self.sortColum === event.target.id)
                    self.isSortAsc = !self.isSortAsc;
                else
                {
                    self.sortColumn = event.target.id;
                    self.isSortAsc = "True";
                }               


                self.deptList.sort(function (a, b) {
                      if(self.sortColum === 'id')
                      {
                           if(self.isSortAsc)
                              a.id < b.id ? -1 : 1;
                           else
                              a.name < b.name ? 1 : -1;
                      }

                           if(self.isSortAsc)
                              a.name < b.name ? -1 : 1;
                           else
                              a.name < b.name ? 1 : -1;
                      }
                      else (self.sortColum === 'description'){
                           if(self.isSortAsc)
                              a.description < b.description ? -1 : 1;
                           else
                              a.description < b.description ? 1 : -1;
                      }

                });

            };
 Even though above code is working I think there should be a better way to do this (I mean passing the column id as a parameter) which will be useful when there is a large of columns. I tried: left[self.sortColumn] < right[self.sortColumn] ? -1 : 1 which didn't function as expected. If it is possible to sort via a dynamic column name please show a sample code. Thanks in advance.

@CONTENT:My dev server is Debian Squeeze and I'm running Gearman 1.1.5 which I compiled from source along with the php pecl extension v1.1.1 If I run the reverse_client.php script I get the GEARMAN_COULD_NOT_CONNECT error. PHP Warning: GearmanClient::do(): send_packet(GEARMAN_COULD_NOT_CONNECT) Failed to send server-options packet -> libgearman/connection.cc:430 in /home/bealers/build/gearman-1.1.1/examples/reverse_client.php on line 26 There are a few similar posts on here about this and they all point to GM not running. It is definitely running. I'm starting it with these params: PARAMS="--queue-type=MySQL --mysql-db=test_db --mysql-user=gearman --mysql-password=gearman" If I drop the gearman_queue table in test_db then restart the daemon the table is recreated, so its mysql connection is fine and it's clearly starting. I can also telnet to 4730 on localhost, so there's no firewall issue. Initially GM had problems starting because it was starting before mysql, so I edited the init script ### BEGIN INIT INFO
# Provides:          gearman-job-server
# Required-Start:    $network $remote_fs $syslog mysql
 and an update-rd.c gearman-job-server defaults sets it to start after and it starts fine on boot up now. The only other thing I can think of is that initially I'd installed via apt but the version was to old so I removed it and compiled from source. /usr/sbin/gearmand no longer exists the only version is /usr/local/sbin/gearmand ps ax | grep gearman shows only one process running. Netstat shows only one process running` tcp 0 0 *:4730 *:* LISTEN 2325/gearmand The PECL lib seems fine: php -i | grep gearman /etc/php5/cli/conf.d/gearman.ini,

@TITLE:Why is this grouping operator + function immediately invoked
@CONTENT:I'am studying the behaviour of Immediatly Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE) and while doing that I encounterd the following situation. (function () {
    document.write("bar");
})

(function () {
    document.write("foo");
}());
 I thought that the first is just a grouping operator with a function expression inside without calling it. The second is a grouping operator as well with a function expression but now with the call of that function. What I find strange is that both are invoked, why is that? (function () {
    document.write("bar");
})

var x = 1;

(function () {
    document.write("foo");
}());
 When I break the two by inserting a variable declaration in between, it's just writes foo. This is what I expected.
@CODE:(function () {
    document.write("bar");

(function () {
    document.write("foo");

@TITLE:What's the fastest/most efficient way to count lines in Rebol?
@CONTENT:Given a string string, what is the fastest/most-efficient way to count lines therein? Will accept best answers for any flavour of Rebol. I've been working under the assumption that the parse [some [thru]] combination was the fastest way to traverse a string, but then I don't know that for certain, hence turning to SO: count-lines: func [string [string!] /local count][
    parse/all string [
        (count: 1) some [thru newline (count: count + 1)]
    ]
    count
]
 Or: count-lines: func [string [string!] /local count][
    count: 0
    until [
        count: count + 1
        not string: find/tail string newline
    ]
    count
]
 And how about counters? How efficient is repeat? count-lines: func [string [string!]][
    repeat count length? string [
        unless string: find/tail string newline [
            break/return count
        ]
    ]
]
 Update: line count goes by the Text Editor principle: An empty document still has a line count of one. So: >> count-lines ""
== 1
>> count-lines "^/"
== 2

@TITLE:smoothing between pixels of imagesc\imshow in matlab like the matplotlib imshow
@CONTENT:When I use matplotlib's imshow() in python to represent a small matrix, it produces a some sort if smoothing between pixels. Is there any way to have this in Matlab when using imshow or imagesc? For example, using matplotlib this is the output of the identity matrix imshow(eye(3)): while in matlab, imagesc(eye(3)): A solution I can think of is to extrapolate and smooth using some filter, but that won't be relevant for the single pixel levels. I've also tried myaa and export_fig, but they are not satisfactory. Myaa is taking all GUI usabily after being applied, so I can't zoom in or out, and export_fig makes me save the figure to a file and then operate on that file, too cumbersome. So, is there a way to tell the figure engine of matlab (java or what not) to do this smoothing while keeping the nice usability of the figure GUI?

@TITLE:all of my browsers are not sending the origin header
@CONTENT:I am trying to load an image into a canvas element and later pull the data out in toDataURL(). I have my site running with Ruby on Rails 2.3 I have my images serving from aws s3. I have setup cors: <CORSConfiguration xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
  <CORSRule>
    <AllowedOrigin>*</AllowedOrigin>
    <AllowedMethod>GET</AllowedMethod>
    <AllowedMethod>HEAD</AllowedMethod>
    <MaxAgeSeconds>3000</MaxAgeSeconds>
    <AllowedHeader>*</AllowedHeader>
  </CORSRule>
</CORSConfiguration>
 I have a canvas element: <canvas id="explain_canvas"></canvas>
 Okay, so some background. I was originally trying this with code like this where drawing_image is just a url to the image. var outlineImage = new Image();
outlineImage.crossOrigin = '';
outlineImage.src = drawing_image;
outlineImage.onload = function() {
  var canvas = document.getElementById('explain_canvas');
  var context = canvas.getContext("2d");
  context.drawImage(outlineImage, 10, 10, 600, 150);
}
 But that was not sending the origin header. So I thought I'd try an ajax call via jquery var outlineImage = new Image();
$(outlineImage).attr('crossOrigin', '');
$.ajax({
    type: 'get',
    url : drawing_image,
    contentType: 'image/png',
    crossDomain: 'true',
    success: function() {
        $(outlineImage).attr("src", drawing_image);
    },
    error: function() {
        console.log('ah crap');
    }
});

outlineImage.onload = function() {
 var canvas = document.getElementById('explain_canvas');
 var context = canvas.getContext("2d");

 context.drawImage(outlineImage, 10, 10, 600, 150);
}
 But still no luck. Am I mistaken? Should that jquery ajax send the origin header? I look at the request header and this is what I get on the image: Accept:*/*

 And the jquery errors with this: XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://em2-images.s3.amazonaws.com/EM2_LF_A_5_item6.png. Origin http://localhost:3000 is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
ah crap
 What is weird to me is the jquery states the origin, yet it is not in the request header. This stackoverflow question here states he wants to remove the origin header. Well he is doing the same kind of call I am with jquery ajax and getting it. Any ideas why I am not? If I reload the page, it grabs the cached image and loads it fine (with the origin header mind you) and calls toDataURL() just fine. After I clear the cache it again won't work that first load until the image is cached. I started wondering if Rails was doing something to it, but I don't see how it would since this is an ajax call. But who knows, anyone know if Rails could do this? I have tried this in several browsers on different platforms. Chrome, Firefox, Safari, IE 9 & 10. On my Mac, PC, and iPhone. No dice on any of them. -Thanks-

@TITLE:Convert a classpath filename to a real filename
@CONTENT:How would I convert the name of a file on the classpath to a real filename? For example, let's say the directory "C:\workspace\project\target\classes" is on your classpath. Within that directory is a file, such as info.properties. How would you determine (at runtime) the absolute file path to the info.properties file, given only the string "info.properties"? The result would be something like "C:\workspace\project\target\classes\info.properties". Why is this useful? When writing unit tests, you may want to access files bundled in your test resources (src/main/resources) but are working with a third-party library or other system that requires a true filename, not a relative classpath reference. Note: I've answered this question myself, as I feel it's a useful trick, but it looks like no one has ever asked this question before.

@TITLE:How to produce ipairs (as opposed to pairs) behavior in the C API
@CONTENT:In Lua, pairs and ipairs can iterate over the same elements in a different order: > t = {[1]=1, [2]=2, [3]=3}
> for k,v in pairs(t) do print(k,v) end
2       2
1       1
3       3
> for k,v in ipairs(t) do print(k,v) end
1       1
2       2
3       3
 When using the C API, I see only one tool for iterating over a table: the lua_next() function which acts very much like the pairs() Lua function which produces the 2-1-3 order shown above. I am looking for an efficient C method for iterating over the integer keys of a table sequentially(a C API version of ipairs). Naively, I considered: int tableLength = luaL_len(L, tableIndex);
for (i=0, i++, i>tableLength){   
    // if t[i] is not null ...
}
 but I am unclear of potential performance issues where table sizes do not match the number of consecutive integer keys: t = {[1]=1, [2]=2, [4]=4}     -- has a (reported) length of 4
t = {[1]=1, [2]=2, [40000]=4} -- has a (reported) length of 2
 If this is indeed the way ipairs does it, then is there an easy way to start using lua_next with the last found integer key to continue to walk the rest of the table avoiding walking the integer-key portion again? Is there a chance I will see some integer keys twice by doing so?
@CODE:pairs ipairs > t = {[1]=1, [2]=2, [3]=3}

@CONTENT:I have two divs in my site one with id "ad_holder" and another with id "ad_buttons". When testing the site on Mozilla with ad block plus installed I noticed that both divs were hidden. On further inspection I noticed it that adblock was the culprit probably because of the ID names. I also noticed that adblock created (or maybe has a ready made) Css file, that sets the display to hidden. I know I can fix this by simply changing the IDs or trying to override the adblock css but still need to know if there is yet another alternative way of fixing this, like a small piece of code that tells adblock it's not a real ad. Kindly note the contents of the divs are not real ads, it just holds jepgs about the clients business.

@TITLE:Meteor/Mongo: Finding and updating certain elements in a collection
@CONTENT:I'm starting off with Meteor and need some help with Mongo. I have a collection of names that I'm displaying on a list and want to be able to update one variable of certain entries in the database based on other criteria. Basically what I want to do is: For every entry where characteristic A = true and B = true, change characteristic C to be false. So far, I've been trying to figure out how Mongo can handle a "for each" loop over the elements of the collection, and for each element check if conditions A and B hold, and then collection.update(element, {C: false}). This is proving to be a lot more problematic than I thought. I want to do something like this (using dummy variable names): for (i = 0; i < collection.find().count(); i++){
    if (collection[i].A===true && collection[i].B===true)
        collection.update(collection[i], {$set: {C: false}});
};
 I've been changing this base code around, but am starting to sense that I'm missing something basic about indexing/how collections work in Mongo. Can you index a collection like this (and if so, is this even the most convenient way to do what I'm trying to do?)?
@CODE:for (i = 0; i < collection.find().count(); i++){
    if (collection[i].A===true && collection[i].B===true)

@LINK:/questions/14003036/show-searchwidget-in-actionbar-if-user-presses-the-devices-search-button
@TITLE:Show SearchWidget in ActionBar if user presses the device's search button
@CONTENT:I set up a SearchWidget as described in the Android API Guide. It properly displays a magnifying glass icon in the Action Bar and if I click on it, it launches the search widget within the Action Bar (an input field with dark background). However, if I press the virtual device's search button, then a different search field is launched: It has a white background and does not invoke the callback methods I specified. So I added this to my MainActivity class: public boolean onSearchRequested() {
    SearchView searchView = (SearchView) menu.findItem(R.id.menu_search).getActionView();
    searchView.setIconified(!searchView.isIconified());
    return false;
}
 The set up of the search widget is exactly the same as it is described in the docs: SearchManager searchManager = (SearchManager) getSystemService(Context.SEARCH_SERVICE);
SearchView searchView = (SearchView) menu.findItem(R.id.menu_search).getActionView();
searchView.setSearchableInfo(searchManager.getSearchableInfo(getComponentName()));
searchView.setIconifiedByDefault(false);
searchView.setOnQueryTextListener(new CustomSearchQueryTextListener());
 My searchable.xml: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<searchable xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:label="@string/app_name">
</searchable>
 And AndroidManifest.xml:     <activity
        android:name="MainActivity"
        android:label="@string/app_name"
        android:launchMode="singleTask"

            <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />

        </intent-filter>

        </intent-filter>
        <meta-data android:name="android.app.searchable" android:resource="@xml/searchable"/>
    </activity>
 The reason why I tried the setIconfied() method is that in the Android API Guide it says under "The ability to toggle the search box visibility": "By default, the search widget is "iconified," meaning that it is represented only by a search icon (a magnifying glass), and expands to show the search box when the user touches it. As shown above, you can show the search box by default, by calling setIconifiedByDefault(false). You can also toggle the search widget appearance by calling setIconified()." I also tried to call startSearch("", false, null, false); but this brings up the same search field with the white background. So my question is: Is it possible to launch the search widget within the action bar if the user presses the device's search button, i.e. peform exactly the same action as if the search menu item is clicked?
@CODE:public boolean onSearchRequested() {
    SearchView searchView = (SearchView) menu.findItem(R.id.menu_search).getActionView();
    searchView.setIconified(!searchView.isIconified());
    return false;
} SearchManager searchManager = (SearchManager) getSystemService(Context.SEARCH_SERVICE);
SearchView searchView = (SearchView) menu.findItem(R.id.menu_search).getActionView();
searchView.setSearchableInfo(searchManager.getSearchableInfo(getComponentName()));
searchView.setIconifiedByDefault(false);
searchView.setOnQueryTextListener(new CustomSearchQueryTextListener()); <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

@CONTENT:General question: When a default Javascript prototype like Array has been modified, hacked, changed and twisted to the point of being unusable, is there any way to create instances of (or re-implement) the original, un-modified prototype? My case: I've got some code that is failing in the 'edit' mode of a (horrible, proprietary, closed source...) content management system, because the javascript for the interface of the 'edit' mode of the content management system hacks the absolute living hell out of the Array prototype. My code will work in the non-edit mode of the CMS, but, to get there, it has be tested in the 'edit' mode. It's possible to test if a prototype has been modified. Is it possible to re-implement the default Array prototype so I could do something like this: var hasArrayBeenTrashed = // boolean based on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/574584/
var normalArray.prototype = // based on answer to this question 
var myArray = !hasArrayBeenTrashed ? [] : new normalArray;

@TITLE:Conversion operator + conversion constructor = unintuitive behavior?
@CONTENT:I don't understand why the code below prints struct Value instead of int (which implies the conversion constructor is converting to Value instead of int). (Visual C++ 2012) Why is this happening? Why does the compiler completely ignore the Value(int) constructor? #include <iostream>
#include <type_info>

using namespace std;

struct Value { Value(int) { } };

struct Convertible
{
    template<class T>
    operator T() const
    { throw typeid(T).name(); }
};

int main()
{
    try { Value w((Convertible())); }
    catch (char const *s) { cerr << s << endl; }
}
 Edit: Even more bizarre is this (this time it's C++11 only, on GCC 4.7.2): #include <iostream>
#include <typeinfo>

using namespace std;

struct Value
{
    Value(Value const &) = delete;
    Value(int) { }
};

struct Convertible

};

int main()
{
    try { Value w((Convertible())); }
    catch (char const *s) { cerr << s << endl; }
}
 Which gives: source.cpp: In function 'int main()':

@TITLE:.net HttpClient with custom JsonConverter
@CONTENT:I'm using .NET's HttpClient to make requests to a WebAPI that returns some JSON data that requires a little bit of custom deserialization on the client's side. For this I've made my own JsonConverter, but I can't figure out how to have the ReadAsAsync<T> method pick up the existence of the converter. I've solved my problem for now by using ReadAsStringAsync to read the response, then passing that string in to JsonConvert.DeserializeObject, but it seems like there should be a more elegant solution. Here's my code: public PrefsResponse GetAllPrefs(string sid) {
    HttpClient client = CreateHttpClient(null, sid);
    var response = client.GetAsync("api/sites/" + sid).Result;

    // TODO : find a way to hook custom converters to this...
    // return response.Content.ReadAsAsync<PrefsResponse>().Result;

    var stringResult = response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync().Result;

    return JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<PrefsResponse>(stringResult, new PrefClassJsonConverter());
}
 Is this the best I can do, or is there some more elegant way? Here's where I'm creating the HttpClient also, if that's where I need to hook it up:         private HttpClient CreateHttpClient(CommandContext ctx, string sid) {
        var cookies = new CookieContainer();

        var handler = new HttpClientHandler {
            CookieContainer = cookies,

@TITLE:JavaScript algorithm to determine orientation of tablet
@CONTENT:We're building an HTML5/JavaScript app developed for tablets, and we want to lay out my screens differently in landscape versus portrait. Originally, we were capturing orientation change notifications, and keeping track of the current orientation (generally reported as 0, 90, -90 or 180 degrees -- see this question). Unfortunately, different devices report different orientations as "0". That link argues that it's a bug, but there's some evidence that this is working-as-designed -- for example, this article suggests that "landscape" is the default orientation and those devices report an orientation of "0" when held in landscape mode. We next tried to just look at the actual screen size, assuming that when width was greater than height, we were in landscape mode. But this algorithm gets confused when the on-screen keyboard is displayed -- when the keyboard is displayed, the dimensions of the visible area are returned. When the device is, strictly speaking, in portrait mode, but the portion of the screen not obscured by the keyboard is wider than it is tall. The response to this question is quite old. Is that still the best answer? Does anyone have a good algorithm that takes the keyboard visibility into consideration?

@CONTENT:When a computer has multiple CUDA-capable GPUs, each GPU is assigned a device ID. By default, CUDA kernels execute on device ID 0. You can use cudaSetDevice(int device) to select a different device. Let's say I have two GPUs in my machine: a GTX 480 and a GTX 670. How does CUDA decide which GPU is device ID 0 and which GPU is device ID 1? Ideas for how CUDA might assign device IDs (just brainstorming): descending order of compute capability PCI slot number date/time when the device was added to system (device that was just added to computer is higher ID number) Motivation: I'm working on some HPC algorithms, and I'm benchmarking and autotuning them for several GPUs. My processor has enough PCIe lanes to drive cudaMemcpys to 3 GPUs at full bandwidth. So, instead of constantly swapping GPUs in and out of my machine, I'm planning to just keep 3 GPUs in my computer. I'd like to be able to predict what will happen when I add or replace some GPUs in the computer.

@TITLE:How can I capture mouse events that occur outside of a (WPF) window?
@CONTENT:I have a Window element that has WindowStyle="None" and AllowsTransparency="True", therefore it has no title bar and supports transparency. I want the user to be able to move the Window to any position on the screen by left-clicking anywhere within the Window and dragging. The Window should drag along with the mouse as long as the left mouse button is pressed down. I was able to get this functionality to work with one exception: when the mouse moves outside of the Window (such as when the left mouse button was pressed down near the edge of the Window and the mouse is moved quicly), the Window no longer captures the mouse position and does not drag along with the mouse. Here is the code from the code-behind that I use to get the job done: public Point MouseDownPosition { get; set; }
public Point MousePosition { get; set; }
public bool MouseIsDown { get; set; }

private void window_MyWindowName_MouseLeftButtonDown(object sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e)
{
    MouseDownPosition = e.GetPosition(null);
    MouseIsDown = true;
}

private void window_MyWindowName_MouseMove(object sender, MouseEventArgs e)
{
    if (MouseIsDown)
    {
        MousePosition = e.GetPosition(null);
        Left += MousePosition.X - MouseDownPosition.X;
        Top += MousePosition.Y - MouseDownPosition.Y;
    }
}

private void window_MyWindowName_MouseLeftButtonUp(object sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e)
{
    MouseIsDown = false;

@LINK:/questions/13589510/facebook-php-sdk-getuser-suddenly-returns-0
@TITLE:Facebook PHP SDK - getUser() suddenly returns 0
@CONTENT:First of all, to get this out of the way, I've spent hours looking through answers to this question here on StackOverflow, and tried to solve it on my own, but it just isn't working (anymore). So anyway... Yesterday, everything worked fine. Went to bed, woke up, login with facebook didn't work anymore on 2 of my websites. The login link sends me to the Facebook page which requires me to approve the App, but after it redirects me back to the site, it doesn't log me in. I quickly tracked the problem to getUser() always returning 0. So I set up a new (test) app with a very very basic code, just to see if that works. It doesn't. Here's the code: <?php

        session_start();

        require_once("facebook.php");

        $config = array();
        $config['appId'] = '199971880127910'; //test app so I don't mind showing these
        $config['secret'] = 'e065588cb1edd96f821de8b3d362c488';
        $config['trustForwarded'] = true;

        $facebook = new Facebook($config);

        try {
            $user = $facebook->getUser();
            var_dump($user);

        } catch (Exception $e) {
            $e->getMessage();
        }

        $loginUrl = $facebook->getLoginUrl(array('redirect_uri' => 'http://gtcrais.redirectme.net/test/'));

        echo "<a href='".$loginUrl."'>Login</a>";
?>
 The second answer in here caught my eye. I tried that solution and it didn't work, so I opened up base_facebook.php and scrolled to the line where that 'code' is passed to some variable - line 458: $code = $this->getCode(); I echo'd this, and it displayed correctly the code parameter that was passed from the URL. The problematic line turns out to be the one couple rows below that one: $access_token = $this->getAccessTokenFromCode($code); This function returns a value of false to $access_token when passed the $code variable. In that function, this part of the code throws an exception: try {
      // need to circumvent json_decode by calling _oauthRequest
      // directly, since response isn't JSON format.
      $access_token_response =
        $this->_oauthRequest(
          $this->getUrl('graph', '/oauth/access_token'),
          $params = array('client_id' => $this->getAppId(),
                          'client_secret' => $this->getAppSecret(),
                          'redirect_uri' => $redirect_uri,
                          'code' => $code));
    } catch (FacebookApiException $e) {
      // most likely that user very recently revoked authorization.
      // In any event, we don't have an access token, so say so.
      print_r($e);
      return false;
    }
 print_r($e) displays a huge blob of gibberish (I'm somewhat of a noob so I can't read almost anything from it that makes sense). The only thing that I see repeating in there is SSL certificate problem, verify that the CA cert is OK. Details: error:14090086:SSL And this is how far I've come with debugging this. Any help is appreciated. Once again, yesterday, everything was working fine. Today, without a single line of code changed, it doesn't work anymore. Mind boggling =( Oh yeah, I'm running WAMP with PHP 5.4.3 EDIT: Here's the error message: http://i.imgur.com/TeY8h.png EDIT2: Solved: In base_facebook.php add the following 2 lines under $CURL_OPTS: CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER => false,
CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST => 2
 Which makes it... public static $CURL_OPTS = array(
    CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT => 10,
    CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER => true,
    CURLOPT_TIMEOUT        => 60,
    CURLOPT_USERAGENT      => 'facebook-php-3.2',
    CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER => false,
    CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST => 2
  );
 I'm not sure how much of a security issue this is, but it makes the Login with Facebook work, so there you have it (and there I have it. Entire day lost on this, fml). EDIT3: New SDK released which fixes this problem: https://github.com/facebook/facebook-php-sdk

@CONTENT:I am new to Spring MVC. I am writing an app that uses Spring, Spring MVC and JPA/Hibernate I don't know how to make Spring MVC set a value coming from a dropdown into a model object. I can imagine this a very common scenario Here is the code: Invoice.java @Entity

    private double amount;

    @ManyToOne(targetEntity=Customer.class, fetch=FetchType.EAGER)

    <form:label path="amount">amount</form:label>
    <form:input path="amount" />
    <form:label path="customer">Customer</form:label>
    <form:select path="customer" items="${customers}" required="true" itemLabel="name" itemValue="id"/>                
    <input type="submit" value="Add Invoice"/>
</form:form>
 InvoiceController.java @Controller
public class InvoiceController {

    private InvoiceService InvoiceService;

    public String addInvoice(@ModelAttribute("invoice") Invoice invoice, BindingResult result) {
        invoiceService.addInvoice(invoice);
        return "invoiceAdded";
    }
}
 When InvoiceControler.addInvoice() is invoked, an Invoice instance received as a parameter. The invoice has an amount as expected, but the customer instance attribute is null. This is because the http post submits the customer id and the Invoice class expects a Customer object. I don't know what is the standard way to convert that. I have read about Controller.initBinder(), about Spring Type conversion (in http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/validation.html) but I don't know if that is the solution for this problem. Any ideas?

@CONTENT:Though this topic present over different forums with different confusing discussion but I couldn¡¦t find any instance of it present over here at StackOverflow and it could be an important issue for many so I¡¦ll just start it here as I am also currently struggling with this problem by not having a SLAT supported hardware at my workplace. It is being said that: "The new emulator is built on the latest version of Microsoft Hyper-V, which requires a 64-bit CPU that includes Second Level Address Translation (SLAT), a memory virtualization technology included in most modern CPUs from Intel and AMD. SLAT (Second Level Address Translation) is required only to run the Windows Phone emulator. You can still build Windows Phone 8 apps on a non-SLAT computer; you will simply need to deploy and test them on a physical device." - [Windows Phone 8 Development Internals] Now the problem is I do have 64-bit CPU (Intel Core2Quad) but it doesn't have SLAT support and many other out there must be having fine but non SLAT PCs (for Intel mostly processor before i3 don¡¦t have this support) Now my question is it really like this a dead end? and if someone wants to develop for windows phone 8 he would have to either buy a new system or a latest WP (even with WP it would cumbersome in the development process) There isn¡¦t really a way out of it using any other thing like VMware, Virtual box etc.? Are there any other third party emulator or options available to achieve this? If not than why, what has changed so significantly in the new SDK release that has made it impossible to backward compatible? I repeat my main question in the end again: Is it really impossible to develop for windows phone 8 with its emulator functioning if you have one of non-SLAT supported PCs? Thankyou!

@CONTENT:I am trying to have a base Windows Forms form which holds common functionality and controls - but also holds references to a class which requires a type for its methods.

}

public class BaseClass { }

public class GenericHandler
{
    public void DoSomethingWithInstance<T>(T instance) where T : BaseClass

}
 My designer class declaration also mirrors what my form has. Now when I do my second form which represents the type Foo, I can't access the designer, because I get this error: The designer could not be shown for this file because none of the classes within it can be designed. The designer inspected the following classes in the file: Foo --- The base class 'WindowsFormsApplication1.Base' could not be loaded. Ensure the assembly has been referenced and that all projects have been built. FooClass --- The base class 'WindowsFormsApplication1.BaseClass' cannot be designed. public partial class Foo : Base<FooClass>

@CONTENT:My function includes adding a menu and toast to the document. I have verified that the trigger (onOpen) is set as well. It only works when a user goes into Tools, Script Manager, Run. We have too many users with too many backgrounds to expect then to know how to do this. Why isn't it working? (Using Chrome) function onOpen()

@TITLE:Android DownloadManager get filename
@CONTENT:In my app you can download some files. I used the Android DownloadManager class for downloading. After the download is completed, it should show me a message that the file was downloaded. The problem is, there could be 2,3 or 4 downloads at the same time. My BroadcastReceiver code looks like this: receiver_complete = new BroadcastReceiver(){
         @Override
          public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
             String action = intent.getAction();

 How can I get the current filename of the finished download? Thank you very much.

@TITLE:ActiveRecord: Adding condition to ON clause for includes
@CONTENT:I have a model offers and another historical_offers, one offer has_many historical_offers. Now I would like to eager load the historical_offers of one given day for a set of offers, if it exists. For this, I think I need to pass the day to the ON clause, not the WHERE clause, so that I get all offers, also when there is no historical_offer for the given day. With Offer.where(several_complex_conditions).includes(:historical_offers).where("historical_offers.day = ?", Date.today) I would get SELECT * FROM offers 
LEFT OUTER JOIN historical_offers 
ON offers.id = historical_offers.offer_id 
WHERE day = '2012-11-09' AND ...
 But I want to have the condition in the ON clause, not in the WHERE clause: SELECT * FROM offers 
LEFT OUTER JOIN historical_offers 
ON offers.id = historical_offers.offer_id AND day = '2012-11-09' 
WHERE ...
 I guess I could alter the has_many definition with a lambda condition for a specific date, but how would I pass in a date then? Alternatively I could write the joins mysqlf like this: Offer.where(several_complex_conditions)
  .joins(["historical_offers ON offers.id = historical_offers.offer_id AND day = ?", Date.today])
 But how can I hook this up so that eager loading is done?
@CODE:SELECT * FROM offers

@CONTENT:Possible Duplicate: Python list.index question To find the index of an item in a list, you use: list.index(x)
Return the index in the list of the first item whose value is x. 
It is an error if there is no such item.
 That seems a little odd to me, that it would throw an error if the item wasn't found. Where I come from (Objective-C land), it returns a NSNotFound enum (which is just a max int, indicating the item wasn't found). So I made something ugly to go around this: index = 0
for item in self.items:
   if item.id == desired_id:
        return index
    index = index + 1
 return -1
 I used -1 to indicate the item wasn't found. What's a better way to do this, and why doesn't Python have something like this built in?

@CONTENT:I'm looking for a robust way to model search queries in a REST api. In my api, you can specify the search criteria in the URI of a resource using query parameters. For example: /cars?search=color,blue;AND;doors,4 --> Returns a list of blue cars with 4 doors /cars?search=color,blue;OR;doors,4 --> Returns a list of cars that are blue or have 4 doors On the server side, the search string is mapped to the desired underlying technology. Depending on the rest resource, this can be a SQL query, the Hibernate Criteria api, another webservice call, ... The 2 examples are simple enough to support, but I also need more complex search features like substring search, searching before/after dates, NOT, ... This is a common problem I think. Is there a library (or a pattern) that I can use that: Maps search queries specified as a string to a generic Criteria model. The search format does not have to be the same as I listed above.

 What I want to do is to create a new data.frame that is equal to PVs, except that all entries having as a member of the "Word" column a string of character that does NOT end in either "te" or "de" removed. i.e. All words not ending in either "de" or "te" should be removed from the data.frame. I know how to slectively remove entries from data.frames using logical operators, but those work when you're setting numeric criteria. I think to do this I need to use regular expressions, but sadly R is the only programming language I "know", so I'm far from knowing what type of code to use here. I appreciate your help. Thanks in advance.

My goal is to reduce the .apk size, even if it will affect final performance, memory requirements, etc. How to prevent the "build process" from optimizing .png images?

@TITLE:Overriding Object.equals VS Overloading it
@CONTENT:Reading: Effective Java - Second Edition by Joshua Bloch Item 8 - Obey the general contract when overriding equals states: It is not uncommon for a programmer to write an equals method that looks like this, and then spend hours puzzling over why it doesn't work properly: [Code sample here] The problem is that this method does not override Object.equals, whose argument is of type Object, but overloads it instead. Code Sample: public boolean equals(MyClass o) {
    //...
}
 My Question: Why is a strongly typed equals method that overloads like the one in this code sample not sufficient? The book states that overloading rather than overriding is bad, but it doesn't state why this is the case or what scenarios would make this equals method fail.

Could someone provide a short example of declaring a class which is a List, that therein contains another List, but where the type of the object contained therein is not immediately known? I've been reading through the MS documentation on Generics, and I am not immediately sure if I can declare a List<List<T>>, nor how exactly to pass the <T> parameter to the inside list. Edit: Adding information Would declaring a List<List<T>> be considered legal here? In case you are wondering, I am building a class to that allows me to use a ulong as the indexer, and (hopefully) steps around the nasty 2GB limit of .Net by maintaining a List of Lists. public class DynamicList64<T>
    {
        private List<List<T>> data = new List<List<T>>();

@TITLE:Relationship between Emacs functions and commands
@CONTENT:From what I understand, in Emacs I can run commands such as M-x (which by the way I believe stands for execute-extended-command). This command M-x itself is used to run things like customize_face e.g. by typing M-x customize-face in the minibuffer. My questions are: Q.1. Is customize-face a command? or is it a function? And do we say that customize-face is passed to the command M-x as an argument? Q.2 Do all Emacs commands have an associated Emacs function? (i.e. when I enter M-x customize-face I presume a defined function is called). If so, how can I look up the function name from the command name? (and viceversa)

@LINK:/questions/12508986/r-liststructurelist-to-data-frame
@TITLE:R list(structure(list())) to data frame
@CONTENT:I have a JSON data source providing a list of hashes: [
  { "a": "foo",
    "b": "sdfshk"
  },
  { "a": "foo",
    "b": "ihlkyhul"
  }
]
 I use fromJSON() in the rjson package to convert that to an R data structure. It returns: list(
  structure(list(a = "foo", b = "sdfshk"), .Names = c("a", "b")),
  structure(list(a = "foo", b = "ihlkyhul"), .Names = c("a", "b"))
)
 I need to get this into an R data frame, but data.frame() turns that into a single-row data frame with four columns instead of a 2x2 data frame as expected. I lack the R-fu to do the transform from one to the other, though it looks like it should be straightforward. Bonus points: The actual problem is a bit more complex, because the JSON data source isn't as regular as I show above. The objects it returns vary in type. That is, the field set in each can be one of a few different types: [
  { "a": "foo",
    "b": "asdfhalsdhfla"
  },
  { "a": "bar",
    "c": "akjdhflakjhsdlfkah",
    "d": "jfhglskhfglskd",
  },
  { "a": "foo",
    "b": "dfhlkhldsfg"
  }
]
 As you can see, the "a" field in each object is a type tag, indicating which other fields the object will have. I'm not too particular how the solution copes with this. It wouldn't be horrible if the two object types were just mooshed together, so you get columns a, b, c, and d, and the rows simply have N/A or NULL values where the JSON source object doesn't have a value for a given field. I believe I can clean the resulting data frame with subset(df, a == "foo"). I'll end up with some empty columns that way, but it won't matter to my program. It would be better if the solution provides a way to select which JSON source rows go into the data frame and which get rejected, so the result has only the columns and rows actually required.
@CODE:[
  { "a": "foo",
    "b": "sdfshk"
  },
  { "a": "foo",
    "b": "ihlkyhul"
  }
] fromJSON() rjson list(
  structure(list(a = "foo", b = "sdfshk"), .Names = c("a", "b")),
  structure(list(a = "foo", b = "ihlkyhul"), .Names = c("a", "b"))
) data.frame() [
  { "a": "foo",
    "b": "asdfhalsdhfla"
  },
  { "a": "bar",

@CONTENT:Now I'm talking about new type definition by a programmer using typedef keyword. As long as my pupils are used to the type size_t (for example by using funciton length ()), for which I had to ask them a little effort to just "believe" it is an integer type, I think it woud be great to show noew them where this type is defined. So, I've done a lot grep's in /usr/include in an ubuntu box, and what I see is that size_t is, in turn, a redefinition of size_type wich in turn is a redefinition of metadata_type, and that's the end in this directory. Not found the final "typedef unsigned int metadata_type;". In /usr/src I've found anohter previous type called yy_size_t,... But, in any case I've been unable the get to the end of the chain. Does anyone know where to find out the final definition to check out that it is an unsigned int (or the like)? May be I miss a development package in my box? In this case, why I'm able to compile programs using size_t type?

I imagine some sort of configuration is required to let the IDE know what classes are valid? How is that configuration done? Update: I do have a JPA facet, but it doesn't see the annotated classes.

@TITLE:Efficiently find nearest dictionary key
@CONTENT:I have a bunch of pairs of dates and monetary values in a SortedDictionary<DateTime, decimal>, corresponding to loan balances calculated into the future at contract-defined compounding dates. Is there an efficient way to find a date key that is nearest to a given value? (Specifically, the nearest key less than or equal to the target). The point is to store only the data at the points when the value changed, but efficiently answer the question "what was the balance on x date?" for any date in range. A similar question was asked ( What .NET dictionary supports a "find nearest key" operation? ) and the answer was "no" at the time, at least from the people who responded, but that was almost 3 years ago. The question How to find point between two keys in sorted dictionary presents the obvious solution of naively iterating through all keys. I am wondering if any built-in framework function exists to take advantage of the fact that the keys are already indexed and sorted in memory -- or alternatively a built-in Framework collection class that would lend itself better to this kind of query.

Skipping to next Item is no problem with the advanceToNextItem provided by AVQueuePlayer, but there is nothing alike for skipping back or playing a certainitem from the queue. So I am not quite sure what would be the best approach here: Using an AVPlayer instead of AVQueuePlayer, invoke replaceCurrentItemWithPlayerItem: at actionAtItemEnd to play the nextItem and just use 'replaceCurrentItemWithPlayerItem' to let the User select a certain Chapter or reorganise the queue or the current player by using 'insertItem:afterItem:' and 'removeAllItems' Additional information: I store the Path to the different videos in the order they should appear in a NSArray The user is supposed to jump to certain chapters by pressing buttons that represent the chapter. The Buttons have tags, that are also the indexes of the corresponding videos in the array. Hope I could make myself clear? Anyone having any experience with this situation?

@TITLE:Facebook iOS SDK 3.x feed dialog is gone?
@CONTENT:Today I started to use Facebook SDK 3.0 for iOS and I realized that there is no FBDialog class anymore. I've searched developers.facebook.com for some tutorials how I can show feed dialog using new sdk. We used to write: [facebook dialog:@"feed" andParams:params andDelegate:self];
 But, it seems that all tips talking about dialogs are related to old SDK in developers.facebook.com. Did anybody implemented feed dialog with new SDK? Or, should we build our own DialogViewController to represent all UI elements as textFields, send button in order to make FBRequest?!

 And, given 'id' and 'name', produces something like: Array (

 I use this pattern a lot, and I noticed that array_map is quite useless in this scenario cause you can't specify keys for returned array.

@LINK:/questions/11781606/c-sharp-xml-serialization-collection-and-root-element
@TITLE:C# Xml serialization, collection and root element
@CONTENT:My app serializes objects in streams. Here is a sample of what I need : <links>
  <link href="/users" rel="users" />
  <link href="/features" rel="features" />
</links>
 In this case, the object is a collection of 'links' object. -----------First version At first I used the DataContractSerializer, however you cannot serialize members as attributes (source) Here is the object : [DataContract(Name="link")]
public class LinkV1
{
    [DataMember(Name="href")]
    public string Url { get; set; }

    [DataMember(Name="rel")]
    public string Relationship { get; set; }
}
 And here is the result : <ArrayOflink xmlns:i="...." xmlns="...">
  <link>
    <href>/users</href>
    <rel>users</rel>
  </link>
  <link>
    <href>/features</href>
    <rel>features</rel>
  </link>
</ArrayOflink>
 ----------- Second version Ok, not quiet what I want, so I tried the classic XmlSerializer, but... oh nooo, you cannot specify the name of the root element & of the collection's elements if the root element is a collection... Here is the code : [XmlRoot("link")]
public class LinkV2
{
    [XmlAttribute("href")]
    public string Url { get; set; }

    [XmlAttribute("rel")]
    public string Relationship { get; set; }
}
 Here is the result : <ArrayOfLinkV2>
  <LinkV2 href="/users" rel="users" />
  <LinkV2 href="/features" rel="features" />
  <LinkV2 href="/features/user/{keyUser}" rel="featuresByUser" />
</ArrayOfLinkV2>
 ----------- Third version using XmlSerializer + a root element : [XmlRoot("trick")]
public class TotallyUselessClass
{
    [XmlArray("links"), XmlArrayItem("link")]
    public List<LinkV2> Links { get; set; }
}
 And its result :  <trick>
  <links>
    <link href="/users" rel="users" />
    <link href="/features" rel="features" />
    <link href="/features/user/{keyUser}" rel="featuresByUser" />
  </links>
</trick>
 Nice, but I don't want that root node !! I want my collection to be the root node. Here are the contraints : the serialization code is generic, it works with anything serializable the inverse operation (deserialization) have to work too I don't want to regex the result (I serialize directly in an output stream) What are my solutions now : Coding my own XmlSerializer Trick XmlSerializer when it works with a collection (I tried, having it find a XmlRootElement and plurialize it to generate its own XmlRootAttribute, but that causes problem when deserializing + the items name still keeps the class name) Any idea ?

@CONTENT:I am looking to solve this error: Could not load file or assembly 'log4net, Version=1.2.10.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=692fbea5521e1304' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified." This error is located in the web.config file. When I copy log4net.dll to the bin directory of my webapp, I get a Could not load file or assembly 'log4net, Version=1.2.10.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=692fbea5521e1304' or one of its dependencies. The located assembly's manifest definition does not match the assembly reference. This error also occurs in the web.config file. It's easy enough to change the version and the public key token to match the file so that the assembly loads correctly. When I do that, my website runs perfectly, except for when a reportViewer object is initialized. Then it throws the original error at the reportViewer tag, not the web.config. My hypothesis is that if I install the requested version of log4net.dll, my problems will be solved. But I have no clue which file that it, or where to find it. I've checked the obvious by downloading log4net 1.2.10 and trying out every dll in the download. I should mention that the website runs without issues on my development machine, but not when published to my server. I'm running an asp.net website, .NET 4.0, IIS 7, on a Server 2008 R2 OS. I've installed Crystal Reports 13.0.1 for 64bit (my machine is 64bit). How can I resolve this issue? EDIT: In response to @Kevian's answer, I have made the change to my web.config file.

@TITLE:How to make HTTPS requests with serverside javascript using Worklight?
@CONTENT:I'm toying around with IBM worklight, and am trying to create an adapter to feed some data in from the Google places API. I want to call this URL : https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/search/json?key=AIzaSyCTlPms1pvhzeoRrBao5qW-DJMI_CWcbAM&location=52.0700,1.1400&radius=10000&sensor=false&name=coffee
 Executing this URL works fine in a browser, and displays some nice JSON that I'm trying to obtain via Worklight. The Worklight adapters are created in Javascript, this is what I have so far : function getCoffeeHouses() {

    var input = {
        method : 'get',
        returnedContentType : 'json',
        path : 'maps/api/place/search/json',
        parameters : {
            'key'       :   'AIzaSyCTlPms1pvhzeoRrBao5qW-DJMI_CWcbAM',
            'location'  :   '52.0700,1.1400',
            'radius'    :   '10000',
            'sensor'    :   'false',
            'name'      :   'coffee' 
        }
    };

    var response = WL.Server.invokeHttp(input);

 // Extract latitude and longitude from the response.
    var type = typeof response; 
    if ("object" == type) {
        if (true == response["isSuccessful"]) {
            // Return JSON object with lat and lng.
            return response["results"];
        } 
        else {
            // Returning null. Web request was not successful.
            return null;
        }
    } 
    else {
        // Returning null. Response is not an object.
        return null;
    }
}
 And this is the result that I get in the console, when I test the above: Failed to parse JSON string

 I think, that this is probably caused because the adapter is requesting as HTTP, whereas it should be using HTTPS. If I alter the request to use HTTP in a browser, it displays similar results.

    event.preventDefault();
    event.stopPropagation();
    console.log($(event.target).data());    
});
 Using the mouse on a (non-touch) device, this code correctly logs the data associated with the element under the mouse at the time of the mouseup event. However on a touch device (ipad safari), event.target is the element that was under the finger during the touchstart event and logs the data of the element under the touchstart event I've also examined the behavior of the touchmove event, this also has the same behaviour (the event.target is touchstart element). It seems that the target for all the touch events is the element touched at the beginning of the gesture. I need to access the element under the finger when the touchend event is called. My gesture potentially traverses many elements. Edit Further research dug up this from the specification. 5.5 The touchend event A user agent must dispatch this event type to indicate when the user removes a touch point from the touch surface, also including cases where the touch point physically leaves the touch surface, such as being dragged off of the screen. The target of this event must be the same Element on which the touch point started when it was first placed on the surface, even if the touch point has since moved outside the interactive area of the target element. The touch point or points that were removed must be included in the changedTouches attribute of the TouchEvent, and must not be included in the touches and targetTouches attributes. So the observed behavior is correct, how can I change this behavior?

@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: How do I migrate a model out of one django app and into a new one? 7 answers I made the stupid mistake of creating too many models in the same Django app, now I want to split it into 3 distinct ones. Problem is: there's already data in production in two customers' sites, so I need to carefully plan any schema/data migration to be done (I'm using django-south). I'm unsure on how to proceed, any advice would be greatly appreciated. (I'm using PostgreSQL on a Ubuntu server 12.4 LTS, if that's of any relevance) I thought about using db.rename_table, but can't figure out how to correctly update the foreign keys to those models (old to new) - irrelevant at the database level (since the table renaming already got that covered), but not so at the ORM level. Update: after thinking about it, and after asking this question on programmmers.SE, I decided to keep things simple and don't worry about migrations between major versions of the product. Short term, I'll just use db.rename_table to match the new name, while also using db_table as Daniel Roseman suggested, all the while keeping the models in the old app. When upgrading to a major version, I swith to the new app and ditch all migrations altogether (so fresh installs of the new version will create the database "as-is" instead of going through all historical migrations).

@CONTENT:From LDD3/ Ch. 15/ sections "Using remap_pfn_range" and "A Simple Implementation", pfn has been equated to the vm_pgoff field. I am confused by this. How can that be so? Note that vm_pgoff is described as: The offset of the area in the file, in pages. When a file or device is mapped, this is the file position of the first page mapped in this area. Thus if the first page mapped corresponds to the first page of the file as well (which, I think would be quite common), vm_pgoff would be 0. correct? If so, this doesn't seem to be the correct value for the pfn parameter of remap_pfn_range( ). What am I missing here? What is the correct value? For ease of reference, I am reproducing the relevant code from LDD3 below (Page no. 426) static int simple_remap_mmap(struct file *filp, struct vm_area_struct *vma)

@CONTENT:I'm familiar with the standard colspan-based approach for displaying (multiweek or month view) calendars in HTML with events that span multiple days. (Google Calendar does this, as one of many examples.) I'm curious if anyone knows of a table-less approach to achieve the same thing. Maybe it's just not important, and this is a "good" use of the table element, but I think it might be more relevant in this era of responsive design. Here's an example of a responsive, table-less calendar. (No multi-day events, though.) https://pittsburghkids.org/calendar In its small-viewport version, it's no longer a table, semantically. Similarly, as @ThinkingStiff mentions below, if you're switching from "month view" to "list view" on the client side, a table doesn't really fit semantically either.

@CONTENT:I've written my own MVC framework in PHP, which uses urls in the format of: /controller/method/param1/param2/param... I've made it so that "default" methods can be ignored (by default index()), so this results in URLs like /controller//param1/param2/param.... For example, a URL of: /view//panel-glide/3 will call index('panel-glide', 3) in the view controller. This works fine and dandy, but I'm concerned that search engines or some older browsers might freak out when they see the double slashes, as I don't think I've actually seem them ever be used before.

 So, I finally solved it by 4 steps: Add this.getContext().getContentResolver().notifyChange(URI, null); to ContentProvider's updat() insert() delete() callbacks. Create a new Observer and new Thread to handle it. Call notifyAppWidgetViewDataChanged() in Observer's onChange(). Delete the widget and place a new one. That's it.

@TITLE:Using mousedown event on mobile without jQuery mobile?
@CONTENT:I've built a webapp, and for a little bit of polish, I wanted to add mousedown and mouseup handlers to swap out images (in this case, to make a button look like it's being pressed). my code is something like this: window.onload = function() {
    //preload mouse down image here via Image()
    $("#button_img").mousedown(function(){$("#button_img").attr("src","button_on.png");});
    $("#button_img").mouseup(function(){$("#button_img").attr("src","button_off.png")});
}
 This works swimmingly on the desktop, but on mobile (testing in iOS Safari), the mousedown and mouseup events happen at the same time, so effectively nothing happens. I tried to use the vmousedown and vmouseup events in jQueryMobile, however this code: //include jquerymobile.js and jquerymobile.css 
window.onload = function() {
    //preload mouse down image here via Image()
    $("#button_img").vmousedown(function(){$("#button_img").attr("src","button_on.png");});
    $("#button_img").vmouseup(function(){$("#button_img").attr("src","button_off.png")});
}
 Just gave me the errors that vmousedown and vmouseup don't exist. Also, jQueryMobile overrides the CSS I've already written for the page. So is there a way to get vmousedown and vmouseup to work, and to do so without jQuery Mobile's CSS? Thanks in advance -Esa

@TITLE:How to set up CKEditor for multiple instances with different heights?
@CONTENT:I'd like to have multiple instances of CKEditor based on the same config settings, but with different heights. I tried setting up config with the default height, setting up the 1st instance, then overriding the height & setting up the 2nd instance: var config = {
    .....
    height:'400'
};

$('#editor1').ckeditor(config);
config.height = '100';
$('#editor2').ckeditor(config);
 ...but I get two CKEditor instances that both have 100px height. I also tried this: CKEDITOR.replace('editor2',{
    height: '100'
});
 .. I got error messages that the instance already existed. I searched around a bit & found someone in a similar situation got advice that you have to destroy() the instance before replace(), but that seems too complicated for just setting a different initial height. In the end I set up two different configs & copied over the toolbar_Full property: var config1 = {
    height:'400',
    startupOutlineBlocks:true,
    scayt_autoStartup:true,
    toolbar_Full:[
        { name: 'clipboard', items : [ 'Cut','Copy','Paste','PasteText','PasteFromWord','-','Undo','Redo' ] },
        { name: 'editing', items : [ 'Find','Replace','-' ] },
        { name: 'basicstyles', items : [ 'Bold','Italic','Underline','Strike','Subscript','Superscript','-','RemoveFormat' ] },
        { name: 'paragraph', items : [ 'NumberedList','BulletedList','-','Outdent','Indent','-','Blockquote','-','JustifyLeft','JustifyCenter','JustifyRight','JustifyBlock','-','BidiLtr','BidiRtl' ] },
        '/',

        { name: 'insert', items : [ 'Image','HorizontalRule' ] },

        { name: 'tools', items : [ 'Maximize', 'ShowBlocks' ] },
        { name: 'document', items : [ 'Source' ] }
    ]
}

var config2 = {
    height:'100',
    startupOutlineBlocks:true,
    scayt_autoStartup:true
};
config2.toolbar_Full = config1.toolbar_Full;

$('#editor1').ckeditor(config1);
$('#editor2').ckeditor(config2);
 Is there a better way? Anything I'm missing? There's this question but they didn't post quite enough to be useful, & this very similar question hasn't been answered. Thanks! Update: This seems to be a timing/config handling quirk of CKEditor -- the config is read & applied later (I'm guessing after the editor's DOM framework has been set up) rather than when the editor is first instantiated. So, any changes to the config settings made immediately after the 1st editor is instantiated with .ckeditor() are actually applied by the editor at some point in the following several milliseconds. I'd argue this isn't normal behavior, or logical. For instance, you can get the expected behavior in my first example (overriding the config.height property after the first editor has been instantiated) to work by delaying the 2nd CKEditor instance with setTimeout(). Firefox needed ~100ms, IE needed 1ms. Wacky & wrong. CKEditor should read the config settings when each editor is first instantiated. For now, everyone has to work around that quirk.
@CODE:var config = {
    .....
    height:'400'

$('#editor1').ckeditor(config);
config.height = '100';

@TITLE:Writing portable scheme code. Is anything ¡§standard¡¨ beyond R5RS itself?
@CONTENT:I'm learning scheme and until now have been using guile. I'm really just learning as a way to teach myself a functional programming language, but I'd like to publish an open source project of some sort to reenforce the study¡X not sure what yet... I'm a web developer, so probably something webby. It's becoming apparent that publishing scheme code isn't very easy to do, with all these different implementations and no real standards beyond the core of the language itself (R5RS). For example, I'm almost certainly going to need to do basic IO on disk and over a TCP socket, along with string manipulation, such as scanning/regex, which seems not to be covered by R5RS, unless I'm not seeing it in the document. It seems like Scheme is more of a "concept" than a practical language... is this a fair assessment? Perhaps I should look to something like Haskell if I want to learn a functional programming language that lends itself more to use in open source projects? In reality, how much pain do the differing scheme implementations pose when you want to publish an open source project? I don't really fancy having to maintain 5 different functions for basic things like string manipulation under various mainstream implementations (Chicken, guile, MIT, DrRacket). How many people actually write scheme for cross-implementation compatibility, as opposed to being tightly coupled with the library functions that only exist in their own scheme? I have read http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/dorai/scmxlate/scheme-boston/talk.html, which doesn't fill me with confidence ;) EDIT | Let's re-define "standard" as "common".

@TITLE:How to use different cookies for each connection using HttpURLConnection and the CookieManager in Java
@CONTENT:I needed to connect to a website from multiple threads simultaneously using HttpURLConnection, but use different cookies for each connection. Since Java only supports setting a global CookieManager, I've implemented the following hack. Instead of calling CookieHandler.setDefault(new CookieManager()), I've implemented a custom CookieHandler which uses a different CookieStore instance for every thread, which is cleared after each request. I've created class called SessionCookieManager based on the source code of CookieManager. The cookieJar member variable was removed, and its usage has been replaced by getCookieStore(). The following code was added: public class SessionCookieManager extends CookieHandler
{
    private final static SessionCookieManager ms_instance = new SessionCookieManager();

    public static SessionCookieManager getInstance()
    {
        return ms_instance;
    }

    private final static ThreadLocal<CookieStore> ms_cookieJars = new ThreadLocal<CookieStore>() {
        @Override
        protected synchronized CookieStore initialValue() { return new sun.net.www.protocol.http.InMemoryCookieStore(); }
    };

    public void clear()
    {
        getCookieStore().removeAll();
    }

    public CookieStore getCookieStore() {
        return ms_cookieJars.get();
    }
 Before the first request, the custom CookieManager is set as the global default CookieHandler: CookieHandler.setDefault(SessionCookieManager.getInstance());
 After every request, the current thread's CookieStore is cleared: try
{
    ...
}
finally
{
    SessionCookieManager.getInstance().clear();
}
@CODE:CookieHandler.setDefault(new CookieManager()) CookieHandler CookieStore SessionCookieManager CookieManager cookieJar getCookieStore() public class SessionCookieManager extends CookieHandler
{

}
 and a jQuery fadeIn. I would like to use the callback from the fadeIn but I also can just use a timer with the CSS I guess. Are either of these likely to work better with large images? I can't see a difference, but wondered if it might affect slower computers.

Now I want to make available a minified version of my plugin, but I'm not sure what the best practice is. I know that it should be available on the Downloads page as jquery.plugin.min.js, but should I also version control it each time I update it to reflect the unminified version?

@CONTENT:It shouldn't be this hard to find out how to do this. Basically I'm trying to take a string and let the client save it when they click a button. It should pop up with a Save/Open dialog. No extra bells and whistles or anything. It's not rocket science, (or so I would've thought). There seems to be a ton of different ways, (StreamWriter, HttpResponse, etc.), but none of the examples I've been able to find work properly or explain what's going on. Thanks in advance. An example one of the many blocks of code I've found... (This is just an example, feel free to not base your answer around this.) String FileName = "FileName.txt";
String FilePath = "C:/...."; //Replace this
System.Web.HttpResponse response = System.Web.HttpContext.Current.Response;
response.ClearContent();
response.Clear();
response.ContentType = "text/plain";
response.AddHeader("Content-Disposition", "attachment; filename=" + FileName + ";");
response.TransmitFile(FilePath);
response.Flush();
response.End();
 Line 2 says to replace that string. How? This code was advertised as bringing up a dialog. I shouldn't be having to set a path in the code, right? EDIT: Final Outcome (Edited again, Delete has to come before End();)         string FilePath = Server.MapPath("~/Temp/");
        string FileName = "test.txt";

        // Creates the file on server

@CONTENT:I have a problem with the native WebView on Android. I need to authenticate with a site using a SSL Client Certificate. The Android WebView doesn't seem to support this. As a workaround I used a modified version of the WebView: https://github.com/yonekawa/webview-with-client-certificate The modified WebView works by injecting a properly configured SslSocketFactory into the standard Android WebView. This works fine on Android 2.x devices. However, with Android 4 ICS it doesn't work anymore. The SslSocketFactory is still there in ICS, however, it seems that it isn't used anymore. So my question is: has anyone succeeded in configuring the Android WebView on ICS so that it works with a client certificate? Or is there any alternative? What I already tried: importing the SSL client certificate into the Android keystore and just using the WebView without any modification. This doesn't work, the client certificate is not sent along with the requests. It works in the native browser, though. creating the SSL connection myself using HttpClient, getting the HTML of the site and handing it to the WebView. This basically works, but I need to intercept all requests made by the WebView and handle them myself. However, the WebView doesn't provide the data of POST requests, which makes this approach unusable for me.

I've noticed that html5reset.org itself seems to display the broken page icon, so it doesn't seem to work either, but html5boilerplate.com DOES work, and seems to use the same approach. Adding the X-UA-Compatible into the response header via webserver config seems to fix it, but I'd rather not rely on this approach. Update: It seems that html5boilerplate.com is just sending X-UA-Compatible in the HTTP response headers if it detects that the browser is IE. This seems the way to go.

@TITLE:Figuring which printer name corresponds to which device ID
@CONTENT:My goal is to open a printer connected via USB using the CreateFile (and then issue some WriteFiles and ReadFiles). If the printer was an LPT one, I would simply do CreateFile("LPT1:", ...). But for USB printers, there is a special device path that must be passed to CreateFile in order to open that printer. This device path, as I was able to find, is retrieved via SetupDiGetClassDevs -> SetupDiEnumDeviceInterfaces -> SetupDiGetDeviceInterfaceDetail -> DevicePath member and looks like this: \\?\usb#vid_0a5f&pid_0027#46a072900549#{28d78fad-5a12-11d1-ae5b-0000f803a8c2} All that is fine, but what I have as the input is the human-readable printer name, as seen in Devices and Printers. The SetupDi* functions don't seem to use that, they only operate on device instance IDs. So the question is now how to get device instance ID from the printer name one would pass to OpenPrinter. It's not difficult to observe that the GUID part of the above is the GUID_DEVINTERFACE_USBPRINT, and \\?\usb is fixed, so the only bit I'm really interested in is vid_0a5f&pid_0027#46a072900549#. This path I can easily look up manually in the printer properties dialog: Go to Devices and Printers Right-click the printer Properties Switch to Hardware tab Select the printing device, such as ZDesigner LP2844-Z Properties Switch to Details tab Select 'Parent' from the dropdown. But I have no idea how to do that programmatically provided the only thing given is the printer name as seen in the Device and Printers panel. P.S. 1: I'm not interested in opening the printer with OpenPrinter and then using WritePrinter / ReadPrinter. That has been done, works fine, but now the goal is different. P.S. 2: I'll be OK with a simpler way to convert the readable printer name to something that can be passed to CreateFile. P.S. 3: This question, to which I have posted an answer, is very related to what I ultimately want to do. P.S. 4: The other way round is also fine: If it is possible to obtain the readable name from the SP_DEVINFO_DATA structure, that will also be the answer, although a less convenient one.

@LINK:/questions/10521978/html5-canvas-image-contrast
@TITLE:HTML5 Canvas image contrast
@CONTENT:I've been writing an image processing program which applies effects through HTML5 canvas pixel processing. I've achieved Thresholding, Vintaging, and ColorGradient pixel manipulations but unbelievably I cannot change the contrast of the image! I've tried multiple solutions but I always get too much brightness in the picture and less of a contrast effect and I'm not planning to use any Javascript libraries since I'm trying to achieve these effects natively. The basic pixel manipulation code: var data = imageData.data;
for (var i = 0; i < data.length; i += 4) {
 //Note: data[i], data[i+1], data[i+2] represent RGB respectively
data[i] = data[i];
data[i+1] = data[i+1];
data[i+2] = data[i+2];
}
 Pixel manipulation example Values are in RGB mode which means data[i] is the Red color. So if data[i] = data[i] * 2; the brightness will be increased to twice for the Red channel of that pixel. Example: var data = imageData.data;
for (var i = 0; i < data.length; i += 4) {
 //Note: data[i], data[i+1], data[i+2] represent RGB respectively
 //Increases brightness of RGB channel by 2
data[i] = data[i]*2;
data[i+1] = data[i+1]*2;
data[i+2] = data[i+2]*2;
}
 *Note: I'm not asking you guys to complete the code! That would just be a favor! I'm asking for an algorithm (even Pseudo code) that shows how Contrast in pixel manipulation is possible! I would be glad if someone can provide a good algorithm for Image Contrast in HTML5 canvas.
@CODE:var data = imageData.data;
for (var i = 0; i < data.length; i += 4) {
 //Note: data[i], data[i+1], data[i+2] represent RGB respectively
data[i] = data[i];
data[i+1] = data[i+1];
data[i+2] = data[i+2];
} var data = imageData.data;
for (var i = 0; i < data.length; i += 4) {
 //Note: data[i], data[i+1], data[i+2] represent RGB respectively

data[i] = data[i]*2;

@TITLE:How to restructure Maven multi-module project?
@CONTENT:I appologize for the length of this post, but I had trouble making it more concise without presenting the picture. I've recently inherited the job of build-master for a maven 3.0 multi-module project. The problem is that the structure of the project/modules is a disaster. From the way things are currently stored in Source Control (we use RTC) to the pom structure of the modules, I'm tearing my hair out trying to get a full build cycle completed each time. As a project hierarchy goes, all the modules are stored "flat"; ie: everything is at the same level. I have a parent pom, and all modules depend on the parent. However, the parent is at the same level as all my other modules. Ex: c:\dev\MyEarProject
 + parent-pom
   - pom.xml
 + module1
   - pom.xml (depends on parent-pom)
   - src
   -   main
   -     ...
 + module2
   - pom.xml (depends on parent-pom)
   - src
   -   main
   -     ...
 + module3
   - pom.xml (depends on parent-pom)
   - src
   -   main
   -     ...
 The parent pom defines all the modules required to build the project, as well as a bunch of properties for artifact version numbers used throughout the different submodules: <modules>
  <module>../module1</module>
  <module>../module2</module>
  <module>../module3</module>
</modules>

<properties>
    <org.springframework.version>3.0.5.RELEASE</org.springframework.version>
    <slf4j.version>1.6.4</slf4j.version>
    <repositoryAddress>${snapshots.repo.url}</repositoryAddress>
    <my.hibernate-module.dao.impl>1.2.3</my.hibernate-module.dao.impl>
    <my.hibernate-module.dao.api>1.2.3</my.hibernate-module.dao.api>
</properties>
 Each module's pom, in turn, depends on the parent pom via the pom's artifact number: <parent>
    <groupId>com.cws.cs.lendingsimulationservice</groupId>
    <artifactId>parent-pom</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.6</version>
</parent>
 To make things even more confusing, the actual artifact name may, or may not (depending on the module), match the module path. For example, module1 may be located in path c:\dev\MyEarProject\module1 but have artifact name hibernate-module. However, due to the way it is stored in RTC, the directory is called module1 when it is checked-out. The easiest way to build everything, of course, is to go into c:\dev\MyEarProject\parent-pom\ and run mvn clean deploy. This works fine when in SNAPSHOT mode as the SNAPSHOT repo allows for multiple deployments of the same artifact version. But in release mode, this fails. This structure is causing 2 problems for me. Everytime I need to make a version change to a property in the parent, I have to update the parent-pom version number, and all the child modules parent pom's version, and all the child modules version themselves (since the parent changed). Whenever I need to deploy a release cycle, mvn will throw an error if one of the modules has not changed since the last cycle and consequently cannot be redeployed to the same repo (the repo does not allow overwriting existing artifacts) So I'm looking for the best way to restructure this project to avoid these problems. For the parent pom, I know I can use a relative path to point to the parent instead. However, given the "flat" structure of the modules, is this a recommended approach (ie: the parent pom relative path would be ../parent-pom/pom.xml - seems a little odd to me)? Additionally, given that the versioning control of the parent is independent of the modules, would using a relative path not just open the door to additional confusion (ie: there would be no way to know which version of the parent pom is associated with which version of the submodule). Secondly, how can I build the entire ear without encountering the deploy errors I am having? Since the artifact already exists in the repo, I don't need to rebuild and redeploy it. I tried using --projects but with the number of modules involved, it gets extremely difficult to manage. Thanks, Eric

@TITLE:Backface visibility broken in Chrome (certain platforms/versions)
@CONTENT:So I've looked around a bit, it seems that -webkit-backface-visibility functionality is a bit spotty. In Chrome 18 on Mac and Linux, it works fine. In Chrome 18 on Windows, it does not. However, I've seen other people running Chrome on Mac where it also does not work. Here is my test fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/csaltyj/TYuL3/ Unfortunately, since I'm doing a card-flip animation, I NEED to use -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden to hide the back face of the card. Is there some equivalent I can use that works 100% on Chrome, no matter what?

@TITLE:Service not receiving messages after Message Queuing service restarted
@CONTENT:We have a service that receives messages from n message queues. However, if the Message Queuing service is restarted, the message retrieval service stops receiving messages even after the Message Queuing service has restarted successfully. I have tried to specifically catch the MessageQueueException that is thrown in the message retrieval service and invoke the queue's BeginReceive method again. However, in the 2 seconds or so that it takes the Message Queuing service to restart, I get about 1875 instances of the exception and then the service stops functioning when another MessageQueueException is thrown in our StartListening method. Is there an elegant way to recover from a Message Queuing service restart?     private void OnReceiveCompleted(object sender, ReceiveCompletedEventArgs e)
    {
        MessageQueue queue = (MessageQueue)sender;

        try
        {
            Message message = queue.EndReceive(e.AsyncResult);

            this.StartListening(queue);

            if (this.MessageReceived != null)
                this.MessageReceived(this, new MessageReceivedEventArgs(message));
        }
        catch (MessageQueueException)
        {

@LINK:/questions/10241160/bug-in-twtweetcomposeviewcontroller
@TITLE:Bug in TWTweetComposeViewController?
@CONTENT:I am using TWTweetComposeViewController, when available, to send tweets from inside my iOS app. I pre-populate the view controller with boilerplate text, then let the user modify and send at their discretion. It works great for the most part. Distilled down, it looks like this (with body pointing at a valid NSString): if (NSClassFromString(@"TWTweetComposeViewController"))  {
    TWTweetComposeViewController *iOS5twitter = [[TWTweetComposeViewController alloc] init];
    [iOS5twitter setInitialText:body];
    iOS5twitter.completionHandler = ^(TWTweetComposeViewControllerResult result) 
    {
        [self.viewController dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:nil];
    };   
    [self.viewController presentViewController:iOS5twitter animated:YES completion:nil];
    [iOS5twitter release];
}
else {
    /* Do something else when the framework is missing */
}
 Now if body is too long, i.e., more than 140 characters, the resulting tweet view is empty of any text at all, character countdown set to 140. I might have expected truncation in this case, although it does not appear to be documented in the Class Reference one way or the other what happens when the initial text is too long, but I can accept that I have to do the truncation to maximum tweet length before passing to setInitialText. What I don't understand is that certain messages which are shorter than 140 characters also produce the empty tweet view. Initially I saw what seemed to be a perfectly valid string with 139 characters failing. I noticed that shortening the string made it work. But after a great deal of experimenting, I also noticed that replacing a URL which happened to appear inside the text with random text of the same length made it work. In other words, the URL itself is causing a problem. So I thought maybe there was something weird about the URL I was using, but I distilled it down to this. This one works: NSString *body = @"............................................................................................................................................";
 while this does not NSString *body = @"............http://a........................................................................................................................";
 Observations: They are both 140 characters long (and report that way in the console with [body length]). The only difference is the presence of something vaguely URL-like embedded in the middle of the second one. The position of the URL within the string does not seem to matter, but if I change any one of those non-period characters to a period (thus making it not like a URL anymore), it ceases to be broken. If I shorten the broken one, shaving 14 periods off the end, it works. That is, this particular URL embedded in periods for a total length of 126 characters is fine. 127 or larger is broken. Not clear how, or if, this relates to the length of the URL itself. Anybody ever seen something like this? Any idea what is going on? Am I doing something wrong, or is the iOS Twitter Framework just broken?
@CODE:body NSString if (NSClassFromString(@"TWTweetComposeViewController"))  {
    TWTweetComposeViewController *iOS5twitter = [[TWTweetComposeViewController alloc] init];
    [iOS5twitter setInitialText:body];
