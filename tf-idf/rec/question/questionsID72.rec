@TITLE:Retrieving particular lines of text from string..memory management issues
@CONTENT:i am kind of new to iOS development as well as stack over flow .so if there is any problem with my post do tell .. i will correct them. I want to retrieve strings from the text(.rtf) file i have .. the file is within my application main bundle its content are #start word1 First word end word2 Second word end //lots of things to be added later
 Code:  path = [[NSBundle mainBundle]pathForResource:@"words" ofType:@"rtf"];
    if(path)
    {
        NSLog(@"path exists");
    }
    NSError *error = nil;

    NSString *file = [[NSString alloc]initWithContentsOfFile:path encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding error:&error];
    if(error)
    {
        NSLog(@"error");
    }
    NSString *finalword= [[NSString alloc]init ];
    NSString *startfrom = [[NSString alloc] initWithFormat:@"word%i",i+1];
    i++;
    NSLog(@"%@",startfrom);
    NSString *wordoftheday = [[NSString alloc]init ];
    NSScanner *scanner = [NSScanner scannerWithString:file];
    [scanner scanUpToString:startfrom intoString:nil];
    [scanner scanUpToString:@"end" intoString:&wordoftheday];
    finalword = [wordoftheday substringFromIndex:[startfrom length]];
    NSLog(@"%@",finalword);
    Word.text = final word;  //change label text
//[final word release];
//[wordoftheday release];
//[file release];
 code is working fine but it leaves me with memory management issues. app crashes if i release the variables in the last commented code. also this method is in my viewdidload . i want the label to change text when user click a button .. i will have to write the same code again in that method which leaves me with more memory issue. Kindly help..if you have any better recommendation or how to resolve memory issues
@CODE:#start word1 First word end word2 Second word end //lots of things to be added later path = [[NSBundle mainBundle]pathForResource:@"words" ofType:@"rtf"];

@TITLE:How do you change the default widget for all Django date fields in a ModelForm?
@CONTENT:Given a set of typical models: # Application A
from django.db import models
class TypicalModelA(models.Model):
    the_date = models.DateField()

 # Application B
from django.db import models
class TypicalModelB(models.Model):
    another_date = models.DateField()

...
 How might one change the default widget for all DateFields to a custom MyDateWidget? I'm asking because I want my application to have a jQueryUI datepicker for inputting dates. I've considered a custom field that extends django.db.models.DateField with my custom widget. Is this the best way to implement this sort of across-the-board change? Such a change will require specifically importing a special MyDateField into every model, which is labour intensive, prone to developer error (i.e. a few models.DateField's will get through), and in my mind seems like unnecessary duplication of effort. On the other hand, I don't like modifying what could be considered the canonical version of models.DateField. Thoughts and input is appreciated.
@CODE:# Application A
from django.db import models
class TypicalModelA(models.Model):
    the_date = models.DateField()

 # Application B
from django.db import models
class TypicalModelB(models.Model):
    another_date = models.DateField()

@TITLE:What's the best way to show (un/ordered) HTML lists as a top-down tree?
@CONTENT:UL/OLs are can be easily styled/displayed for their natural flow i.e.: Root Level 1 Item 1 Level 1 Item 2 Level 1.1 Item 1 Level 1.1 Item 2 Level 1.1.1 Item 1 Level 1 Item 3 And so on... ...now we have a peculiar requirement to show this like a tree (like how one visualizied binary search trees) with the root at the top and the children nodes below it and so on all the way up to the leaf. It's argued that that's a better way of presentation of the content (each li is max 50 characters long). It's kinda more intuitive to see a top-down decomposition like tree structure with the root at the top. So the question is this: What' the most effective way to show the above list content as a top-down tree (instead of left-to-right as per the natural layout). We can't (and don't want) to use images. The users enter the data in a form like box and it shows up at the point of insertion (think of facebook comment-like feature for nested lists). Is there any way to 'transform' this using CSS, Javascript/Jquery into a tree like view?? (or create it 'as we move along'?). There cannot be a limit to the depth, but sideways scrolling is acceptable. In the natural layout (L-R) we can achieve the visual cue of children through indentation, color-coding and creative use of the border-visibility. I'm at my wits' end for even being able to display this visually like a tree with just HTML/CSS + javascript constructs. No experience in doing this. Any ideas/directions/pointers to articles/plug-ins to use/Off the shelf solutions etc., would be greatly appreciated!

@TITLE:Regex split string of numbers at finding of Alpha Characters
@CONTENT:OK Regex is one of the most confusing things to me. I'm trying to do this in Javascript. I have a search field that the user will enter a series of characters. Codes are either: 999MC111 or just 999MC There is ALWAYS 2 Alpha characters. BUT there may be 1-4 characters at the front and sometimes 1-4 characters at the end. If the code ENDS with the Alpha characters, then I run a certain ajax script. If there are Numbers + 2 letters + numbers....it runs a different ajax script. My struggle is I know \d is for 2 digits....but it may not always be 2 digits. So what would my regex code be to split this into an array. or something. I think correct regex would be (/^([0-9]+)([a-zA-z]+)([0-9]+)$/ But how do i make sure its ONLY 2 alpha characters in middle? Thanks

@TITLE:F# Mailbox vs MailboxProcessor
@CONTENT:I notice the Mailbox type is encapsulated and can only be used through the use of the MailboxProcessor. It implies that to have an agent to which I can post messages, I'm forced to have a single Mailbox of a single type (or use the existing MailboxProcessor in an exotic way). Should I understand that having multiple Mailbox for a single workflow would inherently result in a bad design? The Ccr clearly gives you that level of freedom. Edit: As Daniel pointed out, if one wants to send multiple message types, DUs elegantly solves the problem - and it's not like I haven't done that in the past. But the question is, isn't doing that a code smell? Wouldn't adding more types of messages sent to an agent over time lead you into have too many responsibilities? I sometimes think it would be important to always encapsulate the message types the agent consumes behind an interface such that this information is never exposed.

}
etc...
 Problem is that result can contain much data, to few thousand rows and while mysql is fast enough, that amount of data makes GtkTreeView unacceptable slow (much slower than typing and often shock computer). When I put LIMIT 20 in query this code works OK but then only first 20 rows of matched data are achievable. I think this is so slow because of all redrawing of gtktreeview is active. In some toolkits it is possible to turn of all refreshes while list loads and then simple show results when finish with loading. Is something like that possible in GtkTreeView? Or can I do something else? Like put this function in thread? Or any other solution? Thanks for advice in advanced!

@TITLE:Handling smart pointers in stl container
@CONTENT:I've a class Foo<T> which has a vector of smart pointers to Shape derived classes. I'm trying to implement an at(index) member function. Here's what I would to do intuitively: Foo<float> myfoo;
std::unique_ptr<Shape<float>> shape_ptr = myfoo.at(i);
shape_ptr->doSomething(param1, param2, ...);
 When defining the at(index) function, I'm getting a compiler error message. Note that the move constructor was defined and that the Shape base class is abstract. Below, I'm giving some code for illustration purposes. Furthermore, I found recently on the web an example on how to overload the assignment operator using std::move. I usually follow the Copy-Swap idiom. Which of those two ways for overloading the mentioned operator makes sense for my case? Below, I'm also illustrating the function's definition. template < typename T >

 The Serving model has a field called serving_amount and a field called amount_recorded. In the Serving model, I currently use this validation: validates :serving_size, :numericality => {:greater_than => 0}, :if => :amount_recorded?
 The message returned if the validation fails is terrible. This is compounded by the fact that each meal may have multiple servings. How do I create a custom validation message that refers to the name of the food for which the serving size is invalid? For example, I would like it to say, "You entered an invalid serving size for Watermelon," if amount_recorded is true for a serving of a Food with name watermelon and the validation fails.

@TITLE:Serial COMM port in windows remains owned after closing
@CONTENT:I have a problem with comm ports in JAVA. I'm using Java version, 1.5 because that version still have access to windows COMM ports (serials). The problem is that the command throws the exception: javax.comm.PortInUseException: Port currently owned by Unknown Windows Application
 The thing is that the application opens the comm port for the first time, then I close the comm when the user exits some window. But the user may return to that window, and therefore I try to open again the same port: I close with: if (puertoSerie != null) {
 puertoSerie.removeEventListener();
puertoSerie.close();
puertoSerie = null;
}
 So I added a PortOwnershipListener: idPuerto.addPortOwnershipListener(new MyResolver());
 And the error says: Somebody else has the port
Somebody else has the port
 That occurs when : case PORT_OWNERSHIP_REQUESTED:
if (owned) {
System.out.println("Owned ... Somebody else has the port");
} else {
System.out.println("Somebody else has the port");
}
 Any Idea how to work around this? Best Regards

@CONTENT:Had an interesting error today and couldn't find anything online about it so wondered if any of you guys had seen this behavior before. We had an out of memory error and the CPU usage was spiking this morning on our reports server, a clean reboot seemed to rectify the issue, however since then all the email subscriptions have been sending multiple times. What do i mean by this, the subscription as far as SSRS is concerned ran once at its normal time (10am), this has been proven by scrutinizing the logs to see if another execution occurred (it didn't) and by renaming the SPROC that the report references to ensure that it would fail, yet it didn't and the mail resent. I then checked the Exchange queues and turned on logging for the connection and i could see a new mail being resubmitted every 30mins to the exchange mail queue. The question is, what process is causing that mail to be resubmitted to the exchange server and how, other than another reboot do we stop the emails resending. Thanks in advance -- Further -- Having done more digging we have noticed that the [ReportServer].[dbo].Notifications table is populated with all of the reports that are sending out multiple times with the Attempts column incrementing every time the duplicate email is sent out. We still dont know why these are resending

Something like this... http://www.example.com/locations/new-york#7F1A6245-3BE3-62D5-A4B6-60C5D599BF21 and rewrite to this... http://www.example.com/locations/details.aspx?id=7F1A6245-3BE3-62D5-A4B6-60C5D599BF21 I'm using iis7 with .htaccess file, so I'm pretty sure it's the same regex that you would use for .htaccess with apache. Thanks for the help! EDIT Based on Ulrich Palha's answer here's what I did... RewriteRule ^/locations/(.*)/(.*)$ /locations/details.aspx\?id=$2 [NC,L,U] ...and that works like a charm. Thanks Ulrich!

@TITLE:How to get expanded path from EnvDTE / VCProjectEngine
@CONTENT:I am trying to write a tool to create a zip file containing all PDBs files from one Visual Studio 2010 solution. I can get every PDB filepath in the solution with the following code.

@TITLE:excel vba adding and subtracting values in different cells
@CONTENT:I am working on a kind of scheduling sheet in Excel. In this sheet man days for certain experts and activities are entered. It often occurs that man days have to be shifted between experts and activities. The part I am stuck with is the actual updating of values in the cells. The idea is that all the lines in my first array represent row numbers. I step through each cell in the range look for a value and subtract the shifting days. If the shifting days are greater than the cell value I move to the next and so on until all days are spent. The second routine uses the same system but increases the man days. My problem is that the man days for the source activity are increased and then decreased but the target activity should be increased and the source activity decreased. Structure of the sheet to get the idea - the part in brackets should be updated:      M1 M2 M3 ... EXP1 EXP2 EXP3

@TITLE:How do I make a ManyToMany_Insert template for EF Dynamic Data?
@CONTENT:I'm extremely new to Dynamic Data, but I'll fire this off anyway. I have an EF model set up, with a PJT table linking Shows and Genres. The EDMX correctly displays this as a * - * relationship between Shows and Genres, with navigation properties. Using Dynamic Data, I can create a Show item, but then only once it is created, can I edit it to link up the Genres (which are nicely displayed as check boxes). I've read this http://blogs.msdn.com/b/davidebb/archive/2008/10/25/a-many-to-many-field-template-for-dynamic-data.aspx article which everyone refers to, but I can't see how to use the ManyToMany_Edit.ascx Field template on the Show insert page. Interestingly, in the ManyToMany_Edit.ascx.cs file that I have, there is a comment that says // This field template is used both for Editing and Inserting But I can't see it being used for inserting! Any pointers would be greatly appreciated!

@TITLE:Map partitioned table with partition discriminator column
@CONTENT:I have a legacy Oracle 10g database. This database has a table ITEMDELIVERY with a column DELIVERY_DATE. The table is partitioned by this column. Because of that, the primary key of this table is a compound one involving the columns ITEMDELIVERY_ID and DELIVERY_DATE. There is another table ITEMDELIVERYDETAIL having a FK to ITEMDELIVERY. To be able to benefit from the partitioning and to be able to be partitioned itself, this table has a column PARTITION_DATE. ITEMDELIVERY_ID and PARTITION_DATE form the FK to ITEMDELIVERY. PARTITION_DATE has no business meaning in ITEMDELIVERYDETAIL and is there only for technical reasons. Because of this, I would like to avoid specifying this column in my entity. I tried the following in an implementation of IAutoMappingOverride<ItemDeliveryDetail>: mapping.Map(x => x.ItemDelivery.DeliveryDate).Column("PARTITION_DATE");
 But this didn't work, I get the following exception: NHibernate.PropertyNotFoundException: Could not find a getter for property 'DeliveryDate' in class 'Domain.ItemDeliveryDetail' Is there any way to achieve my goal?

I had to explicitly find it and connect it to all solutions that used it. Also, there was a bigger issue with Moles itself. TestProjects just weren't able to find Microsoft.Moles.Framework.dll. And it generated all kinds of errors. When I tried to add reference to Microsoft.Moles.Framework in "Add Refernce" dialog I got message: "Microsoft.Moles.Framework, Version=0.94.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35" is incompatible with .NET Framework 4 Solution was to explicitly add reference to Microsoft.Moles.Framework.dll in C:\Program Files\Microsoft Moles\PublicAssembliesSilverlight. And after that all works fine so far. I hope this info can be helpfull to someone.

 Previously if suppose they have populate 21A two times means I have used the position as [1] and [2] as while calling tag values. Now they will populate 21 tag repeatedly but tags may be A or D so I need to target 50f tag blindly. Whatever tag they will provide, either A or D before 50F I need to fetch similarly whatever they populate tags after 50F we able to fetch so avoiding positions. Summary: @Treemonkey: hope you had a glance of my sample XML. It has some tag like 21A,50F and so on. Assume if I have two fields field1,field2 earlier they have populated tags as same repeated tags as 21A at that time I have fetched as 21A having beside by marking position [1] for field 1 (tag[name = '21A'][1]) Similarly 21A having beside by marking position [2] for field 2, now they will populate 21 but tags were different as A or D. As I have said field1 should concentrate sequence A and field2 should concentrate as sequence B so now we should not bother about positions for fetch we have a demarcation like tag 50F whatever fields will populate before 50F has to treated as sequence A and after 50F has to be treated as sequence B. So finally we need to write as XSLT by targeting 50F. If I want to display 21A field in (sample XML) which before 50F so we need write a logic in XSLT as select tag 21A before 50F tag for to produce data in field 1 and for field 2 we need to fetch as 21D after 50F so we need to write a logic as select 21D after 50F.

@TITLE:How can I get rid of ft2font import error from matplotlib on a Windows XP source installation?
@CONTENT:So today I tried building matplotlib from source (git clone) on a Windows XP box. First I downloaded and compiled the dependencies (zlib, libpng, freetype2) as per this blog entry. I then edited setup.cfg to make the matplotlib installation aware of the installations of the dependencies. Lastly, python setup.py build and python setup.py install ran without any errors. But when I try a simple script for a sample plot, I get this error:   File "C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\matplotlib\font_manager.py", line 53, in <module>
    from matplotlib import ft2font
ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found.
 Why is this happening, and how can I fix the issue? EDIT: I can find a file called ft2font.pyd in the matplotlib folder in the site-packages folder. This file should be able to be imported as per normal, but somehow it doesn't work. Any help would be appreciated!

 ... The valgrind result shows that one string is deleted twice. But I can't know the right static one. Who has any idea to know deleting which string cause the error and how to fix it? Thanks PS: program is running under linux 2.6.9. gcc version is 4.2.2. dll is used. New Update: Using gdb to list the error lib file, command "l __tcf_0" shows me the following code: inline std::vector<const char*>& get_phase_name_vec(){
  static std::vector<const char*> phase_name_vec(END_RESP+1, (const char*)NULL);
  return phase_name_vec;
}
 This is from OSCI TLM header file. And the above libraries have to include them. It's in a separated namespace "tlm". Any idea to fix this error?

@TITLE:F# Mailbox vs MailboxProcessor
@CONTENT:I notice the Mailbox type is encapsulated and can only be used through the use of the MailboxProcessor. It implies that to have an agent to which I can post messages, I'm forced to have a single Mailbox of a single type (or use the existing MailboxProcessor in an exotic way). Should I understand that having multiple Mailbox for a single workflow would inherently result in a bad design? The Ccr clearly gives you that level of freedom. Edit: As Daniel pointed out, if one wants to send multiple message types, DUs elegantly solves the problem - and it's not like I haven't done that in the past. But the question is, isn't doing that a code smell? Wouldn't adding more types of messages sent to an agent over time lead you into have too many responsibilities? I sometimes think it would be important to always encapsulate the message types the agent consumes behind an interface such that this information is never exposed.

etc...
 Problem is that result can contain much data, to few thousand rows and while mysql is fast enough, that amount of data makes GtkTreeView unacceptable slow (much slower than typing and often shock computer). When I put LIMIT 20 in query this code works OK but then only first 20 rows of matched data are achievable. I think this is so slow because of all redrawing of gtktreeview is active. In some toolkits it is possible to turn of all refreshes while list loads and then simple show results when finish with loading. Is something like that possible in GtkTreeView? Or can I do something else? Like put this function in thread? Or any other solution? Thanks for advice in advanced!

@TITLE:Handling smart pointers in stl container
@CONTENT:I've a class Foo<T> which has a vector of smart pointers to Shape derived classes. I'm trying to implement an at(index) member function. Here's what I would to do intuitively: Foo<float> myfoo;
std::unique_ptr<Shape<float>> shape_ptr = myfoo.at(i);
shape_ptr->doSomething(param1, param2, ...);
 When defining the at(index) function, I'm getting a compiler error message. Note that the move constructor was defined and that the Shape base class is abstract. Below, I'm giving some code for illustration purposes. Furthermore, I found recently on the web an example on how to overload the assignment operator using std::move. I usually follow the Copy-Swap idiom. Which of those two ways for overloading the mentioned operator makes sense for my case?

 The Serving model has a field called serving_amount and a field called amount_recorded. In the Serving model, I currently use this validation: validates :serving_size, :numericality => {:greater_than => 0}, :if => :amount_recorded?
 The message returned if the validation fails is terrible. This is compounded by the fact that each meal may have multiple servings. How do I create a custom validation message that refers to the name of the food for which the serving size is invalid? For example, I would like it to say, "You entered an invalid serving size for Watermelon," if amount_recorded is true for a serving of a Food with name watermelon and the validation fails.

@TITLE:Serial COMM port in windows remains owned after closing
@CONTENT:I have a problem with comm ports in JAVA. I'm using Java version, 1.5 because that version still have access to windows COMM ports (serials). The problem is that the command throws the exception: javax.comm.PortInUseException: Port currently owned by Unknown Windows Application
 The thing is that the application opens the comm port for the first time, then I close the comm when the user exits some window. But the user may return to that window, and therefore I try to open again the same port: I close with: if (puertoSerie != null) {
 puertoSerie.removeEventListener();
puertoSerie.close();
puertoSerie = null;
}
 So I added a PortOwnershipListener: idPuerto.addPortOwnershipListener(new MyResolver());
 And the error says: Somebody else has the port
Somebody else has the port
 That occurs when : case PORT_OWNERSHIP_REQUESTED:
if (owned) {
System.out.println("Owned ... Somebody else has the port");
} else {
System.out.println("Somebody else has the port");
}
 Any Idea how to work around this? Best Regards

@CONTENT:Had an interesting error today and couldn't find anything online about it so wondered if any of you guys had seen this behavior before. We had an out of memory error and the CPU usage was spiking this morning on our reports server, a clean reboot seemed to rectify the issue, however since then all the email subscriptions have been sending multiple times. What do i mean by this, the subscription as far as SSRS is concerned ran once at its normal time (10am), this has been proven by scrutinizing the logs to see if another execution occurred (it didn't) and by renaming the SPROC that the report references to ensure that it would fail, yet it didn't and the mail resent. I then checked the Exchange queues and turned on logging for the connection and i could see a new mail being resubmitted every 30mins to the exchange mail queue. The question is, what process is causing that mail to be resubmitted to the exchange server and how, other than another reboot do we stop the emails resending. Thanks in advance -- Further -- Having done more digging we have noticed that the [ReportServer].[dbo].Notifications table is populated with all of the reports that are sending out multiple times with the Attempts column incrementing every time the duplicate email is sent out. We still dont know why these are resending

@TITLE:excel vba adding and subtracting values in different cells
@CONTENT:I am working on a kind of scheduling sheet in Excel. In this sheet man days for certain experts and activities are entered. It often occurs that man days have to be shifted between experts and activities. The part I am stuck with is the actual updating of values in the cells. The idea is that all the lines in my first array represent row numbers. I step through each cell in the range look for a value and subtract the shifting days. If the shifting days are greater than the cell value I move to the next and so on until all days are spent. The second routine uses the same system but increases the man days. My problem is that the man days for the source activity are increased and then decreased but the target activity should be increased and the source activity decreased. Structure of the sheet to get the idea - the part in brackets should be updated:      M1 M2 M3 ... EXP1 EXP2 EXP3

@CONTENT:I'm extremely new to Dynamic Data, but I'll fire this off anyway. I have an EF model set up, with a PJT table linking Shows and Genres. The EDMX correctly displays this as a * - * relationship between Shows and Genres, with navigation properties. Using Dynamic Data, I can create a Show item, but then only once it is created, can I edit it to link up the Genres (which are nicely displayed as check boxes). I've read this http://blogs.msdn.com/b/davidebb/archive/2008/10/25/a-many-to-many-field-template-for-dynamic-data.aspx article which everyone refers to, but I can't see how to use the ManyToMany_Edit.ascx Field template on the Show insert page. Interestingly, in the ManyToMany_Edit.ascx.cs file that I have, there is a comment that says // This field template is used both for Editing and Inserting But I can't see it being used for inserting! Any pointers would be greatly appreciated!

@TITLE:Map partitioned table with partition discriminator column
@CONTENT:I have a legacy Oracle 10g database. This database has a table ITEMDELIVERY with a column DELIVERY_DATE. The table is partitioned by this column. Because of that, the primary key of this table is a compound one involving the columns ITEMDELIVERY_ID and DELIVERY_DATE. There is another table ITEMDELIVERYDETAIL having a FK to ITEMDELIVERY. To be able to benefit from the partitioning and to be able to be partitioned itself, this table has a column PARTITION_DATE. ITEMDELIVERY_ID and PARTITION_DATE form the FK to ITEMDELIVERY. PARTITION_DATE has no business meaning in ITEMDELIVERYDETAIL and is there only for technical reasons. Because of this, I would like to avoid specifying this column in my entity. I tried the following in an implementation of IAutoMappingOverride<ItemDeliveryDetail>: mapping.Map(x => x.ItemDelivery.DeliveryDate).Column("PARTITION_DATE");
 But this didn't work, I get the following exception: NHibernate.PropertyNotFoundException: Could not find a getter for property 'DeliveryDate' in class 'Domain.ItemDeliveryDetail' Is there any way to achieve my goal?

 Previously if suppose they have populate 21A two times means I have used the position as [1] and [2] as while calling tag values. Now they will populate 21 tag repeatedly but tags may be A or D so I need to target 50f tag blindly. Whatever tag they will provide, either A or D before 50F I need to fetch similarly whatever they populate tags after 50F we able to fetch so avoiding positions. Summary: @Treemonkey: hope you had a glance of my sample XML. It has some tag like 21A,50F and so on. Assume if I have two fields field1,field2 earlier they have populated tags as same repeated tags as 21A at that time I have fetched as 21A having beside by marking position [1] for field 1 (tag[name = '21A'][1]) Similarly 21A having beside by marking position [2] for field 2, now they will populate 21 but tags were different as A or D. As I have said field1 should concentrate sequence A and field2 should concentrate as sequence B so now we should not bother about positions for fetch we have a demarcation like tag 50F whatever fields will populate before 50F has to treated as sequence A and after 50F has to be treated as sequence B. So finally we need to write as XSLT by targeting 50F. If I want to display 21A field in (sample XML) which before 50F so we need write a logic in XSLT as select tag 21A before 50F tag for to produce data in field 1 and for field 2 we need to fetch as 21D after 50F so we need to write a logic as select 21D after 50F.

@TITLE:How can I get rid of ft2font import error from matplotlib on a Windows XP source installation?
@CONTENT:So today I tried building matplotlib from source (git clone) on a Windows XP box. First I downloaded and compiled the dependencies (zlib, libpng, freetype2) as per this blog entry. I then edited setup.cfg to make the matplotlib installation aware of the installations of the dependencies. Lastly, python setup.py build and python setup.py install ran without any errors. But when I try a simple script for a sample plot, I get this error:   File "C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\matplotlib\font_manager.py", line 53, in <module>
    from matplotlib import ft2font
ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found.
 Why is this happening, and how can I fix the issue? EDIT: I can find a file called ft2font.pyd in the matplotlib folder in the site-packages folder. This file should be able to be imported as per normal, but somehow it doesn't work. Any help would be appreciated!

 It seems like double free at one object. Then I used gdb to debug the coredump file. The following is the bt result(more traces are not posted): #0 0x005197a2 in _dl_sysinfo_int80 () from /lib/ld-linux.so.2

 ... The valgrind result shows that one string is deleted twice. But I can't know the right static one. Who has any idea to know deleting which string cause the error and how to fix it? Thanks PS: program is running under linux 2.6.9. gcc version is 4.2.2. dll is used. New Update: Using gdb to list the error lib file, command "l __tcf_0" shows me the following code: inline std::vector<const char*>& get_phase_name_vec(){
  static std::vector<const char*> phase_name_vec(END_RESP+1, (const char*)NULL);
  return phase_name_vec;
}
 This is from OSCI TLM header file. And the above libraries have to include them. It's in a separated namespace "tlm". Any idea to fix this error?

But everything works well in the test project. There isn't any error details printed on the terminal of Eclipse so I can't decide the problem. It is -keepattributes LocalVariableTable makes proguard produce malformed code.

@CONTENT:I am developing an iPhone application which will use NSRegularExpression to match pattern from a string to extract information. Here I am trying to extract the mailTo link from an email header. I have successfully retrieved the email header string and now I am applying the the search pattern using NSregularExpression to get the email id from the header string. This is the header text from where I want to extract mailTo : List-Unsubscribe: <mailto:suksh-1142-5451-d8135921c2e2d40400ab02fa31eda529@usub.mailserv.in>?subject=Unsubscribe>,<http://suksh.mailserv.in/suksh/?p=unsubscribe&mid=5451&uid=d8135921c2e2d40400ab02fa31eda529>> This is the search pattern: mailto:(?<address>[^\?^>]+)\??(?<params>[^>]+)?
 my code is like this NSString *str= @"List-Unsubscribe: <mailto:suksh-1142-5451-d8135921c2e2d40400ab02fa31eda529@usub.mailserv.in>?subject=Unsubscribe>,<http://suksh.mailserv.in/suksh/?p=unsubscribe&mid=5451&uid=d8135921c2e2d40400ab02fa31eda529>>";

 but when I am going to create the NSRegularExpression object by the help of regularExpressionWithPattern: it is returning nil object. Please assist me what can be the issue. Thanks in advance

@TITLE:Multithreaded File Compare Performance
@CONTENT:I just stumbled onto this SO question and was wondering if there would be any performance improvement if: The file was compared in blocks no larger than the hard disk sector size (1/2KB, 2KB, or 4KB) AND the comparison was done multithreaded (or maybe even with the .NET 4 parallel stuff) I imagine there being 2 threads: one that reads from the beginning of the file and another that reads from the end until they meet in the middle. I understand in this situation the disk IO is going to be the slowest part but if the reads never have to cross sector boundries (which in my twisted imagination somehow eliminates any possible fragmentation overhead) then it may potentially reduce head moves hence resulting in better performance (maybe?). Of course other factors could play in as well, such as, single vs multiple processors/cores or SSD vs non-SSD, but with those aside; is the disk IO speed + potentially sharing processor time insurmountable? Or perhaps my concept of computer theory is completely off-base...

 I made a new rails app and tested the rake assets:precompile and it's working. The only difference between the two apps in terms of relevant files would be what gems I have installed. "application.js" is the same between both apps...as are the environment.rb files. Also of note...when I include a random .js file in my assets/javascripts directory and use "javascript_include_tag :application", one of the resulting URLs in dev mode look like so: /assets/../javascripts/anytimec.js?body=1 and they obviously fail with 404. However the application.js file is referenced correctly. UPDATE: Looking into what Sprockets generates I've noticed that the "logical path" uses "../javascripts" in the location. I tested this by looking at the dump of asset_paths.asset_for('application','js') and asset_paths.asset_for('anytimec','js') respectively. I've also compared those dumps to the same files from a fresh application. The fresh application does NOT prepend the "../javascripts" to the location whereas my current app DOES. It doesn't do this to the CSS files or anything else...just javascript. This is most definitely alluding to the core problem but I don't know where to go from here.

@CONTENT:I have a query like: select
    CONVERT(VARCHAR(7),[startdatetime],111) AS [year-month],
    nm.nameLine1,
    sum(datediff(hour, startdatetime, enddatetime)) as total 
from  srl
inner join  sr on srl= sr.ServiceRequestId
inner join Name nm on(sr.clientCustomerId = nm.customerId and nm.nameTypeId = 'OFICE')
where (startdatetime >= '08-01-2011 00:00:00.000' and enddatetime <= '10-31-2011 00:00:00.000')
group by nm.nameLine1, [year-month]
order by nm.nameLine1, [year-month]
 output of the above query is:: year-month nameLine1       total       
---------- ---------       ----------- 
2011/08    B               4 
2011/09    B               7 
2011/10    B               0 
2011/08    E               167 
2011/09    E               212 
2011/10    E               131 
2011/08    L               14 
2011/09    L               23 
2011/10    L               3 
2011/08    O               18 
2011/09    O               8

2011/09    S               60 
2011/10    S               60 
 Now my question is, what should I do in the query to get the summation in a different column called nameLine1total for a single nameLine1. The output should be like this: year-month nameLine1       total            nameLine1total

@TITLE:Markdown for automatic doc generation?
@CONTENT:I've use javadoc, as well as a variety of different XML based doc-generation systems. Javadoc is fine, XML based doc-generators are hideous, with the XML getting all over the comments and turning the comments into soup. I've looked at markdown, and the fact that it is easily parseable into structured data but also super human-readable would make it perfect for in-code comments, where the readability of both the docs and the plaintext is of utmost importance. Are there any markdown based doc-generators out there already? Is there any reason why it wouldn't work which I don't know of?

@LINK:/questions/8467745/upload-from-android-on-python-appengine-and-read-the-file
@TITLE:Upload from Android on Python AppEngine and read the file
@CONTENT:I want to send a csv file from Android to Python AppEngine. I'm using the Blobstore API and to send the file, I use MultipartEntity, HttpPost and HttpGet. So, according to the Blobstore API, you must call the method create_upload_url('/upload') to generate the url to upload the file and you use this url as the action to upload the file. As you can read here What am I doing? I call a method that creates this url and return it to my android app. And with this url I upload the file. The url generated is in this format: myapp.appspot.com/_ah/upload/a-lot-of-numbers-and-letters/ Basically like this: Android Code  HttpClient httpClient = new DefaultHttpClient();
 HttpGet httpGet = new HttpGet(mContext.getString("myapp.appspot.com/get_blobstore_url");

 HttpResponse urlResponse = httpClient.execute(httpGet);

 result = EntityUtils.toString(urlResponse.getEntity());

 Uri fileUri = Uri.parse("file:///sdcard/dir/myfile.csv"); // Gets the Uri of the file in the sdcard
 File file = new File(new URI(fileUri.toString())); // Extracts the file from the Uri

 FileBody fileBody = new FileBody(file, "multipart/form-data");

 MultipartEntity entity = new MultipartEntity(HttpMultipartMode.BROWSER_COMPATIBLE);
 entity.addPart("file", fileBody);

 HttpPost httpPost = new HttpPost(result);

 httpPost.setEntity(entity);

 HttpResponse response = httpClient.execute(httpPost);
 response.getStatusLine();
 AppEngine Code # Returns only the URL in which the file will be uploaded, so this URL may be used in client for upload the file
class GetBlobstoreUrl(webapp.RequestHandler):
    def get(self):
        logging.info('here')
        upload_url = blobstore.create_upload_url('/upload')
        logging.info("url blob %s", upload_url)
        self.response.out.write(upload_url)

class UploadHandler(blobstore_handlers.BlobstoreUploadHandler):
    def post(self):
        logging.info('inside upload handler')
        upload_files = self.get_uploads('file')
        blob_info = upload_files[0]
        return blob_info.key()

def main():
    application = webapp.WSGIApplication([('/upload', UploadHandler), ('/get_blobstore_url', GetBlobstoreUrl)], debug=True)
    run_wsgi_app(application)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
 Question 1 When I send the file to the url the AppEngine returned, this will automatically call the server method UploadHandler? Because the log message inside this method is not being showed, and the file is being inserted, and the response I get when uploading the file with the generated url is a 404 error, why that error if the file is being uploaded? Question 2 After I upload the file, how can I parse the csv file in the server and insert all the data in the file to the datastore? Thanks.
@CODE:MultipartEntity HttpPost HttpGet create_upload_url('/upload') HttpClient httpClient = new DefaultHttpClient();
 HttpGet httpGet = new HttpGet(mContext.getString("myapp.appspot.com/get_blobstore_url");

 HttpResponse urlResponse = httpClient.execute(httpGet);

 result = EntityUtils.toString(urlResponse.getEntity());

 Uri fileUri = Uri.parse("file:///sdcard/dir/myfile.csv"); // Gets the Uri of the file in the sdcard
 File file = new File(new URI(fileUri.toString())); // Extracts the file from the Uri

 FileBody fileBody = new FileBody(file, "multipart/form-data");

 MultipartEntity entity = new MultipartEntity(HttpMultipartMode.BROWSER_COMPATIBLE);
 entity.addPart("file", fileBody);

 HttpPost httpPost = new HttpPost(result);

 httpPost.setEntity(entity);

@TITLE:Why does referencing break when done through pointers
@CONTENT:i have a referenced default constructor for a class test. class test {
public:
    test(int &input1) : int_test(input1) {};
    ~test() {};

    int & int_test; 
}; 
 Then 2 more classes which interact with test as follows: class notebook
{ 
public:
    notebook() {};
    ~notebook() {};

    int int_notebook;
};

class factory
{
public: 
    factory() {};
    ~factory(){};

    notebook *p_notebook;
};
 If i intitalise test (t2) with an integer, this works as expected: int _tmain(int argc, _TCHAR* argv[]){

    int var=90;
    test t2(var);
    cout<<t2.int_test; // this gives 90
    var=30;
    cout<<t2.int_test; // this gives 30
 Once i initialised the test class with a pointer to a member of class notebook through a third class factory: factory f1;
notebook s1;
notebook s2;
s1.int_notebook=10;
s2.int_notebook=2;

int notebook::*p_notebook= &notebook::int_notebook;
f1.p_notebook=&s1;

test t1(((f1.p_notebook->*p_notebook)));
cout<<t1.int_test; // This gives  10
 however if i change the pointer of f1.p_notebook to another object of notebook s2; f1.p_notebook=&s2;
cout<<t1.int_test; // This gives  10
 the reference member of a of t1 (t1.int_test) doesnt reflect the change of the pointer. could some one explain to me why ? or what i'm doing wrong here.
@CODE:class test {

@TITLE:OpenGL - Extra line appears when I draw a border on a cube
@CONTENT:I've been trying to figure this out for a while, but I'm failing. I need to draw a cube, and then add a border around it. The cube works fine, and I got the border to draw, but there's always an extra line sticking in. I use the GL_ARRAY_BUFFER to store data and switch from GL_TRIANGLES (to draw the cube itself) to GL_LINES (to draw the outline borders). Each offset in the buffer has its own set of vertices. My code for the display function (GLUT): // cubeLen = number of cube's vertices in buffer
// sidesLen = number of side vertices in buffer
glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);
glDrawArrays(GL_TRIANGLES, 0, cubeLen);
glDrawArrays(GL_LINES, cubeLen, cubeLen + sidesLen);
glutSwapBuffers();
 My code to set up the buffers: GLuint buffer;
glGenBuffers( 1, &buffer );
glBindBuffer( GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, buffer );
glBufferData( GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(points) + sizeof(colors)
                + sizeof(points2) + sizeof(colors2),
                NULL, GL_STATIC_DRAW );

glBufferSubData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, 0, sizeof(points), points);
glBufferSubData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(points), sizeof(colors), colors);
glBufferSubData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(points) + sizeof(colors),
                sizeof(points2), points2);
glBufferSubData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(points) + sizeof(colors) + sizeof(points2),
                sizeof(colors2), colors2);
 I use 12 triangles (3 vertices each) for each side of the cube, and 12 lines (24 vertices) to cover all of the edges. The cube and edges are in sycn sitting at the center of the screen (centered at 0,0,0). The extra unwanted line (which appears to stretch from the center-left 3D position to the center-front 3D position) to comes in even if I disable drawing the cube in the display function. It does, however, go away when I do not set up vertices for the cube. Any ideas why this might be happening? Thanks for any and all help.
@CODE:// cubeLen = number of cube's vertices in buffer
// sidesLen = number of side vertices in buffer
glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);

@TITLE:How do I access a cell in Excel Interop when using filtered ranges?
@CONTENT:I originally had a code segment that iterated through rows of an Excel spreadsheet using the UsedRange as such:            range = ws.UsedRange;
           for (int row = 3; row <= range.Rows.Count; row++)
            {
                Object nObj = ((Excel.Range)ws.Cells[row, "N"]).Text;
            }
 But I needed to only get the rows that remained after I applied a filter so (after viewing How can I get the Range of filtered rows using Excel Interop?) I changed the code as such:     range = ws.UsedRange.SpecialCells(Excel.XlCellType.xlCellTypeVisible, Type.Missing);
    foreach (Excel.Range area in range.Areas)
    {
        foreach (Excel.Range row in area.Rows)

                Object nObj = ((Excel.Range)ws.Cells[row, "N"]).Text;
            }
    }
 Except now I'm getting type mismatch errors. What fundamental thing am I missing here?

+--------|        |
         +--------+
 How can I get round this? (I thought maybe I need to tell the navbar to draw itself again somehow, but don't know how.) Thanks.
@CODE:<div data-role="content">
  <div data-role="navbar">
    <ul>
      <li><a href="javascript:audioPause();" id="play-btn">Pause</a></li>
      <li><a href="javascript:audioStop();" id="stop-btn">Stop</a></li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div> $('#play-btn').text('Play'); +--------+--------+
| play   |  stop  |
+--------|        |
         +--------+

@TITLE:Getting form values with MvcPager
@CONTENT:When I select any page of my PagedList<T> the [HttpGet]method is activated. Because of this, Im not able to use Request.Form.GetValues(). I just saw the Requestvariable into the immediate window and realized that I dont see any value that I want from the IDs that I have ( the request dont bring me any value of any ID of the screen, since Im not using the post method). I got a grid (table) and one field of each record is a checkbox, after the pagination, I need know wich checkbox is enabled to keep it checked ( I already made the code to keep it checked, I just need to know how Im going to see if those checkboxes are checked. I already know their ID too. Im using the following control to generate those checkboxes: //foreachloop 
<%: Html.CheckBox(item.ID.ToString(), item.isChecked)%>
 For my pagination, Im using the following: Aspx: <%: Html.Pager(Model.ListaGridPaginada)%> This pager is a overload that calls the following: public static MvcHtmlString Pager(this HtmlHelper helper, int totalPageCount, int pageIndex, string actionName, string controllerName, 
        PagerOptions pagerOptions, string routeName, RouteValueDictionary routeValues, IDictionary<string, object> htmlAttributes)
    {
        var builder = new PagerBuilder
            (
                helper,
                actionName,
                controllerName,
                totalPageCount,
                pageIndex,
                pagerOptions,
                routeName,
                routeValues,
                htmlAttributes
            );
        return builder.RenderPager();
    }
 I call the method wich constructs this variable with the following parameters: public static MvcHtmlString Pager<T>(this HtmlHelper helper, PagedList<T> pagedList)
    {
        if (pagedList == null)
            return Pager(helper,null, null);
        return Pager(helper, pagedList.TotalPageCount, pagedList.CurrentPageIndex, null, null, null,null, null,null);
    }
 This pagerHelper is from Webdiyer
@CODE:PagedList<T> [HttpGet] Request.Form.GetValues() Request //foreachloop

    Course course = new Course();
    courses.add(course);
}
 I am adding new Course object with null price additionalInfo and date to the list used by ui:repeat. Instead I get new <div class="term"> 
 part with values copied from previous entry. When I remove element from list (In managedBean proper object from list is removed) I see data from object which was just removed :/ Did someone encounter this kind of problem? Do you have any advice?

@TITLE:Trying to set css property LEFT to using Jquery - Centering image inside DIV
@CONTENT:This code is supposed to reposition gallery images inside of their square div boxes. All the images have a set height e.g. 100px. But their widths are different. Rather than only show the left-most 100px of every picture, I'd rather it show the center. All I need is to go through each img and change the left property to shift the images left. $('img.gall_imgs').load(function() {

    var $imgWidth = parseInt($(this).width); // "$(this)" or "this"? parseInt() needed?
    var $divWidth = parseInt($(this).closest('div').width);

    if($imgWidth > $divWidth) { // if img is wider than its containing div, we'll shift it left
        var $position = -1 * ($imgWidth/2 - $divWidth/2); // will give decimals?
        $position = parseInt($position) + "px"; // make $position format "123px". parseInt() needed here?
        // var $position = '-50px'; // tested with pre-set position
            this.css("left", $position); // "$(this)" or "this"?
        }
    //}
});
 Also, I don't even know how to test variables values inside of jquery. I tried putting in an alert($imgWidth) but it obviously didn't work. EDIT: Here is the CSS and HTML I have now: .gall_thumb_img { // the div surrounding the img

    width:200px;
    height:200px;
    margin-left:auto;
    margin-right:auto;
    overflow:hidden;
    text-align:center; // just added this per suggestions. No effect

}
.gall_thumb_img img{ // the img
    position:absolute;

    display:block;
    height:200px;
    min-width:200px;

}
 HTML: <div id="gall_box">
    <div class="gall_thumb_box" id="gall_thumb_box_0" >
            <div class="gall_thumb_img" id="gall_thumb_img_0" >

                <a href="?c=ecards&v=single&idx=23&img_dir=nature">

                </div>
    </div>
</div>
 EDIT2: Here is what I've changed the jquery to based on various suggestions. Still no change in end result. $(window).load(function() {
    $('img.gall_imgs').each(function() {
        var imgWidth = $(this).width(); // "$(this)" or "this"?
        var divWidth = $(this).closest('div').width();
        alert(imgWidth);
        if(imgWidth > divWidth) {
            var position = -1 * (imgWidth/2 - divWidth/2); // will give decimals?
            position = position + "px"; // make position format "123px". 
            // var position = '-50px'; // tested with set position
                this.css("left", position); // "$(this)" or "this"?
            }
    });
});
 Text-align center is a good idea that I will use if I can get it to work, but I would still like to know why my jquery code is not working. Thank you.

@TITLE:Image compositing of two Images
@CONTENT:I am trying to solve a problem of compositing two images in Java. The program will take a part of the first image and past it on the second image. The goal is to make the boundary between the two images less visible. The boundary must be chosen in such a way that the difference between the two images at the boundary is small. My Tasks: To write a method to choose the boundary between the two images. The method will receive the overlapping parts of the input images. This must first be transformed so that the boundary always starts from the left-top corner to the right-bottom corner. NOTE: The returned image should not be the joined image but gives which parts of the two images were used. The pixels of the boundary line can be marked with a constant(SEAM). Pixels of the first image can be marked with integer 0, pixels of the second image with integer 1. After choosing the boundary line, the floodfill algorithm can be used to fill the extra pixels with 0 or 1. NOTE: The image can be represented as a graph whereby each pixel is connected with its left, right, top and bottom neighbor. So using the flood fill will be like depth-first search. The shortest path algorithm must be used to choose the boundary in order to make it small. NOTE: I can not use any java data structure except Arrays (not even ArrayList) Guys, am new in this area and am trying to solve it. What steps must I follow to solve this problem? or a pointer to a tutorial

@CONTENT:a couple of days ago, I posted here and got a great response on how to handle the arrays. This was exactly what I needed foreach ($_POST['name'] as $key=>$name) {
  echo "Name: $name  Age: {$_POST['age'][$key]}";
}
 the problem is, I need it not to print but to persist. Im making session variables like $_SESSION["name"]= "some name"; I wanna know how I can dump the POST array from above into a $SESSION[Array]; ultimately, to be able to re dump all of the data at will on any page. I need access to both $name in the array and the $age and I would like them to be associated. In java I would do String[][] something = new String[10][2]; //10 is size and 2 allows for name at index 0 and age at index 1. 
 Something things to keep in mind. The size of the POST array is not set. They may be anywhere from 0 inputs to 100. Along with saving the array, could you please tell me how to access it. Im use to java, so php arrays are new to me. EDIT After Trying johnps post my page looks like this foreach ($_POST['name'] as $key=>$name) {
  echo "Name: $name  Age: {$_POST['age'][$key]} <br/>";
     $_SESSION['post_data'][$key] = $name;
     $_SESSION['post_data'][$key] = $_POST['age'];
    echo $key; 
}
 and the output on the page is Name: The name potion Age: adult
1
 However, Ive tried the following to get "The Name Position" as output and nothing is working echo $_SESSION['post_data']['name'];//doesnt have an output
echo $_SESSION['post_data'][$key];//out puts "Array" and nothing else
 I would like the output to be The name Position, Adult. Just like the foreach loop is doing right now, but from a 2d array. Thanks guys.
@CODE:foreach ($_POST['name'] as $key=>$name) {
  echo "Name: $name  Age: {$_POST['age'][$key]}";
} $_SESSION["name"]= "some name"; String[][] something = new String[10][2]; //10 is size and 2 allows for name at index 0 and age at index 1. foreach ($_POST['name'] as $key=>$name) {

@LINK:/questions/8462146/cant-allocate-cllocationmanager
@TITLE:Can't allocate CLLocationManager
@CONTENT:In my UIViewController's initWithNibNameOrNil, I call: locationManager = [CLLocationManager new];
 to create the object, then later in viewDidAppear I call: [locationManager startUpdatingLocation];
[locationManager startUpdatingHeading];
 But I never receive a location update; the location manager never starts updating the location. Yet if I replace that same line the initWithNibNameOrNil with: locationManager = [[myAppDelegate appDelegate] locationManager];
 everything works great, except for random crashes sometimes when locationManager.delegate = self;
 is set in the very next line after location manager is set to the already allocated manager in the app delegate. None of this makes sense to me; I don't understand why one is different from the other, much less why neither of them works consistently. Can someone please enlighten me? Summary: Method 1 (does not work): In MapView.m: initWithNibNameOrNil: - (id)initWithNibName:(NSString *)nibNameOrNil bundle:(NSBundle *)nibBundleOrNil {
    self = [super initWithNibName:nibNameOrNil bundle:nibBundleOrNil];
    if(self) {
        locationManager = [CLLocationManager new];
        locationManager.delegate = self;
        locationManager.distanceFilter = kCLHeadingFilterNone;
        locationManager.headingFilter = 3;

        if(([[UIDevice currentDevice] batteryState] == UIDeviceBatteryStateCharging) || ([[UIDevice currentDevice] batteryState] == UIDeviceBatteryStateFull))
            locationManager.desiredAccuracy = kCLLocationAccuracyBestForNavigation;
        else
            locationManager.desiredAccuracy = kCLLocationAccuracyBest;

        //more setup irrelevant to the question
    }
    return self;
}
 viewDidAppear: - (void)viewDidAppear:(BOOL)animated {
    [super viewDidAppear:YES];
    [locationManager startUpdatingLocation];
    [locationManager startUpdatingHeading];
}
 Notes: Using this method of creating the location manager, location services never get enabled after startUpdatingLocation is called in viewDidAppear and so no location updates are ever received. Method 2 (does work, mostly): In myAppDelegate.m: - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
    [[UIDevice currentDevice] setBatteryMonitoringEnabled:YES];

    self.locationManager = [CLLocationManager new];
    self.locationManager.distanceFilter = kCLHeadingFilterNone;
    self.locationManager.headingFilter = 3;

    if(([[UIDevice currentDevice] batteryState] == UIDeviceBatteryStateCharging) || ([[UIDevice currentDevice] batteryState] == UIDeviceBatteryStateFull))
        self.locationManager.desiredAccuracy = kCLLocationAccuracyBestForNavigation;
    else
        self.locationManager.desiredAccuracy = kCLLocationAccuracyBest;

    //more irrelevant setup
}
 In MapView.m: - (id)initWithNibName:(NSString *)nibNameOrNil bundle:(NSBundle *)nibBundleOrNil {
    self = [super initWithNibName:nibNameOrNil bundle:nibBundleOrNil];
    if(self) {
        locationManager = [[Trail_TrackerAppDelegate appDelegate] locationManager];
        locationManager.delegate = self;
        //more irrelevant setup
    }
    return self;
}

- (void)viewDidAppear:(BOOL)animated {
    [super viewDidAppear:YES];
    [locationManager startUpdatingLocation];
    [locationManager startUpdatingHeading];
}
 Notes: this allocation method works, except if I push MapView, then pop it, push it again, pop it again, then try to push it again, I get a crash every time at the line in initWithNib... where I set the delegate to self; NSZombieEnabled says: -[CLLocationManager setDelegate:]: message sent to deallocated instance 0x9540ad0
 Interesting... NSLog(@"%s: %@; %@", PRETTY_FUNCTION, self, locationManager) says this: -[MapView initWithNibName:bundle:]: <MapView: 0x92ae3e0>; <CLLocationManager: 0x92a3560>
 Method 3 (works all-around): In MapView.m: - (void)viewDidAppear:(BOOL)animated {
    [super viewDidAppear:YES];
    locationManager = [CLLocationManager new];
    locationManager.delegate = self;
    locationManager.distanceFilter = kCLHeadingFilterNone;
    locationManager.headingFilter = 3;

    if(([[UIDevice currentDevice] batteryState] == UIDeviceBatteryStateCharging) || ([[UIDevice currentDevice] batteryState] == UIDeviceBatteryStateFull))
        locationManager.desiredAccuracy = kCLLocationAccuracyBestForNavigation;
    else
        locationManager.desiredAccuracy = kCLLocationAccuracyBest;

    [locationManager startUpdatingLocation];
    [locationManager startUpdatingHeading];
}
 Notes: all of the allocation and setup is done in viewDidAppear, and I don't get any crashes after repeated pushing/popping of the view controller. This is great, but I don't like allocating in viewDidAppear because the app lags for just a moment because (I think) the allocation of locationManager clogs up the main thread for that time. I just really don't understand why Method 1 doesn't work at all, Method 2 crashes, and Method 3 works. Don't they all do more-or-less the same thing?

@TITLE:How to make a variable name without creating an array in C++?
@CONTENT:How do you make a variable name where you create a variable and then in brackets the variable number? (By the way, I'm just guessing out how the code should be so that you get what I'm trying to say.) For example: int var[5];
//create a variable var[5], but not var[4], var[3], var[2], etc.
 Then, the variable number must be able to be accessed by a variable value: int number = 5;
int var[number]; //creates a var[5], not a var[4], etc.
int var[2]; //creates a var[2], not a var[1], etc.
cout >>var[number];
number = 2;
cin << var[number];
 If I'm way off track with my "example", please suggest something else. I need something similar to this for my game to operate, because I must be able to create an unlimited instance of bullets, but they will also be destroyed at one point.
@CODE:int var[5];
//create a variable var[5], but not var[4], var[3], var[2], etc. int number = 5;
int var[number]; //creates a var[5], not a var[4], etc.
int var[2]; //creates a var[2], not a var[1], etc.
cout >>var[number];
number = 2;

@TITLE:webkitfullscreenchange event not firing on iPad
@CONTENT:I'm working on some video controls for the iPad. When the user clicks a button, the video plays and immediately goes fullscreen. When the user clicks the "Exit fullscreen" button, I want the video to pause. If I could disable the "Exit fullscreen" button and force the user to use the "Done" button I would, but that doesn't seem to be an option. My problem is that the webkitfullscreenchange event does not seem to fire on the iPad. It works flawlessly in Chrome on the desktop. I've read that the iPad browser won't run your event if metadata has not been loaded (which doesn't load until the video is played on the iPad - preload is ignored), but I have confirmed that metadata has been loaded before the fullscreen event is firing. Does anyone have any ideas on why the webkitfullscreenchange event will not fire on the iPad? <script type="text/javascript">

@CONTENT:I generally use VB.Net for programming but I have been delegated to a VBA project that would benefit from using script control for running script. Here is sample code but errors out on the .Run line of code. I can do this in VB.Net easy but can't get it to work in vba. ERROR = Wrong number of arguments or invalid property assignent Option Explicit
Dim sc As New ScriptControl

I'm trying to show a message after the page has fully loaded. Using $(document).ready, document.readyStateChange, I don't care. The thing is that the document gets ready right in the middle of a script that needs to be executed. I've tried to do it with window.onload (and it's jQuery equivalent), but it shows me the message before some images/elements show up. Is there a way to wait for it to be executed and only then show up the message? (Please keep in mind that I might need to do it several times in the same page). Thanks in advance!

@TITLE:What is wrong with extending AlertDialog also Why no automatic IME in EditText in the dialog
@CONTENT:I've got this dialog (I'm simplifying my use case): class EditShoppingListDialog extends AlertDialog {

    public EditShoppingListDialog(Context context) {
        super(context/*, R.style.AppCustomDialog*/);
    }

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.dialog_addshoppinglist);
        setTitle("Mike Testing");
    }
}
 I create and use this subclassed AlertDialog outside of the OnCreateDialog method (in the onContextItemSelected of my Activity) like this: AlertDialog dialog = new EditShoppingListDialog(this);
dialog.show();
 Now, I've been working with this code base for over a month now and never saw any problems, which lead me to wonder why they recommend using AlertDialog.Builder for creating custom dialogs also. When I deployed my app to a real device, I immediately started to see problems. The most blocking of them is that I cannot get the soft keyboard (IME?) to show up even when I click on an EditText field in the AlertDialog. Here's the best part; If I say: class EditShoppingListDialog extends Dialog {
    ...
}
 The IME appears appears automatically if I click in an EditText in the dialog. I found this thread but the accepted solution does not work with AlertDialog. However, I found doing this on the OnCreate of my derived AlertDialog helps show the IME, but it goes behind the dialog and I can't interact with it: InputMethodManager imm = (InputMethodManager) getContext().getSystemService(Context.INPUT_METHOD_SERVICE);
imm.toggleSoftInput(InputMethodManager.SHOW_IMPLICIT,0);
 I'm really sorry for the lost post, but I've spent more than 5 hours on this and would be very grateful for some help. The reason I insist on extending an AlertDialog is because I need a dialog without a title bar and it says in the Android Dialog documentation that I cannot have a Dialog without a title bar.
@CODE:class EditShoppingListDialog extends AlertDialog {

    public EditShoppingListDialog(Context context) {
        super(context/*, R.style.AppCustomDialog*/);
    }

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.dialog_addshoppinglist);
        setTitle("Mike Testing");
    }
} AlertDialog dialog = new EditShoppingListDialog(this);
dialog.show(); AlertDialog.Builder class EditShoppingListDialog extends Dialog {
    ...
} InputMethodManager imm = (InputMethodManager) getContext().getSystemService(Context.INPUT_METHOD_SERVICE);

@TITLE:WCF/Entity Framework with External SQL Server DB Does Not Work when Deployed to IIS
@CONTENT:I have a simple WCF project that uses the Entity Framework to access the AdventureWorks database. Its actually out of a book Windows Communication Foundation 4: Step by Step. The catch is that the SQL Server database is not a local SQL Server Express instance but a full SQL Server 2008 R2 instance on an external machine called win01s305. I created a Data Model from the external Database by Generate from Database. The data access works fully with the built-in ASP.NET Web Server (Cassini?) until I publish the WCF service to IIS. Then the credentials/account are different on the remote SQL server machine and the data access stops working. The book specifies a script if you have trouble: USE [AdventureWorks]
GO
CREATE USER [IIS APPPOOL\DefaultAppPool] FOR LOGIN [IIS APPPOOL\DefaultAppPool]
GO
EXEC sp_addrolemember N'db_owner', [IIS APPPOOL\DefaultAppPool]
GO
GO
CREATE USER [IIS APPPOOL\ASP.NET v4.0] FOR LOGIN [IIS APPPOOL\ASP.NET v4.0]
GO
EXEC sp_addrolemember N'db_owner', [IIS APPPOOL\ASP.NET v4.0]
GO
 The issue is these accounts do NOT exist on the remote SQL Server machine. The machine does not have IIS or the .NET Framework on it, just SQL Server. How can I do this?

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 Question> Is there a better design that I can combine both auto getter+setter generation and PIMPL design pattern into this public API interface? Thank you // ****** Updated ************ After reading all those articles, I am convinced that getter and setter are evil. Now the question comes to how to avoid them all together. For example, class Bond
{
    ...

private:
    long m_lPrice;
    std::string m_strBondName;
    int  m_iVolume;
}
 Give the above class Bond which includes three member variables, without using getter and setter, how does client get the price, name, or volume of an bond object? This is the another example of getter/setter in Qt4. Here's the improved QProgressBar API: class QProgressBar : public QWidget
{
    ...
public:
    void setMinimum(int minimum);
    int minimum() const;
    void setMaximum(int maximum);
    int maximum() const;
    void setRange(int minimum, int maximum);
    int value() const;

    virtual QString text() const;
    void setTextVisible(bool visible);
    bool isTextVisible() const;
    Qt::Alignment alignment() const;
    void setAlignment(Qt::Alignment alignment);

public slots:
    void reset();
    void setValue(int value);

signals:
    void valueChanged(int value);
    ...
};

@TITLE:Opening URL on Android web browser causes Google search
@CONTENT:I'm having a slight problem opening a certain URL in the browser. First of all I use the following code to launch the browser: Intent browserIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, Uri.parse(Globals.currentChatURL)); 
startActivity(Intent.createChooser(browserIntent, "Select browser:"));
 Now if I set Globals.currentChatURL to something like http://www.google.com then it opens that site just fine. But my URL is a little more complicated as it contains multiple parameters which are all base64 encoded. Here is an example of how my URL looks: http://webportal.mysite.com/ChatProgram/chat.php? intgroup=UFYyMA==&intid=UFYyMEZN&hg=Pw__&pref=user&en=U0NPVFQgTUlMTEFS&ee=cGF1bGdAbWFnbmF0ZWNoLmNvbQ==&eq=UFRWRkVI&ec=TUFHTkFURUNI Now if I use my above code to try and launch this URL it brings me to the Google search page with the following message: "Your search - http://URLabove ... did not match any documents" Yet if I copy the URL and paste it into the address box it brings me to the right place. How can I fix this?? The whole point of this is to have the user click the button and the site to launch, not for the user to have to copy and paste the URL manually. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks a lot

@CONTENT:Let's say I have two modules in a python project that are written in C++ and exposed with boost::python. mod1.hpp #ifndef MOD1_HPP
#define MOD1_HPP

#include <boost/python.hpp>

int square(int x);

#endif
 mod1.cpp #include "mod1.hpp"

    std::cout << y << std::endl;
}

BOOST_PYTHON_MODULE (mod2)

    def("myfunc",&myfunc);

 As you can see, mod2 is using a function defined in mod1. Compiled without the boost::python wrapper and with a main function, it works perfectly fine. Now the compile script setup.py #!/usr/bin/python2

from setuptools import setup, Extension

mod1 = Extension('mod1',
                 sources = ['mod1.cpp'],
                 libraries = ['boost_python'])

mod2 = Extension('mod2',

setup(name='foo',
      version='0.0',
      description='',
      ext_modules=[mod1,mod2],

 it compiles fine. Then I move to build/lib.linux-i686-2.7 and launch python2 >>> import mod1
>>> import mod2
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>

 Obviously there's a problem with mod2 not finding mod1. How can I fix that ? How can I define several C modules in a python project and allow them to use each others ?

</div>
 I would like that to formatted properly with indentation, and perhaps even have the tags in a different colour scheme. I'm fully aware that I could write the styling for this myself, but surely someone has already written and made available a stylesheet, a LESS mixin, or perhaps a jQuery plugin which recognises and formats for me? UPDATE: Just to make people aware, I realise that I have to HTML-encode the tags (&lt; and &gt;). But that doesn't help with the formatting/presentation, and it's the formatting/presentation that I'm looking for help with.

@CONTENT:RE-EDIT I am trying to add a drawable in code only by combining two pieces of code. I would like some advice as to how to attain this as I came across the code on Github and I'm just trying to tweak it a little. The xml portion is: <org.test.TestProj.RadioButtonCenter

        super(context, attrs);
        TypedArray a = context.obtainStyledAttributes(attrs, R.styleable.CompoundButton, 0, 0);
        buttonDrawable = a.getDrawable(1);
        setButtonDrawable(android.R.id.empty);
    }
    Drawable buttonDrawable;

@TITLE:JSF2 + IceFaces 2 - Retrieve UIComponent from ViewRoot
@CONTENT:I've got hard time resolving the following. My problem is quite simple : I would like to highlight in red the forms fields that triggered validation errors. The error messages are placed correctly in the FacesContext using a context.addMessage(...) line. I'd like my system to be generic. All form fields having a message attached are automatically highlighted. I've found on this site a link to this excellent article : http://www.jroller.com/mert/entry/how_to_find_a_uicomponent With it, I did implement a PhaseListener for the RENDER_RESPONSE phase, which do the following : @Override
  public void beforePhase(PhaseEvent event) {
    // get context
    FacesContext context = event.getFacesContext();

    // iterate on all the clientIds which have messages
    Iterator<String> clientIdsWithMessages = context.getClientIdsWithMessages();
    while (clientIdsWithMessages.hasNext()) {

      // get the clientId for the field component
      String clientIdWithMessage = clientIdsWithMessages.next();
      // split on ":"
      String[] splitted = clientIdWithMessage.split(":");

      UIComponent component = findComponentInRoot(splitted[splitted.length - 1]);
      if (component != null) {
        Map<String, Object> attributes = component.getAttributes();

        if (attributes.containsKey("style")) {
          attributes.remove("style");
        }
        attributes.put("style", "background-color: #FFE1E1;");
      }
    }
  }
 This perform perfectly well for almost all my usage. Now, where it becomes a bit tricky, is that some of my forms have such code : <ice:dataTable id="revisionDocuments" value="#{agendaBean.agenda.revisionsDocuments}" var="revision">
    <ice:column>
        <ice:inputText value="#{revision.sequenceAdresse}" id="revisionSequenceAdresse" />
    </ice:column>
    ....
 The generated form has several lines (one for each object of the revisionsDocuments list), and each element has a unique identifier (clientId) which looks like : contentForm:revisionDocuments:0:revisionSequenceAdresse
 With 0 changed for 1, 2, ... for each iteration. Consequently, the code provided to search the UIComponent from ViewRoot does not work properly. All forms fields have the same "id". What surprise me more is : they have the same "clientId" in FacesContext too : contentForm:revisionDocuments:revisionSequenceAdresse
 I cannot distinguish, while going through the tree, if I do see the right form field or any of the others. Does anyone have a hint to solve this ? Or another suggestion to implement the highlight of my fields ? I have to admit, I dont really like my code, I consider dirty to manipulate the viewRoot like I'm doing, but I could not figure out a better solution to have a generic highlight of my fields. I'm running IceFaces 2.0.2 with JSF-Impl 2.1.1-b04 on JBOss AS 7.0.2.Final. Thank you in advance for the answers. Best regards, Patrick

@TITLE:DB architecture for retrieving items stored in child categories from parent categories
@CONTENT:Failing to find a solution to this question I was wondering if there was a better way of storing data for this problem. That db structure allows items to be stored in multiple categories, but doesn't allow easy access to the parent category hierarchy. What I would like is to have a category relationship such as: Books 
  > Novels
    > Paperbacks
    > Hardbacks
 And have an item stored against Paperbacks for instance that would also show up in Novels and Books. So the 'categories' actually work more like filters than actual categories.
@CODE:Books 
  > Novels
    > Paperbacks
    > Hardbacks

@TITLE:Drawing an dynamic arrow pointing to a particular location on earth
@CONTENT:I have implemented a program that is able to get the distance and direction of other person. Now I want to show this information by a dynamic arrow pointing to the other person direction (like a needle) and as the user moves his phone, the arrow will change its direction to still point the other person direction. So, it is to be implemented like this: an activity will pass the direction (of the other person) in degrees (0<= x <=360) to another activity whose task is to graphically show the arrow. I know how to know the azimuth value and thereby calculate the degree of rotation of arrow for a particular direction value (x). I know the logic of implementation but I have no knowledge about graphic, animation etc. Any quick Help is highly appreciated.

@TITLE:filter array by key
@CONTENT:I have this little function to filter my array by keys:  private function filterMyArray( )

      function check( $v )
      {
           return $v['type'] == 'video';
      }
      return array_filter( $array, 'check' );
 }
 This works great but since I have more keys to filter, I was thinking in a way to pass a variable from the main function: filterMyArray($key_to_serch) without success, also I've tried a global variable, but seems not work. Due some confusion in my question :), I need something like this:  private function filterMyArray( $key_to_serch )
 {
      function check( $v )
      {
           return $v['type'] == $key_to_serch;
      }
      return array_filter( $array, 'check' );
 }
 Any idea to pass that variable?
@CODE:private function filterMyArray( )
 {
      function check( $v )
      {
           return $v['type'] == 'video';

      return array_filter( $array, 'check' );
 } filterMyArray($key_to_serch) private function filterMyArray( $key_to_serch )

 } The problem that I am having is that when I call InternetGetCookeEx I always return false and get an error code of 259, which means no more data available. When you consult the API essentially what that means is that it couldn't find my cookie. Because I am using IE 9 the names for files that the cookie is being stored in are obviously mangled , which is why I am trying to read my cookie data that way. I have removed the company name to protect the company. Essentially what I am trying to do is. Find the lUsrCtxPersist cookie value. Therefore I am calling the code as such CookieReader.ext http://[CompanyDomain].com lUsrCtxPersist. However I always get a false and an error code of 259. Any light you might be able to shed on this would be greatly appreciated.

@TITLE:How do I create a functional test which includes a POST to a page with parameters?
@CONTENT:I've read the documentation from Symfony2 but it doesn't seem to work. Here's my functional test: public function testSearch()
{
    $client = static::createClient();
    $crawler = $client->request('POST', '/search/results', array('term' => 'Carteron'));
    $this->assertTrue($crawler->filter('html:contains("Carteron")')->count() > 0);
    $this->assertTrue($crawler->filter('html:contains("Auctions")')->count() > 0);
}
 In my controller the "term" parameter is null when this request comes in. However, search works just fine when I perform it on the site, so I know its a problem with setting up the test.
@CODE:public function testSearch()

@LINK:/questions/8439173/is-it-possible-to-call-activeresourcebaseload
@TITLE:Is it possible to call ActiveResource::Base#load?
@CONTENT:The ActiveResource::Base#update_attributes method calls a ActiveResource::Base#load method which is defined in activeresource-3.1.3/lib/active_resource/base.rb (line 1255). I am trying to call that load method, rather than simply using update_attributes so that the object is not saved immediately. I tested this with a completely new rails application. I scaffolded a simple object: rails scaffold obj property1:string
 Then in the rails console: irb(main):001:0> obj=Obj.new
irb(main):002:0> obj.load(:property1=>"data")
TypeError: can't convert Hash into String
from .../activesupport-3.1.3/lib/active_support/dependencies.rb:234:in `load'
from .../activesupport-3.1.3/lib/active_support/dependencies.rb:234:in `load'

from .../activesupport-3.1.3/lib/active_support/dependencies.rb:234:in `load'
from (irb):2
 I see that activesupport-3.1.3/lib/active_support/dependencies.rb applies its Loadable module to Object, giving every object a load method for loading files, but I can't figure out why it overrides the ActiveResource::Base#load method and not the other way around. I am using Rails 3.1.3 and friends. Update: I think I've answered my own question. I've been trying to use ActiveResource methods on ActiveRecord objects. I know that my Rails model classes are descendants of ActiveRecord::Base, but somehow when I was trying to find the code for ActiveRecord::Base#update_attributes I found the code for ActiveResource::Base#update_attributes instead, which looks like this: def update_attributes(attributes)
  load(attributes, false) && save
end
 So I've been trying to call the load method, which exists for my objects only as provided by activesupport. If I had only looked at ActiveRecord::Base#update_attributes which is def update_attributes(attributes, options = {})
  # The following transaction covers any possible database side-effects of the
  # attributes assignment. For example, setting the IDs of a child collection.
  with_transaction_returning_status do
    self.assign_attributes(attributes, options)
    save
  end
end
 I would have seen that the assign_attributes method is what I needed.

@TITLE:PHP loads module, but Apache Start Says No - LDAP
@CONTENT:I have the following downloaded on my machine apache2.2.21 zip from apachelounge php 5.3.8 thread safe zip from php.net Windows 7 I've unzipped them both to some path on my computer. Let's say its called $HOME. So I have $HOME/apach2 and $HOME/php. I've successfully gotten the phpinfo() page to display and even installed the xdebug extension for debugging purposes in netbeans. My problem is the following : I uncommented 'extension=php_ldap.dll' in the php.ini because I need ldap connectivity. I'll start apache and the monitor says that apache is running. I then navigate to my index.php but an error occurs saying that ldap_connect doesn't exist. When I type if 'php --rf ldap_connect' into the command line, I get the function prototype no problem. I even have a php script written that will use the ldap extension to do ldap search. 

$conn = ldap_connect( 'ldap://myhostsomewhere', 389 );

ldap_set_option( $conn, LDAP_OPT_PROTOCOL_VERSION, 3 );

ldap_bind( $conn, 'cn=admin,dc=emc,dc=com', 'secret' );


$rs = ldap_search( $conn, 'cn=jerry,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com', '(cn=jerry)');


$stuff = ldap_get_entries( $conn, $rs );


var_dump( $stuff );

 The code above will return an array with all the results and I get NO errors. When I check the Apache error log however, I get the following error, PHP Warning: PHP Startup: Unable to load dynamic library 'C:/Users/jerry/Documents/myprogs/php/ext/php_ldap.dll' - The specified module could not be found.\r\n in Unknown on line 0. I've double checked and triple checked and the directory is there and all but it isn't loading when apache tries to run php. BUT it loads fine when I run PHP through the command line. I've looked at the phpinfo() and apache is loading the correct php.ini file as well. I have NO clue what is going one. The weird part is that usually a php error like that might cause apache to stop and cause some sort of fault. It's a PHP Warning though, and apache starts up just fine but it complains when I try to call ldap_connect. Anyone have any suggestions?
@CODE:$conn = ldap_connect( 'ldap://myhostsomewhere', 389 );

The thing is that the document gets ready right in the middle of a script that needs to be executed.

@TITLE:What is wrong with extending AlertDialog also Why no automatic IME in EditText in the dialog
@CONTENT:I've got this dialog (I'm simplifying my use case): class EditShoppingListDialog extends AlertDialog {

    public EditShoppingListDialog(Context context) {
        super(context/*, R.style.AppCustomDialog*/);
    }

    @Override

        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.dialog_addshoppinglist);
        setTitle("Mike Testing");
    }
}
 I create and use this subclassed AlertDialog outside of the OnCreateDialog method (in the onContextItemSelected of my Activity) like this: AlertDialog dialog = new EditShoppingListDialog(this);
dialog.show();
 Now, I've been working with this code base for over a month now and never saw any problems, which lead me to wonder why they recommend using AlertDialog.Builder for creating custom dialogs also. When I deployed my app to a real device, I immediately started to see problems. The most blocking of them is that I cannot get the soft keyboard (IME?) to show up even when I click on an EditText field in the AlertDialog. Here's the best part; If I say: class EditShoppingListDialog extends Dialog {
    ...
}
 The IME appears appears automatically if I click in an EditText in the dialog. I found this thread but the accepted solution does not work with AlertDialog. However, I found doing this on the OnCreate of my derived AlertDialog helps show the IME, but it goes behind the dialog and I can't interact with it: InputMethodManager imm = (InputMethodManager) getContext().getSystemService(Context.INPUT_METHOD_SERVICE);
imm.toggleSoftInput(InputMethodManager.SHOW_IMPLICIT,0);
 I'm really sorry for the lost post, but I've spent more than 5 hours on this and would be very grateful for some help. The reason I insist on extending an AlertDialog is because I need a dialog without a title bar and it says in the Android Dialog documentation that I cannot have a Dialog without a title bar.
@CODE:class EditShoppingListDialog extends AlertDialog {

    public EditShoppingListDialog(Context context) {
        super(context/*, R.style.AppCustomDialog*/);
    }

@TITLE:WCF/Entity Framework with External SQL Server DB Does Not Work when Deployed to IIS
@CONTENT:I have a simple WCF project that uses the Entity Framework to access the AdventureWorks database. Its actually out of a book Windows Communication Foundation 4: Step by Step. The catch is that the SQL Server database is not a local SQL Server Express instance but a full SQL Server 2008 R2 instance on an external machine called win01s305. I created a Data Model from the external Database by Generate from Database. The data access works fully with the built-in ASP.NET Web Server (Cassini?) until I publish the WCF service to IIS. Then the credentials/account are different on the remote SQL server machine and the data access stops working. The book specifies a script if you have trouble: USE [AdventureWorks]
GO
CREATE USER [IIS APPPOOL\DefaultAppPool] FOR LOGIN [IIS APPPOOL\DefaultAppPool]
GO
EXEC sp_addrolemember N'db_owner', [IIS APPPOOL\DefaultAppPool]

 The issue is these accounts do NOT exist on the remote SQL Server machine. The machine does not have IIS or the .NET Framework on it, just SQL Server. How can I do this?

 Give the above class Bond which includes three member variables, without using getter and setter, how does client get the price, name, or volume of an bond object? This is the another example of getter/setter in Qt4. Here's the improved QProgressBar API: class QProgressBar : public QWidget

@TITLE:Opening URL on Android web browser causes Google search
@CONTENT:I'm having a slight problem opening a certain URL in the browser. First of all I use the following code to launch the browser: Intent browserIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, Uri.parse(Globals.currentChatURL)); 
startActivity(Intent.createChooser(browserIntent, "Select browser:"));
 Now if I set Globals.currentChatURL to something like http://www.google.com then it opens that site just fine. But my URL is a little more complicated as it contains multiple parameters which are all base64 encoded. Here is an example of how my URL looks: http://webportal.mysite.com/ChatProgram/chat.php? intgroup=UFYyMA==&intid=UFYyMEZN&hg=Pw__&pref=user&en=U0NPVFQgTUlMTEFS&ee=cGF1bGdAbWFnbmF0ZWNoLmNvbQ==&eq=UFRWRkVI&ec=TUFHTkFURUNI Now if I use my above code to try and launch this URL it brings me to the Google search page with the following message: "Your search - http://URLabove ... did not match any documents" Yet if I copy the URL and paste it into the address box it brings me to the right place. How can I fix this?? The whole point of this is to have the user click the button and the site to launch, not for the user to have to copy and paste the URL manually. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks a lot

    std::cout << y << std::endl;
}

BOOST_PYTHON_MODULE (mod2)
{
    def("myfunc",&myfunc);
}
 As you can see, mod2 is using a function defined in mod1. Compiled without the boost::python wrapper and with a main function, it works perfectly fine. Now the compile script setup.py #!/usr/bin/python2

from setuptools import setup, Extension

mod1 = Extension('mod1',
                 sources = ['mod1.cpp'],
                 libraries = ['boost_python'])

mod2 = Extension('mod2',

setup(name='foo',
      version='0.0',
      description='',
      ext_modules=[mod1,mod2],
      install_requires=['distribute'])
 it compiles fine. Then I move to build/lib.linux-i686-2.7 and launch python2 >>> import mod1
>>> import mod2
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: ./mod2.so: undefined symbol: _Z6squarei

 Obviously there's a problem with mod2 not finding mod1. How can I fix that ? How can I define several C modules in a python project and allow them to use each others ?

@CONTENT:Is there a way to write HTML onto a webpage, but have it rendered as text? Let me explain: I want to build a webpage with a discussion on HTML. Therefore there will be sections like <div>

        <span>Hello world</span>
    </p>
</div>
 I would like that to formatted properly with indentation, and perhaps even have the tags in a different colour scheme. I'm fully aware that I could write the styling for this myself, but surely someone has already written and made available a stylesheet, a LESS mixin, or perhaps a jQuery plugin which recognises and formats for me? UPDATE: Just to make people aware, I realise that I have to HTML-encode the tags (&lt; and &gt;). But that doesn't help with the formatting/presentation, and it's the formatting/presentation that I'm looking for help with.

        super(context, attrs);
        TypedArray a = context.obtainStyledAttributes(attrs, R.styleable.CompoundButton, 0, 0);

        setButtonDrawable(android.R.id.empty);
    }
    Drawable buttonDrawable;


     @Override

            super.onDraw(canvas);

            if (buttonDrawable != null) {

                    case Gravity.BOTTOM:
                        y = getHeight() - height;

                        break;

@LINK:/questions/8443093/jsf2-icefaces-2-retrieve-uicomponent-from-viewroot
@TITLE:JSF2 + IceFaces 2 - Retrieve UIComponent from ViewRoot
@CONTENT:I've got hard time resolving the following. My problem is quite simple : I would like to highlight in red the forms fields that triggered validation errors. The error messages are placed correctly in the FacesContext using a context.addMessage(...) line. I'd like my system to be generic. All form fields having a message attached are automatically highlighted. I've found on this site a link to this excellent article : http://www.jroller.com/mert/entry/how_to_find_a_uicomponent With it, I did implement a PhaseListener for the RENDER_RESPONSE phase, which do the following : @Override
  public void beforePhase(PhaseEvent event) {
    // get context
    FacesContext context = event.getFacesContext();

    // iterate on all the clientIds which have messages
    Iterator<String> clientIdsWithMessages = context.getClientIdsWithMessages();
    while (clientIdsWithMessages.hasNext()) {

      // get the clientId for the field component
      String clientIdWithMessage = clientIdsWithMessages.next();
      // split on ":"
      String[] splitted = clientIdWithMessage.split(":");

      UIComponent component = findComponentInRoot(splitted[splitted.length - 1]);
      if (component != null) {
        Map<String, Object> attributes = component.getAttributes();

        if (attributes.containsKey("style")) {
          attributes.remove("style");
        }
        attributes.put("style", "background-color: #FFE1E1;");
      }
    }
  }
 This perform perfectly well for almost all my usage. Now, where it becomes a bit tricky, is that some of my forms have such code : <ice:dataTable id="revisionDocuments" value="#{agendaBean.agenda.revisionsDocuments}" var="revision">
    <ice:column>
        <ice:inputText value="#{revision.sequenceAdresse}" id="revisionSequenceAdresse" />
    </ice:column>
    ....
 The generated form has several lines (one for each object of the revisionsDocuments list), and each element has a unique identifier (clientId) which looks like : contentForm:revisionDocuments:0:revisionSequenceAdresse
 With 0 changed for 1, 2, ... for each iteration. Consequently, the code provided to search the UIComponent from ViewRoot does not work properly. All forms fields have the same "id". What surprise me more is : they have the same "clientId" in FacesContext too : contentForm:revisionDocuments:revisionSequenceAdresse
 I cannot distinguish, while going through the tree, if I do see the right form field or any of the others. Does anyone have a hint to solve this ? Or another suggestion to implement the highlight of my fields ? I have to admit, I dont really like my code, I consider dirty to manipulate the viewRoot like I'm doing, but I could not figure out a better solution to have a generic highlight of my fields. I'm running IceFaces 2.0.2 with JSF-Impl 2.1.1-b04 on JBOss AS 7.0.2.Final. Thank you in advance for the answers. Best regards, Patrick

@CONTENT:I've diligently followed the instructions at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.devices.camerabuttons.shutterkeyhalfpressed(v=vs.92).aspx to try and hook the camera events in my WP7.1 Silverlight app. In my main form I have:    protected override void OnNavigatedTo(System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationEventArgs e)
    {
        CameraButtons.ShutterKeyPressed += new EventHandler(CameraButtons_ShutterKeyPressed);
    }
 And then...    void CameraButtons_ShutterKeyPressed(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        // stuff
    }
 However, this event never fires. When I press the camera button, the phone just jumps to camera mode. Am I missing something? I got the sense from the above article that I might need to add the following to my WPAppManifest.xml, because the project was converted from WP7.0:   <Capability Name="ID_CAP_ISV_CAMERA" />
 ... but I did that, and nothing much changed. Any ideas?
@CODE:protected override void OnNavigatedTo(System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationEventArgs e)
    {
        CameraButtons.ShutterKeyPressed += new EventHandler(CameraButtons_ShutterKeyPressed);

@CONTENT:Failing to find a solution to this question I was wondering if there was a better way of storing data for this problem. That db structure allows items to be stored in multiple categories, but doesn't allow easy access to the parent category hierarchy. What I would like is to have a category relationship such as: Books 
  > Novels
    > Paperbacks
    > Hardbacks
 And have an item stored against Paperbacks for instance that would also show up in Novels and Books. So the 'categories' actually work more like filters than actual categories.
@CODE:Books 
  > Novels
    > Paperbacks

@CONTENT:I have implemented a program that is able to get the distance and direction of other person. Now I want to show this information by a dynamic arrow pointing to the other person direction (like a needle) and as the user moves his phone, the arrow will change its direction to still point the other person direction. So, it is to be implemented like this: an activity will pass the direction (of the other person) in degrees (0<= x <=360) to another activity whose task is to graphically show the arrow. I know how to know the azimuth value and thereby calculate the degree of rotation of arrow for a particular direction value (x). I know the logic of implementation but I have no knowledge about graphic, animation etc. Any quick Help is highly appreciated.

@LINK:/questions/8440073/filter-array-by-key
@TITLE:filter array by key
@CONTENT:I have this little function to filter my array by keys:  private function filterMyArray( )
 {
      function check( $v )
      {
           return $v['type'] == 'video';
      }
      return array_filter( $array, 'check' );
 }
 This works great but since I have more keys to filter, I was thinking in a way to pass a variable from the main function: filterMyArray($key_to_serch) without success, also I've tried a global variable, but seems not work. Due some confusion in my question :), I need something like this:  private function filterMyArray( $key_to_serch )
 {
      function check( $v )
      {
           return $v['type'] == $key_to_serch;
      }
      return array_filter( $array, 'check' );
 }
 Any idea to pass that variable?
@CODE:private function filterMyArray( )
 {
      function check( $v )
      {
           return $v['type'] == 'video';
      }
      return array_filter( $array, 'check' );
 } filterMyArray($key_to_serch) private function filterMyArray( $key_to_serch )
 {
      function check( $v )
      {
           return $v['type'] == $key_to_serch;
      }
      return array_filter( $array, 'check' );
 }

@TITLE:Reading Cookies (Client Side) With C++
@CONTENT:I am having a really hard time with some API calls to the Wininet dll. I am trying to read cookies client side set by IE 9. Here's the code.      #include "stdafx.h"
     #include <Windows.h>
    #include <WinInet.h>
    #include <iostream>
    int _tmain(int argc, _TCHAR* argv[])

LPTSTR lpData = NULL;
DWORD dwSz = 500; 
std::cout << "Hello Chris" << std::endl;
lpData = new TCHAR[dwSz];

std::wcout << "Arg 0: " << argv[1] << std::endl;


bool val = InternetGetCookieEx(argv[1], argv[2], lpData, &dwSz,  INTERNET_COOKIE_THIRD_PARTY | INTERNET_FLAG_RESTRICTED_ZONE, NULL);

    if (!val)
    {

        if (GetLastError() == ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_BUFFER)
        {
            std::cout << "Insufficent Buffer size" << std::endl;

 } The problem that I am having is that when I call InternetGetCookeEx I always return false and get an error code of 259, which means no more data available. When you consult the API essentially what that means is that it couldn't find my cookie. Because I am using IE 9 the names for files that the cookie is being stored in are obviously mangled , which is why I am trying to read my cookie data that way. I have removed the company name to protect the company. Essentially what I am trying to do is. Find the lUsrCtxPersist cookie value. Therefore I am calling the code as such CookieReader.ext http://[CompanyDomain].com lUsrCtxPersist. However I always get a false and an error code of 259. Any light you might be able to shed on this would be greatly appreciated.

@TITLE:How do I create a functional test which includes a POST to a page with parameters?
@CONTENT:I've read the documentation from Symfony2 but it doesn't seem to work. Here's my functional test: public function testSearch()
{
    $client = static::createClient();
    $crawler = $client->request('POST', '/search/results', array('term' => 'Carteron'));
    $this->assertTrue($crawler->filter('html:contains("Carteron")')->count() > 0);
    $this->assertTrue($crawler->filter('html:contains("Auctions")')->count() > 0);
}
 In my controller the "term" parameter is null when this request comes in. However, search works just fine when I perform it on the site, so I know its a problem with setting up the test.
@CODE:public function testSearch()
{
    $client = static::createClient();
    $crawler = $client->request('POST', '/search/results', array('term' => 'Carteron'));
    $this->assertTrue($crawler->filter('html:contains("Carteron")')->count() > 0);
    $this->assertTrue($crawler->filter('html:contains("Auctions")')->count() > 0);
} public function searchResultsAction() { $request = Request::createFromGlobals(); $term=$request->request->get('term'); $logger = $this->get("logger"); $logger->debug("Search term $term"); if(strlen($term)==0) { $this->get('session')->setFlash('notice', "A search string must be longer than nothing!! :P"); return $this->redirect($this->generateUrl('_welcome')); } //search code here (removed due to post length restrictions) }

@LINK:/questions/8439173/is-it-possible-to-call-activeresourcebaseload
@TITLE:Is it possible to call ActiveResource::Base#load?
@CONTENT:The ActiveResource::Base#update_attributes method calls a ActiveResource::Base#load method which is defined in activeresource-3.1.3/lib/active_resource/base.rb (line 1255). I am trying to call that load method, rather than simply using update_attributes so that the object is not saved immediately. I tested this with a completely new rails application. I scaffolded a simple object: rails scaffold obj property1:string
 Then in the rails console: irb(main):001:0> obj=Obj.new
irb(main):002:0> obj.load(:property1=>"data")
TypeError: can't convert Hash into String
from .../activesupport-3.1.3/lib/active_support/dependencies.rb:234:in `load'
from .../activesupport-3.1.3/lib/active_support/dependencies.rb:234:in `load'
from .../activesupport-3.1.3/lib/active_support/dependencies.rb:223:in `load_dependency'

from .../activesupport-3.1.3/lib/active_support/dependencies.rb:234:in `load'
from (irb):2
 I see that activesupport-3.1.3/lib/active_support/dependencies.rb applies its Loadable module to Object, giving every object a load method for loading files, but I can't figure out why it overrides the ActiveResource::Base#load method and not the other way around. I am using Rails 3.1.3 and friends. Update: I think I've answered my own question. I've been trying to use ActiveResource methods on ActiveRecord objects. I know that my Rails model classes are descendants of ActiveRecord::Base, but somehow when I was trying to find the code for ActiveRecord::Base#update_attributes I found the code for ActiveResource::Base#update_attributes instead, which looks like this: def update_attributes(attributes)
  load(attributes, false) && save
end
 So I've been trying to call the load method, which exists for my objects only as provided by activesupport. If I had only looked at ActiveRecord::Base#update_attributes which is def update_attributes(attributes, options = {})
  # The following transaction covers any possible database side-effects of the
  # attributes assignment. For example, setting the IDs of a child collection.
  with_transaction_returning_status do
    self.assign_attributes(attributes, options)
    save
  end
end
 I would have seen that the assign_attributes method is what I needed.

@TITLE:PHP loads module, but Apache Start Says No - LDAP
@CONTENT:I have the following downloaded on my machine apache2.2.21 zip from apachelounge php 5.3.8 thread safe zip from php.net Windows 7 I've unzipped them both to some path on my computer. Let's say its called $HOME. So I have $HOME/apach2 and $HOME/php. I've successfully gotten the phpinfo() page to display and even installed the xdebug extension for debugging purposes in netbeans. My problem is the following : I uncommented 'extension=php_ldap.dll' in the php.ini because I need ldap connectivity. I'll start apache and the monitor says that apache is running. I then navigate to my index.php but an error occurs saying that ldap_connect doesn't exist. When I type if 'php --rf ldap_connect' into the command line, I get the function prototype no problem. I even have a php script written that will use the ldap extension to do ldap search. 

$conn = ldap_connect( 'ldap://myhostsomewhere', 389 );

ldap_set_option( $conn, LDAP_OPT_PROTOCOL_VERSION, 3 );

ldap_bind( $conn, 'cn=admin,dc=emc,dc=com', 'secret' );


$rs = ldap_search( $conn, 'cn=jerry,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com', '(cn=jerry)');


$stuff = ldap_get_entries( $conn, $rs );


var_dump( $stuff );

 The code above will return an array with all the results and I get NO errors. When I check the Apache error log however, I get the following error, PHP Warning: PHP Startup: Unable to load dynamic library 'C:/Users/jerry/Documents/myprogs/php/ext/php_ldap.dll' - The specified module could not be found.\r\n in Unknown on line 0. I've double checked and triple checked and the directory is there and all but it isn't loading when apache tries to run php. BUT it loads fine when I run PHP through the command line. I've looked at the phpinfo() and apache is loading the correct php.ini file as well. I have NO clue what is going one. The weird part is that usually a php error like that might cause apache to stop and cause some sort of fault. It's a PHP Warning though, and apache starts up just fine but it complains when I try to call ldap_connect. Anyone have any suggestions?

@CONTENT:I have an MVC 3 app that I'm trying to unit test. I read the example from this page that shows how to mock the controller. Here is my test code:  [TestMethod]

            nv.Add("IsDefault", "selected");
            return nv;
        });

        var result = controller.CreateStudy(request.Object.Form as FormCollection) as ActionResult;

        var server = new Mock<HttpServerUtilityBase>();

        httpContext.Setup(ctx => ctx.Request).Returns(request.Object);
        httpContext.SetupGet(ctx => ctx.Request.RequestType).Returns("POST");
        httpContext.Setup(ctx => ctx.Response).Returns(response.Object);

@CONTENT:As stated above, when symlinking to a php file outside of the httpdocs directory Apache/php serves an empty file. However if I change the extension to html the file is served properly as an html document. This leads me to believe that it is not a permissions error but could be something related to the php configuration (could open_basedir be causing this?) or Apache. Does anyone know what could be causing this behavior? EDIT: For anyone wondering about this, the problem was cause by the php open_basedir restriction.

@TITLE:addEventListener Code Snippet Translation and Usage for cross-browser detectioin
@CONTENT:I've come across a piece of code that I'd like to model. However, I just have a few questions and perhaps you guys can help. Here's the code: function addEvent( brw_obj, type, func ) {

if (brw_obj.addEventListener) { // all browsers except IE < v9
 brw_obj.addEventListener( type, func, false );

} else if (brw_obj.attachEvent) { // IE only for v < v9
 brw_obj["e"+type+func] = func;
 brw_obj[type+func] = function() { 
     brw_obj["e"+type+func]( window.event ); 
    }
 brw_obj.attachEvent( "on"+type, brw_obj[type+func] );
}

/* else if (brw_obj.captureEvents) {
  brw_obj.captureEvents(Event.CLICK); // only works with FF < v3!
}
*/

}
 Now, I understand somewhat that the code is checking for addEventListener or attachEvent; but what do the following lines mean in detail? I've haven't seen javascript written like this: brw_obj["e"+type+func] = func;
brw_obj[type+func] = function() { 
brw_obj["e"+type+func]( window.event ); 
 }
brw_obj.attachEvent( "on"+type, brw_obj[type+func] );
 Also, is using this code a good way of doing browser or object detection? I'm writing a script and need to be sure it runs on all modern browsers as well as old ones. From what I understand, most modern browsers support addEventListener and IE supports attachEvent. What I'm not sure is if older browsers support either. As far as the commented-out lines: /* else if (brw_obj.captureEvents) {
 brw_obj.captureEvents(Event.CLICK); // only works with FF 
}
*/
 I read somewhere that captureEvents is only supported by older Firefox browsers. In the context of the entire code, are these lines needed? Any and all insightful comments, critiques, and advice is welcome. Thanks! :)
@CODE:function addEvent( brw_obj, type, func ) {

    }

}

brw_obj["e"+type+func]( window.event ); 
 }

@TITLE:Java (Stack&Heap) - what happens memory wise in this simple example
@CONTENT:Anyone could explain what happens memory wise (Stack & Heap) in this example? If I understand it correctly, java stores objects on the heap, so i1 will be on the heap... same with string? But what about i2, considering it is a class field declaration. public ExampleClass {
   Integer i1=new Integer(1);
   int i2 = 2;
   String str = "abc";
}
@CODE:public ExampleClass {
   Integer i1=new Integer(1);
   int i2 = 2;
   String str = "abc";

@TITLE:need help Debugging SSL handshake in tomcat
@CONTENT:I have a very weird issue and looking for some tips. I have a certificate sent by client that I need to install so I can access HTTPS webservice. The certifcate has been installed, in both windows and Linux OS. using keytool command keytool -import -alias ca -file somecert.cer -keystore cacerts Vstorepass changeit
 when i deploy my application in windows tomcat I can communicate with HTTPS web server. However Linux tomcat gives me and error: Caused by: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target at sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilder.engineBuild(SunCertPathBuilder.java:236) at java.security.cert.CertPathBuilder.build(CertPathBuilder.java:194) at sun.security.validator.PKIXValidator.doBuild(PKIXValidator.java:216) This means it couldn't find the certifcate. The certifcate is at java security cacerts. I have used keytool -list command and it is there. I have no idea why it works in windows and not linux. I have tried setting the paramaters in the My servlet System.setProperty("javax.net.debug", "all"); 
System.setProperty("javax.net.ssl.trustStore", "/usr/java/jdk1.5.0_14/jre/lib/security/cacerts"); 
System.setProperty("javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword", "changeit"); 
 It still doesn't work. My questions are: 1.Anyone has any idea why this isn't working, I have tired everything? 2.How do you enbale SSL debuging for tomcat.Ss setting System.setProperty("javax.net.debug", "all") works ? For some reason I don't see any SSL debug Info in Catalina.out. Do I need to change anything else.What kind of debug info should i see. Any help is greatly appericated I am out of ideas.

@TITLE:Concurrency with shell_exec() in PHP
@CONTENT:I have a web application which runs FontForge shell commands using shell_exec() in PHP. I'm worried about potential concurrency issues. Is there a way to make shell_exec() open a unique instance for each user? One of the commands allows users to convert fonts from one file format to another: $command = "fontforge -c 'Open($1); Generate($2)' ".$format1." ".$format2;
shell_exec($command);
 I'm worried that if USER A opens FONT A and USER B immediately opens FONT B (before the Generate() command for USER A is called), then USER A would mistakenly receive FONT B, since FONT B is currently the 'open' font.
@CODE:shell_exec() shell_exec() $command = "fontforge -c 'Open($1); Generate($2)' ".$format1." ".$format2;
shell_exec($command);

@TITLE:Converting svg to pdf with Batik not working on Ubuntu 11.10
@CONTENT:I am attempting to convert a svg image to pdf using the Batik SVG toolkit on Ubuntu-11.10. I have Batik 1.7 and Fop 0.95 installed. When running the following in the terminal: java -jar /usr/java/share/batik-rasterizer.jar -m application/pdf /home/user/Batik_Test/colors.svg  
-scriptSecurityOff
 I get the following error: Error while converting files: ??Error: cannot access transcoder for image of type application/pdf The one thing I did notice was that the file 'pdf-transcoders.jar' was not on the machine so I added that to /usr/share/java on the off chance that was the problem but that did not make a difference. I would appreciate any help from anyone out there with experience using Batik on ubuntu. What am I missing? -J

@CONTENT:I have an app where you enter some data. The PRE-Honeycomb behavior is the following: back button seems to kill the app, all input data is lost home button seems to pause the app, all input data is still there after the next start of the app For Honeycomb the behavior for the home button seems to have changed. After pressing the home button and start the app again all input data is lost. Is that intented? The problem is that I can override the back button to save data, but reading various posts I cannot override the home button. Is that an expected behavior or a bug? How to deal with it?

@TITLE:Javascript no jquery - How do I add this function to existing javascript that is triggered by onload / onpaste?
@CONTENT:This is an add-on to my previously answered question. question 8423472 I have tried to implement a validate function to this wonderful code to no avail. Looks like I need more hand holding here. This script is a slightly modified version of the quite excellent answer I received from @Martin Jespersen. The script takes a single column list of emails and breaks it up into textareas containing single row comma delimited lists of no more than 150 addresses. Nice. Below works great but, I need to add a basic validation function. <html>
<head>
<script language=javascript type='text/javascript'>
function onpaste(e) {
var t = this;
var cnt='0';
setTimeout(function(){
var list = document.getElementById('t');
var emails= t.value.split(/\s+/), ta;
while(emails.length) {
cnt++;
ta = document.createElement('textarea');
ta.value = emails.splice(0,150).join(',').replace(/,\s*$/,'');
document.body.appendChild(ta);
}
document.getElementById('button1').value=cnt;
},1);
}
window.onload = function() {
document.getElementById('t').onpaste = onpaste;
}
</script>
</head>
<BODY>
<p><textarea id="t" rows="10" cols="50" class="textarea"></textarea><br /></p><br />
There are <input type="button" id="button1" value="0"> textareas
<pre id="p" class="pre"></pre>
</body>
</html>
 HOWEVER, the guy I made it for (actually @Martin made it) is not real meticulous about what he pastes into the textarea. So, I am trying to implement a function that will reduce invalid emails / bad input. I tried several ways including changing the onload event to a button in the page with onclick event. I thought I was learning here but, I just can't wrap my brain around what I am doing wrong. So, how can I insert this function, or just its' "validation" routine into one of the above functions? function findEmailAddresses(StrObj) {
var separateEmailsBy = '\n';
var email = "<none>"; // if no match, use this
var emailsArray = StrObj.match(/([a-zA-Z0-9._-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+\.[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+)/gi); // yeah could be better 
if (emailsArray) {
email = "";
for (var i = 0; i < emailsArray.length; i++) {
if (i != 0) email += separateEmailsBy;
email += emailsArray[i];
      }
   }
return email;
}
 Useage of findEmailAddresses function: <textarea name=t rows=10 cols=50 onBlur="this.form.email.value=findEmailAddresses(this.value);"></textarea>
 I tried calling the function individually in the functions above and even tried removing the function just inserting the code using "emails" instead of "this.value" in both cases. I even tried a two page approach. For some reason, I just can't implement this code into the working splitter. My results are either no effect or I break the thing. Basically I tried many variations of inserting. Like below:     <html>
<head>
<script language=javascript type='text/javascript'>
function onpaste(e) {
var t = this;
var cnt='0';
setTimeout(function(){
var list = document.getElementById('t');
var emails= t.value.split(/\s+/), ta;
//
findEmailAddresses(emails);
// also tried inserting code from function. ///
while(emails.length) {
cnt++;
ta = document.createElement('textarea');
ta.value = emails.splice(0,150).join(',').replace(/,\s*$/,'');
document.body.appendChild(ta);
}
document.getElementById('button1').value=cnt;
},1);
}
window.onload = function() {
// tried to trigger it here as well and even added a new split //
document.getElementById('t').onpaste = onpaste;
}
/////
 function findEmailAddresses(StrObj) {
    var separateEmailsBy = '\n';
    var email = "<none>"; // if no match, use this
    var emailsArray = StrObj.match(/([a-zA-Z0-9._-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+\.[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+)/gi); // yeah could be better 
    if (emailsArray) {
    email = "";
    for (var i = 0; i < emailsArray.length; i++) {
    if (i != 0) email += separateEmailsBy;
    email += emailsArray[i];
          }
       }
    return email;
    }

@CONTENT:I have a converter that takes the text from a TextBlock that makes up a DataGridCell and converts it to a red or black brush depending if the value is negative or positive. However the converter executes more times than there are items in the datasource of the grid. For example if I simply bind a collection that contains 1 object, the converter executes 2 times. The first time the value parameter is an empty string, the second time it actually contains the value that I would expect.

@CONTENT:I'm using CopyFileEx to copy files with that ability. Is there anything like it for moving files? Remember that not every move is fast V moving to a different drive is actually a copy. The solution I have now is to copy-and-delete-the-original if the move is to a different root directory, and to simply move (and hope it's really just a change in the pointer to the file) if it's to the same root directory. Is there a straightforward solution (like CopyFileEx)?

The reason I'm considering using an activity instead is that I'll be able to show the splash in fullscreen and then when I switch to my main activity let the notification bar be displayed again. I'll off course use the splash activity to do all possible background data. This is not a question about how to implement but rather the cons and pros of this approach, all feedback is greatly appreciated.

I add an id to a layout element in one xml file, which is not being recognized by the IDE (all other IDs are, but this one isn't). I've run into things like this before over the past couple days, and a "Project > Clean" usually fixed it. So I did so - and virtually every one of my files that references R.anything comes up with the red X - I look and see that R.java isn't being created. I searched SO and found a couple solutions about turning on or off "Build Automatically" and tried that - no luck - someone else said try setting target to 2.2 - tried that, no luck. Tried deleting it manually, tried recreating it and adding it as source - no good. Restarted eclipse, and tried everything again, without success. As I said, I must have compiled this thing 100 times tonight, and the only change I made between working fine and failing is adding an id to an element (which I've since removed).

@TITLE:How do I store a copy of each entity I add to database in Hibernate
@CONTENT:I have an entity (representing a music file) that I store in Hibernate. The user can modify attributes of the entity and at some point the changes they make can be saved back to the original file. But at any point in time before they save the changes to the file I would like to able to see differences between the entity that I originally loaded and any changes made since, I want these differences to be stored in the database not the class representing entity because the main reason Im using Hibernate is to mimimize my memory usage. My memory usage could be high otherwise as there can be 1000s of entities in the application. So it seems the simplest solution is to store the entity twice, with one being a read only copy that I just refer to compare differences, but what is the right way to do this ? EDIT:So I suggested a solution below that works for me in that when I come to saving changes I can see what has changed, but I now want to take it a step further in two ways. When I load the file next time I start the program I want to check if the file is already in the database with the same/later modification date so I use the record in the database rather than having to parse the file again so my idea was to put the contents of edited into original. But also I would like to give the user to rollback changes in which case I need to keep original. So now thinking the answer given below about adding dates and and a boolean field rto Song entity might make more sense allowing a user to rollback to any version they like, so I would still keep the SongParent and then have a @oneToMany relationship to song Alternatively Ive just found the http://www.jboss.org/envers project this may be what i need

@TITLE:NSDictionary class changing if held in external Singleton?
@CONTENT:I am watching a somewhat cruel behaviour momentarily: I have a ViewController for building a View programmatically. For this purpose I have stored the names of the UILabels that will be displayed in a NSDictionary that is held in an external class which is a singleton. Unfortunately the NSDictionary is not accessible if I want to use the values in loadView. So I made some tests: The NSDictionary and its contents are availbale in init and the class is, of course, NSCFDictionary. If I have a look at it in loadView the class sometimes is NSCFDictionary and sometimes also CALayer or NSString?! I absolutely don't know what is happening??? This is the code I use: - (id) init
{
    self = [super initWithNibName:nil bundle:nil];    
    if (self)
    {
        UITabBarItem *tbi = [self tabBarItem];
        [tbi setTitle:@"xxx"];
    }

    NSEnumerator *num = [[[ValueDispatcher dispatcher] labelDic] keyEnumerator];
    NSLog(@"Class(init): %@", [[[ValueDispatcher dispatcher] labelDic] class]);
    NSLog(@"No: %i", [[[ValueDispatcher dispatcher] labelDic] count]);
    for (id key in num)
    {
        NSLog(@"Key %@  Value  %@", key, [[[ValueDispatcher dispatcher] labelDic] valueForKey:key]);
    }

       return self;
    }  

- (void)loadView 
{
    NSLog(@"Class(loadview)1: %@", [[[ValueDispatcher dispatcher] labelDic] class]);
    NSLog(@"No: %i", [[[ValueDispatcher dispatcher] labelDic] count]);
    NSEnumerator *num = [[[ValueDispatcher dispatcher] labelDic] keyEnumerator];
    for (id key in num)
    {
        NSLog(@"Key34 %@  Value  %@", key, [[[ValueDispatcher dispatcher] labelDic] valueForKey:key]);
    }
...
 At which point between init and loadView can or will a NSDictionary be changed? Btw, another info that might be important: If I use the above code and the NSDictionary is filled by an external service everything works fine. But if I fill the NSDictionary from a stored plist during startup it fails and I watch the described behaviour...
@CODE:- (id) init
{
    self = [super initWithNibName:nil bundle:nil];    
    if (self)
    {
        UITabBarItem *tbi = [self tabBarItem];
        [tbi setTitle:@"xxx"];
    }

@TITLE:How to add data to tableview using a delegate?
@CONTENT:I'm building an app for fun with a initial view controller of a tableview, where you are able to see the details of the cells, and add new data to the tableview. First off, here is the project, so you can load it and have a look. http://dawtano.com/xc-project.zip It's a bit of a complex project and I think much of the code is obsolete, but the initial app is working, so I don't want to clean it up just yet. The app is built around storyboard and consists of: DataModel (containing the initial NSMutableArray) ViewController (main view) EditGrade (adding data to the tableview) Grade (defining the strings used) GradeDetail (showing details of the cell) EditGrade also contains a delegate which add function to the Cancel and Done button. Everything works (except the Edit button on GradeDetail) as it should, except when I try and add new data to the tableview. The project builds with no issues. This is the error message I get and I haven't been able to figure out what the issue is: 2011-12-08 12:56:54.643 ArrayTableView[30711:f803] *** Assertion failure in -

reason: 'Invalid table view update.  The application has requested an update to

 I hope some of you will be able to determine what the issue is, I'm currently staring myself blind on it. Update Thanks to @T.J. I found the mistake in the project, the problem now is implementing it correct, so addGrade works. I added this code in the field @T.J. pointed out: - (void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView commitEditingStyle:
(UITableViewCellEditingStyle)editingStyle forRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath
{
if (editingStyle == UITableViewCellEditingStyleDelete) {
// Delete the row from the data source
[self.dataModel removeGradeAtIndex:indexPath.row]; 
[tableView deleteRowsAtIndexPaths:[NSArray arrayWithObject:indexPath] withRowAnimation:UITableViewRowAnimationAutomatic];
}   
else if (editingStyle == UITableViewCellEditingStyleInsert) {
// Create a new instance of the appropriate class, insert it into the array, 
and add a new  row to the table view
[self.dataModel addGrade:(Grade*)grades];
[tableView insertRowsAtIndexPaths:[NSArray arrayWithObject:indexPath] withRowAnimation:UITableViewRowAnimationAutomatic];
}   
}
 Am I using the correct coding? I have a feeling [self.dataModel addGrade:(Grade*)grades];
 is incorrect. Since the DataModel uses: - (void)addGrade:(Grade*)grade
{
[self.grades addObject:grade];
}

@TITLE:JFreechart - vertical X-axis labels on an XYChart
@CONTENT:I have an XYLineChart, where the labels on the X axis are written horizontally. I would like to be able to write them vertically (descending). I can already do this for BarCharts: CategoryPlot plot = (CategoryPlot) chart.getPlot();
final CategoryAxis domainAxis = plot.getDomainAxis();
domainAxis.setCategoryLabelPositions(CategoryLabelPositions.DOWN_90);
 but an XYChart returns an XYPlot, rather than a CategoryPlot, and the getDomainAxis() of an XYPlot returns a ValueAxis, not a CategoryAxis. ValueAxis lets me call setVerticalTickLabels(true);
 which is almost there! But it draws them ascending, rather than descending. Any way around this? Thanks, Edit: I need the domain axis to stay at the bottom of the chart. Hadn't considered it being any other way when making the original post.

pageMargins1.Right = 0.45D;
pageMargins1.Top = 0.5D;
pageMargins1.Bottom = 0.5D;

 but no luck. Also using the code from this example: How change excel 2007 document orientation to landscape by OpenXML sdk to set the page orientation does not work if creating the document from scratch. How do you add a PageSetup & PageMargin instance to the document? Any one have knowledge of this SDK and knows how to use the margins or page setup class?

@LINK:/questions/8430108/opengl-sending-vertex-pointers-or-generating-buffers
@TITLE:OpenGL sending vertex pointers or generating buffers
@CONTENT:I just started OpenGL for iPhone, using GLKit. My programming background is almost just java and objective c with little,little experiences with C, C++ over ten years ago. All what remained is a remote memory of how I struggled with pointers - and I think I failed. Now it seems as if it all comes back to me ... I went to some iterations of the great, great tutorial series of Ian Terrel, which really helped me (Thanks!!!). This question is about the following parts of the code (which is mostly directly taken from the tutorials): @interface AAAShape : NSObject
{
  NSMutableData *vertexData;
  // ...
}
@property(readonly) int vertexCount;
@property(readonly) GLKVector2 *vertices; 
//...    
@end

@implementation AAAShape
//...


-(GLKVector2 *)vertices
{
  if(!vertexData)
  {
    vertexData = [NSMutableData dataWithLength:sizeof(GLKVector2)*self.vertexCount];
  }
  return [vertexData mutableBytes];
}

-(void)renderInScene:(AAAScene *)scene 
{
  //... Effect Stuff
  //...
  glVertexAttribPointer(GLKVertexAttribPosition, 2, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 0, self.vertices);
  //...
}
//...
@end

//Using the Shape: 
//(AATriangle is of AAAShape and implements the vertextCount with "return 3;")    
AAATriangle *triangle = [[AAATriangle alloc]init];

triangle.vertices[0] = GLKVector2Make(2., .0);
triangle.vertices[1] = GLKVector2Make(-2., .0);
triangle.vertices[2] = GLKVector2Make(.0, -3.);
//...
 All of this works really fine, but then I stumbled upon the following in Apple's OpenGl Guide: [...], but is inefficient. Each time DrawModel is called, the index and vertex data are copied to OpenGL ES, and transferred to the graphics hardware.[...] can impact performance. [...]your application should store its vertex data in a vertex buffer object (VBO). [...] The suggested code sample there, for doing that (other sources showing nearly the same) looks like this: GLuint    vertexBuffer;
void CreateVertexBuffers()
{

    glGenBuffers(1, &vertexBuffer);
    glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, vertexBuffer);
    glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(vertices), vertices, GL_STATIC_DRAW);

} 
 and later drawing with: void DrawModelUsingVertexBuffers()
{
    glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, vertexBuffer);
    glVertexAttribPointer(ATTRIB_POSITION, 2, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, sizeof(vertexStruct), (void*)offsetof(vertexStruct,position));
    glEnableVertexAttribArray(ATTRIB_POSITION);
   //...
 }
 I've a few questions about it: How significant are the mentioned performance impacts? Is it necessary to change the code? What the ... is really going on in the first code samples above (Ian's/my code)? Why is it possible to set vertices[i] if vertices is readonly and where and how memory is allocated for vertices? Where could I put the code above (the buffer-creating and -binding stuff) in Ian's/my approach and why is there no connection (in means of variables are method calls or something) between the binding and the drawing?
@CODE:@interface AAAShape : NSObject
{
  NSMutableData *vertexData;
  // ...

@property(readonly) int vertexCount;
@property(readonly) GLKVector2 *vertices;

@CONTENT:Coming form a web development background where all your files are uploaded to a server individually, the APK file is very different to me! From what I gather its kind of like a zip or exe file similar to software you install on a computer, e.g.. Eclipse its self. Then when installed on a device the files and folders are extracted back into something similar to the file/folder structure I was working on in eclipse. And in which case I then again have access somehow to say the /res and /assets folders once the APK is installed??? Am I on the right track??? Cheers, Mike.

@TITLE:C++ template class map
@CONTENT:I add the constructor and two functions to the class of my previous linked question C++ iterate through a template Map and I need help at this points: What do you reckon this constructor does? Adding one value at the beginning of map? I see though in the respective key only an address as value after initializing in main. What is wrong? The operator [] is supposed to get the values for a specific key. However I cannot use it so as to get the elements of the map in the output. Any hint? template<class K, class V>
class template_map{
public:
    template_map( V const& val) {
        m_map.insert(my_map.begin(),std::make_pair(std::numeric_limits<K>::min(),val));

    }

    ...
};

int main()
{
    interval_map<int,int> Map1 (10);
    //Show the elements of the map?

 Consider also that it should be a function that inserts values to the map.

@CONTENT:Below is the task i have to complete in a few weeks, my question is does anyone know of any tutorials or books which will be of use to me? I also only have little knowledge of C#. You will design the relevant code in ASP.NET and C# so that you can deploy a web role on Azure that can: a) read in a zip file from input on the web page b) uncompress the zip file which will have an executable, an arbitrary list of arguments and data files c) run the executable with the arguments (and hence read in the data files). d) store the output logs for access later. You will test this by running a piece of code that reads in a set of arguments which correspond to test files. The executable will then read in the text files and then print them out. You will also have to design an appropriate UML to explain how the different classes you have written interact.

@TITLE:Using Java / JNI on Cygwin
@CONTENT:I am entering into Java world just now. I am facing problem when I try to compile sample program for Calling C from Java. I wanted to try the sample code for JNI (Which is given in JNI.PDF from SUN-Micro). The code is some thing like this: class HelloWorld {
  private native void print();
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    new HelloWorld().print();
  }
  static {
    System.loadLibrary("HelloWorld");
  }
}
 I compiled using javac HelloWorld.java and after that got .H file for C program using "javah -jni HelloWorld" Even my C code is also simple with : #include <jni.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include "HelloWorld.h"
JNIEXPORT void JNICALL
Java_HelloWorld_print(JNIEnv *env, jobject obj)
{
  printf("Hello World!\n");
  return;
}
 I created .dll in Cygwin using "gcc -Wl,--add-stdcall-alias -shared -o HelloWorld.dll HelloWorld.c" Even I used normal Linux method of Creating Shared Lib: "gcc -shared -Wl,-soname,libHelloWorld.so -o libHelloWorld.so HelloWorld.o" But when I run java HelloWorld, it return Aborted! Since i dont have much idea in Java, I am not sure where I going wrong. I checked similar code present in few websites like: http://www.inonit.com/cygwin/jni/helloWorld/ but getting similar error.
@CODE:class HelloWorld {
  private native void print();
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    new HelloWorld().print();

 But VS show me red line saying that the newsrc is not exist within current context.. How can I use a variable along with Url.Content? (Note: I am using this inside script tag...)

@CONTENT:Well, I really hoped I could handle this without asking here, but I can't :( The idea is pretty simple, you have this link http://cetatenie.just.ro/ and the link is important, because it works for others. You want to perform a HTTP GET on it from GAE - locally for now, that's it! If I do it in main class, something like this : HttpClient httpClient = new DefaultHttpClient();    
HttpGet httpGet = new HttpGet("http://cetatenie.just.ro/");
HttpResponse response = httpClient.execute(httpGet);
 And then parse the response everything is fine, now I do the same (almost) thing in GAE - locally (in Eclipse --> Run As --> Web Application), with the help of the Eclipse GAE plugin. FetchOptions fetchOptions = FetchOptions.Builder.withDeadline(50000);
HTTPRequest request = new HTTPRequest(new URL("http://cetatenie.just.ro/"), HTTPMethod.GET, fetchOptions);
System.out.println("ULR-->" + request.getURL());    
URLFetchService service = URLFetchServiceFactory.getURLFetchService();
HTTPResponse response = service.fetch(request);
System.out.println("RESPONSE_CODE-->" + response.getResponseCode());
String responseAsString = new String(response.getContent());
System.out.println("RESPONSE_AS_STRING-->" + responseAsString);
 I always get a Http 500 error code. I know that this indicates on a server problem, but how come it works from my stand-alone application? Is GAE doing something fishy? Regards, Eugene.
@CODE:HttpClient httpClient = new DefaultHttpClient();

 To run the application, I should use somethink like project -x somethink.obj. But because I cannot compile the makefile I cannot run the project. Can you help me?

@TITLE:Android JNI Debug: Eclipse : Project specified in the launch configuration is not a C/C++ one
@CONTENT:I'm on Eclipse Indigo. I'm trying to Debug the JNI/C++ portion of an Android Eclipse Project. I don't want to convert my Android project over to a C++ project for obvious reasons. I don't mind adding C++ nature but the options I have tried so far change my project to a C++ project that needs a make file. So the debug proceedures is that I start a Java Android Debug session, startup the ndk-gdb debug server, and then I need to attach the C++ debugger somehow. So I created a C++ Debug Profile in addition to the Android Java Debug Config. But when I start it up I get Project specified is not C/C++. Should I create a dummy C++ project just to get the debug session working? Thanks PS: I am following the steps in this guide to debug JNI in Android: http://mhandroid.wordpress.com/2011/01/23/using-eclipse-for-android-cc-debugging/#more-23 And it does not indicate the need to create a separate C++ project.

@TITLE:Storing XML object in PHP Session Variables
@CONTENT:There are a lot of discussions on this topic but I'd like to ask this question anyways to determine the best approach for my specific situation... I'm using the linkedIn API with CakePHP. From the LinkedIn API I get an XML object. I would like to store this XML objects (the whole thing) in a session variable so I do not have to call the API on every page. My understanding is that it's not possible to store XML objects in a PHP Session. What is the usual workaround for this? I've already written a lot of code that reads/manipulates the XML objects, so I'd like to avoid turning the object into an array or something else so that I do not need to rewrite this code. Many Thanks

@TITLE:Ajax PHP Search, Query result instead of XML
@CONTENT:I'm following the tutorial from w3schools on ajax search and I'm having some trouble tweaking the code. The structure I got is: search.php - ( Where the search terms ?q=search will output a result as echo $result ) livesearch.php - ( Where it will exchange information between search.php and search.html ) search.html - ( Where it contains java script and what not ) How can I, please, make it instead of grabbing information from XML, grab from the output string in search.php? In other words, if the HTTP request is "livesearch.php?q=searchTerm", I want to output "searchTerm."

@TITLE:Show a list of all XML filenames in the res folder for an Android application
@CONTENT:I'm simply trying to get a list of all the XML files in my res/xml folder. I have tried to use the asset manager .list() function, but that doesn't seem to return anything. I have tried other methods, but none seem to work. They either fail, or return nothing. This is simply so I can show a ListView which contains the name of each file. Does anyone have any ideas of what is necessary to do this?

@LINK:/questions/8408922/android-how-to-change-attributes-in-ondraw-by-onclicklistener
@TITLE:AndroidGhow to change attributes in ondraw() by onclickListener
@CONTENT:I have a simple ondraw() function. private class MyViewCircle extends View {
        public MyViewCircle(Context context) {
            super(context);
            // TODO Auto-generated constructor stub
        }
        @Override
        protected void onDraw(Canvas canvas) {
            // TODO Auto-generated method stub
            super.onDraw(canvas);
            Paint paint = new Paint();
            paint.setAntiAlias(true);
            paint.setColor(Color.BLACK);
            canvas.drawCircle(20, 20, 50,
                    paint);
        }
    }
 It works good. But I want it more interesting. I create a onclickListener. evolve.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {         @Override
        public void onClick(View v) {
            // TODO Auto-generated method stub
            //How to change attributes?
        }
    });
 When I click the button, the attributes will be changed. For example, change to paint.setColor(Color.BLUE);
canvas.drawCircle(30, 30, 50,paint);
 My question is: How could I implement this? When I click the button, the image will be automatically re-generated. Thanks!

        public MyViewCircle(Context context) {

                    paint);
        }
    } @Override

@CONTENT:I am having trouble running the following code. Not sure if I am doing this right, but I am trying to have the main method read two files that I am passing to the method as arguments. So in the interactions pane, I am typing: run Main(customer.dat, smartphone.dat) If I try to do this, I get an error: invalid top level statement I have attached the main method below.

@TITLE:jqGrid - cells with TD elements inside
@CONTENT:I seem to have an issue where with jQuery Grid (jqGrid) if I have loaded data where one of the cells has a table inside, it throws an error when onSelectRow() is fired and I call $(grid).getRowData(rowid). jqGrid seems to be enumerating ALL of the TD elements in the selected row (including those which are children of the table within a given cell). Is there a proper way to do this or to prevent jqGrid from enumerating those elements? :( EDIT: In my particular case, the HTML was hidden until needed, so I was able to replace the TD's with "xtd" on the server until sent out to the client. On the client-side, when I needed them HTML, I just replace "xtd" to "td". Still wish there was a better way. EDIT: I want to clarify, I desire a method of doing this that doesn't modify the plugin. An well-written modification would still be nice.

@TITLE:Finding execution context information about an Eclipse plug-in
@CONTENT:I am using the Reflections library in the Eclipse plug-in I am currently developing. Apparently everything is fine when the plug-in is deployed as a bundle in Eclipse (i.e., its jar is dropped in the plugins folder of Eclipse), but when the plug-in is executed during development (Run As/Eclipse Application), I need to add to the search paths of the Reflections library the output folder (e.g., 'bin') from the project where the plug-in was executed. Then my question is if there a way to know, at plug-in activation time, the following: - if the plugin has been deployed as a bundle, or if it has been executed in the context of another Eclipse instance - the output directory of the project from where the plugin was launched (in case of the plug-in being executed from another Eclipse instance). So I could add that output directory to the Reflections library. This is rather more a hack than an ideal solution, but it is the only workaround that has occurred to me until now to make Reflections work properly, given that I do not want to hardcode the output folder of my development project in the code. (if someone knows how I could use Reflections without having to set the output folder when in developing mode, that would be highly appreciated also).

From what I gather its kind of like a zip or exe file similar to software you install on a computer, e.g.. Eclipse its self. Then when installed on a device the files and folders are extracted back into something similar to the file/folder structure I was working on in eclipse. And in which case I then again have access somehow to say the /res and /assets folders once the APK is installed??? Am I on the right track??? Cheers, Mike.

@TITLE:C++ template class map
@CONTENT:I add the constructor and two functions to the class of my previous linked question C++ iterate through a template Map and I need help at this points: What do you reckon this constructor does? Adding one value at the beginning of map? I see though in the respective key only an address as value after initializing in main. What is wrong? The operator [] is supposed to get the values for a specific key. However I cannot use it so as to get the elements of the map in the output. Any hint? template<class K, class V>
class template_map{
public:
    template_map( V const& val) {
        m_map.insert(my_map.begin(),std::make_pair(std::numeric_limits<K>::min(),val));

    }

    ...
};

 Consider also that it should be a function that inserts values to the map.

You will design the relevant code in ASP.NET and C# so that you can deploy a web role on Azure that can: a) read in a zip file from input on the web page b) uncompress the zip file which will have an executable, an arbitrary list of arguments and data files c) run the executable with the arguments (and hence read in the data files). d) store the output logs for access later. You will test this by running a piece of code that reads in a set of arguments which correspond to test files. The executable will then read in the text files and then print them out. You will also have to design an appropriate UML to explain how the different classes you have written interact.

  private native void print();
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    new HelloWorld().print();
  }
  static {
    System.loadLibrary("HelloWorld");
  }
}
 I compiled using javac HelloWorld.java and after that got .H file for C program using "javah -jni HelloWorld" Even my C code is also simple with : #include <jni.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include "HelloWorld.h"
JNIEXPORT void JNICALL
Java_HelloWorld_print(JNIEnv *env, jobject obj)
{
  printf("Hello World!\n");
  return;
}
 I created .dll in Cygwin using "gcc -Wl,--add-stdcall-alias -shared -o HelloWorld.dll HelloWorld.c" Even I used normal Linux method of Creating Shared Lib: "gcc -shared -Wl,-soname,libHelloWorld.so -o libHelloWorld.so HelloWorld.o" But when I run java HelloWorld, it return Aborted! Since i dont have much idea in Java, I am not sure where I going wrong. I checked similar code present in few websites like: http://www.inonit.com/cygwin/jni/helloWorld/ but getting similar error.

  private native void print();
  public static void main(String[] args) {

@CONTENT:Well, I really hoped I could handle this without asking here, but I can't :( The idea is pretty simple, you have this link http://cetatenie.just.ro/ and the link is important, because it works for others. You want to perform a HTTP GET on it from GAE - locally for now, that's it! If I do it in main class, something like this : HttpClient httpClient = new DefaultHttpClient();    
HttpGet httpGet = new HttpGet("http://cetatenie.just.ro/");
HttpResponse response = httpClient.execute(httpGet);
 And then parse the response everything is fine, now I do the same (almost) thing in GAE - locally (in Eclipse --> Run As --> Web Application), with the help of the Eclipse GAE plugin. FetchOptions fetchOptions = FetchOptions.Builder.withDeadline(50000);
HTTPRequest request = new HTTPRequest(new URL("http://cetatenie.just.ro/"), HTTPMethod.GET, fetchOptions);
System.out.println("ULR-->" + request.getURL());    
URLFetchService service = URLFetchServiceFactory.getURLFetchService();
HTTPResponse response = service.fetch(request);
System.out.println("RESPONSE_CODE-->" + response.getResponseCode());
String responseAsString = new String(response.getContent());
System.out.println("RESPONSE_AS_STRING-->" + responseAsString);
 I always get a Http 500 error code. I know that this indicates on a server problem, but how come it works from my stand-alone application? Is GAE doing something fishy? Regards, Eugene.
@CODE:HttpClient httpClient = new DefaultHttpClient();

 To run the application, I should use somethink like project -x somethink.obj. But because I cannot compile the makefile I cannot run the project. Can you help me?

@TITLE:Android JNI Debug: Eclipse : Project specified in the launch configuration is not a C/C++ one
@CONTENT:I'm on Eclipse Indigo. I'm trying to Debug the JNI/C++ portion of an Android Eclipse Project. I don't want to convert my Android project over to a C++ project for obvious reasons. I don't mind adding C++ nature but the options I have tried so far change my project to a C++ project that needs a make file. So the debug proceedures is that I start a Java Android Debug session, startup the ndk-gdb debug server, and then I need to attach the C++ debugger somehow. So I created a C++ Debug Profile in addition to the Android Java Debug Config. But when I start it up I get Project specified is not C/C++. Should I create a dummy C++ project just to get the debug session working? Thanks PS: I am following the steps in this guide to debug JNI in Android: http://mhandroid.wordpress.com/2011/01/23/using-eclipse-for-android-cc-debugging/#more-23 And it does not indicate the need to create a separate C++ project.

@TITLE:Storing XML object in PHP Session Variables
@CONTENT:There are a lot of discussions on this topic but I'd like to ask this question anyways to determine the best approach for my specific situation... I'm using the linkedIn API with CakePHP. From the LinkedIn API I get an XML object. I would like to store this XML objects (the whole thing) in a session variable so I do not have to call the API on every page. My understanding is that it's not possible to store XML objects in a PHP Session. What is the usual workaround for this? I've already written a lot of code that reads/manipulates the XML objects, so I'd like to avoid turning the object into an array or something else so that I do not need to rewrite this code. Many Thanks

@TITLE:Ajax PHP Search, Query result instead of XML
@CONTENT:I'm following the tutorial from w3schools on ajax search and I'm having some trouble tweaking the code. The structure I got is: search.php - ( Where the search terms ?q=search will output a result as echo $result ) livesearch.php - ( Where it will exchange information between search.php and search.html ) search.html - ( Where it contains java script and what not ) How can I, please, make it instead of grabbing information from XML, grab from the output string in search.php? In other words, if the HTTP request is "livesearch.php?q=searchTerm", I want to output "searchTerm."

@TITLE:Show a list of all XML filenames in the res folder for an Android application
@CONTENT:I'm simply trying to get a list of all the XML files in my res/xml folder. I have tried to use the asset manager .list() function, but that doesn't seem to return anything. I have tried other methods, but none seem to work. They either fail, or return nothing. This is simply so I can show a ListView which contains the name of each file. Does anyone have any ideas of what is necessary to do this?

@LINK:/questions/8408922/android-how-to-change-attributes-in-ondraw-by-onclicklistener
@TITLE:AndroidGhow to change attributes in ondraw() by onclickListener
@CONTENT:I have a simple ondraw() function. private class MyViewCircle extends View {
        public MyViewCircle(Context context) {
            super(context);
            // TODO Auto-generated constructor stub
        }
        @Override
        protected void onDraw(Canvas canvas) {
            // TODO Auto-generated method stub
            super.onDraw(canvas);
            Paint paint = new Paint();
            paint.setAntiAlias(true);
            paint.setColor(Color.BLACK);
            canvas.drawCircle(20, 20, 50,
                    paint);
        }
    }
 It works good. But I want it more interesting. I create a onclickListener. evolve.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {         @Override
        public void onClick(View v) {
            // TODO Auto-generated method stub
            //How to change attributes?
        }
    });
 When I click the button, the attributes will be changed. For example, change to paint.setColor(Color.BLUE);
canvas.drawCircle(30, 30, 50,paint);
 My question is: How could I implement this? When I click the button, the image will be automatically re-generated. Thanks!

        public MyViewCircle(Context context) {

                    paint);
        }
    } @Override

@CONTENT:I am having trouble running the following code. Not sure if I am doing this right, but I am trying to have the main method read two files that I am passing to the method as arguments. So in the interactions pane, I am typing: run Main(customer.dat, smartphone.dat) If I try to do this, I get an error: invalid top level statement I have attached the main method below.

@TITLE:jqGrid - cells with TD elements inside
@CONTENT:I seem to have an issue where with jQuery Grid (jqGrid) if I have loaded data where one of the cells has a table inside, it throws an error when onSelectRow() is fired and I call $(grid).getRowData(rowid). jqGrid seems to be enumerating ALL of the TD elements in the selected row (including those which are children of the table within a given cell). Is there a proper way to do this or to prevent jqGrid from enumerating those elements? :( EDIT: In my particular case, the HTML was hidden until needed, so I was able to replace the TD's with "xtd" on the server until sent out to the client. On the client-side, when I needed them HTML, I just replace "xtd" to "td". Still wish there was a better way. EDIT: I want to clarify, I desire a method of doing this that doesn't modify the plugin. An well-written modification would still be nice.

@TITLE:Finding execution context information about an Eclipse plug-in
@CONTENT:I am using the Reflections library in the Eclipse plug-in I am currently developing. Apparently everything is fine when the plug-in is deployed as a bundle in Eclipse (i.e., its jar is dropped in the plugins folder of Eclipse), but when the plug-in is executed during development (Run As/Eclipse Application), I need to add to the search paths of the Reflections library the output folder (e.g., 'bin') from the project where the plug-in was executed. Then my question is if there a way to know, at plug-in activation time, the following: - if the plugin has been deployed as a bundle, or if it has been executed in the context of another Eclipse instance - the output directory of the project from where the plugin was launched (in case of the plug-in being executed from another Eclipse instance). So I could add that output directory to the Reflections library. This is rather more a hack than an ideal solution, but it is the only workaround that has occurred to me until now to make Reflections work properly, given that I do not want to hardcode the output folder of my development project in the code. (if someone knows how I could use Reflections without having to set the output folder when in developing mode, that would be highly appreciated also).

@CONTENT:I have a program that spawns lots of children and runs for long periods of time. The program contains a SIGCHLD handler to reap defunct processes. Occasionally, this program freezes.

 I'm running in a Solaris 9 environment. The program was compiled with Sun WorkShop 6 update 2 C 5.3 Patch 111679-15 2009/09/10 using the following syntax: cc -o asyncsignalhandler asyncsignalhandler.c -mt -D_POSIX_PTHREAD_SEMANTICS
 Is there a flaw in the program? Are there better ways to handle logging (with timestamps) from a signal handler?

@TITLE:Do at compile time Linq-To-Objects statements also get translated into Expression Tree objects?
@CONTENT:At compile time LINQ statements that operate on IQueryable<T> ( thus Linq-to-SQL and Linq-to-Entities statements ) get translated into an expression tree objects that present code as data. a) Do LINQ statements that operate on IEnumerable<T> ( thus LINQ-to-Objects ) also get translated into expression trees? b) If not, what happens with LINQ-to-Object statements at compile time? Does compiler simply translate them into appropriate method calls? For example, is the next Linq-to-Objects statement: var results = collection.Select(item => item.id).Where(id => id > 10);
 translated by compiler into something similar to the following: var results = Enumerable.Where(
                  Enumerable.Select(collection, item => item.id),
                  id => id > 10
              );
 thank you

 and as you see, a mDB.KEY_POSTER is an image stocked in the database. I tried to save the path into the database and that didn't work, if you can provide a way to do that with an example, that will be equally helpful,thx

@LINK:/questions/8396493/update-gridview-with-dropdownlist-control
@TITLE:Update GridView with Dropdownlist control
@CONTENT:I am using VS2005 C#. Currently I have a GridView, and I have changed one of my GridView control to my column name Gender, from the default TextBox to a DropDownList, which I gave the ID of the control to GenderList, and it contains 2 values, M and F. I have a default update statement which is able to update the GridView after edit, which is the following: <asp:SqlDataSource ID="SqlDataSource1" runat="server" ConnectionString=
"<%$ ConnectionStrings:SODConnectionString %>" UpdateCommand="UPDATE 
[UserMasterData] SET [Name] = @Name, [Age] = @Age, [ContactNo]=@ContactNo,
 [Address]=@Address, [Gender]=@Gender"/>
 The above UPDATE query works perfectly, and now I have changed my Gender textbox to a dropdownlist, the UPDATE query gave me an error which says: Must declare the scalar variable "@Gender". I assume the UPDATE query couldn't find the value from my Gender column. I tried to modify the UPDATE query to @GenderList, but it did not work as well. Anyone knows what I should do do the UPDATE query so that my UPDATE query can find the value from my GenderList dropdownlist in my Gender column? Thank you. Below is my previous Gender column with a textbox control:                 <asp:BoundField  HeaderText="Gender" 
                DataField="Gender" 
                SortExpression="Gender"></asp:BoundField>

@LINK:/questions/8394987/why-does-objectoutputstream-writeobject-throw-ioexception
@TITLE:Why does ObjectOutputStream.writeObject() throw IOException?
@CONTENT:I'm currently working on an Android app that automatically changes the phones state based on a certain event, such as battery level. I have a Profile class which has 3 main parameters, names, Event and State (Event and State are 2 other custom classes) In my ProfileEdit class, there are various components such as EditText and Spinner for users to configure a Profile. I need access to an ArrayList of type Profile in a ListActivity class which displays each profile, and my ProfileEdit class which gets the current ArrayList and adds the new profile, or updates one. The idea I had to do this first was to use ObjectOutputStream to write my ArrayList to the phones sd card, then it can be retrieved by any class that needs it. However my attempts to do this so far just end up throwing an IOException. My code is as follows: ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream("/sdcard/profile.prof"));
oos.writeObject(profiles);
oos.flush();
oos.close();
 The profiles object is my ArrayList to be written to the file. I can't figure out why this is throwing the exception. I tried changing the object to a string by calling writeObject("Hello"); and that no longer threw the exception, so I can only assume its a problem with the ArrayList. I was under the impression that the ArrayList class implements serializable and my Profile class also implements serializable, although it does the same thing without. Alternatively, if there's a better way I can give both my ProfileList (ListActivity) and ProfileEdit classes access to the same ArrayList then please let me know. Edit: Here's the IO Exceptions stack trace: (Line 114 of the ProfileEdit class is the writeObject() line) EZSettings(14788): IO Exception

{
  int startX,startY;
  boolean yAxis = false;
  boolean xAxis = false;
  Timer animator;
  String direction;


  public BulletAnimator(int sX, int sY, String d)
  {
    direction = d;

    startX = sX;
    startY = sY;

    animator = new Timer (10, this);
    animator.start();
  }

  //chooses the right picture for the right direction
  public ImageIcon chooseBulletPicture ()
  {
    String path = "bullet";

    if (direction.equals("left"))
      path += "LEFT";
    else if (direction.equals ("right"))

    else if (direction.equals ("up"))
      path += "UP";
    else

    path += ".png";

    ImageIcon b= new ImageIcon (path);

    return b;
  }

  public void paintComponent (Graphics g)

    super. paintComponent(g);

    if (startX >= 500 || startY >= 500)
      animator.stop();

    if (direction.equals ("up"))
      startY -=2;
    else if (direction.equals ("down"))
      startY +=2;
    else if (direction.equals ("right"))
      startX += 2;
    else
      startX -=2;


    chooseBulletPicture().paintIcon (this, g, startX, startY);
   }

  public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e)
  {
    repaint ();
  }
}
 and this is the class is to add keyListeners and test it: import java.awt.event.*;
import java.awt.*;
import javax.swing.*;

public class Test extends JFrame implements KeyListener
{
  JFrame f;

  public Test ()
  {
    addKeyListener (this);
    setFocusable (true);

    f = new JFrame ();
    f.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
    f.setVisible(true);
    f.setSize(500, 500);
  }

  public void keyPressed(KeyEvent e) 
  {
    BulletAnimator s = new BulletAnimator (250, 250, "initialized---blank");

    //creates bullet w/ correct direction
    if (e.getKeyCode() == KeyEvent.VK_RIGHT )
    {
      s = new BulletAnimator (250, 250, "right");
    } 
    else if (e.getKeyCode() == KeyEvent.VK_LEFT ) 
    {
       s = new BulletAnimator (250, 250, "left"); 
    }

       s = new BulletAnimator (250, 250, "down");
    }

    System.out.println ("keyPressed method read");//checks if keyPressed method was looked at

    f.add (s);
    repaint();
  }

  public void keyReleased (KeyEvent e)
  {}
  public void keyTyped (KeyEvent e)
  {}

  public static void main (String [] args)
  {
    Test t = new Test ();
  }
}
 As you can see I tried to put in a test that says "keyPressed method read"... when the program runs it doesn't print. In fact nothing at all happens its just a grey screen... quite frustrating really. Well thank you in advance if you took the time to look at it, I would greatly appreciate any advice!
@CODE:public class BulletAnimator extends JPanel implements ActionListener

    startX = sX;
    startY = sY;

    animator = new Timer (10, this);
    animator.start();
  }

  //chooses the right picture for the right direction
  public ImageIcon chooseBulletPicture ()

    String path = "bullet";

public void testPDMServerThread() {
    try {           
        ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(0);        
        int port = serverSocket.getPort();

        Socket clientSocket = new Socket("localhost", port);
        PrintWriter clientRequest = new PrintWriter(clientSocket.getOutputStream(), true);
        BufferedReader serverResponse = new BufferedReader(

        serverThread = new ProducerMonitorServerThread(serverSocket.accept());

        clientRequest.write("Hi!");
        serverThread.start();

        assertEquals("RUNNABLE", serverThread.getState().toString());
    } catch (IOException e) {
    }
}
 And here's the thread where the server should respond public class ProducerMonitorServerThread extends Thread {

    private Socket socket;

    public ProducerMonitorServerThread(Socket socket) {
        super("PDM");
        this.socket = socket;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {

        try {
            PrintWriter serverResponse = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), true);
            BufferedReader clientRequest = new BufferedReader(
                    new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));

            String serverInput, clientOutput;

            while((serverInput = clientRequest.readLine()) != null) {

        } catch (IOException e) {
        }           
    }

 It never seems to get past this line which is why I think accept is not seeing the connection serverThread = new ProducerMonitorServerThread(testServer.accept());
 I'm sure there's something fundamental that I'm just not seeing.

@TITLE:Theming Module Output
@CONTENT:What I am trying to do is generate some raw output within a module. I would like to pass an array of data through to a template file, and then use that data to populate the code from the template. The template is represented by a file in my theme folder. I have a hook set up for a certain URL (/itunes): $items['itunes'] = array(
    'page callback'     =>  'itunespromo_buildpage',
    'type'              =>  MENU_SUGGESTED_ITEM,
    'access arguments'  =>  array('access content'),

 ..inside itunespromo_buildpage... function itunespromo_buildpage() {
    //grab some data to pass through to template file, put into $promo_data
    $details = theme('itunes_page', array(
        'promo_data'    =>   $promo_data,
    ));
    return $details;
}
 Here is the hook_theme(): function itunespromo_theme() {

        'itunes_page'   =>  array(
            'template'  =>  'itunes_page',
        ),
    );
}
 Inside my theme's template.php: function geddystyle_itunes_page($vars) {
    return print_r($vars['promo_data'], true);
}
 Right now, $promo_data is being passed through fine, and it is print_r'd on to the result page. However, I'd like to then take this $promo_data variable and use it in my itunes_page.tpl.php template file. I'm kind of certain I'm close here. Am I supposed to call some sort of render function and pass the $promo_data variable to it from function itunespromo_theme()?
@CODE:$items['itunes'] = array(

@TITLE:UTF-8 Headaches Access to mySQL/PHP
@CONTENT:My mySQL database create shows CREATE DATABASE `foo` /*!40100 DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci */ 
 The mySQL field collation shows utf8_unicode_ci. The Access export specifies a Code Page of Unicode (UTF-8). The importing query is LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE '/home/foo/Snapshot/tblImages.txt' INTO TABLE `tblImages` CHARACTER SET utf8 FIELDS OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '|' TERMINATED BY ';' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n';
 Before drawing the page PHP issues header('Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8');
 In the <head> I have <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />
 If I open the Access exported txt file in UltraEdit under Windows 7 I see correct accents: Plan dune propri?t? situ?e dans la premi?re Municipalit? (1000 Dauphine corner St. Philip) If I query the data in mySQL monitor under Linux I see: Plan d?une propri??t?? situ??e dans la premi??re Municipalit?? (1000 Dauphine corner St. Philip) And when I echo the query output to a browser I see: Plan d?une propri?t? situ?e dans la premi?re Municipalit?

@CONTENT:I asked several days ago about finding the most deeply nested lists. I implemented the idea that was given, and it works. But there is another problem: I also need to build a list from the nested list. meaning: If I change (8) and (10 11 12), to leaf1 and leaf2, I need to return: '(ans (leaf1 (8)) (leaf2 (10 11 12)). /ans is a quote In other words: my function will get (1 (2 3) (4 (5) (7 (8) (10 11 12)))))) => the most nested lists are (8) and (10 11 12) => my function will return '(ans (leaf1 (8)) (leaf2 (10 11 12)). I am trying to find an idea, not an implementation. Thanks.

@TITLE:How to get a value from a generic dictionary using a custom comparer for the key?
@CONTENT:I have a generic dictionary of objects and want to use a custom comparer to update the value in the dictionary. myObjects contains a dictionary of objects and the value is the number of times that object exists. Note that the value may be incremented numerous times using different comparators or removed altogether. testObject is my custom object. customComparer is a dynamically changing comparer based on the type of testObject. but all comparers are of the type IEqualityComparer<MyObject> IDictionary<MyObject, int> myObjects;
var testObject;
var customComparer;

if (myObjects.Keys.Contains(testObject, customComparer))
{
    //get the value, if its > 1 then decrement the value
    //else remove the entry entirely
    //not sure how to get the value based on my custom comparer??

    //this code below does not work because it requires the custom comparer
    //var occurrences = myObjects[testObject];
    //if (occurrences > 1)
    //    myObjects[testObject]--;
    //else
    //    myObjects.Remove(testObject);
}
else
{
    myObjects.Add(testObject, 1);
}
 I can use Keys.Contains to determine if the object exists with custom comparer but then i'm not sure how to update the value?
@CODE:myObjects testObject customComparer IEqualityComparer<MyObject> IDictionary<MyObject, int> myObjects;
var testObject;

 As you can see from the code I have commented out, I have tried everything possible to get this working and the only thing that works is if I set the password directly. I am trying to use the RSA private key generated, but I keep getting an auth fail. I have added the public key to the list of authorized keys on the target server. And there is no passphrase. Is there something else I am supposed to do? Like say, while generating the keys? Is there a step I am missing? Is there another library I can use to implement the same function?

@TITLE:Magento: Can't get categories children
@CONTENT:For some reason this code is returning NULL when trying to get a categories subcategories.  <?php var_dump($_category->getChildrenCategories()); ?>

                <?php if ($open && $potential): ?>

                        <?php if ($open && $potential): ?>

                            <?php foreach ($subcategory->getChildrenCategories() as $subsubcategory): ?>

                            <?php endforeach; ?>
                        </ul>
                        <?php endif; ?>

            </li>
            <?php } ?>
            <?php endforeach ?>
        </ul>
 This line always returns true <?php $potential = $_category->hasChildren(); ?>
 And I know that the category has children. Can anyone suggest why this doesn't work? This is how I place the phtml in the page: <reference name="left">
    <block type="catalog/navigation" name="catalog.vertnav" template="catalog/navigation/vert_nav.phtml" before="-" />

@TITLE:LEFT/RIGHT JOIN not returning empty row
@CONTENT:I have a query which uses a self join on 2 tables to return a single row of results. The problem I have is that if seat1 is empty, I don't get anything returned. SELECT seat1.seat_type_id
     , seat1.seat_type_qty
     , seat2.seat_type_id
     , seat2.seat_type_qty
  FROM jos_sv_apptpro2_requests AS R 
  LEFT JOIN jos_sv_apptpro2_seat_counts AS seat1 ON R.id_requests = seat1.request_id 
  LEFT JOIN jos_sv_apptpro2_seat_counts AS seat2 ON R.id_requests = seat2.request_id
 WHERE (seat1.seat_type_id = 6 AND seat2.seat_type_id = 7)
   AND R.id_requests = 8703
   AND R.resource = 3
 This should return: seat_type_id 6
seat_type_qty 0 <= this is the empty row
seat_type_id1 7
seat_type_qty 1
 EDIT: I've now got: SELECT
IFNULL(seat1.seat_type_qty,0) AS seat_type_qty,
IFNULL(seat2.seat_type_qty,0) AS seat_type_qty
FROM jos_sv_apptpro2_requests AS R 
LEFT JOIN jos_sv_apptpro2_seat_counts AS seat1

LEFT JOIN jos_sv_apptpro2_seat_counts AS seat2 
ON R.id_requests = seat2.request_id AND seat2.seat_type_id = 7
WHERE R.id_requests = 8696
 REEDIT! - My mistake, I'm returning seat_type_qty twice as an object in my PHP. All sorted now - THANKS!

@TITLE:PNG RGB transformation related to alpha in getImageData?
@CONTENT:I have a PNG image with some pixels having an alpha of 254. These pixels have this color : RGBA{183, 221, 129, 254} (not a javascript notation). I can check in Gimp that the R, G and B components are 183, 221 and 129. But when I read my pixels in Chrome using getImageData (on a canvas) the R, G and B values are modified to 182, 220 and 128 (A being correctly 254). Is that a standardized transformation or a bug ? If that's normal, where can I find the exact formula to predict RGB values given by getImageData from the ones in the PNG ?

@TITLE:Two Submit Buttons, Want to Run Separate Parts of a Script Based on Which is Clicked
@CONTENT:Ok so I have two submit buttons, a standard submit button, as well as a , etc, etc button. Anyway, the second button is a delete button, but both of them go to the same function, because of onSubmit. What I want to do is set up an if statement to see if the delete button was pressed. Here's the code to generate the delete button (the value is generated by PHP): <button type="submit" name="del" id="deletebutton" value="'.$org.'">Delete</button>
 Here's my idea so far:     if (document.getElementById('deletebutton').value != '') {
     BLAHBLAHBLAH CODE HERE for delete button click;
    }
else {
BLAHBLAHBLAH Code for non-delete button click;
}
 but my IDE (NetBeans) seems to show an error when I try to do this. How would the correct way to do this be? EDIT: DOH typo!
@CODE:<button type="submit" name="del" id="deletebutton" value="'.$org.'">Delete</button> if (document.getElementById('deletebutton').value != '') {
     BLAHBLAHBLAH CODE HERE for delete button click;

@LINK:/questions/8385281/responsenotready-for-really-simple-python-http-request
@TITLE:ResponseNotReady for really simple python http request?
@CONTENT:I'm writing a simple script in python to replay saved HTTP requests. Here is the script: import httplib

requestFileName = 'C:/Users/Owner/request.txt'
connectionURL = 'localhost:4059'

requestFile = open(requestFileName,'r')

connection = httplib.HTTPConnection(connectionURL)
connection.send(requestFile.read())

response = connection.getresponse()
print response.status + " " + response.reason

connection.close()
 And here is request.txt: POST /ipn/handler.ashx?inst=272&msgType=result HTTP/1.0
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8
Host: mysite.com
Content-Length: 28
User-Agent: AGENT/1.0 (UserAgent)

region=website&compName=ACTL
 When I run this script, I get this error message: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:/Users/Owner/doHttpRequest.py", line 11, in <module>
    response = connection.getresponse()
  File "C:\Python27\lib\httplib.py", line 1015, in getresponse
    raise ResponseNotReady()
ResponseNotReady
 However, my server receives the request fine. I can examine the server code with the debugger and see that the request has been transmitted correctly, with all headers. Why is my script saying ResponseNotReady? This isn't a huge issue as my script performs its main task (to replay saved http requests) but I'd like to be able to output some basic information with the script, such as status codes, or to save the contents of the response somewhere

@TITLE:In a ListView containing Buttons, how to get Index of the clicked one?
@CONTENT:I have a ListView containing only buttons. What I want to do is pretty simple, I want to have the index of the button that has been clicked. The count of the list varies from 0 to 100, so when the user clicks on button 6, I need this number for processing. I defined my ListView like this: <ListView Name="myListView" 
          ItemsSource="{Binding Source={StaticResource myDataModel}, 
          Path=StatusList, 
          Mode=OneWay}">
          <ListView.ItemsPanel>
                <ItemsPanelTemplate>
                    <StackPanel Orientation="Horizontal"></StackPanel>
                </ItemsPanelTemplate>
          </ListView.ItemsPanel>

          <ListView.ItemTemplate>
               <DataTemplate>
                    <Button Mode=OneWay}"  
                            Click="Button_Click"/> 
                </DataTemplate>
           </ListView.ItemTemplate>
 </ListView>
 My original idea was to create a custom button with an ID and bind the index to the ID but I can't figure out how to do that. I tried: int a = myListView.Items.IndexOf(((Button)sender)); 
 inside the event handler, but it always returns 0xffffffff can anybody tell me how to get the index of the clicked button?
@CODE:ListView ListView <ListView Name="myListView" 
          ItemsSource="{Binding Source={StaticResource myDataModel}, 
          Path=StatusList, 
          Mode=OneWay}">
          <ListView.ItemsPanel>

@CONTENT:I have been trying to generate a video from a set of images using ffmpeg. Everything seems to be working, but when I watch the video I notice that some of the images are missing. I checked the output from ffmpeg, and it seems that it processes all the source images. Has any of you experienced the same problem? I'm using mp4 format and mpeg4 codec. Interestingly, if I use avi format, without specifying any codec, I can see those missing images correctly (although the video seems to be jumping from one image to the next quite irregularly). By the way, I have only 14 images, so I set a frame rate of 6. The mp4 video is smooth with these settings, but the avi is quite 'jumpy'. Thanks in advance.

@TITLE:Creating JUnit report programmatically
@CONTENT:My current approach right now is from my application, just call the ant build and it will create the junit reports needed, but I want to have the flexibility to code junit reports programmatically. I tried this approach Ant:create JUnit report task programmatically FileSet fs = new FileSet();
fs.setDir(new File(".."));
fs.createInclude().setName("TEST-*.xml");
XMLResultAggregator aggregator = new XMLResultAggregator();
aggregator.addFileSet(fs);
AggregateTransformer transformer = aggregator.createReport();
transformer.setFormat(Format.FRAMES);
transformer.setTodir(new File("..");
 but I can't even get it running. Any more ideas?

 As you have probably noticed it is a spiral. Now the algorithm I'm using is this: I have a 2-d array where the values represent the coordinates of the number. First I assign that every number coordinate in this array will have a value of 10. Then starting at 9 I decrease my x coordinate and assign the value of the coordinate to currentnum - 1 until it reaches the end or its value is not 10; Then I do the same thing except I increase the value of Y; Then decrease the value of x; Then of Y; The reason I assign 10 to every number is so like it acts as a road for my program. Since current num will never exceed 9. If the value of a square is 10 it is like a green light. If it is not 10 meaning a value has been assigned to that square it breaks out of it. Here is my code, please note it is written in Java public class spiral {

 I'm getting this error Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 3

 Since I'm new to Java would someone please suggest a posible fix for this. Also if you see any problems with my algorithm please do inform me.

@CONTENT:I'm trying to write a simple wrapper class in F# that takes a function that returns a string, and returns a function that takes the same parameters and returns the string from the input 'wrapped'. The following code works for functions that take a single variable (so test works fine): open System

@TITLE:Search an arraylist by the contents of a JTextField - arraylist.contains(jtextfield)
@CONTENT:Currently, I'm trying to write a system, which is focused around inputting data into lists and arraylists, and implementing search and sort functionality. Currently on my system, I have: A class to store data An arraylist class which gets data from an object within the data storage class. And finally, a swing GUI class, which contains a JList which displays the Arraylist. What i'm trying to do is search through the arraylist with a JButton actionlistener, and then output the results on the search to the JList. The JButton would take the contents of a JTextField, and check if the string is present in the ArrayList. My question first of all is, how would I go about creating a search function in the arraylist class, and call the contents of a JTextField in a seperate class? Secondly, would I need to convert the jtextfield to a string before I could call a .contains method on the arraylist? and thirdly, once the search function is implemented, how would I go about selecting a record from the arraylist if the text searched for is present Here is my Data storage class: http://pastebin.com/hwyD8r1j My arraylist class: http://pastebin.com/d3ftLsJb I'm not expecting you guys to write it for me, although that would be nice, haha. But any pointers or insight on how I could go about implementing this functionality into my arraylist would be appreciated, Oh and if you need me to post my GUI class, just ask.

@LINK:/questions/8376980/resize-animations-on-a-scrollview
@TITLE:Resize animations on a scrollview
@CONTENT:I am trying to create a resize toggle animation on this simple custom TUIScrollView class (from TwUI open source project and very similar to UIScrollView) that I have built. It is called TUILayout and supports horizontal layout as well as vertical, animated insertions and removals and has a more declarative way of supplying data to it's cells that I prefer over delegation. It recycles views similar to TUITableView or UITableView. Anyway if you want to follow along, it's just one class and is here. https://github.com/mrjjwright/TUILayout. In the example code, the user clicks the blue button in the lower left and all the rows shrink smoothly to a size where the user can reorder and delete some rows (right click on a row in the example to see this in action), etc... and then the user toggle the rows back out to their original size by clicking the blue button again. While doing this resize in setObjectHeight:animated I first resize my model objects that represent the rows, recalculate and set the contentSize on the TUIScrollView, cycle in all the new views (say 10 more views will fit in the shrunk view so dequeueReusableView and addSubview gets called 10 times) and finally I animate the frames of all the views to their size and location in layoutSubviews. The result is that the scrollview correctly shrinks to a size where the scrollbar no longer displays, the views that are on screen animate smoothly down to their reduced size, but the newly added subviews that can now fit in the visibleRect animate in much later as one block of subviews. So all the newly added subviews lag behind the views that were on the screen and I can't figure out why the animation isn't all happening together. I have tried lots of different combos of things with no luck including CATransactions. I am wondering if it has to with how a CAScrollLayer works or if somebody can help me think through this. The more general issue is how to smoothly handle resizing animations on scrollviews that recycles their views and I have looked at several other grids out there in the iOS world and have got some inspiration but am looking for more. Thanks!

@CONTENT:I'm building a website using CI, HMVC and Smarty. It's my first time using HMVC and I don't understand how I can use common libraries within the modules. I prefer using Smarty on my sites and usually it's a piece of cake: I create a wrapper for smarty, autoload it and use it in controllers where necessary. But now I need to use smarty within the module controller and I don't know how to access it. Any ideas how I can do that? I've been researching the issue for a couple of days, with no luck. There are some answers which I just don't get: like this one EDIT: CI 2.1.0, HMVC 5.4, Smarty 3.1.6 (but this is irrelevant)

@CONTENT:I'm currently developing a game in the LeadWerks 2 engine and I've decided to use Qt4 as the GUI and window manager. What I want to do is create a Qt QGLWidget window and have the LeadWerks engine run inside of that. There is some information of building a basic QGLWidget application here. I'm really struggling to understand how to do this exactly. I can create a custom GL buffer within the LeadWerks engine and I believe what I need to do is give that buffer the GL context Qt created. As for the LeadWerks side of things, the main thing I need to do is call a method called CreateCustomBuffer and pass it a few things: virtual void Buffer::CreateCustom( byte* getsize, byte* makecurrent) Creates and returns a new custom buffer. GetSize (defined as void _stdcall GetSize(int* width, int* height)) and MakeCurrent (defined as void _stdcall MakeCurrent(void)) are callback functions for the buffer. GetSize should return (by changing the value provided with a pointer) the size of the custum OpenGL buffer/context used. MakeCurrent should set the custom buffer as the current OpenGL context.

@LINK:/questions/8370591/rails-accessing-a-non-instance-variable-in-js-erb
@TITLE:rails: accessing a non-instance variable in js.erb
@CONTENT:I have a page that renders multiple forms. Currently, when the user submits any one of these forms, it updates (via ajax) a div on the same page with the content from the form that was just submitted. I also want to remove() the form element that was just submitted after the ajax post request is completed. However, I need to be able to access that specific form ID within the js.erb file to do so. Since my page has x number of forms rendered dynamically, I cannot simply access an instance variable in my js.erb. Page: <% for peer_review in @peer_reviews %>
    <%= render :partial => 'form', :locals => { :peer_review => peer_review } %>
<% end %>

<div id="completed_peer_reviews">
    <%= render 'completed_peer_reviews' %>
</div>
 The @peer_reviews instance variable contains an array of new PeerReview objects already containing some data. Form: <div id="peer_review_form_<%= peer_review.reviewee_id %>">
<%= form_for peer_review, :html => { :method => "post" }, :remote => true do |f| %>
  <%= f.error_messages %>
  <p>
    Peer Review for: <%= User.find(peer_review.reviewee_id).name %><br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <%= f.label :rating %>: 
    <%= f.select :rating, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], { :include_blank => 'None' } %>
  </p>
  <p>
    <%= f.label :review %><br />
    <%= f.text_area :review %>
  </p>

  <%= f.hidden_field :user_id, :value => peer_review.user_id %>
  <%= f.hidden_field :reviewee_id, :value => peer_review.reviewee_id %>
  <%= f.hidden_field :review_period_id, :value => peer_review.review_period_id %>

  <p><%= f.submit "Submit" %></p>
<% end %>
</div>
 js.erb: $("#completed_peer_reviews").html("<%= escape_javascript(render('completed_peer_reviews')) %>");
 I was hoping to just add another line to the js.erb file that removes the form element that just triggered the execution of the js.erb file like so: $("#peer_review_form_<%= peer_review.reviewee_id %>").remove();
 How should I actually be referencing peer_review.reviewee_id here? Or should I be taking a completely different approach?
@CODE:<% for peer_review in @peer_reviews %>
    <%= render :partial => 'form', :locals => { :peer_review => peer_review } %>
<% end %>

<div id="completed_peer_reviews">
    <%= render 'completed_peer_reviews' %>
</div> <div id="peer_review_form_<%= peer_review.reviewee_id %>">
<%= form_for peer_review, :html => { :method => "post" }, :remote => true do |f| %>
  <%= f.error_messages %>
  <p>
    Peer Review for: <%= User.find(peer_review.reviewee_id).name %><br />
  </p>

@TITLE:is_dir() returns FALSE when passed a subfolder
@CONTENT:is_dir() according to the php manual returns true if passed a string that refers to a folder. It's returning false -- despite being passed an array of valid folder names -- this is probably something simple but I'm beating myself up over not finding it. Here is the code: define('TEST_SUBFOLDERS_FILES_PATH', 'C:/xampp/htdocs/theProj/mainSubdir/');

$currentFolder = ' ';
$rootOfmainSubdir = TEST_SUBFOLDERS_FILES_PATH';
$theArrayOfDirsAndFilesInmainSubdir;

// fill an array that contains all files and folders under the /mainSubdir folder
// using php's 'scandir()'
if( ($theArrayOfDirsAndFilesInmainSubdir = scandir($rootOfmainSubdir )) != FALSE )
{
  $numArrayEntries = count($theArrayOfDirsAndFilesInmainSubdir);
  echo "<br><br>The number of folders/files found is:  " . $numArrayEntries;


  // now do the triage on subfolders under /mainSubdir  versus files
  for($i = 0; $i < $numArrayEntries; $i++)
  {
    echo "<br><br>Current array element is:  " 
            . $theArrayOfDirsAndFilesInmainSubdir[$i]
            . "  and is_dir() on this element returns --> "
            . var_dump( is_dir($theArrayOfDirsAndFilesInmainSubdir[$i]) );  
    // rest of code
 Here is what I see on the output for almost all the folders: Current array element is: testFolderN and is_dir() on this element returns -->

boolean false
 OR I see: Current array element is: . and is_dir() on this element returns -->

boolean true
 AND: Current array element is: .. and is_dir() on this element returns -->

boolean true
 I'm missing something really dumb here but sheesh. It seems that is_dir() is correctly returning TRUE only for the current folder "." and the parent folder ".." If there is a nuance I'm missing in the use of is_dir() I'm not seeing it. Help is appreciated -- all I'm going to do in the code is to make a list of the current subfolders under the TEST_SUBFOLDERS_FILES_PATH if I can get is_dir() to return TRUE not only for "." and ".." but also the other 'testFolderN' subfolders. By the way -- there is a total of 5 subfolders, and one file in the directory, so the display of the count above is: The number of folders/files found is: 8
@CODE:define('TEST_SUBFOLDERS_FILES_PATH', 'C:/xampp/htdocs/theProj/mainSubdir/');

$currentFolder = ' ';
$rootOfmainSubdir = TEST_SUBFOLDERS_FILES_PATH';
$theArrayOfDirsAndFilesInmainSubdir;

// fill an array that contains all files and folders under the /mainSubdir folder
// using php's 'scandir()'

@TITLE:Avoiding double encoding in <INPUT> while using htmlspecialchars
@CONTENT:Say you have a text <INPUT> for a user's name and they decide to type in Johnny's Pizza
 This is saved in DB as Johnny's Pizza
 But if the user decides to edit, I repopulate the text <INPUT> as follows echo form_input('name', htmlspecialchars($name, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8'));
 which will show as Johnny&#039;s Pizza
 inside the input field. PHP.net has a comment here suggesting to use echo form_input('name', htmlspecialchars($name, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8', FALSE));
 that is, FALSE referring to $double_encoding, but I still get Johnny&#039;s Pizza
 in the input field. Is there a way around this double encoding? Is this something that can be fixed while still using ENT_QUOTES? Using Codeigniter 2.0.3.

@CONTENT:Problem Statement: Add a function to an existing COM library that returns a string. C# application consumes the COM library using the COM interop version (.net runtime assembly generated using tblimp) Till now, I've tried the following variations: Code on C++ side: Variation 1: HRESULT GetString([out] BSTR* string); Variation 2: HRESULT GetString([out,retval] BSTR* string); Code on C# side: string str;
 Variation 1: GetString(out str); Variation 2: str = GetString(); However both raise Attempt to read/write memory or similar worded exception. Am I on the right track? Or are there some marshalling limitations that cause the exception to be raised (like when doing memory management etc) ? I could not find a clear explanation on the net as to which approach will work best for the above scenario, so this call for help. Going further the plan is also that this COM function will be called from a Java app. Note: Please disregard function syntax, might contain errors. The implemented code in COM works without any issues when called from within C++ COM library for both variations but fails for C# as stated above.

@CONTENT:I had to developed an application which will communicate with a Web service via python. I have to run this code on a Windows server machine for some reasons (which i am not much experianced with, notmally we use uint based systems). My communication with the api provider is not directly because of some communication issies. So i have to mail my problems to another person and he email them my message in the native language, so i could not get much support from the provider because of that. My problem is, i use suds for web service client. Cleint semmed to succeed to get WSDL definition from the serveer like: from suds.client import Client

class SomeClass(Client):

        Client.__init__(url)

    (TransportSoap) 

         Methods (4) 

             GetBalance()
 ... So i can see that suds can reach target web service and get the WSDL file. However when i call a method like: def myFunc():
    f = SomeClass()    
    f.GetBalance()

@TITLE:Is there an easy way to add multiple javascript images together via `imgCounter.src =`
@CONTENT:In photoshop I created images 0.png thru 9.png and know I can change each digit to simulate a counter by changing each picture of each digit as it counts down. IDEA 1: One way I thought would be to have multiple lines of HTML: <div align="right"><img src="graphics/odometers/1.png" /id="digit1">
                   <img src="graphics/odometers/2.png" /id="digit2">
                   <img src="graphics/odometers/3.png" /id="digit3"></div>
 JAVASCRIPT: var imgCounter = document.getElementById('digit1');
imgCounter.src = "graphics/odometers/white and blue with black background/1.png"; // shows the digit 1
var imgCounter = document.getElementById('digit2');
imgCounter.src = "graphics/odometers/white and blue with black background/2.png"; // shows the digit 2
// etc for as many digits as I want to show
 and change the digits in javascript by each ID. It's not hard but for flexibility can I have 1 image ID and string 3 .png's together in javascript? Like this... IDEA 2: Not sure if this is possible. HTML: <div align="right"><img src="" /id="formtimer"></div>
 JAVASCRIPT: // somehow show 3 graphics in a row 123 without having 3 ID tags, only 1 ID tag
var imgCounter = document.getElementById('formtimer');
imgCounter.src = "graphics/odometers/white and blue with black background/1.png";
 I know the example above only shows the digit 1 and doesn't do all 3 digits... (because I don't know if it's possible). Is there a way to display 3 pictures together? lol. Easily? I know anything can technically be done the hard way... If it's a big pain in the butt I'm ok with IDEA 1 but it's less "freedom" because I have to encode the HTML with multiple ID tags which is tedius... Just curious what you all think and if you have a solution. :) Much appreciated. ALSO: Is it ok to leave the img src="" as a NULL or empty string if I'll later be sticking an image in via javascript?
@CODE:<div align="right"><img src="graphics/odometers/1.png" /id="digit1">
                   <img src="graphics/odometers/2.png" /id="digit2">
                   <img src="graphics/odometers/3.png" /id="digit3"></div> var imgCounter = document.getElementById('digit1');
imgCounter.src = "graphics/odometers/white and blue with black background/1.png"; // shows the digit 1
var imgCounter = document.getElementById('digit2');

@TITLE:CKEditor submitting empty content to the form.
@CONTENT:I've started using CKEditor v3 few weeks ago.using it in a php project.i've been using it with jquery (using jquery adapter) and all this while using $.ajax (because can't handle for errors when using jquery form) to submit and i thought everything was alright . So here pops up a case where i need to use normal form mechanism to submit the ckeditor content and all the other information of the form. To my surprise the content was empty so i started google and apparently it's a known issue. i haven't seen any thing YET that could let me post my content to php side. so i've come up with a workaround. I know onclick will always fire before the onsubmit so i've written this. function returntoSubmit(){
    myForm = document.forms[0];
    myForm.elements["content"].value = $("#content").val();// note that the textarea name and id are all the same "content"

}

// html here 
 <input type="submit" value="Save" onclick="returntoSubmit()" />
 that does the work for me.But truly and a little uncomfortable with this, isn't there any better method to solve this issue? Thanks

    myForm = document.forms[0];

So for example, if the IP of the machine is 192.168.0.5, the script will check to see if it falls between the range 192.168.0.10 to 192.168.0.20.

@TITLE:Getting WPARAM in TWndMethod to return 4 bytes
@CONTENT:I'm using AllocateHWnd in a class I'm writing to receive system messages with a TWndMethod and the messages I'm receiving need to handle a 4-byte WPARAM, which specifically references a pointer. But I'm only getting 2 bytes in return. How do I set up things so I can correctly receive these messages within the class? Edit: Specific code. I'm setting a message event up using SHChangeNotifyRegister, based on a Microsoft sample I downloaded. The proc works enough to pull back events (in lEvent) that I can buy off on, but the code Microsoft used defines WParam to be Thandle and LParam to be DWord. The specific problem I have is that when the function IsItemNotificationEvent is true, SHGetPathFromIDList is AVing or pulling back garbage. I kept looking this over and am not really seeing a problem other than what the docs I have indicate in that WParam is a Word (probably old) and that GetLastError at the point I put in the code returns "The handle is invalid". function IsItemNotificationevent(lEvent: Longint): boolean;
  var
    flagval: Longint;

    Result := (flagval > 0);

@TITLE:Converting PHP date formats [closed]
@CONTENT:I have a date that is currently formatted as 'y.m.d' and I need it formatted as 'D, M d, Y'. I've tried everything I can think of, but it always seems to get confused. Usually, a date that is listed as '11.11.27' comes out as 'Wed, Dec 31, 1969' somehow... Any thoughts as to why that happens (really? 1969??) or how to properly perform this conversion would be greatly appreciated.

@TITLE:Why do print_r and var_dump execute before echo
@CONTENT:I'm calling either var_dump() or print_r() on an array that has one value in an echo statement: echo "<br><br>testArray is ==> " . var_dump($testArray) . " <===<br><br>";
 Here is the actual output in the browser: array
0 => string '28' (length=2)


testArray is ==> <===
 This is a nuance I don't get. To me, the order of execution is: echo executes and displays testArray is ==> the call to var_dump executes and displays the array contents then the <== should execute Instead of seeing 1, 2 then 3 on the output, I'm seeing 2, 1, 3 in that order. This is one line of server-side code. What is this nuance?
@CODE:var_dump() print_r() echo echo "<br><br>testArray is ==> " . var_dump($testArray) . " <===<br><br>"; array
0 => string '28' (length=2)


testArray is ==> <=== testArray is ==> <== 2, 1, 3

@LINK:/questions/8364110/css-or-javascript-href-hover-or-mouseover-showing-additional-clickable-links
@TITLE:CSS or Javascript href hover (or mouseover) showing additional clickable links
@CONTENT:I have a need to present a user with various editing options when they hover over a link. I think I have seen it done somewhere, but I can't seem to find an example. I've built a quasi-example here, but it doesn't quite work right. Also, my example has me sort of cheating with margins of -45 just to get a working example. Here is a snapshot of how my code functions (code below). Here is a snapshot of how I would like it to function. The mouseover (or something similar) would result in: the bulleted item would change to a different image icon a set of icons would appear to edit, delete, etc. and these would be selectable/clickable in the white space to the right of the href link. the links would be of various lengths so I am trying not to use absolute positioning. I realize the second requirement might not be possible if it's based on a real hover or mouseover because once the user is no longer mousing-over or hovering-over the active link, the icons should disappear and would become unselectable. Is there someway to make the whole row (maybe the link plus 45 pixels next to it) remain hoverable/mouseover-able? I do not want the user to have to click to see the options. Is something like this possible with pure CSS? Or, is there a Javascript solution?     <head>

@CONTENT:So I'm completely new to MATLAB and I'm trying to understand colon notation within mathematical operations. So, in this book I found this statement: w(1:5)=j(1:5) + k(1:5);
 I do not understand what it really does. I know that w(1:5) is pretty much iterating through the w array from index 1 through 5, but in the statement above, shouldn't all indexes of w be equal to j(5) + k(5) in the end? Or am I completely wrong on how this works? It'd be awesome if someone posted the equivalent in Java to that up there. Thanks in advance :-)

@TITLE:jquery prevent default seems stuck on and requires additional click
@CONTENT:I'm writing a jquery plugin to display a jquery ui dialog when links are clicked to provide a confirmation dialog before the link is followed. The problem i'm having is that when closing the dialog using the "Yes" button, the plugin uses $(element).trigger( 'click' ); to fire the click event on the original anchor element. This does not cause the browser to follow the link, however a second click with my mouse after the dialog closes does work. The plugin is used like this $('a').submitConfirm(); Here is the plugin ;(function ( $, window, document, undefined )
{
    var pluginName = "submitConfirm";

    var Plugin = function( element )
    {
        var confirmed = false;

Currently, when the user submits any one of these forms, it updates (via ajax) a div on the same page with the content from the form that was just submitted. I also want to remove() the form element that was just submitted after the ajax post request is completed. However, I need to be able to access that specific form ID within the js.erb file to do so.

@TITLE:is_dir() returns FALSE when passed a subfolder
@CONTENT:is_dir() according to the php manual returns true if passed a string that refers to a folder. It's returning false -- despite being passed an array of valid folder names -- this is probably something simple but I'm beating myself up over not finding it. Here is the code: define('TEST_SUBFOLDERS_FILES_PATH', 'C:/xampp/htdocs/theProj/mainSubdir/');

$currentFolder = ' ';
$rootOfmainSubdir = TEST_SUBFOLDERS_FILES_PATH';
$theArrayOfDirsAndFilesInmainSubdir;

// fill an array that contains all files and folders under the /mainSubdir folder
// using php's 'scandir()'
if( ($theArrayOfDirsAndFilesInmainSubdir = scandir($rootOfmainSubdir )) != FALSE )
{
  $numArrayEntries = count($theArrayOfDirsAndFilesInmainSubdir);
  echo "<br><br>The number of folders/files found is:  " . $numArrayEntries;


  // now do the triage on subfolders under /mainSubdir  versus files
  for($i = 0; $i < $numArrayEntries; $i++)
  {
    echo "<br><br>Current array element is:  " 
            . $theArrayOfDirsAndFilesInmainSubdir[$i]
            . "  and is_dir() on this element returns --> "
            . var_dump( is_dir($theArrayOfDirsAndFilesInmainSubdir[$i]) );  
    // rest of code
 Here is what I see on the output for almost all the folders: Current array element is: testFolderN and is_dir() on this element returns -->

boolean false
 OR I see: Current array element is: . and is_dir() on this element returns -->

boolean true
 AND: Current array element is: .. and is_dir() on this element returns -->

boolean true
 I'm missing something really dumb here but sheesh. It seems that is_dir() is correctly returning TRUE only for the current folder "." and the parent folder ".." If there is a nuance I'm missing in the use of is_dir() I'm not seeing it. Help is appreciated -- all I'm going to do in the code is to make a list of the current subfolders under the TEST_SUBFOLDERS_FILES_PATH if I can get is_dir() to return TRUE not only for "." and ".." but also the other 'testFolderN' subfolders. By the way -- there is a total of 5 subfolders, and one file in the directory, so the display of the count above is: The number of folders/files found is: 8
@CODE:define('TEST_SUBFOLDERS_FILES_PATH', 'C:/xampp/htdocs/theProj/mainSubdir/');

$currentFolder = ' ';
$rootOfmainSubdir = TEST_SUBFOLDERS_FILES_PATH';
$theArrayOfDirsAndFilesInmainSubdir;

@TITLE:URLOpen error during Web Service communication
@CONTENT:I had to developed an application which will communicate with a Web service via python. I have to run this code on a Windows server machine for some reasons (which i am not much experianced with, notmally we use uint based systems). My communication with the api provider is not directly because of some communication issies. So i have to mail my problems to another person and he email them my message in the native language, so i could not get much support from the provider because of that. My problem is, i use suds for web service client. Cleint semmed to succeed to get WSDL definition from the serveer like: from suds.client import Client

class SomeClass(Client):
    def __init__(self):
        Client.__init__(url)

def myFunc():
    f = SomeClass()
    print f
 Service ( transport ) tns="..." Prefixes (1) ns0 = .... Ports (2):

    (TransportSoap) 

         Methods (4) 

             GetBalance()
 ... So i can see that suds can reach target web service and get the WSDL file. However when i call a method like: def myFunc():
    f = SomeClass()    
    f.GetBalance()


Urllib2.URLError <urlopen error [Errno 10060] A connection attempt
failed because the connected party did not properly respond after a

 I could not see what is wrong?

@TITLE:Symfony2 - KnpMenuBundle: Fatal exception in service container
@CONTENT:I'm using the KnpMenuBundle in my application, and I have followed their instructions to set up my menu as a service. Whenever I try to render the menu using the twig helper function {{ knp_menu_render('VhotoHelperBundle:MenuBuilder:mainMenu') }} It gives me the following error... An exception has been thrown during the rendering of a template ("Catchable Fatal Error: Argument 1 passed to Vhoto\HelperBundle\Menu\MenuBuilder::__construct() must implement interface Knp\Menu\FactoryInterface, none given My services.yml file is present in my bundle's Resources/config directory, and has the following contents: services:
  vhoto.menu_builder:
    class: Vhoto\HelperBundle\Menu\MenuBuilder
    arguments: ["@knp_menu.factory"]

    factory_method: createMainMenu
    arguments: ["@request"]
    scope: request
    tags:
      - { name: knp_menu.menu, alias: main }
 I have created an extension class in my bundle's DependencyInjection directory: class VhotoHelperExtension extends Extension
{
    public function load(array $config, ContainerBuilder $container)
    {
        $loader = new YamlFileLoader($container, new FileLocator(__DIR__.'/../Resources/config'));
        $loader->load('services.yml');
    }
}
 And have updated my bundle's build method to register the extension: public function build(ContainerBuilder $container)
{
    parent::build($container);
    $container->registerExtension(new VhotoHelperExtension());
}
 What I can't figure out is why my arguments: ["@knp_menu.factory"] config isn't taking effect, am I missing something in the extension class? I read the chapter on Exposing Semantic Configuration for bundles but it didn't shed any light. EDIT: Okay, just realised that I don't need to manually register my extension in my bundle class. Removed that code from my app now but still getting the same exception.

@TITLE:Is there an easy way to add multiple javascript images together via `imgCounter.src =`
@CONTENT:In photoshop I created images 0.png thru 9.png and know I can change each digit to simulate a counter by changing each picture of each digit as it counts down. IDEA 1: One way I thought would be to have multiple lines of HTML: <div align="right"><img src="graphics/odometers/1.png" /id="digit1">
                   <img src="graphics/odometers/2.png" /id="digit2">
                   <img src="graphics/odometers/3.png" /id="digit3"></div>
 JAVASCRIPT: var imgCounter = document.getElementById('digit1');
imgCounter.src = "graphics/odometers/white and blue with black background/1.png"; // shows the digit 1
var imgCounter = document.getElementById('digit2');
imgCounter.src = "graphics/odometers/white and blue with black background/2.png"; // shows the digit 2
// etc for as many digits as I want to show
 and change the digits in javascript by each ID. It's not hard but for flexibility can I have 1 image ID and string 3 .png's together in javascript? Like this... IDEA 2: Not sure if this is possible. HTML: <div align="right"><img src="" /id="formtimer"></div>
 JAVASCRIPT: // somehow show 3 graphics in a row 123 without having 3 ID tags, only 1 ID tag
var imgCounter = document.getElementById('formtimer');
imgCounter.src = "graphics/odometers/white and blue with black background/1.png";
 I know the example above only shows the digit 1 and doesn't do all 3 digits... (because I don't know if it's possible). Is there a way to display 3 pictures together? lol. Easily? I know anything can technically be done the hard way... If it's a big pain in the butt I'm ok with IDEA 1 but it's less "freedom" because I have to encode the HTML with multiple ID tags which is tedius... Just curious what you all think and if you have a solution. :) Much appreciated. ALSO: Is it ok to leave the img src="" as a NULL or empty string if I'll later be sticking an image in via javascript?
@CODE:<div align="right"><img src="graphics/odometers/1.png" /id="digit1">
                   <img src="graphics/odometers/2.png" /id="digit2">
                   <img src="graphics/odometers/3.png" /id="digit3"></div> var imgCounter = document.getElementById('digit1');
imgCounter.src = "graphics/odometers/white and blue with black background/1.png"; // shows the digit 1
var imgCounter = document.getElementById('digit2');

@TITLE:CKEditor submitting empty content to the form.
@CONTENT:I've started using CKEditor v3 few weeks ago.using it in a php project.i've been using it with jquery (using jquery adapter) and all this while using $.ajax (because can't handle for errors when using jquery form) to submit and i thought everything was alright . So here pops up a case where i need to use normal form mechanism to submit the ckeditor content and all the other information of the form. To my surprise the content was empty so i started google and apparently it's a known issue. i haven't seen any thing YET that could let me post my content to php side. so i've come up with a workaround. I know onclick will always fire before the onsubmit so i've written this. function returntoSubmit(){
    myForm = document.forms[0];
    myForm.elements["content"].value = $("#content").val();// note that the textarea name and id are all the same "content"

}

// html here 
 <input type="submit" value="Save" onclick="returntoSubmit()" />
 that does the work for me.But truly and a little uncomfortable with this, isn't there any better method to solve this issue? Thanks
@CODE:function returntoSubmit(){
    myForm = document.forms[0];
    myForm.elements["content"].value = $("#content").val();// note that the textarea name and id are all the same "content"

@CONTENT:How to solve this using scala Actors: I have a program that finds out the frequencies of identifiers in files under a given path. The encoding assumed is UTF-8. I want to solve the same problem with scala actors. //program to find frequencies of identifiers
import java.io._
import java.util.concurrent._
import java.util.concurrent.atomic._

object Main {
  // visit all files in dir
  def processDirectory(dir: File, visit: (File) => Unit) {
    for (f <- dir.listFiles) 
      if (f.isDirectory) processDirectory(f, visit)
      else visit(f)
  }

  //counters for all identifiers
  val frequencies = new scala.collection.mutable.HashMap[String, Int]

  // Finds all identifiers in a file and increments their counters
  def process(f: File) {
    val contents = scala.io.Source.fromFile(f, "UTF-8").mkString
    val pattern = "[a-zA-Z_][0-9a-zA-Z_]*".r
    for (m <- pattern.findAllIn(contents))
      frequencies(m) = frequencies.getOrElse(m, 0) + 1
  }

  def main(args: Array[String]) {   //Give path of a directory here
    processDirectory(new File(args(0)), process _)

    println("Ten most common identifiers:")
    val sorted = frequencies.values.toBuffer.sortWith(_ > _)
    for (i <- 0 until 10)      
      for ((k, v) <- frequencies) 
        if (v == sorted(i)) println(k + " " + v)
  }
}
 Also please explain the concept of scala actors. I am confused about scala actors.

@TITLE:Checking for a range in Powershell
@CONTENT:I'm trying to write a script that will get an IP address of a computer and check to see whether it falls in a specific range of IPs. So for example, if the IP of the machine is 192.168.0.5, the script will check to see if it falls between the range 192.168.0.10 to 192.168.0.20. So far, my script is only able to get IPs of remote machines, but I just can't figure out how I would check if the IP is in a specific range. I'd appreciate any suggestions. Thank you.

@TITLE:Getting WPARAM in TWndMethod to return 4 bytes
@CONTENT:I'm using AllocateHWnd in a class I'm writing to receive system messages with a TWndMethod and the messages I'm receiving need to handle a 4-byte WPARAM, which specifically references a pointer. But I'm only getting 2 bytes in return. How do I set up things so I can correctly receive these messages within the class? Edit: Specific code. I'm setting a message event up using SHChangeNotifyRegister, based on a Microsoft sample I downloaded. The proc works enough to pull back events (in lEvent) that I can buy off on, but the code Microsoft used defines WParam to be Thandle and LParam to be DWord. The specific problem I have is that when the function IsItemNotificationEvent is true, SHGetPathFromIDList is AVing or pulling back garbage. I kept looking this over and am not really seeing a problem other than what the docs I have indicate in that WParam is a Word (probably old) and that GetLastError at the point I put in the code returns "The handle is invalid". function IsItemNotificationevent(lEvent: Longint): boolean;
  var
    flagval: Longint;

            or SHCNE_DRIVEADDGUI or SHCNE_SERVERDISCONNECT));

It returns the json just fine in the browser and returns a 200 status in Charles web debug proxy, but in the GWT app it always says the response status is 0 and doesn't give me any json. When I test my code on a known working URL, it returns 200 and I get the json I expect. Also, I already have header('Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8'); in my php, which I know is a common error. Is there any reason this would not be working?

 Here is the actual output in the browser: array
0 => string '28' (length=2)


testArray is ==> <===
 This is a nuance I don't get. To me, the order of execution is: echo executes and displays testArray is ==> the call to var_dump executes and displays the array contents then the <== should execute Instead of seeing 1, 2 then 3 on the output, I'm seeing 2, 1, 3 in that order. This is one line of server-side code. What is this nuance?

@TITLE:CSS or Javascript href hover (or mouseover) showing additional clickable links
@CONTENT:I have a need to present a user with various editing options when they hover over a link. I think I have seen it done somewhere, but I can't seem to find an example. I've built a quasi-example here, but it doesn't quite work right. Also, my example has me sort of cheating with margins of -45 just to get a working example. Here is a snapshot of how my code functions (code below). Here is a snapshot of how I would like it to function. The mouseover (or something similar) would result in: the bulleted item would change to a different image icon a set of icons would appear to edit, delete, etc. and these would be selectable/clickable in the white space to the right of the href link. the links would be of various lengths so I am trying not to use absolute positioning. I realize the second requirement might not be possible if it's based on a real hover or mouseover because once the user is no longer mousing-over or hovering-over the active link, the icons should disappear and would become unselectable. Is there someway to make the whole row (maybe the link plus 45 pixels next to it) remain hoverable/mouseover-able? I do not want the user to have to click to see the options. Is something like this possible with pure CSS? Or, is there a Javascript solution?     <head>

@TITLE:Default value of tabBarController.selectedViewController?
@CONTENT:In my iOS app I have a tabBarController with a few navigationControllers. In applicationDidFinishLaunching tabBarController.selectedViewController is null. This is after I assign the navigationControllers to the tabBar's tabBarItems. What is an appropriate default value for tabBarController.selectedViewController? Perhaps it can be set to the first navigationController. Might need to be careful of the app launching from the background (in which case the user might not have left off at the first navigationController).

@CONTENT:For some odd reasons, I am unable to get the developerPayload. I'm using the Dungeons Example. I have seen this work before, I think the payload string should appear in the Recent Activity. As far as I know, it should work if I'm using an actual product ID (like, potion_001). The whole purchasing works very well, but alas, the developerPayload is not there. I have barely made an edit with the Dungeons sample apart from renaming the package name. I did try to edit the intent actions, though:     public static final String ACTION_CONFIRM_NOTIFICATION =
        "com.blah.something.dungeons.en.CONFIRM_NOTIFICATION";
    public static final String ACTION_GET_PURCHASE_INFORMATION =

    public static final String ACTION_RESTORE_TRANSACTIONS =
        "com.blah.something.dungeons.en.RESTORE_TRANSACTIONS";
 It still didn't work. I have been re-reading the in-app billing docs, but I'm not sure if I'm missing something here. Is there something that I may have missed, or misconfigured in the android market options and/or the dungeons sample?

@CONTENT:i am customizing the pie chart given on the raphael site below link http://raphaeljs.com/pie.html this chart shows animation when hover a slice, this animation simply expand the slice a little what i want is to separate the slice from the chart i played with the transform property of following lines of code but could not make it as i want. p.mouseover(function () {

 Changing the line 3's cx and cy actually fixed the animation for every slice in the same manner, that is, on hover every slice will change the position constantly. anyone please help me out to solve this problem

@TITLE:How can I check if an instance of a Access 2010 form is still open?
@CONTENT:Preface I have a need to create multiple copies of a search form (in Access 2010) that returns a value to the calling (which is also the form that created the instance of the form). As mentioned these forms could and will have multiple copies running at the same time for example a user could want to add a company to something so they: Click "select company" and open an instance of the company search screen Then open the company editor (leaving the original company search/selection screen open) as they notice the company has a parent company that hasn't been added yet. They then click the "Select Parent Company" button that opens ANOTHER instance of the search and select screen They find the parent company Select it which closes the second search screen and the parent company is added to the first company. The user then selects the modified company using the original search screen which again closes the original search screen and returns the selected company to what ever form they originally initialised the first search... This all allows the users to update and correct data as and when they find error which reduces the likelihood of them forgetting and makes it much quicker! MOST of this is fine now but I have had a lot of problems with instances of a form not being able to open as a "acDialog" thus stopping the calling code running until the search was done (see this question for more info) and the solution I have gone with is to simulate the pausing of the calling code by using a endless loop and checking if the search screen instant is still visible. Then when the user selects something on the search screen instant it puts the value in a hidden field in the search screen and hides it's self (not closed). The calling function then sees it's hidden grabs the value from the hidden field and unloads the instant. Problem I can check if the form is hidden using FormInstant.Visable but if the user closes the form this causes an error and the code I would normally use to check if the form exists requires a form name and as it's an instant of a form all the forms have the same name! I do have a reference to the form as it is stored in a local "form" object... The code I would normally use is: CurrentProject.AllForms("FormName").IsLoaded
 So how can I check for a instant of a form being loaded still?

@TITLE:How to stop a streaming mp3-file
@CONTENT:I have build an app that use mp3-files. In the first version the files was included in the apk-file. I now are working on a version that have the mp3-files in an URL-resource. I have adjust the code and almost everything works fine. The problem is that the buttons for stop, pause and play now not is working. This is the code that start the streaming (works fine): private void playAudio(String media) {
    MediaPlayer mediaPlayer = new MediaPlayer();
    mediaPlayer.setAudioStreamType(AudioManager.STREAM_MUSIC);

    try {
        mediaPlayer.setDataSource(media);
        mediaPlayer.prepare(); // might take long! (for buffering, etc)
        mediaPlayer.start();

    } catch (Exception e) {
        Log.e(TAG, "error: " + e.getMessage(), e);
    }
    mediaPlayer.setOnCompletionListener(new OnCompletionListener() {
        public void onCompletion(MediaPlayer arg0) {
            finish();
        }
    });

}
 And this is the functions I use for stopping etc. Worked fine with local file (raw-resources) But now it is not working:     @Override
public boolean onKeyDown(int keyCode, KeyEvent event) {
    if (keyCode == KeyEvent.KEYCODE_BACK && event.getRepeatCount() == 0) {
        Intent intent = new Intent(SpelaSaga.this, VisaIngressSaga.class);
        Bundle bundle = new Bundle();
        bundle.putString("Titel", titel);
        bundle.putInt("Position", position);
        intent.putExtras(bundle);
        SpelaSaga.this.startActivity(intent);
        finish();
        return true;
    }

    return super.onKeyDown(keyCode, event);
}

private OnClickListener button_1Listener = new OnClickListener() {
    @Override
    public void onClick(View v) {
        mediaPlayer.stop();
        Intent intent = new Intent(SpelaSaga.this, VisaIngressSaga.class);
        Bundle bundle = new Bundle();
        bundle.putString("Titel", titel);

    }
};

private OnClickListener button_2Listener = new OnClickListener() {
    @Override
    public void onClick(View v) {
        mediaPlayer.pause();

    }
};

@TITLE:Handling sessions in JSF while working with socialauth API, for login
@CONTENT:I have been working with social auth API in JSF, for getting an login with facebook, I dont know whether am creating a session properly. I have searched some stuffs form internet and doing it. Now i have caught up with some error. according to social auth first we need to call a function, which helps to get the authentication URL from the Facebook, where i need to create a session and and set attributes to it, with the parameters from facebook once user logs in into the facebook. so my first view page will just contain, a command button to call the respective function.             <h:form><h:commandButton value="submit" action="#{socialNetworkAuthentication.facebookAuthentication}"></h:commandButton></h:form>
 then the function which is called ...                  public String facebookAuthentication(){

    try{


           //Create an instance of SocialAuthConfgi object
           SocialAuthConfig config = SocialAuthConfig.getDefault();

 String propUrl="oauth_consumer.properties";


          //load configuration. By default load the configuration from oauth_consumer.properties.
          //You can also pass input stream, properties object or properties file name.
           config.load(propUrl);

          //Create an instance of SocialAuthManager and set config
          SocialAuthManager manager = new SocialAuthManager();
          manager.setSocialAuthConfig(config);

          //URL of YOUR application which will be called after authentication
           String successUrl = "http://chennaivolunteers.com/ChennaiVolunteers/faces/cv/employee-profile.xhtml";


        // get Provider URL to which you should redirect for authentication.
          // id can have values "facebook", "twitter", "yahoo" etc. or the OpenID URL
          String url = manager.getAuthenticationUrl("facebook", successUrl);

          // Store in session
          HttpServletRequest request=(HttpServletRequest) FacesContext.getCurrentInstance().getExternalContext().getRequest();
            HttpSession ses = request.getSession(true);

          ses.setAttribute("authManager", manager);
          System.out.println(url);
          FacesContext.getCurrentInstance().responseComplete();
       FacesContext.getCurrentInstance().getExternalContext().redirect(url);

        }
 then finally i redirect to the respective URL given by the facebook, after user logs in into the facebook, then it automatically moves to the succesURL which is was mentioned in the above code. In my successURL i just have an outputtext.                           <tr><td class="profile-head"><h:outputText id="name" value="#{employeeProfile.profileName}" /></td></tr>
            <tr><td class="content-black">
            <div class="padding-2"><h:outputText id="name" value="#{employeeProfile.profileName}" />
 In the backing bean, i created a session to get the attributes which i set earlier.                   public class EmployeeProfile {

public String profileName;

public String getProfileName() throws Exception  {

HttpServletRequest request=(HttpServletRequest) FacesContext.getCurrentInstance().getExternalContext().getRequest();
    HttpSession ses = request.getSession(true);
    SocialAuthManager m = (SocialAuthManager)ses.getAttribute("authManager");        
    AuthProvider provider = m.connect(SocialAuthUtil.getRequestParametersMap(request));
    Profile p = provider.getUserProfile();
      String userName=p.getFirstName();
      System.out.println(userName);

    return userName;

}

public void setProfileName(String profileName) {
    this.profileName = profileName;
}
 when i printed the username in console it does, but its not the view page of this backing bean, have caught up with two exceptions as below.              1.  javax.faces.FacesException: Could not retrieve value of component with path : {Component-Path : [Class: javax.faces.component.UIViewRoot,ViewId: /cv/employee-profile.xhtml][Class: javax.faces.component.html.HtmlOutputText,Id: name]}

            2.javax.faces.FacesException: This is not the same SocailAuthManager object that was used for login.Please check if you have called getAuthenticationUrl() method before calling connect()
              Caused by: This is not the same SocailAuthManager object that was used for login.Please check if you have called getAuthenticationUrl() method before calling connect()
 Last one is just an inbuilt exception of social auth API, But i dont think any problem in this, because when i try it out with servlet, everything works fine, i think am doing some mistake in JSF session. But i dont know wher i am wrong.

@TITLE:How to share data between Drools rules in a map?
@CONTENT:I have a rule which accepts Map() as a fact and then sets lots of elements to this map. I want to be able to use this map somewhere else when executing other rules. I read about globals in Drools but seems like they should not be used for this purpose. Right now I keep this map as private property in Java class, so that it can keep all data in web application context, but this increases my memory footprint. I know it might sound bizarre but is there any analogy in Drools rules to Java static fields? Thanks in advance!

 Then I have my main window for which I set the datacontext as : DataContext="{Binding Source={x:Static vm:ViewModelLocator.MainStatic}}" Inside my main window I have a list box which will have as ItemSource a collection of ProductViewModel define as follow :  public class ProductViewModel : ViewModelBase
{

     SvcProduct.ProductServiceClient _clientSvc =new SvcProduct.ProductServiceClient() ;
     ObservableCollection<Product> _products = new ObservableCollection<Product>();


     public ObservableCollection<Product> Products
     {
         get { return _products; }
         set { _products = value; }
     }

    /// <summary>
    /// Initializes a new instance of the ProductViewModel class.
    /// </summary>
    public ProductViewModel()
    {
        ////if (IsInDesignMode)
        ////{
        ////    // Code runs in Blend --> create design time data.
        ////}
        ////else
        ////{
        ////    // Code runs "for real": Connect to service, etc...
        ////}
        _products=_clientSvc.GetProducts();

    }

    ////public override void Cleanup()
    ////{
    ////    // Clean own resources if needed

    ////    base.Cleanup();
    ////}
}
 ProductViewModel return in Products the collection for the listbox. Each item in the list box is connected to a ProductView which is a userControl define as follow : <UserControl

 As you can see the above the DataContext is set to ViewModelLocator.ProductStatic but it says an error like "Cannot create instance of ViewModelLocator" Due to that it seems that the binding is not operating as my list box is empty on my main Window 1- Any idea what I do wrong for that error? 2- In my scenario, how should I bind the ItemSource as the collection is a collection of ProductViewModel ? regards serge

@TITLE:Transferring a list of a list to a 2D array
@CONTENT:Ok, so i'm trying to get a 2D array to serialize in an xml file and then be able to load it. The main part works but I have found (possibly false) that you can't use a 2d array in the content pipeline readers and writers. I have replaced the 2d array with a List<List<string>> but I still need the data as a 2d array. This is what I have so far but it throws an null reference exception: TILArray = new string[Width, Height];// I do initialize the array

for (int x = 0; x < Width; x++)
{
    for (int y = 0; y < Height; y++)
    {
        if (TILList[x][y] != null)
        {
            Tiles[x, y] = Content.Load<Tile>(TILList[x][y]);
            TILArray[x, y] = TILList[x][y];// This line throws the exception
        }
    }
}
 Should it be giving me a null reference exception if I'm trying to assign to it? Also if anyone knows how to use 2d arrays directly in the content pipeline reader and writer i'd appreciate it Edit: The exception: An unhandled exception of type 'System.NullReferenceException' occurred in TileEngine.dll

Additional information: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.
 Edit: Well I've kept testing it and it seems that it only throws the exception when it's in the loop. When I try to set TILArray[0,0] outside the loop it works fine, but in the loop it doesn't work and throws the exception. Edit: WOW, I just found that if I move the line that throws the exception above this line: Tiles[x, y] = Content.Load<Tile>(TILList[x][y]);
 It says the exception was thrown in the line that contains only a }! EDIT: I've done some more tests and have found that THE PROBLEM IS NOT WITH COPYING TO THE ARRAY. when I comment out the line that threw the exception it still throws it! Is there anything that would cause the game to throw a NullReference exception from a line where there isn't even any code?
@CODE:List<List<string>> TILArray = new string[Width, Height];// I do initialize the array

 This logical code gives deadlock situation every time. Actually, when it runs, just execute print statement of routine 1 (statement between * marks) manytimes (though my print statement is only one) and gives deadlock error. Can anybody inform me what is wrong with the code logic. Thanks. NB. For more info, code can be found here, http://play.golang.org/p/pW6aXryUaK, where only line number 290 is executing. The original code which contains no error, can be found here play.golang.org/p/UL3rj8DJRk. I just add lock and unlock to them. Thanks. I want to add another point: in the code of play.golang.org/p/UL3rj8DJRk, you can find outputs of various print statements like this: process [number] sends [int] to process [number] at [time nano seconds]. However, as the result of three concurrent routines, sometimes the print statement is not executing properly (means not printing whole, there is some thing inserted by another print like process [number] sends [int] to process [number] at process [number]). Can any body help me how to manage this ?

@TITLE:Project Euler #3, infinite loop on factorization
@CONTENT:So I'm doing Project Euler because dear gods do I need to practice writing code, and also my math skills are rusty as something very rusty. Thusly; Project Euler. I'm sure most here have already seen or heard of the problem, but I'll put it here just for completeness: The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29. What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ? For this, I've written two functions: from math import sqrt

def isprime(n):
    if n == 1:
        return False
    elif n == 2:
        return True
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    for x in range(3, round(sqrt(n))+1, 2):
        if n % x == 0:
            return False
    else:
        return True
 This just checks any fed number for primality. It's working as intended (as far as I know), but now that I've said that I grow unsure. Anyway, it checks for special cases first: 1 (never prime), 2 (prime) or if it's divisible by 2 (not prime). If none of the special cases happen, it runs a general primality test. This is my factorization code: def factorization(n):
   factor = 2
   x = 3
   while True:
       if n % x == 0:
           if isprime(x):
               factor = x
               n = n // x
               if n == 1:
                   return factor
           else:
               return factor
       x += 2
 And this is definitely not working as intended. It is, sadly, working for the particular value of the Project Euler problem, but it doesn't work for, say, 100. I'm unsure what I need to do to fix this: what happens is that if it's a number like 100, it will correctly find the first 5 (2*2*5), but after that will loop around and set x = 7, which will make the entire thing loop infinitely because the answer is 2*2*5*5. Would recursion help here? I tried it, but it didn't get any prettier (it would still go into an endless loop for some numbers). I'm unsure how to solve this now.
@CODE:from math import sqrt

    if n == 1:
        return False
    elif n == 2:
        return True

        return False

@TITLE:After calling DebugBreakProcess() - What does the event's dwThreadId represents?
@CONTENT:Let's say some process debugs another process (by calling DebugActiveProcess()). Then some other process/thread generates break-points exceptions at that debugged process (by calling DebugBreakProcess()). The debugger then receives this EXCEPTION_DEBUG_EVENT->EXCEPTION_BREAKPOINT event and in the DEBUG_EVENT structure the field dwThreadId will hold some ID. My root question is - What does this dwThreadId represents? (MSDN says it is "The identifier of the thread in which the debugging event occurred"). My concerns are of the following: What does it mean "in which the debugging event occurred"? Isn't it that all the threads of the process are somehow signaled this way and therefor the process is entirely blocked? Moreover, from stuff I read, this mechanism works something like this: The DebugBreakProcess() API works by creating a thread in the target process that invokes a breakpoint instruction, which causes the normal SEH mechanism to take over. Which means there's a possibility that this dwThreadId is actually the ID of this newly created thread and not an ID of any of the original process' threads. Am i correct? What if the debugged process is multi-threaded (actually it is almost certain it is)? Is this the ID of the thread that was "in the processor" at the moment of calling the DebugBreakProcess() API? UPDATE: all this block was answered. See the first answer. What about the case of a dual-core system and two threads of the same process are currently running in parallel? Which one will win and will be stated in this ID? Or maybe it will cause two different EXCEPTION_BREAKPOINT exceptions? Thank you very much for any help that is provided.

@TITLE:Implementing the CLR into old MFC/Win32 DLL and hosting DLL into MFC/Win32 Application
@CONTENT:I have an old MFC application which I currently import an old MFC/Win32 DLL into. In this old DLL, I have been tasked with writing a bunch of Multi-Threaded code which I was planning on writing using the .NET framework (hence needing the CLR). I've made cracks at this before, and even if I can get the project to compile properly with the CLR, I find that as soon as I try to use the DLL's user interface (written in MFC) after loading the DLL into the MFC/Win32 application, the application will crash pointing to problems with the user interface. This DLL has always worked without the CLR, so I know that it is not broken. What is the best way of implementing the CLR in my project, even if it is only for one class? EDIT: I currently can get the code to build with the CLR only on the one class I need it in, but the application I load the DLL into still crashes upon trying to load the user interface contained in the DLL. EDIT2: I have figured out that it is failing an assertion on afxCurrentResourceHandle in afxwin1.inl. After doing more reading, I have a feeling that this has to do with MFC being in a "shared DLL" instead of "static DLL." Is there a workaround for this assertion? _AFXWIN_INLINE HINSTANCE AFXAPI AfxGetResourceHandle()
    { ASSERT(afxCurrentResourceHandle != NULL);
        return afxCurrentResourceHandle; }
 EDIT3: I have made progress, but am still failing assertions! Apparently before you create the objects of the pages within the user interface, you must use the AFX_MANAGE_STATE macro to have afxCurrentResourceHandle be defined! Here's an example of what I mean: CPropertySheet Sheet("Config"); //Assume this is defined
AFX_MANAGE_STATE(AfxGetStaticModuleStatus());

CConfigPage ConfigPage;
CTestPage TestPage;

//Now I am failing an assertion when trying to run the following code
if (Sheet.DoModal() == ID_OK)
{
    //Do stuff...
}
 The assertion currently failing now is: CObject* AFX_CDECL AfxStaticDownCast(CRunTimeClass* pClass, CObject* pObject)
{
    ASSERT(pObject == NULL || pObject->IsKindOf(pClass));
    return pObject
}
 pObject certainly isn't null: pObject: 0x043fd4fc {CWnd hWnd=0x002c0abe}

 If I make a duplicated form, what I need to change in the HTML code is the following: action="contact.php" name="contactform"    
id="contactform"
 to: action="contact2.php" name="contactform2"    
id="contactform2"
 Is this correct? Anything else I need to change in the HTML? Moving onto the Javascript: jQuery(document).ready(function(){

$('#contactform').submit(function(){

    var action = $(this).attr('action');

    $('#submit').attr('disabled','disabled').after('<img src="assets/ajax-
loader.gif" class="loader" />');

    $("#message").slideUp(750,function() {
    $('#message').hide();

    $.post(action, {
        name: $('#name').val(),
        email: $('#email').val(),
        phone: $('#phone').val(),
        dayin: $('#dayin').val(),
        dayout: $('#dayout').val(),
        comments: $('#comments').val(),
        verify: $('#verify').val()
    },
        function(data){
            document.getElementById('message').innerHTML = data;
            $('#message').slideDown('slow');
            $('#contactform img.loader').fadeOut('fast',function()
{$(this).remove()});
            $('#submit').removeAttr('disabled');
            if(data.match('success') != null);
            $("#message").show().delay(5000).fadeOut();

        }
    );

    });
 Do I need to make the field ID's different duplicating a form on the same page? EG: $.post(action, {
        name2: $('#name2').val(),
        email2: $('#email2').val(),
        phone2: $('#phone2').val(),
        dayin2: $('#dayin2').val(),
        dayout2: $('#dayout2').val(),
        comments2: $('#comments2').val(),
        verify2: $('#verify2').val()
    },
 Do I need to do any changes to the PHP process form? Here is the main part of the php process form: $name    = $_POST['name'];
$email  = $_POST['email'];
$phone  = $_POST['phone'];
$dayin  = $_POST['dayin'];
$dayout = $_POST['dayout'];
$comments = $_POST['comments'];

if (isset($_POST['verify'])) :
    $posted_verify   = $_POST['verify'];
    $posted_verify   = md5($posted_verify);
else :
    $posted_verify = '';
endif;

// Important Variables
$session_verify = $_SESSION['verify'];

if (empty($session_verify)) $session_verify = $_COOKIE['verify'];

$error = '';

    if(trim($name) == '') {
        $error .= '<li>Your name is required.</li>';
    }

    if(trim($email) == '') {
        $error .= '<li>Your e-mail address is required.</li>';
    } elseif(!isEmail($email)) {
        $error .= '<li>You have entered an invalid e-mail address.</li>';
    }

    if(trim($phone) == '') {
        $error .= '<li>Your phone number is required.</li>';
    } elseif(!is_numeric($phone)) {
        $error .= '<li>Your phone number can only contain digits.</li>';
    }

    if(trim($comments) == '') {
        $error .= '<li>You must enter a message to send.</li>';
    }

    if($session_verify != $posted_verify) {
        $error .= '<li>The verification code you entered is incorrect.
</li>';
    }

    if($error != '') {
        echo '<div class="error_message">Attention! Please correct the 
 errors below and try again.';
        echo '<ul class="error_messages">' . $error . '</ul>';
        echo '</div>';

    } else {

    if(get_magic_quotes_gpc()) { $comments = stripslashes($comments); }

     // Advanced Configuration Option.
     // i.e. The standard subject will appear as, "You've been contacted by 
John Doe."

     $e_subject = 'You\'ve been contacted by ' . $name . '.';

     // Advanced Configuration Option.
     // You can change this if you feel that you need to.
     // Developers, you may wish to add more fields to the form, in which case 
you must be sure to add them here.

        $twitter_msg = $name . " - " . $comments . ". You can contact " .

        twittermessage($twitter_user, $twitter_msg, $consumer_key, 
$consumer_secret, $token, $secret);

    }

    $msg = wordwrap( $msg, 70 );

    $headers = "From: $email" . PHP_EOL;
    $headers .= "Reply-To: $email" . PHP_EOL;
    $headers .= "MIME-Version: 1.0" . PHP_EOL;
    $headers .= "Content-type: text/plain; charset=utf-8" . PHP_EOL;
    $headers .= "Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable" . PHP_EOL;

    if(mail($address, $e_subject, $msg, $headers)) {

     echo "<fieldset>";
     echo "<div id='success_page'>";
     echo "<strong>Email Sent Successfully.</strong>";
     echo "</div>";
     echo "</fieldset>";

     } else {

     echo 'ERROR!'; // Dont Edit.

@LINK:/questions/8347491/entity-model-not-being-updated-on-savechanges
@TITLE:Entity Model Not Being Updated on SaveChanges
@CONTENT:I have a misunderstanding somewhere with the Entity Framework. This code is from my unit testing: Public Sub UpdateRosterLinkTest()
    Dim target As PlayerAdmin = New PlayerAdmin()

    target.PlayerAdminManager = playerAdminTestManager
    target.Team = playerAdminTestManager.GetAirForceMensBB()

    playerAdminTestManager.resetRosterLink(target)
    Assert.IsNull(target.Team.RosterLink)

    Dim playerAdmin As PlayerAdmin = New PlayerAdmin()
    playerAdmin.TeamId = 12434
    playerAdmin.RosterLink = "Roster Link"

    playerAdmin.UpdateRosterLink()

    Dim team As DAL.Team = playerAdminTestManager.GetAirForceMensBB()
    Assert.AreEqual("Roster Link", team.RosterLink)

End Sub
 I'm creating a PlayerAdmin, which is a model class. target.Team is an Entity object. What I do is reset the RosterLink field in the Team just to make sure our test starts out at the same place. Then I call the UpdateRosterLink() function. That looks like: Function UpdateRosterLink() As Integer
        If (PlayerAdminManager Is Nothing) Then
            PlayerAdminManager = New PlayerAdminManager()
        End If

        Team = PlayerAdminManager.GetTeamByTeamId(TeamId)
        Team.RosterLink = RosterLink
        Dim numberOfChanges As Integer = PlayerAdminManager.SaveChanges()
        Return numberOfChanges
    End Function
 When I run this code, I can see the changes saved to the SQL Server this pulls from (RosterLink = Roster Link, like I set in the unit test). However, my unit test is failing, because team.RosterLink is still Nothing. The function GetAirForceMensBB() returns the Team with TeamId = 12434: Function GetAirForceMensBB() As DAL.Team
    Return (From team In Container.Teams Where team.TeamId = 12434).SingleOrDefault
End Function
 I'm sure I'm using the entity framework incorrectly and it probably has something to do with the fact that I am calling the PlayerAdminTestManager in different places, but I don't understand why. Although, I set the PlayerAdminManager to be the PlayerAdminTestManager. PlayerAdminTestManager extends PlayerAdminManager, fyi. Why is team.RosterLink not showing the update from UpdateRosterLink? Thanks EDIT Container is my ObjectContext. This is how I access the information stored in the database. Container.Teams represents my Teams table.
@CODE:Public Sub UpdateRosterLinkTest()
    Dim target As PlayerAdmin = New PlayerAdmin()

    target.PlayerAdminManager = playerAdminTestManager
    target.Team = playerAdminTestManager.GetAirForceMensBB()

    playerAdminTestManager.resetRosterLink(target)
    Assert.IsNull(target.Team.RosterLink)

    Dim playerAdmin As PlayerAdmin = New PlayerAdmin()
    playerAdmin.TeamId = 12434
    playerAdmin.RosterLink = "Roster Link"

    playerAdmin.UpdateRosterLink()

    Dim team As DAL.Team = playerAdminTestManager.GetAirForceMensBB()
    Assert.AreEqual("Roster Link", team.RosterLink)

End Sub PlayerAdmin target.Team RosterLink Team UpdateRosterLink() Function UpdateRosterLink() As Integer

@TITLE:Need clarification about mapping objects to database, annotations, and one to many relationships
@CONTENT:Need some help understanding if I'm on the right track here and exactly what I need to do. Hope someone can chime in. So I've got three tables, Job, Authorization, and Filter. Each Job must have one Authorization and one Filter. Of course, each Filter could be used by more than one job and the same goes for the Authorization. However, the Filters and Authorizations don't need to know what Jobs they are being used by. So that is a one to many relationship on the part of the Filters and Authorizations I believe right? Or am I off track? How is this modeled in a database? I believe the Job table needs to have a foreign key field to the Filter and Authorization tables. Do the Filter and Authorization tables need foreign key fields themselves to Job? Next, how do I model this in Java objects and then how do I set up the hibernate or java persistence annotations? I believe the Filter class looks like: class Filter {

    @OnetoMany
    @JoinColumn(name="filterID")
    private Job job;
}
 and the Authorization class basically the same and then how would the Job class look? The thing that's really throwing me is that the Filter and Authorization classes don't need any knowledge of what Job they're associated with so I don't see the need for them to actually hold references to Job objects. Only the Job class needs to hold references to the Filter and Authorization objects. So do I really need the above code? I'm hoping someone can help clarify all this for me as I can't seem to wrap my head around it. Databases are not my strong suit. Thanks.
@CODE:class Filter {

    @OnetoMany
    @JoinColumn(name="filterID")

 Why won't the combobox in the DG display the values from the StateList property? Any why does the separate combobox work properly?

@TITLE:JavaScript Escaping Form Values
@CONTENT:I know there are a lot of JavaScript escaping questions, but nothing seemed to fit my needs. I have textarea elements being dynamically displayed on a JSP. In the case of invalid form submits, I need to repopulate these fields with the values the user entered. I am doing this like so (note: simplified version): var textareaBox = document.getElementById("myTextArea");
if (textareaBox) {
    textareaBox.value = '${myForm.myValue}';
}
 Everything works fine until the user enters a value in the box that contains special characters. I've tried using the escape and unescape JavaScript functions individually and combined to no avail. Does anyone know how I can handle these special character values? Note that I obviously do not want the escaped text in the textarea as this would not look good to users.
@CODE:var textareaBox = document.getElementById("myTextArea");

@TITLE:Accessing multiple selected items in a ListPicker
@CONTENT:I came across the new Toolkit for Windows Phone that has the ListPicker control. Now after my searching I wanted to ask you people if I could actually select multiple items in a Listpicker and then use them? I've completed the adding and selecting multiple items part by using SelectionMode="Multiple" The XAML Code: <toolkit:ListPicker x:Name="TopStoriesListPicker" Margin="0" Header="Top Stories" Width="422" SelectionMode="Multiple" FullModeHeader="Top Stories" TabNavigation="Local" Style="{StaticResource ListPickerStyle1}">
                        <sys:String>BBC</sys:String>
                        <sys:String>CNN</sys:String>
                        <sys:String>FOX</sys:String>
                        <sys:String>SKY</sys:String>
</toolkit:ListPicker>
 Now how can I access these items after they have been multi checked? For one item I could have done: if (TopStoriesListPicker.SelectedItem == CNN)
    do something
 But now I have multiple items, plus the fact that these are no more proper items but have been defined by sys:String.
@CODE:SelectionMode="Multiple" <toolkit:ListPicker x:Name="TopStoriesListPicker" Margin="0" Header="Top Stories" Width="422" SelectionMode="Multiple" FullModeHeader="Top Stories" TabNavigation="Local" Style="{StaticResource ListPickerStyle1}">

@TITLE:jquery easing breaks jquery on wordpress
@CONTENT:Im getting an error when i add the jquery easing 1.3 plugin to my page, i havent even used custom easing yet but just loading it stops animated elements working. Im not a jquery expert so i dont really know how to debug it but im fairly sure that there is a conflict, heres the error: Uncaught TypeError: Property 'undefined' of object #<Object> is not a function
 The error is triggered when you roll over the animated elements, heres the page im working on: http://www.pegbarandgrill.com/blog/ if you roll over the links & directory you should see an animated menu open but this is when you will get the error. I sourced jquery and easing with the following lines <script type="text/javascript" src="/wp-content/themes/pegbarAndGrill_01/script/jquery.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="/wp-content/themes/pegbarAndGrill_01/script/easing.js"></script>
 Also if i remove the wp_head() and wp_footer() functions the conflict goes away. Any idea what the problem might be? Many thanks

fileChooser.setFileSelectionMode (JFileChooser.FILES_AND_DIRECTORIES);

    if (fileChooser.showOpenDialog(panelPic) == JFileChooser.APPROVE_OPTION)

 then my picture would have go through this pic = getFileOrDirectory();
picLabel = new JLabel (new ImageIcon(pic));
panelPic.add(picLabel);
System.out.println("picLabel added to panel");
repaint();
frame.validate();
 panelPic is where I would like the picture to be seen. then this is my code for the paint that doesn't really worked -_- so I erased the drawImage method that isn't really working for me. public void paint(Graphics g)

@TITLE:How to ensure that CodeIgniter controller and action exists
@CONTENT:I have to create a function that will check whether CodeIgniter's controller and action exists. The framework has non-reusable method Router::_validate_request() which checks whether the file exists, but I don't like it :) I'm trying to figure out what is the best way since they don't use any autoload functions and php's class_exists and method_exists are useless.

@TITLE:How do I change the format/amount of digits that appear?
@CONTENT:I'm very new to Python and have a question. Currently I'm using this to calculate the times between a message goes out and the message comes in. The resulting starting time, time delta, and the Unique ID are then presented in file. As well, I'm using Python 2.7.2 Currently it is subtracting the two times and the result is 0.002677777777(the 0.00 are hours and minutes) which I don't need. How do I format it so that it would start with seconds (59.178533,00) with 59 being seconds. As well, sometimes python will display the number as 8.9999999 x e-05. How can I force it to always display the exact number. def time_deltas(infile): 
   entries = (line.split() for line in open(INFILE, "r"))

@TITLE:load VBA data to line chart
@CONTENT:I need to feed data into a line chart with VBA. I need to give a basic unidimensional range when I do it with Excel in a raw test. The thing is that now I need to hide some things in VBA code, so that the user just sees a curve resulting of some basic input at the click of a button. I think there are at least two options for me : either have the chart object placed in the Excel before, and having it point to some VBA snippet. In this case, should I somehow point to VBA from Excel ? Or would VBA access the chart area by some ID ? create everything dynamically from VBA, the chart window, the chart, and the series input. This might be trickier to figure out maybe as I have frozen panes, so there would be the question of which pane is active (I'd like to avoid to have to do Selects to select the right one) What would you recommend ? And in either case, how to actually do it ? What type of data to put in ? Thank you so much !

@TITLE:Facebook graph api feed returning an empty array
@CONTENT:I'm trying to make a facebook graph api call to get a public(i.e. OPEN) group's feed. When I go to the group's site there's quite a large feed, but when I issue the API call, I get an empty array. I tried using an access_token parameter received from the group's adminitrator, but I still got nothing. Do I have to request some specific permissions to receive the feed? Note that on some pages I can get all data without extra permissions - e.g. the cocacola page: https://graph.facebook.com/cocacola/feed?#{ACCESS_TOKEN}
 My end goal is to have a list of all recent feed activity for the group on a third-party page.

@TITLE:Swap column value with the same column of another record
@CONTENT:I have this fairly straightforward table with ID, Position, Name columns. ID  Position  Name
1   1         RecordX
2   3         RecordY
3   2         RecordZ
 The Position column serves as an index for displaying the records in a user defined order, it should be unique, can not be lower than 1 and not be higher than the number of records in the table, in this case 3. The column doesn't enforce uniqueness so temporarily there can be 2 records with the same Position, but eventually no two records should have the same position for the correct working of the program. Currently, in order to swap the position of two records I need to do 3 queries, namely: find the other record's ID update the current record's Position to match the other record's Position update the other record's Position by it's previously found ID (Since momentarily there will be two records with the same Position, updating by Position is not possible. I feel there should be a way to do this with less rounds to the database, and thus with less than 3 queries. How should I approach this problem?
@CODE:ID Position Name ID  Position  Name
1   1         RecordX

@TITLE:How do I determine the size of a HTTP POST transaction to be submitted?
@CONTENT:I would like to determine te size (in bytes?) of a HTTP POST transaction to be submitted. I have a form with a lot of form data. When all fields are filled with the maximum number of characters (for example all 9's) and the form gets submitted through a POST method, there's no problem, and all data gets saved. When I replace all characters (9's) by spaces, I get a 404 after submitting the form. I'm assuming that I'm sending too much data here. I think the spaces are being converted to %20, so the amount of bytes posted are tripled. I would like to determine the size of the HTTP POST transaction, before submitting the form, so I can display a message to the user if the size is over some limit. I'd prefer to use JavaScript. Does anyone know how to determine this?

@CONTENT:new guy here! I am building a custom shopping cart driven by mysql and i am trying to update my cart item by item in terms of quantity. It seems that i am doing something wrong because when i try to update the quantity it only update the last item. I am posting the code below. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance. 1.cart.php:     $sql = "select * from orders";

        }
    }

    if(isset($result2)){

 So far it updates just the last record.

@TITLE:Why am I getting a false only in IE9 for image complete property?
@CONTENT:I've seen this pattern used quite a bit, but it seems IE9 doesn't like it. Here is a rough idea of what my function does: function(path){
    $("<img/>",{"src":path}).one("load",function(event,alreadyLoaded) {
        if(!alreadyLoaded) { 
            myObject.loadedImages = myObject.loadedImages || [];

        if(this.complete) {
            $(this).trigger("load",true);
        }
    });
}
 I realize this might be a duplicate, but the suggestions I've seen aren't working: (e.g. this.readyState // returns uninitialized) If someone could please point me in the right direction, that would be great. Thanks.

I want these elements to link to a different page (an xml one, or perhaps a View object). However, I realised one cannot use the method setContentView(int) on a ListActivity object. What's to be done? Thanks!
@CODE:setContentView(int)

@TITLE:Is it possible to do a url rewrite on a dynamic website?
@CONTENT:I have done much research into the issue, I'm not blindly asking but I can't grasp this concept. So my website contains a single index.php file that loads data into divs via ajax so the page never refreshes and the url never changes. I now know I need links to certain content using url rewriting. The site contains posts, so for instance all posts are pulled from the db and 'site.com' is the url. But I want to be able to do 'site.com/post-one' and have that link go to that post. I am thinking first I need to append a variable to the end of the url when the dynamic content for that post is loaded as such: site.com?post=1 so from there I can use url rewrite; the problem I'm having is this. Since the content for post 1 would be loaded into a div, if I went this route, and implemented the url rewrite, would site.com/post-1 now just pull the data dynamically as well or does the page have to be static?

@TITLE:Navigation properties not set when using ADO.NET Mocking Context Generator
@CONTENT:I am using ADO.NET Mocking Context Generator plugin for my Entity Framework model. I have not started on using mocks yet, just trying to fix generated entity and context classes to make application run as before without exceptions. I've already fixed T4 template to support SaveChanges method. Now I've got another problem: when I try to access any navigation property it is set to null. All the primitive fields inherited from DB table are set and correct. So what I am doing is the following using (var context = MyContext())
{
      var order = context.Orders.Where(p => p.Id == 7);
      var product = order.Products;
}
 in this case product is set to null. But that was not a case while using default code generator, it used to return real product object. Thanks ahead for any suggestions!

@TITLE:Setting the working directory for an eclipse plug-in
@CONTENT:In the Eclipse plugin I am developing, I am querying some Prolog files that are in my development directory. In addition, an initialization file located at the root of my working directory is automatically loaded by the Prolog engine I am using. All these files are resources of my plugin. When executing my application as a java standalone the only thing I need to do is to set, in the Eclipse Run Configurations dialog, the working directory to my default output directory. Then when executing my application the Prolog engine starts at the directory where the initialization file is located, and it is able to locate and load the prolog files of the application when needed. This Prolog engine is started from Java using the JPL library. My problem started when I wanted to build an Eclipse plug-in of my application. Apparently the default working directory for plugins cannot be changed in the Run Configurations dialog (at least that is the case in my Mac setting), otherwise an infinite list of exceptions appear when the plug-in is executed. So what I would like to know is if there is another way to setup the working directory for a plugin, both during the development lifecycle (i.e., when I launch my plugin as an Eclipse Application) and in production (i.e., when the plugin is in the plugin directory). Thanks !!

@TITLE:socket.getInputSteam.read() does not throw when I close the socket from the client
@CONTENT:I am on windows 7 x64. I am writing a server which opens a thread for every incoming connection - the thread reads from the connection's input stream. The read() should block and throw an exception if the socket is closed(). It does not - just returns -1. If I do not close the connection from the client - just let the client terminate - I get a connection reset as excpected - but if I close() the connection from the client (or just the client's output stream for that matter) read() in the server thread does not throw - just returns -1. The docs are pretty clear on this : public void close() throws IOException Closes this socket.

Any thread currently blocked in an I/O operation upon this socket will throw a SocketException.

@CONTENT:I have some generated classes, which are generated with ASCII encoding. But to compile this classes, the classes must be in UTF-8 encoding. So I need a plugin that converts this classes from ASCII or ISO-8859-1 respectivly to UTF-8. I tried to use the maven-resources-plugin and the native2ascii-maven-plugin to convert the files. But they didn't what I need. The maven-resources-plugin can only by configured with one flag, that is used for reading input and writing output. I always use UTF-8. So it's obviously that it hasn't any effect. On the other hand the native2ascii-maven-plugin only converts in the wrong direction, namly from UTF-8 to ASCII. But I need to convert the files from ASCII to UTF8. Are there any other plugins or which plugin solves my problem? Which configuration I have to use? Please provide a definitely working configuration snippet. Thanks

@TITLE:MATLAB serial port connection is too slow
@CONTENT:I've got a detector that spits out two numbers at a high rate when I turn it on. I've been capturing my data using HyperTerminal, which seems to be able to keep up with the device. I wanted to automate the process and control the device entirely through Matlab, but discovered that less than half of the data gets through to Matlab. Are there any known issues with Matlab's speed in this area? Here's what I'm using to read in data: s = serial('COM1', 'BaudRate', 115200, 'DataBits', 8, 'Terminator','CR/LF', 'InputBufferSize', 1024);
T1 = 1;       % Initial T1, T2 values
T2 = 10000;
timer = 300;

% Inputs to serial device: T1, T2, runtime (seconds)    
fprintf(s, sprintf('%d %d %d\r', T1, T2, timer));
tdata = zeros(1e5,2,'uint16');
data = fopen(sprintf('%s.txt',date_and_trial),'w');
tic;
while toc <= timer
% Read data into an array, and write to file.
    if s.BytesAvailable >= 13
            line = fgets(s);
            if length(line) == 13
                a = sscanf(line, '%u %u');
                if length(a) == 2
                    tdata(i,1) = a(1);
                    tdata(i,2) = a(2);
                    fprintf(data, sprintf('%d %d\r', tdata(i,1), tdata(i,2)));
                    i++;

    end
    disp(toc);
    fclose(s);
    fclose(data);

@CONTENT:I'm trying to authenticate a user with LDAP using PHP. I have the DN for the user which I have checked to be correct. I also have a password. This is the correct password for the user when they authenticate with SamAccountName. I am hoping this is the password to use when authenticating with the DN. There isn't a Distinguished Name specific password for LDAP is there? The following is my code to authenticate using PHP's ldap_bind() function. Am I doing this correct? $ldaphost="ldap://somehost.com:3268";

@TITLE:Nhibernate - Inheritance - Zero to one Relationship to child object, how to map? (Fluent API)
@CONTENT:I have a Inheritance Hierarchy where Action is parent of ActionCompleted and ActionCancelled. Order class has a zero to one ActionCompleted and ActionCancelled. the only place I wanted to keep the foreign key is in the action table of the orderId. is that possible? This works fine in the relational world?? There maybe 7-8 ActionTypes and order will have zero to one relationship to all of them. I am new to ORM and started with EF but so far did not get any help to resolve this issue, now I want to explore this using NHibernate. I know it maybe too much to ask but if anyone has some free time and can write me the mappings for the below scenario it will be appreciated. If you can point me to some sample which uses similar scenario that will be also great help. Since I am just getting started with Nhibernate it may be too much for me to take on inheritance mapping and mapping to the child object. Below is the link to the code for classes and the DB script, please let me know if you need any more information. Thanks.

 but for some reason it doesnt like the string variable that I pass it "new RegExp(className+"[(.*?)]");" it doesnt throw an error but the validation doesnt work. Edit: I will take the information from the class stribute and pass it as classString <div class="field-character-count test[asd, 123, hello]"></div>
 and the "className" will represent "test"

@TITLE:Define function in Python as it defined in C
@CONTENT:I have function in C that reads byte by byte from a given buffer and returns the result of a mathematical formula. I need to write the same function in Python The buffer in C is struct and in python i used ctypes Structure class my prototype in c is int calc_formula(char *buff,int len) so calling the function in c is staright forward but how i define such function in Python? I try to define the following and have some questions def calc_formula(buff,len):
    some code
 In C I called the function with pointer to the strcut first char. How do I do it in Python? is buff passed as pointer? My buffer is very large and if it can't be done, I will use global variable (which is less preferred). I need to read the buffer byte by byte, so in c I simply increment the buffer pointer. What's the way to do it in python? I read about ctypes union class that I can define over the Structure and go over it byte by byte. Do you have a better solution? UPDATE i tried bbrame solution : def calc_formula(buff, len):
    sum = 0     
    for curChar in buff: 
        numericByteValue = ord(curChar) 
        sum += numericByteValue     
    return sum 
 with When i try its code with calc_formula(input_buff,len) , i get the following: "*error:TypeError: 't_input_buff' object is not iterable*" - input_buff is instance of t_input_buff that is Class(Structure) . what can be the problem? (it give me the error when it try to do the for command)

@CONTENT:I have some video files in iPhone library and I am developing iPhone app to stream video from my iPhone to another device. I have already server developed at iPhone side. My question is how can I stream this video files to another device or server from iPhone. Another question is I have done video segment by apples mediafilesegmenter and generate ts and m3u8 files.I am wondering what is different between if I give link to m3u8 file(which is called http streaming may be) or link to the direct video file (mov,mp4) to the renderer.

@TITLE:sharing java objects between applications
@CONTENT:I want to write an application that when deployed on a server discovers some classes on that server and their methods and expos? a list of it to a client (via web service, servlet or RMI). the client can then choose a method and activate it (with reflection). Problem is that my application is not in the same context of the other applications on the server so I can't activate their methods (I don't have access to their classloader). I have a few ideas but not sure if they are feasible: Create a jar and make all applications on the server know it (via Manifes file or by putting it in the server lib) - Problem is ,that way I can't expos? an interface to the client (maybe I can through RMI?) Create a WAR and link all applications to this WAR, so when they startup they load it (like linking to a jar) - as far as I know its not possible. Is there a classloader that knows all classes? is there a way to get it? How does profilers do it? Any idea will be welcomed.

@CONTENT:For a policy-based class-design I need some of the policies to call functions that are found in other policies: struct PolicyA {
  void foo() {

};

struct PolicyB {
  void bar() {
    // Need to call foo() here
  }

template <class A, class B> MyClass : A, B {};
 The two options I see are: Pass MyClass<A, B> to PolicyA and PolicyB as template parameters and do something like dynamic_cast<MyClass<A, B>*>(this)->foo();. However this may easily get very complicated (especially if it's not only B calling A but also the other way). Have a base class for each policy where all the functions are declared as pure virtual. This fails when one of the function needs its own template parameters, since virtual template functions are not possible. This should be a common problem, but I didn't find anything. I guess there probably is some boost-magic or something. How would you solve this? Edit: See also the followup here.

 A random number of endpoint (get from the 1001 points column randomly) corresponds to every startpoint (get from the points column sequentially),. The number of endpoint is in [1,7].

 So basically, all i need to do is pass additional parameters to the print method, but this is impossible! It wouldn't implement the print class other wise! I've tried substituting arrays and a lot more, i can't think of anything else!

@TITLE:VBA convert range to array and format date
@CONTENT:I am struggling with a conversion to array in VBA : Dim list As Range
Set list = Range(series, series.End(xlDown))
list.Select
Dim table() As Variant
Set table = list.value
 My understanding is that value returns an array right ? I don't get why VBA tells me that I "can't assign to array". My list range looks like that in Excel at the Select, and i aim at having that as an array so that I can format my dates using something like Format(table.Rows(i).Columns(1).value, "yyyy-mm-dd"), looping on my table. 02-Sep-09   1.00

@TITLE:C# implementing a application wide cache
@CONTENT:In our application we want to 'translate' labels. I don't want to hit the database multiple times for the same label. So when I already have fetched the term X I want to get this term from the cache. Now I am thinking on how to implement this. I could think of this options: Create a Singleton. So basically you are creating a public variable Create a class with a static list on it which contains the cached translations. What should you do? I am using C# winforms. Edit: I don't mean lanquage translation, but term translation. Our customers have their own term for the same thing. So this is a setting in our application. Say you have term X, they can say, I'd like to call the Z. So everywhere in the application where X is used, Z must be displayed. Every form has a few labels with (the same) terms. So the data itself is small (only one word), but it is possible that it goes into the database 20 times to get the terms for one form.

@TITLE:AS3 - Returning a property of a class rather than the class itself
@CONTENT:In ActionScript 3, there are some classes that will represent a value rather than the class itself. It's hard to explain properly what I mean, so take this example: var str:String = "something";
var mc:MovieClip = new MovieClip();

trace(str); // something
trace(mc); // [object MovieClip]
 You'll notice that the first trace outputs a value, rather than [object String]. Ontop of this, I can still make use of methods of String, like this: var ar:Array = str.split('s');
 Even though in a way you could almost read the above as: "something".split('s');
 I have a class AvLevelData that has some methods that deal with level data (which is essentially a String). At the moment there is a property data:String which represents the core level data. The question I have is - can I replicate the behaviour of String in that when I trace or assign an instance of AvLevelData, the result is actually the String data. For example, at the moment I need to go: var levelData:AvLevelData = new AvLevelData();
trace(levelData.data);
 To get the data. I instead want to be able to simply do the following: var levelData:AvLevelData = new AvLevelData();
trace(levelData); // some level data string
 Is this possible?
@CODE:var str:String = "something";
var mc:MovieClip = new MovieClip();

trace(str); // something
trace(mc); // [object MovieClip] [object String] String var ar:Array = str.split('s'); "something".split('s'); AvLevelData data:String AvLevelData data var levelData:AvLevelData = new AvLevelData();
trace(levelData.data); var levelData:AvLevelData = new AvLevelData();
trace(levelData); // some level data string

@TITLE:Core data saving in thread
@CONTENT:I'm developing a client server application in iPad. I need to save quite a number of data the server sends me. it sends me a long string, and i have to break it up into small records and save it in core data. it sends me a total of probably 20 messages and each messages has roughly 100 over records. The problem now is the user has to wait for all the messages to be saved into the core data, before the UI unfreezes, as its all running in the main thread. Question, Can i receive the message from server, and throw the breaking up of data and saving into core data into threads? i keep getting the sigbart error when the context is save. I checked the core data, it saves about 4 records before hitting that error. Can multiple threads access / save into core data at the same time? Sorry i'm really lost. tried the open source Magical Records but it keep having errors.

@TITLE:Is it possible to send HTTP request using plain socket connection and receive response without headers?
@CONTENT:experts I am trying to implement a downloader which handles HTTP protocol, I am able to send HTTP request using the following code: StringBuilder request = new StringBuffer().append("GET ").append(uri.getPath());
if(uri.getQuery() != null)
    request.append('?').append(uri.getQuery());
request.append(" HTTP/1.1\nHost: ").append(uri.getHost()).append("\nAccept: */*\n\n");

// send the request
outputStream.write(request.toString().getBytes("utf-8"));
outputStream.flush();
 On receiving the response, I will need to save the body of the response to disk, and the job is done. My question is: are there any HTTP headers that I can set for the request which will cause the server to send the response without HTTP headers(only the body)? The reason why I am asking this question is that if that is possible, I don't need to skip the HTTP headers manually when reading the response, I can directly start reading raw bytes from the input stream. all I want is the body of the response, the HTTP headers don't matter much in this case.
@CODE:StringBuilder request = new StringBuffer().append("GET ").append(uri.getPath());
if(uri.getQuery() != null)
    request.append('?').append(uri.getQuery());

@TITLE:How does jQuery parameterize an array in $.ajax()?
@CONTENT:I'm using a plugin to do a non-Ajax post. However, my array is just submitted with "[Object = object]", so I clearly need to do some parameterization on this array object. It's not as simple as putting it in a hash like: { 'myarray': myarray }
 When you send the above to $.ajax(), it changes it to something like: { 'myarray': {'1': arrayfirsthash, '2': arraysecondhash, ...., '3': arraynhash } }
 There must be some jQuery function that does that conversion. What is it, and can I call it publicly? Thanks for any help you can offer. UPDATE: To clarify my question, I'm actually looking to see how I can place this value in a form element so that it will be understood as a hash by the server. Even if I place the JSON-encoded hash in a form element, it still comes out as "Object" by the server. I need to somehow serialize this JSON hash so that it can be POSTED to my server.

 im guessing it has to do with the Limits, but if i change the limit to more than 1 i get "the error no 1242 Subquery returns more than one row." can someone please help me rephrase the query to show total hours no matter how many logins they have? Edit: still having problems with this so i came up with a new query but then i keep getting null instead of the total. any idea why this is so? +----------------------------------------------------+---------------+

@TITLE:syncdb not adding fixtures in 3rd party project
@CONTENT:I've written a pretty simple Django application called django-locality which takes the headache out of working with countries and territories. It provides a lot of initial data for countries and territories. I just the 0.1 release up to PyPI, and installed it in my project which I'm currently working on. (I basically created it out of a need I found in my original project.) When I ran syncdb, however, it didn't install any of my fixtures from locality. In the output, it printed "No fixtures found," and no rows were added to the database, though the tables were generated. Is there a reason why Django is missing my initial data? My data lives at locality/fixtures/initial_data.json and installs just fine if running it from it's own dedicated project. As I'm using setuptools to manage dependencies, would it make a difference if I downloaded it as a zipped egg vs. a simple directory layout? Initially, it seems that my JSON wasn't being included in the egg, and this is why syncdb didn't work. Now, I've fixed that problem, but syncdb is still failing to find any of my fixtures. You can download the egg to see for yourself here. I can't think of any reason why Django would be missing the initial data. You can also view the repository on GitHub. Why isn't Django seeing the fixtures? When I run syncdb -v 2, I do see that Django sees the egg and looks for the fixtures: No json fixture 'initial_data' in '/home/rfkrocktk/Desktop/myproject/eggs/django_locality-0.1.1-py2.7.egg/locality/fixtures'.
 Is it possible that Django doesn't know how to read from eggs?

@LINK:/questions/8317214/jmeter-session-cookie
@TITLE:JMeter; session cookie
@CONTENT:I've seen several JMeter threads that kind of touch on my issue, but none seem to address my specific problem. The problem is - the web-site that I am testing, works like this: A home-page with logon fields, and a submit button. When you first browse to this page in a browser, a PHPSESSID cookie is set (comes down in the Response Header) with a unique Value, to identify the session. When the user clicks on the login button (username and password on this page are irrelevant in the system's current state), the web server redirects to a different server running LDAP, via shibboleth. Shibboleth needs the value of the PHPSESSID cookie, to proceed. (to validate that the user is coming from a correct, federated server). The user then enters their account username and password, and clicks the login button. The (valid) account is logged in to the LDAP server; if the account did not exist on the original (1) server, then shibboleth maps the LDAP fields over to the account database on the original server. Then the user is logged in to the original server (1) to the newly-created account, and redirected to the original page. There's some other SAML data that's exchanged - which I don't think is going to be a problem. . . so far, the problem seems to be this cookie. Where JMeter is falling down, is in step 2. If I do not set a cookie manager, the LDAP server says that I do not have cookies enabled. (this error is in the response data). If I set the HTTP cookie manager, with no PHPSESSID cookie specified, the LDAP server says that I do not have cookies enabled. (it does not matter which Cookie Policy I set it to) If I specify the PHPSESSID cookie value - of course, each user needs to have an unique value, so this will be wrong. . . So I set a RegExp post processor for the initial page, to extract the PHPSESSID value from the Request Header, and place it into a variable ${PHPSession} Then I specify a value, in HTTP Cookie Manager, for the PHPSESSID cookie, of ${PHPSession} . . . and LITERALLY, in the header, the ** thing submits a "Cookie: PHPSESSID=${PHPSession}" So then, I read THIS. . . https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=28715 Which says, in effect, (paraphrased) "...cookie manager doesn't expand user variables..." then "... okay, we fixed it... it does expand user variables..." then "... well, no, not in THAT field, it's not designed to do THAT." So... basically, they're saying, HTTP Cookie Manager can not manage session cookies that have an unique value for each user. (even though, this is what I thought it's whole purpose was). How else can I set and submit a unique cookie for each user whose value is extracted from the first Response Header?

@TITLE:Error when creating an executable test-jar in Maven
@CONTENT:I'm trying to create a JAR that I can put on a non development machine and run some unit tests that exercise a web service. I've read that there are many ways to do this in maven. I'm focusing on using the test-jar goal because that seems the most logical approach. My tests are in a separate maven project with a folder structure of: /myProject/src/test/java/org/testplatform/services/test/<name of testng test>.java
 Here is my config for the test-jar in the pom:         <plugin>

 When I execute the resulting JAR I get this error: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/testng/ITestListener

 Im not getting any connection when Im calling the Client class from the android app. Anyone know how to fix this problem? The class 'Client' is called from the onReceive(Context context, Intent intent){ method when a message is received on the phone.
@CODE:public static final int PORT = 8080;
public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
    ServerSocket s = new ServerSocket(PORT);
    try {
        Socket socket = s.accept();
        try {
            BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));
            String str = in.readLine();
            System.out.println(str);
        } 
        finally {
            socket.close();
        }
    } 
    finally {
        s.close();
    }
} public Client(String message){

    try {
        Socket socket = new Socket("127.0.0.1", 8080);
        PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(socket.getOutputStream())),true);

@TITLE:Does mongoose's distinct function support regex in a query?
@CONTENT:I have the following bit of js in a node/mongoose project. I'm working on an autocomplete form. It works just fine with a regular "find", but I want to do a "distinct" find instead. So here's where I'm at so far. The problem I believe is in the way the query is formed. Can someone help with my syntax in the distinct line? Or is it just that mongoose's "distinct" doesn't support regex in an optional query? var text.term = 'johnny';
var regex = new RegExp("^"+text.term);
// execute the search
Performance.collection.distinct({lc_actor: regex}, function(err, docs) {
    var names = [];
    for(var nam in docs) {
        // push the lc_actor to the array
    names.push(docs[nam].lc_actor);
    }
    // send back via callback function
    callback(null, names);
});
 And here's what my super-verbose (-vvvvvvvvvvvvv) mongoose console is showing: Tue Nov 29 13:34:30 [conn1] runQuery called mydb.$cmd { distinct: "performances", query: {}, key: { lc_actor: /^johnny/ } }

@TITLE:JS/web debugger to trace origins of HTTP requests?
@CONTENT:I am looking for a tool that would run in a browser (any browser will do) and show me where each HTTP request originated (HTML source file and line, Javascript, or whatever else). A bit of background. There is a third-party Web application that can be accessed either directly or through a content-modifying proxy. In the former case it works, in the latter it doesn't. My task is to figure out why the proxy breaks the app, and fix whatever problem there is (normally the proxy should only modifications that do not affect functionality). I have narrowed it down to a single HTTP request. When accessed directly, the browser issues a GET to one particular address, say http://example.com/foobar.html. When accessed through the proxy, there's no such request. This foobar.html contains an important part of the application, so it won't function without it. Supposedly the proxy breaks some code that ought to issue this request. The problem is that I cannot find this code, and so cannot figure out what exactly is broken. There's nothing that looks remotely like foobar in the entire application. The application in question is a jumble of obfuscated Javascript that generates other avascript and/or HTML that may contain more Javascript etc. Somewhere along the road it probably generates, piece by piece, some iframe src=... or whatever via document.write, and this chunk of HTML references the needed http://example.com/foobar.html. So what I need is the ability to tell the browser: "See this address, http://example.com/foobar.html? Whenever there is a request to this address, stop and show me what are you doing!" Hopefully this will let me narrow down my search somewhat more. I couldn't find such functionality in firebug or venkman. Am I missing something? Is there any other tool that would let me do it? I see the Referer header of the request in question, but the referring file is very large and obfuscated. So far, I was not able to make anything meaningful out of it.

@LINK:/questions/8313110/gpx-schema-validation-problems
@TITLE:GPX Schema validation problems
@CONTENT:I am building an application that works primarily with GPX files as the input data. Given the fact that gpx files are supposed to be defined by the gpx schema (as defined here: http://www.topografix.com/gpx.asp), the first thing that I taught is reasonable to do with my application was to validate the input file against the schema(bearing in mind the different versions of course). So far so good. For the initial files I was testing, everything was perfect. However, sometimes I use .gpx files which turn out to be invalid against the relevant gpx schema. So, I was trying to import them with other similar tools and strangely, no error was returned and the file was parsed perfectly. So, the most logical conclusion is that there is a problem with my code. However, after a thorough investigation, my code was totally fine and no problems with it were at present. This was even verified by the suggested validation technique from topografix.com ( http://www.topografix.com/gpx_validation.asp ) , and it again concluded the file is invalid. So, it turns out that there are some GPS devices/GPS recording systems/etc. which produce .gpx files without conforming to the official GPX schema. This conclusions leads me to ask the question: WHY ? I seriously do not understand the idea behind it. Furthermore, with most of the invalid files I have found, the problem is not something that may be regarded as an additional feature but is something like not following the right order with some elements' children which I consider to be totally stupid. This leads me to ask two questions to you. Firstly, I would be happy if someone can explain to me why is that a lot of the GPX files that I found on the web do not conform to the official GPX schema. Secondly, I would like to ask you how do you deal with this problem if you are to parse GPX files. After all, the track points will be in the file anyway, so do I simply have to ignore XML schema validation and proceed with direct parsing ? But then again, if there is a misspelled attribute name, my system would crash. Any information on how do you deal with parsing GPS files will be very much appreciated. Thanks for your time and help. Regards, Petar EDIT: I have posted a new thread: GPX parsing patterns and "standards" where I am asking how people are actually parsing GPX files in practice. If you have an idea please post your answer there.

@TITLE:Web Garden and Static Objects difficult to understand
@CONTENT:I am in the process of investigating to convert our web application to the web farm. So I started with web garden, by converting the 'Maximum Worker Process = 3'. Following is the simplified version of my problem. Following is my Static Object class. public static class MyStaticObject
{
public static string MyProperty {get;set;}
}     
 Then on Page Load I initialized the Static Objects as follows - MyStaticObject.MyProperty = "My Static Property";
 Then using asp.net ajax [WebMethod] create the ajax method on my web page [WebMethod()]
public static string getStaticProperty()
{
  return MyStaticObject.MyProperty;
}
 // Then I call this Ajax method using Javascript and set the return to the text box. This test is not working as expected. Following are my assumptions and wrong outcome from the test. I thought when we set virtual directory to be web garden, then each request to the virtual directory is handled by different process in web garden, so my next few request to the server, should return null as I have initialized the static objects for one working process. But even if I click the ajax button for 20 times in row (means 20 requests) even then the static objects return me value. Am i right in assuming on restarting the IIS should kill all the static objects. Static objects are not shared in web gardens/web farms. I am surprised by the behaviour of IIS, static objects and web garden. Is I am assuming wrong or my way of testing is wrong. Thanks.
@CODE:public static class MyStaticObject
{
public static string MyProperty {get;set;}
} MyStaticObject.MyProperty = "My Static Property"; [WebMethod()]
public static string getStaticProperty()
{
  return MyStaticObject.MyProperty;

@TITLE:Is DiskCacheProvider in ASP.Net 4.0 really exist?
@CONTENT:I read many places said the new feature in ASP.net 4.0, and the code is:     <caching>
        <outputCache defaultProvider="AspNetInternalProvider">
            <providers>
                <add name="DiskCache"

            </providers>
        </outputCache>
    </caching>
 Anyway, I cannot get it work, I change the code inside out, no use. I cannot only find 1 cache provider from Microsoft which shipping with asp.net is AspNetInternalProvider So, Is DiskOutputCacheProvider really exist? If yes, how to use it. Also, I need to use it in Azure, so I guess is here must have a place for disk cache to setup cache folder, right? If anyone has a disk cache solution for azure (use LocalResources.LocalStorage or not), please share with me, free or paid. Thanks.

@TITLE:How to debug an access violation in the Microsoft Audio Compression Manager in a DirectShow application?
@CONTENT:I have a Delphi 6 DirectShow application that exchanges audio with Skype via sockets. I am getting an intermittent access violation in one of the threads started by one of the DLLs loaded by the Filter Graph when the DirectShow filter chain is ran. As I discovered in a previous SO post with the help of another SO member, the thread that faults appears to be started by the Microsoft Audio Compression Manager (msacm32.dll): How can I tell what DLL started a thread and what address space a DLL owns for an external DLL? The error does not happen if I don't use compression. This makes sense since my filter graph only loads the ACM DLL if compression is actually turned on using a setting in my application. Therefore the *msacm32.dll would not be loaded. However, if I don't exchange audio with Skype via sockets I don't seem to get the access violation, even if compression is in use. What complicates the issue is that if I have the sockets connected with Skype, but I never send any data to Skype or receive any data from it over those sockets, I still get the access violation. I determined this by commenting out the code that does the socket send and receive calls and noticed I still got the AV. However, if I don't connect to Skype at all via sockets then the AV doesn't seem to occur. I say "seem" because several hours of testing indicate that, but that's not proof of course. NOTE: the AV is intermittent. It doesn't happen every time, but I never am able to run more than 5 trials in a row without it happening. Has anyone ever had experience with getting an access violation when using the ACM in a DirectShow application? If so, what was the cause and how did you fix it?

@CONTENT:I'm trying to implement colour cycling on my text in Python, ie i want it to cycle through the colour of every character typed (amongst other effects) My progress so far has been hacked together from an ansi colour recipe improvement suggestions welcomed. I was also vaguely aware of, but never used: termcolor, colorama, curses during the hack i managed to make the attributes not work (ie reverse blink etc) and its not perfect probably mainly because I dont understand these lines properly: cmd.append(format % (colours[tmpword]+fgoffset))

c=format % attrs[tmpword] if tmpword in attrs else None
 if anyone can clarify that a bit, I would appreciate it. this runs and does something, but its not quite there. I changed the code so instead of having to separate colour commands from your string you can include them.  #!/usr/bin/env python

 But I read somewhere that the option -Xbootclasspath is not standard, is it dangerous to use it? if yes, where can i put my jsr169.jar so it can loaded directly by the boot class loader? thanks a million guys Elie

@CONTENT:I want to know if it's possible to do something like this: `readfile(base64_decode_only_img_src_tags("mypage.html")); I've been looking for a solution but without results. The idea is to change the lines encoded of an html file to his decoded line, for example: <img src="data:image/png;base64,**iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABAAAAAQAQMAAAAlPW0iAAAABlBMVEW/v7////+Zw/90AAAAEUlEQVQI12P4z8CAFWEX/Q8Afr8P8erzE9cAAAAASUVORK5CYII=**">
 To: <img src="/path/to/images/image.gif">
 I know maybe I should parse the code to detect the lines with img src tag and then decode the ** marked part of these lines **, but I don't know how to do it during the readfile. Thanks in advance. Just as @mario said, I'm testing his code:  $newhtml = file_get_contents('newhtml.html');

function data_to_img($match) {
    list(, $img, $type, $base64, $end) = $match;
    $bin = base64_decode($base64);
    $md5 = md5($bin);   // generate a new temporary filename
    $fn = "$md5.$type";
    file_exists($fn) or file_put_contents($fn, $bin);

    return "$img$fn$end";  // new <img> tag
}
 If I try to echo:  echo preg_replace_callbak('#(<img[^>]+src=")data:image/(gif|png|jpeg);base64,([\w=+/]+)("[^>]*>)#', "data_to_img", $content);
 And it worked with the html example above!! Now I'm trying with my real html file. I noticed that the img src are longer than the example that I've provided. Real example of img src that I have is too long to paste here, so please second button mouse click on the dog image and image information to see the base64 code. Thanks a lot!! html file with base64 images UPDATE: Hope this guy had the same problem with base64 large codification and regex Link to the similiar problem UPDATE2: Mario solved my problem, thank you very much man.

@TITLE:Showing a common music player in all activities
@CONTENT:I'm working on an app for a band, which consists of several different activities such as an agenda, news section, album section et cetera. Since it's for a band, I would like to play the band's songs in the background. This isn't such a problem, but I would like to show a small music player on the bottom of all activities so users can always stop, skip, or replay a song if they want to. An example of this can be found in the apps of Mobile Roadie, for instance. However I have no idea how to do this. My best guess is creating a music player class with its own layout, and including this at the bottom of each activity/layout. But since every activity starts in its own thread, I'm guessing this would reset the player for each activity. So, how would I go about adding a common music player to all of my activities, where the state of the music player would be maintained? For an example, download any of the music based apps of Mobile Roadie and you'll know what I mean. I decided on using Fragments, but I'm not sure if I can use those in already existing activities. All the examples I found focus on completely new projects, and not already existing ones. So in short, can you create fragments and use them in already existing activities? (such as showing the music player on top of the existing agenda activity)

@TITLE:using a chart with values from textboxes
@CONTENT:I'm trying to make a pie chart that uses values from a user from text box's. I'm using c# windows forms chart control. The problem is where to assign the text box's as values. Is it done in code? if so what do I call? Is it done in the control properties? if so what do I do? Is it a bit of both? is so, well same as both above. I've attempted to make one using the properties wizard but I cant see where to assign the values for it to process, the data source seem to only allow objects and connections to Dbos. I'm hoping this is a really simple process I'm overlooking. Yes I've checked MSDN but not a lot of info on the specifics I require. Yes I've checked google but again there is either no info or info on building my own from scratch (which I have done, but looks really bad) this is some code ive tried          double[] yValues = { 10, 8, 7, 12};
        string[] xNames = { "Greater than 200", "Between 200-100", "Between 100-50", "Below 50" };

        chart1.Series[0].Points.DataBindXY(xNames, yValues);
        chart1.Series[1].Points.DataBindXY(xNames, yValues);
        chart1.Series[2].Points.DataBindXY(xNames, yValues);
        chart1.Series[3].Points.DataBindXY(xNames, yValues);
 it errors at series[2], saying the index was out of range. Im guessing it something to do with how the chart is currently set up ::UPDATED:: Ok so i was right i didnt assign enough series to the chart (silly me). Ive managed to get it up and running.....unfortunatly the image display looks like.....a letter(wierd). Its a box with a cross in the middle all equal aswell. I would at least think its would display proportional to the values i sent. so is this a set up OR is there something im doing wrong in my code?
@CODE:double[] yValues = { 10, 8, 7, 12};

@TITLE:WPF4 JumpList Missing when launched from Program Files
@CONTENT:I have a very simple application that I'm adding jumplist support to. A few days ago I was happy and I called it version 1. So I copied it to c:\program files\clipboard editor\clipboardeditor.exe and ran it. Great. Pinned it to my taskbar, even better. Now I'm adding a jumplist to go right to the common formats skipping the UI altogether. I've written it all--it works! Built as Release, copied it over the old exe in program files and launch it--no jump list. I've pinned and unpinned and rebooted and done everything I can think of. It feels like Explorer is caching the jump list for the exe from Program files but my Google skills are failing me. Any suggestions? My (working from not-program files) XAML looks like: <JumpTask Title="Text Only" Arguments="text" IconResourcePath="%WINDIR%\System32\imageres.dll"  IconResourceIndex="14"/>
<JumpTask Title="Image Only" Arguments="image" IconResourcePath="%WINDIR%\System32\imageres.dll"  IconResourceIndex="16"/>

@CONTENT:I have an application where I am sending image data on server through ftp and retrieving back in a functionality of preview. Now I am able to send the image on server,but while retrieving it back,I am getting following error in NSData and 0 bytes are fetched. Error Domain=NSCocoaErrorDomain Code=256 "The operation couldn\u2019t be completed. (Cocoa error 256.)"

 I am able to fetch other data easily,but not the image data. Can anybody point out,where I am doing mistake or how I can resolve the problem? Thanks in advanced. EDIT : In my application I am first of all capturing an image and storing it on the server. And then on the 2nd page,I need to fetch the image data and to show the same image when the user clicks a button called Preview. I am having a web service where I am getting the data including the path of the image as shown above,but with the method shown I am not able to fetch the Image data in NSData and getting the Cocoa error 256.

@CONTENT:I dunno if its right to post a similar question to a previously closed one. Its quite different so I thought I'd try. Ok, *-device-width is to target devices (not rendering area) with a specific width. *-width is to target the rendering width. So when designing, won't I always want to target based on rendering area, if the device width is say 768 but the browser chrome (for example) takes up 20px of that, then won't scroll bars appear if I use *-device-width. So question is shouldn't I use *-width every time? Suppose next time, tablets allow users to resize their browsers, wont my site be "unresponsive" if I use *-device-width?

 I do not have this behavior in an excel file that I create from scratch, but I need to use the supplied file. Don't know if it's significant, but I'm working in the .Net 4 Framework, and it's an 1.01 MB .xlsm file. The file saves/saves-as fine (even with new data) from within Excel. NOTE: apparently .xlsx files work just fine, but the the .xlsm format contain VBA macros that can't be saved in the .xlsx format, so the file-type cannot be converted.

 All fine and it should work; except it doesn't. The createNewTab() function gets stuck into an infinite loop and the variable returnTab never gets the callback return value. If I do it the way I'm meant to do it, without the wait loop everything works and the callback function executes the way it should. Why isn't this working? LE: Looks like the callback function waits for the loop to complete. Does anyone know a way to keep the whole function busy until the callback function fires up?

@LINK:/questions/8302054/database-schema-pattern-for-grouping-records
@TITLE:Database schema pattern for grouping records
@CONTENT:I'm looking for a design pattern to manage records in a relational database which belong together, e.g. grouping multiple contacts. The group itself does not need to be an entity. A group should have an unlimited count of members. It should be possible to run a query to get other group members of a given record. My idea is to manage it in one table: GROUPINGS
  integer group
  integer member_id

primary_key (group, member_id)
foreign_key (member_id)
 EDIT: Beware that group is not a foreign key. It's just a unique identifier. It should be increased for every member group which is built. Here is an example content: GROUPINGS group | member_id
          -----------------
              1 | 10
              1 | 11
              1 | 12
              2 | 20
              2 | 21
              3 | 10
              3 | 40
 This example contains three groups: (10,11,12) and (20,21) and (10,40). You see that 10 is included in two groups. To query the "neighbors" of member 10 we can use this SQL statement: SELECT g2.member_id
FROM groupings g1
JOIN groupings g2 ON g1.group      = g2.group 
                 AND g1.member_id != g2.member_id
WHERE g1.member_id = 10

=> 11,12,40
 What do you think? Perhaps this is a known pattern - are there links to find more about this? EDIT: Renamed table "groups" to "groupings" and renamed attribute "group_id" to "group" to make it obvious that a record in this table is not a group - it's a link between a group and a member. Group is not an entity.
@CODE:GROUPINGS
  integer group
  integer member_id

primary_key (group, member_id)
foreign_key (member_id) group GROUPINGS group | member_id
          -----------------

              2 | 21
              3 | 10
              3 | 40 SELECT g2.member_id
FROM groupings g1
JOIN groupings g2 ON g1.group      = g2.group 
                 AND g1.member_id != g2.member_id

@TITLE:MySQL Full-text search - search for short words
@CONTENT:I have a problem. I made a simple search engine which searches by brand and model of car. For reasons of query performance and a lot of data in database, I decided to use full-text search. It's ok, but now I come across the problem: I would like to find all cars with brand "Audi" and with model "Q7". For now, I have this SQL query, but it doesn't work right, because of word length "Q7": SELECT `a`.`id`, `a`.`title`, `a`.`askprice`, `a`.`description`, `a`.`picture`
FROM (`mm_ads` as a)
WHERE `a`.`category` =  '227'
AND `a`.`askprice` >= '0'
AND `a`.`askprice` <= '144000'
AND (MATCH(a.title) AGAINST ('+audi +q7' IN BOOLEAN MODE ))
GROUP BY `a`.`id`
ORDER BY `a`.`id` ASC
LIMIT 30
 I don't have access to modify MySQL config file, to set ft_min_word_len to value 2. For now value is 3. Is there any other way to deal with that? Here is another problem: I would like to get all cars brand "BMW" and model "116". For example, I have a car named BMW, 1, 116i. My SQL query is: `SELECT `a`.`id`, `a`.`title`, `a`.`askprice`, `a`.`description`, `a`.`picture`
FROM (`mm_ads` as a)
WHERE `a`.`category` =  '227'
AND `a`.`askprice` >= '0'

AND (MATCH(a.title) AGAINST ('+bmw +116' IN BOOLEAN MODE))
GROUP BY `a`.`id`
ORDER BY `a`.`id` ASC
LIMIT 30`
 Search return 0 rows. Why? All input strings ("BMW", "116") are min length 3. What am I doing wrong? Regards, Mario

@CONTENT:I am slowly, piece by piece learning what I am doing with ASP.NET I've created the beginnings of my new web application, but I am often coming up against the issue that ASP.NET renames elements IDs or in the case of form fields, their names. I have a form which is basically a sales system. It is essentially made up of two User Controls, one is a form for Customer Details (name, address etc) and the second is a form for the customer's purchases, it consists of a number lines dynamically created by Javascript created as you list the items the customer is purchasing. Both these sections are User Controls because they are to be used for other areas of the system where this data will need to be recalled/re-entered. When the USer Control is loaded, the field which contains the Customers' Name is renamed "m$mainContent$customerForm$name" I understand where this comes from, "m" is the ID of my Master Page, "mainContent" is the main Content Placeholder and "customerForm" is the name of the User Control. In fact, in my case, this will always remain the same on all forms, so it is relative easy to overcome... but... suppose it wasn't I can see there are ways I could deal with this with Javascript, but the form doesn't need an AJAX submit, a normal Post will do fine for this, so when I open up the recieving page I want to call Request.Form("name")% to save the customer's name into the database, but of course I really need Request.Form("m$mainContent$customerForm$name")% How would I dynamically extract those prefixes from the posting form to ensure that if I rename anything or use it in a different scenario, the problem will not break it? I am using .NET 2.0, so can't use Static Client.

 If someone knows a better and working way to do what I want to do I will be grateful. P.S: Please post a code response because I don't really understand Java and Android very well. Thank you! LOGCAT HERE: 11-28 22:45:11.521: D/ddm-heap(221): Got feature list request

@LINK:/questions/8300331/php-whats-the-point-of-upload-err-ini-size
@TITLE:PHP: What's the point of UPLOAD_ERR_INI_SIZE?
@CONTENT:The PHP manual has a section called Handling file uploads. That section has a subsection called Error Messages Explained. That subsection describes an error called "UPLOAD_ERR_INI_SIZE": Value: 1; The uploaded file exceeds the upload_max_filesize directive in php.ini. However, in my experience, it's impossible to ever check for this particular error using UPLOAD_ERR_INI_SIZE because if a user ever does upload a file that exceeds the upload_max_filesize directive in php.ini, the $_FILES superglobal is empty. Want to test it for yourself? Save this as "upload_test.php" and then try to upload a file that's under the limit and then a file that's over the limit: <?php

    if (isset($_GET['submitted']) && $_GET['submitted'] === 'true')
    {
        echo 'Contents of $_POST:<hr><pre>';
        print_r($_POST);
        echo '</pre><hr>Contents of $_FILES:<hr><pre>';
        print_r($_FILES);
        echo '</pre><hr>';
        exit;
    }

    $max_filesize_in_mib = min((int)(ini_get('upload_max_filesize')), (int)(ini_get('post_max_size')), (int)(ini_get('memory_limit')));

?>
<!DOCTYPE html>

    <head>
        <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
        <title>PHP Upload Test</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Upload a File (Maximum File Size: <?php echo $max_filesize_in_mib; ?> MiB)</h1>
        <form action="upload_test.php?submitted=true" enctype="multipart/form-data" method="post">
            <input type="file" name="upload_test">
            <input type="hidden" name="random_field" value="You should see this field in the $_POST superglobal.">
            <input type="submit" value="Upload">
        </form>
    </body>
</html>
 So my question is this: what's the point of UPLOAD_ERR_INI_SIZE if you can never check for it?
@CODE:<?php

    if (isset($_GET['submitted']) && $_GET['submitted'] === 'true')
    {
        echo 'Contents of $_POST:<hr><pre>';
        print_r($_POST);
        echo '</pre><hr>Contents of $_FILES:<hr><pre>';
        print_r($_FILES);
        echo '</pre><hr>';
        exit;
    }

    $max_filesize_in_mib = min((int)(ini_get('upload_max_filesize')), (int)(ini_get('post_max_size')), (int)(ini_get('memory_limit')));

?>

@TITLE:Change HTML DropDown Default Value with a MySQL value
@CONTENT:I'm working on a profile page, where a registered user can update their information. Because the user has already submitted their information, I would like their information from the database to populate my HTML form. Within PHP, I'm creating the HTML form with the values filled in.

@LINK:/questions/8298679/accessviolation-exception-with-tapi-and-windows-service
@TITLE:AccessViolation exception with TAPI and Windows Service
@CONTENT:I will try to make this as short and sweet as I possibly can. I have created an application that is used by my company to call about 2000 different phone numbers each day (used to contact very old devices we have deployed around the US), When I run the application as a Windows Application (written using C# and JulMar ITAPI3 wrapper) the application seems to run rock solid with no issues which tells me at least my code is mostly right.... The problem I am encountering is when I run the same code as a Windows Service (create new project and simply call into the phone dialing library like the windows app does) The service will run for some period of time (varies each time) and then will finally crash. I look at the event log and see that it is an AccessViolation (0xc0000005) in the application. I have a try catch around my call into the tapi wrapper where the exception is happening but the catch never gets hit, I am assuming that it just crashes the app before it can get back to that point. So in a nutshell, Tapi application works great when run as Windows Application but when run as a Windows Service (running under local system) eventually fails with AccessViolation error that is not caught by the try catch around the "offending" function call. Any thoughts? This is running on Windows Server 2008 if that helps any. EDIT 1: I have tried running this service as several different types of user accounts including local user account, domain account, local system. All of them error out. I have posted a snippet from the event log for one of the failures below.       Application: EaglePolloutWindowsService.exe

 Thanks to everyone for their help so far and in the future. Edit 2: I have given up trying to resolve this issue. My best guess is that it stems from an issue with how JulMar is handling some of the COM objects being created in the wrapper. I convinced my company to pay for a license for TraySoft AddTapi .NET and it is working just fine now.... Thanks everyone.

@TITLE:JSON2 Error / Conflict with another script
@CONTENT:I am using the JSON2 library in order to use JSON.stringify to send some JSON data to my MVC controller. When I include another script in my view (Telerik MVC) I start to get script conflicts when using IE7. When I click the refresh button in the grid, I get the following error: Line: 191
Error: Object doesn't support this property or method

String.prototype.toJSON      =
    Number.prototype.toJSON  =
    Boolean.prototype.toJSON = function (key) {
        return this.valueOf();
    };
 The error occurs on the following line specifically: return this.valueOf();
 Does anyone have any insight into why this conflict is occurring and how to resolve it? Specifically, why would this work in IE8/Chrome but fail in IE7. What would cause the error? Are both scripts trying to define the same method and that's why it is failing or is it impossible to tell without digging through tons of code? Edit: This is the json2.js library I am speaking of: https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js

@TITLE:jqGrid reload other grids after edit
@CONTENT:first, I apologize for my english. I have 4 grids displaying data from different sql query results. They are categorized by their status. All the grids are working fine but there's one thing that I want to do but I just can't figure out how to do it. I wanted the other grids to refresh after successful edit. jqGrid only refreshes the current grid i'm currently editing, which is good, but I ended up refreshing the entire page to see the changed item on the other grid. I have used .trigger("reloadGrid"); but this doesn't seem to work. How can i achieve this? please help. many thanks. This is the jqGrid: $('#diag').jqGrid({
        url: 'ajax/ajax-diag.php',
        data: 'xml',

@TITLE:Override jQuery plugin function like in jQuery UI
@CONTENT:I know this question has gone round a couple of times now but the answers don't seem to be exactly what I am looking for. Say I have a plugin called "jdropdown" that looks like: (function($){
    var options = {},
    methods = {},
    renderItem = function(){},

    $.fn.jdropdown = function(method){
        // plugin method despatcher
    });
 })(jQuery);
 Now when declaring the plugin I want to allow the user to override the renderItem function in the plugin. I have noticed that jQuery UI gets around this by allowing item access through the data attribute (as can be seem in this example: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#custom-data) but whenever I try and make something like this myself I come to a dead end. I have read the "Data" section of: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring to no avail (They don't really describe how stuff works that well, they just write a lot of 'FTW' and state why it is useful). Is there anyone who can show me how to use the data attribute of my element (plugin anchor) to access the plugins methods to override them like so: $('.someThing').jdropdown().data('jdropdown').renderItem = function(){}
 Thanks,
@CODE:(function($){
    var options = {},
    methods = {},
    renderItem = function(){},

    $.fn.jdropdown = function(method){
        // plugin method despatcher
    });
 })(jQuery); renderItem $('.someThing').jdropdown().data('jdropdown').renderItem = function(){}

@TITLE:Spring security blocks user after failed login
@CONTENT:I'm using spring-security 3. I tried to login to the application and filled with the wrong user/pass combination. After 3 wrong attempts, I filled with the right user/pass combination, but it still returns: Your login attempt was not successful, try again.
Reason: Bad credentials
 On develop that's (kind of) OK because I just restart the server and can login fine, but on production I can't restart the server every time somebody forgets his/her password. I thought that maybe waiting after the timeout I could still login, but that doesn't work either. app-security-web.xml <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

@LINK:/questions/8295096/lighttpd-rewrite-for-wordpress-inside-cakephp
@TITLE:Lighttpd rewrite for Wordpress inside CakePHP
@CONTENT:I'm having problems to setup Lighttpd rewrite rule for a Wordpress instalation that is located inside a CakePHP app. The folder structure looks like this: var/
    www/
        app/
            webroot/
                blog/
        cake/
        vendors/
 The cakePHP app works fine. If I try to access http://domain.tld, it loads the app front page. Any attempt to access a controller/action also works fine. The problem happens when I try to load any wordpress post. The url structure to access a WP post is this: http://domain.tld/blog/post/post-slug What I have right now on /etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf is this $HTTP["host"] == "domain.tld" {
    server.document-root        = "/var/www/app/webroot/"
    url.rewrite-once = (
        "/(css|files|img|js|php)/(.*)" => "/$1/$2",
        "^([^\?]*)(\?(.+))?$" => "/index.php?url=$1&$3",
    )
}

$HTTP["url"] == "domain.tld/blog/" {
    server.document-root        = "/var/www/app/webroot/blog/"
    url.rewrite-final = (
        "^/(wp-admin|wp-includes|wp-content|gallery2)/(.*)" => "$0",
        "^/(.*.php)" => "$0",
        "^/(.*)$" => "/index.php/$1"
    )
}
 When I try to open a blog post, it opens a page that seems to be a broken cake action. It loads the cake default view (header and footer), but there is nothing on the main part. Which means that it is calling a controller/action. If I turn on the debug Configure::write('debug', 2) to see what is happening, I get the following error: Fatal error: Class 'Debugger' not found in /var/www/cake/libs/i18n.php on line 107 On any other part of the app the debugger works fine. There are only two ways to access a WP post. Using the default WP permanent link settings (domain.tld/blog/?p=123) or setting the server.document-root="/var/www/app/webroot/blog/", but in this case the cakePHP app won't be available. Note: Everything works fine if I use Apache.

@CONTENT:It is possible to remove ID's from pages being renedered in .NET. This can be done by simply setting the ID tag of an element with the attribute runat="server" to null. Obviously this shouldn't be done for controls that have to be evaluated / used on postback scenarios. I am very curious on how widely removing ID's will be used by people knowing this can be done. I know that by removing ID values you are able to save some bandwith, but what should be a reason to start using this method?

@TITLE:KVO observing of NSMangedObject in a UITableViewCell
@CONTENT:I'm using a custom UITableViewCell to display properties of a NSMangedObject from my model. Each cell holds a reference to the managed object. I also listen to changes in properties of the object by calling addObserver:K on the object. The problem is that the objects can be removed from the model, and I want to unregister when this happens. There is a similar question here, but the suggested solution there is to use prepareForDeletion on the object, and then manually notify the cells. This is not a very pretty solution. I was wondering what is the recommended solution for these cases, and more then that - is observing KVO changes on the managed object is indeed the best approach to what I am trying to achieve.

@CONTENT:In my app I want to check if windows from others apps are resizable. I?m using the accessibility API to test if the window has the kAXGrowAreaAttribute attribute (if NULL is not resizable) as Peter Hosey answered in this question. The problem is that the kAXGrowAreaAttribute returned value is always NULL it doesn?t matter if the window is resizable or not. Note: to retrieve the value I?m using the UIElementUtilities class from the Apple UIElementInspector example (I also have tried using AXUIElementCopyAttributeValue directly with the same result). Any idea? I?m working in Lion, could be this the problem? Thanks in advance. EDITED: Playing around with the UIElementUtilities class methods I found a solution. Just use the method + (BOOL)canSetAttribute:(NSString *)attributeName ofUIElement:(AXUIElementRef)element with the kAXSizeAttribute and the focused window. It returns YES or NO depending if the window is sizable or not...
@CODE:+ (BOOL)canSetAttribute:(NSString *)attributeName ofUIElement:(AXUIElementRef)element

@TITLE:Express authentication - cannot send headers after sent
@CONTENT:I have created a function that restricts route access by verifying that a stored session user/pass matches what is in the database var checkAuth = function(req, res, next){
  if(typeof(req.session.user) === 'undefined') {
    req.session.user = { name: '', pass: '', loggedIn: false }
  }
  $R.user.validateLogin(req.session.user, function(err){
    if(err) res.redirect('/login')
    else {
      req.session.user.loggedIn = true
      next()
    }
  })
}

app.get('/restricted', checkAuth, function(req, response){
  response.render('index')
})
 It seems to work fine as it will redirect to the /login page if a person is not athenticated, but immediately after redirecting the app shuts down with the error Error: Can't set headers after they are sent. I have traced the error down to the res.redirect('/login') but can't figure out how to remedy my error. EDIT: My login route handler app.get('/login', function(req, response){
  $R.page.addStyles(['forms','user/user'])
  response.render('user/login')
})
app.post('/login', function(req, response){
  $R.user.validateLogin(req.body, function(err, res){
    if(err) response.end(JSON.stringify({error: err.message}))
    else {
      req.session.user = req.body
      response.end(JSON.stringify({ok: true}))
    }
  })

@TITLE:chrome extension: Injecting code which references a script that I am also injecting - why it fails?
@CONTENT:I am trying to create a jquery popup on any page, triggered on demand, when the user presses on my chrome extension. I have permissions set to [ "tabs", "http:///", "https:///" ] I have a background page which tries to do the following: chrome.browserAction.onClicked.addListener(function(tab) {

//chrome.tabs.executeScript(null, { code: "alert(document.title);" }, null);

chrome.tabs.executeScript(null, {file: "demo.js"}, null);

chrome.tabs.executeScript(null, { code: "document.body.appendChild(document.createElement('script')).src='demo.js'" }, null);
      });
 If I uncomment the alert, it appears when I click on the extension icon. But with the comment as it is it doesn't do anything. Any thoughts why it fails? UPDATE I managed to get it working, by referencing a url and not a local resource(demo.js). Now the code, that works, looks like this: chrome.tabs.executeScript(tab.id, { code: "document.body.appendChild(document.createElement('script')).src='http://iamnotagoodartist.com/stuff/wikiframe.js'" }, null); 
 My local "demo.js" was a copy of the content from that url anyway. I am not sure why it doesn't work when I reference the local file... ?

@CONTENT:Question: Where are comparisons being made in each separate sorting method?

 Okay so to explain some parts, basically Array A is an array from 1-100 in ascending order. So this should be the minimum number of comparisons. Array B is 100-1 in descending order. So I believe it should be the maximum number of comparisons. Array C is just randomly generated numbers, so it changes every time. I feel like my selection and bubble sorts were counted correctly. Feel free to let me know where comparisons are being made that I haven't counted, or if I'm counting wrong comparisons.

@TITLE:Different indexing and search strategies on same field without doubling index size?
@CONTENT:For a phrase search, we want to bring up results only if there's an exact match (without ignoring stopwords). If it's a non-phrase search, we are fine displaying results even if the root form of the word matches etc. We currently pass our data through standardTokenizer, StopFilter, PorterStemFilter and LowerCaseFilter. Due to this when user wants to search for "password management", search brings up results containing "password manager". If I remove StemFilter, then I will not be able to match for the root form of the word for non-phrase queries. I was thinking if I should index the same data as part of two fields in document. For the first field (to be used for phrase searches), following tokenizers/filters will be used: StandardTokenizer, LowerCaseFilter For the second field (Non-phrase searches) StandardTokenizer, StopFilter, PorterStemFilter, LowerCaseFilter Now, based on whether it's a phrase search or not, I need to rewrite user's query to search in the appropriate field. Is this the right way to address this issue? Is there any other way to achieve this without doubling index size? let's say user's query is summary:"Furthermore, we should also fix this" Internally this will be translated to summary_field1:"Furthermore, we should also fix this" If user's query is summary:(Furthermore, we should also fix this) Internally this will be translated to +summary_field2:furthermor +summary_field2:we +summary_field2:should +summary_field2:also +summary_field2:fix both summary_field1 and summary_field2 index the same data. summary_field1 passes through only StandardTokenizer and LowerCaseFilter, whereas summary_field2 passes through StandardTokenizer, StopFilter, PorterStemFilter and LowerCaseFilter. Please let me know if I'm missing something here.
@CODE:summary:"Furthermore, we should also fix this" summary_field1:"Furthermore, we should also fix this" summary:(Furthermore, we should also fix this) +summary_field2:furthermor +summary_field2:we +summary_field2:should +summary_field2:also +summary_field2:fix

@TITLE:creating class instances from a text file in python
@CONTENT:I have a polynomial class: class Polynomial:
    def __init__(self, *termpairs):
        self.termdict = dict(termpairs)
 To add an instance to this class, you enter the following: P = Polynomial((3,2), (4,5), (9,8))
 Now I'm trying to create a function that reads information from a text file, and from that text file, it creates an instance of the Polynomial class. The information is stored in the text file like this: 4 6
2 3
9 8
3 5
0 42
 So far, the function looks like this: def read_file(polyfilename):
    polyfilename = open("polyfilename.txt", "r")
    poly1 = polyfilename.read()
    polyfilename.close()
    poly1 = [line.split() for line in poly1.split("\n")]
    poly1 = [[int(y) for y in x] for x in poly1]
    for item in poly1:
        return Polynomial(item)
 It only creates a Polynomial instance for the first pair in the text file, how can I make a Polynomial instance for all of the pairings in the text file? EDIT: I now have this as my function: def read_file(polyfilename):
    polyfilename = open("polyfilename.txt", "r")
    poly = polyfilename.read()
    polyfilename.close()
    poly = [line.split() for line in poly.split("\n")]
    poly = [[int(y) for y in x] for x in poly]
    return Polynomial(poly[0], poly[1], poly[2], poly[3], poly[4])
 It gives me the answer I'm looking for, however, the length of these text files can vary, so typing poly[1], poly[2] won't work. Is there a way I can go through each index no matter what the length is?
@CODE:class Polynomial:
    def __init__(self, *termpairs):

@LINK:/questions/8291505/how-to-view-xsddocumentation-that-is-in-html-markup
@TITLE:How to view xsd:documentation that is in HTML markup?
@CONTENT:I am generating WSDL/XSD for SOAP services from a UML model using IBM Rational Software Architect (RSA). RSA allows you to document the classes and attributes in the model using rich-formatting. For example, I have the following documentation on a Trailer class: A wheeled Vehicle that is designed for towing by another Vehicle. Known subtypes include: Caravan BoxTrailer BoatTrailer When the UML model is transformed to WSDL/XSD (using the out-of-the-box UML to WSDL transform), the formatting is preserved as HTML markup inside the xsd:documentation element:   <xsd:complexType name="Trailer">
    <xsd:annotation>
      <xsd:documentation>&lt;p&gt;
    A&amp;nbsp;wheeled &lt;strong&gt;Vehicle&lt;/strong&gt; that is designed for&amp;nbsp;towing by another &lt;strong&gt;Vehicle.&lt;/strong&gt; Known
    subtypes include:&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;Caravan&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;BoxTrailer&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;BoatTrailer&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</xsd:documentation>
    </xsd:annotation>
  </xsd:complexType>
 Unfortunately, this is really hard to read and I've been searching (with no luck) for a program that can view WSDL/XSD with documentation in HTML markup. XmlSpy 2008 can't do it, RSA can't do it (which is a bit surprising, as it generated the XSD in the first place), neither can any web browser I've tried. I did write a JET template that extracted the documentation from the model and outputted to HTML, and I could probably write some XSLT to do something similar from the XSD, but I was hoping there's a program out there (ideally free) that could view the documentation as HTML. Essentially, I'd like to be able to tell the consumers of our web service that they can view the WSDL in X program if they want to read the documentation - does anybody know the best solution to this? Edit: Thanks for the suggestions, but I think I have a solution! I didn't realise that RSA can export a WSDL to HTML (right-click on WSDL, export, HTML). The generated HTML has a graphical view of each schema element, the documentation for each element, as well as the original source, and everything is hyperlinked together. Most importantly, the documentation is richly-formatted again! One small caveat is that the ;nbsp's appear in the HTML output. This seems to be because the ampersand is escaped in the HTML: &amp;nbsp; Instead it should be &nbsp; I will update my model-to-model transform to ensure that the ;nbsp's are replaced with real spaces (I don't believe I'll need non-breaking spaces in the documentation), so the generated WSDL/XSD won't ever have them.

@TITLE:Sencha Touch TabBar + page navigation. Why it's breaking?
@CONTENT:I'm a newbie to SenchaTouch. I have started working on an App and the results are this until now: http://mobz.com.br:86. (based on the Sencha-Touch-tabs-and-toolbars-demo) Now I started playing with it and I have difficulties to set things strait in my head. I have lot of JQuery experience, but regarding the design of this library, the coin haven't dropped yet. I got a TabPanel with 5 sections. I will focus only in one section cause there where my problem is. The Problem As you can see in my app, when one clicks an item of ingressos (tickets in English), the app loads the second panel, but load it with bugs. It loads it without the title bar, without the Back button, and also add an empty sixth button on the right. But if I load the second panel first, when the page loads, it loads without any UI issues. My Code First I declare my ViewPort Mobz.views.Viewport = Ext.extend(Ext.TabPanel, {
    fullscreen: true,
    initComponent: function() {
        Ext.apply(this, {
            tabBar: {
                dock: 'bottom',
                layout: {
                    pack: 'center'
                }
            },
            items: [
                { xtype: 'destaques', id: 'home' },
                { xtype: 'ingressos' },
                { xtype: 'mobilizacoes' },
                { xtype: 'locais' },
                { xtype: 'minhaconta' }
            ]
        });
        Mobz.views.Viewport.superclass.initComponent.apply(this, arguments);
    }
});
 Than after, at the ingressos.js file, I define the tab. First I got the panel that will load the items into it. Mobz.views.Ingressos = Ext.extend(Ext.Panel, {
    id: "ingressos",
    title: "Ingressos", //title of the page
    iconCls: "arrow_right", // icon of the tab at the bottom
    styleHtmlContent: true,
    fullscreen: true,
    layout: 'card',
    initComponent: function () {
        Ext.apply(this, {
            dockedItems: [{
                xtype: "toolbar",
                title: "Ingressos"
            }],
            items: [Mobz.views.IngressosList]
        });
        Mobz.views.Ingressos.superclass.initComponent.apply(this, arguments);
    }
});
Ext.reg('ingressos', Mobz.views.Ingressos);
 This is the initial item that load into the panel. Mobz.views.IngressosList = new Ext.List({
    id: 'ingressoslist',
    itemTpl: IngressosList_Template,
    store: Mobz.stores.IngressosStore,
    onItemTap: function (subIdx) {
        //Mobz.views.IngressoCinemaList.update(subIdx);
        Mobz.views.viewport.setActiveItem(Mobz.views.IngressoCinemaList, { type: 'slide', direction: 'left' });
    }
});
 And that's the second panel. The panel where the first panel goes to. Mobz.views.IngressoTitle = new Ext.Panel({
    id: 'ingressotitle',
    tpl: IngressoTitle_Template,
    data: Mobz.stores.IngressoTitle_Store
});
Mobz.views.IngressoCinemaList = new Ext.List({
    id: 'ingressocinemalist',
    itemTpl: IngressoCinemaList_Template,
    store: Mobz.stores.IngressoCinemaListStore,
    flex: 1, grouped: true,
    dockedItems: [{
            xtype: 'toolbar',
            items: [{
                text: 'Back',
                ui: 'back',
                handler: function () {
                    Mobz.views.viewport.setActiveItem(Mobz.ingressos, { type: 'slide', direction: 'right' });
                }
            }]
        }
    ],
    onItemDisclosure: function () {
        app.views.viewport.setActiveItem(Mobz.views.IngressosHorario, { type: 'slide', direction: 'left' });
    }
});
Mobz.views.Ingresso = new Ext.Panel({
    id: 'ingresso',
    layout: {
        type: 'vbox',
        align: 'fit'
    },
    items: [Mobz.views.IngressoHorario_IngressoECinemaTitles, Mobz.views.IngressoCinemaList]
});
 That's it. I hope some of you guys will have the patient to read all my code examples. I'll appreciate any help. Shlomi.

@TITLE:Flex 4.5 How do you check for JSON child node key existence (using hasOwnProperty or other methods)
@CONTENT:How do you check for JSON child node key existence using hasOwnProperty (or other methods) in Flex 4.5? The hasOwnProperty method can check for JSON key existence but this seems to only work with top level nodes in a JSON, and not the child nodes. For example, if you have JSON structure like this (in a readable form, sans the JSON syntax), you can check for the existence of callresponder.lastResponse.hasOwnKey("Location"), but there seems no way to check for Location.VenueName for example or any of the children: 
Name: 
Location: 
  (child) VenueName: 
  (child) Address: 
      (child) City: 
      (child) State: 
  .
  .
  . (etc)
 The issue is that my data source omits the child key when the information is not available, so it would be nice to be able to check for the existence of the JSON key in a reference in Flex before doing anything else for it. The obvious callresponder.lastResponse.hasOwnKey("Location.VenueName") does not work. Q: How would I check if the JSON key Location.VenueName exists?
@CODE:hasOwnProperty callresponder.lastResponse.hasOwnKey("Location") Location.VenueName callresponder.lastResponse.hasOwnKey("Location.VenueName") Location.VenueName hasOwnProperty

@CONTENT:The key of table items is comprised of (lang, id). Some items have a translated name in different languages. I want to create such a query that would return all the items from the DB in a given language and if an item doesn't have a translation to return the untranslated value. Say I want to get all items written in Bulgarian. This is where I'm stuck: SELECT lang, id, name
FROM items
WHERE lang = "bg" OR lang = "en"
GROUP BY id
 The problem arises when there is an item, say, (1, "en") and an item (1, "bg"). The ids are the same. Then how does MySQL or SQLite determine which result to return? Is there any way I can tell it that I would rather prefer to return (1, "bg") if it exists but if it doesn't then (1, "en") would satisfy me? P.S. To further illustrate what I want let's imagine that the database contains the following entries with schema (id, lang, name): (1, "en", "abc") (2, "en", "cde") (3, "en", "def") (1, "bg", "???") (3, "bg", "???") After executing the desired query for Bulgarian I should get: (1, "bg", "???") (2, "en", "cde") (3, "bg", "???")

 But when i try to style single instance of user control nothing happens. I tried this from stylesheet, like this .PH1

}
 and from C#, like this protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) { PlaceHolderCMS1.Attributes["style"] = "width=" + width + "%; height:" + height + "px;" ;
 } So my question is how can I put style attributes for instances of my Custom Control? I want to have general styles for entire control, and override them for particular instances if needed. Thank you in advance....

@TITLE:collision testing with multiple objects on stage
@CONTENT:I'm trying to create a sort of tree diagram such that, if you click on one of the circles, its child circles spread outward with some degree of randomness from the original circle, connected by lines. I have this working, but now what I want to do is make sure that none of the circles collide with each other and none of the lines criss cross. You can see the screenshot for what is currently happening. My code is below. How do I change this code so that it checks for collisions and avoids them?

@CONTENT:I have a loading screen for my app (default.png). When user suspends my app, I thought that iOS would automatically take a screenshot and use it as a loading screen when my app is resumed? If I implement this... http://pastebin.com/P0w9GJrB ... won't I overwrite my loadingscreen? I mean if I have a lotta stuff on my view, the user presses homebutton and my app goes to the background. I save the screenshot. Now the user terminates my app. Next time he run my app, won't he load the saved screenshot instead of my original loading image? Reason I'm asking is, that if user forces my app to terminate, then he should see a clean loading screen when starting up my app instead of a messy saved screenshot? Thanks all. Mojo

@TITLE:What's the best way to add HTML dynamically with JQuery?
@CONTENT:I have the following HTML: <div id="dynamicRadioButtons">



</div>
 Using jQuery I'd like to append a radio button with corresponding label to the above div. An example of the HTML I'd like to append is as follows: <input type="radio" id="dynamicRadio" name="radio" /><label for="dynamicRadio">My Label</label> <br>
 So, lets say I have a function that's called when I click something and takes the parameters id (which is the id of the radio button to be created) and labelText (which is the text of the label to be created), I want to be able to do something like this: function OnClick(id, labelText){

    // create a new radio button using supplied parameters
    var $newRadioBtn = $('<input />').attr({type="radio", id=id, name="radio"});

    // create a new radio button using supplied parameters
    // TODO - set the value of the label to parameter: labelText
    var $newLabel = $('<label />').attr({for=id});

    // TODO - append the new radio button and label to the div and then append <br>...
    $('#dynamicRadioButtons').append(/* The elements I want to append */);    
}
 Can someone help me with my TODO bits please? I was following an example as per this page but just don't know enough about jQuery to add the label etc. Also is this the best way to dynamically add HTML elements?
@CODE:<div id="dynamicRadioButtons">



</div> <input type="radio" id="dynamicRadio" name="radio" /><label for="dynamicRadio">My Label</label> <br> function OnClick(id, labelText){

    // create a new radio button using supplied parameters
    var $newRadioBtn = $('<input />').attr({type="radio", id=id, name="radio"});

    // create a new radio button using supplied parameters
    // TODO - set the value of the label to parameter: labelText
    var $newLabel = $('<label />').attr({for=id});

    // TODO - append the new radio button and label to the div and then append <br>...

@CONTENT:I followed the steps in BalusC's answer at JSF 2.0 File upload. The only step in which I went differently is the Tomahawk upload link in the answer. The link is broken, so I got tomahawk-1.1.11 from another place. When I try to start Tomcat 7.0.14 from Eclipse I get the following error: java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: 
javax.servlet.ServletContext.getServletRegistrations()Ljava/util/Map;
 And Tomcat doesn't start. Any ideas? Also, the answer in the link is from March. Any developments with file upload in JSF 2?

 The answer I wanted for the Cost is the sum of all the C's (total distance) between a and d.The above code is not working, it is not allowing me to take a new variable, Can please somebody do the changes in the above code so that i can get the total distance in Cost.Please keep in mind that I am new to prolog,Thanks!

@TITLE:Where are scripts loaded after an ajax call? (redux)
@CONTENT:in a previous SO post a solution was found to the issue of dynamically loading pages with embedded <script> tags. however, it was not a comprehensive solution, as I've come to find. The scenario that breaks the code (please review previous post and its solution), is something that looks like this: - svc.html - <script type="text/javascript" src="/plugin.js" css="/plugin.css"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
plugin_method();
</script>

<div id='inner'>
dynamically loaded content
</div>
 where plugin.js looks the same as before but contains a function definition for plugin_method. The problem seems to be that when the script node is added to the document: target[0].appendChild(scriptNode);
 the code is not executed immediately. If (as in the previous post) there is only one script tag in the svc.html page, everything is fine, but once there is a second one, the $('script:last') in the plugin no longer points to the correct script, and therefore fails to load the stylesheet. furthermore, the body of the second script tag seems to get executed before sourcing-in the code for the first, such that the method call fails (since the function hasn't been defined yet). I've found a couple of links, which I'm mulling over: http://requirejs.org/docs/why.html http://unixpapa.com/js/dyna.html ideas anyone?
@CODE:<script> <script type="text/javascript" src="/plugin.js" css="/plugin.css"></script>

@CONTENT:I am trying to solve my question regarding using push_back in more than one level. From the comments/answers it is clear that I have to: Create a copy operator which takes a const argument Modify all my operators to const But because this header file is given to me there is an operator what I cannot make into const. It is a simple: float & operator [] (int i) {
    return _item[i];
}
 In the given program, this operator is used to get and set data. My problem is that because I need to have this operator in the header file, I cannot turn all the other operators to const, what means I cannot insert a copy operator. How can I make all my operators into const, while preserving the functionality of the already written program? Here is the full declaration of the class: class Vector3f {

    float _item[3];

    public:

    float & operator [] (int i) {
        return _item[i];
        }

    Vector3f(float x, float y, float z) 
    {  _item[0] = x ; _item[1] = y ; _item[2] = z; };

    Vector3f() {};

    Vector3f & operator = ( const Vector3f& obj) 
    {
        _item[0] = obj[0];
        _item[1] = obj[1];
        _item[2] = obj[2];

        return *this;
    };

    Vector3f & operator += ( const Vector3f & obj) 
    {
        _item[0] += obj[0];
        _item[1] += obj[1];
        _item[2] += obj[2];

        return *this;
    };

    bool operator ==( const Vector3f & obj) {
        bool x = (_item[0] == obj[0]) && (_item[1] == obj[1]) && (_item[2] == obj[2]);
        return x;
    }


    // my copy operator
    Vector3f(const Vector3f& obj) {
        _item[0] += obj[0];
        _item[1] += obj[1];
        _item[2] += obj[2];

        return this;
    }

};
@CODE:float & operator [] (int i) {
    return _item[i];
} class Vector3f {

    float _item[3];

    public:

        bool x = (_item[0] == obj[0]) && (_item[1] == obj[1]) && (_item[2] == obj[2]);
        return x;

    // my copy operator

We have an active directory domain up and running, so I plan to authenticate and authorize users according to their username and groups they are in.

Secondly, I need to store additional info about each user. The problem is that I can't modify AD scheme. The number of added fields is about 10 or so. Can I somehow use SQL server for profile storage? Of course I can, but how to tie this with AD auth?

@TITLE:Black Screen using ScrollView + RelativeLayout and a costum View (acting like a canvas)
@CONTENT:I am trying to develop a block representation with inputs and outputs. The main ideia is: A user can add outputs/inputs A user can edit the ouputs/inputs added So we have something like this: I managed to build a dynamic canvas that changes when the user presses one of the buttons (the painted area grows). The problem starts when the canvas is bigger than screen height. The result is something like this: Notice that I have a scroll view. However it seems that scrollview puts everything in black.

@CONTENT:there are plenty of tutorials showing how to blend two images in opencv: http://opencv.itseez.com/doc/tutorials/core/adding_images/adding_images.html http://aishack.in/tutorials/transparent-image-overlays-in-opencv/ But all of them are based on this equation: which means that I will be combining two images by averaging them and consequently I'll be loosing intensity on both images. For instance, let alpha = 0.5, f0(x) = 255, and f1(x) = 0. After applying this equation, the result image g(x) = 127. That is not what I need. The first image should remain unchanged. And the transparency must be applied in the second one. My problem is: the first image f0(x) should not be changed and an alpha should be applied to the second image f1(x) when it overlays the first image f0(x). I cannot figure out how to do this. Any help?

@TITLE:how to show filtered jqgrid with search toolbar prefilled using single call to retrieve data
@CONTENT:I'm looking for a way to show jqgrid with search toolbar pre-filled and data filtered by this toolbar. I tried code below but this makes two requests to retrieve data. First request retrieves unfiltered data and only second request retrieves proper data. How to eliminate first request so that filtered data is retrieved and search toolbar is pre-filled immediately ? var grid = $("#grid"),
    notLoaded= true;
grid.jqGrid({
datatype: "json",
mtype: 'POST',
   loadComplete: function() { 
     $("#gs_Name").val('<%= Request.QueryString["Name"] %>');
     if (notLoaded) {
       setTimeout( function() {
         $("#grid")[0].triggerToolbar();
         }, 100 );
       notLoaded = false;
       }
     }
 });
 Update I tried to fill search toolbar using search criteria passed from query string $(function () {
    var grid = $("#grid"),
        urlFilters;
    var namedParameters = window.location.href.slice(window.location.href.indexOf('?') + 1).split('&'),
        parameters = {}, 
        nameAndValue, 
        i; 
    for (i = 0; i < namedParameters.length; i += 1) { 
        nameAndValue = namedParameters[i].split('='); 
        parameters[nameAndValue[0]] = decodeURIComponent(nameAndValue[1]); 
        if (nameAndValue[0] === "filters") { 
            urlFilters= decodeURIComponent(nameAndValue[1]); 
        } 
    } 

    grid.jqGrid({
     postData: { filters: urlFilters }, 
     search:true, 
     loadComplete: function() { 
         refreshSearchingToolbar( $(this), 'eq');
         }
     ...
 Search toolbar is empty if grid is loaded but grid is filtered and find dialog is filled properly. Search toolbar is also filled if find dialog is opened. Debugger shows that in refreshSearchingToolbar condition if (typeof (postData.filters) === "string" &&
                        typeof ($grid[0].ftoolbar) === "boolean" && $grid[0].ftoolbar) {
 if not satisfied: ftoolbar is undefined. I removed this check but after that got error at line tagName = control[0].tagName.toUpperCase(); about undefined tagName How to fix this ?

         }, 100 );
       notLoaded = false;
       }
     }

 I also have a Player class. I wanted to make it so that when I click the button, the player method's Jump() is called. I suppose I could just link the Player class with the button. But then I realized that the button class is going to have many other uses, and not just letting my player jump. (ie: a menu selector? make the player move? etc.) So I was thinking of including some kind of a callback, but I'm not too familiar with them and I'm having trouble understanding some tutorials I've read. Could someone show me how I would use the selected() method to take in any function/method as a parameter and execute it in the method body?

@CONTENT:I was programming some not ambitious, small programs in my school in Dev C++ for ages now in school. But now it came out i need to make a window application. I saw some people using visual studio for that. Few days ago i got Visual Studio C++ express, and i after a while of coding, after few lines i realized it differs much from "normal" C++ i was using so far. Even declarations of strings are giving me headache. I wanted to ask, if maybe visual c# would be more similar to what i know, or maybe there is some other way for me, to code window application in C++ i know, using drag and drop interface, when it comes to creating buttons, textboxes and stuff (like in visual studio)? So most importantly, is Visual c# more like "normal" c++, and if not, do you guys got any suggestions to replace Visual? any help appreciated.

Here is the code I'm using: private void Form1_Paint(object sender, PaintEventArgs e) {

    Bitmap bm = new Bitmap("fruit-dealer-full.jpg");

    Graphics g1 = this.CreateGraphics();
    Graphics g2 = e.Graphics;

    // g1.DrawImage(bm, 0, 0, this.Width, this.Height);
    // g1.DrawRectangle(
    //       Pens.White, 10.0f, 10.0f, this.Width - 200, this.Height - 200);

    g2.DrawImage(bm, 0, 0, this.Width, this.Height);
    g2.DrawRectangle(
           Pens.White, 10.0f, 10.0f, this.Width - 200, this.Height - 200);

}
 Ultimately I just want to gain a better understanding of what's happening here, but specifically I have these three questions: Why does g1 redraw the image in the whole window, while g2 only draws the new portion, even if I call g2.Clear() before drawing? Why, with either Graphics object, is the image only redrawn when the window increases in size, and not when it is made smaller? If PaintEventArgs.Graphics can (or should) not be used for drawing, what is it used for? I would imagine it just prevents you from having to create a new Graphics instance if the form doesn't need to be redrawn; is there more to it that I'm missing?
@CODE:Paint Form PaintEventArgs Graphics System.Drawing.Graphics private void Form1_Paint(object sender, PaintEventArgs e) {

    Bitmap bm = new Bitmap("fruit-dealer-full.jpg");

    Graphics g1 = this.CreateGraphics();
    Graphics g2 = e.Graphics;

    // g1.DrawImage(bm, 0, 0, this.Width, this.Height);
    // g1.DrawRectangle(
    //       Pens.White, 10.0f, 10.0f, this.Width - 200, this.Height - 200);

    g2.DrawImage(bm, 0, 0, this.Width, this.Height);
    g2.DrawRectangle(
           Pens.White, 10.0f, 10.0f, this.Width - 200, this.Height - 200);

} g1 g2 g2.Clear() Graphics PaintEventArgs.Graphics Graphics

@TITLE:Basic networking: browsing to Rails site running on another machine
@CONTENT:I'm running a Rails site on computer A. I start the site with rails server and browse to it at http://localhost:3000. Computer B is on the same WIFI network. From computer B I can visit my site at http://192.x.y.z:3000 where the IPv4 address of computer A is obtained from ifconfig in the OS X Terminal. How can I browse to my site (running on computer A) from computer B without using the wireless router? I'll still have WIFI enabled on both computers. However I don't want the computers to communicate through the additional WIFI router. My current understanding is the WIFI router assigns IP addresses to the various devices on the network. In trying to answer my question I wondered who/what will assign IP addresses to the computers when the wireless router is removed. My goal is to learn more about networking. I'm fine doing some low-level sockets programming if that's what it takes.

 Here's what I've done so far. There's a hole in my logic somewhere and I could do with some help. I think it's something to do with the switcher which is trying to hold a number whilst another is being deleted.

@TITLE:iphone with sbjson framework cant parse json array
@CONTENT:Im facing some problem with json and objective c. Atm i am using sbJson framework (i can change framework if some tell me do it!) and im not being able to parse a json array. this is the json i want to parse, {"JsonEventosResult":
    [
        {"nombre":"Venta de Reposici?n NX13","id":34,"fecha":"16/09/2011"},
        {"nombre":"evento rose","id":37,"fecha":"04/10/2011"},
        {"nombre":"Prueba PhoneGap","id":40,"fecha":"23/11/2011"}
    ]
}
 this is my code on iphone: - (void)connectionDidFinishLoading:(NSURLConnection *)connection {      
[connection release];

NSString *responseString = [[NSString alloc] initWithData:responseData encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];
[responseData release];

NSError *error;
SBJSON *json = [[SBJSON new] autorelease];
NSArray *luckyNumbers = [json objectWithString:responseString error:&error];
[responseString release];   

if (luckyNumbers == nil)
    label.text = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"JSON parsing failed: %@", [error localizedDescription]];
else {      
    NSMutableString *text = [NSMutableString stringWithString:@"Lucky numbers:\n"];

    for (int i = 0; i < [luckyNumbers count]; i++) 
        [text appendFormat:@"%@\n", [luckyNumbers objectAtIndex:i]];

    label.text =  text;
}
}
 the error i get is that luckyNumbers is an array with 0 object. the sample i got if from http://mobileorchard.com/tutorial-json-over-http-on-the-iphone/ . so where is the problem? the json i get form service or the framework ? thx

 If I save the file attachment as Whatever.PDF i get the error that it was not encoded properly. Not sure what I need to do to have this work with PDF, have tried searching google but not finding anything that helps me. EDITED: I am using datadynamics active reports PDF exporter to generate the PDF dim pdf as new datadynamics.activereports.export.pdf.pdfexport
sendmail("from@", "to@", "test", "test", pdf.tostring, "pdf.pdf")
 I think the problem is I am converting the PDF to a string, and then trying to convert it back to a PDF and attach it to the email but I am not 100% sure. Thanks.

@TITLE:How to hide image custom field if empty
@CONTENT:I created an unordered list of custom fields and I wish to hide them if they are empty. For text custom fields I used the code: <?php if (get_field('phone') != '') { ?>
  <li><strong>Phone: </strong><?php the_field('phone'); ?></li>
<?php } ?>
 However, I have a custom field which is for images, like this: <li><strong>Logo: </strong><img src="<?php the_field('logo'); ?>"></img></li>
 How can I hide the field if no image was uploaded (obviously, the above code won't work)? Thanks in advance.

@TITLE:Display UISplitviewController In a PopOverViewController
@CONTENT:I was recently displaying a list of items to a user via a tableview in a popover when a button was tapped. The table was displayed sections and headers. I'm experimenting now with different ways to display the information and I want to try display the data in a UISplitViewController. The left view is a tableviewcontroller with headings. The right view is also a tableviewcontroller with sub headings. I still want the data to be provided in a popover manner but when I've tried this the popover appears with nothing in it. I've put breakpoints in the viewDidLoad methods of my left and right view for the SplitView. The breaks are being hit but nothing is displaying in my popover. How can I display a UISplitView IN a PopoverController. My Root View - (IBAction)showPopover:(id)sender {

 self.SVC = [[SplitViewContainerViewController alloc] init];

 self.pickerPopover = [[[UIPopoverController alloc] initWithContentViewController:SVC] autorelease];


CGRect frame= CGRectMake(0,0, 0, 0);
[self.pickerPopover presentPopoverFromRect:frame inView:self.view permittedArrowDirections:0 animated:NO];

@CONTENT:I just partially added shopping cart to my ecommerce test-site. It still can't do checkout, or even update quantity of items(about to start though) but I should be able to open the page responsible for displaying the shopping cart. Instead it bricks my entire website. I get the following error when compiling the site: Server Error in '/Website' Application. Object reference not set to an instance of an object.

Exception Details: System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object. Source Error: The source code that generated this unhandled exception can only be shown when compiled in debug mode. To enable this, please follow one of the below steps, then request the URL: Add a "Debug=true" directive at the top of the file that generated the error. Example: or: 2) Add the following section to the configuration file of your application: Note that this second technique will cause all files within a given application to be compiled in debug mode. The first technique will cause only that particular file to be compiled in debug mode. Important: Running applications in debug mode does incur a memory/performance overhead.

@TITLE:phonegap XMLHttpRequest responseText empty with android but contain data in iphone
@CONTENT:I'm developing an app in PhoneGap+dreamweaver cs5.5, who makes a call to a handler (.ashx) and returns a JSON string. I do the following: function appReady(){
var ajax = new XMLHttpRequest();
    ajax.open("GET","https://xxxx.xxxxx.com/xxxx/xxxx.ashx?method=GetUser&email=xxx@xxxx.com&pwd=123456",false);

                document.getElementById('main').innerHTML = ajax.responseText;
            }
        }
    }
}
 When I running the app on the iphone emulator, I recover the json string responseText, but this comes empty on android emulator. In iphone the status returned is 200 but in android is 0. if the problem was the coss-domain request, wouldn't work on any platform right? I don't understand why the example of the wiki: http://wiki.phonegap.com/w/page/42450600/PhoneGap% 20Ajax% 20Sample works correctly in two platforms and mine only in iphone ...

@CONTENT:I have a folder in which there are many many folder and in each of these I have lots and lots of files. I have no idea which folder each files might be located in. I will periodically receive a list of files I need to copy to a predefined destination. The script will run on a Unix machine. So, my little script should: read received list find all files in the list copy each file to a predefined destination via SCP step 1 and 3, I think I'll manage on my own, but how will I do step 2? I was thinking about using "find" to locate each file and when found, write the location in a string array. When all files are found I loop through the string array, running the "SCP" command for each file-location. I think this should work, but I've never written a bash script before so could anyone help me a little to get started? I just need a basic "find" command which finds a filename and returns the file location if the file is found.

@TITLE:404 when I try to open the site from the machine where Azure web role is deployed
@CONTENT:At the end of RoleEntryPoint.OnStart() I want to open the web role site to ensure that it doesn't break with some stupid error. So I do the following: WebRequest request = WebRequest.Create( "http://127.0.0.1" );
using( WebResponse response = request.GetResponse() ) {
}
 and this fails with WebException with (404) Not Found text. The role has an open HTTP endpoint on port 80, so this should not be a problem. However if I omit that code and the role starts I can open http://mysubdomain.cloudpapp.net no problem. What's the deal here? How do I open the web page of the web role site from within the web role?
@CODE:RoleEntryPoint.OnStart() WebRequest request = WebRequest.Create( "http://127.0.0.1" );

@TITLE:Response.Redirect doesn't work after 2 minutes subroutine
@CONTENT:I've bound an asp button to a subroutine that generates an xls file through these steps: Executes some sql queries (successfully) Builds the excel file with the resulting data sets (successfully, 2MB) Redirects the current page to a "DownloadPage.aspx?filename=" with the standard operations to build and download the file But at this point it doesn't start any download even if the excel file is available in the source folder. The strange thing is that sometimes it works, randomly. No exception is throwed but the Thread Abort dued to redirection. So, I haven't other ideas...Do you? Thanks p.s. I've tried to set some IIS parameters to 6 minutes or over.

@TITLE:Does POSIX Extended Regular Expressions supports the \d Metacharacter?
@CONTENT:I have witten a simple c program as follows: #include <stdio.h>
#include <regex.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    regex_t re;
    char *pattern = "\\d{3}([a-zA-Z]+).(\\d{2}|N/A)\\s\\1"; // use \d, but wouldn't match
    const char *target = "123Hello N/A Hello";

 This creates a list of checkboxes to select which equipment the user wants and text boxes to put in the number required. Is it possible to somehow store the data in an associative array in php so that i cant then transfer this into a database? for example: equipmentid    count
1              2
3              1
 Or is there a different way to do this. Thanks.

@TITLE:how to get value of h2 tag for a div inside other div with id using javascript
@CONTENT:I have a div with id, which has some other div's without id. Some thing like: <div class="mainDivClass" id="mainDiv">
    <div class="subDivClass">
        <h2>one</h2>
              Hello One!!
    </div>

    <div class="subDivClass">
        <h2>two</h2>
              Hello Two!!
    </div>

    <div class="subDivClass">
         <h2>three</h2>
              Hello Three!!
    </div>
</div>
 In my javascript, I am looping through above div like: var divLists = document.getElementById('mainDiv').firstChild.childNodes; 

for (var i = 0; i < tabLists.length; i++) { 
  var anchor = divLists[i].firstChild; 
  var iconFile;

  if(i==0)
  {
    iconFile = 'details.png';                     
  }

  else
  {
    iconFile = 'search1.png';
   }
  anchor.style.backgroundImage = 'url(' + iconFile + ')'; 
  anchor.style.backgroundRepeat = 'no-repeat';        
  anchor.style.backgroundPosition = '1px 2px';        
  anchor.className = 'toplevel-tab';
} 
 As shown, I am setting iconFile variable on value of i. So for i = 0, it would be details.png while for all others, it would be search1.png. Now, I want to decide the iconFile variable value based on the h2 value of the element. That is, if h2 is banana, banana.png will go in iconFile but if h2 is orange, orange.png will be selected. How to get h2 value inside javascript ? Thanks for reading!! Nik

@TITLE:Creating windows-7 library using c#
@CONTENT:Windows-7 introduced a concept of virtual folder, called 'Libraries'. I am working on implementing a Library with my custom action. The constraint is that, I have to stick to .NET version 2 for this :( While looking around, I didn't find any native (c/C++) API for doing this. I am planning to use Interop (p-Invoke) to make a library once I get native APIs. Could any one point to a link or documentation which might help. If somehow I can do this directly from c# (with .NET v2), that would be great. Thank you, John

 So, I checked with my gem file whether it had prototype and jQuery conflict or not. what I found is as below source 'http://rubygems.org'

gem 'rails', '3.1.1'
gem 'annotate', :git => 'git://github.com/ctran/annotate_models.git'

# Bundle edge Rails instead:
# gem 'rails',     :git => 'git://github.com/rails/rails.git'
gem 'sqlite3'

gem 'gravatar_image_tag', '1.0.0.pre2'
gem 'will_paginate', '3.0.pre2'
# Gems used only for assets and not required
# in production environments by default.
group :assets do
  #gem 'sass-rails',   '~> 3.1.4'
  gem 'coffee-rails', '~> 3.1.1'
  gem 'uglifier', '>= 1.0.3'
end

gem 'jquery-rails'


group :development do
  gem 'rspec-rails', '2.6.1'
  gem 'faker', '0.3.1'
end

group :test do
  gem 'rspec-rails', '2.6.1'
  gem 'webrat', '0.7.1'
  gem 'factory_girl_rails', '1.0'
end

group :production do
  gem 'therubyracer-heroku', '~> 0.8.1.pre3', :platform => :ruby
  #gem 'therubyracer-heroku', '0.8.1.pre3' # you will need this too
  gem 'pg'
end
 So, I am quite so sure here there is no prototype installed, as I heard for the rails 3.1 onward the jQuery is used by default. Any advice that you think to get it working for me? Where to check that my jQuery is already installed properly. As per @Tuck's suggestion, I post my routes.rb here. SampleApp::Application.routes.draw do
  resources :users
  resources :sessions, :only => [:new, :create, :destroy]
  resources :microposts, :only => [:create, :destroy]

  match '/signup',  :to => 'users#new'
  match '/signin',  :to => 'sessions#new'
  match '/signout', :to => 'sessions#destroy'

  match '/contact', :to => 'pages#contact'
  match '/about',   :to => 'pages#about'
  match '/help',    :to => 'pages#help'

  root :to => 'pages#home'

  get "pages/home"

  get "pages/contact"

  get "pages/about"

end
@CODE:<tr>
  <td class="micropost">
    <span class="content"><%= micropost.content %></span>
    <span class="timestamp">
      Posted <%= time_ago_in_words(micropost.created_at) %> ago.
    </span>
  </td>
  <% if current_user?(micropost.user) %>
  <td>
    <%= link_to "delete", micropost, :method => :delete,
                                     :confirm => "You sure?",
                                     :title => micropost.content %>
  </td>
  <% end %>

@TITLE:Decode JSON with Java
@CONTENT:I am trying to decode JSON data with Java. I found a library at the following link: http://code.google.com/p/json-simple/wiki/DecodingExamples I have included the .jar file in the build path in my eclipse project, which added the library under "Referenced Libraries". But when I try to use the library as shown in the first example in the link above, the type is not found. String s="[0,{\"1\":{\"2\":{\"3\":{\"4\":[5,{\"6\":7}]}}}}]";
Object obj=JSONValue.parse(s);
// Error: JSONValue cannot be resolved
 I know this question may be a bit naive, but can someone point out what step I am doing wrong? The list of imports so far are: import java.io.DataInputStream;
import java.io.DataOutputStream;    
import java.io.IOException;
import java.net.MalformedURLException;
import java.net.URL;

@CONTENT:so suppose my server is located in http://www.example.com I then put a file file.exe in the files directory in the root server hence normally you can download that file by typing this into the browser http://www.example.com/files/file.exe And suppose that I have a php script that first authenticates the user and then redirect them to that file.exe download page eg. using this method:    header('Location: http://www.example.com/files/file.exe');
   exit(0);
 what is the best way to 1.) prevent unauthenticated users from being able to access that file by typing in that URL above And 2.) have the php script still able to serve that file despite 1.) hence authenticated users should be able to download that file on that location supposing that I use the standard LAMP stack (also I use Zend Framework)

@TITLE:No Desired Output, Probable Cause is an Overload
@CONTENT:I am creating a simple Rock Paper Scissors game, but changing the traditional way it is played by adding two more choices, "Lizard" and "Spock". The Point of this game is to make it more complex then the traditional way of playing it. Not sure if I am overloading the Action Event, but I get this weird bug in the code. there is suppose to be 5 buttons containing the Rock Paper Scissors etc., and 1 JTextArea. The problem is whenever I click the button "Spock" and the String AI gets "Spock"/choices[4] as well, It appear to be ignoring the following code below that I want it to respond to and instead goes with "You Lost... Haha" Option, if ((e.getSource() == b5) && (AI == choices[4])) {
  text.append("It's a Tie!\n\n");
  return;
}
 Also when clicking the "Lizard" Button, it also ignores the following code below and goes with the "You Won!" Option instead if ((e.getSource() == b4) && (AI == choices[3])) {
  text.append("It's a Tie!\n\n");
  return;
}

@TITLE:no such file to load X map_by_method
@CONTENT:This question was asked before here, but can't say that the answer helps me. I am using Rails 3.1.3. When I run rails console on my local dev machine, I get the following message: no such file to load -- map_by_method
 The message doesn't prevent the irb session from launching, so it's benign. But I'd like to get rid of it. At one point in time I had the map_by_method gem installed, but I removed it from the Gemfile and gemset -- yet the message still appears. Any idea how to vanquish it?

@TITLE:program not calling the right overloaded operator
@CONTENT:I've the class Directory which does stuff with objects of class File, and overloaded operators, like this: class Directory
{
    std::vector<char> name, timeOfCreation;
    std::vector<File> arr;

public:
    Directory(std::string);
    Directory(const Directory&);
    ~Directory();

    friend Directory operator - (Directory, Directory);
    friend long int operator + (Directory);
    friend std::ofstream& operator << (std::ofstream&, Directory);

friend void main();
};
 Ok, now the issue arises when in main i have void main()
{
     //make object of Directory d
    std::cout << d;
}
 The program now calls the operator int() instead of operator <<. Thus the command std::cout <<d acts like std::cout << (int)d, and it writes out the number of Files in my Directory. Here are the implementations of operators << and int(): Directory::operator int()
{
    return (int)arr.size();
}

std::ofstream& operator << (std::ofstream& out, Directory d)
{
    // get the max field widths for three fields
    int widthLeft = 0, widthMiddle = 0, widthRight = 10;
    std::vector<File>::const_iterator i = d.arr.begin();
    for(; i < d.arr.end(); ++i)
    {
        if((int)d.timeOfCreation.size() > widthLeft)
            widthLeft = (int)d.timeOfCreation.size();
    if((int)d.name.size() > widthMiddle)
            widthMiddle = (int)d.name.size();
    }
    out<<std::setw(widthLeft)<<"Date & Time of creation";
    out<<std::setw(widthMiddle)<<"Name";
    out<<std::setw(widthRight)<<"Total Size\n";
    return out;

}
 Note: the operator << isn't finished yet, I'm just testing the setw function, but it still should write out that one line.

@LINK:/questions/8262890/ie9-position-relative-hover-issue
@TITLE:IE9 - Position: relative; hover issue
@CONTENT:I'm getting some strange hover behaviour from IE9 which seems to be resulting from positioning an element relative to a parent. It's a bit difficult to explain so I've made a working example available here: http://jsfiddle.net/CVPhW/2/ I've stripped it out as much as I can but I left all the containing divs in there in case they were somehow relevant. Try hovering your cursor over the very bottom of each button and you'll see the hover doesn't activate unless you move the cursor around 10 pixels upwards. It works fine in FF, Chrome and believe it or not, even IE6. It's something to do with the bottom: 12px; style applied to #menucontainer ul li a. If I remove that, the whole portion activates properly, but it's not positioned correctly. The text position in that example is how I'd like it to be, but with a fix for the hovering. Has anyone else encountered something like this before? I've been trawling SO and Google for an answer but I haven't found anything remotely similar. I'd be really grateful for some help with this.

@TITLE:TypeError: Error #1006: playContent is not a function
@CONTENT:I have a class that holds an object from another class. When I want to call some function from this class, I get the above error... See code to get a better idea! MainMenu.as package portfolioSource  {      
    public class MainMenu extends MovieClip {

        private var movieContainer:MoviePlayerContainer;

        public function MainMenu() {

            movieContainer = new MoviePlayerContainer();
            this.addChild(movieContainer);

        }

        function ef_btnTheme1CLICK(event:Event){

            movieContainer.playContent(1);//It breaks here

        }           
    }       
}
 and MoviePlayerContainer.as package portfolioSource  {    
    public class MoviePlayerContainer extends MovieClip {   

        public function playContent(_parameter:Number){

            trace("I do not work");

        }
    }

}
 Any ideas on what I'm doing wrong? Not one of the functions in the movieContainer object works. I get the same error every time. The constructor (omitted here) does not get executed, but it generates no error... When I remove the package part and leave it default like : package {
    public class someClass{
    }
}
 Then it works. So I am really confused now. Thanks!

@LINK:/questions/8262119/silverlight-mouse-events-mouseenter-and-mouseleave-conflicts
@TITLE:Silverlight Mouse Events: MouseEnter and MouseLeave conflicts
@CONTENT:I have a collection of buttons in a grid. For each one of these buttons, I want to handle the MouseEnter and MouseLeave events to animate the height of the button (and do some other interesting stuff). It all works good until I start moving my mouse too fast over and off the buttons which eventually cause the events to take place at before the other is complete. What's the best way of making sure the events wait for eachother before being triggered? UPDATE: Going by x0r's advice, I refactored my code into an internal class which inherits from Button and has the required methods to perform the animations. Unfortunately, this did not really solve the problem because - I think - I'm handling the Completed event of the first animation in two separate places. (correct me if I'm wrong). Here's my code: internal class MockButton : Button
{
    #region Fields

    private Storyboard _mouseEnterStoryBoard;
    private Storyboard _mouseLeaveStoryBoard;
    private Double _width;

    #endregion

    #region Properties

    internal Int32 Index { get; private set; }

    #endregion

    #region Ctors

    internal MockButton(Int32 index) : this(index, 200)
    {

    }

    internal MockButton(Int32 index, Double width)
    {
        this.Index = index;
        this._width = width;
    }

    #endregion

    #region Event Handlers

    internal void OnMouseEnter(Action action, Double targetAnimationHeight)
    {
        if (_mouseEnterStoryBoard == null)
        {
            _mouseEnterStoryBoard = new Storyboard();
            DoubleAnimation heightAnimation = new DoubleAnimation();
            heightAnimation.From = 10;
            heightAnimation.To = targetAnimationHeight;
            heightAnimation.Duration = new Duration(TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(300));
            _mouseEnterStoryBoard.SetValue(Storyboard.TargetPropertyProperty, new PropertyPath("Height"));
            Storyboard.SetTarget(heightAnimation, this);
            _mouseEnterStoryBoard.Children.Add(heightAnimation);
        }
        _mouseEnterStoryBoard.Completed += (s, e) =>
        {
            action.Invoke();
        };
        _mouseEnterStoryBoard.Begin();
    }

    internal void OnMouseLeave()
    {
        if (_mouseLeaveStoryBoard == null)
        {
            _mouseLeaveStoryBoard = new Storyboard();
            DoubleAnimation heightAnimation = new DoubleAnimation();
            heightAnimation.To = 10;
            heightAnimation.Duration = new Duration(TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(300));
            _mouseLeaveStoryBoard.SetValue(Storyboard.TargetPropertyProperty, new PropertyPath("Height"));
            Storyboard.SetTarget(heightAnimation, this);
            _mouseLeaveStoryBoard.Children.Add(heightAnimation);
        }
        if (_mouseEnterStoryBoard.GetCurrentState() != ClockState.Stopped)
        {
            _mouseEnterStoryBoard.Completed += (s, e) =>
            {
                _mouseLeaveStoryBoard.Begin();
            };
        }
        else
        {
            _mouseLeaveStoryBoard.Begin();
        }
    }

    #endregion
}
 UPDATE 2: Some events are getting triggered multiple times. An example of that is the Click event on the close button of my Rule object...     public Rule(Action<Int32> closeAction)
    {
        this.Style = Application.Current.Resources["RuleDefaultStyle"] as Style;
        this.CloseAction = closeAction;
        this.Loaded += (s, e) =>
        {
            if (_closeButton != null)
            {
                _closeButton.Click += (btn, args) =>
                {
                    if (this.CloseAction != null)
                    {
                        this.CloseAction.Invoke(this.Index);
                    }
                };
                if (_closeButtonShouldBeVisible)
                {
                    _closeButton.Visibility = System.Windows.Visibility.Visible;
                }
            }
        };
    }
 And below is the Action<Int32> I'm passing to the Rule object as the CloseAction:     private void RemoveRule(Int32 ruleIndex)
    {
        Rule ruleToRemove = Rules.FirstOrDefault(x => x.Index.Equals(ruleIndex));
        Storyboard sb = new Storyboard();
        DoubleAnimation animation = new DoubleAnimation();
        sb.SetValue(Storyboard.TargetPropertyProperty, new PropertyPath("Opacity"));
        animation.Duration = TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(300);
        animation.From = 1;
        animation.To = 0;
        sb.Children.Add(animation);
        Storyboard.SetTarget(animation, ruleToRemove);
        sb.Completed += (s, e) =>
        {
            if (Rules.FirstOrDefault(x => x.Index.Equals(ruleIndex)) != null)
            {
                this.Rules.RemoveAt(ruleIndex);
            }
        };
        sb.Begin();
    }
 UPDATE 3: In order to avoid the animations running too early, I thought I could delay the MouseEnter event, so if the user just scrolls over the item too fast, it doesn't kick off. But I have a problem now: Say the user mouses over the item and then mouses out. If I use the Storyboard.BeginTime property, that won't safe guard against that behavior because eventhough the animation gets delayed, it's still going to start eventually... So is there a way I could prevent that from happening? Any suggestions?

@CONTENT:I have a dbml file (linq to sql) to connect to my database. I have a manager that uses a generic repository (for each entity) to talk to the dbml. A manager uses the Repo to do work (CRUD operations). A WCF wraps the manager and exposes the it to the outside world (so my application can use it). DB <--> IRepository< Entity, DataContext> <--> IManager(IRepo, IRepo...) <--> WCFService(IManager) I've tested the manager, it works fine every time. The problem is the WCF. I'll read data (e.g. GetAllLocations), update the data (e.g. change a Location name), but then at some random point later, I'll read dirty data. E.g. if I've been changing a location name to from "BC 1", to "BC 2", to "BC 3", sometimes I'll read it and get older values. Like after I've changed it to "BC 3" and I am expecting to read "BC 3", I get "BC 1" (which doesn't make sense since the value before the update was "BC 2" anyway). WCF does not have caching by default, so why is this happening on my WCF and NOT on my manager? All the WCF does is pass values to the manager and get values from the manager, it's a very basic wrapper class. NOTE: I am using StructureMap to automatically resolve DependencyInjection and IoC stuff. Problem methods: anything that's reading (e.g. GetLocationById and GetAllLocations). They just don't always return the latest data from the database. I know it's not the manager because I created a simple project to test both the Manager and WCF independently, and only the WCF had dirty reads after updating data (specifically the Location). I have not testing all the other entities yet. One final note: I kept getting the "System.Data.Linq.ChangeConflictException: Row not found or changed." exception. I changed the DBML designer Location Entity's properties (except the PK) to Update Check: Never. The dirty reads were happening before this change anyway and the manager works fine (and it uses the DBML). So I have no reason to believe this is causing the dirty reads. Also, the Location Entity has a trigger in the database, but I'm eliminated this as the cause because I disabled it and that didn't help, and once again, the manager works fine.

@LINK:/questions/8261673/how-to-make-the-binding-happen-from-the-viewmodel
@TITLE:How to make the binding happen from the ViewModel
@CONTENT:I'm trying to capture the Enter key being pressed on a text box, so that I can kick off an update to the server. It's not working, and so I've reduced the problem to it's simplist elemetns. In this example, it seems that the binding is not happening per keystroke, but at sometime later. I need to the binding to be completed by the time the enter key is pressed. Consider the following XAML and function from the VM. Here's the XAML of the textbox <TextBox Text="{Binding TextValue, Mode=TwoWay}" Height="23" Width="300">
    <i:Interaction.Triggers>
        <i:EventTrigger EventName="KeyDown">
            <cmd:EventToCommand Command="{Binding KeyDownCommand}"
                PassEventArgsToCommand="True" />
        </i:EventTrigger>
    </i:Interaction.Triggers>
</TextBox>
 The KeyDownCommand fire as expected, howerver the value is not yet in the TextValue property. If I hit enter a second time then the value is in the property? Here's the KeyDownCommand. The constructor of the ViewModel sets the keyDownCommand correctly. public RelayCommand<RoutedEventArgs> KeyDownCommand { get; private set; }
private void KeyDownAction(RoutedEventArgs eventArg)
{
    var source = eventArg.OriginalSource as FrameworkElement;
    var e = eventArg as KeyEventArgs;
    if (source != null && e != null && e.Key== Key.Enter)
    {
        e.Handled = true;
        MessageBox.Show(TextValue);
    }
}
 It seems that what I need is a way to "post" the Text of the TextBox back to the TextValue property of the VM when the Enter key is pressed. Or is there something else I'm missing.
@CODE:<TextBox Text="{Binding TextValue, Mode=TwoWay}" Height="23" Width="300">
    <i:Interaction.Triggers>
        <i:EventTrigger EventName="KeyDown">

$cats[A][A2][A22][A222] = $val;
 access values from $cats using $keys = Array ('A', 'A2', 'A22', 'A221'); without checking the length of $keys and doing something like... switch (count($keys)) {
   case 1: $val = $cats[$keys[0]]; break;
   case 2: $val = $cats[$key[0]][$key[1]]; break;
   case 3: $val = $cats[$key[0]][$key[1]][$key[2]]; break;

@TITLE:Special character not recognized
@CONTENT:It seems as though he special characters are all recognized as the same thing on my system. Here is some sample code: // Function that processes a string to put to lowercase and remove special characters
function NormalizeString(s){
    var r=s.toLowerCase();
    if(r.indexOf('?')!=0){
       r=Left(r,r.indexOf('?')) + 'e' +  Right(r,r.length-r.indexOf('?')-1)
    }        
    return r;  
  }
 This works and changes the ? to an e. Now if I add to this program : // Function that processes a string to put to lowercase and remove special characters
function NormalizeString(s){
    var r=s.toLowerCase();
    if(r.indexOf('?')!=0){
       r=Left(r,r.indexOf('?')) + 'e' +  Right(r,r.length-r.indexOf('?')-1)
    }  
   if(r.indexOf('?')!=0){
       r=Left(r,r.indexOf('?')) + 'o' +  Right(r,r.length-r.indexOf('?')-1)
    }       
    return r;  
  }
 This changes 'Contr?le' to 'ocontrele'. And then I rtied the following code: function NormalizeString(s){

@TITLE:iOS 5 issues: Navigation bar clipped after dismissing modal

Now, I have a number of issues with my app that I have no way of fixing because I have no clue what is going on, because I feel that they are iOS 5 issues, not mine. Was there an iOS 5 conversion manual I missed? Or did they just change everything for fun, and want us to figure out where all the easter eggs were? Here is another issue I am experiencing (that I have wasted so much time trying to fix), that DON'T EXIST AT ALL when I simply say that I want to run the app in good ol' 4.2: Modal view My app is a simple reader app. I have a book reading view that displays text with a UIWebView. One of the features I have been working on involves the ability to take notes as you read. This is achieved by hitting a button, and presenting a modal view. Yes, a modal view. The most simple pre- iOS 5 thing you could possibly do. Now, when I dismiss my modal view, just by hitting cancel, and simply dismiss the view, when I get back to my reader view, the navigation bar at the top is pushed up half way off the screen! This doesn't happen in 4.2, but there it is in iOS 5! What can I do to get this issue resolved? Thanks for your help.

@TITLE:Dealing with concurrent Ajax requests
@CONTENT:I'm trying to do the following: I have a list of links, each performing a different Ajax call when clicked. Each Ajax response is assigned a target where it will be displayed. While a request is being processed, the links can still be clicked (= further Ajax calls). The example below has two targets and four links: two point to DIV#d1, two point to DIV#d2. How can I make sure that only the response to the last request sent will eventually be displayed in its target DIV ? If I click on the link labelled Data1, then Data2, the first call must be aborted because Response1 could arrive after Response2. The problem seems to imply that I must keep track of previous requests for each target, so I can abort them whenever a new request is made. I've written this piece of code. I'd like to know if you think this is the approach is right. <!DOCTYPE html>

@TITLE:Why is SecureRandom in Java called CS PRNG and not TRNG?
@CONTENT:SecureRandom internally makes use of other algorithms , like in case of Linux , makes use of NativePRNG which in turn makes use of /dev/urandom . But /dev/urandom is actually using interrupts events etc to generate entropy which is similar to a True Random Number Generator (TRNG) . So why is SecureRandom called PseudoRandom Number Generator , although it is dependent on the implementation of the algorithm it is using ? Thanks

@LINK:/questions/8257362/web-frameworks-available-libraries-is-it-a-brave-move-to-opt-for-node-js-inst
@TITLE:Web Frameworks & Available Libraries: Is it a brave move to opt for Node.js instead of Python?
@CONTENT:I have quite sometime now (a month or two) before I can actually start learning a web programming language; so I am still worrying about what language to learn. Whatever programming language I choose, I'd also have to learn JavaScript alongside that language as it's the go to for client-side scripting. I am looking at: (1) Python, Ruby, JavaScript (Node.js -- server-side & jQuery -- client-side); (2) DBMS - PostgreSQL (3) I am going to learn C/C++ anyway (but after I learn a high-level programming language among those mentioned above). So, the question is, is it a brave move to choose Node.js/JavaScript for server-side programming? (brave in the sense, learning Python would be a lot easier and good, and you're only trying to be brave/foolish by choosing Node.js) Points to consider: I am sure Python, Ruby and all will have a great future. Will Node.js enjoy the same too? Do you think? (long-term plans) Availability web frameworks: Is there a framework for Node.js that is as mature and complete as Django (or Pylons)? Availability of support from SO community and the web: that is, can I be sure that I would get a few good replies from the SO community if something goes wrong and I need help? I mean, I am sure that i would, if it is Python, C/C++ etc. is Node.js too slow to code than Python? Why I am even thinking about Node.js? I've read comments/answers on SO saying that Node.js is much much faster than other high-level languages like Python, Ruby or PHP. Sorry, but like I said, it's not my opinion [READ]. If I choose Node.js, I would only have to learn one programming language basically - - JavaScript. (I am not looking for a job, I want to develop a (large?) web application like a social network or photo-sharing service) [I believe anyone can have these questions, so it's not entirely subjective]

@TITLE:Why must I add a DataGridView to a Form in order to get the data?
@CONTENT:I had to copy a datagridview to another, in order to iterate through it within a backgroundworker thread, creating an excel export. The copy was made to allow users to made some changes in the original datagridview, during the export. So I created a new DataGridView (programatically), and put a copy of the original DataTable into the DataSource property of the new DataGridView. However, I figured out that if I don't add the datagridview in the Controls (list) property of any Form, the RowCount still equals to 0... Can someone can explain this? Note : The copy of the DataTable is just a new DataTable with copy() of Columns.

@TITLE:How to add Twitter support for Opensocial on a Apache Tomcat (Liferay)?
@CONTENT:i recently upgraded to Liferay 6.1(b4 from the trunk 17.11.2011) to test the Opensocial support. Now i wanted to make a Twitter Oauth request, but i am not able to do this. I first tested if Opensocial works with some sample gadgets, but i get a error from every gadget. Error: 403 Error, OAuth error: NOT_OWNER, Non-Secure Owner Page. Only page owners can grant OAuth approval ==== Original request: GET /1/account/verify_credentials.json Host: api.twitter.com X-Shindig-AuthType: oauth X-Forwarded-For: 87.139.78.177 X-shindig-dos: on ====
 My Idea now was to build a gadget by myself, but one of the first steps wanted me to add a provider to the "org.opensocial.client.OpenSocialProvider" Class, I got this from here. So the Problem now is that i dont know how to add the support for Twitter, i guess i have to add it somewhere in the WEB-INF/classes/com/liferay/opensocial directory, but i have no clue where exactly. This is important because i wanted to make many oauth requests from one gadget and if i have to add another Feature which requiers Oauth it would be easier to have a gadget which provides all Oauth Calls. A Example how to add a Provider and how to make the Oauth call would be awesome, thanks in advance.

@TITLE:How to display multiple categories with a Magento block
@CONTENT:My Magento homepage currently has this code snippet that displays all products just fine. {{block type="catalog/product_list"  category_id="2" template="catalog/product/list.phtml"}}
 Roughly, my category tree looks similar to this id 2 (root cat)
-> id 3
-> id 4
-> id 5
 Since every product I add is a child of id 2 - every product shows up on the homepage. What I'm after is a solution that will allow me to exclude specific id's (categories) from the home page product list. I've tried this snippet below with no success: {{block type="catalog/product_list"  category_id="2,3,5" template="catalog/product/list.phtml"}}
@CODE:{{block type="catalog/product_list"  category_id="2" template="catalog/product/list.phtml"}} id 2 (root cat)

-> id 4
-> id 5 {{block type="catalog/product_list"  category_id="2,3,5" template="catalog/product/list.phtml"}}

Same is true for adding disabled attribute , which stops valueChangeListener from firing. My valueChangeListener backbean has:     public void countrycodechange (ValueChangeEvent vce) {

        if (phaseId.equals(PhaseId.ANY_PHASE))

@LINK:/questions/8251358/better-way-to-set-size-of-input-textbox-across-platforms
@TITLE:Better way to set size of input textbox across platforms?
@CONTENT:Update is below code chunks. Original Question: I have an input field that is extending well beyond the rest of the page, but as the question alludes to, it appears fine in iOS3/4/5. I am wondering if anyone has run into this issue. My search button, which in iOS is on the right of the search textbox, actually wraps to the next "line" on other platforms. Code is below: HTML <form action="/jsp/mobile_files/results.jsp" method="get" autocorrect="off"     autocapitalize="off">
<h1><input class="keyword_search" type="text" name="keywords" maxlength="50" size="36" value="" /><input type="submit" class="keyword_submit" value="Go" /></h1>
</form>
 The two relevant CSS classes are:  /* input[type="submit"] */
 .keyword_submit
 {
   background: #666666;  /* grey */
   color: #FFFFFF;  /* white */
   font-weight: bold;
   font-size: 60%;
   line-height: 1.45em; /* 1.45 with 60% font-size */

   margin-left: -4px; /* to do - needs to be -12 for desktop */
   padding-bottom: 1px;


   -moz-border-radius: 10px;       /* for mozilla firefox */

   /* NOTE: CSS3 rounded corners not work on iPhone 3G with iOS 3.x */
   border-radius: 10px;

   /* webkit rounded corners work on iPhone 3G with iOS 3.x */
   -webkit-border-radius: 10px;


   -moz-border-radius-topleft: 0px;      /* for mozilla firefox */
   -moz-border-radius-bottomleft: 0px;

   /* NOTE: CSS3 rounded corners not work on iPhone 3G with iOS 3.x */
   border-top-left-radius: 0px;
   border-bottom-left-radius: 0px;

   /* but this does work on iPhone 3G with iOS 3.x */
   -webkit-border-top-left-radius: 0px;
   -webkit-border-bottom-left-radius: 0px;

   /* to do - possible without this??  We lose the gradient! */
   -webkit-appearance: none;
 }
 and /* input[type="text"] */
  .keyword_search {
    background: #F1F1F1;  /* faded white */
    color: #333333;  /* dark */
    font-weight: bold;

    /* to do - looks better on iOS with larger font */
    /*
    font-size: 80%;
    */

    -moz-border-radius: 10px;       /* for mozilla firefox */

    /* NOTE: CSS3 rounded corners not work on iPhone 3G with iOS 3.x */
    border-radius: 10px;

    /* webkit rounded corners work on iPhone 3G with iOS 3.x */
    -webkit-border-radius: 10px;

    margin-left: 0.75em; /* moves entry field to the right */
    padding-left: 0.6em; /* moves text start cursor in the entry field to the right */

    /* for mozilla firefox */
    -moz-border-radius-topright: 0px;      
    -moz-border-radius-bottomright: 0px;

    /* NOTE: CSS3 rounded corners not work on iPhone 3G with iOS 3.x */
    border-top-right-radius: 0px;
    border-bottom-right-radius: 0px;

    /* but this does work on iPhone 3G with iOS 3.x */
    -webkit-border-top-right-radius: 0px;
    -webkit-border-bottom-right-radius: 0px;
  }
 Updated Question Screenshots can be seen at http://i.stack.imgur.com/5f7C8.jpg I would post it here, but I need more than 10 reputation to post images. You can see in the Android image what happens if the size on my input is set too large for any platform. To make it fit on the BlackBerry, you can see what it does to the size rendered in iOS. All three img's have size set to the same value (="10")... and you can see the result in the different platforms. <input class="keyword_search" type="number" name="job_order_id" maxlength="7" size="10" value="" />
<input type="submit" class="keyword_submit" value="Go" />
 Suggestions for a better way to control the size? Can I use %, em, px or some unit that will be more consistent across platforms? (I'll worry about getting rid of the gap,size of the button and other tweaks after I get the size sorted out)

@TITLE:UnsatisfiedLinkError: Using the Remedy API with Java
@CONTENT:I'm trying to run the example from this question about using the BMC remedy API. However I'm getting the below error message when trying to run the example, it appears to compile fine. As I understand it I need to reference arapi71.jar. However that library is actually sitting in a different domain, so I can't reference it directly. I've copied over the whole folder that it sits in to my PC and added to the build path, this may be the issue, I'm new to using frameworks etc so if that's the problem let me know. If that's isn't the problem and it should be ok to pull over all that info and reference it, what else could I be missing? This site here has some ideas about the path's etc, but it seems they are mostly on linux and I'm not 100% sure what it correlates to on windows (7 by the way though I don't think that makes a difference to environment variables). It mentions that not being able to find the .dll file could be an issue, this is in the folder, so I would assume it could still find it in there? Any help would be much appreciated!

@TITLE:Lwjgl/openGL window size always stays the same despite changing width and height
@CONTENT:For some reason the size if the window always stays the same size even when i change the width and the height. I think the problem is something to the viewport as the viewable area in the window changes correctly but there's always a black area in the part of the window that is not used.

@TITLE:Implementing User Accounts into Login System Php
@CONTENT:I want to establish and ENFORCE user permissions on my website. I have two user groups: buyers and merchants. For example, for buyers I have (under /login/ dir): <form method="post" action="check_buyer.php" id="LoggingInBuyer">
    <div style="width:265px;margin:0; padding:0; float:left;">
        <label>Username:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        <input id="UserReg" style="width:250px;" type="text" name="userName" tabindex="1" class="required" />
    </div>
    <div style="width:265px;margin:0; padding:0; float:right;">
        <label>Password:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <span><a href="#">Forgot Password?</span></a></label>
        <br />
        <input id="UserReg" style="width:250px;" type="password"  name="userPass" tabindex="2" class="required" />

if($SaltyPass != $ifUserExists['uUPass']) # incorrect PASS
{

else {
validateUser();
}
// If User *has not* logged in yet, keep on /login
if(!isLoggedIn())
{
    header('Location: index.php');
    die();
}
?>
 If a valid user is entered.. it goes to /login/buyer dir <?php
session_start();
if($_SESSION['uUserType']!=1)
{ 
    echo 'the userid: ' . $userid . '<br>' . 'the type is ' . $userType . '<br>';

//if the user has not logged in

}
?>

<?php 
    if($_SESSION['valid'] == 1){
        #echo "<a href='../logout.php'>Logout</a>";
        require_once('buyer_profile.php');
    }
    else{
        echo "<a href='../index.php'>Login</a>";
    }
?>
 The problem is once logged in as a buyer, i can just type in: login/merchant and it will take me there, even though the field in the session $_SESSION['uUserType'] is constantly being re-validated to = 1. How do I stop users from just typing login/merchant in the url and they can get access to that?

@TITLE:How to allow scrolling in Android's PopupWindow
@CONTENT:I have a PopupWindow that is populated with a LinearLayout. I instatiated my popup window like this: PopupWindow pw = new PopupWindow(layout, 450, 700, true);
pw.showAsDropDown(layout, 80, 80);
 However, when the device orientation is switched to landscape, the popup window gets cut off at the bottom and I cannot scroll down. See the screen capture: The layout underneath this popup is indeed scrollable. So how can I make the popup scrollable? Thanks, Igor

@TITLE:Using custom allocator for boost::wregex
@CONTENT:I created a custom allocator and want to use it all across our code. The way we did it is by defining the templates that wrap each containers we use and make use of our own allocator instead of the default: template <class Type> class myVector : public std::vector<Type, CCustomAllocator<Type>> and so we can use it in our code like this:myVector<int> x. This reduces the chance of making mistakes. we have similar wrappers for all the containers we use in our code: list, string, wstring, ... I hope this approach makes sense. I am having trouble defining this type of template wrapper for boost::wregex. Can regex use a specified allocator? Thanks,

@TITLE:SQL to merge rows
@CONTENT:Update How I can select the rows from a table that when ordered the first element matches some row the second element matches the next row the third element the next row after the second row the forth element the next row after the third row and so on until the end of values in array? The Logic Supposing I have these rows as result of a query (table token holds id and word and table positioning holds id and position):  id | word | textblockid |sentence |position 
 5  | Fear |      5      |    1    |    1
 8  | of   |      5      |    1    |    2
 6  | the  |      5      |    1    |    3
 7  | Dark |      5      |    1    |    4
 9  | is   |      5      |    1    |    5
 I can have this spread in the table with different textblockids, sentences and positions. I want to transform in this:  id  | word             | textblockid | sentence |position 
 10  | Fear of the Dark |      5      |     1    |    1
  9  | is               |      5      |     1    |    2
 I'm doing a function that receives an array with the ids to merge, something like merge_tokens('{5,8,6,7}'). I insert the new word Fear of the Dark in the table token and get the generated id (as in example, id is 10). This is easy. The Question I need to update the id of the first word (in this case, Fear) to 10 and delete the next words(of,the,Dark). My doubt is how I can perform these operations. I think I need to SELECT from an ordered table where the first row id matches the first element in the id array, the second row id matches the second element id array and so on, and after this, update the first element and remove the next ones. I can't delete just delete the other rows by id because they are used in other words. I only will delete the of where the previous is Fear, the next is of and the next Dark. Following this rule, I only can delete the where the previous is of, the other previous Fear and the next is Dark. As example, I can have in the same table something like that can't be affected:  id  | word      | textblockid |sentence |position 
 6   | the       |      8      |    3    |    10

@CONTENT:I have a Crystal Reports project that I am working on where I need to generate a label with UPC-A's. After doing a bit of research, I've found that Azalea Software offers a tool that is suppose to integrate barcode objects into your application. I purchased the software from Azalea, followed all of their instructions and I can not get their software to work with my report. I don't want to speak ill of Azalea, because their support has been great, but is anyone aware of a legitimate alternative for UPC-A barcode creatioon from within Crystal Reports 2008? I don't mind purchasing another 3rd party API, I just need to be able to generate dynamic UPC-A images from the UPC-A numbers that I need to encode stored within my database. Further information-- this is a label document that is printed from a ClickOnce published application that uses the Crystal Reports for Visual Studio 2010 runtime, and the Crystal Reports Document Viewer control to view and print these labels.

I can post some code that I have for my .ht files, but I thought that this info could get the ball rolling.

@TITLE:Images not shown in JasperReports' html report
@CONTENT:I'm working on a reporting web application using JasperReport and Spring MVC 3 to show generated reports (html) into web pages. I'm new to both frameworks and I'm having troubles rendering images in html reports. Tomcat log: No mapping found for HTTP request with URI [/<app-name>/<image-name>] in DispatcherServlet with name '<app-name>' I guess that images in the report are not shown probably due to the DispatcherServlet mapping url: <url-pattern>/</url-pattern>. Using the <mvc:resources /> tag could be the solution?

@TITLE:Howto: MySQL InnoDB corruption auto-repair after power failure?
@CONTENT:I have a temperature recording application running on linux with an Intel Atom machine with SSD as hardware. The application constantly inserts temperature data into InnoDB (4 records every 5 seconds). Because it is supplied by a generated DC power, and UPS is not an option; System power might be lost at anytime, even during the MySQL insertion. I do have a read only file system installed (AUFS for everything except for MySQL data dir) Assuming it is okay to lose last couple of MySQL records. Q: When it reboots back to normal, how can MySQL automatically repair the corrupted file? What's a good way to avoid/fix this problem? Thanks!!!

@TITLE:MongoDB: _id Cannot Be An Array
@CONTENT:I have a large dataset (about 1.1M documents) that I need to run mapreduce on. The field to group on is an array named xref. Due to the size of the collection and the fact I'm doing this in a 32-bit environment, I'm trying to reduce the collection to another collection in a new database. First, here's a data sample: { "_id" : ObjectId("4ec6d3aa61910ad451f12e01"), 
"bii" : -32.9867, 
"class" : 2456, 
"decdeg" : -82.4856,

          "CP-82   65","GC 4125" ] }

{ "_id" : ObjectId("4ec6d44661910ad451f78eba"), 
  "bii" : -32.9901, 
  "class" : 2450, 
  "decdeg" : -82.4781, 
  "decpm" : 0.013,
  "lii" : 297.4807, 
  "name" : "PPM 376283", 
  "radeg" : 50.3543, 
  "rapm" : 0.0357, 
  "vmag" : 8.4, 
  "xref" : ["HD 22237", "CPD -82   65", "-82   64","PPM 376283", "SAO 258336",
          "CP-82   65","GC 4125" ] }

{ "_id" : ObjectId("4ec6d48a61910ad451feae04"),

          "CP-82   65","GC 4125" ] }
 Here are the map and reduce functions (right now I'm only lii and bii fields): function map() {
try {
    emit(this.xref, {lii:this.lii, bii:this.bii});
} catch(e) {
}
}

function reduce(key, values) {

var result = {xref:key, lii: 0.0, bii: 0.0};
try {
    values.forEach(function(value) {

        if (value.lii && value.bii) {
            result.lii += value.lii;
            result.bii += value.bii;
        }
    });

    result.bii /= values.length;
    result.lii /= values.length;
} catch(e) {
}

return result;
}
 Unfortunately, running this eventually comes up with an error message: db.catalog.mapReduce(map, reduce, {out:{replace:"catalog2", db:"astro2"}});

 The xref field IS an array, but all values are equal in that array. Is it trying to use that array as the id field in the new collections?

    viewController = (ViewController *)[[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate];

    return self;

 The parser itself works well but it doesn't add any objects to the array in view controller in which the objects should be added. Can anyone help?

@LINK:/questions/8245172/tryfindresource-is-not-able-to-find-the-resource
@TITLE:TryFindResource is not able to find the resource
@CONTENT:I have a customized WPF control that is derived from UserControl. In the Resources section in my XAML file I have several templates and styles defined for the items that will be displayed on my custom control. Here is a definition for one of my styles to draw an downward pointing arrow.     <Style x:Key="ArrowStyle" TargetType="Path">
        <Setter Property="Margin" Value="4"/>
        <Setter Property="Stretch" Value="Uniform"/>
        <Setter Property="HorizontalAlignment" Value="Center"/>
        <Setter Property="VerticalAlignment" Value="Center"/>
        <Setter Property="Data" Value="M 0 0 L 5 5 L 10 0 Z"/>
        <Setter Property="Fill" Value="{DynamicResource FormText}"/>
    </Style>
 So, I have a custom buttom object that is derived from button. Basically it is a small square button that displays the arrow. In my constructor for my custom button I have the following code.         Path Arrow = new Path();
        Arrow.Style = TryFindResource("ArrowStyle") as Style;
 However, the call to TryFindResource fails indicated that it cannot location the resource. If I move the defined style into App.xaml it find it, but not when it is a custom control resource. What am I doing wrong or missing? Update The custom button that I am calling TryFindResource for does reside on the custom user control. However, since I am calling TryFindResource in the constructor of the custom button it will not actually reside on the custom user control at the time TryFindResource is called. After the custom button is created it will be added to the custom user control. Perhaps there is a different way or place to put the TryFindResource so that it is called after the button belongs to the control.
@CODE:<Style x:Key="ArrowStyle" TargetType="Path">
        <Setter Property="Margin" Value="4"/>

@CONTENT:I am creating a report that has a subreport with ireport. The data source for both is java beans. The problem is that when I create the data source expression for the subreport, I will use: new JRBeanCollectionDataSource($F{actions})
 which is found on many docs. When I compile I get: JRBeanCollectionDataSource?cannot?be?resolved?to?a?type
 I don't get it, it's a JasperReports class... how can it be missing. I even controlled the settings and the Jar with the class is in the classpath. What could be the reason?

@TITLE:Weighing Cross Domain Javascript Options
@CONTENT:I've got some intranet scripting I am trying to go cross domain with. I'm using jQuery 1.7 and trying to weigh my options. There are 3 options I know of. JSONP Setting Access-Control-Allow-Origin on the webserver header Writing a proxy page With JSONP I am limited to GET requests. I have some large data that I would like to post and it isn't feasible with URL length limits. Setting Access-Control-Allow-Origin on the server helps for any preflight requests jQuery might do before executing. But I'm at the mercy of browser constraints such as Chrome and IE6. I'm on Chrome 15 and going from localhost to any other domain immediately throws up. I've read the IE7+ native XmlHttpReq charts and I thought this would be a good solution as I'm going from intranet to intranet only but I guess not for even the latest chrome. Writing a proxy page will work but I think it might be too much up front work. I'm bouncing in between .NET WCF web services and have enough to worry about with wrapping SOAP requests and setting content types. So what are your thoughts? Are there considerations I am missing to have this work in Chrome? I can ignore anything less than IE7. Or should I just go with the page proxy method?

@LINK:/questions/8242520/correct-oop-practice-for-class-properties-tied-by-logic
@TITLE:Correct OOP Practice for class properties tied by logic
@CONTENT:I have a class called 'documentsection' which defines part of a document that later gets assembled in HTML. There are properties within it, and which values are required (or valid) depend on one another. For example: a) There is an enumeration called 'section type' which can be 'view' (in this case, another property called 'content' contains the path/filename of a file to read in). Or it can be 'text' where the 'content' property text is itself placed in the document. b) There is another enumeration called 'Action' which can be of type 'append', 'prepend' or 'replacebytag'. In the last case, another property becomes relevant, called 'tagtoreplace'. If we are appending/prepending, this tagtoreplace property can be empty. What is the best practice way to represent such interdependencies? There are several ways I can think of, none of which reek with beauty: When the method to 'generate the document' is called, go through the properties to ensure they conform to this logic. Put checks in the get/set methods. One issue with this is that when I set my section type to 'view' I may not set my 'content' property until a line or so afterwards - so you can't reject the request to set it at that point. Use separate properties somehow to partition the uses - eg 'content' in my first example above shouldn't be used for a filepath in one case and a bunch of HTML content in another. This doesn't smell right to me, but having separate properties for each seems excessive. Inherit subclasses, each with different sets of the additional needed properties. Since there can be various combinations of section type and action type, I can't think of an elegant way to bake all this logic into such a structure. But I'm no OOP guru! Any thoughts on the best approach? Thanks!

@TITLE:How can I bind one property to another property, offset by a specific amount?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to bind two points of a line to two Ellipses, which are inside ScatterViewItems. At the moment, I'm able to bind to ActualCenter.X and .Y for the ScatterViewItem, which works, but because the ellipse is not the only element in that ScatterViewItem (there is also a label), it's off-center, such that the line's endpoints are not the center of the ellipse. Ellipse doesn't have an ActualCenter property. I wanted to know whether I'm able to offset a property binding by a fixed amount, or whether there is some other kind of binding I can use such that I can work out the correct ellipse center in the container class (for the ellipse, label and scatterviewitem), and return that as the source of the binding. Below is the code where I am setting the binding. this.avatar refers to a Line shape. node_one and node_two are the container objects, which contain a ScatterViewItem. The Node class also contains the Ellipse, the centre for which I would essentially like as the source, but I'm happy with a simple offset of the current source.         BindingOperations.SetBinding(this.avatar, Line.X1Property, new Binding
        {
            Source = node_one.getScatterViewItem(),
            Path = new PropertyPath("ActualCenter.X")
        });
        BindingOperations.SetBinding(this.avatar, Line.Y1Property, new Binding
        {
            Source = node_one.GetNodeCenterY(),
            Path = new PropertyPath("GetNodeCenterY()")
        });

        // Bind line.(X2,Y2) to destination.ActualCenter  
        BindingOperations.SetBinding(this.avatar, Line.X2Property, new Binding
        {
            Source = node_two.getScatterViewItem(),
            Path = new PropertyPath("ActualCenter.X")
        });
        BindingOperations.SetBinding(this.avatar, Line.Y2Property, new Binding
        {
            Source = node_two.GetNodeCenterY(),
            Path = new PropertyPath("GetNodeCenterY()")
        });
 I attempted to set to the Source as node_one and Path as new PropertyPath("getOffsetCenter()") which returns a double, but it didn't work. It didn't complain, but it didn't work :) Any tips are appreciated :) Edit, trying to use IValueConverter: [ValueConversion(typeof(Double), typeof(Double))]
public class OffsetValues : IValueConverter
{
    public object Convert(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, CultureInfo culture)
    {
        DateTime date = (DateTime)value;
        Double y = (Double)value;
        Double offset = (Double)parameter;
        return y + offset;
    }

    public object ConvertBack(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, CultureInfo culture)
    {
        Double dblValue = (Double)value;
        Double offset = (Double)parameter;
        Double resultDblValue = dblValue - offset;
        return resultDblValue;
    }
}
 The above was added as a new class, but how would I attach it to the source of my binding - the example at MSDN has a XAML based implementation but mine is all programmatic.
@CODE:this.avatar Line node_one node_two ScatterViewItem Node Ellipse BindingOperations.SetBinding(this.avatar, Line.X1Property, new Binding
        {
            Source = node_one.getScatterViewItem(),
            Path = new PropertyPath("ActualCenter.X")
        });
        BindingOperations.SetBinding(this.avatar, Line.Y1Property, new Binding
        {
            Source = node_one.GetNodeCenterY(),
