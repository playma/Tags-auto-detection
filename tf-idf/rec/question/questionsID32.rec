@TITLE:OpenGL or Direct3D for a new Windows game project? Or something else?
@CONTENT:I'm starting a hobby game project on Windows that will make heavy use of 3D graphics effects. It will most likely be written in C++. Should I use OpenGL or Direct3D for my graphics backend? Why? Or should I use a ready-made graphics engine such as OGRE 3D? Which one? Some "how to get started" links would be useful. (On either technology, or both.) Edit - Yes I really meant Direct3D, not DirectX, thanks to graham.reeds for clarification Edit - Mihai Lazar pointed out that I could also use a graphics engine such OGRE 3D. Edited the question to reflect this alternative.

@TITLE:ASP.NET MVC: Structuring Controllers
@CONTENT:So I'm embarking on an ASP.NET MVC project and while the experience has been a good one overall, I'm not quite as pleased with the spaghetti mess that my controllers have become. I've looked around online (CodeCampServer, etc...) and they all seem to suffer the same issue wherein controller methods violate SRP (single responsibility principle) pretty consistently - such as a controller method that simply renders the view if the request is a GET but updates the model if it's a POST. Now I've got controller methods responsible for multiple logical routes throughout the application - say it checks for which button was clicked on the form and acts accordingly. I could redirect each button click to a different form action using JavaScript, but something doesn't feel right there either... The other big issue is the proliferation of magic strings - ViewData["foo"] = blah; Long story short, how do you guys structure your controller logic? One giant model object per view? Lots of little controller methods and JavaScript is the router? My goal is maintainable code - as features get piled on I'm starting to slide down that slippery slope...

@TITLE:What are some web-based knowledge-base solutions?
@CONTENT:I've used a WordPress blog and a Screwturn Wiki (at two separate jobs) to store private, company-specific KB info, but I'm looking for something that was created to be a knowledge base. Specifically, I'd like to see: Free/low cost Simple method for users to subscribe to KB (or just sections) to get updates Ability to do page versioning/audit changes Limit access to certain pages for certain users Very simple method of posting/editing articles Very simple method of adding images to articles Excellent (fast, accurate) searching abilities Ability to rate and comment on articles I liked using the Wordpress blog because it allowed me to use Live Writer to add/edit articles and images, but it didn't have page versioning (that I could see). I like using Screwturn wiki because of it's ability to track article versions, and I like it's clean look, but some non-technical people balk at the input and editing.

@TITLE:What is Your Experience with Unit Testing in Practice?
@CONTENT://Yes, Virginia, there is a wikipedia. What I'm asking here is what you've found unit testing to be in your own practice. It would be helpful to know the pros, cons, obstacles to introducing unit testing, flaws in the unit testing process, value gained by unit testing, and so on that the developers here have observed in their day to day practice. What we're doing: I work on a web application w/ an Oracle backend. The application has been in production for 8+ years, and there are ongoing enhancement efforts along with the maintenance work. My development team does Unit Test Scripts (UTS) that aim to walk a developer through the unit test of a given code package. These UTS are 2-20 page Word documents that describe the purpose of the package, the structure, and elaborate on given modules within a package. The UTS concludes with a section that describes an Application Test of the package. This doesn't sound like unit testing to me. It sounds a lot more like system integration testing w/ a description of the package. It certainly is not automated. With our UTS practice in its current state, managing/editing/follwing the documents is not a trivial task. And when enhancements or maintenance work to a given package is needed, there are not strict testing procedures put in place to guarantee outputs are satisfactory. Instead, we have this higher level UTS to follow, which does not come close to guaranteeing correct output in various code traces.

@TITLE:Editing database records by multiple users
@CONTENT:I have designed database tables (normalised, on an MS SQL server) and created a standalone windows front end for an application that will be used by a handful of users to add and edit information. We will add a web interface to allow searching accross our production area at a later date. I am concerned that if two users start editing the same record then the last to commit the update would be the 'winner' and important information may be lost. A number of solutions come to mind but I'm not sure if I am going to create a bigger headache. Do nothing and hope that two users are never going to be editing the same record at the same time. - Might never happed but what if it does? Editing routine could store a copy of the original data as well as the updates and then compare when the user has finished editing. If they differ show user and comfirm update - Would require two copies of data to be stored. Add last updated DATETIME column and check it matches when we update, if not then show differences. - requires new column in each of the relevant tables. Create an editing table that registers when users start editing a record that will be checked and prevent other users from editing same record. - would require carful thought of program flow to prevent deadlocks and records becoming locked if a user crashes out of the program. Are there any better solutions or should I go for one of these?

@TITLE:Why destructor disabling the generation of implicit move functions
@CONTENT:I was trying to understand what the rule of zero says by reading one of the blog https://rmf.io/cxx11/rule-of-zero/ and if i am correct it says if you declare your own Dtor then don't forget to make the rest two move ctor/move assignment as default. Example:from http://scottmeyers.blogspot.in/2014/03/a-concern-about-rule-of-zero.html class Widget {
public:
  ~Widget();         // temporary destructor
  ...                // no copy or move functions
};
 "The addition of the destructor has the side effect of disabling generation of the move functions, but because Widget is copyable, all the code that used to generate moves will now generate copies. In other words, adding a destructor to the class has caused presumably-efficient moves to be silently replaced with presumably-less-efficient copies". The above text by Scott inside the quotes raise some questions in my mind why declaring Dtor hide move semantics??is declaring/definig Dtor only hide the move semantics or copy ctor/copy assignment as well hide the move semantics?

@LINK:/questions/32812663/in-class-static-const-odr
@TITLE:In class static const ODR
@CONTENT:I am a bit confused by the static in-class initialization of a const member. For example, in the code below: #include <iostream>

struct Foo
{
    const static int n = 42;
};

// const int Foo::n; // No ODR

void f(const int& param)
{
    std::cout << param << std::endl;
}

int g(const int& param)
{
    return param;
}

template<int N>
void h()
{
    std::cout << N << std::endl;
}

int main()
{
    // f(Foo::n); // linker error, both g++/clang++
    std::cout << g(Foo::n) << std::endl; // OK in g++ only with -O(1,2 or 3) flag, why?!
    h<Foo::n>(); // this should be fine
}
 Live example I do not define Foo::n (the line is commented). So, I expect the call f(Foo::n) to fail at link time, and indeed it does. However, the following line std::cout << g(Foo::n) << std::endl; compiles and links fine only by gcc (clang still emits a linker error) whenever I use an optimization flag such as -O1/2/3. Why does gcc (tried with gcc5.2.0 and gcc 4.9.3) compile and link the code when the optimization is turned on? And am I correct to say that the only usage of in-class static const members is in constant expressions, such as template parameters like in the h<Foo::n> call, in which case the code should link?
@CODE:static const #include <iostream>

struct Foo
{
    const static int n = 42;
};

// const int Foo::n; // No ODR

void f(const int& param)
{
    std::cout << param << std::endl;
}

int g(const int& param)
{
    return param;
}

template<int N>
void h()
{
    std::cout << N << std::endl;
}

{
    // f(Foo::n); // linker error, both g++/clang++

@TITLE:How to create a handshake between PHP web server and Socket.io on node.js server?
@CONTENT:I have a websocket running on node.js 4.0 on server 10.0.4.18 at port 8020. I implemented my websocket using socket.io v1.3, express, and express-session. Project Definition I need to be able to create a session in socket.io for every user that connects to it from a PHP application. After the user send the first HTTP request, I will authenticate them using a token that will be passed from PHP to socket.io along with the HTTP request. After the user is authenticated, I need to save some personal data inside socket.io session to reuse later. Every time the user refresh the PHP application, socket.io will need to know the session data that is already created. Problem Every time the user reloads/refreshed the PHP page "where he/she connected from", the session data are lost. The server fails to know that connection belong to session XYZ which is previously created created. I am not sure how to create a handshake between PHP and node.js where the two server can exchange a unique data to tie the socket.io session to. Very close look at the problem I opened this link https://10.0.4.18:8020/set/MikeA in my browser. "This created a session for me directly from node.js per the route code" Then I connected to the websocket using PHP, now I can see that the session sticks with no problem! I was able to open multiple tabs in the browser and the same session is there as expected. The reason it worked this time is because the url https://10.0.4.18:8020/set/MikeA established a session and tied it between my browser and the session and from there I was able to read/write my session from socket.io using express-socket.io-session package https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-socket.io-session. But if I do not create the session using the url manually the session will only be good for one page load only. And every time the page is reloaded the session is destroyed like it never existed! Question I need to develop the same behavior when connection to the websocket via https://10.0.4.18:8020/set/MikeA when connecting from the socket.io. How can I establish a handshake between PHP server and socket.io where the two servers can tie the session data to the correct user every time the PHP page is reloaded or a new browser's tab is opened?

@TITLE:HTML CSS automatically adjust height
@CONTENT:I am trying to display outbound and inbound flight by visualising it using CSS/LESS. The problem is that when Outbound flight has more airport changes then Inbound then line stays at the level of first flight. I want line adjust height dynamically based on the longest route.

@TITLE:VS 2015: No highlighting and intellisense in JS files
@CONTENT:I can't really reproduce the issue, but no highlighting or intellisense is working in .js files, it works just fine in .json files however. The default editor for .js files is JSON Editor. I tried safe-mode, disabling all extensions, resetting all settings, and I even reinstalled the IDE (repair), but the issue still persists. I will add, that when I launch the IDE and a JS file is open on scope, I get the following error message (highlighting and intellisense don't work anyway): The 'JavaScriptWebExtensionPackage' package did not load correctly. The problem may have been caused by a configuration change or by the installation of another extension. You can get more information examining the file 'C:\Users\Shimmy\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\VisualStudio\14.0\ActivityLog.xml'. Restarting Visual Studio could help resolve the issue. Continue to show this error message? Here you can view the ActivityLog.xml file, I pasted in some of the recent lines I think might be relevant: <entry>

@TITLE:How to efficiently write large files to disk on background thread (Swift)
@CONTENT:Update I have resolved and removed the distracting error. Please read the entire post and feel free to leave comments if any questions remain. Background I am attempting to write relatively large files (video) to disk on iOS using Swift 2.0, GCD, and a completion handler. I would like to know if there is a more efficient way to perform this task. The task needs to be done without blocking the Main UI, while using completion logic, and also ensuring that the operation happens as quickly as possible. I have custom objects with an NSData property so I am currently experimenting using an extension on NSData. As an example an alternate solution might include using NSFilehandle or NSStreams coupled with some form of thread safe behavior that results in much faster throughput than the NSData writeToURL function on which I base the current solution. What's wrong with NSData Anyway? Please note the following discussion taken from the NSData Class Reference, (Saving Data). I do perform writes to my temp directory however the main reason that I am having an issue is that I can see a noticeable lag in the UI when dealing with large files. This lag is precisely because NSData is not asynchronous (and Apple Docs note that atomic writes can cause performance issues on "large" files ~ > 1mb). So when dealing with large files one is at the mercy of whatever internal mechanism is at work within the NSData methods. I did some more digging and found this info from Apple..."This method is ideal for converting data:// URLs to NSData objects, and can also be used for reading short files synchronously. If you need to read potentially large files, use inputStreamWithURL: to open a stream, then read the file a piece at a time." (NSData Class Reference, Objective-C, +dataWithContentsOfURL). This info seems to imply that I could try using streams to write the file out on a background thread if moving the writeToURL to the background thread (as suggested by @jtbandes) is not sufficient. The NSData class and its subclasses provide methods to quickly and easily save their contents to disk. To minimize the risk of data loss, these methods provide the option of saving the data atomically. Atomic writes guarantee that the data is either saved in its entirety, or it fails completely. The atomic write begins by writing the data to a temporary file. If this write succeeds, then the method moves the temporary file to its final location. While atomic write operations minimize the risk of data loss due to corrupt or partially-written files, they may not be appropriate when writing to a temporary directory, the users home directory or other publicly accessible directories. Any time you work with a publicly accessible file, you should treat that file as an untrusted and potentially dangerous resource. An attacker may compromise or corrupt these files. The attacker can also replace the files with hard or symbolic links, causing your write operations to overwrite or corrupt other system resources. Avoid using the writeToURL:atomically: method (and the related methods) when working inside a publicly accessible directory. Instead initialize an NSFileHandle object with an existing file descriptor and use the NSFileHandle methods to securely write the file. Other Alternatives One article on Concurrent Programming at objc.io provides interesting options on "Advanced: File I/O in the Background". Some of the options involve use of an InputStream as well. Apple also has some older references to reading and writing files asynchronously. I am posting this question in anticipation of Swift alternatives. Example of an appropriate answer Here is an example of an appropriate answer that might satisfy this type of question. (Taken for the Stream Programming Guide, Writing To Output Streams) Using an NSOutputStream instance to write to an output stream requires several steps: Create and initialize an instance of NSOutputStream with a repository for the written data. Also set a delegate. Schedule the stream object on a run loop and open the stream. Handle the events that the stream object reports to its delegate. If the stream object has written data to memory, obtain the data by requesting the NSStreamDataWrittenToMemoryStreamKey property. When there is no more data to write, dispose of the stream object. I am looking for the most proficient algorithm that applies to writing extremely large files to iOS using Swift, APIs, or possibly even C/ObjC would suffice. I can transpose the algorithm into appropriate Swift compatible constructs. Nota Bene I understand the informational error below. It is included for completeness. This question is asking whether or not there is a better algorithm to use for writing large files to disk with a guaranteed dependency sequence (e.g. NSOperation dependencies). If there is please provide enough information (description/sample for me to reconstruct pertinent Swift 2.0 compatible code). Please advise if I am missing any information that would help answer the question. Note on the extension I've added a completion handler to the base writeToURL to ensure that no unintended resource sharing occurs. My dependent tasks that use the file should never face a race condition. extension NSData {

    func writeToURL(named:String, completion: (result: Bool, url:NSURL?) -> Void)  {

       let filePath = NSTemporaryDirectory() + named
       //var success:Bool = false
       let tmpURL = NSURL( fileURLWithPath:  filePath )
       weak var weakSelf = self


      dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0), {
                //write to URL atomically
                if weakSelf!.writeToURL(tmpURL, atomically: true) {

                        if NSFileManager.defaultManager().fileExistsAtPath( filePath ) {
                            completion(result: true, url:tmpURL)                        
                        } else {
                            completion (result: false, url:tmpURL)
                        }
                    }
            })

        }
    }
 This method is used to process the custom objects data from a controller using: var items = [AnyObject]()
if let video = myCustomClass.data {

    //video is of type NSData        
    video.writeToURL("shared.mp4", completion: { (result, url) -> Void in
        if result {
            items.append(url!)
            if items.count > 0 {

                let sharedActivityView = UIActivityViewController(activityItems: items, applicationActivities: nil)

                self.presentViewController(sharedActivityView, animated: true) { () -> Void in
                //finished
    }
}
        }
     })
}
 Conclusion The Apple Docs on Core Data Performance provide some good advice on dealing with memory pressure and managing BLOBs. This is really one heck of an article with a lot of clues to behavior and how to moderate the issue of large files within your app. Now although it is specific to Core Data and not files, the warning on atomic writing does tell me that I ought to implement methods that write atomically with great care. With large files, the only safe way to manage writing seems to be adding in a completion handler (to the write method) and showing an activity view on the main thread. Whether one does that with a stream or by modifying an existing API to add completion logic is up to the reader. I've done both in the past and am in the midst of testing for best performance. Until then, I'm changing the solution to remove all binary data properties from Core Data and replacing them with strings to hold asset URLs on disk. I am also leveraging the built in functionality from Assets Library and PHAsset to grab and store all related asset URLs. When or if I need to copy any assets I will use standard API methods (export methods on PHAsset/Asset Library) with completion handlers to notify user of finished state on the main thread. (Really useful snippets from the Core Data Performance article) Reducing Memory Overhead It is sometimes the case that you want to use managed objects on a temporary basis, for example to calculate an average value for a particular attribute. This causes your object graph, and memory consumption, to grow. You can reduce the memory overhead by re-faulting individual managed objects that you no longer need, or you can reset a managed object context to clear an entire object graph. You can also use patterns that apply to Cocoa programming in general. You can re-fault an individual managed object using NSManagedObjectContexts refreshObject:mergeChanges: method. This has the effect of clearing its in-memory property values thereby reducing its memory overhead. (Note that this is not the same as setting the property values to nilXthe values will be retrieved on demand if the fault is firedXsee Faulting and Uniquing.) When you create a fetch request you can set includesPropertyValues to NO > to reduce memory overhead by avoiding creation of objects to represent the property values. You should typically only do so, however, if you are sure that either you will not need the actual property data or you already have the information in the row cache, otherwise you will incur multiple trips to the persistent store. You can use the reset method of NSManagedObjectContext to remove all managed objects associated with a context and "start over" as if you'd just created it. Note that any managed object associated with that context will be invalidated, and so you will need to discard any references to and re-fetch any objects associated with that context in which you are still interested. If you iterate over a lot of objects, you may need to use local autorelease pool blocks to ensure temporary objects are deallocated as soon as possible. If you do not intend to use Core Datas undo functionality, you can reduce your application's resource requirements by setting the contexts undo manager to nil. This may be especially beneficial for background worker threads, as well as for large import or batch operations. Finally, Core Data does not by default keep strong references to managed objects (unless they have unsaved changes). If you have lots of objects in memory, you should determine the owning references. Managed objects maintain strong references to each other through relationships, which can easily create strong reference cycles. You can break cycles by re-faulting objects (again by using the refreshObject:mergeChanges: method of NSManagedObjectContext). Large Data Objects (BLOBs) If your application uses large BLOBs ("Binary Large OBjects" such as image and sound data), you need to take care to minimize overheads. The exact definition of small, modest, and large is fluid and depends on an applications usage. A loose rule of thumb is that objects in the order of kilobytes in size are of a modest sized and those in the order of megabytes in size are large sized. Some developers have achieved good performance with 10MB BLOBs in a database. On the other hand, if an application has millions of rows in a table, even 128 bytes might be a "modest" sized CLOB (Character Large OBject) that needs to be normalized into a separate table. In general, if you need to store BLOBs in a persistent store, you should use an SQLite store. The XML and binary stores require that the whole object graph reside in memory, and store writes are atomic (see Persistent Store Features) which means that they do not efficiently deal with large data objects. SQLite can scale to handle extremely large databases. Properly used, SQLite provides good performance for databases up to 100GB, and a single row can hold up to 1GB (although of course reading 1GB of data into memory is an expensive operation no matter how efficient the repository). A BLOB often represents an attribute of an entityXfor example, a photograph might be an attribute of an Employee entity. For small to modest sized BLOBs (and CLOBs), you should create a separate entity for the data and create a to-one relationship in place of the attribute. For example, you might create Employee and Photograph entities with a one-to-one relationship between them, where the relationship from Employee to Photograph replaces the Employee's photograph attribute. This pattern maximizes the benefits of object faulting (see Faulting and Uniquing). Any given photograph is only retrieved if it is actually needed (if the relationship is traversed). It is better, however, if you are able to store BLOBs as resources on the filesystem, and to maintain links (such as URLs or paths) to those resources. You can then load a BLOB as and when necessary. Note: I've moved the logic below into the completion handler (see the code above) and I no longer see any error. As mentioned before this question is about whether or not there is a more performant way to process large files in iOS using Swift. When attempting to process the resulting items array to pass to a UIActvityViewController, using the following logic: if items.count > 0 { let sharedActivityView = UIActivityViewController(activityItems: items, applicationActivities: nil) self.presentViewController(sharedActivityView, animated: true) { () -> Void in //finished} } I am seeing the following error: Communications error: { count = 1, contents = "XPCErrorDescription" => { length = 22, contents = "Connection interrupted" } }> (please note, I am looking for a better design, not an answer to this error message)

@TITLE:How to manage Services in Angular2
@CONTENT:Angular 2 : 2.0.0-alpha.31 / Typescript 1.5 Currently I manage my service as a simple Class, then I inject this Class into an other component. Example: export class PlayerService {
  http: Http;
  players = [];

  constructor( @Inject(Http) http) {
        this.http = http;
  }

  getAll(callback) {
        this.http.get('/data/players.json')
              .toRx()
              .map((res) => res.json())
              .subscribe((data) => {
                    this.players= data;
                    callback(data);
              });
  }

  add(player) {
        //call webservice to save user  
        this.players.push(player); //only if save has work  
  }
  delete(player) {
        //Not implemented yet   
  }
  get(id) {
        //Not implemented yet   
  }
}
 I think, I'm doing it the wrong way.. I'm using http.get().toRx().subscribe() ? I thought I saw that some people return the Observable directly from toRx() If two components ask for players (getAll()) at the same time, two queries will be executed. Do I have to manage flag or is there another way ? I'm working here with a callback. What do I have to do if I want the data "immediately" (no async) Will components be automatically informed about players add/remove ? Do I have to use some kind of event to handle this (any example?) ? So my question is : Is there a common way to manage Services in Angular2 ?
@CODE:Class Class export class PlayerService {
  http: Http;
  players = [];

  constructor( @Inject(Http) http) {
        this.http = http;
  }

  getAll(callback) {
        this.http.get('/data/players.json')
              .toRx()
              .map((res) => res.json())
              .subscribe((data) => {
                    this.players= data;
                    callback(data);
              });
  }

  add(player) {
        //call webservice to save user  
        this.players.push(player); //only if save has work  
  }
  delete(player) {
        //Not implemented yet   
  }
  get(id) {
        //Not implemented yet   
  }
} http.get().toRx().subscribe() Observable toRx() getAll() components

@TITLE:Non-Scrolling Fragment in a ViewPager inside CoordinatorLayout

</android.support.design.widget.CoordinatorLayout>
 But in one Fragment with a FrameLayout as the root view, I need to have a button that is anchored to the bottom, but it appears to be drawn off-screen. To be able to see it, I need to add a bottom padding equals to the height of the Toolbar.   <FrameLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"

    <TextView
        android:id="@+id/textView"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"

        android:layout_gravity="center"
        android:text="Home screen"
        android:textAppearance="?android:attr/textAppearanceLarge" />

    <TextView

        android:text="@string/brand"
        android:textColor="@color/brandColor"
        android:textSize="20sp" />
</FrameLayout>
 Likewise, a layout_gravity set to 'center' on an element does not appear to be in the center of the visible area for this fragment. My understanding is that CoordinatorLayout is only intented to work with scrolling contents, is that correct ? So that using only regular ViewGroup such as FrameLayout, RelativeLayout, LinearLayout for the ViewPager fragments will have their bottom part drawn off-screen ? In that case, do I need to remove this button from this fragment layout and move it to the activity layout containing the CoordinatorLayout ? It needs to be shown only on the first fragment.

@CONTENT:Using both gcc with -std=c11 and g++ with -std=c++14. E.g. for a file named src/dir/Hello.cxx it should expand to something like e.g.: const char basename[] = "Hello";

 as where getStaticBasename() is a macro (for C sources) or constexpr function (for C++ sources) which results to "Hello". I have to avoid splitting the string from __FILE__ at runtime, because the path and suffix must not be compiled into the executable in any way. The solution must be without dependencies to huge libraries such as boost. As I have no makefiles, solutions like this cannot be used in my case. Did one have a solution for that? Edit 2015-07-02: I have no influence on how the compiler and linker was invoked (sometimes via makefile, sometimes from command line, or some IDE (Eclipse CDT managed make, Crossworks, Xcode et cetera. So the solution needs to be in code only. My use case is to provide some kind of "generic region identifier" for a small footprint logging solution. The application code (which uses my logger) should only #include <Joe/Logger.h> and within the later calls to e.g. LOG_DEBUG(...) I'll implicitely take use of the automatically generated "generic region identifier". My current solution is that the application code have to declare a JOE_LOG_FILE_REGION(Hello); (after #include <Joe/Logger.h>) before it could place LOG_DEBUG(...) in its code.
@CODE:src/dir/Hello.cxx const char basename[] = "Hello"; const char basename[] = getStaticBasename(__FILE__); getStaticBasename() __FILE__ #include <Joe/Logger.h> LOG_DEBUG(...) JOE_LOG_FILE_REGION(Hello); #include <Joe/Logger.h> LOG_DEBUG(...) constexpr __FILE__

@CONTENT:We were using Google Maps without key and because of our traffic increase we had to create and add the API key in our JS call. But now, when we are calling the JS we are receiving this error: RefererDeniedMapError: https://developers.google.com/maps/faq#errorcodes In the documentation we don't see more information related to this error. With the same API key we don't have any problem to show the map in our other domains, only we have the problem in one.

@LINK:/questions/29992904/enumerate-factors-of-a-number-directly-in-ascending-order-without-sorting
@TITLE:Enumerate factors of a number directly in ascending order without sorting?
@CONTENT:Is there an efficient algorithm to enumerate the factors of a number n, in ascending order, without sorting? By efficient I mean: The algorithm avoids a brute-force search for divisors by starting with the prime-power factorization of n. The runtime complexity of the algorithm is O(d log? d) or better, where d is the divisor count of n. The spatial complexity of the algorithm is O(d). The algorithm avoids a sort operation. That is, the factors are produced in order rather than produced out of order and sorted afterward. Although enumerating using a simple recursive approach and then sorting is O(d log? d), there is a very ugly cost for all the memory accesses involved in sorting. A trivial example is n = 360 = 2?  3?  5, which has d=24 factors: { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 24, 30, 36, 40, 45, 60, 72, 90, 120, 180, 360 }. A more serious example is n = 278282512406132373381723386382308832000 = 2?  3?  5?  7?  11?  13?  17  19  23  29  31  37  41  43  47  53  59  61  67  71  73  79, which has d=318504960 factors (obviously too many to list here!). This number, incidentally, has the greatest number of factors of any number up to 2^128. I could swear that I saw a description of such algorithm a few weeks ago, with sample code, but now I can't seem to find it anywhere. It used some magic trick of maintaining a list of progenitor indexes in the output list for each prime factor. (Update: I was confusing factor generation with Hamming numbers, which operate similarly.) Update I ended up using a solution which is O(d) in runtime, has extremely low memory overhead creating the O(d) output in-place, and is significantly faster than any other method I am aware of. I've posted this solution as answer, with C source code. It is a heavily optimized, simplified version of a beautiful algorithm presented here in Haskell by another contributor, Will Ness. I've selected Will's answer as the accepted answer, as it provided a very elegant solution that matched all the requirements as originally stated.

Netherlands,Zuid-holland,Rotterdam,LoremAve,3,...,...
...
 This is a multi-gigabyte file. I have a class that reads this file and exposes these lines (records) as an IEnumerable<MyObject>. This MyObject has several properties (Country,Province,City, ...) etc. As you can see there is a LOT of duplication of data. I want to keep exposing the underlying data as an IEnumerable<MyObject>. However, some other class might (and probably will) make some hierarchical view/structure of this data like: Netherlands
    Noord-holland
        Amsterdam
            FooStreet [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
            BarRoad [1, 2, 3, 4]
            ...
        Amstelveen
            BazDrive [1, 2, 3]
            ...
         ...
    Zuid-holland
        Rotterdam
            LoremAve [1, 2, 3]
            ...
        ...
    ...
...
 When reading this file, I do, essentially, this: foreach (line in myfile) {
    fields = line.split(",");
    yield return new MyObject {
        Country = fields[0],
        Province = fields[1],
        City = fields[2],
        Street = fields[3],
        //...other fields
    };
}
 Now, to the actual question at hand: I could use string.Intern() to intern the Country, Province, City, and Street strings (those are the main 'vilains', the MyObject has several other properties not relevant to the question). foreach (line in myfile) {
    fields = line.split(",");
    yield return new MyObject {
        Country = string.Intern(fields[0]),
        Province = string.Intern(fields[1]),
        City = string.Intern(fields[2]),
        Street = string.Intern(fields[3]),
        //...other fields
    };
}
 This will save about 42% of memory (tested and measured) when holding the entire dataset in memory since all duplicate strings will be a reference to the same string. Also, when creating the hierarchical structure with a lot of LINQ's .ToDictionary() method the keys (Country, Province etc.) of the resp. dictionaries will be much more efficient. However, one of the drawbacks (aside a slight loss of performance, which is not problem) of using string.Intern() is that the strings won't be garbage collected anymore. But when I'm done with my data I do want all that stuff garbage collected (eventually). I could use a Dictionary<string, string> to 'intern' this data but I don't like the "overhead" of having a key and value where I am, actually, only interested in the key. I could set the value to null or the use the same string as value (which will result in the same reference in key and value). It's only a small price of a few bytes to pay, but it's still a price. Something like a HashSet<string> makes more sense to me. However, I cannot get a reference to a string in the HashSet; I can see if the HashSet contains a specific string, but not get a reference to that specific instance of the located string in the HashSet. I could implement my own HashSet for this, but I am wondering what other solutions you kind StackOverflowers may come up with. Requirements: My "FileReader" class needs to keep exposing an IEnumerable<MyObject> My "FileReader" class may do stuff (like string.Intern()) to optimize memory usage The MyObject class cannot change; I won't make a City class, Country class etc. and have MyObject expose those as properties instead of simple string properties Goal is to be (more) memory efficient by de-duplicating most of the duplicate strings in Country, Province, City etc.; how this is achieved (e.g. string interning, internal hashset / collection / structure of something) is not important. However: I know I can stuff the data in a database or use other solutions in such direction; I am not interested in these kind of solutions. Speed is only of secondary concern; the quicker the better ofcourse but a (slight) loss in performance while reading/iterating the objects is no problem Since this is a long-running process (as in: windows service running 24/7/365) that, occasionally, processes a bulk of this data I want the data to be garbage-collected when I'm done with it; string interning works great but will, in the long run, result in a huge string pool with lots of unused data I would like any solutions to be "simple"; adding 15 classes with P/Invokes and inline assembly (exaggerated) is not worth the effort. Code maintainability is high on my list. This is more of a 'theoretical' question; it's purely out of curiosity / interest that I'm asking. There is no "real" problem, but I can see that in similar situations this might be a problem to someone. For example: I could do something like this: public class StringInterningObject
{
    private HashSet<string> _items;

    public StringInterningObject()
    {
        _items = new HashSet<string>();
    }

    public string Add(string value)
    {
        if (_items.Add(value))
            return value;  //New item added; return value since it wasn't in the HashSet
        //MEH... this will quickly go O(n)
        return _items.First(i => i.Equals(value)); //Find (and return) actual item from the HashSet and return it
    }
}
 But with a large set of (to be de-duplicated) strings this will quickly bog down. I could have a peek at the reference source for HashSet or Dictionary or... and build a similar class that doesn't return bool for the Add() method but the actual string found in the internals/bucket. The best I could come up with until now is something like: public class StringInterningObject
{
    private ConcurrentDictionary<string, string> _items;

    public StringInterningObject()
    {
        _items = new ConcurrentDictionary<string, string>();
    }

    public string Add(string value)
    {
        return _items.AddOrUpdate(value, value, (v, i) => i);
    }
}
 Which has the "penalty" of having a Key and a Value where I'm actually only interested in the Key. Just a few bytes though, small price to pay. Coincidally this also yields 42% less memory usage; the same result as when using string.Intern() yields. tolanj came up with System.Xml.NameTable: public class StringInterningObject
{
    private System.Xml.NameTable nt = new System.Xml.NameTable();

    public string Add(string value)
    {
        return nt.Add(value);
    }
}
 (I removed the lock and string.Empty check (the latter since the NameTable already does that)) xanatos came up with a CachingEqualityComparer: public class StringInterningObject
{
    private class CachingEqualityComparer<T> : IEqualityComparer<T> where T : class
    {
        public System.WeakReference X { get; private set; }
        public System.WeakReference Y { get; private set; }

        private readonly IEqualityComparer<T> Comparer;

        public CachingEqualityComparer()
        {
            Comparer = EqualityComparer<T>.Default;
        }

        public CachingEqualityComparer(IEqualityComparer<T> comparer)
        {
            Comparer = comparer;
        }

        public bool Equals(T x, T y)
        {
            bool result = Comparer.Equals(x, y);

            if (result)
            {
                X = new System.WeakReference(x);
                Y = new System.WeakReference(y);
            }

            return result;
        }

        public int GetHashCode(T obj)
        {
            return Comparer.GetHashCode(obj);
        }

        public T Other(T one)
        {
            if (object.ReferenceEquals(one, null))
            {
                return null;
            }

            object x = X.Target;
            object y = Y.Target;

            if (x != null && y != null)
            {
                if (object.ReferenceEquals(one, x))
                {
                    return (T)y;
                }
                else if (object.ReferenceEquals(one, y))
                {
                    return (T)x;
                }
            }

            return one;
        }
    }

    private CachingEqualityComparer<string> _cmp; 
    private HashSet<string> _hs;

    public StringInterningObject()
    {
        _cmp = new CachingEqualityComparer<string>();
        _hs = new HashSet<string>(_cmp);
    }

    public string Add(string item)
    {
        if (!_hs.Add(item))
            item = _cmp.Other(item);
        return item;
    }
}
 (Modified slightly to "fit" my "Add() interface") As per Henk Holterman's request: public class StringInterningObject
{
    private Dictionary<string, string> _items;

    public StringInterningObject()
    {
        _items = new Dictionary<string, string>();
    }

    public string Add(string value)
    {
        string result;
        if (!_items.TryGetValue(value, out result))
        {
            _items.Add(value, value);
            return value;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
 I'm just wondering if there's maybe a neater/better/cooler way to 'solve' my (not so much of an actual) problem. By now I have enough options I guess Here are some numbers I came up with for some simple, short, preliminary tests: Non optimized Memory: ~4,5Gb Load time: ~52s StringInterningObject (see above, the ConcurrentDictionary variant) Memory: ~2,6Gb Load time: ~49s string.Intern() Memory: ~2,3Gb Load time: ~45s System.Xml.NameTable Memory: ~2,3Gb Load time: ~41s CachingEqualityComparer Memory: ~2,3Gb Load time: ~58s StringInterningObject (see above, the (non-concurrent) Dictionary variant) as per Henk Holterman's request: Memory: ~2,3Gb Load time: ~39s Although the numbers aren't very definitive, it seems that the many memory-allocations for the non-optimized version actually slow down more than using either string.Intern() or the above StringInterningObjects which results in (slightly) longer load times. Also, string.Intern() seems to 'win' from StringInterningObject but not by a large margin; << See updates.

@TITLE:Enable template function if class has specific member function
@CONTENT:I wrote the following template function, which checks whether an arbitary container contains a specific element: template<template<class, class...> class container_t, class item_t, class... rest_t>
bool contains(const container_t<item_t, rest_t...> &_container, const item_t &_item) {
    for(const item_t &otherItem : _container) {
        if(otherItem == _item) { return true; }

 This works well for most containers. However for all kinds of sets (and maps) it is sub optimal since there we could use: template<template<class, class...> class set_t, class item_t, class... rest_t>
bool contains(const set_t<item_t, rest_t...> &_set, const item_t &_item) {
    return _set.count(_item) > 0;
}
 Obviously we can't use both templates simultaneously because of ambiguity. Now I am looking for a way to use std::enable_if to enable the to first template if container_t does not provide a count member function and the second template if it does.

@LINK:/questions/29290232/quickly-and-efficiently-calculating-an-eigenvector-for-known-eigenvalue
@TITLE:Quickly and efficiently calculating an eigenvector for known eigenvalue
@CONTENT:Short version of my question: What would be the optimal way of calculating an eigenvector for a matrix A, if we already know the eigenvalue belonging to the eigenvector? Longer explanation: I have a large stochastic matrix A which, because it is stochastic, has a non-negative left eigenvector x (such that A^Tx=x). I'm looking for quick and efficient methods of numerically calculating this vector. (Preferrably in MATLAB or numpy/scipy - since both of these wrap around ARPACK/LAPACK, any one would be fine). I know that 1 is the largest eigenvalue of A, so I know that calling something like this Python code: from scipy.sparse.linalg import eigs
vals, vecs = eigs(A, k=1)
 will result in vals = 1 and vecs equalling the vector I need. However, the thing that bothers me here is that calculating eigenvalues is, in general, a more difficult operation than solving a linear system, and, in general, if a matrix M has eigenvalue l, then finding the appropriate eigenvector is a matter of solving the equation (M - 1 * I) * x = 0, which is, in theory at least, an operation that is simpler than calculating an eigenvalue, since we are only solving a linear system, more specifically, finding the nullspace of a matrix. However, I find that all methods of nullspace calculation in MATLAB rely on svd calculation, a process I cannot afford to perform on a matrix of my size. I also cannot call solvers on the linear equation, because they all only find one solution, and that solution is 0 (which, yes, is a solution, but not the one I need). Is there any way to avoid calls to eigs-like function to solve my problem more quickly than by calculating the largest eigenvalue and accompanying eigenvector?
@CODE:A A x A^Tx=x 1 A from scipy.sparse.linalg import eigs
vals, vecs = eigs(A, k=1) vals = 1 vecs M l (M - 1 * I) * x = 0 MATLAB svd 0 eigs

@TITLE:Is there an elegant way to reduce an structure to a simple array?
@CONTENT:This is a typical array structure: $s = array ('etc'=>'etc', 'fields' => 
  array (
   0 => array (
     'name'=>'year', 'description'=>'Year of ...', 'type'=>'integer',
   ),
   1 =>  array (

   ),
   2 => array (
     'name' => 'xx', 'description' => 'Xx ...', 'type' => 'string',
   )
 ));
 Here is a non-elegant way (or "not so elegant way") to reduce the big array to a simple array containing just one column:  $fields = array();
 foreach ($strut['resources'][0]['schema']['fields'] as $r)
    $fields[] = $r['name'];
 This works, but is it possible to do the same with only one instruction? Perhaps using like array_reduce(), but I not see how. Here are other typical "elegance PHP problem":  $fieldsByName = array();
 foreach ($strut['resources'][0]['schema']['fields'] as $r)
    $fields[$r['name']] = array(
        'description' =>$r['description'],
        'type' =>$r['type']
    );
 Is there a PHP alternative? The idea here is to use the keyword (name in the example) as an array key, and the other elements as usual fields, so, the generic non-elegant algorithm is  $fieldsByName = array();
 foreach ($strut['resources'][0]['schema']['fields'] as $r){
    $key = $r['name'];
    unset($r['name']);
    $fields[$key] = $r;
 }

@LINK:/questions/29193445/implement-a-high-performance-mutex-similar-to-qts-one
@TITLE:Implement a high performance mutex similar to Qt's one
@CONTENT:I have a multi-thread scientific application where several computing threads (one per core) have to store their results in a common buffer. This requires a mutex mechanism. Working threads spend only a small fraction of their time writing to the buffer, so the mutex is unlocked most of the time, and locks have a high probability to succeed immediately without waiting for another thread to unlock. Currently, I have used Qt's QMutex for the task, and it works well : the mutex has a negligible overhead. However, I have to port it to c++11/STL only. When using std::mutex, the performance drops by 66% and the threads spend most of their time locking the mutex. After another question, I figured that Qt uses a fast locking mechanism based on a simple atomic flag, optimized for cases where the mutex is not already locked. And falls back to a system mutex when concurrent locking occurs. I would like to implement this in STL. Is there a simple way based on std::atomic and std::mutex ? I have digged in Qt's code but it seems overly complicated for my use (I do not need locks timeouts, pimpl, small footprint etc...). Edit : I have tried a spinlock, but this does not work well because : Periodically (every few seconds), another thread locks the mutexes and flushes the buffer. This takes some time, so all worker threads get blocked at this time. The spinlocks make the scheduling busy, causing the flush to be 10-100x slower than with a proper mutex. This is not acceptable Edit : I have tried this, but it's not working (locks all threads) class Mutex
{
public:
    Mutex() : lockCounter(0) { }

    void lock()
    {
        if(lockCounter.fetch_add(1, std::memory_order_acquire)>0)
        {
            std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(internalMutex);
            cv.wait(lock);
        }
    }

    void unlock();
    {
        if(lockCounter.fetch_sub(1, std::memory_order_release)>1)
        {
            cv.notify_one();
        }
    }


private:
    std::atomic<int> lockCounter;
    std::mutex internalMutex;
    std::condition_variable cv;
};
 Thanks! Edit : Final solution MikeMB's fast mutex was working pretty well. As a final solution, I did: Use a simple spinlock with a try_lock When a thread fails to try_lock, instead of waiting, they fill a queue (which is not shared with other threads) and continue When a thread gets a lock, it updates the buffer with the current result, but also with the results stored in the queue (it processes its queue) The buffer flushing was made much more efficiently : the blocking part only swaps two pointers.
@CODE:class Mutex
{
public:
    Mutex() : lockCounter(0) { }

    void lock()
    {
        if(lockCounter.fetch_add(1, std::memory_order_acquire)>0)
        {
            std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(internalMutex);
            cv.wait(lock);

@TITLE:Auto Layout and Hide bottom bar when pushed
@CONTENT:My app's (simplified) structure is this: UITabBarController with one UINavigationController holding a UITableViewController as root view controller. when tapping one of the table view controller cells, I push a regular UIViewController (lets call it VC) end hiding the bottom tab bar. (using the "Hide bottom bar when pushed" flag) In storyboard I added a regular UIView subclass to VC that look like a bottom bar, and I use Auto Layout to pin it to the bottom of the VC view. The problem when I push VC it takes a second for this view to pin to the bottom, it looks like auto layout pin it to the bottom as if the tab bar is not hidden and after a sec it recognise that the tab bar is hidden and moves it to the real bottom of the view. I know its not the best explanation, so I added a very simple project to demonstrate the issue.

@TITLE:What is the best way to program a delay in Delphi?
@CONTENT:A Delphi application that I'm working on must delay for one, or sometimes two, second(s). I want to program this delay using the best practices. In reading entries about Delphi's Sleep() method on stackoverflow, I found these two comments: I live by this maxim: "If you feel the need to use Sleep(), you are doing it wrong." V Nick Hodges Mar 12 '12 at 1:36 @nick Indeed. My equivalent is "There are no problems for which Sleep is the solution." V David Heffernan Mar 12 '12 at 8:04 comments about Sleep() In response to this advice to avoid calling Sleep(), along with my understanding about using Delphi's TTimer and TEvent classes, I have programmed the following prototype.

Later in the article it says "props (short for properties) are a Component's configuration, its options if you may. They are received from above and immutable". So props can change but they should be immutable? When should you use props and when should you use state? If you have data that a React component needs, should it be passed through props or setup in the React component via getInitialState?

@TITLE:How to make a ggplot2 contour plot analogue to lattice:filled.contour()?
@CONTENT:I've been learning ggplot2, and hope to use it for all my R graphing. However, I've yet to find a way to make a contour plot that looks analogous to a conventional contour plot, like what can be obtained using lattice:filled.contour(). For example: #define data
x<-seq(1,11,1)
y<-seq(1,11,1)
xyz.func<-function(x,y) {-10.4+6.53*x+6.53*y-0.167*x^2-0.167*y^2+0.0500*x*y}

#contour plot using lattice graphics and R Color Brewer
library(lattice) #for filled.contour()
library(RColorBrewer) #for brewer.pal()
z.lattice<-outer(x,y,xyz.func)
filled.contour(x,y,z.lattice,nlevels=6,col=brewer.pal(6,"YlOrRd"))
 This gives me a nice contour plot. Now, let's try the same thing in ggplot2. The best I can come up with, based on everything I've read (particularly Drawing labels on flat section of contour lines in ggplot2) is: #contour plot using ggplot2
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape2) #for melt()
z.molten<-melt(z.lattice) 
names(z.molten) <- c("x", "y", "z")
v<-ggplot(z.molten, aes(x,y,z=z))+
    geom_tile(aes(fill=z))+
    stat_contour(bins=6,aes(x,y,z=z), color="black", size=0.6)+
    scale_fill_gradientn(colours=brewer.pal(6,"YlOrRd"))
v
 This graph has the same basic idea as filled.contour(), but the colored tiles don't conform to the contours very well. I haven't been successful with changing the sizes of the tiles, either. Any suggestions on how to make ggplot2's output closer to filled.contour()'s output?

@TITLE:Android Studio - Unmappable character for encoding UTF-8
@CONTENT:All was working fine and dandy with Eclipse in Windows until I switched to Mac OS X Yosemite, using Android Studio V1.0. I imported the project as a Non-Android Studio project since it was created with Eclipse, the import went fine and then Android Studio started showing this error all over the files : error : unmappable character for encoding UTF-8
 EDIT: Opening files directly into Sublime Text show no errors in foreign characters. Using view.encoding() inside ST's console I was able to see the file encoding, which was Western (Windows 1252). I went to Android Studio and changed the encoding of the file to windows-1252 and it's now working fine ! Is there a way to tell Android Studio to read the files in windows-1252 and then convert them to UTF-8 to keep the standard encoding format ?

@TITLE:Implementation of java.util.Random.nextInt
@CONTENT:This function is from java.util.Random. It returns a pseudorandom int uniformly distributed between 0 and the given n. Unfortunately I did not get it. public int nextInt(int n) {
    if (n <= 0)
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("n must be positive");

    if ((n & -n) == n)  // i.e., n is a power of 2
        return (int)((n * (long)next(31)) >> 31);

    int bits, val;
    do {
        bits = next(31);
        val = bits % n;
    } while (bits - val + (n-1) < 0);
    return val;
}
 My questions are: Why does it treat the case where n is a power of two specially ? Is it just for performance ? Why doest it reject numbers that bits - val + (n-1) < 0 ?
@CODE:java.util.Random int 0 n public int nextInt(int n) {

        return (int)((n * (long)next(31)) >> 31);

@CONTENT:Using SwiftyJSON how would I parse the following JSON array into a Swift [String]? {
    "array": ["one", "two", "three"]
}
 I have tried this code, but it doesn't work for me: for (index: String, obj: JSON) in json["array"] {
        println(obj.stringValue)
    }
 What would be the best way to handle this? Thank you.

@LINK:/questions/26987994/switch-crashes-when-clicked-on-android-5-0
@TITLE:Switch crashes when clicked on Android 5.0
@CONTENT:When clicking on a switch in my app in Android 5.0 the app crashes with the logcat shown below. The logcat doesn't reference my code anywhere in it, and this switch has worked fine on all previous versions. The switch appears invisible except for the background color and only crashes once clicked on. After testing, the same thing happens whether I define a setOnCheckedChangeListener function or not. Even if the switch is in the layout but never in the code it will still crash when clicked on. One of the switches in question: <Switch
    android:layout_width="90dp"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:textOff="Airborn"
    android:textOn="Direct Contact"
    android:textAppearance="?android:attr/textAppearanceMedium"
    android:id="@+id/switchWind"/>
 And here's how I reference it. // Doesn't actually matter since same thing happens without this
Switch sWind = (Switch) findViewById(R.id.switchWind);
sWind.setOnCheckedChangeListener(new CompoundButton.OnCheckedChangeListener() {
    public void onCheckedChanged(CompoundButton v, boolean isChecked) {
        // Won't reach here
    }
});

@LINK:/questions/26977431/object-equals-whats-the-basic-logic-for-pure-objects-or-reference-types-that-d
@TITLE:Object Equals - whats the basic logic for pure objects or reference types that don't override Equals?
@CONTENT:I got here after reading this and I didn't find a relevant answer - So please don't mark this as a duplicate until you read the whole question. I've been using a reflector and looked into Object.Equals.What I saw is: [__DynamicallyInvokable, TargetedPatchingOptOut("Performance critical to inline across NGen image boundaries")]
public virtual bool Equals(object obj)
{
    return RuntimeHelpers.Equals(this, obj);
}
 And RuntimeHelpers.Equals looks like this: // System.Runtime.CompilerServices.RuntimeHelpers
/// <summary>Determines whether the specified <see cref="T:System.Object" /> instances are considered equal.</summary>
/// <returns>true if the <paramref name="o1" /> parameter is the same instance as the <paramref name="o2" /> parameter, or if both are null, or if o1.Equals(o2) returns true; otherwise, false.</returns>
/// <param name="o1">The first object to compare. </param>
/// <param name="o2">The second object to compare. </param>
[SecuritySafeCritical]
[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.InternalCall)]
public new static extern bool Equals(object o1, object o2);
 Now I can't see the implementation of RuntimeHelpers.Equals but by the description, if both objects aren't the same instance and aren't null it will call the object.Equals method again and I'd get into a loop (I'm talking about pure objects). When I say pure objects I mean something like this: object pureObj1 = new object();
object pureObj2 = new object();
bool areEql = pureObj1.Equals(pureObj2);
 By documentation this should call Object.Equals and get a recusive stackoverflow. I guess maybe the documentation is wrong and this checks reference equality for basic objects - but I wanted to be sure. Bottom line: When comparing two pure objects(e.g. not casting a string into on object) via an Equals call - how does it determine if they are equal? - What happens if I don't override the Equals method and I call Equals on two objects? P.s. is there anyway that I can see the RuntimeHelpers.Equals source code?
@CODE:Object.Equals [__DynamicallyInvokable, TargetedPatchingOptOut("Performance critical to inline across NGen image boundaries")]

{
    return RuntimeHelpers.Equals(this, obj);

 I know how to do this in PHP, but alas, swift isn't PHP :-) Any tips on how I can achieve this in swift would be fantastic! Thank you in advance!

@TITLE:EXC_BAD_ACCESS when updating Swift dictionary after using it for evaluate NSExpression
@CONTENT:I'm using a dictionary to evaluate an expression, when the expression has variables and the dictionary is actually used by NSExpression, something happens and I get EXC_BAD_ACCESS when trying to update the dictionary, this only happens when debugging in an iPhone6, not in the simulator and not in an iPhone 4S.     let strExpression = "a+b+20"
    let exp = NSExpression(format:strExpression)
    self.dictionary = ["a":10.0, "b":15.0, "c":25.0]

    let doubleValue = value as Double
    self.dictionary.updateValue(doubleValue, forKey: "c")    
 Something really weird is that if i add this line just after creating the dictionary, then it woks fine: let newDic = self.dictionary    
 I,m using iOS 8.1. Thanks in advance!

@TITLE:Problems with ngChange for <select> after 1.3.0 rc0
@CONTENT:I have been using a beta version of 1.3 and now after moving to 1.3.1 I notice a problem which by checking all earlier versions I see it appears to have started in 1.3.0 rc1. I have code like this: <select ng-model="home.modal.topicId"
        ng-change="ctrl.modalTopicChanged()"
        ng-options="item.id as item.name for item in home.modal.option.topics.data"
        ng-required="true">
        <option style="display: none;" value="">Select Topic</option>
</select>
 Prior to rc1 the ng-change was not being fired when the form was first displayed. Now it is being fired with a home.modal.topicId of undefined. This is a breaking change for me but it's not mentioned in the breaking change section and I wonder if it's a bug that has yet to be noticed. Here is the stack trace produced: TypeError: Cannot read property 'dataMap' of undefined

 What I notice here is a new function: writeToModelIfNeeded When I look at the change log differences I cannot find any mention of this function being introduced when I check all the changes and the line numbers. I would like to get some advice on this. Firstly is it possible to find the change that caused the addition of the writeToModelIfNeeded then secondly is this the correct functionality for the select box. I thought the whole idea was that the ng-change would only fire if the model value was defined. For reference here's the area of new code that seems to have been added with 1.3.0 rc.1 **

@TITLE:Closed type families and strange function types
@CONTENT:Sorry, I couldn't imagine any better title for the question, so please read ahead. Imagine that we have a closed type family that maps every type to it's corresponding Maybe except maybes themselves: type family Family x where
  Family (Maybe x) = Maybe x
  Family x = Maybe x
 We can even declare a function using that type family: doMagic :: a -> Family a
doMagic = undefined

exampleA = doMagic $ Just ()
exampleB = doMagic $ ()
 Playing with it in GHCi shows that it is ok to evaluate the type of this function application: *Strange> :t exampleA      
exampleA :: Maybe ()       
*Strange> :t exampleB      
exampleB :: Maybe ()       
 The question is if it is possible to provide any implementation of the doMagic function except undefined? Let's for example say that I would like to wrap every value into a Just constructor, except Maybes which should remain intact, how could I do that? I tried using typeclasses, but failed to write a compileable signature for doMagic function if not using closed type families, could somebody please help me?
@CODE:Maybe type family Family x where
  Family (Maybe x) = Maybe x
  Family x = Maybe x doMagic :: a -> Family a
doMagic = undefined

exampleA = doMagic $ Just ()
exampleB = doMagic $ () *Strange> :t exampleA      
exampleA :: Maybe ()       
*Strange> :t exampleB      
exampleB :: Maybe () doMagic undefined Just doMagic x = Just undefined a

@TITLE:CA2213 code analysis rule and auto-implemented properties
@CONTENT:I use static code analysis in our projects to check for code violations. One of extensively used rules is CA2213, which checks for correct disposing of disposable fields. I noticed CA2213 does not check disposing of auto implemented properties. Furthermore CA2213 does not check disposing of neither fields nor auto implemented properties if the class inherits from class which implements IDisposable and does not override the Dispose method. Practical example: public sealed class Good : IDisposable {
    private Font font;
    public Font Font {
        get { return font; }
        set { font = value; }
    }
    public Good() { font = new Font("Arial", 9); }
    public void Dispose() { /* Do nothing */ }       // CA2213
}

public sealed class Bad : IDisposable {
    public Font Font { get; set; }
    public Bad() { Font = new Font("Arial", 9); }
    public void Dispose() { /* Do nothing */ }       // No warning
}
 Has anyone else encountered this behavior? Is this by design or bug in CA2213 rule?
@CODE:public sealed class Good : IDisposable {
    private Font font;
    public Font Font {
        get { return font; }
        set { font = value; }
    }
    public Good() { font = new Font("Arial", 9); }
    public void Dispose() { /* Do nothing */ }       // CA2213
}

public sealed class Bad : IDisposable {
    public Font Font { get; set; }
    public Bad() { Font = new Font("Arial", 9); }
    public void Dispose() { /* Do nothing */ }       // No warning

@CONTENT:I'm trying to style the SearchView widget using the new AppCompat v21, but I'm facing some problems. No matter what layout I set on "suggestionRowLayout" attribute, it does nothing at all. The suggestion dropdown list of the SearchView remains the same way. Other problem that I'm having is when the "accent color" is the same color as the "primary color", in the searchview is impossible to distinguish where is the caret. Do you know how can I change the accent color in the SearchView to only be applied there? I've found that Play Music has the same problem.

 My auth server and resource / web api projects are in different solutions and are running on different ports (...not sure if that matters but thought Id mention it). At this point these 2 projects are making use of oAuth OWIN middleware (and has very little custom code). The middleware is blackbox somewhat and just need some assistance in figuring out why I am receiving this error message. Also note that the I am running both servers in two Visual Studio 2013 Web application projects that are in different VS 2013 solutions that are running on different ports. I am not sure if that matters but thought I would mention it. Thanks in advance.

@TITLE:Any-Any size class ignored for ios7
@CONTENT:I'm developing for both iOS7 and 8 iPhone. Since iOS7 doesn't support compact-height size classes, I thought the consensus way to go about this was to use the any-any size class for landscape iPhone layouts, and use portrait compact-width regular-height (cWrH) size class for portrait iPhone layouts. I set a constraint on a view in any-any, then modify a constraint constant in cWrH to be specific to that size class. However, iOS7 device as well as Xcode preview ignores the any-any constraint, and uses the cWrH constraint for both portrait and landscape orientations. I have no clue why this is happening. All I want to do is set different constraints depending on orientation. This is easily replicated using latest Xcode 6.0.1. Semi-related: How can Xcode 6 adaptive UIs be backwards-compatible with iOS 7 and iOS 6? Screenshots below:

@TITLE:Google Maps JS API (v3) InfoWindow Script Error - JSON Undefined
@CONTENT:I've been working on quite a nice program for a month or two now. I'm having an odd issue where clicking a marker on my map is giving a very vague script error. Literally just last night everything was working fine and all of a sudden this is happening. First, here's a brief look at my map. As soon as this form (VB) loads, a list of records is pulled from my SQL Server database. A marker with a unique ID is created for each record. An InfoWindow is made for each marker, and the InfoWindow is filled with details from the columns for that record. I seriously had this part working flawlessly. I can click different markers on the map, and have their InfoWindow opened (while closing the previous InfoWindow if one was already open). (Sorry for having to post these as links, I don't have the 10 reputation to post images). Now, all of a sudden when I click on a marker, I get the following script error. If I choose "Yes," another script error is shown. I can't figure out what's going on. If I comment out (effectively disabling) my click event for the marker, there is no script error, but of course the InfoWindows won't work. I did this to see if the script errors come up with the map just idling. I've tried clearing the content of the InfoWindow (leaving just "test" as its content) to rule that out; still get the script errors. I can't tell if this may be something going on on Google's end, I don't know. Is that possible? The URL noted in the first script error indicates that it's a problem in that script, which I think would indicate that this could be on their end? And finally, my .htm. I should clarify that I am doing this in a Visual Basic program. I have a container on my form which I create and place a WebBrowser object into. Then I have the WebBrowser load this .htm page. This worked amazingly as of just a night or two ago and I can't figure out the problem. I've even opened a backup from two weeks ago and this isn't working. <!DOCTYPE html>

@TITLE:RSA: encrypt in iOS, decrypt in Java
@CONTENT:I have a public key that's sent from a Java server. The base64 encoded strings match before I decode and strip out the ASN.1 headers. I store the public key in the keychain with SecItemAdd. So I'm trying to encrypt the data using the public key and decrypt it with the private key in Java. I'm using SecKeyEncrypt on the iOS side and Cipher on the Java side. What I'm encrypting is the symmetric AES key that encrypts my actual data, so the key length is 16 bytes. When simply base64 encoding the key, everything works, so I know something is wrong with this RSA encryption. Here's an example of my iOS call: OSStatus sanityCheck = SecKeyEncrypt(publicKey,
        kSecPaddingPKCS1,
        (const uint8_t *) [incomingData bytes],
        keyBufferSize,
        cipherBuffer,
        &cipherBufferSize
);
 Here's an example of my Java call: public static byte[] decryptMessage (byte[] message, PrivateKey privateKey, String algorithm) {
    if (message == null || privateKey == null) {
        return null;
    }
    Cipher cipher = createCipher(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, privateKey, algorithm, false);
    if (cipher == null) {
        return null;
    }

    try {
        return cipher.doFinal(message);
    }
    catch (IllegalBlockSizeException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();  //To change body of catch statement use File | Settings | File Templates.
        return null;
    }
    catch (BadPaddingException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();  //To change body of catch statement use File | Settings | File Templates.
        return null;
    }
}

private static Cipher createCipher (int mode, Key encryptionKey, String algorithm, boolean useBouncyCastle) {
    Cipher cipher;

    try {
        if (useBouncyCastle) {
            Security.addProvider(new org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider());
            cipher = Cipher.getInstance(algorithm, "BC");
        }
        else {
            cipher = Cipher.getInstance(algorithm);
        }
    }
    catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();  //To change body of catch statement use File | Settings | File Templates.
        return null;
    }
    catch (NoSuchPaddingException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();  //To change body of catch statement use File | Settings | File Templates.
        return null;
    }
    catch (NoSuchProviderException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
        return null;
    }

    try {
        cipher.init(mode, encryptionKey);
    }
    catch (InvalidKeyException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();  //To change body of catch statement use File | Settings | File Templates.
        return null;
    }

    return cipher;
}
 I've tried so many combinations and nothing has worked. iOS: PKCS1, Java: RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding iOS: PKCS1, Java: RSA iOS: PKCS1, Java: RSA/None/PKCS1Padding (throws org.bouncycastle.crypto.DataLengthException: input too large for RSA cipher.) iOS: OAEP, Java: RSA/ECB/OAEPWithSHA-1AndMGF1Padding iOS: OAEP, Java: RSA/ECB/OAEPWithSHA-256AndMGF1Padding I've also tried using the internal Java provider as well as the BouncyCastle provider. The javax.crypto.BadPaddingException gets thrown every time, but the message is different for each combination. Some show Data must start with zero, while others are Message is larger than modulus. The iOS: PKCS1, Java: RSA doesn't throw an exception, but the resulting decrypted byte[] array should be length 16, but it's length 256, which means the padding isn't correctly stripped out. Can someone help? *** EDIT *** As I'm doing more testing, I came across this page (http://javadoc.iaik.tugraz.at/iaik_jce/current/iaik/pkcs/pkcs1/RSACipher.html), which essentially tells me that RSA == RSA/None/PKCS1Padding. The decryption works in the sense that there are no exceptions, but I'm still getting a decrypted key whose byte[] is length 256 instead of length 16. Another point of interest. It seems that if the Java server has the public key generated from the iOS device and encrypted using Cipher.getInstance("RSA"), the phone is able to decode the message correctly with RSA/PKCS1. *** EDIT 2 *** I have looked at these tutorials and looked through my code again on the iOS side: http://blog.flirble.org/2011/01/05/rsa-public-key-openssl-ios/ http://blog.wingsofhermes.org/?p=42 http://blog.wingsofhermes.org/?p=75 As far as I can tell, my code is doing everything correctly. One significant difference was in how I was saving the key, so I tried saving it the other way:     OSStatus error = noErr;
    CFTypeRef persistPeer = NULL;

    NSMutableDictionary * keyAttr = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init];

    keyAttr[(__bridge id) kSecClass] = (__bridge id) kSecClassKey;
    keyAttr[(__bridge id) kSecAttrKeyType] = (__bridge id) kSecAttrKeyTypeRSA;
    keyAttr[(__bridge id) kSecAttrApplicationTag] = [secKeyWrapper getKeyTag:serverPublicKeyTag];
    keyAttr[(__bridge id) kSecValueData] = strippedServerPublicKey;
    keyAttr[(__bridge id) kSecReturnPersistentRef] = @YES;

    error = SecItemAdd((__bridge CFDictionaryRef) keyAttr, (CFTypeRef *)&persistPeer);

    if (persistPeer == nil || ( error != noErr && error != errSecDuplicateItem)) {
        NSLog(@"Problem adding public key to keychain");
        return;
    }

    CFRelease(persistPeer);
 That save was successful, but the end result was the same: the decrypted AES key was still 256 bytes long instead of 16 bytes.

@TITLE:Entity Framework 6 and Unit Of WorkK Where, When? Is it like transactions in ado.net?
@CONTENT:Creating a new MVC project and like the idea of repositories in the data layer, so i have implemented them. I have also created a Service layer to handle all business logic and validation, this layer in turn uses the appropriate repository. Something like this (I am using Simple Injector to inject) DAL LAYER public MyRepository() {

    private DbContext _context;
    public MyRepository(DbContext context) {
        _context = context;
    }    

    public MyEntity Get(int id)
    {
        return _context.Set<MyEntity>().Find(id);
    }

    public TEntity Add(MyEntity t)
    {
        _context.Set<MyEntity>().Add(t);
        _context.SaveChanges();
        return t;
    }

    public TEntity Update(MyEntity updated, int key)
    {
        if (updated == null)
            return null;

        MyEntity existing = _context.Set<MyEntity>().Find(key);
        if (existing != null)
        {
            _context.Entry(existing).CurrentValues.SetValues(updated);
            _context.SaveChanges();
        }
        return existing;
    }

    public void Delete(MyEntity t)
    {
        _context.Set<MyEntity>().Remove(t);
        _context.SaveChanges();
    }
}
 SERVICE LAYER public MyService() {
    private MyRepository _repository;

    public MyService(MyRepository repository) {
        _repository = repository;    
    }

    public MyEntity Get(int id)
    {
        return _repository.Get(id);
    }

    public MyEntity Add(MyEntity t)
    {
        _repository.Add(t);

        return t;
    }

    public MyEntity Update(MyEntity updated)
    {
        return _repository.Update(updated, updated.Id);
    }

    public void Delete(MyEntity t)
    {
        _repository.Delete(t);
    }
}
 Now this is very simple, so i can use the following code to update an object. MyEntity entity = MyService.Get(123);
MyEntity.Name = "HELLO WORLD";
entity = MyService.Update(entity);
 Or this to create an object MyEntity entity = new MyEntity();
MyEntity.Name = "HELLO WORLD";
entity = MyService.Add(entity);
// entity.Id is now populated
 Now say i needed to update an item based on the creation Id of another, i could use the code above all fine, but what happens if an error occurs? I need some sort of transaction/rollback. Is this what the Unit Of Work pattern is suppose to solve? So i guess i need to have DbContext in my UnitOfWork object, so i create an object like so? public UnitOfWork() : IDisposable {

    private DbContext _context;

    public UnitOfWork(DbContext context) {
        _context = context;
    }

    public Commit() {
        _context.SaveChanges();
    }

    public Dispose() {
        _context.Dispose();
    }

}
 Ok so again, thats quite simple. UnitOfWork holds the context as well ( i use same context on all repositories anyway) and it calls the SaveChanges() method. I would then remove the SaveChanges() method call from my repository. So to add i would do the following: UnitOfWork uow = new UnitOfWork(new DbContext()); // i would inject this somehow

MyEntity entity = new MyEntity();
MyEntity.Name = "HELLO WORLD";
entity = MyService.Add(entity);

uow.Commit();
 But what if i need to create an object and then update other objects based on that Id, this will now not work, because the Id will not be created until i call Commit on the uow. Example UnitOfWork uow = new UnitOfWork(new DbContext()); // i would inject this somehow

MyEntity entity = new MyEntity();
MyEntity.Name = "HELLO WORLD";
entity = MyService.Add(entity);
// entity.Id is NOT populated

MyEntity otherEntity = MyService.Get(123);
otherEntity.OtherProperty = entity.Id;
MyService.Update(otherEntity);

uow.Commit();  // otherEntity.OtherProperty is not linked.....?
 So i have a feeling that this UnitOfWork class is not right... maybe i am miss understanding something. I need to be able to add an entity and get that Id and use it on another entity, but if an error occurs, i want to "rollback" like an ado.net transaction would do. Is this functionality possible using Entity Framework and Repositories?

@CONTENT:We have a osx server configured with SSL cert and enabled Xcode. Everything worked fine before updating OSX Server to 3.2.1 and Xcode 6.0.1. The problem we have is that when the integration is finished, and we click on the install button on the device, it tries to download but fails silently. The device logs prints: Sep 22 13:32:29 somePhone itunesstored[84] : Could not load download manifest with underlying error: Error Domain=NSURLErrorDomain Code=-1001 "Cannot connect to buildserver.com" UserInfo=0x14f74dfe0 {NSUnderlyingError=0x14f6e8330 "The request timed out.", NSErrorFailingURLStringKey=https://buildserver.com:20343/api/integrations/fc9e3c6ed7d80506e9e8e37b0d06a905/87785234-f589-4230-9c0c-055f656b28a6/install_manifest.plist, NSErrorFailingURLKey=https://buildserver.com:20343/api/integrations/fc9e3c6ed7d80506e9e8e37b0d06a905/87785234-f589-4230-9c0c-055f656b28a6/install_manifest.plist, _kCFStreamErrorDomainKey=1, _kCFStreamErrorCodeKey=60, NSLocalizedDescription=Cannot connect to buildserver.com} When I check the port 20343 the valid ssl cert from OSX Server is switched out with a cert signed by: Xcode Server Root Certificate Authority, it seem to be selfsigned.

@TITLE:Android consumable: already own that item but inventory.hasPurchase() is false
@CONTENT:I'm stuck with Google In App v3 - I tested a purchase without consumption (e.g. when app crashes between buying and consuming) - now I don't find a way out. If I try to buy again, it says 'you already own that item'. But when I test for ownership, it says I don't own it: Inventory inv = mHelper.queryInventory(false, null);
inv.getPurchase(sku); // null
inv.hasPurchase(sku); // false
 I can't consume something either, as I don't have a purchase to consume. How to proceed here? EDIT Reproduce it like the following: purchase in-app consumable, then disable internet connection. After that, you're not able to purchase the product again for some hours. Just tested with a popular app from the play store (Diamond Digger Saga), I had the exact same behaviour. Is there really no possibility to avoid/solve this?

@TITLE:React and jQuery event handler's fired in wrong order
@CONTENT:I'm creating menu that appears at the top of the screen. When user clicks one of menu items div with a lot of links appear. I wan't to be able to hide this div by clicking another menu item (no problem, already implemented it) but also by clicking anywhere else then this div and menuitems. I heard about two solutions: Show invisible div that is behind the menu and covers whole screen and add click handler to it. Attach event handler to document.body. First one is not good for me because that div will cover links that are on the page and I want them to be clickable even after menuitem is clicked and it's corresponding div appeared. So I tried second soultion. But the problem is that jquery click handler on body is fired before my component's handler. I have no idea how to make it first call my components handler and then prevent event propagation. Here is the code and js fiddle: /** @jsx React.DOM */
var Menu = React.createClass({
    click: function(e) {
        console.log('component handled click - should be called before jquery one and prevent jquery handler from running at all');
        e.stopPropagation();
    },
    render: function(){
    console.log("component renders");
        return (
            <div>

                </div>
            </div>
        );
    }
});

React.renderComponent(<Menu />, document.getElementById("menu"));

$(document).ready(function() {

The Extension's Bundle Identifier must be prefixed with the Parent App's Bundle Identifier, or a warning is thrown: error: Embedded binary's bundle identifier is not prefixed with the parent app's bundle identifier.

When adding a new screenshot, at first, I was receiving the error: Your app information could not be saved. Try again. If the problem persists, contact us. Inspecting the element in browser, in the console i could see that they got a server error: We've got a server error... 500 But yesterday, the error changed. The server was responding SUCCESS, but a new error appeared when trying to upload any screenshot: Failed to create a screenshot for Screenshots for 4-inch iPhone 5 and iPod touch (5th generation) Retina display (error for 4-inch upload) I'm sure my image types/sizes are ok. Today, I'm back to the server error... Apple responded my thread with them today, but to ask for additional information such as screenshots and the source code of the page. Anyone else having this issue? Anyone got the answers from Apple? Thx SS of inspecting element in Safari:

@TITLE:Update Core Data store location to support App Groups
@CONTENT:I have an app already in the App Store that uses core data to save data. Now, when iOS 8 is about to come out I wanna add a widget to it, thus I must use App Groups to share data between the binaries. One problem though - I need to change the store location to support App Groups to all the existing users. I wrote the following code, trying to move the store to the new path: // Returns the persistent store coordinator for the application.
// If the coordinator doesn't already exist, it is created and the application's store added to it.
- (NSPersistentStoreCoordinator *)persistentStoreCoordinator
{
    if (_persistentStoreCoordinator != nil) {
        return _persistentStoreCoordinator;
    }

    NSURL *oldStoreURL = [[[NSFileManager defaultManager] URLsForDirectory:NSDocumentDirectory inDomains:NSUserDomainMask] lastObject];
    oldStoreURL = [oldStoreURL URLByAppendingPathComponent:@"Schooler.sqlite"];


    NSURL *storeURL = [[NSFileManager defaultManager] containerURLForSecurityApplicationGroupIdentifier:@"group.com.schooler.mycontainer"];
    storeURL = [storeURL URLByAppendingPathComponent:@"Schooler.sqlite"];


    if([[NSFileManager defaultManager] fileExistsAtPath:oldStoreURL.path] == YES && [[NSFileManager defaultManager] fileExistsAtPath:storeURL.path] == NO)
    {
        // Prior today extension - Need to move to new directory
        NSError *error = nil;
        if([[NSFileManager defaultManager] moveItemAtURL:oldStoreURL toURL:storeURL error:&error] == YES)
            NSLog(@"Migrated successfully to new database location.");
        else
            NSLog(@"error: %@",error);
    }

    NSDictionary *options = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:
                             [NSNumber numberWithBool:YES], NSMigratePersistentStoresAutomaticallyOption,
                             [NSNumber numberWithBool:YES], NSInferMappingModelAutomaticallyOption, nil];

    NSError *error = nil;
    _persistentStoreCoordinator = [[NSPersistentStoreCoordinator alloc] initWithManagedObjectModel:[self managedObjectModel]];
    if (![_persistentStoreCoordinator addPersistentStoreWithType:NSSQLiteStoreType configuration:nil URL:storeURL options:options error:&error]) {
        NSLog(@"Unresolved error %@, %@", error, [error userInfo]);
    }

    return _persistentStoreCoordinator;
}
 The output is always "Migrated successfully to new database location.", although all the data that was saved on the app before has been deleted, As if it created a new database instead of just moving it. What causes the problem? How should I fix it? Thank you.

@TITLE:How does module loading work in CPython?
@CONTENT:How does module loading work in CPython under the hood? Especially, how does the dynamic loading of extensions written in C work? Where can I learn about this? I find the source code itself rather overwhelming. I can see that trusty ol' dlopen() and friends is used on systems that support it but without any sense of the bigger picture it would take a long time to figure this out from the source code. An enormous amount could be written on this topic but as far as I can tell, almost nothing has been X the abundance of webpages describing the Python language itself makes this difficult to search for. A great answer would provide a reasonably brief overview and references to resources where I can learn more. I'm mostly concerned with how this works on Unix-like systems simply because that's what I know but I am interested in if the process is similar elsewhere. To be more specific (but also risk assuming too much), how does CPython use the module methods table and initialization function to "make sense" of dynamically loaded C?

@LINK:/questions/25587403/boost-asio-ssl-async-shutdown-always-finishes-with-an-error
@TITLE:boost asio ssl async_shutdown always finishes with an error?
@CONTENT:I have a small ssl client that I've programmed in boost 1.55 asio, and I'm trying to figure out why boost::asio::ssl::stream::async_shutdown() always fails. The client is very similar (almost identical) to the ssl client examples in the boost documentation, in that it goes through an boost::asio::ip::tcp::resolver::async_resolve() -> boost::asio::ssl::stream::async_connect() -> boost::asio::ssl::stream::async_handshake() callback sequence. All of this works as expected and the async_handshake() callback gets an all-clear boost::system::error_code. From the async_handshake() callback, I call async_shutdown() (I don't transfer any data - this object is more for testing the handshake): void ClientCertificateFinder::handle_handshake(const boost::system::error_code& e)
{
    if ( !e )
    {
        m_socket.async_shutdown( boost::bind( &ClientCertificateFinder::handle_shutdown_after_success, 
            this, 
            boost::asio::placeholders::error ) );
    }
    else
    {
        m_handler( e, IssuerNameList() );
    }
}
 handle_shutdown_after_success() is then called, but always with an error? The error is value=2 in asio.misc, which is 'End of file'. I've tried this with a variety of ssl servers, and I always seem to get this asio.misc error. That this isn't an underlying openssl error suggests to me that I might be misusing asio in some way...? Anyone know why this might be happening? I was under the impression that shutting down the connection with async_shutdown() was The Right Thing To Do, but I guess I could just call boost::asio::ssl::stream.lowestlayer().close() to close the socket out from under openssl if that's the expected way to do this (and indeed the asio ssl examples seem to indicate that this is the right way of shutting down).

@TITLE:Template method to select between functions based on accessibility of constructor
@CONTENT:I am writing a class ptr_scope_manager to manage the creation and destruction of pointers in a given scope. I have studied the answers from this question: Private constructor inhibits use of emplace[_back]() to avoid a move And it appears that if I want to manage the creation of an object whose class has a private constructor, my internal std::vector can use push_back but not emplace_back to construct the object. This is because emplace_back uses an internal class to construct the object. That means friending the ptr_scope_manager is not sufficient to allow it to create objects with private constructors. So what I have done is make two create methods, one for objects with public constructors and one for objects with private constructors that have friended the ptr_scope_manager. template<typename Type>
class ptr_scope_manager
{
private:
    std::vector<Type> ptrs;

public:
    template<typename... Args>
    Type* create_private(Args... args)
    {
        ptrs.push_back(Type(args...));
        return &ptrs.back();
    }

    template<typename... Args>
    Type* create_public(Args... args)
    {
        ptrs.emplace_back(args...);
        return &ptrs.back();
    }
};

class public_ctor
{
    int i;
public:
    public_ctor(int i): i(i) {} // public
};

class private_ctor
{
    friend class ptr_scope_manager<private_ctor>;
    int i;
private:
    private_ctor(int i): i(i) {} // private
};

int main()
{
    ptr_scope_manager<public_ctor> public_manager;
    ptr_scope_manager<private_ctor> private_manager;

    public_manager.create_public(3);
    public_manager.create_private(3);

//  private_manager.create_public(3); // compile error
    private_manager.create_private(3);
}
 My question is this: Is there any way I can use SFINAE (or otherwise?) to automatically select between create_public() and create_private() based on whether or not the template Type parameter has a public or private constructor? Perhaps utilizing std::is_constructible? It would be nice to have only one create() method that auto-selects the more efficient create_public() method where possible and falling back on the slightly less efficient create_private when necessary.

@LINK:/questions/25282543/mapping-physical-360-rotation-to-scenekit
@TITLE:Mapping physical 360 rotation to SceneKit
@CONTENT:I am having a hard time mapping device motion (sensor fusion) to SceneKit node rotation. The premise of the problem is as follows, I have sphere, and the camera is positioned to be inside the the sphere such that the geometric center of sphere and camera node's center coincide. What i want to achieve is when i rotate physically around a point, the motion needs to be mapped accurately on the camera as well. The implementaion details are as follows: I have a node, with a sphere as geomertry and is a child to root node. I am using sensor fusion to get attitude quternions and then converting them to euler angles. The code for that is: - (SCNVector3)eulerAnglesFromCMQuaternion:(CMQuaternion)q
{
  GLKQuaternion gq1 =  GLKQuaternionMakeWithAngleAndAxis(GLKMathDegreesToRadians(90), 1, 0, 0);
  GLKQuaternion gq2 =  GLKQuaternionMake(q.x, q.y, q.z, q.w);
  GLKQuaternion qp  =  GLKQuaternionMultiply(gq1, gq2);
  CMQuaternion rq =   {.x = qp.x, .y = qp.y, .z = qp.z, .w = qp.w};
  CGFloat roll = atan2(-rq.x*rq.z - rq.w*rq.y, .5 - rq.y*rq.y - rq.z*rq.z);
  CGFloat pitch = asin(-2*(rq.y*rq.z + rq.w*rq.x));
  CGFloat yaw = atan2(rq.x*rq.y - rq.w*rq.z, .5 - rq.x*rq.x - rq.z*rq.z);
  return SCNVector3Make(roll, pitch, yaw);
}
 The conversion equation is from 3D Math Primer for Graphics and Game Development. I have used to book as a reference, haven't read it. But definitely on my reading list. Now to simulate the physical rotation in SceneKit, am rotating my node containing SCNCamera. This is a child to rootNode. And am using .rotation property to do the same. One thing to note here is that Now my device motion update thread looks something like this  [self.motionManager startDeviceMotionUpdatesUsingReferenceFrame:CMAttitudeReferenceFrameXArbitraryCorrectedZVertical toQueue:mq withHandler:^(CMDeviceMotion *motion, NSError *error) {
    CMAttitude *currentAttitude = motion.attitude;
    [SCNTransaction begin];
    [SCNTransaction setDisableActions:YES];
    SCNVector3 v = [self eulerAnglesFromCMQuaternion:currentAttitude.quaternion];
    self.cameraNode.eulerAngles = SCNVector3Make( v.y, -v.x, 0); //SCNVector3Make(roll, yaw, pitch)
    [SCNTransaction commit];
  }];
 Something of caution here is the euler angles are different for device and for SceneKit node. The links explain them. SceneKit Euler Angles CMAttitude Euler Angles And in my understanding the mapping between two goes something like this. Now the problem I am facing is, the camera's 360 degree rotation is over before my physical rotation about a point is. Which am trying to dpecit via the following image. I doubt the quaternion -> euler angle conversion is causing the error, and quaternion math is way over my head as of now. I hope i have provided all the information, if anything more is required am only glad to add.
@CODE:- (SCNVector3)eulerAnglesFromCMQuaternion:(CMQuaternion)q
{
  GLKQuaternion gq1 =  GLKQuaternionMakeWithAngleAndAxis(GLKMathDegreesToRadians(90), 1, 0, 0);
  GLKQuaternion gq2 =  GLKQuaternionMake(q.x, q.y, q.z, q.w);
  GLKQuaternion qp  =  GLKQuaternionMultiply(gq1, gq2);
  CMQuaternion rq =   {.x = qp.x, .y = qp.y, .z = qp.z, .w = qp.w};
  CGFloat roll = atan2(-rq.x*rq.z - rq.w*rq.y, .5 - rq.y*rq.y - rq.z*rq.z);
  CGFloat pitch = asin(-2*(rq.y*rq.z + rq.w*rq.x));
  CGFloat yaw = atan2(rq.x*rq.y - rq.w*rq.z, .5 - rq.x*rq.x - rq.z*rq.z);
  return SCNVector3Make(roll, pitch, yaw);

@CONTENT:Currently I've been stuck on an issue trying to retrieve the submodules of a repository from within Jenkins. My configuration is fine and I can pull repositories without any submodules just fine. I can also pull the main components of a repo with submodules (both with authentication in the repository-name as with SSH). The problem only arises when I have to pull the submodule-components. I'm running the latest version of Jenkins and I've added a part at the bottom which is for "Advanced sub-modules behaviours".

When I try adding an extra build step at the bottom with shell-commands, the updating of the repositories doesn't work either. When I try these commands outside of jenkins in my terminal, this works just fine. The issue I always get in Jenkins is: FATAL: Command "git submodule update" returned status code 1:

@TITLE:R: Rolling window function with adjustable window and step-size for irregularly spaced observations
@CONTENT:Say there is a 2-column data frame with a time or distance column which sequentially increases and an observation column which may have NAs here and there. How can I efficiently use a sliding window function to get some statistic, say a mean, for the observations in a window of duration X (e.g. 5 seconds), slide the window over Y seconds (e.g. 2.5 seconds), repeat... The number of observations in the window is based on the time column, thus both the number of observations per window and the number of observations to slide the window may vary The function should accept any window size up to the number of observations and a step size. Here is sample data (see "Edit:" for a larger sample set) set.seed(42)
dat <- data.frame(time = seq(1:20)+runif(20,0,1))
dat <- data.frame(dat, measure=c(diff(dat$time),NA_real_))
dat$measure[sample(1:19,2)] <- NA_real_

 Desired Output for the specific case of a 5 second window, 2.5 second step, first window from -2.5 to 2.5, na.rm=FALSE:  [1] 1.0222694

 [7] 1.0518228
 [8]        NA
 [9]        NA
[10]        NA
 Explanation: In the desired output the very first window looks for times between -2.5 and 2.5. One observation of measure is in this window, and it is not an NA, thus we get that observation: 1.0222694. The next window is from 0 to 5, and there is an NA in the window, so we get NA. Same for the window from 2.5 to 7.5. The next window is from 5 to 10. There are 5 observations in the window, none are NA. So, we get the average of those 5 observations (i.e. mean(dat[dat$time >5 & dat$time <10,'measure']) ) What I tried: Here is what I tried for the specific case of a window where the step size is 1/2 the window duration: windo <- 5  # duration in seconds of window

# partition into groups depending on which window(s) an observation falls in
# When step size >= window/2 and < window, need two grouping vectors
leaf1 <- round(ceiling(dat$time/(windo/2))+0.5)
leaf2 <- round(ceiling(dat$time/(windo/2))-0.5) 

l1 <- tapply(dat$measure, leaf1, mean)
l2 <- tapply(dat$measure, leaf2, mean)

as.vector(rbind(l2,l1))
 Not flexible, not elegant, not efficient. If step size isn't 1/2 window size, the approach will not work, as is. Any thoughts on a general solution to this kind of problem? Any solution is acceptable. The faster the better, though I prefer solutions using base R, data.table, Rcpp, and/or parallel computation. In my real data set, there are several millions of observations contained in a list of data frames (max data frame is ~400,000 observations). Below is a extra info: A larger sample set Edit: As per request, here is a larger, more realistic example dataset with many more NAs and the minimum time span (~0.03).

@LINK:/questions/24693950/what-is-copy-move-constructor-choosing-rule-in-c-when-does-move-to-copy-fallb
@TITLE:What is copy/move constructor choosing rule in C++? When does move-to-copy fallback happen?
@CONTENT:The first example: #include <iostream>
#include <memory>
using namespace std;

struct A {
    unique_ptr<int> ref;
    A(const A&) = delete;
    A(A&&) = default;
    A(const int i) : ref(new int(i)) { }
    ~A() = default;
};

int main()
{
    A a[2] = { 0, 1 };
   return 0;
}
 It works perfectly. So here the MOVE constructor is used. Let's remove the move constructor and add a copy one: #include <iostream>
#include <memory>
using namespace std;

struct A {
    unique_ptr<int> ref;
    A(const A&a) 
        : ref( a.ref.get() ? new int(*a.ref) : nullptr )
    {  }
    A(A&&) = delete;
    A(const int i) : ref(new int(i)) { }
    ~A() = default;
};

int main()
{
    A a[2] = { 0, 1 };
   return 0;
}
 Now the compilation falls with the error "use of deleted function A::A(A&&)" So the MOVE constructor is REQUIRED and there is no fall back to a COPY constructor. Now let's remove both copy- and move-constructors: #include <iostream>
#include <memory>
using namespace std;

struct A {
    unique_ptr<int> ref;
    A(const int i) : ref(new int(i)) { }
    ~A() = default;
};

int main()
{
    A a[2] = { 0, 1 };
   return 0;
}
 And it falls with "use of deleted function A::A(const A&)" compilation error. Now it REQUIRES a COPY constructor! So there was a fallback (?) from the move constructor to the copy constructor. Why? Does anyone have any idea how does it conform to the C++ standard and what actually is the rule of choosing among copy/move constructors?
@CODE:#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
using namespace std;

struct A {
    unique_ptr<int> ref;
    A(const A&) = delete;
    A(A&&) = default;
    A(const int i) : ref(new int(i)) { }
    ~A() = default;
};

int main()
{
    A a[2] = { 0, 1 };
   return 0;
} #include <iostream>
#include <memory>
using namespace std;

struct A {
    unique_ptr<int> ref;
    A(const A&a) 
        : ref( a.ref.get() ? new int(*a.ref) : nullptr )
    {  }
    A(A&&) = delete;
    A(const int i) : ref(new int(i)) { }
    ~A() = default;
};

int main()
{
    A a[2] = { 0, 1 };
   return 0;
} #include <iostream>
#include <memory>
using namespace std;

struct A {
    unique_ptr<int> ref;
    A(const int i) : ref(new int(i)) { }
    ~A() = default;
};

int main()
{
    A a[2] = { 0, 1 };
   return 0;

@LINK:/questions/24238373/geolocation-in-c-sharp
@TITLE:Geolocation in C#
@CONTENT:I'm trying to develop an application that should be something like a game. The user would have some locations in a city and he would have to do something on each location. In order to track the position of the user, I have tried using geolocation with the following code: Geolocator geolocator = new Geolocator();
//geolocator.DesiredAccuracy = Windows.Devices.Geolocation.PositionAccuracy.High;
geolocator.DesiredAccuracyInMeters = 50;
try
{
    Geoposition geoposition = await geolocator.GetGeopositionAsync(TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(500), TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1));
    textLatitude.Text = "Latitude: " + geoposition.Coordinate.Latitude.ToString("0.0000000000");
    textLongitude.Text = "Longitude: " + geoposition.Coordinate.Longitude.ToString("0.0000000000");
    textAccuracy.Text = "Accuracy: " + geoposition.Coordinate.Accuracy.ToString("0.0000000000");
}
 Using the following way to get the coordinates I tried to test if the device will locate my position correctly with the following code: if( Math.Abs(geoposition.Coordinate.Latitude - 45.3285) < 0.001 ){
    if (Math.Abs(geoposition.Coordinate.Longitude - 14.4474) < 0.001)
    {
        txt.Text = "KONT";              
    }
}
 The problem is that the accuracy of the location is really small, if I try using more precise coordinates it would never get the same coordinates again, and with this code the accuracy is really bad (it can fail even 300 meters). Has anyone an idea how to get a more reliable location, or another way to fix that?
@CODE:Geolocator geolocator = new Geolocator();
//geolocator.DesiredAccuracy = Windows.Devices.Geolocation.PositionAccuracy.High;
geolocator.DesiredAccuracyInMeters = 50;
try
{

The command looks like this: ./bin/spark-submit --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi --master spark://ec2-54-88-9-74.compute-1.amazonaws.com:7077 --executor-memory 2G --total-executor-cores 1 ./examples/target/scala-2.10/spark-examples_2.10-1.0.0.jar 100 However, I got the following error: ERROR SparkDeploySchedulerBackend: Application has been killed. Reason: All masters are unresponsive! Giving up. Please let me know how to fix it. Thanks.

@TITLE:How to set CMutablePointer<ObjCBool> to false in Swift?
@CONTENT:Basically I'm using the AssetsLibrary frameworks in Swift, how could I modify the value of the stop pointer to NO/False/0 (I don't even know what value it should except) ? self.library.enumerateGroupsWithTypes(ALAssetsGroupType(ALAssetsGroupSavedPhotos), usingBlock: {(group: ALAssetsGroup!, stop: CMutablePointer<ObjCBool>) in

},
failureBlock: {(error: NSError!) in

})
 I should be able to access the value and modify it with unsafePointer but I can't seems to be able to write the closure correctly.

 When running under uwsgi, the background thread does not see the same queue as the app. Why is that? How can I make these two threads look at the same Queue object? Updates I see inconsistent behaviour even when it's executed as a Python script: Sometimes it does not manage to log messages (using app.logger), and I can only see prints. This means that the thread is running, but it can't do anything with app.logger. uwsgi .ini configuration [uwsgi]

@LINK:/questions/23785528/user-iprincipal-not-avaliable-on-apicontrollers-constructor-using-web-api-2-1
@TITLE:User (IPrincipal) not avaliable on ApiController's constructor using Web Api 2.1 and Owin
@CONTENT:I am Using Web Api 2.1 with Asp.Net Identity 2. I am trying to get the authenticated User on my ApiController's constructor (I am using AutoFac to inject my dependencies), but the User shows as not authenticated when the constructor is called. I am trying to get the User so I can generate Audit information for any DB write-operations. A few things I'm doing that can help on the diagnosis: I am using only app.UseOAuthBearerTokens as authentication with Asp.Net Identity 2. This means that I removed the app.UseCookieAuthentication(new CookieAuthenticationOptions()) that comes enabled by default when you are creating a new Web Api 2.1 project with Asp.Net Identity 2. Inside WebApiConfig I'm injecting my repository: builder.RegisterType<ValueRepository>().As<IValueRepository>().InstancePerRequest();
 Here's my controller: [RoutePrefix("api/values")]
public class ValuesController : ApiController
{
    private IValueRepository valueRepository;

    public ValuesController(IValueRepository repo)
    {
        valueRepository = repo;
        // I would need the User information here to pass it to my repository
        // something like this:
        valueRepository.SetUser(User);
    }

    protected override void Initialize(System.Web.Http.Controllers.HttpControllerContext controllerContext)
    {
        base.Initialize(controllerContext);

        // User is not avaliable here either...
    }
}
 But if I inspect the User object on the constructor, this is what I get: The authentication is working, if I don't pass my token, it will respond with Unauthorized. If I pass the token and I try to access the user from any of the methods, it is authenticated and populated correctly. It just doesn't show up on the constructor when it is called. In my WebApiConfig I am using: public static void Register(HttpConfiguration config)
{
    config.SuppressDefaultHostAuthentication();
    config.Filters.Add(new HostAuthenticationFilter(OAuthDefaults.AuthenticationType));

    // Web API routes
    config.MapHttpAttributeRoutes();

    config.Routes.MapHttpRoute(
        name: "DefaultApi",
        routeTemplate: "api/{controller}/{id}",
        defaults: new { id = RouteParameter.Optional }
    );

     // ... other unrelated injections using AutoFac
 } 
 I noticed that if I remove this line: config.SuppressDefaultHostAuthentication() the User is populated on the constructor. Is this expected? How can I get the authenticated user on the constructor? EDIT: As Rikard suggested I tried to get the user in the Initialize method, but it is still not avaliable, giving me the same thing described in the image.
@CODE:app.UseOAuthBearerTokens app.UseCookieAuthentication(new CookieAuthenticationOptions()) WebApiConfig builder.RegisterType<ValueRepository>().As<IValueRepository>().InstancePerRequest(); [RoutePrefix("api/values")]
public class ValuesController : ApiController
{
    private IValueRepository valueRepository;

    public ValuesController(IValueRepository repo)
    {
        valueRepository = repo;
        // I would need the User information here to pass it to my repository
        // something like this:
        valueRepository.SetUser(User);
    }

    protected override void Initialize(System.Web.Http.Controllers.HttpControllerContext controllerContext)
    {
        base.Initialize(controllerContext);

        // User is not avaliable here either...
    }
} Unauthorized WebApiConfig public static void Register(HttpConfiguration config)
{
    config.SuppressDefaultHostAuthentication();
    config.Filters.Add(new HostAuthenticationFilter(OAuthDefaults.AuthenticationType));

    // Web API routes
    config.MapHttpAttributeRoutes();

    config.Routes.MapHttpRoute(
        name: "DefaultApi",
        routeTemplate: "api/{controller}/{id}",
        defaults: new { id = RouteParameter.Optional }
    );

     // ... other unrelated injections using AutoFac

@TITLE:Scala: Receiving Server-Sent-Events
@CONTENT:Set-up: A project I am working on has a pub/sub server with an HTTP interface. Subscription works by accepting server-sent-events. curl -X GET server:port/topics/news
 which will be pushed whenever a message is published to the given topic URL curl -X PUT server:port/topics/news -d "Politician Lies!"
 Problem: I have a scala project which needs to subscribe to this pub/sub server. The Play! framework is able to handle this by using PlayWS with Enumeratee + Iteratee. Unfortunately, the PlayWS library requires that a Play! Application is in scope and I am not using Play. Is there a library (with minimal dependancies) I can use which allows me to accept server-sent-events? I'll need at least one working example in order to get started. I have a preference for scala libraries but I'm willing to accept a Java solution if I have to.

@TITLE:python / django - bidi brackets issue in html select list
@CONTENT:I am running python2.7 with django 1.4. I have the following code in my views.py page which returns the language names in a select list: python code: (views.py) available_languages = []
for lv in language_versions:
    language = LANGUAGES[lv.language_code]
    if lv.language_code == user_language_code:
        language_label = (lv.language_code, u"%s" % (language.name_native))
    else:
        language_label = (lv.language_code, u"%s / %s" % (language.name, language.name_native))
    available_languages.append(language_label)

available_languages = sorted(available_languages, key=lambda x: x[1], cmp=compare)

return available_languages
 HTML code: {{ field }}
 select list: German / Deutsch
Polish / polski
Portuguese (Brasil) / portugu?s (Brasil)
Spanish (Latin America) / espa?ol (Latinoam?rica)
Russian / p??????
 The problem is when the page is viewed in a rtl language like Arabic the select list is rendered as follows with the brackets of the ltr text in the wrong positions: ???????? / Deutsch
????????? / polski
??????????) ???????) / portugu?s) Portugal)
???????? ??????) ?????????) / espa?ol) Latinoam?rica)
??????? / p??????
 How do I write the code in the view.py file to correctly display the bidi brackets? I have read quite a few threads and tried many different ways to fix the issue, but I have run out of ideas. One attempt that did not work was bookending the language names with the Unicode control (directional) characters & #8234; & #8236; & rlm; in the view.py file - the & #8234; & #8236; & rlm; is rendered to the select list in the page. For example: & #8234;??????? ??????) ?????????) / portugu?s (Brasil)& #8236; & rlm; Also adding the following to the css has no effect: direction: rtl; unicode-bidi: embed
@CODE:available_languages = []

    language = LANGUAGES[lv.language_code]

@TITLE:What does trust proxy actually do in express.js, and do I need to use it?
@CONTENT:I am writing an express app that sits behind an nginx server. I was reading through express's documentation and it mentioned the 'trust proxy' setting. All it says is trust proxy Enables reverse proxy support, disabled by default I read the little article here that explains Secure Sessions in Node with nginx. http://blog.nikmartin.com/2013/07/secure-sessions-in-nodejs-with-nginx.html So I am curious. Does setting 'trust proxy' to true only matter when using HTTPS? Currently my app is just HTTP between the client and nginx. If I set it to true now, are there any side-effects/repercussions I need to be aware of? Is there any point to setting it true now?

@LINK:/questions/23289341/angular-js-memory-leaks-when-should-i-start-worrying
@TITLE:Angular.js memory leaks, when should I start worrying
@CONTENT:So I have this rather large application built on angular, alot of nested states, alot of directives, data tables and stuff. We recently decided to switch to full single page, instead of having few small single apps sections(say articles, people, dashboard were each a small single page app previously), so I started dealing with performance a bit more. In chrome you don't visually notice a thing, on firefox on the other hand I THINK it becomes slower over time. So I started with three snapshot technique to see what's up. But I'm not entirely sure what to make of it. IMAGE snapshot size doubles its size each snapshot taken(1st 15mb, 2nd 67mb, 3rd 120mb), does this mean anything? there's a LOT of red dom, 4000 of red divs for example Now I feel that those red divs, spans and anchors are mainly my fault, I'm doing some not-so-usual stuff to render those data tables, using this directive I made, and I also feel that some of heap objects are result of those dom elements not being removed properly. This is what the table directive essentially does var rows = '<div class="row" ng-repeat="item in items">';

_.each(columns, function(column) {
   // pass cell as a string from $templateCache, instead of having <table-cell type="column.type"> which loaded correct templateUrl depending on what was passed via type attr
   var cellTemplate = $templateCache.get(column.type);
   rows += '<div class="column">' + cellTemplate  + '</div>';
});

rows += '</div>';

// el is from directive link function
el.html(rows);

$compile(el.contents())(scope);
 Reason why I'm doing this at all is because when I tried to use nested ng-repeat for rows and columns and <table-cell> directive for cells, it took way too long to render, even with only about 6 columns and 50 rows. So what I think is happening is that none of those divs inside this table gets removed properly so they keep stacking up everytime this table directive loads. Now even if I deal with that detached dom tree.. what about all the other stuff, how do I know which I should try and deal with, and which are usual for angular and doesn't really affect the performance? // edit table directive on plunker http://plnkr.co/edit/1fZi6mVn2jBIGF0Q2a40?p=preview
@CODE:var rows = '<div class="row" ng-repeat="item in items">';

_.each(columns, function(column) {
   // pass cell as a string from $templateCache, instead of having <table-cell type="column.type"> which loaded correct templateUrl depending on what was passed via type attr
   var cellTemplate = $templateCache.get(column.type);
   rows += '<div class="column">' + cellTemplate  + '</div>';
});

rows += '</div>';

@TITLE:Who owns wrapped streams (e.g. TextWriter) in .NET?
@CONTENT:I've recently encountered an error "ObjectDisposedException: Cannot access a closed Stream" [ObjectDisposedException: Cannot access a closed Stream.]
    System.IO.MemoryStream.Write(Byte[] buffer, Int32 offset, Int32 count) +10184402
    System.Security.Cryptography.CryptoStream.FlushFinalBlock() +114
    System.Security.Cryptography.CryptoStream.Dispose(Boolean disposing) +48
 when using code following the format: using (var stream = new MemoryStream())
{
    using (var hashStream = new CryptoStream(stream,
                                    new SHA256Managed(), CryptoStreamMode.Write))
    using (var writer = new TextWriter(hashStream))
    {
        writer.Write("something");
    }
    // ^-- Exception occurs on hashStream Dispose
    //     While naively I assumed that TextWriter.Dispose wouldn't touch the
    //     underlying stream(s).
    return stream.ToArray();
}
 So the exception is caused because the Dispose of the TextWriter Disposes the Stream (hashStream) that is wrapped. My questions are thus: Does this convention applied (with default constructors/arguments) to all stream in .NET? Is there canon discussing this resource usage pattern? For instance, can it be assumed that the CryptoStream would have closed the MemoryStream? I know the answer, and there are other questions specifically about this, but I would like it addressed in terms of a design guideline if there is such. Where is such behavior documented? I can't find "ownerships" discussed in the TextWriter(stream) or CryptoStream constructors - surely I am just looking at the wrong location. (Update: apparently I fail at reading, as pointed out by itsme86 this is documented in the TextWriter constructor documentation.) What is the universal accepted method to write such code? That is, the underlying stream needs to be read (at the end of all operations, and thus still open) while all the nested streams should be closed/flushed completely - a simple CryptoStream.Flush is not sufficient, for instance.

@TITLE:Upgrade path for re-usable apps with South AND django 1.7 migrations
@CONTENT:Or: can Django 1.7 users still use South? I'm the maintainer of a re-usable app. Our policy is to always support the latest two versions of Django. We have an extensive set of South migrations and, we want to support the new Django 1.7 migration system going forward. What I'm confused with is how I can allow developers to use my app with both Django 1.6 (and South) and Django 1.7 (new migrations). The Django Documentation recommends just deleting all the pre-existing South migrations. But this is not an option, since I need to keep them around for my Django 1.6 users. The closest to an upgrade path I could come up with, is not use the new migration system until I drop support for Django <1.7 in my app (so when Django 1.8 comes out). But what about the naming clash with the migrate command? Both South and the new system use python manage.py migrate to run migrations. So Django 1.7 users can't use South anymore?

@TITLE:AngularJS: Parent scope is not updated in directive (with isolated scope) two way binding
@CONTENT:I have a directive with isolated scope with a value with two way binding to the parent scope. I am calling a method that changes the value in the parent scope, but the change is not applied in my directive.(two way binding is not triggered). This question is very similar: AngularJS: Parent scope not updated in directive (with isolated scope) two way binding but I am not changing the value from the directive, but changing it only in the parent scope. I read the solution and in point five it is said: The watch() created by the isolated scope checks whether it's value for the bi-directional binding is in sync with the parent's value. If it isn't  the parent's value is copied to the isolated scope.
 Which means that when my parent value is changed to 2, a watch is triggered. It checks whether parent value and directive value are the same - and if not it copies to directive value. Ok but my directive value is still 1 ... What am I missing ? html : <div data-ng-app="testApp">
    <div data-ng-controller="testCtrl">
        <strong>{{myValue}}</strong>
        <span data-test-directive data-parent-item="myValue" 
            data-parent-update="update()"></span>
    </div>
</div>
 js: var testApp = angular.module('testApp', []);

testApp.directive('testDirective', function ($timeout) {
    return {
        scope: {
            key: '=parentItem',
            parentUpdate: '&'
        },
        replace: true,
        template:
            '<button data-ng-click="lock()">Lock</button>' +
            '</div>',
        controller: function ($scope, $element, $attrs) {
            $scope.lock = function () {
                console.log('directive :', $scope.key);

                 $scope.parentUpdate();
                 //$timeout($scope.parentUpdate); // would work.

                 // expecting the value to be 2, but it is 1
                 console.log('directive :', $scope.key);
            };
        }
    };

@TITLE:Unity 4.3 - 2D, how to assign programmatically sprites to an object
@CONTENT:I'm trying to create an object that will be responsible of creating and showing different sprites, so I would like to access directly the assets/sprites programmatically instead of drag and drop a sprite in the hierarchy under that object. There's a way to programmatically create a new sprite and assign what I have in the assets folder? I also would like to have a sort of data structure with a few images loaded at the start of the game, an array or a dictionary or something like that so I can change based on some situation which images I need to show. But what confuses me since I'm new to Unity is how to create a sprite taking the reference to the sprite programmatically using the assets folder. edit with progress: I've created an array of sprites like this: public Sprite[] mySprites;
 in Unity I've added sprites inside the array manually (I just dragged png's inside the variable array) so actually in this Object I have a Component with this array full of sprites inside the component I also have done this: public SpriteRenderer renderer;
renderer = transform.GetComponent<SpriteRenderer>();
renderer.sprite = (Sprite)mySprites [0];
 I got no error until I run the game, then the sprite is NOT assigned and I got this: "PPtr cast failed when dereferencing! Castin from Texture2D to Sprite!" I got this error even without casting (Sprite) and btw I don't know why he is telling my about Texture2D since verything is setted as sprite

renderer = transform.GetComponent<SpriteRenderer>();

@TITLE:Rails 4, Puma, Nginx - ActionController::Live Streaming dies after first chunk sent
@CONTENT:Here's a bare-bones Rails 4 project I've set up to troubleshoot my problem: https://github.com/rejacobson/rails4-streamtest I have a route set up at /home/stream that should stream a line of text 5 times in 1 second intervals. def stream
  5.times do |n|
    puts "Streaming: #{n}"
    response.stream.write "Streaming: #{n+1}"
    sleep 1
  end
rescue IOError => e
  puts 'Connection closed'
ensure
  response.stream.close
end
 When I run puma using tcp://, without nginx, the streaming works perfectly. curl -N http://localhost:3000/home/stream
 And I get the 5 lines streamed back, no problem. When I introduce nginx, curl will output the first line but immediately exit after that. I do continue to see output from the puts calls on the server and logs, so I know the request is still processing in the 5.times loop. It also doesn't throw an IOError exception like it would if the user cut the connection. Here's what I've tried so far: Different combinations of nginx directives in the main conf file and the server conf. Changing rails settings. Various puma config settings. Setting all kinds of different headers in the controller method in the hopes that it was a caching issue. Searching the internet has provided very little help as well. I'm at a loss and require some direction. Here's the output of both curl calls, with and without nginx. Without nginx ~/projects/streamtest ? master ?

@LINK:/questions/22381173/how-seleniums-bychained-class-really-works
@TITLE:How Selenium's ByChained class really works?
@CONTENT:I am very confused with what the documentation for ByChained class mentions. It says: Mechanism used to locate elements within a document using a series of other lookups. This class will find all DOM elements that matches each of the locators in sequence, e.g. driver.findElements(new ByChained(by1, by2)) will find all elements that match by2 and appear under an element that matches by1. There is also an issue for selenium on code.google.com, raised for ByChained class where someone has commented saying it's meant to be used to find element/elements using several locators. I don't get it. Why should by1 and by2 be locators of two different elements? When I initally came across this class I felt that it will help in locating element(s) by using different locators. So that if one locator does not work, the next would work. But when I practically used this class it behaved very weirdly and threw NoSuchElementException all the time. For example, if my html is: <html>
  <body>
    <div id="details">
      <input id="firstName" class="personName" type="text"/>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
 I want to find the input field by using two locators in ByChained: 1. using By.id("firstName") 2. using By.className("personName") So my code becomes: By myBy = new ByChained(By.id("firstName"),By.className("personName"));
driver.findElement(myBy);
 On execution, I got NoSuchElementException. I was expecting that if my first By did not work, then it will find the element with the next By in the series. Can someone please explain how this class works with an example and in which scenarios it could be used?
@CODE:<html>
  <body>
    <div id="details">
      <input id="firstName" class="personName" type="text"/>
    </div>
  </body>
</html> By.id("firstName") By.className("personName") By myBy = new ByChained(By.id("firstName"),By.className("personName"));
driver.findElement(myBy);

@TITLE:How to draw digital signal in WPF?
@CONTENT:I need to draw digital signal and be able to move each part of the lines in WPF. As shown in picture below the arrows indicate to which direction the part of the line can be moved. Clicking and dragging the "clickable area" will move the whole square left or right. I thought couple of ways to do it: Polyline object. But I cannot control each part of the line. Line object. On each change all lines should adjust their locations. Hard to control "clickable area". Maybe also complicated. Border object. Each section will actually be a border which will show/hide appropriate border side. I'm not sure how easy to make movable sides of the border. Other options... My question is, what is the most correct way to start doing it?

 Every time I want to update the widget, I call startService(new Intent(MusicService.ACTION_PLAY));.

@LINK:/questions/22041419/sbt-integration-test-setup
@TITLE:SBT integration test setup
@CONTENT:I would like to add an Integration Test phase to my SBT + Spray app. Ideally it would be just like Maven, with the following phases: compile: The app is built test: The unit tests are run pre-integration-test: The app is launched in a separate process integration-test: The integration tests are run; they issue requests to the app running in the background and verify that the correct results are returned post-integration-test: The instance of the app previously launched is shut down I'm having a lot of trouble getting this to work. Is there a worked example that I can follow? 1) Separate "it" codebase: I started by adding the code shown in the "Integration Test" section of the SBT docs to a new file at project/Build.scala. This allowed me to add some integration tests under "src/it/scala" and to run them with "sbt it:test", but I can't see how to add a pre-integration-test hook. The question "Ensure 're-start' task automatically runs before it:test" seems to address how to set up such a hook, but the answer doesn't work for me (see my comment on there). Also, adding the above code to my build.scala has stopped the "sbt re-start" task from working at all: it tries to run the app in "it" mode, instead of in "default" mode. 2) Integration tests in "test" codebase: I am using IntelliJ, and the separate "it" codebase has really confused it. It can't compile any of the code in that dir, as it thinks that all the dependencies are missing. I tried to paste instead the code from "Additional test configurations with shared sources" from the SBT docs, but I get a compile error: [error] E:\Work\myproject\project\Build.scala:14: not found: value testOptions
[error]         testOptions in Test := Seq(Tests.Filter(unitFilter)),
 Is there a worked example I can follow? I'm considering giving up on setting this up via SBT and instead adding a test flag to mark tests as "integration" and writing an external script to handle this.

When trying to compile a project with Platform Toolset to Windows7.1SDK I'm getting Error   1   error MSB6006: "CL.exe" exited with code -1073741515.   C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\Microsoft.Cpp\v4.0\Platforms\Win32\Microsoft.Cpp.Win32.targets   57  5   MenuBrowser
 I tried running the supplied "Windows SDK Configuration Tool" and besides getting an error about Visual Studio 2005 and 2008 not being installed I think it did its job. I tried manually editing the registry: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft SDKs\Windows
 where I manually put CurrentInstallFolder as C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1\ and CurrentVersion as 7.1.7600.0.30514. If I look at the project properties and click the different paths / variables in there -> more -> Macros, I can see that $(WindowsSdkDir) is correct. Any idea as to what I should try? Never ran into this problem on the old development computer with Windows 7 and VS 2012. L.E. as a note, if I try a new project with the v120 tools, it works, but I need the Windows7.1SDK tools.

@TITLE:Operator precedence of unary operators
@CONTENT:Some information source on operator precedence like this says that unary operators like !, ~, +, - have higher precedence than assignment =. However, the following expressions are possible: !a = true # => false (with warning)
a         # => true

~a = 1    # => -2
a         # => 1

+a = 1    # => 1
a         # => 1

-a = 1    # => -1
a         # => 1
 Considering these results, the only possible explanation I can think of is that these unary operator have lower precedence than the assignment. If that is the case, then it would mean that the information I mentioned above is wrong. Which is correct? Is there a different explanation?
@CODE:! ~ + - = !a = true # => false (with warning)

@LINK:/questions/21972815/about-cast-in-integer-constant-expression-in-standard-c
@TITLE:About cast in integer constant expression (in standard C)
@CONTENT:In standard C (I mean C99 or C11) we have the so-called integer constant expressions, which are constant expressions whose operands are all constant integers. There are other constraints, as to avoid comma operators in the expression. However, other non-integer objects (even non-constant) are allowed in some special cases. For example, if the sizeof operator is applied to an object whose size is known in translation time, this is allowed as part of an integer constant expression (note that sizeof always return an integer value). Moreover, the explicit cast to an integer type is sometimes allowed too. The standard C99 establish the following rule: Standard C99, Section 6.6(par.6): An integer constant expression) shall have integer type and shall only have operands that are integer costants, enumeration constants, character constants, sizeof expressions whose results are integer constants, and floating constants that are the immediate operands of casts. Standard C99 My question is: Which is the exact meaning of "floating constants that are the immediate operands of casts"? A floating constant is something like 3.14e+3, or well 0x2.11p-5. That is, is not a general constant expression of type float, but only a floating point literal. Then, I understand that only something like this is allowed in the definition above:  (int) 3.14
 but are not allowed operations involving floating literals. This exclude cases as the following:  (int) -3.14  /* The minus sign is not part of the constant: it is an operator */
 (int) (3.14) /* The parenthesis are an operator acting on the literal 3.14 */
 The last case does not need to perform any floating point arithmetical operations in translation time, and it is equivalent to have the same without parenthesis: (int) 3.14. However, it is not the immediate operand of a cast. So, do we have to consider that (int) (3.14) is [part of] a valid integer constant expression or not (according to definition)? On the other hand, the compiler GCC (with options: -std=c99 -pedantic-errors) gives me that (int) (3.14) is a valid integer constant expression, for example in a declaration as the following:  #define BITW (int) (3.14)
 struct { unsigned bitfield: BITW } test;  // Translation success
 (However, by doing #define BITW (int) (+3.14) it fails to translate, as expected).
@CODE:sizeof sizeof (int) 3.14 (int) -3.14  /* The minus sign is not part of the constant: it is an operator */
 (int) (3.14) /* The parenthesis are an operator acting on the literal 3.14 */ (int) 3.14 (int) (3.14) (int) (3.14) #define BITW (int) (3.14)
 struct { unsigned bitfield: BITW } test;  // Translation success #define BITW (int) (+3.14) sizeof sizeof sizeof

I have a big set of data in a pandas dataframe (read from a 440 MB csv file). When I'm using the ipython console inside PyCharm, every time I try to handle that data, let's say, I write my_data. it just hangs there for about 30 seconds. I don't really understand what is going on, but it seems PyCharm is going trough all the data to find some smart auto completion (which is a really dumb thing to do).

I'm stumped by how to set up that calculation. I see here that it's possible to grab the data used to generate the contour lines, and then geom_text() could be used to plot the text.

I am starting to think this is a sensible approach. Does anyone know of any examples out there that implement EF6 without a repository, with a service layer. My search on the web has revealed many complex code examples that seem over complicated for no reason at all. My problem is also when using a Service Layer then where do I put: context = new EFDbContext()
 In the controller, the service layer or both ? I read that I can do this with dependancy injection. I already use Unity as an IOC but I don't know how I can do this.

Since everything has been a breeze in Intellij so far, I figured this would be a no brainer, but after an hour and a number of non-functional data type renders later, I find myself ready to crawl back to eclipse. I made a few renderers that worked, but only for objects, so I can only conclude that renderers seem to not work for primitives. Can someone point me in the right direction here?

 I'm having to derive classes because I cannot implement arithmetic operations in the generic type. That is because generic constraints are not rich enough for me to constrain T to support the required arithmetic operations. Grr! Anyway, enough of that. My question concerns the implementation of Zeroise and ToArray. For performance reasons, I want to use raw memory operations. For instance, Zeroise might be: procedure TBigVector<T>.Zeroise;
begin
  ZeroMemory(Pointer(FEntries), Size*SizeOf(T));
end;
 Now, I'm fine with doing that for types like Double and my bespoke Complex type. I know that they are not managed and a raw memory copy creates no difficulty. What I would like to do is add a runtime check, perhaps only called in my debug builds, that enforces the constraint that T has no managed types. How can I do that?

@TITLE:Heroku-like deployment and environment configuration via EC2
@CONTENT:I really like the approach of a 12factor app, which you are kinda forced into, when you deploy an application to Heroku. For this question I'm particularly interested in setting environment variables for configuration, like one would do on Heroku. As far as I can tell, there's no way to change the ENV for one or multiple instances within the EC2 console (though it's seems to be possible to set 5 ENV vars when using elastic beanstalk). Therefore my next bet on an Ubuntu based system would be to use /etc/environment, /etc/profile, ~/.profile or just the export command to set ENV variables. Is this the correct approach or am I missing something? And if so, is there a best practice on how to do it? I guess I could use something like Capistrano or Fabric, get a list of servers from the AWS api, connect to all of them and change the mentioned files/call export. Though 12factor is pretty well known, I couldn't find any blog post describing how to handle the ENV for a non-trivial amount of instances on EC2. And I don't want to implement such a thing, if somebody already did it very well and I just missed something. Note: I want a solution without using elastic beanstalk and I don't care about git push deployment or any other Heroku-like feature, this is solely related to app configuration. Any hints appreciated, thanks!

@TITLE:Is it possible to have a UIImageView inside of a UIScrollView zoom in and out, but stick to center with Auto Layout?
@CONTENT:Long story short, I'm trying to build functionality similar to Photos.app. I have a UIScrollView with a UIImageView inside of it set up in the Storyboard. Zooming works, but I'm having trouble keeping it centered. In all my frame based scroll view implementations I've centered it as follows, which works beautifully: - (void)scrollViewDidZoom:(UIScrollView *)scrollView {
    CGRect newImageViewFrame = self.imageView.frame;

    // Center horizontally
    if (newImageViewFrame.size.width < CGRectGetWidth(scrollView.bounds)) {
        newImageViewFrame.origin.x = (CGRectGetWidth(scrollView.bounds) - CGRectGetWidth(self.imageView.frame)) / 2;
    }
    else {
        newImageViewFrame.origin.x = 0;
    }

    // Center vertically
    if (newImageViewFrame.size.height < CGRectGetHeight(scrollView.bounds)) {
        newImageViewFrame.origin.y = (CGRectGetHeight(scrollView.bounds) - CGRectGetHeight(self.imageView.frame)) / 2;
    }
    else {
        newImageViewFrame.origin.y = 0;
    }

    self.imageView.frame = newImageViewFrame;
}
 But with Auto Layout it isn't at all. I have no constraints on the UIScrollView or UIImageView, as I don't know what they should be. I'm thinking I should glue the UIScrollView to the four corners, but for the UIImageView I'm not completely sure, as the zooming changes its frame. Here's an example project: http://cl.ly/21371H3q381N How would I go about having zooming with centering work with Auto Layout?
@CODE:- (void)scrollViewDidZoom:(UIScrollView *)scrollView {
    CGRect newImageViewFrame = self.imageView.frame;

    // Center horizontally
    if (newImageViewFrame.size.width < CGRectGetWidth(scrollView.bounds)) {
        newImageViewFrame.origin.x = (CGRectGetWidth(scrollView.bounds) - CGRectGetWidth(self.imageView.frame)) / 2;
    }
    else {
        newImageViewFrame.origin.x = 0;
    }

    // Center vertically
    if (newImageViewFrame.size.height < CGRectGetHeight(scrollView.bounds)) {
        newImageViewFrame.origin.y = (CGRectGetHeight(scrollView.bounds) - CGRectGetHeight(self.imageView.frame)) / 2;
    }
    else {
        newImageViewFrame.origin.y = 0;
    }

    self.imageView.frame = newImageViewFrame;
}

@TITLE:very slow highlight performance in lucene
@CONTENT:Lucene (4.6) highlighter has very slow performance, when a frequent term is searched. Search is fast (100ms), but highlight may take more than an hour(!). Details: great text corpus was used (1.5GB plain text). Performance doesn't depend if text is splitted into more small pieces or not. (Tested with 500MB and 5MB pieces as well.) Positions and offsets are stored. If a very frequent term or pattern is searched, TopDocs are retrieved fast (100ms), but each "searcher.doc(id)" calls are expensive (5-50s), and getBestFragments() are extremely expensive (more than 1 hour). Even they are stored and indexed for this purpose. (hardware: core i7, 8GM mem) Greater background: it would serve a language analysis research. A special stemming is used: it stores the part of speech info, too. For example if "adj adj adj adj noun" is searched, it gives all its occurrences in the text with context. Can i tune its performance, or should i choose another tool? Used code:             //indexing

@LINK:/questions/21635193/auto-layout-issue-with-a-uitableview-section-header
@TITLE:Auto Layout issue with a UITableView section header
@CONTENT:I am working with a UITableViewController. I have a table of items that the user can delete if he goes into edit more. When he goes into edit mode, I want to show a header that gives an option to delete all items. At the same time, it should show a label giving information about how much space is being used. I want this to automatically resize if the device goes into landscape mode. From what I can tell, I need to use autolayout to do this. I would have loved to set up the header in a UIView designed in the Storyboard, but the Storyboard only allows view controllers, not views. I know I could have a XIB file hold it, but I would rather avoid that if I could. To start with, I've overridden the editing property so that I can redraw the table section when in editing mode. - (void)setEditing:(BOOL)editing animated:(BOOL)animated
{
    [super setEditing:editing animated:animated];
    NSIndexSet *set = [NSIndexSet indexSetWithIndex:0];
    [self.tableView reloadSections:set withRowAnimation:UITableViewRowAnimationAutomatic];
}
 I use this code to insert the section header when appropriate: - (UIView *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView viewForHeaderInSection:(NSInteger)section
{
    if (self.isEditing)
        return [self headerView];
    else
        return nil;
}

- (CGFloat)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView heightForHeaderInSection:(NSInteger)section
{
    if (self.isEditing)
        return [self headerView].frame.size.height;
    else
        return 0;
}
 The magic happens in the - headerView method. It returns a UIView *, getting it from a cache if necessary. It adds the button and the label and then puts in the constraints. I've used these same constraints in the Storyboard and I haven't had any problems. - (UIView *)headerView
{
    if (headerView)
        return headerView;

    float w = [[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds].size.width;

    UIButton *deleteAllButton = [UIButton buttonWithType:UIButtonTypeRoundedRect];
    [deleteAllButton setTitle:@"Delete All" forState:UIControlStateNormal];
    CGRect deleteAllButtonFrame = CGRectMake(8.0, 8.0, 30.0, 30);   // The autolayout should resize this.
    [deleteAllButton setFrame:deleteAllButtonFrame];

    [deleteAllButton setContentCompressionResistancePriority:751 forAxis:UILayoutConstraintAxisHorizontal];

    CGRect textFrame = CGRectMake(47.0, 8.0, 30.0, 30); // The autolayout should resize this.
    UILabel *currSizeText = [[UILabel alloc] initWithFrame:textFrame];
    currSizeText.text = @"You have a lot of text here telling you that you have stuff to delete";
    currSizeText.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = NO;
    currSizeText.adjustsFontSizeToFitWidth = YES;

    CGRect headerViewFrame = CGRectMake(0, 0, w, 48);

    return headerView;
}
 Right now, everything is working beautifully. The button keeps a constant size (because the hugging and compression resistance are higher than the label's) and the label will change its text to fit the available space. It resizes when I rotate the device. The vertical centering seems off on the label, but I am willing to overlook that for now. However, when I first setup the section header, I get an annoying autolayout warning. 2014-02-07 11:25:19.770 ErikApp[10704:70b] Unable to simultaneously satisfy constraints.
    Probably at least one of the constraints in the following list is one you don't want. Try this: (1) look at each constraint and try to figure out which you don't expect; (2) find the code that added the unwanted constraint or constraints and fix it.

@TITLE:Why would the height increase with a smaller font size?
@CONTENT:I have a block with a certain line-height, where I insert content with the ::before pseudo element. .block::before {
  content:'text here';
}
 This works well. However, if I also give the content a smaller font size .block::before {
  font-size:.6em;
  content:'text here';
}
 the block actually becomes higher. Why is that? JsFiddle. The top row doesn't have font size changes, the bottom row does. Now I found out that a possible solution is to set the line-height of the pseudo element to 0. Or to 1em. Or even to normal. So what is going on? Is the line-height set to some weird value by setting the font size to .6em? Why? PS Although this looks like a duplicate (see the list to the right), none of the answers I've read so far explains why setting line-height:normal solves the issue. There must be something happening that sets the line-height to a greater value implicitly. And that's what I'm trying to find out.
@CODE:::before .block::before {
  content:'text here';
} .block::before {
  font-size:.6em;
  content:'text here';
} line-height 0 1em normal line-height .6em line-height:normal

@TITLE:How to uninstall with msiexec using product id guid without .msi file present
@CONTENT:I'm trying to automate the uninstallation of packages created using WiX for the purposes of changing the installed software stack & configuration without reprovisioning a whole OS. Eventually I'll use powershell scripting to do this but at the moment I can't seem to get my test package to uninstall interactively with cmd. If I run: msiexec /x '{A4BFF20C-A21E-4720-88E5-79D5A5AEB2E8}' msiexec /x A4BFF20C-A21E-4720-88E5-79D5A5AEB2E8 I get: "The installation package could not be opened. Verify that the package exists and that you can access it, or contact the application vendor to verify that this is a valid Windows Installer Package." If I run: msiexec /x {A4BFF20C-A21E-4720-88E5-79D5A5AEB2E8} I get: "This action is only valid for products that are currently installed" I've looked at the windows installer guide, the WiX documentation, msiexec documentation and used orca to go over the .msi myself but I've not really found anything that gives a clear picture of how an uninstall is processed. Is the .msi file required and if not then why does windows installer seem to think it is when given a GUID? The WiX code for the .msi installer is: <?xml version='1.0' encoding='windows-1252'?>

And am completely new to Vert.x. So, from the choices perspective to build a reactive application stack I want to know - Is the message-passing model of Akka and Vert.x very different? How? Are the data-structures behind Akka's actors and Vert.x's verticles to buffer messages very different?

Originally I had the idea that you could point the webserver to the different dev and prod folders in the environment folder but after reading up a bit I realise this is not the case. In Yii 1 you would solve this by just having multiple index.php's i.e.: index.php index-local.php So the question is what benefit does this new environment structure actually give me over the old way?

@TITLE:Counting bounded slice codility
@CONTENT:I have recently attended a programming test in codility, and the question is to find the Number of bounded slice in an array.. I am just giving you breif explanation of the question. A Slice of an array said to be a Bounded slice if Max(SliceArray)-Min(SliceArray)<=K. If Array [3,5,6,7,3] and K=2 provided .. the number of bounded slice is 9, first slice (0,0) in the array Min(0,0)=3 Max(0,0)=3 Max-Min<=K result 0<=2 so it is bounded slice second slice (0,1) in the array Min(0,1)=3 Max(0,1)=5 Max-Min<=K result 2<=2 so it is bounded slice second slice (0,2) in the array Min(0,1)=3 Max(0,2)=6 Max-Min<=K result 3<=2 so it is not bounded slice in this way you can find that there are nine bounded slice. (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 4). Following is the solution i have provided private int FindBoundSlice(int K, int[] A)
{
    int BoundSlice=0;
    Stack<int> MinStack = new Stack<int>();
    Stack<int> MaxStack = new Stack<int>();




    for (int p = 0; p < A.Length; p++)
    {
        MinStack.Push(A[p]);
        MaxStack.Push(A[p]);
        for (int q = p; q < A.Length; q++)
        {
            if (IsPairBoundedSlice(K, A[p], A[q], MinStack, MaxStack))
                BoundSlice++;
            else
                break;
        }
    }

    return BoundSlice;
}

private bool IsPairBoundedSlice(int K, int P, int Q,Stack<int> Min,Stack<int> Max)
{
    if (Min.Peek() > P)
    {
        Min.Pop();
        Min.Push(P);
    }

    if (Min.Peek() > Q)
    {
        Min.Pop();
        Min.Push(Q);
    }

    if (Max.Peek() < P)
    {
        Max.Pop();
        Max.Push(P);
    }

    }

    if (Max.Peek() - Min.Peek() <= K)
        return true;
    else
        return false;

@TITLE:Still sort of confused about Big O notation
@CONTENT:So I've been trying to understand Big O notation as well as I can, but there are still some things I'm confused about. So I keep reading that if something is O(n), it usually is referring to the worst-case of an algorithm, but that it doesn't necessarily have to refer to the worst case scenario, which is why we can say the best-case of insertion sort for example is O(n). However, I can't really make sense of what that means. I know that if the worst-case is O(n^2), it means that the function that represents the algorithm in its worst case grows no faster than n^2 (there is an upper bound). But if you have O(n) as the best case, how should I read that as? In the best case, the algorithm grows no faster than n? What I picture is a graph with n as the upper bound, like If the best case scenario of an algorithm is O(n), then n is the upper bound of how fast the operations of the algorithm grow in the best case, so they cannot grow faster than n...but wouldn't that mean that they can grow as fast as O(log n) or O(1), since they are below the upper bound? That wouldn't make sense though, because O(log n) or O(1) is a better scenario than O(n), so O(n) WOULDN'T be the best case? I'm so lost lol

@TITLE:How to correctly notify MediaScanner about a folder, even on Nexus/Kitkat devices?
@CONTENT:Background I'm making an app that downloads some images from the Internet into a specific folder that is defined as: final String pathToPutFiles = Environment.getExternalStoragePublicDirectory(Environment.DIRECTORY_PICTURES)
            + File.separator + DOWNLOAD_FOLDER_NAME;
 I wish to make the gallery and any app that shows media, to be notified of those images and be able to show them. Sadly I'm having problems on Nexus 4, which has Kitkat version (4.4.2 to be exact). Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. The problem There are plenty of posts about this issue, and I've tried many of them and none worked using a simple folder path: using an intent of Intent.ACTION_MEDIA_SCANNER_SCAN_FILE , as shown here . This didn't work on any device creating an instance of MediaScannerConnectionClient and call scan once the connection was done, as shown here and here . Not sure what's wrong with this, as it does succeed to connect. call scanFile , as shown here , with and without a listener. This worked fine on Galaxy S3, but not on Nexus 4. This is what I've chosen to do, but I've noticed that it can't work with a single folder path. Instead, it need an array of files to notify about. What I've tried This is what I've done (again, it works fine on Galaxy S3 which has Android 4.3, but sometimes doesn't work on Nexus 4 which has Android 4.4.2) : protected void notifyMediaScannerOfNewImageFiles(final String folderPathToScan) {
        final ArrayList<String> newFilesToScan = new ArrayList<String>();
        preparePaths(folderPathToScan, newFilesToScan, true);
        final String[] newFilesToScanArr = newFilesToScan.toArray(new String[newFilesToScan.size()]);
        MediaScannerConnection.scanFile(getApplicationContext(), newFilesToScanArr, null, null);
}

public static void preparePathsForMediaScanning(final String folderPathToScan, final Collection<String> pathsToFill,
        final boolean recursive) {
    if (TextUtils.isEmpty(folderPathToScan))
        return;
    final File folderToScan = new File(folderPathToScan);
    if (!folderToScan.exists())
        return;
    pathsToFill.add(folderPathToScan);
    if (!folderToScan.isDirectory())
        return;
    final File[] childrenFiles = folderToScan.listFiles();
    if (childrenFiles == null || childrenFiles.length == 0)
        return;
    for (final File childFile : childrenFiles) {
        if (childFile.exists()) {
            final String childFilePath = childFile.getAbsolutePath();
            pathsToFill.add(childFilePath);
            if (recursive && childFile.isDirectory())
                preparePathsForMediaScanning(childFilePath, pathsToFill, true);
        }
    }
}
 The question How should I notify of an entire folder to scan? Why does this method work only sometimes on Kitkat ? Is it just Nexus devices, or other devices too? What should be used to support all devices and Android versions?
@CODE:final String pathToPutFiles = Environment.getExternalStoragePublicDirectory(Environment.DIRECTORY_PICTURES)
            + File.separator + DOWNLOAD_FOLDER_NAME; protected void notifyMediaScannerOfNewImageFiles(final String folderPathToScan) {
        final ArrayList<String> newFilesToScan = new ArrayList<String>();
        preparePaths(folderPathToScan, newFilesToScan, true);
        final String[] newFilesToScanArr = newFilesToScan.toArray(new String[newFilesToScan.size()]);
        MediaScannerConnection.scanFile(getApplicationContext(), newFilesToScanArr, null, null);
}

public static void preparePathsForMediaScanning(final String folderPathToScan, final Collection<String> pathsToFill,
        final boolean recursive) {
    if (TextUtils.isEmpty(folderPathToScan))
        return;
    final File folderToScan = new File(folderPathToScan);
    if (!folderToScan.exists())

    final File[] childrenFiles = folderToScan.listFiles();

            final String childFilePath = childFile.getAbsolutePath();

 I was wondering if by using the asterisk in the previous values, my applet (once deployed) can be blacklisted by Java or by Oracle in a future version or now with the 7u51 (or perhaps the certificate can be blacklisted). Is it ok to use asterisks here?

@TITLE:Who owns calendars created by service account via Google Calendar API and how can they be shared?
@CONTENT:Let's say I have a Google account some.account@gmail.com with project project-1 (configured as Google App Engine application in Google Developer Console) and a service account with e-mail address 12..@developer.gserviceaccount.com that belong to it. I know how to use this service account to create a calendar and manipulate its entries programmatically: I use the Google APIs Client Library (Java version, with service account?s credentials) to invoke Google Calendar API inside my Google App Engine application and it does just that. However any such created calendars seem to be distinctly owned by the service account, not by my englobing Google account. I conclude this from the following observations: When I view my Google account's calendar in the Google Calendar UI, none of the programmatically created calendars show up under My calendars. When I try to access such a calendar by issuing Other calendars | Add a friend?s calendar and with the service account?s email-address, I can send off the request, but it never gets answered (presumably because the service account's e-mail address isn't a "real" e-mail address). When I'm creating calendars programmatically, I don't set CalendarListEntry#hidden, so the default false should apply. So my question is this: How can I access calendars and calendar entries that were created programmatically with Google Calendar API (and a Java client in my case) in the normal Google Calendar Web UI. E.g., can the service account share its calendars with its owning Google account, or can I directly manipulate the Google account's calendars with its service account credentials in the UI. I realize there are some previous questions on the same topic, but they haven't helped to solve the mystery for me so far.

@LINK:/questions/21085735/are-move-semantics-incomplete
@TITLE:Are move semantics incomplete?
@CONTENT:Move semantics replace copy semantics in situations where copying is inefficient. Copy semantics deals fully with copyable objects, including const objects. Already, there exists a myriad of non-copyable objects in c++11, for example std::unique_ptr. These objects rely on move semantics completely because moving from an object allows for invalidating it. This is important (imho) for popular design patterns like RAII. A problem occurs when a const non-copyable object is assigned to an area of memory. Such an object can't be recovered in any way. This is obviously important during the lifetime of the object, because of its constness. At the end of it's lifetime, when the destructor is called however, the (non-existent) object is briefly non-const. I suggest that a moving destructor could be a valuable addition to the move semantics model. Consider a simple situation where an unique_ptr is used in an unordered_set. You can insert into this set using a move constructor (or construct "emplace"), however if you wanted to move this pointer to another unordered_set (i.e. keeping it const) it would be impossible. Essential, there is a iterator insert((possibly const) key&&) but no const key&& erase(iterator). In fact it would be impossible. The container could only be extended to return some pointer to the key, and forget about it. A moving destructor could solve this ie const MyClass&& ~MyClass(), since it would only violate const during destruction (when the compiler considers the object is invalid anyway). EDIT: I should point outconst MyClass&& ~MyClass() const actually makes more sense. The destructor doesn't have to modify anyhting, only destroy the object as if it were no longer a valid handle to whatever resource it controlled.

@CONTENT:I'm looking for an algorithm to solve the following problem. I have a number of subsets (1-n) of a given set (a-h).

@LINK:/questions/20921177/how-to-model-mixins-multiple-interfaces-in-haskell
@TITLE:How to model mixins / multiple interfaces in Haskell?
@CONTENT:I came across this question on modeling inheritance in Haskell and it reminded me that I have a little more complicated version of the same problem. I'll adopt the example from there because it's easier than thinking up my own. Suppose your program contains a number of types: data Camera = Camera ...
data Light = SpotLight ... | DirectionalLight ...
data Object = Monster ... | Player ... | NPC ...
 Now you want to implement some basic physics, so you want them all to have a position and a velocity, say of some type Vec3. One way to do this is to declare a Physical typeclass with pos and vel functions, and make all your types instances of it. But that means you have to modify all the types to contain two Vec3s, which is annoying if you have a lot of nice types defined already and you just want to glue a little bit of functionality on top. The lens-based solution suggested by Chris Taylor has the same issue. A solution that feels neater to me is to declare a new type constructor, data Physical a = Physical a Vec3 Vec3
 Then you only have to implement pos, vel, and a Functor instance once, and you get to keep all your existing type declarations. However... this doesn't compose very well. If you now want to have the ability to paint your objects blue or green or purple, you might want to do the same thing with colours: data Coloured a = Coloured a Colour
 But now if you have a Coloured Physical Camera you have to fmap a different number of times depending on whether you want to look at its colour or its position or its focal length. And a Coloured Physical Camera ought to be the same thing as a Physical Coloured Camera, but it's not. So this is not an elegant solution. Is there a nice way to mix in different sets of functionality to types in Haskell? A simple solution that works in plain old Haskell without language extensions or a lot of boilerplate would be ideal, but I'm also open to learning any of the lens-related libraries if that's really the best way to approach the problem. (This older question on mixins-style code reuse seems related, but I'm afraid I don't fully understand the question or the accepted solution.)
@CODE:data Camera = Camera ...
data Light = SpotLight ... | DirectionalLight ...
data Object = Monster ... | Player ... | NPC ... Vec3 Physical pos vel Vec3 data Physical a = Physical a Vec3 Vec3 pos vel Functor data Coloured a = Coloured a Colour Coloured Physical Camera fmap Coloured Physical Camera Physical Coloured Camera

@TITLE:what's the difference between github repository and git bare repository?
@CONTENT:In github repository, we can git push git pull operations, at the same time, we can commit to the repository through the web UI. It seems that the github repository works as bare repository and working repository at the same time? However, in git bare repository, we cannot commit directory to the repository. So, my question is What's real difference between github repository and git bare repository?

@LINK:/questions/20809669/should-enum-never-be-used-in-an-api
@TITLE:Should enum never be used in an API?
@CONTENT:I am using a C library provided to me already compiled. I have limited information on the compiler, version, options, etc., used when compiling the library. The library interface uses enum both in structures that are passed and directly as passed parameters. The question is: how can I assure or establish that when I compile code to use the provided library, that my compiler will use the same size for those enums? If it does not, the structures won't line up, and the parameter passing may be messed up, e.g. long vs. int. My concern stems from the C99 standard, which states that the enum type: shall be compatible with char, a signed integer type, or an unsigned integer type. The choice of type is implementation-defined, but shall be capable of representing the values of all the members of the enumeration. As far as I can tell, so long as the largest value fits, the compiler can pick any type it darn well pleases, effectively on a whim, potentially varying not only between compilers, but different versions of the same compiler and/or compiler options. It could pick 1, 2, 4, or 8-byte representations, resulting in potential incompatibilities in both structures and parameter passing. (It could also pick signed or unsigned, but I don't see a mechanism for that being a problem in this context.) Am I missing something here? If I am not missing something, does this mean that enum should never be used in an API? Update: Yes, I was missing something. While the language specification doesn't help here, as noted by @Barmar the Application Binary Interface (ABI) does. Or if it doesn't, then the ABI is deficient. The ABI for my system indeed specifies that an enum must be a signed four-byte integer. If a compiler does not obey that, then it is a bug. Given a complete ABI and compliant compilers, enum can be used safely in an API.

@CONTENT:I've read the official documentation and all they say is that I should have a error_reporting() function located at the top of your main index.php file. But I don't have index.php file in my project. My base controller is called core so to get to main index I go to www.mysite.dom/core/. So I guess this error reporting function should be inside this controller? Then what I would like to know is where should I put it in the controller and what to put inside of it to disable the reporting. Thank you all for help, guess I am missing something :/

@LINK:/questions/20759444/knitr-r-code-within-latex-environment-in-a-markdown-document
@TITLE:Knitr: R code within LaTeX environment in a Markdown document
@CONTENT:I have a document in Markdown, which incorporates R code via Knitr. For rendering equations I use LaTeX, simply writing its commands in the text. Say I have the following LaTeX code: \begin{displaymath}
\mathbf{X} = \begin{bmatrix}
2 & 12\\ 
3 & 17\\ 
5 & 10\\ 
7 & 18\\ 
9 & 13\\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{displaymath}
 Which renders me a nice mathematical matrix representation (in square brackets), when I convert everything to PDF (the full workflow is then: RMD -> knitr -> MD -> pandoc -> TeX -> pandoc -> PDF). Now, suppose we want the said matrix to be generated on-the-fly from an R object, some R matrix x. In this post we establish how to generate the required LaTeX code (the matrix2latex() function is defined there). The question now is how to get Knitr to evaluate it. I tried the following code: \begin{displaymath}
\mathbf{X} = `r matrix2latex(x)`
\end{displaymath} 
 but it simply produces blank space (NULL actually) where the R output should be. I am surprised this hasn't been asked already (at least my own search yielded nothing). Any ideas how to make this work? EDIT: As suggested, rewrote the function without cat(). Here is the working version of the function for future reference: m2l <- function(matr) {

    printmrow <- function(x) {

        ret <- paste(paste(x,collapse = " & "),"\\\\")
        sprintf(ret)
    }

    out <- apply(matr,1,printmrow)
    out2 <- paste("\\begin{bmatrix}",paste(out,collapse=' '),"\\end{bmatrix}")
    return(out2)
}
@CODE:Knitr \begin{displaymath}

@LINK:/questions/20739428/why-cannot-c-type-generic-expressions-be-compatible-with-c
@TITLE:Why cannot C type-generic expressions be compatible with C++?
@CONTENT:I seem to recall hearing vague comments from a few reliable sources (i.e. committee members speaking in non-official channels) that C type-generic expressions will not be added to C++ because they cannot be. As far as I can tell, type-generic expressions are very limited compared to C++ templates and overloading, but there is no potential for interaction that would need to be defined as a special case. A type-generic expression consists of a controlling expression, and a series of "associations" between types and subexpressions. A subexpression is chosen based on the static type of the controlling expression and the types listed for the subexpressions, and it is substituted in place of the TGE. Matching is based on the C concept of type compatibility, which as far as I can tell is equivalent to C++ identity of types with extern linkage under the one-definition rule (ODR). It would be nice if a derived class controlling expression would select a base class association in C++, but since C doesn't have inheritance, such nicety isn't needed for cross-compatibility. Is this considered to be a stumbling block anyway? Edit: As for more specific details, C11 already provides for preserving the value category (lvalue-ness) of the chosen subexpression, and seems to require that the TGE is a constant expression (of whatever category) as long as all its operands are, including the controlling expression. This is probably a C language defect. In any case, C++14 defines constant expressions in terms of what may be potentially evaluated, and the TGE spec already says that non-chosen subexpressions are unevaluated. The point is that the TGE principle of operation seems simple enough to be transplanted without ever causing trouble later. As for why C++ TGE's would be useful, aside from maximizing the intersection of C and C++, they could be used to essentially implement static_if, sans the highly controversial conditional declaration feature. I'm not a proponent of static_if, but "there is that." template< typename t >
void f( t q ) {
    auto is_big = _Generic( std::integral_constant< bool, sizeof q >= 4 >(),
        std::true_type: std::string( "whatta whopper" ),
        std::false_type: "no big deal"
    );
    auto message = _Generic( t, double: "double", int: 42, default: t );

@TITLE:Animating ng-move in AngularJS ngRepeat is animating the wrong items
@CONTENT:I'm a little flummoxed when it comes to animating ng-move in an ng-repeat. If I move an array item from 3 to 7 for instance, items 4-7 get shifted up and they animate. However the actual item I moved from 3 and placed in position 7, does not. Here's a plunkr demonstrating my issue. http://plnkr.co/edit/4yRkLWbsU57YxrYOrWUQ?p=preview Moving item 7 to 3, however, works as I expect, animating the single moved item, and not the items that have been pushed down. This is not very useful for showing a user what moved. How should someone properly animate an ng-move?

@TITLE:How is an sbt task defined using <<= different from one defined with := that references another setting's .value?
@CONTENT:I have the following example build.sbt that uses sbt-assembly. (My assembly.sbt and project/assembly.sbt are set up as described in the readme.) import AssemblyKeys._

organization := "com.example"

name := "hello-sbt"

version := "1.0"

scalaVersion := "2.10.3"

val hello = taskKey[Unit]("Prints hello")

hello := println(s"hello, ${assembly.value.getName}")

val hey = taskKey[Unit]("Prints hey")

hey <<= assembly map { (asm) => println(s"hey, ${asm.getName}") }

//val hi = taskKey[Unit]("Prints hi")

//hi <<= assembly { (asm) => println(s"hi, $asm") }
 Both hello and hey are functionally equivalent, and when I run either task from sbt, they run assembly first and print a message with the same filename. Is there a meaningful difference between the two? (It seems like the definition of hello is "slightly magical", since the dependency on assembly is only implied there, not explicit.) Lastly, I'm trying to understand why hey needs the map call. Obviously it results in a different object getting passed into asm, but I'm not quite sure how to fix this type error in the definition of hi: sbt-hello/build.sbt:21: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Unit
 required: sbt.Task[Unit]
hi <<= assembly { (asm) => println(s"hi, $asm") }
                                  ^
[error] Type error in expression
 It looks like assembly here is a [sbt.TaskKey[java.io.File]][2] but I don't see a map method defined there, so I can't quite figure out what's happening in the type of hey above.

@LINK:/questions/20578731/how-to-lazy-load-non-angular-javascript-files-using-angularjs
@TITLE:How to Lazy load non-angular JavaScript files using AngularJS?
@CONTENT:Is it possible to load plain old JS or AMD modules from an Angular Controller? I have previously used RequireJS for this. I have used AngularJS and RequireJS on a fairly large project before. I am working on a new project based on the MEAN Stack seed, and this does not use requireJS. I am not entirely clear, but Angular has a system for loading modules -- can I load a particular piece of javascript from within my angular controller? Is there a way to modify my module() declaration to include additional regular javascript files? Thanks! EDIT: To give a bit of understanding on what I am doing, I have a page that edits a few different forms. Each of these is saved into my database as a "form". Depending on the type of form, different dictionary values are mapped to different fields in different sub-views. Some of my forms have e.g dropdowns or lists of inputs. These are different, but everything else about the 'form' is handled in a generic way. So I have this singular form controller that handles a bunch of different forms, and I am very happy with the result. The main issue comes from that each form has a separate set of data I would like to avoid loading unless I need. I can check which form I am loading by checking my dropdown that drives my ng-include (which loads the subform). In the short term I have just loaded everything and created namespaces under my scope to differentiate. e.g $scope.form1 and $scope.form2 for data/rules specific to a particular form. I'd just as soon rather not load the js that I don't need. Edit 2: http://jsfiddle.net/HB7LU/1320/ function MyCtrl($scope) {       
    $scope.doSomething = function()
    {
     //I'm used to wrapping with e.g require('jquery..... here, can I do the same thing with angular?   
        alert(" I need to run a jquery function here...");
        var xml = $(someblock);
    };
}
 I've put up a fiddle with exactly what I am talking about. I want to load arbitrary JS depending on certain paths in my controller, and only when I need them. Basically I have some larger namespaces I want to load depending on one of many options selected, and it would be expensive to just load them all.
@CODE:function MyCtrl($scope) {       
    $scope.doSomething = function()
    {
     //I'm used to wrapping with e.g require('jquery..... here, can I do the same thing with angular?

@LINK:/questions/20573598/proguard-can-cause-incorrect-calculations
@TITLE:ProGuard can cause incorrect calculations
@CONTENT:I have met a pretty strange bug. The following small piece of code uses a rather simple math. protected double C_n_k(int n, int k)
{
  if(k<0 || k>n)
    return 0;
  double s=1;
  for(int i=1;i<=k;i++)
    s=s*(n+1-i)/i;
  return s;
}
 Edit Using ProGuard can make it go wrong on some devices. I have it confirmed on HTC One S Android 4.1.1 build 3.16.401.8, but judging by e-mails I got, a lot of phones with Android 4+ are affected. For some of them (Galaxy S3), american operator-branded phones are affected, while international versions are not. Many phones are not affected. Below is the code of activity which calculates C(n,k) for 1<=n<25 and 0<=k<=n. On device mentioned above the first session gives correct results, but the subsequent launches show incorrect results, each time in different positions. I have 3 questions: How can it be? Even if ProGuard made something wrong, calculations should be consistent between devices and sessions. How can we avoid it? I know substituting double by long is fine in this case, but it is not a universal method. Dropping using double or releasing not-obfuscated versions is out of question. What Android versions are affected? I was quite quick with fixing it in the game, so I just know that many players have seen it, and at least the most had Android 4.0 Overflow is out of question, because sometimes I see mistake in calculating C(3,3)=3/1*2/2*1/3. Usually incorrect numbers start somewhere in C(10,...), and look like a phone has "forgotten" to make some divisions. My SDK tools are 22.3 (the latest), and I have seen it in builds created by both Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA. Activity code: package com.karmangames.mathtest;

The closest thing that I can find is by creating an MVC 4 application and setting the Project Template as WebAPI. I followed this way and everything falls in perfectly. I have the working API with a sample controller that I can invoke by making calls from the browser. The only downside to this is that, this particular method brings in its own baggage. The MVC 4 project I created has JQUERY and other libraries included, plus some other folders that I probably don't need. What I want is the Web API structure only - and not the extra baggage. I tried finding a template using online search but the package I found does not work properly and as very poor rating. I hope I have illustrated my problem properly. I am looking forward for some feedback now :) Thanks.

@TITLE:App Terminated due to Memory Pressure when using camera in iOS 7
@CONTENT:I am facing error App Terminated due to Memory Pressure when I capture some images using UIImagePickerController Camera. I receive memory warnings first and then suddenly app crashes. This issue is in iOS 7 specifically as in iOS 6 it is working fine. Does someone know why is this memory issue occuring in iOS 7 on using camera. Note: I tried to minimize RAM usage because it may also be the reason for this memory pressure. But still getting warning.

 Parts of that are borrowed from the kivy touchtracer demo, and from this SO question. You can see I have a calculation that is correctly printing the angle between the origin of the circle and the touch event (not sure how this'll respond to multiple fingers, haven't thought that far through), but not sure how to integrate this into a "spinning" feedback event in the interface.

@LINK:/questions/20260140/how-to-detect-whether-string-substring-copies-the-character-data
@TITLE:How to detect whether String.substring copies the character data
@CONTENT:I know that for Oracle Java 1.7 update 6 and newer, when using String.substring, the internal character array of the String is copied, and for older versions, it is shared. But I found no offical API that would tell me the current behavior. Use Case My use case is: In a parser, I like to detect whether String.substring copies or shares the underlying character array. The problem is, if the character array is shared, then my parser needs to explicitly "un-share" using new String(s) to avoid memory problems. However, if String.substring anyway copies the data, then this is not necessary, and explicitly copying the data in the parser could be avoided. Use case: // possibly the query is very very large
String query = "select * from test ...";
// the identifier is used outside of the parser
String identifier = query.substring(14, 18);

// avoid if possible for speed,
// but needed if identifier internally 
// references the large query char array
identifier = new String(identifier);
 What I Need Basically, I would like to have a static method boolean isSubstringCopyingForSure() that would detect if new String(..) is not needed. I'm OK if detection doesn't work if there is a SecurityManager. Basically, the detection should be conservative (to avoid memory problems, I'd rather use new String(..) even if not necessary). Options I have a few options, but I'm not sure if they are reliable, specially for non-Oracle JVMs: Checking for the String.offset field /**
 * @return true if substring is copying, false if not or if it is not clear
 */
static boolean isSubstringCopyingForSure() {
    if (System.getSecurityManager() != null) {
        // we can not reliably check it
        return false;
    }
    try {
        for (Field f : String.class.getDeclaredFields()) {
            if ("offset".equals(f.getName())) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    } catch (Exception e) {
        // weird, we do have a security manager?
    }
    return false;
}
 Checking the JVM version static boolean isSubstringCopyingForSure() {
    // but what about non-Oracle JREs?
    return System.getProperty("java.vendor").startsWith("Oracle") &&
           System.getProperty("java.version").compareTo("1.7.0_45") >= 0;
}
 Checking the behavior There are two options, both are rather complicated. One is create a string using custom charset, then create a new string b using substring, then modify the original string and check whether b is also changed. The second options is create huge string, then a few substrings, and check the memory usage.
@CODE:String.substring String.substring new String(s) String.substring // possibly the query is very very large
String query = "select * from test ...";
// the identifier is used outside of the parser
String identifier = query.substring(14, 18);

// avoid if possible for speed,
// but needed if identifier internally 
// references the large query char array
identifier = new String(identifier); boolean isSubstringCopyingForSure() new String(..) SecurityManager new String(..) /**
 * @return true if substring is copying, false if not or if it is not clear
 */
static boolean isSubstringCopyingForSure() {
    if (System.getSecurityManager() != null) {
        // we can not reliably check it

@TITLE:How to detect if user it trying to open a link in a new tab?
@CONTENT:I'm writing a website in which all content is stored in the JavaScript environment, so it should be possible to navigate between "pages" without additional HTTP requests. I want to preserve the user's intent with respect to how links are opened, though. If a Mac user apple+clicks a link, for example, it should be opened in a new tab. But if the user wants to open a link in the current window, I want to avoid making a new HTTP request, and just use DOM manipulation to show the new content. Here's what I tried (JSFiddle): <a href="http://yahoo.com" id="mylink">Yahoo!</a>
 document.getElementById("mylink").onclick = function() {
    alert("clicked");
    return false;
}
 It behaves as desired for normal left clicks, and for context menu actions, but not for clicks with a modifier key. I could check whether certain modifier keys are held, but that seems fragile. Twitter's website has behavior similar to what I want - when you click a username, it's normally an AJAX request, but if you click with a meta key held, you get a new tab. I'd prefer a plain JavaScript solution without libraries, unless this requires a bunch of platform-specific logic. Update I took a look at GitHub's code, which also has the behavior I'm after, and it does check for certain keys being held. So I'm accepting Chris's answer , since it seems unlikely that there's a better alternative. $(document).on("click", ".js-directory-link", function (t) {
    return 2 === t.which || t.metaKey || t.ctrlKey ? void 0 : ($(this).closest("tr").addClass("is-loading"), $(document.body).addClass("disables-context-loader"))

@TITLE:UIBarButtonItem appearance trouble in iOS 7, could this be an Apple bug?
@CONTENT:I saw an article a while back, which is here: User Interface Customization in iOS 6 It shows customization for iOS 6. Since the article I have written Apps that use the technique, it is pretty straightforward, no magic in there. However, I need to update one of my apps and under iOS 7 it does not work correctly. It appears that customization of UIBarButtonItems does not work the first time the view is presented. If I dismiss the view and then present it agin everything works fine. What is seen is shown here: First time view is presented: Second time: I have seen this issue in his example, my code and a test app I wrote. The code is as follows: // Customizing the Back Bar Buttons
UIImage * btBack_30 = [[UIImage imageNamed:@"btBack_30"] resizableImageWithCapInsets:UIEdgeInsetsMake(0, 13, 0, 5)];
UIImage * btBack_24 = [[UIImage imageNamed:@"btBack_24"] resizableImageWithCapInsets:UIEdgeInsetsMake(0, 12, 0, 5)];
[[UIBarButtonItem appearance] setBackButtonBackgroundImage:btBack_30 forState:UIControlStateNormal barMetrics:UIBarMetricsDefault];
[[UIBarButtonItem appearance] setBackButtonBackgroundImage:btBack_24 forState:UIControlStateNormal barMetrics:UIBarMetricsLandscapePhone];
 As you can see there is no real magic, pretty standard, but I cannot find any reason or explanation why this does not work in iOS 7. The code gets executed in - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions. I hope someone has seen this and can offer a solution. Thanks for any help! ** Note: it was proposed that this is not an apple bug, but by design. I am not saying it IS an apple issue, it could more likely be mine, but if you run either of the sample or copy and paste the code below it is apparent that the first time it does not work correctly and subsequent times it does. That would lead me to believe that the api calls are valid, but either they have a bug, or I am missing something that needs to be done. UPDATE 4: I changed the code in MyAppDelegate's init method in my sample to the following based on the suggestion of FruityGeek, but still no luck: - (instancetype)init
{
    self = [super init];
    if (self)
    {
        //Other UIAppearance proxy calls go here

        [[UIBarButtonItem appearance] setTitleTextAttributes:
         [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:
          //[UIColor colorWithRed:220.0/255.0 green:104.0/255.0 blue:1.0/255.0 alpha:1.0],
          [UIColor colorWithRed:255.0/255.0 green:255.0/255.0 blue:255.0/255.0 alpha:1.0],
          UITextAttributeTextColor,
          //[UIColor colorWithRed:1.0 green:1.0 blue:1.0 alpha:1.0],
          [UIColor colorWithRed:0.0 green:0.0 blue:0.0 alpha:0.8],
          UITextAttributeTextShadowColor,
          [NSValue valueWithUIOffset:UIOffsetMake(0.5, 0.5)],
          UITextAttributeTextShadowOffset,
          [UIFont systemFontOfSize:12.0],
          UITextAttributeFont,
          nil]
                                                    forState:UIControlStateNormal];

        // Customizing the Back Bar Buttons
        //ios6 uses whole button background image
        UIImage * btBack_30 = [[UIImage imageNamed:@"btBack_30"] resizableImageWithCapInsets:UIEdgeInsetsMake(0, 13, 0, 5)];
        UIImage * btBack_24 = [[UIImage imageNamed:@"btBack_24"] resizableImageWithCapInsets:UIEdgeInsetsMake(0, 12, 0, 5)];
        [[UIBarButtonItem appearance] setBackButtonBackgroundImage:btBack_30 forState:UIControlStateNormal barMetrics:UIBarMetricsDefault];
        [[UIBarButtonItem appearance] setBackButtonBackgroundImage:btBack_24 forState:UIControlStateNormal barMetrics:UIBarMetricsLandscapePhone];

        if ([[UIDevice currentDevice].systemVersion integerValue] >= 7)
        {
            //ios7 needs additional chevron replacement image
            UIImage * chevronReplacement = chevronReplacement = [btBack_30 imageWithRenderingMode:UIImageRenderingModeAlwaysOriginal];
            UIImage * chevronTransitionMaskReplacement = chevronTransitionMaskReplacement = [btBack_30 imageWithRenderingMode:UIImageRenderingModeAlwaysOriginal];
            [[UINavigationBar appearance] setBackIndicatorImage:chevronReplacement];
            [[UINavigationBar appearance] setBackIndicatorTransitionMaskImage:chevronTransitionMaskReplacement];
        }
    }
    return self;
}
 UPDATE 3: I have added a dropbox link to a sample project. This is in addition to the already posted link above which is a simple app that also shows the issue. Both can be built and run in the simulator with iOS 6 and iOS 7. In the iOS 6 case everything works as expected. In iOS 7, if you click the table cell and present the next view the custom back button is not shown, if you go back and present it again the button is there. I have been fooling with this for days, so I hope someone else sees it and can tell me what I am missing. https://www.dropbox.com/s/oi1bh3emvtbmms0/NavigationBarDemo.zip This may be silly, but could it have to do with my images? I will try the sample with different images and post an update. Tried with different images and that makes no difference, also used images from the above posted sample. It was a long shot, but since no one seems to have a better idea yet it was worth a try. UPDATE 2: I have tried this in another test app and moved the code to the init meted of the app delegate and it still does not work. I have this posted here as well as the original authors site of the link at the top. Plus another forum, but no one seems to have a solution. I am wondering if this could be an Apple bug? UPDATE 1: Moved code from didFinishLaunchingWithOptions to willFinishLaunchingWithOptions and init and it still does not appear to work. ***** INIT METHOD FROM AppDelegate.m

@LINK:/questions/19986683/cross-join-between-multiple-schemas-in-mysql-privileges-and-perfomance
@TITLE:Cross join between multiple schemas in MySQL. Privileges and perfomance
@CONTENT:I'm building two applications which will share some data in common schema. I'm using MySQL as RDBMS. Here is my first schema (test_schema_1): And second (test_schema_2): I recently learned that I can do JOINs between multiple schemas. When I'm connected with root user (unlimited access to everything), I do: SELECT * FROM
TEST_SCHEMA_2.USERS U
JOIN TEST_SCHEMA_1.MASTER_USERS MU ON U.MASTER_ID = MU.ID
JOIN TEST_SCHEMA_2.ROLES R ON U.ROLE_ID = R.ID
WHERE MU.APP_ID = 'darth_vader@death.star';
 And get what I expect! This looks very cool for me, as I'm thinking of going to production with this design. But I'm a bit afraid of performance implications of such design? Is this a good idea? What if in future I decide to shard (in MongoDB terminology) the database on different machines? Also, I'm wondering of security problems. Currently, I have a separate user for each schema: Host        Db              User    Select_priv Insert_priv Update_priv Delete_priv Create_priv Drop_priv   Grant_priv  References_priv Index_priv  Alter_priv  Create_tmp_table_priv   Lock_tables_priv    Create_view_priv    Show_view_priv  Create_routine_priv Alter_routine_priv  Execute_priv    Event_priv  Trigger_priv

localhost   test_schema_2   t2      Y           Y           Y           Y           N           N           N           N               N           N           N                       N                   N                   N               N                   N                   N               N           Y
 So I expect that user t1 cannot read from test_schema_2. But the query above works. He even can inser in test_schema_2: SELECT USER();
INSERT INTO TEST_SCHEMA_2.ROLES(ID, NAME) VALUES(4, 'TEST');
...
USER()

@TITLE:Prevent select2 from flipping the dropdown upward
@CONTENT:As per title, is there a way to force select2 to always create a dropdown instead of a drop-up? There also appears to be some javascript that is either causing the flip when you scroll above the dropdown, adding a new CSS class "select2-drop-above", or both. EDIT: I should've specified that I'm pulling the library in via select2-rails. I'm hoping there is a way around this that doesn't involve pulling the whole select2 lib in myself and editing the select2.js file directly.

    margin: 0 auto;
    width: 960px;

 the box modal works. just to notice, Bootstrap defalut .modal is z-index:1050 , so I cant understand why it's not ontop of all other context. thats the box-modal:    <section id="launch" class="modal hide fade">

 thanks ahead. EDIT Solution found if anyone falls to the same problem. this is the way: add data-backdrop="false" to section or div that you contain the modal with e.g: <section id="launch" class="modal hide fade in" data-backdrop="false"> notice that it doesn't get the gray background that way, so it's kinda a dirty solution, will be happy to hear of a better one.

@LINK:/questions/19908963/strategy-design-pattern-generics-and-typesafety
@TITLE:Strategy Design Pattern, Generics and TypeSafety
@CONTENT:I want to create the following Strategy Pattern combined with Factory, but I want it to be typesafe. I have done the following till now: public interface Parser<T> {

    public Collection<T> parse(ResultSet resultSet);

}


public class AParser implements Parser<String> {

    @Override
    public Collection<String> parse(ResultSet resultSet) {
             //perform parsing, get collection
        Collection<String> cl = performParsing(resultSet); //local private method
        return cl;
    }
}

public class ParserFactory {

    public enum ParserType {
        APARSER
    }


    public static <T> Parser<T> createParser(ParserType parserType) {


        Parser<?> parser = null;
        switch (parserType) {
        case APARSER:
            parser = new AParser();
            break;
        }
            //unchecked cast happens here
        return (Parser<T>) parser;
    }
}


public class Context {

      public <T> Collection<T> getResults(String query, ParserType parserType) {
          ResultSet resultSet() = getResultSet(query); //local private method
          Parser p = ParserFactory.createParser(parserType);
          Collection<T> results = p.parse(resultSet)
      }

}
 In general whatever I attempt, somewhere I will have an unchecked cast. Anyone have an idea how I can refactor the code to be typesafe? Checking Effective Java I also stumbled upon this pattern: public final class ParserFactory {

    private ParserFactory() {

    }

    private static class AParser implements Parser<String> {
        @Override
        public Collection<String> parse(ResultSet resultSet) {
            //...
            return new ArrayList<>();
        }
    }

    public static final Parser<String> APARSER = new AParser();

}
 So now I can use as Ingo suggested public <T> Collection<T> getResults(String query, Parser<T> p)
 as getResults("query", ParserFactory.APARSER);
 Or would this be better with enums?
@CODE:public interface Parser<T> {

    public Collection<T> parse(ResultSet resultSet);

}


public class AParser implements Parser<String> {

    @Override
    public Collection<String> parse(ResultSet resultSet) {
             //perform parsing, get collection
        Collection<String> cl = performParsing(resultSet); //local private method
        return cl;
    }
}

public class ParserFactory {

    public enum ParserType {
        APARSER
    }


    public static <T> Parser<T> createParser(ParserType parserType) {


        Parser<?> parser = null;
        switch (parserType) {
        case APARSER:
            parser = new AParser();
            break;
        }
            //unchecked cast happens here
        return (Parser<T>) parser;
    }
}


public class Context {

      public <T> Collection<T> getResults(String query, ParserType parserType) {
          ResultSet resultSet() = getResultSet(query); //local private method
          Parser p = ParserFactory.createParser(parserType);
          Collection<T> results = p.parse(resultSet)
      }

} public final class ParserFactory {

    private ParserFactory() {

    }

    private static class AParser implements Parser<String> {
        @Override
        public Collection<String> parse(ResultSet resultSet) {
            //...
            return new ArrayList<>();
        }
    }

    public static final Parser<String> APARSER = new AParser();

} public <T> Collection<T> getResults(String query, Parser<T> p) getResults("query", ParserFactory.APARSER); createParser ParserType.APARSER String <T> Parser<T> createParser(ParserType<T> parserType)

@TITLE:Is there a way to show where LLVM is auto vectorising?
@CONTENT:Context: I have several loops in an Objective-C library I am writing which deal with processing large text arrays. I can see that right now it is running in a single threaded manner. I understand that LLVM is now capable of auto-vectorising loops, as described at Apple's session at WWDC. It is however very cautious in the way it does it, one reason being the possibility of variables being modified due to CPU pipelining. My question: how can I see where LLVM has vectorised my code, and, more usefully, how can I receive debug messages that explain why it can't vectorise my code? I'm sure if it can see why it can't auto-vectorise it, it could point that out to me and I could make the necessary manual adjustments to make it vectorisable. I would be remiss if I didn't point out that this question has been more or less asked already, but quite obtusely, here.

@LINK:/questions/19862485/robospice-keep-spice-service-continue-running-when-changing-activity
@TITLE:Robospice - keep spice service continue running when changing activity
@CONTENT:I used RoboSpice library to do asynchronous tasks. From their examples, the spice service is declared in BaseActivity, it starts in activity's onStart method, and stops in activity's onStop. Everything is fine, but when I want download file from internet, and then I change to another activity, this download task is cancelled, because the spice service is stopped. It looks like: public abstract class BaseActivity{
  /** The request manager. */
private SpiceManager requestManager = new SpiceManager(RequestService.class);   
  @Override
   protected void onStart() {   
      requestManager.start(this);
      super.onStart();     

   }

  @Override
  protected void onStop() {
    requestManager.shouldStop();
    super.onStop();
  }
} 
 So I wonder is there any safe way to keep the download task continue running from Spice service (this task doesn't touch UI), and another tasks work normally (mean they can be cancelled when stop activity) but it still can respect the activity life circle.
@CODE:public abstract class BaseActivity{
  /** The request manager. */
private SpiceManager requestManager = new SpiceManager(RequestService.class);   
  @Override
   protected void onStart() {   
      requestManager.start(this);
      super.onStart();     

   }

  @Override
  protected void onStop() {
    requestManager.shouldStop();
    super.onStop();
  }
}

@TITLE:In iOS 7 Safari, how do you differentiate popstate events via edge swipe vs. the back/fwd buttons?
@CONTENT:In iOS 7 Safari there are now two ways to navigate back/forward -- using the traditional back/forward button arrows at the bottom or by swiping from the edge of the screen. I'm using an animation to transition between pages in my ajax app, but I don't want to fire that transition if users are navigating via the edge swipe, because that is an animation itself. However, the popstate event objects appear to be identical for both types of navigation -- is there any way to differentiate between these two types of user navigations so we can respond accordingly? UPDATE: I was able to use (what appears to be) a bug in iOS7 Safari to detect correctly the edge swipe vs. back button tap. The bug is that the touchend event is not triggered (until the next touch event) when using the edge swipe (but touchstart and touchmove are). So I set a shouldAnimate flag and disable it on touchmove -- then if the flag is disabled and the popstate occurs, I know it's an edge swipe. It's correct 99% of the time -- the only time where it could potentially fail is when a user edge-swipes partially and but then lets go and lets the current page snap back into place (at which point my flag would still be disabled) and then taps the back button (which fires no touch events). To handle that last [edge] case I set a timer on touchmove to re-enable the flag after 50ms. Yes it's "dirty" but for now it gets me what I want in almost every case so I'm ok with it -- until Apple fixes the bug, but hopefully they'll also provide an indicator in the popstate event object that tells us what kind of navigation it is.

@TITLE:UIBarButtonItem appearance trouble in iOS 7, could this be an Apple bug?
@CONTENT:I saw an article a while back, which is here: User Interface Customization in iOS 6 It shows customization for iOS 6. Since the article I have written Apps that use the technique, it is pretty straightforward, no magic in there. However, I need to update one of my apps and under iOS 7 it does not work correctly. It appears that customization of UIBarButtonItems does not work the first time the view is presented. If I dismiss the view and then present it agin everything works fine. What is seen is shown here: First time view is presented: Second time: I have seen this issue in his example, my code and a test app I wrote. The code is as follows: // Customizing the Back Bar Buttons
UIImage * btBack_30 = [[UIImage imageNamed:@"btBack_30"] resizableImageWithCapInsets:UIEdgeInsetsMake(0, 13, 0, 5)];
UIImage * btBack_24 = [[UIImage imageNamed:@"btBack_24"] resizableImageWithCapInsets:UIEdgeInsetsMake(0, 12, 0, 5)];
[[UIBarButtonItem appearance] setBackButtonBackgroundImage:btBack_30 forState:UIControlStateNormal barMetrics:UIBarMetricsDefault];
[[UIBarButtonItem appearance] setBackButtonBackgroundImage:btBack_24 forState:UIControlStateNormal barMetrics:UIBarMetricsLandscapePhone];
 As you can see there is no real magic, pretty standard, but I cannot find any reason or explanation why this does not work in iOS 7. The code gets executed in - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions. I hope someone has seen this and can offer a solution. Thanks for any help! ** Note: it was proposed that this is not an apple bug, but by design. I am not saying it IS an apple issue, it could more likely be mine, but if you run either of the sample or copy and paste the code below it is apparent that the first time it does not work correctly and subsequent times it does. That would lead me to believe that the api calls are valid, but either they have a bug, or I am missing something that needs to be done. UPDATE 4: I changed the code in MyAppDelegate's init method in my sample to the following based on the suggestion of FruityGeek, but still no luck: - (instancetype)init
{
    self = [super init];
    if (self)
    {
        //Other UIAppearance proxy calls go here

        [[UIBarButtonItem appearance] setTitleTextAttributes:
         [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:
          //[UIColor colorWithRed:220.0/255.0 green:104.0/255.0 blue:1.0/255.0 alpha:1.0],
          [UIColor colorWithRed:255.0/255.0 green:255.0/255.0 blue:255.0/255.0 alpha:1.0],
          UITextAttributeTextColor,
          //[UIColor colorWithRed:1.0 green:1.0 blue:1.0 alpha:1.0],
          [UIColor colorWithRed:0.0 green:0.0 blue:0.0 alpha:0.8],
          UITextAttributeTextShadowColor,
          [NSValue valueWithUIOffset:UIOffsetMake(0.5, 0.5)],
          UITextAttributeTextShadowOffset,
          [UIFont systemFontOfSize:12.0],
          UITextAttributeFont,
          nil]
                                                    forState:UIControlStateNormal];

        // Customizing the Back Bar Buttons
        //ios6 uses whole button background image
        UIImage * btBack_30 = [[UIImage imageNamed:@"btBack_30"] resizableImageWithCapInsets:UIEdgeInsetsMake(0, 13, 0, 5)];
        UIImage * btBack_24 = [[UIImage imageNamed:@"btBack_24"] resizableImageWithCapInsets:UIEdgeInsetsMake(0, 12, 0, 5)];
        [[UIBarButtonItem appearance] setBackButtonBackgroundImage:btBack_30 forState:UIControlStateNormal barMetrics:UIBarMetricsDefault];
        [[UIBarButtonItem appearance] setBackButtonBackgroundImage:btBack_24 forState:UIControlStateNormal barMetrics:UIBarMetricsLandscapePhone];

        if ([[UIDevice currentDevice].systemVersion integerValue] >= 7)
        {
            //ios7 needs additional chevron replacement image
            UIImage * chevronReplacement = chevronReplacement = [btBack_30 imageWithRenderingMode:UIImageRenderingModeAlwaysOriginal];
            UIImage * chevronTransitionMaskReplacement = chevronTransitionMaskReplacement = [btBack_30 imageWithRenderingMode:UIImageRenderingModeAlwaysOriginal];
            [[UINavigationBar appearance] setBackIndicatorImage:chevronReplacement];
            [[UINavigationBar appearance] setBackIndicatorTransitionMaskImage:chevronTransitionMaskReplacement];
        }
    }
    return self;
}
 UPDATE 3: I have added a dropbox link to a sample project. This is in addition to the already posted link above which is a simple app that also shows the issue. Both can be built and run in the simulator with iOS 6 and iOS 7. In the iOS 6 case everything works as expected. In iOS 7, if you click the table cell and present the next view the custom back button is not shown, if you go back and present it again the button is there. I have been fooling with this for days, so I hope someone else sees it and can tell me what I am missing. https://www.dropbox.com/s/oi1bh3emvtbmms0/NavigationBarDemo.zip This may be silly, but could it have to do with my images? I will try the sample with different images and post an update. Tried with different images and that makes no difference, also used images from the above posted sample. It was a long shot, but since no one seems to have a better idea yet it was worth a try. UPDATE 2: I have tried this in another test app and moved the code to the init meted of the app delegate and it still does not work. I have this posted here as well as the original authors site of the link at the top. Plus another forum, but no one seems to have a solution. I am wondering if this could be an Apple bug? UPDATE 1: Moved code from didFinishLaunchingWithOptions to willFinishLaunchingWithOptions and init and it still does not appear to work. ***** INIT METHOD FROM AppDelegate.m

@LINK:/questions/19986683/cross-join-between-multiple-schemas-in-mysql-privileges-and-perfomance
@TITLE:Cross join between multiple schemas in MySQL. Privileges and perfomance
@CONTENT:I'm building two applications which will share some data in common schema. I'm using MySQL as RDBMS. Here is my first schema (test_schema_1): And second (test_schema_2): I recently learned that I can do JOINs between multiple schemas. When I'm connected with root user (unlimited access to everything), I do: SELECT * FROM
TEST_SCHEMA_2.USERS U
JOIN TEST_SCHEMA_1.MASTER_USERS MU ON U.MASTER_ID = MU.ID
JOIN TEST_SCHEMA_2.ROLES R ON U.ROLE_ID = R.ID
WHERE MU.APP_ID = 'darth_vader@death.star';
 And get what I expect! This looks very cool for me, as I'm thinking of going to production with this design. But I'm a bit afraid of performance implications of such design? Is this a good idea? What if in future I decide to shard (in MongoDB terminology) the database on different machines? Also, I'm wondering of security problems. Currently, I have a separate user for each schema: Host        Db              User    Select_priv Insert_priv Update_priv Delete_priv Create_priv Drop_priv   Grant_priv  References_priv Index_priv  Alter_priv  Create_tmp_table_priv   Lock_tables_priv    Create_view_priv    Show_view_priv  Create_routine_priv Alter_routine_priv  Execute_priv    Event_priv  Trigger_priv

localhost   test_schema_2   t2      Y           Y           Y           Y           N           N           N           N               N           N           N                       N                   N                   N               N                   N                   N               N           Y
 So I expect that user t1 cannot read from test_schema_2. But the query above works. He even can inser in test_schema_2: SELECT USER();
INSERT INTO TEST_SCHEMA_2.ROLES(ID, NAME) VALUES(4, 'TEST');
...

@TITLE:Prevent select2 from flipping the dropdown upward
@CONTENT:As per title, is there a way to force select2 to always create a dropdown instead of a drop-up? There also appears to be some javascript that is either causing the flip when you scroll above the dropdown, adding a new CSS class "select2-drop-above", or both. EDIT: I should've specified that I'm pulling the library in via select2-rails. I'm hoping there is a way around this that doesn't involve pulling the whole select2 lib in myself and editing the select2.js file directly.

@TITLE:Bootstrap modal z-index
@CONTENT:The issue is: I'm using parrallx scrolling, so I have z-index in the page now when I try to popup a box-modal by Bootstrap I get him to look like this https://www.dropbox.com/s/42tzvfppj4vh4vx/Screenshot%202013-11-11%2020.38.36.png as you can see, the box-modal isn't ontop and any mouse click disables it. if I disable this css code : #content {
    color: #003bb3;
    position: relative;
    margin: 0 auto;
    width: 960px;
    z-index: 300;
    background: url('../images/parallax-philosophy-ltl.png') top center;
}
 the box modal works. just to notice, Bootstrap defalut .modal is z-index:1050 , so I cant understand why it's not ontop of all other context. thats the box-modal:    <section id="launch" class="modal hide fade">
    <header class="modal-header">
        <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal">&times;</button>
        <h3>??? ???? ??????  </h3>

</section>
 and I trigger him from top menu:   <li><a class="launch" data-toggle="modal" href="#launch">Approve</a></li>
 thanks ahead. EDIT Solution found if anyone falls to the same problem. this is the way: add data-backdrop="false" to section or div that you contain the modal with e.g: <section id="launch" class="modal hide fade in" data-backdrop="false"> notice that it doesn't get the gray background that way, so it's kinda a dirty solution, will be happy to hear of a better one.

@LINK:/questions/19908963/strategy-design-pattern-generics-and-typesafety
@TITLE:Strategy Design Pattern, Generics and TypeSafety
@CONTENT:I want to create the following Strategy Pattern combined with Factory, but I want it to be typesafe. I have done the following till now: public interface Parser<T> {

    public Collection<T> parse(ResultSet resultSet);

}


public class AParser implements Parser<String> {

    @Override
    public Collection<String> parse(ResultSet resultSet) {
             //perform parsing, get collection
        Collection<String> cl = performParsing(resultSet); //local private method
        return cl;
    }
}

public class ParserFactory {

    public enum ParserType {
        APARSER
    }


    public static <T> Parser<T> createParser(ParserType parserType) {


        Parser<?> parser = null;
        switch (parserType) {
        case APARSER:
            parser = new AParser();
            break;
        }
            //unchecked cast happens here
        return (Parser<T>) parser;
    }
}


public class Context {

      public <T> Collection<T> getResults(String query, ParserType parserType) {
          ResultSet resultSet() = getResultSet(query); //local private method
          Parser p = ParserFactory.createParser(parserType);
          Collection<T> results = p.parse(resultSet)
      }

}
 In general whatever I attempt, somewhere I will have an unchecked cast. Anyone have an idea how I can refactor the code to be typesafe? Checking Effective Java I also stumbled upon this pattern: public final class ParserFactory {

    private ParserFactory() {

    }

    private static class AParser implements Parser<String> {
        @Override
        public Collection<String> parse(ResultSet resultSet) {
            //...
            return new ArrayList<>();
        }
    }

    public static final Parser<String> APARSER = new AParser();

}
 So now I can use as Ingo suggested public <T> Collection<T> getResults(String query, Parser<T> p)
 as getResults("query", ParserFactory.APARSER);
 Or would this be better with enums?
@CODE:public interface Parser<T> {

    public Collection<T> parse(ResultSet resultSet);

}


public class AParser implements Parser<String> {

    @Override
    public Collection<String> parse(ResultSet resultSet) {
             //perform parsing, get collection
        Collection<String> cl = performParsing(resultSet); //local private method
        return cl;
    }
}

public class ParserFactory {

    public enum ParserType {
        APARSER
    }


    public static <T> Parser<T> createParser(ParserType parserType) {


        Parser<?> parser = null;
        switch (parserType) {
        case APARSER:
            parser = new AParser();
            break;
        }
            //unchecked cast happens here
        return (Parser<T>) parser;
    }
}


public class Context {

      public <T> Collection<T> getResults(String query, ParserType parserType) {
          ResultSet resultSet() = getResultSet(query); //local private method
          Parser p = ParserFactory.createParser(parserType);
          Collection<T> results = p.parse(resultSet)
      }

} public final class ParserFactory {

    private ParserFactory() {

    }

    private static class AParser implements Parser<String> {
        @Override
        public Collection<String> parse(ResultSet resultSet) {
            //...
            return new ArrayList<>();
        }
    }

    public static final Parser<String> APARSER = new AParser();

} public <T> Collection<T> getResults(String query, Parser<T> p) getResults("query", ParserFactory.APARSER); createParser ParserType.APARSER String <T> Parser<T> createParser(ParserType<T> parserType)

@CONTENT:Context: I have several loops in an Objective-C library I am writing which deal with processing large text arrays. I can see that right now it is running in a single threaded manner. I understand that LLVM is now capable of auto-vectorising loops, as described at Apple's session at WWDC. It is however very cautious in the way it does it, one reason being the possibility of variables being modified due to CPU pipelining. My question: how can I see where LLVM has vectorised my code, and, more usefully, how can I receive debug messages that explain why it can't vectorise my code? I'm sure if it can see why it can't auto-vectorise it, it could point that out to me and I could make the necessary manual adjustments to make it vectorisable. I would be remiss if I didn't point out that this question has been more or less asked already, but quite obtusely, here.

@TITLE:Robospice - keep spice service continue running when changing activity
@CONTENT:I used RoboSpice library to do asynchronous tasks. From their examples, the spice service is declared in BaseActivity, it starts in activity's onStart method, and stops in activity's onStop. Everything is fine, but when I want download file from internet, and then I change to another activity, this download task is cancelled, because the spice service is stopped. It looks like: public abstract class BaseActivity{
  /** The request manager. */
private SpiceManager requestManager = new SpiceManager(RequestService.class);   
  @Override
   protected void onStart() {   
      requestManager.start(this);
      super.onStart();     

   }

  @Override
  protected void onStop() {
    requestManager.shouldStop();
    super.onStop();
  }
} 
 So I wonder is there any safe way to keep the download task continue running from Spice service (this task doesn't touch UI), and another tasks work normally (mean they can be cancelled when stop activity) but it still can respect the activity life circle.
@CODE:public abstract class BaseActivity{
  /** The request manager. */
private SpiceManager requestManager = new SpiceManager(RequestService.class);   
  @Override
   protected void onStart() {   
      requestManager.start(this);
      super.onStart();     

   }

  @Override
  protected void onStop() {
    requestManager.shouldStop();
    super.onStop();
  }
}

@TITLE:In iOS 7 Safari, how do you differentiate popstate events via edge swipe vs. the back/fwd buttons?
@CONTENT:In iOS 7 Safari there are now two ways to navigate back/forward -- using the traditional back/forward button arrows at the bottom or by swiping from the edge of the screen. I'm using an animation to transition between pages in my ajax app, but I don't want to fire that transition if users are navigating via the edge swipe, because that is an animation itself. However, the popstate event objects appear to be identical for both types of navigation -- is there any way to differentiate between these two types of user navigations so we can respond accordingly? UPDATE: I was able to use (what appears to be) a bug in iOS7 Safari to detect correctly the edge swipe vs. back button tap. The bug is that the touchend event is not triggered (until the next touch event) when using the edge swipe (but touchstart and touchmove are). So I set a shouldAnimate flag and disable it on touchmove -- then if the flag is disabled and the popstate occurs, I know it's an edge swipe. It's correct 99% of the time -- the only time where it could potentially fail is when a user edge-swipes partially and but then lets go and lets the current page snap back into place (at which point my flag would still be disabled) and then taps the back button (which fires no touch events). To handle that last [edge] case I set a timer on touchmove to re-enable the flag after 50ms. Yes it's "dirty" but for now it gets me what I want in almost every case so I'm ok with it -- until Apple fixes the bug, but hopefully they'll also provide an indicator in the popstate event object that tells us what kind of navigation it is.

@TITLE:Why does AngularJS not recommend using XML namespaces?
@CONTENT:AngularJS directives have ng- prefixed to them. Why does it insist on making use of a prefix instead of using an actual xml namespace? From AngularJS's documentation: If you choose to use the old style directive syntax ng: then include xml-namespace in html to make IE happy. (This is here for historical reasons, and we no longer recommend use of ng:.) Using something like this does seem to work: <html xmlns:ng="http://angularjs.org" ng:app="my-app">
 as is evident from this jsFiddle. But it does not recommend using it and supports it just for historical reasons. Can someone point me to what those reasons might be? Coming from a Flex background, I think XML namespaces are great and I would love to make use of them, but perhaps there is are strong reasons for Angular to go with the prefix approach?

The particles can be considered generally distributed randomly over the entire space, but in theory there should be some areas that have a higher density. For example, 100 particles are placed randomly in a 2D grid that is 500x500, and I need to find the 50x50 region with the most particles (highest density). Is there some other way to calculate the best region besides brute force testing every possible region (in this case about over 200000 regions)? That would scale up at O(n^2) for an n-length axis.

@TITLE:AppCompat Actionbar styling
@CONTENT:I'm currently trying to use AppCompat instead of ActionbarSherlock. On Android 4+ devices I don't run into any problems, as the normal Actionbar and Holo theme are used. On lower Android versions however, this weird look happens when using Theme.AppCompat.Light. The Actionbar is white and has a blue line underneath. I was able to fix that by using the Android Action Bar Style Generator from Android Asset Studio to generate a custom theme with a solid Actionbar instead of the transparent one. When comparing it to the Actionbar I got when using ActionbarSherlock, it's still kind of ugly though. The AppCompat Actionbar has this very sharp, black line between itself and the content of the activity, while the stock Actionbar of ICS or the one of ActionbarSherlock have a softer transition from the Actionbar to the layout. How can I style the Actionbar to really look like the one on Android 4+?

You now have the old version of the app To get the new version: Go to appstore. Find SocialPar. Click to install the app. Wait in the appstore for the install to complete, Click open It will prompt for passwords to itunes account It will install again Click open again You now have the proper version of the app. I am wasting a lot of money promoting my app right now and its killing me that my marketing efforts are driving people to install an old version of my app. Can anyone reproduce this with their apps?

@TITLE:Crash if backgrounding cocos2d 2.1 app in iOS7 while watching Game Center screens (leaderboard, achievement)
@CONTENT:I have a 100% reproducible crash here. Crash if backgrounding cocos2d 2.1 app in iOS7 while watching Game Center screens (leaderboard, achievement). It crashes instantly when pushing the home button. Crash on line 275 in CCGLView.m: if(![_context presentRenderbuffer:GL_RENDERBUFFER])
 The itching thing is, I downloaded a fresh copy of official cocos2diphone 2.1 the other second, installed its templates and ran the staple application after hooking it up to the same app id as my problematic app that already have game center leaderboards etc set up. It does not crash. So I ran a diff on the cocos2d folders inside lib, and there is no difference except I added some C functions code in CCDrawingPrimitives.h/m... Should not be the problem. So the problem should not be in cocos2d itself but somehow the use of it or my project setup causes it. Update: The problem seems to be in the cocos2d app template in use in 2.1 and possibly earlier. It looks like this: -(void) applicationDidEnterBackground:(UIApplication*)application
{
    if( [navController_ visibleViewController] == director_ )
        [director_ stopAnimation];
}
 And the obvious fault here is that if you have navController open a Game Center controller, then when pushing the home button the visibleViewController of director_ will be the GC controller, hence the stopAnimation will not get called. This results in a crash with iOS7, but doesn't seem to with iOS6... nor the template cocos2d 2.1 app (still confused here). The current fix is to comment out if( [navController_ visibleViewController] == director_ ) in order to have stopAnimation always called. Not sure if there are any side effects with that but will go with this for now.
@CODE:if(![_context presentRenderbuffer:GL_RENDERBUFFER]) -(void) applicationDidEnterBackground:(UIApplication*)application
{
    if( [navController_ visibleViewController] == director_ )
        [director_ stopAnimation];

@CONTENT:I want my search bar to draw its background extended upwards below the status bar like this: This is the corresponding code for the image above: - (void)viewDidLoad
{
    [super viewDidLoad];

    self.searchBar = [[UISearchBar alloc] init];
    self.searchBar.delegate = self;
    [self.view addSubview:self.searchBar];

    self.searchBar.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = NO;

}

- (UIBarPosition)positionForBar:(id <UIBarPositioning>)bar
{
    return UIBarPositionTopAttached;
}
 The problem arises when I add the search bar to a UISearchDisplayController by appending the following line at the end of the viewDidLoad method: self.mySearchDisplayController = [[UISearchDisplayController alloc] initWithSearchBar:self.searchBar contentsController:self];
 This is the result I get: Note that the image looks clipped. This is different from what it looks like if I change UIBarPositionTopAttached to UIBarPositionTop in the code: The image being clipped made me think of clipsToBounds and I could get the search bar to display properly by adding this piece of code at the end of viewDidLoad: for (UIView *subview in self.searchBar.subviews) {
    subview.clipsToBounds = NO;
}
 So I guess the UISearchDisplayController is messing with the clipsToBounds property of the UISearchBar background view. Has anyone else struggled with this? Is there a problem with my code? Update: Back in October 2013, besides posting this question, I also reported this using the Apple Bug Reporter tool. On January 6, 2015 (waaaay too late) I got a reply from Apple Developer Relations: There are no plans to address this based on the following: UISearchDisplayController is no longer supported.

@CONTENT:This is what it looks like with iOS7 simulator when application is just running without any user interaction(also I'm not running any code of mine, only boilerplate Cocos2D): No such issue with 5.0->6.1. The code producing this problem is Cocos2D boilerplate code which I tried to minimize with commenting and this is the minimum code from App delegate:     - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions

                            preserveBackbuffer:NO
                                    sharegroup:nil
                                 multiSampling:NO
                               numberOfSamples:0];

    [director_ setView:glView];

    [glView setMultipleTouchEnabled:YES];

    [director_ setProjection:kCCDirectorProjection2D];
    //  [director setProjection:kCCDirectorProjection3D];

}
 I also commented out CCDirector from directorDidReshapeProjection startup to eliminate my own code. So when application launches now I only see frame rate on black screen. The same result I see from Instruments. Unfortunately can't test iOS 7 on device, but I don't expect simulator to act like that. Update: I made 2 Mark Generations with the following result. All items are those 64 byte allocations. I have no clue what type they are. Worth to mention that I'm using latest stable Cocos2D 2.1. Update #2: Call stack of 64 byte allocation.

 The UICollectionViewCells in the app share a common superclass that manages highlighting. When the cell is highlighted the alpha changes. - (void)setHighlighted:(BOOL)highlighted {
    [super setHighlighted:highlighted];

    if (highlighted) {
        self.alpha = 0.8;
    } else {
        self.alpha = 1.0;
    }
}
 Could calling [super setHighlighted:highlighted] cause a crash like this? The app was compiled and submitted with XCode 4 and is only happening on iOS 7. Any other suggestions to figure out where this is happening. Thanks for your help. Edit: I was able to catch this in the debugger, but it still is not consistently reproducible. The crash is: [NSIndexPath section] message sent to deallocated instance XXXXXXXX

@TITLE:Prevent touch events on subviews of scrolling UIScrollView in iOS7
@CONTENT:I have a UIControl inside a UIScrollView. In my UIControl's init, I rig up some touch event handlers, e.g. [self addTarget:_delegate
         action:@selector(touchedDown) forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchDown];
 iOS6 and iOS7 behave differently when I do the following: Swipe the UIScrollView to start scrolling Tap the UIScrollView to stop scrolling In iOS6, my app continues to behave as intended: the tap at step #2 does not call touchedDown -- the UIScrollView swallows the touch event as it immediately stops scrolling. But in iOS7, the UIScrollView stops scrolling as expected, while touchedDown is still called. Was there a documented API change? I'd like my app to behave identically to iOS6 in iOS7.

@TITLE:exclude @Component from @ComponentScan
@CONTENT:I'm a Spring newbie, so please excuse me if the question appears nonsensical. I have a component that I want to exclude from a @ComponentScan in a particular @Configuration: @Component("foo") class Foo {
...
}
 Otherwise, it seems to clash with some other class in my project. I don't fully understand the collision, but if I comment out the @Component annotation, things work like I want them to. But other projects that rely on this library expect this class to be managed by Spring, so I want to skip it only in my project. I tried using @ComponentScan.Filter: @Configuration @EnableSpringConfigured
@ComponentScan(basePackages = {"com.example"}, excludeFilters={
  @ComponentScan.Filter(type=FilterType.ASSIGNABLE_TYPE, value=Foo.class)})
public class MySpringConfiguration {}
 but it doesn't appear to work. If I try using FilterType.ASSIGNABLE_TYPE, I get a strange error about being unable to load some seemingly random class: Caused by: java.io.FileNotFoundException: class path resource [junit/framework/TestCase.class] cannot be opened because it does not exist I also tried using type=FilterType.CUSTOM as following: class ExcludeFooFilter implements TypeFilter {
    @Override
    public boolean match(MetadataReader metadataReader,
            MetadataReaderFactory metadataReaderFactory) throws IOException {
        return metadataReader.getClass() == Foo.class;
    }
}

@Configuration @EnableSpringConfigured
@ComponentScan(basePackages = {"com.example"}, excludeFilters={
  @ComponentScan.Filter(type=FilterType.ASSIGNABLE_TYPE, value=Foo.class)})
public class MySpringConfiguration {}
 But that doesn't seem to exclude the component from the scan like I want. How do I exclude it?
@CODE:@Component("foo") class Foo {
...
} @ComponentScan.Filter @Configuration @EnableSpringConfigured
@ComponentScan(basePackages = {"com.example"}, excludeFilters={
  @ComponentScan.Filter(type=FilterType.ASSIGNABLE_TYPE, value=Foo.class)})

We don't 'build' in eclipse, per-se. Instead when necessary we just either refresh the projects or restart the tomcat server--usually though, we can just make changes and reload the browser. To be clear, the app is single-page-architecture built on java/mysql, with a dojo javascript framework on the front end. Suggestions?

@LINK:/questions/18978536/poor-performance-of-django-orm-with-oracle
@TITLE:Poor performance of Django ORM with Oracle
@CONTENT:I am building a Django website with an Oracle backend, and I observe very slow performance even when doing simple lookups on the primary key. The same code works very fast when the same data are loaded in MySQL. What could be the reason for the poor performance? I have a suspicion that the problem is related to the use of Oracle bind parameters, but this may not be the case. Django model (a test table with ~6,200,000 rows) from django.db import models

class Mytable(models.Model):
    upi = models.CharField(primary_key=True, max_length=13)

    class Meta:
        db_table = 'mytable'
 Django ORM (takes ~ 1s) from myapp.models import *
r = Mytable.objects.get(upi='xxxxxxxxxxxxx')
 Raw query with bind parameters (takes ~ 1s) cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE upi = %s", ['xxxxxxxxxxxxx'])
row = cursor.fetchone()
print row
 Raw query with no bind parameters (instantaneous) cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE upi = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxx'")
row = cursor.fetchone()
print row
 My environment Python 2.6.6 Django 1.5.4 cx-Oracle 5.1.2 Oracle 11g When connecting to the Oracle database I specify: 'OPTIONS': {
    'threaded': True,
}
 Any help will be greatly appreciated. [Update] I did some further testing using the debugsqlshell tool from the Django debug toolbar. # takes ~1s
>>>Mytable.objects.get(upi='xxxxxxxxxxxxx')
SELECT "Mytable"."UPI"
FROM "Mytable"
WHERE "Mytable"."UPI" = :arg0  [2.70ms]
 This suggests that Django uses the Oracle bind parameters, and the query itself is very fast, but creating the corresponding Python object takes a very long time. Just to confirm, I ran the same query using cx_Oracle (note that the cursor in my original question is the Django cursor). import cx_Oracle
db= cx_Oracle.connect('connection_string')
cursor = db.cursor()

# instantaneous
cursor.execute('SELECT * from mytable where upi = :upi', {'upi':'xxxxxxxxxxxxx'})
cursor.fetchall()
 What could be slowing down Django ORM? [Update 2] We looked at the database performance from the Oracle side, and it turns out that the index is not used when the query comes from Django. Any ideas why this might be the case?
@CODE:from django.db import models

class Mytable(models.Model):
    upi = models.CharField(primary_key=True, max_length=13)

    class Meta:
        db_table = 'mytable' from myapp.models import *
r = Mytable.objects.get(upi='xxxxxxxxxxxxx') cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE upi = %s", ['xxxxxxxxxxxxx'])
row = cursor.fetchone()

I have several such calculations to make on each single column so solutions like this won't help. Example: On column B, I have several dynamic ranges which has to be summed. B1..B9 should be summed on B10, and B11..B19 should be summed on B20. I have tens such calculations to make. Every now and then, I add rows below the last summed row , and I want them to be added to the sum. I add a new row (call it 9.1) before row 10, and a new raw (let's call it 19.1) before row 20. I want B10 to contain the sum of B1 through B9.1 and B20 to contain the sum of B11:B19.1. On excel, I have the offset function which does it like charm. But how to do it with google spreadsheet? I tried to use formulas like this: =SUM(B1:INDIRECT(address(row()-1,column(),false)))   # Formula on B10
=SUM(B11:INDIRECT(address(row()-1,column(),false)))  # Formula on B20

@CONTENT:I am working on developing a REST API using ExpressJS, NodeJS, Mongoose and Mocha. The thing is that I have an app.coffee file, thats responsible for setting up ExpressJS and connecting to Mongoose. The way I have set this up is that Mongoose is connected first and if that gets through, then, the ExpressJS App is started. The issue is that when setting up Mocha, I need to make sure that ExpressJS App existing in app.coffee is completely started successfully including all asynchronous code before any testcase is executed. For that, I have created a test_helper.coffee and placed the following code in it, but, the testcases start their execution even if the code in app.coffee hasn't completed its execution completely which actually makes sense: before (done) ->
  require(__dirname + '/../src/app')
  done()
 In a nutshell, I want to make sure that the ExpressJS app has fully completed its setup before any testcase is executed. How I can do that?

@TITLE:CAShapeLayer animation (arc from 0 to final size)
@CONTENT:I have a CAShapeLayer in which an arc is added using UIBezierPath. I saw a couple of posts (one actually) here on stackoverflow but none seemed to give me the answer. As said in the title I would like to animate an arc (yes it will be for a pie chart). How can one accomplish an animation from an "empty" arc to the fully extended one? Kinda like a curved progress bar. Is it really impossible to do it via CoreAnimation? Here's how I "do" the arc. Oh and ignore the comments and calculation since I'm used to counter clockwise unit circle and apple goes clockwise. The arcs appear just fine, I only need animation:     //Apple's unit circle goes in clockwise rotation while im used to counter clockwise that's why my angles are mirrored along x-axis
    workAngle = 6.283185307 - DEGREES_TO_RADIANS(360 * item.value / total);

    //My unit circle, that's why negative currentAngle
    [path moveToPoint:CGPointMake(center.x + cosf(outerPaddingAngle - currentAngle) * (bounds.size.width / 2), center.y - (sinf(outerPaddingAngle - currentAngle) * (bounds.size.height / 2)))];

    //Apple's unit circle, clockwise rotation, we add the angles
    [path addArcWithCenter:center radius:120 startAngle:currentAngle endAngle:currentAngle + workAngle clockwise:NO];

    //My unit circle, counter clockwise rotation, we subtract the angles
    [path addLineToPoint:CGPointMake(center.x + cosf(-currentAngle - workAngle) * ((bounds.size.width / 2) - pieWidth), center.y - sinf(-currentAngle - workAngle) * ((bounds.size.height / 2) - pieWidth))];

    //Apple's unit circle, clockwise rotation, addition of angles
    [path addArcWithCenter:center radius:120 - pieWidth startAngle:currentAngle + workAngle endAngle:currentAngle - innerPaddingAngle clockwise:YES];

 ---------- UPDATE 1 ------------------ I have tested it on another bit of code:     (function () {
        $scroller = $('.scroller'),

        // Take a picture using the camera or select one from the library
        takePicture = function (e) {
            var options = {
                quality: 45,
                targetWidth: 1000,
                targetHeight: 1000,
                destinationType: Camera.DestinationType.FILE_URI,
                encodingType: Camera.EncodingType.JPEG,
                sourceType: Camera.PictureSourceType.CAMERA
            };

            navigator.camera.getPicture(
                function (imageURI) {
                    console.log(imageURI);
                    alert('test');
                    $scroller.append('<img src="' + imageURI + '"/>');
                },
                function (message) {
                    // We typically get here because the use canceled the photo operation. Fail silently.
                }, options);

            return false;

        };

    $('.camera-btn').on('click', takePicture);

}());
 And this has the same effect. It does nothing during the first snap but it shows the picture after the second snap. I also just found out that the picture that shows after the second is snap is the first photo that I took. It seems that the first argument in getPicture does not trigger on the first snap. This is frustrating as logcat does not really show me anything to work with. ---------------- UPDATE 2 ---------------- I just tried it on Phonegap Build and it works. So it must have something to do with the plugin...

@TITLE:An Errors/BindingResult argument is expected to be declared immediately after the model attribute, the @RequestBody or the @RequestPart arguments
@CONTENT:I am teaching myself Spring by dissecting example applications and then adding code here and there to test theories that I develop during the dissection. I am getting the following error message when testing some code that I added to a Spring application: An Errors/BindingResult argument is expected to be declared immediately after the  
model attribute, the @RequestBody or the @RequestPart arguments to which they apply  
 The method to which the error message refers is: @RequestMapping(value = "/catowners", method = RequestMethod.GET)
public String findOwnersOfPetType(Integer typeID, BindingResult result, Map<String, Object> model) {
    // find owners of a specific type of pet
    typeID = 1;//this is just a placeholder
    Collection<Owner> results = this.clinicService.findOwnerByPetType(typeID);
    model.put("selections", results);
    return "owners/catowners";
}  
 This error message was triggered when I tried to load the /catowners url pattern in the web browser. I have reviewed this page and this posting, but the explanation does not seem clear. Can anyone show me how to fix this error, and also explain what it means? EDIT: Based on Biju Kunjummen's response, I changed the syntax to the following: @RequestMapping(value = "/catowners", method = RequestMethod.GET)
public String findOwnersOfPetType(@Valid Integer typeID, BindingResult result, Map<String, Object> model)  
 I am still getting the same error message. Is ther something I am not understanding? SECOND EDIT: Based on Sotirios's comment, I changed the code to the following: @RequestMapping(value = "/catowners", method = RequestMethod.GET)
public String findOwnersOfPetType(BindingResult result, Map<String, Object> model) {
    // find owners of a specific type of pet
    Integer typeID = 1;//this is just a placeholder
    Collection<Owner> results = this.clinicService.findOwnerByPetType(typeID);
    model.put("selections", results);
    return "owners/catowners";
 }
 I am still getting the same error message after telling eclipse to run as...run on server again. Is there something that I am not understanding?

@TITLE:STL/Boost equivalent of LLVM SmallVector?
@CONTENT:I have been trying to see if I can optimize the case when having many small vectors of data. In my use case there may be 100,000+ of these vectors so the size of the vector storage is critical. Each may only have 1 or 2 elements at times but may grow larger capacities in many cases. I have tried using a simple std::vector but this is incredibly slow as it allocates N small buffers on the heap which wastes memory and takes far too long in a time-critical environment. Effectively a small-buffer-optimization (SBO) on a vector seems to look like a viable solution. This means the internal (i.e. stack) data of the vector is used until it is exceeded and only then does the heap need to be used. I have stumbled upon the LLVM SmallVector which appears to do exactly that. It however appears to have lots of dependencies within the LLVM framework and was wondering if there is something similar in Boost? There may be a possibility SBO optimization is performed by the Boost implementation but I cannot find any references to this in my searches. I have seen that the STL implementation is technically prohibited form doing this optimization though due to some rule about iterators though?

 And inside my toy consumer: import kafka.consumer.KafkaStream;
import kafka.consumer.ConsumerIterator;

public class Consumer implements Runnable {

    private KafkaStream kafkaStream;
    private Integer threadNumber;

    public Consumer(KafkaStream kafkaStream, Integer threadNumber) {
        this.threadNumber = threadNumber;
        this.kafkaStream = kafkaStream;
    }

    public void run() {
        ConsumerIterator<byte[], byte[]> it = kafkaStream.iterator();
        System.out.println("Created iterator " + it.toString() + " thread number " + threadNumber);
        while(true) {

            try {
                Thread.sleep(1000);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                break;
            }

            while(it.hasNext()) {
                System.out.println("Thread " + threadNumber + ": " + new String(it.next().message()));
            }
        }
        System.out.println("Shutting down Thread: " + threadNumber);
    }
}
 The problem is, the pool of workers does not pick up messages: Created iterator empty iterator thread number 3
Created iterator empty iterator thread number 6
Created iterator empty iterator thread number 9
Created iterator empty iterator thread number 7
Created iterator empty iterator thread number 0
Created iterator empty iterator thread number 0
Created iterator empty iterator thread number 8
Created iterator empty iterator thread number 3
etc...
 When I add messages via the produce command line, the messages are printed under the single threaded worker version, but messages are not printed under the multi-stream situation. Whats going on here? How can I fix this? Btw, the pom.xml for kafka 0.8 is not a valid pom and will not acquire dependencies, so here is a pom with complete dependencies. <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

@TITLE:What is the best way to escape HTML on ExtJS application generally?
@CONTENT:I am developing a web application using ExtJS to build GUI and communicate with server via RESTful web-service (the returned data is formatted as JSON objects). Now I am having problems when processing with data which contains HTML tags, Javascript codes inside; because when I set those values to Ext forms, labels, input fields, they are affected by those syntaxes. I used this function to load data from model object to form: form.loadRecord(model);
 I have found a solution to escape HTML and JS: using field.setValue(Ext.util.Format.htmlDecode(data)); 
 but I think that is not a good solution for whole application, because the developers must do so much things: review all input fields, labels, and put that snippet to them. And after all, that is not a beautiful way to build a fast, robust and maintainable application. So, could you please help me solution so that it can be modified at one place, and affects to the rest. Can I override the setValue/ setLabel of AbstractComponent? Or should I encode the data before rendering them? And how to decode those data? (P/S: I uses Grails framework on the server-side) Thank you so much.

@TITLE:C# Multiple Inheritance
@CONTENT:Currently im studying the C# with ASP.NET MVC 4 with Code First Approach. Im Visual Basic Developer, and Now i want to Start C#. And, now i came accross the situation where i've to manage Multiple Inheritance. But, it is not possible with Class i thought. So, how should i manage these classes i have : //I have the Following Person Class which Hold Common Properties 
//and a Type of Person e.g : Student, Faculty, Administrative
public class Person
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }
    public string Type { get; set; }
}


//This is my Student Class, which is Derived from Person
public class Student:Person
{
    public DateTime DateOfBirth { get; set; }
    public DateTime EnrollmentDate { get; set; }
    public string Remarks { get; set; }


    public bool Approved { get; set; }
    public DateTime ApprovedDate { get; set; }
    public int ApprovedUserId { get; set; }
}


//This is my Faculty Class, which is also Derived from Person
public class Faculty : Person
{
    public DateTime HiredDate { get; set; }


    public bool Approved { get; set; }
    public DateTime ApprovedDate { get; set; }
    public int ApprovedUserId { get; set; }
}
 What I want to Make is Approved, ApprovedDate, and ApprovedUserId also common. I want to Specify those Properties like :  public class Approve {
    public bool Approved { get; set; }
    public DateTime ApprovedDate { get; set; }
    public int ApprovedUserId { get; set; }
}
 And, want to use like : public class Student:Person,Approve
{
    public DateTime DateOfBirth { get; set; }
    public DateTime EnrollmentDate { get; set; }
    public string Remarks { get; set; }
}
 And, i cannot put those things inside PERSON. Because, i've to use this to another classes to, but those are not Person. Then, how do i achieve this... Please give me an Example for the Above Situation. Please Help. And, Thank You so much in Advance.

 i saw other way of submitting jobs like this Configuration conf = getConf();
Job job = new Job(conf, "secondary sort");
job.waitForCompletion(true);     
return 0;
 and how can i specify the sortcomparator class for the job using jobconf? can any one explain me this concept?

@LINK:/questions/18367839/alternative-to-concurrentdictionary-for-portable-class-library
@TITLE:Alternative to ConcurrentDictionary for portable class library
@CONTENT:I'm writing a portable class library that targets .NET 4.5, Windows Store apps and Windows Phone 8. I need an efficient in-memory cache mechanism, so I was thinking about using ConcurrentDictionary<K,V>, but it's not available in WP8. There will be many reads and relatively few writes, so ideally I'd like a collection that supports lock-free reads from multiple threads, and write by a single thread. The non-generic Hashtable has that property, according to MSDN, but unfortunately it's not available in the PCL... Is there another collection class available in the PCL that matches this requirement? If not, what would be a good way to achieve thread safety without locking for reads? (locking for writes is OK, since it won't happen too often) EDIT: thanks to JaredPar's guidance, I eventually implemented my cache in a completely lock-free fashion, using ImmutableDictionary<TKey, TValue> from Microsoft.Bcl.Immutable: class Cache<TKey, TValue>
{
    private IImmutableDictionary<TKey, TValue> _cache = ImmutableDictionary.Create<TKey, TValue>();

    public TValue GetOrAdd(TKey key, [NotNull] Func<TKey, TValue> valueFactory)
    {
        valueFactory.CheckArgumentNull("valueFactory");

        TValue newValue = default(TValue);
        bool newValueCreated = false;
        while (true)

@LINK:/questions/18348969/android-mk-build-all-source-file-in-a-directory
@TITLE:Android.mk - build all source file in a directory
@CONTENT:I am using Android NDK to build my cocos2dx project, within the Android.mk, there is a definition for LOCAL_SRC_FILES where each of the cpp file are listed. Whenever I added a new source file, I'd need to add it there as well... it looks like this: LOCAL_SRC_FILES := hellocpp/main.cpp \
                   hellocpp/myclass.cpp \
                   hellocpp/mynextclass.cpp \
                   ../../Classes/Screens/LaunchScreen.cpp \
 the header file, however, can specify the entire directory to include, it looks like this: LOCAL_C_INCLUDES := $(LOCAL_PATH)/hellocpp
LOCAL_C_INCLUDES += $(LOCAL_PATH)/../../Classes/Screens
 I have tried various ways to include the whole directory instead of single file for the LOCAL_SRC_FILES so that I don't need to modify the Android.mk build script whenever I add a new file, however, so far all my attempts failed. I have tried this: #SRC_PATH_HELLOCPP := $(wildcard hellocpp/*.cpp)
#SRC_PATH_CLASSES += $(wildcard ../../Classes/*.cpp)

#LOCAL_SRC_FILES := $(SRC_PATH_HELLOCPP:$(LOCAL_PATH/%=%)
#LOCAL_SRC_FILES += $(SRC_PATH_CLASSES:$(LOCAL_PATH/%=%)
 as well as this: #LOCAL_SRC_FILES += hellocpp/*.cpp
#LOCAL_SRC_FILES += ../../Classes/*.cpp
 both are not working... I have another project that works well with the first option though, I really do not understand why it doesn't work in the cocos2dx project... does anybody know why or know the solution? Or maybe I should just leave it as is and take the trouble, since everybody is doing that., but it is really troublesome, hope somebody can help so that all of us can be more productive.. Thanks!

@TITLE:Overloading a private method in PHP
@CONTENT:I know I cannot overload methods in PHP. And, as far as I know, private methods in a class are invisible to classes that extend the base class. So why this does not work? class Base {
  private function foo($arg) {
     print "Base $arg";
  }
}

class Child extends Base {
  public function foo() {
     print "Child";
  }
}

$c = new Child;
print $c->foo();
 The error: PHP Strict Standards: Declaration of Child::foo() should be compatible with Base::foo($arg) in /var/www/boludo.php on line 17 I assumed that foo($arg) method is invisible in Child class because is private. So, I'm not overloading foo, I'm just creating a method called foo.
@CODE:private class Base {
  private function foo($arg) {
     print "Base $arg";
  }
}

class Child extends Base {
  public function foo() {
     print "Child";
  }

@TITLE:Retrieve a managed bean from a JerseyTest container with jersey-spring3
@CONTENT:This question is a follow on from a previous question Specify Custom Application Context. We are migrating some of our data services from Jersey 1.x using jersey-spring to Jersey 2.x using jersey-spring3. We have a few test classes that inherit from JerseyTest. Some of these classes use custom applicationContext.xml files that are not specified in the web.xml file. For object mocking purposes we would mock out some components in our Jersey Resources. In Jersey 1.x we could mock objects in the application context file by <bean id="mockBean" class="org.easymock.EasyMock" 
    factory-method="createStrictMock" autowire="byName">
    <constructor-arg index="0" value="com.xxx.xxx.ClassToMock" /> 
</bean>
 and retrieve these mocked instances as follows ClassToMock obj = (ClassToMock)ContextLoader
    .getCurrentWebApplicationContext()
    .getAutowireCapableBeanFactory()
    .getBean("mockBean");
 How can the same be achieved with Jersey 2.x using jersey-spring3? I have combed through the API docs, user guides and some of the sources but was unable to find an answer. Thank you. EDIT: We will be using the mocked beans inside of our JAX-RS resources. We have service interfaces that are @Autowired into our resources. e.g. @Path(ProductResource.RESOURCE_PATH)
@Component
@Scope("prototype")
public class ProductResource 
extends GenericResource<Product, BaseModel> {

    /*
     * Members
     */

    public static final String RESOURCE_PATH = "product/";

    @Autowired
    protected ProductService productService;

    ...
 We want to mock out the and set the expectations on these services. e.g. <bean id="productService" class="org.easymock.EasyMock" 
    factory-method="createStrictMock">
    <constructor-arg index="0" 
        value="com.xxx.xxx.service.ProductService" /> 
</bean>
@CODE:<bean id="mockBean" class="org.easymock.EasyMock" 
    factory-method="createStrictMock" autowire="byName">
    <constructor-arg index="0" value="com.xxx.xxx.ClassToMock" /> 
</bean> ClassToMock obj = (ClassToMock)ContextLoader
    .getCurrentWebApplicationContext()
    .getAutowireCapableBeanFactory()
    .getBean("mockBean"); @Autowired @Path(ProductResource.RESOURCE_PATH)
@Component
@Scope("prototype")
public class ProductResource 
extends GenericResource<Product, BaseModel> {

    /*
     * Members

@TITLE:Rendering partials / view in a rake task / background job / model in Rails 4
@CONTENT:I've read a lot on rendering Rails partials and views in rake tasks / background jobs / models. The vast majority of things I have found on Stackoverflow and the web describe approaches working in Rails 3, but they seem outdated and I didn't get them to work (even with quite some time spent experimenting). So, how can I render a partial in a background job in Rails 4? Here's the best approach I've worked out so far (demonstrated in the console). c = ApplicationController.new
result = c.render_to_string(partial: 'tweets/tweet', locals: {tweet: Tweet.first})
# =>
#   Tweet Load (0.8ms)  SELECT "tweets".* FROM "tweets" ORDER BY "tweets"."id" ASC LIMIT 1
#   Author Load (0.6ms)  SELECT "authors".* FROM "authors" WHERE "authors"."id" = $1 ORDER BY "authors"."id" ASC LIMIT 1  [["id", 1]]
#   Status Load (0.6ms)  SELECT "statuses".* FROM "statuses" WHERE "statuses"."twitter_id" = 367523226848866304 LIMIT 1
#   Rendered tweets/_tweet_body.html.slim (17.5ms)

 Any ideas? Thanks in advance! Update: The tweet_path mentioned above is indeed not defined. This error resulted from linking to a path = link_to 'Tweet', [@project, tweet] (slim templates) using an instance variable that would be present in views inheriting from a certain controller, but not when rendered outside of this context. I solved this going through the appropriate association instead = link_to 'Tweet', [tweet.project, tweet].

@TITLE:Python Multiprocessing Documentation Example
@CONTENT:I'm trying to learn Python multiprocessing. http://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html from the example of "To show the individual process IDs involved, here is an expanded example:" from multiprocessing import Process

def info(title):

 What exactly am I looking at? I see that def f(name): is called after info('main line') is finished, but this synchronous call would be default anyways. I see that the same process info('main line') is the parent PID of def f(name): but not sure what is 'multiprocessing' about that. Also, with join() "Block the calling thread until the process whose join() method is called terminates". I'm not clear on what the calling thread would be. In this example what would join() be blocking?

@LINK:/questions/18158496/unicorn-memory-usage-filling-up-almost-all-the-ram
@TITLE:Unicorn Memory Usage filling up almost all the RAM
@CONTENT:There are essentially 3 problems here: 1) Unicorn seems to be steadily filling up all the RAM, causing me to remove workers manually. 2) Unicorn seems to be spawning additional workers for some reason, although I have specified a fixed number of workers (7 of them). This is partly causing the RAM buildup, which also is causing me to remove workers manually. 3) Zero downtime deployment is unreliable in my case. Sometimes it picks up the changes, sometimes I get gateway timeouts. Each deploy becomes a very stressful situation. I don't really like using Monit, because it kills workers without waiting for workers to finish serving their requests. So, is this normal? Do other people who deploy using Unicorn have the same problem where the RAM just grows uncontrollably? And also where workers the number of workers spawned do not match the number of workers defined? The other alternative is unicorn worker killer, which I would be trying out after reading Unicorn Eating Memory. Tiny Update: So it came to a point where New Relic was telling me the memory was almost 95%. So I had to kill a worker. Interestingly, killing that worker brought the memory down by quite a lot, as seen from the graph below. What's up with that? For reference, here's my unicorn.rb and unicorn_init.sh.

@TITLE:Is there an onBackPressed() alternative for a service?
@CONTENT:I know that services cannot implement Back key press and I understand the rationale. But there is an app called SideBar (on Play Store) that reacts to back key presses. It is a service that adds a view as system overlay and removes the view when the back key is pressed. Can anybody explain how this is done? Here is another app that does it well. I have scoured the web, but have not found a solution to this problem. Any ideas?

@TITLE:Robolectric ContentProvider testing
@CONTENT:I have noticed that every now and then there is a question about using Robolectric for testing custom ContentProviders. However, there has never been a concrete and unambiguous answer on how to do it properly. I have stumbled upon 2 different approaches: one saying you can simply instantiate an in-memory ContentProvider, which you can use to insert and query data (https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6139359) the other saying to use the ShadowContentResolver to set mock cursor data (https://groups.google.com/d/msg/robolectric/r35mMirIkTs/xJJBNXl_RgwJ) However, I'm getting a java.lang.InstantiationException with both approaches. There have been some SO posts saying that this is due to SQLiteDatabase.rawQueryWithFactory(SQLiteDatabase.java) not being overriden in Robolectric (Android + Robolectric - RuntimeException / InstantiationException in queryBuilder.query() in ContentProvider). I guess my question is - are there any preffered workarounds that make testing ContentProviders possible. Or are there any other approaches that are better then those 2 mentioned above.

@TITLE:Connection Error in Apache Pig
@CONTENT:I am running Apache Pig .11.1 with Hadoop 2.0.5. Most simple jobs that I run in Pig work perfectly fine. However, whenever I try to use GROUP BY on a large dataset, or the LIMIT operator, I get these connection errors: 2013-07-29 13:24:08,591 [main] INFO  org.apache.hadoop.mapred.ClientServiceDelegate - Application state is completed.

 The strange thing is that after these errors keeping appearing for about 2 minutes, they'll stop, and the correct output shows up at the bottom. So Hadoop is running fine and computing the proper output. The problem is just these connection errors that keep popping up. The LIMIT operator always gets this error. It happens on both MapReduce mode and local mode. The GROUP BY operator will work fine on small datasets. One thing that I have noticed is that whenever this error appears, the job had created and ran multiple JAR files during the job. However, after a few minutes of these message popping up, the correct output finally appears. Any suggestions on how to get rid of these messages?

@TITLE:How Do You Configure Windows Azure For Url Rewrite Using WordPress?
@CONTENT:I have just created a website using Windows Azure and their template for a WordPress blog. I was able to update the CNAME and Alias records to properly forward my domain to their website. When I go to: www.myblog.net, I am redirected to: myblog.azurewebsites.net and the browser shows www.myblog.net, which is what I want. This all works fine. The site loads fine and all is well. The problem, though, comes when I try to get to a page with a permalink. Through WordPress configuration, I updated my permalinks to be in this format: http://www.myblog.net/blog/The-Post-Name-Is-Here. The problem with this is that when I attempt to go to that URL, I get this error: The resource you are looking for has been removed, had its name changed, or is temporarily unavailable. If I go to the shortlink for that same topic (e.g. http://www.myblog.net/?p=241), the page is found and all is well. I have researched this quite a lot and have found that there is a url rewrite for apache, but that obviously won't work for me. I have also found that there is a url rewrite for IIS and I have played with this locally. You can configure this to properly manage the url rewrite. However, there is no such IIS panel in the Windows Azure Websites configuration portal. I have also read a lot about editing web.config and htaccess, but neither of these files are in my wwwroot directory (or any child directories) for my website on azure. So, does anyone know how to configure azure websites to manage permalinks properly? Thanks in advance for your help!

@TITLE:using flask-sqlalchemy without the subclassed declarative base
@CONTENT:I am using Flask for my python wsgi server, and sqlalchemy for all my database access. I think I would like to use the Flask-Sqlalchemy extension in my application, but I do not want to use the declarative base class (db.Model), instead, I want to use the base from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative. Does this defeat the entire purpose of using the extension? My use case: I would like the extension to help me manage sessions/engines a little better, but I would like to handle all models separately. I actually wouldn't mind using the extension, but I want to write strict models. I am porting code from a non-flask application, and I will be pushing changes back to that project as I go. If flask-sqlalchemy allows me to cheat on Table metadata for instance, that is going to cause problems when the code is pushed back out. There are also portions of my code that do lots of type checking (polymorphic identities), and I also remember reading that type checking on Table is not recommended when using the extension.

@CONTENT:I would appreciate some clarification about web api auto generated help pages. As far as I could understand, if I return a Type it will auto generate the help page for that action with an example. But if I use HttpResponseMessage than it's understandable that it cannot guess what the response will be and can only make assumptions on the request parameters. The reason I was using the HttpResponseMessage was because it was recommended to indicate the status code you wish to return when it may be different than 200. So what's the best practice approach to be able to return your desired status codes, but still have the help pages working out the types you are returning?

@LINK:/questions/17818210/how-to-refresh-select2-dropdown-menu-after-ajax-loading-different-content
@TITLE:how to refresh Select2 dropdown menu after ajax loading different content?
@CONTENT:I'm using Select2 in a combination of dropdown menus. I have one menu for "Countries" and one for "States/Provinces". Depending on the country that is chosen, the "States/Provinces" dropdown changes in content. The states/provinces are pulled with ajax from a database and then displayed this way: $display_output = '<select style="width:350px;" tabindex="2" name="state" id="state" data-placeholder="Choose a Country..."> ';
$display_output .= '<option value="" selected>Select a State</option> ';

while ($state_details = $this->fetch_array($sql_select_states))
{
    $display_output .= '<option value="' . $state_details['id'] . '" ' . (($selected_value == $state_details['id']) ? 'selected' : ''). '>' . $state_details['s.name'] . '</option>';
}

$display_output .= '</select>';
 So far, so good. All the provinces change correctly, however when it initially loads, the Select2 shows "undefined" for the states dropdown, even though I have it set as data-placeholder="Choose a Country..."
 I'm assuming it could be because on loading, the country selected is "United States" and it populates a list of states but none of them is default or selected. Is there any other way to define a default value so that it doesn't show "Undefined"? And another (but less important) problem is that when someone chooses "United States" for example, and then chooses "Arizona", if the person then changes to "Canada" as the country, the state of "Arizona" still stays but when opening the dropdown the provinces of Canada are selectable. Is there any way to return it to the default value temporarily when someone selects another country, until a province is chosen again? My loading code is currently just: <script>
$(document).ready(function() { $("#state").select2(); });
</script>
@CODE:$display_output = '<select style="width:350px;" tabindex="2" name="state" id="state" data-placeholder="Choose a Country..."> ';
$display_output .= '<option value="" selected>Select a State</option> ';

while ($state_details = $this->fetch_array($sql_select_states))
{
    $display_output .= '<option value="' . $state_details['id'] . '" ' . (($selected_value == $state_details['id']) ? 'selected' : ''). '>' . $state_details['s.name'] . '</option>';
}

$display_output .= '</select>'; data-placeholder="Choose a Country..." <script>
$(document).ready(function() { $("#state").select2(); });

The reason why I'm asking is because is very frustrating to include any new file I add to the project folder whenever I use some other IDE ( like ST3 ) or when I save a file from Photoshop, etc. I'm using Grunt for doing a lot of minifying, concatenation, running ngmin on my angular scripts, etc. There's a grunt-shell plugin that allows grunt tasks to run shell commands ( I'm already using it for unlocking locked files by TFS ).

@LINK:/questions/17279230/passing-data-from-controller-to-view-in-a-php-mvc-app
@TITLE:Passing data from Controller to View in a PHP MVC app
@CONTENT:In almost all tutorials or answers on SO, I see a common way to send data from a Controller to the View, the class View often looks something similar than the code below: class View
{
    protected $_file;
    protected $_data = array();

    public function __construct($file)
    {
        $this->_file = $file;
    }

    public function set($key, $value)
    {
        $this->_data[$key] = $value;
    }

    public function get($key) 
    {
        return $this->_data[$key];
    }

    public function output()
    {
        if (!file_exists($this->_file))
        {
            throw new Exception("Template " . $this->_file . " doesn't exist.");
        }

        extract($this->_data);
        ob_start();
        include($this->_file);
        $output = ob_get_contents();
        ob_end_clean();
        echo $output;
    }
}
 I don't understand why I need to put the data in an array and then call extract($this->_data). Why not just put directly some properties to the view from the controller like $this->_view->title = 'hello world';
 then in my layout or template file I could just do: echo $this->title;
@CODE:class View
{
    protected $_file;
    protected $_data = array();

    public function __construct($file)
    {
        $this->_file = $file;
    }

    public function set($key, $value)
    {
        $this->_data[$key] = $value;
    }

    public function get($key) 
    {
        return $this->_data[$key];
    }

    public function output()
    {
        if (!file_exists($this->_file))
        {
            throw new Exception("Template " . $this->_file . " doesn't exist.");
        }

        extract($this->_data);
        ob_start();
        include($this->_file);
        $output = ob_get_contents();
        ob_end_clean();
        echo $output;
    }
} $this->_view->title = 'hello world'; echo $this->title;

@TITLE:tiff() resolution and compression are not reliably set in OSX
@CONTENT:The resolution and compression options in tiff() seem to be ignored on my system (see information below). This appears to be the same problem discussed in this SO question; I'm posting the question here so that I can be more specific about my system. For instance the following code, x <- rnorm(1000)
tiff("example.tiff", height=3, width=5, units="in", res=200, compression="lzw")
hist(x)
dev.off()
 yields a .tiff file that superficially looks fine, but when I use Photoshop to look at the image size, I see this This is consistent with tiff() creating a file with the right number of pixels, but the wrong size in inches. (This discrepancy gets me into trouble when I want to control both the font size and the image size of an image, for instance for publications that require specific physical image sizes). Note that the file is also 2.5 MB, which seems too big for a 3"-by-5" black-and-white lzw-compressed tiff. I suspect that the compression option is also being ignored. I get the same result with ggsave (which might rely on tiff() under the hood?) and with png(), so this seems to be a general problem with the way R and OSX deal with image files.

@TITLE:How to track eyes using Kinect SDK?
@CONTENT:The requirement is to define a rectangle around each eye in 3D space. There should be a way to track eyes using the Microsoft Kinect SDK. According to this The Face Tracking SDK uses the Kinect coordinate system to output its 3D tracking results.

The measurement units are meters for translation and degrees for rotation angles. Adding ...

 when the SDK starts tracking a face. I should be able to use these coordinates to paint a box around each eye but the Z coordinate should probably be closer to 1.0, not -0.1.. or -0.2.. (based on my setup) so I don't trust the numbers. Is the XYZ supposed to be the location of the FeaturePoint in 3D space relative to the sensor? Do I misunderstand the Kinect coordinate system? Am I using the Kinect SDK incorrectly? Does it matter that I am using an Xbox 360 Kinect Sensor? (Microsoft does not guarantee full compatibility for Kinect for Windows applications and the Xbox 360 Kinect Sensor) Edit: Adding this if (trackSucceeded) {

 Tangential to the other post, it's interesting to note how much faster the comparison is when the Object that we're comparing is initialized. The first two numbers in each output are when the Object was null and the latter two numbers are when the Object was initialized.

@TITLE:FTP server using S3 as storage
@CONTENT:I am trying to create a ftp server ( using windows/linux/mac - no concern) which would have its storage as a Amazon S3 storage. Now note that S3 does not support FTP natively so this would need some kind of hack as a solution. I researched about the topic and found various solutions but am not really convinced be any of those. Them being: Amazon EC2 + TntDrive Using SME Creating an EC2 instance and installing FTP server and mounting S3 as local filesystem. I am trying to find the best solution in terms of security and flexibility/smoothness. Which solution do you think is the best and how to achieve the above? Edit 1 : I am very interested in the following solution. here is what I gather : You can attach the EBS volume to an EC2 instance and run an FTP server on that instance. Point the FTP server to the attached EBS volume, then just FTP up your file - it will be written directly to the EBS volume. You would want to use an FTP server and client that can support resuming interrupted transfers - for example, FileZilla. Am I correct when I assume all of the above ? Also can anyone give the step by step procedure on how to achieve this?

@TITLE:Make a shell script to update 3 git repos
@CONTENT:I am working with 5 repos that I have cloned in my development environment. When I want to update a git repo, I enter the folder /home/adrian/repo1/ and do: git checkout master git pull origin master But then, every morning I have to do the same thing for the other 4 repos. This is quite troublesome. Can I put this in a shell script? I mean, if I write these git commands in the shell script, and run it, will I be able to update all the repos? I was thinking of writing something like this... cd repo1
git checkout master 
git pull origin master
cd ..
cd repo2
git checkout master 
git pull origin master
cd ..
 (i'm on linux) Edit: Maybe this is more challenging than what I thought. Most times when I do "git pull origin master", i get erorrs like "Your local changes to .... would be overwritten by merge." So i have to enter into the respective branch and stash the stuff.. Edit 2: What I'm thinking of doing is, if a conflict happens, ignore it and go to the next repo cd repo1
git checkout master 
git pull origin master

(if there is conflict, ignore and go to the next line but dont stop here)

cd ..
cd repo2
git checkout master 
git pull origin master

@TITLE:Efficient way to manage a git repository for local config files
@CONTENT:I store my config files (~/.bashrc, ~/.emacs, ~/emacs, etc.) in git. The way I configured this was simply to add a git repository in the home dir. I found this approach has some problems: git gui takes forever, because it recursively scans the whole home dir. I sometimes accidentally add files to the config repo that should go to a new repo (I create a new project, say in ~/projects/foo, forget it doesn't yet have a git repo initialized, and execute git add bar.xyz in the foo directory. This results in a file being added to the config repo). I'm not sure it is wise to have git repositories nested under a directory that already has a git repository, although I haven't yet encounter any fundamental problems with this. Is there a better approach, or is this a standard way in which people store local config files in git?

@TITLE:Angularjs initial form validation with directives
@CONTENT:I have a validation directive called valid-number that is used to set the validity of a form using $setValidity - this works fine for any text values that I type into the input box that have the directive applied to as an attribute. The HTML is <form name="numberForm">
<input name="amount" type="text" ng-model="amount" required  valid-number /></form>
 The directive is as follow angular.module('test',[]).directive('validNumber',function(){
            return{
                require: "ngModel",
                link: function(scope, elm, attrs, ctrl){

                    var regex=/\d/;
                    ctrl.$parsers.unshift(function(viewValue){
                        var floatValue = parseFloat(viewValue);

                        if(regex.test(viewValue)){
                            ctrl.$setValidity('validNumber',true);
                        }
                        else{
                            ctrl.$setValidity('validNumber',false);
                        }
                        return viewValue;
                    });
                }
            };
        });
 However, I would also like the validation to be triggered and set the css to an invalid clsss if the value the input box is initialised to when the page is first loaded is invalid, eg if I set $scope.amount = 'not a number' I would expect the input box to have had the directive applied to it, but no joy. In order for not a number to be highlighted as invalid I have to make a change to the contents of the input, which triggers the directive. How can I ensure the directive applies to whatever the <input> is initialised with? A full code example is here; http://jsfiddle.net/JW43C/5/
@CODE:valid-number <form name="numberForm">
<input name="amount" type="text" ng-model="amount" required  valid-number /></form> angular.module('test',[]).directive('validNumber',function(){
            return{
                require: "ngModel",
                link: function(scope, elm, attrs, ctrl){

                    var regex=/\d/;
                    ctrl.$parsers.unshift(function(viewValue){
                        var floatValue = parseFloat(viewValue);

                        if(regex.test(viewValue)){
                            ctrl.$setValidity('validNumber',true);
                        }
                        else{
                            ctrl.$setValidity('validNumber',false);
                        }
                        return viewValue;

@TITLE:Getting started with Cherrypy and Jinja2
@CONTENT:This is my first time delving into web development in python. My only other experience is PHP, and I never used a framework before, so I'm finding this very intimidating and confusing. I'm interested in learning CherryPy/Jinja2 to make a ZFS Monitor for my NAS. I've read through the basics of the docs on CherryPy/Jinja2 but I find that the samples are disjointed and too simplistic, I don't really understand how to make these 2 things "come together" gracefully. Some questions I have: Is there a simple tutorial shows how you make CherryPy and Jinja2 work together nicely? I'm either finding samples that are too simple, like the samples on CherryPy / Jinja2 docs, or way to complex. (example: https://github.com/jovanbrakus/cherrypy-example). Is there a standardized or "expected" way to create web applications for CherryPy? (example: What should my directory structure look like? Is there a way to declare static things; is it even necessary?) Does anyone have recommended literature for this or is the online documentation the best resource?

@TITLE:Faster alternative to manage.py collectstatic (w/ s3boto storage backend) to sync static files to s3?
@CONTENT:I have been using s3boto's S3BotoStorage as my static files backend and syncing files to my aws s3 buckets (staging and production) using ./manage.py collectstatic. It works fine. However it is painfully slow. In addition to my own static files (just a few) and django admin, I have a few third party packages with many many static files (grappelli, django-redactor). And collectstatic can take upwards of 15 minutes each time I run it, depending on my internet connection. For instances where I'm syncing with my staging bucket and things aren't quite right, and I have to tweak something and re-sync, its a big time killer. Are there any good, fast, scriptable alternatives for syncing static files to s3?

 It is a linear program. The objective function is: 4*x+3*y+6*z
 The polyhedron is the feasible region for this program. I am able to plot the inequalities as planes, which should describe the polyhedron (Note that this is my first try with rgl, so the code is kinda messy. if you want to improve it, please feel free to do so): # setup

 Now I want to plot the region that is described by the planes with x,y,z>=0.
 But I don't know how to do it. I tried to do it like this: x <- seq(0,9,length=20)*seq(0,9,length=20)

}

f4(x,y,z)
z4 <- outer(x,y,z,f4) # ERROR

@TITLE:How to add a button on the Google maps in iOS?
@CONTENT:I am new to iOS Programming and I have downloaded the google maps sdk for iOS and followed the instruction on their website ( as shown in this link https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios/start ) and was able to get the map in my application. Now I am trying to add a button on the screen at the bottom over Google maps for giving an option to the user to go back to the previous screen. I just know that UIButton is a subclass of UIView and we can make a button appear on a view by making it the sub view of that class. Previously iOS used to use Google Maps by default by MKMapView and I have seen examples in books an on the Internet showing screen shots of apps where a button or a text box would appear on the map. But now just dragging the button in the interface builder doesn't help with the SDK of google maps. Here is my code: ViewController.h #import <UIKit/UIKit.h>
#import <MapKit/MapKit.h>
#import <GoogleMaps/GoogleMaps.h>


@interface ViewController : UIViewController 

@property (weak, nonatomic) IBOutlet UIButton *btn;


@end
 ViewController.m #import "ViewController.h"
#import <MapKit/MapKit.h>
#import <GoogleMaps/GoogleMaps.h>
#import <CoreLocation/CoreLocation.h>


@interface ViewController ()

@end

@implementation ViewController
{
    GMSMapView *mapView_;
}

- (void)viewDidLoad
{
    [super viewDidLoad];
    // Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib.
}

- (void)didReceiveMemoryWarning
{
    [super didReceiveMemoryWarning];
    // Dispose of any resources that can be recreated.
}

- (void)loadView
{
    CLLocationManager *locationManager = [[CLLocationManager alloc] init];
    locationManager.distanceFilter = kCLDistanceFilterNone;

    locationManager.desiredAccuracy = kCLLocationAccuracyKilometer;
    [locationManager startUpdatingLocation];

    //Latitude and longitude of the current location of the device.
    double lati = locationManager.location.coordinate.latitude;
    double longi = locationManager.location.coordinate.longitude;
    NSLog(@"Latitude = %f", lati);
    NSLog(@"Longitude = %f", longi);

    CLLocation *myLocation = [[CLLocation alloc] initWithLatitude:lati longitude:longi];

    // Create a GMSCameraPosition that tells the map to display the coordinate

    GMSCameraPosition *camera = [GMSCameraPosition cameraWithLatitude:lati
                                                            longitude:longi
                                                                 zoom:11.5];

    mapView_ = [GMSMapView mapWithFrame:[[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds] camera:camera];
    mapView_.myLocationEnabled = YES;
    self.view = mapView_;

    // Creates a marker in the center of the map.
    GMSMarker *marker = [[GMSMarker alloc] init];
    marker.position = CLLocationCoordinate2DMake(lati, longi);
    marker.title = @"It's Me";
    marker.snippet = @"My Location";
    marker.map = mapView_;

    [mapView_ addSubview:_btn];
    [mapView_ bringSubviewToFront:_btn];

}
@end
 You can see that in the last 2 lines I have made the button the subview of mapview and tried to bring it front. But this didn't help. Please let me know what is it that I am missing or if there is another way to do this by using some other function. Please also do check the screenshot of the storyboard which I have created so that you can understand better what I am trying to do here. Thanks.

@TITLE:Immutable Dictionary Vs Dictionary Vs C5 Vs F# - performance
@CONTENT:Our application uses plenty of dictionaries which have multi level lookup that are not frequently changing. We are investigating at converting some of the critical code that does a lot of lookup using dictionaries to use alternate structures for - faster lookup, light on the memory/gc. This made us compare various dictionaries/libraries available - Dictionary(System.Collections.Generics.Dictionary-SCGD), ImmutableDictionary, C5.HashDictionary, FSharpMap. Running the following program with various items count - 100, 1000, 10000, 100000 - shows that Dictionary is still the winner at most ranges. First row indicates items in collection. MS/Ticks would the time taken to perform x lookups randomized (code is below). Items - 100 SCGD - 0 MS - 50 Ticks C5 - 1 MS - 1767 Ticks Imm - 4 MS - 5951 Ticks FS - 0 MS - 240 Ticks Items - 1000 SCGD - 0 MS - 230 Ticks C5 - 0 MS - 496 Ticks Imm - 0 MS - 1046 Ticks FS - 1 MS - 1870 Ticks Items - 10000 SCGD - 3 MS - 4722 Ticks C5 - 4 MS - 6370 Ticks Imm - 9 MS - 13119 Ticks FS - 15 MS - 22050 Ticks Items - 100000 SCGD - 62 MS - 89276 Ticks C5 - 72 MS - 103658 Ticks Imm - 172 MS - 246247 Ticks FS - 249 MS - 356176 Ticks Does this mean, we are already using the fastest and don't have to change? I had presumed that immutable structures should be at the top of table, but it wasn't that way. Are we doing wrong comparison or am I missing something?

Though originally conceived for accelerating string, text, and XML processing, the powerful new capabilities of these instructions are useful outside of these domains, and it is worth revisiting the search and recognition stages of numerous applications to utilize STTNI to improve performance Does gcc make use of these instructions if they are available?

@CONTENT:I am trying to use a list comprehension that compares string objects, but one of the strings is utf-8, the byproduct of json.loads. Scenario: us = u'MyString' # is the utf-8 string
 Part one of my question, is why does this return False? : us.encode('utf-8') == "MyString" ## False
 Part two - how can I compare within a list comprehension? myComp = [utfString for utfString in jsonLoadsObj

@TITLE:The DELETE statement conflicted with the SAME TABLE REFERENCE constraint with Entity Framework
@CONTENT:I have a table with a self reference where the ParentId is an FK to the ID (PK). Using EF (code-first), I've set up my relationship as follows: this.HasOptional(t => t.ParentValue)
    .WithMany(t => t.ChildValues)
    .HasForeignKey(t => t.ParentId);
 When I try to delete the children and its parent, the DELETE commands EF issues to the database are not in the order I expected them to go - it attempts to delete the parent record first. I realize that I have a couple of options here (neither of which I like): Delete child records first, do a full save/commit, and then delete parent record. With the complexity of my model and the logic that maintains it, this isn't an option - can't issue multiple commit commands whenever I want. Dissolve the relationship before deleting anything. This seems like a more sensible solution, but again, I have to issue separate commit with an UPDATE statement before the DELETEs. I want to avoid multiple save/commit calls. Use a trigger to delete children prior to deleting parent record. But I'd like to avoid triggers and their problematic nature as much as possible. So the question is.. is there a way to enforce the deletion of children before the parent record? Perhaps I'm missing some sort of an explicit way of telling EF that it needs to take care of these children before the parent? Maybe there's a way to direct EF to delete in a descending order of IDs? I don't know.. thoughts?

@CONTENT:Since a few days I'm trying to enable SSO for Jira 5.2 and figured out, that the help page from Jira is outdated. Each example uses an old version of atlassian-seraph (Jira 5.2 uses 2.6.0). Goal: I want to get automatically logged in into Jira if I'm logged in into Webseal (reverse proxy). Background: Jira is behind a reverse proxy (see picture). This proxy authentificatates the user and holds the session. If I'm logged in I want to be logged in in Jira, too The only information provided is the user name Question: How to write a custom login module that reads the username from http_header and authentificates the user?

@CONTENT:I'm using Selenium Webdriver in Java. I want to get the current url after clicking the "next" button to move from page 1 to page 2. Here's the code I have:     WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();

    String currentURL = null;
    WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, 10);

    foo(driver,startURL);

@CONTENT:For some application, users are able to upload their own files. Since this can be very large files, they are allowed to upload them via their own FTP client. Of course I wouldn't like them to upload some PHP files with which they can access all other files on the server. One of the ways I want to prevent this behavior is by denying access to specific file types (like php, rb, py, etc.) only in these folders. I have found ways to deny access to folders, to files, to files in folders, but nothing about file types in folders. I tried combining what I've found, like: <Files ~ "\.inc$">
Order allow,deny
Deny from all
</Files>
 changing to <Files uploads/ "\.inc$">
Order allow,deny
Deny from all
</Files>
 or alternative ways RewriteRule ^(\.php) - [F,L,NC] 
 to RewriteRule ^(uploads/\.php) - [F,L,NC]
 However, I can't find out what syntax I should use. So, for example, I could have the following (basic example): /index.php
/uploads/
  hack.php
  hack.rb

@TITLE:Where can I find the patience diff implemented?
@CONTENT:It is well-answered on this site that Bram Cohen's patience diff is found in bazaar as the default diff and as an option with git diff, but I am finding it difficult to source an independent standalone program that implements this particular diff algorithm. For example I'd like to apply patience diff to perforce diffs, and it's pretty clear with the canonical "frobnitz" code example how patience diff is better: The terminal on the right has invoked the git diff with the --patience flag. I also have set up the diff-highlight perl script, whose job it is to invert colors on matched-up lines between the first and last different sections of those lines. The left side has an example where this doesn't quite help so much but I'll let it slide because at least there is that semicolon there... Anyway, making improvements to the diff-highlight script is not the subject of this question. In addition to the question of where to find a standalone patience diff, if anybody knows how to make perforce p4 use an external diff program, that's also something that has to be done.

@CONTENT:I understand that WAAD is meant for internal organizational accounts. I understand the concepts behind ADFS and other "AD in the cloud" related topics. But is there really anything that is preventing WAAD to be used for public accounts? I want to build a public facing web site using ASP.Net MVC. I will use WIF to implement claims authentication and plan to use ACS as a claims federation provider. I want to allow the end users to login using Social Network Accounts (out of the box with ACS). But I also want to allow users to register their own user name and passwords for my web site. Can I use WAAD for this part? Of course I could build my own custom STS. Or I could use Thinktecture IdentityServer for this purpose. But there are some clear advantages of sticking with WAAD: simplicity (to set up WAAD as a STS to ACS takes just few clicks) performance, security, reliability guaranteed by Azure SLAs Is there any disadvantage to this approach?

@TITLE:Windows 8 IIS does not load stylesheets and images in asp.net app
@CONTENT:I just installed Windows 8 on my computer and tried to load my ASP.net application. The page loads with no problems. But none of the images or stylesheets that are located in the App_Themes directory load. I do have a separate folder that has images in it and they do load. I think it is some security issue but I can't find out what it could be. If I deploy the site to my dev 2008 R2 box then the site loads correctly, but it doesn't load correctly on my Windows 8 box. Some examples of my links are: <link href="../App_Themes/Debug/style.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" />
 The above does not load. <img id="ctl00_imgCompanyLogo" title="Header Logo" src="../Images/EmailImage.aspx?ID=6C633997-065C-44AD-9839-B754005B7995" style="border-width:0px;height:50px;width:220px;margin-left: 10px" />
 However, this one does. Note: No errors are loaded on the page the files simply don't load. Update: I should also note that this did work when I was using Windows 7 to write my code. Update: I added a html page to my application and right clicked on that and that page didn't render. However, if I create a new project, the pages render perfectly. Update2: I think I found the root of the issue but I don't know what to do about it. If you create a new project on a Windows 8 machine then change the project so that it uses the virtual directory not IISExpress (use the Project Url) then none of the stylesheets load and the images won't load as well.

@CONTENT:Has anybody successfully created a card.io wrapper they're willing to share that can be used in a Mono for Android application or can somebody shed some light on what I'm doing wrong? Create a new Android Java Bindings Library Project Add the .jar and .so files from card.io SDK 3.0.3, be sure to use the existing folder structure Add the following to Transforms/EnumMethods.xml to resolve a compiler error: <mapping jni-class="io/card/payment/CardIOActivity">
    <method jni-name="onActivityResult" parameter="p1" clr-enum-type="Android.App.Result" />
</mapping>
 Add a reference to the above Library in my main application Everything compiles and I can access the card.io classes: using IO.Card.Payment;

private void WireupScanCardButton()
{
    Log.Debug(this.GetType().Name, "WireupScanCardButton");

    this.ScanCardButton.Click += delegate 
    {
        Log.Debug(this.GetType().Name, "ScanCard.Click");

        var intent = new Intent(this, typeof(CardIOActivity));

        // Required for authentication with card.io
        intent.PutExtra(CardIOActivity.ExtraAppToken, "<MY PRIVATE TOKEN HERE>");

        // Customize these values to suit your needs.
        intent.PutExtra(CardIOActivity.ExtraNoCamera, false);
        intent.PutExtra(CardIOActivity.ExtraSuppressManualEntry, true);
        intent.PutExtra(CardIOActivity.ExtraRequireExpiry, false);
        intent.PutExtra(CardIOActivity.ExtraRequireCvv, false);
        intent.PutExtra(CardIOActivity.ExtraRequireZip, false);

        // Run the Activity
        this.StartActivityForResult(intent, 0);            
    };
}
 However, I am always presented with the following error: this device can not use camera to read card numbers NOTES: I have tried running on several different physical devices the card.io.jar file has a Build Action of: EmbeddedJar the .so files have a Build Action of: EmbeddedNativeLibrary I've explicitly set the Abi for each .so file in the Project ItemGroup I'm very new to Android/Xamarin, so spend more time researching than coding. The .so files do not appear to be in the .apk file Edit: The .so files do seem to get picked up by the compiler. After compilation, if I check the obj/Release/ folder there is a subfolder native_library_imports that contains the .so files in appropriate subfolders according to the supported Abi type. However, the .so files still do not appear in the final .apk file. logcat output: 04-18 08:12:20.462 D/ActivityAddPaymentSource( 5824): ScanCard.Click

@TITLE:What is the difference between those self-executing anonymous function (aka IIFE) implementation
@CONTENT:In many books / blog posts the self invoking anonymous function pattern is written like this: (function() {
  var foo = 'bar';
})();
 However running a JSLint on this gives this error: Move the invocation into the parens that contain the function. e.g. changing it to this works: (function() {
  var foo = 'bar';
}());
 Questions Why is the first implementation not good enough for JSLint? What are the differences? What is the preferred form? is JSLint always right? Why does it work? after all function(){}() throws a SyntaxError: Unexpected token ( But wrapping it with parens makes it all of a sudden work? e.g. (function(){}()) - works fine (After all this is JavaScript, not Lisp, so what is the effect of the wrapping parens on the ohterwise syntax error?) EDIT: this is somewhat of a followup to this (I would not say exact duplicate though): JSLint error: "Move the invocation into the parens that contain the function", so my main question is #3, why does it work at all?

});
 Populating dropdown from ajax JSON response $.each(response, function (key, value) {
    $("#dropDownUL").append("<li> <a tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#\" align=\"left\"> " + value + "</a> </li>");
})
 HTML code: <div class="dropdown btn">
    <div id="dropDownId" class="dropdown-toggle" id="dLabel" role="button" data-toggle="dropdown" data-target="#">
        Collections
        <b class="caret"></b>
    </div>           
    <ul id="dropDownUL"  class="dropdown-menu pull-left" role="menu" aria-labelledby="dLabel">
    <li><a tabindex="-1" href="#" align="left">Static test Option</a></li>
    </ul>


</div>
 So, once again, if I click on Static test Option I can see message in console : Selected Option: Static test Option But, when I click on Option2 Option 3 which is populated from ajax response, I don't see anything in console. Let me know if something is not clear. I will try to explain further.
@CODE:<li> <li> <li> $(".dropdown-menu li a").click(function () {
        console.log("Selected Option:"+$(this).text());
}); $.each(response, function (key, value) {
    $("#dropDownUL").append("<li> <a tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#\" align=\"left\"> " + value + "</a> </li>");
}) <div class="dropdown btn">
    <div id="dropDownId" class="dropdown-toggle" id="dLabel" role="button" data-toggle="dropdown" data-target="#">

        <b class="caret"></b>

@TITLE:How to create multiple stop gradient fragment shader?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to create an OpenGL ES 2.0 fragment shader that outputs multiple stop gradient along one axis. It should interpolate between multiple colors at points defined in percents. I've achieved this by using ifs the fragment shader, like this: float y = gl_FragCoord.y;
float step1 = resolution.y * 0.20;
float step2 = resolution.y * 0.50;

if (y < step1) {
    color = white;
} else if (y < step2) {
    float x = smoothstep(step1, step2, y);
    color = mix(white, red, x);
} else {
    float x = smoothstep(step2, resolution.y, y);
    color = mix(red, green, x);
}
 They say that branching in fragment shader can kill performance. Is there some clever trickery that can be used to interpolate between many values without using ifs? Is it actually worth it (this is highly subjective, I know, but as rule of thumb)? To illustrate my problem, full source (still short though) in this GLSL Sandbox link: http://glsl.heroku.com/e#8035.0
@CODE:if float y = gl_FragCoord.y;
float step1 = resolution.y * 0.20;
float step2 = resolution.y * 0.50;

if (y < step1) {
    color = white;
} else if (y < step2) {
    float x = smoothstep(step1, step2, y);
    color = mix(white, red, x);
} else {
    float x = smoothstep(step2, resolution.y, y);
    color = mix(red, green, x);

@TITLE:Retrieving a Braintree customer's subscriptions
@CONTENT:I want to collect all of a Braintree Customer's subscriptions. When I browse to a customer's page in the gateway, I can see their subscriptions, but it doesn't seem that a method like subscriptions exists for Braintree::Customer, or that I can search for Braintree::Subscriptions by customer_id. There are roundabout ways that I can access all of a customer's subscriptions, but they are very slow. For example, I can retrieve all of the customer's transactions, and for each transaction, get the subscription_id (if it exists), and then retrieve the subscription with that ID. This involves a lot of communication with the Braintree API, and I was hoping for a more efficient solution. Oh, and I'm programming this in rails, but the question doesn't seem Rails-specific.

protected void onDraw(Canvas canvas) {
    super.onDraw(canvas);

    int sc = canvas.saveLayer(0, 0, getWidth(), getHeight(), drawPaint, Canvas.MATRIX_SAVE_FLAG | Canvas.CLIP_SAVE_FLAG | Canvas.HAS_ALPHA_LAYER_SAVE_FLAG
            | Canvas.FULL_COLOR_LAYER_SAVE_FLAG | Canvas.CLIP_TO_LAYER_SAVE_FLAG);
    canvas.drawRoundRect(bounds, mCornerRadius, mCornerRadius, roundPaint);
    canvas.restoreToCount(sc);
}
 where: drawPaint = new Paint(Paint.ANTI_ALIAS_FLAG);
drawPaint.setColor(0xffffffff);
drawPaint.setXfermode(new PorterDuffXfermode(PorterDuff.Mode.DST_IN));

roundPaint = new Paint(Paint.ANTI_ALIAS_FLAG);
roundPaint.setColor(0xffffffff);
 DST_IN seems the correct option here (according to the APIDemos example), but the area that should be transparent (the rounded one) has instead a black background, and the corners of the children are still visible.

I'm running into a problem when doing an initial schema migration with Here's what happening: I've got my extended user class, Player, in my class tournaments, which is enabled in settings.INSTALLED_APPS.

 So, it appears that I've got a chicken/egg situation here: I can't syncdb without my user model. But, if I syncdb with my user model, I can't perform an initial migration! What is the best way to get around this?

    fahrenheit.value = c2f(e.target.value)
}
fahrenheit.oninput = function(e) {
    celsius.value = f2c(e.target.value)
}
function c2f(c) {
    return 9/5 * parseFloat(c) + 32;
}
function f2c(f) {
    return 5/9 * (f - 32);
}
 Not only it fixes the problem, its also reduces the code 3.5?. Clearly Im doing MVC wrong.
@CODE:var Temperature = Backbone.Model.extend({
    defaults: {
        celsius: 0
    },
    fahrenheit: function(value) {
        if (typeof value == 'undefined') {
            return this.c2f(this.get('celsius'));
        }
        value = parseFloat(value);
        this.set('celsius', this.f2c(value));
    },
    c2f: function(c) {
        return 9/5 * c + 32;
    },
    f2c: function(f) {
        return 5/9 * (f - 32);
    }
});


var TemperatureView = Backbone.View.extend({
    el: document.body,
    model: new Temperature(),
    events: {
        "input #celsius": "updateCelsius",
        "input #fahrenheit": "updateFahrenheit"
    },
    initialize: function() {
        this.listenTo(this.model, 'change:celsius', this.render);
        this.render();
    },
    render: function() {
        this.$('#celsius').val(this.model.get('celsius'));
        this.$('#fahrenheit').val(this.model.fahrenheit());
    },
    updateCelsius: function(event) {
        this.model.set('celsius', event.target.value);
    },
    updateFahrenheit: function(event) {
        this.model.fahrenheit(event.target.value);
    }
});

var temperatureView = new TemperatureView(); celsius.oninput = function(e) {
    fahrenheit.value = c2f(e.target.value)

fahrenheit.oninput = function(e) {

@TITLE:Join R data.tables where key values are not exactly equal--combine rows with closest times
@CONTENT:Is there a slick way to join data tables in R where key values of time are close, but not exactly the same? For example, suppose I have a data table of results that are given for different time periods: DT1 = data.table(x=rep(c("a","b","c"),each=3), time=c(10,30,60), v=1:9)
 Here, we have some values (v) for different categories (x) taken at different times (time). Now suppose that I have data from another source that provides some time values for the different categories: DT2=data.table(x=rep(c("a","b","c"),each=1),time=c(10,10,60))
 I might be interested in trying to match the times in DT2 as closely as I can to DT1 to predict a value, v, for my DT2 categories. I would like to do something like setkeyv(DT2,c("x","time"))
merge(DT1,DT2,by=c("time","v")
 Which returns:    time x v
1:   10 a 1
2:   10 b 4
3:   60 c 9
 But what if my times didn't have the same precision? For example: DT2=data.table(x=rep(c("a","b","c"),each=1),time=c(17,54,3))
 Is there a way to perform a similar merge but pick times of DT2 that are close to those of DT1? That is 17 would be close to 30, 54 close to 60, and 3 close to 10? If this simple example isn't clear, I'll briefly explain the larger problem that I am having. I have a data table with columns: category, time, output1, output2... There are hundreds of categories with associated times. I might want to pull output 1 for all categories at a specific time. Since the times were sampled with no apparent logic, sometimes the time is rounded to the nearest even second; in other cases the times are rounded to the nearest minute or even 10 minutes. I could write a script to rewrite times in more common format, but I am curious if there is a slick data.table solution that I haven't seen. I have explored the rolling merge with no success.
@CODE:DT1 = data.table(x=rep(c("a","b","c"),each=3), time=c(10,30,60), v=1:9) DT2=data.table(x=rep(c("a","b","c"),each=1),time=c(10,10,60)) setkeyv(DT2,c("x","time"))
merge(DT1,DT2,by=c("time","v") time x v
1:   10 a 1
2:   10 b 4
3:   60 c 9 DT2=data.table(x=rep(c("a","b","c"),each=1),time=c(17,54,3))

Since logging in and authorising users is a synchronous operation, how is this tackled in an eventually consistent architecture? Will I have to roll my own auth system where I keep denormalized auth tables on the read side? How to handle the security of this? Will I end up storing password hashes in both my event store and my view tables?

@TITLE:Best Practice for Errors in RESTful API
@CONTENT:What are the best practices for returning HTTP status codes in RESTful API? I am using Laravel 4 for my PHP framework. In the case of an error, should I use return Response::json('User Exists', 401);
 or include flag for success return Response::json([
    'success' => false,
    'data' => 'User Exists'],
    401
);
 or use 200 instead of 4xx, relying on success to determine if there is an error return Response::json([
    'success' => false,
    'data' => 'User Exists'],
    200
);
 And in the case of success and there is no need to return any data, do you still return anything? PHP API Code public function getCheckUniqueEmail() {
    // Check if Email already exist in table 'users'
    $uniqueEmail = checkIfEmailExists();

    // Return JSON Response
    if($uniqueEmail) {
        // Validation fail (user exists)
        return Response::json('User Exists', 401);
    } else {
        // Validation success
        // - Return anything?
    }
}
@CODE:return Response::json('User Exists', 401); success return Response::json([
    'success' => false,
    'data' => 'User Exists'],

    // Return JSON Response

I want to parse through them with an online article extractor API (Clear Read), and with the result given back for each article (some HTML) I throw it into an NSString. My problem arises from the fact that, say my array has 100 URLs in it, I loop through the array shooting each item into the API and getting back some results in JSON. This is firing like 100 NSURLConnection calls at once asynchronously. I wasn't sure if that'd be a problem, but when I give it 100 URLs (real strings, none are nil) the data that comes back often has either empty values for the JSON keys (when they shouldn't), or the data coming back is nil. There's also a bunch of duplicates. Should I be handling multiple asynchronous connections better than I am now? If so, how?

@TITLE:Expectation Maximization coin toss examples
@CONTENT:I've been self-studying the Expectation Maximization lately, and grabbed myself some simple examples in the process: http://cs.dartmouth.edu/~cs104/CS104_11.04.22.pdf There are 3 coins 0, 1 and 2 with P0, P1 and P2 probability landing on Head when tossed. Toss coin 0, if the result is Head, toss coin 1 three times else toss coin 2 three times. The observed data produced by coin 1 and 2 is like this: HHH, TTT, HHH, TTT, HHH. The hidden data is coin 0's result. Estimate P0, P1 and P2. http://ai.stanford.edu/~chuongdo/papers/em_tutorial.pdf There are two coins A and B with PA and PB being the probability landing on Head when tossed. Each round, select one coin at random and toss it 10 times then record the results. The observed data is the toss results provided by these two coins. However, we don't know which coin was selected for a particular round. Estimate PA and PB. While I can get the calculations, I can't relate the ways they are solved to the original EM theory. Specifically, during the M-Step of both examples, I don't see how they're maximizing anything. It just seems they are recalculating the parameters and somehow, the new parameters are better than the old ones. Moreover, the two E-Steps don't even look similar to each other, not to mention the original theory's E-Step. So how exactly do these example work?

@TITLE:Applying the same factor levels to multiple variables in an R data frame
@CONTENT:I am working with a dataset that includes 16 questions where the response set is identical (Yes, No, Unknown or Missing). I am processing the data using R and I want to turn each of the variables into a factor. For a single variable, I could use the following construction: df <- read.csv("thedata.csv")
df$q1 <- factor(x=df$q1,levels=c(-9,0,1),
                        labels=c("Unknown or Missing","No","Yes))
 I'd like to avoid typing that 16 times. I could do it with a for(), but I was wondering if there is a clearer, more R way to do it. Some sample data: structure(list(q1 = c(0, 0, 0, -9, 0), q2 = c(0, 0, 1, 0, 0),

 for example: X=np.array([ [ [1,2,3], [2,4,5] ,[2,3,4] ] , [ [5,6], [6,6] ] , [[2,3,1],[2,3,10],[23,1,2],[1,4,5]]  ] ,"object")

 so for every sample I need to calculate the dot product between every element of x with corresponding element of y of same index and sum the result. i.e: result=0

for i in range(3):

 This is my whole code:  print "***build kernel***"
        K = np.zeros((n_samples, n_samples))
        for i in range(n_samples):

 as you can see the complexity of this algorithm is too high and also my samples are much bigger than this. so for even a small data set, i.e. contains 400 samples, I have to wait 4 hours to get the result. I am looking for a better way to implement this algorithm. P.S: I was thinking about multithreading or multiproccessing but I am not sure if it helps?! I appreciate any suggestion!

@TITLE:Maximizing difference between numbers in a sequence
@CONTENT:I need some help in finding the general idea for an algorithm to solve the following problem. The problem has been given to me in an assignment. It looks like it should be solvable through a greedy method, but I can't figure out a simple solution. Here's the problem description: You are given a sequence of N numbers a_1 ... a_n such that 0 = a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n. You must eliminate at most M of these numbers such that the minimum difference a_i+1 - a_i between any two consecutive numbers is maximized. You may not eliminate the first and last elements, a_0 and a_n. Also you must eliminate as few numbers as possible: if eliminating M - 1 you get the shortest distance to be D and eliminating M you still have the same minimum difference, you must not eliminate this last number. I'm not asking for a complete solution to this problem. Only a few guidelines as to how the algorithm might look. Edit: Some test samples. Keep in mind that there may be multiple valid solutions. Remove at most 7 from:

@TITLE:RGB to XYZ and LAB colours conversion
@CONTENT:I'm having problems converting colours from RGB to LAB space It should be straight forward using the formulas from here, only I'm getting back the wrong values RGB = 56,79,132 X = 8.592 Y = 8.099 Z = 22.940 and CIE-L*ab as L* 34.188 a* 8.072 b* -32.478 This is my code; but I can't see where I'm going wrong.

@TITLE:How to reference values with the same name from different modules
@CONTENT:If I have some modules which defines the same value object: var m1 = angular.module('m1', []);
m1.value('test', 'AAA');

var m2 = angular.module('m2', []);
m2.value('test', 'BBB');
 Notice m1 and m2 both have the same value test. Then in the main module, I depend on them two: var app = angular.module('angularjs-starter', ['m1','m2']);

app.controller('MainCtrl', function($scope, test) {
  $scope.test = test;
});
 And the HTML is very simple: <body ng-controller="MainCtrl">
 [{{test}}]
</body>
 It will show[BBB] in the final page. I can see that the value test of m1 has been overrode by the one of m2. You can see a live demo here: http://plnkr.co/edit/u7u8p0nYqq9CvNxWKv5G?p=preview Is there any way to show the values of test both from m1 and m2 in the same page?

@CONTENT:Update: see bottom of this question for a complete answer. I want to run a secondary thread, so that my main thread and my secondary thread perform operations alternatively (no, I don't want to do all the operations in the main thread, it is for a unit test). I came up to two different solutions, I don't know which is the best, and I have questions regarding the first one: Using Exchanger I came up to something using an Exchanger (while I don't want to exchange only one object). @Test

                //start of the synchronization 
                int turn = 1;
                while (turn != 2) {
                    turn = this.exchanger.exchange(turn);
                }

                //do some work and set my various variables
                ...

                //main thread's turn
                turn = 1;
                this.exchanger.exchange(turn);
                //wait for this thread's turn
                while (turn != 2) {
                    turn = this.exchanger.exchange(turn);
                }

                //redo some other work and reset the various variables
                ...

                this.exchanger.exchange(turn);

 Question: Am I correct that the exchange method performs memory synchronization, just as much as using a Lock? Using Condition Another solution using a Condition: @Test

    class ThreadTest extends Thread {
        //declare some various attributes that will be set

        public final Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();
        public final Condition oneAtATime = lock.newCondition();
        public int turn = 1;

        @Override
        public void run() {
            this.lock.lock();
            try {
                //do some work and set my various variables
                ...

                //main thread's turn
                this.turn = 1;
                this.oneAtATime.signal();

                //wait for this thread's turn
                while (this.turn != 2) {
                    this.oneAtATime.await();
                }

                //redo some other work and reset the various variables
                ...

                //main thread's turn
                this.turn = 1;
                this.oneAtATime.signal();

            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            } finally {
                this.lock.unlock();
            }
        }
    }


    ThreadTest test = new ThreadTest();
    test.lock.lock();
    try {
        //some work in the main thread

        test.oneAtATime.signal();
        //wait for this thread's turn

            test.oneAtATime.await();
        }

 It seems to me a bit more complicated. Conclusion What do you think is the best solution? Am I doing it right, or do I miss another obvious solution? I didn't use a CountDownLatch as I want to run several operations alternatively, and the CountDownLatch cannot be reset. And I didn't find that the CyclicBarrier was making the code simpler... (actually I didn't totally understand how to use it, but it didn't look simpler than using Exchanger or Condition) Thank you. Update @Cl?ment MATHIEU provided different examples of how to achieve this, in comments of its accepted answer, see: https://gist.github.com/cykl/5131021 There are three examples, one using a CyclicBarrier, another one using an Exchanger, and a last one using 2 Semaphores. While he is right to say that the "more expressive is the semaphore based one", I chose to use an Exchanger for simplicity. My unit test became: @Test
public void launchMyTest() {
    /**
     * An anonymous class to set some variables from a different thread
     */
    class ThreadTest extends Thread {
        //declare some various attributes that will be set
        //NOT DECLARED VOLATILE
        ...
        public final Exchanger<Integer> exchanger = new Exchanger<Integer>();

        @Override
        public void run() {
            try {
                //do some work and set my various variables
                ...

                //main thread's turn
                this.exchanger.exchange(null);
                //wait for this thread's turn
                this.exchanger.exchange(null);

                //redo some other work and reset the various variables
                ...

                //main thread's turn
                this.exchanger.exchange(null);

            } catch (InterruptedException e) {

@TITLE:enum implementation inside interface - Java
@CONTENT:I have a question about putting a Java enum in the interface. To make it clearer, please see the following code: public interface Thing{
   public enum Number{
       one(1), two(2), three(3);
       private int value;
       private Number(int value) {
            this.value = value;
       }
       public int getValue(){
        return value;
       }
   }

   public Number getNumber();
   public void method2();
   ...
}
 I know that an interface consists of methods with empty bodies. However, the enum I used here needs a constructor and a method to get an associated value. In this example, the proposed interface will not just consist of methods with empty bodies. Is this implementation allowed? I am not sure if I should put the enum class inside the interface or the class that implements this interface. If I put the enum in the class that implements this interface, then the method public Number getNumber() needs to return the type of enum, which would force me to import the enum in the interface.
@CODE:public interface Thing{
   public enum Number{
       one(1), two(2), three(3);
       private int value;
       private Number(int value) {
            this.value = value;
       }
       public int getValue(){
        return value;
       }
   }

@TITLE:CSS3 translate out of screen
@CONTENT:For a number of projects now I have had elements on the page which I want to translate out of the screen area (have them fly out of the document). In proper code this should be possible just by adding a class to the relevant element after which the css would handle the rest. The problem lies in the fact that if for example .block.hide{
    -webkit-transform:translateY(-10000px);
}
 is used the element will first of all fly out of the screen unnecessarily far and with an unnecessarily high speed. And purely from an aesthetic point of view there's a lot left to be desired (Theoretically speaking for example a screen with a height of 10000px could be introduced one day in the future). (Update) The problem why percentages can't be used is that 100% is relative to the element itself, rather than to the parent element/screen size. And containing the element in a full-sized parent would be possible, but would create a mess with click events. And after a few answers, allow me to point out that I am talking about translations, not about position:absolute css3 transitions (which are all fine, but once you get enough of them they stop being fun). What aesthetically pleasing solutions to allow an element to translate out of a screen in a fixed amount of time can you guys think of? Example code can be found in this jsfiddle demonstrating the basic concept. http://jsfiddle.net/ATcpw/ (see my own answer below for a bit more information)
@CODE:.block.hide{
    -webkit-transform:translateY(-10000px);

@LINK:/questions/15316110/express-js-routes-explanation
@TITLE:express.js routes explanation
@CONTENT:I was looking at express.js source code, to find out how it maps named route parameters to req.params properties. For those who don't know, in express.js you can define routes with named parameters, make them optional, only allow the ones with specific format (and more): app.get("/user/:id/:name?/:age(\\d+)", function (req, res) {
    console.log("ID is", req.params.id);
    console.log("Name is", req.params.name || "not specified!");
    console.log("Age is", req.params.age);
});
 I realized that the heart of this functionality is a method called pathRegexp() defined in lib/utils.js. The method definition is as follows: function pathRegexp(path, keys, sensitive, strict) {
    if (path instanceof RegExp) return path;
    if (Array.isArray(path)) path = '(' + path.join('|') + ')';
    path = path
        .concat(strict ? '' : '/?')
        .replace(/\/\(/g, '(?:/')
        .replace(/(\/)?(\.)?:(\w+)(?:(\(.*?\)))?(\?)?(\*)?/g, function (_, slash, format, key, capture, optional, star) {
            keys.push({ name: key, optional: !! optional });
            slash = slash || '';
            return ''
                + (optional ? '' : slash)
                + '(?:'
                + (optional ? slash : '')
                + (format || '') + (capture || (format && '([^/.]+?)' || '([^/]+?)')) + ')'
                + (optional || '')
                + (star ? '(/*)?' : '');
        })
        .replace(/([\/.])/g, '\\$1')
        .replace(/\*/g, '(.*)');
    return new RegExp('^' + path + '$', sensitive ? '' : 'i');
}
 The important part is the regex on line 7, /(\/)?(\.)?:(\w+)(?:(\(.*?\)))?(\?)?(\*)?/g which groups the matched portions of pathname this way: slash???? the / symbol???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? format?? I don't know what is the purpose of this one, explanation needed.???????????????????????????????????? key?????? the word (ie. \w+) after the : symbol??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? capture a regex written in front of the key. Should be wrapped in parenthesis (ex. (.\\d+)) optional the ? symbol after the key???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? star?????? the * symbol????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? and the callback handler builds a regex from the groups above. Now the question is, what is the purpose of format here? My understanding according to the following line: (format || '') + (capture || (format && '([^/.]+?)' || '([^/]+?)'))
 and the mentioned regex is, if you put a . symbol after the slash group and don't specify a match condition (the regex wrapped in parenthesis after the key), the generated regex matches the rest of path until it gets to a . or / symbol. So what's the point? I'm asking this, because: I want to extract and use this method in my app and want to fully understand how it works before using it. I didn't find anything on express.js documentation about it. I'm just curious :)
@CODE:req.params app.get("/user/:id/:name?/:age(\\d+)", function (req, res) {
    console.log("ID is", req.params.id);
    console.log("Name is", req.params.name || "not specified!");
    console.log("Age is", req.params.age);
}); pathRegexp() function pathRegexp(path, keys, sensitive, strict) {
    if (path instanceof RegExp) return path;
    if (Array.isArray(path)) path = '(' + path.join('|') + ')';
    path = path
        .concat(strict ? '' : '/?')
        .replace(/\/\(/g, '(?:/')
        .replace(/(\/)?(\.)?:(\w+)(?:(\(.*?\)))?(\?)?(\*)?/g, function (_, slash, format, key, capture, optional, star) {
            keys.push({ name: key, optional: !! optional });
            slash = slash || '';
            return ''
                + (optional ? '' : slash)
                + '(?:'
                + (optional ? slash : '')

@TITLE:Replace the argument with a list in R [duplicate]
@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: Can you pass a vector to a vararg?: Vector to sprintf 1 answer Some times there is a function which has an arbitrary number of arguments. For example, the bootstrapPage function of package shiny. If I have a data.frame and I want to create one widget for one row, then I have not figured out a pretty way to pass the number of arguments according to the row number of the data.frame. So far, I generate the script and use the trick of eval(parse(text="...")) In fact, the structure of arguments passed to function in R (key and value) is similar to a list, so I am wondering if there is a way to pass the argument as a list in R. More specifically, if I have a function f and a list argv, is there a way to pass the objects in argv to f according to the matching of the name of argv and the name of the arguments of f, and the position in argv and the position in the arguments of f? For example, let f <- function(a, b) a + b
argv <- list(a=1, b=2)
 How should I pass the argv to f which is equivalent to f(a=argv$a, b=argv$b)? Or if we have: f <- function(a, b, ...) { # some codes }
argv <- list(a = 1, b = 2, 3, 4, 5)
 How should I pass the argv to f which is equivalent to f(a=argv$a, b=argv$b, argv[[3]], argv[[4]], argv[[5]])? Thanks!
@CODE:bootstrapPage eval(parse(text="...")) list f argv argv f argv f argv f f <- function(a, b) a + b
argv <- list(a=1, b=2) argv f f(a=argv$a, b=argv$b) f <- function(a, b, ...) { # some codes }

@TITLE:How can I make a non-blocking request for an exclusive lock using File#flock?
@CONTENT:How Should I Request a Non-Blocking Lock? Why doesn't Ruby's File#flock work as expected when separate attempts are made to lock a file? Locking the file in a block is not the correct solution for this issue because the point is to show the behavior of locking on persistent locks. Using File#flock inside a block releases the lock when the block exits, so it doesn't demonstrate the problem properly. File#flock fails in a variety of ways, especially when requesting a non-blocking lock. Some examples follow. Failing Examples with File#flock Infinite wait when using multiple exclusive locks, since #flock doesn't provide a way to timeout a lock request. # First lock succeeds.
f1 = File.open('foo', File::RDWR|File::CREAT, 0644)
f1.flock(File::LOCK_EX)
# => 0

# This never returns.
f2 = File.open('foo', File::RDWR|File::CREAT, 0644)
f2.flock(File::LOCK_EX)
 Asking for a non-blocking lock while the file is exclusively-locked results in an invalid argument exception. f1 = File.open('foo', File::RDWR|File::CREAT, 0644)
f1.flock(File::LOCK_EX)
# => 0

f2 = File.open('foo', File::RDWR|File::CREAT, 0644)
f2.flock(File::LOCK_NB)
# => Errno::EINVAL: Invalid argument - foo
 The documentation says that #flock "Locks or unlocks a file according to locking_constant (a logical or of the values in the table below)." However, a Logical OR raises Errno::EINVAL or Errno::EBADF depending on platform. f1 = File.open('foo', File::RDWR|File::CREAT, 0644)
f1.flock(File::LOCK_EX)
# => 0

f2 = File.open('foo', File::RDWR|File::CREAT, 0644)
f2.flock(File::LOCK_NB || File::LOCK_EX)
# => Errno::EINVAL: Invalid argument - foo
 Native File#flock Solution Preferred While one might use the Timeout module to raise Timeout::Error when unable to obtain an exclusive lock, it seems like File#flock ought to be able to solve this issue natively. So, how is one actually supposed to request an exclusive lock without blocking?
@CODE:# First lock succeeds.
f1 = File.open('foo', File::RDWR|File::CREAT, 0644)
f1.flock(File::LOCK_EX)
# => 0

# This never returns.
f2 = File.open('foo', File::RDWR|File::CREAT, 0644)
f2.flock(File::LOCK_EX) f1 = File.open('foo', File::RDWR|File::CREAT, 0644)
f1.flock(File::LOCK_EX)
# => 0

f2 = File.open('foo', File::RDWR|File::CREAT, 0644)
f2.flock(File::LOCK_NB)
# => Errno::EINVAL: Invalid argument - foo Errno::EINVAL Errno::EBADF f1 = File.open('foo', File::RDWR|File::CREAT, 0644)

mencoder video_draft.avi -o video_final.avi -forceidx -ovc copy -oac copy
Now you're video_final.avi file will be right to go.
 but it doesn't work for me, the first video is converted and that's it.
@CODE:cat file1.avi file2.avi file3.avi > video_draft.avi
after appending the data together using cat above, you need to re-index the draft movie like this:

mencoder video_draft.avi -o video_final.avi -forceidx -ovc copy -oac copy
Now you're video_final.avi file will be right to go.

@TITLE:Delete associated model with ember-data
@CONTENT:I have two models: App.User = DS.Model.create({
  comments: DS.hasMany('App.Comment')
});

App.Comment = DS.Model.create({
  user: DS.belongsTo('App.User')
});
 When a user is deleted, it also will delete all its comments on the backend, so I should delete them from the client-side identity map. I'm listing all the comments on the system from another place, so after deleting a user it would just crash. Is there any way to specify this kind of dependency on the association? Thanks!

@TITLE:Inconsistent browser retry behaviour for timed out POST requests
@CONTENT:I am experiencing occasional retries for a POST request, when there is no response from server due to timeout. All modern browsers have retry logic for idempotent requests (GET, HEAD, etc) but I am unable to reason out why it happens for a POST request. I am testing this case using a simple node.js server with 3 routes and chrome browser . /       : gives a html page with jquery and code snippets to fire ajax requests
/hi     : gives a text response 'hello'
/sleep  : request will timeout without any response 
 By default, node.js http server times out a request after 2 minutes. retry.js var http = require('http');
var server = http.createServer();

server.on('request', function(req, res) {
    console.log(new Date() + ' ' + req.method + ' request on ' + req.url);

    if (req.url === '/sleep') {
        console.log('!!! sleeping');
    } else if (req.url === '/') {

Fri Mar 01 2013 12:24:21 GMT+0530 (IST) POST request on /sleep
!!! sleeping
 Firing it again, errors out in 2 mins without any retry. Fri Mar 01 2013 12:30:01 GMT+0530 (IST) POST request on /sleep
!!! sleeping ?
 It's not getting retried until we fire a request to /hi (or any other url) that results in a response. And retry happens for just one subsequent request to /sleep. In browser, the network tab shows the pattern like /hi - success 
/sleep - cancelled - 4 mins (retry happens)
/sleep - cancelled - 2 mins (no retry)
/sleep - cancelled - 2 mins (no retry)
/hi - success 
/sleep - cancelled - 4 mins (retry happens)
/sleep - cancelled - 2 mins (no retry)
/sleep - cancelled - 2 mins (no retry)
 Question Though we need to design our web app to tolerate these extra requests (either by browsers or any other intermediaries), this inconsistent browser retries looks weird. I had observed this behaviour in chrome (v16 & v24) & firefox. Can someone help me to understand the browser retry logic behind timed out non-idempotent requests ? Other relevant stackoverflow questions What happens when no response is received for a request? I'm seeing retries

@TITLE:Find consecutive sequence of zeros in R
@CONTENT:I have a data.frame really big (actually a data.table). Now, to simplify things, let's assume my data.frame is just as follow: x <- c(1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, NA, NA, 0) 
y <- c(1 ,0 ,NA, NA, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0)
mydf <- data.frame(rbind(x,y))
 I'd like to identify in which row (if any) the last sequence is formed by three consecutive zeros, not considering NAs. So, in the example above, the first row has three consecutive zeros in the last sequence, but not the second one. I know how to do that if only I have a vector (not a data.frame): runs <-  rle(x[is.na(x)==F])

runs$lengths[length(runs$lengths)] > 2 & runs$values[length(runs$lengths)]==0
 I obviously can do a loop and I'll have what I want. But it'll be incredibly inefficient and my actual data.frame is quite big. So, any ideas on how to do in a fastest way? I guess apply can be useful, but I'm not able to thinking of using it right now. Also, maybe there is a data.table way of doing this? ps.: Actually, this data.frame is a reshaped version of my original data.table. If somehow I can do the job with the data.frame in the original format, it's ok. To see how is my data.frame originally, just think of it as: x <- c(1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0) 
y <- c(1 ,0 , 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0)

myOriginalDf <- data.frame(value=c(x,y), id=rep(c('x','y'), c(length(x), length(y))))

@CONTENT:Due to certain reasons i have manually performed transaction commit and roll back using Spring PlatformTransactionManager, what i need to do is setup a hook so that a post commit action takes place after transaction has been committed. By looking at:  void commit(TransactionStatus status) throws TransactionException;
 I cant see how i can determine a transaction was successful other than assumming it so if no expception are thrown. And i could use AOP as one option, but what about programmitcally doing it, maybe using callback method?

@TITLE:Backbone Marionette, Composite View initializes twice
@CONTENT:I'm using a composite view that has $.dialog called on it's $el. The composite view is then listing items from a collection. Now i've tried multiple ways to render the collection items: fetching from outside the composite view before and after attaching it to the view, fetching inside the view, preloading the collection from my server script, etc... all seem to work but the same problem occurs.. as soon as the composite view see's this collection, it calls it's own initialize function again... I fully understand that the render function will be called on a collection reset or add... but the initialize??? i have absolutely no idea why this is happening. showCustomFieldSelect: function(e){

@TITLE:Javascript Gallery that automatically uses all large images on page
@CONTENT:I have a site with lots of images on one large page. The easiest would be a Script that i could include, that automatically searches through that same page and uses all images larger than 100px to create a slideshow gallery from them. Anyone knows such an easy script, that doesent need any programming skills? I found this for a start: jQuery get all images within an element larger than a specific size To get all images larger that some size you can use something like this: var allImages = $('img', yourDivElement)

var largeImages = allImages.filter(function(){
  return ($(this).width() > 70) || ($(this).height() > 70)
})
 Update: After some more research, I found this the most fitting: Fancybox Gallery It should be implemented on this page: http://www.kathrinhoffmann.com/

@TITLE:Fragment getView() always returning null for Fragments created by a FragmentStatePagerAdapter
@CONTENT:I have been reading a lot about fragments. Have found other people having problems retrieving fragments view because null was always returned but no answer solved my problem. What I'm trying to do is create a image gallery. I have a Fragment that holds a image view. To show the fragments I use a android.support.v4.view.ViewPager. And to feed the ViewPager I use a android.support.v4.app.FragmentStatePagerAdapter. The problem is that when everything is build and the images are shown I want to save the current shown image to disk. So I need to get the current fragment imageview but I can't because fragment.getView() always is null, the activity associated with the fragment is null too and I can't figure out why is it. Here some code to see if anyone could help here: This is my Fragment: public class ImageViewURLFragment extends Fragment 
{
    String _url;

    @Override
    public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater,
            ViewGroup container, Bundle savedInstanceState) 
    {
        // The last two arguments ensure LayoutParams are inflated
        // properly.
        View rootView = new ImageViewURL(getActivity(), _url);

        return rootView;
    }

    public void setImageURL(String imgURL)
    {
        _url=imgURL;
    }
}
 And this my adapter: public class ImageViewURLCustomAdapter extends FragmentStatePagerAdapter 
{
    List<String> _urls=new ArrayList<String>();

    public ImageViewURLCustomAdapter(FragmentManager fm) 
    {
        super(fm);
    }

    @Override
    public Fragment getItem(int i) 
    {
        ImageViewURLFragment fragment = new ImageViewURLFragment();
        fragment.setImageURL(_urls.get(i));

        return fragment;
    }

    public String getItemUrl(int i)
    {
        return _urls.get(i);
    }

    @Override
    public int getCount() {
        return _urls.size();
    }

    @Override
    public CharSequence getPageTitle(int position) {
        return "OBJECT " + (position + 1);
    }

    public void addImageURL(String url)
    {
        _urls.add(url);
    }
}
 And this is the main activity, notice the comment with the get: public class MainActivity extends FragmentActivity 
{
    ImageViewURLCustomAdapter _iva=null;
    ViewPager _vp=null;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)
    {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        _iva = new ImageViewURLCustomAdapter(

        _vp = (ViewPager) findViewById(R.id.viewpager);
        _vp.setAdapter(_iva);
    }


    @Override
    public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu) 
    {
        // Inflate the menu; this adds items to the action bar if it is present.
        getMenuInflater().inflate(R.menu.activity_main, menu);
        return true;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean onOptionsItemSelected(MenuItem item) 
    {
        if(item.getItemId()==R.id.saveToSD)
        {
            int index= _vp.getCurrentItem();
            Fragment fragment=_iva.getItem(index);

            //THis is where I need to get fragment view, but always returns null
                    View view= fragment.getView();
            ImageView iv=(ImageView)view.findViewWithTag("imageView");
            Bitmap bmp=iv.getDrawingCache();


        }


        return super.onOptionsItemSelected(item);
    }
}

@LINK:/questions/14741700/work-with-two-separate-redis-instances-with-sidekiq
@TITLE:Work with two separate redis instances with sidekiq?
@CONTENT:Good afternoon, I have two separate, but related apps. They should both have their own background queues (read: separate Sidekiq & Redis processes). However, I'd like to occasionally be able to push jobs onto app2's queue from app1. From a simple queue/push perspective, it would be easy to do this if app1 did not have an existing Sidekiq/Redis stack: # In a process, far far away

# Configure client 
Sidekiq.configure_client do |config|
  config.redis = { :url => 'redis://redis.example.com:7372/12', :namespace => 'mynamespace' }
end

# Push jobs without class definition 
Sidekiq::Client.push('class' => 'Example::Workers::Trace', 'args' => ['hello!'])

# Push jobs overriding default's 
Sidekiq::Client.push('queue' => 'example', 'retry' => 3, 'class' =>     'Example::Workers::Trace', 'args' => ['hello!'])
 However given that I would already have called a Sidekiq.configure_client and Sidekiq.configure_server from app1, there's probably a step in between here where something needs to happen. Obviously I could just take the serialization and normalization code straight from inside Sidekiq and manually push onto app2's redis queue, but that seems like a brittle solution. I'd like to be able to use the Client.push functionality. I suppose my ideal solution would be someting like: SidekiqTWO.configure_client { remote connection..... } SidekiqTWO::Client.push(job....) Or even: $redis_remote = remote_connection..... Sidekiq::Client.push(job, $redis_remote) Obviously a bit facetious, but that's my ideal use case. Thanks!

 Edit 3: I'm still looking for a way to reset my CoreData as if I deleted the entire app and started it up again. The usual ways of doing so are not working for my case. And there are 2 sqllite files. There are hints of a migration that took place at some point in the application but I'm not too sure when and how. Error logs show nothing useful. I'm not looking for the most efficient way. Just the way. Help me out and the bounty is yours. Edit 4: FINAL RESULT: It seemed my legacy code had a second ManagedObjectContext instantiated. The moment I retrieved it and did the flush-function with it. Both sqlite-files disappeared as was needed. Thanks to all that put effort in my problem.

@TITLE:How do you insert a Postgres enum value using Clojure JDBC?
@CONTENT:For example, here is a product table in PostgreSQL with status as an enum: create type product_status as enum ('InStock', 'OutOfStock');

create table product (
    pid            int primary key default nextval('product_pid_seq'),
    sku            text not null unique,
    name           text not null,
    description    text not null,
    quantity       int not null,
    cost           numeric(10,2) not null,
    price          numeric(10,2) not null,
    weight         numeric(10,2),
    status         product_status not null
);
 Typical Clojure code to insert a product would be: (def prod-12345 {:sku "12345"
                 :name "My Product"
                 :description "yada yada yada"
                 :quantity 100
                 :cost 42.00
                 :price 59.00
                 :weight 0.3
                 :status "InStock"})

(sql/with-connection db-spec
   (sql/insert-record :product prod-12345))
 However, status is an enum so you can't insert it as a normal string without casting it to an enum: 'InStock'::product_status
 I know you can do it with a prepared statement, such as: INSERT INTO product (name, status) VALUES (?, ?::product_status)
 But is there a way to do it without using a prepared statement?
@CODE:create type product_status as enum ('InStock', 'OutOfStock');

create table product (
    pid            int primary key default nextval('product_pid_seq'),
    sku            text not null unique,
    name           text not null,
    description    text not null,
    quantity       int not null,
    cost           numeric(10,2) not null,
    price          numeric(10,2) not null,
    weight         numeric(10,2),
    status         product_status not null
); (def prod-12345 {:sku "12345"
                 :name "My Product"
                 :description "yada yada yada"
                 :quantity 100
                 :cost 42.00
                 :price 59.00
                 :weight 0.3
                 :status "InStock"})

@LINK:/questions/14697497/streaming-large-images-using-asp-net-webapi
@TITLE:Streaming large images using ASP.Net Webapi
@CONTENT:We are trying to return large image files using ASP.Net WebApi and using the following code to stream the bytes to the client. public class RetrieveAssetController : ApiController
{

    // GET api/retrieveasset/5
    public HttpResponseMessage GetAsset(int id)
    {
        HttpResponseMessage httpResponseMessage = new HttpResponseMessage();
        string filePath = "SomeImageFile.jpg";

        MemoryStream memoryStream = new MemoryStream();

        FileStream file = new FileStream(filePath, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read);

        byte[] bytes = new byte[file.Length];

        file.Read(bytes, 0, (int)file.Length);

        memoryStream.Write(bytes, 0, (int)file.Length);

        file.Close();

        httpResponseMessage.Content =  new ByteArrayContent(memoryStream.ToArray());

        httpResponseMessage.Content.Headers.ContentType = new MediaTypeHeaderValue("application/octet-stream");

        httpResponseMessage.StatusCode = HttpStatusCode.OK;

        return httpResponseMessage;
    }
}
 The above code works fine but some of the files that we deal with could be 2 GB and upwards in size resulting in connection timeouts. We have used code similar to below in the past (using HttpHandlers) to chunk the response to the response stream to keep the connection alive with success. byte[] b = new byte[this.BufferChunkSize];
int byteCountRead = 0;

while ((byteCountRead = stream.Read(b, 0, b.Length)) > 0)
{
    if (!response.IsClientConnected) break;

    response.OutputStream.Write(b, 0, byteCountRead);
    response.Flush();
}
 How can we use a similar technique using the new WebAPI programming model shown earlier? Thank you in advance

        memoryStream.Write(bytes, 0, (int)file.Length);

        file.Close();

        httpResponseMessage.Content =  new ByteArrayContent(memoryStream.ToArray());

        httpResponseMessage.Content.Headers.ContentType = new MediaTypeHeaderValue("application/octet-stream");

        httpResponseMessage.StatusCode = HttpStatusCode.OK;

        return httpResponseMessage;
    }

{
    if (!response.IsClientConnected) break;

    response.OutputStream.Write(b, 0, byteCountRead);
    response.Flush();

@CONTENT:At times during development, it would be really nice to prevent HTTP 304 responses (in favor of 200's), and cause the Connect/Express static middleware to read every response from the filesystem, rather than do any caching at all.

@TITLE:How to request app info from Google Play store without authentication
@CONTENT:I've done some research and stumbled across the following (maybe unofficial) url which is used to query app details from android play store. But based on the unofficial google market api I guess this one is using authentication token http://android.clients.google.com/market/api/ApiRequest
 There is obviously a way to request android app details without logging into ones google account - that's how Google play site works when browsed in a web browser. I was unable to find any guidance on how to actually do that. The project I develop cannot have any unofficial libraries or codes in it, it also cannot use any private android API. I also came up to the following link, which obviously is not an official google api link (in other words not 100% trustworthy that it wouldn't change without prior notice) https://androidquery.appspot.com/api/market?app=(put the package name here)
 But I guess any possible solution should be something similar to what this link is internally performing. So, how to construct a valid request to google play store to retrieve app info (request url, parameters, parameter formats, cookies, etc.)?

@LINK:/questions/14545924/memory-settings-with-thousands-of-threads
@TITLE:Memory settings with thousands of threads
@CONTENT:I'm playing around with the JVM (Oracle 1.7 64 bit) on a Linux box (AMD 6 Core, 16 GB RAM) to see how the number of threads in an application affects performance. I'm hoping to measure at which point context switching degrades performance. I have created a little application that creates a thread execution pool: Executors.newFixedThreadPool(numThreads)
 I adjust numThreads everytime I run the program, to see the effect it has. I then submit numThread jobs (instances of java.util.concurrent.Callable) to the pool. Each one increments an AtomicInteger, does some work (creates an array of random integers and shuffles it), and then sleeps a while. The idea is to simulate a web service call. Finally, the job resubmits itself to the pool, so that I always have numThreads jobs working. I am measuring the throughput, as in the number of jobs that are processed per minute. With several thousand threads, I can process up to 400,000 jobs a minute. Above 8000 threads, the results start to vary a lot, suggesting that context switching is becoming a problem. But I can continue to increase the number of threads to 30,000 and still get higher throughput (between 420,000 and 570,000 jobs per minute). Now the question: I get a java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Unable to create new native thread with more than about 31,000 jobs. I have tried setting -Xmx6000M which doesn't help. I tried playing with -Xss but that doesn't help either. I've read that ulimit can be useful, but increasing with ulimit -u 64000 didn't change anything. For info: [root@apollo ant]# ulimit -a

 So the question #1: What do I have to do to be able to create a bigger thread pool? Question #2: At what stage should I expect to see context switching really reducing throughput and causing the process to grind to a halt? Here are some results, after I modified it to do a little more processing (as was suggested) and started recording average response times (as was also suggested). // ( (n_cores x t_request) / (t_request - t_wait) ) + 1
// 300 ms wait, 10ms work, roughly 310ms per job => ideal response time, 310ms
// ideal num threads = 1860 / 10 + 1 = 187 threads

 I interpret them as: 1) Even though the application is sleeping for 96.7% of the time, that still leaves lots of thread switching to be done 2) Context switching is measurable, and is shown in the response time. What is interesting here is that When tuning an app, you'd might choose the acceptable response time, say 400ms, and increase number of threads until you get that response time, which in this case would let the app process around 95 thousand requests a minute. Often people say that the ideal number of threads is near the number of cores. In apps that have wait time (blocked threads, say waiting for a database or web service to respond), the calculation needs to consider that (see my equation above). But even that theoretical ideal isn't an actual ideal, when you look at the results or when you tune to a specific response time.

@TITLE:Django Serialize Queryset to JSON to construct RESTful response with only field information and id
@CONTENT:I currently have a Post model with 'title' and 'summary' fields. I'm retrieving all the Posts and returning them as JSON as part of a RESTful API interface. Here's the basic approach from django.core import serializers

def list_posts(request):
    posts = Post.objects.filter(owner=authenticated_user)
    serialized = serializers.serialize("json", posts, fields=('title', 'summary'))
    return HttpResponse(serialized, mimetype='application/json')
 And I'm getting the following response back when I visit the corresponding route. Current Response [{"pk": 4, "model": "api.post", "fields": {"summary": "Testing", "title": "My Test"}}, {"pk": 5, "model": "api.post", "fields": {"summary": "testing again", "title": "Another test"}}]
 This technically contains all the information my client-side needs to construct models (I'm using Backbone and could use collection.parse to construct what I need, but the server side should be responsible for structuring the response nicely). What troubles me about this is that it does not look like the standard API responses I'm used to seeing in reputable APIs. I think a JSON response like the following would be more 'standard'. Desired Response [{'summary': 'Testing', 'id': 4, 'title': 'My test'}, {'summary': 'My Test', 'id':5, 'title': 'Another test'}]
 The output from serialize does not seem quite right for returning a collection of model instances in JSON as a response from an API call and this seems like a fairly common need. I'd like to return the fields information along with the id (or pk, if it must be called pk).

@TITLE:JQuery-Mobile and ASP.Net - AJAX or Postback?
@CONTENT:I've been developing ASP.Net for the past and until recently come across a mobile project. Jquery-Mobile seems perfect as a framework for this, so I just dived into it. Currently I'm using ASP.Net approach to put server controls on a page, then use jqm to enhance those controls to make them looks mobile. I actually do postback to collect form data and process them in code-behind. To avoid a full page refresh, I had to mix them with updatepanel too. Somehow I got them working but deep down I just feel this isn't the right way (or efficient way) of doing it. There's too much complication of mixing things up to get them right, so I think maybe I should just avoid postback and do everything-else in pure AJAX requests? $.ajax({
 type: 'POST',
  url: "/GetName",
  data: "{}",
  contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8"

})
.success(function (response) {
  alert(response);
});
 Code-behind: [WebMethod ()] 
public String GetName()
{ return "Jack"; }
 Questions: This works, but is this the better way to go with jQuery-Mobile websites, or this is just another bad example? Is UpdatePanel and postback a bad idea for this scenario? (I know they work) If AJAX is preferred, how do I go about populating a dropdownlist on pageload (Not server control)? Sending an AJAX request to populate dropdownlist on $(document).ready() seems stupid to me What I'm looking for is rules of thumb of developing a mobile site, I don't want to steer too far away from what should be doing right. Your inputs are very much appreciated. Thanks.

@TITLE:How to use jasmine to test an async function that takes a long time to respond?
@CONTENT:I'm using a function to fetch data from webapi. Basicly using $.ajax. I'm now testing it with waits() like this: describe('xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx', function () {
  var r;
  it('fetchFilter', function () {
    runs(function () {
      model.fetch(opts)

    runs(function () {

});
 The problem is: It's not guaranteed that waits(2000) will do the job well. Due to various reasons(network connections, algorithm efficiency of the api it self, etc.), I may have to waits(5000) or more, or for some models waits(500) is enough. And the most annoying thing is that it's all out of control. A lot of waits() makes the test-specs-runs waste a lot of time waiting. The time of running the whole suite is too long to accept. Is there some best practice of doing there kind of things? PS: I know that unit test should not be applied to some function that relies on webapi or database. But I'm working with a single-page-js-heavy-webapp. The data fetching process is as important as how I will consume them with js models.
@CODE:$.ajax waits() describe('xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx', function () {
  var r;
  it('fetchFilter', function () {
    runs(function () {
      model.fetch(opts)
      .done(function(data) {
        r = data;
      });
    });

    waits(2000);

    runs(function () {

@TITLE:Moving from sourceCpp to a package w/Rcpp
@CONTENT:I currently have a .cpp file that I can compile using sourceCpp(). As expected the corresponding R function is created and the code works as expected. Here it is: #include <Rcpp.h> 
using namespace Rcpp;

// [[Rcpp::export]]
NumericVector exampleOne(NumericVector vectorOne, NumericVector vectorTwo){

    NumericVector outputVector = vectorOne + vectorTwo; 

    return outputVector;
}
 I am now converting my project over to a package using Rcpp. So I created the skeleton with rStudio and started looking at how to convert things over. In Hadley's excellent primer on Cpp, he says in section "Using Rcpp in a Package": If your packages uses the Rcpp::export attribute then one additional step in the package build process is requried. The compileAttributes function scans the source files within a package for Rcpp::export attributes and generates the code required to export the functions to R. You should re-run compileAttributes whenever functions are added, removed, or have their signatures changed. Note that if you build your package using RStudio or devtools then this step occurs automatically. So it looks like the code that compiled with sourceCpp() should work pretty much as is in a package. I created the corresponding R file. exampleOne <- function(vectorOne, vectorTwo){
    outToR <- .Call("exampleOne", vectorOne, vectorTwo, PACKAGE ="testPackage")
    outToR
}
 Then I (re)built the package and I get this error: Error in .Call("exampleOne", vectorOne, vectorTwo, PACKAGE = "voteR") : C symbol name "exampleOne" not in DLL for package "testPackage" Does anyone have an idea as to what else I need to do when taking code that compiles with sourceCpp() and then using it in a package? I should note that I have read: "Writing a package that uses Rcpp" http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/Rcpp/vignettes/Rcpp-package.pdf and understand the basic structure presented there. However, after looking at the RcppExamples source code, it appears that the structure in the vignettes is not exactly the same as that used in the example package. For example there are no .h files used. Also neither the vignette nor the source code use the [[Rcpp::export]] attribute. This all makes it difficult to track down exactly where my error is.
@CODE:.cpp sourceCpp() #include <Rcpp.h> 
using namespace Rcpp;

// [[Rcpp::export]]
NumericVector exampleOne(NumericVector vectorOne, NumericVector vectorTwo){

    NumericVector outputVector = vectorOne + vectorTwo;

@CONTENT:Short version: I'm using google's autocomplete places from the Google Places Library (here https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/places) and I need to tell when a user has selected a place from the auto-complete list and when they have clicked elsewhere, tabbed out, etc. My goal is to run a function when a user interacts with the input element but does not select an autocomplete option. More details: In looking at the documentation, it appears the only event is fired when (really, if) the places change, which happens after a (potentially long) server round trip. If the user doesn't select anything from the list, that event is never fired. (Docs at https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference?hl=fr#Autocomplete) I can attach a listener to the blur event for the input element the autocomplete attaches to, but the problem is that the blur event happens well before the places_changed event happens. So far have tried a number of things including listening for events on the autocomplete suggestions with something like the following: $('body').on('click', '.pac-item', function(){alert.log('yay!');});
 the google library apparently eats the events though. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

@CONTENT:So I have the following problem: Given a grid of x by y dimensions, calculate the number of routes through it that start in one corner (let's say top left) and end in another (bottom right) and pass through every vertex. So my current method just brute forces it by just trying every possible path and counting the ones that reach the finish and traverse every node. While it works, it's O(n^2) and gets unbelievably slow extremely quickly. I'm not sure how to do it combinatorially because of the requirement that the path traverse every vertex. I've looked up more complex algorithms, and Hierholzer's algorithm for calculating Eulerian paths seems somewhat related but not perfect because nodes cannot be traversed more than once for this. As it is, my program works, but badly, and I would like to make it more efficient. Are there better algorithms I could be using? Edit Thanks for the answers so far. Just to clarify, all nodes in the 2d grid are connected by n/e/s/w Also, the grid does not have to be a square

But for a while you need to keep both branches functional, so you are doing bug fixes and crucial feature additions to both of them, sometimes in a not symmetrical way. And at some point there comes a moment when you have to merge refactored branch onto the original one. What is the best technique to use in a situation like this? Is it still possible to keep the history clean? But more importantly what should have been my initial strategy in such scenario?

@CONTENT:I have a very basic question about django.db.models. In this official django tutorial, if you search for word "choice_set", you will see that variable "choice_set" is not declared anywhere, though magically, we can start using it in the code. I wonder, what does django.db.models.Model do that magically created the *_set variable, and what other variables does it create?

@CONTENT:I have a situation where i want the versioning to be dynamic at build time. Version Pattern: <year>.<month>.<day>.<hhmm> But i have read where the String value used in the Attribute is reparsed at compile time. Any advise on how to get this dynamic versioning completed?

<Assembly: AssemblyFileVersion(Year(Now) & "." & Month(Now()) & "." & Day(Now()) & "." & String.format("hhmm", now()))> 
 I know it wont work but should get the point acrossed.

@LINK:/questions/14196417/is-it-possible-to-extend-an-individual-object-in-smalltalk
@TITLE:Is it possible to extend an individual object in Smalltalk
@CONTENT:I'm doing research in Smalltalk reflection, and I was wondering if it was possible to extend an individual object like that would be possible for instance in Ruby. With this I mean a selector that only particular objects respond to. Here is some Ruby code that states what I mean. For clarification: in Ruby this open a virtual class for this object, and extends it with a new definition. The vital part here is that nothing changes to the class definition! o = Object.new
o.instance_eval {def foo;puts "foo";end}
o.foo #=> "foo"

#however this will fail:
m = Object.new
m.foo #=> NoMethod error
 More specifically my question is whether this is possible in standard Squeak/Pharo or other smalltalk implementations, without adding substantial structures or code to allow this. So with other words with regular reflective features that exist in Smalltalk. As an example, it is possible to add methods, remove methods, compile new code into a class, change instance variables and just about anything, but I haven't found a way to extend a single object. Test addInstVarNamed: #var.
Test compile: 'var ^var'.
t:= Test new.
Test instVarNames.
t instVarNamed: #var put: 666. 
t var. #=> 666
 If the answer is no, then explain why. I'm not looking for solving this problem but rather understanding why it isn't in smalltalk.
@CODE:o = Object.new
o.instance_eval {def foo;puts "foo";end}
o.foo #=> "foo"

#however this will fail:
m = Object.new
m.foo #=> NoMethod error Test addInstVarNamed: #var.
Test compile: 'var ^var'.
t:= Test new.
Test instVarNames.
t instVarNamed: #var put: 666. 
t var. #=> 666

@TITLE:How to display raw JSON data on a HTML page [duplicate]
@CONTENT:Possible Duplicate: JSON pretty print using JavaScript I'd like to display my raw JSON data on a HTML page just as JSONview does. For example, my raw json data is:   {
   "hey":"guy",
   "anumber":243,
   "anobject":{
      "whoa":"nuts",
      "anarray":[

 It comes from http://jsonview.com/, and what I want to achieve is like http://jsonview.com/example.json if you use Chrome and have installed the JSONView plugin. I've tried but failed to understand how it works. I'd like to use a JS script (CSS to highlight) to custom format my raw JSON data which is retrieved by ajax and finally put it on a HTML page in any position like into a div element. Are there any existing JS libraries that can achieve this? Or how to do it?
@CODE:{
   "hey":"guy",

@TITLE:Using RenderAction(actionname, values) in MVC4 issue
@CONTENT:I need to display some child objects (Items) of an entity Request. Instead of Request I found it better to pass in a view that contains more info than the original Request Entity. This view I called RequestInfo, it also contains the original Requests Id. Then in the MVC View I did : @model CAPS.RequestInfo
...    
@Html.RenderAction("Items", new { requestId = Model.Id })
 To Render : public PartialViewResult Items(int requestId)
{
    using (var db = new DbContext())
    {
        var items = db.Items.Where(x => x.Request.Id == requestId);
        return PartialView("_Items", items);
    }
}
 Which would display a generic list : @model IEnumerable<CAPS.Item>

<p>
    @Html.ActionLink("Create New", "Create")
</p>

@TITLE:How can I check for live updates without using setInterval/timeout?
@CONTENT:Building a social network, I'm trying to fetch live notifications. Currently, the site sends an AJAX request every few seconds using setInterval. It looks something like this: setInterval ( function(){
    url = base_dir+"/ajax/file.php";
    data = "data=someData";
    $.ajax({
        type: "POST",
        url: url,
        data: data,
        dataType: "json",
        beforeSend: function(x) {
            if(x && x.overrideMimeType) {
                x.overrideMimeType("application/json;charset=UTF-8");
            }
        },
        success: function(JSON){
            // retrieve data here   
        }
    });
}, 5000);
 That works perfectly, but I'm very worried about that creating servers overload. I tried the comet technique but for some reason it sends much more requests than the above code. Is there any other more useful technique for pushing this data live? EDIT: For implementing long polling I used the following (used the example mentioned here: http://techoctave.com/c7/posts/60-simple-long-polling-example-with-javascript-and-jquery): (function poll(){
    url = base_dir+"/ajax/file.php";
    data = "data=someData";
    $.ajax({
        type: "POST",
        url: url,
        data: data,
        dataType: "json",
        beforeSend: function(x) {
            if(x && x.overrideMimeType) {
                x.overrideMimeType("application/json;charset=UTF-8");
            }
        },
        success: function(JSON){
            // retrieve data here   
        },
complete: poll,
timeout: 5000
    });
})();
 There's a possibility that I might not get the comet principle right. PHP code: // Checks for new notifications, and updates the title and notifications bar if there are any
 private static function NotificationsCounter (){
    //self::$it_user_id                                     = query that retrieves my id for further checks;                                                        
    //$friend_requests_count                                = query that retrieves the friend requests count;
    //$updates_count                                        = query that retrieves the updates count;               
    $total_notifications                                    = $friend_requests_count+$updates_count;

    if ($total_notifications > 0) $addToTitle = "(".$total_notifications.")";
    else $addToTitle = "";

    if ($updates_count > 0) $counterHTML = "<span class='notification_counter' id='updates_counter' style='float: right;'>".$updates_count."</span>";
    else $counterHTML = "";

    $data = array("counter"=>$total_notifications,"addToTitle"=>$addToTitle,"counterHTML"=>$counterHTML,);
    echo json_encode($data); // parse to json and print
}

@TITLE:Is C++'s new operator reentrant (or async-safe)?
@CONTENT:The background is in this question of mine. Put shortly, I have to fork in a multithreaded C++ program, so I'd like to figure out how much I can do when restricted to reentrant functions only, and one of the most essential things is dynamic memory. So, malloc is known to be non-reentrant. But what about C++'s new? I googled for that with not many relevant results (mostly due to the difficulty to hit the correct "new"), but there is at least one claim that new is reentrant. There is also a relevant question concerning the whole C++ standard library with no satisfying answer. Edit: I guess the standard didn't say anything about this, so I'm mostly concerned about major implementations.

@TITLE:IBOutlet is nil inside custom UIView (Using STORYBOARD)
@CONTENT:I have custom UIView class. Inside it i have declared IBOutlet property for UIImageView. #import <UIKit/UIKit.h>

@interface SettingItem : UIView{

@property (strong, nonatomic) IBOutlet UIImageView *myImage;

@end
 Now i am using storyboard. There is a viewcontroller. I dragged UIView to viewcontroller. I dragged one UIImageView as a subview of above UIView. I set the "SettingItem" class to UIView from storyboard. I connected the outlet to myImage by normal dragging from outlets of SettingItem from utilities window. SettingItem implementation #import "SettingItem.h"

@implementation SettingItem

{
    self = [super initWithFrame:frame];
    if (self) {
        // Initialization code
        [self baseInit];
    }
    return self;
}

-(id) initWithCoder:(NSCoder *)aDecoder{
    self = [super initWithCoder:aDecoder];
    if (self) {
        // Initialization code
        [self baseInit];

 Now my problem is myImage is always nil, above NSLog just print (null) for the outlet. I checked the view in storyboard and checked its outlet reference and its pointing to myImage. I am missing something. I googled for the help but couldn't find any solution. Can you please point out what am i doing wrong ?

@TITLE:Combining c++ standard algorithms by looping only once
@CONTENT:I currently have this code up and running: string word="test,";
string::iterator it=word.begin();
for (; it != word.end(); it++)
{
  if (!isalpha(*it)) { break; } else { *it=toupper(*it); }
}
word.erase(it, word.end());
// word should now be: TEST
 I would like to make it more compact and readable it by: composing existing standard c++ algorithms (*) perform the loop only once (*) I'm assuming that combining existing algorithms makes my code more readable... Thanks in advance, JM An alternative solution In addition to defining a custom transform_until algorithm, as suggested by jrok, it might be possible to define a custom iterator adaptor that would iterate using the underlying iterator but redefine operator*() by modifying the underlying reference before returning it. Something like that: template <typename Iterator, typename UnaryFunction = typename Iterator::value_type (*)(typename Iterator::value_type)>
class sidefx_iterator: public std::iterator<
                         typename std::forward_iterator_tag,
                         typename std::iterator_traits<Iterator>::value_type,
                         typename std::iterator_traits<Iterator>::difference_type,
                         typename std::iterator_traits<Iterator>::pointer,
                         typename std::iterator_traits<Iterator>::reference >
{
  public:
    explicit sidefx_iterator(Iterator x, UnaryFunction fx) : current_(x), fx_(fx) {}

    typename Iterator::reference operator*() const { *current_ = fx_(*current_); return *current_; }
    typename Iterator::pointer operator->() const { return current_.operator->(); }
    Iterator& operator++() { return ++current_; }
    Iterator& operator++(int) { return current_++; }
    bool operator==(const sidefx_iterator<Iterator>& other) const { return current_ == other.current_; }
    bool operator==(const Iterator& other) const { return current_ == other; }
    bool operator!=(const sidefx_iterator<Iterator>& other) const { return current_ != other.current_; }
    bool operator!=(const Iterator& other) const { return current_ != other; }
    operator Iterator() const { return current_; }

  private:
    Iterator current_;
    UnaryFunction fx_;
};
 Of course this is still very raw, but should give the idea. With the above adaptor, I could then write the following: word.erase(std::find_if(it, it_end, std::not1(std::ref(::isalpha))), word.end());
 with the following defined in advance (which could be simplified by some template-magic): using TransformIterator = sidefx_iterator<typename std::string::iterator>;
TransformIterator it(word.begin(), reinterpret_cast<typename std::string::value_type(*)(typename std::string::value_type)>(static_cast<int(*)(int)>(std::toupper))); 
TransformIterator it_end(word.end(), nullptr);
 If the standard would include such an adaptor I would use it, because it would mean that it was flawless, but since this is not the case I'll probably keep my loop as it is. Such an adaptor would allow to reuse existing algorithms and mixing them in different ways not possible today, but it might have downsides as well, which I'm likely overlooking at the moment...

@TITLE:Automating SSH to windows with Ruby
@CONTENT:I have a 13 windows servers running Jenkins Slaves. For some reason (windows updates?), the Jenkins slaves periodically quit working and the Jenkins Slave service needs to be restarted. If I manually SSH to the machines (cygwin ssh server is running) I simply type: net stop "Jenkins Slave"
net start "Jenkins Slave"
 and this (almost) always solves the problem. So I wrote a Ruby script to automate this. Here is is: #!/usr/bin/env ruby
require 'rubygems'
require 'net/ssh'

USER = 'Administrator'
PASS = 'PASSWORD'
hosts = [:breckenridge, :carbondale, :crestone, :denali, :gunnison, :sneffels, "mammoth", "whitney", "snowmass", "firestone",  "avon", :grizzly, :silverton]

hosts.each {|host|
    puts "SSHing #{host} ..." 
    Net::SSH.start( HOST, USER, :password => PASS ) do |ssh|
        puts ssh.exec!('net stop "Jenkins Slave"')
        puts ssh.exec!('net start "Jenkins Slave"')
        puts "Logging out..."
    end
}
 The script executes on all machines, I see output that the service has started. However, this never works. When I ssh back to the machine, the service hasn't started. Sadly, I can't use Linux - I'm not in control of these machines. Any ideas on why a manually executed SSH works, but the script doesn't? Thanks phil

@LINK:/questions/13983753/under-what-conditions-can-a-thread-enter-a-lock-monitor-region-more-than-once
@TITLE:Under what conditions can a thread enter a lock (Monitor) region more than once concurrently?
@CONTENT:(question revised): So far, the answers all include a single thread re-entering the lock region linearly, through things like recursion, where you can trace the steps of a single thread entering the lock twice. But is it possible somehow, for a single thread (perhaps from the ThreadPool, perhaps as a result of timer events or async events or a thread going to sleep and being awaken/reused in some other chunk of code separately) to somehow be spawned in two different places independently of each other, and hence, run into the lock re-entrance problem when the developer didn't expect it by simply reading their own code? In the ThreadPool Class Remarks (click here) the Remarks seem to suggest that sleeping threads should be reused when they're not in use, or otherwise wasted by sleeping. But on the Monitor.Enter reference page (click here) they say "It is legal for the same thread to invoke Enter more than once without it blocking." So I figure there must be something I'm supposed to be careful to avoid. What is it? How is it even possible for a single thread to enter the same lock region twice? Suppose you have some lock region that takes an unfortunately long time. This might be realistic, for example, if you access some memory that has been paged out (or whatever.) The thread in the locked region might go to sleep or something. Does the same thread become eligible to run more code, which might accidentally step into the same lock region? The following does NOT, in my testing, get multiple instances of the same thread to run into the same lock region. So how does one produce the problem? What exactly do you need to be careful to avoid? class myClass
{
    private object myLockObject;
    public myClass()
    {
        this.myLockObject = new object();
        int[] myIntArray = new int[100];               // Just create a bunch of things so I may easily launch a bunch of Parallel things
        Array.Clear(myIntArray, 0, myIntArray.Length); // Just create a bunch of things so I may easily launch a bunch of Parallel things
        Parallel.ForEach<int>(myIntArray, i => MyParallelMethod());

@TITLE:Why does the JVM have both `invokespecial` and `invokestatic` opcodes?
@CONTENT:Both instructions use static rather than dynamic dispatch. It seems like the only substantial difference is that invokespecial will always have, as its first argument, an object that is an instance of the class that the dispatched method belongs to. However, invokespecial does not actually put the object there; the compiler is the one responsible for making that happen by emitting the appropriate sequence of stack operations before emitting invokespecial. So replacing invokespecial with invokestatic should not affect the way the runtime stack / heap gets manipulated -- though I expect that it will cause a VerifyError for violating the spec. I'm curious about the possible reasons behind making two distinct instructions that do essentially the same thing. I took a look at the source of the OpenJDK interpreter, and it seems like invokespecial and invokestatic are handled almost identically. Does having two separate instructions help the JIT compiler better optimize code, or does it help the classfile verifier prove some safety properties more efficiently? Or is this just a quirk in the JVM's design?

This means merging all the styles to inline properties, and changing all links to absolute URLs. I've tried nearly every free conversion website, api, and even libraries on github. None are that impressive. The best python implementation I could find for flattening styles is https://github.com/davecranwell/inline-styler. I adapted that slightly for Flask, but the generated file isn't that great. Here's how it looks: Obviously, it should look better.

@TITLE:Dependency injection for ASP.NET Web API action method parameters
@CONTENT:I am working on an ASP.NET Web API project in C# for a JSON interface to a mobile application. My idea was to create interfaces for all requests and then only use these interfaces in the Web API code. I ended up with something like this: public interface IApiObject {}
public interface IApiResponse<T> : IApiObject where T : IApiObject {}
public interface IApiRegistrationRequest : IApiObject {}
 My controller looks like this: public class MyApiController : ApiController
{

    public IApiResponse<IApiObject> Register(IApiRegistrationRequest request) {
        // do some stuff
    }
}
 My Web API project also contains implementations of these interfaces. I assumed Web API projects use model binding like MVC projects do, so I created an inheritance aware ModelBinderProvider for providing a binder for all IApiObjects and a custom model binder using a Unity container to resolve the interfaces to their implementations. However, after some more investigation, I came across How Web API does parameter binding and found out that Web API uses formatters instead of model binders for complex types. The linked blog post recommends using a ModelBinderAttribute on my action parameters, but that attribute only accepts a type as a parameter. My custom model binder does, however, not contain an empty constructor (it needs a unity container), so I would need to pass an instance of it. The other way I can think of is using dependency injection for the formatters. Unfortunately, I am unfamiliar with them as I have never used them before. Which is the right way to go? And how do I do it?
@CODE:public interface IApiObject {}
public interface IApiResponse<T> : IApiObject where T : IApiObject {}
public interface IApiRegistrationRequest : IApiObject {} public class MyApiController : ApiController
{

    public IApiResponse<IApiObject> Register(IApiRegistrationRequest request) {
        // do some stuff
    }

 When I click the button I only get the dialog cancel and shows the background activity (fragment). There isn't any call to onActivityResult, onResume, ... in the Fragment or the Activity contains the Fragment. Things I tried: To implement onActivityResult in both, Fragment and Activity that contains my Fragment. Things to know: I set the attribute noHistory=true in every Activity I have. If I do finish() in onClick the Activity/Fragment that calls DialogActivity is closed too, and the application return to the before Activity. This may be the problem, I DON'T call finish() ... but if I call finish(), it exits to another Activity, not the Activity that calls startActivityForResult. Links I checked: startActivityForResult() dont call to onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data)? Cannot get to trigger onActivityResult() android? startActivityForResult doesn't seem to call onActivityResult onActivityResult never called Android onActivityResult NEVER called onActivityResult() not called when Activity started from Fragment I hope everything is clearly explained ^^. Thanks in advance.

@TITLE:Setting a jQuery event handler for AJAX-loaded data [duplicate]
@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: Event binding on dynamically created elements? 10 answers Being fairly new to jQuery and the AJAX basics, I've been trying to set up some fairly simple dynamic loading. I include a .js file setting up the click event handler, and it looks like this: var baseurl = document.getElementById("baseurl").getAttribute("href");
var pattern = new RegExp("[^/]+");
var page = "cnt/" + pattern.exec(window.location.href.substr(baseurl.length)) + ".php";

$(document).ready(function(){
    $('a.ajax').bind('click',function(event){
        event.preventDefault();
        $('#content').load("cnt/" + pattern.exec(this.href.substr(baseurl.length)) + ".php")
    })
});
 Note that I do some changes to the file so the relative href "testing/" would turn into an absolute path to the file "cnt/testing.php". My anchor tags look like this: <a href="testing/" class="ajax">Link to testing page</a>
 My problem is, that whenever new content is loaded into div#content the handler in my .js file is not registered for any links that may have appeared using AJAX. In other words the links will simply act as ordinary anchor-tags. I want it to load the next page using AJAX, just like it does with the first page.
@CODE:var baseurl = document.getElementById("baseurl").getAttribute("href");
var pattern = new RegExp("[^/]+");
var page = "cnt/" + pattern.exec(window.location.href.substr(baseurl.length)) + ".php";

$(document).ready(function(){
    $('a.ajax').bind('click',function(event){
        event.preventDefault();

    self.param2 = ko.observable(privateFunction(constructorParam));

    }

    function privateFunction2(param) {
        // do some stuff
    }
};
 I need to access private functions and observable parameters across multiple files. My final model should look like this: // file 1 
// contains constructor and param initialization + many common private helper funcitons
namespace.model = function(constructorParam) {
    var self = this;

    self.param1 = ko.observable(constructorParam.param1);
    self.param2 = ko.observable(privateFunction(constructorParam));

    function privateFunction(param) {

    self.param1

    // call some private funcitons
    privateFunction2(self.param2);

// view model initialization

@TITLE:store TEXT/BLOB in same table or not?
@CONTENT:While searching trough SO, I've found two contradicting answers (and even a comment that stated that) but no definitive answer: The problem is: is there any performance benefit, if you store a TEXT/BLOB field outside of a table? We assume: You SELECT correctly (only selection the TEXT/BLOB if required, no SELECT *) Tables are indexed properly, where it makes sense (so it's not a matter of 'if you index it') The database design doesnt really matter. This is a question to identify the MySQL behaviour in this special case, not to solve certain database design problems. Let's assume this Database has only one table (or two, if the TEXT/BLOB gets separated) used engine: innoDB (others would be interesting too, if they fetch different results) This post states, that putting the TEXT/BLOB into a separate table, only helps if you're already SELECTing in a wrong way (always SELECTing the TEXT/BLOB even when it's not necessary) - basically stating, that TEXT/BLOB in the same table is basically the better solution (less complexity, no performance hit, etc) since the TEXT/BLOB is stored seprately anyway The only time that moving TEXT columns into another table will offer any benefit is if there it a tendency to usually select all columns from tables. This is merely introducing a second bad practice to compensate for the first. It should go without saying the two wrongs is not the same as three lefts. MySQL Table with TEXT column This post however, states that: When a table has TEXT or BLOB columns, the table can't be stored in memory Does that mean that it's already enough to have a TEXT/BLOB inside a table, to have a performance hit? MySQL varchar(2000) vs text? My Question basically is: What's the correct answer? Does it really matter if you store TEXT/BLOB into a separate table, if you SELECT correctly? Or does even having a TEXT/BLOB inside a table, create a potential performance hit?

 Edit (06/01/2013): managed to fix it, if you want to make your contact visible make sure that the account name you give the provider is the name as the account of the contact. now I have a diferent problem, in 4.0 devices the contacts becomes duplicates of each other I tried to do manually aggregation but in some devices it works and in some it doesn't.

@TITLE:JPA Query.getResultList() - use in a generic way
@CONTENT:I'm creating a complex query with multiple tables and need to list the result. Usually, I'm using the EntityManager and map the result to the JPA-Representation: UserEntity user = em.find(UserEntity.class, "5");
 Then I can access all values as the user UserEntity class defines it. But how can I access the field-values returned from a native, multiple-table query? What I get is a List of Objects. That's fine so far, but what "is" that Object? Array? Map? Collection? ... //simpleExample
Query query = em.createNativeQuery("SELECT u.name,s.something FROM user u, someTable s WHERE s.user_id = u.id");
List list = query.getResultList();

//do sth. with the list, for example access "something" for every result row.
 I guess the answer is quite simple, but most examples out there just show the usage when directly casting to a targetClass. PS: In the example I could use the class-mappings of course. But in my case someTable is not managed by JPA, and therefore I don't have the entity nor do I have a class-representation of it, and since I'm joining like 20 tables, I don't want to create all the classes just to access the values.
@CODE:UserEntity user = em.find(UserEntity.class, "5"); UserEntity //simpleExample
Query query = em.createNativeQuery("SELECT u.name,s.something FROM user u, someTable s WHERE s.user_id = u.id");

Each histogram should have 3 peaks, one of them (the first one) probably much higher than the others. I want to do several things: Find the first "valley" following the first peak (in order to get rid of the first peak altogether in the picture) Find the optimum "valley" value in between the remaining two peaks to separate the picture I already know how to do step 2 by implementing a variant of Otsu. But I'm struggling with step 1 In case the valley in between the two remaining peaks is not low enough, I'd like to give a warning. Also, the image is quite clean with little noise to account for What would be the brute-force algorithms to do steps 1 and 3? I could find a way to implement Otsu, but the brute-force is escaping me, math-wise. As it turns out, there is more documentation on doing methods like otsu, and less on simply finding peaks and valleys. I am not looking for anything more than whatever gets the job done (i.e. it's a temporary solution, just has to be implementable in a reasonable timeframe, until I can spend more time on it) I am doing all this in c# Any help on which steps to take would be appreciated! Thank you so much! EDIT: some more data: most histogram are likely to be like the first one, with the first peak representing background.

@TITLE:How does the EJB client locate the EJB server without url?
@CONTENT:I am new to Java EE. At present I am going through The Java EE 6 Tutorial, Volume 1 (Basic Concepts Beta) by Sun Microsystems. To escape from monotonous reading time to time I play with few Java EE projects/codes written by others. I came from SE. My head is still filled with SE. In SE (two tier application) I use DATABASE_URL = "jdbc:mysql://something.db_server.com/db_name" This is how my client knows where the database server is. In one Java EE example I saw // Access JNDI Initial Context.

Properties p = new Properties();

p.put("java.naming.factory.initial","org.jnp.interfaces.NamingContextFactory");
p.put("java.naming.provider.url","jnp://localhost:1099");
p.put("java.naming.factory.url.pkgs","org.jboss.naming:org.jnp.interfaces");

InitialContext ctx = new InitialContext(p);

// Change jndi name according to your server and ejb

HelloRemote remote = (HelloRemote) ctx.lookup("HelloBean/remote");

msg = "Message From EJB --> " + remote.sayHello();
 This I understand. The code has url and port number. There is this line p.put("java.naming.provider.url","jnp://localhost:1099");
 Client side knows where is the server by the url and which port to knock. I think the code was written at the time of Java EE 5. Today I have found another example where Netbeans 7, Java EE 6, and GlassFish 3 are used. The client side code @EJB
private static MySessionRemote mySession;

/**
 * @param args the command line arguments
 */

public static void main(String[] args) {
    JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, 
            "result = " + mySession.getResult());
}
 Here is the link http://netbeans.org/kb/docs/javaee/entappclient.html No url and port number are given. Java EE 6 Development with Netbeans 7 by David R. Heffelfinger has a similar example in chapter 7. The author did not explain how it is done in the book. I think he has done it but I probably missed itK My question is how the client side locate the server without url? Is it stated in one of those xml files? Client can be in California and the GlassFish Server can be in New York. Can anyone explain it to me or point to any tutorial/blog/article where I can find the answer? Thank you.

@TITLE:Is there an img (javascript) equivalent to background-size:cover?
@CONTENT:I'm working on a responsive design that showcases photos in a grid. The photos themselves can be in all aspect ratios and sizes. Furthermore, the grid cells in which they are placed are also not of a fixed width, they scale as you resize the browser. Further, each grid cell, although dynamic in width and height, is of the same size, regardless of the image inside it. To properly show photos in this highly dynamic situation, I have found a working recipe: each photo is basically a div with the image set as the background image. To properly scale the unknown width/height of the image inside a dynamically sized grid, I'm making use of CSS3's background-size:cover feature. The end result is fabulous, it does exactly what I want in terms of UI and display. Still, I'm not pleased with the reduced accessibility of this solution: it's not SEO friendly and not plugin friendly (think of social plugins). Therefore, I'm trying to reproduce the working situation I have but this time using good old img tags instead of CSS backgrounds. I know there are IE8 and below polyfills for background-size:cover, but I'm not looking for that, I'm looking for a solution based on img tags. I also found articles using absolute positioning techniques as well as CSS's clip property, but keep in mind nothing about my design is absolute in size. I guess what I'm looking for is a javascript routine that has the logic of background-size:cover for dynamic sizing, in a situation where both the source (image dimensions) and target (display box) are dynamic in size. Is there such a javascript equivalent to background-size:cover that works on img tags?

@TITLE:Properly format multipart/form-data body
@CONTENT:Introduction Background I'm writing a script to upload stuff including files using the multipart/form-data content type defined in RFC 2388. In the long run, I'm trying to provide a simple Python script to do uploads of binary packages for github, which involves sending form-like data to Amazon S3. Related This question has already asked about how to do this, but it is without an accepted answer so far, and the more useful of the two answers it currently has points to these recipes which in turn build the whole message manually. I am somewhat concerned about this approach, particularly with regard to charsets and binary content. There is also this question, with its currently highest-scoring answer suggesting the MultipartPostHandler module. But that is not much different from the recipes I mentioned, and therefore my concerns apply tho that as well. Concerns Binary content RFC 2388 Section 4.3 explicitely states that content is expected to be 7 bit unless declared otherwise, and therefore a Content-Transfer-Encoding header might be required. Does that mean I'd have to Base64-encode binary file content? Or would Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit be sufficient for arbitrary files? Or should that read Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary? Charset for header fields Header fields in general, and the filename header field in particular, are ASCII only by default. I'd like my method to be able to pass non-ASCII file names as well. I know that for my current application of uploading stuff for github, I probably won't need that as the file name is given in a separate field. But I'd like my code to be reusable, so I'd rather encode the file name parameter in a conforming way. RFC 2388 Section 4.4 advises the format introduced in RFC 2231, e.g. filename*=utf-8''t%C3%A4st.txt. My approach Using python libraries As multipart/form-data is essentially a MIME type, I thought that it should be possible to use the email package from the standard python libraries to compose my post. The rather complicated handling of non-ASCII header fields in particular is something I'd like to delegate. Work so far So I wrote the following code: #!/usr/bin/python3.2

import email.charset
import email.generator
import email.header
import email.mime.application
import email.mime.multipart
import email.mime.text
import io
import sys

class FormData(email.mime.multipart.MIMEMultipart):

    def __init__(self):
        email.mime.multipart.MIMEMultipart.__init__(self, 'form-data')

    def setText(self, name, value):
        part = email.mime.text.MIMEText(value, _charset='utf-8')
        part.add_header('Content-Disposition', 'form-data', name=name)
        self.attach(part)
        return part

    def setFile(self, name, value, filename, mimetype=None):
        part = email.mime.application.MIMEApplication(value)
        part.add_header('Content-Disposition', 'form-data',
                        name=name, filename=filename)
        if mimetype is not None:
            part.set_type(mimetype)
        self.attach(part)
        return part

    def http_body(self):
        b = io.BytesIO()
        gen = email.generator.BytesGenerator(b, False, 0)
        gen.flatten(self, False, '\r\n')
        b.write(b'\r\n')
        b = b.getvalue()
        pos = b.find(b'\r\n\r\n')
        assert pos >= 0
        return b[pos + 4:]

fd = FormData()
fd.setText('foo', 'bar')
fd.setText('t?st', 'T?st')
fd.setFile('file', b'abcdef'*50, 'T?st.txt')
sys.stdout.buffer.write(fd.http_body())
 The result looks like this: --===============6469538197104697019==

 It does seem to handle headers reasonably well. Binary file content will get base64-encoded, which might be avoidable but which should work well enough. What worries me are the text fields in between. They are base64-encoded as well. I think that according to the standard, this should work well enough, but I'd rather have plain text in there, just in case some dumb framework has to deal with the data at an intermediate level and does not know about Base64 encoded data. Questions Can I use 8 bit data for my text fields and still conform to the specification? Can I get the email package to serialize my text fields as 8 bit data without extra encoding? If I have to stick to some 7 bit encoding, can I get the implementation to use quoted printable for those text parts where that encoding is shorter than base64? Can I avoid base64 encoding for binary file content as well? If I can avoid it, should I write the Content-Transfer-Encoding as 8bit or as binary? If I had to serialize the body myself, how could I use the email.header package on its own to just format header values? (email.utils.encode_rfc2231 does this.) Is there some implementation that already did all I'm trying to do? These questions are very closely related, and could be summarized as how would you implement this. In many cases, answering one question either answers or obsoletes another one. So I hope you agree that a single post for all of them is appropriate.

@TITLE:How do I calculate the Minkowski Difference between two AABBs (with no vector math)?
@CONTENT:I'm implementing the second version of my collision detection library. This particular library should deal with axis-aligned boxes (AABBs). I'd like to start tracking fast-moving boxes on this version. I think calculating the Minkowski Difference between the two would be a good starting point for that. When I say Minkowsky Difference I mean the geometric operation described in Collision detection for Dummies. The catch is: The process and algorithm described there is very generic. It uses fairly advanced vector math to calculate the MD of any two polygons. In my case I have AABBs. Given their numerical simplicity, the library so far has not needed a Vector concept - for example, I have not needed to compute a single dot product. I'd like it to stay that way if at all possible. So my question is: Given two AABBs by their top,left,width and height ({t1,l1,w1,h1} and {t2,l2,w2,h2}), how do I calculate their MD, (without getting vector math if possible)? Just by playing with the widget on Collision detection for Dummies, I'm almost certain that the MD width will be a box of width w1+w2 and height h1+h2. But I have no idea about how to calculate its top or left corner.

Ideally TypeScript intellisense and the like should work in the inline <script> block, which makes me think that this should be a VS2012 extension. Is there any way to do this?

@CONTENT:I'm using the most recent versions of all software (Django, Python, virtualenv, MySQLdb) and I can't get this to work. When I run "import MySQLdb" in the python prompt from outside of the virtualenv, it works, inside it says "ImportError: No module named MySQLdb". I'm trying to learn Python and Linux web development. I know that it's easiest to use SQLLite, but I want to learn how to develop larger-scale applications comparable to what I can do in .NET. I've read every blog post on Google and every post here on StackOverflow and they all suggest that I run "sudo pip install mysql-python" but it just says "Requirement already satisfied: mysql-python in /usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7" Any help would be appreciated! I'm stuck over here and don't want to throw in the towel and just go back to doing this on Microsoft technologies because I can't even get a basic dev environment up and running.

@TITLE:NuGet Package Restore is not restoring packages on build
@CONTENT:I am moving our source code from Vault to TFS, not bothering with the migration or anything, just pulling a get latest in vault and adding it to TFS. The solution has got several projects, and each one has at least one NuGet package. I am trying to get Package Restore working again. It worked in Vault (but not the way it was supposed to). I was under a bit of a deadline, and it did not work at first, so I added a Pre-Build event to run nuget.exe against the packages.config for each project. TFS build service complains about that, so I am trying to get it working "right". I have set the option in Visual Studio Tools menu. I have installed NuGetEnablePackageRestore and run the fix. I have verified that the packages directory is is source control, but is empty. I have verified that the project files each include the following: <RestorePackages>true</RestorePackages>
<Import Project="$(SolutionDir)\.nuget\nuget.targets" />
 Building with Diagnostic level verbosity reveals that each project evaluates those properties, but the RestoreCommand in nuget.targets is never executed. Any thoughts? I have attempted to implement the solutions from these links: nuget - package restore not working NuGet Package Restore Not Working - I did post a question/comment on there asking for clarification... http://nuget.codeplex.com/workitem/1879 Edit Additionally, I have found that the RestoreCommand property is being evaluated during build.

For some of my subjects this results in a code with a leading zero (e.g. "010816"). When I import into Pandas, the leading zero is stripped of and the column is formatted as int64.

@TITLE:boost:asio thread pool implementation for occasionally synchronized tasks
@CONTENT:I have a "main" function that performs many small, independent tasks each once per time step. However, after each time step, I must wait for all of the tasks to complete before stepping forward. I want to make the program multithreaded. I have tried implementations with the boost-offshoot threadpool, and I've tried using a vector of (shared pointers to) threads, and I've tried the asio threadpool ideas (using an io_service, establishing some work, then distributing run to the threads and posting handlers to the io_service). All of these seem to have a lot of overhead creating and destroying threads for my "many small tasks," and I want a way, preferably using the asio tools, to instantiate one io_service, one thread_group, posting handlers to the io_service, and waiting for a single time step's work to be finished before posting more tasks. Is there a good way to do this? Here's (stripped down) code for what I have working now: boost::asio::io_service io_service;
for(int theTime = 0; theTime != totalTime; ++theTime)
{
    io_service.reset();
    boost::thread_group threads;
    // scoping to destroy the work object after work is finished being assigned
    {
        boost::asio::io_service::work work(io_service);
        for (int i = 0; i < maxNumThreads; ++i)
        {
            threads.create_thread(boost::bind(&boost::asio::io_service::run,
                &io_service));
        }

        for(int i = 0; i < numSmallTasks; ++i)
        {
            io_service.post(boost::bind(&process_data, i, theTime));
        }
    }
    threads.join_all(); 
}

@CONTENT:My target is simple. I want to add a "Red Rectangle" as a headerview to a ListView. so I create a simple activity public class MainActivity extends Activity {
    private String[] adapterData = new String[] { "Afghanistan", "Albania", "Algeria", 
            "American Samoa", "Andorra", "Angola"}; 

    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        ListView lv;
        lv = (ListView)findViewById(R.id.list);

        LayoutInflater lf;
        View headerView;
        lf = this.getLayoutInflater();
        headerView = (View)lf.inflate(R.layout.header, null, false);

        lv.addHeaderView(headerView, null, false);

        lv.setAdapter(new ArrayAdapter<String>(this, R.layout.list_item, adapterData));

@LINK:/questions/12981168/need-fool-proof-synchronization-of-arraylist-in-a-multi-threaded-environment
@TITLE:Need Fool Proof Synchronization of ArrayList in A Multi-threaded Environment
@CONTENT:I've been at this for a week now doing my research on how to properly synchronize an ArrayList. My main issue in a nutshell is I have a "master" ArrayList of objects. Different threads may come in and add/set/remove from this list. I need to be sure that when one thread is iterating through the ArrayList, another is not changing it. Now I've read many articles on the "best" way of handling this: use collections.synchronizedlist use CopyOnWriteArrayList use synchronized() blocks in conjunction with collections.synchronizedlist use Vector (many people are against this) Using synchronized blocks around every iteration, add/set/remove block seems to be kind of what I want, but people have said there is a lot of overhead. So then I started playing with CopyOnWriteArrayList (I do way more reads than writes for my master ArrayList). This is fine for reading, but what a lot of forum threads neglect to mention is that elements cannote be added, set, or removed from the iterator itself. For example (a basic version, but imagine it in a multi-threaded environment): public static void main(String[] args) {

    class TestObject{
        private String s = "";
        public TestObject(String s){
            this.s = s;
        }

        public void setTheString(String s){
            this.s = s;
        }

        public String getTheString(){
            return s;
        }
    }

    CopyOnWriteArrayList<TestObject> list = new CopyOnWriteArrayList<TestObject>();
    list.add(new TestObject("A"));
    list.add(new TestObject("B"));
    list.add(new TestObject("C"));
    list.add(new TestObject("D"));
    list.add(new TestObject("E"));

    ListIterator<TestObject> litr = list.listIterator();

    while(litr.hasNext()){
      TestObject test = litr.next();
      if(test.getTheString().equals("B")){
         litr.set(new TestObject("TEST"));
      }
    }
}
 the line "litr.set(new TestObject("TEST"));" would throw a java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException
 And looking at the Java Documentation there is a specific line describing this behavior: "Element-changing operations on iterators themselves (remove, set, and add) are not supported. These methods throw UnsupportedOperationException." So then you are forced to modify that list by using list.set(litr.previousIndex(), new TestObject("TEST"));
 Now technically shouldn't this present a synchronization issue? If another thread were to come in at the same time, and say, remove all elements from "list" the iterator would not see that, it would go to set the "list" at a given index and would throw an exception because the element at that point no longer exists. I just don't understand the point of CopyOnWriteArrayList if you cant add an element through the iterator itself. Am I missing the point with using CopyOnWriteArrayList? Do I wrap every iterator that ends up having to add/set/remove an element in a synchronized block? This HAS to be a common issue with multi-threading. I would have thought someone would have made a class that could handle all this without worry... Thanks in advance for having a look at this!
@CODE:public static void main(String[] args) {

    class TestObject{
        private String s = "";
        public TestObject(String s){
            this.s = s;
        }

        public void setTheString(String s){
            this.s = s;
        }

        public String getTheString(){
            return s;
        }
    }

    CopyOnWriteArrayList<TestObject> list = new CopyOnWriteArrayList<TestObject>();
    list.add(new TestObject("A"));
    list.add(new TestObject("B"));
    list.add(new TestObject("C"));
    list.add(new TestObject("D"));
    list.add(new TestObject("E"));

    ListIterator<TestObject> litr = list.listIterator();

    while(litr.hasNext()){
      TestObject test = litr.next();
      if(test.getTheString().equals("B")){
         litr.set(new TestObject("TEST"));

@CONTENT:I wouldn't normally ask this kind of question on here, but unfortunately whilst AutoMapper seems to be a good mapping library, its documentation is woefully bad - there is no XML documentation for the library's methods, and the most official online documentation I could find was this, which is very brisk. If anyone has any better documentation, please let me know. That said, here's the question: why use Mapper.Initialize? It doesn't seem to be required as you can just use Mapper.CreateMap immediately, and as there is no documentation I have no clue what Initialize is meant to do.

As I understand it sort of corresponds to object in OOP. But of course there's nothing like instantiating different instances of a package so that each instance would have different property values and behave differently. Then what is the advantage of using packages when I can just create a standalone procedure and call it independently?

}
 So, when I used a GridView, there were no problems, but when I use a ListView the image is changed only in the first item ! Example: I want to display product images for "car", "house" and "apple" items. The code will launch the thread and all images (car then house and finally apple) will be displayed in the first item (the car item)... And the house and the apple while not have images !! Do you know what I should do ? Thanks

@TITLE:Loopj Android Async Http - onFailure not fired
@CONTENT:I am using the great async http library from loopj, but I have run into a small snag. If the user has no internet connection or loses their connection, the app just won't return anything. This part is expected, but it also doesn't fire the onFailure method. Also, the code I have used when there is an internet connection does work so there is no problem on the server end. Here is some code that is stripped down to the minimum. It also doesn't work (I have tested this too) String url = getString(R.string.baseurl) + "/appconnect.php";
client.getHttpClient().getParams().setParameter(ClientPNames.ALLOW_CIRCULAR_REDIRECTS, true);
client.get(url, null, new JsonHttpResponseHandler()
{
    @Override
    public void onSuccess(JSONArray response)
    {
        Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(), "Success", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
    }

    @Override
    public void onFailure(Throwable e, JSONArray errorResponse)
    {
        Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(), "Failure", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();

@TITLE:Rollback to Previous Commit - Github for MAC (a revert is already in progress)
@CONTENT:I think I've messed up here. I made a few changes to my code from a last commit adding new functionalities and realized that some other piece of code was now acting strangely. I decided to Roll back to an old commit (pushed to remote as well) in order to test if that functionality was working by then. Before I pressed Rollback, I committed my currently made changes because I did not want to lose them. After committing (not pushing to remote), I did the rollback to that old commit. (note that there were quite a few commits inbetween the commit i roll backed to and the one i committed just now). All worked fine and my code reverted to that commit. The functionality was misbehaving there in that commit as well so I decided to come back to my most recent commit. However, I knew not how to do that except Rolling Back to the latest commit. But it gave me an error. error: a cherry-pick or revert is already in progress
hint: try "git cherry-pick (--continue | --quit | --abort)"
fatal: revert failed
(32768)
 Now, it seems like most of things are back but the current version of code isn't the same as my last commit. It is somewhere in between. =( What did I do wrong? [I'm not asking out of innocence, I know I did it wrong ;)] What was the right way of doing it? [I think I should have branched first]

@TITLE:How does phoneGap (Cordova) work internally, iOS specific
@CONTENT:I have started developing html applications for mutliple platforms. I recently heard about Cordova 2.0(PhoneGap) and ever since I have been curious to know how the bridge works. After lot of code walking, i saw that the Exec.js is the code where call from JS -> Native happens execXhr = execXhr || new XMLHttpRequest();
        // Changeing this to a GET will make the XHR reach the URIProtocol on 4.2.
        // For some reason it still doesn't work though...
        execXhr.open('HEAD', "file:///!gap_exec", true);
        execXhr.setRequestHeader('vc', cordova.iOSVCAddr);
        if (shouldBundleCommandJson()) {
            execXhr.setRequestHeader('cmds', nativecomm());
        }
        execXhr.send(null);
    } else {
        execIframe = execIframe || createExecIframe();
        execIframe.src = "gap://ready";
 But want to understand how that works, what is the concept here, what does file:///!gap_exec or gap://ready do? and how does the call propgate to the lower layers (native code layers) thanks a bunch in advance.

Also, it does not have to be rigorously random. The point is, what's an interesting, or concise, or fast (that is, with vim native functions), or short way to get a sequence of reasonably good random numbers in Vim?

@LINK:/questions/12733084/cuda-why-is-warp-based-parallel-reduction-slower
@TITLE:CUDA - why is warp based parallel reduction slower?
@CONTENT:I had the idea about a warp based parallel reduction since all threads of a warp are in sync by definition. So the idea was that the input data can be reduced by factor 64 (each thread reduces two elements) without any synchronization need. Same as the original implementation by Mark Harris the reduction is applied on block-level and data is on shared memory. http://gpgpu.org/static/sc2007/SC07_CUDA_5_Optimization_Harris.pdf I created a kernel to test his version and my warp based version. The kernel itself is completely identically storing BLOCK_SIZE elements in shared memory and outputting its result at its unique block index in an output array. The algorithm itself works fine. Tested with full array of one's to test the "counting". Function body of the implementations: /**
 * Performs a parallel reduction with operator add 
 * on the given array and writes the result with the thread 0
 * to the given target value
 *
 * @param inValues T* Input float array, length must be a multiple of 2 and equal to blockDim.x

And running kernel with 256 threads per block (100 % occupancy). The warp based version is ~ 1.28 milliseconds slower. If future card's allow larger block sizes the warp based approach would still need no further sync statement since the max is 4096 which get reduced to 64 which get reduced by final warp to 1 Why is it not faster?, or where is the flaw in the idea, kernel? From ressources usage the warp approach should be ahead? Edit1: Corrected the kernel that only half the threads are active not resulting in out of bound reads, added new performance data

@TITLE:SDK 3.1: How to tell whether SDK is using iOS6 accounts or not?
@CONTENT:If I have a Facebook account set up in iOS6 but the user has switched it off, the SDK just gives me a FBSessionStateClosedLoginFailed status. From that, I can't tell if the user has switched us off in iOS (case 1) or doesn't have an account set up in iOS and declined permission from the FB app or web app (case 2). The error messages I need to present are quite different in the two cases. In the first case, we need to tell the user how to switch us back on, but those instructions would be confusing for someone in case 2. I tried using the iOS Accounts framework, but if I'm switched off, I'm told there ARE no Facebook accounts even if there are. I also tried writing down the account identifier if I ever successfully authenticate, but accountWithIdentifier fails similarly if we are switched off. Anybody know of a way to find out if our rejection is coming from iOS or FB itself?

           break;
       default:
           return null;       
    }    
  }
}
 The implementations that are returned have additional dependencies which will need to be injected via the container, so a hand-rolled factory won't work. Is this possible, and if so what would the registration look like?

     private int mData;

     public int describeContents() {
         return 0;
     }

     public void writeToParcel(Parcel out, int flags) {

         }
     };

     private MyParcelable(Parcel in) {
         mData = in.readInt();
     }

 We are required to implement the 2 functions describeContents() and writeToParcel. (problem) Besides them, we are also required to implement the Parcelable.Creator<T> interface as a static field called CREATOR. Everything is actually straight forward. Now I want to create a Generic Class that has a Parcelable Class Type: public class ShushContainer<T extends Parcelable> implements Parcelable
 I am able to implement Parcelable. I can call the T's writeToParcel function. However, I am unable to access the static CREATOR field. public class ShushContainer<T extends Parcelable> implements Parcelable {
    Vector<T> items;
    String someField;

    @Override
    public int describeContents() {
        return 0;
    }

    @Override
    public void writeToParcel(Parcel dest, int flags) {
        dest.writeString(someField);
        dest.writeInt(items.size());
        for(int i=0;i<items.size();i++)

@TITLE:Setting up jenkins on centos: problems with ssh keys and git
@CONTENT:Went through a lot of questions, but nothing seems to be solving my issue. Or to be more precise I am not sure if I am doing the whole thing correctly. So here it is: Have installed centos 6.3 OS. Then I followed the following guide to install jenkins: https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Installing+Jenkins+on+RedHat+distributions Jenkins works fine. Now I am trying to set up a simple build job, which requires to clone a git repository. (I've installed git plugin) In repository URL i type the following: git@gitserver:myrepo.git Of course I get an error: stderr: Host key verification failed. ok, I need to generate ssh keys and all will be good. So I do the following: su - jenkins
 but unfortunately it doesn't switch to jenkins user. cat /etc/passwd shows the following: jenkins:x:496:492:Jenkins Continuous Build Server:/var/lib/jenkins:/bin/false
 so seems that it doesn't have a usual home directory. The question is how do I generate keys for jenkins or if the above steps where not the right way to do it, how do I fix it? Thanks a lot! Update: I generated keys (as a root user) and placed them in jenkins home and did exactly and copied public key to git server. Still didn't help. When I look at the log of the build it says: Started by user anonymous
Building in workspace /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/myrepo/workspace
 this user anonymous is this another user created by jenkins, or is it still jenkins that runs the commands?

@LINK:/questions/12586051/initializing-instance-variables-in-mixins
@TITLE:Initializing instance variables in Mixins
@CONTENT:Is there any clean way to initialize instance variables in a Module intended to be used as Mixin? For example, I have the following: module Example

  def on(...)   
    @handlers ||= {} 
    # do something with @handlers
  end

  def all(...)
    @all_handlers ||= []
    # do something with @all_handlers
  end

  def unhandled(...)
    @unhandled ||= []
    # do something with unhandled
  end

  def do_something(..)
    @handlers     ||= {}
    @unhandled    ||= []
    @all_handlers ||= []

    # potentially do something with any of the 3 above
  end

end
 Notice that I have to check again and again if each @member has been properly initialized in each function -- this is mildly irritating. I would much rather write: module Example

  def initialize
    @handlers     = {}
    @unhandled    = []
    @all_handlers = []
  end

  # or
  @handlers  = {}
  @unhandled = []
  # ...
end
 And not have to repeatedly make sure things are initialized correctly. However, from what I can tell this is not possible. Is there any way around this, besides adding a initialize_me method to Example and calling initialize_me from the extended Class? I did see this example, but there's no way I'm monkey-patching things into Class just to accomplish this.
@CODE:module Example

  def on(...)   
    @handlers ||= {} 
    # do something with @handlers
  end

  def all(...)
    @all_handlers ||= []
    # do something with @all_handlers
  end

  def unhandled(...)
    @unhandled ||= []
    # do something with unhandled
  end

  def do_something(..)
    @handlers     ||= {}
    @unhandled    ||= []
    @all_handlers ||= []

    # potentially do something with any of the 3 above
  end

end @member module Example

  def initialize
    @handlers     = {}
    @unhandled    = []
    @all_handlers = []
  end

  # or
  @handlers  = {}
  @unhandled = []

@TITLE:How to tell Maven to include the jar dependency, not the subproject source directory in Eclipse?
@CONTENT:I use Apache Maven to manage my Java libs (jar) and some of projects that use the libs. For convinience, I use mvn eclipse:eclipse to generate Eclipse project files which can be imported into Eclipse workspace for editing. Problems arise when I edit the main project and Java lib projects in the same Eclipse workspace. That is, mvn eclipse:eclipse includes src path dependency in .classpath file, not the jar dependency as expected. Say I have a Jave lib project named mylib. The corresponding jar file mylib.jar has been deployed to a private Maven repo maintained by me. In order to use mylib.jar in the main project, the following dependency is included in pom.xml. <!-- pom.xml for the main project -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>namespace.my</groupId>
  <artifactId>mylib</artifactId>
  <version>[1.0, )</version>
</dependency>
 mvn compile and mvn test work perfect, in which mylib.jar is automatically downloaded from my repo. However, when trying mvn eclipse:eclipse, I find the generated .classpath file doesn't include mylib.jar dependency as expected. Instead, it includes source file directory for mylib as follows. <!-- .classpath file generated by mvn eclipse:eclipse -->
<classpathentry kind="src" path="/mylib"/>
 It seems that Maven reads Eclipse's metadata and finds mylib and the main project coexits in the same workspace. Therefore maven includes the source for my good. Damn. How can I tell maven to ignore the local project source and just include the jar file?
@CODE:mvn eclipse:eclipse mvn eclipse:eclipse .classpath jar mylib mylib.jar pom.xml <!-- pom.xml for the main project -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>namespace.my</groupId>
  <artifactId>mylib</artifactId>
  <version>[1.0, )</version>
</dependency> mvn compile mvn test mylib.jar mvn eclipse:eclipse .classpath mylib.jar <!-- .classpath file generated by mvn eclipse:eclipse -->

 It changes the position of each element by changing its status from postion:absolute, top:0 to position:absolute, bottom:0; whilst also changing the containing <ul> from position:relative to position:static SAMPLE: http://jsfiddle.net/dMJqj/80/ Is there anything that can be done to smoothen it up a bit. It looks a bit jerky on Chrome and Firefox and sometimes it can take a fraction of a second to trigger which is noticeable because the sticky header appears to flash.

Total assets and liabilities increased by ?2.9 billion to ?131.2 billion representing a 2.3% increase over the quarter though this was 5.7% lower than the level a year ago.  The higher figures reflected the effects both of volume and exchange rate factors.

The net asset value of total funds under management and administration has increased over the quarter ended 30 June 2012 by ?711 million (0.3%) to reach ?270.8 billion.For the year since 30 June 2011, total net asset values decreased by ?3.6 billion (1.3%).

@TITLE:Generating JUnit reports from the command line
@CONTENT:I have a test setup for a cloud system that uses a mixture of python for process level control and junit for internal state inspection. Essentially, I bring up several VMs to server as the cloud and then a junit VM which is a member of the cloud but drives tests and checks internal state. Our existing cloud management stuff is driven by python and I would like to maintain this. I have a working setup that will run the JUnit command line via java -ea -cp <classpath> org.junit.runner.JUnitCore <tests>
 but this does not produce an report file. I know that ant is capable of producing an xml report, but I do not want to involve ant in this process (I have enough moving parts already). Is there a way to launch junit from the command line such that it produces a report? Ideally, I would have the junit tests produce xml reports, the python tests produce xml reports, and then merge them together for consumption by our CI system. Update: The command line execution must support Windows, Linux, and Mac. We are not allowed to ship an external ant, although packaging an internal ant might be an option.

@TITLE:How to run custom rule in Android.mk before compilation?
@CONTENT:In Android NDK, I build JNI files generated automatically by SWIG. callmanager_wrap.cpp is part of a shared library: LOCAL_SRC_FILES += callmanager_wrap.cpp
include $(BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARY)
 But I would like to append/edit callmanager_wrap.cpp before compiling. To be more explicit: cat jnistuff.txt >> callmanager_wrap.cpp
 Content I need to add is known in advance but callmanager_wrap.cpp is not. It is generated by SWIG. Ultimately, my custom rule will have to run following command to generate callmanager_wrap.cpp: swig -c++ -java -package com.package.my -o callmanager_wrap.cpp callmanager.i
 According to this post, it is not possible to add custom rules to Android.mk. But in Android sources, I believe there are some Android.mk handling steps after BUILT or INSTALLED. I tried the following: MY_JNI_WRAP=callmanager_wrap.cpp

include $(CLEAR_VARS)

LOCAL_SRC_FILES += callmanager_wrap.cpp

LOCAL_INTERMEDIATE_TARGETS += myjni
myjni:
    echo "in myjni target"
    swig -c++ -java -package com.package.my -o $(MY_JNI_WRAP) callmanager.i
    cat jnistuff.txt >> $(MY_JNI_WRAP)

include $(BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARY)
 But myjni target is never called. What is LOCAL_INTERMEDIATE_TARGETS used for? Can I possibly achieve what I want to do here without writing an external script or makefile?
@CODE:LOCAL_SRC_FILES += callmanager_wrap.cpp

@TITLE:Is it possible to create a cross-platform shared library with MonoDroid and MonoTouch that can be used by non-Mono developers?
@CONTENT:We have a proprietary piece of hardware which we are looking to release as a phone peripheral. We have started writing a cross-platform mobile app that interfaces with the hardware using the MonoCross framework (i.e. MonoTouch abstraction layer for iOS and MonoDroid abstraction for Android). We would like to offer the bulk of this application as a code library that can be reused by other app developers who wish to write apps that interface to our hardware. I am concerned that by using Mono we are forcing these developers to do the same. Is that the case? Android Library Can we produce an Android Library (not a Library Project which I understand to mean delivering the full-source) as output from MonoDroid that other developers, developing with the ADT and Java (i.e. they are not using Mono Droid) are able to use in their apps? iOS Library Can we produce a library from MonoTouch that Objective C developers (i.e. they are not using Mono Touch) are able to use in their apps?

@CONTENT:I'm having a lot of trouble to set up a configuration of Spring + Spring Data JPA + QueryDSL + JPA 2.0 + Hibernate in Maven.

I'm getting the following exception: Bean 'dataSource' of type [class org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.DriverManagerDataSource] is not eligible for getting processed by all BeanPostProcessors (for example: not eligible for auto-proxying)
 I took a look in Google and most of times this problem is caused by the absence of the annotation "@Transactional". I tried to annotate my methods, but it didn't solve anything.

I have taken a look at the startapp sdk but i have not managed to find the part where they change the homepage. I have also taken a look at the BrowserSettings in com.android.browser.BrowserSettings In BrowserSettings, there is a interface called setHomepage(Context, String). public void setHomePage(Context context, String url) {

    ed.putString(PREF_HOMEPAGE, url);
    ed.commit();
    homeUrl = url;
}
 I dont know a lot java/android, so correct me if i am wrong: The setHomepage() is not declared static so it can not be called from other activities. So i can not use this. I cant see any Mode applied to the Shared Preferences so it means that it will by default take Private as is Mode and i cant edit the Shared Preferences or ? Some people have said that it may would be possible to do with contentProvider/Resolver. Link for BrowserSettings.java Any help or thoughts would be appreciated:)

So I used JAXB to generate classes from the XSD and then I used jackson JSON processor to generate JSON from my instances. The problem is, that JAXB (xjc) generates classes with JAXB annotations and Android can't handle those. I tried to add the jaxb-api.jar to my android project but the Dalvik won't use core classes. For my first implementation I manually removed the annotations. But now the XSD was updated and I don't want to do this every time this happens. Do you have any idea how to handle this problem in a better way? Is there a possibility to use jaxb/xjc without annotations or is there another code generater that could do this? Do you know an easy way to remove annotations from java classes (even if they are printed in multiple lines)? Is there a project setting for Android Eclipse projects, that makes the dalvik to allow core libs? thx, cathixx

@TITLE:Why does Sitecore publish draft items from the C# API, and how do I stop it doing so?
@CONTENT:I'm running a scheduled publish of my Sitecore master DB using the Sitecore publishing API. I call a web service at scheduled intervals during the day which runs the following code (slightly condensed for readability): // grab the root content node from sitecore
Item contentNode = dbSource.Items[ID.Parse("{0DE95AE4-41AB-4D01-9EB0-67441B7C2450}")];

PublishOptions options = new PublishOptions(sourceDatabase, targetDatabase, PublishMode.Smart, lang, DateTime.Now);

options.RootItem = contentNode;

options.Deep = true;

Publisher p = new Publisher(options);

p.PublishAsync();
 When we run the above code it publishes everything in the content node, including all descendants, regardless of workflow state. It's like it is ignoring the workflow completely. This is not what we are after, and is causing lots of problems on our live website. If we run the same action from within Sitecore Desktop it publishes everything in the content node, including all descendants, that are publishable (I.e. in the final workflow stage). It does not publish any items in the tree that are still in draft mode. This is the required bahaviour. I have tried implementing the code as a non-admin user by surrounding the above code with the following using statement: string userName = @"sitecore\******";

Sitecore.Security.Accounts.User user = Sitecore.Security.Accounts.User.FromName(userName, true);

user.RuntimeSettings.IsAdministrator = false;

using (new Sitecore.Security.Accounts.UserSwitcher(user))
{
    ...
}
 Unfortunately this has had no effect. Is there something obvious I've missed, or am I doing it right and Sitecore is doing it wrong? Can anyone help please? The strange thing I noticed, also, is that the draft items that were published, when viewed on the live database, were showing absolutely nothing in the Sitecore Desktop in terms of fields or meta data. They were also showing a warning that "The current item does not have a version in "English : English".

I set the Authentication timeout less than the session (28 minutes vs 30) but running against the development web server, the session will be wiped on a restart of the server but the authentication sticks around.

@TITLE:Confused with the SmtpClient.UseDefaultCredentials Property
@CONTENT:In my MVC4 application, I am using the SmtpClient to send out email via Gmail's smtp.gmail.com SMTP server. I have configured my Web.Config file with the following settings: <system.net>
 <mailSettings>
  <smtp deliveryMethod="Network">
   <network enableSsl="true" 
   defaultCredentials="false" 
   host="smtp.gmail.com" 
   port="587" 
   userName="xxMyUserNamexx@gmail.com" 
   password="xxMyPasswordxx" />
  </smtp>
 </mailSettings>
</system.net>
 The method that uses the SmtpClient and sends an email message looks like: public void SendMail(string fromDisplayName, string fromEmailAddress, string toEmailAddress, string subject, string body)
{
    MailAddress from = new MailAddress(fromEmailAddress, fromDisplayName);
    MailAddress to = new MailAddress(toEmailAddress);
    MailMessage mailMessage = new MailMessage(from, to);
    mailMessage.Body = body;
    mailMessage.Subject = subject;

    SmtpClient client = new SmtpClient();
    //client.UseDefaultCredentials = false;
    client.Send(mailMessage);
}
 The code above works as expected and is fine. What confuses me is the commented line client.UseDefaultCredentials = false; - If I were to uncomment that line, I will receive an exception message that states: The SMTP server requires a secure connection or the client was not authenticated. The server response was: 5.5.1 Authentication Required. What's more is, it doesn't matter if I set the UseDefaultCredentials property to true or false, I will still receive the exception message. The only way for me to avoid the exception message is to remove the line altogether. Is this behavior normal? Can you explain why I am receiving the exception message?

@TITLE:Generic, type-safe way to flatten arbitrarily nested collections in Scala?
@CONTENT:On occasion I take some time to play with Scala, whose mix of features appeals to me despite an inability to use it in my own work (thus far). For kicks I decided to try the first few 99 Haskell Problems in the most generic way possible X operating on and returning any kind of applicable collection. The first few questions werent too difficult, but I find myself utterly stymied by flatten. I just cant figure out how to type such a thing. To be specific about my question: is it possible to write a type-safe function that flattens arbitrarily-nested SeqLikes? So that, say, flatten(List(Array(List(1, 2, 3), List(4, 5, 6)), Array(List(7, 8, 9), List(10, 11, 12))))
 would return List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12): List[Int]
 ? Note that this isnt quite the same question as in the Haskell and Scala problem sets; Im trying to write a function that flattens not heterogeneous lists but, rather, homogeneous-but-nested sequences. Searching the web I found a translation into Scala of that question, but it operates on and returns a List[Any]. Am I correct that this would require some kind of type recursion? Or am I making this out to be harder than it is?

@TITLE:Loading jQuery with RequireJS - Which is better, a local version or a CDN one?
@CONTENT:EDITED to clarify: In terms of performance (though that's still a wild term, I know), which is better - loading a local version, or a CDN version of jQuery, over RequireJS? For the record, RequireJS online doc contains some passage that seems to discourage CDN using, though I am not really sure 100% about what it means: Do not mix CDN loading with shim config in a build. Example scenario: you load jQuery from the CDN but use the shim config to load something like the stock version of Backbone that depends on jQuery. When you do the build, be sure to inline jQuery in the built file and do not load it from the CDN. Otherwise, Backbone will be inlined in the built file and it will execute before the CDN-loaded jQuery will load. This is because the shim config just delays loading of the files until dependencies are loaded, but does not do any auto-wrapping of define. After a build, the dependencies are already inlined, the shim config cannot delay execution of the non-define()'d code until later. define()'d modules do work with CDN loaded code after a build because they properly wrap their source in define factory function that will not execute until dependencies are loaded. So the lesson: shim config is a stop-gap measure for for non-modular code, legacy code. define()'d modules are better. Theoratically, using a CDN jQuery file would result in 1 more HTTP Request (can't be merged with other JS files using r.js), but has the potential benefit that your visitors may have already cached the CDN version from other sites they've visited. However, if I got it right from the information googled, you still need to offer a local jQuery copy to r.js, as the resulting minified JS file would still need to contain a copy of the jQuery module to ensure the consistence of dependency. That would result in loading jQuery both over local and CDN. (Hope I got this part right?) So, which way is better?

@CONTENT:My User domain class extends SecUser. User has a property 'email'. Spring security uses SecUser's 'username' to login. I need to use 'email' to login. Is there a way to do this? Edit (from the accepted answer): I deleted SecUser's username property and added email property. Then I added this line to Config.groovy: grails.plugins.springsecurity.userLookup.usernamePropertyName = 'email'

@TITLE:Cannot play video with MPMoviePlayerViewController
@CONTENT:I created a fresh project with the following ViewController.m. When I run the app I can see a box of the expected origin/size (38, 100, 250, 163) but it is black and no video playing. There is a strange output in Xcode: 2012-08-23 15:36:45.559 VideoTest1[11398:c07] [MPAVController] Autoplay: Disabling autoplay for pause
2012-08-23 15:36:45.560 VideoTest1[11398:c07] [MPAVController] Autoplay: Disabling autoplay

 Note that the video is converted with Videora iPhone Converter and plays ok in Xcode (so it is not a video problem); the path to the video is ok because when I specify demo-iPhone1 (which does not exist) I get a nil exception. I tried in Simulator and on iPhone: always black box. Any ideas? #import "ViewController.h"

@CONTENT:I'm playing around with Scalas new macros and found this gist from akshaal. As it seams I did not quite get it. Given the following trait (the fieldsMacro is more or less the same as in akshaal example) case class Field[I <: AnyRef](name: String, get: I => Any)

type Fields[I <: AnyRef] = List[Field[I]]

@TITLE:C# WriteFile() Stops Writing at Sector 242 on USB Drives
@CONTENT:I wrote the below code to write 0xFF to all bytes on my USB storeage device. For some reason the WriteFile() calls begin to error out at sector 242. I have done this on two separate USB storage devices and then examined the devices in a hex editor. Sector 242 appears to be the start of the file allocation table on a FAT16 formated device and the start of the boot area on an NTFS device. I'm sure it is no conincidence that it is erroring out at these exact locations, however I do not know how to alter this behavior. The HRESULT I am receiving when the WriteFile fails is -2147024891 which is E_ACCESSDENIED. Does anyone know what could be causing the problem? NOTE: IF you are going to run this code on your local system BE VERY CAREFUL as I have hardcoded the physical device ID for my USB device. Please be sure to update the deviceId variable with the device you are attempting to write to. You do not want to destroy your hard drive.     public enum EMoveMethod : uint

 EDIT/UPDATE I was able to get this to work successfully after doing a low level wipe of the USB device using a third-party tool. After the drive was completely zeroed out I was able to write to the device successfully. It seems as if windows is locking the device as soon as it recognizes a valid fat or ntfs file system and the usage of     const uint FSCTL_LOCK_VOLUME = 0x00090018;
    const uint FSCTL_DISMOUNT_VOLUME = 0x00090020;
 paired with DeviceIoControl does not seem to override the lock windows has on the device. Does anyone know how to successfully lock a removable USB Device in windows using DeviceIoControl on a drive that has a valid file system? I have used several third-party tools that do what I am trying to do and they work successfully. I know that it is possible but all of the MSDN documentation that I have read has not helped to solve the problem. EDIT/UPDATE 2 This is taken from http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff551353.aspx "The application needs to lock the volume, dismount the volume, or both, before it can issue DASD I/O. This is new to Windows Vista and was done to address potentially malicious techniques. The file system will block all write operations to reserved sections of the disk. In this case, those reserved sections include the MBR and the two FAT areas. To block these areas, you need to lock the volume by sending FSCTL_LOCK_VOLUME. You must issue this structure on the same volume handle that performs the actual write operations. This request can fail if there are open file handles. In this case, the application can force a dismount of the file system by issuing FSCTL_DISMOUNT_VOLUME. However, the volume is not actually dismounted until the file handle is closed. Until then, the application can continue to issue DASD I/O by using the same file handle that is currently open. There is an extended region beyond the volume space that is known to the file system where write operations will be blocked. To allow write operations to this region, you must issue FSCTL_ALLOW_EXTENDED_DASD_IO on the volume handle. You can use the Win32 API routine DeviceIoControl to issue all the previous FSCTSs." I believe this is exactly what we are implementing in the above code but it does not appear to be working correctly. We are getting a handle and are locking and dismounting the device so we should be able to write to the protected area correct? EDIT/UPDATE 3 Ok this is the current order of opening disks and volumns.. The methods for locking, dismounting, etc work just the order we think is wrong.. SafeFileHandle volumeHandle = CreateFile("\\.\E:",...);
LockVolume(volumeHandle);
DismountVolume(volumeHandle);
SafeFileHandle diskHandle = CreateFile("\\.\PHYSICALDRIVE1"...);
WriteStuff(diskHandle);
//Fails...
UnlockVolume(volumeHandle);
CloseVolume(volumeHandle);
CloseDisk(diskHandle);
 I am still getting the same results, it only works whenever the disk is trashed.

@TITLE:blocks and ARC - copy or crash with release build (caused by optimization level)
@CONTENT:I'm using Xcode 4.3.3 and developing for iOS 5.0+. In development of an ARC iOS application, I've started using blocks as a callback mechanism for asynchronous operations. The app works fine in the simulator and on the device. Then I ran it the profiler for the first time, and it started crashing on me nearly right away - in particular, an EXC_BAD_ACCESS when trying to invoke the first callback block. After a little investigation, it was clear the difference in behavior was because the profiler runs in "Release mode" by default - in particular, with Optimization Level set to "Fastest, Smallest [-Os]" instead of "None [-O0]". For example, the following code (simplified for this question) would crash when trying to execute the callbackBlock: - (void) setCallbackBlock:(void (^)(NSString *input))block
{
    callbackBlock = block;
}

- (void) invokeCallbackWithInput:(NSString *)input
{
    if (callbackBlock) {
        callbackBlock(input);
    }
}
 Debugging into it, calling setCallbackBlock with optimization level set to "None", the incoming block would be an NSStackBlock, and the callbackBlock would become an NSMallocBlock. However, with Optimization Level "Fastest, Smallest", it remained an NSStackBlock. Changing the setter code to use [block copy] fixes the crashing problem (based on iOS 5 blocks crash only with Release Build). However, another related question indicates that this shouldn't be necessary with ARC - block variables are copied to the heap in ARC - Why does Objective-C block still work without copying it to the heap? So my question: What's going on here, and why? (Also, how can both of those answers be correct...?) Edit: To clarify how callbackBlock is being declared - just above my @implementation where those methods are is this: @interface MyClass ()
{
    void (^callbackBlock)(NSString *input);
}

@end
@CODE:- (void) setCallbackBlock:(void (^)(NSString *input))block
{
    callbackBlock = block;
}

- (void) invokeCallbackWithInput:(NSString *)input
{
    if (callbackBlock) {
        callbackBlock(input);
    }
} NSStackBlock NSMallocBlock NSStackBlock [block copy] @interface MyClass ()
{
    void (^callbackBlock)(NSString *input);
}

@TITLE:Modal View Controller force Landscape orientation in iOS 6
@CONTENT:I have a UITabBarController presented in Portrait mode. On one of the tabs I have a button that shows a UIViewController modally (A simple storyboard segue performs the action). I want this modal view to be shown in Landscape mode, but I can't get it to turn automatically. I have this in the modal views controller - (BOOL)shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation)interfaceOrientation
{
    return (interfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeft);
}
 I've added landscapeLeft to the .plist supported orientations (although this also allows the TabBar to be rotated which I don't want) I've also added this to the ViewDidLoad of the modal view [UIApplication sharedApplication].statusBarOrientation = UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeft;
 but I just can't get it to rotate by itself. Thanks EDIT ---- It seems shouldAutoRotate isn't even being called! Also, I'm trying to detect the orientation and this code below always shows 2, regardless of orientation! if ([[UIDevice currentDevice] orientation] == UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait) {
        NSLog(@"1");
        self.hostView.frame = CGRectMake(0, 60, 200, 255);
    } else {
        NSLog(@"2");
        self.hostView.frame = CGRectMake(0, 45, 480, 255);
    }
 EDIT 2 --- My bad. I guess I should have mentioned I was using iOS 6. The display rotates automatically on iOS 5. shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation is deprecated so I need to read up on the new methods.
@CODE:- (BOOL)shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation)interfaceOrientation
{
    return (interfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeft);
} [UIApplication sharedApplication].statusBarOrientation = UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeft; if ([[UIDevice currentDevice] orientation] == UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait) {

@TITLE:How do I infer the usage of parentheses when translating an expression tree?
@CONTENT:I am working on translating an expression tree to a format that resembles infix notation; I am not evaluating the tree or executing its operations. The tree contains both logical and relational operations, and I would like to emit parentheses in an intelligent manner during the translation. To illustrate, consider the following contrived expression: a < x & (a < y | a == c) & a != d
 If I walk the expression tree produced by this expression in-order, then I will print out the following expression, which is incorrect. a < x & a < y | a == c & a != d
// equivalent to (a < x & a < y) | (a == c & a != d)
 Alternatively, I can again perform an in-order traversal but emit parentheses before and after processing a binary expression. This will produce the following correct expression, but with several redundant parentheses. (((a < x) & ((a < y) | (a == c))) & (a != d))
 Is there an expression tree traversal algorithm that produces optimally-parenthesized expressions? For reference, here is a snippet of the ExpressionVisitor I am using to inspect the tree. class MyVisitor : ExpressionVisitor
{
    protected override Expression VisitBinary(BinaryExpression node)
    {
        Console.Write("(");

        Visit(node.Left);
        Console.WriteLine(node.NodeType.ToString());
        Visit(node.Right);

        Console.Write(")");

        return node;
    }

    // VisitConstant, VisitMember, and VisitParameter omitted for brevity.
}
@CODE:a < x & (a < y | a == c) & a != d a < x & a < y | a == c & a != d

@CONTENT:The Apple Human Interface Guide (HIG) explicitly states that for iPhone Launch images, include the status bar, but for iPad, don't include it. (please see the image at the end of question). (The document revision is as of 2012/3/07). So I supposed any status bar info (carrier, time, battery) will be automatically cropped by either Xcode or iPhone itself, so that it is not shown to the user. But why the inconsistency for iPad? For one, Xcode actually could take in an image, and if it sees that it is the full size 1024 x 768, then crop out the status bar region. And are there other reasons? Such as when iPhone or iPad launches an app, the status bar is always shown on one device while the other device won't always show it, and causing the difference in the rule?

@TITLE:Fastest way to hide thousands of <li> elements?
@CONTENT:I have an autocomplete form where the user can type in a term and it hides all <li> elements that do not contain that term. I originally looped through all <li> with jQuery's each and applied .hide() to the ones that did not contain the term. This was WAY too slow. I found that a faster way is to loop through all <li> and apply class .hidden to all that need to be hidden, and then at the end of the loop do $('.hidden').hide(). This feels kind of hackish though. A potentially faster way might be to rewrite the CSS rule for the .hidden class using document.styleSheets. Can anyone think of an even better way? EDIT: Let me clarify something that I'm not sure too many people know about. If you alter the DOM in each iteration of a loop, and that alteration causes the page to be redrawn, that is going to be MUCH slower than "preparing" all your alterations and applying them all at once when the loop is finished.

@TITLE:SQLAlchemy raw sql vs expression language statements
@CONTENT:When inserting multiple rows in a MySQL-DB via a SQLA-Expression-Language statement, f.e. Foo.__table__.insert().execute([{'bar': 1}, {'bar': 2}, {'bar': 3}])
 it?s extremly slow, when compared to the execution of a "raw" sql statement for the same task, i.e. engine.execute("insert into foo (bar) values (1),(2),(3)")
 What is the reason for this? Can?t SQLA generate a single bulk insert statement and therefore executes multiple inserts? Due to the speed limits of the orm, i need a fast way to add several thousand rows at once, but the SQLA-Expression-Language-Version is too slow. So, do i need to write the raw sql by myself? The documentation isn't too clear about this. I ran a speed test with the ORM insert, the ORM with preassigned PK and the SQLA bulk insert (see SQLA bulk insert speed) like this (https://gist.github.com/3341940): SqlAlchemy ORM: Total time for 500 records 9.61418914795 secs SqlAlchemy ORM pk given: Total time for 500 records 9.56391906738 secs SqlAlchemy Core: Total time for 500 records 9.5362598896 secs SQLAlchemy RAW String Execution: Total time for 500 records 1.233677 secs As you can see, there is practically no difference between the three versions. Only the execution of a raw string insert, where all the records are included in the raw sql statement is significantly faster. Thus, for fast inserts, SQLA seems sub-optimal.

@CONTENT:i'm back with one more question related to BASS. I already had posted this question How Can we control bass of music in iPhone, but not get as much attention of your people as it should get. But now I have done some more search and had read the Core AUDIO. I got one sample code which i want to share with you people here is the link to download it iPhoneMixerEqGraphTest. Have a look on it in this code what i had seen is the developer had use preset Equalizer given by iPod in Apple. Lets see some code snippet too:---- // iPodEQ unit
CAComponentDescription eq_desc(kAudioUnitType_Effect, kAudioUnitSubType_AUiPodEQ, kAudioUnitManufacturer_Apple);
 What kAudioUnitSubType_AUiPodEQ does is it get preset values from iPod's equalizer and return us in Xcode in an array which we can use in PickerView/TableView and can set any category like bass, rock, Dance etc. It is helpless for me as it only returns names of equalizer types like bass, rock, Dance etc. as i want to implement bass only and want to implement it on UISLider. To implement Bass on slider i need values so that i can set minimum and maximum value so that on moving slider bass can be changed. After getting all this i start reading Core Audio's Audio Unit framework's classes and got this after that i start searching for bass control and got this So now i need to implement this kAudioUnitSubType_LowShelfFilter. But now i don't know how to implement this enum in my code so that i can control the bass as written documentation. Even Apple had not write that how can we use it. kAudioUnitSubType_AUiPodEQ this category was returning us an array but kAudioUnitSubType_LowShelfFilter category is not returning any array. While using kAudioUnitSubType_AUiPodEQ this category we can use types of equalizer from an array but how can we use this category kAudioUnitSubType_LowShelfFilter. Can anybody help me regarding this in any manner? It would be highly appreciable. Thanks.

@LINK:/questions/11833808/how-to-detect-a-socket-disconnect-in-c-sharp
@TITLE:How to detect a Socket Disconnect in C#
@CONTENT:I'm working on a client/server relationship that is meant to push data back and forth for an indeterminate amount of time. The problem I'm attempting to overcome is on the client side, being that I cannot manage to find a way to detect a disconnect. I've taken a couple of passes at other peoples solutions, ranging from just catching IO Exceptions, to polling the socket on all three SelectModes. I've also tried using a combination of a poll, with a check on the 'Available' field of the socket. // Something like this
Boolean IsConnected()
{
    try
    {
        bool part1 = this.Connection.Client.Poll(1000, SelectMode.SelectRead);
        bool part2 = (this.Connection.Client.Available == 0);

        if (part1 & part2)
        {
            // Never Occurs
            //connection is closed
            return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
    catch( IOException e )
    {
        // Never Occurs Either
    }
}
 On the server side, an attempt to write an 'empty' character ( \0 ) to the client forces an IO Exception and the server can detect that the client has disconnected ( pretty easy gig ). On the client side, the same operation yields no exception. // Something like this
Boolean IsConnected( )
{
    try
    {

        this.WriteHandle.WriteLine("\0");
        this.WriteHandle.Flush();
        return true;
    }
    catch( IOException e )
    {
        // Never occurs
        this.OnClosed("Yo socket sux");
        return false;
    }
}
 A problem that I believe I am having in detecting a disconnect via a poll, is that I can fairly easily encounter a false on a SelectRead, if my server hasn't yet written anything back to the client since the last check... Not sure what to do here, I've chased down every option to make this detection that I can find and nothing has been 100% for me, and ultimately my goal here is to detect a server (or connection) failure, inform the client, wait to reconnect, etc. So I am sure you can imagine that this is an integral piece. Appreciate anyone's suggestions. Thanks ahead of time. EDIT: Anyone viewing this question should note the answer below, and my FINAL Comments on it. I've elaborated on how I overcame this problem, but have yet to make a 'Q&A' style post.
@CODE:// Something like this
Boolean IsConnected()
{
    try
    {
        bool part1 = this.Connection.Client.Poll(1000, SelectMode.SelectRead);
        bool part2 = (this.Connection.Client.Available == 0);

        if (part1 & part2)
        {
            // Never Occurs
            //connection is closed
            return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
    catch( IOException e )
    {
        // Never Occurs Either
    }
} // Something like this
Boolean IsConnected( )

    try
    {

        this.WriteHandle.WriteLine("\0");
        this.WriteHandle.Flush();

@CONTENT:I have trouble with using capybara to test tinymce form. I'm using tinymce-rails and have 7 editors in my form. Also I'm using asciimath plugin with tinymce. Everything works fine, but I'm unable to write tests to fill in tinymce editor. Here is how my step definition code looks like, very similar to what is described here: within_frame("content_ifr") do
  editor = page.find_by_id('tinymce')
  editor.native.send_keys 'test'
end
 The problem is when I run the following: editor.native.clear            # works, clear the editor area, I'm testing this with pry
editor.native.send_keys :tab   # works, moves focus to next input
editor.native.send_keys 'test' # returns "", nothing happens, nothing in editor
 So clear and send_keys :tab work as expected. But I can't send any string. send_keys function is always returning empty string, and nothing happens when I do test using pry. What is going wrong here? and how can I debug / investigate the problem? Thanks.
@CODE:within_frame("content_ifr") do

@TITLE:Handle arabic string in PHP with Eclipse
@CONTENT:I am currently working on the localization of a website, which was first in english only. A third party company did the translations, and provided us with an excel file with the translations. Which I successfully converted to a PHP array that I can use in my views. I'm using Eclipse for Windows to edit my PHP files. All is fine, except that I need to add variables in my strings, ex: '%1 is now following %2'
 In arabic I was provided with strings like this one: '_______???? ????? _______'
 I find that replacing __ with %1 and %2 is incredibly difficult because the arabic part is a right to left string, and the %1, %2 will be considered left-to-right, or right-to-left, and I'm not sure . I hardly have the results I expect with the order of my param, because %1 will sometimes go to the left of the string, sometimes on the right, depending on where I start to type. Copy-pasting the replacement strings can also have the same strange effects. Most of the times I end up with a string like this one: %2???? ????? %1
 The %1 should be at right hand site, the %2 at the left hand site. The %1 is obviously considered right-to-left string because the % appears on the right. The %2 is considered left-to-right. I'm sure someone as this issue before. Is there any way it can be done easily in Eclipse? Or using a smarter editor for arabic issues? Or maybe it is a Windows issue? Is there a workaround? UPDATE I also tried splitting my string into multiple strings, but this also changes the order of the parameters: '%1' . '???? ????' . '%2'
 UPDATE 2 It seems that changing the replacement string makes things better. It is probably linked to how numbers are handled in Arabic strings. This string was edited in Eclipse without any problem. The order of the parameter is correct, the string is handled correctly by PHP: '{var2} ???? ????? {var1}'
 If no other solution is found, this could be a good alternative.

 Basically, "BarViewModel" has a parameterless ctor which sets up properties in the class. So i'm trying to say to AutoMapper: If the value is null, then use the ctor for the class. otherwise use the mapping you have in place The above is giving me a C# compiler error. And i'm guessing a cast wouldn't work either. So is there a AutoMapper trick to do this? Worst case i could remove that mapping for that property, and just do: var mapped = Mapper.Map<Foo,Foo2>(src);
if (mapped.Bar == null) mapped.Bar = new BarViewModel();
 But that's a tad ugly. Ideas?

Unfortunately, Java's Polygon object comes in int precision only, and there is no equivalent Polygon2D like there is with Rectangle and Rectangle2D. I've already done enough research to see that I have a few options, but none of them seem very good. Use Path2D. According to a Java developer posting in this forum, the lack of Polygon2D was an oversight, but its suggested replacement is Path2D. Unfortunately, Path2D doesn't provide a way to access its individual vertices or edges, which I need in order to do collision detection (specifically I need to get a vector orthogonal to each edge). Implement my own Polygon2D that implements the Shape interface so that I can still pass it to Graphics2D.draw(Shape). This looks like it would be pretty difficult. The Shape interface requires tricky-to-implement methods like contains(Rectangle2D) and getPathIterator(AffineTransform). For getPathIterator in particular, it seems that in order to implement it I'd need to return an object of type PathIterator, but there are no concrete implementations of the PathIterator interface available in the public AWT packages. Wrap Path2D in an object that "remembers" the individual vertices and provides them to the client. This worked for me when I needed an Area that remembered its component shapes: I wrapped it in a CompoundShape class that implemented the Shape interface and forwarded all the Shape methods to Area's implementation of them, while keeping track of each Shape that was added to the Area in an ArrayList. The problem with this is that if I keep track of the individual vertices in two arrays of floats, there is no way to expose them to the user without the possibility of the user changing the vertices - and since that would happen by direct array access, the internal Path2D wouldn't get notified of the changes. Copy Polygon.java. The actual source code of Java's Polygon class is available on grepcode.com, and I could simply replace the vertex-related ints with floats throughout to get a Polygon2D. Unfortunately, when I tried this, the line import sun.awt.geom.Crossings; threw a compiler error saying "The type Crossings is not accessible due to restriction on required library C:\Program Files\Java\jre7\lib\rt.jar." According to this question that happens because Sun's license agreement prevents you from replacing core Java classes with your own, but Polygon doesn't try to do that - it simply creates an object of type sun.awt.geom.Crossings, no replacing or extending happens, and I made sure to put my copy of Polygon in a package not called "java". What's the best way to proceed with this? I'd appreciate either suggestions for how make one of these options work or an idea for another option that doesn't have the problems these encounter.

@TITLE:Android: Sine Wave Generation
@CONTENT:I'm trying to use AudioTrack to generate sine, square, and sawtooth waves. However, the audio this is creating doesn't sound like a pure sine wave, but like it has some kind of other wave overlayed. How would I go about getting the pure sine wave like in the second code example, while using the method in my first example? Since the top example only moves around some of the arithmetic used in the second, shouldn't they produce an identical wave? @Override
        protected Void doInBackground(Void... foo) {
            short[] buffer = new short[1024];
            this.track = new AudioTrack(AudioManager.STREAM_MUSIC, 44100, AudioFormat.CHANNEL_CONFIGURATION_MONO, AudioFormat.ENCODING_PCM_16BIT, minBufferSize, AudioTrack.MODE_STREAM);
            float samples[] = new float[1024];

            this.track.play();

            while (true) {
                for (int i = 0; i < samples.length; i++) {
                    samples[i] = (float) Math.sin( (float)i * ((float)(2*Math.PI) * frequency / 44100));    //the part that makes this a sine wave....
                    buffer[i] = (short) (samples[i] * Short.MAX_VALUE);
                }
                this.track.write( buffer, 0, samples.length );  //write to the audio buffer.... and start all over again!

            }           
        }
 Note: This does give me a pure sine wave: @Override
        protected Void doInBackground(Void... foo) {
            short[] buffer = new short[1024];
            this.track = new AudioTrack(AudioManager.STREAM_MUSIC, 44100, AudioFormat.CHANNEL_CONFIGURATION_MONO, AudioFormat.ENCODING_PCM_16BIT, minBufferSize, AudioTrack.MODE_STREAM);
            float increment = (float)(2*Math.PI) * frequency / 44100; // angular increment for each sample
            float angle = 0;
            float samples[] = new float[1024];

            this.track.play();

            while (true) {
                for (int i = 0; i < samples.length; i++) {
                    samples[i] = (float) Math.sin(angle);   //the part that makes this a sine wave....
                    buffer[i] = (short) (samples[i] * Short.MAX_VALUE);
                    angle += increment;
                }
                this.track.write( buffer, 0, samples.length );  //write to the audio buffer.... and start all over again!

            }           
        }
 Thanks to Martijn: The problem is that the wave is getting cut off between wavelengths in the buffer. Increasing the buffer size solves the problem in the second example. It appears that the Math.PI * 2 arithmetic was the most intensive of the loop, so moving that value to an external variable that is only computed once solves everything.

@TITLE:how to set an array as a mysql user variable
@CONTENT:I didn't expect to find this so difficult, but I'm trying to set a user variable in MySQL to contain an array of values. I have no clue how to do this so tried doing some research and was quite suprised to find no answer. I have tried: SET @billable_types = ['client1','client2','client3'];
 The reason being I would like to use the variable in the following statement later on: SELECT sum((time_to_sec(timediff(tlg.time_stop, tlg.time_start))/3600)) as billable_hours
    from mod_tmlog_time_log tlg, mod_tmlog_task_list mttl

            and tlg.task_id = mttl.id
    group by start_date

 Would be very grateful for help. Fast forward a while, I ended up with the following quick and dirty solution which doesn't give me the flexibility of re-using the array elsewhere in the code but hey it's an unchargeable admin task so I don't want to spend any more time on it. SELECT WEEKDAY(tlg.time_start) AS day_of_week, date(tlg.time_start) as start_date,

@LINK:/questions/11422806/why-do-gcm-docs-recommend-invalidating-registration-on-app-update
@TITLE:why do gcm docs recommend invalidating registration on app update?
@CONTENT:From the GCM docs: When an application is updated, it should invalidate its existing registration ID, as it is not guaranteed to work with the new version. Because there is no lifecycle method called when the application is updated, the best way to achieve this validation is by storing the current application version when a registration ID is stored. Then when the application is started, compare the stored value with the current application version. If they do not match, invalidate the stored data and start the registration process again. When the docs state that "it is not guaranteed to work with the new version" is that a GCM limitation or are they speculating about potential changes in my app's behavior from version to version? From the app side I can more-or-less guarantee that successive versions will function properly with respect to GCM and whatever app-specific message format I concoct. Do I still need to re-register? If so, which should I use to detect a "new version": version code or version name? My understanding is that these are "free form" and the app developer sets them to whatever values he chooses. So, what if I put an app update in the store but don't change versionName or versionCode; would I need to re-register with GCM? It seems like what GCM actually wants is for the app to re-register each time a new installation is launched for the first time (and each time it's successively launched until registration is complete), regardless of the values in versionName and versionCode. Is that an accurate statement?

@TITLE:Streaming RTP/RTSP: sync/timestamp problems
@CONTENT:I'm having some trouble streaming H.264 video over RTSP. The goal is to live-stream a camera image to an RTSP client (ideally a browser plugin in the end). This has been working pretty well so far, except for one problem: the video will lag on startup, stutter every few seconds, and has a ~4-second delay. This is bad. Our setup is to encode with x264 (w/ zerolatency & ultrafast) and packed into RTSP/RTP with libavformat from ffmpeg 0.6.5. For testing, I'm receiving the stream with a GStreamer pipeline with gst-launch when connecting to an RTSP server. However, I've been able to reproduce the same issue when streaming straight from another GStreamer instance with just RTP. Sending machine: gst-launch videotestsrc ! x264enc tune=zerolatency ! rtph264pay ! udpsink host=10.89.6.3
 Receiving machine: gst-launch udpsrc ! application/x-rtp,payload=96 ! rtph264depay ! decodebin ! xvimagesink
 You can also run these both on the same machine, just change the host to 127.0.0.1 on the sender. On the receiving end, you should notice stuttering and generally poor-performing video, along with repeated warnings on the console: WARNING: from element /GstPipeline:pipeline0/GstXvImageSink:xvimagesink0: A lot of buffers are being dropped.
Additional debug info:
gstbasesink.c(2875): gst_base_sink_is_too_late (): /GstPipeline:pipeline0/GstXvImageSink:xvimagesink0:
There may be a timestamping problem, or this computer is too slow.
 One commonly-suggested "fix" that I've seen all over the Internet is to use sync=false with xvimagesink: gst-launch udpsrc ! application/x-rtp,payload=96 ! rtph264depay ! decodebin ! xvimagesink sync=false
 The video will then play back with near-zero latency, even when tested with our camera software. This is useful for testing, but is not very useful for deployment, as it won't work with Totem, VLC, or their browser plugin embeds. I'd like to try to solve the issue at the source; I'm suspicious that there's some sort of timestamp info missing on the H.264 stream by x264 or perhaps on the RTP payloads. Is there any way to modify the source gst pipeline so that I do not need to use sync=false on the receiver? If that's not possible, how can I tell clients (via SDP or otherwise) that the stream should not be synchronized? Ultimately, we'd embed this in the browser using a VLC plugin of sorts, so a solution that would work there would be even better.

@TITLE:Converting an OpenCV BGR 8-bit Image to CIE L*a*b*
@CONTENT:I am trying to convert a given Mat representing an RGB image with 8-bit depth to Lab using the function provided in the documentation: cvtColor(source, destination, <conversion code>);
 I have tried the following conversion codes: CV_RGB2Lab
CV_BGR2Lab
CV_LBGR2Lab
 I have received bizarre results each time around, with an "L" value of greater than 100 for some samples, literally <107, 125, 130>. I am also using Photoshop to check the results - but given that 107 is beyond the accepted range of 0 ? L ? 100, I can not comprehend what my error is. Update: I'll post my overall results here: Given an image (Mat) represented by 8-bit BGR, the image can be converted by the following: cvtColor(source, destination, CV_BGR2Lab);
 The pixel values can then be accessed in the following manner: int step = destination.step;
int channels = destination.channels();
for (int i = 0; i < destination.rows(); i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < destination.cols(); j++) {
        Point3_<uchar> pixelData;
        //L*: 0-255 (elsewhere is represented by 0 to 100)
        pixelData.x = destination.data[step*i + channels*j + 0];
        //a*: 0-255 (elsewhere is represented by -127 to 127)
        pixelData.y = destination.data[step*i + channels*j + 1];
        //b*: 0-255 (elsewhere is represented by -127 to 127)
        pixelData.z = destination.data[step*i + channels*j + 2];
    }
}

@TITLE:What is the best way of grouping OSGi bundles to make a coherent 'application'
@CONTENT:The "OSGi way" is to develop separate bundles containing discrete, coherent pieces of functionality. Sometimes these bundles contain utility classes, sometimes they depend on utility classes and set up their own OSGi Services. Users, on the other hand, are unlikely to be exposed to bundles. They care more about the application, a piece of software that performs a task or solves their problem. Normally an application will use multiple bundles (say, imported via Import-Package) to perform its tasks. What is the best way to formalise this relationship in the OSGi world? One example requirement would be something as simple as showing the current version number of the application (not the bundle(s)) to to the user. How would this version number be discovered? Eclipse has a concept called 'features' but this is not OSGi standard. Peter Kriens has written about OSGi applications and his article makes sense. My take away from it was that an application can map to a bundle; it's just that the bundle uses other bundles in some way. But if one is to create an application bundle using Import-Package, I don't see how that can be feasible from a development point of view. One way may be to have an 'application bundle' that uses Require-Bundle and has its own version, but Require-Bundle is frowned up in the OSGi world. Using Import-Package to import all the required packages with the required versions, however, adds a significant maintenance overhead to the developer to the extent that I don't think it's feasible. Each time the smallest change is made, even to an implementation package, the package version must be updated, and then the dependency on the package version updated in the 'application bundle'.

@TITLE:How to add d3 (javascript) to a vaadin application?
@CONTENT:Good evening guys, I'm currently trying to add the visualization functionality of d3 to my vaadin application. If you don't know what d3 is, here is a quick link: http://d3js.org/ Yet I am stuck with some problems: How can I add the "d3.v2.js" javascript file/library, that is necessary for developing with d3? I tried adding it to an own theme (WebContent/VAADIN/themes/myOwnTheme/..), but through refreshing in eclipse I'm getting the message: "Errors occurred during the build. Errors running builder 'JavaScript Validator' on project 'VaadinD3Testproject'. 14". I guess that's because the js-file might be too large with around 8000 lines ? I read about somehow adding the file to the web.xml? Is there a way? How can I then add javascript code to my vaadin application? After my research I know that there are the options to use: getMainWindow().executeJavaScript("alert('foo');") or Label test = new Label("move mouse over here.. ",Label.CONTENT_XHTML); --> Are there any other ways to integrate javascript code ? Could someone help me with an kind of "step by step" explanation, how to solve both ways? Help would really be appreciated here, since I'm not that experienced with this. ------- UPDATE ----------- How can I add the "d3.v2.js" javascript file/library, that is necessary for developing with d3? I tried adding it to an own theme (WebContent/VAADIN/themes/myOwnTheme/..), but through refreshing I'm getting the message: "Errors occurred during the build. Errors running builder 'JavaScript Validator' on project 'VaadinD3Testproject'. 14". I guess that's because the js-file might be too large with around 8000 lines ? I read about somehow adding the file to the web.xml? Is there a way? I fixed this error appearing, it was a problem with my eclipse and the inbuild javascript validator. I was now able to load the js-file into my application by overwriting the ajax class with an own servlet, as it has been described here in several posts. I have now tried several ways: getMainWindow.executeJavaScript() doesn't work in a way that I could use d3 with, somehow as soon as I want to add some d3 code, like "d3.select("body") .append("svg");", it just doesn't execute it (no matter if I do the tags around or not, but I noticed in general that code in tags wont get executed) I tried using a CustimLayout, as it has been shown in some examples of this forum, but it's again like described above. When I check the websites sourcecode my code is simply missing or parsed out Labels wont work anymore, no matter if XHTML or RAW mode, exception occures Overwriting another servlet method that is called when the bodys is built at server start, the result was that I got an error message that vaadin couldn't even load the default widgetset anymore. So, what's left? Is there really no way to integrate d3 with vaadin? Did never anyone try this? I read a lot also yesterday about the upcoming vaadin 7. But would it even be kind of an option to use an alpha version from which I have no idea about its stability (I guess that's why it's called alpha ) Thanks for every thought you're sharing with me

@TITLE:Implementing a cron type scheduler in clojure
@CONTENT:I'm looking for any way for clojure that can trigger an event at a given time, For example: I want a particular process to start at 9:30am and then I can trigger another process to start running half an hour later etc. Thanks in advance! Updated 2: Thanks @arthur-ulfeoldt and @unknown-person who also suggested using https://github.com/samaaron/at-at before deleting his answer. The documentation is a little out of date but here's how I got going. 
(use 'overtone.at-at)

(def my-pool (mk-pool))
;=> make a thread pool

(every 1000 #(println "I am super cool!") my-pool :initial-delay 2000) 
;=> starts print function every 1 sec after a 2 sec delay

(stop *1) 
;=> stops it
 So to make it start at exactly 9, with an interval of half an hour, I would do: 
(require '[clj-time.core :as t])
(require '[clj-time.coerce :as c])
(use 'overtone.at-at)

;Make Thread Pool
(def my-pool (mk-pool))

(def current-time (t/now))

(def current-date (t/date-time 
                    (t/year current-time)
                    (t/month current-time)
                    (t/day current-time)))

(def next-9-oclock
  (if (> 9 (t/hour current-time))
    (t/plus current-date (t/hours 9))
    (t/plus current-date (t/days 1) (t/hours 9))))

(def initial-delay
   (- (c/to-long next-9-oclock) (c/to-long current-time))

(every 1800000 
       #(println "I am super cool!") 
       my-pool 
       :initial-delay 
       initial-delay) 

 Updated: @arthur-ulfeoldt, I am not sure how to translate some of the java code into clojure. http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ScheduledExecutorService.html like: final ScheduledFuture<?> beeperHandle = 
        scheduler.scheduleAtFixedRate(beeper, 10, 10, SECONDS);
 and: final Runnable beeper = new Runnable() {
        public void run() { System.out.println("beep"); }
     };
 Entire Example 
 class BeeperControl {
    private final ScheduledExecutorService scheduler = 
       Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1);

    public void beepForAnHour() {
        final Runnable beeper = new Runnable() {
                public void run() { System.out.println("beep"); }
            };
        final ScheduledFuture beeperHandle = 
            scheduler.scheduleAtFixedRate(beeper, 10, 10, SECONDS);
        scheduler.schedule(new Runnable() {
                public void run() { beeperHandle.cancel(true); }
            }, 60 * 60, SECONDS);
    }
 }
@CODE:final ScheduledFuture<?> beeperHandle = 
        scheduler.scheduleAtFixedRate(beeper, 10, 10, SECONDS); final Runnable beeper = new Runnable() {
        public void run() { System.out.println("beep"); }
     };

@TITLE:Form Collection Error
@CONTENT:I am trying to take one form type and display it however times i need for the user to upload a patch upload at one time. So say 30 files to uploaded, 30 forms on the page. I am receiving this error: The form's view data is expected to be of type scalar, array or an instance of \ArrayAccess, but is an instance of class MS\CoreBundle\Entity\Photo. You can avoid this error by setting the "data_class" option to "MS\CoreBundle\Entity\Photo" or by adding a view transformer that transforms an instance of class MS\CoreBundle\Entity\Photo to scalar, array or an instance of \ArrayAccess. The Gallery Type code is: public function buildForm(FormBuilderInterface $builder, array $options)
{
    $builder->add('photo', 'collection', array(
        'type' => new PhotoType(),
        'allow_add' => true,
        'data_class' => 'MS\CoreBundle\Entity\Photo',
        'prototype' => true,
        'by_reference' => false,
    ));
}
 The Photo Type code is: public function buildForm(FormBuilderInterface $builder, array $options)
    {
        $builder->add('description', 'text', array('label' => "Title:", 'required' => true))
                ->add('File')

@TITLE:How to process parallel HTTP request in go programming language?
@CONTENT:I was playing with the go HTTP package. I wanted to process request in parallel as I do in java. But I couldn't. I created a simple web server, put a sleep in the middle and realized that go process one request per time, so if I did a refresh on my browser, the process of the first request has to finish until the second request start processing, here is the code: func main(){

    //Process the http commands
    fmt.Printf("Starting http Server ... ")
    http.Handle("/", http.HandlerFunc(sayHello))
    err := http.ListenAndServe("0.0.0.0:8080", nil)

func sayHello(c http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
    fmt.Printf("New Request\n")
    processRequest(c, req)
}

func processRequest(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request){
    time.Sleep(time.Second*3)
    w.Write([]byte("Go Says Hello(Via http)"))
    fmt.Println("End")
}
 As I wanted to process both request in parallel I added the "go" command before "processRequest(c, req)" in "sayHello" function in order to process each request in a different gorutine. But... it doesn't work.... I don't know why. I know that both request are processed because I see the printed line at the console but the browser keep waiting for information..... and don't show my response. So... my questions, Does each request create a new http.ResponseWriter? or it's use the same? Do you know how to indicate the web server to process each request with different threads? Any help is welcomed.... Fersca

@TITLE:How to handle exceptions in OnNext when using ObserveOn?
@CONTENT:My application terminates when an error is thrown in OnNext by an observer when I use ObserveOn(Scheduler.ThreadPool). The only way I have found to deal with this is by using a custom extension method below (apart from making sure OnNext never throws an exception). And then making sure that each ObserveOn is followed by an ExceptionToError.     public static IObservable<T> ExceptionToError<T>(this IObservable<T> source) {
        var sub = new Subject<T>();
        source.Subscribe(i => {
            try {
                sub.OnNext(i);
            } catch (Exception err) {
                sub.OnError(err);
            }
        }
            , e => sub.OnError(e), () => sub.OnCompleted());
        return sub;
    }
 However, this does not feel right. Is there a better way to deal with this? Example This program crashes because of uncaught exception. class Program {
    static void Main(string[] args) {
        try {
            var xs = new Subject<int>();

            xs.ObserveOn(Scheduler.ThreadPool).Subscribe(x => {

@TITLE:Minimum damaging costs in graph
@CONTENT:We are given a graph G(V,E) with N nodes (Numbered from 0 to N-1) and exactly (N-1) two-way Edges. Each edge in a graph has a positive cost C(u,v)(Edge weight). The entire graph is such that there is a unique path between any pair of Nodes. We are also given a List L of node number,at which bomb are placed. Our aim is to damage/remove the edge from the graph such ,that after damaging/removing the edges from the graph ,there is no connection among the Bombs -- that is after damaging, there is no path between any two bombs. The cost of damaging the Edge(u,v) = Edge weight(u,v). So, we have to damage those edges, such that the total damaging cost is minimum. Example: Total Nodes=N=5 
Total Bomb=Size of List L=3

List L={2,4,0}//Thats is at node number 2,4 and 0 bomb is placed...

Total Edges =N-1=4 edges are::

u v Edge-Weight

2 1 8

1 0 5

2 4 5

1 3 4



In this case the answer is ::
Total Damaging cost =(Edge Weight (2,4) + Edge Weight(0,1))
           =5+5=10.

So when we remove the edge connecting node (2,4),
and the edge connecting node (0,1) ,there is no connection left 
between any pair of machines in List {2,4,0};

Note any other,combinations of edges(that  we damaged ) to achieve the
target goal ,needs more than 10 unit cost.  
 Constraints::
N(ie. Number of Nodes) <= 100,000
ListSize |L|(ie. Number of Bombs) <= N
1 <=Edge cost(u,v) <= 1000,000
 What i had done? Until now, I had not found any efficient way :( . Further, as the number of nodes is N, the number of edges is exactly N-1 and the entire graph is such there is a Unique path between any pair of Nodes, I got a conclusion that the graph is a TREE. I tried to modify the Kruskal algorithm but that didn't help me either. Thanks!
@CODE:Total Nodes=N=5 
Total Bomb=Size of List L=3

List L={2,4,0}//Thats is at node number 2,4 and 0 bomb is placed...

Total Edges =N-1=4 edges are::

u v Edge-Weight

2 1 8

1 0 5

2 4 5

1 3 4



In this case the answer is ::
Total Damaging cost =(Edge Weight (2,4) + Edge Weight(0,1))
           =5+5=10.

So when we remove the edge connecting node (2,4),
and the edge connecting node (0,1) ,there is no connection left 
between any pair of machines in List {2,4,0};

Note any other,combinations of edges(that  we damaged ) to achieve the
target goal ,needs more than 10 unit cost. Constraints::
N(ie. Number of Nodes) <= 100,000
ListSize |L|(ie. Number of Bombs) <= N
1 <=Edge cost(u,v) <= 1000,000 N N-1

@TITLE:How to change a console application to a windows form application?
@CONTENT:I had been developing a console application, until our project needed a fancy UI to go with it, so we decided to change the project type to windows form application. We tried putting the code below in our entry point:         Application.EnableVisualStyles();
        Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(false);
        Application.Run(new UI());
 It kind of works, but the original console window is still there. I've googled out some useful infos like this one, but what all they do is essentially killing the window after it has been created, not tackling the root of the problem. So is there any more elegant way to do this?
@CODE:Application.EnableVisualStyles();
        Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(false);
        Application.Run(new UI());

@CONTENT:I have the same problem that is listed in the following thread. WSDL first WCF server where client does not send SOAPAction I performed the steps that are listed in the same thread (also shown below) 1) Download the Microsoft WCF examples. Add the following files to your project from WF_WCF_Samples\WCF\Extensibility\Interop\RouteByBody\CS\service DispatchByBodyOperationSelector.cs DispatchByBodyBehaviorAttribute.cs 2) Add the following attributes to your interface (next to your ServiceContract) XmlSerializerFormat

DispatchByBodyBehavior
 3) Add the following to your service interface [OperationContract(Action = "")]

public void DoNothing()
{
}
 4) For my service the WrapperName and Wrappernamespace are null for all messages. I had to go into DispatchByBodyBehaviorAttribute and edit ApplyDispatchBehavior() to add the following lines to check for this:  if (qname.IsEmpty) {
     qname = new XmlQualifiedName(operationDescription.Messages[0].Body.Parts[0].Name, operationDescription.Messages[0].Body.Parts[0].Namespace);
 }
 Now, I am getting an error message "This message cannot support the operation because it has been read". I turned the tracing on and captured the stack trace (below). If anyone has any idea on how this can be resolved, I appreciate if you could post some comments. Thanks for any help! at System.ServiceModel.Channels.Message.GetReaderAtBodyContents()

@TITLE:Benchmark of Java Try/Catch Block
@CONTENT:I know that going into a catch block has some significance cost when executing a program, however, I was wondering if entering a try{} block also had any impact so I started looking for an answer in google with many opinions, but no benchmarking at all. Some answers I found were: Java try/catch performance, is it recommended to keep what is inside the try clause to a minimum? Try Catch Performance Java Java try catch blocks However they didn't answer my question with facts, so I decided to try it for myself. Here's what I did. I have a csv file with this format: host;ip;number;date;status;email;uid;name;lastname;promo_code; where everything after status is optional and will not even have the corresponding ; , so when parsing a validation has to be done to see if the value is there, here's where the try/catch issue came to my mind. The current code that I inherited in my company does this: StringTokenizer st=new StringTokenizer(line,";");  
String host = st.nextToken();
String ip = st.nextToken();
String number = st.nextToken();
String date = st.nextToken();
String status = st.nextToken();                             
String email = "";
try{
    email = st.nextToken();
}catch(NoSuchElementException e){
    email = "";
}
 and it repeats what it's done for email with uid, name, lastname and promo_code. and I changed everything to: if(st.hasMoreTokens()){
    email = st.nextToken();
}
 and in fact it performs faster. When parsing a file that doesn't have the optional columns. Here are the average times:  --- Trying:122 milliseconds
 --- Checking:33 milliseconds
 however, here's what confused me and the reason I'm asking: When running the example with values for the optional columns in all 8000 lines of the CSV, the if() version still performs better than the try/catch version, so my question is Does really the try block does not have any performance impact on my code? The average times for this example are: --- Trying:105 milliseconds
--- Checking:43 milliseconds
 Can somebody explain what's going on here? Thanks a lot

@TITLE:Stay Logged In Best Practices: How does a username in the cookie make it more secure?
@CONTENT:This is a branch of another question: What is the best way to implement "remember me" for a website? The top answer is to implement this: http://jaspan.com/improved_persistent_login_cookie_best_practice A summary: Use a random number as a Series Token, and another as a Login Token. Place those in the Stay Logged In cookie, along with the username. Assign a second, normal Session cookie. Each time a user arrives without a Session cookie, consume the Stay Logged In cookie. Issue a new one, this time with a new random Login Token, keeping the Series Token the same. Why include the username? How is that helping? The Series Token should be enough to identify the user and series. The Series Token was added in this approach to prevent a DoS attack where an attacker just guesses all usernames and hits the site all at once, logging everyone out. But why does it make sense to leave the username in at all?

    Log.e("TEST", "canvas width: " + canvas.getWidth() + "");
    Log.e("TEST", "view width: " + this.getWidth() + "");

    Log.e("TEST", "canvas height: " + canvas.getHeight() + "");
    Log.e("TEST", "view height: " + this.getHeight() + "");
}
 And this is the result: canvas width: 320
view width: 480
canvas height: 533

canvas height: 533
view height: 300
 Part from my main.xml     android:layout_width="480px"
    android:layout_height="300px"
 According to my Log prints and part of my xml, size of view is correct. My device is 480x800 and both width and height divided by Log results give 1.5 (800/533=1.5 and 480/320=1.5), so it seems I get Canvas from entire screen to draw on. Why is this, and why is it so small and what should I do to draw in normal way?

@TITLE:A strange generics edge case with Mockito.when() and generic type inference
@CONTENT:I'm writing a test case that uses a java.beans.PropertyDescriptor using Mockito, and I want to mock the behavior of getPropertyType() to return an arbitrary Class<?> object (in my case, String.class). Normally, I would do that by just invoking: // we already did an "import static org.mockito.Mockito.*"
when(mockDescriptor.getPropertyType()).thenReturn(String.class);
 However, oddly, this does not compile: cannot find symbol method thenReturn(java.lang.Class<java.lang.String>)
 But when I specify the type parameter instead of depending on inference: Mockito.<Class<?>>when(mockDescriptor.getPropertyType()).thenReturn(String.class);
 everything is hunky dory. Why can't the compiler correctly infer the return type of when() in this case? I have never had to specify the parameter before like that.
@CODE:java.beans.PropertyDescriptor getPropertyType() Class<?> String.class // we already did an "import static org.mockito.Mockito.*"

Now I do following inside iframe. var jQuery = parent.jQuery;
console.log(jQuery('#form-elem').val());
 According to my limited knowledge of JS I should see Hello World! on console but instead I see undefined. Now, my question is do I need to load jquery again in an iframe or can I utilise jquery object already loaded in parent window? Do note that this is not as usual access iframe/parent content from parent/iframe.

What I need I think is the add method where I pass to them a String (path of the file) and it add it to the correct place in the tree creating correct nodes (Folder) if they are not already there This tree structure will need me to get list of nodes when I'm on node and list of leafs (but I think this will be a normal features for trees) I will always have Strings as paths and not real file or folders. Is there something ready to use or a source code to start? Thank you very much.

It's probably confusing, but hopefully you get the idea. Larry sends request via POST to get user details. Server looks in lib/api to find the function associated with that request. Server carrys out action and sends back data to Larry. Hopefully you can help me out. I was thinking it could be done using prototypes, not sure though. Thanks!

@TITLE:How do I manually populate ViewModel (Not using AutoMapper!)
@CONTENT:I know there are a lot of posts on the subject but I cannot find one that helps me do what I want. I know that I will eventually be using Automapper but before I start playing with it, I want to learn how to do things manually. I want to create a ViewModel, populate it with values from my entities by way of a repository and send it to my View. As simple as this sounds, I am stuggling to get it done. I'm using MVC 3, EF 4.3, Database First. I have auto-generated my classes. I'm posting the relevant entities (abbreviated/renamed for this post) and classes, here is what I have so far: Aggregate Entity: Shipping Header using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace My.Models
{
public partial class ShippingHdr
{
    public ShippingHdr()
    {
        this.ShippingLI = new HashSet<ShippingLI>();
    }

    public int ID { get; set; }
    public int ShipToSiteID { get; set; }
    public Nullable<System.DateTime> DateShipped { get; set; }
    public Nullable<System.DateTime> EstDeliveryDate { get; set; }
    public string FromSitePOC { get; set; }
    public Nullable<int> ShipperID { get; set; }
    public string TrackingNo { get; set; }
    public string Comments { get; set;}
    public virtual Shippers Shippers { get; set; }
    public virtual ICollection<ShippingLI> ShippingLI { get; set; }
}

}
 Here is my ViewModel using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Web;

namespace My.Models.ViewModels
{

public class ShippingHeaderSummaryVM
{
    public int ID { get; set; }
    public string Site { get; set; }
    public Nullable<System.DateTime> DateShipped { get; set; }
    public Nullable<System.DateTime> EstDeliveryDate { get; set; }
    public string TrackingNo { get; set; }
    public string HeaderComments { get; set; }
    public string Shipper { get; set; }
    public int NumOrders { get; set; }
    public string Site { get; set; }


}
 } Here is a query I got to return the items I want to use to populate my Viewmodel with. I believe the best place for this is in a Repository. I verified it returns the data I want using LinqPad (hence the missing reference to my dbContxt). I just don't know how to get the values from the query to the ViewModel: var shipments = from h in c.ShippingHdrs
                        where (h.ShippingLI.Count > 1)
                        join
                        e in c.vHr_Employees on h.CreatedBy equals e.ID
                        join
                        s in c.Shippers on h.ShipperID equals s.ShipperID
                        join
                        r in vAaiomsSites on h.ShipToSiteID equals r.SiteID

                        select new
                        {
                            h.ID,
                            r.Site,
                            h.EstDeliveryDate,
                            h.DateShipped,
                            h.TrackingNumber,
                            h.HeaderComments,
                            e.LastName,
                            h.ShippingLI.Count,
                            s.Shipper
                                                        };
 So what I want to do, again without using Automapper, is to populate the ViewModel with all of the rows from the ShippingHdr entity and pass it to my view. Here are the filelds that need to be mapped: ShippingHeaderSummaryVM mapped from shipments ID = h.ID
Site = r.Site
DateShipped = h.DateShipped
EstDeliveryDate = h.EstDeliveryDate
TrackingNo = h.TrackingNumber
FromSitePOC = e.LastName
NumOrders = h.ShippingLI.Count
Shipper = s.Shipper
HeaderComments = h.HeaderComments
 I am stuck here. How do I populate the ViewModel from the query? How then do I then call that action from my controller? I hope I have given enough information, any help would be appreciated.

@TITLE:Can I call session in template/view on Play Framework
@CONTENT:I'm new at using Play Framework 2.0 (I am using Scala) and have a question about sessions. I come from a Ruby on Rails background, so I tend to think of everything that I learn in Play Framework with respect to Ruby on Rails. With that in mind, is there any way for me to call stuff stored in the Session while I am in the view? If I have "hello" -> "world" stored in the Session, I want to be able to do something like @session.get("hello") and be able to use "world" in the view. Is this possible? The other option I see is to store the value in a variable in the controller, and pass that along to the view by doing something like OK( var ), but that way seems kind of clunky especially if I start using more variables. Thanks!

I have audited the file using online tools, and it seems I can use some sort of automated refactoring without risking too much. I have also tried a few tools to check if selectors are actually used, the problem is that this web app is written completely in javascript, so the whole thing is dynamic and regular tools are practically unusable (no proper links to follow, no site map etc.) Do you guys have any recommendations on how to proceed, where to start, and if it is even worth my time?

@LINK:/questions/10697975/generate-truly-globally-unique-id-across-many-clients-and-servers
@TITLE:Generate truly globally unique id across many clients and servers
@CONTENT:Summary Really globally unique IDs in flash and/or javascript clients. Can I do this with an RNG available in current browsers/flash or must I build a composite ID with server-side randomness? Details I need to generate globally unique identifiers for objects. I have multiple server-side "systems" written in java that need to be able to exchange ids; each of these systems also has a set of flex/javascript clients that actually generate the IDs for new objects. I need to guarantee global uniqueness across the set of unrelated systems; for instance I need to be able to merge/sync the databases of two independent systems. I must guarantee that there is never a collision between these ids and that I never need to change the id of an object once created. I need to be able to generate ids in flash and javascript clients without contacting the server for every id. A solution that relies on some server provided seed or system id is fine as long as the server isn't contacted too often. A solution that works completely disconnected is preferable. Similarly a solution that requires no upfront registration of systems is preferable to one that relies on a central authority (like the OUI in a MAC address). I know the obvious solution is "use a UUID generator," such as UIDUtil in flash. This function specifically disclaims global uniqueness. In general, I'm concerned about relying on a PRNG to guarantee global uniqueness. Proposed solutions Rely entirely on a secure random number generator in the client. Flash 11+ has flash.crypto.generateRandomBytes; Javascript has window.crypto but it's pretty new and not supported in IE. There are solutions like sjcl that use the mouse to add entropy. I understand that given a perfect RNG the possibility of collision for a 2122 random UID is meteorite tiny, but I'm worried that I won't actually get this degree of randomness in a javascript or flash client. I'm further concerned that the typical use case for even a cryptographic RNG is different from mine: for session keys, etc, collisions are acceptable as long as they are unpredictable by an attacker. In my case, collisions are completely unacceptable. Should I really rely on the raw output of a secure RNG for a unique ID? Generate a composite ID that includes system, session and object IDs. An obvious implementation would be to create a system UUID at server install time, keep a per-client-login session id (eg in a database), and then send the system and session ids to the client which would keep a per-session counter. The uid would be the triple: system ID, session ID, client counter. I could imagine directly concatenating these or hashing them with a cryptographic hash. I'm concerned that the hashing itself may potentially introduce collisions, particularly if the input to the hash is about the same size as the output. But the hash would obscure the system id and counters which could leak information. Instead of generating the system ID at install time, another solution would be to have a central registry that handed out unique system IDs, kind of like what DOI does. This requires more coordination however, but I guess is the only way to really guarantee global uniquness. Key questions Random or composite based? Include system ID? If system id: generate a random system ID or use a central registry? Include timestamp or some other nonce? To hash or not to hash?

The UIDeviceOrientation constantly changes from UIDeviceOrientationFaceDown to UIDeviceOrientationFaceUp and back. This makes the yaw value to skip back and forth +/-180 degrees based on small changes of the pitch. Is it possible to lock the device to one orientation that gives a stable yaw value, predict the change without glitches or compute the gyro yaw (or roll in this orientation) in other ways?

@CONTENT:I'm facing a problem with parsing a uri of taken photo to crop activity. In my application, users can take a photo or select one from gallery and then crop it and upload it. Everything sounds straightforward. When pick from Gallery, Gallery app return an uri for selected photo like this: content://media/external/images/media/20
 I start crop activity with this uri by following code, everything seems ok: Intent intent = new Intent("com.android.camera.action.CROP");
intent.setData(uri);
intent.putExtra("outputX", 96);
intent.putExtra("outputY", 96);

intent.putExtra("scale", true);
intent.putExtra("return-data", true);

 But when I take a photo, I can only know the photo's path like this: file:///mnt/sdcard/iBet88.us/IMAGE_20120517_151606.jpg
 and Crop Activity will not accept this uri. I tried another way with Content Provider: add newly captured photo to ContentProvider, and then get new uri in sheme "content://..." from following code: // TODO insert to Content Provider
ContentResolver cr = getContentResolver();
ContentValues contentValues = new ContentValues();
contentValues.put(MediaStore.Images.Media.DATA, avatarFilePathTmp.getPath());

@CONTENT:I'm using .NET framework (tried 3.5 & 4.0) to load a .TIFF file and save it as .PNG. I expect two subsequent calls to the Save() method (using the same TIFF file) to produce the same PNG file. The produced files are, however, 'sometimes' different. The C# code below shows the problem: Image sourceToConvert = Bitmap.FromFile("c:\\tmp\\F1.tif");
sourceToConvert.Save("c:\\tmp\\F1_gen.png", ImageFormat.Png);           

for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++)

}
 This will display 'Diff' at iteration 8, 32, 33, 73 114, 155, 196 on Windows 64, while it does not display any errors on 32 bit machines.

@TITLE:How to create editor for database view (with joins) in Windows Forms/WPF?
@CONTENT:What would be the simplest way to create a quick editor for some data in the database in WPF/WinForms, where the data is represented by a View in the SQL Server database? Say I have a table Person { id int, name nvarchar(max), GenderID int, CityID int}, where GenderID and CityID is a reference into tables Gender and City. In the editor, the Person would appear as textbox for name, combobox for gender (selecting names of the genders from Gender table) and the same for the city column. Is there something easy that I can do so some control/code would generate this? If I'd like to only select data, then WinForms DataGridView or WPF DataGrid can generate a column for each property, and show a row for each object in a collection. - Is there some kind of similar magic control, that could do this for a database view, if the relations are defined by a foreign key? It seems to me that thousands of developers have faced this kind of problem - to quickly create a GUI for editing database rows with relationships to other tables, so there should be some kind of universally accepted solution. Or is everyone doing this in the code? Or, if there is a tool for this in other language, not C#, not Windows Forms - like dBase.

@LINK:/questions/10488388/c-and-erlang-erlang-port-example
@TITLE:C and Erlang: Erlang Port example
@CONTENT:Disclaimer: The author of the question has an average knowledge of Erlang and a basic knowledge of C. I am reading the Interoperability Tutorial User Guide now. I have successfully compiled the complex.c example and it works with the Erlang Port without any problems. However, I would like to understand how the actual C code works. I understand it in general: in the example it reads 2 bytes from the standard input and checks the first byte. Depending on the first byte it calls either foo or bar function. This is the limit of my understanding of it right now. So, if we take both erl_comm.c: /* erl_comm.c */

typedef unsigned char byte;

read_cmd(byte *buf)
{
  int len;

  if (read_exact(buf, 2) != 2)
    return(-1);
  len = (buf[0] << 8) | buf[1];
  return read_exact(buf, len);
}

write_cmd(byte *buf, int len)
{
  byte li;

  li = (len >> 8) & 0xff;
  write_exact(&li, 1);

  li = len & 0xff;
  write_exact(&li, 1);

  return write_exact(buf, len);
}

read_exact(byte *buf, int len)
{
  int i, got=0;

  do {
    if ((i = read(0, buf+got, len-got)) <= 0)
      return(i);
    got += i;
  } while (got<len);

  return(len);
}

write_exact(byte *buf, int len)
{
  int i, wrote = 0;

  do {
    if ((i = write(1, buf+wrote, len-wrote)) <= 0)
      return (i);
    wrote += i;
  } while (wrote<len);

  return (len);
}
 and port.c: /* port.c */

typedef unsigned char byte;

int main() {
  int fn, arg, res;
  byte buf[100];

  while (read_cmd(buf) > 0) {
    fn = buf[0];
    arg = buf[1];

    if (fn == 1) {
      res = foo(arg);
    } else if (fn == 2) {
      res = bar(arg);
    }

    buf[0] = res;
    write_cmd(buf, 1);
  }
}
 What does each function actually do there? What purpose do li, len, i, wrote, got variables actually serve? Some more small questions: Why do not the functions have any return types, even voids? When Erlang port sends data to C, the first byte determines a function to be called. If the byte holds the decimal 1, then foo() is called, if the byte holds the decimal 2, then bar() is called. If not changed anyhow this protocol can be used to call up to 255 different C functions with only 1 parameter each. Is that right? "Adding the length indicator will be done automatically by the Erlang port, but must be done explicitly in the external C program". What does that mean? On which line of code is it done? From the Tutorial: "By default, the C program should read from standard input (file descriptor 0) and write to standard output (file descriptor 1)." Then: "Note that stdin and stdout are for buffered input/output and should not be used for the communication with Erlang!" What is the catch here? why buf is initialized to [100]?
@CODE:complex.c foo bar erl_comm.c /* erl_comm.c */

typedef unsigned char byte;

read_cmd(byte *buf)
{
  int len;

  if (read_exact(buf, 2) != 2)
    return(-1);
  len = (buf[0] << 8) | buf[1];
  return read_exact(buf, len);
}

{
  byte li;

  li = (len >> 8) & 0xff;
  write_exact(&li, 1);

  li = len & 0xff;

  return write_exact(buf, len);
}

@LINK:/questions/10451535/how-to-exit-a-threads-message-loop
@TITLE:How to exit a thread's message loop?
@CONTENT:A background-thread can be configured to receive window messages. You would post messages to the thread using PostThreadMessage. What's the correct way to exit that message loop? Background Before you can post messages to a background thread, the thread needs to ensure that a message queue is created by calling PeekMessage: procedure ThreadProcedure;
var
   msg: TMsg;
begin
   //Call PeekMessage to force the system to create the message queue.
   PeekMessage(msg, NULL, WM_USER, WM_USER, PM_NOREMOVE);
end;
 Now the outside world is able to post messages to our thread: PostThreadMessage(nThreadID, WM_ReadyATractorBeam, 0, 0);
 and our thread sits in a GetMessage loop: procedure ThreadProcedure;
var
   msg: TMsg;
begin
   //Call PeekMessage to force the system to create the message queue.
   PeekMessage(msg, NULL, WM_USER, WM_USER, PM_NOREMOVE);

   //Start our message pumping loop. 
   //GetMessage will return false when it receives a WM_QUIT

   //   GetMessage can return -1 if there's an error
   //   Delphi LongBool interprets non-zero as true.
   //   If GetMessage *does* fail, then msg will not be valid. 
   //   We want some way to handle that.
   //Invalid:
   //while (GetMessage(msg, 0, 0, 0)) do
   //Better:
   while LongInt(GetMessage(msg, 0, 0, 0)) > 0 do
   begin
      case msg.message of
      WM_ReadyATractorBeam: ReadyTractorBeam;

      // No point in calling Translate/Dispatch if there's no window associated.
      // Dispatch will just throw the message away
//    else
//       TranslateMessage(Msg);
//       DispatchMessage(Msg);
//    end;
   end;
end;
 My question is what's the correct way to have GetMessage receive a WM_QUIT message and return false. We've already learned that the incorrect way to post a WM_QUIT message is to call: PostThreadMessage(nThreadId, WM_QUIT, 0, 0);
 There is even examples out there where people employ this approach. From MSDN: Do not post the WM_QUIT message using the PostMessage function; use PostQuitMessage. The correct way is for "someone" to call PostQuitMessage. PostQuitMessage is a special function, that sets the special flag associated with a message queue so that GetMessage will synthesize a WM_QUIT message when the time is right. If this were a message loop associated with a "window", then the standard design pattern is when the window is being destroyed, and a WM_DESTROY message is received, we catch it and call PostQuitMessage: procedure ThreadProcedure;
var
   msg: TMsg;
begin
   //Call PeekMessage to force the system to create the message queue.
   PeekMessage(msg, NULL, WM_USER, WM_USER, PM_NOREMOVE);

   //Start our message pumping loop. 
   //GetMessage will return false when it receives a WM_QUIT
   while Longint(GetMessage(msg, 0, 0, 0)) > 0 do
   begin
      case msg.message of
      WM_ReadyATractorBeam: ReadyTractorBeam;
      WM_DESTROY: PostQuitMessage(0);
      end;
   end;
end;
 Problem is that WM_DESTROY is sent by the Window Manager. It is sent when someone calls DestroyWindow. It is wrong to just post WM_DESTROY. Now i could synthesize some artifical WM_PleaseEndYourself message: PostThreadMessage(nThreadID, WM_PleaseEndYourself, 0, 0);
 and then handle it in my thread's message loop: procedure ThreadProcedure;
var
   msg: TMsg;
begin
   //Call PeekMessage to force the system to create the message queue.
   PeekMessage(msg, NULL, WM_USER, WM_USER, PM_NOREMOVE);

   //Start our message pumping loop. 
   //GetMessage will return false when it receives a WM_QUIT
   while Longint(GetMessage(msg, 0, 0, 0)) > 0 do
   begin
      case msg.message of

      end;

end;
 But is there a canonical way to exit a thread's message loop? But don't do this It turns out that it's better for everyone that you don't use a windowless message queue. A lot of things can be unintentionally, and subtly, broken if you don't have a window for messages to be dispatched to. Instead allocate hidden window (e.g. using Delphi's thread-unsafe AllocateHwnd) and post messages to it using plain old PostMessage: procedure TMyThread.Execute;
var
   msg: TMsg;
begin
   Fhwnd := AllocateHwnd(WindowProc);
   if Fhwnd = 0 then Exit;
   try
      while Longint(GetMessage(msg, 0, 0, 0)) > 0 do
      begin
         TranslateMessage(msg);
         DispatchMessage(msg);
      end;
   finally
      DeallocateHwnd(Fhwnd);
      Fhwnd := 0;
   end;
end;
 Where we can have a plain old window procedure to handle the messages: WM_TerminateYourself = WM_APP + 1;

procedure TMyThread.WindowProc(var msg: TMessage);
begin
   case msg.Msg of
   WM_ReadyATractorBeam: ReadyTractorBeam;
   WM_TerminateYourself: PostQuitMessage(0);
   else
      msg.Result := DefWindowProc(Fhwnd, msg.msg, msg.wParam, msg.lParam);
   end;
end;    
 and when you want the thread to finish, you tell it: procedure TMyThread.Terminate;
begin
   PostMessage(Fhwnd, WM_TerminateYourself, 0, 0);
end;
@CODE:PostThreadMessage PeekMessage procedure ThreadProcedure;
var
   msg: TMsg;
begin
   //Call PeekMessage to force the system to create the message queue.
   PeekMessage(msg, NULL, WM_USER, WM_USER, PM_NOREMOVE);
end; PostThreadMessage(nThreadID, WM_ReadyATractorBeam, 0, 0); GetMessage procedure ThreadProcedure;

   PeekMessage(msg, NULL, WM_USER, WM_USER, PM_NOREMOVE);

   //Start our message pumping loop. 
   //GetMessage will return false when it receives a WM_QUIT

   //   GetMessage can return -1 if there's an error
   //   Delphi LongBool interprets non-zero as true.
   //   If GetMessage *does* fail, then msg will not be valid. 
   //   We want some way to handle that.
   //Invalid:
   //while (GetMessage(msg, 0, 0, 0)) do

@TITLE:php var_dump($object) or print_r($object) to a log file
@CONTENT:This question is generic, and I would simply like to know how to dump objects to log files. In order to clarify things, i am elaborating through an example. I have been successfully using magento observers to call methods when certain events happen. As an example, I am observing for when a shipment is saved via : <sales_order_shipment_save_after>
 and i'm successfully calling a method. I would like to grab the shipment and simply dump the object to a log file. eg. public function newShipment(Varien_Event_Observer $observer)
{
    $shipment = $observer->getEvent()->getShipment();
    $shipId = $shipment->getId();
    Mage::log("shipment ({$shipId}) created/saved", null, 'shipments.log');
    //trying to dump $shipment data into the log file
    Mage::log("({var_dump($shipment)}) ------", null, 'shipments.log');
    Mage::log("----------------------------", null, 'shipments.log');
}
 The shipment id is printed into the log file just fine, but obviously it does not dump the object the way i want it to as the code I have written is wrong. Can anyone tell me how I could dump an object to a log file and perhaps give me some advice on logging in general? thanks very much.
@CODE:<sales_order_shipment_save_after> public function newShipment(Varien_Event_Observer $observer)

    $shipment = $observer->getEvent()->getShipment();
    $shipId = $shipment->getId();

@TITLE:Storing arbitrary metadata with a plain-text file
@CONTENT:I am writing a text-editor and I would need to store a few pieces of information (generally just a few strings; the storage needn't be particularly durable) with each file the app saves (without that being part of the text-file as other apps might read it and the info is only specific to my app). How would I go about this? More info: I have a NSDocument set up and I would like to simply store a NSString instance variable as a per file meta-datum. Based on the answers below I've come up with this, which is currently buggy and causes the program to crash on startup: #import <sys/xattr.h>
@interface MyDocument : NSDocument {
  NSString *metadatum;
}

@implementation MyDocument 

- (BOOL)writeToURL:(NSURL *)url ofType:(NSString *)type error:(NSError **)err
{
  BOOL output = [super writeToURL:url ofType:type error:err];
  if(!setxattr([[url path] cStringUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding],

               [metadatum cStringUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding], 
               sizeof(char) * [styleName length], 0, 0)) 
  {
      NSLog(@"Write failure");
  }
  return output;
}

  char *output;
  ssize_t bytes = getxattr([[url path] cStringUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding],
                           "eu.gampleman.xattrs.style", &output, 1024, 0, 0);
  if (bytes > 0) {
    metadatum = [[NSString alloc] initWithBytes:output length:bytes 
          encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding]; // <- crashes here with "EXC_BAD_ACCESS"
  }
  return [super readFromURL:url ofType:type error: err];
}

// ...
// fairly standard -dataOfType:error: and

@CONTENT:Say I have the following 2 json objects: JSON A:

JSON B:
{
"Field A":"1",

 Sample Function: function (jsonstringA, jsonstringB) Example (If JSON A and JSON B used as parameters): Returns a new JSON object containing: {
"Field C":"3", // because function sees jsonstringB had no "Field C"
"Field D": "Different" // sees jsonstringB had a different value for "Field D"
}
 Note that it is using jsonstringA as the base of the comparison, so the function returns only the fields missing and values of jsonStringB. That is why "Field E" and its value is not returned. What is the best way if possible to come up with a function that returns a json object containing values that have changed? WHAT I HAVE TRIED: I have tried doing a comparison by manually specifying the fields that I am trying to check for, but I would like to have something that requires me to not hardcode the "Fields" as it is very inefficient and everytime I add a new field to JSON B, I have to hardcode in the field I am looking for... that is why I am looking for something less of a pain.

@TITLE:Google apps script oauth connect doesn't work with trello
@CONTENT:I've been trying to use oAuth in Google apps script to access trello data, but it seems that the OAuthService API makes some assumptions about the oAuth service and that trello doesn't work that way. The following code works. It get's access to twitter (this is from google's oauth tutorial): function authorizeToTwitter() {
  var oauthConfig = UrlFetchApp.addOAuthService("twitter");
  oauthConfig.setAccessTokenUrl("https://api.twitter.com/oauth/access_token");
  oauthConfig.setRequestTokenUrl("https://api.twitter.com/oauth/request_token");
  oauthConfig.setAuthorizationUrl("https://api.twitter.com/oauth/authorize");
  oauthConfig.setConsumerKey(<CONSUMER KEY>);
  oauthConfig.setConsumerSecret(<CONSUMER SECRET>);
  var requestData = {
    "method": "GET",
    "oAuthServiceName": "twitter",
    "oAuthUseToken": "always"
  };
  var result = UrlFetchApp.fetch("https://api.twitter.com/1/statuses/mentions.json", requestData);
}
 The following code will get me to the trello "press ok to get back" page, but trello doesn't know how to redirect back, so I get to a page that asks me to manually copy paste a token (but google doesn't provide me with a method of inserting that token) function authorizeToTrello() {
  var oauthConfig = UrlFetchApp.addOAuthService("trello");
  oauthConfig.setAccessTokenUrl("https://trello.com/1/OAuthGetAccessToken");
  oauthConfig.setRequestTokenUrl("https://trello.com/1/OAuthGetRequestToken");
  oauthConfig.setAuthorizationUrl("https://trello.com/1/OAuthAuthorizeToken");

  oauthConfig.setConsumerSecret(<CONSUMER SECRET>);

  };
  var result = UrlFetchApp.fetch(
      "https://api.trello.com/1/members/me/boards",
      requestData);
}
 I tried to fix that by manually adding the redirect callback that I provide to twitter in the the authorization url oauthConfig.setAuthorizationUrl("https://trello.com/1/OAuthAuthorizeToken?return_url=https://docs.google.com/macros"); //this is what the tutorial says I should provide to twitter
 or oauthConfig.setAuthorizationUrl("https://trello.com/1/OAuthAuthorizeToken?return_url=https://docs.google.com/macros/externaloauthcallback"); //this is what twitter actually calls when performing the oauth dance
 But both don't work. Am I doing something wrong? Am I missing some configuration parameters that I should be providing?

 What makes X unhashable? Note that I must have identical lists (in terms of regular equality) to be hashed to the same value; otherwise, I will violate this requirement on hash functions: The only required property is that objects which compare equal have the same hash value The docs do warn that a hashable object shouldn't be modified during its lifetime, and of course I don't modify instances of X after creation. Of course, the interpreter won't check that anyway.

@TITLE:How do I prevent Entity Framework from loading a FileStream column into a byte array?
@CONTENT:I am developing a file storage application, and we have incorporated the FileStream type in our database. The system is expected to support large files. One portion of the application allows for bulk uploads of multiple documents. These documents then have to be linked to other entities within the system. One page is designed to show unlinked documents, to allow a user to link the documents one at a time to entities. After doing some load testing of the upload process, we found that the memory footprint of the ASP.NET worker process spiked to over a GB when loading this Unlinked Documents page. After investigation, it seems that Entity Framework is loading the entire document row entity (including the FileStream, converted to a byte array) for hundreds of unlinked documents. In my repository class, I don't save this byte array when converting to a Model, but by then it's too late. EF has spent the time and the memory to allocate the byte array into the Repository class representation. Is there a way that I can tell EF not to load this byte array unless I explicitly ask for it?

@CONTENT:Is it possible in CSS to override a property if that property doesn't have a default value? For example, say your primary stylesheet defines a border for a particular element: #element {
  border: 1px solid #000;
}
 If you wanted to disable the border from a secondary stylesheet, you could do this: #element {
  border: none;
}
 Assuming the secondary stylesheet was loaded after the primary one, the border: none rule would take precedence and remove the border. But what if you were trying to override a property that doesn't have a default or null value? #element {
  position: absolute;
  left: 0;
}
 Now say, in your secondary stylesheet, you wanted to do this: #element {
  right: 0;
  top: 0;
}
 And you didn't want any value for left. There's no such thing as left: none;, so...how do you "undeclare" the left property assigned in the primary stylesheet?

  border: 1px solid #000;

http://foo/app2 --> app.war
http://foo/app3 --> app.war

http://foo/appN --> app.war
 Some obvious ways of achieving this: In Tomcat, create one context.xml file for each app ( named appN.xml ), all pointing to the same WAR. Other containers have similar methods Problem with this approach: It will explode the WAR N times, taking up a lot of disk space Use symbolic links to create webapp/{app1,app2,appN} folders pointing to an exploded version of app.war. This prevents the disk space explosion, but the JVM is still loading many duplicate JARs to memory Use some shared lib folder to contain most jars ( and a combination of the previous two options ). I wonder if there is a better method to do this. Ideally, creating a new instance should not take up ANY more disk space ( other than marginal configuration files ) and only take up memory related to thread execution stacks and other runtime allocations. Any ideas?

@TITLE:Constrained Linear Regression in Python
@CONTENT:I have a classic linear regression problem of the form: y = X b where y is a response vector X is a matrix of input variables and b is the vector of fit parameters I am searching for. Python provides b = numpy.linalg.lstsq( X , y ) for solving problems of this form. However, when I use this I tend to get either extremely large or extremely small values for the components of b. I'd like to perform the same fit, but constrain the values of b between 0 and 255. It looks like scipy.optimize.fmin_slsqp() is an option, but I found it extremely slow for the size of problem I'm interested in (X is something like 3375 by 1500 and hopefully even larger). Are there any other Python options for performing constrained least squares fits? Or are there python routines for performing Lasso Regression or Ridge Regression or some other regression method which penalizes large b coefficient values?

 what I need is to execute some code after BeginSomething when it is really complete (thus after OnBeginSomethingCompleted is triggered). It is very inconvinient to handle the response in the event.

@TITLE:Entity Framework Code First Find vs SingleOrDefault (Eager Loading)
@CONTENT:I'm using Entity Framework 4.2 (Code First) to access my database. I was under the assumption that if I queried an entity using SingleOrDefault it would only query the database if the entity was not already being tracked, but this does not appear to be the case. The Find method on the other hand, does appear to be doing this. The problem with Find is that it doesn't appear to allow me to load related data. Is there a way to use the Find method but also eagerly load data ? As an example, I want to load a book and all of its reviews: // Load book from the database
Book book = context.Books.Find(1); 
context.Entry<Book>(book).Collection<Review>.Load(); // Book.Reviews is now populated

// Load book from the change tracker
// This will include all Reviews as well
Book book2 = context.Books.Find(1);
 With SingleOrDefault I can load the Reviews when I get the book using Include: // Load book + reviews from the database
Book book = Book.Include("Reviews").SingleOrDefault(b => b.Id == 1);

// Doing the same thing again requeries the database
Book book2 = Book.Include("Reviews").SingleOrDefault(b => b.Id == 1);
 Is there a way to get the behavior of Find with the eager loading of SingleOrDefault ?
@CODE:SingleOrDefault Find Find Find // Load book from the database
Book book = context.Books.Find(1); 
context.Entry<Book>(book).Collection<Review>.Load(); // Book.Reviews is now populated

// Load book from the change tracker
// This will include all Reviews as well
Book book2 = context.Books.Find(1); SingleOrDefault // Load book + reviews from the database
Book book = Book.Include("Reviews").SingleOrDefault(b => b.Id == 1);

// Doing the same thing again requeries the database
Book book2 = Book.Include("Reviews").SingleOrDefault(b => b.Id == 1); Find SingleOrDefault

 Some obvious ways of achieving this: In Tomcat, create one context.xml file for each app ( named appN.xml ), all pointing to the same WAR. Other containers have similar methods Problem with this approach: It will explode the WAR N times, taking up a lot of disk space Use symbolic links to create webapp/{app1,app2,appN} folders pointing to an exploded version of app.war. This prevents the disk space explosion, but the JVM is still loading many duplicate JARs to memory Use some shared lib folder to contain most jars ( and a combination of the previous two options ). I wonder if there is a better method to do this. Ideally, creating a new instance should not take up ANY more disk space ( other than marginal configuration files ) and only take up memory related to thread execution stacks and other runtime allocations.

@TITLE:Exposing variables from PhantomJS call to injectJS
@CONTENT:I've followed examples for injecting jQuery from the getting started page and that works just fine. I have a local copy of jQuery in the same directory, and do something like... if(page.injectJs('jquery.min.js')) {
  page.evaluate(function(){
    //Use jQuery or $ 
  }
}
 When I try to inject my own script(s), none of the functions are available to me. Say I have a script called myScript.js that just has function doSomething() {
  // doing something...
}
 I cannot then use doSomething like... if(page.injectJs('myScript.js')) {
  console.log('myScript injected... I think');
  page.evaluate(function() {
    doSomething();
  });
} else { 
  console.log('Failed to inject myScript'); 
}
 I've tried window.doSomething = function() {};
 and document.doSomething = function() {};
 as well with no luck, as well as trying to call them with window.doSomething() or document.doSomething() in the subsequent page.evaluate().
@CODE:if(page.injectJs('jquery.min.js')) {
  page.evaluate(function(){
    //Use jQuery or $ 
  }
} function doSomething() {
  // doing something...
} if(page.injectJs('myScript.js')) {
  console.log('myScript injected... I think');
  page.evaluate(function() {
    doSomething();
  });
} else {

@TITLE:Constrained Linear Regression in Python
@CONTENT:I have a classic linear regression problem of the form: y = X b where y is a response vector X is a matrix of input variables and b is the vector of fit parameters I am searching for. Python provides b = numpy.linalg.lstsq( X , y ) for solving problems of this form. However, when I use this I tend to get either extremely large or extremely small values for the components of b. I'd like to perform the same fit, but constrain the values of b between 0 and 255. It looks like scipy.optimize.fmin_slsqp() is an option, but I found it extremely slow for the size of problem I'm interested in (X is something like 3375 by 1500 and hopefully even larger). Are there any other Python options for performing constrained least squares fits? Or are there python routines for performing Lasso Regression or Ridge Regression or some other regression method which penalizes large b coefficient values?

I have a third party library who's methods are all asynchronos, to get result of almoust any method you must listen to an event, which will bring some context with it. basically it looks like: service.BeginSomething(...);
service.OnBeginSomethingCompleted += ;
 what I need is to execute some code after BeginSomething when it is really complete (thus after OnBeginSomethingCompleted is triggered). It is very inconvinient to handle the response in the event. The only way I could think of is running a Thread.Sleep loop and wait till some field on the form is updated, but it doesn't look like very elegant sollution. I'm using .net 4.0.

 It does start winzip, but only with user rights. Is there something I am doing wrong or is it even possible to start a process with higher rights? thank you!

The actual problem is, our company uses 2 versions of a program. But before you start any of the versions you need to import a dll file with regsvr32 (with admin rights). Now I would like to write a program that let the user select the version, import the dll and starts the correct application.

@TITLE:Entity Framework Code First Find vs SingleOrDefault (Eager Loading)
@CONTENT:I'm using Entity Framework 4.2 (Code First) to access my database. I was under the assumption that if I queried an entity using SingleOrDefault it would only query the database if the entity was not already being tracked, but this does not appear to be the case. The Find method on the other hand, does appear to be doing this. The problem with Find is that it doesn't appear to allow me to load related data. Is there a way to use the Find method but also eagerly load data ? As an example, I want to load a book and all of its reviews: // Load book from the database
Book book = context.Books.Find(1); 
context.Entry<Book>(book).Collection<Review>.Load(); // Book.Reviews is now populated

// Load book from the change tracker
// This will include all Reviews as well
Book book2 = context.Books.Find(1);
 With SingleOrDefault I can load the Reviews when I get the book using Include: // Load book + reviews from the database
Book book = Book.Include("Reviews").SingleOrDefault(b => b.Id == 1);

// Doing the same thing again requeries the database
Book book2 = Book.Include("Reviews").SingleOrDefault(b => b.Id == 1);
 Is there a way to get the behavior of Find with the eager loading of SingleOrDefault ?
@CODE:SingleOrDefault Find Find Find // Load book from the database
Book book = context.Books.Find(1); 
context.Entry<Book>(book).Collection<Review>.Load(); // Book.Reviews is now populated

// Load book from the change tracker
// This will include all Reviews as well
Book book2 = context.Books.Find(1); SingleOrDefault // Load book + reviews from the database
Book book = Book.Include("Reviews").SingleOrDefault(b => b.Id == 1);

// Doing the same thing again requeries the database
Book book2 = Book.Include("Reviews").SingleOrDefault(b => b.Id == 1); Find SingleOrDefault

 To solve it, the standard solution is to make C1 and C2 use virtual inheritance to inherit from B. My problem is that B and C1 are from an SDK that I cannot modify. Example below where I cannot make SubClassB inherit virtually from Base. Classes: PureVirtualBase, Base and SubClassB are from the SDK I use. I cannot modify them.

 If I comment the call to f_PurevirtualBase it compiles but I have a warning that virtual base 'Base' inaccessible in 'Leaf' due to ambiguity If I uncomment this call: I get this error : request for member 'f_PureVirtualBase' is ambiguous If I prefix this call by the class name (myleaf.SubClassA::f_PureVirtualBase() then it works, but something is obviously wrong as there are 2 Base contained in the Leaf Object). Any hint? More info to answer comments My target architecture is slightly more complex that the sample I provided in the original question:  PureVirtualBase(SDK)

 LeafOne : inherits from SubClassA and SubClassB(SDK) LeafTwo : inherits from SubClassA and SubClassC(SDK) LeafThree : inherits from SubClassA and SubClassD(SDK) SubClassA is my own private code. It provides custom functions. It should be able to be treated like a Base instance by SDK methods. This class won't be instantiated but it is here to be able to handle LeafOne, LeafTwo and LeafThree in the same when performing some treatment.

@TITLE:using JSON keys as python attributes in nested JSON
@CONTENT:I'm working with nested JSON-like data structures in python 2.7 that I exchange with some foreign perl code. I just want to 'work with' these nested structures of lists and dictionaries in amore pythonic way. So if I have a structure like this... a = {
    'x': 4,
    'y': [2, 3, { 'a': 55, 'b': 66 }],
}
 ...I want to be able to deal with it in a python script as if it was nested python classes/Structs, like this: >>> aa = j2p(a)  # <<- this is what I'm after.
>>> print aa.x
4
>>> aa.z = 99
>>> print a
{
    'x': 4,
    'y': [2, 3, { 'a': 55, 'b': 66 }],

>>> print a
{
    'x': 4,
    'y': [2, 3, { 'a': 55, 'b': 999 }],

 Thus aa is a proxy into the original structure. This is what I came up with so far, inspired by the excellent What is a metaclass in Python? question. def j2p(x):
    """j2p creates a pythonic interface to nested arrays and

@TITLE:UIWebView not freeing all live bytes using ARC
@CONTENT:I am currently building a navigation controller app in iOS 5.1 that uses ARC. I often need to display webpages and I have made a web viewer that is just a UIWebView with some custom content around the sides. When the user is finished looking at the page they hit the back button which should release all of the memory associated with the custom web viewer. My problem is that all of the memory does not appear to be released when the back button is hit. I have built a toy app (on github) that is just a couple of buttons each having a first responder that calls a different page. @implementation ViewController

   [self.navigationController pushViewController:customWebView animated:NO];
}
 The CustomWebView is just a UIWebView linked in IB to UIWebView Property @implementation CustomWebView

@synthesize webView, link;

- (id)initWithStringURL:(NSString *) stringURL
{
   if (self = [super init]) {
       link = stringURL;

   NSURLRequest *urlRequest = [NSURLRequest requestWithURL:url];
   [webView loadRequest:urlRequest];
}

- (void)viewDidUnload
{
   [super viewDidUnload];
}
 My problem is that I set the heap baseline to be the initial ViewController once everything is loaded. I then check the heap after loading a page then returning to the ViewController and get the following heapshots: Which shows that after each series of clicking on a button and returning to the ViewController the heap continues to grow even though the CustomWebView should all be released.

@TITLE:How to resolve 'file could only be replicated to 0 nodes, instead of 1' in hadoop?
@CONTENT:I have a simple hadoop job that crawls websites and caches them to the HDFS. The mapper checks if a URL already exists in the HDFS and if so, uses it otherwise downloads the page and saves it to the HDFS.

@TITLE:Sharing heap memory with fork()
@CONTENT:I am working on implementing a database server in C that will handle requests from multiple clients. In order to do so I am using fork() to handle connections for individual clients. The server stores data in the heap which consists of a root pointer to hash tables of dynamically allocated records. The records are structs that have pointers to various data-types. I would like for the processes to be able to share this data so that when a client makes a change to the heap the changes will be visible for the other clients. I have learned that fork() uses COW (Copy On Write) and my understanding is that it will copy the heap (and stack) memory of the parent process when the child will try to modify the data in memory. I have found out that I can use the shm library to share memory. -Would it suffice to share the root pointer of the database or do I have to make all allocated memory as shared? -If a child allocates memory will the parent / other children be able to access it? -Also if a child allocates memory and is later killed will the allocated memory still stay on the heap? So for example would the code below be a valid way to share heap memory (in shared_string)? If a child were to use similar code (i.e. starting from //start ) would other children be able to read/write to it while the child is running and after it's dead? key_t key;

 I want to do something similar for OrderedDict and defaultdict. But of course, defaultdict has a different __init__ signature, so it requires extra work. What's the cleanest way to solve this problem? I use Python 3.3.

@CONTENT:I'm trying to verify a method call using Moq, but I can't quite get the syntax right. Currently I've go this as my verify: repository.Verify(x => x.ExecuteNonQuery("fav_AddFavorites", new
{
    fid = 123,
    inputStr = "000456"
}), Times.Once());
 The code compiles, but the test fails with the error: Expected invocation on the mock once, but was 0 times: 
x => x.ExecuteNonQuery("fav_AddFavorites", new <>f__AnonymousType0<Int32, String>(123, "000456"))
No setups configured.

Performed invocations:
IRepository.ExecuteNonQuery("fav_AddFavorites", { fid = 123, inputStr = 000456 })
 How can I verify the method call and match the method parameters for an anonymous type. UPDATE To answer the questions: I am trying to verify both that the method was called and that the parameters are correct. The signature of the method I'm trying to verify is: int ExecuteNonQuery(string query, object param = null);
 The setup code is simply: repository = new Mock<IRepository>();
 UPDATE 2 It looks like this is a problem with Moq and how it handles anonymous types in .Net. The code posted by Paul Matovich runs fine, however, once the code and the test are in difference assemblies the test fails.
@CODE:repository.Verify(x => x.ExecuteNonQuery("fav_AddFavorites", new

@CONTENT:I set my first steps upon the noble path of using unit tests to develop my application, but it proves to be a steep and rough one. I'm developing an application in Qt, so thought to reach for their QTestLib framework. Now, I understand how to make unit tests, but I can't seem to figure out how to incorporate unit testing into a project. Say I have a console application which just has a main.cpp and a cpp and h file for a class I want to develop, say MyClass. I guess the right thing to do would be to create a corresponding test class MyClassTest with its h and cpp files. But should I put it into the same project? Or rather create a separate project just for unit tests that will have access to files in "main" project (not sure how would I do that yet)? And if both main application and the test are in the same project, how do I run tests without running the application or the other way round? I tried incorporating files from Qt's Tutorial 1 on unit testing into a console project, but the problem with it is that they use a macro QTEST_MAIN(TestQString) which expands into a main(...) function. This causes conflicts with the main(...) in the main.cpp. Well, I can rename either one, but the problem still stands - how do I then run either the tests or the application itself? If I override QTEST_MAIN macro (which is a bad idea anyway) I disable the tests. If I rename main(...) function in the main.cpp, then the actual application never gets executed. I guess there should be a way to make two separate executables for the project, one running unit tests, and another launching the application, but can't figure out how to go about it.

@CONTENT:I have an interesting situation on my hands, and I'm not quite sure how to go about troubleshooting it. I did a few searches for something similar to my situation, but nothing quite matches it. If the answer already exists somewhere here, I would appreciate anyone that could point me in the right direction. Ok, to the point. I'm writing a watchdog application for monitoring internet connectivity. Its designed to ping a set of domains at a set interval, and when any of them respond to the ping, the status timer is reset. If the status timer ever goes beyond a set threshold, several stages of corrective action are attempted to fix the problem. Simple enough right? Here's where it gets weird. I'm using ICMPsendecho to issue the ping request. On my development environment (win7) it seems to work fine, testing and everything went smoothly. However, in the environment where its being deployed it fails to receive a response. The deployment environment is a windows XP sp3 machine. Throughout the trouble shooting process I've noted several things, which may or may not be helpful in actually trying to solve this problem. windows ping.exe works just fine on the deployment environment for all of the domains i'm using to test connectivity status, its only my ICMPsendecho calls that seem to fail to generate responses. I've installed wireshark on deployment environment and I can see packets being issue successfully for the requests on both types of ping. the windows ping generates request packets with a length of 74 bytes, and my programs call generates packets with a length of 42 bytes. Windows response packets are similarly 74 bytes when they are received. Switching to the development environment for a minute, with wireshark installed. Windows ping generates a similiar circumstance as in the deployment environment with the packets. However, my application, when it generates requests the packets are 42 bytes in length(same as the deployment environment), but the responses it receives are 60 bytes in length. As i said, that information may or may not be useful, but I'm trying to find out why this application is failing to generate ICMP responses when windows ping seems to work fine on that machine. Another little tidbit that may help, the internet connection were monitoring uses AT&T's elevate 4g hotspots, the actual device is a sierra wireless MC8790 AirPrime card. Anyone have any ideas on why these pings are failing? thanks ahead of time for any useful information you might have and for taking the time to read my post. PS.

I use the following command to create the package: C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\MSBuild.exe Clients\PokerLeagueWebSite\PokerLeagueWebSite.csproj /T:Package /p:Configuration=Deployment
 My setup is as follows: local dev box using VS2010 + GIT
GITHUB for repo
Teamcity for CI server (different machine to dev box)
remote (same network) UAT server
 If I tick the "Include IIS Settings as configured in IIS" and "Include application pool settings used by this web project" and build the package on my dev box then publish from there it works great. Here is the command I use: C:\myproject\Packages\Deployment\PokerLeagueWebSite>PokerLeagueWebSite.deploy.cmd /Y /M:192.168.10.98:8172 /U:administrator /P:password
 This creates the virtual directory within my UAT server and all is well. The problem is when I commit to github and the CI server downloads and builds it. Naturally the virtual directory is not setup on the CI server so the build / package fails. What I want to do is use the packaging that msdeploy gives and be able to deploy the site and IIS remotely. I guess there are a few options: 1) Alter the MVC project file to hard code iis settings so that when ever / where ever you run the build package it creates the XML files with the correct settings so it can be deployed from any machine. I think this might be able to be done with the package.xml file in the root of the project, but I have no idea how I setup all the app pool and virtual directory settings. Feel like I am half way there but can't get the final push across the line. 2) Use powershell to alter created package XML files so that the extract IIS settings are added. The first option is preferable as it keeps all the information in one place and you don't need to remember to run an extra script before deployments. I believe I could figure the second option out by using VS to create the package and get the settings I need then script it, but I don't have a clue and spent a fair while reading about it without any success on how I would do option one. N.B. Reading some of the suggested questions before I posted this I can see some sort of possibilities: MSdeploy deploys an MVC 2 application with wrong virtual directory name This question talks about passing extra values on the msdeploy command, seems OK but not internal to the build process so to speak. Not sure of all the commands to use but can google that I am sure. This links seems to continue with the above: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee814764.aspx This page takes about the possibilities for option 2. http://learn.iis.net/page.aspx/1082/web-deploy-parameterization/ Think this is the way: using parameters.xml in teh root of the site for project stuff: http://vishaljoshi.blogspot.com/2010/07/web-deploy-parameterization-in-action.html EDIT I have continued reading and testing around this. Using the parameters.xml file in the root of the project I can get the parameters pretty much there I think. My issue seems to be the archive.xml file. This is pretty different and is what is causing the package to not install correctly if I do not have the use IIS settings check box ticked. I have started to read about [project].wpp.targets file that might help but pretty darn lost with that atm. EDIT 2 So what I think I need to do is get the [project].sourcemanifest.xml file to change a few of its settings. I believe this is what drives the archive.xml which is what is different now. I have the parameters.xml working correctly I think. When NOT using IIS the sourcemanifest.xml looks like this: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<sitemanifest>
  <IisApp path="C:\hoh_code\GIT\ai-poker-project\Clients\PokerLeagueWebSite\obj\Deployment\Package\PackageTmp" managedRuntimeVersion="v4.0" />
  <setAcl path="C:\hoh_code\GIT\ai-poker-project\Clients\PokerLeagueWebSite\obj\Deployment\Package\PackageTmp" setAclResourceType="Directory" />
  <setAcl path="C:\hoh_code\GIT\ai-poker-    project\Clients\PokerLeagueWebSite\obj\Deployment\Package\PackageTmp"     setAclUser="anonymousAuthenticationUser" setAclResourceType="Directory" />
</sitemanifest>
 But when I tick the use IIS settings it looks like this: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<sitemanifest>
  <appHostConfig path="Default Web Site/PokerLeague" />
  <contentPath path="C:\hoh_code\GIT\ai-poker-project\Clients\PokerLeagueWebSite\obj\Deployment\Package\PackageTmp" />
  <setAcl path="C:\hoh_code\GIT\ai-poker-project\Clients\PokerLeagueWebSite\obj\Deployment\Package\PackageTmp" setAclResourceType="Directory" />
  <setAcl path="C:\hoh_code\GIT\ai-poker-project\Clients\PokerLeagueWebSite\obj\Deployment\Package\PackageTmp" setAclUser="anonymousAuthenticationUser" setAclResourceType="Directory" />
</sitemanifest>
 Not sure how to change it, working on the [project].wpp.targets file, but fumbling in the dark atm. EDIT 3 OK so I thought I had it for a minute. in my [project].wpp.targets file I have: <Project xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">

  <PropertyGroup>

    <AddContentPathToSourceManifestDependsOn>
      SetCustomACLs;
    </AddContentPathToSourceManifestDependsOn >
  </PropertyGroup>

  <Target Name="SetCustomACLs">
    <ItemGroup>
      <MsDeploySourceManifest Include="appHostConfig">
        <Path>Default Web Site/PokerLeague</Path>
      </MsDeploySourceManifest>
    </ItemGroup>
    <ItemGroup>
        <MsDeploySourceManifest Include="contentPath">
            <Path>$(_MSDeployDirPath_FullPath)</Path>
        </MsDeploySourceManifest>
    </ItemGroup>
  </Target>
</Project>
 Which builds, creates a deployment package that I can then deploy from my dev box to the UAT server and it works. But when I run it on my CI server it will not build the deployment package, it drops out at the manifest stage with the error: One or more entries in the manifest 'sitemanifest' are not valid. 
 The manifest file looks like this: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<sitemanifest>
  <appHostConfig path="Default Web Site/PokerLeague" />
  <contentPath path="C:\TeamCity\buildAgent\work\71e78d4c543e0594\Clients\PokerLeagueWebSite\obj\Deployment\Package\PackageTmp" />
  <IisApp path="C:\TeamCity\buildAgent\work\71e78d4c543e0594\Clients\PokerLeagueWebSite\obj\Deployment\Package\PackageTmp" managedRuntimeVersion="v4.0" />

</sitemanifest>
 I am guessing it is because it still has the IisApp as well as the appHostConfig that I added. I am just guessing about this, and don't know how to remove that yet. EDIT 4 OK so I found the setting to remove the IISAPP from the manifest and parameters: <DeployAsIisApp>False</DeployAsIisApp>
 This goes into the wpp.targets file. This has now created a new issue that it will no longer deploy. I believe this is something to do with apphostconfig dealing with sites and iisapp dealing with virtual directories. EDIT 5 so I have been going through the differences left between ticking with IIS and my custom one. sourcemanifest.xml files are the same systeminfo.xml are the same setparameters.xml: The IIS web applicaiton name section is different. With IIS version is has the "Default Web Site/pokerleague" value but mine has "C:\websites\pokerleague". I think this is what is driving the error in the parameters.xml: the IIS web application has those same values and the tags attribute has physical rather than iisapp.

@TITLE:Updating images in resource section of an exe (in c#/C)
@CONTENT:I have few images embedded in my executable in resource section. I followed these steps to create my executable: Generated .resx file for all the images (.jpg) in a directory using some utility. The images are named image1.jpg, image2.jpg and so on. created .resources file from .resx file using: resgen myResource.resx Embedded the generated .resource file using /res flag as: csc file.cs /res:myResource.resources 4 I am accessing these images as: ResourceManager resources = new ResourceManager("myResource", Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly());

Image foo = (System.Drawing.Image)(resources.GetObject("image1"));
 This all is working fine as expected. Now I want to change embedded images to some new images. This is what I am currently doing: class foo
{
    [DllImport("kernel32.dll", SetLastError = true)]
        static extern IntPtr BeginUpdateResource(string pFileName, bool bDeleteExistingResources);

    [DllImport("kernel32.dll", SetLastError = true)]

    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        IntPtr handle = BeginUpdateResource(args[0], false);

        if (handle.ToInt32() == 0)
            throw new Exception("File Not Found: " + fileName + " last err: " + Marshal.GetLastWin32Error());

        byte[] imgData = File.ReadAllBytes("SetupImage1.jpg");
        int fileSize = imgData.Length;

        Console.WriteLine("Updaing resources");
        if (UpdateResource(handle, "Image", "image1", "image1", imgData, (uint)fileSize))
        {
            EndUpdateResource(handle, false);

        {
            Console.WriteLine("Failed to update resource. err: {0}", Marshal.GetLastWin32Error());
        }
    }
}
 The above code is adding a new resource for the specified image (inside IMAGE title with some random number, as seen in Resource hacker), but I want to modify the existing resource data for image1. I am sure that I am calling UpdateResource with some invalid arguments. Could any one help pointing that out? I am using .NET version 2 Thank you, Vikram

@CONTENT:I have a set of OSGi bundles being built using Maven and I was wondering if there is a Maven plugin available that allows me to do the following: Specify the set of bundles to include in a distribution and/or specify a single bundle and have the dependencies resolved. Build a complete distribution of the framework. What I mean is a single zip file containing all the bundles needed, plus the correct directory structure for felix so that the user can simply unzip the file and type "java -jar bin/felix.jar". I did some Googling and I didn't find anything very promising aside from appassembler. Have any of you ever come up with a good solution? Update Here's an illustration of what I'm trying to accomplish. example-parent\
               bundle-one
               bundle-two
               bundle-three
               assembly-one
               assembly-two
 Where assembly-one would include bundle-one and bundle-two and assembly-two would include bundle-two and bundle-three or any combination thereof. Then when you build your project, you would get two zip files, one for assembly-one and one for assembly-two that would contain the appropriate bundles in a self-contained felix install. For example: assembly-one.zip\
                 bin\felix.jar

Will both certificates work at the same time? Just concerned about the timing. For our app, we host a push server and so do a few of our customers. I want to make sure creating a new certificate and updating our push server with the new certificate doesn't mess up our customers' push servers that will, for a time, still have the old certificate installed.

@LINK:/questions/9244584/setting-up-a-repository-pattern-in-mvc
@TITLE:Setting up a repository pattern in MVC
@CONTENT:I'm trying to figure out how the Repository pattern works and how it can be implemented in a custom MVC pattern. As far as i understand it, the Repository is a layer which simply returns data from an entity class or saves the entity class to a persistent layer. Now i currently see it like this: A request comes in into my controller to create a user. Just a username and password. My controller will do something like this: function CreateAction ( )
{
    $userRepo = new userRepository ( );
    $user = new userEntity ( );

    $user->setUsername('user');
    $user->setPassword('123456');

    $userRepo->create($user);
}
 Then my userRepository class looks like this: class userRepository
{
    public function create ( User $user )
    {
        $this->db->exec ( "INSERT INTO ... QUERY TO SAVE THE USER" );
    }
}
 And my userEntity class looks like this: class userEntity
{
    private $username;
    private $password;

    public function setUsername ( $username )
    {
        $this->username = $username;
    }

    public function getUsername ( )
    {
        return $this->username;
    }

    public function setPassword ( $password )
    {
        $this->password = $password;
    }

    public function getPassword ( )
    {
        return $this->password;
    }
}
 Now the first thing that i think is wrong here is that i'm using a query inside the repository class. Where do i actually save the userEntity class to the database? So in other words, where do i perform the actual SQL queries? I guess the proper way would be to call a DAO inside the 'create' method of the repository. But i'm still trying to figure out how a DAO really looks and how different it is compared to a 'Model' in terms of the Model in a MVC pattern. But other than that, is this the proper way of implementing the repository pattern??
@CODE:function CreateAction ( )
{
    $userRepo = new userRepository ( );
    $user = new userEntity ( );

    $user->setUsername('user');
    $user->setPassword('123456');

    $userRepo->create($user);
} class userRepository
{
    public function create ( User $user )
    {
        $this->db->exec ( "INSERT INTO ... QUERY TO SAVE THE USER" );
    }
} class userEntity
{
    private $username;
    private $password;

    public function setUsername ( $username )
    {
        $this->username = $username;
    }

    public function getUsername ( )
    {
        return $this->username;
    }

    public function setPassword ( $password )
    {
        $this->password = $password;
    }

    public function getPassword ( )
    {
        return $this->password;
    }
}

@TITLE:Turning off logging in Selenium (from Python)
@CONTENT:I've recently inherited some Selenium Webdriver code, written in Python 2.7. It is logging copious amounts of data to /tmp on Ubuntu - so much that it is becoming a problem. I am trying to turn it off (or at least down). I have been running around trying to RTFM, but this is a new version of Selenium (2.19.0) and the manuals aren't written yet! I can see there is a method called set_browser_log_level(logLevel) which sounds promising, but to get to it, I need to instantiate a selenium.selenium.selenium object. I don't otherwise have to instantiate one of these, and it takes a lot of parameters (which host? what port?) that I am not expecting to have to provide. Clearly, I am misunderstanding something. Can someone please explain either (a) how to turn off logging, or (b) what service is it that selenium.selenium.selenium.selenium.selenium (I may have got carried away there, sorry!) wants to talk to? Related question: In Selenium, how do I turn off logging? This is an older version of Selenium, and calling it from the scripting language, I believe.

@LINK:/questions/9178829/how-to-programmatically-add-ant-library-dependencies-for-mail-task
@TITLE:How to programmatically add Ant library dependencies for mail task
@CONTENT:I've been tasked with creating automated notifications for our Ant build scripts. This is so that when someone pushes out a deployment, our team can automatically receive an email about it. The obvious choice was to use Ant's mail task, which comes predefined with Ant: <target name="notify" description="notify team">
    <mail subject="latest deployment">
        <from address="me@gmail.com" />
        <to address="jimmy@yahoo.com" />
        <message>A new build has been pushed out to prod</message>
    </mail>
</target>
 However this results in the following runtime exception: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: javax.mail.internet.MimeMessage
 This is because Ant's mail task depends on JavaMail and JavaBeans Activation Framework, libraries which are apparently not included with its distribution. Why Ant would define a task that depended on a library but not include that library is unclear to me. This issue has already been discussed on this post: ant mail task using mail and activation jar in external location. Based on the answers there seem to be two solutions. The first is to manually put these library dependencies on the ant classpath. This can be done using the -lib command line argument, or in eclipse one can use Window > Preferences > Ant > Runtime > Global Entries, and then add mail.jar and activation.jar (I'm pretty sure this amounts to the same thing as -lib, correct me if I'm wrong). But this solution is undesirable for our team because it would mean every one of us would have to manually carry out these steps. I'm looking for a way to simply commit my notification code, and it should work on another eclipse install after svn update. The other solution in the linked post mentions a way to do the above programmatically, by calling Ant from itself: <exec executable="ant">
    <arg value="-lib"/>
    <arg value="PATH_TO_MY_LIB"/>
    <arg value="target"/>
</exec>
 The problem with this is that the Ant command line tool is apparently only included with the full install, not the eclipse distribution. So again there's no way to make it work without some manual action by anyone wanting to use the mail task. Is there any way I can automate this without adding another annoying step to project setup? I really don't understand why this is so hard to achieve - it seems like if the mail task wasn't predefined by Ant this would be easier. Hopefully I'm missing something.

@TITLE:How to handle dates in Backbone?
@CONTENT:I store dates in the DATETIME format in a MySQL database. When a model is fetched from the database, dates (in the DATETIME format) are converted to date objects in the model's initialize method. So far so good. When the model is saved to the server, the date objects need to be converted back to the DATETIME format in order for the server side code to interpret the dates correctly. I have used all sorts of hackery to do this, but I wonder at what stage can of the model's save method can I safely convert the dates to the DATETIME format? One approach is to do the following: this.model.save({
    date : date.toDateTime()
}, options);
 However, this causes a change event to be fired since the attributes hash before the save method is not the same as the hash after the save event (and this triggers Backbone's set method).

    date : date.toDateTime()

@TITLE:R- Why are Xs added to the names of variables in my data frame?
@CONTENT:When I use the read.csv() function in R to load data, I often find that an X has been added to variable names. I think I just about always see it it in the first variable, but I could be wrong. At first, I thought R might be doing this because I had a space at the beginning of the variable name - I don't. Second, I had read somewhere that if you have a variable that starts with a number, or is a very short variable name, R would add the X. The variable name is all text and the length of the name of this variable is 12 characters, so it's not short. Now, this is purely an annoyance. I can rename the column, but it does add a step, albeit a small one. Is there a way to prevent this from rogue X from infiltrating my data frame?

@CONTENT:Is there a decent guide explaining how to use the TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffers) tables on an ARM1176JZF-S core? Having looked over the technical documentation for the that ARM platform I still have no clue what a TLB is or what it looks like. As far as I understand, each TLB entry maps a virtual page to a physical page, allowing remapping and controlling memory permissions. Apart from that, I have absolutely no clue on how to use them. What structure does a TLB entry have? How do I create new entries? How do I handle VM in context switches for user-space threads? How do I ensure that those threads can only access specific pages assigned to their parent processes (enforce memory protection)? Do I save the TLB state for each context? Why are there two TLBs? What can I use the MicroTLB for if it can only have 10 entries? Surely, I need more than 10. It says that one of the parts of the main TLB is "a fully-associative array of eight elements, that is lockable". What is that? Do I only get to have 8 entries for the Main TLB? Thank you in advance. I'll be really glad if someone provides an explanation of what TLBs are. I'm currently working on a memory mapper for my kernel, and I've pretty much hit a dead end.

@TITLE:How can plugin systems be designed so they don't waste so many resources?
@CONTENT:I am trying to build a basic plugin system like the kind you often find in a CMS like WordPress. You have a folder of plugins which tie into the main system's operation through event notifications using an Observer or Event design pattern. The problem is it's impossible for the system to know which events the plugin wants to act upon - so the system has to load each plugin for every page request just to find out if that plugin is actually needed at some point. Needless to say, that's a lot of wasted resources right there--in the case of WordPress, that adds up to several extra MB of memory for each request! Are there alternative ways to do this? For example, is there a way to load all this once and then cache the results so that your system knows how to lazy-load plugins? In other words, the system loads a configuration file that specifies all the events that plugin wishes to tie into and then saves it in APC or something for future requests? If that also performs poorly, then perhaps there is a special file-structure that could be used to make educated guesses about when certain plugins are unneeded to fulfill the request.

@TITLE:Proper touch button behavior for MobileSafari
@CONTENT:MobileSafari as a rule has incorrect HTML button behavior (incorrect meaning: "not like an iOS native button"). Correct button behavior is as follows: User touches button: Button highlights User drags finger out of button: Button dims User drags finger back into button: Button highlights User drags finger out of button and releases: Button does not click MobileSafari buttons highlight when you touch them, stay highlighted no matter where you move, and click no matter where you release them (unless the view scrolls, in which case the touch is always canceled, even if you re-enter the button). This problem applies to all clickable things such as links (when -webkit-touch-callout is set to none). I have only found one web application so far that has correct button behavior: Facebook. Looking at their code for it, it looks like they've done quite a lot of jumping-through-hoops to make it work correctly (tracking all the mouse events manually and not using buttons at all). The code is dense, uses Javelin, and I'm not yet clear on all the pieces required to make it work. I know I'm somewhat kidding myself (since if it were easy, everyone would do it), but I'm going to ask anyway. Is there any generally-available piece of code that handles this feature? Is there a simpler solution than reverse engineering Javelin, even if it is only applicable to WebKit? (Javelin isn't very-well suited to my lightweight needs.) My ultimate goal is correct button behavior for a UIWebView embedded in a native app, so hybrid JavaScript/ObjC solutions are acceptable as well (though no hybrid approaches come to mind).

@TITLE:Using pytables, which is more efficient: scipy.sparse or numpy dense matrix?
@CONTENT:When using pytables, there's no support (as far as I can tell) for the scipy.sparse matrix formats, so to store a matrix I have to do some conversion, e.g. def store_sparse_matrix(self):
    grp1 = self.getFileHandle().createGroup(self.getGroup(), 'M')
    self.getFileHandle().createArray(grp1, 'data', M.tocsr().data)

def get_sparse_matrix(self):
    return sparse.csr_matrix((self.getGroup().M.data, self.getGroup().M.indices, self.getGroup().M.indptr))
 The trouble is that the get_sparse function takes some time (reading from disk), and if I understand it correctly also requires the data to fit into memory. The only other option seems to convert the matrix to dense format (numpy array) and then use pytables normally. However this seems to be rather inefficient, although I suppose perhaps pytables will deal with the compression itself?

@TITLE:Maven Inheritance and Aggregation Example Architecture
@CONTENT:I have a question regarding how best to re-structure a number of individual Maven projects using a combination of inheritance and aggregation. Setting the scene: There are 3 code based existing Maven projects all developed by the same team. 1 project is an API, lets call is project-api. The other 2 projects are web apps which utilise the project-api. Lets call them web-app1 and web-app2. All three projects have a couple of basic dependencies like log4j and junit in common. Aside from that, web-app1 and web-app2 depend on project-api and also share a number of additional common dependencies between them. I have been reading http://www.sonatype.com/books/mvnref-book/reference/pom-relationships-sect-pom-best-practice.html, I'm just wanting to confirm that I understand best practice. Inheritance: Would it make sense for me to create an organisational level parent POM that includes the dependencies (dependency management) that are common to all three projects and some environment settings and overarching project information. The intent being all Maven projects (not necessarily directly) inherit from this POM. Would it make sense for me to create another parent POM that includes the dependencies (dependency management) that are common to web-app1 and web-app2 and have only web-app1 and web-app2 inherit from this POM. I think this POM (lets call it web-app parent POM) should be a child POM of the organisational level parent POM. Aggregation: In terms of aggregation, I do not want to create a single artifact at the end of the day. Rather, I want to run one Maven build command (likely at the organisational POM level) to build the three projects in this order: project-api web-app1 web-app2 Does this mean the organisational parent POM would declare modules: project-api web-app parent POM And the web-app parent POM would declare modules: web-app1 web-app2 Note the web-app parent POM and organisational parent POM do not have any related code. I believe this is OK noting "In fact, in the Maven world, a project need not contain any code at all, merely a pom.xml." taken from http://maven.apache.org/pom.html. Finally, how do I ensure the build order I need is respected? E.g. Building the organisational parent POM would result in project-api being built and this latest build being used in the building of web-app1 and web-app2? I hope this isn't too confusing, happy to clarify if more info is required. Feel free to tell me if I have this completely wrong! Thanks.

@TITLE:Using AutoMapper in the Edit action method in an MVC3 application
@CONTENT:Here is my controller code, which works 100% as I need it to. However the POST method isn't using the AutoMapper and that is not OK. How can I use AutoMapper in this action method? I'm using Entity Framework 4 with the Repository Pattern to access data. public ActionResult Edit(int id)
{
    Product product = _productRepository.FindProduct(id);
    var model = Mapper.Map<Product, ProductModel>(product);
    return View(model);

        product.Name = model.Name;
        product.Description = model.Description;
        product.UnitPrice = model.UnitPrice;

        _productRepository.SaveChanges();

        return RedirectToAction("Index");
    }

    return View(model);
}
 If I use AutoMapper, the entity framework reference is lost and the data doesn't persist to the database. [HttpPost]
public ActionResult Edit(ProductModel model)
{
    if (ModelState.IsValid)
    {
        Product product = _productRepository.FindProduct(model.ProductId);
        product = Mapper.Map<ProductModel, Product>(model);

        _productRepository.SaveChanges();

        return RedirectToAction("Index");
    }

    return View(model);
}
 I'm guessing this is caused the Mapper.Map function returning a brand new Product object and because of that, no references to the entity framework graph is being kept. What alternatives do you suggest?
@CODE:public ActionResult Edit(int id)
{
    Product product = _productRepository.FindProduct(id);

@CONTENT:We've recently started to use the undocumented Ember.testing flag in our jasmine specs which effectively disables the autorun runloop feature. We've found that this requires us to be quite a bit more explicit about manually wrapping code in runloops but has also given us more stability in our specs as it highlights problems in the way we've written the spec and helps to document when bindings are important to the code under test. Is there an official line on the usage of this feature ? It appears to have had quite a positive impact in our app but I suspect most people aren't aware of it.

@TITLE:Switch R script from non-interactive to interactive
@CONTENT:I've an R script, that takes commandline arguments, where the top line is: #!/usr/bin/Rscript --slave
 I wanted to interrupt execution in a function (so I can interactively use the data variables that have been loaded by that point to work out the next bit of code I need to write). I added this inside the function in question: browser()
 but it gets ignored. A bit of searching suggests it might be because the program is running in non-interactive mode. But even more searching has not tracked down how I switch the script out non-interactive mode so that browser() will work. Something like a browser_yes_I_really_mean_it() function. P.S. I want to avoid altering the rest of the script if at all possible. My current approach is to copy and paste the code chunks, needed to prepare the data, into an interactive session; but as the script gets more and more complex this is getting more and more unreasonable. UPDATE: for anyone else with the same question, it appears the answer to the actual question is that it is impossible. Once you start R in a non-interactive mode the die is cast. The given answers are therefore workarounds: either you hack your code (remembering to unhack it afterwards), or you refactor to make debugging easier. (This comment is not intended as a criticism of the answers; the suggested refactoring makes the code cleaner anyway.)

@LINK:/questions/8698942/create-ssl-socket-on-android-with-self-signed-certificate
@TITLE:Create SSL-Socket on Android with self-signed certificate
@CONTENT:I'm trying to connect an Android app to a SSL-enabled server, which uses a self-signed certificate. I've already read through dozens of tutorials and the app is now accepting the certificate & connecting to the server, but I never get any data back. The original code i used to initialize the socket is this: //passphrase for keystore
char[] keystorePass="password".toCharArray();

//load own keystore (MyApp just holds reference to application context)
KeyStore keyStore=KeyStore.getInstance("BKS");
keyStore.load(MyApp.getStaticApplicationContext().getResources().openRawResource(R.raw.keystore),keystorePass);

//create a factory
TrustManagerFactory     trustManagerFactory=TrustManagerFactory.getInstance(KeyManagerFactory.getDefaultAlgorithm());
trustManagerFactory.init(keyStore);

//get context
SSLContext sslContext=SSLContext.getInstance("TLS");

//init context
sslContext.init(
    null,
    trustManagerFactory.getTrustManagers(), 
    new SecureRandom()
);

//create the socket
Socket socket=sslContext.getSocketFactory().createSocket("hostname",443);
socket.setKeepAlive(true);
 Afterwards, the run loop of the receiver thread uses socket.getInputStream() to access the input stream. As long as I use an unencrypted connection, this works without a problem. But the secure connection does not retrieve any data from the socket. I've verified this by adding log messages to the receive loop and even used OpenSSL's s_server to check. I retrieved data from the client, but the client never received anything I sent to it. As a last test, I tried to open a connection to www.google.com:443 like this: javax.net.SocketFactory fact=SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();
Socket socket=fact.createSocket(_config.getUri().getHost(), _config.getUri().getPort());
 Still the same result, connection works but using the InputStream I receive nothing from the server. Anybody got any ideas? EDIT: I'm currently not allowed to answer my own question, but here's the answer: Well, turns out the problem WAS the receive loop. I relied on InputStream.available() to get the number of bytes to read, but didn't realize it was rather unreliable (always returns 0 for SSL socket). So I switched the receive loop to use the blocking read() instead.
@CODE://passphrase for keystore
char[] keystorePass="password".toCharArray();

//load own keystore (MyApp just holds reference to application context)
KeyStore keyStore=KeyStore.getInstance("BKS");
keyStore.load(MyApp.getStaticApplicationContext().getResources().openRawResource(R.raw.keystore),keystorePass);

//create a factory
TrustManagerFactory     trustManagerFactory=TrustManagerFactory.getInstance(KeyManagerFactory.getDefaultAlgorithm());
trustManagerFactory.init(keyStore);

//get context
SSLContext sslContext=SSLContext.getInstance("TLS");

//init context
sslContext.init(
    null,
    trustManagerFactory.getTrustManagers(), 
    new SecureRandom()
);

//create the socket
Socket socket=sslContext.getSocketFactory().createSocket("hostname",443);
socket.setKeepAlive(true); javax.net.SocketFactory fact=SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();

@TITLE:Eclipse-CDT fails to find stdlib symbols in NDK project
@CONTENT:I am trying to write a simple Android application using the NDK and C++. Specifically, I'd like to use the gnustdc++ included with the newest version of the NDK (r7). The JNI library has compiled and worked perfectly fine as C, but now that I'm trying to introduce C++, I've run into some issues. I have added ${NDK_ROOT}/sources/cxx-stl/gnu-libstdc++/include/ to my project's include paths, and the #includes inline are resolved. However, attempting to actually use any STL class (such as vector) results in Symbol 'vector' could not be resolved. All of the standard C symbols imported from <stdlib.h> and such work as well, until I try to replace the #include with <cstdlib>. Then it fails with Function 'malloc' could not be resolved and so forth. Oddly enough, adding the stlport headers (in ${NDK_ROOT}/sources/cxx-stl/stlport/stlport) fixes all of my issues. However I am linking in GNU C++, not STLPort, so this is an inconvenient and improper "solution" at best. It seems odd that these headers would work but the others would not. Is Eclipse failing to index or resolve the GNU C++ headers? Android.mk LOCAL_PATH := $(call my-dir)

@LINK:/questions/8659351/2d-perlin-noise
@TITLE:2D Perlin Noise
@CONTENT:I have fully mastered the art of Perlin Noise in 3D, and now I'm trying to use my same implementation for a 2D algorithm. The problem seems to be in picking my gradient directions. In 3D I use 16 gradients in evenly distributed directions and this works great. In 2D I figured I'd use 8 gradients. up, down, left, right, and the four diagonal directions. Here is what I get: The general look of the noise is always correct, but the edges of the squares don't quite match up. I have also tried using other gradients or fewer gradients but get similar results. Here in another example you can see that the edges do match up sometimes and the results are fine in that area - When I don't use gradients and instead just interpolate between a value picked randomly at each of the 4 corners I get the right results, which is what makes me think it is the gradient part that is messing it up. Here is my code: //8 different gradient directions
private Point[] grads = new Point[] { 
    new Point(0, 1), new Point(1, 1), new Point(1, 0), new Point(1, -1), 
    new Point(0, -1), new Point(-1, -1), new Point(-1, 0), new Point(-1, 1),};

//takes the dot product of a gradient and (x, y)

        grads[i].X * x + grads[i].Y * y;
}

        ix = (int)(x),
        iy = (int)(y);

        x  = x - ix;
        y  = y - iy;

    float
        fx  = fade(x),
        fy  = fade(y);

        ix &= 255;
        iy &= 255;

    // here is where i get the index to look up in the list of 
    // different gradients.
    // hashTable is my array of 0-255 in random order
    int
        g00 = hashTable[ix +     hashTable[iy    ]],
        g10 = hashTable[ix + 1 + hashTable[iy    ]],
        g01 = hashTable[ix +     hashTable[iy + 1]],
        g11 = hashTable[ix + 1 + hashTable[iy + 1]];

    // this takes the dot product to find the values to interpolate between
    float
        n00 = dot2D(g00 & 7, x, y),
        n10 = dot2D(g10 & 7, x, y),
        n01 = dot2D(g01 & 7, x, y),
        n11 = dot2D(g11 & 7, x, y);

    // lerp() is just normal linear interpolation

@TITLE:How to avoid duplicate content-disposition headers with MVC3 FileContentResult?
@CONTENT:We have some files stored in sql database. On an ASP.NET MVC3 form, we display 2 links: View this file | Download this file These links go to these corresponding action methods. The download works as expected -- clicking a link forces a save dialog in the browser. However, the display is causing duplicate Content-Disposition headers to be sent to the browser, resulting in an error on Chrome, and an empty page in Firefox. [ActionName("display-file")]
public virtual ActionResult DisplayFile (Guid fileId, string fileName)
{
    var file = _repos.GetFileInfo(fileId);
    if (file != null)
    {
        Response.AddHeader("Content-Disposition", 
            string.Format("inline; filename={0}", file.Name));
        return File(file.Content, file.MimeType, file.Name);
    }
}

[ActionName("download-file")]
public virtual ActionResult DownloadFile (Guid fileId, string fileName)
{
    var file = _repos.GetFileInfo(fileId);
    if (file != null)
    {
        return File(file.Content, file.MimeType, file.Name);
    }
}
 Here are the 2 headers sent to the browser for the display action: Content-Disposition: inline; filename=name-of-my-file.pdf
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="name-of-my-file.pdf"
 I tried changing my custom content-disposition header to wrap the file name in double quotes, but it still sent 2 headers to the browser. I also tried removing the Content-Disposition header before adding the custom one, but it appears the attachment header is being added after the FileContentResult is returned. This code used to work. I ran a test just yesterday and noticed it is no longer working in Chrome or Firefox. This could be due to updates in the browsers. IE8 and Safari still open the file correctly. Update Thanks again Darin, you are correct. We actually used this approach because of another question you answered. A little more info about how this was ultimately solved on our end, we have a custom route for the display file link: context.MapRoute(null,
    "path/to/display-file-attachment/{fileId}/{fileName}",
    new
    {
        area = "AreaName",
        controller = "ControllerName",
        action = "DisplayFile",
    }
);
 The hyperlink on the page passes the file name to the action method through the route parameter, so it is already part of the URL. Thus, we did not need to add a custom content-disposition header in order to make the file name match the system's when a user decided to download it (by clicking save icon in browser PDF viewer). So we just used this: [ActionName("display-file")]
public virtual ActionResult DisplayFile (Guid fileId, string fileName)
{
    var file = _repos.GetFileInfo(fileId);
    if (file != null)
    {
        // no custom content-disposition header, and no 3rd fileName argument
        return File(file.Content, file.MimeType);
    }
}
@CODE:[ActionName("display-file")]
public virtual ActionResult DisplayFile (Guid fileId, string fileName)
{
    var file = _repos.GetFileInfo(fileId);
    if (file != null)
    {
        Response.AddHeader("Content-Disposition", 
            string.Format("inline; filename={0}", file.Name));
        return File(file.Content, file.MimeType, file.Name);
    }
}

[ActionName("download-file")]
public virtual ActionResult DownloadFile (Guid fileId, string fileName)
{
    var file = _repos.GetFileInfo(fileId);
    if (file != null)
    {
        return File(file.Content, file.MimeType, file.Name);
    }
} Content-Disposition: inline; filename=name-of-my-file.pdf
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="name-of-my-file.pdf" context.MapRoute(null,
    "path/to/display-file-attachment/{fileId}/{fileName}",
    new
    {
        area = "AreaName",
        controller = "ControllerName",

    }
); [ActionName("display-file")]

@TITLE:How to cancel a ComboBox SelectionChanged event?
@CONTENT:Is there an easy method to prompt the user to confirm a combo box selection change and not process the change if the user selected no? We have a combo box where changing the selection will cause loss of data. Basically the user selects a type, then they are able to enter attributes of that type. If they change the type we clear all of the attributes as they may no longer apply. The problem is that to under the selection you raise the SelectionChanged event again. Here is a snippet: if (e.RemovedItems.Count > 0)
{
    result = MessageBox.Show("Do you wish to continue?", 
        "Warning", MessageBoxButton.YesNo, MessageBoxImage.Warning);

    if (result == MessageBoxResult.No)
    {
        if (e.RemovedItems.Count > 0)
            ((ComboBox)sender).SelectedItem = e.RemovedItems[0];
        else
            ((ComboBox)sender).SelectedItem = null;
    }
}
 I have two solutions, neither of which I like. After the user selects 'No', remove the SelectionChanged event handler, change the selected item and then register the SelectionChanged event handler again. This means you have to hold onto a reference of the event handler in the class so that you can add and remove it. Create a ProcessSelectionChanged boolean as part of the class. Always check it at the start of the event handler. Set it to false before we change the selection back and then reset it to true afterwards. This will work, but I don't like using flags to basically nullify an event handler. Anyone have an alternative solution or an improvement on the ones I mention?
@CODE:SelectionChanged if (e.RemovedItems.Count > 0)
{
    result = MessageBox.Show("Do you wish to continue?",

    {
        if (e.RemovedItems.Count > 0)
            ((ComboBox)sender).SelectedItem = e.RemovedItems[0];
        else

@TITLE:What is the actual number of vertex uniform components for GLSL shader on ATI graphics card?
@CONTENT:I'm writing a GLSL vertex shader for an iMac with a AMD Radeon HD 6970M 2048 MB graphics card: GL_MAX_VERTEX_ATTRIBS: 16
GL_MAX_VERTEX_UNIFORM_COMPONENTS: 4096
GL_VERSION: 2.1 ATI-7.12.9
GL_SHADING_LANGUAGE_VERSION: 1.20
 In my shader I would like to have a large array of uniform mat4s: uniform mat4 T[65]
 but if I try to have 65 of these my shader (secretly) switches to Apple Software Renderer mode. If I instead use 64: uniform mat4 T[64]
 everything is fine. Seems to be a problem with exceeding the maximum number of uniforms. But as I wrote above I'm getting 4096 for GL_MAX_VERTEX_UNIFORM_COMPONENTS so 4096/(4*4) = 256 not 64... OpenGL.org wiki says ATI/AMD note: The ATI max component values are wrong. They are the actual number of components divided by 4. But reading this I would think that if I query GL_MAX_VERTEX_UNIFORM_COMPONENTS and get 4096 that I actually have 16,384. What seems to be the case is that GL_MAX_VERTEX_UNIFORM_COMPONENTS returns the actual number of components multiplied by 4. This would then give 1024/(4*4) = 64. Can anyone confirm this? Edit: My shader is simply: #version 120

// 65 goes into software render mode
#define MAX_T 64
attribute vec4 indices;
uniform mat4 T[MAX_T];

void main()
{
  gl_Position =  T[int(indices[0])]*gl_Vertex;

 This works fine. I get the following figure: However, instead of having cells labeled NA, I would like to leave them as 1.00 values, but color all cells between 10 (a level of 0.10) and 79 (a level of 0.79) with colors. Anything greater than 79 gets colored with the same color as what is applied to a cell with the approx. level of 79. Or, preferably, said cells would be colored black, with no text inside them at all. Is there a way to accomplish this with levelplot and lattice? FINAL EDIT This doesn't give much of a gradient in colors, but I'm close enough that I'll award the bounty, and perhaps look into ggplot2 as an alternative. Thanks for all your hard work on this. Here is the final edit of my script: #! /foo/bar/bin/Rscript --vanilla

                 stringsAsFactors=TRUE, 
                 colClasses=c("factor", "factor", "numeric"))
df$level <- round(df$level*100, 0)

# reorder cell type row-factors (in reverse of given order)
df$y <- factor(df$y, levels=unique(df$y[length(df$y):1]))

lowestValue <- min(df$level)
secondHighestValue <- unique(sort(df$level, decreasing=TRUE))[2]

n <- 10
col.seq <- seq(lowestValue, secondHighestValue, length.out=n)
brks <- c(0, col.seq, Inf)
cuts <- cut(df$level, breaks = brks)
colors <- colorRampPalette(c("white", "red"))(length(levels(cuts))-1)
colors <- c(colors, "black")

cls <- rep(colors, times = table(cuts))

 Here is the levelplot that this script makes: If I increase n above 15, the cell coloring breaks once again, returning to a diagonal of bright red, instead of black (as shown).

@CONTENT:Why does javascript prefers to return a String over any other choices ? Consider the following snippet. var arr = ['Hello1', 'Hello2', 'Hello3'];

Array.prototype.item = function(x) {

};

console.log( arr.item(43) ); // returns a?e
 I intentionally called a non-existent array element. However i cannot understand why does arr.item(43) returns the String ? Why not null or undefined or even 12 ?

@TITLE:How to group dates by week?
@CONTENT:I am writing an Excel exporter for a bespoke application I am creating, and I have a question about LINQ grouping in C#. Basically, this new Excel exporter class is given two dates. The class then retrieves all consignments between this date range. As part of this exporter, I need to be able to group the dates into weeks, and get the values for that week. So for example, if I'm given 07/12/2011 and 22/12/2011 (dd/MM/yyyy format), I need to group all consignments between them ranges into weeks (each week beginning with Sunday). The ideal result using the above dates would be Week 1: (consignments between 04/12/2011 and 10/12/2011) 
Week 2: (consignments between 11/12/2011 and 17/12/2011) 
Week 3: (consignments between 18/11/2011 and 24/12/2011)
 Any ideas?
@CODE:Week 1: (consignments between 04/12/2011 and 10/12/2011) 
Week 2: (consignments between 11/12/2011 and 17/12/2011) 
Week 3: (consignments between 18/11/2011 and 24/12/2011)

 You can see app memory usage increasing till it gets a memory warning. Then I correctly respond to the memory warning and free a bunch (250MB!) of memory. At that point my app is terminated and iOS goes to the iPad home screen. The "Memory usage" logs here are displayed with my logMemoryUsage() function which is based on code from this answer. For the record, I'm using SDWebImage to cache UIImages in memory, but as shown, it handles memory warnings by emptying its cache (rather large at this point). I realize I could tweak SDWebImage's caching to not fill all available memory and just wait for memory warnings, but that begs the following question... Why is iOS terminating my app, even though I'm responding to memory warnings by happily freeing a ton of memory?

@LINK:/questions/8450779/prepend-vs-append-perf-in-mathematica
@TITLE:Prepend vs. Append perf in Mathematica
@CONTENT:in Lisp-like systems, cons is the normal way to PREPEND an element to a list. Functions that append to a list are much more expensive because they walk the list to the end and then replace the final null with a reference to the appended item. IOW (pseudoLisp) (prepend list item) = (cons item list) = cheap!
(append list item) = (cond ((null? list) (cons item null))
                           (#t (cons (car list (append (cdr list) item)))))
 Question is whether the situation is similar in Mathemtica? In most regards, Mathematica's lists seem to be singly-linked like lisp's lists, and, if so, we may presume that Append[list,item] is much more expensive than Prepend[list,item]. However, I wasn't able to find anything in the Mathematica documentation to address this question. If Mathematica's lists are doubly-linked or implemented more cleverly, say, in a heap or just maintaining a pointer-to-last, then insertion may have a completely different performance profile. Any advice or experience would be appreciated.
@CODE:(prepend list item) = (cons item list) = cheap!

@TITLE:Get first and last name of a contact rather than single display name?
@CONTENT:I am currently working with the Android Contacts content provider and currently can access a contacts full display name without issue using the following code: String[] PROJECTION = new String[] {
         ContactsContract.Contacts._ID,
         ContactsContract.Contacts.DISPLAY_NAME,
         ContactsContract.Contacts.HAS_PHONE_NUMBER,

Cursor cur = managedQuery(ContactsContract.Contacts.CONTENT_URI, 
                PROJECTION, SELECTION, null, sortOrder);
 However I want to be able to get both the contacts first and last name separately, I have tried to use the StructuredName in an attempt to get this but I can't seem to get it working. Can anyone point me in the right direction as to how to use the StructuredName correctly to get the name split into First and Last? UPDATE: Following hovanessyan's advice I have attempted the following:     String[] PROJECTION = new String[] {
            ContactsContract.Data._ID,
            ContactsContract.Data.DISPLAY_NAME,
            ContactsContract.Data.HAS_PHONE_NUMBER,
    };

    String SELECTION = ContactsContract.CommonDataKinds.StructuredName.IN_VISIBLE_GROUP + " = '1'";

    String sortOrder = ContactsContract.CommonDataKinds.StructuredName.DISPLAY_NAME + " COLLATE LOCALIZED ASC";

    Cursor cursor = getContentResolver().query(ContactsContract.Data.CONTENT_URI, PROJECTION, SELECTION, null, sortOrder);

    int indexGivenName = cursor.getColumnIndexOrThrow(ContactsContract.CommonDataKinds.StructuredName.GIVEN_NAME);
    int indexFamilyName = cursor.getColumnIndexOrThrow(ContactsContract.CommonDataKinds.StructuredName.FAMILY_NAME);
    int indexDisplayName = cursor.getColumnIndexOrThrow(ContactsContract.CommonDataKinds.StructuredName.DISPLAY_NAME);

    while (cursor.moveToNext()) {
        String given = cursor.getString(indexGivenName);
        String family = cursor.getString(indexFamilyName);
        String display = cursor.getString(indexDisplayName);
        Log.e("XXX", "Name: | " + given + " | " + family + " | " + display);
    } 
 However using the PROJECTION causes a crash as follows: 12-08 16:52:01.575: E/AndroidRuntime(7912): Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Invalid column has_phone_number
 If I remove the PROJECTION I get all the results printed out but a lot of them contain NULL. For example: 12-08 16:56:14.055: E/XXX(8155): Name: | null | null | null
12-08 16:56:14.055: E/XXX(8155): Name: | null | null | null

12-08 16:56:14.055: E/XXX(8155): Name: | null | null | null
 So can anyone see what I'm doing wrong in that my PROJECTION doesn't work? FURTHER UPDATE: I have sorted out the issues with my PROJECTION but now I have an issue where the DATA content provider is supplying me back with all the null data and causing NULL pointer exceptions in my code. A cursor count from ContactsContract.Contacts gives me back 115 for example but using the DATA table gives me back 464 using the same parameters and this is causing huge issues in my app. Anyone have any ideas why that is?

This got me thinking: Is it always safe to forcefully abort a command (Ctrl-C or kill)? What if a command crasheds (out of memory, bug, network/FS problem)? Are repository changes "transactional" in the sense that incomplete changes are "rolled back" (like in a versioning filesystem)? Or do I risk repository corruption in that case?

@LINK:/questions/8364911/how-can-i-use-linq-to-objects-to-put-a-set-of-contiguous-dates-in-one-group
@TITLE:How can I use Linq to Objects to put a set of contiguous dates in one group?
@CONTENT:I have a troublesome query to write. I'm currently writing some nasty for loops to solve it, but I'm curious to know if Linq can do it for me. I have: struct TheStruct
{
 public DateTime date {get; set;} //(time portion will always be 12 am)
 public decimal A {get; set;}
 public decimal B {get; set;}
}
 and a list that contains these structs. Let's say it's ordered this way: List<TheStruct> orderedList = unorderedList.OrderBy(x => x.date).ToList();
 If you put the orderedList struct dates in a set they will always be contiguous with respect to the day.. that is if the latest date in the list was 2011/01/31, and the earliest date in the list was 2011/01/01, then you'd find that the list would contain 31 items, one for each date in January. Ok, so what I want to do is group the list items such that: Each item in a group must contain the same Decimal A value and the same Decimal B value The date values in a group must form a set of contiguous dates, if the date values were in order If you summed up the sums of items in each group, the total would equal the number of items in the original list (or you could say a struct with a particular date can't belong to more than one group) Any Linq masters know how to do this one? Thanks!
@CODE:struct TheStruct
{
 public DateTime date {get; set;} //(time portion will always be 12 am)
 public decimal A {get; set;}
 public decimal B {get; set;}
} List<TheStruct> orderedList = unorderedList.OrderBy(x => x.date).ToList(); GroupBy A B OrderBy date Distinct

@CONTENT:I couldn't find answer after having read all the following: PEP 338 Executing modules as scripts documentation of runpy standard module description of Python interpreter's -m option Rationale: When a test script which uses relative imports is being run without -m option I could print a warning message instead of leaving user with standard traceback leading to ValueError: Attempted relative import in non-package exception. Without knowing this I can catch this exception and only suggest lack of -m option could be the reason of error.

@TITLE:glDeleteTextures does not seem to free up texture memory on Windows, is there no solution?
@CONTENT:I have been having some problems with my openGL application running out of memory and I am trying to track down my problem. To this end, I created a small test program that basically just loads a giant texture from a file calls glDeleteTextures and then loads it again, if I run this test program on OSX this process can run for hundreds of iterations with no problems (the most I ran it for was 1024 and this had no problems) but after about 14 iterations on windows I get a GLU_OUT_OF_MEMORY error.

@LINK:/questions/8331180/is-it-possible-to-make-oauth-secure-on-ios
@TITLE:Is it possible to make oauth secure on iOS?
@CONTENT:Is it possible to make oauth secure on iOS? I am investigating OAuth 2.0 as a means to implement single sign-on + authorization for a "suite" of iOS apps. To explain my concerns, I'll simplify and use Facebook + a 3rd party app that uses Facebook for authentication (let's say Words/"Words with Friends"). For the purpose of example, I'll assume that Facebook registers to support scheme/protocol "facebook://" and that Words registers to support "words://" I also make the assumption that it is not possible to secure the "client-secret" or the protocol in an iOS application because you can decompile the application. Any ways that I have come up with to secure this results in security by obscurity. Another assumption is that there is no way to prevent two applications from registering to handle the same protocol. The behavior when two apps both register for the same protocol is indeterminate. (Although it appears that the first app to launch on the device gets registered while the second apps registration is ignored) If I understand the workflow between Facebook (user-agent) and Words (client) on the iOS device: User launches Words user chooses to logon via Facebook credentials Words invokes openUrl("facebook://") which contains, among other things an identifier for Words as an application and a redirect uri (i.e. "words://") iOS launches Facebook application User enteres credentials, which Facebook application validates against Facebook authorization server. User prompted to authorize Words to access Facebook data (i.e. Words can access my friends list) Facebook invokes callback uri provided by Words along with access token (i.e. words://access_token?token_here) Words uses this token to access my friends list (i.e. protected resource data) Assuming the above is correct, if I want to be malicious and access random people's friends list, I could create an application that also registers to handle the protocol "words://" and get it on the app store. If someone has my app and Words installed and my app is the one that successfully registered (i.e. launched on the device before Words), then: Launch Words, choose to logon, launches Facebook user authenticates / authorizes Facebook attempts to redirect back to Words by invoking openUrl on the redirect url My App (not Words) is launched My App now has access to the auth code, which (with the secret learned by decompiling) can be exchanged for an access_token, with rights to access your friends list I am hoping that my reasoning is flawed above or I would have to conclude (specifically) that Facebook iOS authentication for 3rd party apps is insecure. More generically, is it possible to implement OAuth 2.0 (authorization/implicit grant workflows) securely on iOS application?

The solution should also work well for a developer who's working locally. I'm using Jenkins, and running in trouble whatever way I try to do this.

So far I was using the floating <div> on z-index 2 and I logged the text inside, but this is not sufficient. I am looking for some lightweight JavaScript JSONP logger and some PHP or Tomcat server counterpart... Thanks STeN

@CONTENT:When it comes to remember me cookies, there are 2 distinct approaches: Hashes The remember me cookie stores a string that can identify the user (i.e. user ID) and a string that can prove that the identified user is the one it pretends to be - usually a hash based on the user password. Tokens The remember me cookie stores a random (meaningless), yet unique string that corresponds with with a record in a tokens table, that stores a user ID. Which approach is more secure and what are its disadvantages?

When a user is typing a tag, it should display an autosuggest box for the user's input. The display should be plain and simple: just plain-text comma-separated tags. It should allow tags containing spacebar (e.g. 'funny cats'). Comma symbol should be used for separation, not keystroke for ',', because some non-English keyboard layouts have commas assigned to other keys. Is there such a plugin and if so, where can I find it?

@TITLE:Entities across bounded contexts in Domain-Driven Design
@CONTENT:I am trying to understand how entities operate in multiple bounded contexts. Given an Employee of a Company. In (for example) the Human Resources context, this person has a name, surname, address, salary reference number, and bank account. But in the Accounting context all that is relevant is the salary reference number and bank account. Do you have an Employee entity in the HR context and a Value-Type (e.g. SalariedEmployee) in the Accounting context? class Employee
{
    public BankAccount BankAcountDetails { get; set; }
    public string FullName { get; set; }
    public Address ResidentialAddress { get; set; }
    public string SalaryRef { get; set; }
}
 SalariedEmployee class (??) : Employee's value-type class SalariedEmployee
{
    public SalariedEmployee(string salaryRef, BankAccount bankAcountDetails)
    {
        ...
    }

    public string SalaryRef { get; }
    public BankAccount BankAcountDetails { get; }
}
 Does the HRService in the bounded context return this information? Or do you use the Employee class in both contexts?
@CODE:SalariedEmployee class Employee
{
    public BankAccount BankAcountDetails { get; set; }
    public string FullName { get; set; }
    public Address ResidentialAddress { get; set; }
    public string SalaryRef { get; set; }

@TITLE:Should I use specflow at unit test level? [duplicate]
@CONTENT:Possible Duplicate: SpecFlow/BDD for Unit Tests? Over the last few years I have worked in TDD using NUnit/Moq and over the last few months I have been getting to grips with BDD using mSpec. So far so good but we now want to move more into acceptance criteria based tests where the business analysts are involved and we get an outside in development process. So now we have predefined Gherkin syntax files and with specflow it feels the right way to work. However, at a unit test level having predefined Gherkin files would go against what I understand about TDD. In other words, you design as you go a long evolving your design with behaviour. As we are working using the outside in approach, now at unit test level could it be that we now have the specifications/behaviors that can now be used to drive my unit tests (just feels like it is against the way I have been doing TDD)? Earlier these files were important for acceptance tests but as a developer I will work alone so they are not necessary unless I use SpecFlow. Also what benefit would we have at a unit test level having GWT files maintained when we are using mspec? Developers should be able to just jump into the code and read the tests or just run the test runner to see what it is doing. TIA JD

@TITLE:Git Submodules with Heroku
@CONTENT:The Problem I have a Rails 3.1 app on Heroku which will soon require a bunch of (3rd party) submodules (some of which have submodules). Unfortunately, Heroku lacks submodule support. One suggestion on Heroku's website is to move the contents of the submodules into the main repo (here). This will work fine the first time, but there is a possibility that it wont the second. This could be caused by a major update in one of the third party submodules where a fast forward merge is unsuccessful. Obviously we can't manually merge a third party project. The "Solution" Our tentative solution is as follows: Create a new 'temp' branch based off of the latest stable dev branch and merge the submodules into the project. Checkout to a 'heroku' branch. Nuke the contents of this heroku branch to avoid any possible conflicts, i.e. create a commit with everything deleted. Merge the temp branch into the heroku branch. Push this heroku branch to our heroku server. The Advantages This will avoid any possible conflicts in third party submodules and is scriptable. The Disavantages This is extremely inelegant and is the ultimate anti-pattern for SVC. The Question Is there a better way to do this?

 I set this field as serialized into an array in the model. # app/models/domain.rb
class Domain < ActiveRecord::Base
  serialize :names, Array
end
 Create the ActiveAdmin resource for this model > rails g active_admin:resource Domain
    create  app/admin/domains.rb
 then, in the app/admin/domains.rb, I setup the various blocks to handle the serialized field as such # app/admin/domains.rb
ActiveAdmin.register Domain do

  index do
    id_column
    column :names do |domain|
      "#{domain.names.join( ", " ) unless domain.names.nil?}"
    end
    default_actions
  end

  show do |domain|
    attributes_table do
      row :names do
        "#{domain.names.join( ", " ) unless domain.names.nil?}"
      end
    end
  end

  form do |f|
    f.inputs "Domain" do
      f.input :names
    end
    f.buttons
  end

  # before we save, take the param[:domain][:name] parameter,
  # split and save it to our array
  before_save do |domain|
    domain.names = params[:domain][:names].split(",") unless params[:domain].nil? or params[:domain][:names].nil?
  end
end
 Nearly everything works great -- my names are displayed as comma separated in the index and show views. When I update a record with my names field set to "a,b,c", the before_save works to turn that into an array that is then saved via the ActiveRecord serialize. What I can not solve is how to make the edit form put in a comma-separated list into the text field. I tried using a partial and using formtastic syntax directly as well as trying to make it work via the active_admin DLS syntax. Does anyone know how to make this work? Specifically, if I have the following array saved in my domain.names field: # array of names saved in the domain active_record
domain.names = ["a", "b", "c"]
 how to change:       form do |f|
        f.inputs "Domain" do
          f.input :names
        end
        f.buttons
      end
 so that when the edit form is loaded, in the text field instead of seeing abc, you see a,b,c.

@LINK:/questions/8146851/how-to-deploy-a-threadsafe-asynchronous-rails-app
@TITLE:How to deploy a threadsafe asynchronous Rails app?
@CONTENT:I've read tons of material around the web about thread safety and performance in different versions of ruby and rails and I think I understand those things quite well at this point. What seems to be oddly missing from the discussions is how to actually deploy an asynchronous Rails app. When talking about threads and synchronicity in an app, there are two things people want to optimize: utilizing all CPU cores with minimal RAM usage being able to serve new requests while previous requests are waiting on IO Point 1 is where people get (rightly) excited about JRuby. For this question I am only trying to optimize point 2. Say this is the only controller in my app: TheController < ActionController::Base
  def fast
    render :text => "hello"
  end

  def slow
    render :text => User.count.to_s
  end
end
 fast has no IO and can serve hundreds or thousands of requests per second, and slow has to send a request over the network, wait for work to be done, then receive the answer over the network, and is therefore much slower than fast. So an ideal deployment would allow hundreds of requests to fast to be fulfilled while a request to slow is waiting on IO. What seems to be missing from the discussions around the web is which layer of the stack is responsible for enabling this concurrency. thin has a --threaded flag, which will "Call the Rack application in threads [experimental]" -- does that start a new thread for each incoming request? Spool up rack app instances in threads that persist and wait for incoming requests? Is thin the only way or are there others? Does the ruby runtime matter for optimizing point 2?
@CODE:TheController < ActionController::Base
  def fast
    render :text => "hello"
  end

  def slow
    render :text => User.count.to_s
  end
end fast slow fast fast slow --threaded

@TITLE:Check if String can be converted to a given type in C# [duplicate]
@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: Fastest way to check if a string can be parsed 5 answers I have to validate user input data and ensure a string value is convertible to a type specified at run-time. I don't necessarily need to do the actual conversion, just test to make sure the input value is valid. I haven't found a built in class or method that will perform this type of evaluation, but if I am missing one, please let me know. I'm working with C#4.0, if there is any version specific solutions available. The method only has to deal with the "standard" types (built-in value data types plus String). The only custom type I would need to evaluate is specific enum types that are defined in the library. I have 2 solutions I'm currently weighing, but neither is perfect, so I was hoping there was a 3rd option (or something built into the framework that I missed). I am heavily leaning towards Solution #2 since using the try-catch in Solution #1 just seems wrong. Solution 1: Convert.ChangeType() with try/catch public Boolean CheckType(String value, Type type)
{
    try
    {
        var obj = Convert.ChangeType(value, type);
        return true;
    }
    catch(InvalidCastException)
    {
        return false;
    }
    catch(FormatException)
    {
        return false;
    }
    catch(OverflowException)
    {
        return false;
    }
    catch(ArgumentNullException)
    {
        return false;
    }
}
 Solution 2 if/else chain with Type check and TryParse public Boolean CheckType(String value, Type type)
{
    if (type == typeof(String))
    {
        return true;
    }
    else if (type == typeof(Boolean))
    {
        Boolean b;
        return Boolean.TryParse(value, out b); 
    }
    else if (type == typeof(Int32))
    {
        Int32 i;
        return Int32.TryParse(value, out i); 
    }
    else if (type == typeof(Int64))
    {
        Int64 l;
        return Int64.TryParse(value, out l); 
    }
    // similar code to check all other types 
    // (Int16, UInt32, UInt64, UInt16, Byte, SByte, Single, Double, Decimal,
    //  Enum, Char, DateTime)
    .
    .
    .
    .
    .
    else
        throw new ArgumentException("Invalid type evaluation");

}
 This method may be called several hundred or even a thousand times in a short interval if the input data is seriously messed up or corrupted, so I'm worried that the repeated if/else checks will be a drag on performance (I'm not necessarily trying to optimize at this point, I just want to make sure I'm considering other options). The other issue I have with both solutions is that both actually convert the string value to a new value of the expected type, and in both cases, I'm swallowing the result.
@CODE:Convert.ChangeType() public Boolean CheckType(String value, Type type)
{
    try
    {
        var obj = Convert.ChangeType(value, type);

    {
        return false;

@CONTENT:My question somewhat overlaps with this and several other similar ones. Those have some great answers, but I've read them and I'm still confused, so please don't consider this question a duplicate. So, I have the following code: class A {

 _a is left uninitialized in inst1 and inst2 and is initialized to 0 in inst3. Which initialization is called which, and why does the code work as it does? Please take into I account I don't have a C++ 03 standard at hand, but I have the last C++ 11 draft (I'm programming by '03 standard, though), so quotations of the '03 standard or references to '11 are most welcome. P. S. The original task behind this research was to correctly zeto-initialize a member of arbitrary template type T.

@TITLE:Invoking a Java/AXIS Web Service from .NET: the return null issue
@CONTENT:I've been seeking for this problem through all google, stackoverflow and more. And I found a lot of related answers to it, but not a real solution. I'm consuming an Axis Service from a .NET Client but the return is always null, no matter what parameters I send, always is null. So i started to look, and I tried to consume it from the SOAPUI, and it worked!. So my first thought was, .NET is doing something wrong, and i searched and searched and I found that there are some problems with the namespaces. Related post here So after this, I tried to consume the Service via Service Reference, Web Reference, creating a proxy with WSDL.EXE( It was created pretty well!) and looked for all the namespaces, but All lokked good.. I made some changes to it to the namespace but nothing. Then I found that not just the namespaces are problematics, also the arrays; and in fact the service Returns something like this. <soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">

 (I got this example from the SOAPUI). The related post is here I tried also this. And got another possible trouble from here with the listed items of an array named as "item", as you can see in the WebServiceResponse mentioned above, they are listed like that. So everything seemed to me that is a deserialization problem from c#. And looking I found a half-solution to all of this. The reality was that actually .NET get the response pretty good, all that it has is problem with the deserializing step maybe for all the posibles causes mentioned above(multiple namespaces, arrays, array items named like "item"). http://www.codeproject.com/KB/webservices/Java_WS_NET.aspx I overrided the method in my Proxy like this: protected override System.Net.WebResponse GetWebResponse(System.Net.WebRequest request)
    {
        WebResponse wr = base.GetWebResponse(request);
        StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(wr.GetResponseStream());
        //throw new Exception(sr.ReadToEnd());
        return wr ;      
    }
 I thrown the exception to see if the result of the Service was catched and in fact is right there! So after all os this I dont know if there is a fix, a service pack, someone found a solution or anything of HOW I CAN DESEREALIZE CORRECTLY THE WebResponse. Or how to consume correctly that axis service, I think the best aproach to this is just serialize the response correctly overriding the method, because it seems like a bug of .NET, I think it has troubles with the because everything array has an "item" on it. Thanks in advance for read this post. I would really really apreciate any help!. Thanks again!.

@TITLE:Cannot view gvisMotionChart from printed html file
@CONTENT:When I save the code for a Motion Chart into an html file and try to open it, I get the footer and the "initializing" progress bar blinks for a split second, but nothing else shows up. so M1 <- gvisMotionChart(Fruits, idvar="Fruit", timevar="Year")
plot(M1)
 works great, but print(M1, file='d:/delete/fruit.html')
 and then opening the resulting file in a browser comes up blank (except for the footer). Is there a way I can save this visualization and circulate it around?

@TITLE:Failing to compile curlpp
@CONTENT:I've been on this for a few hours now (and that's just today) so I could really use some help. I always code in a Windows environment so I am trying to add curlpp to my Code::Blocks project. I downloaded curl-7.22.0-devel-mingw32 and added all those libraries to Code::Blocks project. I downloaded curl-7.22.0 and compiled it using vc6curl.dsw which made libcurl.lib, added that to Code::Blocks project. Downloaded curlpp-0.7.3 Added MinGW\lib\libwsock32.a to Code::Blocks project. Added the following directories to the project: curlpp-0.7.3\include and curl-7.22.0\include But I get a lot of "undefined reference" errors, so I'm guessing that means curlpp needs compiling too. It contains a VC8 project, so I downloaded Visual C++ 2005 Express and installed. First error I get when opening the project is that the examples couldn't be loaded. Not really a problem, I guess. Trying to build the project right away, gives the error "Cannot open include file: 'curl/curl.h'" so I add the cURL includes folder curl-7.22.0\include to the project and try again. 1>------ Build started: Project: curlpp, Configuration: DebugDynamic Win32 ------

 Erorr upon error upon error, it's driving me nuts. Googeling that one doesn't really help either. I found some forum posts saying WS2_32.Lib had to be added, and that's in C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0A\Lib but adding that to the libraries folder in the VS2005 project doesn't seem to do anything. I'm just losing track of it all.. how is this supposed to go? I thought it would be as simple as: Compile curl Compile curlpp Profit! But unfortunately it doesn't seem to be that easy. UPDATE Oh yeah, I forgot, initially I also got these errors: c1xx : fatal error C1083: Cannot open source file: '.\src\curlpp\Infos.cpp': No such file or directory

c1xx : fatal error C1083: Cannot open source file: '.\src\curlpp\Option.cpp': No such file or directory

c1xx : fatal error C1083: Cannot open source file: '.\src\utilspp\singleton\LifetimeLibrary.cpp': No such file or directory

c1xx : fatal error C1083: Cannot open source file: '.\src\utilspp\singleton\PrivateMembers.cpp': No such file or directory
 But in src\curlpp there are: Info.cpp
Options.cpp
 So I just copied them and renamed the copies to Info2.cpp
Option.cpp
 And in src\utilspp there are LifetimeLibrary.cpp
PrivateMembers.cpp
 So I just made a folder "singleton" there and copied the files in there. It's as if curlpp is.. broken? But it must be something weird I am doing because someone would have noticed! UPDATE2 Ok I started from scratch and figured out that I also had to add the includes folder from the windows SDK. This took care of the Cannot open include file: 'winsock2.h' errors. But now I'm getting a buttload of other errors: 1>------ Build started: Project: curlpp, Configuration: DebugDynamic Win32 ------

 Will this ever end? Additional Libraries now looks like this: "C:\Users\admin\Downloads\curl-7.22.0\curl-7.22.0\lib\Debug";
"C:\Program Files (x86)\CodeBlocks\MinGW\lib";
"C:\Users\admin\Downloads\curl-7.22.0\curl-7.22.0\lib";
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0A\Lib";
"C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1\Lib"
 And the includes: "C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1\Include";
"C:\Users\admin\Downloads\curl-7.22.0\curl-7.22.0\include";
.\;
include\curlpp;
include;
"$(BOOST_PATH)"
 What is BOOST PATH? And also, to get rid of the "libcurl.lib not found" error, I opened the project I found in curl-7.22.0 and compiled it, but that means libcurl.lib is in the "lib\Debug" folder which I included as you can see above, did I do that correctly? UPDATE3: I noticed a file called create-vc-solution.bat so, after downloading "sed" for windows, I tried creating a vc solution for VS9 (There was no option for 10) hoping that would work, but here's what I get when I open the solution file that creates in VS2010: Converting project file 'C:\Users\admin\Downloads\curlpp-0.7.3\curlpp-0.7.3\curlpp.examples.VC9.vcproj'. 
File 'C:\Users\admin\Downloads\curlpp-0.7.3\curlpp-0.7.3\curlpp.examples.VC9.vcproj' was not found. 
Project upgrade failed. 

Converting project file 'C:\Users\admin\Downloads\curlpp-0.7.3\curlpp-0.7.3\curlpp.VC9.vcproj'. 
File 'C:\Users\admin\Downloads\curlpp-0.7.3\curlpp-0.7.3\curlpp.VC9.vcproj' was not found. 
Project upgrade failed. 
 curlpp.examples.VC9.vcproj and curlpp.VC9.vcproj were never even created. Has curlpp been tested at all? By anyone? I'm starting to think this isn't even my fault anymore.

@TITLE:Dealing with Arrays of Deferred Objects
@CONTENT:Since using $.Deferred I've run into this scenario a couple times: I have a list of values each of which yields a Deferred Object in some way and I want to execute a callback once all of the Deferred Objects are resolved. A more concrete example would be something like this: var urls = [ 'foo.com', 'bar.com', 'baz.com', 'qux.com' ],
    defers = [], defer;

for( var i = 0, j = urls.length; i < j; i++ ){
    defer = $.ajax({
        url: 'http://' + urls[ i ]
    });

    defers.push(defer);
}

$.when.apply(window, defers).done(function(){
    // Do Something
});
 Is there a more elegant solution than the code in my example?
@CODE:$.Deferred var urls = [ 'foo.com', 'bar.com', 'baz.com', 'qux.com' ],
    defers = [], defer;

for( var i = 0, j = urls.length; i < j; i++ ){
    defer = $.ajax({
        url: 'http://' + urls[ i ]
    });

    defers.push(defer);
}

$.when.apply(window, defers).done(function(){
    // Do Something

@TITLE:How to Sync CSS3 Animation Events and Event Listeners with jQuery
@CONTENT:I am trying to figure out out a solid, cross-(modern)browser method for using CSS3 Animation Events and Event Listeners to gain fine-tuned control over CSS3 animations. I know its possible to do this. Sadly it's just WAY beyond my capabilities at the moment, despite all the research I've done in the last 2-3 weeks. Here is my jsfiddle on this so far: http://jsfiddle.net/mvkMH/23/ Here is what I'm trying to do: I have a <ul> with an id of #main containing <li>'s with a class of .box. When a user clicks on any .box it adds the .move-y class to ($this) - it also simultaneously adds the .move-x class to the remaining list items. When the user clicks another .box, all the existing .move-y and .move-x classes are replaced with .move-y-rvs and .move-x-rvs classes. All the while using CSS3 Animation events to keep everything perfectly synced up. Why CSS3 Animation Events? CSS3 Animations are fast on iOS CSS3 Animation triggered via jQuery allow you to 'restart' the animation if it has been played already (https://css-tricks.com/restart-css-animation/) In theory, by using jQuery to keep track of AnimationStart, AnimationIteration and AnimationEnd events one can create very complex and interactive CSS3 animations. Here is the way the script should work in my mind - i just couldn't get it to work in real life ;-) Upon clicking the .box element, Check #main for any .move-x and .move-y classes If .move-x and .move-y classes are detected: replace those classes with move-x-rvs and .move-y-rvs Attach css Animation Event listeners to the elements with .move-x-rvs and .move-y-rvs classes On AnimationEnd Event remove the .move-x-rvs and .move-y-rvs classes Set AnimationName to an empty string (this resets the css3 animation to play again if clicked again) Now add the .move-y class to $(this) Add the .move-x class to all the other remaining list items If .move-x and .move-y are not detected: Add the .move-y class to $(this) Add the .move-x class to all the other remaining list items 4 - The Animation Event listener functionality should append the prefixes for modern browsers (like in this example - How do I re-trigger a WebKit CSS animation via JavaScript?) Again, Here is my jsfiddle on this so far: http://jsfiddle.net/mvkMH/23/ Any help you folks could provide would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance! Bizarro.Z

 Now this output shows the differences in the two revisions, but not all the file's lines are there, it only shows the previous 3. So really my question is how do I get these lines in the output?? Is there some sort of svn diff config settings? I understand I can use external diff tools for svn, but which one gives me the output I would like? I want to try and avoid installing any diff tools as I'm on a corporate network. Additional point: So far 'sdiff' with its 2 columns generated seems to be the closest I can get to my answer, but I would ideally want a single columned file with '+' and '-' showing added/deleted lines Thanks in advance for any help! =)

@TITLE:Why does loading cached objects increase the memory consumption drastically when computing them will not?
@CONTENT:Relevant background info I've built a little software that can be customized via a config file. The config file is parsed and translated into a nested environment structure (e.g. .HIVE$db = an environment, .HIVE$db$user = "Horst", .HIVE$db$pw = "my password", .HIVE$regex$date = some regex for dates etc.) I've built routines that can handle those nested environments (e.g. look up value "db/user" or "regex/date", change it etc.). The thing is that the initial parsing of the config files takes a long time and results in quite a big of an object (actually three to four, between 4 and 16 MB). So I thought "No problem, let's just cache them by saving the object(s) to .Rdata files". This works, but "loading" cached objects makes my Rterm process go through the roof with respect to RAM consumption (over 1 GB!!) and I still don't really understand why (this doesn't happen when I "compute" the object all anew, but that's exactly what I'm trying to avoid since it takes too long). I already thought about maybe serializing it, but I haven't tested it as I would need to refactor my code a bit. Plus I'm not sure if it would affect the "loading back into R" part in just the same way as loading .Rdata files. Question Can anyone tell me why loading a previously computed object has such effects on memory consumption of my Rterm process (compared to computing it in every new process I start) and how best to avoid this? If desired, I will also try to come up with an example, but it's a bit tricky to reproduce my exact scenario. Yet I'll try.

@TITLE:Compiling a lambda expression results in delegate with Closure argument
@CONTENT:When I use Expression.Lambda( ... ).Compile() in order to create a delegate from an expression tree, the result is a delegate of which the first argument is Closure. public static Func<T, T, T> CreateTest<T>()
{
    ParameterExpression a = Expression.Parameter( typeof( T ) );
    ParameterExpression b = Expression.Parameter( typeof( T ) );

//     Int32,
//     Int32 )
Func<int, int, int> addition = DelegateHelper.CreateTest<int>();
int result = addition( 5, 5 );
 I can easily call the delegate through ordinary code without passing a Closure object, but where does this Closure come from? How can I call this delegate dynamically? // The following does not work.
// Exception: MethodInfo must be a runtime MethodInfo object.    
MethodInfo additionMethod = addition.Method;
int result = (int)additionMethod.Invoke( null, new object[] { 5, 5 } );
 Using expression trees it looks like I have to pass the Closure object. PropertyInfo methodProperty
    = typeof( Delegate ).GetProperty( "Method", typeof( MethodInfo ) );
MemberExpression getDelegateMethod
    = Expression.Property( Expression.Constant( addition ), methodProperty );
Func<MethodInfo> getMethodInfo

Expression call

        getMethodInfo(),

 This is a simplified example which doesn't make sense in its own right. What I am actually trying to achieve is to be able to wrap e.g. Func<Action<SomeObject>> with Func<Action<object>>. I can already do this for non nested delegates. This is useful during reflection, as discussed here. How should I correctly initialize this Closure object, or how do I prevent it from being there?

@LINK:/questions/7927903/how-to-run-initialization-code-for-a-palette
@TITLE:How to run initialization code for a palette?
@CONTENT:Occasionally it would be preferable to have some initialization code for palettes (of buttons). For example, it could define some functions that are used by palette buttons. What is the easiest and preferable way to define/run initialization code for a palette? The initialization can run either when the palette is loaded or when any button is pressed for the first time (possible issue: what if the kernel is restarted after the palette was loaded?) The definitions should be somehow localized (i.e. in their own context -- do unique notebook contexts help here?) If possible, I'd prefer a minimal effort solution (i.e. extra code at the fewest possible places, self contained palette file with no extra package files, palette creation using the existing convenience tools of palettes menu or CreatePalette, etc.) (You can assume that the initialization code runs fast, e.g. it consists of definitions only)

@TITLE:what is the difference between list<> and dictionary<> in c#
@CONTENT:I have a strange doubt regarding list and dictionary in c# In a list we add items to list by using the following method using System.Collections.Generic;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
       List<int> list = new List<int>();
       list.Add(2);
       list.Add(3);
       list.Add(5);
       list.Add(7);
    }
}
 In a dictionary we add items like this ... using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

class Program
{
   static void Main()
   {
      Dictionary<string, int> d = new Dictionary<string, int>();
      d.Add("cat", 2);
      d.Add("dog", 1);
      d.Add("llama", 0);
      d.Add("iguana", -1);
   }
}
 I don't know exactly what is the difference, but in a dictionary we add items like a (key,value) pair and in a list we just add items without specifying any key .. Would anyone clarify this?

@TITLE:Using a session cookie from selenium in urllib2
@CONTENT:I'm trying to use Selenium to log into a website and then use urllib2 to make RESTy requests. In order for it to work though, I need urllib2 to be able to use the same session Selenium used. The logging in with selenium worked great and I can call self.driver.get_cookies()
 and I have a list of all the cookies selenium knows about, and it ends up looking a little something like this: [{u'domain': u'my.awesome.web.app.local',
  u'expiry': 1319230106,
  u'name': u'ci_session',
  u'path': u'/',
  u'secure': False,
  u'value': u'9YEz6Qs9rNlONzXbZPZ5i9jm2Nn4HNrbaCJj2c%2B...'
}]
 I've tried a few different ways to to use the cooky in urllib2, I think this one looks the best: # self.driver is my selenium driver
all_cookies = self.driver.get_cookies()
cp = urllib2.HTTPCookieProcessor()
cj = cp.cookiejar
for s_cookie in all_cookies:
    cj.set_cookie(
        cookielib.Cookie(
            version=0
            , name=s_cookie['name']
            , value=s_cookie['value']
            , port='80'
            , port_specified=False
            , domain=s_cookie['domain']
            , domain_specified=True
            , domain_initial_dot=False
            , path=s_cookie['path']
            , path_specified=True

            , rfc2109=False
        )
    )
opener = urllib2.build_opener(cp)
response = opener.open(url_that_requires_a_logged_in_user)
response.geturl()
 It does not work though. That last call to response.geturl() returns the login page. Am I missing something? Any ideas for how should go about looking for the problem? Thanks.

To keep it simple, let's say there is an iphone versione and a desktop version.

@LINK:/questions/7849392/unable-to-append-vary-header-to-response
@TITLE:Unable to append 'Vary' header to response
@CONTENT:I'm trying to add a Vary: Accept-Encoding header to the response to files that I compress, as advised earlier. However, for some reason this is not possible - either from the Visual Studio test server, or an IIS server. I have the following code: if (url.Contains(".js") || url.Contains(".aspx") || url.Contains(".css"))
{
    app.Response.AppendHeader("Vary", "Accept-Encoding");
    app.Response.AppendHeader("Varye", "Accept-Encoding"); // for testing
    app.Response.AppendHeader("Varye", "Accept-Things");   // for testing
    app.Response.AppendHeader("Vary", "Accept-Stuff");     // for testing
    app.Response.AppendHeader("Var", "Accept-Items");      // for testing

    encodings = encodings.ToLower();

    if (encodings.Contains("gzip") || encodings == "*")
    {
        app.Response.Filter = new GZipStream(baseStream, CompressionMode.Compress);
        app.Response.AppendHeader("Content-Encoding", "gzip");

    }
}
 this results in the following response header: Status=OK - 200
Server=ASP.NET Development Server/10.0.0.0
Date=Fri, 21 Oct 2011 12:24:11 GMT
X-AspNet-Version=4.0.30319
Varye=Accept-Encoding, Accept-Things
Var=Accept-Items
Content-Encoding=gzip
Cache-Control=public
Etag="1CC8F2E9D772300"
Content-Type=text/css
Content-Length=16200
Connection=Close
 As you can see, the Vary header is not present. Meaningless headers with similar syntax are present, so there must be something, somewhere, taking out the Vary header before it is sent. I don't know if it is relevant, but here is where I define my compression module in web.config: <httpModules>
    <add name="CompressionModule" type="Utility.HttpCompressionModule"/>
</httpModules>
 (Where Utility.HttpCompressionModule is the class which the code excerpt I provided above belongs to.) Why is it that I can't add the Vary header? EDIT: Eric C's solution has left me with code like this: if (url.Contains(".js") || url.Contains(".aspx") || url.Contains(".css"))
{
    app.Response.Cache.SetVaryByCustom("Accept-Encoding");

    encodings = encodings.ToLower();

    if (encodings.Contains("gzip") || encodings == "*")
    {
        app.Response.Filter = new GZipStream(baseStream, CompressionMode.Compress);
        app.Response.AppendHeader("Content-Encoding", "gzip");

    }
 But, the headers look like this: Status=OK - 200
Server=ASP.NET Development Server/10.0.0.0
Date=Mon, 24 Oct 2011 09:26:37 GMT
Content-Encoding=gzip
Cache-Control=public
Etag="1CC7A09FDE77300"
Vary=*
Content-Type=application/x-javascript
Content-Length=44447
Connection=Close
 (No idea why this is application/x-javascript as its set in the HTML as text/javascript, but this is irrelevant.) As you can see, I now have a vary header, but it is set as Vary=* rather than Vary=Accept-Encoding, as you would expect from my code in the compression module. What is going on here? How do I get the Vary header set correctly? Second Edit: I'm going to paste the source code for the whole class. There isn't much more to it than I have already posted, but it might help to give a grasp of exactly what I'm doing: public class HttpCompressionModule : IHttpModule

@LINK:/questions/7840073/correcting-summary-in-r-with-appropriate-of-digits-of-precision
@TITLE:Correcting summary in R with appropriate # of digits of precision
@CONTENT:A simple question on a simple seemingly innocent function: summary. Until I saw results for Min and Max that were outside the range of my data, I was unaware that summary has a digits argument to specify precision of the output results. My question is about how to address this in a clean, universal manner. Here is an example of the issue: set.seed(0)
vals    <- 1 + 10 * 1:50000
df      <- cbind(rnorm(10000),sample(vals, 10000), runif(10000))
 Applying summary and range, we get the following output - notice the discrepancy in the range values versus the Min and Max:     > apply(df, 2, summary)

                [,1]   [,2]      [,3]
    Min.    -3.703000     11 6.791e-05

    3rd Qu.  0.688800 374000 7.502e-01
    Max.     3.568000 499900 9.999e-01

    >     apply(df, 2, range)
            [,1]   [,2]         [,3]
    [1,] -3.703236     11 6.790622e-05
    [2,]  3.568101 499931 9.998686e-01
 Seeing erroneous ranges in summary is a little disconcerting, so I looked at the digits option, but this is simply the standard notation for formatting output. Also note: Every single quantile other than Min shows a value that does not exist in the data set (this is why I put a 1 + in the definition for vals), nor would one see these quantiles in most standard quantile calculations, even allowing for differences in midpoint selection. (When I saw this in the original data, I wondered how I had lost a value of 1 from everything!) There is a difference between explicable computational behavior (i.e. formatting and precision) and statistically-motivated expecations (such values identified as quantiles actually being within the range of the dataset). Since we can't change the expectations, we need to change the behavior of the code or at least improve it. The question: Is there some more appropriate way to set the output to be sure of the range, other than setting it to a large value, e.g. digits = 16? Is 16 even the most appropriate universal default? Using 16 digits seems to be the best guarantee of precision for double floats, though it seems the output will not actually have 16 digits (the output still seems to be truncated to 8 or 9 digits). Update 1: As @BrianDiggs has noted, via the links, the behavior is documented, but unexpected. To clarify my issue, relative to the answers on the link provided by Brian (excepting the answer by Brian himself): it's not that the behavior is undocumented, but it's flatly wrong to denote as Min and Max values which are not Min and Max. A documented function that gives incorrect output in its default settings needs to be used with non-default settings (or should not be used). (Maybe one could argue whether "Min" and "Max" should be renamed as "Approximate Min" and "Approximate Max", but let's not go there.) Update 2: As @Dwin has noted, summary() takes as its default max(3, getOption("digits") - 3). I'd previously erred in saying the default was 3. What's interesting about this is that this implies two ways to set the behavior of the output. If we use both, the behavior gets weird: > options(digits = 20)
> apply(df, 2, summary, digits = 10)

 Notice that this now has 20 digits of output, even though the argument passed specifies 10 digits of precision. If we set the global option for digits to be some "sane" value like 16, we still end up with issues if we provide summary with an argument of 10. I believe the documentation is incomplete, and Brian Diggs has pointed out other issues with it in his thoughtful answer in the link to R-help. Despite these wrinkles, the question remains open, but maybe it can't be answered. I suspect that the best result is simply to leave the global digits option as-is (though I am a little disturbed by the implications of the above behavior) and instead pass a value of 16 to summary. It isn't immediately obvious where the output precision is specified, but this interaction of 4 values - the global option (and the global option - 3), the passed value, and a hard-coded value of 12 in summary.data.frame looks like (have meRcy on my soul for saying this) a hack. Update 3: I'm accepting DWin's answer - it led to me understanding how this sausage is made. Seeing what is going on, I don't think there's a way to do what I ask, without rewriting summary.

@TITLE:Mocking file uploads in Rails 3.1 controller tests
@CONTENT:My controller accesses the tempfile attribute of an uploaded file and passes it to another mocked component. My test code has   @file = mock(Object)
  @file.stub_chain(:tempfile, :path).and_return('thefile.zip')
  # ...
  post :create, :file => @file
 and the controller code calls params[:file].tempfile.path. After upgrading from Rails 3.0 to 3.1, the above line started failing with undefined method `tempfile' for "#[RSpec::Mocks::Mock:0x2b0d9a0 @name=Object]":String
 That is, Rails 3.1 converted params[:file] to a string automatically. The code works properly when tested manually through a browser. I tried to use fixture_file_upload and the parameter became a File object but it had no tempfile method. So how do I pass an arbitrary mock object as a parameter to an action in Rails 3.1?
@CODE:tempfile @file = mock(Object)

@TITLE:Can you avoid using temporary buffers when using std::string to interact with C style APIs?
@CONTENT:I should preface this question by saying I think the answer is probably no, but I'd like to see what other people think about the issue. I spend most of my time writing C++ that interacts with the Win32 API which like most C style APIs wants to either: Take buffers which I've provided and operate on them. Or return pointers to buffers which I need to later free. Both of these scenarios essentially mean that if you want to use std::string in your code you've got to accept the fact that you're going to be doing a lot of string copying every time you construct a std::string from a temporary buffer. What would be nice would be: To be able to allow C style APIs to safely directly mutate a std::string and pre-reserve its allocation and set its size in advance (to mitigate scenario 1) To be able to wrap a std::string around an existing char[] (to mitigate scenario 2) Is there a nice way to do either of these, or should I just accept that there's an inherent cost in using std::string with old school APIs? It looks like scenario 1 would be particularly tricky because std::string has a short string optimisation whereby its buffer could either be on the stack or the heap depending on its size.

@TITLE:Why is there no tail() and head() method in the java list
@CONTENT:I recently had a discussion with a collegue why the List interface in Java doesn't have a head() and tail() method. In order to implement such a functionality would have to write a wrapper that looked something like this: public E head() {
 if (underlyingList == null || underlyingList.isEmpty())
  return null;

 return underlyingList.get(0);
}


public E tail() {
 if (underlyingList == null || underlyingList.isEmpty())
  return null;

 return underlyingList.get(underlyingList.size()-1);
}
 I'm not aware of all List implementations but I assume that at least in LinkedList and ArrayList it should be pretty trival to get the last and first element (constant time). So the question is: Is there a specific reason why it is not a good idea to provide a tail method to any List implementation?
@CODE:head() tail() public E head() {
 if (underlyingList == null || underlyingList.isEmpty())
  return null;

 return underlyingList.get(0);
}


public E tail() {

@CONTENT:I've observed this on iOS 4.3 to 5.0. When you create a even a simple offline web app, meaning one HTML file + few assets such as CSS and JS (all present in the cache manifest), it works offline (I tested in Airplane Mode) V BUT, when you add such an app to your home screen and open it in fullscreen mode, it first displays initial content, then everything disappears (page becomes white) for half a second or more, then content reappears again. You can see this by adding Glyphboard, a well-known and useful offline web app, to your iOS home screen and launching it a few times. You should see the white flash effect every time you load it. This is a big problem because it gives away the non-nativeness of an app and gives the impression that the app is non-optimized for performance and buggy. I've tried finding reports about this but all I can find is rumors and misconceptions about the iOS 4.3 JavaScript rendering engine fiasco, which doesn't need at all be related to this issue. But in iOS version 3 I distincly remember not ever seeing the white flash.
