@TITLE:Is the IShellItemImageFactory interface, used for getting Vista/7 shell thumbnails, broken?
@CONTENT:I want to use IShellItemImageFactory to retrieve the shell thumbnail of files. According to the MSDN docs, if I pass in a SIZE struct of 256x256, it should populate the HBITMAP parameter with a 256x256 bitmap, and if I use the SIIGBF_RESIZETOFIT flag, it should resize smaller thumbnails to 256x256. It doesn't. Instead, the result is a 256x256 bitmap with a small icon drawn in the middle. Okay, maybe that's just not what SIIGBF_RESIZETOFIT is supposed to do. But then, as I understand it, I should be able to use SIIGBF_BIGGERSIZEOK and specify a tiny size (say 1x1) and it should return the actual thumbnail size instead. It doesn't. I always get whatever size I pass in. Am I using this API incorrectly, or is it just broken? There seem to be very few examples on the web. A few discussion posts have people suggesting the API is broken. If it is indeed broken, how can I determine if a given shell item has a thumbnail? That way, I can use this method to get thumbnails and extract the icon otherwise.

@TITLE:How to make the height REALLY 100%
@CONTENT:in CSS when you set something's width or height to 100% it really only sets it to 100% of the browser window. Is there any way to make it 100% of the whole page? Let me rephrase: I want this element (a div) to take up the ENTIRE page, no matter how much you scroll. Having parent elements with 100% size and 100% width doesn't work because they are treated the same way. I'm beginning to think that I might have to use JS to get the height of the page and then absolutely define that.

@TITLE:Checking whether SendAsync has finished sending
@CONTENT:As in the simplified code below, is checking that SendAsync() has finished transmitting all intended bytes in the buffer the correct thing to do? Or is that redundant? This is for a TCP connection socket. I am particularly concerned with having to issue a second sub-call to SendAsync() inside ProcessSend(). For example, if I had multiple threads transmitting data to a client using a new (pooled) SocketAsyncEventArg for each message, isn't it possible that a simultaneous send might interject itself in-between a partially transmitted message? Or is this a good reason for controlled access to the client by only allowing one SocketAsyncEventArg to be used in data sending? private void ProcessSend(SocketAsyncEventArgs e)
{
    // Check that data was sent
    if ((e.SocketError == SocketError.Success) && (e.BytesTransferred > 0))
    {
        AsyncSendUserToken token = (AsyncSendUserToken)e.UserToken;

        // Check that all the data was sent

@LINK:/questions/1935841/non-modal-windows-memory-management
@TITLE:Non-modal windows memory management
@CONTENT:I'm a newbie in Mac Dev. I come from iPhone dev. My question relates to non-modal windows management. It's quite different from the iPhone and it's memory management model. Say for example, i have a preference window, i can use something like that to show the window: -(IBAction)showPreferenceController:(id)sender {
  if (!preferenceController) {
  preferenceController = [[PreferenceController alloc]init];
  }
  [preferenceController showWindow:preferenceController]; 
}
 But with this code, the window will stay in memory during app life because the window is never released. To avoid that, I could also use the method described here : stackoverflow.com/questions/1391260/who-owns-an-nswindowcontroller-in-standard-practice Create in PreferenceController a + (id) sharedInstance and release the window using (void)windowWillClose:(NSNotification *)notification I see many cocoa code samples where non-modal windows are never released. For example here : http://www.mattballdesign.com/blog/2008/10/01/building-a-preferences-window/ : The preference panel and all the subviews are created in awakeFromNib and so will live in memory during all app life. If you take for example Xcode app, there are a lot of non-modal windows : - Global Find window (CMD+MAJ+F) - App Info Panel - Help Window - ... I suppose that these windows are released when they are closed to keep memory as low as possible. I would like some advices to know the best way to manage non-modal windows in a cocoa app. Keep in memory? Releasing asap? I know a mac has a lot of memory compared to an iPhone but I also think it's not good to keep in memory objects we are not using. Thanks. Edited with Rob post : I send -autorelease to the window and set my pointer to nil so I'll recreate the window later. This is similar to the technique you cite, though whether or not to use +sharedController for the Controller isn't related; you can do this whether you have a shared controller or not. I don't how to do that without a singleton (+sharedController). I explain what I mean with this example: In the app Controller : @interface AppController : NSObject <NSApplicationDelegate> {
 Implementation : -(IBAction)showPreferenceController:(id)sender {  
  if (!preferenceController) {
    preferenceController = [[PreferenceController alloc]init];
  }
  [preferenceController showWindow:preferenceController];
}
 In the preferences controller : @interface PreferenceController : NSWindowController <NSWindowDelegate>
 Implementation : - (void)windowWillClose:(NSNotification *)notification {
  [self autorelease];self=nil;
}
 It will crash when i close and reopen after the window : preferenceController is released but not equal to nil. So I need to set preferenceController to nil when the window is closed. There is no problem to do that with a singleton. Without singleton, I should set appController as the delegate of Preference Window to be able to set preferenceController to nil when the window is closed. But i don't like that way. Edited with Preston comments I didn't say it but I want only one instance of my non-modal window even if we call -(IBAction)showPreferenceController:(id)sender several times. That's why I test if preferenceController is equal to nil or not in appController. So, I need to set preferenceController to nil in appController if we close the window. So the solution would be : In AppController, listening NSWindowWillCloseNotification: - (void)windowWillClose:(NSNotification *)notification {
    if ([notification object] == [preferenceController window]) {
        [preferenceController autorelease];
        preferenceController = nil;
    }
}
 Is it correct? Is this the only one solution? because it seems a little bit complicated just to manage my non modal window...
@CODE:-(IBAction)showPreferenceController:(id)sender {
  if (!preferenceController) {
  preferenceController = [[PreferenceController alloc]init];
  }
  [preferenceController showWindow:preferenceController]; 
} PreferenceController + (id) sharedInstance (void)windowWillClose:(NSNotification *)notification awakeFromNib @interface AppController : NSObject <NSApplicationDelegate> { -(IBAction)showPreferenceController:(id)sender {  
  if (!preferenceController) {
    preferenceController = [[PreferenceController alloc]init];
  }
  [preferenceController showWindow:preferenceController];
} @interface PreferenceController : NSWindowController <NSWindowDelegate> - (void)windowWillClose:(NSNotification *)notification {
  [self autorelease];self=nil;
} -(IBAction)showPreferenceController:(id)sender - (void)windowWillClose:(NSNotification *)notification {
    if ([notification object] == [preferenceController window]) {
        [preferenceController autorelease];
        preferenceController = nil;
    }

@TITLE:How can I check if a string can be converted to a float?
@CONTENT:First my context is that of a compiler writer who needs to convert floating point literals (strings) into float/double values. I haven't done any floating point programming the last 15 years so i'm pretty sure this is a total stupid newbie question. double res; 
errno=0; 
*res = strtod((const char*)literal,NULL); 
if (errno==ERANGE) throw_a_literal_out_of_range_exception();
return res;
 but there is no "strtof" function in the c runtime library? EDIT: To clarify. I already know that the string 'literal' is a valid pattern for a C floating point. It already passed a regular expression test. I just want to check if there is a range/precision problem. The reason is in Eiffel source code a user can write a := {REAL_32} 3.1415
b := {REAL_32} 3.0E200
 To cast a written floating point number explit to a 32bit floating point. I think in the second case the compiler should detect that the value is out of range and raise an error or at least a warning.
@CODE:double res; 
errno=0; 
*res = strtod((const char*)literal,NULL);

@CONTENT:It looks like there's an issue in MVC 2 RC1 if you want to use jQuery.Validate but not the main Microsoft AJAX - which is 25kb even when gzipped.

   <script src="/Scripts/jquery.validate.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
   <script src="/Scripts/MicrosoftMvcJQueryValidation.js" type="text/javascript">
 Unfortunately in some reorganization they did between Beta and RC - you also now need to include MicrosoftAjax.js which defines the Type prototype functions that are used by MicrosoftMvcJQueryValidation.js (the first line is Type.registerNamespace('Sys.Mvc'); which is defined in MicrosoftAjax.js) Has anyone already extracted out the necessary code from MicrosoftAjax.js that is needed? I'll have to do it sooner or later but if anyone has already done it that would help a lot!

@LINK:/questions/1933929/how-do-you-setup-post-revisions-history-tracking-with-orm
@TITLE:How do you setup Post Revisions/History Tracking with ORM?
@CONTENT:I am trying to figure out how to setup a revisions system for posts and other content. I figured that would mean it would need to work with a basic belongs_to/has_one/has_many/has_many_though ORM (any good ORM should support this). I was thinking a that I could have some tables like (with matching models) [[POST]] (has_many (text) through (revisions)
id
title

[[Revisions]] (belongs_to posts/text)
id
post_id
text_id
date

[[TEXT]]
id
body
user_id
 Where I could join THROUGH the revisions table to get the latest TEXT body. But I'm kind of foggy on how it will all work. Has anyone setup something like this? Basically, I need to be able to load an article and request the latest content entry. // Get the post row
$post = new Model_Post($id);
// Get the latest revision (JOIN through revisions to TEXT) and print that body.
$post->text->body;
 Having the ability to shuffle back in time to previous revisions and removing revisions would also be a big help. At any rate, these are just ideas of how I think that some kind of history tracking would work. I'm open to any form of tracking I just want to know what the best-practice is. :EDIT: It seems that moving forward, two tables seems to make the most sense. Since I plan to store two copies of text this will also help to save space. The first table posts will store the data of the current revision for fast reads without any joins. The posts body will be the value of the matching revision's text field - but processed through markdown/bbcode/tidy/etc. This will allow me to retain the original text (for the next edit) without having to store that text twice in one revision row (or having to re-parse it each time I display it). So fetching will be be ORM friendly. Then for creates/updates I will have to handle revisions separately and then just update the post object with the new current revision values.

@TITLE:Using Maven to run a WAR dynamically in Tomcat, how does one add classpath entries so only Tomcat sees them?
@CONTENT:Scenario is such: I have a webapp that I'd like to run dynamically with the tomcat-maven-plugin's tomcat:run goal. The wrinkle is that I have numerous classpath resources that need to differ between the packaged artifact and the one run off a local workstation. Failed Attempts: 1.) My first attempt was to use the builder-helper-maven-plugin, but it won't work because the target configuration files will (inconsistently!) work their way into the packaged WAR archive. <plugin>

 </executions>

 2.) My second attempt was to add the folder (since the files-to-be-deployed aren't present in Tomcat's classpath yet either) to -Djava.ext.dirs, but it has no effect (I actually suspect that this systemProperties element is misconfigured or otherwise not working at all). See: <plugin>
 <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>

 I'm not sure what to attempt next. The heart of the problem seems to be that missing in this plugin is something like Surefire's <additionalClasspathElement> element. Would the next step be to create a custom catalina.properties and add it to a <configurationDir>? If so, what would catalina.properties need to look like? Edit: More thorough explanation follows I understand this question reads somewhat vaguely, so I'll try to elaborate a bit. My POM uses the webResources functionality of the WAR plugin to copy some environment-specific config files and without using a profile to do it, by copying in a resource named /src/main/resources-env/${env} like so: ...
<plugin>    
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-war-plugin</artifactId>
		...
    <configuration>
			...
    	<webResources>
    		<!-- Copy Environment-specific resources to classes -->
    		<resource>
    			<directory>${basedir}/src/main/resources-env/${env}</directory>
    			<targetPath>WEB-INF/classes</targetPath>
    		</resource>
    	</webResources>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
 This will copy the (default, DEV) environment resources into the package and currently works fine. Note also that b/c these occur as part of packaging, the tomcat:run goal is never privy to them (which is desired, as the environments differ). So the problem is this: when the dynamic tomcat:run is executed, the application will fail because its classpath (it looks at target/classes) will lack the needed local workstation environmental config files. All I need to do is get those on the path for tomcat, but would like to do so without adding anything to the command line and definitely without breaking the build's integrity if someone follows up with a mvn package and doesn't clean first. I hope this is more clear.

@TITLE:Unit Testing Entity Framework ObjectContext in ASP.NET Application
@CONTENT:I am creating the Entity Framework ObjectContext per ASP.NET Request using the following code:  public static class ObjectContextPerRequest
    {
        public static EStudyTestDatabaseEntities Context
        {
            get
            {
                var _context = HttpContext.Current.Items["EStudyModel"] as EStudyTestDatabaseEntities; 

                if(_context == null)
                {
                    _context = new EStudyTestDatabaseEntities(); 
                    HttpContext.Current.Items.Add("EStudyModel", _context);
                }

                return _context; 
            }
        }

        public static void RemoveContext()
        {
            var _context = HttpContext.Current.Items["EStudyModel"] as EStudyTestDatabaseEntities; 

            if(_context != null)
            {
                _context.Dispose();
            }
        }
    }
 In the Repository I use it like this: public class RoleRepository : IRoleRepository
    {
        public IList<Role> GetAll()
        {
            using(var db = ObjectContextPerRequest.Context)
            {
                return db.RoleSet.ToList(); 
            }
        }
    }
 This works fine if I run the application. The problem is how I will unit test the Repository because I need to create a HttpContext.   [TestFixture]
    public class when_getting_all_roles
    {
        [Test]
        public void should_get_roles_successfully()
        {
            var repository = new RoleRepository();
            Assert.AreNotEqual(4,repository.GetAll()); 
        }
    }
 UPDATE: I can make IObjectContextPerRequest interface and ObjectContextPerRequest as shown below:  public interface IObjectContextPerRequest
    {
        EStudyTestDatabaseEntities Context { get; }
        void RemoveContext(); 
    }
 And now I can write my test as follows: [TestFixture]
    public class when_getting_all_roles
    {
        [Test]
        public void should_get_roles_successfully()
        {
            var objectContextPerRequestStub = MockRepository.GenerateStub<IObjectContextPerRequest>();

            objectContextPerRequestStub.Expect(x => x.Context).Return(new EStudyTestDatabaseEntities()); 

            var repository = new RoleRepository(objectContextPerRequestStub);
            Assert.AreNotEqual(4,repository.GetAll()); 

        }
    }
@CODE:public static class ObjectContextPerRequest
    {
        public static EStudyTestDatabaseEntities Context

                {

                    HttpContext.Current.Items.Add("EStudyModel", _context);
                }

                return _context;

@TITLE:using glob to return a list of folders in a given directory (without paths)
@CONTENT:The function below returns all folders in a given directory down to multiple levels. I only need one level depth though, just folders in the target directory, no subfolders. Also the function returns the full path to the folder, I only want the folder name. I'm sure I'm missing something simple. How can I modify the function to return only the folder names of the given directory? (not the full paths to each folder) $myArray = get_dirs('../wp-content/themes/mytheme/images'); <?php
  function get_dirs( $path = '.' ){
	return glob( 
	  '{' . 
		$path . '/*,'    . # Current Dir
		$path . '/*/*,'  . # One Level Down
		$path . '/*/*/*' . # Two Levels Down, etc.
	  '}', GLOB_BRACE + GLOB_ONLYDIR );

 btw, thanks to Doug for the original function help!

@TITLE:Value of dojox.CheckedMultiSelect not being posted with dojo.xhrPost
@CONTENT:When I post a form using dojo.xhrPost, I get all the fields in my form POSTed except for the value of my dojox.CheckedMultiSelect, no matter what options are selected. The declaration of my CheckedMultiSelect: <div dojoType="dojo.data.ItemFileReadStore" jsId="processTypeList" url="json/processtypelist.json.php"></div>
<label for="processTypeSelect">Process Types</label>
<select dojoType="dojox.form.CheckedMultiSelect" name="processTypeSelect" id="processTypeSelect" multiple="true" style="height:166px;" store="processTypeList"></select>
 And here is my xhrPost: <button dojoType="dojox.form.BusyButton" id="logSearchSubmit" busyLabel="Searching..." timeout="5" 
  onclick="dojo.xhrPost({
    url: 'handlers/logsearch.php',
    form: dojo.byId('formSearch'),
    handleAs: 'json'
});">Search</button>
 And here is what I get POSTed: endDate 2009-12-15
postAction  search
processSelect   
searchAttribute none
searchAttributeValue

 Any reason why the dojox control value doesn't get posted, though all the values of the dijit controls that are part of my form get posted? The control is right in between the other ones who's values get POSTed, so I know it is within the form. I just added another button to perform console.log(formSearch.getValues()) instead of the xhrPost and I get the value of the control logged into the console. So obviously dojo is aware of it, but when I do a console.log(dojo.formToJson("formSearch")) I get all the form data except for the the dojox control again.

 It was great until I have introduced new order types (controlled by OrderInfo.Type property). You can think of new order type as derived from general order (in terms of behaviour). Each new order has some additional properties. What is the best approach to implement this polymorphic behaviour of Order? Currently I simply add new properties to OrderInfo class while adding new orders. [DataContract]
class OrderInfo
{
 [DataMember]
 OrderType Type;
 // general order data

 // First custom order data
 // Second custom order data
 // TODO - add new properties for new orders
}
 I don't like it much cause it too straight. What if I change [DataContract] and the client is not rebuilt? What are my alternatives? I can of course implement inheritance and derive new [DataContract] class like MyCustomOrder1, but inheritance is not supported by serialization, I need to use [KnownTypes] which is forbidden due to some reasons.

@TITLE:How to make the main thread wait for the other threads to complete in ThreadPoolExecutor
@CONTENT:I am using the ThreadPoolExecutor to implement threading in my Java Application. I have a XML which I need to parse and add each node of it to a thread to execute the completion. My implementation is like this: parse_tp is a threadpool object created & ParseQuotesXML is the class with the run method.         try {     
           List children = root.getChildren();               
        Iterator iter = children.iterator();

           ParseQuotesXML quote = new ParseQuotesXML(child, this);         
           parse_tp.execute(quote);         
        }
    System.out.println("Print it after all the threads have completed");
        catch(Exception ex) {  
        ex.printStackTrace();      
        }
        finally {  
    System.out.println("Print it in the end.");
if(!parse_tp.isShutdown()) {
                if(parse_tp.getActiveCount() == 0 && parse_tp.getQueue().size() == 0 ) {
                    parse_tp.shutdown();                    
                } else {
                    try {
                        parse_tp.awaitTermination(30, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
                    } catch (InterruptedException ex) {
                        log.info("Exception while terminating the threadpool "+ex.getMessage());

                }
            }
          parse_tp.shutdown();  
        }
 The problem is, the two print out statements are printed before the other threads exit. I want to make the main thread wait for all other threads to complete. In normal Thread implementation I can do it using join() function but not getting a way to achieve the same in ThreadPool Executor. Also would like to ask if the code written in finally block to close the threadpool proper ? Thanks, Amit

 User is a join table, which SpecialUser joins against to get things like status.

Is there a way to explicitly tell NHibernate which table to get the Status column in the DirectoryMapping?

@TITLE:How can I install the BlackBerry v5.0.0 component pack into Eclipse?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to install the latest v5.0.0 "beta 2" BlackBerry OS Component Pack into Eclipse 3.4.2 with BlackBerry Eclipse plugin v1.0.0.67, but have hit a few problems. Has anybody found an easy way to do this? I had no trouble installing the v4.5.0 and v4.7.0 Component Packs. It's rather strange that BlackBerry are shipping new phones with the v5.0.0 OS installed (e.g. a Storm 2 9550 and Bold 9700 that I just bought), and pushing that update to phones whilst the BlackBerry website still considers the v5.0.0 SDK / Component Packs to be "beta 2"! If anybody knows when an official non-beta Component Pack is going to be released that might solve my problem... In case it helps, the problems I've hit so far are: -Contrary to the implication on the BlackBerry website, the Eclipse "Software Update..." option for the v5.0.0 Component Pack claims it only works on the v1.0.0 Eclipse BlackBerry plugin, not the new v1.1 one. -I then tried to install the v5.0.0 Component Pack through the "Software Updates..." menu in Eclipse using the v1.0.0 Eclipse BlackBery plugin. Once I'd done the 200MB download the install failed with a "Invalid zip file format" error. -I might just have been unlucky with a corrupted download but I did try it twice, once through "Software Updates..." and once by selecting "Archive" to install the downloaded Component Pack (which unlike v4.5.0 and v4.7.0 was a JAR, not a ZIP).

 As, you can see the user and the role are using different context which you have already pointed out. The problem with using single datacontext is that I cannot layer the application properly.

 Lathe depends on an interface called Material, so I can easily unit test Lathe by giving it a fake Material in my unit test. Wood doesn't depend on anything, so it can also be easily tested. interface Material {

interface Tool {

class Wood implements Material	{
    // Implementations of Material methods
}

class Lathe {
	function Apply(Material $m) {

}
 However, Carpenter depends on the concrete classes Lathe and Wood because it has to create instances of them. That means that as it currently stands, I cannot unit test the Work() method without inadvertantly bringing Lathe and Wood under test. How should I change my design to unit test Carpenter?

@TITLE:How do I CheckOnClick in a CheckedListbox but only when over the checkbox?
@CONTENT:I have a CheckedListBox. I would like to be able to select items when I click on the text but check/uncheck them when I click on the checkbox area on the left. If I set CheckOnClick then the items are checked and unchecked whenever I click, even on the text, so that's no good. But if I clear CheckOnClick then I have to click twice to check and uncheck. My first thought is to handle MouseClick or MouseDown events and call IndexFromPoint to find out which row is clicked. Then I would just guess that the checkbox is on the left, from x=position from 0 to, say, ItemRectangle.Height. Depending on the distance from the left, I could select or check/uncheck. The question is whether there is a better way to determine if the mouse is over the checkbox or over the text. Different styles could have different sized checkboxes and might put them on the left, right, etc...

@TITLE:Group events by temporal distance in SQL
@CONTENT:In general, I need to associate (group) records which are created in similar time periods. If it helps, thinking of the example below as clickstream data where there is no sessionID and I need to build those sessions. I have the following dataset: UserId INT,
EventId INT,
DateCreated DATETIME,
BlockId INT
 Assume the following data: {123, 111, '2009-12-01 9:15am', NULL}
{123, 222, '2009-12-01 9:20am', NULL}

{123, 555, '2009-12-03 2:32pm', NULL}
 What I need to do is divide these events up, by user, into temporal buckets. There is a business rule that says anything > 30 minutes should be a new bucket. In the above example, events 111-333 represent a block, i.e. not more than 30 minutes separates them. Likewise, events 444-555 represent a second block. My current solution uses a cursor and is extremely slow (therefore, unsustainable for the amount of data I need to process). I can post the code but it is pretty simple. Any ideas?

What is the best approach to design this module in terms of database. Does it need to have a seperate table for each activity(say photos). Or a single table is enough. And, what is the best logic. One option is whenever a user performs an action, that activity can be inserted into table with all the friend ids, i.e. if he has 50 friends, 50 records. In this way no php script is needed, just scan the table when user login. Second option is whenever a user login, scan his friends, store in an array & scan the notification table for every friend whether the friend has done any activities. Thanks in advance, Hari

@LINK:/questions/1870705/objc-delegate-methods-never-gets-called
@TITLE:ObjC delegate methods never gets called
@CONTENT:I am creating instances of a class FlickrImage parsing a Flickr API photos response. The class has a method getLocation that does another API call to get the geolocation: NSLog(@"getting location for %i",self.ID);
NSAutoreleasePool *pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];
OFFlickrAPIRequest *flickrAPIRequest = [[OFFlickrAPIRequest alloc] initWithAPIContext[appDelegate sharedDelegate].flickrAPIContext];
[flickrAPIRequest setDelegate:self];

NSString *flickrAPIMethodToCall = @"flickr.photos.geo.getLocation";
NSDictionary *requestArguments = [[NSDictionary alloc] initWithObjectsAndKeys:FLICKR_API_KEY,@"api_key",self.ID,@"photo_id",nil];

[flickrAPIRequest callAPIMethodWithGET:flickrAPIMethodToCall arguments:requestArguments];
[pool release];
 I have implemented the callback method that would catch the response from the API and update the FlickrImage instance with the geolocation data - but it never gets called. Here's where the instances get created: NSDictionary *photosDictionary = [inResponseDictionary valueForKeyPath:@"photos.photo"];
NSDictionary *photoDictionary;
FlickrImage *flickrImage;
for (photoDictionary in photosDictionary) {
	flickrImage = [[FlickrImage alloc] init];
	flickrImage.thumbnailURL = [[appDelegate sharedDelegate].flickrAPIContext photoSourceURLFromDictionary:photoDictionary size:OFFlickrThumbnailSize];
	flickrImage.hasLocation = TRUE; // TODO this is actually to be determined...
	flickrImage.ID = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@",[photoDictionary valueForKeyPath:@"id"]];
	flickrImage.owner = [photoDictionary valueForKeyPath:@"owner"];
	flickrImage.title = [photoDictionary valueForKeyPath:@"title"];
	[self.flickrImages addObject:[flickrImage retain]];
	[flickrImage release];
	[photoDictionary release];
}
 The retain is there because I thought it might help solve this but it doesn't - and doesn't the NSMutableArray (flickrImages is a NSMutableArray) retain its members anyway? EDIT I should add that the getLocation method (first code snippet) is launched in a thread: [NSThread detachNewThreadSelector:@selector(getLocation) toTarget:self withObject:nil];
@CODE:NSLog(@"getting location for %i",self.ID);
NSAutoreleasePool *pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];
OFFlickrAPIRequest *flickrAPIRequest = [[OFFlickrAPIRequest alloc] initWithAPIContext[appDelegate sharedDelegate].flickrAPIContext];
[flickrAPIRequest setDelegate:self];

NSString *flickrAPIMethodToCall = @"flickr.photos.geo.getLocation";
NSDictionary *requestArguments = [[NSDictionary alloc] initWithObjectsAndKeys:FLICKR_API_KEY,@"api_key",self.ID,@"photo_id",nil];

[flickrAPIRequest callAPIMethodWithGET:flickrAPIMethodToCall arguments:requestArguments];

@TITLE:iPhone + UIView. Enormous memory consumption during drawRect. Any strategies for reducing this?
@CONTENT:My data visualization app incurs a large memory consumption spike during redraw (setNeedsDisplay which triggers drawRect). I am currently redrawing the entire view that houses the data plot. This view is much larger then the device display. Is there any way to tell CoreGraphics to allocate just enough memory to draw each element (each element is a small rectangular block much smaller then the device display) and release the memory when done, rather then my current naive approach? Thanks in advance. -Doug UPDATE 8 Dec 8:28am EST Here is the relevant code with explanatory wordage. I am running Instruments with ObjectAlloc, Memory Monitor, and Leaks instruments running. The only memory leak I have is due has to do with the NSOperationQueue not releasing mems. This is minor an not relevant. Architecturally the app consists of a tableView with a list of interesting locations along the human genome to inspect. When a table row is selected I enqueue a data gathering operation that returns data called alignmentData. This data is then plotted as horizontal rectangular slabs. Initially, when the tableView launches my memory footprint is 5 MB. - (void)viewWillAppear:(BOOL)animated {

    // Initial dimensions for the alignment view are set here. These
    // dimensions were roughed out in IB.

    frame                       = self.alignmentView.frame;
    frame.origin.x              = 0.0;
    frame.origin.y              = 0.0;  
    frame.size.width            = self.scrollView.contentSize.width;    
    frame.size.height           = 2.0 * (self.containerView.frame.size.height);

}
 Note: After viewWillAppear: is called the memory footprint has not budged. Even though the alignmentView is be sized well beyond the dimensions of the display. This is the method called from the data gathering operation. - (void)didFinishRetrievingAlignmentData:(NSDictionary *)results {

        // Data retrieved from the data server via the data gathering operation
    NSMutableData *alignmentData = [[results objectForKey:@"alignmentData"] retain];

    NSMutableArray *alignments = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];
    while (offset < [alignmentData length]) {

        // ...
        // Ingest alignmentData in alignments array 
        // ...  

    } // while (offset < [alignmentData length])    
    [alignmentData release];

    // Take the array of alignment objects and position them in screen space 
        // so that they pack densely creating horizontal rows of alignment objects 
        // in the process.
    self.alignmentView.packedAlignmentRows = 
    [Alignment packAlignments:alignments basepairStart:self.startBasepairValue basepairEnd:self.endBasepairValue];  
    [alignments release];

    [self.alignmentView setNeedsDisplay];

}
 After this line of code: self.alignmentView.packedAlignmentRows = ...
 The memory footprint is 13.8 MB After this line of code: [self.alignmentView setNeedsDisplay];
 The memory footprint spikes to 21.5 MB, stays there for a few seconds then returns to the pre-existing level of 13.8 MB The solution I am looking for would allow me to essentially, create a horizontal render buffer window that that is the height of a single row of alignment objects. I would allocate its memory render into it, then discard it. I would do this over and over again for each row of alignment data. In theory, I could render an infinite amount of data with this approach which of course would be most excellent ;-). -Doug

@TITLE:keyUp event heard?: Overridden NSView method
@CONTENT:UPDATED: I'm now overriding the NSView keyUp method from a NSView subclass set to first responder like below, but am still not seeing evidence that it is being called. @implementation svsView

- (BOOL)acceptsFirstResponder {
    return YES;
}

- (void)keyUp:(NSEvent *)event {
  //--do key up stuff--
  NSLog(@"key up'd!");
}

@end
 --ORIGINAL POST-- I'm new to Cocoa and Obj-C and am trying to do a (void)keyUp: from within the implementation of my controller class (which itself is of type NSController). I'm not sure if this is the right place to put it, though. I have a series of like buttons each set to a unique key equivalent (IB button attribute) and each calls my (IBAction)keyInput method which then passes the identity of each key onto another object. This runs just fine, but I also want to track when each key is released. --ORIGINAL [bad] EXAMPLE-- @implementation svsController

//init
//IBActions

- (IBAction)keyInput:(id)sender {
  //--do key down stuff--
}

- (void)keyUp:(NSEvent *)event {
  //--do key up stuff--
}

@end
 Upon fail, I also tried the keyUp as an IBAction (instead of void), like the user-defined keyInput is, and hooked it up to the appropriate buttons in Interface Builder, but then keyUp was only called when the keys were down and not when released. (Which I kind of figured would happen.) Pardon my noobery, but should I be putting this method in another class or doing something differently? Wherever it is, though, I need it be able to access objects owned by the controller class. Thanks for any insight you may have.
@CODE:@implementation svsView

- (BOOL)acceptsFirstResponder {
    return YES;
}

@CONTENT:We've recently migrated our systems from Sun Java 5 to Java6 server VM (specifically, 1.6.0_16 on Linux 32 bit). We've noticed that the garbage collection behaviour has changed in such a way as to trigger our heap-warning monitoring system. The heap usage graphs indicate a much "spikier" memory usage profile than we saw with Java5, with the VM letting heap usage get very high before running a big GC. It doesn't appear to be a problem with the application system itself (it never actually runs out of memory), but it's giving the monitoring system the occasional spurious "hair on fire" signals whenever the usage spike approaches the threshold. We could increase the heap max and hope the spike doesn't simply get bigger, but I'd much rather find out if there's a way we can tune the JVM parameters in such a way that we get a smoother profile, even if we loose a bit of performance. I'm guessing there might be some -XX option we can set to achieve this, but I an't see any such thing in the docs. Anyone know of such an option?

 And that's the JavaScript (using jQuery) $("#menu1").click(function() {

$("#menu2").click(function() {

});
$("#menu4").click(function() {
    $("div.submenu").hide(); // hide all menus
    $("#submenu4").toggle(); // open this menu
});

$(document).bind('click', function(e) {
    var $clicked = $(e.target);
    if (! $clicked.parents().hasClass("nav"))
    $("div.submenu").hide();
});
 There is a lot of repetition in the first part of the JS, is there a way to make this shorter, nicer, better?
@CODE:<ul id="nav" class="nav">
    <li>
        <a id="menu1" class="menu">MENU 1</a> <!-- top menu -->
        <div id="submenu1" class="submenu"> <!-- hidden by default -->

$("#menu2").click(function() {

@TITLE:Multiple instances of CKEditor (in Safari) [duplicate]
@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: CKEditor instance already exists 30 answers I'm having a problem creating multiple instances of a CKEditor in a JQuery UI dialog. The dialog loads a remote form via AJAX, so the goal is to be able to close and reopen the dialog and have a new instance of the editor. With the default options, when reopening the dialog it gives an error saying that an editor with that name already exists. So I have tried several methods of destroying the editor instance and they all result in the same problem. When the editor is reloaded, the text area says null and the buttons don't function. Currently I'm using this method of destroying the instance: var instance = CKEDITOR.instances['test'];
if (instance) { CKEDITOR.remove(CKEDITOR.instances['test']); }
 I recreated the issue with a couple of simple html files available for download here. EDIT: I just tried using two remote files with a text area that has a different name and I have the same problem. When one dialog is opened and then closed, the other dialog has a "null" CKEditor when it is opened. Also, apparently this is only a problem in Safari.

@CONTENT:I've got a little text drawing puzzle under Win32. I'm trying to draw some instructions for users of my application at the top of the window. Please refer to the following window (I've changed the background color on the text so you can see the boundaries) I'm currently using DrawTextEx to draw the text to my window, but the problem is that it does not fill the entire RECTangle that I give it. Not drawing that area is just fine, until the window resizes: When the text is re wrapped due to the window sizing, because DrawTextEx doesn't clear it's background, these artifacts are leftover. I tried using FillRect to fill in the area behind the text drawing call, which does eliminate the visual artifacts, but then causes the text to flicker constantly, as it is completely erased and then completely redrawn to the display. Any ideas on how one might get the area not containing text to be drawn with the background color? EDIT: I'd like to avoid having to double buffer the form if at app possible. EDIT2: I solved the problem by only redrawing the text when I detect that the wrapping changes during a resize.

@TITLE:How to Generate a WSDL in c# without making a http request
@CONTENT:Greetings, I want to write a unit test to make sure that our web services have not changed the WSDL from the last known published version. The reason for this is because any change to a object in the WSDL will cause clients using Apache Axis to fail. Even if all you do is add a not-requred property. So, if there is a change then the developer needs to be alerted because product management will need to communicate to the clients about the change so they can be ready to re-compile their stubs when the new WSDL is published. So I was hoping to have something like this: [Test]
public void TheWSDLHasNotChanged(){
   XmlDocument currentWSDL = SomeMysteryServiceIDontKnowAbout.GetWSDLForWebServiceClass(typeof(UserService));

   XmlDocument existingWSDL = new XmlDocument().Load("ExistingWsdl.wsdl");
   Assert.That(currentWSDL, Is.Equal.To(existingWSDL));
}
 For obvious reasons I don't want to make a request to a web server (which may or may not even be running when running unit tests).

@TITLE:Bitmap (of a signature) comparison in c#
@CONTENT:We have a for fun project which require us to compare two black and white bitmaps of two signature and say whether they are the same persons signature. As this is just two loaded bitmaps rather than data captured from a tablet the approach is going to be a little different to normal signature recognition. I am thinking it would require the following steps Crop the bitmaps to just the signature Try to work out some kind of rotation to align them Resize to make the cropped / rotated bitmaps the same Analyse the signature inside (maybe by breaking down into a grid) Does anyone have any thoughts on this project? How to best do the rotation, comparison etc? Seen anything similar?

@TITLE:Adobe Flex, loading embedded fonts from modules
@CONTENT:I am just programming a language learning app in Flex for various Asian languages. As some of these languages have very big font sizes (e.g. Chinese), I do not want to load all these fonts into the app. at once but was thinking to put them into different modules and then load only the specific module (depending on which language is chosen in the main app). For this I moved the style part from the main app: <mx:Style>
@font-face 
    {
    font-family:DedicatedFont;
	src: url('assets/fonts/cma.ttf');
    fontStyle: normal;
    font-weight: normal;
    }
</mx:Style>
 into the different modules. Above one is e.g. for the Chinese font (cma.ttf). The modules are created and I can also use the fontstyle (DedicatedFont) in the module itself, but I can not access it from my main application. Could anybody pls tell me how I can load this module into my main app and then use the DedicatedFont style in my main app.

@TITLE:C++ serialization library that supports partial serialization?
@CONTENT:Are there any good existing C++ serialization libraries that support partial serialization? By "partial serialization" I mean that I might want to save the values of 3 specific members, and later be able to apply that saved copy to a different instance. I'd only update those 3 members and leave the others intact. This would be useful for synchronizing data over a network. Say I have some object on a client and a server, and when a member changes on the server I want to send the client a message containing the updated value for that member and that member only. I don't want to send a copy of the whole object over the wire. boost::serialization at a glance looks like it only supports all or nothing. Edit: 3 years after originally writing this I look back at it and say to myself, 'wut?' boost::serialization lets you define what members you want saved or not, so it would support 'partial serialization' as I seem to have described it. Further, since C++ lacks reflection serialization libraries require you to explicitly specify each member you're saving anyway unless they come with some sort of external tooling to parse the source files or have a separate input file format that is used to generate C++ code (e.g. what Protocol Buffers does). I think I must have been conceptually confused when I wrote this.

@TITLE:Building optimized Qt4 - ：./configure； flags and their meanings
@CONTENT:I recently followed a discussion on the Qt4-interest mailing list about whether it is legal or not to build a commercial/proprietary application and statically link Qt4 into it. While there are some non-proven ways of doing so (by providing object files and a Makefile, etc. to the customer), it doesn't sound like such a good idea afterall. One of my projects is using the LGPL-licensed Qt4 libraries and I ship them as separate DLLs/Dylibs/so's to my customer, using a simple installer on all platforms. While this works pretty good so far, I'd like to optimize a) the size of the installer by reducing the Qt library size by just including what I need, b) increase the startup/loading speed of my application. I'm familiar with compiling Qt myself, but Qt got a lot of flags and switches. Right now I'm building with the following flags: ./configure \
  -fast \
  -opensource \
  -qt-sql-sqlite \
  -nomake demos examples \
  -silent \
  -no-qt3support \
  -no-gif \
  -plugin-sql-mysql \
  -release \
  -no-xmlpatterns \
  -no-multimedia
 I'm not entirely sure which effect/impact the following flags have: -no-stl -no-javascript-jit -no-nis -separate-debug-info -no-openvg -no-mitshm Is there anything else I can do, for instance, by providing optimization switches for the compiler, or "stripping" unused functions out of the built Qt library to make it smaller (which would be easy with static builds). I don't have much experience with that. Oh, just as a side-note, my compiled application size is about 600 kb (non-stripped) when linking against Qt dynamically. I experimented with it and found it to be around 4 MB in size when I link statically; but that way I wouldn't have to include 40 MB of Qt libraries anymore. So, to put everything above into a question/request: If you are more advanced than me on this topic, how do you optimize/deploy your own applications and make sure they start fast and only contain what is needed? Thanks in advance for your ideas and thoughts! Basti

    dwResult = FbwfCommitFile(szDrive, pPath1); //Successful
 //This does not: std::wstring l_fn(L"\\");  
    //Because Cache_detail->fileName is \Invalid2.txt.txt and I need two
l_fn.append(Cache_detail->fileName);
l_fn += L""; //To ensure null terminated
fprintf(output, "l_fn.c_str: %ls\n", l_fn.c_str()); //Prints "\\Invalid2.txt.txt"

    iCommitErr = FbwfCommitFile(L"C:", (WCHAR*)l_fn.c_str()); //Unsuccessful
 //Then when I do a comparison on these two they are unequal. int iCompareResult = l_fn.compare(pPath1);  // returns -1
 So I need to figure out how these two ended up to be different. Thanks a lot!
@CODE:WCHAR szPath1[50] = L"\\Invalid2.txt.txt";
    dwResult = FbwfCommitFile(szDrive, pPath1); //Successful std::wstring l_fn(L"\\");  
    //Because Cache_detail->fileName is \Invalid2.txt.txt and I need two
l_fn.append(Cache_detail->fileName);
l_fn += L""; //To ensure null terminated
fprintf(output, "l_fn.c_str: %ls\n", l_fn.c_str()); //Prints "\\Invalid2.txt.txt"

    iCommitErr = FbwfCommitFile(L"C:", (WCHAR*)l_fn.c_str()); //Unsuccessful int iCompareResult = l_fn.compare(pPath1);  // returns -1

@CONTENT:I am trying to set up my Visual Studio projects. I have a generic project (say SharedProj) that has all the constants, common classes. SharedProj will be referenced by two other solutions (say SolnA, SolnB), but potential more in the future. There are two ways I can think of: I can add SharedProj to both SolnA and SolnB. Or I can add the SharedProj.dll to the References in both SolnA and SolnB. Since this is my first time working on a solution that references other projects/solutions, is one way preferred than the other? By the way, is there any easy way to rename a variable name in SharedProj and updates all references to this variable? Like if I rename a variable's name within the project, there's an option that says "Rename 'old' to 'new'" which renames everything. Thanks for your help.

@CONTENT:I realize this is a very generic question, but I guess I'm not really looking for a definitive answer. Being new to PHP frameworks I'm having a hard time getting my head around it. Javascript frameworks, especially with UI extensions, seem to have their sort-of MVC-like approach by separating your JS code from your design. It just seems like it would get confusing to use an additional MVC framework on the backend. Is this commonly done for primarily AJAX-driven applications? Is there an accepted/common way of doing it?

@TITLE:File Upload read to memory and use as text file - is there a better way?
@CONTENT:I have a intranet hosted web application where the user will upload a text file with space delimited data in 5 columns. I don't wish to save the file so I wanted to just use it in memory. I tried many different examples off the web and none worked. Finally a co-worker showed me how to do this. Here is the code and I'm wondering if there is a better way to do this. In the end, all I want is a way to link the data to a gridview or repeater for viewing and later storage into a database (SQL Server). The upload file asp tag ID is SurveyFileUpload The SurveyDate is an asp:input field Int32 fileLen = SurveyFileUpload.PostedFile.ContentLength;

// Create a byte array to hold the contents of the file.
Byte[] buffer = new Byte[fileLen];

// Initialize the stream to read the uploaded file.
Stream s = SurveyFileUpload.FileContent;

// Read the file into the byte array.
s.Read(buffer, 0, fileLen);

// Convert byte array into characters.
ASCIIEncoding enc = new ASCIIEncoding();
string str = enc.GetString(buffer);
testReadFile(str, db_surveyDate.Text);

protected void testReadFile(string inFileString, string inSurveyDate)
{
    string[] lines = inFileString.Split('\n');
    curFileListing.InnerHtml = "";
    int curRow = 1;
    var readings = from line in lines
       select new
       {
           // this is just for display purposes to show the number of rows on the page
           Row = curRow++,
           SurveyDate = inSurveyDate,
           ItemNumber = Regex.Split(line, "[ ]+")[0],
           Northing = Regex.Split(line, "[ ]+")[1],
           Easting = Regex.Split(line, "[ ]+")[2],
           Elevation = Regex.Split(line, "[ ]+")[3],
           Name = Regex.Split(line, "[ ]+")[4]
       };
    saveFileData.Visible = true;
    GridView fileData = new GridView();
    fileData.DataSource = readings;
    fileData.DataBind();
    fileData.AlternatingRowStyle.BackColor = 
           System.Drawing.ColorTranslator.FromHtml("#eee");
    curFileListing.Controls.Add(fileData);
}
 This works OK. I'm not that knowledgeable with LINQ and I had a hard time with the file stream part.
@CODE:Int32 fileLen = SurveyFileUpload.PostedFile.ContentLength;

// Create a byte array to hold the contents of the file.
Byte[] buffer = new Byte[fileLen];

@TITLE:Using recvfrom() with raw sockets : general doubt
@CONTENT:I have created a raw socket which takes all IPv4 packets from data link layer (with data link layer header removed). And for reading the packets I use recvfrom. My doubt is: Suppose due to some scheduling done by OS, my process was asleep for 1 sec. When it woke up,it did recvfrom (with number of bytes to be received say 1000) on this raw socket (with the intention of receiving only one IPv4 packet and say the size of this packet is 380 bytes). And suppose many network applications were also running simultaneously during this time, so all IPv4 packets must have been queued in the receive buffer of this socket. So now recvfrom will return all 1000 bytes (with other IPv4 packets from 381th byte onwards) bcoz it has enough data in its buffer to return. Although my program was meant to understand only one IPv4 packet So how to prevent this thing? Should I read byte by byte and parse each byte but it is very inefficient.

@TITLE:Grab exclusively/release mouse in application (Windows, C++)
@CONTENT:I have lost many hours trying to grab exclusively the mouse in my application and re-releasing it. Right now, I am grabbing it correctly: the mouse cursor disappears from screen and I can read its properties fine. However, I can't release it correctly! The mouse cursor reappears on screen but no other application is receiving any mouse clicks any more; except mine. Here is the problematic code : IDirectInputDevice8* mMouse;

void Win32Mouse::grab(bool grab)
{
    if (mGrabMouse == grab)
        return;

    mMouse->Unacquire();

    if (grab)
    {
        // grab = true; seems to work fine
        coopSetting &= ~DISCL_BACKGROUND;
        coopSetting &= ~DISCL_NONEXCLUSIVE;
        coopSetting |= DISCL_FOREGROUND | DISCL_EXCLUSIVE;
    }
    else
    {
        // grab = false; this surely isn't working as it should
        coopSetting &= ~DISCL_FOREGROUND;
        coopSetting &= ~DISCL_EXCLUSIVE;
        coopSetting |= DISCL_BACKGROUND | DISCL_NONEXCLUSIVE;
    }

    if( FAILED(mMouse->SetCooperativeLevel(mHwnd, coopSetting)) ) {
        std::cout << "Failed to set coop level\n";
    }

    HRESULT hr = mMouse->Acquire();
    if (FAILED(hr) && hr != DIERR_OTHERAPPHASPRIO) {
        std::cout << "Failed to aquire mouse!\n";
    }

    mGrabMouse = grab;
}
 Could the problem be that I have Windows7?!

 edit: I've narrowed down the code a bit. It seems that if I put a Popup with textbox inside the CellEditingTemplate directly the textbox gets focus no problem. When I move that code into a UserControl I can no longer select the textbox when editing the cell. Is the UserControl doing something funny with the focus ? The problem is when i edit the cell in the datagrid I get the user control showing up but I can't click in the TextBox searchTextBox. When I click on it the popup closes and the cell goes back to default. I have tried copying and pasting all the code inside the user control and pasting it directly into the CellEditingTemplate and that interacts the way it should. I was just wondering if the UserControl did something weird that prevents a popup from gaining focus because it works as expected when directly placed in the CellEditingTemplate ? Thanks, Raul

@TITLE:Java Thread won't pause on I/O operation
@CONTENT:I was under the impression that in Java, a Thread will pause and give other threads a chance to do some work during blocking I/O operations ( like Socket.read() or DataGramsocket.receive() ). For some reason in my multi threaded network application, a call to receive() is causing all my other threads to starve ( the thread that called receive() is becoming a big boss and never giving up control, thus blocking forever! ) Why would this happen? I used to have the same exact application, but instead of UDP it was TCP based. Socket.read() always paused the Thread and allowed others to work for a bit if it blocked for too long. -- extra info -- The TCP version of my custom thread was this code: http://www.dwgold.com/code/proxy/proxyThread.java.txt My new code ( UDP version ) is pretty much the same, but modified a bit to use UDP methods and style. I then created two of these threads and call start on both. The first thread always blocks and never lets the other do work in the UDP version.

@TITLE:SQL Server (2005) - ：Deleted On； DATETIME and Indexing
@CONTENT:I have a question related to database design. The database that I'm working with requires data to treated in some way that it is never physically deleted. We started going down a path of adding a "DeleteDateTime" column to some tables, that is NULL by default but once stamped would mark a record as deleted. This gives us the ability archive our data easily but I still feel in the dark on a few areas, specifically whether this would be considered in line with best practices and also how to go about indexing these tables efficiently. I'll give you an example: We have a table called "Courses" with a composite primary key made up of the columns "SiteID" and "CourseID". This table also has a column called "DeleteDateTime" that is used in accordance with my description above. I can't use the SQL Server 2008 filtered view feature because we have to be SQL Server 2005 compatible. Should I include "DeleteDateTime" in the clustered index for this table? If so should it be the first column in the index (i.e. "DeleteDateTime, SiteID, CourseID")... Does anyone have any reasons why I should or shouldn't follow this approach? Thanks!

As the bean itself is also used by non-custom components, I would like to avoid using additional ui:param (like described here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1083834/passing-action-in-richmodalpanel) since it will essentially specify the same bean. Is it possible to specify component's action using bean name provided with ui:param? Bassicaly I am trying to achieve the following: <ui:composition xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"

@CONTENT:I'm binding a collection of objects to a listbox in WPF, for simplicity we'll say the object i'm binding has 3 propertys: Name, URL, IsBold. What I want to do, is have it displayed different if the IsBold is set to true, again as an example I want to set the TextBlock that Name appears in, to be bold. Is something like this even possible? Can I use a different style or something if one of my properties is a certain value? (can I do anything like an if/else in XAML)? I really have no idea where to start with this. Say I have this in my DataTemplate <TextBlock Style="{StaticResource notBold}" Text="{Binding Path=Name}"></TextBlock>
 And if the IsBold is set to true for that particular Item I would like it to be (notice the style changes from 'notBold' to 'isBold') <TextBlock Style="{StaticResource isBold}" Text="{Binding Path=Name}"></TextBlock>
 Or something similar. I guess the more general question. Is it possible to change the apperance of something based on an item that's databound? And if it's not possible, how would something like this be done? Thru the code-behind somehow? Thanks

@TITLE:Creating installers for complex cross-platform programs
@CONTENT:I'm sketching an application deployment process for a bunch of relatively complex desktop applications. We have both native and Java apps, so the deployment must be able to check for existence of the JRE and install it if needed. Some of the apps depend on special hardware, so the deployment must also be able to launch the necessary driver installers. Some of the apps are multiplatform, and preferably the same mechanism should be able to create Windows, Linux and Mac OS X installers. That is: The installer must be able to install, in addition to the application itself: Java Runtime Environment. Drivers (hardware) - that is, launch other installers. The installer builder must be operable from the command line so that it can be integrated with an automatic build mechanism that generates installer packages for each platform as nightly builds. In addition, I need to create "update from the web" mechanisms for the applications. It could be included in the installer, or it could also be a separate custom mechanism built into the application. Now, this is getting a bit complex, and I suspect that there might be no single installer that could do this all. Therefore I'm thinking between two fundamentally different approaches: Platform-specific mechanisms: NSIS would create .exe or .msi for Windows, XXX would create .deb for Ubuntu, and YYY would create .dmg for OS X. Cross-platform installer that would handle all the requirements above: ZZZ? Any recommendations? Some options that I've looked include: NSIS - Excellent, but Windows only. IzPack - Good, but requires JVM to run. Is there an universal tool for this, or should I just pick an appropriate tool separately for each platform? In the latter case, what would be "NSIS equivalents" for Ubuntu and Mac OS X?

@TITLE:MS Access cannot create the MDE Error. Too Many Objects
@CONTENT:So I have a MS Access database at work. Recently I tried to put out another MDE file, that actually took something off a report that was previously there. Now I am getting this error that says, "MS Access cannot create the MDE" with a little show help button....click the show help button and it gives a description about this relating typically to too many objects (Forms, reports, tables, etc). This database is not very big at all, so I am wondering how this could be happening? Does it count each time I release an MDE with only minor changes, all the same forms, reports, etc over and over again? Could this be another error and the pop up box is kind of blanket or generic? Is there anyway to solve this? Does this count objects on a form/report (text boxes, cmb boxes, etc)? Basically the example given in the help says that if you have 500 forms, and 2 modules for each form, then that would count as a 1000....this database has about 12 forms, 4 queries, 16 tables (max record = >1000 records) and is not very big. Since the last time I released an MDE with no problem, I have only tried to deleate an item off a report for this new one, without adding anything new. Please help....there are screaming for this, and I am at my wits end! Thanks

@TITLE:Client server AES encryption
@CONTENT:I am developing a client server application in which data is transferred between two clients through the server. The data should be encrypted and I thought of using AES. My thought was to use PBKDF2 in order to derive the AES key from the client's password. In this case the client will encode the data, the server will decode it, reencode it using the 2nd client's password and send it to the 2nd client. Do you think this is the best way to implement this? Is there a way for the first client to encode and the 2nd client to decode without server interference? How can I encrypt the AES key and transfer it from one client to the other? What do you think of the following solution? Client and server create a private AES key using Diffie-Hellman (this key is specific to each client). Transmitting client creates a session AES key and encodes it using the private AES key. Server decrypts the session key and re-encrypt it for every client in the session (using each client's private key). Transmitting client encrypts the data using the session AES key and sends it to the server. Server sends the data to all recipient clients without any required processing.

 However, when i do the following cast it compiles with no runtime errors: UserDataAccessLayer udal = new UserDataAccessLayer();
            ITableDataAccessLayer<UserRecord> itdal = (ITableDataAccessLayer<UserRecord>)udal;
 I really need to work with the base ITableDataAccessLayer<TableRecord> interface, as i don't know the concrete type. Hope this is descriptive and helpfull enough to answer my question.
@CODE:public abstract class Record { }

public abstract class TableRecord : Record { }

RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php/$1 [L]
 I would like that requests for a certain folder (let call it 'private') still be processed by php. The reason for doing this is that i would then verify if the user is authenticated, and if so, send contents to browser. Any apache gurus in the house who can assist?

 edit: I've narrowed down the code a bit. It seems that if I put a Popup with textbox inside the CellEditingTemplate directly the textbox gets focus no problem. When I move that code into a UserControl I can no longer select the textbox when editing the cell. Is the UserControl doing something funny with the focus ? The problem is when i edit the cell in the datagrid I get the user control showing up but I can't click in the TextBox searchTextBox. When I click on it the popup closes and the cell goes back to default. I have tried copying and pasting all the code inside the user control and pasting it directly into the CellEditingTemplate and that interacts the way it should. I was just wondering if the UserControl did something weird that prevents a popup from gaining focus because it works as expected when directly placed in the CellEditingTemplate ? Thanks, Raul

For some reason in my multi threaded network application, a call to receive() is causing all my other threads to starve ( the thread that called receive() is becoming a big boss and never giving up control, thus blocking forever! ) Why would this happen? I used to have the same exact application, but instead of UDP it was TCP based. Socket.read() always paused the Thread and allowed others to work for a bit if it blocked for too long. -- extra info -- The TCP version of my custom thread was this code: http://www.dwgold.com/code/proxy/proxyThread.java.txt My new code ( UDP version ) is pretty much the same, but modified a bit to use UDP methods and style. I then created two of these threads and call start on both. The first thread always blocks and never lets the other do work in the UDP version.

@CONTENT:I have a question related to database design. The database that I'm working with requires data to treated in some way that it is never physically deleted. We started going down a path of adding a "DeleteDateTime" column to some tables, that is NULL by default but once stamped would mark a record as deleted. This gives us the ability archive our data easily but I still feel in the dark on a few areas, specifically whether this would be considered in line with best practices and also how to go about indexing these tables efficiently. I'll give you an example: We have a table called "Courses" with a composite primary key made up of the columns "SiteID" and "CourseID". This table also has a column called "DeleteDateTime" that is used in accordance with my description above. I can't use the SQL Server 2008 filtered view feature because we have to be SQL Server 2005 compatible. Should I include "DeleteDateTime" in the clustered index for this table? If so should it be the first column in the index (i.e. "DeleteDateTime, SiteID, CourseID")... Does anyone have any reasons why I should or shouldn't follow this approach? Thanks!

@TITLE:Creating installers for complex cross-platform programs
@CONTENT:I'm sketching an application deployment process for a bunch of relatively complex desktop applications. We have both native and Java apps, so the deployment must be able to check for existence of the JRE and install it if needed. Some of the apps depend on special hardware, so the deployment must also be able to launch the necessary driver installers. Some of the apps are multiplatform, and preferably the same mechanism should be able to create Windows, Linux and Mac OS X installers. That is: The installer must be able to install, in addition to the application itself: Java Runtime Environment. Drivers (hardware) - that is, launch other installers. The installer builder must be operable from the command line so that it can be integrated with an automatic build mechanism that generates installer packages for each platform as nightly builds. In addition, I need to create "update from the web" mechanisms for the applications. It could be included in the installer, or it could also be a separate custom mechanism built into the application. Now, this is getting a bit complex, and I suspect that there might be no single installer that could do this all. Therefore I'm thinking between two fundamentally different approaches: Platform-specific mechanisms: NSIS would create .exe or .msi for Windows, XXX would create .deb for Ubuntu, and YYY would create .dmg for OS X. Cross-platform installer that would handle all the requirements above: ZZZ? Any recommendations? Some options that I've looked include: NSIS - Excellent, but Windows only. IzPack - Good, but requires JVM to run. Is there an universal tool for this, or should I just pick an appropriate tool separately for each platform? In the latter case, what would be "NSIS equivalents" for Ubuntu and Mac OS X?

Now I am getting this error that says, "MS Access cannot create the MDE" with a little show help button....click the show help button and it gives a description about this relating typically to too many objects (Forms, reports, tables, etc). This database is not very big at all, so I am wondering how this could be happening? Does it count each time I release an MDE with only minor changes, all the same forms, reports, etc over and over again? Could this be another error and the pop up box is kind of blanket or generic? Is there anyway to solve this? Does this count objects on a form/report (text boxes, cmb boxes, etc)? Basically the example given in the help says that if you have 500 forms, and 2 modules for each form, then that would count as a 1000....this database has about 12 forms, 4 queries, 16 tables (max record = >1000 records) and is not very big. Since the last time I released an MDE with no problem, I have only tried to deleate an item off a report for this new one, without adding anything new.

@TITLE:Any suggestions for a db schema for storing related keywords?
@CONTENT:I have to store a set of related keywords inside a database. As of now, I am thinking of using the following: To store the keywords themselves: CREATE TABLE keywords(
   id int(11) AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
   word VARCHAR(255)
);
 To store the relations (stores the ids of the related keywords): CREATE TABLE relatedkeywords(
   id int(11) AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
   keyword1 int(11),
   keyword2 int(11),
   FOREIGN KEY (keyword1) REFERENCES keywords(id),
   FOREIGN KEY (keyword2) REFERENCES keywords(id)
);
 Is this the convention or is there a better way of doing this? The only problem I am seeing is that I need to check both the column in order to be able to get the related keywords sometimes... I might be missing something here.
@CODE:CREATE TABLE keywords(
   id int(11) AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
   word VARCHAR(255)
); CREATE TABLE relatedkeywords(

@LINK:/questions/1778637/client-server-aes-encryption
@TITLE:Client server AES encryption
@CONTENT:I am developing a client server application in which data is transferred between two clients through the server. The data should be encrypted and I thought of using AES. My thought was to use PBKDF2 in order to derive the AES key from the client's password. In this case the client will encode the data, the server will decode it, reencode it using the 2nd client's password and send it to the 2nd client. Do you think this is the best way to implement this? Is there a way for the first client to encode and the 2nd client to decode without server interference? How can I encrypt the AES key and transfer it from one client to the other? What do you think of the following solution? Client and server create a private AES key using Diffie-Hellman (this key is specific to each client). Transmitting client creates a session AES key and encodes it using the private AES key. Server decrypts the session key and re-encrypt it for every client in the session (using each client's private key). Transmitting client encrypts the data using the session AES key and sends it to the server. Server sends the data to all recipient clients without any required processing.

When do you start storing parameters in the url, when don't you? These big companies don't seem to be following the rules so hotly debated in the ruby community (that you should almost never nest URLs for example), so I'm wondering how you go about implementing your own urls in larger scale projects because it seems like the idea of not nesting urls breaks down at anything larger than a blog.

@CONTENT:Let me explain my situation: I'm using a MVC framework (CodeIgniter), so every request gets rewritten to my index.php file, which in turn routes this to my classes and functions. Offcours if there are requests for real files they should not be processed by scripts but directly send from webserver to browser. Owkay no problem, the following rewrite rules will do just that: RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php/$1 [L]
 I would like that requests for a certain folder (let call it 'private') still be processed by php. The reason for doing this is that i would then verify if the user is authenticated, and if so, send contents to browser. Any apache gurus in the house who can assist? Is this a acceptable solution to this the problem?

@CONTENT:How do you debug a firewall issue with your application at a customer site? Currently we have an issue where Apache and Tomcat (part of the application) throw errors that sound like the firewall is blocking our attempt to accept or bind to ports on the machine. The problem for us is we can't see what the firewall is doing, because it is managed at a corporate level. Is there even a way to figure out if we are getting blocked or if it is an application specific issue. This is a java application.

@TITLE:Using a CDN like Amazon S3 to control access to media
@CONTENT:I want to use Amazon S3/CloudFront to store flash files. These files must be private as they will be accessed by members. This will be done by storing each file with a link to Amazon using a mysql database. My problem is this... A high level member who has access to lots of flash files and content can simply find out the URL and then browse to it using the address bar, and share this with other members. As they are both using the http protocol, does this mean I can't prevent this? I thought about htaccess but as its Amazon's own server I'm not sure. I looked at the Access Control documentation but it was a bit unclear. Also while im here does anyone know a working method for stopping the flash media from showing up in the firefox Tools > Page Info > Media? I saw a post on here about a dummy loader but they don't work as pointed out because you can just download and change the file extension. There are sites out there that do it but I wan't to avoid expensive software licences etc. Sorry thats so lengthy :) Big thanks!

@CONTENT:I installed a couple of pythons in different versions with macports, and the apple python 2.6 is also working. Now I need to run a program which requires MySQLdb package support in python, and this package was installed to the python I installed by macports. The program tells me that there is no MySQLdb installed, so I guess it is the apple python working for that program. I searched for some help and found python_select for switching between pythons. However after the command $>sudo python_select python25
 told me that it selected the version "python25" for python, when I type $>python
 it is still apple python 2.6 that launches. The question is that how can I make python25(the one with MySQLdb) work for the program rather than apple python? Another important thing, the program is NOT a .py file and needs to be compiled before running. So do I need to re-install this program? My Mac OS version is Snow Leopard 10.6.

@CONTENT:Basically, given a template class like this: template< class Value > class Holder { };
 I would like to be able to discover the type Value for a given Holder class. I thought that I would be able to make a simple metafunction that takes a template template argument, like this: template< template< class Value > class Holder > class GetValue
{
    typedef Value Value;
};
 And then extract out the Value type like this: GetValue< Holder< int > >::Value value;
 But instead I just get an error message pointing to the metafunction declaration: error: ．Value・ does not name a type
 Is there any way to accomplish this kind of thing? Thanks. [EDIT] I also get the error messages: error: type/value mismatch at argument 1 in template parameter list for ．template<template<class Value> class Holder> class GetValue・
error:   expected a class template, got ．Holder<int>・
 Which leads me to conclude that Phil Nash is right, you can't pass a class as a template template argument.
@CODE:template< class Value > class Holder { }; Value Holder template< template< class Value > class Holder > class GetValue

@TITLE:Bash-script printing a pdf to a pdf in Linux
@CONTENT:The question probably sounds a little odd, but the actual task is relatively simple, I swear! I'm automatically generating some PDFs from a webform, using PDFCreator to merge a generated FDF into a preexisting PDF. I created the preexisting PDF in NitroPDF. This setup works great - almost. The problem is that when you view the generated PDFs in Adobe Reader 9 (the most common reader) a subset of the fields are just blank. The information is still there; using previous versions of Adobe Reader or a different reader like Foxit Reader shows the entire PDF. No clue what's going on, and Adobe tech support was useless since I didn't create the PDF with Adobe software. (If you'd like to help fix this problem instead of the following, feel free to email me.) However, if I take the resultant PDF and print it to a fresh PDF using a PDF printer driver, it works great everywhere. This is time-consuming and annoying for our sales department to do themselves, so I want to perform this step automagically upon creating the first PDF. I'm in ubuntu, and have command-line root access to the server. The program is written in PHP, and can easily make system calls. I'm just having trouble figuring out how to tie things together properly so that I can automatically print a known file using a specific printer driver to another known file.

@TITLE:SELECT command to calculate percentage
@CONTENT:I'm trying to get the percentage of each video I have in my database based on its view count against all other videos. I'm then trying to display all the videos from highest view count to lowest, displaying its percentage on its side inside a nice HTML page. Obviously the percentage would range from 0 - 100% (and not over) and the most popular video would probably have 100% I assume.. I have about 3,400 videos in the database. My attempts are laughable and have been scratching my head for about days now.. My table looks something similar to this. video_public
id | video_title | video_views
 Attempt: SELECT 
   id, 
   video_views * 100 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM video_public)
FROM `video_public` stat
 To be honest I don't even know if this SQL query is right. I haven't even taken into consideration the videos views against all video views and total videos.. Really stuck..

@TITLE:Turning a DIV into a click-and-drag viewport
@CONTENT:Does somebody know an unobtrusive, Prototype or no framework based way to turn a DIV with big content (e.g. a map) into a clickable and draggable "map" container with fixed dimensions, very much like Google Maps? I want to display HTML chunks in a large input form. Those chunks can exceed the space available (Each chunk can have a viewport of about 150x300 Pixels). A click-and-drag solution would be perfect to move through them. I could use overflow:auto of course but that is not a convenient method to move around in this case.

@TITLE:C# Quine Problem
@CONTENT:I am trying to understand how this piece of self-replicating code works (found here), but the problem is I can't get it to run as-is: class c {
    static void Main(){

        string s = "class c{{static void Main(){{string s={0}{10};System.Console.Write(s,(char)34,s);}}}}";

        System.Console.Write(s,(char)34,s); //<<-- exception on this line

    }
}
 It's throwing an exception on writeline: Index (zero based) must be greater than or equal to zero and less than the size of the argument list. Can someone help - in particular about the formatting option {0}{10}? I got it working like this (see below) but it's longer than the original - I am curious how the original could have worked as-is in the 1st place: class c {
    static void Main(){

        string s = "class c{{static void Main(){{string s={0}{1}{2};System.Console.Write(s,(char)34,s,(char)34);}}}}";

        System.Console.Write(s,(char)34,s,(char)34);
    }
}
@CODE:class c {
    static void Main(){

        string s = "class c{{static void Main(){{string s={0}{10};System.Console.Write(s,(char)34,s);}}}}";

        System.Console.Write(s,(char)34,s); //<<-- exception on this line

@TITLE:Effects of changing NLS_LANG setting in the registry for Oracle Client
@CONTENT:We are in the process of moving from the .NET Microsoft oracle driver to the ODP.NET driver. One of the problems we have had is this error: ORA-12705: Cannot access NLS data files or invalid environment specified We were able to stop the error by modifying the registry and changing the setting (see this question) In our case we changed HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE - SOFTWARE - ORACLE - NLS_LANG which was set to NA to be the same as HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE - SOFTWARE - ORACLE - HOME0 - NLS_LANG which was set correctly My question is why would there be different NLS_LANG settings in the registry, and might there be any knock on effects of changing this value? Update: I've just found in the Oracle NLS FAQ the following For Oracle version 7: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\ORACLE For Oracle Database versions 8, 8i and 9i: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\ORACLE\HOMEx\ where "x" is the unique number identifying the Oracle home. HOME0 is the first installation For Oracle Database 10g: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\ORACLE\KEY_<oracle_home_name> There you have an entry with name NLS_LANG OK, so there are different registry settings for different versions... Note: Some people are confused by finding a NLS_LANG set to "NA" in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\ORACLE when no version 7 was installed. This is used for backwards compatibility, and can be ignored. I have Oracle 9i, so now I'm even more confused - why is the ODP.NET dll looking at the Oracle 7 registry setting?
@CODE:HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE - SOFTWARE - ORACLE - NLS_LANG HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE - SOFTWARE - ORACLE - HOME0 - NLS_LANG HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\ORACLE HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\ORACLE\HOMEx\ HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\ORACLE\KEY_<oracle_home_name> NLS_LANG HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\ORACLE

@TITLE:Authorization with Websphere MQ 6
@CONTENT:I have the server side of IBM's WebSphere MQ version 6 on a virtual machine running Windows Server 2003, sitting on a Vista desktop. The desktop has the client installed. I've got a little test program (from their code samples) that puts a message on a queue and takes it off again. This program worked when run on the server directly with the server binding. However, I can't get it to work from the client side with the client binding. The error I get is CompCode 2, Reason 2035, which is an authorization failure. I suspect this has to do with the fact that the program runs under my user by default, which is on a domain that the virtual machine doesn't know about (and can't access). I have set up a local user on the vm that I'd like to connect as (user: websphere, password: websphere), but I'm not clear on how to get this all to work. I have the code that I'm using below, and I've tried various combinations of security exit settings on the channel and endpoints, but I can't get away from 2035. Anyone have experience with this? Help would be much appreciated! Code: using System;

@TITLE:Qt Python radiobutton: activate event
@CONTENT:I am developing a project for one customer, where the design has a radio button with exclusive options. Here is a piece of the code that runs and show two nice radio buttons:     self.performGroupBox = QtGui.QGroupBox(self.centralwidget)
    self.performGroupBox.setGeometry(QtCore.QRect(50, 20, 181, 121))
    self.performGroupBox.setObjectName("performGroupBox")     

    self.consultRadioButton = QtGui.QRadioButton(self.performGroupBox)
    self.consultRadioButton.setGeometry(QtCore.QRect(40, 30, 84, 18))
    self.consultRadioButton.setObjectName("consultRadioButton")

    self.insertRadioButton = QtGui.QRadioButton(self.performGroupBox)
    self.insertRadioButton.setGeometry(QtCore.QRect(40, 60, 84, 18))
    self.insertRadioButton.setObjectName("insertRadioButton")
 it just looks like: perform:
    () Consult
    () Insert
 The point here is, how to know what choice was marked: "consultRadioButton" or "insertRadioButton"? Here is a sample on trying to get this information:     if self.consultRadioButton.isChecked():
        self.call_Consult()
    if self.insertRadioButton.isChecked():
        self.call_Insert()
 But it didn't do anything when the radiobutton is chosen. Otherwise, using connect should be another option:     QtCore.QObject.connect(self.consultRadioButton, QtCore.SIGNAL("currentIndexChanged(QString)"), self.call_Consult)  
    QtCore.QObject.connect(self.insertRadioButton, QtCore.SIGNAL("currentIndexChanged(QString)"), self.call_Insert)
 But it didn't work either. What is missing here... Any suggestion? All comments are highly welcome and appreciated.

@CONTENT:I didn't know you could do this: def tom():

def dick(z):

    z.guest = "Harry"

                   #>>> dick's locals:  {'z': <function tom at 0x02819F30>}

#print dick.guest  #AttributeError: 'function' object has no attribute 'guest'

print tom.guest    #>>> Harry
print "tom's dir:", dir(tom)  # 'guest' entry appears
 Function tom() has no locals. Function dick() knows where tom() lives and puts up Harry as 'guest' over at tom()'s place. harry doesn't appear as a local at tom()'s place, but if you ask for tom's guest, harry answers. harry is a new attribute at tom(). UPDATE: From outside tom(), you can say "print dir(tom)" and see the the tom-object's dictionary. (You can do it from inside tom(), too. So tom could find out he had a new lodger, harry, going under the name of 'guest'.) So, attributes can be added to a function's namespace from outside the function? Is that often done? Is it acceptable practice? Is it recommended in some situations? Is it actually vital at times? (Is it Pythonic?) UPDATE: Title now says 'attributes'; it used to say 'variables'. Here's a PEP about Function Attributes.
@CODE:def tom():
    print "tom's locals: ", locals()

def dick(z):
    print "z.__name__ = ", z.__name__
    z.guest = "Harry"
    print "z.guest = ", z.guest
    print "dick's locals: ", locals()

tom()              #>>> tom's locals:  {}
#print tom.guest    #AttributeError: 'function' object has no attribute 'guest'

@CONTENT:I am facing the common "Fatal error: Out of memory (allocated 30408704) (tried to allocate 24 bytes)..." PHP Fatal error. Pages served via Apache are not exhibiting this behavior. I've tried the following: Increasing the memory_limit in php.ini to a much larger value. Increasing memory_limit within the script itself via calls to ini_set('memory_limit', -1), ini_set('memory_limit', '-1'), ini_set('memory_limit', 100000000), ini_set('memory_limit', '128M'), etc. unset()ing unneeded arrays and objects to encourage the garbage collector to free up memory. Contacting the web host. They are normally very capable and knowledgeable, but have not been able to help me with this issue either. I've tried explicitly including a php.ini file using the -c command-line flag to hand-pick specific php.ini files with various values. I've tried setting memory_limit in php.ini using both raw numbers of bytes and values such as 64M, 128M, etc. The hosting provider was able to run the script as root with no issues, but experiences the same issue I do when running it using my non-root user. Perhaps there is some kind of permissions issue involved? Regardless of what I try, the error message is the same. It appears that my command line scripts are ignoring changes to memory_limit. I tend to try to make sure my scripts are memory efficient, but I'm currently needing to parse large amounts of HTML via Simple HTML DOM and it is in the parser that I'm experiencing out of memory issues. In an attempt to reduce the memory footprint of the script, I've tried using DOMDocument instead. This does not help either. In fact, the out of memory error is now triggered elsewhere in the script. My question: has anyone experienced this or a similar issue? Do you have any recommendations? Thank you.

@TITLE:Can a script be automated after a commit on Perforce?
@CONTENT:We use Perforce at work, and routinely keep software projects in the repository. In general creators follow the normal Perforce flow, BUT we also have a class of users, who doesn't have any need to edit the files but only read them. Currently we use P4Web but that requires the user so download each file individually to reassemble the project directory. Ideally I would like to have a process where when a user does a commit/submit in Perforce, the script would automatically run to generate a single zip file of the project directory and files, so that it was a one-click download that was guaranteed to be correct against current state of the source files. I know Git has a post-commit hook which could be used for this, but I can't figure out an equivalent function in Perforce.

@CONTENT:I have run into an interesting problem and am not sure if it can be resolved. I have a JS script (say script1) running in an SVG document with lots of rectangles which has collected user-entered information like which rectangle was clicked / data corresponding to the rectangle etc. This SVG document is embedded inside an HTML page with <object> tags. The problem is that script1 needs to pass the collected information to another JS script (say script2) running inside the container HTML page. Does anybody know how to do that?

    <div class="featured-img five">
    	<img src="media/snow-leopard.png" alt="Snow Leopard"/>
    </div><!-- end .featured-img -->
</div><!-- end #content -->
 jQuery $(document).ready(function(){
  $('.featured-img').toggle(
  function() {
   $(this).animate({ 
          height: "600px",
          marginTop: "-100px"
 }, 500 );
        $(".featured-img > img").animate({ 
          marginTop: "0px"
 }, 500 );
  },
  function() {
   $(this).animate({ 
          height: "150px",

        $(".featured-img > img").animate({ 
          marginTop: "-200px"
 }, 1500 );
  }
   );
 });
 This works fine with one element, BUT it applies the same animation to every element assigned .featured-img on each click. Is there any way I can only animate the element I clicked, without disturbing the other ones at all? I have tried playing with :not(:animated), and other stuff, but it only made it worse. I would appreciate any help or suggestions. Thanks in advance!

@TITLE:Inserting into an Array Based Binary Search Tree? C++
@CONTENT:Im trying to insert into an array Based Binary Search tree. I am not sure how i prevent overwriting data using left and right indexes... Do i insert leftchild as tree[2 * i + 1] and rightchild as tree[2 * i + 2] ? I think it is for locating the position of a node given its name... Thats my problem. Not knowing how to insert, recursively or iteratively(ive chosen recursively but it might be totally wrong). BST::BST(int capacity) : items(new item[capacity]), size(0),
leftChild(0), rightChild(0), root_index(1)
{
 items->empty = true;
 maxSize = capacity-1;
}
 Below is the insertion function. I have seen many that deal with Linked Lists implementations, But nothing array based! Here is my attempt: void BST::insert(const data& aData)
{
if ( items[root_index].empty ) 
{
	items[root_index].theData = aData;// Get the data.
	items[root_index].empty = false;
	oldRoot.theData = aData;
} 
else  
{	
	if ( aData < items[root_index].theData )
	{
		leftChild = root_index * 2;
		if ( items[leftChild].empty )
		{
			items[leftChild].theData = aData;
			items[leftChild].empty = false;
		}//items->empty = true;
		else 
		{
			items[root_index].theData = items[leftChild].theData;
			this->insert(aData);
		}
	}
	else if ( items[root_index].theData < aData )
	{
		rightChild = root_index * 2 + 1;
		if ( items[rightChild].empty )
		{
			items[rightChild].theData = aData;
			items[rightChild].empty = false;
		}
		else//items->empty = true;

			items[root_index].theData = items[rightChild].theData;		
			this->insert(aData);
		}

	}
	else return;
}
items[1].theData = oldRoot.theData;
}
 What is correct?...Does anyone have any array based suggstions for inserting? I appear to be stuck in an infinite recursion

 I want to use a method 'a' from the db class in the 'yourClass' method 'invoke' Thanks Ok this is what i have put together from the answers provided and it works.     class A {

    	echo call_user_func( array( $obj, $method) );

    }

} 

$instance = new B();
$instance->invoke(new A(),"a");
 Which writes, 'Method a is used' to the screen But i really want to be able to pass arguments to method "a" so i tried the code below. class A {

    function a($var1,$var2,$var3){ 
    	$x = 'the three passed values are  ' . $var1 . ' and ' . $var2 . ' and ' . $var3;
    	return $x;
    	} 
    function b(){ 
    	$x = 'im method b';
    	return $x;
    	} 
}

class B {

    function invoke($obj,$arguments){

    	echo call_user_func_array($obj,$arguments);

    }

} 

$arguments = array('apple','banana','pineapple');
$use_function = array(new A(),"a");

$instance = new B();
$instance->invoke($use_function,$arguments);
 It almost works but i get these errors above the correct answer Missing argument 1 for A::a(),.....for argument 2 and 3 as well but then the answer prints to the screen "the three passed values are apple and banana and pineapple" I'm probably making a rookie mistake I've been coding all day. If someone could fix the script above and submit the working code, I would be eternally grateful. I have to put this issue to bed so i can go to bed. Thanks

@CODE:while read inputline
do
  input="$inputline"
  echo "you entered $input";

if [ -d "${input}" ]
  then
    echo "Good Job, it's a directory!"

    for d in $input
      do
        echo "This is $d in directory."
      done
   exit this is $input directory. $input/file csh foreach for

@TITLE:MOSS 404 errors for some users on certain sites, sometimes
@CONTENT:Everything works fine for most accounts 100% of the time but here and there some users who are able to access a subsite fine one day are greeted with a standard 404 the next. This can last for an hour or two days, it's really inconsistent. I check the iis logs and it says the status is also a 404 for these requests, nothing else looks unusual. Sharepoint logs have nothing for the timestamps either. Correct me if I am wrong but if it was a permission issue an access denied message would be shown. It is not the individual computer because when a user is having this problem and I can log in with their account and I also get the 404 error although I am on the exact site with another account in another browser at exactly the same time, and it works perfect. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated, I've done a fair amount of searching but can not find a similar situation or help anywhere.

@CONTENT:My development environment (Mac OS 10.6) uses JDK 1.6 while production relies on 1.5. Upgrading the prod to 1.6 isn't an option at the moment so I followed the steps to install 1.5 on my machine.

 This is a similar problem as listed in this forum but the option to set 'grails war -Dtarget.jdk=1.5' doesn't work and I'm not sure which files (and how) would need to get modified to compile the project against 1.5. (The author of the suggested script hack notes that the solution is not one he's tried) I was under the impression that Grails 1.1 was compiled with 1.5. What else can be done to resolve this error?

@TITLE:How to avoid View specific code in my ViewModel
@CONTENT:My application has a menu option to allow the creation of a new account. The menu option's command is bound to a command (NewAccountCommand) in my ViewModel. When the user clicks the option to create a new account, the app displays a "New Account" dialog where the user can enter such data as Name, Address, etc... and then clicks "Ok" to close the dialog and create the new account. I know my code in the ViewModel is not correct because it creates the "New Account" dialog and calls ShowDialog(). Here is a snippet from the VM:  var modelResult = newAccountDialog.ShowDialog();
 if (modelResult == true)
 {
   //Create the new account             
 }
 how do i avoid creating and showing the dialog from within my VM so I can unit test the VM?

@TITLE:PHP/MySQL Timezone Clarification
@CONTENT:I'm currently having an issue wrapping my brain around the notion of converting my MySQL time to a specific timezone, depending on the user's settings. All of my MySQL times are stored in UTC time, in the following format: 2009-11-08 17:06:40 Once I query the time, I'm not quite sure how to convert it to the appropriate timezone using PHP. Thus, in the example above, I'd like to display: 2009-11-08 09:06:40 Here's what I currently have (which probably needs to be fixed): $sql = 'SELECT date FROM mytable';
	require("connection.php");
	$result = mysql_db_query($DBname,$sql,$link); 
	while($row = mysql_fetch_assoc($result)) { 

	$dt_obj = new DateTime($row['date']); 
	$dt_obj->setTimezone(new DateTimeZone('PST')); 
	echo $dt_obj; 		
	echo "<br>";
	 }
 First off, I get the following error: Catchable fatal error: Object of class DateTime could not be converted to string Secondly, I am confused as to whethere I'm setting it up properly to display the time in the correct timezone anyway (in this case, PST). Any suggestions on how to do this would be greatly appreciated. Thanks! UPDATE: I took GZipp's advice, and modified the code to look like: $dt_obj->setTimezone(new DateTimeZone('America/Los_Angeles')); 
echo $dt_obj->format('Y-m-d H:i:s');
 However, it's displaying my time (using the example from above) as: 2009-11-08 15:06:40 Any ideas on what would be causing this?
@CODE:2009-11-08 17:06:40 2009-11-08 09:06:40 $sql = 'SELECT date FROM mytable';
	require("connection.php");
	$result = mysql_db_query($DBname,$sql,$link); 
	while($row = mysql_fetch_assoc($result)) {

@TITLE:XSLT transformations on very large files
@CONTENT:We are using XSLT to generate reports of our data. The data is currently stored in Oracle as XML documents (not using the XML type, but normal CLOB). We select the right XML documents and create a single document: <DATABASE>
   <XMLDOCUMENT> ... </XMLDOCUMENT>
   <XMLDOCUMENT> ... </XMLDOCUMENT>
   ...
</DATABASE>
 In some cases, the complete XML document contains +100000 documents. This means that a huge XML document is loaded first into memory, causing all kinds of memory issues. How can we prevent this from happening? We are using the XslCompiledTransform class in .NET 2.0. I know that there are 2 forms of parsing XML documents: DOM and SAX. But as I understand this, the SAX way is not possible in combination with XSLT. The DOM parsing method forces us to load the entire thing into memory. What are our options? Does it help to first write the complete document to disk? Does Oracle perform a better job on large XSLT transformations?

@TITLE:Debugging shared libraries remotely with gdb/gdbserver
@CONTENT:My question is about remote debugging an application on an embedded arm processor using gdb/gdbserver. I can debug the application itself, but the application dynamically links to a shared library which implements an in house communications protocol. I want to be able to set breakpoints within the shared library functions so try to figure out some device discovery problems. I have made sure that the library is compiled with debug symbols and is loaded by gdb on the host side, I can list functions within the library and even set the breakpoints but as soon as I try to run the application I get an error message to the effect of: Cannot insert breakpoint X. Error accessing memory address : Input/output error. where X is the breakpoint number in gdb and is an address far to small to be valid. I am using the new library on both the target and the host machine, but via mount -o bind newlib oldlib on the target from an nfs mount. Does anyone have an idea about what could be wrong? Thanks in advance.

@TITLE:Iphone sequential animation with setAnimationDelay
@CONTENT:I'm trying to chain animation events. The application I'm coding for work has a multiple choice quiz. First you pick your multiple choice answer. The quiz view fades away. Then a label ("correct" or "incorrect") fades in and then fades out. Finally the quiz fades back in again. The events are called and handled by a main viewController. I know I can chain events with the setAnimationDelegate and setAnimationDidStopSelector but I think it'll be easier and more clear to simply use setAnimationDelay so that all animations have time to finish before the next one fires. I made this function that exists in the class that holds the "correct" "incorrect" label. - (void)showIncorrect:(float)duration withDelay:(float)delay{
labelView.text = @"Incorrect!";
labelView.textColor = [UIColor redColor];

[UIView beginAnimations:nil context:NULL];

[UIView beginAnimations:nil context:NULL];

@LINK:/questions/1676466/how-should-data-be-synchronized-between-a-winforms-gui-control-and-the-client-cl
@TITLE:How should data be synchronized between a WinForms GUI control and the client class?
@CONTENT:What method is considered the "standard" for keeping data structures within GUI controls synchronized with the data structures that are maintained by the application? For example: In WinForms, if one creates a ListView instance, rather than pointing it to a data structure that represents the items to appear within the list, one must programmatically instantiate ListViewItem(s) and call an .Add method to manually replicate them, one by one, into a data structure that is internal to the ListView itself. This makes sense from a threading standpoint, and it also makes sense within the context of rendering that a control should require a specialized data structure to exist for which the control alone knows the details regarding maintenance. However, this creates two issues: Redundancy: If the client class manages its own list of entities, to allow the user to select among them from the WinForms UI, this entire list must be read, converted and then recreated inside of the UI control via methods such as: .Add(ListViewItem item) Lists now occupy twice as much memory. Complexity: Since two lists now exist, one must programmatically ensure that they remain synchronized. This can be achieved with events that are fired from the client class's collection object, or a programmer can simply be careful to always add/remove from one list when they add/remove from the other. I have seen many instances where programmers will take the shortcut of using a UI element like a ListView as the actual collection object used to maintain the list. For example, each user entered item will be immediately inserted into the ListView, and then when it comes time to access to user's entires, the application just iterates through the ListView. This method fails to apply when you are properly seperating business/application logic from UI logic. Overall, something just doesn't seem right about storing application data within a data structure that is internal to a GUI control. Likewise, storing two lists and keeping them programmitically synchronized doesn't seem like an elegant solution either. Ideally, one would need only to supply a UI element with a reference to a list that resides within the scope of the client. So, what is the "right" way to approach this problem?

I know how to add one to the datagrid, but I would like to have different menu items based on the column as well have the menu click event be aware of column or better yet the cell that the context menu was chosen for. My ultimate goal is to create a context menu that has a "Clear" menu item which will be used to null out the data in that column. I don't want an empty string or false in the case of a check box column, I want the underlying data to be nulled out.

In fact it is false when my RemoveItem method is called. I would except the parameter to be true because I answered yes to the question.

 It says it's initializing the destination folder and then asks: Enter username for Administration at http://myversioncontrorepositoryhere:
 type my username then  in Administration at http://myversioncontrorepositoryhere:
 I assume this is my password, but it just loops back to Enter username for Administration at http://myversioncontrorepositoryhere:
 What am I doing wrong? I'm very sure I'm typing in my username and password correctly.

@CONTENT:all. Maybe i've not googled enough, but i can't find any example on this question. It is possible in C# to create an custom attribute which, applied to a class, modifies all of its methods? For example, adds Console.WriteLine("Hello, i'm modified method"); as a first line (or it's IL equivalent if it's done at runtime)?

@TITLE:How to get rid of the flicker that appears during my animation?
@CONTENT:I'm learning Java by making a small game in a JApplet. I got a little problem with my sprite's animation. Here is the code : this.sprite.setBounds(0,0,20,17);

this.sprite.setIcon(this.rangerDown);
for(int i = 0; i< 16;i++)
{
    this.sprite.setBounds(this.sprite.getX(), this.sprite.getY()+1, 20, 17);
    this.sprite.update(this.sprite.getGraphics());

    try{
        Thread.currentThread().sleep(100);
    }catch(InterruptedException e){
}
 } It left some flicker during the animation. Once the animation end, the flicker disappears, but it's kind of ugly... I guess there is some step I missed. I use this method because it gives the better result for now, but I would like to stay without AWT if possible, using Swing instead. Any ideas how to get rid of the flicker? Thanks for reading. Screenshoot (Can't post images, sorry).

@TITLE:Differences between NSTableView and NSCollectionView
@CONTENT:I'm trying to decide which path to take for developing my Snow Leopard app. First, I should preface with the obvious differences: NSTableView can have multiple columns of data for representing different parts of the same "element" of data (a row) where NSCollectionView can display a grid of data as well, but every row+column combo is its own element. For my purposes, assume I'm dealing with a single column. As far as I can tell, NSCollectionView items are NSViews which all must be of the same dimensions. Also, unlike NSTableView, collectionview items are copied to the NSCollectionView instead of being provided as needed by a dataSource (I'm uncertain about this, please correct me if I'm wrong). NSTableView uses NSCells if you decide to customize the display of rows. As NSCell isn't an NSResponder, how does one handle events (if I wanted to add some sort of accessory to the cell, like how the Arrows in iTunes work (although, iTunes is Carbon). I've seen some NSCell subclasses in IB which appear to be equivalents of their NSControl brethren, but what if I want to have MySweetView objects in an NSCell?). Both seem to work about the same with respects to Bindings, correct? Finally, NSCollectionView appears to play nicely with animation of its elements (for re-arranging items, or filtering them for example). Can NSTableView do this with its rows? Anything else I should consider?

@LINK:/questions/1651342/updatepanel-startup-script-not-executing
@TITLE:UpdatePanel startup script not executing
@CONTENT:I'm writing an ASP.NET webpart for use in a SharePoint site and trying to use an UpdatePanel to render query results. I want to use a JQuery plugin to modify the table returned from the asynchronous postback, but I'm having trouble getting the startup script to execute on the asynchronous udpate. I found this post which indicates that the UpdatePanel won't do an eval() on startup scripts; instead, you must register the startup script block with the ScriptManager. It all makes sense until it doesn't work. The MSDN reference documentation seems to concur with the approach taken there. My control is too long to post completely, but here's a trimmed-down representation that I think covers anything relevant. Forgive me if there are missing controls in the paste below - I had to remove some parts, and there may be some dangling tentacles, so to speak. The below is the code for the webpart, which is not unlike the SmartPart which loads a user control (.ascx). As you can see, I am using the ScriptManager.RegisterStartupScript method. I've tried both overloads; once for the Page, and once for the ListView (renamed as 'AspListView') which is in the update panel. In neither case does the startup script execute on the asynchronous update, and I'm at a loss for why. using System;

@TITLE:Django/IE8 Admin Interface Weirdness
@CONTENT:Esteemed Django experts and users: I have been using Django's admin interface for some data editing needs. I am using it on Windows Server 2008, and using django-mssql to connect to a SQL Server backend. Python 2.6.2 Django 1.1.0 final 0 As per usual w/ Django, this was fairly easy to set up, and works beautifully on Firefox, but using IE8 I intermittently get a puzzling 'Internet Explorer cannot display this webpage' when I save a record. In the log, looks like typically on a save there's a POST request that returns a 302 status followed by a GET returning a lovely 200. This is on Firefox. On IE8 looks like sometimes POST works but GET doesn't. So that's what I have going on. Any help w/ this will be appreciated. Thank you.

@TITLE:Does HibernateTemplate work with Envers? If so, how?
@CONTENT:I am trying to use Envers on a project that also uses Hibernate and Spring - and I appreciate a lot the code reduction offered by HibernateTemplate. I configured Envers under JPA, and after a few tweaks I was able to have the schema generated by the EnversHibernateToolTask Ant task (including the auditing tables). However, when I write code such as:     hibernateTemplate.saveOrUpdate(f);
 the data is persisted, but nothing goes to the auditing tables. Conversely, if I write:     EntityManager em = emf.createEntityManager();
    em.getTransaction().begin();
    em.persist(f);
    em.getTransaction().commit();
 then data goest to the audit tables (but I'd rather use the former syntax - I know using JPA's EntityManager decouples that code from Hibernate, but it simple does not pay off the hassle - changing ORM engine is not in my wildest dreams for this project.) It may help to check my applicationContext.xml configuration: <bean id="entityManagerFactory"

@TITLE:Best practise when updating individual fields in a database record
@CONTENT:I have created a Data Access Layer using .NET. Everywhere that I update a database record, I have used sql along the lines of UPDATE Customer SET FirstName=:FirstName, LastName=:LastName, Address1=:Address1, Address2=:Address2,....etc This means that every field in the record is updated, even though only one field may have been changed. A colleague has taken issue with this, saying that we should only update a field if it has changed, citing bandwidth as the issue - say we had 160 fields, then we pass the data for 160 fields. I guess I could save bandwidth between the web server and the database server if I checked whether a value had changed, and generated sql based purely on the values that were actually changed. Between the web server and the client, I now need to pass both old and new values, so potentially I increase bandwidth there (but then ASP.NET does this already anyway, and I'm not sure we can switch that bit off so that's probably not an issue). So what is best practise? Should I be worried about updating all fields in a database record? How would I go about updating only the fields that have changed? Edit added 29 October: Does anyone know what NHibernate does? Perhaps this is an argument to invest time learning how to do it that way.

@CONTENT:I have an event that I am subscribing to in a View Model. The event subscription is done in the constructor of the view model which is created via unity.

@CONTENT:I'm having asp.Net barf at me when I submit the a form with a value like <a_ (underscore is a space). This is bad - at the very least I want to be able to gracefully handle the error, ideally I'd like the user to be able to submit anything they like and have it work as the user expects. I could set validateRequest="false" in the web.config, but I don't want to because I don't understand the security implications. This article suggested using JavaScript to escape html, and then re-forming the html server side, however I also wasn't sure what the security implications of that was - is this not just the same as setting validateRequest="false" for that control?

@TITLE:SQL Server Automatic Partitioning of Large Database Tables
@CONTENT:I am dealing with database tables with tens of millions of rows (with the potential to go to the hundreds of millions over time), and am looking at implementing database partitioning to try to keep performance stable as the row count increases. This is what I'd like to do: Say I have a table that stores animals. One of the fields is the AnimalType (i.e. Bird/Fish/Cat/Dog). I'd like each AnimalType to be a separate partition, because 99% of queries only ever relate to one AnimalType & there is roughly an equal amount of AnimalTypes in the table (i.e. 1000 fish, 1000 birds, 1000 dogs) so it means the partitions should be nice and evenly spread. However, there are a lot of animal types, and I don't want to go and manually create the hundreds of partitions for each AnimalType, and then every time a new AnimalType is entered have to create a new partition. Therefore, what I would like, is some way to tell SQL Server to partition based on AnimalType. If there is a partition already for the AnimalType, use that partition, otherwise SQL Server will automatically create a new partition. It sounds simple enough, but I cannot seem to find a way to do this. Is it possible? Alternatively, what are some other methods to keep table access speeds nice and fast? I'd like to avoid anything that is just manually moving stuff into more tables, such as moving older records into a History style table, as there is the potential for queries to need data from the full data set and hence this won't actually help. I already have some basic Indexes which help significantly.

@CONTENT:I've just received an assignment to upgrade an old Delphi 3 project that I wrote in 1999 to a newer version and add features (I previously discussed this in related questions here and here). I was assuming that the appropriate route would be to first upgrade my development environment to Delphi 2010 and then port the application. I'm now considering whether to upgrade the application to my existing copy of Delphi 2007 instead in order to avoid the Unicode complications. The application runs at a single company in the United States and is tightly bound to requirements of a single state, so it would not benefit from Unicode support. My question is: would the additional hassle of dealing with Unicode issues outweigh the benefit of using the most recent version of Delphi? You may assume that I have no experience with Unicode.

@TITLE:NSImage imageNamed: for Mac Mini returns small icon instead of high-res
@CONTENT:When using NSImage's imageNamed: method to get the icon for the current computer, if I'm running on a Mac Mini, then I get a low resolution image. If I run the same code from my MacBook, then I get a high-res icon like I'd expect. My code is as follows: NSImage *image;
image = [NSImage imageNamed:@"NSComputer"];
[image setSize: NSMakeSize(512,512)];
NSData  * tiffData = [image TIFFRepresentation];
NSBitmapImageRep *bitmap = [NSBitmapImageRep imageRepWithData:tiffData];
data = [bitmap representationUsingType:NSPNGFileType properties:nil];
mime = @"image/png";
 When I run that on my MacBook, everything works great and I get a 512x512 icon of the my computer. When I run it on my Mac Mini, i get a 32x32 icon that's been upscaled to 512x512. Any ideas on how I can get the high-res version?

@TITLE:How do I get values from SelectedItem in ComboBox with Linq and C# 3.5
@CONTENT:I am really missing something with anonymous types, because I can't figure out what to do with the Combobox.SelectedItem property. Here's the code that populates the combobox, and it works just fine          var stocks = from st in brdc.tb_dStocks
                     join su in brdc.tb_rStockUsers on st.StockID equals su.StockID

        cboStocks.ItemsSource = stocks;
        cboStocks.DisplayMemberPath = "Ticker";
 Then, when someone selects an item using the cboStocks combobox I need to figure out what that item is, but I have no idea how to do it. Clearly, this is a simple problem, but its confusing me greatly. cboStocks.SelectedItem is an object, and that object is of the anonymous type created by Linq, but thats all I can figure out.
@CODE:var stocks = from st in brdc.tb_dStocks
                     join su in brdc.tb_rStockUsers on st.StockID equals su.StockID

@TITLE:How to realize a multi channel audio pre-mixer in .net
@CONTENT:I'd like to use C# to implement an application that can play multiple audio streams at the same time. Peanuts - now the interesting part: assuming every stream is single channel (mono) I want to adjust the volume for every speaker (5.1 or even 7.1) for every stream separately. I can use the windows mixer to do this, but the problem is, that there is only one mixer and I want to adjust this for every stream separately. Any ideas how to implement this? My first guess was to multiplex the stream eight times (7.1), apply the volume level for every "channel" and then send it to the windows mixer, which is leveled for all channels at 80% for example. Do you know any libraries that might support such use case? AFAIK bass and fmod cannot do this, but correct me if I'm wrong. As alternative I was thinking of hacking the XNA for this: using a vector that describes the position of the stream related to the listener and using this to apply the volume compensation... just ramblings. (and please don't point me to some C++/WinAPI ideas on this, this project is not worth to learn another language now.)

@LINK:/questions/1622092/problem-with-eof-in-c
@TITLE:Problem with EOF in C
@CONTENT:I'm writing a program which is supposed to read two strings that can contain line breaks and various other characters. Therefore, I'm using EOF (Ctrl-Z or Ctrl-D) to end the string. This works fine with the first variable, but with the second variable, however, this seems to be problematic as apparently something is stuck in the input buffer and the user doesn't get to type in anything. I tried to clean the buffer with while (getchar() != '\n'); and several similar variations but nothing seems to help. All cleaning attempts have resulted in an infinite loop, and without cleaning, adding the second variable is impossible. The characters for both of the variables are read in a loop like this: while((c = getchar()) != EOF), which would suggest it is EOF what I have stuck in my buffer. Or does it affect the behavior of the program in some other way? Is there something wrong with the logic I'm using? I'm starting to get bit desperate after struggling with this for hours. [edit: added code below] [edit 2: clearerr() seems to make this EOF solution work after all. It seems to run in its original form like I intended under Linux, I was trying it with Windows yesterday.] code: #include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(void)
{
    int x = 0;
    int c;
    char a[100];
    char b[100];

    printf("Enter a: ");
    while((c = getchar()) != EOF)
    {
    	a[x] = c;
    	x++;
    }
    a[x] = '\0';
    x = 0;

    /*while (getchar() != '\n'); - the non-working loop*/

    printf("\nEnter b: ");
    while((c = getchar()) != EOF)
    {
    	b[x] = c;
    	x++;
    }
    b[x] = '\0';

    printf("\n\nResults:\na: %s\n", a);
    printf("b: %s\n", b);

    return(0);
}
 [edit 3:] Dynamic memory issue: My program is also supposed to handle strings longer than 100 characters. Originally I intended to solve that by dynamic memory allocation, but when I had problems with the infinite loop described above and memory-related crashes I left it out and switched over to char[100]. I think what I tried was generally something like this: while((c = getchar()) != EOF)
{
  a = malloc(sizeof(char));
  a[x] = c;
  x++;
}
 Is that a possible (or sensible) way to do that? I'm trying to allocate more memory for every character that's being handled there. Individually. With code like that (this example contains probably syntax errors) I experienced crashes, so looks to me malloc might not be the right function here, or I'm trying it wrong. Supposing it's even possible.
@CODE:while (getchar() != '\n'); while((c = getchar()) != EOF) #include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(void)

    int x = 0;

 Its simply not the case jut to sum up the values and assume that is the total volume of water irrigated. what needs to be done is work out the time difference per time stamp and calculate the volume for that time duration, and then have it over the hour(s) the user has selected. so for the above data, then the time difference would be (for the first hour) time  diff volume

 There for the total volume irrigated of that hour (from 4am to 5am) is : 373811.6 cubic meter's of water divided by 3600 = 103.8365556 The question is: How do I do this with SQL - I am totally lost, and do not know where to begin, any help would be appreciated

@CONTENT:I would like to be able to convert audio files to MP3 to the users browser on the fly. The software I am using is: Apache, PHP & FFMPEG on an ubuntu system. Here is the code I have so far: <?php

     passthru('ffmpeg -i song.flac -v 0 -ab 320k -f mp3 -');

 With this code, only the first few seconds of the audio are converted, however, when I comment out the header functions, the audio file is completely converted but all binary data is passed through to the screen (instead of wrapped in the browsers mp3 player). Any thoughts?

@CONTENT:So I have a database table in MySQL that has a column containing a string. Given a target string, I want to find all the rows that have a substring contained in the target, ie all the rows for which the target string is a superstring for the column. At the moment I'm using a query along the lines of: SELECT * FROM table WHERE 'my superstring' LIKE CONCAT('%', column, '%')
 My worry is that this won't scale. I'm currently doing some tests to see if this is a problem but I'm wondering if anyone has any suggestions for an alternative approach. I've had a brief look at MySQL's full-text indexing but that also appears to be geared toward finding a substring in the data, rather than finding out if the data exists in a given string.

@TITLE:What is the difference between structures containing bool vs uint when using PInvoke?
@CONTENT:Ok, I'm now very confused. After my last question had several people comment about changing bool to uint I verified they are the same size by:     Console.WriteLine("sizeof bool = {0}", Marshal.SizeOf(typeof(bool)));
    Console.WriteLine("sizeof uint = {0}", Marshal.SizeOf(typeof(uint)));
 Which of course prints: sizeof bool = 4
sizeof uint = 4
 That said, I then broke down and gave their suggestions a try anyway... Changing a single bool inside a structure to a uint. What I can't figure out for the life of me is why this made it work... So this works: [StructLayout(LayoutKind.Sequential)]
public struct KEY_EVENT_RECORD
{
    public bool bKeyDown;
    public short wRepeatCount;
    public short wVirtualKeyCode;
    public short wVirtualScanCode;
    public char UnicodeChar;
    public int dwControlKeyState;
}
 When used in this structure: [StructLayout(LayoutKind.Explicit)]
public struct INPUT_RECORD
{
    [FieldOffset(0)] public short EventType;
    [FieldOffset(4)] public KEY_EVENT_RECORD KeyEvent;
}
 But in this structure it breaks: [StructLayout(LayoutKind.Explicit)]
public struct INPUT_RECORD
{
    [FieldOffset(0)] public short EventType;
    [FieldOffset(4)] public KEY_EVENT_RECORD KeyEvent;
    [FieldOffset(4)] public MOUSE_EVENT_RECORD MouseEvent;
    [FieldOffset(4)] public WINDOW_BUFFER_SIZE_RECORD WindowBufferSizeEvent;
    [FieldOffset(4)] public MENU_EVENT_RECORD MenuEvent;
    [FieldOffset(4)] public FOCUS_EVENT_RECORD FocusEvent;
}
 Yet when I change bool bKeyDown to uint in the KEY_EVENT_RECORD structure it starts working again... Can someone please explain this behavior? I really would like to know the why of it so that I can avoid this undocumented feature (aka bug) in the future.
@CODE:Console.WriteLine("sizeof bool = {0}", Marshal.SizeOf(typeof(bool)));
    Console.WriteLine("sizeof uint = {0}", Marshal.SizeOf(typeof(uint))); sizeof bool = 4
sizeof uint = 4 [StructLayout(LayoutKind.Sequential)]
public struct KEY_EVENT_RECORD

    public bool bKeyDown;

@TITLE:Optimizing A* Pathfinding iPhone - Will NSDictionary do the trick?
@CONTENT:I've got a pretty big A* pathfinding function that gets called frequently and has to be put in another thread because otherwise it will make my game stutter. I come from a Java background, and recently read a discussion about the speed of HashMap's (essentially the equivalent of NSDictionary) and the different implementations you can use. I'm curious how fast NSDictionary is and whether anyone has found it to be viable option for dealing with lots of immediate and temporary object allocations, or whether it's too slow for that. Currently I'm using an NSMutableArray for the open and closed lists in the A* algorithm - I would be replacing the closed list with NSMutableDictionary due to the O(1) setObject:forKey and removeObject:forKey, and also creating an NSMutableDictionary that "mirrors" the open list. The pathing data is stored in a big NSMutableArray - I would leave this as-is because index access is fast enough (of course). So my question is... would this be a noticeable speed improvement or should I roll my own lists and/or maps? I'm just not sure what NSDictionary does and I'd like to know.

@TITLE:Is log4net killing my WCF unit tests?
@CONTENT:I have three projects in my solution: A WCF web service which provides functionality I want to test A Web Application which calls that web service A test project which runs tests on the service. The web service and the web application both use log4net with separate configuration files and this line in the AssemblyInfo.cs for configuration: [assembly: log4net.Config.XmlConfigurator(ConfigFile = "log4net.config", Watch = true)]
 When I browse to the URL of the web service (http://localhost/MyWebService/MyWebService.svc), It appears as expected - information and a link to the wsdl. When I use the web application, it all works correctly. The code calls the web service and gets correct responses in reply. Logging occurs from both the web app and the web service. However, when I run my unit tests, they all fail with the following exception: Test method MyServiceTest.MyServiceAuthTest.TestValidateCorrectly threw exception: System.ServiceModel.ServiceActivationException: The requested service, 'http://localhost/MyWebService/MyWebService.svc' could not be activated. See the server's diagnostic trace logs for more information. In the Event logs for my local machine, I get the following message: WebHost failed to process a request. Sender Information: System.ServiceModel.ServiceHostingEnvironment+HostingManager/12905972 Exception: System.ServiceModel.ServiceActivationException: The service '/MyWebService/MyWebService.svc' cannot be activated due to an exception during compilation. The exception message is: Could not load file or assembly 'log4net, Version=1.2.10.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=1b44e1d426115821' or one of its dependencies. Strong name signature could not be verified. The assembly may have been tampered with, or it was delay signed but not fully signed with the correct private key. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131045). I've removed and replaced the references, cleaned and rebuilt, and even purged the temporary asp.net files, all to no avail. The web site calls the service with no problems, but the tests fail. Does anyone know what could be happening here? Update: I removed all references to log4net and the tests ran and succeeded without a problem. Obviously, this is far from preferable. Any suggestions? Update 2: Some combination of these two things fixed the problem: Added a reference to log4net in my test project, making sure to initialise it completely. Used the release build of log4net 1.2.10 rather than the debug build.

Here is the work. I'm writing several components that is responsible for encoding and decoding customized mpeg files. On top of standart de/compression process (for both audio and video) i will implement some custom de/encryption. Writing both codec and software libraries for this. Things i can't figure out are listed. For WMP, what is the codec locating policy. How do I differantiate my custom file format from mpeg-3 format for example. What is the standarts and programming structs for this. (The real part I'm messed up is this. Container formats, video formats, fourcc codes...etc drive me to the death) For this work on Windows what method do you suggest to write codec(DMO or Filter) I'm hoping to cope with listed problems by your helps.

@TITLE:Is using a SELECT inside a pipelined PL/SQL table function allowed?
@CONTENT:The docs for pipelined functions say that DML is not allowed when they are used in a SQL statement (typically a SELECT), and in most examples the pipelined functions are used for data generation or transformation (accepting a custor as parameter), but not issuing any DML statements. Now, technically, it is possible to use SELECTs without any error from Oracle (ORA 14551 will not occur). However, I have experiences reproducible strange behavior of the select; even though PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION is not being used, the rows retrieved by the SELECT seem not always taking the current local transaction into account, which feels like a bug to me. Even more disturbing is the fact that, when using a distributed transaction (for instance via ORAMTS instead of a local transaction), the transaction is used. Edit: As it turns out, the strange effect seems related to some WITH statements in the query, which sometimes work and sometimes not (depending on the current mood of the Oracle optimizer, at least in 10g). In some cases, I get a ORA-32036, then again it doesn't occur, without changing the code at all. Now it looks as if the queries which sometimes fail with the ORA-32036 are the ones which also fail to use the correct transaction, and it may be unrelated to the pipelined function. So my specific questions are: Is there any, preferably official, statement whether SELECTs in pipelined table functions are allowed and what their transactional context is? Is there another way of modularizing commonly used queries which can be used in SQL statements (just as table functions can with TABLE())? Has anyone also experienced such behavior and does maybe know more about it? I've looked into metalink, but unfortunately I didn't find anything specific on the topic.

Say a query is doing some Order By and uses tempDB for performing that. After this query finishes, someone else also executes a query which utilizes the tempDB. Will the second query find records written by first query in the tempDB or will they be deleted? Are there any visible tables created inside the tempDB by the Sql Engine? How can I know which temporary table is created because of this query? Is there any naming convention followed by the Sql engine for naming these temporary tables?

@LINK:/questions/1591241/converting-a-decimal-number-into-binary
@TITLE:Converting a decimal number into binary
@CONTENT:I am currently reading Charles Petzold's book 'Code'. In it he explains how to convert a decimal number into binary using the following template:                 [ ]   [ ]   [ ]   [ ]   [ ]   [ ]   [ ]   [ ]
                〈128  〈64   〈32   〈16   〈8    〈4    〈2    〈1
                [ ]   [ ]   [ ]   [ ]   [ ]   [ ]   [ ]   [ ]
 In the book, his explanation on how to use the template reads: "Put the entire decimal number (less than or equal to 255) in the box in the upper left corner. Divide that number (the dividend) by the first divisor (128), as indicated. Put the quotient in the box below (the box at the lower left corner), and the remainder in the box to the right (the second box on the top row). That first remainder is the dividend for the next calculation, which uses a divisor of 64. Continue in the same manner through the template. Keep in mind that each quotient will be either 0 or 1. If the dividend is less than the divisor the quotient is 0 and the remainder is simply the dividend. if the dividend is greater than or equal to the divisor, the quotient is 1 and the remainder is the divider - the divisor. Here's how it's done with 150:"                 [150]  [22]   [22]   [22]   [6 ]   [6 ]   [2 ]   [0 ]
                〈128   〈64    〈32    〈16    〈8     〈4     〈2     〈1
                [1 ]   [0 ]   [0 ]   [1 ]   [0 ]   [1 ]   [1 ]   [0 ]
 But I'm puzzled! When I do the calculations as instructed, I'm getting very different results. What I'm doing is as follows: 150 〈 128 = 1.171875 (I don't see where the 22 comes from above?) So, I place a 1 in the box below the 150 and then carry the 171875 and use that as the dividend for the next calculation, which of course gets me into all sorts of problems, and ultimately, not the binary number 10010110! Can somebody tell me where I'm going wrong?

@CONTENT:I am currently trying to create some basic word processor features in a WPF project. I am using a RichTextBox and am aware of all of the EditingCommands (ToggleBold, ToggleItalic...ect.). The thing I am stuck on is allowing the user to change the fontsize and font face like in MS Office where the value changes for only the selected text and if there is no selected text then the value will change for the current caret position. I have come up with a decent amount of code to get this to work, but am having problems with the no selected text thing. Here is what I am doing for the RichTextBox.Selection. TextSelection text = richTextBox.Selection;

    //is on which is not the desire/expected result.
    text.ApplyPropertyValue(RichTextBox.FontSizeProperty, value);
}

 So my question is how should I go about doing this? Is there a better/more convenient way to do this?

I am graduating soon with my degree in computer science, and to this point, The only education I have gotten on regular expressions, is through a course on PL design and development. We have never been educated on the actual application and use of it in programs that we are writing, only on using Regex to actually with the programming language. The question I have is, am I right in assuming the regex is the most powerful tool in matching, and dealing with text? If I am wrong, what else is out there that I should be teaching myself (as opposed to becoming good with regex)? Also, does anybody know any good regex plugins for the Eclipse IDE(Galileo preferably). I'm looking for something that allows me to test the document and maybe highlight what is being done. Thanks

@TITLE:What is the difference between 'form_for @ecard' and 'form_for :ecard'?
@CONTENT:I implemented a restfull controller with all the correct actions and views. It works currently perfectly with a new_html.erb view that uses a form_for containing a structure like: <% form_for @ecard do |f| %>
 when watching some tutorials i saw that people also use the structure: <% form_for :ecard do |f| %>
 It sounds logical.. but when i try to use the <% form_for :ecard do |f| %> the resulting post goes to a different action then using <% form_for @ecard do |f| %>.. <% form_for @ecard do |f| %> -> html result is: <form action="/ecards" class="new_ecard" id="new_ecard" method="post">
 <% form_for :ecard do |f| %> -> html result is: <form action="/ecards/new" method="post">
 So i am wondering what i am missing, the difference in using :ecard and @ecard are obvious when i look at the generated html but i am still wondering what the reasoning behind this is! So can anyone please explain what the difference is and what structure i am supposed to be using?? Is it <% form_for @ecard do |f| %> or <% form_for @ecard do |f| %>

@LINK:/questions/1582463/table-vs-div-yet-again
@TITLE:<table> vs <div> (yet again)
@CONTENT:I generally agree with the idea that web site layouts should be done with <div>s instead of <table>s. However, I have a situation where this does not work - or at least, I have not found any solution. I have a dynamic site where many customers share the same template (they can pick one from a set of available templates). A template defines the general layout of the site - typically header at the top, two or three columns (menu on the left, primary content in the middle, and sometimes additional content on the right), and footer at the bottom - nothing fancy. The customers have complete control over the contents of the header and the right side content, and significant control over the contents of the menu and main content areas. The point here is that I do not know what the width of any of the columns will be. The customer may have long or short text for each menu item, they may put small or large images in the right-side column, and the main content can be a free-for-all. I cannot impose too many design restrictions on my customers - they have their own ideas on what the site should look like (some of them get uglier than a MySpace page). There is a 'preferred' width for the site (the main <table> width property) so that when the content is reasonable, the site maintains a nice appearance. A table based layout just handles this - whatever sizes the columns turn out to be, the table adjusts to fit. <div>s however, do not. If the menu gets a little wider, the other columns drop down below it. If some content is too wide for its container <div>, it extends past the border and interferes with whatever is next to it. I have played with using javascript to adjust column widths, but this causes flashing of the layout, where a <table> just renders it without any fuss. I know about the various table-related options for the css display property, but since they are not supported widely enough (naughty IE) I can't use them. (And as a snotty aside, the argument that <table>s were never intended to be used for layout, so instead we should use <div>s - and then tell them to behave like <table>s - sounds funny to me.) So, while I would like to switch to <div>-based layouts for all the usual reasons, I don't believe I can for these templates (or, at least, not until everyone upgrades to IE 10). I am hoping the SO gang can help me find a way to do this.

@TITLE:PHP, mysqli, and table locks?
@CONTENT:I have a database table where I need to pull a row, test user input for a match, then update the row to identify the user that made the match. Should a race condition occur, I need to ensure that the first user's update is not overwritten by another user. To accomplish this I intend to: 1. Read row 2. Lock table 3. Read row again and compare to original row 4. If rows match update, otherwise do nothing (another user has already updated the row) Based on information I found on Google, I expected the lock table statement to block until a lock was aquired. I set up a little test script in PHP that would stall for 10 seconds to allow me time to manually create a race condition.  // attempt to increment the victor number
$aData["round_id"] = $DATABASE["round_id"];

// routine to execute a SELECT on database (ommited for brevity)
$aRound = $oRound->getInfo($aData);  

echo "Initial Round Data:";
print_r($aRound);

echo "Locking...";
echo $oRound->lock();

echo "Stalling to allow for conflict...";
sleep(10);
echo "Awake...";

$aLockedRound = $oRound->getInfo($aData);
if($aRound["victor_nation"] == $aLockedRound["victor_nation"]){
    $aData["victor_nation"] = $aRound["victor_nation"] + 1;
    $oRound->update($aData);
    echo "Incremented Victor Nation";
}
 where the lock routine is defined as function lock(){
    	global $oDatabase;
    	$iReturn = 0;

    	// lock the table
    	$iReturn = $oDatabase->m_oConnection->query("LOCK TABLES round WRITE");		
    	return $iReturn;
    }
 Above, $oDatabase->m_oConnection is a mysqli connection that I use to execute prepared statements on the database. When I run my test script I kick off the first user and wait for "Stalling to allow for conflict..." , then start a second script. On the second script I expected it to block at "Locking...", however, the second script also continues to "Stalling to allow for conflict...". Since the LOCK statment doesn't appear to be blocking, nor returning any indicator of acquiring the lock (return value is echoed and blank), it's unclear to me that I'm actually acquiring a lock. Even if I am, I'm not sure how to proceed. Any pointers?

@TITLE:WPF Scale Transform and ScrollViewer - When Zoomed can't scroll beyond original size
@CONTENT:I have a StackPanel inside of a ScrollViewer. I have a slider that does a scale transform on the stackpanel to allow zoom-in and zoom-out functionality. The problem is that when I zoom in, the scrollviewer doesn't treat the content as being 'bigger'. So, if I scroll in a little and scroll as far right as I can go - it stops me before I get to the end of the content. If I zoom back out to the untransformed level, I see that it's stopping exactly at that point. If I zoom in a lot, I can only see a small fraction of my total content when I scroll all the way over. I can change the TransformOrigin to control which side loses the most content; but I figure there should be some way for the scrollviewer (or another control?) to take care of it for me.

@TITLE:How to prevent a component from being dragged out of the stage in Flex 3
@CONTENT:I think there is a simple solution to this question, just not simple enough for me to find it. Question: How do you constrain a TitleWindow in Flex 3 from being dragged off the screen/stage? Is there a way to restrict the TitleWindow to the viewing area? Example: Let's say I have an application that take 100% of the screen. Next, I create a TitleWindow via the PopUpManager. I can then proceed to click and hold (drag) that window off the screen, then release the mouse button. That window is now lost off-screen somewhere. Is there a way to keep the window from being dragged beyond the viewing area? Thanks for the help in advance.

@TITLE:LsaEnumerateAccountRights always returns ：File not found；
@CONTENT:I'm calling the Advapi32.dll LsaEnumerateAccountRights function having a policy handle from LsaOpenPolicy and an account SID from LookupAccountName. However, try as I might, I'm always getting back 0xC0000034 which after translation by LsaNtStatusToWinError gives me "The file referenced cannot be found." Which isn't a whole lot of good. My code handles this and goes on to grant the account SID the SeServiceLogonRight using LsaAddAccountRights, so I know that the policy handle and the account SID are fine as that would bomb out if something was wrong with one of those. The end result is that the account does have the right it needs so overall the code works. However, I'm using this within an MSI custom action, the Install checks to see if the account has the right and if it doesn't (or it fails as above) it grants the right and remembers it has done it in the install state. If a rollback happens and it added the right it then removes it. We never remove in an uninstall as other applications may have been installed using the same domain account that the services we run use. So the problem is when an MSI performs a rollback - it will always remove the right as it always thinks it has added it. So checking the rights using LsaEnumerateAccountRights is used for this - but I just can't get it to work. Any idea - please note that I'm using c# with DllImport attribute to expose the Win32 functions, and I'm not the worlds best Win32 programmer having been Unix before C#!

@TITLE:Network-efficient difference between two strings in Javascript
@CONTENT:I have a web application where a client side editor is editing a really really large text which is known on the server side. The client can make any kind of modifications to this text. What is the most network-efficient way to transmit the result difference in a way that the server understands? Also, since this will happen on client side (Javascript), I would also like it to be 'fast' (or at least not noticeably slow) Some scenarios: User modifies ONE character User modifies several sentences in random positions User erases everything and results in a blank text. I cannot use diff-like syntax since it's not network efficent, it checks lines, where examples 1 and 3 will produce horrible differences (especially the last one, where the result will be more than the old itself). Anyone has experience in this matter? User operates on a really large set of data - around 3-5MB of text, and uploading the whole "new" content is a big no-no. To be clear, I'm looking for a "protocol" of transfer, string comparison is not the issue.

Example, as an image: vector The problem is that I might be using this notation over a few dozen different letters or symbols, and I don't want to have to stop everything and make another image each time the need for one comes up. I want to represent this using text if at all possible. While searching, I stumbled across some HTML notation (&rarr;) for a nice right-pointing arrow (＠). So, what I'd like to be able to do is come up with some css that, for a letter enclosed by a certain span class, inserts that arrow and positions it over the contents of the span. For example: <span class="vector">v</span>

@TITLE:iPhone Memory Management: No Need to Clean Up and Release Retained Objects on App Quit?
@CONTENT:Is the following true? When the app is about to quit, it's not necessary to clean up the memory by calling release on all your retained objects, because the iPhone OS will reclaim the memory it allocated for your app when you launched it. This is faster and safer than rely on the apps to correctly clean up after themselves. You can verify this by putting an NSLog call (or a debugger breakpoint) in the dealloc method of your application delegate and seeing it's never called. So, cleaning things up when the app is about to quit is useless. Moreover, you have very limited time before the OS wipes your app out, so don't waste it on cleaning things. Focus on saving your game and any other relevant stuff. Source (cocos2d-iphone.org)

My only address information is city, country, and state (if applicable). For example, all addresses in San Francisco and within miles should be listed as San Francisco. I'll need to know the count of addresses rolled-up to San Francisco. I'm open to suggestions on how to approach this. I don't particularly want to manually identify a list of major cities if possible. Is there a list of these I can start from? What about using an average lat/long location of all addresses within miles?

@TITLE:C++ c_str doesn't return entire string
@CONTENT:I've tried the following code with both normal ifstreams and the current boost:iostream I'm using, both have the same result. It is intended to load a file from physfs into memory then pass it to a handler to process (eg Image, audio or data). Currently when c_str is called it only returns a small part of the file.     	PhysFS::FileStream file("Resources/test.png" , PhysFS::OM_READ);

	if(file.is_open()) {

		String* theFile;

		theFile = new String((std::istreambuf_iterator<char>(file)),

		for ( it=theFile->begin() ; it < theFile->end(); it++ ) {
			std::cout << *it;

		std::cout << theFile->c_str(); // Outputs only the first few lines

	}
 The iterator loop outputs the entire png file as expected, but the c_str call only returns the first few characters (\211PNG). I've been trying variations of this code for quite some time with no success. Any ideas?

@CONTENT:I am working with a legacy database schema that looks like this: product_table table has fields: uid (int, primary key) name (varchar 50) category table has fields: uid (int, primary key) name (varchar 50) Allright, now the product_table has 4 MM relations to the category table: product_table__category_1__mm has fields: uid_local (int, contains product_table.uid) uid_foreign (int, contains category.uid) product_table__category_2__mm has fields: uid_local (int, contains product_table.uid) uid_foreign (int, contains category.uid) product_table__category_3__mm has fields: uid_local (int, contains product_table.uid) uid_foreign (int, contains category.uid) product_table__category_4__mm has fields: uid_local (int, contains product_table.uid) uid_foreign (int, contains category.uid) (yes, all the 4 MM tables have the same fields and all relate to the category table) So, if I want to pull in all four joins and filter based on int values selected by the user it would look something like this: select
product_table.*

 EDIT 1: I met with some issues with using !pe and !U to find stack trace where the exception is thrown. Here is my debug process. At first I use !pe to print stack trace for the exception object, when I use !U to diassemble the code. The issue I find is !U will diassemble all function code of FooService.ProcessOrders(), and I want to find the exact place where in function FooService.ProcessOrders the crash happens. I also find the diassembled annotated IL code only contains function calls I made (for non-function call C# code, for example a=a*2, only assembly language is shown), not exactly IL mapped to each line of C# code, (1) is that the correct expected behavior? (2) what is the solution or further suggestion to find the exact failed C# code from my analysis posted here? !pe 0000064280155325

While it has a good list of user agents, I'm trying to identify which are smart phones and which are not. facebook pushes the non-smart phones to a different site than their smart phones. Trying to see if there was an easy way to do this.

@TITLE:Memory usage of a GWT application
@CONTENT:I'm currently working on a GWT application as a proof of technology for future projects. I like the way of building my AJAX code in Java instead of JavaScript. But I seem to be running into a memory problem when I repeat calls to an RPC service. The browser memory usage keeps growing and growing. When searching Google I keep reading about how great GWT is and that its impossible to get memory leaks so can anyone explain why my browser (Firefox and Chromium) memory is rocketing? Thanks in advance for helping me, Bram The code: ...

class ExampleTable extends Composite

  private RPCService rpcService;
  private Timer tableUpdater;

  public ExampleTable(){
   ... Init timer and RPC Service
   ... Add components
   initWidget();
  }

  private void getTableDataFromRPCService() {
  this.rpcService.getData(new AsyncCallback<ArrayList<Data>>() {

      @Override
      public void onSuccess(ArrayList<Data> result) {
          ExampleTable.this.updateTable(result);
      }

      @Override
      public void onFailure(Throwable caught) {
          //Do nothing
      }
  });
  }

  private void updateTable(ArrayList<Data> tableData){
    ... Update the table
  }

  private void startUpdateTask() {
      this.serviceUpdater = new Timer() {
          @Override

          }
      };
      serviceUpdater.scheduleRepeating(2000);
  }
}
 EDIT: I've spent some time to write a test application which can be downloaded here. I ran the application for about half an hour with the table update enabled after that Firefox took about 350MB of memory. I also ran the test with the update table disabled for an hour memory usage in Firefox went to little over 100MB. (To run this sample you need the Google visualization API for GWT which can be downloaded from Google but I'm not allowed to post the link because of a new user policy ) I just got home from work and start another test without the table data update to see if memory usage keeps increasing or if it stops at a certain point.

@TITLE:How to Monitor Genuine Page Hits
@CONTENT:I am trying to monitor genuine page hits. Here is what my site does. I have an article directory where people can post articles. When their article is posted they are paid depending on the amount of unique users visit their pages. So page hits are important. Here is the problem I am facing. What I need: I don't want to track page hits by minor search engines or robots. I would like the major 4 search engines to surf my site because I can monitor them by IP address and not count their visit as a page hit. This cannot be done for spam bots because they do a good job of passing as a real human or major search engine. Problems: There are spam bots on the internet that do not honor the robot.txt file There are bots that try to fake being a real human user. By manipulating the user agent and other things in the header. Performance may suffer by always checking the database for good IP addresses A human being can bypass the captha only to allow their robot to view my pages Possible solutions: Require a captcha on every page. If the captcha passes. then log the IP address as good or submit a cookie on the users machine indicating they passed. Allow all major search engines IP address, so they will not be presented with a captcha Purchase a bot detection software Require the viewer to pass a captca every 7 days Getting accurate human page views is critical for this site to work properly. Do you guys have any other ideas

 Is there any way I can express the constraint that all prerequisite tasks must have the same job? I could enforce this at the view level, but I would really like to get it to work at the model level so that the admin interface will display appropriate options when choosing prerequisites for a task. I thought I could use "limit_choices_to", but on closer inspection it seems to require a static query, not something dependent on the values in this task object.

@TITLE:File Attachements with PHP5 SOAP
@CONTENT:I'm writing some code to talk to a web service via WSDL-SOAP. I'm using php5's native soap implementation. So far so good. However I now need to download files as "attachments" over soap. The interwebs is mysteriously silent on how to do this. Surely its possible or the PHP docs would mention it as a limitation ? :\ I did this a few years ago with Pear soap but would really prefer to use the native Soap implementation.

@TITLE:Programmatically replace GridView cell contents on load
@CONTENT:I am working on a program in WPF for the first time. I have a ListView in GridView mode displaying data from a bound dataset (which is grabbed from a database). In my database, "date of birth" is not a required field. As such, any record without a dob had the value set to DateTime.MinValue. On each of these minimum value dates, the date shows in the cell as 01/01/0001. I am trying to find a way to either format the cell so that DateTime.MinValue doesn't show, or replace each MinValue with "". My thought was to either use the "Loaded" event of the textblock the date is in and replace each instance of "01/01/0001", or loop through the dataset before sending it to the GridView and remove/replace them there. I've not had any luck figuring out how to do either. My xaml code for the GridView is: <Grid>
    <ListView x:Name="resultsListView" GridViewColumnHeader.Click="GridViewColumnHeaderClickedHandler" Margin="0,54,0,28" ItemsSource="{Binding Path=Table}">
    <ListView.View>
    <GridView>
    	<GridViewColumn DisplayMemberBinding="{Binding Path=LastName}"
    		Header="Last Name" 
    		Width="150"/>
    	<GridViewColumn DisplayMemberBinding="{Binding Path=FirstName}" 
    		Header="First Name"
    		Width="100"/>
    	<GridViewColumn DisplayMemberBinding="{Binding Path=MiddleName}" 
    		Header="Middle Name"
    		Width="100"/>
    	<GridViewColumn Header="Date of Birth" Width="100">
    		<GridViewColumn.CellTemplate>
    			<DataTemplate>
    				<TextBlock TextAlignment="Justify" Text="{Binding Path=DateOfBirth, StringFormat='{}{0:MM/dd/yyyy}'}" Loaded="TextBlock_Loaded" />
    			</DataTemplate>
    		</GridViewColumn.CellTemplate>
    	</GridViewColumn>
    </GridView>
    </ListView.View>
    </ListView>
</Grid>
 Code for the DataSet: private void FillListView(DataSet ds)
{
    if (resultsListView.Items.Count != 0)
    {
    	resultsListView.Items.Clear();
    }
    resultsListView.DataContext = ds.Tables[0].DefaultView;
}
 Any advice on how to show blanks for DateTime.MinValue in my GridView would be much appreciated!

@CONTENT:Using the google maps (and JavaScript) I have been able to easily display several markers which each have a nice little info window over them. //Create map over USA
map = new google.maps.Map2( document.getElementById('map') );
map.setCenter(new GLatLng(38.95940879245423, -100.283203125), 3);

//Create point, then marker, and then add to map
function create_marker(lat, lng, html) {

    marker.bindInfoWindow(html);
    map.addOverlay(marker);
}

var html = '<div>this is my text</div>';
create_marker(38.95940879245423, -100.283203125, html);
 However, I now want to be able to link the "click" of markers to functions which can update other parts of the page as well. For example, I would like to have a sidebar with copies of the marker infowindow content. The same way google maps shows results on the left and markers on the right. I might even want the click of sidebar content to open a given marker infowindow on the map. The problem is that the GMarker click event only passes the lat/long - and I'm not sure how I can use that to find the matching div or whatever. How do I get a unique id/handle for each marker?

@TITLE:Issue with binding in jQuery for copied elements
@CONTENT:This is actually a bigger question because I know there are several ways to solve this problem but I will try to sum it up. What I try to do: I am using this jQuery plugin to upload files via Flash http://www.uploadify.com/. However, the element #fileInput that I supposed to bind this function to is a live element which is generated after the page loaded: $('#fileInput').uploadify(). The reason #fileInput is a live element is because I use FancyBox to popup a DIV and this FancyBox basically just "cloned" the inner html of the DIV. What happened: When I clicked "BROWSE" to upload a file, there is no progress bar for upload. The reason is because the Uploadify could not bind to live elements. Questions: 1. I tried to replace bind() with live() in uploadify code but that did not work because bind() allows to pass [data]. The LiveQuery plugin http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/livequery does not have the same syntax as bind() either. Is there anything similar to bind but works for live elements? If I don't try to replace bind() function and keep uploadify code the same. Does anyone know how to change code in FancyBox so that it WILL NOT make a clone to generate live elements? I know this is a hard question too. Note: FancyBox site seems dead --> http://www.visual-blast.com/javascript/fancybox-jquery-image-zooming-plugin/ Thank you very much!

@CONTENT:Let's assume I have a very simple form, with a submit button and a dropdown list. When I change the list entry and hit submit, at what stage in the postback processing does the viewstate reflect my changed list entry? According to O'Reilly's Learning ASP.Net 3.5, there are two loads taking place-- one before form validation and another after (diagram on page 266 for those with a copy). According to the diagram the viewstate is loaded during the first load stage, before the validation. I assume my changed dropdown is reflected at this point? Also, according to the diagram, posted data is processed twice, both before and after validation. Could anyone elaborate a little more on this, and what form processing takes place at each point? Thanks for the help. It's a little misty, what takes place when and I'm trying to clear it up a bit.

@TITLE:Is the use of vectors of pointers here unnecessary or worse, cause memory leaks?
@CONTENT:I am relatively new to C++ programming, but am a C programmer of 10 years so am more comfortable with pointers to objects than I am with references to objects. I'm writing a Solitaire game - is this design unsafe? Is there a better way? Anyway, I have a class SolitaireGame: class SolitaireGame:
{
    public:
        SolitaireGame( int numsuits = 1 );
    private:
        Deck * _deck;
        vector<Card> _shoe;
};
 The Deck is defined thus: class Deck:
{
public:
 Deck::Deck( vector<Card>& shoe );
 ~Deck();
 int DealsLeft() const { return deals_left; }
 Card * PullCard();
private:
 int deals_left;
 int num_each_deal;
 deque<Card *> _cards;
};
 The Deck constructor, takes a reference to a vector of Card objects ( the shoe, normally 104 cards ) and pushes a pointer to each card onto it's own deque of pointers. Deck::Deck( vector<Card>& shoe )
{
    vector<Card>::iterator iter = shoe.begin();

    while( iter != shoe.end() )
    {
        _cards.push_front( &(*iter) );
        iter++;
    }
}
 } The shoe is created in the SolitaireGame constructor. Once this vector of dynamically created Card objects has been created - I then pass a reference to this vector to the constructor. SolitaireGame::SolitaireGame( int numsuits ):_numsuits(numsuits ) 
{
    Card * c;
    vector<Card> _shoe;

    for( int i = 0; i < NUM_CARDS_IN_SHOE; i++ )
    {
        c = new Card();
        _shoe.push_back( *c );
    }

    _deck = new Deck( _shoe );
}
 My idea was that the shoe would be the container for the actual memory for the Card objects and the Deck and Columns just handle pointers to those Card objects.
@CODE:SolitaireGame class SolitaireGame:
{
    public:
        SolitaireGame( int numsuits = 1 );

@TITLE:bulk update objects using form in rails
@CONTENT:I have a person model and a quotes model. Each person can have many quotes associated with them, which in turn has things like Author, Text, Url associated with them. In practice really only one person has a quotes object but all people could potentially have one. I'm trying to have a dirt simple bulk moderate tool on quotes. As in, users can type in quotes and an admin can go and have all of the quotes of a particular person (but like in practice, only one will have them) and check a box which sets a boolean approved to 0 or 1. When the quotes are actually displayed, they're filtered by this field. I'm getting really mixed up trying to create a form that updates these all in bulk. I got the form to display all of them as so: <% form_for :quotes, :html => { :method => :put }, :url => {:controller => "quote", :action => "bulk_update", }  do |quote_form| %>
   <% @person.quotes.each do |quote| %>
<p>
   <% fields_for "quotes[id][]", quote  do |fields| %>
           Text....
           <%= fields.check_box :approved %><br><br>

  <% end %>
</p>

<% end %>
<%= submit_tag 'Update' %>
<% end %>
 I just have an incredibly generic thing in my bulk update controller which is basically like a normal update controller. I'm not sure what to put in there. I could try to put all the quotes which I probably should but I don't know how to get to that variable anyway because I'm doing all of this from whithin the Person view etc. The controller is osmething like this: def bulk_update
@quote = Quote.find(params[:id])
end
 I guess I'm getting confused about the ID that should be in there and what should be getting passed in. Should the person ID be part of this at all? Like I said, I don't really care if technically all quotes are displayed on that page, they don't need to be sorted by user. I'm getting parameters that look like this: "quotes"=>{"id"=>{"6"=>{"approved"=>"0"}, .. but it complains about not finding a quote without an ID. I don't care about the ID since I want to bulk update all of them. It seems like this particular stucture would map several ids, but maybe (probably) i have to change my controller to compensate for that, not sure how though. It also doesn't work when I try to remove the quotes par tof the hash and just have"id"=>{"6"=>{"approved"=>"0"}, .. as my parameters. EDIT: I found a statement called update_all, but I don't know how to selectively pass it what I need...
@CODE:<% form_for :quotes, :html => { :method => :put }, :url => {:controller => "quote", :action => "bulk_update", }  do |quote_form| %>
   <% @person.quotes.each do |quote| %>

   <% fields_for "quotes[id][]", quote  do |fields| %>
           Text....
           <%= fields.check_box :approved %><br><br>

@TITLE:Django session intermittently disappears just after login
@CONTENT:In my django app, I handle login in the following manner. Users go to a gateway page (index.html) - if they are not currently logged in, there will be a login/password form along with the other material. On successful login (or if they otherwise go to that page while logged in), the page is rendered slightly differently (sans login form). The way I am handling that is in the view for index.html I do: logged_in = request.user.is_authenticated()
 and then the logged_in variable is passed to the template, which is checked to see which version of the page it renders. When a user logs in, the login view calls: user = authenticate(username=username, password=password)
if user is not none:
    login(request, user)
 And then they are redirected back to index.html. More often than not, this works perfectly fine. What I see though is that sometimes between the HttpResponseRedirect and the index view is that request.user is wiped out. I have been logging this for a while now, writing to the log as the last item in the login view and first item in the index view. The effect it has for the user is that it looks like they incorrectly logged in (except w/ no message telling them that). It does seem to come in spurts, as in the system will be fine for a while, and then I'll see it happen to a user 4-5 times in a row. I should also note that I've never seen/heard of this happening at any point except at the login, as far as I can tell (it is possible that it has happened and no one has complained) once they're in, they're in. Am I doing something obviously wrong with my login methodology here?

@TITLE:Is it possible to store only a checksum of a large file in git?
@CONTENT:I'm a bioinformatician currently extracting normal-sized sequences from genomic files. Some genomic files are large enough that I don't want to put them into the main git repository, whereas I'm putting the extracted sequences into git. Is it possible to tell git "Here's a large file - don't store the whole file, just take its checksum, and let me know if that file is missing or modified." If that's not possible, I guess I'll have to either git-ignore the large files, or, as suggested in this question, store them in a submodule.

@TITLE:Running ASP Classic and .NET on Linux
@CONTENT:I'm looking at a product that was coded in a mix of .NET and ASP Classic. I'm wondering if it's possible to get this running in Linux? I've heard of Mono (which can supposedly run .NET on Linux) and Sun Java Web Server (which can supposedly run ASP Classic on Linux). Are there any other technologies that you would recommend? Also, are there any major pitfalls that I should be aware of?

@TITLE:Calling a class method with jQuery AJAX?
@CONTENT:I am moving from the PHP AJAX library xajax to jQuery AJAX. With xajax, I could contain all my AJAX calls inside class methods by binding public class methods to javascript function names (eg. $this->registerFunction('javascriptFunctionName', &$this, 'classMethodName')). I am hoping there is a way I can do something similar with jQuery AJAX, whereby I can do something like this: $('#myButton').click(function() {
    $.get('class|methodName',
    {
      parameter: value
    },
    function(data) {
      if (data) {
        ...
      }
      else {
        ...
      }
    });

    return false;
  });
});
 I know you can AJAX calls to MVC controller methods, but unfortunately my legacy product doesn't use MVC :-( Please tell me there is a way? If not, is there a way to map a call to a global PHP function?
@CODE:$('#myButton').click(function() {
    $.get('class|methodName',
    {
      parameter: value
    },
    function(data) {
      if (data) {
        ...

@TITLE:EOutOfMemory Creating Large XML Using Delphi
@CONTENT:I'm using Delphi to create an XML document from data in a relational database. It tests fine with small datasets, but when I try to expand the size of the data set to production levels it eventually bombs out with an EOutOfMemory exception during node creation. I'm using a TXMLDocument dropped on a form (MSXML as the Vendor), and my code generally looks like this:   DS := GetDS(Conn, 'SELECT Fields. . . FROM Table WHERE InsuredID = ' +IntToStr(AInsuredID));

  try

    while not DS.Eof do
      with ANode.AddChild('LE') do
      begin
        AddChild('LEProvider').Text := DS.FieldByName('LEProvider').AsString;
        // Need to handle "other" here
        AddChild('Date').Text       := DateToXMLDate(DS.FieldByName('LEDate').AsDateTime);
        AddChild('Pct50').Text      := DS.FieldByName('50Percent').AsString;
        AddChild('Pct80').Text      := DS.FieldByName('80Percent').AsString;
        AddChild('Actuarial').Text  := DS.FieldByName('CompleteActuarial').AsString;
        AddChild('Multiplier').Text := DS.FieldByName('MortalityMultiplier').AsString;
        DS.Next;
      end;

  finally

    DS.Free;

  end;
 with this section, as well as numerous other similarly constructed sections applying to different database tables, executed many times. In this example ANode is an IXMLNode passed in to the function for use as a container. I do not expect the resulting XML file on disk to be more than 10 megabytes. I assume that somehow I'm leaking memory in my creation and disposal of XMLNodes, but I'm not familiar enough with Interfaces to know how to track down my problem.
@CODE:DS := GetDS(Conn, 'SELECT Fields. . . FROM Table WHERE InsuredID = ' +IntToStr(AInsuredID));

  try

    while not DS.Eof do
      with ANode.AddChild('LE') do
      begin
        AddChild('LEProvider').Text := DS.FieldByName('LEProvider').AsString;
        // Need to handle "other" here
        AddChild('Date').Text       := DateToXMLDate(DS.FieldByName('LEDate').AsDateTime);

@TITLE:jQuery appendTo(), json not working in IE 6,7,8
@CONTENT:I've been racking my head for two days trying to find a solution for this. I'm using jQuery.ajax() to grab values from the database to update a box when another box is changed. The php script grabs the values from the database and then spits out json. IT works fine in FF but in all versions of IE the select box doesn't get updated. I've confirmed that the json being output is good. Here is the jquery:     function getVendors(dest,selectSup)
{
    var vend = $('select#sup').val();
    $.ajax({
    	beforeSend: function(){
        $("select#dest").parent().addClass('loading');
    	},
    	type: "GET",
    	dataType: "json",
    	cache: false,
    	url: '/search/cruiseselect/?type=vendors&supplier=' + vend + '&dest=' + dest,
    	timeout: 2000,
    	error: function() {
    	alert("Failed to submit");
    	},
    	success: function(data) { 
    		$("select#sup option").remove();
    		var any = "<option value=\"any\">-- All Cruise Lines --</option>";
    		$(any).appendTo("select#sup");                   
    		$.each(data, function(i, j){  
    			if(j != null && j != undefined) {
    				var sel = j.value == selectSup ? " selected" : "";
    				var row = "<option value=\"" +  j.value + sel + ">" +  j.text +  "</option>";     
    				//$(row).appendTo("select#sup");                  
    				$("select#sup").append(row);
    			}
    		}); 
    	},
    	complete: function(){
        $("select#dest").parent().removeClass('loading');
    	}
    });
}
jQuery(document).ready(function(){

     //dynamic select boxes 
    $("select#dest").change(function(){
    	var selectSup = $("select#sup").children("option:selected").val();
    	getVendors($(this).val(),selectSup);
    }); 
});
 I've got this in my php header('Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate');

header('Expires: Mon, 26 Jul 1997 05:00:00 GMT');

header('Content-type: application/json');


echo json_encode($json);
 And it's outputting the correct json with no extra commas or anything. What's more is that If I use alert(j.value + j.text); in my .each() loop, I get the correct data in IE so it seems that it's the jquery appendTo() that's not working. Anybody got any ideas?
@CODE:function getVendors(dest,selectSup)
{
    var vend = $('select#sup').val();
    $.ajax({
    	beforeSend: function(){
        $("select#dest").parent().addClass('loading');

@TITLE:overriding GetSecurityId in IInternetSecurityManager
@CONTENT:I have built an executable which launches a dialog box in which is embedded the IE web browser active-x control (C++). I want this control to allow cross site scripting. One frame on the web page loads local html, the other loads from a server. I then want the server page to call a javascript function that lives in the local html file. I am trying to achieve this by having the control implement it's own "IInternetSecurityManager" interface in which I am providing my own ProcessUrlAction and GetSecurityId methods. From what I've read, what I need to do is make GetSecurityId return the same domain for all urls. My custom implementations are getting called, but no matter what I do, I get the "Permission denied" error when the server html tries to access script on the local html file.

@TITLE:Writing a stream to the response in ASP.Net
@CONTENT:Ok just want to clarify something with my solution. I have a requirement to grab a file from a respository somewhere, this repository requires a session token to be passed in the form of a cookie along with the request for the file. I am authenticating the user against this repository and storing the session token in the users cookie collection for my application when the user first logs onto my application. Problem is the cookie will not get sent to the repository when a user tried to access a file because the repository is on a different URL and domain. Therefore I am creating a new http request, appending the cookie and getting the response stream back. I now need to send this response stream back to the user, headers and all (as this response stream will contain the headers for the file the user is trying to access) Can I use this:             string session = cookie.Value;
            StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(Utility.GetLinkStream(url, session));
            Context.Response.ClearHeaders();
            Context.Response.Clear();
            Context.Response.Write(reader.ReadToEnd());
 Essentially the call to Utility.GetLinkStream goes off and creates a http request then returns the stream of the response. Will the call to Write write out the whole response headers and all, or is there a better way to acheive this?
@CODE:string session = cookie.Value;
            StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(Utility.GetLinkStream(url, session));
            Context.Response.ClearHeaders();
            Context.Response.Clear();

I need to optimize the images' file sizes as much as possible without loosing image quality. I haven't used jpegtran, jpegoptim, or any other jpeg optimizer directly but I have noticed that punypng shrinks file sizes down about 4-6% on the larger jpeg images LOSSLESSLY. Meta data is already stripped from the images during upload (via jumpoader) so that is not an option/problem anymore. Is there any way to get one of the jpeg optimizers to run from C# code?

@CONTENT:I imagine this is quite a common problem, but as yet I haven't found an elegant solution. I have a number of instances where I have either a ListView or a DetailsView control that is bound to a SQL Server SProc. The problem I have is that there are numerous instances where, when a column is Null, I want to display something different in the UI. A typical example would be where I have a URL column that is rendered as a LinkButton (in the ListViews) or as a HyperLinkField (in the DetailsViews) - when a Null URL is returned, I'm rendering links with no src attribute. Ideally, I's want to display nothing in this field in such a scenario. In each of these cases, when a null value is returned, how can I skip/alter the rendering of that item? Thanks in advance. Update: I haven't had chance to actually try these out, but all helpful suggestions. I think I like Ricks answer the best, but thanks again to the others...

@TITLE:Creating tar archive with national characters in Java
@CONTENT:Do you know some library/way in Java to generate tar archive with file names in proper windows national codepage ( for example cp1250 ). I tried with Java tar, example code: final TarEntry entry = new TarEntry( files[i] );
String filename = files[i].getPath().replaceAll( baseDir, "" );
entry.setName( new String( filename.getBytes(), "Cp1250" ) );
out.putNextEntry( entry );
...
 It doesn't work. National characters are broken where I extract tar in windows. I've also found a strange thing, under Linux Polish national characters are shown correctly only when I used ISO-8859-1: entry.setName( new String( filename.getBytes(), "ISO-8859-1" ) );
 Despite the fact that proper Polish codepage is ISO-8859-2, which doesn't work too. I've also tried Cp852 for windows, no effect. I know the limitations of tar format, but changing it is not an option. Thanks for suggestions,
@CODE:final TarEntry entry = new TarEntry( files[i] );
String filename = files[i].getPath().replaceAll( baseDir, "" );

@TITLE:Opera Mobile 9.7 Beta Set Focus
@CONTENT:We use a handheld scanner to move items in and out of inventory. The scanner runs an ASP page that submits the form to move the item. We recently purchased a new scanner running Windows Mobile 6.1 and soon realized that Mobile IE is completely useless. It does not render tables correctly and worse, it doesn't recognize onblur, onkeypress and many other common javascript functions. We tested out many mobile browsers and found that Opera Mobile 9.7 works great except for setting the focus on an input text field when the page loads. The page has many text fields that and submits the form back to itself for processing. Once one field is scanned (or entered on the keyboard), the form submits itself, process the input and enables the next field on the form. At the end of the markup, select() and focus() are called to select any text in the field and to set focus so all the user has to do is scan the value. Here is what the javascript looks like at the end of the page. document.forms["frm1"].elements["txt1"].select(); document.forms["frm1"].elements["txt1"].focus(); Is there any way to set focus on Opera Mobile 9.7?

Thanks guys, for the quick responses, however, the main stat I need from the files is the tags attribute now included in windows vista, and unfortunately, that isn't included in the os.stat and stat modules.

@TITLE:Best way to deal with object that can't instantiate itself?
@CONTENT:I guess I've asked a few similar questions before, but I was beating around the bush. I think this is the real problem that I can't quite lay to rest. I'm dealing with a third party library, and there's an object that can't create itself, b2Body. The b2World has to instantiate it. I personally don't like this design pattern very much; I think the b2Body should be able to exist independently of the world, and then be added to the world when needed. Anyway, I've wrapped b2Body with my own class class, Body, because I need to add some extra stuff to it anyway. Similarly, I have a World wrapper. Now I figure I have 3 options: Have Body's constructor takes a pointer to World so that it can be fully instantiated (calls b2World::CreateBody somewhere inside) -- i.e. have a constructor like Body *b = new Body(world_ptr) Pass Body to some World::CreateBody method like how the library already does it -- i.e. Body *b = world.CreateBody(params); Duplicate all the data in b2Body so that you can use it however you want, and then after you add it to the world it will 'switch over' to use the b2Body data -- i.e. Body b and later world.addBody(b). (1) and (2) mean that you can't have a Body without a World, which I probably won't need, but it might be nice to have that option [so that I can use it as a template for other objects and such]. Not sure what other pros and cons there are. (3) seems nicer, but it's a lot more work to implement, and it means I have to duplicate most of the data that's already contained in b2Body. What are your thoughts? I'll CW this just so no one frets. I still can't lay this to rest. This is what each of the options would look like: Option 1: (what I prefer) World w;
Body b;
Fixture f;
b.addFixture(f);
w.addBody(b);
 Option 2: (somewhere in the middle) World w;
Body b(w);
Fixture f(b);
 Option 3: (how Box2D does it) World *w = new World;
Body *b = w->CreateBody(args);
Fixture *f = b->CreateFixture(args);
 Options 2 and 3 aren't so different, but it changes who has control over is creating the objects. How would I actually implement option 3 though? World::CreateBody() has to call b2World::CreateBody(args) which calls b2Body::b2Body() and returns b2Body but never calls Body::Body(args) which is a problem. The b2Body would get fully initialized, but my wrapper has no place to do it's thing... More specifically, how would I write World::CreateBody(const BodyDef &bd)? Assuming BodyDef inherited from b2BodyDef, Body from b2Body, World from b2World, etc.
@CODE:b2Body b2World b2Body b2Body Body World Body World b2World::CreateBody Body *b = new Body(world_ptr) Body World::CreateBody Body *b = world.CreateBody(params); b2Body b2Body Body b world.addBody(b) Body World b2Body CW World w;
Body b;
Fixture f;
b.addFixture(f);
w.addBody(b); World w;
Body b(w);
Fixture f(b); World *w = new World;
Body *b = w->CreateBody(args);
Fixture *f = b->CreateFixture(args); World::CreateBody() b2World::CreateBody(args) b2Body::b2Body() b2Body Body::Body(args) b2Body World::CreateBody(const BodyDef &bd)

@TITLE:Can I add a condition to CakePHP's update statement?
@CONTENT:Since there doesn't seem to be any support for optimistic locking in CakePHP, I'm taking a stab at building a behaviour that implements it. After a little research into behaviours, I think I could run a query in the beforeSave event to check that the version field hasn't changed. However, I'd rather implement the check by changing the update statement's WHERE clause from WHERE id = ?
 to WHERE id = ? and version = ?
 This way I don't have to worry about other requests changing the database record between the time I read the version and the time I execute the update. It also means I can do one database call instead of two. I can see that the DboSource.update() method supports conditions, but Model.save() never passes any conditions to it. It seems like I have a couple of options: Do the check in beforeSave() and live with the fact that it's not bulletproof. Hack my local copy of CakePHP to check for a conditions key in the options array of Model.save() and pass it along to the DboSource.update() method. Right now, I'm leaning in favour of the second option, but that means I can't share my behaviour with other users unless they apply my hack to their framework. Have I missed an easier option?

@CONTENT:In the quest to resolve the Objective-C namespace issue I'd like to experiment with prefixing a dependency's Objective-C classes based on the target being built. As an example, suppose I have in my shared library (ObjCStaticLib) a class (CWindow). I have two plugins (A and B) that will use this CWindow. To avoid A's CWindow from colliding with B's CWindow, I want to prefix the CWindow class name at compile time, so A's CWindow becomes ACWindow and B's becomes BCWindow. I'm looking for a way to communicate to ObjCStaticLib at compile time what prefix it should use to compile itself with. I'm thinking about using xcconfigs to specify a preprocessor macro that the leaf target customizes and that ObjCStaticLib uses. However, I'm not aware of a way for a target to "communicate" with a dependency like that. I can modify all the sources/projects/etc involved as necessary to implement per-client namespace customization in a dependency. Does anyone have a good solution for this?

concreteEntity AppleSeed inherits Seed

Given this model, here's my question: Is there any direct way in the Xcode modeler (i.e., from the GUI) that will enable me to specify that Apples can only have AppleSeeds and Oranges can only have OrangeSeeds? In the model above, concrete fruits inherit an abstract Seed relationship, which I need in order to fetch and sort mixed fruits/seeds, but I don't see any way to enforce the exact Seed relationship that each concrete fruit must have. I see lots of different ways to enforce this outside of the modeling GUI, but just want to make sure I'm not missing something. Any suggestions? Hopefully this example makes sense!

@CONTENT:I am in a stage of mapping my CSharp classes into database tables. I have decided to use NHibernate as my ORM tool after comparing with other tools. I have never done a real project with NHibernate before and now am considering alternatives for the mapping, ActiveRecord: according to the project's web site, using ActiveRecord can boost productivity dramatically. However, I do not like the idea of adding attributes to my CSharp classes. After all, my class should NOT have any knowledge of database relationships. By using ActiveRecord will bind my nicely separated classes to ActiveRecord, and give me hard time if I ever want to switch underline DAO Layer implementation in the future. FluentNHibernate: FluentNhibernate was my first attempt when starting mapping. But I also have a few issues with this approach. 1) I don't like my mapping strategies compiled as binary files. I would like to be able to change mapping by modifying xml files. 2) The maturity of FluentNHibernate. NHibernate has been around for a long time, and has LOTS of users, so I am quite comfortable with its maturity. On the contrast, FluentNhibernate is relatively young and not been tested by as many users. Even though I could dive into the source to fix whatever issue comes up, I am not comfortable with my skills to touch the low level implementation. 3) Availability of documentation for FluentNHibernate is much than that of NHibernate. I would like to have a place to go when I hit a hard wall. NHibernate: Currently, I am using naked Nhibernate xml to do the mapping. To be honest, working with XML gives me massive headaches. Literally, I have to keep myself from the impulsion of just throwing away the .hbm.xml files and grab ActiveRecord or FluentNHibernate several times a day. So, here is my dilemma: Should I go with my heart of "Just get this damn thing done!"; Or, should I follow the "Good practice guideline" to suffer the pain now and get relatively easy time later on?

@TITLE:Silverlight ListBox Checkbox Selected Item
@CONTENT:I have a Listbox, that has a Checkbox as part of the item template. In the click even of the Checkbox, I want to make sure that same list item is selected. ListBoxItem lbi = ((ListBoxItem)listLayers.

 The main issue that I'm having is that "ContainerFromElement" is not available in silverlight. Any help is greatly appreciated. Edit This is the code I'm running in the click event of a checkbox inside my list: MyObject obj = listLayers.SelectedItem as MyObject;
obj.Visible = true;
obj.Value = "50";
 Using the RelativeSource binding on the checkboxes along with this code, I end up with obj equal to null. I have a list of layers that I want to turn on and off via checkboxes, I'm open to another way...

@CONTENT:I'm gettint a large amount of data from a database query and I'm making objects of them. I finally have a list of these objects (about 1M of them) and I want to serialize that to disk for later use. Problem is that it barely fits in memory and won't fit in the future, so I need some system to serialize say the first 100k, the next 100k etc; and also to read the data back in in 100k increments. I could make some obvious code that checks if the list gets too big and then wirites it to file 'list1', then 'list2' etc but maybe there's a better way to handle this?

@LINK:/questions/1458825/which-scm-vcs-cope-well-with-moving-text-between-files
@TITLE:Which SCM/VCS cope well with moving text between files?
@CONTENT:We are having havoc with our project at work, because our VCS is doing some awful merging when we move information across files. The scenario is thus: You have lots of files that, say, contain information about terms from a dictionary, so you have a file for each letter of the alphabet. Users entering terms blindly follow the dictionary order, so they will put an entry like "kick the bucket" under B if that is where the dictionary happened to list it (or it might have been listed under both B, bucket and K, kick). Later, other users move the terms to their correct files. Lots of work is being done on the dictionary terms all the time. e.g. User A may have taken the B file and elaborated on the "kick the bucket" entry. User B took the B and K files, and moved the "kick the bucket" entry to the K file. Whichever order they end up getting committed in, the VCS will probably lose entries and not "figure out" that an entry has been moved. (These entries are later automatically converted to an SQL database. But they are kept in a "human friendly" form for working on them, with lots of comments, examples etc. So it is not acceptable to say "make your users enter SQL directly".) It is so bad that we have taken to almost manually merging these kinds of files now, because we can't trust our VCS. :( So what is the solution? I would love to hear that there is a VCS that could cope with this. Or a better merge algorithm? Or otherwise, maybe someone can suggest a better workflow or file arrangement to try and avoid this problem?

@LINK:/questions/1456400/com-create-a-vt-array-with-vt-bstr-values
@TITLE:COM: Create a VT_ARRAY with VT_BSTR values
@CONTENT:I'm a COM newbie and I think what I have is correct, but the runtime doesn't like it. Any help is much appreciated. I need to invoke a COM function that takes in a single dimensional array of BSTRs. Specifically, the documentation says the parameter must be: Function: AddFiles ( [in] VARIANT * filePaths ) filePaths The single-dimensioned array of full paths to each file or folder. filePaths can be of type VT_ARRAY|VT_VARIANT, where each entry is a VT_BSTR, or VT_ARRAY|VT_BSTR. I have a vector<wstring> myPaths of paths which I want to pass into the function that takes the parameter above. Here's the code I wrote. Calling AddFiles on myComObject results in an AV (myComObject is not null, and I can invoke other methods on it):         ...
        VARIANT filePaths;
        VariantInit( &filePaths );
        filePaths.vt = VT_ARRAY|VT_VARIANT;
        filePaths.parray = SafeArrayCreateVector( VT_BSTR, 0, (unsigned int) myPaths.size() );

        long i = 0;
        for( vector<wstring>::iterator it = myPaths.begin();
            it != myPaths.end();
            it++, i++ )
        {
            BSTR myPath= SysAllocString(it->c_str());
            SafeArrayPutElement( filePaths.parray, &i, myPath);
        }

        myComObject->AddFiles( &filePaths );
        ...
 The COM object isn't my code and I can't debug into it, but I suspect I'm not creating that array properly - based on the requirement of the AddFiles function and the code I have, anyone have ideas about what I might be doing wrong?
@CODE:VT_ARRAY|VT_VARIANT VT_BSTR VT_ARRAY|VT_BSTR vector<wstring> myPaths ...
        VARIANT filePaths;
        VariantInit( &filePaths );
        filePaths.vt = VT_ARRAY|VT_VARIANT;
        filePaths.parray = SafeArrayCreateVector( VT_BSTR, 0, (unsigned int) myPaths.size() );

        long i = 0;
        for( vector<wstring>::iterator it = myPaths.begin();
            it != myPaths.end();
            it++, i++ )
        {
            BSTR myPath= SysAllocString(it->c_str());
            SafeArrayPutElement( filePaths.parray, &i, myPath);
        }

@TITLE:Fail-safe way of round-tripping JVM byte-code to text-representation and back
@CONTENT:I'm looking for a fail-safe way to round-trip between a JVM class file and a text representation and back again. One strict requirement is that the resulting round-tripped JVM class file is exactly functionally equivalent to the original JVM class file as long as the text representation is left unchanged. Furthermore, the text representation must be human-readable and editable. It should be possible to make small changes to the the text representation (such as changing a text string or a class name, etc.) which are reflected in the resulting class file representation. The simplest solution would be to use a Java decompiler such as JAD to generate the text representation, which in this case would simply be the re-created Java source code. And then use javac to generate the byte-code. However, given the state of the free Java decompilers this approach does not work under all circumstances. It is rather easy to create obfuscated byte-code that does not survive a full round-trip class-file/java-source/class-file (in part because there simply isn't a 1:1 mapping between JVM byte-code and Java source code). Is there a fail-safe way to achieve JVM class-file/text-representation/class-file round-tripping given the requirements above? Update: Before answering - save time and effort by reading all the requirements above, and note specifically: "Text-representation of JVM bytecode" does not necessarily mean "Java source-code".

Maybe I am using the SqlDataReader incorrectly. Should I be using SqlAdapter instead? What happened to all the good basic tutorials online for windows c# forms? A few months ago I found a couple great tutorials, but they seem to have lost their pageranking and I cannot find them anymore using basic google searches.

 Is anyone able to advise a way of correcting this problem? I believe it is due to MySQL leaving connection poll connections open for up to eight hours but am not certain. Thanks Martin O'Shea. Just to clarify one point made about my method of connection pooling, it isn't Oracle that I'm using in my application but a class of my own as follows: package myDataSharer.database_access;

import java.sql.*;
import javax.sql.DataSource;
import javax.naming.InitialContext;
import org.apache.log4j.Logger;

public class ConnectionPool_DBA {

    static Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(ConnectionPool_DBA.class.getName());

    private static ConnectionPool_DBA pool = null;
    private static DataSource dataSource = null;


    public synchronized static ConnectionPool_DBA getInstance() {
        if (pool == null) {
            pool = new ConnectionPool_DBA();
        }
        return pool;
    }

    private ConnectionPool_DBA() {
        try {
            InitialContext ic = new InitialContext();
            dataSource = (DataSource) ic.lookup("java:/comp/env/jdbc/myDataSharer");
        }
        catch(Exception ex) {
            logger.error("Error getting a connection pool's datasource\n", ex);
        }
    }

    public void freeConnection(Connection c) {
        try {
            c.close();
        }
        catch (Exception ex) {
            logger.error("Error terminating a connection pool connection\n", ex);           
        }
    }

    public Connection getConnection() {
        try {
            return dataSource.getConnection();
        }
        catch (Exception ex) {
            logger.error("Error getting a connection pool connection\n", ex);            
            return null;
        }
    }    
}
 I think the mention of Oracle is due to me using a similar name.

 When we try to make it work over internet it is not able to connect. Program is shown as above only thing is destination ip is replaces by my friends ip. When working over localhost it works perfectly fine but not working over internet ... I have written program using SOCK_DGRAM it works over internet only for small chunks of data. I want to transmit image using it so I have written it using SOCK_STREAM for transmitting image which successfully worked on localhost and was not working over internet. So I did write simplest program but still showing same problem Can somebody please guid me through this...

@TITLE:Getting essid via ioctl in ruby
@CONTENT:To avoid relying on the wireless tools I want to get the essid directly from the device with ioctl, in C this wouldn't be a problem, but in Ruby it's quite different. The problem is following struct from wireless.h that is used as input/reply of ioctl: struct  iw_point
{
  void __user *pointer; /* Pointer to the data  (in user space) */
  __u16   length;   /* number of fields or size in bytes */
  __u16   flags;    /* Optional params */
};
 The pointer part must be a valid address of a memory area, followed by the length in bytes, followed by a flag field. I tried with Array#pack and the bit-struct gem, but haven't found a solution yet. Is there a way to bypass this memory pointer problem?
@CODE:struct  iw_point

@TITLE:Latex Multiline Equations
@CONTENT:Is it possible to get multline like behavior within a gather environment? I have a set of equations in a gather environment, but one of them is too long, and I'd like to split it up onto two lines where the first line is left-aligned and the second line is right-aligned (just like multline). If there is a way of aligning individual lines within the gather or split environment (like flushleft or flushright but functional in mathmode) this would solve the problem.

@TITLE:How do you override a TableAdapter method on a Table in a DataSet?
@CONTENT:I currently have a single DataSet declared which contains 3 tables. For sake of this example we will call them User, Question and Answer. On each of these I have a TableAdapter with the various methods required, ie. GetData(), Update(), Delete() etc. On the Answer Table I would like to override the Update Method from the TableAdapter to add some Parameters which are not part of the table, but I need to pass due to the ObjectDataSource requirement. How do I go about overriding the Update() method on the Answer TableAdapter? In trying to keep the project simple, I don't want to create a separate DAL layer.

@TITLE:Open/Close NHibernate Session
@CONTENT:Using FluentNHibernate in a web application, I've created a singleton SessionFactory class to have the ability of the following: SessionFactory.Instance //returns ISessionFactory
 Is it common/best practice to open/close sessions as follows? using(ISession session = SessionFactory.Instance.OpenSession())
{
    using(ITransaction transaction = session.BeginTransaction())
    {
    	//some operation
    }
}
 The above code would live in the respective repository classes for a given entity. I've noticed there is a theme of creating a HttpModule to open the session at the start and stop of the application, but I'm wondering if this is situational or more common. UPDATE Going forward with the HttpModule, I have a similar thought: With a repository class, I'm basically doing the following(config uses WebSessionContext): using(ISession session = SessionFactory.Instance.GetCurrentSession())
{
    using(ITransaction transaction = session.BeginTransaction())
    {
        //some operation

@CONTENT:I have an Input Method (IME) program built with C#.NET 2.0 DLL through C++/CLI. Since an IME is always attaching to another application, the C#.NET DLL seems not able to avoid image address rebasing. Although I have applied ngen to create a native image of that C#.NET 2.0 DLL and installed it into Global Assembly Cache, it didn't improved much, approximately 12 sec. down to 9 sec. on a slow PIII level PC. Therefore I uses a small application, which loads all the components referenced by the C#.NET DLL at the boot up time, to "warm up" the native image of that DLL. It works fine to speed up the loading time to 0.5 sec. However, it only worked for a while. About 30 min. later, it seems to "cool down" again. Is there any way to control the behavior of GAC or native image to be always "hot"? Is this exactly a image address rebasing problem? Thank you for your precious time. Sincerely, Mike

@CONTENT:I am having an issue trying to communicate between a python TCP server and a c++ TCP client. After the first call, which works fine, the subsequent calls cause issues. As far as WinSock is concerned, the send() function worked properly, it returns the proper length and WSAGetLastError() does not return anything of significance. However, when watching the packets using wireshark, i notice that the first call sends two packets, a PSH,ACK with all of the data in it, and an ACK right after, but the subsequent calls, which don't work, only send the PSH,ACK packet, and not a subsequent ACK packet the receiving computers wireshark corroborates this, and the python server does nothing, it doesnt have any data coming out of the socket, and i cannot debug deeper, since socket is a native class when i run a c++ client and a c++ server (a hacked replica of what the python one would do), the client faithfully sends both the PSH,ACk and ACK packets the whole time, even after the first call. Is the winsock send function supposed to always send a PSH,ACK and an ACK? If so, why would it do so when connected to my C++ server and not the python server? Has anyone had any issues similar to this?

As of .NET 3.0, I think there is no longer a separate ".NET Framework SDK". Instead if I want the free SDK stuff - all the .NET command line tools, all the base class libraries - then I can download the Windows SDK, and install the .NET portion of it. I will also get the msbuild tool if I do this. (Right?) Now to my questions: Will I get msbuild if I install one or more parts of the Windows SDK that does not include the .NET SDK? Will I get nmake, too? If I don't have Visual Studio installed, will MSBuild be able to build a .sln file that references a .vcproj file?

@TITLE:What are some good resources for introducing a team of VB6 developers to the Object Oriented paradigm?
@CONTENT:The team is familiar with ASP.NET and has been working in VB.NET for several years, but they just haven't made the transition in thinking in terms of objects. In fact, they may be a little intimidated by OOP from brief glimpses they've seen of C++ and unmanaged environments. Work has kept them busy enough that they haven't had time to properly absorb the benefits that .NET and OOP provides. I'm looking for some lightweight resources (i.e.: blog posts, articles) that I can share with both developers and/or managers which would help to introduce the object oriented paradigm in a nicely presented fashon. The language could be in either C# or VB.NET, though VB.NET would be preferred. Thanks!

@CONTENT:I'm developing an asp.net intranet website with a ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider and a SqlProfileProvider. One of the requirements of my website is to have a "Birthdays" page, which would require me to list all profiles and retrieving the birthday information from it. I approached the problem as follows: Invoke the Membership.GetAllUsers() static method; Iterate through the list of users and retrieve the profile from the member's user name This approach, however, failed for the following reasons: The webapp is impersonating the current logged user to retrieve its AD details (identity impersonate="true" in the web.config), so I get an exception "access is denied" when trying to invoke the GetAllUsers If I do try to make the webapp impersonate a super user account then AD returns the user names as username@domain-name format, but in my profile provider they were initially stored as domain-name\username format. So, how would you go around this problem to retrieve the whole list of profiles for any member of the organization?

@CONTENT:I am researching a way to work filtering specific pages by IP and redirect them on a different page. The code below, did not work properly. RewriteCond %{REMOTE_ADDR} ^/192.168.10.*
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/support
RewriteRule ^/.* http://www.yahoo.com/gone [R,NE]
 Once the link http://example.com/support has been accessed and they're on the 192.168.10.* block, it must go to the yahoo.com example page. But, like I said. It just did nothing. Any ideas why it did not work correctly?

@TITLE:Air XmlHttpRequest time out if remote server is offline?
@CONTENT:I'm writing an AIR application that communicates with a server via XmlHttpRequest. The problem that I'm having is that if the server is unreachable, my asynchronous XmlHttpRequest never seems to fail. My onreadystatechange handler detects the OPENED state, but nothing else. Is there a way to make the XmlHttpRequest time out? Do I have to do something silly like using setTimeout() to wait a while then abort() if the connection isn't established? Edit: Found this, but in my testing, wrapping my xmlhttprequest.send() in a try/catch block or setting a value on xmlhttprequest.timeout (or TimeOut or timeOut) doesn't have any affect.

@TITLE:How can I detect if the screen is locked or screensaver is active from the Terminal in OS X 10.6?
@CONTENT:Due to the new limitations of Kerberos in OS X 10.6, I'm working on a script that offers similar functionality to what used to be available in 10.5. Essentially it parses the klist output to see if your ticket is expiring and displays how long until it expires. If we hit the 10 minute mark, it calls kinit to do a GUI password prompt to ask for your kerberos password. If the ticket is expired it does the same thing. The script makes sure that kinit is not running before calling it again so we don't have multiple kinit calls, and the script works really great (called out of GeekLog so you can see the status). Problem is this morning my system was giving the spinning beachball when I went to unlock the screen. I am suspecting my script and/or kinit from doing something; the machine was available via ping, but otherwise unresponsive to ssh or AFP. So what I want to do is detect whether or not the screen is locked or the screensaver is engaged. I've found that on previous versions of OS X, you could grep for ScreenSaverEngine to determine whether it was active or not, but that doesn't seem to be the case any longer. So how can I determine if the screen is locked or otherwise engaged using commandline tools? If the screen is locked, I want the script to simply exit so it doesn't bother with the klist or try to do a kinit. I'm hoping that will prevent the lockup I experienced this morning. Any ideas?

 I expect that both text and binary files can be downloaded using the binary mode. However it looks like text files contents is messed up while zip files are downloaded correctly.

String.class_eval("def len; size; end")

So far I have gotten down the whole process of discovering the device and its services, pairing with it, connecting to it and now I want to send some actual commands, but I'm having some trouble with it. Below is an graphic from the spec for the AVRCP profile that I'm trying to use. You can view the pdf here. I believe I need to write an 5 byte value as shown by the image: Here is the method I have right now that writes the data: - (void)l2capChannelOpenComplete:(IOBluetoothL2CAPChannel*)l2capChannel status:(IOReturn)error {
    NSLog(@"Open Complete");
    NSMutableData *playData = [[NSMutableData alloc] initWithCapacity:5];

    unsigned char opcode = 0x7C;
    unsigned char opid = 0x44;

    [playData appendBytes:&opdata length:8];

    usleep(1000);

    [l2capChannel writeAsync:[playData mutableBytes] length:40 refcon:nil];
}
 When that function runs the devices responds with the following hexadecimal value 0x400010. I'm not even sure I'm approaching this correctly! Are the values I'm sending correct according the example in the image? Any help in my endeavor to learn here would be much appreciated!

UPDATE As answered below that repository pattern will help me a lot, i checked nerd dinner website and understood it, but i found this code inside: public class DinnersController : Controller {

 Which means as i understood that it declare a dinnerRepository using the interface IDinnerRepository , and in the constructor gave it the DinnerRepository, which will be in my case for example the linq to sql implementation, My question is if i need to switch to ado.net entity framework, i will need to edit this constructor line or there is a better solution for this? Update 2 Where should i put this Respository Interface and the classes which implement it in my solution, in the data access layer or in the business layer?

 Can somebody help me to understand why WSDL is making SoapUI send the arguments as a list of simple arguments, instead of a single complex argument? EDIT: It might be some problem with sequence tag, but I can't find the issue in that, just need some light. Thanks in advance!

@TITLE:How are array and pointer types handled internally in C compilers? ( int *a; vs. int a[]; )
@CONTENT:I need a language lawyer with authoritative sources. Take a look at the following test program which compiles cleanly under gcc: #include <stdio.h>


void foo(int *a) {
    a[98] = 0xFEADFACE;
}

void bar(int b[]) {
    *(b+498) = 0xFEADFACE;
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {

int a[100], b[500], *a_p;

*(a+99) = 0xDEADBEEF;
*(b+499) = *(a+99);

foo(a);
bar(b);

printf("a[98] == %X\na[99] == %X\n", a[98], a[99]);
printf("b[498] == %X\nb[499] == %X\n", b[498], b[499]);

a_p = a+98;
*a_p = 0xDEADFACE;

printf("a[98] == %X\na[99] == %X\n", a[98], a[99]);

}
 It produces the output I expect: anon@anon:~/study/test_code$ gcc arrayType.c -o arrayType
anon@anon:~/study/test_code$ ./arrayType 
a[98] == FEADFACE
a[99] == DEADBEEF
b[498] == FEADFACE
b[499] == DEADBEEF
a[98] == DEADFACE
a[99] == DEADBEEF
 Are a and b the same type? Is int *a handled as the same type as int a[] internally in the compiler? From a practical point of view int a[100], b[500], *a_p, b_a[]; all seem to be the same type. It's hard for me to believe that the compiler is constantly adjusting these types in the various circumstances in my above example. I'm happy to be proven wrong. Can someone settle this question for me definitively and in detail ?

@TITLE:Is it possible to generate a global list of marked strings at compile time/runtime?
@CONTENT:So, I'm working on translating my C++ app into multiple languages. What I'm currently using is something like: #define TR(x) (lookupTranslatedString( currentLocale(), x ))
wcout << TR(L"This phrase is in English") << endl;
 The translations are from a CSV file which maps the english string to the translated string. "This phrase is in English","Nasa Tagalog itong pagsabi"
 This is simplified, but that's the basic idea. My question is about generating the list of English phrases that need to be translated. I just need the CSV with all the english phrases, and blank translated phrases. I was hoping that it might be possible to either generate this list at compile time or at runtime. At compiletime I was thinking something like this: #define TR(x) \
    #warning x \
    (lookupTranslatedString( currentLocale(), x ))
 and then maybe parse the compile log, or something. This seems not to work so well. At runtime would also be great. I was thinking of just starting the app and having a hidden command that would dump the english CSV. I've seen similar methods used to register commands with a central list, using global variables. It might look something like this: class TrString
{
public:
    static std::set< std::wstring > sEnglishPhrases;
    TrString( std::wstring english_phrase ) { sEnglishPhrases.insert( english_phrase ); }
};

#define TR(x) do {static TrString trstr(x);} while( false ); (lookupTranslatedString( currentLocale(), x ));
 I know there's two problems with the above code. I doubt it compiles, but more importantly, in order to generate a list of all english phrases, I'd need to hit every single code path before accessing sEnglishPhrases. It looks like I'll end up writing a small parser to read through all my code and look for TR strings, which isn't really that tough. I was just hoping to learn a little more about C++, and if there's a better way to do this.
@CODE:#define TR(x) (lookupTranslatedString( currentLocale(), x ))
wcout << TR(L"This phrase is in English") << endl; "This phrase is in English","Nasa Tagalog itong pagsabi" #define TR(x) \

    (lookupTranslatedString( currentLocale(), x )) class TrString

    static std::set< std::wstring > sEnglishPhrases;
    TrString( std::wstring english_phrase ) { sEnglishPhrases.insert( english_phrase ); }
};

 In development mode, every time I try to upload the image via Django admin, I keep getting: Upload a valid image. The file you uploaded was either not an image or a corrupted image.
 The jpg I'm trying to upload can be viewed with os X Preview so it would seem to be valid. It seems the problem is Python Imaging Library doesn't recognize it as an image. Why would that be happening with a valid image? PIL is installed, verified via the Django shell.
@CODE:class ImageMain(models.Model):
"""This is the Main Image of the product"""
    product = models.ForeignKey(Product)
    photo = models.ImageField(upload_to='products') Upload a valid image. The file you uploaded was either not an image or a corrupted image.

@LINK:/questions/1368070/silverlight-listbox-item-style
@TITLE:Silverlight Listbox Item Style
@CONTENT:How would one go about styling a listbox such that the selection has a different text color than the default view? I've looked at this in several ways and because the ContentPresenter lacks a Foreground property. The default control template of the listbox provides several rectangles which one can use to adjust the highlight color. For example, with the default style a rectangle called BGColor3 has its opacity adjusted to get a highlight effect. Here is the bulk of my control template: <Grid>
    <Rectangle x:Name="BGColor2" Fill="{StaticResource HoverBrush}" Stroke="Black" StrokeThickness="1" Opacity="0"/>
    <Rectangle x:Name="BGColor3" Fill="{StaticResource ListboxHighlightBrush}" StrokeThickness="0" Opacity="0"/>
    <Rectangle x:Name="BGColor" Stroke="Black" StrokeThickness="0" Opacity="0.2" Fill="{TemplateBinding Background}"/>
    <Border Height="20">
    	<ContentPresenter HorizontalAlignment="Left" Margin="{TemplateBinding Padding}" x:Name="contentPresenter" Content="{TemplateBinding Content}" ContentTemplate="{TemplateBinding ContentTemplate}"/>
    </Border>
    <Rectangle Fill="Blue" Opacity="0.4" x:Name="FocusVisual" Stroke="#BF313131" Margin="1" StrokeThickness="1" StrokeDashArray="1 2" StrokeDashCap="Square" Visibility="Collapsed" />
    <Rectangle x:Name="BorderRect" Stroke="Black" StrokeThickness="1" Opacity="0.3" />
</Grid>
 In the selection Visual State, here is the gist: <VisualStateGroup x:Name="SelectionStates">
    <VisualState x:Name="Unselected"/>
    <VisualState x:Name="Selected">
    	<Storyboard>
    		<DoubleAnimationUsingKeyFrames BeginTime="00:00:00" Duration="00:00:00.0010000" Storyboard.TargetName="BGColor2" Storyboard.TargetProperty="(UIElement.Opacity)">
    			<SplineDoubleKeyFrame KeyTime="00:00:00" Value="0.8"/>
    		</DoubleAnimationUsingKeyFrames>
    	</Storyboard>
    </VisualState>
</VisualStateGroup>
 What is evident is that BGColor2 the rectangle is being modified (opacity) so that the selected item has a background. Fair enough. Within this portion of the Storyboard, is there anyway to access either the ContentPresenter or something else similar and toggling the text foreground color? Footnote: wouldn't it be much cleaner to simply have different templates versus visual state transitions? ---- added after first answer given ---- Using a TextBlock almost does the trick but what's interesting is that the transition for SelectedUnfocused does not appear to be enforced which is to say that implementing your solution works perfectly until a person mouses over a previously selected item then the text once again goes to black. Here is my template: <!-- ItemStyle brushes -->

@TITLE:MKMapView setRegion: odd behavior?
@CONTENT:I'm working on a 3-tabbed iPhone app., where I want each tab's view to look like it shares the same map. So at the moment, I'm just trying to figure out how to reset each view's MKMapView's region when one clicks on a new tab. [In other words, if you're on tab 1 and zoomed all the way in on a spot, then click on tab 2, I want it to show the same, zoomed in map.] To do this, I have an MKCoordinateRegion in the app delegate that each view saves to before it goes away, and that each new view reads from before it is viewed. [In other words, my app delegate is my TabBarControllerDelegate and I've overridden tabBarController: shouldSelectViewController:. This function is called after someone clicks on a tab button, and before the new tab's view's viewWillAppear: function is called. So, in this function, I save the region of the current view to my AppDelegate::MKCoordinateRegion variable, and then let the new view's viewWillAppear: (or viewDidLoad:) get called. Then, in the new view's viewWillAppear:, I get the MKCoordinateRegion from the app delegate, and assign it to my new view's region.] However, the values from MKMapKit::setRegion: don't seem to be consistent and I don't know if I'm just doing something wrong, missing something entirely, or if something else is going on. I've only been doing iPhone dev. (and Obj-c, etc.) for about 2 weeks now, so this very well just could be a newby mistake. And if so, I will go ahead and apologize now for wasting your time. Nonetheless, here's some code (and I've left in the comments I was using...just in case you try running it yourself): iPhoneTestAppDelegate.h ...

 Now, the first thing I notice when I run this is that when the initial view's viewDidLoad: is called, the delegate's region and my new view's region are the same (after I call setRegion:). However, after setRegion: is called in viewWillAppear:, my view's MKMapView's region is no longer equal to the delegates. Somehow, the exact same code in viewDidLoad: produces a different result when run in viewWillAppear:! Shouldn't that not be the case? Why does calling setRegion: from viewWillAppear: change the values of my view's MKMapView's region? Does this have something to do with regionThatFits: being called internally? I don't get it! However, I kind of think that if I can figure that part out, I might be able to figure out the other issues; so, I won't go into more details here. But, if you make a quick app. with these functions and run it, you'll see the issues. Mainly, the view's maps are occasionally in synch, but as you zoom and move around (and keep switching back and forth between tabs), the span starts to shrink and each new tab press just keeps zooming me farther and farther out. Note: I'm only running this on the simulator (3.0) [I don't have the hardware yet], so I don't know if that has anything to do with it. But, I kind of doubt it. Anyway, thanks for any help you can offer. I really appreciate it.

@TITLE:LinqToXml does not handle nillable elements as expected
@CONTENT:According to W3C standards, if you have a nillable element with a nil value, you are supposed to format it like this: <myNillableElement xsi:nil="true" />
 But if you use this LinqToXml statement... element.Add(
    new XElement(ns + "myNillableElement", null);
 ...the resulting XML is... <myNillableElement />
 ...which is invalid. And not just invalid according to W3C, invalid according to Microsoft's own XML/XSD validator. So, next time you validate your XML, you get errors. Am I missing some switch that can turn on correct handling of nillable elements? Thanks.

@TITLE:Performance of comparisons in C++ ( foo >= 0 vs. foo != 0 )
@CONTENT:I've been working on a piece of code recently where performance is very important, and essentially I have the following situation: int len = some_very_big_number;
int counter = some_rather_small_number;

for( int i = len; i >= 0; --i ){
    while( counter > 0 && costly other stuff here ){
        /* do stuff */
        --counter;
    }
    /* do more stuff */
}
 So here I have a loop that runs very often and for a certain number of runs the while block will be executed as well until the variable counter is reduced to zero and then the while loop will not be called because the first expression will be false. The question is now, if there is a difference in performance between using counter > 0 and counter != 0? I suspect there would be, does anyone know specifics about this.

int counter = some_rather_small_number;

@TITLE:Why Linq can't translate expression/treat as local expression and throws an exception?
@CONTENT:I asked a question here about an Linq error that results from mixing Linq-To-SQL with C# code. In brief, the compiler gets confused and doesn't realize that you are intending to call a local function on the resultset after it's come back from the database. The answer I accepted was to use AsEnumerable() on the result set, thus forcing it to return all columns before doing any further calculations. My problem now is that in a very similar way, I am now trying to invoke a method of an object that is related to my resultset via a foreign key, e.g.: var q =
  from c in MyCities.AsEnumerable() // note the AsEnumerable, forcing the query to execute before accessing properties of c
  let cy = c.County
  select new { CityName = c.Name, CountyName = cy.Name, CountyFoo = cy.Foo() };
 And guess what - this throws that ol' exception again. Why? Clearly because we need to go back to the database again in order to load the related County of c. Only this time, I can't call AsEnumerable(), because c has only one County, not a collection! Dwat that wascawwy wabbit! How do I get around this one?
@CODE:AsEnumerable() var q =
  from c in MyCities.AsEnumerable() // note the AsEnumerable, forcing the query to execute before accessing properties of c
  let cy = c.County
  select new { CityName = c.Name, CountyName = cy.Name, CountyFoo = cy.Foo() }; County c AsEnumerable() c

@TITLE:Fetch HTTP response header/redirect status with PHP
@CONTENT:Hej there, I am currently working on a PHP-based Tool to monitor a rather large number of URLs and their redirect status. I have spent quite some time on finding the best way to fetch the content of the HTTP response headers to extract the current redirect code and location. This is how it's done at the moment: $resource = fopen( $url, 'r' );
$metadata = stream_get_meta_data( $resource );
$metadata = $metadata['wrapper_data'];

// Looping through the array to find the necessary fields
 This works on 95% of the URLs I'm monitoring. For a few more I have solved it by parsing the actual HTML the website returns before the redirect is executed since it contained something like "This website has been moved here". This does not seem to be a very robust solution, but it helped in a few cases. This still leaves me with a number of URLs I can not check automatically. Tools like Ask Apache HTTP Headers Tool seem to be more reliable and I was wondering what could be a better way to obtain the redirect information?

@TITLE:Invoking FindBugs from Ant: passing a space-separated list of files to java
@CONTENT:I'm trying to invoke FindBugs from inside Ant. In order to control the amount of memory available to FindBugs, I've chosen not to use the ant-task. The problem I have now is that I want to pass a number of jars on the command-line to FindBugs: java -jar .../findbugs.jar foo.jar bar.jar fie.jar
 However, since these jars actually are Eclipse plugins, I don't know the exact name of the jars so I need a way to use a wildcard to obtain the list. This is what I've come up with: <target name="findbugs">
	<property name="findbugs.home" location="${user.home}/eclipse/findbugs" />
	<path id="findbugs.input">
		<fileset dir="${testDirectory}/eclipse/plugins">
			<include name="my.plugins.*.jar" />
		</fileset>
	</path>
	<path id="findbugs.auxinput">
		<fileset dir="${testDirectory}/eclipse/plugins">
			<include name="*.jar" />
			<include name="**/*.jar" />
		</fileset>
	</path>
	<java jar="${findbugs.home}/lib/findbugs.jar" fork="true">

		<arg value="-textui" />
		<arg value="-output" />

		<arg value="-auxclasspath" />
		<arg pathref="findbugs.auxinput"/>
		<arg pathref="findbugs.input" />
	</java>
</target>
 However, the findbugs.input pathref is a comma-separated list of jars, and not space-separated as FindBugs wants it. How do I get the list of jars as a space-separated list? (Is this perhaps easier to do with the FindBugs ant-task. I can't really tell from the documentation.)
@CODE:java -jar .../findbugs.jar foo.jar bar.jar fie.jar <target name="findbugs">

What I am trying to do, is if "off" is selected from the category[0] select element, I would like to disable the category[1] element. I have been trying to use document.getElementsByName() but am having no luck figuring out how to specifically target the category[1] array. See below for example code. <select name='category[0]'>
    <option value='0'>off</option>
    <option value='1'>on</option>
</select>

<select name='category[1]'></select>
 My question is how can I modify the properties of an HTML object that is an array? I understand I could do this easily using ID's but I would like to learn how to do this using an array. Thanks
@CODE:<select name='category[0]'>
    <option value='0'>off</option>
    <option value='1'>on</option>
</select>

<select name='category[1]'></select>

@TITLE:InputManager plug-ins in Snow Leopard (OS X 10.6)
@CONTENT:I'm getting conflicting reports from various places.?Engadget's review says InputManager plug-ins being completely ignored (and causing strange behaviour if the application is loaded in 32-bit mode), but this mailing list thread says they will work if the 32/64-bit compatibility is right. So I have two questions: Do we get to use InputManagers in Snow Leopard? If yes, will it work the same way as in Leopard. And if no, what is good a workaround (because 1Password is apparently working on a fix)?

@TITLE:Problem with Covariant return types from an abstract method
@CONTENT:I・m trying to wrap up a two day beat down on Abstract methods and return type Covariance, I・ve already posted two similar questions and I am eternally grateful to the community for the info provided, I just need one last push to get to the finish line. Here is what I am trying to do: 2 abstract classes, RecruiterBase and CandidateBase, both have concreate implementations of RecruiterA and CandidateA. RecruiterBase has an abstract method to get all recruited candidates returning IQueryable. My implementation of RecruiterA overrides the GetCandidates() method to return IQueryable. public abstract class RecruiterBase
{ 
  // Constructors declared here

  public abstract IQueryable<CandidateBase> GetCandidates();
}

public abstract class CandidateBase
{  
  // Constructors declared here
}
 and the implementations: public class CandidateA : CandidateBase
{
  // Constructors declared here
}

public class RecruiterA : RecruiterBase
{
  // Constructors declared here

  // ----HERE IS WHERE I AM BREAKING DOWN----
  public override IQueryable<CandidateA> GetCandidates()
  {
     return from c in db.Candidates
            where c.RecruiterId == this.RecruiterId
            select new CandidateA
            {
              CandidateId = c.CandidateId,
              CandidateName = c.CandidateName,
              RecruiterId = c.RecruiterId
            };
  }
}
 Attempting to complile that throw a compile time error because in my implementation of RecruitreBase the GetCandidates() method returns IQueryable<CandidateA> instead of IQueryable<CandidateBase>. After not being able to get the suggestions from a previous question (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1330473/generic-return-types-from-abstract-virtual-methods) to work, I did a LOT more reading, and came across the following question in SO http://stackoverflow.com/questions/421851/how-to-return-subtype-in-overridden-method-of-subclass-in-c Which finally made me realize what I had been searching for was a way to implement Covariance for my return type. I used Marc Gravell's snippet... abstract class BaseClass
{
    public BaseReturnType PolymorphicMethod()
    { return PolymorphicMethodCore();}

    protected abstract BaseReturnType PolymorphicMethodCore();
}

class DerivedClass : BaseClass
{
    protected override BaseReturnType PolymorphicMethodCore()
    { return PolymorphicMethod(); }

    public new DerivedReturnType PolymorphicMethod()
    { return new DerivedReturnType(); }
}
 ... as the basis for my solution. So now my RecruiterBase and RecruiterA classes look like: public abstract class RecruiterBase
{
  // Constructors declared here

  public IQueryable<CandidateBase> GetCandidates()
  {
     return GetCandidatesCore();
  }

  public abstract IQueryable<CandidateBase> GetCandidatesCore();
}
 and my implementation... public class RecruiterA : RecruiterBase
{
  // Constructors

  protected override IQueryable<CandidateBase> GetCandidatesCore()
  {
    return GetCandidates();
  }

  public new IQueryable<CandidateA> GetCandidates()
  {
    return from candidates in db.Candidates
           select new CandidateA
           {
             CandidateId = candidates.CandidateId,
             RecruiterId = candidates.RecruiterId
           };
  }
}
 I was hoping that would finally get me what I was looking for but I got a compile time error in the following code because GetCandidates() cannot implicitly convert CandidateA to CandidateBase:   protected override IQueryable<CandidateBase> GetCandidatesCore()
  {
    return GetCandidates();
  }
 so I added a cast:   protected override IQueryable<CandidateBase> GetCandidatesCore()
  {
    return ((IQueryable<CandidateBase>)GetCandidates());
  }
 Everything then compiles but when I actually call GetCandidates() in my controller it returns IQueryable<CandidateBase> instead of IQueryable<CandidateA>. So I am right back where I started. If you made it all the way through this and you can help me I'll send you a 12 pack of your favorite beer!

@TITLE:Python: Alternatives to pickling a module
@CONTENT:I am working on my program, GarlicSim, in which a user creates a simulation, then he is able to manipulate it as he desires, and then he can save it to file. I recently tried implementing the saving feature. The natural thing that occured to me is to pickle the Project object, which contains the entire simulation. Problem is, the Project object also includes a module-- That is the "simulation package", which is a package/module that contains several critical objects, mostly functions, that define the simulation. I need to save them together with the simulation, but it seems that it is impossible to pickle a module, as I witnessed when I tried to pickle the Project object and an exception was raised. What would be a good way to work around that limitation? (I should also note that the simulation package gets imported dynamically in the program.)

@TITLE:Extending Sanderson's custom mvc ModelBinder for an object stored in session
@CONTENT:In his wonderful MVC book Steven Sanderson gives an example of a custom model binder that sets and retrieves a session variable, hiding the data storage element from the controller. I'm trying to extend this to cater for a pretty common scenario: I'm storing a User object in the session and making this available to every action method as a parameter. Sanderson's class worked ok when the User details weren't changing, but now i need to let the user edit their details and save the amended object back to the session. My problem is that I can't work out how to distinguish a GET from a POST other than by checking the number of keys in bindingContext.ValueProvider.Keys, and this seems so wrong I'm sure I'm misunderstanding something. Can anyone point me in the right direction? Basically all Actions need access to the current user, and the UpdateMyDetails action needs to update that same object, all backed by the Session. Here's my code... public class CurrentUserModelBinder : IModelBinder
{
    private const string userSessionKey = "_currentuser";
    public object BindModel(ControllerContext controllerContext, ModelBindingContext bindingContext) {

@TITLE:iPhone Development - SVG image in UIWebView
@CONTENT:I'm trying to display an svg graph with associated javascript in my application using UIWebView. The .svg file is stored locally. The problem i'm facing is that the zoom in/out and scrolling is horrible. This happens with large images. I've tested this in simulator. Does anyone know the reason? I've tested quite a few svg graphs using iPhone's Safari App and they render perfectly, and zoom in/out plus scrolling works perfectly (without any jitters) - even for 4-5 MB graphs. The code is very basic: NSString *path = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"image" ofType:@"svg"];
NSURL *fileURL = [[NSURL alloc] initFileURLWithPath:path];
NSURLRequest *req = [NSURLRequest requestWithURL:fileURL];
[webView setScalesPageToFit:YES];
[webView loadRequest:req];
 Am i doing something wrong here, or am i not doing something that i should? Note: I haven't tested this on the device. Thanking in anticipation, Mustafa

@TITLE:Parsing slightly off-kilter XML in C# with XmlSeralizer
@CONTENT:I've been given some "XML" files that don't quite have a proper schema (I think that's the problem) and the medical device that generates them cannot be changed to generate easy-to-parse XML. (With such a tantalizingly small modification (extra wrapping Images tags around the Image entries) it would be trivial to read these files---isn't that what XML is about?) Basically I'm stuck here. The XML looks like this: <Series>
   <Metadata1>foo</Metadata1>
   <Metadata2>bar</Metadata2>
   ...
   <Image>...</Image>
   <Image>...</Image>
   ...
</Series>
 (there can be any number of images but the possible Metadata tags are all known). My code looks like this: public class Image { ... }

public class Series : List<Image>
{
	public Series() { }
	public string Metadata1;
	public string Metadata2;
	...
}
 When I run this like so:     		XmlSerializer xs = new XmlSerializer(typeof(Series));
    		StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(path);
    		Series series = (Series)xs.Deserialize(sr);
    		sr.Close();
 the List of Image objects reads properly into the series object but no Metadata1/2/etc fields are read (in fact, browsing the object in the debugger shows all of the metadata fields inside of a "Raw View" sort of field). When I change the code: public class Series    // // removed this : List<Image>
{
	public Series() { }
	public string Metadata1;
	public string Metadata2;
	...
}
 and run the reader on the file, I get a series object with Metadata1/2/etc. filled in perfectly but no Image data being read (obviously). How do I parse both Metadata1/2/etc. and the series of Images with the least amount of painful ad hoc code? Do I have to write some custom (painful? easy?) ReadXML method to implement IXMLSeralizable? I don't care too much how the objects are laid out since my software that consumes these C# classes is totally flexible: List<Image> Images; for the images would be fine, or perhaps the metadata is wrapped in some object, whatever...
@CODE:<Series>
   <Metadata1>foo</Metadata1>
   <Metadata2>bar</Metadata2>
   ...
   <Image>...</Image>
   <Image>...</Image>
   ...
</Series> public class Image { ... }

public class Series : List<Image>
{
	public Series() { }
	public string Metadata1;
	public string Metadata2;
	...
} XmlSerializer xs = new XmlSerializer(typeof(Series));
    		StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(path);
    		Series series = (Series)xs.Deserialize(sr);
    		sr.Close(); public class Series    // // removed this : List<Image>
{
	public Series() { }
	public string Metadata1;
	public string Metadata2;

@TITLE:Programmatically call @Controller
@CONTENT:I am transitioning code that used implementations of Spring MVC's Controller to use the annotation stereotype @Controller. Everything is going fine except for one issue: Given a request/response, how do I programmatically handle requests for annotation-based controllers? Previously, (regardless of implementation) I was able to call: controller.handleRequest(request, response)
 What is the equivalent with annotations? I had assumed there would be some (perhaps static?) utility class along the lines of: SpringAnnotationBasedControllerUtils.handleRequest(<? extends @Controller> handlerObject, HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response);
 to handle the details of mapping a request to the dynamic signatures allowed by the @Controller stereotype, but I can't find such a thing. Any suggestions? (Please no comments on why this is a bad idea or should be unnecessary with a "good" design, etc. This is code under maintenance and must be as noninvasive as possible so a complete re-write is not an option at this time.) Thanks!

Two major differences between the two workstations are: - one is x86 and had no VS installation before installing SQL Server 2008 Express - the other one is x64 and had VS2005 and VS2008 previously installed I feel like on the second workstation the SQL Server installer updated VS2005 instead of VS2008. My understanding is that rdlc files are more recent and somehow probably better, but I'd like to edit rdl file for compatibility purpose and also because I'm used to this user interface. Any advice? Many thanks.

@TITLE:How does IBM's RDZ running on a PC access the mainframe's file system?
@CONTENT:I hear repeatedly that while NFS-style files systems are available on IBM mainframes, they are often not enabled, presumably to minimize the security risks of the mainframe vis-a-vis the rest of the world. Given that I'd like to produce PC-based tools that reach out and process files on the mainframe, this makes a simple problem ("open NFS file '\mainframe\foo'") much harder; what can I count on to provide file system access in a networked enviroment? (Linux systems offer NFS via Samba pretty much as standard, so this is easy). IBM offers Rational Developer for Z, an Eclipse variant used by IBM COBOL programmers. RDZ seems to have direct access to the IBM mainframe file system. What are they using to do that? Why isn't that available to me, and if it is, what is it?

@CONTENT:I have a massive number of shell commands being executed with root/admin priveleges through Authorization Services' "AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges" call. The issue is that after a while (10-15 seconds, maybe 100 shell commands) the program stops responding with this error in the debugger: couldn't fork: errno 35 And then while the app is running, I cannot launch any more applications. I researched this issue and apparently it means that there are no more threads available for the system to use. However, I checked using Activity Monitor and my app is only using 4-5 threads. To fix this problem, I think what I need to do is separate the shell commands into a separate thread (away from the main thread). I have never used threading before, and I'm unsure where to start (no comprehensive examples I could find) Thanks

@TITLE:Rails XML builder with no pretty-printing (i.e. minified XML)
@CONTENT:I am using Builder::XmlMarkup to produce data structures in XML format for a RESTful API server. Recently, I discovered a bug where the pretty-printing from Builder::XmlMarkup produced an element full of whitespace text instead of an empty element as it should. For example, this code: xml.outertag do
  xml.list do
    # Some code which loops through a list
  end
end
 is producing: <outertag>
  <list>
  </list>
</outertag>
 When the inner list is an empty list, the element must be emptyXi.e. <list/> or <list></list>. However the actual XML is a <list> tag filled with a newline and other whitespace. So, how can I eliminate Builder pretty-printing altogether? Currently, I am thinking of monkey-patching Builder::XmlMarkup so that initialize ignores the :indent parameters; although I'm considering an after_filter as well.

@LINK:/questions/1309100/wpf-design-question-custom-control-or-mvvm
@TITLE:WPF design question (custom control or mvvm)
@CONTENT:Here is the scenario: I have a visual that displays some data The data to the visual can come in one of two ways Via user input through the keyboard or mouse Via some backend source Both these data inputs can be of one of two forms Control data or Raw data for simple display Control data causes changes in the visual Raw data is simply showed as is In other words, the view is being served by two masters, viz user input and backend input. An example would be a multi-user game that has visuals controlled by user input but may also have the same visuals controlled by some backend input (say tcp/ip). Another example would be a terminal emulator that gets user inputs but also gets data from another source be it telnet or serial, etc. I was thinking of writing a WPF custom control for the visual. In other words, it is a black box that will interpret the inputs and display the results. Getting user input into this custom control is easy since one can listen for the appropriate events and handle them as needed. However, how can one listen for the inputs from the backend? Exposing a dependency property that one binds to does not make sense but exposing a method on the visual that is called with the data also does not make sense. Another choice is the MVVM architecture where the Model is the backend data source and the View Model does all the work. It gets both the backend data (via the model) and the user inputs (via appropriate command bindings or some such) and it makes appropriate sense of these and binds to the View to display these changes. The advantage of the custom control is that it can be consumed as a control that takes care of itself so that the consumer has to do very little work to use it but the problem is getting data to it from the backend. The MVVM method is advantageous because it encapsulates the handling logic, view, etc neatly. The problem is that this pattern has to be repeated for every backend. Thus, making the visual very bare bones and exposing all the processing logic outside the control. Basically I want to make it very easy to consume so that someone can take it and use it without adding too much external logic to do processing etc. All they provide is their backend data source that feeds into the visual. Sorry for this being a lengthy post but I am learning WPF and this is an interesting design question for me. All ideas, comments, etc welcome. Thanks for reading.

@LINK:/questions/1303893/properties-editor-design-pattern
@TITLE:Properties editor design pattern?
@CONTENT:Warning: This is super in-depth. I understand if you don't even want to read this, this is mostly for me to sort out my thought process. Okay, so here's what I'm trying to do. I've got these objects: When you click on one (or select several) it should display their properties on the right (as shown). When you edit said properties it should update the internal variables immediately. I'm trying to decide on the best way to do this. I figure the selected objects should be stored as a list of pointers. It's either that, or have an isSelected bool on each object, and then iterate over all of them, ignoring the non-selected ones, which is just inefficient. So we click on one, or select several, and then the selectedObjects list is populated. We then need to display the properties. To keep things simple for the time being, we'll assume that all objects are of the same type (share the same set of properties). Since there aren't any instance-specific properties, I figure we should probably store these properties as static variables inside the Object class. Properties basically just have a name (like "Allow Sleep"). There is one PropertyManager for each type of property (int,bool,double). PropertyManagers store all the values for properties of their respective type (this is all from the Qt API). Unfortunately, because PropertyManagers are required to create Properties I can't really decouple the two. I suppose this means that I have to place the PropertyManagers with the Properties (as static variables). This means we have one set of properties, and one set of property managers to manage all the variables in all the objects. Each property manager can only have one callback. That means this callback has to update all the properties of its respective type, for all objects (a nested loop). This yields something like this (in pseudo-code): function valueChanged(property, value) {
    if(property == xPosProp) {
        foreach(selectedObj as obj) {
            obj->setXPos(value);
        }
    } else if(property == ...
 Which already bothers me a little bit, because we're using if statements where we shouldn't need them. The way around this would be to create a different property manager for every single property, so that we can have unique callbacks. This also means we need two objects for each property, but it might be a price worth paying for cleaner code (I really don't know what the performance costs are right now, but as I know you'll also say -- optimize when it becomes a problem). So then we end up with a ton of callbacks: function xPosChanged(property, value) {
    foreach(selectedObj as obj) {
        obj->setXPos(value);
    }
}
 Which eliminates the entire if/else garbage but adds a dozen more event-listeners. Let's assume I go with this method. So now we had a wad of static Properties, along with their corresponding static PropertyManagers. Presumably I'd store the list of selected objects as Object::selectedObjects too since they're used in all the event callbacks, which logically belong in the object class. So then we have a wad of static event callbacks too. That's all fine and dandy. So now when you edit a property, we can update the interal variables for all the selected objects via the event callback. But what happens when the internal variable is updated via some other means, how do we update the property? This happens to be a physics simulator, so all the objects will have many of their variables continuously updated. I can't add callbacks for these because the physics is handled by another 3rd party library. I guess this means I just have to assume all the variables have been changed after each time step. So after each time step, I have to update all the properties for all the selected objects. Fine, I can do that. Last issue (I hope), is what values should we display when multiple objects are selected an there is an inconsistency? I guess my options are to leave it blank/0 or display a random object's properties. I don't think one option is much better than the other, but hopefully Qt provides a method to highlight such properties so that I can at least notify the user. So how do I figure out which properties to "highlight"? I guess I iterate over all the selected objects, and all their properties, compare them, and as soon as there is a mismatch I can highlight it. So to clarify, upon selected some objects: add all objects to a selectedObjects list populate the properties editor find which properties have identical values and update the editor appropriately I think I should store the properties in a list too so that I can just push the whole list onto the properties editor rather than adding each property individually. Should allow for more flexibility down the road I think. I think that about covers it... I'm still not certain how I feel about having so many static variables, and a semi-singleton class (the static variables would be initialized once when the first object is created I guess). But I don't see a better solution. Please post your thoughts if you actually read this. I guess that's not really a question, so let me rephrase for the haters, What adjustments can I make to my suggested design-pattern to yield cleaner, more understandable, or more efficient code? (or something along those lines). Looks like I need to clarify. By "property" I mean like "Allow Sleeping", or "Velocity" -- all objects have these properties -- their VALUES however, are unique to each instance. Properties hold the string that needs to be displayed, the valid range for the values, and all the widget info. PropertyManagers are the objects that actually hold the value. They control the callbacks, and the value that's displayed. There is also another copy of the value, that's actually used "internally" by the other 3rd party physics library. Trying to actually implement this madness now. I have an EditorView (the black area drawing area in the image) which catches the mouseClick event. The mouseClick events then tells the physics simulator to query all the bodies at the cursor. Each physics body stores a reference (a void pointer!) back to my object class. The pointers get casted back to objects get pushed onto a list of selected objects. The EditorView then sends out a signal. The EditorWindow then catches this signal and passes it over to the PropertiesWindow along with the selected objects. Now the PropertiesWindow needs to query the objects for a list of properties to display... and that's as far as I've gotten so far. Mind boggling! The Solution /*

@TITLE:Exit status code for Expect script called from Bash
@CONTENT:I made a Bash script which uses an expect script to automate ssh logins.The script connects to multiple servers and runs some commands. The bash script prompts for login credentials once. I want to incorporate a feature wherein the script terminates if the login fails for the first server to avoid the script checking for next servers resulting in the user account getting locked. The account lockout happens for 3 consecutive login failures and the number of server the script tries to connect is more than 3.

./script.expect $LUSERNAME $LPASS $servername Linux >> linux_log_file.txt & < /dev/null

 and here is the expect script (script.expect) snippet #!/usr/bin/expect -f

@TITLE:How to replicate and set up a test Active Directory DC
@CONTENT:I have .Net code that will read/write to our local Active Directory domain. The reading part has been tested and works fine, but I wish to test the 'writing' part. My application will be modifying some user profiles in active directory but I don't want to implement this on the live server just in case something breaks. What's the best approach to test 'write' functionality without risking failure of the live server? Is there a way to replicate Active Directory onto another server and run tests on this new server in isolation of the original Active Directory domain? I was thinking of adding a test machine as a secondary domain controller onto my domain so it replicates the schema. Then taking it off the network and running tests on it, and if it breaks our real domain is not affected by this. Can some one suggest what is the best approach is to do this? The more detailed the better.. Thanks.

@TITLE:Rotating an NSImage with or without NSAffineTransform
@CONTENT:I've got an NSImage being drawn on a subclass of NSView. In a previous question, I was helped to draw it upright in the upper left corner. Now, I want to be able to rotate the image. I have a button that increments a rotation variable %4, and then I multiply this by -90 to find the rotation angle. I then use an NSAffineTransform to rotate the image, and translate it back onto the screen. However, it doesn't seem to be working the way I expect it to. I have two problems. 1) When I rotate, the portion of the image that is in an area that wasn't in the previous frame gets drawn correctly. However, the potion that was previously there remains as the original image. This means that after several rotations, there's a square of the original upright image and then a rectangle below or to the left of rotate image. 2) When I re-size the window, the image redraws (as it should) in the original upright orientation (as it should not). Basically, I'm coming to the conclusion that NSAffineTransform doesn't work the way I think it does. Is there some other way to rotate (and translate) the image? thanks large code chunk: (code between "WORKS" and "end works" is working code to just draw the image. It came from my previous question). [OLD CODE DELETED, replaced lower with new code] thanks EDIT: A little more research finds that instead of doing an NSAffineTtransform I can rotate the view. This seems to work better.

@TITLE:prime generator optimization
@CONTENT:I'm starting out my expedition into Project Euler. And as many others I've figured I need to make a prime number generator. Problem is: PHP doesn't like big numbers. If I use the standard Sieve of Eratosthenes function, and set the limit to 2 million, it will crash. It doesn't like creating arrays of that size. Understandable. So now I'm trying to optimize it. One way, I found, was to instead of creating an array with 2 million variable, I only need 1 million (only odd numbers can be prime numbers). But now it's crashing because it exceeds the maximum execution time... function getPrimes($limit) {
$count = 0;
for ($i = 3; $i < $limit; $i += 2) {
	$primes[$count++] = $i;
}

for ($n = 3; $n < $limit; $n += 2) {
    //array will be half the size of $limit
	for ($i = 1; $i < $limit/2; $i++) {
		if ($primes[$i] % $n === 0 && $primes[$i] !== $n) {
			$primes[$i] = 0;
		}
	}
}

return $primes;
}
 The function works, but as I said, it's a bit slow...any suggestions? One thing I've found to make it a bit faster is to switch the loop around. foreach ($primes as $value) {
    //$limitSq is the sqrt of the limit, as that is as high as I have to go
    for ($n = 3; $n = $limitSq; $n += 2) {
        if ($value !== $n && $value % $n === 0) {
            $primes[$count] = 0;
            $n = $limitSq; //breaking the inner loop
        }
    }
    $count++;
}
 And in addition setting the time and memory limit (thanks Greg), I've finally managed to get an answer. phjew.
@CODE:function getPrimes($limit) {
$count = 0;
for ($i = 3; $i < $limit; $i += 2) {

@CONTENT:In a DB I'm designing, there's one fairly central table representing something that's been sold or is for sale. It distinguishes between personal sales (like eBay) and sales from a proper company. This means there is literally 1 or two fields which are not equally appropiate to both cases... for instance one field is only used in one case, another field is optional in one case but mandatory in the other. If there were more specialty it would be sensible to have a core table and then two tables with the fields relevant to the specific cases. But here, creating two tables just to contain like one field plus the reference to the core table seems both aesthetically bad, and painful to the query designer and DB software. What do you think? Is it ok to bend the rules slightly by having a single table with weakened constraints - meaning the DB cannot 100% prevent inconsistent data being added (in a very limited way) - or do I suck it up and create dumb-looking 1-field tables?

@TITLE:Entity Framework won't SaveChanges on new entity with two-level relationship
@CONTENT:I'm building an ASP.NET MVC site using the ADO.NET Entity Framework. I have an entity model that includes these entities, associated by foreign keys: Report(ID, Date, Heading, Report_Type_ID, etc.) SubReport(ID, ReportText, etc.) - one-to-one relationship with Report. ReportSource(ID, Name, Description) - one-to-many relationship with Sub_Report. ReportSourceType(ID, Name, Description) - one-to-many relationship with ReportSource. Contact (ID, Name, Address, etc.) - one-to-one relationship with Report_Source. There is a Create.aspx page for each type of SubReport. The post event method returns a new Sub_Report entity. Before, in my post method, I followed this process: Set the properties for a new Report entity from the page's fields. Set the SubReport entity's specific properties from the page's fields. Set the SubReport entity's Report to the new Report entity created in 1. Given an ID provided by the page, look up the ReportSource and set the Sub_Report entity's ReportSource to the found entity. SaveChanges. This workflow succeeded just fine for a couple of weeks. Then last week something changed and it doesn't work any more. Now instead of the save operation, I get this Exception: 
UpdateException: "Entities in 'DIR2_5Entities.ReportSourceSet' 
participate in the 'FK_ReportSources_ReportSourceTypes' relationship. 
0 related 'ReportSourceTypes' were found. 1 'Report_Source_Types' is expected."
 The debug visualizer shows the following: The SubReport's ReportSource is set and loaded, and all of its properties are correct. The Report_Source has a valid ReportSourceType entity attached. In SQL Profiler the prepared SQL statement looks OK. Can anybody point me to what obvious thing I'm missing? TIA Notes: The Report and SubReport are always new entities in this case. The Report entity contains properties common to many types of reports and is used for generic queries. SubReports are specific reports with extra parameters varying by type. There is actually a different entity set for each type of SubReport, but this question applies to all of them, so I use SubReport as a simplified example.

<team id="142" name="Scotland" />
<team id="110" name="Liverpool" />
<team id="13" name="Manchester United" />
<team id="123" name="England" />
<team id="84" name="Chelsea" />
<team id="295" name="Wales" />
<team id="49" name="Arsenal" />
<team id="126" name="Northern Ireland" />
<team id="121" name="Republic of Ireland" />
<team id="42" name="Manchester City" />
<team id="298" name="Tottenham Hotspur" />
<team id="299" name="Bolton" />
</teams>
 I require the national teams to be sorted first in a certain order, followed by the rest in alphabetical order: <teams>
<team id="123" name="England" />
<team id="126" name="Northern Ireland" />
<team id="121" name="Republic of Ireland" />
<team id="142" name="Scotland" />
<team id="295" name="Wales" />
<team id="49" name="Arsenal" />
<team id="299" name="Bolton" />
<team id="84" name="Chelsea" />
<team id="110" name="Liverpool" />
<team id="42" name="Manchester City" />
<team id="13" name="Manchester United" />
<team id="298" name="Tottenham Hotspur" />
</teams>
 I have been trying, but failing. Is there a neat way to do this, or do you have to sort the national teams individually, followed by a sort which excludes all the national teams?

@TITLE:CreateProcessWithLogonW and AssignProcessToJobObject
@CONTENT:I have a Windows service (under WinXP SP2), running under the LocalSystem account, that launches processes using CreateProcessWithLogonW. In order to clean up child processes, I'm trying to use a job object and TerminateJobObject. MSDN states that the job handle must have JOB_OBJECT_ASSIGN_PROCESS access right, which it has since it's created via CreateJobObject. The process handle must have PROCESS_SET_QUOTA and PROCESS_TERMINATE rights. I think it has them since TerminateProcess and SetProcessWorkingSetSize both return with no error. Though, AssignProcessToJobObject fails with errno 5 (Access denied). Everything works fine if I replace CreateProcessWithLogonW with a simple CreateProcess. Am I missing something or is what I'm trying to do impossible ? Edit: It seems that svchost.exe, which actually creates the process when CreateProcessWithLogonW is used, already assigns the process to an anonymous job. The CREATE_CREAKAWAY_FROM_JOB flag is ignored by this function. So the real question is: is there a way to prevent svnhost from assigning the process to a job ?

@TITLE:T-SQL query to flag repeat records
@CONTENT:I have a table that will have 500,000+ records. Each record has a LineNumber field which is not unique and not part of the primary key. Each record has a CreatedOn field. I need to update all 500,000+ records to identify repeat records. A repeat records is defined by a record that has the same LineNumber within the last seven days of its CreatedOn field. In the diagram above row 4 is a repeat because it occurred only five days since row 1. Row 6 is not a repeat even though it occurs only four days since row 4, but row 4 itself is already a repeat, so Row 6 can only be compared to Row 1 which is nine days prior to Row 6, therefore Row 6 is not a repeat. I do not know how to update the IsRepeat field with stepping through each record one-by-one via a cursor or something. I do not believe cursors is the way to go, but I'm stuck with any other possible solution. I have considered maybe Common Table Expressions may be of help but I have no experience with them and have no idea where to start. Basically this same process needs to be done on the table every day as the table is truncated and re-populated every single day. Once the table is re-populated, I have to go through and re-mark each record if it is a repeat or not. Some assistance would be most appreciated.

 It seems that the behaviour of GDI+ is changed in Windows 7: The resulting CCITT bitmap data is no longer encoded in a single strip. Because of this I cannot use this bitmap data in my PDF file. Question: does anybody know how I can tell GDI+ to encode the bitmap data in a single strip?

@TITLE:Hudson continuous integration server: how to see Windows mapped directories that are visible to Ant?
@CONTENT:Using Hudson, Ant 1.7, Tomcat 6.20, JDK 1.6 and JDK 1.5; all on Windows boxes. My Ant build script for a WAR file uses JARs stored on a remote server. The directory path to the remote server is mapped as a network drive in Windows. A build.properties file is used to specify the paths to the JAR dependencies. When building with Ant, either at command line or in Eclipse, the WAR builds and deploys successfully. Example from build.properties: lib.log4j=S:/Support/JARs/log4j-1.2.15.jar In the above entry, the mapped network drive in Windows is the "S" drive. I am currently evaluating Hudson on my local workstation. In Hudson, if I attempt to use the mapped network drive path to the JARs, the build fails. If I copy over the JARs to a local directory (so that they are in C:/Support/JARs), the build succeeds in compiling and creating the WAR. How can I get Hudson to respect the mapped network drive paths? Also, is there a way to avoid having to pass Ant arguments in the Hudson user interface, and instead actually use the build.properties file, instead? Hudson seems unable to read the build.properties, otherwise. Many thanks. Mike Quentel

@TITLE:How do you set the FrameworkElement.Width property to the value of a qualifiedDouble, in the code-behind?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to set the width property of one of my controls to a qualifiedDouble, as described here on MSDN. (Scroll down to the "XAML Values" section to see MSDN's info on the use of a qualifiedDouble) However, I want to know how to achieve this in the code-behind, rather than XAML. The UserControls I am creating do not have XAML attached to them, for inheritance purposes. So I have to perform all XAML operations manually, using whatever I can in C#. Does anyone know how qualifiedDouble is achieved in the code-behind?

@TITLE:Prevent webpage from scrolling when scrolling inside a Flash object
@CONTENT:I'm sure this must be a common question, but I haven't found an answer elsewhere. I've got a Flash object embedded in a long webpage. I listen for the MOUSE_WHEEL event in Flash, and scroll my Flash content accordingly. However, when I scroll over the Flash object, the webpage also scrolls. Is there any way to prevent this behaviour, i.e. lock the webpage's scrolling position when the Flash object has focus? I'd prefer not to have to use JavaScript.

@TITLE:Changing the colour of a dropdown list when closed
@CONTENT:With CSS I can set font and background colours for the individual options of a dropdown "select" list; however, these colours only show up in the actual dropdown. The colours shown in the box on the page when the list is not open are still the defaults. Currently I have a list with many dropdown boxes having a few options, and it would be useful to be able to colour each option so that the selection is immediately obvious. Converting to radio buttons or other input is not really feasible. (My clients are rather picky. :-p)

I see the class CGIScript in web/twcgi.py has a render method that is accessing the request... but I am not sure how to gain access to this request in my server. I saw an example where someone patched twcgi.py to set environment variables and then in the server access the environment variables... but I figure there has to be a better solution. Thanks.

@TITLE:Read only when the XML data is updated
@CONTENT:I'm able to parse RSS with PHP - What I'm looking for is to be able to get only the updated content, and do nothing if there's no new update to the RSS. For example, I have this RSS File, and if there's no new content, nothing happens, but if there's a new content, I want to send my users the latest RSS update, and not resend what they already have. I'm parsing and sending the title and link only. I use cronjob to check every hour for update. My question is how can I tell that the feed is now updated and not the same as the last one? Here's the PHP file that I'm using to read the RSS. Do I write the last content to file and compare them or is there any other way to determine that the content is now different from the last? Update: I had to resurrect this post because I'm still trying to get it to work. Although I accepted a few answers, they have been very hard to implement, for example the hashing option looked like a good idea initially, but as thousands of RSS would be checked, it would be almost impossible to hash them all. Again, someone suggested HTTP Cache - I couldn't find a simple demo so I'm practically stuck. Any further suggest would be highly appreciated.

@TITLE:CreateProcessWithLogonW and AssignProcessToJobObject
@CONTENT:I have a Windows service (under WinXP SP2), running under the LocalSystem account, that launches processes using CreateProcessWithLogonW. In order to clean up child processes, I'm trying to use a job object and TerminateJobObject. MSDN states that the job handle must have JOB_OBJECT_ASSIGN_PROCESS access right, which it has since it's created via CreateJobObject. The process handle must have PROCESS_SET_QUOTA and PROCESS_TERMINATE rights. I think it has them since TerminateProcess and SetProcessWorkingSetSize both return with no error. Though, AssignProcessToJobObject fails with errno 5 (Access denied). Everything works fine if I replace CreateProcessWithLogonW with a simple CreateProcess. Am I missing something or is what I'm trying to do impossible ? Edit: It seems that svchost.exe, which actually creates the process when CreateProcessWithLogonW is used, already assigns the process to an anonymous job. The CREATE_CREAKAWAY_FROM_JOB flag is ignored by this function. So the real question is: is there a way to prevent svnhost from assigning the process to a job ?

@TITLE:T-SQL query to flag repeat records
@CONTENT:I have a table that will have 500,000+ records. Each record has a LineNumber field which is not unique and not part of the primary key. Each record has a CreatedOn field. I need to update all 500,000+ records to identify repeat records. A repeat records is defined by a record that has the same LineNumber within the last seven days of its CreatedOn field. In the diagram above row 4 is a repeat because it occurred only five days since row 1. Row 6 is not a repeat even though it occurs only four days since row 4, but row 4 itself is already a repeat, so Row 6 can only be compared to Row 1 which is nine days prior to Row 6, therefore Row 6 is not a repeat. I do not know how to update the IsRepeat field with stepping through each record one-by-one via a cursor or something. I do not believe cursors is the way to go, but I'm stuck with any other possible solution. I have considered maybe Common Table Expressions may be of help but I have no experience with them and have no idea where to start. Basically this same process needs to be done on the table every day as the table is truncated and re-populated every single day. Once the table is re-populated, I have to go through and re-mark each record if it is a repeat or not. Some assistance would be most appreciated.

@TITLE:Windows 7: Saving as TIFF CCITT Group4 changed?
@CONTENT:My program, that converts a multi page TIFF to PDF is not longer working under Windows 7. The program contains code that walks through the pages of the TIFF, converts each page as TIFF with CCITT Group4 compression and inserts the bitmap data in the resulting PDF file. Converting is done in the following way (c#):  ImageCodecInfo tiffCodecInfo = GetEncoderInfo("image/tiff");
 EncoderParameters myEncoderParameters = new EncoderParameters(2);

 // Save the bitmap as a TIFF file with CCITT group4 compression.   	
 myEncoderParameters.Param[0] = new EncoderParameter System.Drawing.Imaging.Encoder.Compression, (long)EncoderValue..CompressionCCITT4);
 myEncoderParameters.Param[1] = new EncoderParameter(System.Drawing.Imaging.Encoder.ColorDepth, 1L);
 image.Save(source, tiffCodecInfo, myEncoderParameters);
 It seems that the behaviour of GDI+ is changed in Windows 7: The resulting CCITT bitmap data is no longer encoded in a single strip. Because of this I cannot use this bitmap data in my PDF file. Question: does anybody know how I can tell GDI+ to encode the bitmap data in a single strip?
@CODE:ImageCodecInfo tiffCodecInfo = GetEncoderInfo("image/tiff");
 EncoderParameters myEncoderParameters = new EncoderParameters(2);

@TITLE:Hudson continuous integration server: how to see Windows mapped directories that are visible to Ant?
@CONTENT:Using Hudson, Ant 1.7, Tomcat 6.20, JDK 1.6 and JDK 1.5; all on Windows boxes. My Ant build script for a WAR file uses JARs stored on a remote server. The directory path to the remote server is mapped as a network drive in Windows. A build.properties file is used to specify the paths to the JAR dependencies. When building with Ant, either at command line or in Eclipse, the WAR builds and deploys successfully. Example from build.properties: lib.log4j=S:/Support/JARs/log4j-1.2.15.jar In the above entry, the mapped network drive in Windows is the "S" drive. I am currently evaluating Hudson on my local workstation. In Hudson, if I attempt to use the mapped network drive path to the JARs, the build fails. If I copy over the JARs to a local directory (so that they are in C:/Support/JARs), the build succeeds in compiling and creating the WAR. How can I get Hudson to respect the mapped network drive paths? Also, is there a way to avoid having to pass Ant arguments in the Hudson user interface, and instead actually use the build.properties file, instead? Hudson seems unable to read the build.properties, otherwise. Many thanks. Mike Quentel

@TITLE:Selecting overlapping time ranges
@CONTENT:T-SQL DateTime Question. I have a set of time ranges. During those time ranges there could be a set of overlapping time ranges that I call 'blocked' out time. The blocked time wouldn't span more than one day. What I want to do is split the time to exclude the blocked out time, basically giving me the time ranges that are not 'blocked'. Its safe to assume that blocked times cant fall outside of the times ranges. Example: I work 9am to 5pm with a 30 min lunch break at 1pm. I want the result of 2 rows: 9am to 1pm and 1.30pm to 5pm. As mentioned, I have a set of time ranges so in the above example the working hours may differ on a daily basis and the number of breaks as well as their duration may differ. I guess in terms of SQL the input parameters would look like this: declare @timeranges table ( StartDateTime datetime, EndDateTime datetime )
declare @blockedtimes table ( StartDateTime datetime, EndDateTime datetime )

insert into @timeranges 
select '01 Jan 2009 09:00:00', '01 Jan 2009 17:00:00'
union select '02 Feb 2009 10:00:00', '02 Feb 2009 13:00:00'

@TITLE:Help with SED syntax : unterminated `s' command
@CONTENT:Edit: I'm using CYGWIN/GNU sed version 4.1.5 on windows Vista and I want a case insensitive search I want to use sed to replace inline, the following: c:\DEV\Suite\anything here --- blah 12 334 xxx zzzzz etc\Modules etc Edit: anything here --- blah 12 334 xxx zzzzz etc means anything could appear here. Sorry for omitting that. In a file with lines like FileName="c:\DEV\Suite\anything here --- blah 12 334 xxx zzzzz etc\Modules\.... snipped ...."
 with a value I supply, say : Project X - Version 99.98 So the file ends up with: FileName="c:\DEV\Suite\Project X - Version 99.98\Modules\.... snipped ...."
 My attempt: c:\temp>sed -r -b s/Dev\\Suite\\.*\\Modules/dev\\suite\\simple\\/g test.txt
 However I get the following error: sed: -e expression #1, char 42: unterminated `s' command
 Thanks. Edit: I've already tried added quotes.

@CONTENT:I'm trying to create a form that sends the customer's name and email address to icontact (an email list application). All the values are correct for icontact and if I submit the form as usual, icontact responds that it added the email address. The success message loads in a new page from icontact's website. What I'd like to accomplish is that ajax would send the form and returns a success message within the current page, without sending the customer to a new page.

@CONTENT:After reading another question about the use of macros, I wondered: What are they good for? One thing I don't see replaced by any other language construct very soon is in diminishing the number of related words you need to type in the following: void log_type( const bool value ) { std::cout << "bool: " << value; }
void log_type( const int value ) { std::cout << "int: " << value; }
...
void log_type( const char  value ) { std::cout << "char: "  << value; }
void log_type( const double  value ) { std::cout << "int: "  << value; }
void log_type( const float  value ) { std::cout << "float: "  << value; }
 as opposed to #define LOGFN( T ) void log_type( const T value ) { std::cout << #T ## ": " << value; }
LOGFN( int )
LOGFN( bool )
...
LOGFN( char )
LOGFN( double )
LOGFN( float )
 Any other 'irreplaceables'? EDIT: trying to summarize the reasons-why encountered in the answers; since that's what I was interested in. Mainly because I have a feeling that most of them are due to us still programming in raw text files in, still, poorly supporting environments. flexibility of code-to-be compiled (e.g. #ifdef DEBUG, platform issues) (SadSido, Catalin, Goz) debug purposes (e.g. __LINE__, __TIME__); I also put 'stringifying' under this reason (SadSido, Jla3ep, Jason S) replacing e.g. PHP's require vs. include feature (#pragma once) (SadSido, Catalin) readability enhancement by replacing complicated code (e.g. MESSAGEMAP, BOOST_FOREACH) (SadSido, fnieto) DRY principle (Jason S) an inline replacement (Matthias Wandel, Robert S. Barnes) stringifying (Jason S)
@CODE:void log_type( const bool value ) { std::cout << "bool: " << value; }

@CONTENT:I need to display a TIFF (type 4) image in Eclipse from a Java stream. TIFFv4 is not supported, so I need an image library. Sun's JAI-ImageIO has native code -- I can't wrap it easily into a plugin. I can't just import jai-imageio.jar (et al) from the lib\ext directory because Eclipse has its own ideas about classpaths. Any suggestions for image extensions / libraries usable in Eclipse? Although I've got the same core code compiling and running on the same Eclipse (Galileo) as a standard Java program, when I make it part of an Eclipse BIRT extension (I modified the RotatedLabel ReportItem example), it fails. What happens is that the code compiles (I added the jars to the jre\lib\ext directory) and it fails at runtime with the following error (in the log file): SEVERE: Error happened while running the report. java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: javax/media/jai/PlanarImage at org.eclipse.birt.sample.reportitem.rotatedlabel.util.GraphicsUtil.createDocImage(GraphicsUtil.java:64) at > org.eclipse.birt.sample.reportitem.rotatedlabel.RotatedLabelPresentationImpl.onRowSets(RotatedLabelPresentationImpl.java:135) at org.eclipse.birt.report.engine.extension.ReportItemPresentationBase.onRowSets(ReportItemPresentationBase.java:218)

Pavol Juhos wrote: Equinox Config Admin (org.eclipse.equinox.cm) stores the configuration data in the persistent storage area provided by the Framework. And that happens to be the "local bundle cache" directory by default for Equinox. So i read up on this topic and found that there are several runtime options for Equinox (among other things osgi.configuration.area). What I want is to change the configuration, in order that the local bundle cache won't be droped or cleaned, so the next time I'll run the Framework, the last entered configuration (for any bundle) will be used.

@TITLE:user control event handler lost on postback
@CONTENT:I have a menu usercontrol called LeftMenu that has a bulletedlist of linkitems. It's on the ascx page as such: <asp:BulletedList ID="PublisherList" DisplayMode="LinkButton" OnClick="PublisherList_Click" cssClass="Menu" runat="server"></asp:BulletedList>
 I databind the list in the page_load under if(!isPostBack) I'm having an issue on a page that loads the control. When the page first loads, the event handler fires. However, when the page posts back it no longer fires and in IE8, when I'm debugging, I get "Microsoft JScript runtime error: Object expected" in Visual Studio pointing at "__doPostBack('LeftMenu$PublisherList','0')." In FF I don't get the error, but nothing happens. I'm not loading the control dynamically, it's loaded on the aspx page using: <%@ Register TagPrefix="Standards" TagName="LeftMenu" Src="LeftMenu.ascx" %>

<Standards:LeftMenu ID="LeftMenu" runat="server"/>
 Any ideas of where I'm losing the event handler? I just realized this is happening on another user control I have as well. A text box and a button and I'm using the default button to make sure pressing the enter key uses that button. .Net converts that in the html to:  <div id="SearchBarInclude_SearchBar" onkeypress="javascript:return WebForm_FireDefaultButton(event, 'SearchBarInclude_QuickSearchButton')">
 so as soon as i enter a key in the box I get a javascript error at the line saying "object expected." It seems like the two issues are related. Edit Again: I think I need to clarify. It's not that I'm clicking on the menu item and it can't find the selected item on postback. I have this search page with the left navigation on it and then the main content of the page is something that causes a postback. Everything is fine with this postback. Once that page has been posted back, now if I click on the bulleted list in the left navigation I get a javascript error and it fails. The page_init for the LeftMenu control is never called.
@CODE:<asp:BulletedList ID="PublisherList" DisplayMode="LinkButton" OnClick="PublisherList_Click" cssClass="Menu" runat="server"></asp:BulletedList> if(!isPostBack) <%@ Register TagPrefix="Standards" TagName="LeftMenu" Src="LeftMenu.ascx" %>

@TITLE:iPhone OpenGL ES Texture2D Masking
@CONTENT:What's the best choice when trying to mask a texture like ColorSplash or other apps like iSteam, etc? I started learning OPENGL ES like... 4 days ago (I'm a total rookie) and tried the following approach: 1) I created a colored texture2D, a grayscale version of the first texture and a third texture2D called mask 2) I also created a texture2D for the brush... which is grayscale and it's opaque (brush = black = 0,0,0,1 and surroundings = white = 1,1,1,1). My intention was to create an antialiased brush with smooth edges but i'm fine with a normal one right now 3) I searched for masking techniques on the internet and found this tutorial ZeusCMD - Design and Development Tutorials : OpenGL ES Programming Tutorials - Masking about masking. The tutorial tells me to use blending to achieve masking... first draw colored, then mask with glBlendFunc(GL_DST_COLOR, GL_ZERO) and then grayscale with glBlendFunc(GL_ONE, GL_ONE) ... and this gives me something close to what i want... but not exactly what i want. The result is masked but it's somehow overbright-ed 4) For drawing to the mask texture i used an extra frame buffer object (FBO) I'm not really happy with the resulting image (overbright-ed picture) nor with the speed achieved with this method. I think the normal way was to draw directly to the grayscale (overlay) texture2D affecting only it's alpha channel in the places where the brush hits. Is there a fast way to achieve this? I have searched a lot and never got an answer that's clear and understandable. Then, in the main draw loop I could only draw the colored texture and then blend the grayscale ontop with glBlendFunc(GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA). I just want to learn to use OPENGL ES and it's driving me nuts because i can't get it to work properly. An advice, a link to a tutorial would be much appreciated.

Sure I can loop through the collection and get the selected items but I'd prefer to do it more cleanly with windows data-binding. Is this possible?

@TITLE:C#: How to connect to Active Directory with SSL enabled?
@CONTENT:The project I am working on will integrate with the customers Active Directory in order to authenticate users. I have been trying to write some code that will retrieve a users password and I understand that Active Directory will only expose the relevant properties over a SSL connection on port 636. The following code connects programmatically without using SSL but then I can't see the password properties: static void Main(string[] args)
{
	DirectoryEntry entry = new DirectoryEntry(@"LDAP://<IP>/CN=LDAP Test,CN=Users,DC=customer,DC=com");
	entry.AuthenticationType = AuthenticationTypes.None;
	entry.Username = "CN=LDAP Test,CN=Users,DC=customer,DC=com";
	entry.Password = "<password>";
	if (entry != null)
	{
		foreach (Object propName in entry.Properties.PropertyNames)
		{
			Console.WriteLine((String)propName);
		}
	}
}
 When I change the code to use SSL I get an exception stating ;Unknown error (0x80005000)'. I have enabled SSL on the server hosting Active Directory, installed a Microsoft CA on the same server and obtained a certificate from the CA. I can connect to the Active Directory over SSL using Apache Directory Studio but that does not show the password properties. The following code shows what I have been trying to use to connect using SSL: static void Main(string[] args)
{
	DirectoryEntry entry = new DirectoryEntry(@"LDAPS://<IP>:636/CN=LDAP Test,CN=Users,DC=customer,DC=com");
	entry.AuthenticationType = AuthenticationTypes.SecureSocketsLayer;
	entry.Username = "CN=LDAP Test,CN=Users,DC=customer,DC=com";
	entry.Password = "<password>";
	if (entry != null)
	{
		foreach (Object propName in entry.Properties.PropertyNames)
		{
			Console.WriteLine((String)propName);
		}
	}
}
 I'm not sure where to go with this and some assistance would be greatly appreciated.

@TITLE:What replacements are available for vbscript in an application?
@CONTENT:An application I maintain has been around since VB6 days - ported to .Net 1.1, and now being updated/rewritten across to .Net 3.5 The application provides a mechanism to run VBScripts - this was done in a highly integrated way - allowing the program to parse multiple .vbs files and produce a list of all of the subroutines and functions - which were then available within the application alongside core functions. Previously this was an embedded msscript.ocx - in the first .Net conversion, this was wrapped in Interop.MSScriptControl.dll, however, on Windows 7 this just isn't working. It looks like this is really not the way to be doing this anyway - Microsoft seem to be trying to kill vbscript. Is there a 'supported' way of using VBScript, or is it time to move on? and if so, where is there to move to that provides the same sort of functionality?

@CONTENT:For a simple project I have to make large numbers (e.g. 4294967123) readable, so I'm writing only the first digits with a prefix (4294967123 -> 4.29G, 12345 -> 12.34K etc.) The code (simplified) looks like this: const char* postfixes=" KMGT";
char postfix(unsigned int x)
{
     return postfixes[(int) floor(log10(x))];
}
 It works, but I think that there's a more elegant/better solution than computing the full precision logarithm, rounding it and casting it down to an int again. Other solutions I thought of: int i=0;
for(; x >= 1000 ; ++i) x/=1000;
return postfixes[i];
 (This is significantly slower, but easier to read) The numbers are distributed between according to Benford's Law and the number should be treated as unsigned 64 bit-number, as there should be no rounding error near 10^x (e.g. in python math.log(1000,10) returns 2.999996, which gets floored to 2). Is there any fast, accurate other way I'm missing?

However, when I create a .war file out of the rails directory using jruby -S warble and deploy to Tomcat, none of my images show up on the tomcat server. I noticed that image location has changed to the root of the directory in the war file. It seems that /images/picturename.jpg would be appropriate, but my images are not showing up.

@TITLE:UIAlertViewDelegate method didDismissWithButtonIndex gets called while the phone is sleeping/locked
@CONTENT:I have a UIAlertView who's didDismissWithButtonIndex delegate method calls pops the view controller (same class, it's the alertview delegate and the viewcontroller) to return the user to the previous screen. The issue is that when you lock the phone before the [alert show]; is called, something is calling didDismissWithButtonIndex while the phone is locked. Since the response to that is to pop the view controller, which releases and deallocs it, I crash on the callback. What is causing this phantom button press? Seems like a framework bug, but I hate jumping to that conclusion. I'm definitely not hitting the button, because I hit a breakpoint in my code right before it's displayed. Then I lock the phone. Then I continue. I see it do the show, return to the event loop, and then, while the phone is still locked, hit my breakpoint in didDismissWithButtonIndex. There are a few internet/forum postings about similar spurious delegate calls, but no concrete answers. This is on the simulator, and the device, both OS 2.2 and OS 3.0. I'm assuming I'm missing something, but what? Update: Yeah, I created a simple project with just two view controllers, where when the 2nd view controller displays it creates the alert, and shows it. Then I NSLog in the delegate method, and when the phone is locked, it fires once while locked, and then again when it's unlocked and the button is clicked...2 log messages. But when not locked, there's only one. I guess I'll open an issue, but it seems awfully obvious to have survived this long without anyone complaining. :-) I'm going to try and work around it by making an isActive flag value when the willResignActive/didBecomeActive notifications arrive, and if the app isn't active skipping the delegate body. Update I went ahead in July after I posted this and created radar 7097363 for this issue. There's been no response. The workaround in practice works quite well, checking the active status when processing the delegate, and skipping the action if the the app is inactive.

The only way I have been able to handle this is by making four methods, one for each level. Gross. I have run into this situation several times using both cocos2d and only the basic Cocoa framework.

We are using VS 2005's setup project for our setup, and we need to programmatically decide to prompt for a restart (so it will not happen on every install, just on some). UPDATE: We're looking for something that is already built into the MSI custom action system first. If that doesn't exist, we can resort to restarting the PC ourselves somehow, but would like to avoid that. UPDATE: We see where you can set REBOOT=Force when edited the Msi in Orca, can you modify these tables from a C# custom action at runtime? We could set this to restart every time, but that might make our setup annoying (it will only need to restart on rare occasions). UPDATE: We tried setting: savedState["REBOOT"] = "Force";
 From within the Install() method of our custom action, but no luck. It doesn't seem like the IDictionary, savedState really does anything. Also tried: Context.Parameters["REBOOT"] = "Force";
 But I think this collection is just the command line arguments passed to the custom action. UPDATE: Is there a way to edit our MSI with Orca to make this trick work? Maybe schedule a reboot on a condition of some file existing? We have not found how to set MSI properties from a C# custom action. UPDATE: We tried hooking into AppDomain.ProcessExit and AppDomain.DomainUnload and starting a new thread and calling Process.GetCurrentProcess().WaitForExit() and none of those events will fire from within a C# custom action...

@TITLE:Is it worth to install the Compact Framework on storage card?
@CONTENT:Since our application grows, we need more space on our Windows CE devices. We installed SD-Cards. Running our applications from the sd card is slow and there are some heavy issues with demand-paging if you run the apps from persistent paths. The only option we see is to install the Compact Framework on the SD cards to free some memory. Is it worth to install it there? Will we get performance problems?

@TITLE:Ajax.BeginForm not hiding loading element when onBegin fails
@CONTENT:I'm using the Ajax.BeginForm helper in my MVC app. Here's a simplified example:     <% using (Ajax.BeginForm("actionName", new { Controller = "controller" }, new AjaxOptions
           {
               OnBegin = "doValidation",
               LoadingElementId = "ajaxLoader"
           }))
       { %>
 The problem is that if the OnBegin callback returns false, which correctly prevents the ajax call from being made, the loading element "ajaxLoader" is still displayed, and not hidden. I've tried using the OnFailure and OnComplete callbacks, but neither of these are called if the OnBegin callback fails. Interestingly the loading element is not displayed until after the OnBegin function has returned. I can get around this by explicitly showing and hiding the ajax loading element in custom javascript functions, but this seems like something the helper should really take care of for me.
@CODE:<% using (Ajax.BeginForm("actionName", new { Controller = "controller" }, new AjaxOptions
           {

Is .NET remoting really the best way to get RPC working, or should I look into WCF (as .NET remoting is going to be discontinued in favor of it?)? I only want communication with already known objects written in C#, so I don't need any of this XML/SOAP/etc. transport format stuff. The target application is meant to be distributed over a network, and communicate only with instances of itself.

@CONTENT:I'm using MySQL 5, and my database experienced some corruption last week. The technicians at my web host managed to save it, but the tables are all converted from the original InnoDB to MyISAM. Currently, some functions in my eCommerce application does not work. Is there a easy way for me to convert them back to InnoDB again? I can't find anything in phpMyAdmin. Do I need to write a PHP script? Thanks.

@CONTENT:My program is now still running to import data from a log file into a remote SQL Server Database. The log file is about 80MB in size and contains about 470000 lines, with about 25000 lines of data.

@TITLE:Winforms execute code in separate thread
@CONTENT:a bit of a juvenile question... I realise that in a Winforms app, long running code should be executed in its own thread. How does one accomplish this on say, a button click event? I want to do this in an effort to free up the UI thread so that I can simultaneously overlay the current form with a semi-transparent modal dialog form. I've aleady created the modal dialog form with a neat loading GIF located in the centre that works perfectly on a button click event on its own. The reason I've chosen this method, is because (1) I want to block any user interaction with the form while the code is being executed, and (2) provide the user with an indication that processing is underway (I dont know how to judge how long a particular piece of code will take to execute, hence opting for an indefinite loading indicator gif). Also, on the topic of executing code in separate threads...should this not apply to any code, or only specifically to long-running code? I would really appreciate any help on this matter! thank you!

@CONTENT:There are a ton of sql join q's already but I didn't see my answer so here goes . . . I am working with WPDB (Wordpress database)/EZSql/MySQL 5.0. Trying to achieve the 'simple' desired output below has not proven to be easy. Current output MemberID          MemberName              FruitName

-----------        --------------        ------------
1                  Al                    Apple, Cherry
 MemberID comes from table a, MemberName comes from table a and table b, and FruitName comes from table b. Because I am outputting a lot of other columns from table a, I have 'left joined' the two tables through this query: $contents = $wpdb->get_results( $wpdb->prepare("SELECT * FROM a LEFT JOIN b ON a.MemberName = b.MemberName"));
 I later print the columns using echo:         <td><?php echo $content->MemberID ?></td>
        <td><?php echo $content->MemberName ?></td>
        <td><?php echo $content->FruitName ?></td>
 I assume I should try to query/join the two tables in a different manner though it may be possible to get creative in printing the columns. I found this discussion here and modeled my question after it but I don't understand their solutions and am hoping for something simpler.

@TITLE:Voting economy: balancing credits properly
@CONTENT:Many websites today (including stackoverflow) and games allow people to perform voting, give feedback, enable additional features etc, according to a score: eg. reputation, or MMORPG credits. As a programmer that will probably need to implement a community based website in the near future, I am interested in knowing about the existence of basic algorithms and decisions to be made so that everything is balanced. For example, the fact that one vote up grants 10 reputations and one down grants -2 was arbitrary or properly weighted ? How to decide the price of a given item and the rewards in a MMORPG, so that everything is balanced? I guess that WoW designers relied on their experience, but I am also sure that this experience can be found somewhere written down. Although this is a social problem, the pricing of a given feature and the reward for a given task are technical/mathematical ones, as you need to give a value to each feature according to some mathematical criteria (although not easy to devise, I guess) Of course, this question could bring us far in terms of theory of economics, but I am sort of hoping that there are well defined and known simplified patterns and rules for this issue. I just don't know the keywords to query for.

So, whenever a Floor is added, removed, moved, or changed in the collection the Floor.Elevation properties need to be updated. In addition, I want to create a UI to edit this collection. I was thinking of using a DataGrid control where each Floor is listed with its Height and other properties as a row of the control. The user should be able to add, remove, and re order floors using the control. I'd like setting this up to be as easy and flexible as possible. Meaning I'd like to simply be able to bind the collection of Floors to the DataGrid and have the columns of the DataGrid populate based on the properties of the Floor class. If possible I'd like to be able to utilize the built in Add/Remove UI interface of the DataGrid control with out having to mess with setting up a bunch of event relationships between my collection and the DataGrid. To complicate things further in the future I'll need to be able to allow the user to dynamically add custom properties to the Floors that I'll want them to be able to see and edit in the DataGrid as well. I think I'd end up doing that by having Floor class implement IExtenderProvider. So ultimately the DataGrid would look something like this: 
Initial Properties      Future Custom User Properties

Height    Elevation     ProgramType    UnitType  UnitCount  
15'       70'           Residential    Luxury    5
15'       55'           Residential    Luxury    5
15'       40'           Residential    Budget    10
20'       20'           Retail         N/A       2
20'       0'            Retail         N/A       3
 My question now is what should I base my FloorList collection off of to allow for this functionality? The options I'm considering are as follows. 1) Inherit from List(Floor) Methods such as Add/Remove are not vitrual and thus I can't not override them to update the elevations 2) Implement IList(Floor) OnChange event is not built in so if the lists changes the DataGrid will not update (I think?) I think this is probably the best option but what would I need to do the ensure that changes to the FloorList collection or DataGrid are synced with one another? 3) Inherit from BindingList(Floor) Method like Add/Remove are not virtual so I can't modify them to update the floor elevations. 4) Implement IBindingList IBindinglist is not generic and I only want my collection to contain Floor objects

@TITLE:ifstream.read() vs. ifstream.readsome() in MSVC++7.1
@CONTENT:I just took some older code of a file reader that had been developed under Linux and tried to use that very same code in my Windows project compiled with MSVC++7.1. The code compiled without any problems, but the file seemed to be empty according to the file reader on Windows. I tracked the problem down to ifstream.readsome() that didn't read anything from the file, without setting any error flags on the stream. The code provided below compiles on either Linux and Windows, but Linux it works as expected. The code opens a file and reads the first 512 bytes of the file one time with read() and one time with readsome(). Both results are stored in two vectors that are compared at the end of the program. The expected result would be that the two vectors are equal. The result output of the program on Windows XP is posted below the source code. If anyone has any ideas or guesses what might go wrong in this code, I'd love to hear them. Full source code of demo: #include <iostream>

int main()

  if(in.is_open())
  {
    std::vector<char> buf1(BUFFER_SIZE);

@CONTENT:I am creating software that creates documents, (Bayesian network graphs to be exact), and these documents need to be saved in an XML format. I know how to create XML files, but I have yet to decide how to organise the code. At the moment, I plan on having each object (i.e. a Vertex or an Edge) have a function called getXML() (they will probably implement an interface so that it can be expanded later on). getXML() will return a string containing the XML for that object. There will be another object which will collect all these XML strings and put them together, and output an XML file. For some reason, I think this seems a bit messy, how would you recommend doing it?

@TITLE:Passing objects between managed object contexts
@CONTENT:I have an iphone app with 2 managed object contexts. One of my contexts deals with a picker, which allows the user to add new records and then select one of those new records. Once the picker is hidden, that managed object context is saved and discarded. I then want to use this selected object in my second managed object context, and add (relate) it to another object. This second MOC's changes may be saved or deleted. This is why the first MOC is created to allow the changes made in the picker to always be saved no matter wether they save or discard the changes in the second MOC. I hope this is clear! My problem is that when the user selects the object from the picker, this object resides in a different context to where it needs to be used. Is there a way you can pass objects between contexts? Perhaps using the object's ID (after it has been persisted). Thanks for your help!

@TITLE:Consuming apachesoap:Map complex datatype in webservice using .net
@CONTENT:I have a webservice programmed in coldfusion which I'm attempting to consume using c#.net. The particular webservices returns a coldfusion structure (a collection of items with a key and a value) which is exposed by the webservice as a complex object of type apachesoap:Map <wsdl:message name="getDetailResponse">
    <wsdl:part name="getDetailReturn" type="apachesoap:Map"/>
</wsdl:message>
 The complex type is correctly declared in the WSDL file automatically generated by coldfusion <schema targetNamespace="http://xml.apache.org/xml-soap">
    <import namespace="http://webservice.templates"/>
    <import namespace="http://rpc.xml.coldfusion"/>
    <import namespace="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/"/>

 When attempting to consume this using the following c# code: theWebservice.theWebservice myWS = new theWebservice.theWebservice();
theWebservice.Map myMap = myWS.searchForRecord("some record data");

if (myMap.item == null) {
    Response.Write("myMap.item is null");
}
 The code compiles fine but displays the "myMap.item is null" rather than being an object with a key and value pair. Inspection with the debugger shows myMap has two children item and itemField both of type theWebservice.mapItem[] and both of value null. I've seen other forum posts with a similar issue but no replies, does anyone know how I can consume the service correctly without having to alter the webservice to use just simple types?

@CONTENT:Is there a publically available library that will produce the exact same results for sin, cos, floor, ceil, exp and log on 32 bit and 64 bit linux, solaris and possibly other platforms? I am considering the following alternatives: a) cephes compiled with gcc -mfpmath=sse and the same optimization levels on each platform ... but its not clear that this would work. b) MPFR but I am worried that this would be too slow. Regarding precision (edited): For this particular application I don't really need something that produces the value that is numerically closest to the exact value. I just need the answers to be the exact same on all platforms, os and "bitness". That being said the values need to be reasonable (5 digits would probably be enough). I apologize for not having made this clear in my initial question. I guess MAPM or MPFR with a low enough precision setting might do the trick but I was hoping to find something that did not have the "multiple precision" machinery/flavor to it. In any case, I will try this out.

@TITLE:LinqToSQL - mapping out the DataContext with lots of tables?
@CONTENT:I've been working on a project where I have been using LinqToSQL that involved a lot of tables. All of these where mapped in one .dbml file (i.e. only one DataContext). I did this on the pretense that (currently) you cant join across multiple data contexts. For example... DB1DataContext db1 = new DB1DataContext();
DB2DataContext db2 = new DB2DataContext();

var query =
    from x in db1.SomeTable
    join y in db2.AnotherTable on x.Id equals y.Id
    select new
    {
        x.Column,
        y.Column
    };
 Someone argued that this isn't so, and I should break the .dbml file down into seperate smaller (i.e more managable) data contexts. I've now just set up an example, run a similar query to the one above and got the following error... base {System.SystemException} = {"The query contains references to items defined on a different data context."} I am curious, am I missing something? What are the common practices where there are a lot of tables that require mapping? How can you break down a .dbml file?
@CODE:LinqToSQL .dbml DataContext DB1DataContext db1 = new DB1DataContext();
DB2DataContext db2 = new DB2DataContext();

[sendButton setImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"sendButtonOn.png"] forState:UIControlStateHighlighted];  	
[sendButton setImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"sendButtonDisabled.png"] forState:UIControlStateDisabled];
 However the problem is, once you start setting UIImages to the states, setTitle no longer works. I think setTitle only works with non-UIButtonTypeCustom? This means I either have to put the text into the images themselves (not very robust) or subclass this and add a UILabel to the view? Sounds like alot of work :( Any ideas?

@CONTENT:we have a system where they client wants integrated Windows authentication. This is an ASP.NET 3.5 application, connecting to Sql Server 2005. The web server is Server 2003 R2 SP2. The db server is Server 2003 SP2 (not R2). In the db server, I ran the following script exec sp_grantlogin 'myDomain\myUserGroup'
USE myDbName
exec sp_grantdbaccess 'myDomain\myUserGroup'
 I have 3 users in the Windows user group 'myDomain\myUserGroup' right now. All three users' accounts are marked as trusted for delegation. The web server account in ADs is marked trusted for delegation. The web application is marked as using Windows authentication (all others turned off). The web.config has the following lines: <authentication mode="Windows" ></authentication>
<identity impersonate="true" />
<authorization>
    <deny users="?"/>
</authorization>
 Yet when i try to connect to the web application with a user which is in the user group, i get the error: System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException: 
Login failed for user 'NT AUTHORITY\ANONYMOUS LOGON'.
 My connection string is being built from a Sql ConnectionStringBuilder constructed as such: ConnectionStringBuilder.DataSource = "MYDBSERVER"
ConnectionStringBuilder.InitialCatalog = "MYDBCATALOG"
ConnectionStringBuilder.IntegratedSecurity = True
 If i HARD CODE one of the allowed accounts to impersonate on the web.config <identity /> line it works. But if i take off the hard coded account and try to pass the identity from the client's machine. I get the error. So it seems that i don't have something configured correctly for the multi-hop integrated login scenario, but i can't figure out what. Thanks in advance!

@TITLE:Fluent NHibernate mapping a CompositeId and Querying with SetProjection
@CONTENT:I have two tables (Section and SectionList) that are related by a many to many table (Membership). Since there is an extra property in the many to many table, i have to break it out into its own entity: 	public MembershipMap()
	{
		UseCompositeId()
			.WithKeyReference(x => x.Section, "SectionId")
			.WithKeyReference(x => x.SectionList, "SectionList"); 
		Map(x => x.Status);
	}
 And SectionList is mapped as follows: 	public SectionListMap()
	{
		Id(x => x.Id)
			.WithUnsavedValue(0);

		HasMany(x => x.Memberships)
			.Inverse()
			.Cascade.AllDeleteOrphan();
	}
 The relationship seems to work fine, except for when I try to run advanced queries on it. For instance, here is a query that grabs only certain fields and transforms to a DTO: 	var criteria = DetachedCriteria.For<CustomSectionListMembership>()
			.CreateAlias("SectionList", "sl")
            .CreateAlias("Section", "s")
			.CreateAlias("s.Website", "w")
			.CreateAlias("w.Publisher", "p")
			.SetProjection(Projections.ProjectionList()
				.Add(Projections.Property("s.Id"), "SectionId") //add projections for every propery you want returned
				.Add(Projections.Property("s.Name"), "SectionName") // mapping entity name -> DTO name
				.Add(Projections.Property("w.Id"), "WebsiteId")
				.Add(Projections.Property("w.Name"), "WebsiteName")
				.Add(Projections.Property("p.Id"), "PublisherId")
				.Add(Projections.Property("p.Name"), "PublisherName")
				.Add(Projections.Property("Status")))
			.Add(Expression.Eq("sl.Id", listId))
			.SetResultTransformer(Transformers.AliasToBean(typeof(MembershipDTO))); //transform to the DTO
	var membership = repository.FindAll(criteria);
 This query errors out with "could not execute query", because the query being generated is completely missing the inner joins that should have been generated by the CreateAlias calls: SELECT s2_.SectionId               as y0_,
   s2_.Name                    as y1_,
   w3_.WebsiteId               as y2_,
   w3_.Name                    as y3_,

   p4_.Name                    as y5_,
   this_.Status as y6_ FROM Membership this_ WHERE csl1_.ListId = 6923 /* @p0 */
 What could possibly be the problem?

 The compiler does not accept this. Why not? The set is not modifiable so there is no risk of non-Derived objects being inserted into it. How can I do this in the best way?

@CONTENT:I have a class with a static member like this: class C
{
  static Map m=new HashMap();
  {
    ... initialize the map with some values ...
  }
}
 AFAIK, this would consume memory practically to the end of the program. I was wondering, if I could solve it with soft references, like this: class C
{
  static volatile SoftReference<Map> m=null;
  static Map getM() {
    Map ret;
    if(m == null || (ret = m.get()) == null) {
      ret=new HashMap();
      ... initialize the map ...
      m=new SoftReference(ret);
    }
    return ret;
  }
}
 The question is is this approach (and the implementation) right? if it is, does it pay off in real situations?
@CODE:class C
{
  static Map m=new HashMap();
  {
    ... initialize the map with some values ...
  }
} class C
{
  static volatile SoftReference<Map> m=null;
  static Map getM() {
    Map ret;
    if(m == null || (ret = m.get()) == null) {
      ret=new HashMap();
      ... initialize the map ...
      m=new SoftReference(ret);
    }
    return ret;
  }
}

@TITLE:Upto What extent Reflection should be used?
@CONTENT:We've got into a very tricky scenario in a project. We have used lot of reflection in our project. We have .. Validation Framework driven by Attributes and Reflection Extension methods that transaforms a DataRow to an Entity Object using Attributes and Reflection and vice versa. The same thing we have done for DataTable and EntityCollections. IComparer interface implemented on generic EntityComparer class that uses reflection to compare two Entity OBjects. Like above scenarios we have used Reflections at many other parts in our appication. After using the reflection we have noticed that the application is taking more processing cycles with reflection. Upto what extent we should use Reflection in our project ? What are the areas of a project that are most adversely affected by reflection in terms of processing ? Where reflection will not make any performance impact ? Are there any guidelines on using Reflection ?

I only need to work with String dictionaries, not other object types of any kind.

@CONTENT:Does blocking mode put that particular task in a "Process Wait" state, as i think non-blocking sockets needs a "busy-wait" or "spin-lock" implementation, explicitly from the user. Or blocking mode sockets are nothing but implicit-implementations of busy-wait by the kernel. In locking mechanisms like semaphores/mutexes/monitors a lock is usually achieved by pushing the task in Blocked State. I think if such things are possible with locking, then socket locking might also be achieved by same way. I dont know for sure, I think polling is not a efficient way, esp for the kernel, as the kernel always has his hands full with so many tasks. thx.

@CONTENT:I've been looking for a tutorial on 3D per-vertex collision systems (using C# and XNA, since I have that readily available), but have only been able to put together bits and pieces. I have a pretty good understanding at this point, but there's one rather large, glaring hole in my understanding. Basically, my problem comes down to: how do I get the polys and their info? Does anyone have any good references? Note: while I'm using XNA and am most interested with that system, this is more of a self-educational exercise, and I am interested in how to do it in other systems if it's done differently (i.e OpenGL, etc.) Clarification: What I mean by "how do I get the polys", is if I have a 3D object, and perhaps even an animation applied to that object, is there a system for retrieving the rendered polys' information (positions, etc.) for testing? The most logical thing to do would be retrieve the poly information after it's been rendered, but that also sounds exceedingly expensive, and I'm not sure how to go about doing that anyway. I wasn't sure if there was a better way, or if retrieving rendered information at that level was even possible.

BarImplOne implements Bar
BarImplTwo implements Bar
 and some bindings like bind(new TypeLiteral<Foo<BarImplOne>>() {}).to(MyFooOne.class);
bind(new TypeLiteral<Foo<BarImplTwo>>() {}).to(MyFooTwo.class);
 then I want to be able to discover both bindings with something like Injector.findBindingsByType(TypeLiteral.get(Types.newParameterizedType(Foo.class, Types.subtypeOf(Bar.class))));
 Any ideas? Cheers Matt

@CONTENT:I am extending a class from a external library. Here is my code: Header file: Manager+MyCategory.h #import "Manager.h"
#import "Element.h"

@interface Manager (myCategory)

@end
 Implementation file: Manager+MyCategory.h file @implementation Manager (myCategory)

 Now here is how I use this category: #import "Manager+MyCategory.h"

@implementation myClass 

- (void) myFunction:(NSInteger)tag {
   Manager* myManager = [[Manager alloc] init];
   Element* = [myManager elementWithTag:tag];

   ...

   [myManager release];

 When I compile I have no warnings but when I run my program I get the following error: *** -[Manager elementWithTag:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x105d9a0
*** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: '*** -[Manager elementWithTag:]:
 Header file (ie Manager+MyCategory.h) is correctly imported but it looks like the link with the implementation file is not done. If I replace #import "Manager+MyCategory**.h**" by #import "Manager+MyCategory**.m**" in my class it's working properly. Anyone can explain me what I forgot? Thanks

@TITLE:Can one unroll a loop when working with an integer template parameter?
@CONTENT:I have the following code: template <int size>
inline uint hashfn( const char* pStr )
{
   uint result = *pStr;
   switch ( size )
   {
      case 10:
         result *= 4;

      case 9:

         result += *pStr;
   }
   return result;
}
 This code is a hash function for DNA sequences of certain lenghts where the length is a template parameter. It is an unrolled loop with a switch statement to jump in at the right spot. The size is however a constant since it is a template parameter. Could I specialize this for certain size values? Maybe with something like: template <int 2>
inline uint hashfn( const char* pStr )
{
  uint result = *pStr;
  result *= 4;
  ++pStr;
  result += *pStr;
  return result;

@LINK:/questions/1094944/how-can-i-disable-url-encoding-of-cookies-in-rails
@TITLE:How can I disable URL-encoding of cookies in Rails
@CONTENT:I have a Rails application that has to co-exist with a very old legacy application. The legacy application looks for a cookie that has a value containing a specific string of characters. Unfortunately, the characters in the legacy cookie often contain slashes. The problem I have is that when the Rails application writes the cookie it first does URL-encoding which causes the legacy app to break because the cookie values is incorrect. I had this working in Rails 1.13.5 by editing the file cookie_performance_fix.rb (Path: ./actionpack-1.13.5/lib/action_controller/cgi_ext/cookie_performance_fix.rb) In order to get this to work I changed the code as shown: def to_s
  buf = ""
  buf << @name << '='

  if @value.kind_of?(String)
    rails code. 
        #buf << CGI::escape(@value)
         buf << @value
  else
        #buf << @value.collect{|v| CGI::escape(v) }.join("&")
  	buf << @value.collect{|v| (v) }.join("&")

  end
 This actually worked fine until I decided to upgrade Rails to version 2.3.2 In Rails 2.3.2 the cookie_performance_fix.rb file no longer exists. I looked in the same directory and found a file called cookie.rb which I tried modifying in a similar fashion. def to_s
  buf = ''
  buf << @name << '='
  #buf << (@value.kind_of?(String) ? CGI::escape(@value) : @value.collect{|v| CGI::escape(v) }.join("&"))
    buf << (@value.kind_of?(String) ? @value : @value.collect{|v| (v) }.join("&"))
  buf << '; domain=' << @domain if @domain
  buf << '; path=' << @path if @path
  buf << '; expires=' << CGI::rfc1123_date(@expires) if @expires
  buf << '; secure' if @secure
  buf << '; HttpOnly' if @http_only
  buf
end
 This unfortunately does not seem to work. The cookie keeps getting URL-encoded in the new Rails 2.3.2. I know that turning off URL-encoding is not the best idea, but I don't have much choice until the legacy application is retired. I unfortunately do not have access to the legacy code to add support for URL-unencoding the cookie so I have to make sure the legacy cookie is written with the correct sequence including the slashes. If anyone can tell me how to turn off URL-encoding in Rails 2.3.2 it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

 A Watchlist can exist under multiple LoBs but the ReportCount will only be for the count of reports that exist under that LoB for that WatchList. I need them in the structure this way because the count of how many reports exist within a LoB for a given Watchlist is important elsewhere. What I need to do is get a list of the distinct WatchLists (grouped based on ID) and have the ReportCount be the SUM of that watchlist's ReportCount across all LoBs. I can't quite get the nested select logic to work right.

@LINK:/questions/1092817/net-declarative-security-why-is-securityaction-deny-impossible-to-work-with
@TITLE:.NET Declarative Security: Why is SecurityAction.Deny impossible to work with?
@CONTENT:I've been messing with this for about a day and a half now sifting through .NET reflector and MSDN docs, and can't figure anything out... As it stands in the .NET framework, you can demand that the current Principal belong to a role to be able to execute a method by marking a method like this: [PrincipalPermission(SecurityAction.Demand, Role = "CanEdit")]
public void Save() { ... }
 I am working with an existing security model that already has a "ReadOnly" role defined, so I need to do exactly the opposite of above... block the Save() method if a user is in the "ReadOnly" role. No problem, right? just flip the SecurityAction to .Deny: [PrincipalPermission(SecurityAction.Deny, Role = "ReadOnly")]
public void Save() { ... }
 Well, it turns out that this does nothing at all. The method still runs fine. It seems that the PrincipalPermissionAttribute defines: public override IPermission CreatePermission()
 But when the attribute is set to SecurityAction.Deny, this method is never called, so no IPermission object is ever created. Does anyone know of a way to get .Deny to work? I've been trying to make a custom secutiry attribute, but even that doesn't work. I tried to get tricky and do: public class MyPermissionAttribute : CodeAccessSecurityAttribute
{
	private SecurityAction securityAction;

	public MyPermissionAttribute(SecurityAction action)
		: base(SecurityAction.Demand)
	{
		if (action != SecurityAction.Demand && action != SecurityAction.Deny)
			throw new ArgumentException("Unsupported SecurityAction. Only Demand and Deny are supported.");
		this.securityAction = action;
	}

	public override IPermission CreatePermission()
	{
		// do something based on the SecurityAction...
	}
}
 Notice my attribute constructor always passes SecurityAction.Demand, which is the one action that would work previously. However, even in this case, the CreatePermission() method is still only called when the attribute is set to .Demand, and not .Deny! Maybe the runtime is actually checking the attribute instead of the SecurityAction passed to the CodeAccessSecurityAttribute constructor? I'm not sure what else to try here... anyone have any ideas? You wouldn't think it would be that hard to deny method access based on a role, instead of only demanding it. It really disturbed me that the default PrincipalPermission appears from within an IDE like it would be just fine doing a .Deny, and there is like a 1-liner in the MSDN docs that hint that it won't work. You would think the PrincipalPermissionAttribute constructor would throw an exception immediately if anything other that .Demand is specified, since that could create a big security hole! I never would have realized that .Deny does nothing at all if I hadn't been unit testing! Again, all this stems from having to deal with an existing security model that has a "ReadOnly" role that needs to be denied access, instead of doing it the other way around, where I cna just grant access to a role. Thanks for any help! Quick followup: I can actually make my custom attribute work by doing this: public class MyPermissionAttribute : CodeAccessSecurityAttribute
{
	public SecurityAction SecurityAction { get; set; }

	public MyPermissionAttribute(SecurityAction action)
		: base(action)
	{
	}

	public override IPermission CreatePermission()
	{
		switch(this.SecurityAction) { ... } // check Demand or Deny
	}
}
 And decorating the method: [MyPermission(SecurityAction.Demand, SecurityAction = SecurityAction.Deny, Role = "ReadOnly")]
public void Save() { ... }
 But that is terribly ugly, since I'm specifying both Demand and Deny in the same attribute. But it does work... Another interesting note: My custom class extends CodeAccessSecurityAttribute, which in turn only extends SecurityAttribute. If I cnage my custom class to directly extend SecurityAttribute, then nothing at all works. So it seems the runtime is definately looking for only CodeAccessSecurityAttribute instances in the metadata, and does something funny with the SecurityAction specified, even if a custom constructor overrides it.
@CODE:[PrincipalPermission(SecurityAction.Demand, Role = "CanEdit")]
public void Save() { ... } [PrincipalPermission(SecurityAction.Deny, Role = "ReadOnly")]
public void Save() { ... } public override IPermission CreatePermission() public class MyPermissionAttribute : CodeAccessSecurityAttribute
{
	private SecurityAction securityAction;

	public MyPermissionAttribute(SecurityAction action)
		: base(SecurityAction.Demand)
	{
		if (action != SecurityAction.Demand && action != SecurityAction.Deny)
			throw new ArgumentException("Unsupported SecurityAction. Only Demand and Deny are supported.");
		this.securityAction = action;
	}

	public override IPermission CreatePermission()
	{
		// do something based on the SecurityAction...
	}
} public class MyPermissionAttribute : CodeAccessSecurityAttribute
{
	public SecurityAction SecurityAction { get; set; }

	public MyPermissionAttribute(SecurityAction action)
		: base(action)
	{
	}

	public override IPermission CreatePermission()
	{
		switch(this.SecurityAction) { ... } // check Demand or Deny
	}
} [MyPermission(SecurityAction.Demand, SecurityAction = SecurityAction.Deny, Role = "ReadOnly")]
public void Save() { ... }
