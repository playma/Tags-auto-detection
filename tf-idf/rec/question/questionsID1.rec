@TITLE:error: 'Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (2)'
@CONTENT:I'm just new to mysql so I apologize for any silly questions. My problem started off with me not being able to log in as root anymore into my mysql install. I was attempting to run mysql without passwords turned on... but whenever I would run the command :     # mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables &
 I would never get a prompt back... (I was trying to follow the instructions here: http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/recover-mysql-root-password.html) The screen just looks like this:  root@jj-SFF-PC:/usr/bin# mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables
 120816 11:40:53 mysqld_safe Logging to syslog.

 and I don't get a prompt to start typing the sql commands to reset the password. When I kill it by doing a CTRL + C, I get the following message: error: 'Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (2)' Check that mysqld is running and that the socket: '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' exists! If I retry the command and leave it long enough, I do get the following series of messages: root@jj-SFF-PC:/run/mysqld# 120816 13:15:02 mysqld_safe Logging to syslog.

 But then if i try to log in as root by doing: # mysql -u root
 I get the following error message: ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (2)
 I checked and /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock file doesn't not exist. The folder does, but not the file. Also, I dunno if this helps or not, but I found did a find / -name mysqld and it came up with: /var/run/mysqld - folder
/usr/sbin/mysqld - file
/run/mysqld - folder
 I'm just new to linux and mysql, so i don't know if this is normal or not. But I'm including this info just in case it helps ... ** I finally decided to uninstall and reinstall mysql. ** apt-get remove mysql-server
apt-get remove mysql-client
apt-get remove mysql-common
apt-get remove phpmyadmin
 After resintalling all packages again in the same order as above, during the phpmyadmin install, it gave me the same error - ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (2)
 So I tried again to uninstall/reinstall. This time, after I uninstalled the packages, I also manually renamed all mysql files and directories to mysql.bad in their respective locations.  /var/lib/mysql

 It seems that it has two BuildConfig files and also two R classes. How can I resolve the issue? EDIT: I have noticed that the compiler compiles two R.java files: the one that is in my project folder and another one that is located in the folder %USERPROFILE%.AndroidStudioPreview So, I tried to exclude this "Preview" folder in the compiler settings and now it's working. This issue only occurs after I have started to use Google Play Services classes in my project. I will appreciate if someone can explain the reason behind this problem.

@TITLE:Database design for a survey
@CONTENT:I need to create a survey where answers are stored in a database. I'm just wondering what would be the best way to implement this in the database, specifically the tables required. The survey contains different types of questions. For example: text fields for comments, multiple choice questions, and possibly questions that could contain more than one answer (i.e. check all that apply). I've come up with two possible solutions: Create a giant table which contains the answers for each survey submission. Each column would correspond to an answer from the survey. i.e. SurveyID, Answer1, Answer2, Answer3 I don't think this is the best way since there are a lot of questions in this survey and doesn't seem very flexible if the survey is to change. The other thing I thought of was creating a Question table and Answer table. The question table would contain all the questions for the survey. The answer table would contain individual answers from the survey, each row linked to a question. A simple example: tblSurvey: SurveyID tblQuestion: QuestionID, SurveyID, QuestionType, Question tblAnswer: AnswerID, UserID, QuestionID, Answer tblUser: UserID, UserName My problem with this is that there could be tons of answers which would make the Answer table pretty huge. I'm not sure that's so great when it comes to performance. I'd appreciate any ideas and suggestions.

Therefore I looked around and found these other three libs. I would be glad to get some recommendations on which lib to choose. EDIT: I am not sure which components I need. I want to achieve the following: Network device information is parsed by my application and then it computes a neighborship table of all devices. This neighborship table should then be visualized. It would be nice to get two output formats - a picture (i.e. PNG, GIF, or JPEG...) and a user-editable format. For the last mentioned, the user will then start a third-party application to edit the graph. But graph computation should be done by the graph lib used. Maybe I am too naive, but if this the case, please clarify what I am missing. EDIT #2 Added OGDF

@TITLE:Is main() really start of a C++ program?
@CONTENT:The section $3.6.1/1 from the C++ Standard reads, A program shall contain a global function called main, which is the designated start of the program. Now consider this code, int square(int i) { return i*i; }
int user_main()
{ 
    for ( int i = 0 ; i < 10 ; ++i )
           std::cout << square(i) << endl;
    return 0;
}
int main_ret= user_main();
int main() 
{
        return main_ret;
}
 This sample code does what I intend it to do, i.e printing the square of integers from 0 to 9, before entering into the main() function which is supposed to be the "start" of the program. Have a look at the output here : http://www.ideone.com/Niy0R I also compiled it with -pedantic option, GCC 4.5.0. It gives no error, not even warning! So my question is, Is this code really Standard conformant? If it's standard conformant, then does it not invalidate what the Standard says? main() is not start of this program! user_main() executed before the main(). I understand that to initialize the global variable main_ret, the use_main() executes first but that is a different thing altogether; the point is that, it does invalidate the quoted statement $3.6.1/1 from the Standard, as main() is NOT the start of the program; it is in fact the end of this program! EDIT: How do you define the word 'start'? It boils down to the definition of the phrase "start of the program". So how exactly do you define it?
@CODE:int square(int i) { return i*i; }
int user_main()
{ 
    for ( int i = 0 ; i < 10 ; ++i )
           std::cout << square(i) << endl;
    return 0;

@TITLE:Is this the correct layout to detect iBeacons with AltBeacon's Android Beacon Library?
@CONTENT:I have successfully modified the reference implementation app of the Android Beacon Library using the following beacon layout, so that it detects an iBeacon device that I have at hand: public class MainActivity extends Activity {
    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        BeaconManager beaconManager = BeaconManager.getInstanceForApplication(this);
        beaconManager.getBeaconParsers().add(new BeaconParser().
               setBeaconLayout("m:0-3=4c000215,i:4-19,i:20-21,i:22-23,p:24-24"));
        beaconManager.bind(this);
    }
}
 Being new to the internals of BLE packets, I'm not sure if this is the correct layout to use. The library endorses the AltBeacon standard and its documentation does not mention how to detect iBeacon devices. Will this code detect all iBeacon devices? i.e. is the m: prefix too restrictive or is it the right byte sequence that matches the iBeacon spec? Similarly, does the rest of the layout exactly match the iBeacon spec? Reference: Example of an iBeacon packet seen on SO
@CODE:public class MainActivity extends Activity {
    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        BeaconManager beaconManager = BeaconManager.getInstanceForApplication(this);
        beaconManager.getBeaconParsers().add(new BeaconParser().
               setBeaconLayout("m:0-3=4c000215,i:4-19,i:20-21,i:22-23,p:24-24"));

@TITLE:extern inline
@CONTENT:I understand that "inline" by itself is a suggestion to the compiler, and at its descretion it may or may not inline the function, and it will also produce linkable object code. I think that "static inline" does the same (may or may not inline) but will not produce linkable object code when inlined (since no other module could link to it). Where does "extern inline" fit into the picture? Assume I want to replace a preprocessor macro by an inline function and require that this function gets inlined (e.g., because it uses the __FILE__ and __LINE__ macros which should resolve for the caller but not this called function). That is, I want to see a compiler or linker error in case the function does not get inlined. Does "extern inline" do this? (I assume that, if it does not, there is no way to achieve this behavior other than sticking with a macro.) Are there differences between C++ and C? Are there differences between different compiler vendors and versions?

I have googled it and looked at it before, but I just need it put into children's terms if you will please. As I understand it right now, things like SVN are for storing your code online for a group of users or other developers to have access to the same code. Once you update some code, you can submit the new version and the SVN will keep copies of old code as well as the new ones you update. Is this the basic idea of it or am I getting it completely wrong? If I am right, then it might not be much use if I: Do not have other people working on the code. Do not plan on letting others have the code.

@TITLE:Best practice to make a multi language application in C#/WinForms? [closed]
@CONTENT:I've been looking into making applications suitable for multiple languages in C# since I need to work on a small project where this is the case. I have found basically two ways to do this: Set a form's Localizable property to true, set the Language property, fill all the labels and such, and you're 'done'. The major drawback I see in this is: how to make other stuff which is not part of a form ready for multiple languages (e.g. pop-up windows, log files or windows, etc). Create a resource file, for example 'Lang.en-us.resx' and one for every language, for example 'Lang.nl-nl.resx' and fill it up with Strings. The IDE seems to generate a class for me automatically, so in the code I can just use Lang.SomeText. The biggest drawback I see in this is: for every form I need to set all the labels and other captions myself in the code (and it doesn't seem data binding works with these resources). I'm sure, however, that there are other methods to do this as well. So, what is the best practice? What's the easiest for small applications (a few forms, database connection etc) and what scales best for larger applications?

The closest thing is to use the AudioToolbox framework to play a short, constant vibration: AudioServicesPlaySystemSound(kSystemSoundID_Vibrate);

 ===== Original question ===== I'm trying to connect to a Zeemote (http://zeemote.com/) gaming controller from Moto Droid running 2.0.1 firmware. The test application below does connect to the device (LED flashes) but connection is dropped immediately after that. I'm pasting two test apps below: one that actually tries to read from input stream and second one that just sits there, waiting for the device to disconnect after 5 seconds. And yes, I do have third version :) which first waits for ACL_CONNECTED and then opens socket but there's nothing new in its behaviour. Some background info: I can connect to the Zeemote from my laptop perfectly fine using bluez tools (log attached as well). I know for sure that Droid is able to talk to Zeemote as well because 'Game Pro' from the Market works fine with it (but then it's a driver/service so maybe it uses lower-level API?). I noticed that 'adb bugreport' reports neither UUID nor RFCOMM channel for Zeemote while it does so for all other devices (including Moto HS815 headset, another dumb device for which 'sdp browse' reports nothing). Also, when the device boots, Zeemote's priority is 0 (others have priority 100+). I'm quite at a loss here, I worked on it for so long that I ran out of ideas so any help would be very much appreciated (even if you don't know the answer :) ) Thanks, Max Test application No. 1 This app tries to actually read from the device. ===== Code =====

@CONTENT:Let's suppose you have a page with a relatively strict doctype and HTML markup that's pretty close to compliant, but perhaps misses in a few silly ways, perhaps because of user content that's out of your control... say you're working on a content management system or a theme for a content management system where you control some basic structure and need some javascript, but you're not responsible for everything else that goes into pages. How can you tell (or: what will determine) when the browser decides to go into "quirks" mode rather than use it's more standards compliant engine? I'm looking for answers for each of the major browsers, since IE, Chrome, Safari, and Firefox will of course all handle that differently. Is one single error enough to force it or do you have some leeway?

@TITLE:UILabel - string as text and links
@CONTENT:I have a UILabel whose text I am getting from a server. Some of the text is to be identified as links, and on touching those links some action should be performed. e.g. NSString *str = @"My phone number is 645-345-2345 and my address is xyz"; This is the complete text for UILabel. I have only one UILabel for displaying this text (Text is dynamic. I just gave an example.). On clicking these links I need to perform actions like navigating to some different screen or make a call. I know that I can display such text with help of OHAttributedLabel. And the links can be displayed as follows : [label1 addCustomLink:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://www.foodreporter.net"] inRange:[txt rangeOfString:someString]];  
 But I wonder how can I make these text links perform some action like navigation to different screen or making a call. Let me know if more explanation is required.

@CONTENT:I am trying to get the following effect using a UITextView: Basically I want to insert an image between text.

[pictureView setBackgroundColor:[UIColor redColor]];
[self.textView addSubview:pictureView];
 But it seems to float over the text and cover it. I did a bit of reading on exclusion paths which appears to be one way of implementing this. However, I don't want to absolutely position the image - instead, it should flow with the text (similar to how <span> behaves in HTML).

@TITLE:Algorithm for Determining Tic Tac Toe Game Over
@CONTENT:I've written a game of tic-tac-toe in Java, and my current method of determining the end of the game accounts for the following possible scenarios for the game being over: The board is full, and no winner has yet been declared: Game is a draw. Cross has won. Circle has won. Unfortunately, to do so, it reads through a predefined set of these scenarios from a table. This isn't necessarily bad considering that there are only 9 spaces on a board, and thus the table is somewhat small, but is there a better algorithmic way of determining if the game is over? The determination of whether someone has won or not is the meat of the problem, since checking if 9 spaces are full is trivial. The table method might be the solution, but if not, what is? Also, what if the board were not size n=9? What if it were a much larger board, say n=16, n=25, and so on, causing the number of consecutively placed items to win to be x=4, x=5, etc? A general algorithm to use for all n = { 9, 16, 25, 36 ... }?

@TITLE:Multiple user models with Ruby On Rails and devise to have separate registration routes but one common login route
@CONTENT:First, I've searched intensely with Google and Yahoo and I've found several replies on topics like mine, but they all don't really cover what I need to know. I've got several user models in my app, for now it's Customers, Designers, Retailers and it seems there are yet more to come. They all have different data stored in their tables and several areas on the site they're allowed to or not. So I figured to go the devise+CanCan way and to try my luck with polymorphic associations, so I got the following models setup: class User < AR
  belongs_to :loginable, :polymorphic => true
end

class Customer < AR
  has_one :user, :as => :loginable
end

class Designer < AR
  has_one :user, :as => :loginable
end

class Retailer < AR
  has_one :user, :as => :loginable
end
 For the registration I've got customized views for each different User type and my routes are setup like this: devise_for :customers, :class_name => 'User'
devise_for :designers, :class_name => 'User'
devise_for :retailers, :class_name => 'User'
 For now the registrations controller is left as standard (which is "devise/registrations"), but I figured, since I got different data to store in different models I'd have to customize this behaviour as well!? But with this setup I got helpers like customer_signed_in? and designer_signed_in?, but what I'd really need is a general helper like user_signed_in? for the areas on the site that are accessible to all users, no matter which user type. I'd also like a routes helper like new_user_session_path instead of the several new_*type*_session_path and so on. In fact all I need to be different is the registration process... So I was wondering IF THIS IS THE WAY TO GO for this problem??? Or is there a better/easier/less must-customize solution for this??? Thanks in advance, Robert

@TITLE:Conditionally ignoring tests in JUnit 4
@CONTENT:OK, so the @Ignore annotation is good for marking that a test case shouldn't be run. However, sometimes I want to ignore a test based on runtime information. An example might be if I have a concurrency test that needs to be run on a machine with a certain number of cores. If this test were run on a uniprocessor machine, I don't think it would be correct to just pass the test (since it hasn't been run), and it certainly wouldn't be right to fail the test and break the build. So I want to be able to ignore tests at runtime, as this seems like the right outcome (since the test framework will allow the build to pass but record that the tests weren't run). I'm fairly sure that the annotation won't give me this flexibility, and suspect that I'll need to manually create the test suite for the class in question. However, the documentation doesn't mention anything about this and looking through the API it's also not clear how this would be done programmatically (i.e. how do I programatically create an instance of Test or similar that is equivalent to that created by the @Ignore annotation?). If anyone has done something similar in the past, or has a bright idea of how else I could go about this, I'd be happy to hear about it.

@TITLE:When would I need a SecureString in .NET?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to grok the purpose of .NET's SecureString. From MSDN: An instance of the System.String class is both immutable and, when no longer needed, cannot be programmatically scheduled for garbage collection; that is, the instance is read-only after it is created and it is not possible to predict when the instance will be deleted from computer memory. Consequently, if a String object contains sensitive information such as a password, credit card number, or personal data, there is a risk the information could be revealed after it is used because your application cannot delete the data from computer memory. A SecureString object is similar to a String object in that it has a text value. However, the value of a SecureString object is automatically encrypted, can be modified until your application marks it as read-only, and can be deleted from computer memory by either your application or the .NET Framework garbage collector. The value of an instance of SecureString is automatically encrypted when the instance is initialized or when the value is modified. Your application can render the instance immutable and prevent further modification by invoking the MakeReadOnly method. Is the automatic encryption the big payoff? And why can't I just say: SecureString password = new SecureString("password");
 instead of SecureString pass = new SecureString();
foreach (char c in "password".ToCharArray())
    pass.AppendChar(c);
 What aspect of SecureString am I missing?

foreach (char c in "password".ToCharArray())

@CONTENT:Suppose I have ViewModel like public class AnotherViewModel

}
public class MyViewModel
{
   public string Name { get; set; }
   public AnotherViewModel Child { get; set; }
   public AnotherViewModel Child2 { get; set; }
}
 In the view I can render a partial with <% Html.RenderPartial("AnotherViewModelControl", Model.Child) %>
 In the partial I'll do <%= Html.TextBox("Name", Model.Name) %>
or
<%= Html.TextBoxFor(x => x.Name) %>
 However, the problem is that both will render name="Name" while I need to have name="Child.Name" in order for model binder to work properly. Or, name="Child2.Name" when I render the second property using the same partial view. How do I make my partial view automatically recognize the required prefix? I can pass it as a parameter but this is too inconvenient. This is even worse when I want for example to render it recursively. Is there a way to render partial views with a prefix, or, even better, with automatic reconition of the calling lambda expression so that <% Html.RenderPartial("AnotherViewModelControl", Model.Child) %>
 will automatically add correct "Child." prefix to the generated name/id strings? I can accept any solution, including 3-rd party view engines and libraries - I actually use Spark View Engine (I "solve" the problem using its macros) and MvcContrib, but did not find a solution there. XForms, InputBuilder, MVC v2 - any tool/insight that provide this functionality will be great. Currently I think about coding this myself but it seems like a waste of time, I can't believe this trivial stuff is not implemented already. A lot of manual solutions may exists, and all of them are welcome. For example, I can force my partials to be based off IPartialViewModel<T> { public string Prefix; T Model; }. But I'd rather prefer some existing/approved solution. UPDATE: there's a similar question with no answer here.

@TITLE:Detect virtualized OS from an application?
@CONTENT:I need to detect whether my application is running within a virtualized OS instance or not. I've found an article with some useful information on the topic. The same article appears in multiple places, I'm unsure of the original source. VMware implements a particular invalid x86 instruction to return information about itself, while VirtualPC uses a magic number and I/O port with an IN instruction. This is workable, but appears to be undocumented behavior in both cases. I suppose a future release of VMWare or VirtualPC might change the mechanism. Is there a better way? Is there a supported mechanism for either product? Similarly, is there a way to detect Xen or VirtualBox? I'm not concerned about cases where the platform is deliberately trying to hide itself. For example, honeypots use virtualization but sometimes obscure the mechanisms that malware would use to detect it. I don't care that my app would think it is not virtualized in these honeypots, I'm just looking for a "best effort" solution. The application is mostly Java, though I'm expecting to use native code plus JNI for this particular function. Windows XP/Vista support is most important, though the mechanisms described in the referenced article are generic features of x86 and don't rely on any particular OS facility.

@TITLE:How Should I Declare Foreign Key Relationships Using Code First Entity Framework (4.1) in MVC3?
@CONTENT:I have been searching for resources on how to declare foreign key relationships and other constraints using code first EF 4.1 without much luck. Basically I am building the data model in code and using MVC3 to query that model. Everything works via MVC which is great (kudos to Microsoft!) but now I want it NOT to work because I need to have data model constraints. For example, I have a Order object that has a ton of properties that are external objects (tables). Right now I can create an Order no problem, but without being able to add the foreign key or external objects. MVC3 sets this up no problem. I realize that I could just add the objects myself in the controller class prior to save, but I would like the call to DbContext.SaveChanges() to fail if the constraint relationships have not been met. NEW INFORMATION So, specifically, I would like an exception to occur when I attempt to save an Order object without specifying a customer object. This does not seem to be the behavior if I just compose the objects as described in most Code First EF documentation. Latest code: public class Order
{
    public int Id { get; set; }

    [ForeignKey( "Parent" )]
    public Patient Patient { get; set; }

    [ForeignKey("CertificationPeriod")]
    public CertificationPeriod CertificationPeriod { get; set; }

    [ForeignKey("Agency")]
    public Agency Agency { get; set; }

    [ForeignKey("Diagnosis")]
    public Diagnosis PrimaryDiagnosis { get; set; }

    [ForeignKey("OrderApprovalStatus")]
    public OrderApprovalStatus ApprovalStatus { get; set; }

    [ForeignKey("User")]
    public User User { get; set; }

    [ForeignKey("User")]
    public User Submitter { get; set; }

    public DateTime ApprovalDate { get; set; }
    public DateTime SubmittedDate { get; set; }
    public Boolean IsDeprecated { get; set; }
}
 This is the error I get now when accessing the VS generated view for Patient: ERROR MESSAGE The ForeignKeyAttribute on property 'Patient' on type 'PhysicianPortal.Models.Order' is not valid. The foreign key name 'Parent' was not found on the dependent type 'PhysicianPortal.Models.Order'. The Name value should be a comma separated list of foreign key property names. Regards, Guido

@CONTENT:For my app, Transdroid, I am connecting to remote servers via HTTP and optionally securely via HTTPS. For these HTTPS connections with the HttpClient I am using a custom SSL socket factory implementation to make sure self-signed certificates are working. Basically, I accept everything and ignore every checking of any certificate. This has been working fine for some time now, but it no longer work for Android 2.2 FroYo. When trying to connect, it will return an exception: java.io.IOException: SSL handshake failure: I/O error during system call, Broken pipe
 Here is how I initialize the HttpClient:     SchemeRegistry registry = new SchemeRegistry();
    registry.register(new Scheme("http", new PlainSocketFactory(), 80));
    registry.register(new Scheme("https", (trustAll ? new FakeSocketFactory() : SSLSocketFactory.getSocketFactory()), 443));

 I make use of a FakeSocketFactory and FakeTrustManager, of which the source can be found here: http://code.google.com/p/transdroid/source/browse/#svn/trunk/src/org/transdroid/util Again, I don't understand why it suddenly stopped work, or even what the error 'Broken pipe' means. I have seen messages on Twitter that Seesmic and Twidroid fail with SSL enabled on FroYo as well, but am unsure if it's related. Thanks for any directions/help!

Divide by zero error encountered.
 What is the best way to write SQL code, so that I will never see this error message again? I mean, I could add a where clause so that my divisor is never zero. Or I could add a case statement, so that there is a special treatment for zero. Is the best way to use a NullIf clause? Is there better way, or how can this be enforced?

@TITLE:Why is creating a Thread said to be expensive?
@CONTENT:The Java tutorials say that creating a Thread is expensive. But why exactly is it expensive? What exactly is happening when a Java Thread is created that makes its creation expensive? I'm taking the statement as true, but I'm just interested in mechanics of Thread creation in JVM. Thread lifecycle overhead. Thread creation and teardown are not free. The actual overhead varies across platforms, but thread creation takes time, introducing latency into request processing, and requires some processing activity by the JVM and OS. If requests are frequent and lightweight, as in most server applications, creating a new thread for each request can consume significant computing resources.

@LINK:/questions/6231973/difference-between-list-list-listt-liste-and-listobject
@TITLE:Difference between List, List<?>, List<T>, List<E>, and List<Object>
@CONTENT:What are the differences between List, List<?>, List<T>, List<E>, and List<Object>? Now I do not blindly ask this question, so please don't close this thread. Let me first introduce the base code: private static List<String> names = new ArrayList<String>();
static {
    names.add("Tom");
    names.add("Peter");
    names.add("Michael");
    names.add("Johnson");
    names.add("Vlissides");
}

public static void test(List<String> set){
    System.out.println(set);
}
public static void main(String args[]){
    test(names);
}
 I do understand that: 1.List: is a raw type, therefore not typesafe. It will only generate a runtime error when the casting is bad. We want a compile time error when the cast is bad. Not recommended to use. 2.List<?>: is an unbounded wildcard. But not sure what this is for? So if I change the test method to public static void test(List<?> set){
    System.out.println(set);
}
 it still works good. If you can explain the usage of this, I would greatly appreciate it. EDIT: If I do this: public static void test(List<?> set){
    set.add(new Long(2)); //--> Error
    set.add("2");    //--> Error
    System.out.println(set);
}
 but if I change test to this: public static void test(List<String> set){
    set.add(new Long(2)); //--> Error
    set.add("2");    //--> Work
    System.out.println(set);
}
 3.List<T>: public static void test(List<T> set){   //T cannot be resolved
    System.out.println(set);
}
 I guess I don't understand this syntax. I saw something like this, and it works: public <T> T[] toArray(T[] a){
    return a;   
}
 Please explain this for me please? Sometimes, I see <T>, or <E>, or <U>, <T,E>. Are they all the same or do they represent something different? 4.List<Object> public static void test(List<Object> set){
    System.out.println(set);
}
 Then I got the error The method test(List<Object>) is not application for the argument List<String> for the below code. I am confused. I thought String was a subset of Object? public static void main(String args[]){
    test(names); 
}
 EDIT: If I try this test((List<Object>)names);
 then I got Cannot cast from List<String> to List<Object>
@CODE:List List<?> List<T> List<E> List<Object> private static List<String> names = new ArrayList<String>();

@TITLE:Why is PDO better for escaping MySQL queries/querystrings than mysql_real_escape_string?
@CONTENT:I've been told that I'd be better using PDO for MySQL escaping, rather than mysql_real_escape_string. Maybe I'm having a brain-dead day (or it may be the fact I'm by no stretch of the imagination a natural programmer, and I'm still very much at the newbie stage when it comes to PHP), but having checked out the PHP manual and read the entry on PDO, I'm still no clearer as to what PDO actually is and why it's better than using mysql_real_escape_string. This may be because I've not really got to grips with the complexities of OOP yet (I'm assuming it's something to do with OOP), but other than the fact that variables and array values seem to have a colon infront of them, I'm still not sure what it actually is and how you use it (and why it's better than mysql_real_escape_string. (It also may have something to do with the fact that I don't really have a clear understanding of what 'classes' are, so when I read "PDO class" I'm none the wiser really). Having read an article or two on the 'Developer Zone' bit of the MySQL website, I'm still no clearer. As I can't even figure out what it is at the moment, I think probably using it is a bit beyond me right now, but I'm still interested in broadening my education and finding out how I could improve things. Could anyone explain to me in 'plain English' what PDO is (or point me in the direction of something on the subject written in plain English), and how you'd go about using it?

@TITLE:How do I manage cookies with HttpClient in Android and/or Java?
@CONTENT:I am trying to login to a site and maintain that session/cookie so that the server will recognize my login, but I am struggling to figure out a way of extracting the cookie from the response and setting into a request to maintain my login. I'm wondering if I should go about taking the header "Set-Cookie" or using a CookieStore. Any help is greatly appreciated. Here is my code that I have, with comments where I think the getHeader/getCookie methods would go. public class Http
{
DefaultHttpClient client = new DefaultHttpClient();
HttpGet request;
HttpEntity entity;
HttpResponse response;
HttpPost post;
CookieStore cookieStore = new BasicCookieStore();
HttpContext localContext = new BasicHttpContext();

public static void setContext()
{
    localContext.setAttribute(ClientContext.COOKIE_STORE, cookieStore);
}

public static void getPage(String url) throws Exception
{
    request = new HttpGet(url);
    response = client.execute(request, localContext);
    PARSER.preParse(url, response);
}

public static HttpResponse postPage(List<NameValuePair> params, String host, String action) throws Exception
{
    post = new HttpPost(host + action);
    post.setEntity(new UrlEncodedFormEntity(params, HTTP.UTF_8));

    response = client.execute(post, localContext);

    entity = response.getEntity();
    if(entity != null)
    {
        entity.consumeContent();
    }

    return response;
}


public void destoyHttp()
{
    client.getConnectionManager().shutdown();
}
}
 In hopes of others better understanding my confusion am adding code that I know DOES work and maintains a session but when I tried to move the code into my actual application it broke somewhere down the line. public class HttpClientTest extends Activity{

DefaultHttpClient client = new DefaultHttpClient();
HttpGet request;
HttpEntity entity;
List<Cookie> cookies;
HttpResponse response;
HttpPost post;

@Override
public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    try {
        getRequest();
    } catch (Exception e) {
        Log.d("My Activity", "Failed");
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}

public void getRequest() throws Exception
{
    final String TAG = "MyActivity";
    request = new HttpGet("http://gc.gamestotal.com/i.cfm?p=login&se=4");
    response = client.execute(request);

    String action = "i.cfm?&1028&p=login&se=4";
    String yourServer = "http://gc.gamestotal.com/";
    post = new HttpPost(yourServer + action);

    List<NameValuePair> params = new ArrayList<NameValuePair>();
    params.add(new BasicNameValuePair("nic", "myusername"));
    params.add(new BasicNameValuePair("password", "mypassword"));
    params.add(new BasicNameValuePair("server", "4"));

    post.setEntity(new UrlEncodedFormEntity(params, HTTP.UTF_8));


    response = client.execute(post);
    entity = response.getEntity();

    if(entity != null){
        entity.consumeContent();
    }

    request = new HttpGet("http://gc.gamestotal.com/i.cfm?f=com_empire&cm=3");

    response = client.execute(request);

    if(entity != null)
    {
        entity.consumeContent();
    }    

}

}
 I know for a fact it works, and you can see that in this code I consumeContent() but adding that to the top code didn't seem to make a difference so I left it out. Any Ideas? Edit: I am still unable to get the code working in keeping a session going. I am posting the cookies from my current code, along with the cookies of the second code that is working. Perhaps someone will notice an issue, I certainly do not. 08-31 06:53:50.318: VERBOSE/SFGC(496): - [version: 0][name: CFID][value: 26651316][domain: gc.gamestotal.com][path: /][expiry: Sun Sep 27 00:00:00 GMT+00:00 2037]

@LINK:/questions/15568100/confused-when-boostasioio-service-run-method-blocks-unblocks
@TITLE:Confused when boost::asio::io_service run method blocks/unblocks
@CONTENT:Being a total beginner to Boost.Asio, I am confused with io_service::run(). I would appreciate it if someone could explain to me when this method blocks/unblocks. The documentations states: The run() function blocks until all work has finished and there are no more handlers to be dispatched, or until the io_service has been stopped. Multiple threads may call the run() function to set up a pool of threads from which the io_service may execute handlers. All threads that are waiting in the pool are equivalent and the io_service may choose any one of them to invoke a handler. A normal exit from the run() function implies that the io_service object is stopped (the stopped() function returns true). Subsequent calls to run(), run_one(), poll() or poll_one() will return immediately unless there is a prior call to reset(). What does the following statement mean? [...] no more handlers to be dispatched [...] While trying to understand the behavior of io_service::run(), I came across this example (example 3a). Within it, I observe that io_service->run() blocks and waits for work orders. // WorkerThread invines io_service->run()
void WorkerThread(boost::shared_ptr<boost::asio::io_service> io_service);
void CalculateFib(size_t);

boost::shared_ptr<boost::asio::io_service> io_service(
    new boost::asio::io_service);
boost::shared_ptr<boost::asio::io_service::work> work(
   new boost::asio::io_service::work(*io_service));

// ...

boost::thread_group worker_threads;
for(int x = 0; x < 2; ++x)
{
  worker_threads.create_thread(boost::bind(&WorkerThread, io_service));
}

io_service->post( boost::bind(CalculateFib, 3));
io_service->post( boost::bind(CalculateFib, 4));
io_service->post( boost::bind(CalculateFib, 5));

work.reset();
worker_threads.join_all();
 However, in the following code that I was working on, the client connects using TCP/IP and the run method blocks until data is asynchronously received. typedef boost::asio::ip::tcp tcp;
boost::shared_ptr<boost::asio::io_service> io_service(
    new boost::asio::io_service);
boost::shared_ptr<tcp::socket> socket(new tcp::socket(*io_service));

// Connect to 127.0.0.1:9100.
tcp::resolver resolver(*io_service);
tcp::resolver::query query("127.0.0.1", 
                           boost::lexical_cast< std::string >(9100));
tcp::resolver::iterator endpoint_iterator = resolver.resolve(query);
socket->connect(endpoint_iterator->endpoint());

// Just blocks here until a message is received.
socket->async_receive(boost::asio::buffer(buf_client, 3000), 0,
                      ClientReceiveEvent);
io_service->run();

// Write response.
boost::system::error_code ignored_error;
std::cout << "Sending message \n";
boost::asio::write(*socket, boost::asio::buffer("some data"), ignored_error);
 Any explanation of run() that describes its behavior in the two examples below would be appreciated.
@CODE:io_service::run() run() io_service run() io_service io_service run() io_service stopped() run() run_one() poll() poll_one() reset() io_service::run() io_service->run() // WorkerThread invines io_service->run()
void WorkerThread(boost::shared_ptr<boost::asio::io_service> io_service);
void CalculateFib(size_t);

    new boost::asio::io_service);

@TITLE:Node js ECONNRESET
@CONTENT:I m running an Express js application with socket.io for a chat webapp and I get the following error randomly around 5 times during 24h. The node process is wrapped in forever and it restarts itself immediatly. Problem is that restarting express kicks my users out of their rooms and nobody wants that. The web server is proxied by HAProxy. There are no socket stability issues, just using websockets and flashsockets transports. I cannot reproduce this on purpose. This is the error with node v0.10.11: events.js:72
        throw er; // Unhandled 'error' event
              ^
Error: read ECONNRESET     //alternatively it s a 'write'
    at errnoException (net.js:900:11)
    at TCP.onread (net.js:555:19)
error: Forever detected script exited with code: 8
error: Forever restarting script for 2 time
 EDIT (2013-07-22) Added both socket.io client error handler and the uncaught exception handler. Seems that this one catches the error: process.on('uncaughtException', function (err) {
  console.error(err.stack);
  console.log("Node NOT Exiting...");
});
 So I suspect it's not a socket.io issue but an http request to another server that I do or a mysql/redis connection. Problem is that the error stack doesn't help me identify my code issue. Here is the log output: Error: read ECONNRESET
    at errnoException (net.js:900:11)
    at TCP.onread (net.js:555:19)
 How do I know what causes this? How do I get more out of the error? Ok, not very verbose but here s the stacktrace with "longjohn": Exception caught: Error ECONNRESET

 Here I serve the flash socket policy file: net = require("net")
net.createServer( (socket) =>

@TITLE:AsyncTask won't stop even when the activity has destroyed
@CONTENT:I have an AsyncTask object which starts executing when the activity is created and does stuff in the background (downloads up to 100 images). Everything works fine but there is this peculiar behavior which i'm not able to understand. For eg: when the android screen's orientation changes then the activity is destroyed and created again. So I override the onRetainNonConfigurationInstance() method and save all the downloaded data executed in the AsyncTask. My purpose of doing this is to not have AsyncTask run each time activity is destroyed-created during orientation changes, but as i can see in my logs the previous AsyncTask is still executing. (The data is saved correctly though) I even tried to cancel the AsyncTask in the onDestroy() method of the activity but the logs still show AsyncTask as running. This is really strange behavior and would really be thankful if someone can tell me the correct procedure to stop/cancel the AsyncTask. Thanks

@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: Is there a JavaScript strcmp()? 6 answers I am trying to optimize a function which does binary search of strings in Javascript. Binary search requires you to know whether the key is == the pivot or < the pivot. But this requires two string comparisons in Javascript, unlike in C like languages which have the strcmp() function that returns three values (-1, 0, +1) for (less than, equal, greater than). Is there such a native function in Javascript, that can return a ternary value so that just one comparison is required in each iteration of the binary search?

@TITLE:Are static class instances unique to a request or a server in ASP.NET?
@CONTENT:On an ASP.NET website, are static classes unique to each web request, or are they instantiated whenever needed and GCed whenever the GC decides to disposed of them? The reason I ask is because I've written some static classes before in C# and the behavior is different than I would have expected. I would have expected static classes to be unique to each request, but it doesn't seem like that is the case. If they are not unique to each request, is there a way to allow them to be? UPDATE: The answer driis gave me was exactly what I needed. I was already using a singleton class, however it was using a static instance and therefore was being shared between requests even if the users were different which in this case was a bad thing. Using HttpContext.Current.Items solves my problem perfectly. For anyone who stumbles upon this question in the future, here is my implementation, simplified and shortened so that it easy to understand the pattern: using System.Collections;
using System.Web;

public class GloballyAccessibleClass
{
    private GloballyAccessibleClass() { }

    public static GloballyAccessibleClass Instance
    {
        get
        {

            if(!items.Contains("TheInstance"))
            {
                items["TheInstance"] = new GloballyAccessibleClass();

@CONTENT:I have a C++ library that provides various classes for managing data. I have the source code for the library. I want to extend the C++ API to support C function calls so that the library can be used with C code and C++ code at the same time. I'm using GNU tool chain (gcc, glibc, etc), so language and architecture support are not an issue. Are there any reasons why this is technically not possible? Are there any gotcha's that I need to watch out for? Are there resources, example code and/or documentation available regarding this? Thanks :UPDATE: Some other things that I have found out: Use the following to wrap your C++ headers that need to be used by C code. #ifdef __cplusplus extern "C" { #endif // // Code goes here ... // #ifdef __cplusplus } // extern "C" #endif Keep "real" C++ interfaces in separate header files that are not included by C. Think PIMPL principle here. Using #ifndef __cplusplus #error stuff helps here to detect any craziness. Careful of C++ identifiers as names in C code Enums varying in size between C and C++ compilers. Probably not an issue if you're using GNU tool chain, but still, be careful. For structs follow the following form so that C does not get confused. typedef struct X { ... } X Then use pointers for passing around C++ objects, they just have to be declared in C as struct X where X is the C++ object. All of this is courtesy of a friend who's a wizard at C++.

<li><%= Html.ActionLink("Spanish", "SetSpanishCulture", "Culture")%></li>
 which works fine but I am thinking there is a more appropriate way to do this. I am reading the Culture using the following ActionFilter http://www.iansuttle.com/blog/post/ASPNET-MVC-Action-Filter-for-Localized-Sites.aspx. I am a bit of an MVC noob so am not confident I am setting this in the correct place. I don't want to do it at the web.config level, it has to be based on a user's choice. I also don't want to check their http-headers to get the culture from their browser settings. Edit: Just to be clear - I am not trying to decide whether to use session or not. I am happy with that bit. What I am trying to work out is if it is best to do this in a Culture controller that has an action method for each Culture to be set, or is there is a better place in the MVC pipeline to do this?
@CODE:public class CultureController : Controller
    {
        public ActionResult SetSpanishCulture()

/usr/bin/python (for architecture i386):    Mach-O executable i386
/usr/bin/python (for architecture ppc7400): Mach-O executable ppc
 this would seem to indicate that Python has been compiled for all three architectures or something like that? I believe, based on some errors I had while trying to setup MySQL, that the version I'm using is the 64-bit version. So two questions: How would I have known that? How could I change Python to be 32-bit instead? Something less drastic than re-compile with different compile settings? Why does arch from a bash shell return i386 which would seem to indicate I'm not in "64-bit mode" when I know based on my processor I'm running a 64-bit Mac? Sorry these are probably all newbie questions, the whole 32/64-bit thing is frustrating the crap out of me and I'm sure there are some commands/tools that would make this easier.

@CONTENT:While browsing some source code I came across a function like this: void someFunction(char someArray[static 100])

 With some experimentation it appears other qualifiers may appear there too: void someFunction(char someArray[const])
{
    // do something cool here
}
 It appears that qualifiers are only allowed inside the [ ] when the array is declared as a parameter of a function. What do these do? Why is it different for function parameters?

@TITLE:Linking static libraries to other static libraries
@CONTENT:I have a small piece of code that depends on many static libraries (a_1-a_n). I'd like to package up that code in a static library and make it available to other people. My static library, lets call it X, compiles fine. I've created a simple sample program that uses a function from X, but when I try to link it to X, I get many errors about missing symbols from libraries a_1 - a_n. Is there a way that I can create a new static library, Y that contains X and all the functionality needed by X (selected bits from a_1 - a_n), so that I can distribute just Y for people to link their programs to? UPDATE: I've looked at just dumping everything with ar and making one mega-lib, however, that ends up including a lot of symbols that are not needed (all the .o files are about 700 MB, however, a statically linked executable is 7 MB). Is there a nice way to include only what is actually needed? This looks closely related to How to combine several C/C++ libraries into one?.

@TITLE:MVC, EF - DataContext singleton instance Per-Web-Request in Unity
@CONTENT:I have a MVC 3 web application, where I am using the Entity Framework for the data access. Furthermore, I have made a simple use of the repository pattern, where e.g. all Product related stuff is handled in the "ProductRepository" and all User related stuff is handled in the "UserRepository". Thus, I am using the UNITY container, to make a singleton instance of the DataContext, which I inject into each of the repositories. A quick search on Google, and everyone recommends you to NOT use a singleton instance of the DataContext, as it might give you some memory leaks in the future. So, inspired by this post, making a singleton instance of the DataContext for each web request is the answer (please correct me if I am wrong!) http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/gilf/archive/2010/05/18/how-to-manage-objectcontext-per-request-in-asp-net.aspx However, UNITY does not support the "Per-web-request" lifetime manager. But, it is possible to implement your own custom lifetime manager, which handles this for you. Actually, this is discussed in this post : Singleton Per Call Context (Web Request) in Unity The question is, I have now implemented the custom lifetime manager as described in the above post, but I am unsure if this is the way to do it. I am also wondering about where the datacontext instance is disposed in the provided solution? Am I missing out something? Is there actually a better way of solving my "issue"?

@TITLE:Lazy load images in UITableViewCell
@CONTENT:I have some 50 custom cells in my UITableView. I want to display an image and a label in the cells where I get the images from URLs. I want to do a lazy load of images so the UI does not freeze up while the images are being loaded. I tried getting the images in separate threads but I have to load each image every time a cell becomes visible again (Otherwise reuse of cells shows old images) Apps like Facebook load images only for cells currently visible and once the images are loaded, they are not loaded again. Can someone please tell me how to duplicate this behavior. Thanks. Edit Trying to cache images in an NSMutableDictionary object creates problems when the user scrolls fast. I am getting images only when scrolling completely stops and clearing out the cache on memory warning. But the app invariably gets a memory warning (due to size of images being cached) and clears the cache before reloading. If scrolling is very fast, it crashes. Any other suggestions are welcome

@TITLE:iPhone:Programmatically compressing recorded video to share?
@CONTENT:I have implemented an overlay view when calling camera view before recording the video. pickerController.cameraOverlayView =myOverlay;
 Video recording and saving the video into Album after recording the video and sharing via email etc. all works fine. If i use video quality as "High quality", then the recorded video has become huge size.

@TITLE:Smooth scrolling in Android
@CONTENT:There is an app in the market place called Floating images. This app has one of the smoothest scrolling logic. Basically the app has a blank canvas covering whole screen and then there are some images displayed on top of the blank canvas. User can swipe and the app moves the image in the direction of swipe. Plus it does kinetic scrolling too. Plus there are no scrollbars so it seems like the developer has created a custom view implementing all smooth scrolling logic. it would be awesome if i could get the source of it.. but anyone has any pseudo code or logic on how to implement this kind of feature. Any leads , site links would be helpful.

Should they always be used (or are there cases where using them is not preferred and/or incurs a performance penalty)? In searching around this site on common methods for namespacing in js it seems that most use a non-prototype based implementation: simply using an object, or a function object to encapsulate a namespace. Coming from a class-based language its hard not to try and draw parallels and think that prototypes are like "classes" and the namespace implementations I mentioned are like static methods. Any clarification would be great.

@LINK:/questions/4739748/is-there-a-way-to-make-drawrect-work-right-now
@TITLE:Is there a way to make drawRect work right NOW?
@CONTENT:The original question............................................... If you are an advanced user of drawRect, you will know that of course drawRect will not actually run until "all processing is finished." setNeedsDisplay flags a view as invalidated and the OS, and basically waits until all processing is done. This can be infuriating in the common situation where you want to have: a view controller 1 starts some function 2 which incrementally 3 creates a more and more complicated artwork and 4 at each step, you setNeedsDisplay (wrong!) 5 until all the work is done 6 Of course, when you do the above 1-6, all that happens is that drawRect is run once only after step 6. Your goal is for the view to be refreshed at point 5. What to do? Solution to the original question.............................................. In a word, you can (A) background the large painting, and call to the foreground for UI updates or (B) arguably controversially there are four 'immediate' methods suggested that do not use a background process. For the result of what works, run the demo program. It has #defines for all five methods. Truly astounding alternate solution introduced by Tom Swift.................. Tom Swift has explained the amazing idea of quite simply manipulating the run loop. Here's how you trigger the run loop: [[NSRunLoop currentRunLoop] runMode: NSDefaultRunLoopMode beforeDate: [NSDate date]]; This is a truly amazing piece of engineering. Of course one should be extremely careful when manipulating the run loop and as many pointed out this approach is strictly for experts. The Bizarre Problem That Arises.............................................. Even though a number of the methods work, they don't actually "work" because there is a bizarre progressive-slow-down artifact you will see clearly in the demo. Scroll to the 'answer' I pasted in below, showing the console output - you can see how it progressively slows. Here's the new SO question: Mysterious "progressive slowing" problem in run loop / drawRect Here is V2 of the demo app... http://www.fileswap.com/dl/p8lU3gAi/stepwiseDrawingV2.zip.html You will see it tests all five methods, #ifdef TOMSWIFTMETHOD
 [self setNeedsDisplay];
 [[NSRunLoop currentRunLoop]
      runMode:NSDefaultRunLoopMode beforeDate:[NSDate date]];
#endif
#ifdef HOTPAW
 [self setNeedsDisplay];

 [[self layer] displayIfNeeded];
#endif
#ifdef BACKGROUNDMETHOD
 // here, the painting is being done in the bg, we have been
 // called here in the foreground to inval
 [self setNeedsDisplay];
#endif
 You can see for yourself which methods work and which do not. you can see the bizarre "progressive-slow-down". why does it happen? you can see with the controversial TOMSWIFT method, there is actually no problem at all with responsiveness. tap for response at any time. (but still the bizarre "progressive-slow-down" problem) So the overwhelming thing is this weird "progressive-slow-down": on each iteration, for unknown reasons, the time taken for a loop deceases. Note that this applies to both doing it "properly" (background look) or using one of the 'immediate' methods. Practical solutions ........................ For anyone reading in the future, if you are actually unable to get this to work in production code because of the "mystery progressive slowdown" ... Felz and Void have each presented astounding solutions in the other specific question, hope it helps.

@TITLE:How should I store UIImages within my Core Data database?
@CONTENT:I am developing an application which demands around 100 images or maybe more to be pre-inserted into the Core Data database along with other related information. Now I can easily add other data by just writing a few lines of code but for UIImages I am unsure how to do it without writing a lot of code. I was wondering: is there anyway to do this easily, or if there isn't what's the best way to achieve this with the least amount of effort. Also, is it okay to store images in a Core Data database or should we only only save the addresses of images on the local file system?

@TITLE:while (1) Vs. for (;;) Is there a speed difference?
@CONTENT:Long version... A co-worker asserted today after seeing my use of while (1) in a Perl script that for (;;) is faster. I argued that they should be the same hoping that the interpreter would optimize out any differences. I set up a script that would run 1,000,000,000 for loop iterations and the same number of while loops and record the time between. I could find no appreciable difference. My co-worker said that a professor had told him that the while (1) was doing a comparison 1 == 1 and the for (;;) was not. We repeated the same test with the 100x the number of iterations with C++ and the difference was negligible. It was however a graphic example of how much faster compiled code can be vs. a scripting language. Short version... Is there any reason to prefer a while (1) over a for (;;) if you need an infinite loop to break out of? Note: If it's not clear from the question. This was purely a fun academic discussion between a couple of friends. I am aware this is not a super important concept that all programmers should agonize over. Thanks for all the great answers I (and I'm sure others) have learned a few things from this discussion. Update: The aforementioned co-worker weighed in with a response below. Quoted here in case it gets buried. It came from an AMD assembly programmer. He stated that C programmers (the poeple) don't realize that their code has inefficiencies. He said today though, gcc compilers are very good, and put people like him out of business. He said for example, and told me about the while 1 vs for(;;). I use it now out of habit but gcc and especially interpreters will do the same operation (a processor jump) for both these days, since they are optimized.

@LINK:/questions/15705092/do-httpclient-and-httpclienthandler-have-to-be-disposed
@TITLE:Do HttpClient and HttpClientHandler have to be disposed?
@CONTENT:System.Net.Http.HttpClient and System.Net.Http.HttpClientHandler in .NET Framework 4.5 implement IDisposable (via System.Net.Http.HttpMessageInvoker). The using statement documentation says: As a rule, when you use an IDisposable object, you should declare and instantiate it in a using statement. This answer uses this pattern: var baseAddress = new Uri("http://example.com");
var cookieContainer = new CookieContainer();
using (var handler = new HttpClientHandler() { CookieContainer = cookieContainer })
using (var client = new HttpClient(handler) { BaseAddress = baseAddress })
{
    var content = new FormUrlEncodedContent(new[]
    {
        new KeyValuePair<string, string>("foo", "bar"),
        new KeyValuePair<string, string>("baz", "bazinga"),
    });
    cookieContainer.Add(baseAddress, new Cookie("CookieName", "cookie_value"));
    var result = client.PostAsync("/test", content).Result;
    result.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
}
 But the most visible examples from Microsoft don't call Dispose() either explicitly or implicitly. For instance: The original blog article announcing the relase of HttpClient. The actual MSDN documentation for HttpClient. BingTranslateSample GoogleMapsSample WorldBankSample In the announcement's comments, someone asked the Microsoft employee: After checking your samples, I saw that you didn't perform the dispose action on HttpClient instance. I have used all instances of HttpClient with using statement on my app and I thought that it is the right way since HttpClient implements the IDisposable interface. Am I on the right path? His answer was: In general that is correct although you have to be careful with "using" and async as they dont' really mix in .Net 4, In .Net 4.5 you can use "await" inside a "using" statement. Btw, you can reuse the same HttpClient as many times are [as] you like so typically you won't create/dispose them all the time. The second paragraph is superflous to this question, which is not concerned about how many times you can use an HttpClient instance, but if it necessary to dispose it after you no longer need it. (Update: in fact that second paragraph is the key to the answer, as provided below by @DPeden.) So my questions are: Is it necessary, given the current implementation (.NET Framework 4.5), to call Dispose() on HttpClient and HttpClientHandler instances? Clarification: by "necessary" I mean if there are any negative consequences for not disposing, such as resource leakage or data corruption risks. If it's not necessary, would it be a "good practice" anyway, since they implement IDisposable? If it's necessary (or recommended), is this code mentioned above implementing it safely (for .NET Framework 4.5)? If these classes don't require calling Dispose(), why were they implemented as IDisposable? If they require, or if it's a recommended practice, are the Microsoft examples misleading or unsafe?
@CODE:using var baseAddress = new Uri("http://example.com");
var cookieContainer = new CookieContainer();
using (var handler = new HttpClientHandler() { CookieContainer = cookieContainer })
using (var client = new HttpClient(handler) { BaseAddress = baseAddress })
{
    var content = new FormUrlEncodedContent(new[]
    {
        new KeyValuePair<string, string>("foo", "bar"),
        new KeyValuePair<string, string>("baz", "bazinga"),
    });
    cookieContainer.Add(baseAddress, new Cookie("CookieName", "cookie_value"));
    var result = client.PostAsync("/test", content).Result;
    result.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
} Dispose() Flush

</Toolbar>
 As you can see I've set all the relevant padding to 0, but there is still padding around the Spinner. What have I done wrong or what do I need to do to get rid of the extra padding? Edit Some have questioned why I am trying to do this. As per the Material Design specs, the spinner should be 72dp from the left side I need to neutralize the padding Google have put there in order to properly place my spinner: Edit 2 As per Chris Bane's answer below I set the contentInsetStart to 0. For the support library you will need to use the app namespace: <android.support.v4.widget.DrawerLayout
    xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"

@TITLE:jQuery: Why use document.ready if external JS at bottom of page?
@CONTENT:I am including all of my JS as external files that are loaded at the very bottom of the page. Within these files, I have several methods defined like so, which I call from the ready event: var SomeNamepsace = {};

SomeNamepsace.firstMethod = function () {
    // do something
};

SomeNamepsace.secondMethod = function () {
    // do something else
};

$(document).ready(function () {
    SomeNamepsace.firstMethod();
    SomeNamepsace.secondMethod();
});
 However, when I remove the ready function and call the methods straight-up, everything works just the same, but executes significantly faster¡Xalmost a whole second faster on a pretty basic file! Since the document should be loaded at this point (as all the markup comes before the script tags), is there any good reason to still be using the ready event?

SomeNamepsace.firstMethod = function () {
    // do something

SomeNamepsace.secondMethod = function () {

 Do you not need to close the conn Connection? What is really happening if the conn.close() doesn't occur? I have a private web app I'm maintaining that doesn't currently close either form, but is the important one really the stmt one, the conn one, or both? The site keeps going down intermittently but the server keeps saying it's a database connection issue, my suspicion is that it's not being closed, but I don't know which if any to close.

@TITLE:Use camera flashlight in Android
@CONTENT:I'm trying to use the cameras LED flashlight in a widget. I've found several threads about this topic (i.e. the one mentioned later..) , now I'm trying to control the light using: Camera cam = Camera.open();     
Parameters p = cam.getParameters();
p.setFlashMode(Parameters.FLASH_MODE_TORCH);
cam.setParameters(p);
cam.release();
 In the AndroidManifest.xml tried different permissions, currently I have: <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FLASHLIGHT"/>
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera" />
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera.autofocus" />
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera.flash" />
 I'm testing this on my Galaxy Tab as I don't have any other Android devices at hand: the light does not turn on. So I have a few questions now: Is there any way to test the led light behavior in the Emulator? Am I doing something wrong here? According to this question which deals with the same problem, it works differently on the Galaxy Tab. How? And finally, if it does work differently, I'm starting to wonder if it's just the Galaxy Tab or if other devices use different methods too. It would be hard to test then and it seems rather odd to me. Thanks for any insight! By the way, I quickly tested with quick-settings which gets mentioned a few times here. The flashlight doesn't work with quick-settings either. Note that the Galaxy Tab stil uses android 2.2. I see there were some changes between 2.2 and 2.3. Comment: I know it has to work somehow as I have found other apps in the market that work perfectly with the Galaxy Tab. Comment 2: If I set cam.setParameters(p); and directly ask the camera for the current state with getFlashMode() it correctly returns FLASH_MODE_TORCH. However, if I release the camera and re-open it, it returns FLASH_MODE_OFF. It's almost as if the Camera object aknowledges the request but doesn't really pass it on to the hardware!? -- After Konstantins comment, I removed the cam.release(); part. He is right, the settings are not persisted if you release the camera. If you use cam.open() again, you will get a fresh instance with the light off. The light's still not working on the galaxy tab though. So, I guess it's hard to keep the light on if you're trying to control it through a widget then. As soon as the background service is finished, the camera object is released automatically and therefore the light switches off again. My questions still remain, especially why the camera doesn't switch on in the first place.
@CODE:Camera cam = Camera.open();     
Parameters p = cam.getParameters();
p.setFlashMode(Parameters.FLASH_MODE_TORCH);
cam.setParameters(p);

@TITLE:Facebook Graph API - upload photo using JavaScript
@CONTENT:Is it possible to upload a file using the Facebook Graph API using javascript, I feel like I'm close. I'm using the following JavaScript var params = {};
params['message'] = 'PicRolled';
params['source'] = '@'+path;
params['access_token'] = access_token;
params['upload file'] = true;

function saveImage() {
    FB.api('/me/photos', 'post', params, function(response) {

        } else {
            alert('Published to stream - you might want to delete it now!');
        }
    }); 
}
 Upon running this I receive the following error... "OAuthException" - "(#324) Requires upload file"
 When I try and research this method all I can find out about is a php method that apears to solve this $facebook->setFileUploadSupport(true);
 However, I am using JavaScript, it looks like this method might be to do with Facebook Graph permissions, but I already have set the permissions user_photos and publish_stream, which I believed are the only ones I should need to perform this operation. I have seen a couple of unanswered questions regarding this on stackoverflow, hopefully I can explained myself enough. Thanks guys.

@CONTENT:I have a requirement to center a custom logo (using an ImageView) in the Actionbar for the "Home" activity. I'm using ABS for this project. This is very similar to a another question posted on S.O. (ActionBar logo centered and Action Items on sides), but I'm not sure if the ImageView or search menu makes a difference, as I'm not getting the results I'm looking for (a centered image), or if I've just got it wrong. Basically, I set an Icon on the left, insert the custom view in the center, and have a search icon on the right (OptionsMenu).

@TITLE:C# Test if user has write access to a folder
@CONTENT:I need to test if a user can write to a folder before actually attempting to do so. I've implemented the following method (in C# 2.0) that attempts to retrieve the security permissions for the folder using Directory.GetAccessControl() method. private bool hasWriteAccessToFolder(string folderPath)
{
    try
    {
        // Attempt to get a list of security permissions from the folder. 
        // This will raise an exception if the path is read only or do not have access to view the permissions.

}

@CONTENT:I have created my own CA certificate and now I want to install it on my Android Froyo device (HTC Desire Z), so that the device trusts my certificate. Android stores CA certificates in its Java keystore in /system/etc/security/cacerts.bks. I copied the file to my computer, added my certificate using portecle 1.5 and pushed it back to the device. Now, Android does not seem to reload the file automatically. I have read in several blog posts that I need to restart the device. Doing so results in the file being overwritten with the original one again. My next try was to install the certificate from SD card by copying it and using the according option from the settings menu. The device tells me that the certificate has been installed, but apparently it does not trust the certificate. Moreover, when I try to copy the keystore to my computer, I still find the original stock cacerts.bks. So, what is the right way to install my own root CA certificate on an Android 2.2 device as a trusted certificate? Is there a way to do it programmatically?

@CONTENT:Say we usually access via http://localhost/index.php?a=1&b=2&c=3
 How do we execute the same in linux command prompt? php -e index.php
 But what about passing the $_GET variables? Maybe something like php -e index.php --a 1 --b 2 --c 3? Doubt that'll work. Thank you!

@CONTENT:I noticed that in iOS 7, UITableViewCells have a line break in the separator of the cell that iOS 6 does not have. Is there a way to get rid of this line break? Changing the separator to none and then making UIViews with the color of the separator still causes the white separator to occur regardless.

@TITLE:Ideal HTTP cache control headers for different types of resources
@CONTENT:I want to find a minimal set of headers, that work with "all" caches and browsers (also when using HTTPS!) On my web site, I'll have three kinds of resources: (1) Forever cacheable (public / equal for all users) Example: 0A470E87CC58EE133616F402B5DDFE1C.cache.html (auto generated by GWT) These files are automatically assigned a new name, when they change content (based on the MD5). They should get cached as much as possible, even when using HTTPS (so I assume, I should set Cache-Control: public, especially for Firefox?) They shouldn't require the client to make a round-trip to the server to validate, if the content has changed. (2) Changing occasionally (public / equal for all users) Examples: index.html, mymodule.nocache.js These files change their content without changing the URL, when a new version of the site is deployed. They can be cached, but probably need a round-trip to be revalidated every time. (3) Individual for each request (private / user specific) Example: JSON responses These resources should never be cached unencrypted to disk under no circumstances. (Except maybe I'll have a few specific requests that could be cached.) I have a general idea on which headers I would probably use for each type, but there's always something I could be missing.

@LINK:/questions/322929/word-wrap-in-css-js
@TITLE:word wrap in css / js
@CONTENT:I'm looking for a cross-browser way of wrapping long portions of text that have no breaking spaces (e.g. long URLs) inside of divs with pre-determined widths. Here are some solutions I've found around the web and why they don't work for me: overflow : hidden / auto / scroll - I need the entire text to be visible without scrolling. The div can grow vertically, but not horizontally. Injecting &shy; into the string via js / server-side - &shy; is supported by FF3 now, but copying and pasting a URL with a &shy; in the middle will not work in Safari. Also, to my knowledge, there isn't a clean method of measuring text width to find out the best string offsets to add these characters to (there's one hacky way, see next item). Another problem is that zooming in Firefox and Opera can easily break this. dumping text into a hidden element and measuring offsetWidth - related to the item above, it requires adding extra characters into the string. Also, measuring the amount of breaks required in a long body of text could easily require thousands of expensive DOM insertions (one for every substring length), which could effectively freeze the site. using a monospace font - again, zooming can mess up width calculations, and the text can't be styled freely. Things that look promising but are not quite there: word-wrap : break-word - it's now part of CSS3 working draft, but it's not supported by either Firefox, Opera or Safari yet. This would be the ideal solution if it worked across all browsers today :( injecting <wbr> tags into the string via js/ server-side - copying and pasting URLs works in all browsers, but I still don't have a good way of measuring where to put the breaks. Also, this tag invalidates HTML. adding breaks after every character - it's better than thousands of DOM insertions, but still not ideal (adding DOM elements to a document eats memory and slows downs selector queries, among other things). Does anyone have more ideas on how to tackle this problem?

}

 My aim is to effectively load entire Project. Problem of course is: If I try to eager load partners and their costs, query returns gazillion rows If I lazy load Partner.Costs, db gets request spammed (which is a bit faster than first approach) As I read, common workaround is to use MultiQueries, but I kind a just don't get it. So I'm hoping to learn through this exact example. How to effectively load whole Project? P.s. I'm using NHibernate 3.0.0. Please, do not post answers with hql or string fashioned criteria api approaches.

@TITLE:Get records with highest/smallest <whatever> per group
@CONTENT:How to do that? Former title of this question was "using rank (@Rank := @Rank + 1) in complex query with subqueries - will it work?" because I was looking for solution using ranks, but now I see that the solution posted by Bill is much much better. Original question: I'm trying to compose a query that would take last record from each group given some defined order: SET @Rank=0;

select s.*
from (select GroupId, max(Rank) AS MaxRank
      from (select GroupId, @Rank := @Rank + 1 AS Rank 
            from Table
            order by OrderField
            ) as t
      group by GroupId) as t 
  join (
      select *, @Rank := @Rank + 1 AS Rank
      from Table
      order by OrderField
      ) as s 
  on t.GroupId = s.GroupId and t.MaxRank = s.Rank
order by OrderField
 Expression @Rank := @Rank + 1 is normally used for rank, but for me it looks suspicious when used in 2 subqueries, but initialized only once. Will it work this way? And second, will it work with one subquery that is evaluated multiple times? Like subquery in where (or having) clause (another way how to write the above): SET @Rank=0;

select Table.*, @Rank := @Rank + 1 AS Rank
from Table
having Rank = (select max(Rank) AS MaxRank
              from (select GroupId, @Rank := @Rank + 1 AS Rank 
                    from Table as t0
                    order by OrderField
                    ) as t
              where t.GroupId = table.GroupId
             )
order by OrderField
 Thanks in advance!

@TITLE:Get notified when UITableView has finished asking for data?
@CONTENT:Is there some way to find out when a UITableView has finished asking for data from its data source? None of the viewDidLoad/viewWillAppear/viewDidAppear methods of the associated view controller (UITableViewController) are of use?here, as they all fire too early. None of them (entirely understandably) guarantee that queries to the data source have finished for the time being (eg, until the view is scrolled). One workaround I have found is to call reloadData in viewDidAppear, since, when reloadData returns, the table view is guaranteed to have finished querying the data source as much as it needs to for the time being. However, this seems rather nasty, as I assume it is causing the data source to be asked for the same information twice (once automatically, and once because of the reloadData call) when it is first loaded. The reason I want to do this at all is that I want to preserve the scroll position of the UITableView - but right down to the pixel level, not just to the nearest row. When restoring the scroll position (using scrollRectToVisible:animated:), I need the table view to already have sufficient data in it, or else the scrollRectToVisible:animated: method call does nothing (which is what happens if you place the call on its own in any of viewDidLoad, viewWillAppear or viewDidAppear). Thanks in advance for your assistance!

@TITLE:Android Studio - Importing external Library/Jar
@CONTENT:I recently downloaded Android Studio to develop Android applications (I'm coming from Eclipse), and I am having issues using external libraries and/or external JAR files alongside my own project. NOTE: the following tests were conducted on a new application project created from scratch in Android Studio. Example 1: JAR Import. Download a fresh copy of the Admobs SDK from Google. Copy the library jar GoogleAdMobAdsSdk-6.4.1.jar to the project's /libs/ folder. In the project explorer, right click on the newly added library.jar and click on 'Add as Library'. Technically at this point everything works, imports work just fine, the layout editor shows a preview of the AdView widget, and all that. The only problem is that it doesn't compile succesfully. Log from console: Gradle: 
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':APITests:compilePaidDebug'.
> Compilation failed; see the compiler error output for details.

* Try:
Run with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace. Run with --info or --debug option to get more log output.

Could not execute build using Gradle distribution 'http://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-1.6-bin.zip'.
 I tried running gradlew compileDebug --stacktrace, and the problem seems to be that the despite being able to import the classes sucesfully in both the code & design editor, at compile time, it cannot resolve the imports. Here's the relevant part of the log: (full stacktrace here) java:6: error: package com.google.ads does not exist
import com.google.ads.AdRequest;    
java:7: error: package com.google.ads does not exist

location: class MainActivity
java:23: error: cannot find symbol
mAdView.loadAd(new AdRequest());
symbol:   class AdRequest
location: class MainActivity
5 errors
:Test:compileDebug FAILED
 But again, the imports work well in the editor, and the dependency is there: It's also worth noting that without attempting to add a library/JAR, the projects compiles just fine. I then tried editing the build.gradle file to include the new lib like this: dependencies {
compile files('libs/android-support-v4.jar', 'libs/GoogleAdMobAdsSdk-6.4.1.jar')
}
 This time, it did compile succesfully, but the app now force closes, as apparently it cannot find a specific class from the lib in the application package. Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: Didn't find class "com.google.ads.AdView" on path: /data/app/com.foo.test-1.apk
 Any ideas? Thanks!

@TITLE:Is it possible to bind a Canvas's Children property in XAML?
@CONTENT:I'm a little surprised that it is not possible to set up a binding for Canvas.Children through XAML. I've had to resort to a code-behind approach that looks something like this: private void UserControl_Loaded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    DesignerViewModel dvm = this.DataContext as DesignerViewModel;
    dvm.Document.Items.CollectionChanged += new System.Collections.Specialized.NotifyCollectionChangedEventHandler(Items_CollectionChanged);

    foreach (UIElement element in dvm.Document.Items)
        designerCanvas.Children.Add(element);
}

private void Items_CollectionChanged(object sender, NotifyCollectionChangedEventArgs e)
{
    ObservableCollection<UIElement> collection = sender as ObservableCollection<UIElement>;

    foreach (UIElement element in collection)
        if (!designerCanvas.Children.Contains(element))
            designerCanvas.Children.Add(element);

    List<UIElement> removeList = new List<UIElement>();
    foreach (UIElement element in designerCanvas.Children)
        if (!collection.Contains(element))
            removeList.Add(element);

    foreach (UIElement element in removeList)
        designerCanvas.Children.Remove(element);
}
 I'd much rather just set up a binding in XAML like this: <Canvas x:Name="designerCanvas"
        Children="{Binding Document.Items}"
        Width="{Binding Document.Width}"
        Height="{Binding Document.Height}">
</Canvas>
 Is there a way to accomplish this without resorting to a code-behind approach? I've done some googling on the subject, but haven't come up with much for this specific problem. I don't like my current approach because it mucks up my nice Model-View-ViewModel by making the View aware of it's ViewModel.
@CODE:private void UserControl_Loaded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    DesignerViewModel dvm = this.DataContext as DesignerViewModel;
    dvm.Document.Items.CollectionChanged += new System.Collections.Specialized.NotifyCollectionChangedEventHandler(Items_CollectionChanged);

        designerCanvas.Children.Add(element);

@LINK:/questions/13703596/mediacodec-and-camera-colorspaces-dont-match
@TITLE:MediaCodec and Camera: colorspaces don't match
@CONTENT:I have been trying to get H264 encoding to work with input captured by the camera on an Android tablet using the new low-level MediaCodec. I have gone through some difficulties with this, since the MediaCodecAPI is poorly documented, but I've gotten something to work at last. I'm setting up the camera as follows:         Camera.Parameters parameters = mCamera.getParameters();
        parameters.setPreviewFormat(ImageFormat.YV12); // <1>
        parameters.setPreviewFpsRange(4000,60000);
        parameters.setPreviewSize(640, 480);            
        mCamera.setParameters(parameters);
 For the encoding part, I'm instantiating the MediaCodec object as follows:     mediaCodec = MediaCodec.createEncoderByType("video/avc");
    MediaFormat mediaFormat = MediaFormat.createVideoFormat("video/avc", 640, 480);
    mediaFormat.setInteger(MediaFormat.KEY_BIT_RATE, 500000);
    mediaFormat.setInteger(MediaFormat.KEY_FRAME_RATE, 15);
    mediaFormat.setInteger(MediaFormat.KEY_COLOR_FORMAT,
            MediaCodecInfo.CodecCapabilities.COLOR_FormatYUV420Planar); // <2>
    mediaFormat.setInteger(MediaFormat.KEY_I_FRAME_INTERVAL, 5);
    mediaCodec.configure(mediaFormat, null, null, MediaCodec.CONFIGURE_FLAG_ENCODE);
    mediaCodec.start();
 The final goal is to create an RTP-stream (and correspond with Skype), but so far I am only streaming the raw H264 directly to my desktop. There I use the following GStreamer-pipeline to show the result: gst-launch udpsrc port=5555 ! video/x-h264,width=640,height=480,framerate=15/1 ! ffdec_h264 ! autovideosink
 All works well, except for the colors. I need to set 2 colorformats in the computer: one for the camera-preview (line tagged with <1>) and one for the MediaCodec-object (tagged with <2>) To determine the acceptable values for the lines <1> I used parameters.getSupportedPreviewFormats(). From this, I know that the only supported formats on the camera are ImageFormat.NV21 and ImageFormat.YV2. For <2>, I retrieved the MediaCodecInfo.CodecCapabilities-object for type video/avc, being the integer values 19 (corresponding with MediaCodecInfo.CodecCapabilities.COLOR_FormatYUV420Planar and 2130708361 (which doesn't correspond with any value of MediaCodecInfo.CodecCapabilities). Any other value than the above results in a crash. Combining these settings gives different results, which I'll show below. Here's the screenshot on Android (i.e. the "real" colors): Here are the results as shown by Gstreamer: <1> = NV21, <2> = COLOR_FormatYUV420Planar <1> = NV21, <2> = 2130708361 <1> = YV2, <2> = COLOR_FormatYUV420Planar <1> = YV2, <2> = 2130708361 As can be seen, none of these are satisfying. The YV2-colorspace looks the most promising, but it looks like red (Cr) and blue (Cb) are inverted. The NV21 looks interlaced I guess (however, I'm no expert in this field). Since the purpose is to communicate with Skype, I assume I shouldn't change the decoder (i.e. the Gstreamer-command), right? Is this to be solved in Android and if so: how? Or can this be solved by adding certain RTP payload information? Any other suggestion?

@CONTENT:I have made a small demo site and on it I am storing images within a image column on the sql server. A few questions I have are... Is this a bad idea? Will it affect performance on my site when it grows? The alternative would be to store the image on disc and only store the reference to the image in the database. This must be a common dilemma many people have had. I'd welcome some advice and would actually be happy to make a mistake less if I could.

@TITLE:How do I break down an NSTimeInterval into year, months, days, hours, minutes and seconds on iPhone?
@CONTENT:I have a time interval that spans years and I want all the time components from year down to seconds. My first thought is to integer divide the time interval by seconds in a year, subtract that from a running total of seconds, divide that by seconds in a month, subtract that from the running total and so on. That just seems convoluted and I've read that whenever you are doing something that looks convoluted, there is probably a built-in method. Is there? I integrated Alex's 2nd method into my code. It's in a method called by a UIDatePicker in my interface. NSDate *now = [NSDate date];
NSDate *then = self.datePicker.date;
NSTimeInterval howLong = [now timeIntervalSinceDate:then];

NSDate *date = [NSDate dateWithTimeIntervalSince1970:howLong];
NSString *dateStr = [date description];
const char *dateStrPtr = [dateStr UTF8String];
int year, month, day, hour, minute, sec;

sscanf(dateStrPtr, "%d-%d-%d %d:%d:%d", &year, &month, &day, &hour, &minute, &sec);
year -= 1970;

NSLog(@"%d years\n%d months\n%d days\n%d hours\n%d minutes\n%d seconds", year, month, day, hour, minute, sec);
 When I set the date picker to a date 1 year and 1 day in the past, I get: 1 years 1 months 1 days 16 hours 0 minutes 20 seconds which is 1 month and 16 hours off. If I set the date picker to 1 day in the past, I am off by the same amount. Update: I have an app that calculates your age in years, given your birthday (set from a UIDatePicker), yet it was often off. This proves there was an inaccuracy, but I can't figure out where it comes from, can you?
@CODE:NSDate *now = [NSDate date];
NSDate *then = self.datePicker.date;
NSTimeInterval howLong = [now timeIntervalSinceDate:then];

@TITLE:How do I compare two DateTime objects in PHP 5.2.8?
@CONTENT:This seems like something that should be pretty straight forward, but I have been stuck page faulting this problem for a while now, so here goes. Having a look on the PHP documentation , the following two methods of the DateTime object would both seem to solve my problem: DateTime::diff : Get the difference and use that to determine which is more ancient. DateTime::getTimestamp : Get the UNIX timestampt and compare those. Both these methods are marked in the doco as being available in version >= 5.3 (and, not surprisingly, if I try to call them I find they don't exist). I can't find any specific documentation for 5.2.8 so I am not sure if there are equivalent methods in my version. I have Googled the problem and found an eclectic range of solutions, none of which answer my very simple requirements: How do I compare two DateTime objects? Where can I find the doco for previous PHP versions? Specifically version 5.2.8? For some context, I have the following code: $st_dt = new DateTime(verifyParam ('start_date'));
$end_dt = new DateTime(verifyParam ('end_date'));

// is the end date more ancient than the start date?
if ($end_dt < $start_dt) 
 Apparently there is no comparison operator on this guy. EDIT: Apparently my assumptions were completely false (thanks Milen for illustrating this so effectively). There is a comparison operator and it works just fine thanks. Sometimes I really miss a compiler. The bug is in the code above, I am sure you will find it much faster than I did :). I look forward to my embarrassment at the simplicity of your solution. EDIT: And sure enough, embarrassment ensues ...
@CODE:$st_dt = new DateTime(verifyParam ('start_date'));
$end_dt = new DateTime(verifyParam ('end_date'));

@TITLE:Should I use an exception specifier in C++?
@CONTENT:In C++, you can specify that a function may or may not throw an exception by using an exception specifier. For example: void foo() throw(); // guaranteed not to throw an exception
void bar() throw(int); // may throw an exception of type int
void baz() throw(...); // may throw an exception of some unspecified type
 I'm doubtful about actually using them because of the following: The compiler doesn't really enforce exception specifiers in any rigorous way, so the benefits are not great. Ideally, you would like to get a compile error. If a function violates an exception specifier, I think the standard behaviour is to terminate the program. In VS.Net, it treats throw(X) as throw(...), so adherence to the standard is not strong. Do you think exception specifiers should be used? Please answer with "yes" or "no" and provide some reasons to justify your answer.

@TITLE:What is the point of the class Option[T]?
@CONTENT:I am not able to understand the point of Option[T] class in Scala. I mean, I am not able to see any advanages of None over null. For example, consider the code: object Main{
  class Person(name: String, var age: int){
    def display = println(name+" "+age)
  }

  def getPerson1: Person = {
    // returns a Person instance or null
  }

  def getPerson2: Option[Person] = {
    // returns either Some[Person] or None
  }

  def main(argv: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val p = getPerson1
    if (p!=null) p.display

    getPerson2 match{
      case Some(person) => person.display
      case None => /* Do nothing */
    }
  }
}
 Now suppose, the method getPerson1 returns null, then the call made to display on first line of main is bound to fail with NPE. Similarly if getPerson2 returns None, the display call will again fail with some similar error. If so, then why does Scala complicate things by introducing a new value wrapper (Option[T]) instead of following a simple approach used in Java? UPDATE: I have edited my code as per @Mitch's suggestion. I am still not able to see any particular advantage of Option[T]. I have to test for the exceptional null or None in both cases. :( If I have understood correctly from @Michael's reply, is the only advantage of Option[T] is that it explicitly tells the programmer that this method could return None? Is this the only reason behind this design choice?
@CODE:Option[T] None null object Main{
  class Person(name: String, var age: int){
    def display = println(name+" "+age)

@CONTENT:I want to create a Rails (2.1 and 2.2) model with ActiveRecord validations, but without a database table. What is the most widely used approach? I've found some plugins that claim to offer this functionality, but many of them don't appear to be widely used or maintained. What does the community recommend I do? Right now I am leaning toward coming up with my own solution based on this blog post.

@TITLE:Why does XSLT output all text by default?
@CONTENT:Hi I had performed a transformation which drops a tag if it is null. I wanted to check whether my transformation is working fine, so instead of checking it manually, I wrote one more XSLT code which just checks the presence of that particular tag in the OUTPUT XML, if it is null, then the second XSLT should output a text "FOUND". (I don't actually need some XML kind of output but I am just using XSLT for searching.) When I tried with this XSL code :: <xsl:stylesheet version="1.0" xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform">
  <xsl:template match="/SiebelMessage//SuppressCalendar[.!='']">
      FOUND
  </xsl:template>
</xsl:stylesheet>
 It outputs all the TEXT DATA that is present in the XML file, to avoid that, I had to write this code:: <xsl:stylesheet version="1.0" xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform">
  <xsl:template match="/SiebelMessage//SuppressCalendar[.!='']">
      FOUND
  </xsl:template>
  <xsl:template match="text()"/>
</xsl:stylesheet>
 why did the former code outputs TEXT, why should I insist XSL to ignore all other text? is that the behavior of all XML parsers or only of my own (I am using msxml parser).
@CODE:<xsl:stylesheet version="1.0" xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform">

 funA funB and funC will bring up another Toplevel windows with widgets when user click on button 1, 2, 3. I am wondering if this is the right way to write a python tkinter program? Sure, it will work even if I write this way, but is it the best way? It sounds stupid but when I see the codes other people written, their code is not messed up with bunch of functions and mostly they have classes. Is there any specific structure that we should follow as good practice? How should I plan before start writing a python program? I know there is no such thing as best practice in programming and I am not asking for it either. I just want some advice and explanations to keep me on the right direction as I am learning Python by myself.

@CONTENT:I have to code an object detector (in this case, a ball) using OpenCV. The problem is, every single search on google returns me something with FACE DETECTION in it. So i need help on where to start, what to use etc.. Some info: The ball doesn't have a fixed color, it will probably be white, but it might change. I HAVE to use machine learning, doesn't have to be a complex and reliable one, suggestion is KNN (which is WAY simpler and easier). After all my searching, i found that calculating the histogram of samples ball-only images and teaching it to the ML could be useful, but my main concern here is that the ball size can and will change (closer and further from the camera) and i have no idea on what to pass to the ML to classify for me, i mean.. i can't (or can I?) just test every pixel of the image for every possible size (from, lets say, 5x5 to WxH) and hope to find a positive result. There might be a non-uniform background, like people, cloth behind the ball and etc.. As I said, i have to use a ML algorithm, that means no Haar or Viola algorithms. Also, I thought on using contours to find circles on a Canny'ed image, just have to find a way to transform a contour into a row of data to teach the KNN. So... suggestions? Thanks in advance. ;)

@TITLE:How can I match multiple occurrences with a regex in JavaScript similar to PHP's preg_match_all()?
@CONTENT:I am trying to parse url-encoded strings that are made up of key=value pairs separated by either & or &amp;. The following will only match the first occurrence, breaking apart the keys and values into separate result elements: var result = mystring.match(/(?:&|&amp;)?([^=]+)=([^&]+)/)
 The results for the string '1111342=Adam%20Franco&348572=Bob%20Jones' would be: ['1111342', 'Adam%20Franco']
 Using the global flag, 'g', will match all occurrences, but only return the fully matched sub-strings, not the separated keys and values: var result = mystring.match(/(?:&|&amp;)?([^=]+)=([^&]+)/g)
 The results for the string '1111342=Adam%20Franco&348572=Bob%20Jones' would be: ['1111342=Adam%20Franco', '&348572=Bob%20Jones']
 While I could split the string on & and break apart each key/value pair individually, is there any way using JavaScript's regular expression support to match multiple occurrences of the pattern /(?:&|&amp;)?([^=]+)=([^&]+)/ similar to PHP's preg_match_all() function? I'm aiming for some way to get results with the sub-matches separated like: [['1111342', '348572'], ['Adam%20Franco', 'Bob%20Jones']]

@TITLE:Mixing Forms authentication with Windows authentication
@CONTENT:I have an (ASP.NET 3.5) intranet application which has been designed to use forms authentication (along with the default aspnet membership system). I also store additional information about users in another table which shares its primary key with the aspnet_users table. For users who are part of our domain I store their domain account name in the secondary users table, and I want to automatically log in users whose domain account name matches a name stored in the table. I have read the guides which are available - they're all from two years ago or more and assume that you are able to activate Windows Authentication on a separate login page that allows you to extract the domain account name. From what I can tell, though, this is not possible in IIS7 (the overall authentication method is applied on all pages and cannot be selectively deactivated, and both authentication methods can't be applied on the same page). Is there a way of getting IIS to pass through the windows domain account name of the requesting user? I don't need proper AD authentication, just the domain name.

@TITLE:Any good recommendations for MP3/Sound libraries for java? [closed]
@CONTENT:I'm looking for libraries to: read and write meta data (for example ID3v2 tags in mp3 and all) convert compressed to to raw audio data and if possible raw audio data to mp3, ogg, aac, ... digitally process the audio data (energy, timbre, Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients - MFCC, FFT, LPC, Autocorrelation, Wavelet, ...) I already know and am not content with: JMF: original from Sun, reads mp3 and turns it into WAV. But does not read meta data nor provide any advanced digital processing features. FMJ: Alternative implementation to JMF with same limitations. jAudio: Not stable and although potential, currently not well maintained. Marsyas: In digital processing just what I had hoped for, but in C++. Maybe some port / integration already available? JID3: API for meta data, but seems to be dead (last release 2005/12/10). JLayer: API for reading and playing, also dead (last update 2004/11/28). MetaMusic: API of the program is neat but no official standalone open source project. Therefore has no community, future support and all... Light Dev: Some interesting features, but not at all complete. This is what some of my own investigation has turned up. I would greatly appreciate all input, suggestions, critics, ...

@TITLE:If/else statements in ANTLR using listeners
@CONTENT:I'm creating a simple programming language for a school project. I'm using ANTLR 4 to generate a lexer and a parser from my grammar. Until now, I have been using ANTLRs listener pattern to apply the actual functionality of the programming language. Now I would like to implement if/else statements but I'm not sure that these can actually be implemented when using the listener pattern as ANTLR decides in which order to traverse the parse tree when using listeners and I imagine that the implementation of if/else statements will require jumping around the parse tree depending on which condition in the statement is satisfied. Can anyone tell me if it will be possible to implement if/else statements using ANTLR or if I will have to implement the visitor pattern myself? Also, can anyone give an extremely simple example of the implementation the statements?

It works beautifully, except that Eclipse's Console (not LogCat!) issues the following error message: [2011-06-13 19:54:08 - MyLibrary] Could not find MyLibrary.apk!
 I cleaned both projects (library and application), restarted Eclipse, re-built the projects, but this weird error message persists. What does this error message mean? (especially in light that everything seems to be running OK) How do I get rid of it? UPDATE: I tried removing the project then re-importing it per the suggestion below. It didn't help. I then found this thread that helped me realize that I had <uses-library> in the application's AndroidManifest.xml referring to MyLibrary. I deleted it, cleaned the project and rebuilt. The problem persists. I am now suspecting this is "real problem", e.g. misconfiguration of some paths or something else on my part. What could it be?

 Xcode used to show the line just right with older SDKs but since i upgraded to Xocde 4.2 that changed. It is pretty obvious that Xcode knows exactly what caused the crash (or could know), but its still not showing the actual line. Is there any fix or workaround for this?

@TITLE:C# List<> Sort by x then y
@CONTENT:Similar to List<> OrderBy Alphabetical Order, we want to sort by one element, then another. we want to achieve the functional equivalent of SELECT * from Table ORDER BY x, y  
 We have a class that contains a number of sorting functions, and we have no issues sorting by one element. For example: public class MyClass {
    public int x;
    public int y;
}  

List<MyClass> MyList;

public void SortList() {
    MyList.Sort( MySortingFunction );
}
 And we have the following in the list: Unsorted     Sorted(x)     Desired
---------    ---------    ---------
ID   x  y    ID   x  y    ID   x  y
[0]  0  1    [2]  0  2    [0]  0  1
[1]  1  1    [0]  0  1    [2]  0  2

[3]  1  2    [3]  1  2    [3]  1  2
 Stable sort would be preferable, but not required. Solution that works for .Net 2.0 is welcome.

@TITLE:JavaScript parser in JavaScript
@CONTENT:I need to add some lightweight syntactic sugar to JavaScript source code, and process it using a JavaScript-based build system. Are there any open source JavaScript parsers written in JavaScript? And are they reasonably fast when run on top of V8 or a similar high-performance JavaScript implementation? Thank you for any pointers you can provide!

@LINK:/questions/1212742/xml-serialize-generic-list-of-serializable-objects
@TITLE:XML Serialize generic list of serializable objects
@CONTENT:Can I serialize a generic list of serializable objects without having to specify their type. Something like the intention behind the broken code below: List<ISerializable> serializableList = new List<ISerializable>();

XmlSerializer xmlSerializer = new XmlSerializer(serializableList.GetType());

serializableList.Add((ISerializable)PersonList);

using (StreamWriter streamWriter = System.IO.File.CreateText(fileName))
{
    xmlSerializer.Serialize(streamWriter, serializableList);
}
 Edit: For those who wanted to know detail: when I try to run this code, it errors on the XMLSerializer[...] line with: Cannot serialize interface System.Runtime.Serialization.ISerializable. If I change to List<object> I get "There was an error generating the XML document.". The InnerException detail is "{"The type System.Collections.Generic.List1[[Project1.Person, ConsoleFramework, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null]] may not be used in this context."}" The person object is defined as follows: [XmlRoot("Person")]
public class Person
{
    string _firstName = String.Empty;
    string _lastName = String.Empty;

    private Person()
    {
    }

    public Person(string lastName, string firstName)
    {
        _lastName = lastName;
        _firstName = firstName;
    }

    [XmlAttribute(DataType = "string", AttributeName = "LastName")]
    public string LastName
    {
        get { return _lastName; }
        set { _lastName = value; }
    }

    [XmlAttribute(DataType = "string", AttributeName = "FirstName")]
    public string FirstName
    {
        get { return _firstName; }
        set { _firstName = value; }
    }
}
 The PersonList is just a List<Person> . This is just for testing though, so didn't feel the details were too important. The key is I have one or more different objects, all of which are serializable. I want to serialize them all to one file. I thought the easiest way to do that would be to put them in a generic list and serialize the list in one go. But this doesn't work. I tried with List<IXmlSerializable> as well, but that fails with System.Xml.Serialization.IXmlSerializable cannot be serialized because it does not have a parameterless constructor. Sorry for the lack of detail, but I am a beginner at this and don't know what detail is required. It would be helpful if people asking for more detail tried to respond in a way that would leave me understanding what details are required, or a basic answer outlining possible directions. Also thanks to the two answers I've got so far - I could have spent a lot more time reading without getting these ideas. It's amazing how helpful people are on this site.

@LINK:/questions/7718935/load-scripts-asynchronously
@TITLE:load scripts asynchronously
@CONTENT:I am using several plugins, custom widgets and some other libraries from JQuery. as a result I have several .js and .css files. I need to create a loader for my site because it takes some time to load. it will be nice if I can display the loader before importing all the: <script type="text/javascript" src="js/jquery-1.6.2.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="js/myFunctions.js"></script>
<link type="text/css" href="css/main.css" rel="stylesheet" />
... 
....
 etc
 I have found several tutorials that enable me to import a JavaScript library asynchronously. for example I can do something like:   (function () {
        var s = document.createElement('script');
        s.type = 'text/javascript';
        s.async = true;
        s.src = 'js/jquery-ui-1.8.16.custom.min.js';
        var x = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];
        x.parentNode.insertBefore(s, x);
    })();
 for some reason when I do the same thing for all my files the pages does not work. I have been trying for so long to try to find where the problem is but I just cannot find it. First I thought that it was probably because some javascript functions depended on the others. but I loaded them in the right order using the time out function when one completed I proceeded with the next and the page still behaves weird. for example I am not able to click on links etc... animations still work though.. Anyways Here is what I have been thinking... I believe browsers have a cache that's why it takes a long time to load the page for the first time and the next time it is quick. so what I am thinking of doing is replacing my index.html page with a page that loads all this files asynchronously. when ajax is done loading all those files redirect to the page that I plan on using. when using that page it should not take long to load since the files should alredy be included on the cache of the browser. on my index page (page where .js and .css file get loaded asynchronously) I don't care of getting errors. I will just be displaying a loader and redirecting the page when done... Is this idea a good alternative? or should I keep trying on implementing the asynchronously methods? EDIT the way I load everything async is like: importScripts();

@CONTENT:I have the activity with several input fields. When activity started soft keyboard is shown. When back button pressed soft keyboard closes and to close activity I need to press back button one more time. So the question: is it possible to intercept back button to close soft keyboard and finish activity in one press of back button without creating custom InputMethodService? P.S. I know how to intercept back button in other cases: onKeyDown() or onBackPressed() but it doesn't work in this case: only second press of back button is intercepted.

@CONTENT:I have a simple Windows Forms (C#, .NET 2.0) application, built with Visual Studio 2008. I would like to support multiple UI languages, and using the "Localizable" property of the form, and culture-specific .resx files, the localization aspect works seamlessly and easily.

I would like to have the application be deployed (copied into place) as a single assembly, and yet retain the ability to contain multiple sets of culture-specific resources. Using ILMerge (or ILRepack), I can merge the satellite assemblies into the main executable assembly, but the standard .NET ResourceManager fallback mechanisms do not find the culture-specific resources that were compiled into the main assembly. Interestingly, if I take my merged (executable) assembly and place copies of it into the culture-specific subfolders, then everything works! Similarly, I can see the main and culture-specific resources in the merged assemby when I use Reflector (or ILSpy). But copying the main assembly into culture-specific subfolders defeats the purpose of the merging anyway - I really need there to be just a single copy of the single assembly... I'm wondering whether there is any way to hijack or influence the ResourceManager fallback mechanisms to look for the culture-specific resources in the same assembly rather than in the GAC and culture-named subfolders. I see the fallback mechanism described in the following articles, but no clue as to how it would be modified: BCL Team Blog Article on ResourceManager. Does anyone have any idea? This seems to be a relatively frequent question online (for example, another question here on Stack Overflow: "ILMerge and localized resource assemblies"), but I have not found any authoritative answer anywhere. UPDATE 1: Basic Solution Following casperOne's recommendation below, I was finally able to make this work. I'm putting the solution code here in the question because casperOne provided the only answer, I don't want to add my own. I was able to get it to work by pulling the guts out of the Framework resource-finding fallback mechanisms implemented in the "InternalGetResourceSet" method and making our same-assembly search the first mechanism used. If the resource is not found in the current assembly, then we call the base method to initiate the default search mechanisms (thanks to @Wouter's comment below). To do this, I derived the "ComponentResourceManager" class, and overrode just one method (and re-implemented a private framework method): class SingleAssemblyComponentResourceManager : 
    System.ComponentModel.ComponentResourceManager
{
    private Type _contextTypeInfo;
    private CultureInfo _neutralResourcesCulture;

    public SingleAssemblyComponentResourceManager(Type t)
        : base(t)
    {
        _contextTypeInfo = t;
    }

    protected override ResourceSet InternalGetResourceSet(CultureInfo culture, 
        bool createIfNotExists, bool tryParents)
    {
        ResourceSet rs = (ResourceSet)this.ResourceSets[culture];
        if (rs == null)
        {
            Stream store = null;
            string resourceFileName = null;

            //lazy-load default language (without caring about duplicate assignment in race conditions, no harm done);
            if (this._neutralResourcesCulture == null)
            {
                this._neutralResourcesCulture = 
                    GetNeutralResourcesLanguage(this.MainAssembly);
            }

            // if we're asking for the default language, then ask for the
            // invariant (non-specific) resources.
            if (_neutralResourcesCulture.Equals(culture))
                culture = CultureInfo.InvariantCulture;
            resourceFileName = GetResourceFileName(culture);

            store = this.MainAssembly.GetManifestResourceStream(
                this._contextTypeInfo, resourceFileName);

            //If we found the appropriate resources in the local assembly
            if (store != null)
            {
                rs = new ResourceSet(store);
                //save for later.
                AddResourceSet(this.ResourceSets, culture, ref rs);
            }
            else
            {
                rs = base.InternalGetResourceSet(culture, createIfNotExists, tryParents);
            }
        }
        return rs;
    }

    //private method in framework, had to be re-specified here.
    private static void AddResourceSet(Hashtable localResourceSets, 
        CultureInfo culture, ref ResourceSet rs)
    {
        lock (localResourceSets)
        {
            ResourceSet objA = (ResourceSet)localResourceSets[culture];
            if (objA != null)
            {
                if (!object.Equals(objA, rs))
                {
                    rs.Dispose();
                    rs = objA;
                }
            }
            else
            {
                localResourceSets.Add(culture, rs);
            }
        }
    }
}
 To actually use this class, you need to replace the System.ComponentModel.ComponentResourceManager in the "XXX.Designer.cs" files created by Visual Studio - and you will need to do this every time you change the designed form - Visual Studio replaces that code automatically. (The problem was discussed in "Customize Windows Forms Designer to use MyResourceManager", I did not find a more elegant solution - I use fart.exe in a pre-build step to auto-replace.) UPDATE 2: Another Practical Consideration - more than 2 languages At the time I reported the solution above, I was actually only supporting two languages, and ILMerge was doing a fine job of merging my satellite assembly into the final merged assembly. Recently I started working on a similar project where there are multiple secondary languages, and therefore multiple satellite assemblies, and ILMerge was doing something very strange: Instead of merging the multiple satellite assemblies I had requested, it was merging the first satellite assembly in multiple times! eg command-line: "c:\Program Files\Microsoft\ILMerge\ILMerge.exe" /t:exe /out:%1SomeFinalProg.exe %1InputProg.exe %1es\InputProg.resources.dll %1fr\InputProg.resources.dll
 With that command-line, I was getting the following sets of resources in the merged assembly (observed with ILSpy decompiler): InputProg.resources
InputProg.es.resources
InputProg.es.resources <-- Duplicated!
 After some playing around, I ended up realizing this is just a bug in ILMerge when it encounters multiple files with the same name in a single command-line call. The solution is simply to merge each satellite assembly in a different command-line call: "c:\Program Files\Microsoft\ILMerge\ILMerge.exe" /t:exe /out:%1TempProg.exe %1InputProg.exe %1es\InputProg.resources.dll
"c:\Program Files\Microsoft\ILMerge\ILMerge.exe" /t:exe /out:%1SomeFinalProg.exe %1TempProg.exe %1fr\InputProg.resources.dll
 When I do this, the resulting resources in the final assembly are correct: InputProg.resources
InputProg.es.resources
InputProg.fr.resources
 So finally, in case this helps clarify, here's a complete post-build batch file: "%ProgramFiles%\Microsoft\ILMerge\ILMerge.exe" /t:exe /out:%1TempProg.exe %1InputProg.exe %1es\InputProg.resources.dll 
IF %ERRORLEVEL% NEQ 0 GOTO END

"%ProgramFiles%\Microsoft\ILMerge\ILMerge.exe" /t:exe /out:%1SomeFinalProg.exe %1TempProg.exe %1fr\InputProg.resources.dll 
IF %ERRORLEVEL% NEQ 0 GOTO END

del %1InputProg.pdb 
del %1TempProg.exe 
del %1TempProg.pdb 
del %1es\*.* /Q 
del %1fr\*.* /Q 
:END
 UPDATE 3: ILRepack Another quick note - One of the things that bothered me with ILMerge was that it is an additional proprietary Microsoft tool, not installed by default with Visual Studio, and therefore an extra dependency that makes it that little bit harder for a third party to get started with my open-source projects. I recently discovered ILRepack, an open-source (Apache 2.0) equivalent that so far works just as well for me (drop-in replacement), and can be freely distributed with your project sources. I hope this helps someone out there!

@LINK:/questions/21350125/afnetworking-2-0-and-background-transfers
@TITLE:AFNetworking 2.0 and background transfers
@CONTENT:I'm a bit confuse of how to take advantage of the new iOS 7 NSURLSession background transfers features and AFNetworking 2.0. I saw the WWDC 705 - What¡¦s New in Foundation Networking session, and they demonstrated background download that continues after the app terminated or even crashes. This is done using the new API application:handleEventsForBackgroundURLSession:completionHandler: and the fact that the session's delegate will eventually get the callbacks and can complete its task. So I'm wondering how to use it with AFNetworking 2.0 (if possible) to continue downloadin in background. The problem is, AFNetworking 2.0 conveniently uses block based API to do all the requests, but if the app terminated or crashes those block are also gone. So how can I complete the task? Or maybe I'm missing something here... Let me explain what I mean For example my app is a photo messaging app, lets say that I have a PhotoMessage object that represent one message and this object has properties like state - describe the state of the photo download. resourcePath - the path to the final downloaded photo file. So when I get a new message from the server, I create a new PhotoMessage object, and start downloading its photo resource.  PhotoMessage *newPhotoMsg = [[PhotoMessage alloc] initWithInfoFromServer:info];
 newPhotoMsg.state = kStateDownloading;

 self.photoDownloadTask = [[BGSessionManager sharedManager] downloadTaskWithRequest:request progress:nil destination:^NSURL *(NSURL *targetPath, NSURLResponse *response) {
        NSURL *filePath = // some file url
        return filePath;
    } completionHandler:^(NSURLResponse *response, NSURL *filePath, NSError *error) {
        if (!error) {
            // update the PhotoMessage Object
            newPhotoMsg.state = kStateDownloadFinished;
            newPhotoMsg.resourcePath = filePath;
        }
    }];

    [self.photoDownloadTask resume];   
 As you can see, I use the completion block to update that PhotoMessage object according to the response I get. How can I accomplish that with a background transfer? This completion block won't be called and as a result, I can't update the newPhotoMsg.
@CODE:NSURLSession AFNetworking 2.0 WWDC 705 - What¡¦s New in Foundation Networking application:handleEventsForBackgroundURLSession:completionHandler: AFNetworking 2.0 AFNetworking 2.0 PhotoMessage state resourcePath PhotoMessage PhotoMessage *newPhotoMsg = [[PhotoMessage alloc] initWithInfoFromServer:info];

 (....more text follows) First, I spent a long time investigating [NSFont fontWithName:size:]. I figured that maybe the user's fonts were screwed up somehow, so that [NSFont fontWithName:size:] was requesting something non-existent and failing for that reason. I added a bunch of code using [[NSFontManager sharedFontManager] availableFontNamesWithTraits:NSItalicFontMask] to check for font availability in advance. Sadly, these changes didn't fix the problem. I've now noticed that I forgot to remove some debugging breakpoints, including _NSLockError, [NSException raise], and objc_exception_throw. However, the app was definitely built using "Release" as the active build configuration. I assume that using the "Release" configuration prevents setting of any breakpoints--but then again I am not sure exactly how breakpoints work or whether the program needs to be run from within gdb for breakpoints to have any effect. My questions are: could my having left the breakpoints set be the cause of the crashes observed by the user? If so, why would the breakpoints cause a problem only for this one user? If not, has anybody else had similar problems with [NSFont fontWithName:size:]? I will probably just try removing the breakpoints and sending back to the user, but I'm not sure how much currency I have left with that user. And I'd like to understand more generally whether leaving the breakpoints set could possibly cause a problem (when the app is built using "Release" configuration).

@CONTENT:It's been a while since I last coded arm assembler and I'm a little rusty on the details. If I call a C function from arm, I only have to worry about saving r0-r3 and lr, right? If the C function uses any other registers, is it responsible for saving those on the stack and restoring them? In other words, the compiler would generate code to do this for C functions. For example if I use r10 in an assembler function, I don't have to push its value on the stack, or to memory, and pop/restore it after a C call, do I? This is for arm-eabi-gcc 4.3.0. I realise I could read the whole EABI, but then shortcutting RTFM is what SO is for, right? :-)

@TITLE:How to create and use nonces
@CONTENT:I am running a website, and there is a scoring system that gives you points for the number of times you play a game. It uses hashing to prove the integrity of http request for scoring so users cannot change anything, however as I feared might happen, someone figured out that they didn't need to change it, they just needed to get a high score, and duplicate the http request, headers and all. Previously I'd been prohibited from protecting against this attack because it was considered unlikely. However, now that it has happened, I can. The http request originates from a flash game, and then is validated by php and php enters it into the database. I'm pretty sure nonces will solve the issue, but I'm not exactly sure how to implement them. What is a common, and secure way of setting up a nonce system?

@TITLE:Escaping MySQL wild cards
@CONTENT:On an older server I'm using that I can't use prepared statements on I am currently trying to fully escape user input before sending it to MySQL. For this I am using the PHP function mysql_real_escape_string. Since this function does not escape the MySQL wildcards % and _ I am using addcslashes to escape these as well. When I send something like: test_test " ' 
 to the database and then read it back the database shows: test\_test " ' 
 Looking at this I can't understand why the _ has a preceding backslash but the " and ' don't. Since they are all escaped with \ surely _ ' and " should all appear the same, i.e. all have the escape character visible or all not have it visible. Are the escaping \s automatically screened out for Can anyone explain this?

@LINK:/questions/2554779/jquery-ui-close-dialog-when-clicked-outside
@TITLE:jQuery UI - Close Dialog When Clicked Outside
@CONTENT:I have a jQuery UI Dialog that gets displayed when specific elements are clicked. I would like to close the dialog if a click occurs anywhere other than on those triggering elements or the dialog itself. Here's the code for opening the dialog: $(document).ready(function() {
    var $field_hint = $('<div></div>')
        .dialog({
            autoOpen: false,
            minHeight: 50,
            resizable: false,
            width: 375
        });

    $('.hint').click(function() {
        var $hint = $(this);
        $field_hint.html($hint.html());
        $field_hint.dialog('option', 'position', [162, $hint.offset().top + 25]);
        $field_hint.dialog('option', 'title', $hint.siblings('label').html());
        $field_hint.dialog('open');
    });
    /*$(document).click(function() {
        $field_hint.dialog('close');
    });*/
});
 If I uncomment the last part, the dialog never opens. I assume it's because the same click that opens the dialog is closing it again. Final Working Code Note: This is using the jQuery outside events plugin $(document).ready(function() {
    // dialog element to .hint
    var $field_hint = $('<div></div>')

However, some colleagues want to break functional areas out into separate DbContext classes. I believe this comes from a good place -- a desire to keep the code cleaner -- but it seems volatile. My gut's telling me it's a bad idea, but unfortunately my gut feeling is not a sufficient condition for a design decision. So I'm looking for A) concrete examples of why this might be a bad idea, or B) assurances that this'll all work out just fine.

@TITLE:How do you remove invalid hexadecimal characters from an XML-based data source prior to constructing an XmlReader or XPathDocument that uses the data?
@CONTENT:Is there any easy/general way to clean an XML based data source prior to using it in an XmlReader so that I can gracefully consume XML data that is non-conformant to the hexadecimal character restrictions placed on XML? Note: The solution needs to handle XML data sources that use character encodings other than UTF-8, e.g. by specifying the character encoding at the XML document declaration. Not mangling the character encoding of the source while stripping invalid hexadecimal characters has been a major sticking point. The removal of invalid hexadecimal characters should only remove hexadecimal encoded values, as you can often find href values in data that happens to contains a string that would be a string match for a hexadecimal character. Background: I need to consume an XML-based data source that conforms to a specific format (think Atom or RSS feeds), but want to be able to consume data sources that have been published which contain invalid hexadecimal characters per the XML specification. In .NET if you have a Stream that represents the XML data source, and then attempt to parse it using an XmlReader and/or XPathDocument, an exception is raised due to the inclusion of invalid hexadecimal characters in the XML data. My current attempt to resolve this issue is to parse the Stream as a string and use a regular expression to remove and/or replace the invalid hexadecimal characters, but I am looking for a more performant solution.

}); I am working on an e-commerce site at the moment, the page that displays your future orders has the ability to alter the quantities of items ordered using +/- buttons. Changing the quantities this way this doesn't actually change the order itself, they have to press confirm and therefore committing a positive action to change the order. However if they have changed the quantities and navigate away from the page I would like to warn them they are doing so in case this is an accident, as the changed quantities will be lost if they navigate away or refresh the page. In the code above I am using a global variable which will be false by default (its only true for testing), when a quantity is changed I will update this variable to be true, and when they confirm the changes I will set it to false. If warning is true and the page is unloaded, I offer them a confirmation box, if they say no they would like to stay on this page I need to stop it from unloading. return false isn't working, it still lets the user navigate away (the alerts are there for debugging only) Any ideas?

@TITLE:Git - how to force merge conflict and manual merge on selected file
@CONTENT:We maintain web application which has common master branch and many parallel branches, one for each installation, each have few specific changes. Source code is managed in git and it is terrific tool when we need transfer features and bugfixes from master branch into parallel ones. But are few files that are sensitive and automatic merging usually give bad results. So merging would be much easier if they can be somehow marked and every merge would result in conflict requiring manual merge. I searched for an answer : I am using --no-commit and --no-ff merge options, but it is not the same. Here and here someone asks the same question but with no solution. Similar case seems to be how to prevent file being merged using .gitattributes containing: somefile.php merge=ours . I tried to find some merge option which would generate conflict or force manual merge but found none so far. .gitattributes containing: somefile.php -merge is never merged automatically and therefore forcing manual merge. It is 90% solution, but what I seek is to try automatic merge and mark it as conflict regardless it is successful or not. But this is so far closest to solution. (...thanks Charles Bailey for clarification...) Someone suggest to write custom merge driver (1, 2), but how to do it is far from clear to me. edit: variant 4. description

What's important-I'm writing in C++, the image is stored in cv::Mat variable. I know there is an IplImage() operator, but IplImage is not very comfortable in use-as far as I know it comes from C API. Yes, I'm aware that there was already this Pixel access in OpenCV 2.2 thread, but it was only about black and white bitmaps. EDIT: Thank you very much for all your answers. I see there are many ways to get/set RGB value of pixel. I got one more idea from my close friend-thanks Benny! It's very simple and effective. I think it's a matter of taste which one you choose. Mat image;
 (...) Point3_<uchar>* p = image.ptr<Point3_<uchar> >(y,x);
 And then you can read/write RGB values with: p->x //B
p->y //G
p->z //R

@TITLE:Data binding dynamic data
@CONTENT:I have a set of 'dynamic data' that I need to bind to the GridControl. Up until now, I have been using the standard DataTable class that's part of the System.Data namespace. This has worked fine, but I've been told I cannot use this as it's too heavy for serialization across the network between client & server. So I thought I could easy replicate a 'cut-down' version of the DataTable class by simply having a type of List<Dictionary<string, object>> whereby the List represents the collection of rows, and each Dictionary represents one row with the column names and values as a KeyValuePair type. I could set up the Grid to have the column DataField properties to match those of the keys in the Dictionary (just like I was doing for the DataTable's column names. However after doing gridControl.DataSource = table;
gridControl.RefreshDataSource();
 The grid has no data... I think I need to implement IEnumerator - any help on this would be much appreciated! Example calling code looks like this: var table = new List<Dictionary<string,object>>();

var row = new Dictionary<string, object>
{
    {"Field1", "Data1"},
    {"Field2", "Data2"},
    {"Field3", "Data3"}

table.Add(row);

if var list = possList {
    list = list.componentsSeparatedByString("\n") as NSString[]
    return list
}
else {

}
 I'm not very happy with this for a couple of reasons. One, I'm working with files that range from a few kilobytes to hundreds of MB in size. As you can imagine, working with strings this large is slow and unwieldy. Secondly, this freezes up the UI when it's executing--again, not good. I've looked into running this code in a separate thread, but I've been having trouble with that, and besides, it still doesn't solve the problem of dealing with huge strings. What I'd like to do is something along the lines of the following pseudocode: var aStreamReader = new StreamReader(from_file_or_url)
while aStreamReader.hasNextLine == true {
    currentline = aStreamReader.nextLine()
    list.addItem(currentline)
}
 How would I accomplish this in Swift? A few notes about the files I'm reading from: All files consist of short (<255 chars) strings separated by either \n or \r\n. The length of the files range from ~100 lines to over 50 million lines. They may contain European characters, and/or characters with accents.
@CODE:NSURL \n var possList: NSString? = NSString.stringWithContentsOfURL(filePath.URL) as? NSString

@CONTENT:Consider the C program composed of two files, f1.c: int x;
 f2.c: int x=2;
 My reading of paragraph 6.9.2 of the C99 standard is that this program should be rejected. In my interpretation of 6.9.2, variable x is tentatively defined in f1.c, but this tentative definition becomes an actual definition at the end of the translation unit, and (in my opinion), should therefore behave as if f1.c contained the definition int x=0;. With all compilers (and, importantly, linkers) I was able to try, this is not what happens. All compilation platforms I tried do link the above two files, and the value of x is 2 in both files. I doubt this happens by accident, or just as an "easy" feature to provide in addition to what the standard requires. If you think about it, it means there is special support in the linker for those global variables that do not have an initializer, as opposed to those explicitly initialized to zero. Someone told me that the linker feature may be necessary to compile Fortran anyway. That would be a reasonable explanation. Any thoughts about this? Other interpretations of the standard? Names of platforms on which files f1.c and f2.c refuse to be linked together? Note: this is important because the question occurs in the context of static analysis. If the two files may refuse to be linked on some platform, the analyzer should complain, but if every compilation platform accepts it then there is no reason to warn about it.

@CONTENT:In PHP, you can do... range(1, 3); // Array(1, 2, 3)
range("A", "C"); // Array("A", "B", "C")
 That is, there is a function that lets you get a range of numbers or characters by passing the upper and lower bounds. Is there anything built-in to JavaScript natively for this? If not, how would I implement it?

webClient.DownloadFile(downloadUrl, downloadFile);
 Is there a way to set an infinite timeout on this object? Or if not can anyone help me with an example on an alternate way to do this? The URL works fine in a browser - it just takes about 3 minutes to show.

@TITLE:How do you remove a Cookie in a Java Servlet
@CONTENT:How do you remove a cookie in a Java servlet? I tried this: http://www.jguru.com/faq/view.jsp?EID=42225 EDIT: The following now works successfully it appears to be the combination of: response.setContentType("text/html");
 and cookie.setMaxAge(0);
 Before I was doing: //remove single signon cookie if it hasn't been validated yet
response.setContentType("text/html");
Cookie cookie = new Cookie(SSORealm.SSO_COOKIE_NAME, "");
cookie.setDomain(SSORealm.SSO_DOMAIN);
cookie.setMaxAge(-1);
cookie.setPath("/");
cookie.setComment("EXPIRING COOKIE at " + System.currentTimeMillis());
response.addCookie(cookie);
 Which expires the cookie when the browser is closed as per the documentation. A negative value means that the cookie is not stored persistently and will be deleted when the Web browser exits. A zero value causes the cookie to be deleted. The full working snippet to expire a cookie is: //remove single signon cookie if it hasn't been validated yet
response.setContentType("text/html");
Cookie cookie = new Cookie(SSORealm.SSO_COOKIE_NAME, "");
cookie.setDomain(SSORealm.SSO_DOMAIN);
cookie.setMaxAge(0);

@LINK:/questions/104516/calling-php-functions-within-heredoc-strings
@TITLE:Calling PHP functions within HEREDOC strings
@CONTENT:In PHP, the HEREDOC string declarations are really useful for outputting a block of html. You can have it parse in variables just by prefixing them with $, but for more complicated syntax (like $var[2][3]), you have to put your expression inside {} braces. In PHP 5, it is possible to actually make function calls within {} braces inside a HEREDOC string, but you have to go through a bit of work. The function name itself has to be stored in a variable, and you have to call it like it is a dynamically-named function. For example: $fn = 'testfunction';
function testfunction() { return 'ok'; }
$string = <<< heredoc
plain text and now a function: {$fn()}
heredoc;
 As you can see, this is a bit more messy than just: $string = <<< heredoc
plain text and now a function: {testfunction()}
heredoc;
 There are other ways besides the first code example, such as breaking out of the HEREDOC to call the function, or reversing the issue and doing something like: ?>
<!-- directly output html and only breaking into php for the function -->
plain text and now a function: <?PHP print testfunction(); ?>
 The latter has the disadvantage that the output is directly put into the output stream (unless I'm using output buffering), which might not be what I want. So, the essence of my question is: is there a more elegant way to approach this? Edit based on responses: It certainly does seem like some kind of template engine would make my life much easier, but it would require me basically invert my usual PHP style. Not that that's a bad thing, but it explains my inertia.. I'm up for figuring out ways to make life easier though, so I'm looking into templates now.
@CODE:$fn = 'testfunction';
function testfunction() { return 'ok'; }
$string = <<< heredoc
plain text and now a function: {$fn()}
heredoc; $string = <<< heredoc
plain text and now a function: {testfunction()}
heredoc; ?>

@LINK:/questions/444591/convert-a-string-of-bytes-into-an-int-python
@TITLE:convert a string of bytes into an int (python)
@CONTENT:How can I convert a string of bytes into an int in python? Say like this: 'y\xcc\xa6\xbb' I came up with a clever/stupid way of doing it: sum(ord(c) << (i * 8) for i, c in enumerate('y\xcc\xa6\xbb'[::-1]))
 I know there has to be something builtin or in the standard library that does this more simply... This is different from converting a string of hex digits for which you can use int(xxx, 16), but instead I want to convert a string of actual byte values. UPDATE: I kind of like James' answer a little better because it doesn't require importing another module, but Greg's method is faster: >>> from timeit import Timer
>>> Timer('struct.unpack("<L", "y\xcc\xa6\xbb")[0]', 'import struct').timeit()
0.36242198944091797
>>> Timer("int('y\xcc\xa6\xbb'.encode('hex'), 16)").timeit()
1.1432669162750244
 My hacky method: >>> Timer("sum(ord(c) << (i * 8) for i, c in enumerate('y\xcc\xa6\xbb'[::-1]))").timeit()
2.8819329738616943
 FURTHER UPDATE: Someone asked in comments what's the problem with importing another module. Well, importing a module isn't necessarily cheap, take a look: >>> Timer("""import struct\nstruct.unpack(">L", "y\xcc\xa6\xbb")[0]""").timeit()
0.98822188377380371
 Including the cost of importing the module negates almost all of the advantage that this method has. I believe that this will only include the expense of importing it once for the entire benchmark run; look what happens when I force it to reload every time: >>> Timer("""reload(struct)\nstruct.unpack(">L", "y\xcc\xa6\xbb")[0]""", 'import struct').timeit()
68.474128007888794
 Needless to say, if you're doing a lot of executions of this method per one import than this becomes proportionally less of an issue. It's also probably i/o cost rather than cpu so it may depend on the capacity and load characteristics of the particular machine.
@CODE:'y\xcc\xa6\xbb' sum(ord(c) << (i * 8) for i, c in enumerate('y\xcc\xa6\xbb'[::-1])) >>> from timeit import Timer
>>> Timer('struct.unpack("<L", "y\xcc\xa6\xbb")[0]', 'import struct').timeit()

First of all, it doesn't truly justify it, but rather spreads the li tags evenly throughout the ul tag.. creating uneven white-space between smaller menu items like "HOME" or "ABOUT" and larger ones like "BASIC SERVICES". The second problem is that the layout breaks if a nav item is larger than 150px, which SPECIALTY SERVICES is - even though there is more than enough space for the whole nav. Can anyone solve this for me? I've been scouring the web for solutions, and they all seem to come up short. CSS / HTML only if possible... Thanks! UPDATE (7/29/13): Using table-cell is the best modern way to implement this layout. See felix's answer below. The table cell property works on 94% of browsers currently. You'll have to do something about IE7 and below, but otherwise should be ok. UPDATE (7/30/13): Unfortunately, there is a webkit bug that impacts this if you're combining this layout with Media Queries. For now you'll have to avoid changing the 'display' property. See Webkit Bug. UPDATE (7/25/14): There is a better solution to this below now involving text-align: justify. Using this is simpler and you'll avoid the Webkit bug.

@TITLE:Tower of Hanoi: Recursive Algorithm
@CONTENT:I am a Computer Science student, and as such I have no problem whatsoever understanding recursion. However, I can't seem to wrap my head around the recursive solution to the Tower of Hanoi problem. Here is the code from Wikipedia: procedure Hanoi(n: integer; source, dest, by: char);
Begin
    if (n=1) then
        writeln('Move the plate from ', source, ' to ', dest)
    else begin
        Hanoi(n-1, source, by, dest);
        writeln('Move the plate from ', source, ' to ', dest);
        Hanoi(n-1, by, dest, source);
    end;
End; I understand the base case and the concept of breaking the problem into smaller pieces until you are able to move a single disk. However, I can't figure out how the two recursive calls in the non-base case work together. Perhaps someone can help me out? Thanks.

//Do smthing.
}
protected void pager_Right_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)

//Do smthing.
}
 and when I click my button, it is disabled for 1-2 seconds and automatically enabled, but I am not sure why it is enabled. I didn't add any part for it to be enabled again.

@TITLE:Android: how to change the color of the datepicker divider?
@CONTENT:I've got a datepicker in my Android app, but now I want to change the color of the blue dividers into green (see the image below this text). There are some other discussions on Stackoverflow that talk about the same, but none of them gives an answer which leads to a solution. So I went looking myself and found there is actually an android:datePickerStyle and there is also an android:divider. I don't know however, whether the divider is actually referring to the divider in the datepicker at all. I tried a multitude of combinations of the two, but I don't seem to get it to work. So my first question: Does the android:divider refer to the divider in the datepicker, and how could I use it to change color? So another option is supposedly to create a fully new custom datepicker. If that enables me to just change the color of the divider I'm down for it. So I had a look at some of the tutorials on creating a custom datepicker, but none of them seem to define the color of the dividers. The dividers are simply not listed in the xml files or in the java files. It would be great if there would be some kind of boilerplate code to recreate the datepicker as it currently displays, including the code that sets the color of the dividers. Hopefully that would enable me to copy it and simply change the color setting of the divider somewhere. So my second question: Would anybody know any boilerplate code which simply implements the datepicker as it is now (including a definition of the dividers)?

 } So, the TCPServer.java will be executed first, and then execute the TCPClient.java, and I try to use the if clause in the TCPServer.java to test what is user's input,now I really want to implement how to transfer files from both side(download and upload).Thanks.

@TITLE:Multiple files upload (Array) with CodeIgniter 2.0
@CONTENT:I've been searching and struggling for 3 days now to make this works but I just can't. What I want to do is use a Multiple file input form and then upload them. I can't just use a fixed number of file to upload. I tried many many solutions on StackOverflow but I wasn't able to find a working one. Here's my Upload controller <?php

    $config['allowed_types'] = 'gif|jpg|png';


    $this->load->library('upload');

 foreach($_FILES['userfile'] as $key => $value)

 I just keep having this error : You did not select a file to upload.

I also use the standard Upload library.

@TITLE:Why 'this' is a pointer and not a reference?
@CONTENT:I was reading the answers to this question C++ pros and cons and got this doubt while reading the comments. programmers frequently find it confusing that "this" is a pointer but not a reference. another confusion is why "hello" is not of type std::string but evaluates to a char const* (pointer) (after array to pointer conversion) ¡V Johannes Schaub - litb Dec 22 '08 at 1:56 That only shows that it doesn't use the same conventions as other (later) languages. ¡V le dorfier Dec 22 '08 at 3:35 I'd call the "this" thing a pretty trivial issue though. And oops, thanks for catching a few errors in my examples of undefined behavior. :) Although I don't understand what info about size has to do with anything in the first one. A pointer is simply not allowed to point outside allocated memory ¡V jalf Dec 22 '08 at 4:18 Is this a constant poiner? ¡V yesraaj Dec 22 '08 at 6:35 this can be constant if the method is const int getFoo() const; <- in the scope of getFoo, "this" is constant, and is therefore readonly. This prevents bugs and provides some level of guarantee to the caller that the object won't change. ¡V Doug T. Dec 22 '08 at 16:42 you can't reassign "this". i.e you cannot do "this = &other;", because this is an rvalue. but this is of type T*, not of type T const . i.e it's a non-constant pointer. if you are in a const method, then it's a pointer to const. T const . but the pointer itself is nonconst ¡V Johannes Schaub - litb Dec 22 '08 at 17:53 think of "this" like this: #define this (this_ + 0) where the compiler creates "this_" as a pointer to the object and makes "this" a keyword. you can't assign "this" because (this_ + 0) is an rvalue. of course that's not how it is (there is no such macro), but it can help understand it ¡V Johannes Schaub - litb Dec 22 '08 at 17:55 My question is, why this is a pointer a not a reference? Any particular reason for making it a pointer? Some further arguments why this being a reference would make sense: Consider Item 1 from More Effective C++: use references when it is guaranteed that we have a valid object i.e. not a NULL (my interpretation). Furthermore, references are considered safer than pointers (because we can't screw the memory up with a stray pointer). Thirdly, the syntax for accessing references (.) is a little bit nicer and shorter than accessing pointers (-> or (*)).

@CONTENT:I'm working on a PHP form that attaches a file to an email, and trying to gracefully handle cases where the uploaded file is too large. I've learned that there are two settings in php.ini that affect the maxiumum size of a file upload: upload_max_filesize and post_max_size. If a file's size exceeds upload_max-filesize, PHP returns the file's size as 0. That's fine; I can check for that. But if it exceeds post_max_size, my script fails silently and goes back to the blank form. Is there any way to catch this error?

@LINK:/questions/2797261/mutating-the-expression-tree-of-a-predicate-to-target-another-type
@TITLE:Mutating the expression tree of a predicate to target another type
@CONTENT:Intro In the application I 'm currently working on, there are two kinds of each business object: the "ActiveRecord" kind and the "DataContract" kind. So for example, there would be: namespace ActiveRecord {
    class Widget {
        public int Id { get; set; }
    }
}

namespace DataContract {
    class Widget {
        public int Id { get; set; }
    }
}
 The database access layer takes care of translating between families: you can tell it to update a DataContract.Widget and it will magically create an ActiveRecord.Widget with the same property values and save that instead. The problem surfaced when attempting to refactor this database access layer. The Problem I want to add methods like the following to the database access layer: // Widget is DataContract.Widget

interface IDbAccessLayer {
    IEnumerable<Widget> GetMany(Expression<Func<Widget, bool>> predicate);
}
 The above is a simple general-use "get" method with custom predicate. The only point of interest is that I am passing in an expression tree instead of a lambda because inside IDbAccessLayer I am querying an IQueryable<ActiveRecord.Widget>; to do that efficiently (think LINQ to SQL) I need to pass in an expression tree so this method asks for just that. The snag: the parameter needs to be magically transformed from an Expression<Func<DataContract.Widget, bool>> to an Expression<Func<ActiveRecord.Widget, bool>>. Attempted Solution What I 'd like to do inside GetMany is: IEnumerable<DataContract.Widget> GetMany(
    Expression<Func<DataContract.Widget, bool>> predicate)
{
    var lambda = Expression.Lambda<Func<ActiveRecord.Widget, bool>>(
        predicate.Body,
        predicate.Parameters);

    // use lambda to query ActiveRecord.Widget and return some value
}
 This won't work because in a typical scenario, for example if: predicate == w => w.Id == 0;
 ...the expression tree contains a MemberAccessExpression instance which has a property of type MemberInfo that describes DataContract.Widget.Id. There are also ParameterExpression instances both in the expression tree and in its parameter collection (predicate.Parameters) that describe DataContract.Widget; all of this will result in errors since the queryable body does not contain that type of widget but rather ActiveRecord.Widget. After searching a bit, I found System.Linq.Expressions.ExpressionVisitor (its source can be found here in the context of a how-to), which offers a convenient way to modify an expression tree. In .NET 4, this class is included out of the box. Armed with this, I implemented a visitor. This simple visitor only takes care of changing the types in member access and parameter expressions, but that's enough functionality to work with the predicate w => w.Id == 0. internal class Visitor : ExpressionVisitor
{
    private readonly Func<Type, Type> typeConverter;

    public Visitor(Func<Type, Type> typeConverter)
    {
        this.typeConverter = typeConverter;
    }

    protected override Expression VisitMember(MemberExpression node)
    {
        var dataContractType = node.Member.ReflectedType;
        var activeRecordType = this.typeConverter(dataContractType);

        var converted = Expression.MakeMemberAccess(
            base.Visit(node.Expression),
            activeRecordType.GetProperty(node.Member.Name));

        return converted;
    }

    protected override Expression VisitParameter(ParameterExpression node)
    {
        var dataContractType = node.Type;
        var activeRecordType = this.typeConverter(dataContractType);

        return Expression.Parameter(activeRecordType, node.Name);
    }
}
 With this visitor, GetMany becomes: IEnumerable<DataContract.Widget> GetMany(
    Expression<Func<DataContract.Widget, bool>> predicate)
{
    var visitor = new Visitor(...);
    var lambda = Expression.Lambda<Func<ActiveRecord.Widget, bool>>(
        visitor.Visit(predicate.Body),
        predicate.Parameters.Select(p => visitor.Visit(p));

    var widgets = ActiveRecord.Widget.Repository().Where(lambda);

    // This is just for reference, see below
    Expression<Func<ActiveRecord.Widget, bool>> referenceLambda = 
        w => w.Id == 0;

    // Here we 'd convert the widgets to instances of DataContract.Widget and
    // return them -- this has nothing to do with the question though.
}
 Results The good news is that lambda is constructed just fine. The bad news is that it isn't working; it's blowing up on me when I try to use it, and the exception messages are really not helpful at all. I have examined the lambda my code produces and a hardcoded lambda with the same expression; they look exactly the same. I spent hours in the debugger trying to find some difference, but I can't. When the predicate is w => w.Id == 0, lambda looks exactly like referenceLambda. But the latter works with e.g. IQueryable<T>.Where, while the former does not; I have tried this in the immediate window of the debugger. I should also mention that when the predicate is w => true, everything works fine. Therefore I am assuming that I 'm not doing enough work in the visitor, but I can't find any more leads to follow. Final Solution After taking into account the correct answers to the problem (two of them below; one short, one with code) the problem was solved; I put the code along with a few important notes in a separate answer to keep this long question from becoming even longer.

@CONTENT:Say I get some JSON back from a service request that looks like this: {
    "message": "We&#39;re unable to complete your request at this time."
}
 I'm not sure why that apostraphe is encoded like that (&#39;); all I know is that I want to decode it. Here's one approach using jQuery that popped into my head: function decodeHtml(html) {
    return $('<div>').html(html).text();
}
 That seems (very) hacky, though. What's a better way? Is there a "right" way?
@CODE:{
    "message": "We&#39;re unable to complete your request at this time."
} &#39; function decodeHtml(html) {

@LINK:/questions/6296313/mysql-trigger-after-update-only-if-row-has-changed
@TITLE:MySQL Trigger after update only if row has changed
@CONTENT:Is there any possibility to use an "after update" trigger only in the case the data has been REALLY changed. I know of "NEW and OLD". But when using them I'm only able to compare columns. For example "NEW.count <> OLD.count". But I want something like: run trigger if "NEW <> OLD" An Example: create table foo (a INT, b INT);
create table bar (a INT, b INT);

INSERT INTO foo VALUES(1,1);
INSERT INTO foo VALUES(2,2);
INSERT INTO foo VALUES(3,3);

CREATE TRIGGER ins_sum
    AFTER UPDATE ON foo
    FOR EACH ROW
    INSERT INTO bar VALUES(NEW.a, NEW.b);

UPDATE foo SET b = 3 WHERE a=3;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
Rows matched: 1  Changed: 0  Warnings: 0


select * from bar;
+------+------+
| a    | b    |
+------+------+
|    3 |    3 |
+------+------+
 The point is, there was an update, but nothing has changed. But the trigger ran anyway. IMHO there should be a way it doesn't. I know that I could have used IF NOW.b <> OLD.b for this example. BUT imagine a large table with changing columns. You have to compare every column and if the database changes you have to adjust the trigger. AND it doesn't "feel" good to compare every column of the row hardcoded :) Addition As you can see on the line Rows matched: 1 Changed: 0 Warnings: 0 MySQL knows that the line didn't change. But it doesn't share this knowledge with the trigger. A trigger like "AFTER REAL UPDATE" or something like this would be cool.
@CODE:create table foo (a INT, b INT);
create table bar (a INT, b INT);

INSERT INTO foo VALUES(1,1);
INSERT INTO foo VALUES(2,2);
INSERT INTO foo VALUES(3,3);

CREATE TRIGGER ins_sum
    AFTER UPDATE ON foo
    FOR EACH ROW
    INSERT INTO bar VALUES(NEW.a, NEW.b);

UPDATE foo SET b = 3 WHERE a=3;

@LINK:/questions/1399126/java-util-zip-recreating-directory-structure
@TITLE:java.util.zip - Recreating directory structure
@CONTENT:While trying to zip an archive using the java.util.zip I ran into a lot of problems most of which I solved. Now that I finally get some output I struggle with getting the "right" output. I have an extracted ODT file (directory would be more fitting a description) to which I did some modifications. Now I want to compress that directory as to recreate the ODT file structure. Zipping the directory and renaming it to end with .odt works fine so there should be no problem. The main problem is that I lose the internal structure of the directory. Everything becomes "flat" and I do not seem to find a way to preserve the original multi-layered structure. I would appreciate some help on this as I can not seem to find the problem. Here are the relevant code snippets: ZipOutputStream out = new ZipOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(
    FILEPATH.substring(0, FILEPATH.lastIndexOf(SEPARATOR) + 1).concat("test.zip")));
    compressDirectory(TEMPARCH, out);
 The SEPARATOR is the system file separator and the FILEPATH is the filepath of the original ODT which I will override but have not done here for testing purposes. I simply write to a test.zip file in the same directory. private void compressDirectory(String directory, ZipOutputStream out) throws IOException
{
    File fileToCompress = new File(directory);
    // list contents.
    String[] contents = fileToCompress.list();
    // iterate through directory and compress files.
    for(int i = 0; i < contents.length; i++)
    {
        File f = new File(directory, contents[i]);
        // testing type. directories and files have to be treated separately.
        if(f.isDirectory())
        {
            // add empty directory
            out.putNextEntry(new ZipEntry(f.getName() + SEPARATOR));
            // initiate recursive call
            compressDirectory(f.getPath(), out);
            // continue the iteration
            continue;
        }else{
             // prepare stream to read file.
             FileInputStream in = new FileInputStream(f);
             // create ZipEntry and add to outputting stream.
             out.putNextEntry(new ZipEntry(f.getName()));
             // write the data.
             int len;
             while((len = in.read(data)) > 0)
             {
                 out.write(data, 0, len);
             }
             out.flush();
             out.closeEntry();
             in.close();
         }
     }
 }
 The directory that contains the files to zip is somewhere in the user space and not in the same directory as the resulting file. I assume this could be trouble but I can not really see how. Also I figured that the problem could be in using the same stream for outputting but again I can not see how. I saw in some examples and tutorials that they use getPath() instead of getName() but changing that gives me an empty zip file.

@CONTENT:The question is, comparing concatination using innerHTML and appending a text node to an existing node. What is happening behind the scene? My thoughs around this so far: I'm guessing both are causing a 'ReFlow'. The later, from what I know, also causes a complete rebuild of the DOM (correct? Are they both doing this?). The former seems to have some other nasty side effects, like causing previously saved references to child nodes to the node I'm modifying innerHTML, to no longer point to 'the current DOM'/'correct version of the child node'. In contrast, when appending children, references seem to stay intact. Why is this? I'm hoping you people can clear this up for me, thanks!

@TITLE:Android 4.2 broke my encrypt/decrypt code and the provided solutions don't work
@CONTENT:First of all, I've already seen Android 4.2 broke my AES encrypt/decrypt code and Encryption error on Android 4.2 and the provided solution: SecureRandom sr = null;
if (android.os.Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= JELLY_BEAN_4_2) {
    sr = SecureRandom.getInstance("SHA1PRNG", "Crypto");
} else {
    sr = SecureRandom.getInstance("SHA1PRNG");
}
 doesn't work for me, because, when decoding data encrypted in Android<4.2 in Android 4.2, I get: javax.crypto.BadPaddingException: pad block corrupted
at com.android.org.bouncycastle.jcajce.provider.symmetric.util.BaseBlockCipher.engineDoFinal(BaseBlockCipher.java:709)
 My code is quite simple, and was working until Android 4.2: public static byte[] encrypt(byte[] data, String seed) throws Exception {

    KeyGenerator keygen = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES");
    SecureRandom secrand = SecureRandom.getInstance("SHA1PRNG");
    secrand.setSeed(seed.getBytes());
    keygen.init(128, secrand);

    SecretKey seckey = keygen.generateKey();
    byte[] rawKey = seckey.getEncoded();

    SecretKeySpec skeySpec = new SecretKeySpec(rawKey, "AES");
    Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES");
    cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, skeySpec);
    return cipher.doFinal(data);
}

public static byte[] decrypt(byte[] data, String seed) throws Exception {

    KeyGenerator keygen = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES");
    SecureRandom secrand = SecureRandom.getInstance("SHA1PRNG");
    secrand.setSeed(seed.getBytes());
    keygen.init(128, secrand);

    SecretKey seckey = keygen.generateKey();
    byte[] rawKey = seckey.getEncoded();

    SecretKeySpec skeySpec = new SecretKeySpec(rawKey, "AES");
    Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES");
    cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, skeySpec);
    return cipher.doFinal(data);
}
 My guess is that the default provider wasn't the only thing that changed in Android 4.2, otherwise my code would work with the proposed solution. My code was based on some post I found here at StackOverflow a long time ago; I see that it differs from the mentioned posts as it just crypts and decrypts byte arrays, whereas the others solutions crypt and decrypt Strings (HEX Strings, I think). Does it have to do with the seed? Does it have a min/max length, restriction of chars, etc? Any idea / solution? EDIT: After a lot of tests, I see that there are 2 problems: The provider changed in Android 4.2 (API 17) -> This one is easy to fix, just apply the solution I mentioned at top of the post BouncyCastle changed from 1.34 to 1.45 in Android 2.2 (API 8)->Android2.3 (API 9), so the decryption problem I previously told is the same as described here: BouncyCastle AES error when upgrading to 1.45 So now the question is: is there any way to recover data crypted in BouncyCastle 1.34 in BouncyCastle 1.45+?

@CONTENT:I'm confused. After stumbling upon this thread, I tried to figure out how to format a countdown timer that had the format hh:mm:ss. Here's my attempt - //hh:mm:ss
String.format("%02d:%02d:%02d", 
    TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS.toHours(millis),

 So, when I try a value like 3600000ms, I get 01:59:00, which is wrong since it should be 01:00:00. Obviously there's something wrong with my logic, but at the moment, I cannot see what it is! Can anyone help? Edit - Fixed it. Here's the right way to format milliseconds to hh:mm:ss format - //hh:mm:ss
String.format("%02d:%02d:%02d", 
    TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS.toHours(millis),
    TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS.toMinutes(millis) -

    TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS.toSeconds(millis) -

 The problem was this TimeUnit.MINUTES.toMinutes(TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS.toHours(millis)). It should have been this TimeUnit.HOURS.toMinutes(TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS.toHours(millis)) instead.
@CODE:hh:mm:ss //hh:mm:ss

@CONTENT:I have a master branch in my project, that I use to pull changes from other people. From that, I usually have several topic branches on which I'm currently working. My question is: Is there a way for me to pull new changes into my master and then rebase ALL of my topic branches onto that at once? This is the situation:         D--E topic1
       /
A--B--C  master

 Now, I know I can accomplish this by rebasing topic1 and topic2 onto master, and I could even write a script to automate this. But what if I have several other branches, create new ones and delete others frequently and I receive upstream changes all the time? This operation (several rebases), when done by hand, is both tiring and error-prone. Is there an easier way? Thanks!

@TITLE:Natural (human alpha-numeric) sort in Microsoft SQL 2005
@CONTENT:We have a large database on which we have DB side pagination. This is quick, returning a page of 50 rows from millions of records in a small fraction of a second. Users can define their own sort, basically choosing what column to sort by. Columns are dynamic - some have numeric values, some dates and some text. While most sort as expected text sorts in a dumb way. Well, I say dumb, it makes sense to computers, but frustrates users. For instance, sorting by a string record id gives something like: rec1
rec10
rec14
rec2
rec20
rec3
rec4
 ...and so on. I want this to take account of the number, so: rec1
rec2
rec3
rec4
rec10
rec14
rec20
 I can't control the input (otherwise I'd just format in leading 000s) and I can't rely on a single format - some are things like "{alpha code}-{dept code}-{rec id}". I know a few ways to do this in C#, but can't pull down all the records to sort them, as that would be to slow. Does anyone know a way to quickly apply a natural sort in Sql server? We're using: ROW_NUMBER() over (order by {field name} asc)
 And then we're paging by that. We can add triggers, although we wouldn't. All their input is parametrised and the like, but I can't change the format - if they put in "rec2" and "rec10" they expect them to be returned just like that, and in natural order. We have valid user input that follows different formats for different clients. One might go rec1, rec2, rec3, ... rec100, rec101 While another might go: grp1rec1, grp1rec2, ... grp20rec300, grp20rec301 When I say we can't control the input I mean that we can't force users to change these standards - they have a value like grp1rec1 and I can't reformat it as grp01rec001, as that would be changing something used for lookups and linking to external systems. These formats vary a lot, but are often mixtures of letters and numbers. Sorting these in C# is easy - just break it up into { "grp", 20, "rec", 301 } and then compare sequence values in turn. However there may be millions of records and the data is paged, I need the sort to be done on the SQL server. SQL server sorts by value, not comparison - in C# I can split the values out to compare, but in SQL I need some logic that (very quickly) gets a single value that consistently sorts. @moebius - your answer might work, but it does feel like an ugly compromise to add a sort-key for all these text values.
@CODE:rec1
rec10
rec14
rec2
rec20

@CONTENT:I am currently trying to set up a WiFi Scan in my Android application that scans for WiFi access points every 30 seconds. I have used Timer and TimerTask to get the scan running correctly at the intervals which I require. However I want to be able to stop and start the scanning when the user presses a button and I am currently having trouble stopping and then restarting the Timer and TimerTask. Here is my code TimerTask scanTask;
final Handler handler = new Handler();
Timer t = new Timer();

public void doWifiScan(){

scanTask = new TimerTask() {
        public void run() {
                handler.post(new Runnable() {
                        public void run() {
                         wifiManager.scan(context); 
                         Log.d("TIMER", "Timer set off");
                        }
               });
        }};


    t.schedule(scanTask, 300, 30000); 

 }

  public void stopScan(){

   if(scanTask!=null){
      Log.d("TIMER", "timer canceled");
      scanTask.cancel();
 }

}
 So the Timer and Task start fine and the scan happens every 30 seconds however I cant get it to stop, I can stop the Timer but the task still occurs and scanTask.cancel() doesn't seem to work either. Is there a better way to do this? Or am I missing something in the Timer/TimerTask classes?

Timer t = new Timer();

I would like to limit the file type of the upload (example: limit to .xls or .xlsx file extensions). Both JavaScript or server-side validation are OK (as long as the server side validation would take place before the files are being uploaded - there could be some very large files uploaded, so any validation needs to take place before the actual files are uploaded).

@TITLE:Using Python Iterparse For Large XML Files
@CONTENT:I need to write a parser in Python that can process some extremely large files ( > 2 GB ) on a computer without much memory (only 2 GB). I wanted to use iterparse in lxml to do it. My file is of the format: <item>
  <title>Item 1</title>
  <desc>Description 1</desc>
</item>
<item>
  <title>Item 2</title>
  <desc>Description 2</desc>
</item>
 and so far my solution is: from lxml import etree

context = etree.iterparse( MYFILE, tag='item' )

for event, elem in context :
      print elem.xpath( 'description/text( )' )

del context
 Unfortunately though, this solution is still eating up a lot of memory. I think the problem is that after dealing with each "ITEM" I need to do something to cleanup empty children. Can anyone offer some suggestions on what I might do after processing my data to properly cleanup?
@CODE:<item>
  <title>Item 1</title>
  <desc>Description 1</desc>
</item>
<item>
  <title>Item 2</title>
  <desc>Description 2</desc>
</item> from lxml import etree

context = etree.iterparse( MYFILE, tag='item' )

for event, elem in context :
      print elem.xpath( 'description/text( )' )

del context

@TITLE:Is there a sophisticated file system monitor for Java which is freeware or open source? [closed]
@CONTENT:I'm looking for a Java library which can notify me about changes on the file system. I found some free libraries, but they all use brute-force detection, i.e. polling in regular intervals. And the other ones are always commercial. What I'm looking for is a library which uses the file monitor functions from the OS, i.e. FindFirstChangeNotification for Win32, FAM for Linux and whatever is available on other OS. I don't mind if brute-force is used as fallback, but for Windows and Linux it should use the available OS features.

@TITLE:CreateProcess from memory buffer
@CONTENT:I can use CreateProcess to launch an EXE. I want to have the contents of an EXE in a memory buffer and do CreateProcess (or an equivalent) on it without having to write it to a file. Is there any way to do that? The backstory : we make games. We send a plain EXE to our distributors, which then wrap it using their favorite DRM and sell it to their users. There have been instances where users find crashes. Most of the crashes take 5 minutes to fix, but the patch must go through the distributor and it may take several days, even weeks. I can't just send the patched EXE to the players because it wouldn't have the distributor's DRM. I'm thinking of distributing the real game EXE inside an encrypted datafile so what gets wrapped (the external EXE) just decrypts and launches the real EXE. This way I could safely distribute a fix without disabling the DRM.

@LINK:/questions/1000183/reliable-file-renameto-alternative-on-windows
@TITLE:Reliable File.renameTo() alternative on Windows?
@CONTENT:Java's File.renameTo() is problematic, especially on Windows, it seems. As the API documentation says, Many aspects of the behavior of this method are inherently platform-dependent: The rename operation might not be able to move a file from one filesystem to another, it might not be atomic, and it might not succeed if a file with the destination abstract pathname already exists. The return value should always be checked to make sure that the rename operation was successful. In my case, as part of an upgrade procedure, I need to move (rename) a directory that may contain gigabytes of data (lots of subdirectories and files of varying sizes). The move is always done within the same partition/drive, so there's no real need to physically move all the files on disk. There shouldn't be any file locks to the contents of the dir to be moved, but still, quite often, renameTo() fails to do its job and returns false. (I'm just guessing that perhaps some file locks expire somewhat arbitrarily on Windows.) Currently I have a fallback method that uses copying & deleting, but this sucks because it may take a lot of time, depending on the size of the folder. I'm also considering simply documenting the fact that the user can move the folder manually to avoid waiting for hours, potentially. But the Right Way would obviously be something automatic and quick. So my question is, do you know an alternative, reliable approach to do a quick move/rename with Java on Windows, either with plain JDK or some external library. Or if you know an easy way to detect and release any file locks for a given folder and all of its contents (possibly thousands of individual files), that would be fine too. Edit: In this particular case, it seems we got away using just renameTo() by taking a few more things into account; see this answer.

@TITLE:ASP.NET MVC - How exactly to use View Models
@CONTENT:Let's say I have a page that allows the editing of a user's details, so I have a ViewModel like this: public class UserViewModel {
    public string Username { get; set; }
    public string Password { get; set; }
    public int ManagerId { get; set; }
    public string Category { get; set; }
}
 So on my EditUser action I can have this passed back by the model binder and then I can map that to the Domain Model: public ActionResult EditUser(UserViewModel user) {
    ...
 However, the page that displays the form also needs details such as a list of Managers and Categories to provide dropdowns for those fields. It might also display a list of other users in a sidebar so you can switch between the different users you're editing. So then I have another view model: public class ViewUserViewModel {
    public UserViewModel EditingUser { get; set; }
    public IEnumerable<SelectListItem> Managers { get; set; }
    public IEnumerable<SelectListItem> Categories { get; set; }
    public IEnumerable<SelectListItem> AllUsers { get; set; }
}
 Is this the correct way to do it? Are they both View Models? If so, is there a naming convention I should use so I can distinguish between VMs that are like models and VMs that just contain data for the page? Have I got this all wrong?
@CODE:public class UserViewModel {
    public string Username { get; set; }

    xmlHttp.send("");

@TITLE:Spring MVC UTF-8 Encoding
@CONTENT:At the moment I'm trying to get started with Spring MVC. While trying things out I ran into an encoding issue. I want to display UTF-8 characters on my JSP-Pages so I added a String with UTF-8 characters to my ModelAndView. It looks like this: @Controller
public class HomeController {

    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(HomeController.class);

    @RequestMapping(value="/", method=RequestMethod.GET)
    public ModelAndView home() {
        logger.info("Welcome home!");
        return new ModelAndView("home", "utftest", "?lm");
    }

}
 On the JSP page I just want to display the String with UTF-8 characters like this: <%@ page language="java" pageEncoding="UTF-8"%>
<%@ page contentType="text/html;charset=UTF-8" %>
<%@ taglib uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core" prefix="c" %>
<%@ page session="false" %>
<html>
<head>
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">

<body>
    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p><c:out value="?" /></p>
    <p><c:out value="${utftest}"></c:out></p>
</body>
</html>
 As result I get following: Hello world!

?

¡Ô?lm
 Note that following code <c:out value="?" /> was displayed without encoding error. I also set the default encoding to UTF-8 in Springsource Tool Suite but I'm still getting wrong characters. Edit: Maybe I should have mentioned that I'm using a Mac with OS X 10.6. For Spring development I use the Springsource Tool Suite from Spring (http://www.springsource.com/developer/sts). Hope this helps to find out what is wrong with my setting. Edit 2: Thanks to McDwell, I just tried out using "\u00f6lm" instead of "?lm" in my controller and the encoding issue on the JSP page is gone. Does that mean my .java files are encoded with wrong character set? Where can I change this in Eclipse? Thank you.

@TITLE:Get computed font size for DOM element in JS
@CONTENT:Is it possible to detect the computed font-size of a DOM element, taking into consideration generic settings made elsewhere (In the body tag for example), inherited values, and so on? A framework-independent approach would be nice, as I'm working on a script that should work standalone, but that is not a requirement of course. Background: I'm trying to tweak CKEditor's font selector plugin (source here) so that it always shows the font size of the current cursor position (as opposed to only when within a span that has an explicit font-size set, which is the current behaviour).

@TITLE:Javascript KeyCode vs CharCode = Utter Confusion
@CONTENT:The problem: Limit allowed characters in a HTML input to a-z A-Z only. For business requirements this needs to be done on KeyPress so that the character simply isnt allowed to even appear in the input. Tab, enter, arrows, backspace, shift are all allowed. The user must be able to freely move in and out of the textbox, delete characters etc etc. This is the starting point of my code... var keyCode = (e.keyCode ? e.keyCode : e.which);
 However every value that I get in keyCode doesnt correspond to any of the character charts I have seen on the web. For example the character "h" gives me a return code of 104. Is KeyCode different to CharCode? Which code contains the control characters? Do I need to convert? How can I restrict the input to a-z A-Z and allow the keys I need in javascript? Many thanks.

@CONTENT:I've used the voice recognition feature on Android and I love it. It's one of my customers' most praised features. However, the format is somewhat restrictive. You have to call the recognizer intent, have it send the recording for transcription to google, and wait for the text back. Some of my ideas would require recording the audio within my app and then sending the clip to google for transcription. Is there any way I can send an audio clip to be processed with speech to text?

@LINK:/questions/4223977/send-file-via-curl-from-form-post-in-php
@TITLE:Send file via cURL from form POST in PHP
@CONTENT:I'm writing an API and I'm wanting to handle file uploads from a form POST. The markup for the form is nothing too complex: <form action="" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  <fieldset>
    <input type="file" name="image" id="image" />
    <input type="submit" name="upload" value="Upload" />
  </fieldset>
</form>
 However, I'm having difficulties understanding how to handle this server-side and send along with a cURL request. I'm familiar with sending POST requests with cURL with a data array, and resources I've read on uploading files tell me to prefix the filename with an @ symbol. But these same resources have a hard-coded file name, e.g. $post = array(
    'image' => '@/path/to/myfile.jpg',
    ...
);
 Well which file path is this? Where would I find it? Would it be something like $_FILES['image']['tmp_name'], in which case my $post array should look like this: $post = array(
    'image' => '@' . $_FILES['image']['tmp_name'],
    ...
);
 Or am I going about this the wrong way? Any advice would be most appreciated. EDIT: If someone could give me a code snippet of where I would go with the following code snippets then I'd be most grateful. I'm mainly after what I would send as cURL parameters, and a sample of how to use those parameters with the receiving script (let's call it curl_receiver.php for argument's sake). I have this web form: <form action="script.php" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  <fieldset>
    <input type="file" name="image />
    <input type="submit" name="upload" value="Upload" />
  </fieldset>
</form>
 And this would be script.php: if (isset($_POST['upload'])) {
    // cURL call would go here
    // my tmp. file would be $_FILES['image']['tmp_name'], and
    // the filename would be $_FILES['image']['name']
}
@CODE:POST <form action="" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  <fieldset>
    <input type="file" name="image" id="image" />
    <input type="submit" name="upload" value="Upload" />
  </fieldset>
</form> POST @ $post = array(
    'image' => '@/path/to/myfile.jpg',
    ...
); $_FILES['image']['tmp_name'] $post $post = array(
    'image' => '@' . $_FILES['image']['tmp_name'],
    ...
); curl_receiver.php <form action="script.php" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  <fieldset>
    <input type="file" name="image />
    <input type="submit" name="upload" value="Upload" />

</form> script.php if (isset($_POST['upload'])) {

@CONTENT:I would like Visual Studio to break when a handled exception happens (i.e. I don't just want to see a "First chance" message, I want to debug the actual exception). e.g. I want the debugger to break at the exception: try
{
   System.IO.File.Delete(someFilename);
}
catch (Exception)
{
   //we really don't care at runtime if the file couldn't be deleted
}
 I came across these notes for Visual Studio.NET: 1) In VS.NET go to the Debug Menu >> "Exceptions..." >> "Common Language Runtime Exceptions" >> "System" and select "System.NullReferenceException" 2) In the bottom of that dialog there is a "When the exception is thrown:" group box, select "Break into the debugger" 3) Run your scenario. When the exception is thrown, the debugger will stop and notify you with a dialog that says something like: "An exception of type "System.NullReferenceException" has been thrown. [Break] [Continue]" Hit [Break]. This will put you on the line of code that's causing the problem. But they do not apply to Visual Studio 2005 (there is no Exceptions option on the Debug menu). Does anyone know where the find this options dialog in Visual Studio that the "When the exception is thrown" group box, with the option to "Break into the debugger"? Update: The problem was that my Debug menu didn't have an Exceptions item. I customized the menu to manually add it.

{
   System.IO.File.Delete(someFilename);

@TITLE:WCF named pipe minimal example
@CONTENT:I'm looking for minimal example of WCF Named Pipes (I expect two minimal applications, server and client, which can communicate via a named pipe.) Microsoft has the briliant article Getting Started Tutorial that describes WCF via HTTP, and I'm looking for something similar about WCF and named pipes. I've found several posts in the Internet, but they are a little bit "advanced". I need something minimal, only mandatory functionality, so I can add my code and get the application working. How do I replace that to use a named pipe? <endpoint address="http://localhost:8000/ServiceModelSamples/Service/CalculatorService"
    binding="wsHttpBinding" bindingConfiguration="WSHttpBinding_ICalculator"
    contract="ICalculator" name="WSHttpBinding_ICalculator">
    <identity>
        <userPrincipalName value="OlegPc\Oleg" />
    </identity>
</endpoint>
 How do I replace that to use a named pipe? // Step 1 of the address configuration procedure: Create a URI to serve as the base address.
Uri baseAddress = new Uri("http://localhost:8000/ServiceModelSamples/Service");

// Step 2 of the hosting procedure: Create ServiceHost
ServiceHost selfHost = new ServiceHost(typeof(CalculatorService), baseAddress);

try
{
    // Step 3 of the hosting procedure: Add a service endpoint.
    selfHost.AddServiceEndpoint(
        typeof(ICalculator),
        new WSHttpBinding(),
        "CalculatorService");

    // Step 4 of the hosting procedure: Enable metadata exchange.
    ServiceMetadataBehavior smb = new ServiceMetadataBehavior();
    smb.HttpGetEnabled = true;
    selfHost.Description.Behaviors.Add(smb);

    // Step 5 of the hosting procedure: Start (and then stop) the service.
    selfHost.Open();
    Console.WriteLine("The service is ready.");
    Console.WriteLine("Press <ENTER> to terminate service.");
    Console.WriteLine();
    Console.ReadLine();

    // Close the ServiceHostBase to shutdown the service.

@TITLE:Does Java casting introduce overhead? Why?
@CONTENT:Is there any overhead when we cast objects of one type to another? Or the compiler just resolves everything and there is no cost at run time? Is this a general things, or there are different cases? For example, suppose we have an array of Object[], where each element might have a different type. But we always know for sure that, say, element 0 is a Double, element 1 is a String. (I know this is a wrong design, but let's just assume I had to do this.) Is Java's type information still kept around at run time? Or everything is forgotten after compilation, and if we do (Double)elements[0], we'll just follow the pointer and interpret those 8 bytes as a double, whatever that is? I'm very unclear about how types are done in Java. If you have any reccommendation on books or article then thanks, too.

@TITLE:How to get timestamp of tick precision in .NET / C#?
@CONTENT:Up until now I used DateTime.Now for getting timestamps, but I noticed that if you print DateTime.Now in a loop you will see that it increments in descrete jumps of approx. 15 ms. But for certain scenarios in my application I need to get the most accurate timestamp possible, preferably with tick (=100 ns) precision. Any ideas? Update: Apparently, StopWatch / QueryPerformanceCounter is the way to go, but it can only be used to measure time, so I was thinking about calling DateTime.Now when the application starts up and then just have StopWatch run and then just add the elapsed time from StopWatch to the initial value returned from DateTime.Now. At least that should give me accurate relative timestamps, right? What do you think about that (hack)? NOTE: StopWatch.ElapsedTicks is different from StopWatch.Elapsed.Ticks! I used the former assuming 1 tick = 100 ns, but in this case 1 tick = 1 / StopWatch.Frequency. So to get ticks equivalent to DateTime use StopWatch.Elapsed.Ticks. I just learned this the hard way. NOTE 2: Using the StopWatch approach, I noticed it gets out of sync with the real time. After about 10 hours, it was ahead by 5 seconds. So I guess one would have to resync it every X or so where X could be 1 hour, 30 min, 15 min, etc. I am not sure what the optimal timespan for resyncing would be since every resync will change the offset which can be up to 20 ms.

@TITLE:Browser-independent way to detect when image has been loaded
@CONTENT:In IE, you can onreadystatechange. There's onload, but I read scary things. jQuery wraps up the DOM's load event quite nicely with "ready". It seems likely I am just ignorant of another nice library's implementation of image loading. The context is that I am generating images dynamically (via server callbacks) that can take some time download. In my IE-only code I set the src of the img element, then when the onreadystatechange event fires with the "complete" status, I add it to the DOM so the user sees it. I'd be happy with a "native" JavaScript solution, or a pointer to a library that does the work. There's so many libraries out there and I'm sure this is a case of me just not knowing about the right one. That said, we're already jQuery users, so I'm not eager to add a very large library just to get this functionality.

@TITLE:Why should I not use ¡§if Assigned()¡¨ before using or freeing things?
@CONTENT:This question is a continuance of a particular comment from people on stackoverflow which I've seen a few different times now. I, along with the developer who taught me Delphi, in order to keep things safe, have always put a check if assigned() before freeing objects, and before doing other various things. However, I'm now told that I should not be adding this check. I'd like to know if there is any difference in how the application compiles/runs if I do this, or if it won't affect the result at all... if assigned(SomeObject) then SomeObject.Free;
 Let's say I have a form, and I'm creating a bitmap object in the background upon the form's creation, and freeing it when I'm done with it. Now I guess my problem is I got too used to putting this check on a lot of my code when I'm trying to access objects which might potentially have been free'd at some point. I've been using it even when it's not necessary. I like to be thorough... unit Unit1;

begin
  if assigned(FBitmap) then begin //<-----
    //Do some routine to close file
    FBitmap.Free;
  end;
end;

function TForm1.LoadBitmap(const Filename: String): Bool;
var
  EM: String;
  function CheckFile: Bool;
  begin
    Result:= False;
    //Check validity of file, return True if valid bitmap, etc.
  end;
begin
  Result:= False;
  EM:= '';
  if assigned(FBitmap) then begin //<-----
    if FileExists(Filename) then begin
      if CheckFile then begin
        try
          FBitmap.LoadFromFile(Filename);
        except
          on e: exception do begin
            EM:= EM + 'Failure loading bitmap: ' + e.Message + #10;
          end;
        end;
      end else begin
        EM:= EM + 'Specified file is not a valid bitmap.' + #10;
      end;
    end else begin
      EM:= EM + 'Specified filename does not exist.' + #10;
    end;
  end else begin
    EM:= EM + 'Bitmap object is not assigned.' + #10;
  end;
  if EM <> '' then begin
    raise Exception.Create('Failed to load bitmap: ' + #10 + EM);
  end;
end;

end.
 Now let's say I'm introducing a new custom list object called TMyList of TMyListItem. For each item in this list, of course I have to create/free each item object. There's a few different ways of creating an item, as well as a few different ways of destroying an item (Add/Delete being the most common). I'm sure it's a very good practice to put this protection here... procedure TMyList.Delete(const Index: Integer);
var
  I: TMyListItem;
begin
  if (Index >= 0) and (Index < FItems.Count) then begin
    I:= TMyListItem(FItems.Objects[Index]);
    if assigned(I) then begin //<-----
      if I <> nil then begin
        I.DoSomethingBeforeFreeing('Some Param');
        I.Free;
      end;
    end;
    FItems.Delete(Index);
  end else begin
    raise Exception.Create('My object index out of bounds ('+IntToStr(Index)+')');
  end;
end;
 In many scenarios, at least I would hope that the object is still created before I try to free it. But you never know what slips might happen in the future where an object gets free'd before it's supposed to. I've always used this check, but now I'm being told I shouldn't, and I still don't understand why. EDIT Here's an example to try to explain to you why I have a habit of doing this: procedure TForm1.FormDestroy(Sender: TObject);
begin
  SomeCreatedObject.Free;
  if SomeCreatedObject = nil then
    ShowMessage('Object is nil')
  else
    ShowMessage('Object is not nil');
end;
 My point is that if SomeCreatedObject <> nil is not the same as if Assigned(SomeCreatedObject) because after freeing SomeCreatedObject, it does not evaluate to nil. So both checks should be necessary.

To be explicit, this is when google adds an outline relating to the search query. If you were to search for a town, a post code, or a zip code, Google will highlight this region of the map. Example: This was apparently not available via the API, and only through Google's own web properties. Recently, I noticed some other domains using this functionality, for example on Twitter. Is there a seperate API Twitter and other large organisations are using? Has this functionality been added, but is as yet undocumented?

@CONTENT:I'm working on a site with multiple subdomains, some of which should get their own session. I think I've got it worked out, but have noticed something about cookie handling that I don't understand. I don't see anything in the docs that explains it, so thought I would see if anyone here has some light to shed on the question. If I just do: session_start();
 I end up with a session cookie like this: subdomain.example.net However, if I make any attempt to set the cookie domain myself, either like ini_set('session.cookie_domain', 'subdomain.example.net');
 or like session_set_cookie_params( 0, "/", "subdomain.example.net", false, false);
 I end up with a cookie for .subdomain.example.net (note the opening dot), which I believe means "match all subdomains (or in this case sub-subdomains). This seems to happen with all my cookies actually, not just session. If I set the cookie domain myself, it automatically has the dot prepended, meaning this domain and all subs of it. If I don't set the domain, then it gets it right by using only the current domain. Any idea what causes this, and what I can do to control that prepending dot? Thanks!

@TITLE:Can't get sql server compact 3.5 / 4 to work with ASP .NET MVC 2
@CONTENT:I'm using Visual Studio 2008 Pro. I'm probably missing something very obvious here, but I've been trying to get the CTP for Sql Server compact 4 to work in my asp.net mvc application. I can find next to no instruction on how to set this up or a working example application. My goal is a private install so I can just include it in my web app without having to do sql server setup on my domain hosting. This is really just me shooting the breeze and trying to figure this out. I don't plan to host a market or anything with this. So, I've copied all the dll's that install in the base 4.0 direction (c:\Program Files\Sql Server compact\v4.0) to a lib folder in my application. I've set the copy to output direction option to 'Copy if Newer'. I then reference the System.Data.SqlServerCE dll and set 'Copy Local' to True. I created an sdf file via Sql Studio Express. An important note is that I did not see an option for creating a CE 4.0 version of this file, so it was created using CE 3.5. I create a few tables, add a few rows to those tables, copy the *.sdf file to my App_Data directory. It's worth mentioning that, from inside VS 2008, this file never appears in my project, but it does exist in the physical location of the App_Data directory. I'm not sure why this is. Next, I just try making a basic connection to my sdf file via: SqlCeConnection conn = new SqlCeConnection("DataSource=rpg.sdf");
 This yields the error below: Unable to load the native components of SQL Server Compact corresponding to the ADO.NET provider of version 8402. Install the correct version of SQL Server Compact. Refer to KB article 974247 for more details.
 I figure from here, I'd just try getting Sql CE 3.5 to work. I upgrade my local installation of Sql CE 3.5 to sp2. I copy the dlls at the base location (c:\Program Files\Sql Server compact\v3.5), including removing and readding the version of the System.Data.SqlServerCE dll from my project references. The curious thing here is when I right click and look at the properties of the referenced SqlServerCE dll, it always says it's version 4.0.0.1. Guys, I really could use some direction here. I have searched stack overflow, the help docs, books online, and googled. I really haven't found anything that takes this from the very top for either CE 3.5 or 4.0 and tells me exactly what dll's to add, where to put them, how to reference them, how to add the .sdf file to my project, connect to it, and query from it. I did come across a few mentions of an IBuySpy portal sample app that was supposed to use Sql CE 3.5, but can't actually navigate the msdn download maze to get to it. Ideally, I want to setup a private deploy for CE 4.0. I'm all ears. Suggestions, points, whatever would be highly appreciated. Thank you! YES I DID SEE THE KB. IT DIDN'T HELP See it here: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/974247 RESULTS FROM CORFLAG Okay, tried that and these are my results: C:\Development\Mvc2MessingAround\Mvc2MessingAround\bin\Lib>corflags System.Data.

@CONTENT:I've got several elements on a HTML page which have the same class - but they're different element types. I want to find out the tag name of the element as I loop over them - but .attr doesn't take "tag" or "tagname". Here's what I mean. Consider these elements on a page: <h1 class="rnd">First</h1>
<h2 id="foo" class="rnd">Second</h2>
<h3 class="rnd">Third</h3>
<h4 id="bar" class="rnd">Fourth</h4>
 Now I want to run something like this to ensure that my elements all have an id if one wasn't already defined: $(function() {
  $(".rnd").each(function(i) {
    var id = $(this).attr("id");
    if (id === undefined || id.length === 0) {

      // .attr("tag") returns undefined
      $(this).attr("id", "rnd" + $(this).attr("tag") + "_" + i.toString());
    }
  });

rndh4_3

@TITLE:remove_if equivalent for std::map
@CONTENT:I was trying to erase a range of elements from map based on particular condition. How do I do it using STL algorithms? Initially I thought of using remove_if but it is not possible as remove_if does not work for associative container. Is there any "remove_if" equivalent algorithm which works for map ? As a simple option, I thought of looping through the map and erase. But is looping through the map and erasing a safe option?(as iterators get invalid after erase) I used following example: bool predicate(const std::pair<int,std::string>& x)
{
    return x.first > 2;
}

int main(void)

    std::map<int, std::string> aMap;

    aMap[4] = "four";
    aMap[5] = "five";
    aMap[6] = "six";

//      does not work, an error
//  std::remove_if(aMap.begin(), aMap.end(), predicate);

    std::map<int, std::string>::iterator iter = aMap.begin();
    std::map<int, std::string>::iterator endIter = aMap.end();

@TITLE:Best Practice: Access form elements by HTML id or name attribute?
@CONTENT:As any seasoned JavaScript developer knows, there are many (too many) ways to do the same thing. For example, say you have a text field as follows: <form name="myForm">  
    <input type="text" name="foo" id="foo" />
 There are many way to access this in JavaScript: [1]  document.forms[0].elements[0];
[2]  document.myForm.foo;
[3]  document.getElementById('foo');
[4]  document.getElementById('myForm').foo;
     ... and so on ...
 Methods [1] and [3] are well documented in the Mozilla Gecko documentation, but neither are ideal. [1] is just too general to be useful and [3] requires both an id and a name (assuming you will be posting the data to a server side language). Ideally, it would be best to have only an id attribute or a name attribute (having both is somewhat redundant, especially if the id isn't necessary for any css, and increases the likelihood of typos, etc). [2] seems to be the most intuitive and it seems to be widely used, but I haven't seen it referenced in the Gecko documentation and I'm worried about both forwards compatibility and cross browser compatiblity (and of course I want to be as standards compliant as possible). So what's best practice here? Can anyone point to something in the DOM documentation or W3C specification that could resolve this? Note I am specifically interested in a non-library solution (jQuery/Prototype).
@CODE:<form name="myForm">  
    <input type="text" name="foo" id="foo" /> [1]  document.forms[0].elements[0];
[2]  document.myForm.foo;

@CONTENT:I had to write a routine that increments the value of a variable by 1 if its type is number and assigns 0 to the variable if not, where the variable is initially null or undefined. The first implementation was v >= 0 ? v += 1 : v = 0 because I thought anything not a number would make an arithmetic expression false, but it was wrong since null >= 0 is evaluated to true. Then I learned null behaves like 0 and the following expressions are all evaluated to true. null >= 0 && null <= 0 !(null < 0 || null > 0) null + 1 === 1 1 / null === Infinity Math.pow(42, null) === 1 Of course, null is not 0. null == 0 is evaluated to false. This makes the seemingly tautological expression (v >= 0 && v <= 0) === (v == 0) false. Why is null like 0, although it is not actually 0?

 Using the new permit method, I've got: params.require(:measurement).permit(:name, :groundtruth)
 This throws no errors, but the created database entry contains null instead of the groundtruth value. If I just set: params.require(:measurement).permit!
 Everything get's saved as expected, but of course, this kills the security provided by strong parameters. I've found solutions, how to permit arrays, but not a single example using nested objects. This must be possible somehow, since it should be a pretty common use case. So, how does it work?

@TITLE:Get first day of week in SQL Server
@CONTENT:I am trying to group records by week, storing the aggregated date as the first day of the week. However, the standard technique I use for rounding off dates does not appear to work correctly with weeks (though it does for days, months, years, quarters and any other timeframe I've applied it to). Here is the SQL: select "start_of_week" = dateadd(week, datediff(week, 0, getdate()), 0);
 This returns 2011-08-22 00:00:00.000, which is a Monday, not a Sunday. Selecting @@datefirst returns 7, which is the code for Sunday, so the server is setup correctly in as far as I know. I can bypass this easily enough by changing the above code to: select "start_of_week" = dateadd(week, datediff(week, 0, getdate()), -1);
 But the fact that I have to make such an exception makes me a little uneasy. Also, apologies if this is a duplicate question. I found some related questions but none that addressed this aspect specifically.

@CONTENT:In trying to improve the speed of an immensely slow query (several minutes on two tables with only ~50,000 rows each, on SQL Server 2008 if it matters), I narrowed down the problem to an OR in my inner join, as in: SELECT mt.ID, mt.ParentID, ot.MasterID

  INNER JOIN dbo.OtherTable AS ot ON ot.ParentID = mt.ID
                                  OR ot.ID = mt.ParentID

@CONTENT:Does anyone know what would be the best way to detect which version of Office is installed? Plus, if there are multiple versions of Office installed, I'd like to know what versions they are. A bonus would be if I can detect the specific version(s) of Excel that is(/are) installed.

@CONTENT:I have just found out that my script gives me a fatal error: Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 268435456 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 440 bytes) in C:\process_txt.php on line 109
 That line is this: $lines = count(file($path)) - 1;
 So I think it is having difficulty loading the file into memeory and counting the number of lines, is there a more efficient way I can do this without having memory issues? The text files that I need to count the number of lines for range from 2MB to 500MB. Maybe a Gig sometimes. Thanks all for any help.

@TITLE:ORM Entities vs. Domain Entities under Entity Framework 6.0
@CONTENT:I stumbled upon the following two articles First and Second in which the author states in summary that ORM Entities and Domain Entities shouldn't be mixed up. I faced exactly this problem at the moment as I code with EF 6.0 following the Code First approach. I use the POCO classes as entities in the EF as well as my domain/business objects. But I find myself frequently in the situation where I define a property as public or a navigation property as virtual only because the EF Framework forces me to do so. But I don't know what to take as the bottom line of the two articles? Should I really create for example a CustomerEF class for the entity framework and a CustomerD for my domain. Then create a repository which consumes CustomerD maps it to CustomerEF do some queries and than maps back the received CustomerEF to CustomerD. I thought EF is all about mapping my domain entities to the data. So please give me some advise. Do I overlook an important thing the EF is able to provide me with? Or is this a problem which can not completely solved by the EF? But in the latter case what is a good way to manage this problem?

@TITLE:Adjusting HttpWebRequest Connection Timeout in C#
@CONTENT:I believe after lengthy research and searching, I have discovered that what I want to do is probably better served by setting up an asynchronous connection and terminating it after the desired timeout... But I will go ahead and ask anyway! Quick snippet of code: HttpWebRequest webReq = (HttpWebRequest)HttpWebRequest.Create(url);
webReq.Timeout = 5000;
HttpWebResponse response = (HttpWebResponse)webReq.GetResponse(); 
// this takes ~20+ sec on servers that aren't on the proper port, etc.
 I have an HttpWebRequest method that is in a multi-threaded application, in which I am connecting to a large number of company web servers. In cases where the server is not responding, the HttpWebRequest.GetResponse() is taking about 20 seconds to time out, even though I have specified a timeout of only 5 seconds. In the interest of getting through the servers on a regular interval, I want to skip those taking longer than 5 seconds to connect to. So the question is: "Is there a simple way to specify/decrease a connection timeout for a WebRequest or HttpWebRequest?"
@CODE:HttpWebRequest webReq = (HttpWebRequest)HttpWebRequest.Create(url);
webReq.Timeout = 5000;
HttpWebResponse response = (HttpWebResponse)webReq.GetResponse();

@CONTENT:I have a text file that is in a comma separated format, delimited by " on most fields. I am trying to get that into something I can enumerate through (Generic Collection, for example). I don't have control over how the file is output nor the character it uses for the delimiter. In this case, the fields are separated by a comma and text fields are enclosed in " marks. The problem I am running into is that some fields have quotation marks in them (i.e. 8" Tray) and are accidentally being picked up as the next field. In the case of numeric fields, they don't have quotes around them, but they do start with a + or a - sign (depicting a positive/negative number). I was thinking of a RegEx, but my skills aren't that great so hopefully someone can come up with some ideas I can try. There are about 19,000 records in this file, so I am trying to do it as efficiently as possible. Here are a couple of example rows of data: "00","000000112260 ","Pie Pumpkin ","RET","6.99 "," ","ea ",+0000000006.99000 "00","000000304078 ","Pie Apple caramel ","RET","9.99 "," ","ea ",+0000000009.99000 "00","StringValue here","8" Tray of Food ","RET","6.99 "," ","ea ",-00000000005.3200 There are a lot more fields, but you can get the picture.... I am using VB.NET and I have a generic List setup to accept the data. I have tried using CSVReader and it seems to work well until you hit a record like the 3rd one (with a quote in the text field). If I could somehow get it to handle the additional quotes, than the CSVReader option will work great. Thanks!

@TITLE:Logging, Aspect Oriented Programming, and Dependency Injection - Trying to make sense of it all
@CONTENT:I know that logging is a prime use case for AOP. Additionally logging wrappers are also exemplified as cases when you want to use DI so that classes aren't coupled with a specific logging implementation. However, some consider logging wrappers an anti-pattern. Primarily, such a view is because in most cases the wrapper tends to be simplistic and removes many of the features specific of the logging framework. If you implement those specific features, why not just use the framework directly. I am aware of the Common.Logging facade that attempts to abstract a good amount of the features of log4Net, EntLib, NLog for you. However, even here we still have a dependency of sorts on Common.Logging. Not in a code/unit testing way regarding interfaces and such, but if the project dies (it's been over a year since the last release) or you want to latter switch to a logger not supported, that can cause problems. That said, if logging is achieved via AOP, is it even necessary to use DI for the logging dependency (i.e. why not just directly reference say NLog)? Yes that AOP portion of code would be tightly coupled, but the logic of the classes that one wants to unit test is devoid of logging dependencies (at least before the weaving happens). It's at this point that I'm a bit lost (I haven't tried AOP yet). After weaving, would having not used DI for the AOP code cause problems for unit testing the method under test? Or can one unit test without weaving the AOP code? Unless logging is a requirement of the user of the software, I'm not sure how useful it is to test that logging has occured with mocks. I would think that the business logic of the method under test is what most would be interested in testing. Lastly, if one wants to use TDD/BDD, wouldn't one have to use DI for the logging dependencies in the AOP code? Or would one just not test drive the AOP side of things? As you can see, I'm trying to get a feel for what the most practical approach is for developing an application that would be using both AOP for cross-cutting-concerns and DI for design/testing. Since AOP is relatively new, and logging is the most common example, what is the recommended approach?

@TITLE:Adding an image within a circle object in d3 javascript?
@CONTENT:My goal is to add an image into an existing circle with d3. The circle will render and is interactive with mouseover method, but only when I use "fill", "color", and not something more sophisticated like .append("image").       g.append("circle")
         .attr("class", "logo")
         .attr("cx", 700)
         .attr("cy", 300)
         .attr("r", 10)
         .attr("fill", "black")       // this code works OK
         .attr("stroke", "white")     // displays small black dot
         .attr("stroke-width", 0.25)
         .on("mouseover", function(){ // when I use .style("fill", "red") here, it works

 The image doesn't show after I mouse over. Using Ruby on Rails app, where my image "logo.jpeg" is stored in the assets/images/ directory. Any help for getting my logo to show within the circle? Thanks.

@LINK:/questions/12865848/general-purpose-fromevent-method
@TITLE:General purpose FromEvent method
@CONTENT:Using the new async/await model it's fairly straightforward to generate a Task that is completed when an event fires; you just need to follow this pattern: public class MyClass
{
    public event Action OnCompletion;
}

public static Task FromEvent(MyClass obj)
{
    TaskCompletionSource<object> tcs = new TaskCompletionSource<object>();

    obj.OnCompletion += () =>
        {
            tcs.SetResult(null);
        };

    return tcs.Task;
}
 This then allows: await FromEvent(new MyClass());
 The problem is that you need to create a new FromEvent method for every event in every class that you would like to await on. That could get really large really quick, and it's mostly just boilerplate code anyway. Ideally I would like to be able to do something like this: await FromEvent(new MyClass().OnCompletion);
 Then I could re-use the same FromEvent method for any event on any instance. I've spent some time trying to create such a method, and there are a number of snags. For the code above it will generate the following error: The event 'Namespace.MyClass.OnCompletion' can only appear on the left hand side of += or -= As far as I can tell, there won't ever be a way of passing the event like this through code. So, the next best thing seemed to be trying to pass the event name as a string: await FromEvent(new MyClass(), "OnCompletion");
 It's not as ideal; you don't get intellisense and would get a runtime error if the event doesn't exist for that type, but it could still be more useful than tons of FromEvent methods. So it's easy enough to use reflection and GetEvent(eventName) to get the EventInfo object. The next problem is that the delegate of that event isn't known (and needs to be able to vary) at runtime. That makes adding an event handler hard, because we need to dynamically create a method at runtime, matching a given signature (but ignoring all parameters) that accesses a TaskCompletionSource that we already have and sets its result. Fortunately I found this link which contains instructions on how to do [almost] exactly that via Reflection.Emit. Now the problem is that we need to emit IL, and I have no idea how to access the tcs instance that I have. Below is the progress that I've made towards finishing this: public static Task FromEvent<T>(this T obj, string eventName)
{
    var tcs = new TaskCompletionSource<object>();
    var eventInfo = obj.GetType().GetEvent(eventName);

    Type eventDelegate = eventInfo.EventHandlerType;

    Type[] parameterTypes = GetDelegateParameterTypes(eventDelegate);
    DynamicMethod handler = new DynamicMethod("unnamed", null, parameterTypes);

    ILGenerator ilgen = handler.GetILGenerator();

    //TODO ilgen.Emit calls go here

    Delegate dEmitted = handler.CreateDelegate(eventDelegate);

    eventInfo.AddEventHandler(obj, dEmitted);

    return tcs.Task;
}
 What IL could I possibly emit that would allow me to set the result of the TaskCompletionSource? Or, alternatively, is there another approach to creating a method that returns a Task for any arbitrary event from an arbitrary type?
@CODE:Task public class MyClass
{
    public event Action OnCompletion;
}

public static Task FromEvent(MyClass obj)
{
    TaskCompletionSource<object> tcs = new TaskCompletionSource<object>();

    obj.OnCompletion += () =>
        {
            tcs.SetResult(null);
        };

    return tcs.Task;
} await FromEvent(new MyClass()); FromEvent await await FromEvent(new MyClass().OnCompletion); FromEvent await FromEvent(new MyClass(), "OnCompletion"); GetEvent(eventName) EventInfo TaskCompletionSource Reflection.Emit tcs public static Task FromEvent<T>(this T obj, string eventName)
{
    var tcs = new TaskCompletionSource<object>();
    var eventInfo = obj.GetType().GetEvent(eventName);

    Type eventDelegate = eventInfo.EventHandlerType;

    Type[] parameterTypes = GetDelegateParameterTypes(eventDelegate);
    DynamicMethod handler = new DynamicMethod("unnamed", null, parameterTypes);

    ILGenerator ilgen = handler.GetILGenerator();

    //TODO ilgen.Emit calls go here

    Delegate dEmitted = handler.CreateDelegate(eventDelegate);

    eventInfo.AddEventHandler(obj, dEmitted);

    return tcs.Task;

@TITLE:How to populate/instantiate a C# array with a single value?
@CONTENT:I know that instantiated arrays of value types in C# are automatically populated with the default value of the type (eg false for bool, 0 for int, etc etc). Is there a way to autopopulate an array with a seed value that's not the default? Either on creation or a built in method afterwards (I believe Java has something like Array.Fill() which does this)? Say I wanted an boolean array that was true by default, instead of false. Is there a built in way to do this, or do you just have to iterate through the array with a for loop?  //Example pseudo-code:
 bool[] abValues = new[1000000];
 Array.Populate(abValues, true);

 // Currently how i'm handling this:
 bool[] abValues = new[1000000];
 for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++)
 {
     abValues[i] = true;
 }
 Having to iterate through the array and "reset" each value to true seems ineffecient. Is there anyway around this? Maybe by flipping all values? After typing this question out and thinking about it, I'm guessing that the default values are simply a result of how C# handles the memory allocation of these objects behind the scenes, so I imagine it's probably not possible to do this. But I'd still like to know for sure!
@CODE://Example pseudo-code:
 bool[] abValues = new[1000000];
 Array.Populate(abValues, true);

 // Currently how i'm handling this:
 bool[] abValues = new[1000000];

@TITLE:event.preventDefault() vs. return false (no jQuery)
@CONTENT:I wondered if event.preventDefault() and return false were the same. I have done some tests, and it seems that If the event handler is added using old model, for example elem.onclick = function(){
    return false;
};
 Then, return false prevents default action, like event.preventDefault(). If the event handler is added using addEventListener, for example elem.addEventListener(
    'click',
    function(e){
        return false;
    },
    false
);
 Then, return false doesn't prevent the default action. Do all browsers behave like this? Are there more differences between event.preventDefault() and return false? Where I can find some documentation (I couldn't in MDN) about return false behaving like event.preventDefault() in some cases? My question is only about plain javascript, not jQuery, so please don't mark it as a duplicate of event.preventDefault() vs. return false, even if both questions have almost the same title.
@CODE:event.preventDefault() return false elem.onclick = function(){
    return false;
}; return false event.preventDefault() addEventListener elem.addEventListener(
    'click',
    function(e){
        return false;
    },
    false
); return false event.preventDefault() return false return false event.preventDefault() return false

@TITLE:List all files from a directory recursively with Java
@CONTENT:I have this function that prints the name of all the files in a directory recursively. The problem is that my code is very slow because it has to access a remote network device with every iteration. My plan is to first load all the files from the directory recursively and then after that go through all files with the regex to filter out all the files I don't want. Does anyone have a better suggestion? public static printFnames(String sDir){
 ?File[] faFiles = new File(sDir).listFiles();
 ?for(File file: faFiles){
    if(file.getName().matches("^(.*?)")){
 ?    System.out.println(file.getAbsolutePath());
    }
 ?  if(file.isDirectory()){
 ? ?  printFnames(file.getAbsolutePath());
 ?  }

 This is just a test later on I'm not going to use the code like this, instead I'm going to add the path and modification date of every file which matches an advanced regex to an array.
@CODE:public static printFnames(String sDir){

@LINK:/questions/30720497/swift-do-try-catch-syntax
@TITLE:Swift do-try-catch syntax
@CONTENT:I give it a try to understand new error handling thing in swift 2. Here is what I did: I first declared an error enum: enum SandwichError: ErrorType {
    case NotMe
    case DoItYourself
}
 And then I declared a method that throws an error (not an exception folks. It is an error.). Here is that method: func makeMeSandwich(names: [String: String]) throws -> String {
    guard let sandwich = names["sandwich"] else {
        throw SandwichError.NotMe
    }

    return sandwich
}
 The problem is from the calling side. Here is the code that calls this method: let kitchen = ["sandwich": "ready", "breakfeast": "not ready"]

do {
    let sandwich = try makeMeSandwich(kitchen)
    print("i eat it \(sandwich)")
} catch SandwichError.NotMe {
    print("Not me error")
} catch SandwichError.DoItYourself {
    print("do it error")
}
 After the do line compiler says Errors thrown from here are not handled because the enclosing catch is not exhaustive. But in my opinion it is exhaustive because there is only two case in SandwichError enum. For regular switch statements swift can understands it is exhaustive when every case handled.
@CODE:enum SandwichError: ErrorType {
    case NotMe
    case DoItYourself
} func makeMeSandwich(names: [String: String]) throws -> String {
    guard let sandwich = names["sandwich"] else {
        throw SandwichError.NotMe
    }

    return sandwich
} let kitchen = ["sandwich": "ready", "breakfeast": "not ready"]

do {
    let sandwich = try makeMeSandwich(kitchen)
    print("i eat it \(sandwich)")
} catch SandwichError.NotMe {
    print("Not me error")

@TITLE:Notify ObservableCollection when Item changes
@CONTENT:I found on this link C#: ObservableCollection not noticing when Item in it changes (even with INotifyPropertyChanged) some techniques to notify a Observablecollection that an item has changed. the TrulyObservableCollection in this link seems to be what i'm looking for. public class TrulyObservableCollection<T> : ObservableCollection<T>
where T : INotifyPropertyChanged
{
public TrulyObservableCollection()
    : base()
{
    CollectionChanged += new NotifyCollectionChangedEventHandler(TrulyObservableCollection_CollectionChanged);
}

void TrulyObservableCollection_CollectionChanged(object sender, NotifyCollectionChangedEventArgs e)
{
    if (e.NewItems != null)
    {
        foreach (Object item in e.NewItems)
        {
            (item as INotifyPropertyChanged).PropertyChanged += new PropertyChangedEventHandler(item_PropertyChanged);
        }
    }
    if (e.OldItems != null)
    {
        foreach (Object item in e.OldItems)
        {
            (item as INotifyPropertyChanged).PropertyChanged -= new PropertyChangedEventHandler(item_PropertyChanged);

    }
}

void item_PropertyChanged(object sender, PropertyChangedEventArgs e)
{
    NotifyCollectionChangedEventArgs a = new NotifyCollectionChangedEventArgs(NotifyCollectionChangedAction.Reset);
    OnCollectionChanged(a);
}
 } But when i try to use it, i don't get notification on the collection. i'm not sure to make the good implementation in my c# Code: XAML :     <DataGrid AutoGenerateColumns="False" ItemsSource="{Binding MyItemsSource, Mode=TwoWay, UpdateSourceTrigger=PropertyChanged}">
        <DataGrid.Columns>
            <DataGridCheckBoxColumn Binding="{Binding MyProperty, Mode=TwoWay, UpdateSourceTrigger=PropertyChanged}"/>

        }

            PropertyChanged(this, e);
        }
    }

 I made the above so the when i touch the clock opens the alarm settings. But is not universal. I found out that on droids with 2.2 does not work.

Here's what I've got for my runtimes public void RunAsRoot{String[] commands = {"sysrw", "rm /data/local/bootanimation.zip", "sysro"};{

 Now that I know that this is the same as an INNER JOIN I find all these queries in my code and ask myself if I should rewrite them. Is there something smelly about them or are they just fine? EDIT: My answer summary: There is nothing wrong with this query BUT using the keywords will most probably make the code more readable/maintainable. My conclusion: I will not change my old queries but I will correct my writing style and use the keywords in the future. THANKS for your answers!

@LINK:/questions/370201/why-will-expressions-as-property-values-on-a-server-controls-lead-to-a-co
@TITLE:Why will <%= %> expressions as property values on a server-controls lead to a compile errors?
@CONTENT:This question is a result of what i noticed while trying to answer another question. And now im curious to know why <asp:TextBox runat="server" Visible="<%= true %>" /> leads to a compile error, and not to a visible TextBox as i would have expected. From what i have discovered so far, the <%= %> expressions are not translated to literal controls as i have always thought. But instead it is evaluated and written directly to the HtmlTextWriter when the page is rendered. But apparently the parser (I'm unsure that is the correct term for the part that is translating ASP.NET markup to .NET code) doesn't even attempt to evaluate <%= %> expressions, when they are used as property values for server controls. It just uses it as a string. Which i guess is why I get the error message: Cannot create an object of type 'System.Boolean' from its string representation '<%= true %>' for the 'Visible' property. If i instead ditch the runat="server" and combines the <%= %> with regular html-markup, like this: <input type="button" id="Button1" visible='<%= true %>' />
 Then the parser just splits the chunk in parts before and after the expression and then writes it to the HtmlTextWriter in the render method. Something like this:     __w.Write("<input type=\"button\" id=\"Button1\" visible='");
    __w.Write(true);
    __w.Write("' />");
 As the last thing i noticed... When i try with <%# %> + Control.DataBind(), then i get what i would expect. It hooks up the expression to be used when the control is databound, but unlike the <%= %> expression, the generated code actually evaluates the content of the <%# %> expression. The parser ends up generating the following: [DebuggerNonUserCode]
private Button __BuildControldataboundButton()
{
    Button button = new Button();
    base.databoundButton = button;
    button.ApplyStyleSheetSkin(this);
    button.ID = "databoundButton";
    button.DataBinding += new EventHandler(this.__DataBindingdataboundButton);
    return button;
}

public void __DataBindingdataboundButton(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    Button button = (Button) sender;
    Page bindingContainer = (Page) button.BindingContainer;
    button.Visible = true;
}
 From: <asp:Button ID="databoundButton" Visible='<%# true %>' runat="server" />
 Notice the button.Visible = true; that is the result of the <%# %> expression. So my question is.. Why is the expression in the first example just treated as a string, instead of being evaluated to "true". The expressions is somewhat similar for the two other examples, and they yield the code i would have expected. Is it just a mistake (which i doubt since it isn't a new issue with the current version of ASP.NET), or is there a good reason why we are not allowed to use <%= %> like that?
@CODE:<asp:TextBox runat="server" Visible="<%= true %>" /> <%= %> <%= %> <%= %> <input type="button" id="Button1" visible='<%= true %>' /> __w.Write("<input type=\"button\" id=\"Button1\" visible='");
    __w.Write(true);
    __w.Write("' />"); <%# %> <%# %> [DebuggerNonUserCode]
private Button __BuildControldataboundButton()
{
    Button button = new Button();
    base.databoundButton = button;
    button.ApplyStyleSheetSkin(this);
    button.ID = "databoundButton";
    button.DataBinding += new EventHandler(this.__DataBindingdataboundButton);
    return button;
}

public void __DataBindingdataboundButton(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    Button button = (Button) sender;
    Page bindingContainer = (Page) button.BindingContainer;
    button.Visible = true;
} <asp:Button ID="databoundButton" Visible='<%# true %>' runat="server" /> button.Visible = true; <%# %> <%= %>

When I tried it , I got an exception saying that only the Dispatcher thread can modify an ObservableCollection, and work came to a halt. Can anyone explain the problem, and how to get around it?

@TITLE:permutations with unique values
@CONTENT:itertools.permutations generates where its elements are treated as unique based on their position, not on their value. So basically I want to avoid duplicates like this: >>> list(itertools.permutations([1, 1, 1]))
[(1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 1)]
 Filtering afterwards is not possible because the amount of permutations is too large in my case. Does anybody know of a suitable algorithm for this? Thank you very much! EDIT: What I basically want is the following: x = itertools.product((0, 1, 'x'), repeat=X)
x = sorted(x, key=functools.partial(count_elements, elem='x'))
 which is not possible because sorted creates a list and the output of itertools.product is too large. Sorry, I should have described the actual problem.

 which constructor would be called, and why? I could test this myself but I want to understand how the overload resolution system works (not sure if that's what it's called).

 Update Commenter asked on the ieblog entry Testing sites with Browser Mode vs. Doc Mode: Can we get a description of how the document mode is determined when the HTML content is within an embedded webcontrol? Seems to be that the document mode is choosen differently - maybe for compatibility reasons? MarkSil [MSFT] responded: @Thomas: Thanks for raising that question. The WebBrowser Control determines the doc mode the same way that IE does because it contains the same web platform (e.g. there is one shared mshtml.dll across IE and WebBrowser Control hosts). The WebBrowser Control does default to the Compatibility View browser mode, which means that the default doc mode is IE7. Here is a blog post with more detail on this: blogs.msdn.com/.../more-ie8-extensibility-improvements.aspx. To which Thomas responded: @MarcSil (re: WebBrowser Control) The problem with using registry entries to select document mode for WebControl is that it applies to the application as a whole. I write plugins for Google SketchUp where you have WebDialog windows to create UIs - it's just a WebBrowser control in a window. But that leads to problems as I want to force a document mode for my instance of the WebBrowser control, not for all of SU's WebBrowser controls as a whole. So, my question is: how do you control the document mode per instance for a WebBrowser control?
@CODE:ie = CoInternetExplorer.Create;
ie.Navigate2("about:blank");
webDocument = ie.Document;
webDocument.Write(szSourceHTML);

@CONTENT:I'm sick of waiting for my developers to fix this, so I decided to ask you guys. I'm trying to modify what they've already given me, so sorry if the setup doesn't make a whole lot of sense. I could probably change it but want to keep as much of the existing table setup as possible. I've got a MySQL table with a bunch of entries in it, and a column called "Multiplier." The default (and most common) value for this column is 0, but it could be any number. What I need to do is select a single entry from that table at random. However, the rows are weighted according to the number in the "Multiplier" column. A value of 0 means that it's not weighted at all. A value of 1 means that it's weighted twice as much, as if the entry were in the table twice. A value of 2 means that it's weighted three times as much, as if the entry were in the table three times. I've been trying to figure out how to do this with SELECT and RAND(), but don't know how to do the weighting. Is it possible?

Note: I know you can draw/outline regions manually with tools intended for it (like http://www.birdtheme.org/useful/v3tool.html), but covering a large region ACCURATELY is a ton of work. The draw-it-yourself answer is not an option in this case. Example: https://maps.google.com/ -> type in "Uusimaa, Finland" You can see the pink-ish border that outlines the wanted region That border is the polyline that I need the coordinates of Requirements: Extract the region data coordinates (if available) from a given search (as in the example) If the previous is not possible, a source to an ACCURATE map of the region "Uusimaa, Finland" is required (plain googling did not yield needed results).

@TITLE:HTTP Headers for File Downloads
@CONTENT:I've written a PHP script that handles file downloads, determining which file is being requested and setting the proper HTTP headers to trigger the browser to actually download the file (rather than displaying it in the browser). I now have a problem where some users have reported certain files being identified incorrectly (so regardless of extension, the browser will consider it a GIF image). I'm guessing this is because I haven't set the "Content-type" in the response header. Is this most likely the case? If so, is there a fairly generic type that could be used for all files, rather than trying to account for every possible file type? Currently I'm only setting the value "Content-disposition: attachment; filename=arandomf.ile" Update: I followed this guide here to build a more robust process for file downloads (http://w-shadow.com/blog/2007/08/12/how-to-force-file-download-with-php/), but there is a significant delay between when the script is executed and when the browser's download dialog appears.

@TITLE:How To Get File In Assets From Android NDK
@CONTENT:I'm trying to access an image file in the assets folder from the native side. Now I can successfully search through the assets folder and its subdirectories locating the particular file that I am looking for: AAssetDir* assetDir = AAssetManager_openDir(asset_manager, "images");
const char* filename;
while ((filename = AAssetDir_getNextFileName(assetDir)) != NULL)
{
   __android_log_print(ANDROID_LOG_DEBUG, "Debug", filename);
}

AAssetDir_close(assetDir);
 I am also using OSG. I set the image as a texture to my shader with the following code: texture->setImage(osgDB::readImageFile(fileNameWithPath));
 But that file name must include the absolute path as well since it is not located in the same directory. However I found out that I cannot get the absolute path for the assets directory, being that it is compressed along with the APK. Being that I can't access the absolute path, what other way could I use to get the image? Also to note, I do want to keep the files in the asset folder as appose to the sd card.
@CODE:AAssetDir* assetDir = AAssetManager_openDir(asset_manager, "images");
const char* filename;

Here are the things you should know: The URL is https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/autocomplete/json?sensor=false&key=myKey&components=country:ro&input=whatTheUserTypes Please don't reply by saying you replaced the API key with your own and it worked - the API key which goes there must be Android specific and won't work from a browser. So did I make the Android API key using the SHA1 fingerprint obtained from the keystore I signed the app with. I turned on Maps and Places APIs from the console. The quota isn't exceeded. All those and it still gives me REQUEST_DENIED What I didn't mention is that I have O2Auth activated - does that change anything? Shouldn't it be as simple as putting the API key in the app? Thanks!

But how exactly does that work? What would I have to do to get my own classes to use the brackets? Right now Xcode will not allow me to do that for my own headers. Also, by looking in some frameworks headers, I see that the headers reference each other with <frameworkname/file.h>. How does that work? It looks a lot like packages in Java, but as far as I know, there is no such thing as a package in Objective-C.

@TITLE:JavaScript ternary operator example with functions
@CONTENT:I am using jQuery 1.7.1 I am just starting to use the JavaScript ternary operator to replace simple if/else statements. I have done so successfully in several places. I was surprised when I successfully made something else work when I thought for sure it wouldn't, but I tried anyway. Here's the original statement: function updateItem() {
    $this = $(this);
    var IsChecked = $this.hasClass("IsChecked");
    if (IsChecked == true){
        removeItem($this);
    } else {
        addItem($this);
    }
}
 Here's the same function using the ternary operator: function updateItem() {
    $this = $(this);
    var IsChecked = $this.hasClass("IsChecked");
    (IsChecked == true) ? removeItem($this) : addItem($this);
}
 I was surprised because all of the examples I saw being used were merely setting variables like this: x = (1 < 2) ? true : false;
 My question is whether this is "normal" use and will it work in most versions of JavaScript? Where will it fail? Are there other less obvious uses for it? UPDATE -- Thanks for the "real world" advice!!! I am using this as my function: function updateItem() {
    $this = $(this);
    $this.hasClass("IsChecked") ? removeItem($this) : addItem($this);
}
@CODE:function updateItem() {
    $this = $(this);
    var IsChecked = $this.hasClass("IsChecked");
    if (IsChecked == true){
        removeItem($this);
    } else {
        addItem($this);
    }
} function updateItem() {
    $this = $(this);
    var IsChecked = $this.hasClass("IsChecked");
    (IsChecked == true) ? removeItem($this) : addItem($this);
} x = (1 < 2) ? true : false; function updateItem() {
    $this = $(this);

@TITLE:Is `long` guaranteed to be at least 32 bits?
@CONTENT:By my reading of the C++ Standard, I have always understood that the sizes of the integral fundamental types in C++ were as follows: sizeof(char) <= sizeof(short int) <= sizeof(int) <= sizeof(long int)
 I deduced this from 3.9.1/2: There are four signed integer types: ¡§signed char¡¨, ¡§short int¡¨, ¡§int¡¨, and ¡§long int.¡¨ In this list, each type provides at least as much storage as those preceding it in the list. Plain ints have the natural size suggested by the architecture of the execution environment Further, the size of char is described by 3.9.1/ as being: [...] large enough to store any member of the implementation¡¦s basic character set. 1.7/1 defines this in more concrete terms: The fundamental storage unit in the C + + memory model is the byte. A byte is at least large enough to contain any member of the basic execution character set and is composed of a contiguous sequence of bits, the number of which is implementation-defined. This leads me to the following conclusion: 1 == sizeof(char) <= sizeof(short int) <= sizeof(int) <= sizeof(long int)
 where sizeof tells us how many bytes the type is. Furthermore, it is implementation-defined how many bits are in a byte. Most of us are probably used to dealing with 8-bit bytes, but the Standard says there are n bits in a byte. In this post, Alf P. Steinbach says: long is guaranteed (at least) 32 bits. This flies in the face of everything I understand the size of the fundamental types to be in C++ according to the Standard. Normally I would just discount this statement as a beginner being wrong, but since this was Alf I decided it was worth investigating further. So, what say you? Is a long guaranteed by the standard to be at least 32 bits? If so, please be specific as to how this guarantee is made. I just don't see it. The C++ Standard specifically says that in order to know C++ you must know C (1.2/1) 1 The C++ Standard implicitly defines the minimum limit on the values a long can accommodate to be LONG_MIN-LONG_MAX 2 So no matter how big a long is, it has to be big enough to hold LONG_MIN to LONG_MAX. But Alf and others are specific that a long must be at least 32 bits. This is what I'm trying to establish. The C++ Standard is explicit that the number of bits in a byte are not specified (it could be 4, 8, 16, 42) So how is the connection made from being able to accommodate the numbers LONG_MIN-LONG_MAX to being at least 32 bits?

@CONTENT:I have recently started programming in WPF and bumped into the following problem. I don't understand how to use the Dispatcher.Invoke method. I have experience in threading and I have made a few simpele Windows Forms programs where I just used the Control.CheckForIllegalCrossThreadCalls = false;
 Yes I know that is pretty lame but these were simple monitoring applications. The fact is now I am making a WPF application which retrieves data in the background, I start off a new thread to make the call to retrieve the data (from a webserver), now I want to display it on my WPF form. The thing is, I cannot set any control from this thread. Not even a label or anything. How can this be resolved? Answer comments: @Jalfp: So I use this Dispatcher method in the 'new tread' when I get the data? Or should I make a background worker retrieve the data, put it into a field and start a new thread that waits till this field is filled and call the dispatcher to show the retrieved data into the controls? Can I bump this?

 None of the standard number formats are like this, and a custom format also doesn't seem to allow having an open number of digits after the decimal separator. This is not a duplicate of How to convert double to string without the power to 10 representation (E-05) because the answers given there do not solve the issue at hand. The accepted solution in this question was to use a fixed point (such as 20 digits), which is not what I want. A fixed point formatting and trimming the redundant 0 doesn't solve the issue either because the max width for fixed width is 99 characters. Note: the solution has to deal correctly with custom number formats (e.g. other decimal separator, depending on culture information). Edit: The question is really only about displaing aforementioned numbers. I'm aware of how floating point numbers work and what numbers can be used and computed with them.

@LINK:/questions/2080764/how-to-preserve-control-state-within-tab-items-in-a-tabcontrol
@TITLE:How to preserve control state within tab items in a TabControl
@CONTENT:I am a newcomer to WPF, attempting to build a project that follows the recommendations of Josh Smith's excellent article describing The Model-View-ViewModel Design Pattern. Using Josh's sample code as a base, I have created a simple application that contains a number of "workspaces", each represented by a tab in a TabControl. In my application, a workspace is a document editor that allows a hierarchical document to be manipulated via a TreeView control. Although I have succeeded in opening multiple workspaces and viewing their document content in the bound TreeView control, I find that the TreeView "forgets" its state when switching between tabs. For example, if the TreeView in Tab1 is partially expanded, it will be shown as fully collapsed after switching to Tab2 and returning to Tab1. This behaviour appears to apply to all aspects of control state for all controls. After some experimentation, I have realized that I can preserve state within a TabItem by explicitly binding each control state property to a dedicated property on the underlying ViewModel. However, this seems like a lot of additional work, when I simply want all my controls to remember their state when switching between workspaces. I assume I am missing something simple, but I am not sure where to look for the answer. Any guidance would be much appreciated. Thanks, Tim Update: As requested, I will attempt to post some code that demonstrates this problem. However, since the data that underlies the TreeView is complex, I will post a simplified example that exhibits the same symtoms. Here is the XAML from the main window: <TabControl IsSynchronizedWithCurrentItem="True" ItemsSource="{Binding Path=Docs}">
    <TabControl.ItemTemplate>
        <DataTemplate>
            <ContentPresenter Content="{Binding Path=Name}" />
        </DataTemplate>
    </TabControl.ItemTemplate>

    <TabControl.ContentTemplate>
        <DataTemplate>
            <view:DocumentView />
        </DataTemplate>
    </TabControl.ContentTemplate>
</TabControl>
 The above XAML correctly binds to an ObservableCollection of DocumentViewModel, whereby each member is presented via a DocumentView. For the simplicity of this example, I have removed the TreeView (mentioned above) from the DocumentView and replaced it with a TabControl containing 3 fixed tabs: <TabControl>
    <TabItem Header="A" />
    <TabItem Header="B" />
    <TabItem Header="C" />
</TabControl>
 In this scenario, there is no binding between the DocumentView and the DocumentViewModel. When the code is run, the inner TabControl is unable to remember its selection when the outer TabControl is switched. However, if I explicitly bind the inner TabControl's SelectedIndex property ... <TabControl SelectedIndex="{Binding Path=SelectedDocumentIndex}">
    <TabItem Header="A" />
    <TabItem Header="B" />
    <TabItem Header="C" />
</TabControl>
 ... to a corresponding dummy property on the DocumentViewModel ... public int SelecteDocumentIndex { get; set; }
 ... the inner tab is able to remember its selection. I understand that I can effectively solve my problem by applying this technique to every visual property of every control, but I am hoping there is a more elegant solution.
@CODE:<TabControl IsSynchronizedWithCurrentItem="True" ItemsSource="{Binding Path=Docs}">
    <TabControl.ItemTemplate>
        <DataTemplate>
            <ContentPresenter Content="{Binding Path=Name}" />
        </DataTemplate>

I've looked at many posts and articles on the subject and understand the potential issues with getting a reference to a partially constructed object, and as far as I can tell, I don't think my implementation is subject to these issues. Are there any issues with the following pattern? And, if not, why don't people use it? I've never seen it recommended in any of the discussion I've seen around this issue. public class Test {
    private static Test instance;
    private static boolean initialized = false;

    public static Test getInstance() {
        if (!initialized) {
            synchronized (Test.class) {
                if (!initialized) {
                    instance = new Test();
                    initialized = true;
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
@CODE:public class Test {
    private static Test instance;
    private static boolean initialized = false;

    public static Test getInstance() {
        if (!initialized) {
            synchronized (Test.class) {
                if (!initialized) {
                    instance = new Test();
                    initialized = true;
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }
} !initialized initialized dup

@TITLE:Java multi-threading & Safe Publication
@CONTENT:After reading "Java concurrent in practice" and "OSGI in practice" I found a specific subject very interesting; Safe Publication. The following is from JCIP: To publish an object safely, both the reference to the object and the object's state must be made visible to other threads at the same time. A properly constructed object can be safely published by: Initializing an object reference from a static initializer. Storing a reference to it into a volatile field. Storing a reference to it into a final field. Storing a reference to it into a field that is properly guarded by a (synchronized) lock. My first question: how many java developers are aware of this (problem)? How many real world java applications are really following this, AND is this really a real problem? I have a feeling that 99% of the implemented JVMs out there are not that "evil", i.e. a thread is not guaranteed (in fact its practical (almost) "impossible") to see stale data just because the reference is not following the "safe publication idiom" above.

@TITLE:How can I intercept calls to python's ¡§magic¡¨ methods in new style classes?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to intercept calls to python's double underscore magic methods in new style classes. This is a trivial example but it show's the intent: class ShowMeList(object):
    def __init__(self, it):
        self._data = list(it)

    def __getattr__(self, name):
        attr = object.__getattribute__(self._data, name)
        if callable(attr):
            def wrapper(*a, **kw):
                print "before the call"
                result = attr(*a, **kw)
                print "after the call"
                return result
            return wrapper
        return attr
 If I use that proxy object around list I get the expected behavior for non-magic methods but my wrapper function is never called for magic methods. >>> l = ShowMeList(range(8))

>>> l #call to __repr__
<__main__.ShowMeList object at 0x9640eac>

>>> l.append(9)
before the call
after the call

>> len(l._data)
9
 If I don't inherit from object (first line class ShowMeList:) everything works as expected: >>> l = ShowMeList(range(8))

>>> l #call to __repr__
before the call
after the call
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

>>> l.append(9)
before the call
after the call

>> len(l._data)
9
 How do I accomplish this intercept with new style classes?
@CODE:class ShowMeList(object):
    def __init__(self, it):
        self._data = list(it)

    def __getattr__(self, name):

@TITLE:Border with rounded corners & transparency
@CONTENT:The following screenshot shows a test of TextBubbleBorder1. I would like to make the corners of the component that are outside the rectangle to be entirely transparent & show whatever component is beneath it. I found a way to restrict the BG color of a label to 'inside the border' by setting a Clip (representing the area outside the rounded corners) on the Graphics2D instance and calling clearRect(). That can be seen in Label 1. However you can see the downside of this approach when there is a red BG (or any non-standard color) on the parent panel. The corners default to the default panel color (easiest to see in Panel 2). Ultimately I would like this to work for a non-standard color in the parent container, but it was partly inspired by What do I need to do to replicate this component with gradient paint? Does anybody know a way to get those corners transparent? import java.awt.*;

@LINK:/questions/7324033/what-are-the-benefits-of-a-deferred-execution-in-linq
@TITLE:What are the benefits of a Deferred Execution in LINQ?
@CONTENT:LINQ uses a Deferred Execution model which means that resulting sequence is not returned at the time the Linq operators are called, but instead these operators return an object which then yields elements of a sequence only when we enumerate this object. While I understand how deferred queries work, I'm having some trouble understanding the benefits of deferred execution: 1) I've read that deferred query executing only when you actually need the results can be of great benefit. So what is this benefit? 2) Other advantage of deferred queries is that if you define a query once, then each time you enumerate the results, you will get different results if the data changes. a) But as seen from the code below, we're able to achieve the same effect ( thus each time we enumerate the resource, we get different result if data changed ) even without using deferred queries: List<string> sList = new List<string>( new[]{ "A","B" });

foreach (string item in sList)
    Console.WriteLine(item); // Q1 outputs AB

sList.Add("C");

foreach (string item in sList)
    Console.WriteLine(item); // Q2 outputs ABC
 3) Are there any other benefits of deferred execution?
@CODE:List<string> sList = new List<string>( new[]{ "A","B" });

foreach (string item in sList)
    Console.WriteLine(item); // Q1 outputs AB

sList.Add("C");

foreach (string item in sList)

@TITLE:How to use multiple MapActivities/MapViews per Android application/process
@CONTENT:I have written one MapActivity class that is able to display a set of places as well as single places. On startup, the application creates an instance of this MapActivity and displays multiple places. If the user clicks on a certain place, then a new Activity is launched that shows the details of the selected place. This activity has a menu item that allows the user to view the place on a map - this causes that a new instance of the MapActivity is created, except that now only this single place is displayed. The problem now is that if the user navigates back to the first MapActivity (the one that shows multiple places) the tiles won't be loaded anymore + sometimes OutOfMemoryErrors are encountered. According to the Android JavaDocs, it is only possible to have one MapActivity per process. However, I don't want to define my MapActivity as a singleInstance/singleTask, since the user should always be able to navigate back to the first MapActivity that shows multiple places. I have seen that the Google Places app (which has come with Google Map 4.4) for Android uses multiple MapActivity instances. How is this possible? And how can I achieve it in my application?

@TITLE:Mercator longitude and latitude calculations to x and y on a cropped map (of the UK)
@CONTENT:I have this image: http://imgur.com/99tSz.png. A map of the UK (not including Southern Ireland). I have successfully managed to get a latitude and longitude and plot it onto this map by taking the leftmost longitude and rightmost longitude of the UK and using them to work out where to put the point on the map. This is the code (for use in Processing.js but could be used as js or anything): // Size of the map
int width = 538;
int height = 811;
// X and Y boundaries
float westLong = -8.166667;
float eastLong = 1.762833;
float northLat = 58.666667;
float southLat = 49.95;

void drawPoint(float latitude, float longitude){

 fill(#000000);

 x = width * ((westLong-longitude)/(westLong-eastLong));
 y = (height * ((northLat-latitude)/(northLat-southLat)));

 console.log(x + ", " + y);
 ellipseMode(RADIUS);
 ellipse(x, y, 2, 2);    

}
 However, I haven't been able to implement a Mercator projection on these values. The plots are reasonably accurate but they are not good enough and this projection would solve it. I can't figure out how to do it. All the examples I find are explaining how to do it for the whole world. This is a good resource of examples explaining how to implement the projection but I haven't been able to get it to work. Another resource is the Extreme points of the United Kingdom where I got the latitude and longitude values of the bounding box around the UK. They are also here: northLat = 58.666667; 
northLong = -3.366667; 
eastLat = 52.481167; 
eastLong = 1.762833; 
southLat = 49.95;
southLong = -5.2; 
westLat = 54.45;
westLong = -8.166667;
 If anyone could help me with this, I would greatly appreciate it! Thanks

 it works fine. Likewise, if I use the old inside-out way GetData().ContinueWith(t => Data = t.Result);
 That works too. I was just wondering why we can't call await from within a constructor directly. There are probably lots of (even obvious) edge cases and reasons against it, I just can't think of any. I've also search around for an explanation, but can't seem to find any.

@TITLE:A Regex that will never be matched by anything
@CONTENT:This might sound like a stupid question, but I had a long talk with some of my fellow developers and it sounded like a fun thing to think of. So; what's your thought - what does a Regex look like, that will never be matched by any string, ever! Edit: Why I want this? Well, firstly because I find it interesting to think of such an expression and secondly because I need it for a script. In that script I define a dictionary as Dictionary<string, Regex>. This contains, as you see, a string and an expression. Based on that dictionary I create methods that all use this dictionary as only reference on how they should do their work, one of them matches the regexes against a parsed logfile. If an expression is matched, another Dictionary<string, long> is added a value that is returned by the expression. So, to catch any log-messages that are not matched by an expression in the dictionary I created a new group called "unknown". To this group everything that didn't match anything other is added. But to prevent the "unknown"-expression to mismatch (by accident) a log-message, I had to create an expression that is most certainly never matched, no matter what string I give it. Thus, there you have my reason for this "not a real question"...

@TITLE:window.onbeforeunload not working on the iPad?
@CONTENT:Does anyone know if the onbeforeunload event is supported on the iPad and/or if there's a different way to use it? I've tried pretty much everything, and it seems like the onbeforeunload event is never triggered on the iPad (Safari browser). Specifically, this is what I've tried: window.onbeforeunload = function(event) { event.returnValue = 'test'; } window.onbeforeunload = function(event) { return 'test'; } (both of the above together) window.onbeforeunload = function(event) { alert('test')'; } (all of the above functions but inside <body onbeforeunload="..."> All of these work on FF and Safari on the PC, but not on the iPad. Also, I've done the following just after loading the page: alert('onbeforeunload' in window);
alert(typeof window.onbeforeunload);
alert(window.onbeforeunload);
 Respectively, the results are: true object null So, the browser does have the property, but for some reason it doesn't get fired. The ways I try to navigate away from the page are by clicking the back and forward buttons, by doing a google search in the top bar, by changing location in the address bar, and by clicking on a bookmark. Does anyone have any idea about what's going on? I'd greatly appreciate any input. Thanks
@CODE:onbeforeunload onbeforeunload window.onbeforeunload = function(event) { event.returnValue = 'test'; } window.onbeforeunload = function(event) { return 'test'; } window.onbeforeunload = function(event) { alert('test')'; } <body onbeforeunload="..."> alert('onbeforeunload' in window);

@CONTENT:Similar to a question posted here, am looking for a solution in Java. That is, how to find the index of nth occurrence of a character/string from a string? Example: "/folder1/folder2/folder3/". In this case, if I ask for 3rd occurrence of slash (/), it appears before folder3, and I expect to return this index position. My actual intention is to substring it from nth occurrence of a character. Is there any convenient/ready-to-use method available in Java API or do we need to write a small logic on our own to solve this? Also, I quickly searched whether any method is supported for this purpose at Apache Commons Lang's StringUtils, but I don't find any. Can regular expressions help in this regard?

@TITLE:splitting a list of arbitrary size into only roughly N-equal parts
@CONTENT:what is the best way to divide a list into roughly equal parts? for example, if I have a list with 54 elements and i want to split it into 3 roughly equal parts? I'd like the parts to be as even as possible, hopefully assigning the elements that do not fit in a way that gives the most equal parts. to give a concrete case, if the list has 7 elements and I want to split it into 2 parts, I'd ideally want to get the first 3 elements in one bin, the second should have 4 elements. so to summarize I'm looking for something like even_split(l, n) that breaks l into roughly n-different parts. the best I can think of is something that was posted here: def chunks(l, n):
    """ Yield successive n-sized chunks from l.
    """
    for i in xrange(0, len(l), n):
        yield l[i:i+n]
 example: l = range(54)
chunks_of_three = chunks(l, 3)
 but this gives chunks of 3, rather than 3 equal parts. I could simply iterate over this and take the first element of each column, call that part one, then take the second and put it in part two, etc. but that seems inefficient and inelegant. it also breaks the order of the list. any ideas on this? thanks.

 IE raises stack overflow when the values are around 3200, Firefox and Chrome can handle a very deep recursion if compared to IE. I would like to know if there's a way to tie the stack-overflow exception with the Javascript function that raised it during runtime in IE or any other browser and if it could give the stacktrace with the chain of function in the stack at the moment the error was raised.

@TITLE:Is there a PHP equivalent of Perl's WWW::Mechanize?
@CONTENT:I'm looking for a library that has functionality similar to Perl's WWW::Mechanize, but for PHP. Basically, it should allow me to submit HTTP GET and POST requests with a simple syntax, and then parse the resulting page and return in a simple format all forms and their fields, along with all links on the page. I know about CURL, but it's a little too barebones, and the syntax is pretty ugly (tons of curl_foo($curl_handle, ...) statements Clarification: I want something more high-level than the answers so far. For example, in Perl, you could do something like: # navigate to the main page
$mech->get( 'http://www.somesite.com/' ); 

# follow a link that contains the text 'download this'
$mech->follow_link( text_regex => qr/download this/i );

# submit a POST form, to log into the site
$mech->submit_form(
    with_fields      => {
        username    => 'mungo',
        password    => 'lost-and-alone',
    }
);

# save the results as a file
$mech->save_content('somefile.zip');
 To do the same thing using HTTP_Client or wget or CURL would be a lot of work, I'd have to manually parse the pages to find the links, find the form URL, extract all the hidden fields, and so on. The reason I'm asking for a PHP solution is that I have no experience with Perl, and I could probably build what I need with a lot of work, but it would be much quicker if I could do the above in PHP.
@CODE:curl_foo($curl_handle, ...) # navigate to the main page
$mech->get( 'http://www.somesite.com/' ); 

# follow a link that contains the text 'download this'

# submit a POST form, to log into the site

@TITLE:Retrieve Facebook Fan Names
@CONTENT:I'm trying to grab the names of fans of a Facebook fan page that I administer. I've done some snooping around, and apparently, the FB API doesn't support that, but Facebook actually uses AJAX/JSON to populate the list. Anyways, can anyone suggest a way to make that call myself and grab the data as plain text? Also, I've found a hack that a guy wrote in Ruby, but I am completely unfamiliar with the language. Thanks for the help in advance!

@CONTENT:Is it possible to detect when a user is printing something from their browser? To complicate matters, if we are presenting a user with a PDF document in a new window is it possible to detect the printing of that document ( assuming the user prints it from the browser window)? The closest I've been able to find is if we implement custom print functionality (something like this) and track when that is invoked I'm primarily interested in a solution that works for internet explorer (6 or later)

@TITLE:Google Play Services in emulator, implementing Google Plus login button etc
@CONTENT:When integrating a Google Plus login button in an Android app, I'm observing some differences in how the button appears on an actual device and in the emulator. I am aware of the fact that the Google Plus services APKs are not installed in the emulator, but this can be worked around by pulling the APKs from a device and installing them into the emulator using APK. My current "implementation" simply includes the login button in a layout, by referring to the button with the following XML code: <com.google.android.gms.common.SignInButton
    android:id="@+id/sign_in_button"
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content" />
 When I test my app on the device, the button appears all red and shiny, according to the guidelines mentioned here https://developers.google.com/+/mobile/android/sign-in . But when running on the emulator, it's just a normal button (grey background with black text) saying "Sign in with Google". Any idea why the results are different? I've made sure I'm running the same API level, and the resource does seem to get pulled in correctly also on the emulator since it shows the actual login button (but with a different look). Update: Found a clue in logcat; the message "Sign in button not found, using placeholder instead." pretty much explains why I'm seeing the grey dull button on the emulator. Still need to figure out why; could be the "copy google plus apk's from device" hack isn't working properly.

 However, this uses the property names from data when printing to the .json file. I would like to change the property names to be something different (say, change 'foo' to 'bar'). In the Json.net documentation, under 'Serializing and Deserializing JSON' -> 'Serialization Attributes' it says "JsonPropertyAttribute... allows the name to be customized". But there is no example. Does anyone know how to use a JsonPropertyAttribute to change the property name to something else? (Direct link to documentation) Json.net's documentation seems to be sparse.

@TITLE:Why does strncpy not null terminate?
@CONTENT:strncpy() supposedly protects from buffer overflows. But if it prevents an overflow without null terminating, in all likelyhood a subsequent string operation is going to overflow. So to protect against this I find myself doing: strncpy( dest, src, LEN );
dest[LEN - 1] = '\0';
 man strncpy gives: The strncpy() function is similar, except that not more than n bytes of src are copied. Thus, if there is no null byte among the first n bytes of src, the result will not be null-terminated. Without null terminating something seemingly innocent like:    printf( "FOO: %s\n", dest );
 ...could crash. Are there better, safer alternatives to strncpy()?

@TITLE:item frequency count in python
@CONTENT:I'm a python newbie, so maybe my question is very noob. Assume I have a list of words, and I want to find the number of times each word appears in that list. Obvious way to do this is: words = "apple banana apple strawberry banana lemon"
uniques = set(words.split())
freqs = [(item, words.split.count(item)) for item in uniques]
print(freqs)
 But I find this code not very good, because this way program runs through words list twice, once to build the set, and second time counting the number of appearances. Of course, I could write a function to run through list and do the counting, but that wouldn't be so pythonic. So, is there a more efficient and pythonic way?
@CODE:words = "apple banana apple strawberry banana lemon"
uniques = set(words.split())
freqs = [(item, words.split.count(item)) for item in uniques]

@TITLE:Local Variables Within aes
@CONTENT:I'm trying to use a local variable in aes when I plot with ggplot. This is my problem boiled down to the essence: xy <- data.frame(x=1:10,y=1:10)

plotfunc <- function(Data,YMul=2){
    ggplot(Data,aes(x=x,y=y*YMul))+geom_line()
}

plotfunc(xy)
 This results in the following error: Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos) : object 'YMul' not found
 It seems as if I cannot use local variables (or function arguments) in aes. Could it be that it occurrs due to the content of aes being executed later when the local variable is out of scope? How can I avoid this problem (other than not using the local variable within aes)?
@CODE:aes xy <- data.frame(x=1:10,y=1:10)

@LINK:/questions/1819131/c-static-member-initalization-template-fun-inside
@TITLE:C++ Static member initalization (template fun inside)
@CONTENT:For static member initialization I use a nested helper struct, which works fine for non templated classes. However, if the enclosing class is parameterized by a template, the nested initialization class is not instantiated, if the helper object is not accessed in the main code. For illustration, a simplified example (In my case, I need to initialize a vector). #include <string>
#include <iostream>

struct A
{
    struct InitHelper
    {
        InitHelper()
        {
            A::mA = "Hello, I'm A.";
        }
    };
    static std::string mA;
    static InitHelper mInit;

    static const std::string& getA(){ return mA; }
};
std::string A::mA;
A::InitHelper A::mInit;


template<class T>
struct B
{
    struct InitHelper
    {
        InitHelper()
        {
            B<T>::mB = "Hello, I'm B."; // [3]
        }
    };
    static std::string mB;
    static InitHelper mInit;

    static const std::string& getB() { return mB; }
    static InitHelper& getHelper(){ return mInit; }
};
template<class T>
std::string B<T>::mB; //[4]
template<class T>
typename B<T>::InitHelper B<T>::mInit;


int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    std::cout << "A = " << A::getA() << std::endl;

//    std::cout << "B = " << B<int>::getB() << std::endl; // [1]
//    B<int>::getHelper();    // [2]
}
 With g++ 4.4.1: [1] and [2] commented: A = Hello, I'm A. Works as intended [1] uncommented: A = Hello, I'm A.
B = I would expect, that the InitHelper initializes mB [1] and [2] uncommented: A = Hello, I'm A.
B = Hello, I'm B. Works as intended [1] commented, [2] uncommented: Segfault in the static initialization stage at [3] Thus my question: Is this a compiler bug or is the bug sitting between the monitor and the chair? And if the latter is the case: Is there an elegant solution (i.e. without explicitly calling a static initialization method)? Thank you very much for any suggestions/comments. Update I: This seems to be a desired behavior (as defined in the ISO/IEC C++ 2003 standard, 14.7.1): Unless a member of a class template or a member template has been explicitly instantiated or explicitly specialized, the specialization of the member is implicitly instantiated when the specialization is referenced in a context that requires the member definition to exist; in particular, the initialization (and any associated side-effects) of a static data member does not occur unless the static data member is itself used in a way that requires the definition of the static data member to exist.

#include <iostream>

struct A
{
    struct InitHelper
    {
        InitHelper()
        {

@LINK:/questions/8737421/trying-to-learn-understand-ruby-setter-and-getter-methods
@TITLE:Trying to learn / understand Ruby setter and getter methods
@CONTENT:I'm just learning to program and have decided to try Ruby. I'm sure this is a stupid question, but the instructor is talking about setter and getter methods, and I'm confused. Here is the example: class Human
  def noise=(noise)
    @noise = noise
  end

  def noise
    @noise
  end
end
 From this, the class is instantiated, and I can puts this out: man = Human.new
man.noise=("Howdie!")
puts man.noise
 This results in Howdie! Now what confuses me is that the instructor is saying without the getter method (the 2nd of the two methods), there is no way to interact with the instance variable @noise. But when I remove the getter method, I'm able to still access @noise, see example: class Human
  def noise=(noise)
    @noise = noise
  end
end

man = Human.new
puts man.noise=("Howdie!")
 This works the same as when the getter method it used. So now I'm confused. Why is the getter needed? What does the instructor mean by not being able to access the instance variable without it? Is it possible he's using an older version of Ruby? Thanks in advance for your help.
@CODE:class Human
  def noise=(noise)
    @noise = noise
  end

  def noise
    @noise
  end
end man = Human.new
man.noise=("Howdie!")
puts man.noise Howdie! class Human
  def noise=(noise)
    @noise = noise
  end
end

man = Human.new
puts man.noise=("Howdie!")

@CONTENT:I was compiling a C++ program in Cygwin using g++ and I had a class whose constructor had no arguments. I had the lines: MyClass myObj();
myObj.function1();
 And when trying to compile it, I got the message: error: request for member 'function1' in 'myObj', which is of non-class type 'MyClass ()()' After a little research, I found that the fix was to change that first line to MyClass myObj; I could swear I've done empty constructor declarations with parentheses in C++ before. Is this probably a limitation of the compiler I'm using or does the language standard really say don't use parentheses for a constructor without arguments?

This will prevent posting twice, which causes duplicate data in a database. I tried adding; OnClientClick="this.disabled='true';"
 to try to disable the button in JavaScript. However, though the button becomes disabled, the postback for the button then doesn't work. Disabling the button to prevent multiple submissions is the ideal for this application. How can I do this? EDIT I am unable to use third-party controls.

@CONTENT:I'm reading Head First design patterns and in the chapter on the singleton pattern it shows you how to implement double checked locking as follows: public class Singleton {
    private volatile static Singleton instance;
    private Singleton() {}
    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            synchronized (Singleton.class) {

            }
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
 I don't understand why volatile is being used. Doesn't using volatile defeat the purpose of using double checked locking i.e performance?
@CODE:public class Singleton {
    private volatile static Singleton instance;
    private Singleton() {}
    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {

 When running the above code the output is: X (Updated By Y) And not: X (Updated By Y) (Updated By Z) As I had hoped. It seems that assigning a "ref parameter" to a field loses the reference. Is there any way to keep hold of the reference when assigning to a field? Thanks.

@TITLE:Error handling with PHPMailer
@CONTENT:I'm trying to use PHPMailer for a small project, but I'm a bit confused about error handling with this software. Hoping someone has experience with it. When I've set up an email and I use: $result = $mail->Send();

if(!$result) {
    // There was an error
    // Do some error handling things here
} else {
    echo "Email successful";
}
 Which works fine, more or less. The problem is when there's an error, PHPMailer also seems to echo the error out, so if there's a problem, it just sends that info directly to the browser, essentially breaking any error handling I"m trying to do. Is there a way to silence these messages? Its not throwing an exception, its just printing out the error, which in my test case is: invalid address: @invalid@email You must provide at least one recipient email address.
 Its meant to be an error, but it should be residing in $mail->ErrorInfo; not being echo'd out by the software.
@CODE:$result = $mail->Send();

if(!$result) {
    // There was an error
    // Do some error handling things here
} else {

@TITLE:Android - zoom in/out RelativeLayout with spread/pinch
@CONTENT:I have an activity with a RelativeLayout and a private class in it, which extends the SimpleOnScaleGestureListener. In the onScale method of the listener I'd like to zoom in/out of the whole layout (everything the user sees) with the user spreading/pinching his fingers. I'd like the changes to the layout NOT to be permanent, i.e. when the spread/pinch gesture is over I'd like the layout to go back to what it was in first place (any resetting could be done in the onScaleEnd method of the SimpleOnScaleGestureListener for example). I've tried to implement it via calling setScaleX and setScaleY on the RelativeLayout and also by using a ScaleAnimation. Neither resulted in smooth zooming (or anything that could at all be called zooming). Is it even possible to zoom in/out a RelativeLayout? The only idea I have left would be reading a screenshot from the cache and putting it as an ImageView on top of the whole layout and the zoom in/out of this image via setImageMatrix. I have no clue, however, how to implement this. May layout also contains a container for a fragment, which is empty at the time the zooming is supposed to be possible. In the onScaleEnd gesture, the fragment is put into it's container (already implemented and working fine). Here is my layout: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

@TITLE:TwitteR, ROAuth and Windows: register OK, but certificate verify failed
@CONTENT:I'm trying to get the number of followers of a large number of Twitter users with twitteR. Many of the other questions posted have been very useful in getting me this far, but none seem to be directly relevant to my problem, so far as I can see. I can register my OAuth credentials to a twitter R session, but then I can't seem to do anything at all, I just get is this message: Error in function (type, msg, asError = TRUE) : SSL certificate problem, verify that the CA cert is OK. Details: error:14090086:SSL routines:SSL3_GET_SERVER_CERTIFICATE:certificate verify fail When I use the twitteR functions without using OAuth they work fine with no errors or warnings, but I bump into limits and protected accounts, which I thought I could avoid with OAuth.

 How can I get the twitteR functions working after I register my credentials? UPDATE: Trying @Btibert3's suggestion gives the same error: > ## Authenticate with Twitter = this is an important peice of code

@TITLE:How to write data in plist?
@CONTENT:I have created save.plist in resource folder. I have written some data within that directly (without using coding). I am able to read that data but I cant able write through coding into the same save.plist. By using following code I am trying to write the data but it get stored within my .app plist.

@CONTENT:I'm having a hard time figuring out how to put this all together. I have a puzzle solving app on the mac. You enter the puzzle, press a button, and while it's trying to find the number of solutions, min moves and such I would like to keep the UI updated. Then once it's finished calculating, re-enable the button and change the title. Below is some sample code from the button selector, and the solving function: ( Please keep in mind I copy/paste from Xcode so there might be some missing {} or some other typos.. but it should give you an idea what I'm trying to do.

@TITLE:mysqli::mysqli(): (HY000/2002): Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket 'MySQL' (2)
@CONTENT:I get this error when I try to connect to the mysql database using php mysqli class. Using following code: $db = new MySQLi("localhost","kamil","*****");

 password is * for security. I have created user kamil with all privileges on external ip address and localhost. When I run: select user,host from mysql.user it properly displays those two users. I did some research and used this benchmark: http://stackoverflow.com/a/2183134/1839439 to see what it connects to. As it turns out it is only able to connect to 127.0.0.1 and 127.0.0.1:3306 which is localhost, however when I supply localhost it throws out this error. My question is why does it only allow me to connect to DB using localhost ip address and not the name or external ip. Do I need a different host if I want to be able to use mysql on website or if I can use 127.0.0.1? EDIT: hosts file 127.0.0.1       localhost

@TITLE:How to get code point number for a given character in a utf-8 string?
@CONTENT:I want to get the UCS-2 code points for a given UTF-8 string. For example the word "hello" should become something like "0068 0065 006C 006C 006F". Please note that the characters could be from any language including complex scripts like the east asian languages. So, the problem comes down to "convert a given character to its UCS-2 code point" But how? Please, any kind of help will be very very much appreciated since I am in a great hurry. Thanks in advance Transcription of questioner's response posted as an answer Thanks for your reply, but it needs to be done in PHP v 4 or 5 but not 6. The string will be a user input, from a form field. I want to implement a PHP version of utf8to16 or utf8decode like function get_ucs2_codepoint($char)
{
    // calculation of ucs2 codepoint value and assign it to $hex_codepoint
    return $hex_codepoint;
}
 Can you help me with PHP or can it be done with PHP with version mentioned above? Thank you again.

@TITLE:Loop through Textboxes
@CONTENT:I have a winforms app that has 37 textboxes on the screen. Each one is sequentially numbered: DateTextBox0
DateTextBox1 ...
DateTextBox37
 I am trying to iterate through the text boxes and assign a value to each one: int month = MonthYearPicker.Value.Month;
int year = MonthYearPicker.Value.Year;
int numberOfDays = DateTime.DaysInMonth(year, month);

m_MonthStartDate = new DateTime(year, month, 1);
m_MonthEndDate = new DateTime(year, month, numberOfDays);

DayOfWeek monthStartDayOfWeek = m_MonthStartDate.DayOfWeek;
int daysOffset = Math.Abs(DayOfWeek.Sunday - monthStartDayOfWeek);

{
 //Here is where I want to loop through the textboxes and assign values based on the 'i' value
   DateTextBox(daysOffset + i) = m_MonthStartDate.AddDays(i).Day.ToString();
}
 Let me clarify that these textboxes appear on separate panels (37 of them). So in order for me to loop through using a foreach, I have to loop through the primary controls (the panels), then loop through the controls on the panels. It starts getting complicated. Any suggestions on how I can assign this value to the textbox?

@TITLE:How do I move files to an archive folder after the files have been processed?
@CONTENT:I am trying to archive a set of files from the source path to an archive path once I have completed doing some Data Flow Task items. Inside of a Foreach Loop Container I have: Script Task -> Data Flow Task -> Execute SQL Task -> File System Task I have a User variable set to the "Name and extension" item under the Collection settings in the Foreach Loop Container. The variable is called "fileName" and is used in both the Script Task (used to parse out info from file and perform the Execute SQL Task) as well as in the Data Flow Task in the Flat File Connection Manager which in turn is used by the Flat File Source element. I then parse the file and insert the data into a database. All works as it should until I get to the File System Task (FST). What I would like is to have the file moved to an archive folder once its insert is completed. Using several links online (here, here and here) I have added different variables that are either hard-coded or derived from massaging other variables. In any case what happens is that on the FST I get errors like 'invalid characters in path' or 'unknown path'. If I try to massage the examples linked above to fit my filesystem structure I now get an error on the Flat File Source step in the Data Flow Task stating it cannot find the file specified. This is caused because it a) cannot find the path to the file because no file path is give, just the filname.ext b) cannot parse the variable that contains the full path to the source file (@FullSourcePathFileName which has its value set to @[User::SourcePath] + @[User::fileName]) I have tested other various modifications including doing exactly what is in the first example I posted (however that one does not actually do anything the Data Flow Task so I just added a Flat File Source step with no destination) and received the same set of errors. I am at a loss here and would like any input on how to solve this issue. EDIT: Seems that it keeps failing on the FullArchivePathFileName - it never evaluates the expression even though I have it set to 'True'. Still confused as to why it is not evaluating it. So I made its expression the same as FullSourcePathFileName and verified the EvaluateAsExpression flag is set to True. It still does not evaluate this variable.The FullSourcePathFileName variable is being evaluated just fine.

@TITLE:Why does my spinner GIF stop while jQuery ajax call is running?
@CONTENT:I'm just starting to wean myself from ASP.NET UpdatePanels. I'm using jQuery and jTemplates to bind the results of a web service to a grid, and everything works fine. Here's the thing: I'm trying to show a spinner GIF while the table is being refreshed (? la UpdateProgress in ASP.NET) I've got it all working, except that the spinner is frozen. To see what's going on, I've tried moving the spinner out from the update progress div and out on the page where I can see it the whole time. It spins and spins until the refresh starts, and stays frozen until the refresh is done, and then starts spinning again. Not really what you want from a 'please wait' spinner! This is in IE7 - haven't had a chance to test in other browsers yet. Any thoughts? Is the ajax call or the client-side databinding so resource-intensive that the browser is unable to tend to its animated GIFs? Update Here's the code that refreshes the grid. Not sure if this is synchronous or asynchronous. updateConcessions = function(e) {
    $.ajax({
        type: "POST",
        url: "Concessions.aspx/GetConcessions",
        data: "{'Countries':'ga'}",
        contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8",
        dataType: "json",
        success: function(msg) {
            applyTemplate(msg);
        },
        error: function(XMLHttpRequest, textStatus, errorThrown) {
        }
    });
}

applyTemplate = function(msg) {
    $('div#TemplateTarget').setTemplate($('div#TemplateSource').html());
    $('div#TemplateTarget').processTemplate(msg);
}
 Update 2 I just checked the jQuery documentation and the $.ajax() method is asynchronous by default. Just for kicks I added this $.ajax({
    async: true,
    ...
 and it didn't make any difference.
@CODE:updateConcessions = function(e) {

@CONTENT:When I use static variables in C++, I often end up wanting to initialize one variable passing another to its constructor. In other words, I want to create static instances that depend on each other. Within a single .cpp or .h file this is not a problem: the instances will be created in the order they are declared. However, when you want to initialize a static instance with an instance in another compilation unit, the order seems impossible to specify. The result is that, depending on the weather, it can happen that the instance that depends on another is constructed, and only afterwards the other instance is constructed. The result is that the first instance is initialized incorrectly. Does anyone know how to ensure that static objects are created in the correct order? I have searched a long time for a solution, trying all of them (including the Schwarz Counter solution), but I begin to doubt there is one that really works. One possibility is the trick with the static function member: Type& globalObject()
{
    static Type theOneAndOnlyInstance;
    return theOneAndOnlyInstance;
}
 Indeed, this does work. Regrettably, you have to write globalObject().MemberFunction(), instead of globalObject.MemberFunction(), resulting in somewhat confusing and inelegant client code. Update: Thank you for your reactions. Regrettably, it indeed seems like I have answered my own question. I guess I'll have to learn to live with it...

@TITLE:Find Recursive Group Membership (Active Directory) using C#
@CONTENT:I am looking to get a list of all of the groups that a user is a member of in Active Directory, both explicitly listed in the memberOf property list as well as implicitly through nested group membership. For example, if I examine UserA and UserA is a part of GroupA and GroupB, I also want to list GroupC if GroupB is a member of GroupC. To give you a bit more insight into my application, I will be doing this on a limited basis. Basically, I want a security check occasionally that will list these additional memberships. I will want to differentiate the two but that shouldn't be hard. My problem is that I have not found an efficient way to make this query work. The standard text on Active Directory (This CodeProject Article) shows a way to do this that is basically a recursive lookup. That seems terribly inefficient. Even in my small domain, a user might have 30+ group memberships. That means 30+ calls to Active Directory for one user. I've looked into the following LDAP code to get all of the memberOf entries at once: (memberOf:1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941:={0})
 where {0} would be my LDAP path (ex: CN=UserA,OU=Users,DC=foo,DC=org). However, it does not return any records. The downside of this method, even if it worked, would be that I wouldn't know which group was explicit and which was implicit. That is what I have so far. I would like to know if there is a better way than the CodeProject article and, if so, how that could be accomplished (actual code would be wonderful). I am using .NET 4.0 and C#. My Active Directory is at a Windows 2008 functional level (it isn't R2 yet).

I do in fact always do this, and didn't mean to suggest that this was wrong.

@CONTENT:I'm trying to run an Excel macro from outside of the Excel file. I'm currently using a ".vbs" file run from the command line, but it keeps telling me the macro can't be found. Here is the script I'm trying to use Set objExcel = CreateObject("Excel.Application")
Set objWorkbook = objExcel.Workbooks.Open("test.xls")

objExcel.Application.Visible = True
objExcel.Workbooks.Add
objExcel.Cells(1, 1).Value = "Test value"

objExcel.Application.Run "Macro.TestMacro()"
objExcel.ActiveWorkbook.Close


objExcel.Application.Quit
WScript.Echo "Finished."
WScript.Quit
 And here is the Macro I'm trying to access: Sub TestMacro()
'first set a string which contains the path to the file you want to create.
'this example creates one and stores it in the root directory
MyFile = "C:\Users\username\Desktop\" & "TestResult.txt"
'set and open file for output
fnum = FreeFile()
Open MyFile For Output As fnum
'write project info and then a blank line. Note the comma is required
Write #fnum, "I wrote this"
Write #fnum,
'use Print when you want the string without quotation marks
Print #fnum, "I printed this"
Close #fnum
End Sub
 I tried the solutions located at Is it possible to run a macro in Excel from external command? to get this far (and modified of course) but it didn't seem to work. I keep getting the error `Microsoft Office Excel: The macro 'Macro.TestMacro' cannot be found. EDIT: Excel 2003.

@TITLE:How to get Docker to run on a Windows System behind a corporate firewall?
@CONTENT:i'm trying to get a working docker-installation following this tutorial: http://docs.docker.io/en/latest/installation/windows/ So far, I got the VM running with a manually downloaded repository (followed the github-link and downloaded as zip, because "git clone" didnt work behind my corporate proxy, even after setting up the proxy with "git conf --global http.proxy ..." - it kept asking me for authentification 407, although i entered my user & PW). Now I am in the state in which i should use "docker run busybox echo hello world" (Section "Running Docker"). When i do this, i first get told that docker is not installed (as shown at the bottom of the tutorial), and then, after i got it with apt-get install docker, i get "Segmentation Fault or critical error encountered. dumping core and aborting." What to do now? Is this because i didnt use git clone or is something wrong with the docker installation? I read somewhere, that apt-get install docker doesnt install the docker i want, but some GNOME-Tool, can i maybe specify my apt-request to get the right tool?

@TITLE:CORS: Cannot use wildcard in Access-Control-Allow-Origin when credentials flag is true
@CONTENT:I have a setup involving Frontend server (Node.js, domain: localhost:3000) <---> Backend (Django, Ajax, domain: localhost:8000) Browser <-- webapp <-- Node.js (Serve the app) Browser (webapp) --> Ajax --> Django(Serve ajax POST requests) Now, my problem here is with CORS setup which the webapp uses to make Ajax calls to the backend server. In chrome, I keep getting Cannot use wildcard in Access-Control-Allow-Origin when credentials flag is true. doesn't work on firefox either. My Node.js setup is: var allowCrossDomain = function(req, res, next) {
    res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', 'http://localhost:8000/');
    res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Credentials', true);
    res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET,PUT,POST,DELETE');
    res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept");
    next();
};
 And in Django I'm using this middleware along with this The webapp makes requests as such: $.ajax({
    type: "POST",
    url: 'http://localhost:8000/blah',
    data: {},
    xhrFields: {
        withCredentials: true
    },
    crossDomain: true,
    dataType: 'json',
    success: successHandler
});
 So, the request headers that the webapp sends looks like: Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: "Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept"
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: 'GET,PUT,POST,DELETE'
Content-Type: application/json 
Accept: */*
Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate,sdch
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8
Cookie: csrftoken=***; sessionid="***"
 And here's the response header: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type,*
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST,GET,OPTIONS,PUT,DELETE
Content-Type: application/json

@TITLE:How do I use Moq to mock an extension method?
@CONTENT:I am writing a test that depends on the results of an extension method but I don't want a future failure of that extension method to ever break this test. Mocking that result seemed the obvious choice but Moq doesn't seem to offer a way to override a static method (a requirement for an extension method). There is a similar idea with Moq.Protected and Moq.Stub, but they don't seem to offer anything for this scenario. Am I missing something or should I be going about this a different way? Here is a trivial example that fails with the usual "Invalid expectation on a non-overridable member". This is a bad example of needing to mock an extension method, but it should do. public class SomeType {
    int Id { get; set; }
}

var ListMock = new Mock<List<SomeType>>();
ListMock.Expect(l => l.FirstOrDefault(st => st.Id == 5))
        .Returns(new SomeType { Id = 5 });
 As for any TypeMock junkies that might suggest I use Isolator instead: I appreciate the effort since it looks like TypeMock could do the job blindfolded and inebriated, but our budget isn't increasing any time soon.
@CODE:public class SomeType {
    int Id { get; set; }
}

var ListMock = new Mock<List<SomeType>>();
ListMock.Expect(l => l.FirstOrDefault(st => st.Id == 5))

@TITLE:Why does division by zero with floating point (or double precision) numbers not throw java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero in Java
@CONTENT:The following statement throws java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero as obvious. System.out.println(0/0);
 because the literal 0 is considered to be an int literal and divide by zero is not allowed in integer arithmetic. The following case however doesn't throw any exception like java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero. int a = 0;
double b = 6.199;
System.out.println((b/a));
 It displays Infinity. The following statement produces NaN (Not a Number) with no exception. System.out.println(0D/0); //or 0.0/0, or 0.0/0.0 or 0/0.0 - floating point arithmetic.
 In this case, both of the operands are considered to be double. Similarly, the following statements don't throw any exception. double div1 = 0D/0; //or 0D/0D
double div2 = 0/0D; //or 0D/0D

System.out.printf("div1 = %s : div2 = %s%n", div1, div2);
System.out.printf("div1 == div2 : %b%n", div1 == div2);
System.out.printf("div1 == div1 : %b%n", div1 == div1);
System.out.printf("div2 == div2 : %b%n", div2 == div2);
System.out.printf("Double.NaN == Double.NaN : %b%n", Double.NaN == Double.NaN);
System.out.printf("Float.NaN == Float.NaN : %b%n", Float.NaN == Float.NaN);
 They produce the following output. div1 = NaN : div2 = NaN
div1 == div2 : false
div1 == div1 : false
div2 == div2 : false
Double.NaN == Double.NaN : false
Float.NaN == Float.NaN : false
 They all return false. Why is this operation (division by zero) allowed with floating point or double precision numbers? By the way, I can understand that floating point numbers (double precision numbers) have their values that represent positive infinity, negative infinity, not a number (NaN)...

@CONTENT:Can a class add a method to itself at runtime (like from a static block), so that if someone is performing reflection on this class, they'll see the new method, even though it wasn't defined at compile time? Background: A framework I'm using expects Action classes to be defined that have a doAction(...) method, by convention. The framework inspects these classes at runtime to see what type of parameters are available in their doAction() method. For example: doAction(String a, Integer b) I'd like each class to be able to programatically generate its doAction() method with various parameters, just-in-time when it is inspected. The body of the method can be empty.

@TITLE:MySQL number of items within ¡§in clause¡¨
@CONTENT:I have three tables to define users: USER: user_id (int), username (varchar)
USER_METADATA_FIELD: user_metadata_field_id (int), field_name (varchar)
USER_METADATA: user_metadata_field_id (int), user_id (int), field_value (varchar)
 I'd like to create a middle tier user that has certain access to other users within the application. To determine which users the logged in use can access, I am using a subquery like the following: SELECT user_id FROM user WHERE user_id 
     IN (SELECT user_id 
         FROM user_metadata 
         WHERE user_metadata_field_id = 1 AND field_value = 'foo')
 Currently I am storing the subquery string in a variable and then dynamically inserting it into the outer query each time I need to pull a list of users. After doing this I thought, "it has got to be better to just store a string of the actual user_ids". So instead of storing this in a variable... $subSql = "SELECT user_id FROM user_metadata WHERE user_metadata_field_id = 1 AND field_value = 'foo'";
 ... I actually perform the query and store the result like this... $subSql = "12, 56, 89, 100, 1234, 890";
 Then when I need to pull a lit of users that the logged in user has access to, I can do so with: $sql = "SELECT user_id FROM user WHERE user_id IN ($subSql)";
 And finally the questions: How many items can you use in a MySQL IN CLAUSE? Storing the actual ids instead of the sub-sql statement has got to be faster for performing that outer query each time, right?
@CODE:USER: user_id (int), username (varchar)
USER_METADATA_FIELD: user_metadata_field_id (int), field_name (varchar)
USER_METADATA: user_metadata_field_id (int), user_id (int), field_value (varchar) SELECT user_id FROM user WHERE user_id 
     IN (SELECT user_id 
         FROM user_metadata 
         WHERE user_metadata_field_id = 1 AND field_value = 'foo') user_id $subSql = "SELECT user_id FROM user_metadata WHERE user_metadata_field_id = 1 AND field_value = 'foo'"; $subSql = "12, 56, 89, 100, 1234, 890"; $sql = "SELECT user_id FROM user WHERE user_id IN ($subSql)"; IN

            result = HttpProxy.httpPost(AnototudoMetadata.URL_AUTENTICACAO, httpClient, listaParametros);
            }catch (IOException e) {
                Log.e(TAG, "IOException, Sem conectividade com o servidor do Anototudo! " + e.getMessage());

        {
            progressDialog.dismiss();
        }

    } 
 3) When the button is pressed I than build the ProgressDialog anc call the AsyncTask I have created:     OnClickListener loginListener = new OnClickListener() {
      public void onClick(View v) {


//next line should start progress dialog in main thread ?????
   progressDialog = ProgressDialog.show(LoginActivity.this, "Login in", "Wait a moment please", true, false);

   //next couple of lines should do an ascyn call to server
   EfetuaLogin efetuaLogin = new EfetuaLogin();
   efetuaLogin.execute(params);
   try {
    //recover the server response and sets time out to be 25seconds
    sResposta = efetuaLogin.get(25, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
 Well, this is it, I believe this was suppose to show a progress dialog while the AsyncTask would query the server in background, but what I get is NO progress bar until server response arrives and than for a fraction of time(less than 1 second) the progress shows and the next Activity is called. As I mentioned I have re-checked this code and simply can't find where I got it wrong. Any suggestions? Thank you in advance. Hi, as suggested by Charlie Sheen(???) in the first answer for this thread I have tryied changing a bit of my code and now it is like(Unfortunatelly it is not working as expected so far): OnClickListener loginListener = new OnClickListener() {
        public void onClick(View v) {
                //async call????????
        new EfetuaLogin().execute(params);
...
 And than do all the work to deal with response in the AsyncTask: class EfetuaLogin extends AsyncTask<Object, Void, String> {

        private final static String TAG = "LoginActivity.EfetuaLogin";

        @Override
        protected void onPreExecute()

            //inicia di?logo de progresso, mostranto processamento com servidor.
            progressDialog = ProgressDialog.show(LoginActivity.this, "Autenticando", "Contactando o servidor, por favor, aguarde alguns instantes.", true, false);
        }

@CONTENT:I have a JAX-RS webservice (Jersey) that is a CRUD interface for JPA (EclipseLink) entities. My entities were autogenerated from the database tables and I have annotated them with JAXB annotations so that they can be marshalled/unmarshalled to/from XML. My resource methods take JAXBElement objects as a parameter where required. I don't have an XSD, however, I'm willing to write one to validate the XML received in the requests. But, I don't know how to initiate the validation. Jersey is automatically handling the marshalling/unmarshalling and any references I've found about validation is done at that level. Does someone know of an example/tutorial that shows how to do this? Thanks!

@TITLE:How do I get a UTC Timestamp in JavaScript?
@CONTENT:While writing a web application, it makes sense to store (server side) all datetimes in the DB as UTC timestamps. I was astonished when I noticed that you couldn't natively do much in terms of Timezone manipulation in Javascript. I extended the Date object a little. Does this function make sense? Basically, every time I send anything to the server, it's going to be a timestamp formatted with this function... Can you see any major problems here? Or maybe a solution from a different angle? Date.prototype.getUTCTime = function(){ 
  return new Date(
    this.getUTCFullYear(),
    this.getUTCMonth(),
    this.getUTCDate(),
    this.getUTCHours(),
    this.getUTCMinutes(), 
    this.getUTCSeconds()
  ).getTime(); 
}
 It just seems a little convoluted to me. And I am not so sure about performance either... Thanks! Merc.

@TITLE:Domain name validation with RegEx
@CONTENT:Firstly sorry for the 10,000th RegEx question, I realise there are other domain related questions but the regex is either not working properly, too complex, or for urls with subdomains, protocols, and filepaths. Mine is more simple, I need to validate a domain name: google.com stackoverflow.com So a domain in its rawest form - not even a subdomain like www. Characters should only be a-z | A-Z | 0-9 and period(.) and dash(-) The domain name part should not start or end with dash (-) (e.g. -google-.com) The domain name part should be between 1 and 63 characters long The extension (TLD) can be anything under #1 rules for now, I may validate them against a list later, it should be 1 or more characters though Edit: TLD is apparently 2-6 chars as it stands no. 4 revised: TLD should actually be labelled "subdomain" as it should include things like .co.uk -- I would imagine the only validation possible (apart from checking against a list) would be 'after the first dot there should be one or more characters under rules #1 Thanks very much, believe me I did try!

@TITLE:Overloading Arithmetic Operators in JavaScript?
@CONTENT:This is the best way I can think of phrasing this question, given this JavaScript "class" definition: var Quota = function(hours, minutes, seconds){
    if (arguments.length === 3) {
        this.hours = hours;
        this.minutes = minutes;
        this.seconds = seconds;

        this.totalMilliseconds = Math.floor((hours * 3600000)) + Math.floor((minutes * 60000)) + Math.floor((seconds * 1000));
    }
    else if (arguments.length === 1) {
        this.totalMilliseconds = hours;

        this.hours = Math.floor(this.totalMilliseconds / 3600000);
        this.minutes = Math.floor((this.totalMilliseconds % 3600000) / 60000);
        this.seconds = Math.floor(((this.totalMilliseconds % 3600000) % 60000) / 1000);
    }

    this.padL = function(val){
        return (val.toString().length === 1) ? "0" + val : val;
    };

    this.toString = function(){
        return this.padL(this.hours) + ":" + this.padL(this.minutes) + ":" + this.padL(this.seconds);
    };

    this.valueOf = function(){
        return this.totalMilliseconds;
    };
};
 and the following test setup code: var q1 = new Quota(23, 58, 50);
var q2 = new Quota(0, 1, 0);
var q3 = new Quota(0, 0, 10);

console.log("Quota 01 is " + q1.toString());    // Prints "Quota 01 is 23:58:50"
console.log("Quota 02 is " + q2.toString());    // Prints "Quota 02 is 00:01:00"
console.log("Quota 03 is " + q3.toString());    // Prints "Quota 03 is 00:00:10"
 Is there any way of implicitly creating q4 as a Quota object using the addition operator as follows... var q4 = q1 + q2 + q3;
console.log("Quota 04 is " + q4.toString());    // Prints "Quota 04 is 86400000"
 rather than resorting to... var q4 = new Quota(q1 + q2 + q3);
console.log("Quota 04 is " + q4.toString());    // Prints "Quota 04 is 24:00:00"
 If not what are the best practice recommendations in this area for making custom numeric JavaScript objects composable via the arithmetic operators?
@CODE:var Quota = function(hours, minutes, seconds){
    if (arguments.length === 3) {
        this.hours = hours;
        this.minutes = minutes;
        this.seconds = seconds;

        this.totalMilliseconds = Math.floor((hours * 3600000)) + Math.floor((minutes * 60000)) + Math.floor((seconds * 1000));
    }
    else if (arguments.length === 1) {
        this.totalMilliseconds = hours;

        this.hours = Math.floor(this.totalMilliseconds / 3600000);
        this.minutes = Math.floor((this.totalMilliseconds % 3600000) / 60000);
        this.seconds = Math.floor(((this.totalMilliseconds % 3600000) % 60000) / 1000);
    }

    this.padL = function(val){
        return (val.toString().length === 1) ? "0" + val : val;
    };

    this.toString = function(){
        return this.padL(this.hours) + ":" + this.padL(this.minutes) + ":" + this.padL(this.seconds);
    };

    this.valueOf = function(){

}; var q1 = new Quota(23, 58, 50);

@CONTENT:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.double.epsilon.aspx If you create a custom algorithm that determines whether two floating-point numbers can be considered equal, you must use a value that is greater than the Epsilon constant to establish the acceptable absolute margin of difference for the two values to be considered equal. (Typically, that margin of difference is many times greater than Epsilon.) So is this not really an epsilon that could be used for comparisons? I don't really understand the MSDN wording. Can it be used as the epsilon in the examples here? - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17333/most-effective-way-for-float-and-double-comparison/253874#253874 And finally this seems really important so I'd like to make sure I have a solid implementation for equality, greater than, less than, less than or equal to, and greater than or equal to.

@TITLE:Modify HTTP Headers for a JSONP request
@CONTENT:I am using jquery to build a request to the Twitter Search API. I am using jsonp, as is needed for cross-domain requests. However, the Twitter API specifies that you should set a unique User-Agent for these requests, and limits your requests if you do not. The problem is, I see no way of setting this header via jquery. This is the code I am using: $.ajax({
    url: 'http://search.twitter.com/search.json',
    dataType: 'jsonp',
    type: 'get',
    data: { q: 'twitter' },
    success: function(data) {
        alert(data.results);
    }
});
 I have tried using the beforeSend method, but it appears that this event is not firing. Can anyone come up with any way of solving this problem? Thanks.

What is the invisible margin that code should be separated at? Also, what's the point of header files?

@TITLE:ASP.NET MVC 4 - for loop posts model collection properties but foreach does not
@CONTENT:Say I have the following models: public class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
}

public class Town
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public IEnumerable<Person> People { get; set; }
}
 Then, in my Razor view, I have this: @model Town
@using(Html.BeginForm())
{
    <table>
        @foreach(var person in Model.People)
        {
            <tr>
                <td>@Html.TextBoxFor(m => person.Name)</td>
                <td>@Html.TextBoxFor(m => person.Age)</td>
            </tr>
        }
    <table>
    <input type="submit" />
}
 Then, I have an action for the POST, something like this: [HttpPost]
public ActionResult Index(Town theTown)
{
    //....
}
 When I post, the IEnumerable<Person> does not come across. If I look at it in Fiddler, the collection only posts once, and doesn't enumerate the collection, so I get: People.Name = "whatever"
People.Age = 99
 However, if I change People to an IList and use a for loop instead of a foreach... @for(var i = 0;i < Model.People.Count;i++)
{
    <tr>
        <td>@Html.TextBoxFor(m => Model.People[i].Name)</td>
        <td>@Html.TextBoxFor(m => Model.People[i].Age)</td>
    </tr>
}
 It works. Am I doing something wrong? What am I missing?
@CODE:public class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }

@TITLE:Pivot on Multiple Columns using Tablefunc
@CONTENT:Has anyone used tablefunc to pivot on multiple variables as opposed to only using row name? The documentation notes: The "extra" columns are expected to be the same for all rows with the same row_name value. I'm not sure how to do this without combining the columns that I want to pivot on (which I highly doubt will give me the speed I need). One possible way to do this would be to make the entity numeric and add it to the localt as milliseconds, but this seems like a shaky way to proceed. I've edited the data used in a response to this question: PostgreSQL Crosstab Query.  CREATE TEMP TABLE t4 (
  timeof   timestamp
 ,entity    character
 ,status    integer
 ,ct        integer);

 INSERT INTO t4 VALUES 
  ('2012-01-01', 'a', 1, 1)
 ,('2012-01-01', 'a', 0, 2)
 ,('2012-01-02', 'b', 1, 3)
 ,('2012-01-02', 'c', 0, 4);

 SELECT * FROM crosstab(
     'SELECT timeof, entity, status, ct
      FROM   t4
      ORDER  BY 1,2,3'
     ,$$VALUES (1::text), (0::text)$$)
 AS ct ("Section" timestamp, "Attribute" character, "1" int, "0" int);
 Returns: 
 Section                   | Attribute | 1 | 0
---------------------------+-----------+---+---
 2012-01-01 00:00:00       |     a     | 1 | 2
 2012-01-02 00:00:00       |     b     | 3 | 4
 So as the documentation states, the extra column aka 'Attribute' is assumed to be the same for each row name aka 'Section'. Thus, it reports b for the second row even though 'entity' also has a 'c' value for that 'timeof' value. Desired Output: Section                   | Attribute | 1 | 0
--------------------------+-----------+---+---
2012-01-01 00:00:00       |     a     | 1 | 2
2012-01-02 00:00:00       |     b     | 3 |  
2012-01-02 00:00:00       |     c     |   | 4
 Any thoughts or references? A little more background: I potentially need to do this for billions of rows and I'm testing out storing this data in long and wide formats and seeing if I can use tablefunc to go from long to wide format more efficiently than with regular aggregate functions. I'll have about 100 measurements made every minute for around 300 entities. Often, we will need to compare the different measurements made for a given second for a given entity, so we will need to go to wide format very often. Also, the measurements made on a particular entity are highly variable. EDIT: I found a resource on this: http://www.postgresonline.com/journal/categories/24-tablefunc.
@CODE:tablefunc CREATE TEMP TABLE t4 (
  timeof   timestamp
 ,entity    character
 ,status    integer
 ,ct        integer);

 INSERT INTO t4 VALUES 
  ('2012-01-01', 'a', 1, 1)

@TITLE:Python 3.x rounding behavior
@CONTENT:I was just re-reading What¡¦s New In Python 3.0 and it states: The round() function rounding strategy and return type have changed. Exact halfway cases are now rounded to the nearest even result instead of away from zero. (For example, round(2.5) now returns 2 rather than 3.) and the documentation for round: For the built-in types supporting round(), values are rounded to the closest multiple of 10 to the power minus n; if two multiples are equally close, rounding is done toward the even choice So, under v2.7.3: In [85]: round(2.5)
Out[85]: 3.0

In [86]: round(3.5)
Out[86]: 4.0
 as I'd have expected. However, now under v3.2.3: In [32]: round(2.5)
Out[32]: 2

In [33]: round(3.5)
Out[33]: 4
 This seems counter-intuitive and contrary to what I understand about rounding (and bound to trip up people). English isn't my native language but until I read this I thought I knew what rounding meant :-/ I am sure at the time v3 was introduced there must have been some discussion of this, but I was unable to find a good reason in my search. Does anyone have insight into why this was changed to this? Are there any other mainstream programming languages (e.g., C, C++, Java, Perl, ..) that do this sort of (to me inconsistent) rounding? What am I missing here? UPDATE: @Li-aungYip's comment re "Banker's rounding" gave me the right search term/keywords to search for and I found this SO question: Why does .NET use banker's rounding as default?, so I will be reading that carefully.

@CONTENT:Since it is possible that a function declared as constexpr can be called during run-time, under which criteria does the compiler decide whether to compute it at compile-time or during runtime? template<typename base_t, typename expo_t>
constexpr base_t POW(base_t base, expo_t expo)

 In this case, i is unknown at compile-time, which is probably the reason why the compiler treats POW() as a regular function which is called at runtime. This dynamic however, as convenient as it may appear to be, has some impractical implications. For instance, could there be a case where I would like the compiler to compute a constexpr function during compile-time, where the compiler decides to treat it as a normal function instead, when it would have worked during compile-time as well? Are there any known common pitfalls?
@CODE:template<typename base_t, typename expo_t>

@TITLE:Does C++ support Variable Length Arrays?
@CONTENT:No, wait, bear with me... VLAs were always a GCC extension, but they were adopted by C99: [C99: 6.7.5.2/4]: If the size is not present, the array type is an incomplete type. If the size is * instead of being an expression, the array type is a variable length array type of unspecified size, which can only be used in declarations with function prototype scope; such arrays are nonetheless complete types. If the size is an integer constant expression and the element type has a known constant size, the array type is not a variable length array type; otherwise, the array type is a variable length array type. C99 is also known as ISO/IEC 9899:1999. Now: [C++11: 1.1/2]: C++ is a general purpose programming language based on the C programming language as specified in ISO/IEC 9899:1999 (hereinafter referred to as the C standard). In addition to the facilities provided by C, C++ provides additional data types, classes, templates, exceptions, namespaces, operator overloading, function name overloading, references, free store management operators, and additional library facilities. So shouldn't C++11 have VLAs too?

@TITLE:Swift extract regex matches
@CONTENT:I want to extract substrings from a string that match a regex pattern. So I'm looking for something like this: func matchesForRegexInText(regex: String!, text: String!) -> [String] {
   ???
}
 So this is what I have: func matchesForRegexInText(regex: String!, text: String!) -> [String] {

    var regex = NSRegularExpression(pattern: regex, 
        options: nil, error: nil)

    var results = regex.matchesInString(text, 
        options: nil, range: NSMakeRange(0, countElements(text))) 
            as Array<NSTextCheckingResult>

    /// ???

    return ...
}
 The problem is, that matchesInString delivers me an array of NSTextCheckingResult, where NSTextCheckingResult.range is of type NSRange. NSRange is incompatible with Range<String.Index>, so it prevents me of using text.substringWithRange(...) Any idea how to achieve this simple thing in swift without too many lines of code?
@CODE:func matchesForRegexInText(regex: String!, text: String!) -> [String] {

@CONTENT:I am trying to parse some dates that are coming out of a document. It would appear users have entered these dates in a similar but not exact format. here are the formats: 9/09 9/2009 09/2009 9/1/2009 9-1-2009 What is the best way to go about trying to parse all of these? These seem to be the most common, but I guess what is hanging me up is that if i have a pattern of "M/yyyy" wont that always catch before "MM/yyyy" Do I have to set up my try/catch blocks nested in a least restrictive to most restrictive way? it seems like it sure is going to take a lot of code duplication to get this right.

@TITLE:Migrate from Oracle to MySQL
@CONTENT:We ran into serious performance problems with our Oracle database and we would like to try to migrate it to a MySQL-based database (either MySQL directly or, more preferably, Infobright). The thing is, we need to let the old and the new system overlap for at least some weeks if not months, before we actually know, if all the features of the new database match our needs. So, here is our situation: The Oracle database consists of multiple tables with each millions of rows. During the day, there are literally thousands of statements, which we cannot stop for migration. Every morning, new data is imported into the Oracle database, replacing some thousands of rows. Copying this process is not a problem, so we could, in theory, import in both databases in parallel. But, and here the challenge lies, for this to work we need to have an export from the Oracle database with a consistent state from one day. (We cannot export some tables on Monday and some others on Tuesday, etc.) This means, that at least the export should be finished in less than one day. Our first thought was to dump the schema, but I wasn't able to find a tool to import an Oracle dump file into MySQL. Exporting tables in CSV files might work, but I'm afraid it could take too long. So my question now is: What should I do? Is there any tool to import Oracle dump files into MySQL? Does anybody have any experience with such a large-scale migration? PS: Please, don't suggest performance optimization techniques for Oracle, we already tried a lot :-) Edit: We already tried some ETL tools before, only to find out, that they were not fast enough: Exporting only one table already took more than 4 hours ... 2nd Edit: Come on folks ... did nobody ever try to export a whole database as fast as possible and convert the data so that it can be imported into another database system?

@TITLE:How to cancel this repeating alarm?
@CONTENT:I'm writing something like a reminder for users. Users will set reminders for their events, when the time comes, a repeating alarm will be set to trigger a status bar notification. But the alarm seems non-stop after I selected the notification or cleared the notification. I am not sure where to cancel this repeating alarm. Below are some of the codes: Set up the repeating alarm in my main activity alarmTime = Calendar.getInstance();
Intent intent = new Intent(this, AlarmReceive.class);
PendingIntent sender = PendingIntent.getBroadcast(this, 0, intent, 0);
AlarmManager alarmManager = (AlarmManager) getSystemService(ALARM_SERVICE);

alarmTime.add(Calendar.MINUTE,offset_time);

//Schedule the alarm
alarmManager.setRepeating(AlarmManager.RTC_WAKEUP, alarmTime.getTimeInMillis(), 30 * 1000, sender);
 In my OnReceive method, I just display the notification in status bar and set the flag as FLAG_AUTO_CANCEL manager = (NotificationManager) context.getSystemService(context.NOTIFICATION_SERVICE);

// Set the icon, scrolling text and timestamp
Notification notification = new Notification(R.drawable.medical, text, System.currentTimeMillis());

PendingIntent contentIntent = PendingIntent.getActivity(context, 0, i, 0);

notification.flags = Notification.FLAG_AUTO_CANCEL;

manager.notify(R.string.service_text, notification);
 How can I stop the alarm when the user selects the notification or clears it?
@CODE:alarmTime = Calendar.getInstance();
Intent intent = new Intent(this, AlarmReceive.class);
PendingIntent sender = PendingIntent.getBroadcast(this, 0, intent, 0);
